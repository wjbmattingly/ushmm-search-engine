        "Question: United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, Jeff and Toby Herr collection.\nThis is an interview with Eddie Willner, conducted by Arwin Donohue, on July the 12\",\ninterview that was conducted with Mr. Willner, on May 25\", 1989. And this is tape\nnumber one, side A. Okay, one thing that I wanted to ask you about Mr. Willner, is that\nin the first interview that the Holocaust Museum did with you, there -- we didn\u2019t discuss\nyour -- your childhood at all, before Kristallnacht. And I wondered if you would say\nsomething about your -- your father, and your mother, and your -- your school\nexperience.",
        "Answer: Okay, I said before, I was born in Munchinglapba, which is in the Rhineland,\nnear Cologne, between Cologne and Dusseldorf. And I am a fairly good rec -- recol --\nrecollection. My mother already is born in that city, and my father was born about 20\nmiles from there. And my father got to know my mother because of World War One. He\nwas in the German army, in the front line, and just like today when we have a war, on --\nWorld War Two, families send packages to their sons, who are soldiers, or -- or\ncommunities do that to the sons of the community who are fighting wars. And so in my\nfather\u2019s case, he received, while he was in Russia, so-called care packages, and -- from\nthe Winter family. We had a Willners, and the Winter family had two daughters and one\nson.",
        "Q: The Winter family is your mother\u2019s family?",
        "A: My mother\u2019s family. And so when the war was over, my father went to this home, and\n-- to thank her for the two years of cookies, or baked stuff they sent him to Russia. And\nthen they both -- the girl that sent these to him, my aunt, and my mother were not\nmarried, but -- and he -- my father, of course, 1s not, and he was looking around to see if\nhe could find a wife, or something. And he did not get interested in the girl that send him\nthe cookies, baked the cookies, but in her sister, younger sister, which became -- who\nbecame my mother.",
        "Q: What was your mother\u2019s name?",
        "A: My mother\u2019s name was Augusta Willner -- or Winter, as -- here. And they got married\nin 1924, and two years later I arrived. The period in Germany, in that time, was bad, just\nlike in the United States. We had the collapse of the stock market, [indecipherable] by\nWorld War One, and there were many people without jobs, and many upheavals.\nCommunists and others. And so I -- I assumed that they knew each other since the end of\nthe war, since that\u2019s when he went there first, but they got married 1924. And so six years\nlater, and I arrived another two years later, I was the only child of -- and I also think I\nknow is shu -- that\u2019s reason my parents had only one child, because the situation -- the\neconomic situation in Germany was very bad, complete collapse. And my father did have\na job, and so we -- apparently, they had no problems, but they decided just to have one\nchild. And then Hitler came on the scene, and then su-sure enough, a lot of Jews didn\u2019t\nhave a -- had less children, and in my father\u2019s case, he lived, like I said, 20 miles from\nwhere I was born, and his father lived in that same house in the country, til 1941, and he\nwas -- then they took him out of his house, they took the house away from him, and sold\nit, the Nazi party, and they gave it to a Nazi, was -- and -- and so in -- in that house were\nall the belongings of the Willner family, which were demolished on the Crystal night.\nAnd I[ have to tell a story about my father, because it was different in many cases, 1n this\ncase, 1t was -- it turned out pretty good. When my -- when Crystal night happened, they\nburned the synagogues, and they demolished Jewish homes, stores, and wrote Jew on\nbuildings belonging to Jews. My fa-father went -- left the -- he knew there was something\ngoing on against the Jews, and he went to look after his father, lived by himself, almost\n80 years old, and -- but pretty fit, but he want to see then he\u2019s okay, so he | -- went there,\nand when he came to the house -- like I tell you, 1s a small community in the country,\nmaybe about 500 people living there. And he had a tha -- I think the house must have\nbeen built just before World War One.[indecipherable] and he walked in, and he knew\nthat something going on inside. As he walked in, he saw Na-Nazis in -- in uniform, the\nBrown shirts, smashing everything in the place. My grandfather standing by and,\nwatching, not saying anything. So my father walked in, he knew that he -- he shouldn\u2019t\nhave come, maybe, except for his father. And the chief of police of the little town of\nKlaifaht was there. The chief of police was not a Nazi, he was in uniform, police uniform.\nAnd my father walked in, he says, \u201cSiegfried,\u201d which was his name, \u201cwhat are you doing\nhere?\u201d The connection between him and the chief of police was that when they were little\nchildren, or boys, they sat together on a -- on a school bench for several years. And they\nknew each other very -- very well. So he couldn\u2019t, in front of other people, Germans, say,\n\u201cDisappear, get out of here -- here.\u201d He said, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know why you came here.\u201d\nHe said, \u201cWell [indecipherable] look after my father.\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d he said, \u201c[indecipherable]\nI\u2019m looking after your father, nothing happens to him. But see, I cannot stop these guys,\ntoo, what they\u2019re doing.\u201d They came from another city. They always sent in German,\nthey didn\u2019t use the same people from the same city, always from the next city, or so. And\nhe -- \u201cI cannot prevent any smashing of materials, but I will see to it that fath -- your\nfather isn\u2019t hurt. And by the way,\u201d he said, \u201cyou know your brother is in prison here.\u201d \u201cI\nknow.\u201d This was the son, the younger brother, who was li-living in the house with ma --\nmy grandfather, but had moved out [indecipherable] he got married. He was married to a\nChristian woman, whose brothers were Nazis, and asked her to divorce him under the\nNuremberg laws. And she refused. She said that in the good days she was with him, he\u2019s\n-- in the bad days were -- make a long story short, they went to -- with the help of a\nCatholic organization to Holland, which was, at that time, this was in -- this was in 1938 -\n- 30 -- \u00b039, beginning of \u201939. They went to a place in Holland, like a camp, but a Catholic\norganization was taking care of them, too. Moved them maybe to Brazil, or someplace in\nSouth America. And --",
        "Q: Will you tell me where you were during Kristallnacht, and what happened to you?",
        "A: I was at home, and nothing happened to me. I -- nobody came to our house. I went to\nmy school, I had to leave German school, because Jewish children could not be in the\nclassroom with the German children. And so I went to then, the new school, Jewish\nschool, one they installed in the back room of a synagogue, which was a Conservative\nsynagogue. And then I wanted to go to school, and see what happens, and somebody said,\n\u201cYour s -- your school is burning.\u201d Well, 1t was synagogue that was burnt, but the school\nwas in the synagogue. I wanted to take a look. Nobody bother me, some um -- most\npeople, I mean, didn\u2019t know I was Jewish, you know. And the incident there was\ninteresting. The Nazis put the thing -- this is a -- a [indecipherable] fire. And the -- the\nfire department showed up to put out the fire. And the -- not what the Nazis wanted, they\nwanted us to burn down, but they endangered, in many cases, the houses next to them,\nwhich were not Jewish houses. But -- and people protested, and so the fire department\nstanding by, in our case, had the water ready, and -- in case the flames would go out to\nthe side, to the other houses. And the police came, or was already there, in\n[indecipherable] and they said, \u201c\u201cWe want you to stop the burning, you endanger other\npeople\u2019s lives.\u201d And they said no, they going to burn down to the ground. So a policeman\ntrying to stop them, but they -- they couldn\u2019t, and the one policeman then went to a fire\nhose, which wa -- were -- were -- that were not in use, because they -- they want to burn\ndown, not put the fire -- and they only had them down for protection on the other homes.\nSo policeman took the hose, and started directing towards the synagogue. And one of the\nNazis, the Brown shirt came by, and with a dagger, cut the hose, so there wouldn\u2019t be no\nwater coming out, they quit. So that was my knowledge of the hol -- Crystal night. I\ndidn\u2019t --",
        "Q: Did you see that happening from where you were?",
        "A: I heard the discussion.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: I -- later on they told me what -- people that I knew, what happened, they were ta -- all\ntalking about there were conflict with the police and the Brown shirt. Yes, I -- I did -- I\ndidn\u2019t see the actual cutting, but I saw the argument between the SA and the police. And\nthe police was pretty decent, our town. I have other example on that. And so they told me\nto go home, which I did. And I passed several Jewish homes, and they were all the\nwindows smashed in, the furniture on the sidewalk, nothing ta -- I didn\u2019t see anybody get\nhurt or anything, but some people did get hurt, but in general, in our town, nobody got\nhurt.",
        "Q: Were you -- were you home with your mother that night? Mm-hm.",
        "A: And my father, like I said, he -- he left early in the morning to look after his father. So\nwe didn\u2019t know any -- was -- this was all about, and we could -- we could guess what this\nall about, but we didn\u2019t expect that. My father told us to stay home, just stay where we\nare. My grandparents were, on my mother\u2019s side, were also in the same town, about half a\nmile away. Nothing happened to them.",
        "Q: Was your family religious at all?",
        "A: Not my parents. My grandparents were. Not Orthodox, they were -- they had kosher at\nhome, but they didn\u2019t go to synagogue every [indecipherable] Saturday morning or\nFriday night. And my grandfather looked like a real Germanic type. He was blonde, had -\n- the hair he had left, had a big moustache, and he looked like a German peasant, maybe.\nAnd so he had a lot of friends who were not Jewish, and we had no -- no -- none in\nparticular [indecipherable] my family. There were other families who got beaten up,\nmany of them. Some of them because they [indecipherable] alone and they was enable,\ntook advantage of it, beat up a Jew, or smash his window. And in our place, the -- like I\nsaid, the police was pretty good. My uncle, my mother\u2019s brother, Neil, had been arrested\nCrystal night, and sent to Dachau concentration camp. He was also a decorated war\nveteran, he had the Iron Cross. He had -- he brought home from the war, his saber, which\nhe was allowed to, because of his rank, and he had the Iron Cross. So before 1 -- Cr-\nCrystal night, two policemen came to the -- to my grandparents home where he lived, he\nwas not married, and they said, \u201cWe have orders to pick up your saber, and your medals.\u201d\nHe questioned that. He said, \u201cWe are police, we are not Nazi party members. We have an\norder we have to carry out.\u201d Ma -- they were excusing the action. They didn\u2019t even want\nto do it, but they -- policemen had to do it. So my uncle said, \u201cOkay.\u201d He had a medal, he\ntook the medals, threw them on the floor, and, \u201c\u201cYou can also have the saber.\u2019 And he\nthrew the saber and broke the -- the blade. And he threw that on the floor to them. And\nthey were very apologetic about it, and, \u201cWe\u2019re just carrying out orders. We are sorry.\nIt\u2019s not our doing, but is our order.\u201d And they took -- and they took my great-grandfather,\nwhom I also knew. He got to be 96. He was also in the house, and he used to be a public\nschool teacher, and he had received for his work what they call the Hohnsellon medal.\nHohnsellon was the German Kaiser, of the Hohnsellon family. And he gave awards, and\nmedals out to people who are deserving, who did something for the state, or for the\ncountry. And he had that framed on the wall, the medal and certificate. And they said,\n\u201cBy the way, we have to take that, too.\u201d My uncle [indecipherable] military, but every\nJew -- Jews don\u2019t have the right to have medals any more. So, he took -- they took that,\ntoo. But they did no harm. So, to continue the story for my father. The police just took\nhim back to the police building, and the jail was attached to it, it was just a couple of\ncells. And the police chief said to my father, \u201cWant to see your brother?\u201d And they\nopened the door, and there are five Jews in there, men, his brother included. And they had\na -- they were playing cards. They had food in there, and they were -- you know what,\nthey were being nice to bi -- and he said -- he was [indecipherable], \u201cSay good-bye to\nyour brother, because frankly I don\u2019t know when you\u2019re going to see him again,\u201d this\npolice chief said. Well, they didn\u2019t think about Dachau, but that\u2019s where he went,\nDachau. And if my father would have been [indecipherable] he would have gone, too.\nBut, he -- the chief said, \u201cI don\u2019t have an arrest warrant for you here. They probably have\na [indecipherable] your hometown. So I have to make a call.\u201d And he called the chief in\nMitchiglumba, and he said, \u201cI have a,\u201d -- I think he said old friend of mine, apparently\n[indecipherable] and he didn\u2019t say, I have a Jew here by the name of Willner, and he an\nold friend of mine. \u201cI don\u2019t have an arrest warrant wi -- but he lives in your city. Would\n10\nyou check, please?\u201d He said, \u201cYes, he\u2019s on the list to be arrested.\u201d So the guy that was\nmy father\u2019s friend, he, \u201cOkay, I\u20191l send him back to you.\u201d Hung up the phone, and of\ncourse my father listened to all of this. And the chief said, \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what Siegfried.\nThe next bus is at 11 o\u2019clock, you will be on it, back to your home, and then you will\nreport to the police, which is what we agree [indecipherable] here.\u201d And he did like this --\nyour problem. So the other policeman knew, and --",
        "Q: He winked, yeah.",
        "A: He winked at my father. And to make a long story short, the next bus, 11 o\u2019clock, my\nfather thought he was being sent back out with a police escort to -- the chief said, \u201cGet on\nthe bus. Report to the chief when you get there.\u201d No police escort, or -- and my father, of\ncourse, didn\u2019t report to the police. He -- he went home first and said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to\nstay here, they going to start looking for me,\u201d and he [indecipherable]",
        "Q: I\u2019m going to interrupt you because I don\u2019t want to repeat all the stories that you\u2019ve\nalready told in the video interview. So, I wanted to just move on to the time of your\nliberation. And -- and you described in your videotaped interview about that, about how\nthat came about, and how you had been with your friends Mike Swab, and how you had\nbeen following the -- the sounds of the -- of the artillery fire, and -- and eventually\nbecame kind of caught up in a battle, and went over to the American side. Can you\ndescribe in some detail how -- how once you got over, and were -- and were joined with\nthe American army, what happened?\n1]",
        "A: Okay, we es -- we escaped, of course, from a transport of Langenstein concentration\ncamp, to -- we were going east. That I knew. I knew a couple [indecipherable] from a\nmap I had seen. I didn\u2019t have any maps. And Langenstein concentration camp was one\nthat was going to be a temporary camp for the building of tunnels, to produce the wheat\nto underground, because the factories were all bombed out by the ally. And Michael\nSwab, that\u2019s one of my best friends, and I describe Michael, how I met him in a camp.\nHis father was killed, and his brother-in-law. They were frozen to death. They came back\nfrom work and they had been told they did not perform properly, they were sabotaging\nGerman wer -- wer -- for these 150 germ -- 150 Dutch Jews, who had arrived at this small\ncamp, which was about 600 people, to repair railr -- railroads, and then -- so Mike\u2019s fa-\nfather and brother came back from work one day, and they were accused not having\nworked properly, and they s -- wanted to make example of them. They stood these people\nup in the middle of the winter, which 1s pretty bad in Poland, not like here, and they took\na fire hose, and hosed them down with cold water. Ordered them to stand, they couldn\u2019t\nrub themselves dry and warm, it was ice cold water. And to make a long story\n[indecipherable] by next morning they were -- most of them, they were dead. Mike\u2019s\nfather and brother-in-law, Morron. That\u2019s where we came -- there were f -- I spoke\nDutch, that was the other thing. I think I explained before why I -- how I came to speak\nDutch, I picked up a Dutch -- [indecipherable] Dutch was very inposit. So, when we\nemptied the camp, they had a new method, I thought. In the previous Death March, that\nwe had from Bleshammer to Roshosen, we marched everybody together, 4,000 some\n12\npeople that marched out. But there were other people came in from other camps, smaller\ncamps, so the -- Swallhallingpoint, which was our camp. And so, there were actually\nmore than 4,000, I didn\u2019t know that til after the war. All through my friend, Mizza\nKraning. And they decided, when we walked out of Langenstein, to walk out in groups of\n500, which was for better control, in case some people may escape. And there are 4,000\npeople coming, and -- which was good for us, too. Not every group had a police dog,\nGerman Shepherd, or had a lot of guards. Some of the guards were ol-older guys, older\nSS men, and they knew the war was finished, they lost. And so -- but, we didn\u2019t walk --\nwant to walk out, Mike and I, and we hid for awhile, and then we saw the Germans put\nup machine guns. I figured they\u2019re going to execute everybody in front of the camp.\nWell, they made a last appeal over the PA system, they said, \u201cThis 1s the last call,\neverybody get out of the back who 1s left, who is hiding. If you don\u2019t be marched out,\nyou will -- you know what\u2019s going to happen.\u201d So Michael and I decided we got up -- not\ndisappear, but in the final stand, sh-shoot out on the spot. We stayed there through some\ncases. We went to -- or came out of hiding, and there was a double wall in one of the\nbarracks, and we were loit the last group walking out, and we lucky we did, because I\nhave pictures from the v-video from the National Archives, that was taken on the camp,\nwe were in the middle, where the barracks were, the -- how do you call his? The\nappelleplatz in German, which was the -- just like soldiers have to be on the --",
        "Q: For -- for roll call?\n13",
        "A: Yeah, for roll call. The last roll call, they said otherwise they -- they get shot. So\nMichael and I decided we\u2019re going, that well escape from outside of [indecipherable]. All\nthat has been ah -- always our friend. So we wen -- walked out with the la -- a last group\nof 500, or so. And we decided that we must escape. Oh yeah, we joined in the group, four\nother young fellows who were mostly Dutch, there was one other guy there, who we had\nconfidence in, we knew each other. Mike knew them better than I did. And they accepted\nme, and we -- we had decided that we will, during the night, escape into three different\ndirection, two each. We did two each, because that\u2019s always better than being alone, for\none thing, give you more encouragement. And then also, when we escaped, six, two in\neach direction, one back, and one forward, or one to the side, or whatever, that when they\nstart firing, it is much harder for them to get all of them, if they all bunched together,\nrunning away. And that we would have a chance to come out alive, that somebody\u2019s 1s\nget -- going to get shot, and somebody may be lucky. And the -- Mike Swab and I were\nthe lucky ones. We -- there were shots fired at us, but maybe by one or two guys in the\ngroup.",
        "Q: What happened to the other four?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, frankly. They went in another direction. I assume, I cannot say, that they\nwere killed. They fired enough shots. And one thing I didn\u2019t mention, we escape, we had\nthe -- the -- the situation had to be proper -- prop -- had to be in such a way that they\ncouldn\u2019t follow us where -- where we were, didn\u2019t have the -- the personnel to do this.\nWe had just crossed a small bridge, and we knew that police dogs pick up the smell of an\n14\nescaping prisoner, or somebody else, particularly us, we smelt to high heaven. We were\nfull of lice, we -- w-we\u2019re walking skeleton. By then I\u2019m wa -- when I was weighed --\nweighted by American, 75 pounds when I was 18 years old. But we were healthy -- and\nMike\u2019s about the same. So okay, we decided we do this when -- I think the word is\npospicious. When the time is proper to leave. And the big thing that helped us was it was\na pretty dark night. They could not put on lights, the SS, to see who is running, or ma --\nbecause there were airplanes are overhead, Americans.\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "A: -- we had talked about this many times befo -- before our escape. We thought it would\nbe good to escape the dog or dogs, if we swam through a river, because they couldn\u2019t\npick up the smell in the water. And -- or, 1n case there was no water, they would go after\nthe prisoner, then bite them, go for their throat. And then by their barking, attract the\nguards, help them finish the job. So, when we crossed the bridge, for awhile, our luck\nwas on our side. We knew where the river was, we could just cross the bridge, but -- and\nthere were planes overhead, so we knew they couldn\u2019t put any searchlights on. And we\nwere told -- we were marching ranks of four, two to one side, and two to the other side\nsumweech. And the SS were -- they went a little bit further out, and we got -- then they\u2019re\ngoing to hit just as much as we would if they stayed there. And so here we were across\nthe bridge, and we said, \u201cNow.\u201d We all took off, and Mike and I, we | -- took off for the\nriver, because we didn\u2019t know they were planning before, who was going to be on the\n15\nriver side, who was going to be other way. Michael and I [indecipherable] and running\nthe other way, but running the river way. And we also didn\u2019t know who could swim.\nWell, we talked about it, and some guys were too weak to swim. And Mike and I could\nswim, which was no problem. And the river was a tiny little thing, but enough to get the\ndog off our back. And not dogs, and -- one dog. So we got into the water, which was of\ncourse, ice cold, and the dog got Mike in the leg, but we -- we want to strangle the dog.\nWe decided the dog is not as -- he\u2019s ferocious, but makes a lot of noise, and their dogs --\nwe have here the police department, who will also attack somebody, but not for the\nthroat, like these dogs were trained for us. And well, to make a long story short, it wasn\u2019t\n[indecipherable] the guy called off -- the guy in charge of -- I guess a group of 500, there\nwere two whistle blows, and I think that meant recall, I don\u2019t know, I think it meant\nrecall, because the dog immediately left us, and also ran back. We thought we were going\nto kill the dog and -- and -- because I know from doing this after the Holocaust, a dog that\nattacks you, even German Shepherd, and you get to the throat, and you get -- cut him off\nhis air, he cannot -- he may be able to bite you, but he\u2019ll tear into you everywhere, and\nthat\u2019s what we had thought we would have to do, but he was recall, and we went through\nthe water on the other side. And then made a U-turn, sort of through the back\n[indecipherable] you fear somebody\u2019s going to come across the bridge, and we don\u2019t\nwant to be here. And could hear at night better. Also if maybe they made a U-turn, too,\nand we meet head to head. So where to prevent all that? Well, we draw a split second\n16\ndecision, and well, we went and we saw a couple of f-farms -- farmhouses. I said, \u201cWe\ngot to get into one of those farmhouses, not wake up the inhabitants, and\u201d --",
        "Q: Hold on one second.",
        "A: -- so we hid in a potato cellar of the house, which was which was -- faces to the\noutside, and we s -- ate raw potatoes, and we left the house again because didn\u2019t -- we\ndidn\u2019t want to be discovered by the farmer. So we only travel at -- at night, in the daytime\nwe hid in bushes, to watch the sound of the artillery, we hear sounds of the arti -- it was\ncoming from, we figure out, the front line. And it was towards the west. There, I\n[indecipherable]. So, but we got a little bit confused, we didn\u2019t know, we didn\u2019t care\nwhere we were, as long as we stayed away from these -- so we hit one more time, and\nnear t -- near a village, outside, and we heard tanks rumbling. We were -- it must be the\nAmericans. We didn\u2019t see one German tank in there. We saw soldiers far away. And we\nsaid we have to do everything to get as fast as we can towards them. So when we -- one\nmorning, in the early morning, there were German old guys, and young guys, what they\ncall the li -- not li [indecipherable] volksdune, which were the guys that they got back in\nthe service, too old to be a soldier the front, or too young. And they were lay -- laying --\nlying in holes, real -- two guys per hole, or under vilv. We were afraid the American\ntanks were coming through, like as if they were not the regular soldiers, but they were\ncalled up again to serve. Well, how do we get past these guys, dincorner? Like I said, it\nwas very dark in there. And we listened first, and we figure out there\u2019s one hole there,\nand one hole further, but enough in the middle to crawl through. They can fire at us, but it\n17\nlooks as don\u2019t come out [indecipherable]. Didn\u2019t know the enemy\u2019s right across the field.\nAnd they wouldn\u2019t fire a bazooka or a det at the German weapon against tanks, which we\ncall a bazooka. And -- so I said -- we s -- we decide to crawl [indecipherable], and the --\nall of a sudden it got light -- oh no, be-before you -- you got through, this German called\non us, and we gave the password, and he called loud enough so you could -- everybody\ncould hear, there was -- it was quiet for awhile. There was nobody firing, it was a wait.\nAnd -- and he 1 -- asked for the password, and of course, didn\u2019t have the pas -- I said,\n\u201cHell mund.\u201d Shut up, I said. This -- the German army patrol, they call it the patrol. My\nGerman was good, you know, and I had heard command given before. Michael\n[indecipherable] me [inaudible] he spoke [indecipherable] German, but not that good. So\nI made up something, I said, \u201cShut up,\u201d to the German reconnaissance patrol. And he\nsaid, \u201cBut the password.\u201d I -- I -- this was all calling, ontaw, I didn\u2019t even see the guy, I\nknew he was in [inaudible] and I said, \u201cWe are from the -- I said some,\u201d -- I -- I -- I\nmentioned Germany. I don\u2019t remember what I said, I made up a unit, and then -- so I\napparently didn\u2019t get the password, but we\u2019re here for the same thing, we want to find out\nwho is front of us. And we kept crawling, we just didn\u2019t bother, and he didn\u2019t say\nanything. So, all of a sudden, it was like these guys were behind us, and we saw tanks,\nmaybe five time as far as the tree on the other side of the street.",
        "Q: Okay, so the tree 1s probably about 30 feet away?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: So maybe 80 feet?\n18",
        "A: So before that moved up in the night, and sit still.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Because they were going to move early in the morning, and -- which they did, when it\nwas light, and they had been ordered to move up, relieve another unit, and there was 16\nor 17 tanks. One company, a thir -- a third armored division. 32\" armored regiment. And\nwhen we saw the first American tank switch on the mo -- the engine, they started to\nmove, Mike and I came out with our hands up. We were the only people around that they\ncould see. And the moment we did that, they all stopped, and waited for the command of\nthe commanding officer, what they should do. [indecipherable]. Well, a couple of guys\njumped off the tanks, and we showed the number on our arm, and they looked at us,\nwe're full of lice, skeleton, he said, \u201cOkay.\u201d He jump on the tank. He as -- he said,\n\u201cWe're going to take you along. [indecipherable] this village fine.\u201d Okay. \u201cWhere are the\nguys with the panzerfow, or the bazooka?\u201d We said, \u201cThere are two holes hide behind\nthat, because we sneaked right through the middle.\u201d So a German -- a American who\nspoke German more or less fluently, a sergeant came up, and he had a public address\nsystem, was [indecipherable] thing. He said -- he said, \u201c\u201cWe know where you are, that\nyou \u2019ve been ordered to defend the village, but we just found out from two,\u201d -- he didn\u2019t\nsay [indecipherable] we came, \u201cwho have just come through there, who knows where\nyour positions are. We give you five minutes. Come out with a white flag, or we going to\nblast your village to pieces.\u201d And they gave them five minutes, and the tanks started\nforward, and the Germans came out with their hands up, a couple dozen all along the\n19\nvillage. And that was about all. They took them prisoner, but I don\u2019t think th -- at least\nwe didn\u2019t keep them. They were turned over to some other Americans, who came by,\nwho were supposed to take them to a pr -- a [indecipherable] or something. I guess --\nthey\u2019re all old guys, and young kids, six -- 15 - 16. And then so, we identified us, and\nthen we come -- the commander came, first lieutenant, and Lieutenant Hovlent is still\nalive today, a very nice, religious man, who gave permission then to -- that we stay with\nthem, that we didn\u2019t know where to go, and maybe show them where some other\nprisoners would be hidden, or liberated. That\u2019s why they sent the radio out, and also they\nwere giving wh -- well, I told them that the camp 1s probably about so many miles from\nhere, within a radius, if they should dispatch a column in their camp. And it had now --\nanother unit already got there and found the camp. Okay, so they went to the next village,\nand it was night -- evening, [indecipherable] to stay here, I -- that\u2019s where we going to\nstay. We thought they were going [indecipherable]. \u201cYou stay with us, you will sleep like\nus, you throw some Germans out of their homes, and they can go and find some friends,\nsleep with them. But we want a good, nice, warm place. And you can go with us.\u201d And\nLieutenant Hovlent, and his executive officer, who unfortunately, died recently -- because\nhe knew more about -- I coming to another story later on, than Lieutenant Hovlent. He --\nhe set up to a kitchen [indecipherable], about 150 soldiers, in a company with 70 tank,\nand, \u201cYou stay with the kitchen. When they sleep, you want to eat.\u201d Had to come to the\nkitchen to eat, but the kitchen [indecipherable] there. So [indecipherable], and he made\n20\nannouncement that these three young boys, [indecipherable] the kitchen, they can go in\nany time they -- they want to, and eat. Okay.",
        "Q: Did you speak any English?",
        "A: Yes. Mike also, though not -- not very well, but like I said, one sergeant spoke\nGerman, and there was a Jewish soldier, too.",
        "Q: Do you remember what you talked about with some of these young American\nsoldiers?",
        "A: That we came from a concentration camp. They didn\u2019t know about the camp, but they\n[indecipherable] when they heard from other guys, and I guess in their u -- papers, the\njournal they kept, yeah, the military journal the commanding officer keeps, what they did\ntoday, what they did yesterday, how much ammunition they have left, how many guys\nwent sick, and [indecipherable]. So we were -- spoke enough English to [inaudible], and\nLieutenant Hovlent never spoke very much, he still doesn\u2019t. He was a very religious guy.\nToward the fraternization phase, when the war was over, six months later, that peace was\nsigned. A lot of American, there was a -- not the law, but a rule, not to fraternize with the\nGerman, and it was more or less an -- an order, not to go out with German girls, because\n[indecipherable] available. And they wanted food, which the soldiers gave them, and they\ngot sex in return. But some of them -- many of the soldiers did, but Lieutenant Hovlent\nnever talked to a German, never touched a girl. And there was one more guy with them,\nHansen, who was of German descent, parents spoke German at home. He knew fluent\nGerman. He was in the kitchen with us. He slept with us. And I said one day to him,\n21\n\u201cNick, you told me you have German descent, your parents spoke German at home, do\nyou speak German?\u201d He ne -- he said, \u201cYes, fluently.\u201d \u201cAnd then why don\u2019t you speak\nwith some of them? Why do you make it difficult?\u201d He said, \u201cAfter what I -- you boys\ntold me, I\u2019m not proud to be of German descent, and I decided I\u2019m not going to speak any\nGerman.\u201d And he kept his word, he never spoke [indecipherable] he lives in New Jersey,\nNick Hansen, and like I said Lieutenant Hovlent was a very religious guy. He lives in\nMinnesota today. He has other children. His wife, unfortunately, has Parkinson\u2019s, too, so\nwe have another thing in common. But I lost Lieutenant Hovlent\u2019s contact one time when\nhe moved, and for years I didn\u2019t talk to him, or call him couple times a year. But my wife\nwent on the computer one day, and through research, she found him. And this was a\ncouple of years ago. And I call him up again, and since that time we\u2019re calling each other\nonce a month.",
        "Q: Were you given any work to do with the kitchen crew?",
        "A: No. Our work consisted of just watching them prepare the food and eat. And I picked\nup 50 pounds in three months, which was actually a danger, because a lot of prisoners\ndied from overeating, and also, I forgot to mention, one of the requirements to stay with\nthem was that we go to the battalion surgeon, to the doctor [indecipherable] and get ourse\n-- self examined, see that we don\u2019t carry any infectious diseases, the protection of\n[indecipherable] soldier. And well, we got examined by a doctor, and he decided we\ndon\u2019t have any infectious diseases. We are full -- we are full of lice, we have to get rid of\nthem immediately, so nobody else -- and about food he didn\u2019t say, he said they got to be -\n22\n- be fattened a little bit. He -- he -- th-they -- they weighed us, and that\u2019s why I knew five\n-- 75 pounds. And they knew that we were just skeletons, but healthy. So, we stayed with\nthe kitchen crew, and then they got orders to move onto another village, another va -- and\nthe same thing happened again, they soja -- oh yeah, I forgot. The first thing they did\nafter they came from the doctor is two soldiers [indecipherable] escort a -- to a rel -- toa\nGerman house. The woman\u2019s husband was fighting somewhere in Russia, and she was\nthere with one child. And he said, \u201cWell, we putting these two boys in your house, and --\nwhere\u2019s your husband?\u201d She said, \u201cIn Russia. Maybe he\u2019s dead,\u201d she said. \u201cWell,\u201d he\nsaid, \u201chow big was your husband, how tall?\u201d \u201cSmall, like I am.\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d he said, \u201cthese\ntwo men here are small, too. Show them the clothes that you had for your husband.\u201d\nWent into closet, and take -- pick out some clothes, and he -- they said, \u201cYou going to\nstay temporarily in this house, til you\u2019ve been deloused, you got some clothing and pick\nout what you want. And then when you finish bathing, we want to come for scout, we\ngoing to go leave you now here, and we come back with a medical team.\u201d\n[indecipherable] And the woman cried, and cried. We weren\u2019t -- we weren\u2019t going to do\nany harm to her, but she thought them were [indecipherable] come take her house away,\nand -- which -- so she had a big pot -- pot -- a big vat, where she cooked the food for the\ncows, and for the other animals, and she was taking care of all the thing. The thing was,\nalmost same size like the company -- [indecipherable] company has for cooking their\nfood for the Soviets, in big, round thing. A tub. And so she had one of those things in the\n-- where the cows are, in the --\n23",
        "Q: In the barn?",
        "A: Where the -- barn. And she asked, \u201cIs this big enough?\u201d I said, \u201cThat\u2019s good, we can\nboth get in there.\u201d [indecipherable] big enough, [indecipherable] was clean, you know,\nbut there were now smell of some food or something. The [indecipherable] smell was\nmaking us sick, not the -- not the [indecipherable] smelling food sometime, because we\nhad been -- we had -- the food that we had eaten for -- for a long time was just bread,\nmainly, and some ba -- bayjay -- what\u2019s the -- what cows eat they cooked in there, and\nthey gave them, and so on. Th-they this big, and not bir -- [indecipherable] is the German\nname. [indecipherable]. Let me think.",
        "Q: Beets, or --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Beets, beets. They\u2019re special beets for animals, okay, but people can eat them, too,\nwhen you\u2019re hungry, you can cook them, the beet. And we used to occasionally steal\nthem from the fields we were working nearby. And so -- and the woman said we going to\nstay there, and we hadn\u2019t eaten dinner yet, she\u2019Il cook for us, too. I didn\u2019t know, and\nreally [indecipherable] back too. But that\u2019s what they wanted us, to stay overnight there,\nto get rid of all that [indecipherable] clothing that was full of lice. When I say full, my\nclothing must have been crawling with a couple of hundred lice, and [indecipherable],\nand we were picking up [indecipherable] but -- by having so many -- well, needless to\nsay, we got rid of all our clothes, we went in the tub, she made hot water.\n24\n[indecipherable] by that time these guys came with DDT, or something, and all\n[indecipherable]. And he said, \u201cWe gotta shave your hair once more.\u201d Our hair was short,\nbut had grown back already, little bit. We don\u2019t want there to be any eggs, or anything\nlike that. We said okay. And so we stayed all night. Next day we moved out, with the\n[indecipherable] -- and oh, when we got back to the kitchen, they said, \u201cLieutenant\nHovlent was here, he left some clothes for you.\u201d There was a pile on the floor. Uniforms,\nAmerican uniforms. You going to stay with us, right? Yes. [indecipherable]. He put some\nclean belted uniforms on, and no rank on it, because we didn\u2019t have any rank, we were\nnot in the army. And just a uniform underwear, [indecipherable]. So we looked like them,\nto make a long story short, we stayed six months with them. The war was over, but was,\nyou know, we got [indecipherable] sign the armistice, so we never --",
        "Q: You stayed -- you stayed with them how long after the war was actually over?",
        "A: Six months.",
        "Q: Six months.",
        "A: Okay. [indecipherable] the big story which about DP camps, that\u2019s where most people\nwent. But before I come to that, we stayed with them for so long, and we gained weight,\nwe were healthy again, spoke better English, and then they talked to us, they said, \u201cWell,\nwhat are you going to do, we\u2019re going to return to the United States, pretty soon, and we\nhad you here, and you had -- you enjoyed us, we enjoyed you.\u201d And well, I said, \u201cI will\ngo back to Brussels, where I have a sister of my mother living, was married to a Catholic.\nShe was the one that sent the cookies to my father, and she\u2019s probably still there,\u201d\n25\nbecause in the beginning they didn\u2019t touch mixed marriages in foreign countries. They\nwere coming there late August, decided when they have time to do it, but there was a war\ngoing on, that came first. And so none of the mixed marriages they didn\u2019t bother with\nright away. So, I said, \u201cI\u2019m going back to Brussels because all of my c -- my family\nagreed that\u2019s where we going to meet, at my aunts.\u201d And Mike said, \u201cWell, I know my\nfather\u2019s dead, and my brother-in-law. I don\u2019t know anything about my mother and my\nsister. I\u2019m going back to Amsterdam.\u201d So Lieutenant Hovlent said, \u201cWell, suppose you\ndon\u2019t find anybody there, what are you going to do then?\u201d [indecipherable] yeah, he said,\n\u201cYou were happy here, a lot of things are still mixed up. [indecipherable], after the war\nyou can stay with us as long as you wish, til we return to the United States. But we may\nstay here for a couple of years, we don\u2019t know.\u201d So we said fine. So they made out phony\npapers, military orders, with my real name on them, and for Mike Swab. No -- no rank on\nthere, not private or anything, and say Eddie Willner is traveling to Brussels, Belgium by\ntrain, by orders of colonel so and so. [indecipherable]",
        "Q: What was your -- I\u2019m sorry, go ahead.",
        "A: And I went to Brussels --",
        "Q: Okay, before you talk about being in -- in Brussels, what was your impression of the\nUnited States, by that point?",
        "A: Oh, we didn\u2019t know much about the United States, they -- except the military. They\nwere great, they were enthused, they -- everybody tries to help out every, but these are\nthe people that [indecipherable]. There\u2019s another, unfortunately he is dead, too, I mean I\n26\nfound out an address, my wife did research at the computer, Brady Laird was a mess\nsergeant, he was a nice guy, and then I found his -- he sent me a letter, he said he never\nmarried, and the next time I wrote a letter to him, 1t came back. He had died. And so --\nBrady [indecipherable], and -- and the -- the other guys we made friends with were a\ncouple of guys, for various reasons. And one big Texan, he was huge, I have picture, he\nwas the largest man in the company, and when he stood with the arms stretch out, Mike\nand I were standing under his arms. I have an picture of that. He didn\u2019t fit into a tank, he\nwas so big.",
        "Q: You still have pictures of these times?",
        "A: Yeah. And I -- we caught a couple of Nazis then, that -- the German population turned\nin some guys who are back, and our -- had to undress them, and [indecipherable] the\nuniform and put in some prisoner\u2019s uniform, and turn over to German police. And I even\nput on the German uniform, which I think fitted me, and got a photo of my hands up, and\nboots on the -- [indecipherable] fun with the company. We didn\u2019t have any -- any duties,\nor any work, although we participate a little bit in the kitchen [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Do you remember what your hopes and -- and dreams were at that point?",
        "A: My -- well, my hopes were to find my mother, and father, and -- who knew I was\nthere, and find other member of the family, and to -- I had no plans, except go to\nBrussels, and maybe walk back to Germany, my hometown, and find my grandfather,\n[indecipherable] who had been sent to Theresienstadt, and who I don\u2019t bel -- I just found\nout recently that he died in 1944. How could an old man, whose 80 years old, last that\n27\nlong in [indecipherable]? I don\u2019t understand. I intend to check into it, he -- he was\nGerman [indecipherable] but he was a tough old cookie, but still being that way, he --\nhow an old man survived that long, and die from hunger, like some other. In\nTheresienstadt, there was no gas chamber, they managed -- they shot some people, in the\nmass of people. There were no max -- mass executions there because Hitler used as a\nshowcase for the Red Cross, and for international. And my wife and I went to\nTheresienstadt, and that\u2019s how we went to the room where my gr-grandfather lived. But I\ndidn\u2019t know at that time that he lived three years, and he had been thrown in a mass grave\nthere, that -- with [indecipherable] but not gas chamber. When somebody died they didn\u2019t\ndo away with the body, you saw that. Bu with the --",

        "Q: This is tape number two, side A, of an interview with Eddie Willner. You were just\nabout to talk about going to Belgium right after the war, and ad -- looking for your\nfamily. And what happened when you -- how did you get there?",
        "A: By -- I got there by train, and with travel orders from the American army, which was\nillegal, but nobody questioned, I went. And Mike Swab went to Amsterdam, he didn\u2019t\nfind anybody from his family, so he went back to the Third Armored Division, and there\nwas -- and [indecipherable] where I don\u2019t find anybody. I come back and\n[indecipherable]",

        "A: Mike [indecipherable] got adopted by a soldier from the company, and got that way to\nthe United States. And I came back to Belgium, I put in my papers, I found a sponsor,\nand I had to wait for my affidavit to come in -- my paper. And I was finally -- I finally\nleft the United States, in December, \u201947.",
        "Q: Did it surprise you that the American soldiers were so kind to you, and so concerned\nabout you? Did you question why they were?",
        "A: Yes, in a way I did, but I remember it made me so comfortable. The only -- frankly,\nI\u2019m sorry to say, the only guy that made me uncomfortable was a Jewish guy in the unit,\nbecause not what he did towards us or anything, 1t was the way he behaved. We came out\nof an anti-Semitic world, or group, and we -- myself -- we behaved, before we became\nprisoners, while we were prisoners, in a way that normal -- but em -- let me say I didn\u2019t\n29\nfin -- I hate to say this, cause it sounds like prejudice, but it isn\u2019t. Jews from eastern\nEurope are different Jews from western Europe, because they grew up in ghettos, the\neastern European, the -- the western u -- was integrated, like my family was. I didn\u2019t\nknow that I was Jewish until [indecipherable] I didn\u2019t know I was Jewish, I went to\nsynagogue, but it never concerned me, never gave me a problem. And then came the Jews\nfrom the ghettos, and with the pious, and other things, and I was in the impression, the\nway the Nazis made us look bad, the Jews, they said all Jews are merchants, or they get\nthe money out of pocket of a -- questioned the ma --[indecipherable]. I found out that\nsome of the guys who came from Poland, because of their surroundings, were different\npeople. And I look at them differently, just like the Germans -- the non-Jewish people\nlooked at Germans who -- or who are Jewish, and [indecipherable] they said they like us.\nWhereas in Poland, because living conditions in Poland said these are not\n[indecipherable] Jews, or whatever, they\u2019re different. But in -- in the American army, the\none Jew that I met in the company was not a nice guy, to start with, and nothing to do\nwith being Jewish, but he did some of the things that Jews were oft accused of. He tried\nto make money, and the way he did it, he gambled with soldiers, he took the money out\nof their pocket. I\u2019m not saying that non-Jews don\u2019t do that, but I was a little bit more\naware of things -- not to be criticized because I -- whatever I do is -- as a money business,\nor whatever. I was not in a position to anyway, but -- but there were things this guy did,\nand had w -- he won quite a bit of money, had already done this on the way over, on the\nship, had made thousands of dollars. And so I -- the others were [indecipherable] and\n30\nthey saw this, too. And they saw that we didn\u2019t associate very much with him, unless he\nassociated with us, he was a -- and he was from New York. He was what you might call a\nghetto type. Now, New York the ghetto, too. So New York Jews, I -- I -- I when people\nask me where you from, some people think I\u2019m from New York, cause I pick up a little\naccent from the three months I was there. And -- and so I wa -- I wasn\u2019t very proud of\nhim, he did a lot of things that didn\u2019t make me proud to be a Jew, or something I could --\nyou could say. I was ashamed for him. And so your answer to your question that the\nAmerican were nice, yes, they -- they were nice, I found this guy Hansen, didn\u2019t speak\nGerman because he -- he felt very badly about, from a moral viewpoint that this happened\nby his former people that he came from. And he didn\u2019t like that. Like Lieutenant Hovlent\nwas -- I found out after the war, was very religious, that\u2019s why he behaved that way, and\nthe guys also, I -- I compare notes with many people, but soldiers behave different in war\n-- in the war [indecipherable] conditions. Like the villages we were in, guys thought\nabout taking the women, maybe the husband wasn\u2019t there, and didn\u2019t make any\ndifference to them, and [indecipherable] it didn\u2019t happen our unit, not that anybody got\ncaught, but -- but the guy that I don\u2019t -- didn\u2019t like, he would have been capable of doing\nsuch a thing. He tried it one time, and I -- we told him, Mike and I, sta -- stop. He came to\nthe [indecipherable], I told you about that farm woman, that made the hot water for us.\nHe wanted to go to bed with her, and he put his weapon on the table like -- like a threat. I\n-- and, \u201cLouie, don\u2019t do that. I don\u2019t want to be a part of this. I had my problems with the\nGermans. I -- I do-don\u2019t do this because I love the Nazis, or that, but this 1s a human\n31\nbeing, don\u2019t do this. There\u2019s no -- this woman is not a -- walk around in uniform with the\nNazis, tha -- she is just plain farm woman, and her husband\u2019s at the front because he was\nordered that way. And you don\u2019t do this, be -- how would you come a soldier into your\nhome?\u201d And he ever -- absolutely had been drinking too. And we told him that he better\ngo home to his home. And he kept on, and we took away his rifle, because we thought he\nmight -- not do anything to us, but [indecipherable] well, and we just [indecipherable]\nthat he was the only one that we knew -- there may have been another guy was Jewish,\nbut -- but we had good experiences too, after, and -- with Jews, and non-Jews. But he\ngave me a bitter taste in the mouth, and I -- he got married, and later had kids, I called\nhim, and [indecipherable] but I never went to visit him, I just talked to him on the phone,\nyou know. And the guys was nice to us, why, I -- well, basically because what we had\nendured. And there were many, and they\u2019d seen pictures in the paper, and read about it.\nSo they probably felt a little sorry for us, but we didn\u2019t feel sorry for ourselves, so there\nwas no problem. We weren\u2019t -- we were treated okay, like men, and -- and there were\ntalks about them, we\u2019ll find a way -- they want to go to the United States, which Michael\ndid. So [indecipherable] many nice people there, aga -- or say that you thought the\nAmericans were nice. And we found out that a lot of them were of different background,\nlike Louie was one, then we found Irish Catholic, and we found all kinds of religions.\nAnd maybe because some guys were religious, or believers, that\u2019s why they were nice.\nAnd people were not so nice. Cannot say that they were not religious, but they -- th-they -\n- people like [indecipherable] that I said about Jews now, I [indecipherable] for the other\n32\nPoles too, who were not Jews, we had many experiences with them, too. Some of them\nwere worse than the Germans, some of them were in guards, or were [indecipherable |\nfrom the area, were sometime with Germany, and sometimes not. And when we had\nPoles as supervisors for our work, they beat us like the SS did. So, I cannot make\nstatement, all American are nice, or all are bad, or Jews, or whatever. And -- or Italians\nare a certain way. Yeah, I think that it\u2019s -- it -- it\u2019s [indecipherable], and we found out\nvery early that we didn\u2019t -- like Nick Hansen was German [indecipherable]. I disagreed\nwith him, I said, \u201cTalk to these people, not all of them are bad. If all of them had been\nbad, I wouldn\u2019t be here today. There were some good ones.\u201d But I -- my experience has\nbeen talking to people -- Americans, maybe Jewish people savay, that those who were not\nin the camps, hate the Germans more than the wa -- than the ones who were in the camp.\nThat\u2019s an unusual thing. Because they say all Germans are bad, some of them are -- all --\nall the Nazis are, they make -- don\u2019t differentiate be -- no Nazis. And so I saw Poles who\n-- that were very bad, and who are -- had German SS, and some of the Poles, and know,\nyou find bad and good everywhere, but being good, and being able to do good, also had\nsomething to do with material things. United States is a rich country. We had soldier\nchocolate there, had everything to eat. And it\u2019s easy to be a good guy sometimes, when\nyou have a lot of things, if that\u2019s what needed, bread, or something to eat, be hungry. And\nthen somebody -- the -- the person I feel is sometimes really good, a real great person,\nwhen they don\u2019t have much, and then give away something. And right now, I did pretty\nwell in life, professionally. I worked hard, and I -- I\u2019m glad I\u2019m not dependent on\n33\nGerman government because I came out sick for the rest of my life, and get a small\npension. The business that\u2019s going on now in getting back for the Jews, the -- some of the\nthings that they owned, paintings, or getting pension, because they -- bec -- like Social\nSecurity, they say if you worked as slave labor, but -- but the companies that that used\nyour slave labor should pay you compensation. I filed for it, I didn\u2019t want to. My wife did\nfor me, I sign it, because I -- I certainly earned it, and I yi -- I -- I know -- I know I wor --\nworked for what German companies, but I said they should have given it -- most people\nare dead already -- right after the war, and they\u2019re -- they\u2019re waiting so long til they\u2019re --\nno -- not many left any more. So when the money comes, I'll take it, but I am not going\nto use it for myself, I\u2019m going to give it away. To my wife, who has been good to me, can\ndo whatever she wants, and some percentage to a good cause, not necessarily a Jewish\ngood cause. In my donations, I include the others as well as Jews. And I don\u2019t need their\nmoney, and I -- I tell you, I\u2019m torn from the experience that really upset me. I got myself\nexamined by Germany, to file for [indecipherable] you know what the [indecipherable]\nis? Making [indecipherable], and normally you do that if you have a -- something happen\nto you, and you get -- you need medi -- medical help for your life, and the Germans pay\nfor it, some extent. Well, number one, I went in the army, for various reasons, to give\nsomething back to this country, as a civil service employee, in the army now, in the army,\nalso as a volunteer. And like I said, I got exa-examined, and they said to me, some\npeople, \u201cYeah, but you -- you act like a -- like the strong guy, you\u2019re a military officer.\u201d\nHe -- some -- some people said, \u201cYou don\u2019t look sick to me.\u201d And I said, \u201cI\u2019m not, I,\u201d --\n34\nbut -- but when you go in the -- the Germans, you got to tell them you -- you suffer. I\ndidn\u2019t. That\u2019s ridiculous. I\u2019m not suffering, I\u2019m happy, I don\u2019t need them, and -- but I did\nget myself examined, and they didn\u2019t pass the law, whether you have something or not,\nyou get the minimum, if you have been one year in a camp, or more. So -- but then they\ncame up with something else, not -- couple of years ago, which is like Social Security,\nsay they worked, but they didn\u2019t pay in, but we owe it to them. We didn\u2019t pay them, si --\nthey came out with German Social Security, and they sent me a letter, and they said,\n\u201cYes, you entitled that, but you must pay in the basic sum, so we can start 1n to -- to make\nit So many quarters, you don\u2019t have enough.\u201d Or whatever, I -- I [indecipherable]. So I\ndid that, and I figure I earned that. And they said, \u201cIn your -- with your background, you\ngot yourself education after the war, which we consider college education,\n[indecipherable] military [indecipherable], and you -- so -- so you entitled to it. Who are\nyou -- did you work for?\u201d And I did say it, and send the papers in. And then they said,\n\u201cYou got to get this exam done by a doctor in Washing, who 1s a confidential\u201d -- not --\nwhat do you call it, not confidential, who do it confidentially for the German embassy. I\nwent to see the doctor, was a German [indecipherable] in Washing, who had been taken\nprisoner in Africa, by Rommel, Africa corps. No, he was in Africa, but he was taken\nprisoner by the British. I start undressing for him to examine me, he said, \u201cWe\u2019re the\nsame age.\u201d And, \u201cYou were in a concentration camp?\u201d \u201cYeah.\u201d \u201cOh yeah,\u201d he say, \u201cyou\nhave a number.\u201d And then I took all my clothes off, he said, \u201cYou look better than I do,\nphysically.\u201d Whatever that meant, and [indecipherable] would see that he was going to\n35\ngive me negative, say this guy\u2019s in perfect shape, he [indecipherable] a mark on him.\nWell, I have a mark here.",
        "Q: You have a scar on the back of your head.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: And --",
        "Q: How did you get that scar?",
        "A: Well, that was from a big shot in the camps, and they took some guys for example,\nthey fired, and they going to liquidate us, an example. And I came out I think I have it on\nthe tape. We were left for dead, and the -- well they told me to use that, but the only thing\nI -- I was disqualified from the U.S. Army after one parachute jump. They told me that I\nshould not jump, I am not going to be a jump bump -- this is a good thing to do if you --\nif you [indecipherable] to jump, y-yo -- to show you got courage, to jump out an air-\nairplane. So the young officers all did it, I want to do it, too. And by the way, my\nchildren, [indecipherable] five out of six are par-parachutists. So, they had to do what the\nold man couldn\u2019t do. But anyway, then, so this Social Security from Germany, the guy,\nhe -- I thought he is going to send me a confidential report. He send it to the embassy. I\ndidn\u2019t see what he wrote, but he wrote nothing good for me that was in my favor, and\nnevertheless -- well, he probably was a Nazi, or anti-Semite. I don\u2019t know what he -- I\nhad that feeling all along, that he thought I was getting something for nothing, and -- and\nI didn\u2019t, you know, I was entitled to it. So anyway, when he came out, they made a\n36\nruling. After checking what could I have been, if I had, under normal circumstance, not in\na concentration camp, not having to go 1n the army to make a living, and to -- what could\nI have been today? They gave a wide -- well, they gave me a high category, officer in the\narmy alone, that the same thing, had went to college, or you become a -- a teacher, you\nhave to have a certain intelligence, and they told me they going to give me a high rating\nin Social Security, but in that case, if I want a higher -- rating higher income, I have to\npay them anyswhere between 20 and 40,000 dollar, whatever I choose of categories. It is\nnot well known, but the reason was -- and if I do not choose the high income, the lowest\none is you pay in 2,000 dollars, and you get [indecipherable] income when you\u2019re 65.\nWell, we had some friends in German embassy, and some other people [indecipherable].\nAnd there is Leo, [indecipherable] language when they have the German, and this guy\nwas the German finantha a -- finance attach\u00e9 at the embassy here. And -- and he said\nwhat -- any -- I said, if I had 20,000 dollar, 40,000 dollar, I -- I\u2019d rather invest it in here,\nin this country. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to be Germany to-tomorrow, but I\u2019m not going\nto give them any money. I don\u2019t have that money to spare, and I -- it just didn\u2019t feel good\nabout it. But the mistake I made [indecipherable]. So I -- I gave them 2,000 dollars. They\nadvised me I should get my foot into the door, I\u2019m entitled to it [indecipherable] like\nthose thing, but to -- to give to the la -- and then they give me small sum. Well, they came\nout with a small sum which was so insulting that I immediate -- I -- I didn\u2019t get upset\nvery often about things I -- they\u2019re sending me every month a check, they have been for\nthree, four years now, for 46 dollars. I think that\u2019s an insult for somebody who spent\n37\nthree years in a concentration camp. And that becau -- now, if I would have given them\n40,000 dollars, I\u2019m probably -- I don\u2019t know how much, I\u2019d probably get a thousand\ndollar a month income. I didn\u2019t do that. Well, I -- I would have liked to have that kind of\nmoney coming in, but I -- I -- I don\u2019t, and I do very well without them. But the small\ncheck is an insult, I think, for anybody, not because I [indecipherable]. I -- I -- I -- every\ntime I see that they have money come in -- so --",
        "Q: Did you feel any hatred or -- towards the Germans right after the war, or desire for\nrevenge at all?",
        "A: No. When it comes to revenge, my friend Mike Swab tried some revenge, and I\nstopped him, because revenge is good for people who maybe you know did something\nbad to your family, or to -- killed people now -- SS, particularly. I feel -- felt that -- I\nguess if you know something about somebody, and the SS officer came to one of the\ntowns that we occupied when I was with the tank company, and Mike went up there, I\ndidn\u2019t know about it, had taken this gun along, we all were given a -- we both were given\na caliber 45 pistol in case there was some problem. But we were not to wear it, because\nwe weren\u2019t [indecipherable]. We didn\u2019t even have any documents [indecipherable], but\nthey were nice, and they said just in case, never know what happens. There may be a --\nwhat they call the werewolf, they may start again. A terrorism attack against the\nAmericans, even if the war is finished, whatever. It didn\u2019t happen in Germany, but they\nhated, like Mike, and -- I -- I can\u2019t even say he had hated, he [indecipherable] make it\neven with some people, this guy was an SS officer, whom some Nazis -- some -- no, not\n38\nnat -- some of the people in -- in whose house we lived thewa, had said, \u201cWell, these\nguys were in a concentration camp, he -- he got to be known around town that two of the\nguys with the Americans were in concentration. Well some people feel really bad, and\nwant to make -- do -- do us a favor by coming to us and saying, \u201cIn that house, that\u2019s not\neven occupied 1s a big Nazi, or an SS officer.\u2019 So somebody had told Mike there\u2019s an SS\nofficer came back, and then I [indecipherable] myself and Mike, we both would red if we\nsaw an SS, particularly an officer. And most of the SS were bad. There was such a thing\nas the waffer SS, you probably know, that\u2019s [indecipherable]. But they were bad. So he\nhad gone to this house, and I thought he was going to kill this guy. He pistol whipped\nhim, he hit him. When I hear screaming, I went in, and Michael said to me, \u201cThis is an\nSS. I want to kill the son of a bitch.\u201d Well, I said, \u201cNo, Mike. I don\u2019t have any sympathy\nfor this guy, but you going to be 1n jail again. You came out on one, you\u2019re going into\nanother jail because it\u2019s against the law in Germany, and you don\u2019t know if this guy --\nwhat he did. If you happen to know, maybe I can underst-stand, and other people will\nunderstand, too. If you knew him yourself, in a camp, or something, I think. But not this\nguy.\u201d Also was crippled, by the way, and I figured he\u2019s been punished. But we got out of\nthere, [indecipherable], and I said, \u201cMichael, don\u2019t ever do this again. I'll be your friend\nfor life, but my,\u201d -- talking about Mike [indecipherable] about him. My license plate on\nmy car 1s Michael\u2019s number on -- that was his arm. So I don\u2019t ever forget Michael. When\nhe lived in New York, and he died of cancer, he was married twice, the first wife died of\ncancer, too. He had a lot of bad luck. And when he knew he was dying, in Holland, I\n39\nwent to see him. And in Holland, you can die at home, [indecipherable] and you can also\nbe given a pill to h-hasten it, you know? I don\u2019t know what he did, but he knew he was\ndying, and my oldest son, and my oldest daughter came [indecipherable] to them, they\ndecided. And like I said, a couple of years ago I put a lifesaver card, they ask me\n[indecipherable]. I wasn\u2019t going to sell my whole story at that, I just [indecipherable] my\nbest friend had this number, and then he died. And you\u2019re going to make one special for\nyou. So I didn\u2019t tell him the story, so they said the governor allows only this and that. I\nsaid, \u201cLook, I go as far as [indecipherable] necessary.\u201d I think I want to do that a lot of\npeople put on their right now what they -- they\u2019re a veteran, or won a -- a m -- a medal.\nBut this guy was in concentration camp with me, and we both made it, and that\u2019s why I\nwant this special number. And I have that now permanently on my car. Some people said,\n\u201cWell you don\u2019t want to be reminded every day for the camp.\u201d I\u2019m not. I used to, but I do\nthink of Mike, at least once a day. And I told his second wife [indecipherable] no\nconsequence because he doesn\u2019t have that feeling for things like that. He\u2019s buried in\nHolland, as a Master Sargent in the U.S. Air Force. He went into U.S. Air Force, and he\u2019s\nthe one [indecipherable] so Michael -- we left this SS, and he didn\u2019t do it any more. So\nMike tir -- hated. I decided that hatred is bad. If you hate somebody who did something\nbad to you. It nags on you, it -- it -- 1t eats you up, hatred, and you become a bad person\nyourself. It\u2019s no good. I\u2019ve seen many people who will hate the German [indecipherable]\nGerman, and they say Nazis. I can understand that somewhat, or you find in Germany\n[indecipherable] today. I found some. I found some here, but -- in the army, but not bad\n40\nfor me to get excited about it. I think that\u2019s natural for some people to hate one or another\nfo -- or for one reason or another. The people way Jews hate them because they originally\ntaught that for awhile. The present Pope has tried to correct it, but in -- in United States, it\ndoesn\u2019t bother me if somebody\u2019s anti-Semite. I can tell them to go to hell. I can tell them\nin Germany too, to go to hell today, and nothing happen. People in Germany have\ndifferent feelings. If he then --\nEnd of Tape Two, Side A\nBeginning Tape Two, Side B",
        "A: -- was an enlisted man after I came into the United States, went into the army, and I\nwanted to become officer, but I couldn\u2019t because one, mostly for educational reason. I\nstopped my formal education in Germany when I was in seventh grade, and then I went\nto school in [indecipherable]. So what --",
        "Q: Okay, where --",
        "A: We just said something about --",
        "Q: Okay, we\u2019re back after a break, and -- and -- and we\u2019re going to just continue with that\nthought that we stopped with.",
        "A: I want to tell you, the reason it doesn\u2019t bother me here, because I know that no action\nwill be taken, prejudicial action. That somebody makes a bad comment, it\u2019s a free\ncountry, free speech, and to me, that\u2019s a greater thing here, living in this democracy, that\nit\u2019s not you'll have good food to eat, or be [indecipherable] one time, and that I -- this --\nthis [indecipherable] that as far as food is concerned, and many other thing, but the bigger\n41\nthing with me 1s free speech; that I can say anything I want. That I say in the office, I\u2019m\nworking for the government, the president\u2019s a jerk, I don\u2019t have to worry about the police\ncoming, picking me up at home because I said something against the president, I\u2019m a\ngovernment employee. This democracy, too. For people who never -- who were exposed\nto that, and we were always afraid of saying thing, [indecipherable] opinion about\nsomething, it means a lot. For somebody never had, like North Americans, it\u2019s -- it -- it\ndoesn\u2019t -- it\u2019s not very important, because every day we have an example, we say things\nthat under a dictatorship you couldn\u2019t say, and you have to worry about it. So I feel free\nthat even if something bad had said, nothing\u2019s going to come of it, they\u2019re not going to\nsmash somebody\u2019s windows because of that. It\u2019s just an expression here, and it\u2019s like\nsomebody said something about Blacks, nigger. My next door neighbor was very\nprejudiced when I moved in. He\u2019s my best friend in the street right now, a-always has\nbeen -- not all -- not in the beginning, but I noticed their opinion about Blacks, and they\ntalked about niggers. And our swimming pool here was segregated. I didn\u2019t know that,\nbut when I want apply for membership, I found out that my next door neighbor\u2019s also the\npresident of the swim club. And I went over to him, because you needed two people to\nsponsor you. That\u2019s how Blacks never got into the pool, because some people were\nalready in the pool, were not [indecipherable] some Black person to get in. Went to see\nmy neighbor, and I said, \u201cLook, I know you don\u2019t take any Blacks into the swimming\npool. I want to join the pool, but you probably not going to sponsor me. And I don\u2019t feel\nthe -- about Blacks the way you do. It\u2019s just blind prejudice, I don\u2019t think you -- I think\n42\nyou a good person, but you grew up that way, to -- not to like Negroes. And you get\ntogether people who think the same thing.\u201d And when the hou-house were being built\nhere, the superintendent said -- he had some Black workers here, and when he talked\nabout Black workers, \u201cWatch when they walk on the new grass. Don\u2019t let them walk on\nit.\u201d And I said, \u201cWhy?\u201d \u201cWhere a Black walks on grass, no grass will ever grow again.\u201d\n\u201cAre you kidding?\u201d I said, \u201cYou don\u2019t mean that. A joke or something?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d he said\nwa -- and that\u2019s the superintendent [indecipherable]. The next door neighbor didn\u2019t say\nanything about that, so I know how he thinks. So when I came to him the application, I\nsaid, \u201cYou probably not going to sponsor me, because you know how I feel about\nBlacks.\u201d \u201cOh here, let me think about it.\u201d Boy, and I give him time to think about it. You\nknow, I didn\u2019t want to start to be the troublemaker in the neighborhood. So I went to my\nwife, and I said, \u201cI don\u2019t think I want to join the pool here.\u201d Which would be a good thing\nfor the children. And then I decided, well, I\u2019m also depriving the children, my wife had to\n-- we had only one car, I have the car, and she -- it\u2019s good for the health to go in the\nsummer to the pool. I think I -- I -- I\u2019m going to talk to him. I went to him, and he said,\n\u201cTl sign you on, and I -- I get you another member to sign.\u201d I said, \u201cGood. But I also\nwant you to know I\u2019m not joining your pool to be a troublemaker. I don\u2019t agree with your\npolicies, and they going to be changed one day, and you know which side I\u2019m going to\nvote for, to let the Blacks in.\u201d And I felt that was necessary to say [indecipherable] know\nwhat kind of neighbor I am, and maybe he -- he won\u2019t have any part of me, but we\nbecame good friends, and he does anything for me I want him to do. He knows I\u2019m\n43\nJewish, and they\u2019re Southern Baptists. And Southern Baptists were automatically against\nBlacks in those days. I went out with a girl one time in Richmond, when I went to school\n[indecipherable] and she was Southern Baptist, she took me on Sunday morning to a\nchurch, and I said, \u201cI\u2019m -- this -- I don\u2019t see any Blacks in here.\u201d \u201cOh,\u201d she said, \u201cthey\u2019re\nnot welcome.\u201d I say, \u201cIn a church? Well, let\u2019s go then,\u201d I said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be ina\nchurch -- I\u2019m not very religious, but I don\u2019t want to be in a church that doesn\u2019t let\neverybody in. That\u2019s no church for me.\u201d So, come back to my neighbor, they don\u2019t call\nBlacks by nasty name. They are very dilerant. Their son, Ned Fortune, also called them\nniggers, and when he was very small, he changed. When he talked to my children, my\nchildren told him they don\u2019t like they u -- to use that word. And I really can see where he\nhad a change of mind. He grew up that way, and his wife grew up that way. So, that\u2019s\nwhy I think, in a democracy, where you can say every -- anything you want.",
        "Q: What do you think made him change his mind?",
        "A: I just started thinking about it. I don\u2019t remember at the time, but I would say that he\nbasically thinks I was right, and he did find out about me, what I went through through\nthe war, and he -- he was an en-engineer with the telephone company. And he -- he -- he\ngrew up saying this -- calling people that name, and that was just a daily thing where he\ncame from, and his wife. And he had second thought about that, and -- and to -- and to\nadd something to that story, his son, who 1s getting married next week, and we the only\npeople in the street who are invited to his wedding. That shows you how good friends we\nare, we are. Their son went to William and Mary. I think he went. And he -- his\n44\nroommate was a Black guy. And he changed his mind by living with a Black guy from\nAfrica, not American Black. And he doesn\u2019t -- he didn\u2019t use the word any mo --\n[indecipherable], but he still went to college, if he would have known beforehand that his\nroommate was a different color, he prob -- may [indecipherable], but he didn\u2019t. He had a\ngood experience with this Black guy, and he is changed. And he getting married now. So,\nFreedom of Speech, the greater thing, as far as I\u2019m concerned, in my life in the United\nStates. I have to g -- if I want to complain about something, I can go and complain. My\nchildren haven\u2019t been handled properly by people, by authority, by -- I have good\nexample there, and people did not think -- I didn\u2019t -- never think -- I never thought, for\ninstance, being Jewish I carry a chip on my shoulder, or it\u2019s something that I have to be\nashamed of. I\u2019m not even saying I\u2019m proud of it either, but I\u2019m proud to be a Jew -- ?'m\nnot proud to be anything else either, but I can be proud of something I\u2019ve accomplished.\nBut, well, maybe my ancestors accomplished something, that\u2019s why people call them a\nproud Jew. But I -- the people who are anti-Semitic here in the United States, can be\nfought against openly. In other countries, they call themselves democracy, but are not a\nreal democracy. And we have things that leave something to be desired, to -- maybe not\nthe Jewish [indecipherable] something else, or the Black, particularly, have -- they\u2019re still\nbeing prejudiced. I always said, well, as a Jew I can go [indecipherable] have the right\ncolor. But if you\u2019re Black on top of it, you don\u2019t accept in the first place, just because of\nyour color. But in America, there are many people -- and America has changed, even\nduring the ti-time I\u2019ve been here, for the better. It\u2019s not perfect, it never claimed to be\n45\nperfect in question of race, or -- or many other thing, but we can change things here, as\nlong as we stay a democracy, and have the [indecipherable] the -- that we have, the -- the\n-- if you discuss this wi -- Germany, for instance, there still 1s this not anti-Semitism, not\nHitlerism, or anything, but what basically in German\u2019s eye, my wife will -- like we could\nhave -- like a -- [indecipherable] sometimes too arrogant, and with this arrogance there\ncomes this prejudice, or they say this guy is this or that. The -- some people have certain\ntraits, Jews have certain traits, some of them not too good, and some are good traits. I\nalways point out on TV when somebody is Jewish. And my wife asked me one time,\n\u201cWhy do you think that he is Jewish?\u201d Not because of her [indecipherable] had to\nimpress her, but I think the children should -- they -- that\u2019s one part of the learning\nprocess, that you can be proud of some people -- when it\u2019s a criminal that\u2019s being shown\non TV that is Jewish, or -- certainly not. But I want to point out that people who invented\nthe -- a good example, in 19 -- soon after we got married, I was ordered by the army for\n10 days to Brussels, from Germany, to go attend the World Fair, and to visit the Soviet\npavilion there, and look at some things. And I don\u2019t [indecipherable] and I went the\nsecond time with the American joint media, we came from Washington, I came from\nHeidelburg, and because he didn\u2019t speak German, they said, \u201cTake him under your\nwings, he\u2019s one of our people,\u201d or -- you know, key people, \u201cand show him around.\u201d\n[indecipherable] too new to it, you already have some experience with speaking the\nlanguage. So this guy turns out to be a Christian American who was a -- who are the\n46\npeople who -- they are very simple religion, they all speak up. I can\u2019t remember the name\nnow, but is their religion. Not -- they have a very simple church.",
        "Q: Quaker?",
        "A: Quaker, yeah, Quaker. Very nice man, but he was anti-German. He told me on a boat\nabout [indecipherable] my wife was my fianc\u00e9e then, how I could marry a German. And\nnothing. I was German, too. I was Jewish as my religion, but so she was not a Nazi or\nsomething like that. And to me it\u2019s -- I don\u2019t think it makes any difference. But we\nwalked in the German pavilion from the Russian pavilion, and 1n the entrance hall had\nlife-size picture of a German no-Nobel Prize winners. And a -- more than a third or so\nwere Jews, German Jews. And this man, who was a Quaker, high ranking in -- in the\nPalmer defense, said to me, \u201cLook at this.\u201d And I said, \u201cI noticed, I know.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t get\nit,\u201d he said. We sat down the table eat lunch, the cafeteria, and there was a lack of space,\nand the waiter came over, and said, \u201cExcuse me, you have a table for -- you\u2019re only two. I\nhave two students here, would like to sit down, they\u2019re tired. Would you mind I seat them\nat your table?\u201d \u201cNo, go ahead.\u201d They sat down the table, they happened to be German\nstudents, and this guy saw red, the guy that was with me. And he said, \u201cDid you see,\u201d --\nhe addressed the German student, \u201cdid you see the Nobel Prize winners that are on -- how\ncan you have the nerve, Jews that you persecuted, take credit for them in your entrance\nhall?\u201d And I was shocked, and th -- I knew that -- but I didn\u2019t know he was going to talk\nlike that, and one of the German students said, \u201cWell sir, that was -- these people were\nbefore Hitler, and after Hitler, and Hitler did that, about the Jews. And we are proud of\n47\nthem today again. I\u2019m glad we are proud of them again, that they were Germans of the\nJewish religion, who won the Nobel Prize.\u201d But I never could convince this American\nthat I married a German, and several times happened to me here, in particularly Jewish\npeople. My own family [indecipherable], and the only family I had left [indecipherable]\nwas in New York, a distant relatives. I stayed with them for three months before I went to\nthe army. I slept in the kitchen. They had come in themselves to the United States right\nafter the war, and they -- when they were in Bolivia.",
        "Q: How were they related to you, and what were their names?",
        "A: They -- the -- this was my father\u2019s sister, Paula Friedlander, and my uncle Herbert\nFriedlander. They daughter is still living in Florida, only five -- five years older than I\nam. And where were we ma --",
        "Q: So you were living with them the first few months that you came?",
        "A: You wa -- I want to say [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Did it relate to the -- to the anti-German? Something about --",
        "A: Yes. My cousin lives in Florida, send a letter to me in Germany, I said I was going to\nget married, how could I marry a German? These were German Jews from Berlin, and\nshe couldn\u2019t understand. A matter of fact, came to a point where she was insulting. It\nwasn\u2019t about not being Jewish, but about being German. If your not Jewish they had no\nproblem with that, they were non-religious. So then I said to her, \u201cFirst of all, you are\nGerman, too, of the Jewish religion, or you were.\u201d And then you have to know the\nperson, know the family. In her case, I checked it out, they were not Nazi family. I could\n48\nnot, I don\u2019t think, for her parent\u2019s sake, that I could not marry Nazi family, who maybe\nwere anti-Semitic before I changed their mind. Even though their daughter may not be\nresponsible for this [indecipherable] 1t would be hard thing to do. You very much in love\nwith somebody, you can do a lot of thing. I -- I could have married in the family Nazi, bu\n-- but in -- I\u2019m getting off the subject -- in my office in Heidelberg was a soldier, a\nrabbi\u2019s son, who married a German whose family were big Nazis, and who told him\nnever to come to their home [indecipherable] Nazis after the war. And in my case, with\nmy cousin Flora, I then told her, \u201cLook, if you will not accept my wife, you don\u2019t have to\n-- you don\u2019t have to come to my house. I don\u2019t come to yours either, and I don\u2019t want\nanything to do with you any more. You reject her and you don\u2019t even know her. You\njudge a person not by the family -- I mean sometimes you can, but not -- 1n this case\nabsolutely not. So 1f you remain with this opinion or position, let this be the last letter\nbetween us, because I\u2019m going to live with her, not with you. So it\u2019s important to me.\u201d So\nmy aunt, her mother, wrote back to me. \u201cI know how you feel about the family, we\nhaven\u2019t got many left. Don\u2019t do this, cutting her off, not writing her any more, seeing her\nany more, some,\u201d -- but I said, \u201cI agree with you, very few people left. I am not making\ndecision, she is making decision. So I don\u2019t have to -- if she is against my wife, she is\nagainst me, and I don\u2019t like people who make judgments without knowing the facts,\nwithout knowing the person.\u201d To make a long story short, I married her, and because of\nmy job I was changed -- I\u2019m coming back to that again with some other thing\n[indecipherable]. I beca -- security, with a top secret project I was working on, they say\n49\nhe cannot be married -- the American army said, \u201cHe cannot be married to a foreigner.\u201d\nAs a matter of fact, even worse, not to somebody from the East Block country, East\nGermany, and -- because I\u2019m working on -- on a secret project. So, the army said, \u201cWe\u2019re\nnot going to give you permission to get married.\u201d But they changed their mind later on,\nhe got cleared, and I -- I married her. I -- I threatened the army that I\u2019m going to resign\nmy commi -- \u201cYou cannot stop me from marrying her. You -- you -- because I\u2019m going\nto resign my commission and leave the army. I have served enough time, I can get out\nany time I want to.\u201d And they said, \u201cDon\u2019t do that, don\u2019t make that quick judgment.\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d I said, \u201cyou stop me from getting married. If you come with me and say that\nshe\u2019s an east German spy, that\u2019s why [indecipherable], and I have top secret knowledge, I\ncan see, but you checked her out, that everything\u2019s okay.\u201d So to make a long story short,\nbecause of this assignment that was pending -- I didn\u2019t know about that, they send me\nand her to United States, and she became citizen, three weeks. They cleared her, and my\nboss said, she\u2019s as clean as [indecipherable] family -- about Communism, not about\nNazism, but I checked that out too, in the meantime, on a -- in a personal way. That was a\nk --",
        "Q: How did you check it out?",
        "A: I had friends who had access to paper, secret papers in the army. I was intelligence\nofficer, and there were other intelligence officers. So my boss, the colonel, came to me\nand said, \u201cWe agree, and I tell you something, that they won\u2019t tell you, but you work for\nme, that in everything I checked on your wife -- your future wife, came out as white as a\n50\nsheet. Absolutely [indecipherable]. Nothing suspicious. So -- but the new job that we\nhave you -- we have planned for you, your wife has to be a citizen if she is -- cannot be a\nGerman wa -- particularly from East Germany. So, the general wants to come and s-see\nyou. He -- he wants you to come and see him.\u201d A-And so I went to see the general, and\nhe said, \u201cWell Willner, we have you scheduled for a nice, plushy job. You going to work\nas our liaison officer at the German Central Intelligence Agency, okay? But a\nrequirement there 1s that your wife be an American citizen.\u201d If the guy is married that the\njob is given to. \u201cWell,\u201d I said, \u201csir, you know the problems we had first, and so you are --\nhe -- you find out what -- you find out what I can do for you to get your wife to be a\ncitizen, yeah.\u201d He -- he already knew, but he just wanted me to go through a procedure,\nto see what\u2019s involved. Well, in the middle of the week, had all the information I needed,\nI went back to the general, and he made the statement -- made the statement, sent me to\nthe Chief of Staff of the army in Germany, in Europe, and another general, and they s --\nmade -- gave off -- they gave statements that in the interest of U.S. security, my wife is to\nbecome a citizen as soon as possible. They didn\u2019t say that I was scheduled for a new job,\nthat\u2019s why -- they just said that -- they send us on a military plane back here, and my wife\nbecame a citizen in three weeks. She studied on the plane all the question they might ask\nher. So, she became a cit -- series -- I had to wait three -- three and a half years, and I was\nin the army.",
        "Q: We have a couple minutes of --\n51",
        "A: So, we came back to Heidelberg, and her job -- she -- I met her in the American\nheadquarters, where she worked when she wasn\u2019t studying. She was studying languages\nat the University of Heidelberg, and when she didn\u2019t have any money left, she went to\nwork with the Americans, in an office. When she had enough money, she went back to\nthe university. Well, since she was already working in -- on -- without having a clear\n[indecipherable] needed up there, she worked on some non-classified stuff, but she had a\nGerman salary. When we came back from the United States, she was an American\ncitizen, and her boss was an American, of course, civilian. He said, \u201cYou posi -- your job\nhas changed. I couldn\u2019t keep you, because you not germ -- German any more. This\nposition was for a German.\u201d She said, \u201cOkay. What job have you got for me?\u201d He said,\n\u201cSame job, we will switch you. You going am -- federal civil service.\u201d And he got his\n[indecipherable] out of it. So it\u2019s -- overnight, she was making three times as much\nmoney, but unfortunately, my job was seen to a different location, and she had to quit that\njob, go with me. And that\u2019s what she needed a citizenship for. They knew all -- they\nknew all that in advance, that might change and that -- and that -- and if we had children\nthere was still something else. But -- so, we came back to Heidelberg, and we -- we live\nin government housing, and I got changed to another city in Germany, and became the\nliaison officer to the German CIA, for the army, and there -- I\u2019m going to speak about\nsome other interesting things.",
        "Q: Okay, let\u2019s switch the tape.\nEnd of Tape Two, Side B\n52\nBeginning Tape Three, Side A",
        "Q: This is tape number three, side A, of an interview with Eddie Willner. Oh yeah, you\ncan start with --",
        "A: No, I going to start here.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Okay, I\u2019m sorry we -- I\u2019m -- should have had part of my story before, and not now,\nand -- to be in the proper order of sequence.",
        "Q: It doesn\u2019t matter.",
        "A: It doesn\u2019t matter? Okay.",
        "Q: No, cause we put --",
        "A: Okay, we go back to Brussels, where I went after the war and stayed --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And at that time, I was all by myself, and I went to Jewish organizations for help, and\nI was very lucky. I was considered an orphan, but here was a 19 year old orphan. You\ndon\u2019t put an orphan of that age in an orphanage. But the head of the Jewish organization -\n- there was the HIAS, and the Joint Committee, the head to -- was -- not the overhead, but\none of the heads was a Mr. Muntzbah, who was in the internment camp in France with\nmy father, and I knew him, and he survived the war, and became an official in one of\nthese organizations. And when I went to see him one day, he said look -- I didn\u2019t have a\nplace to stay, I stayed temporarily with some people -- and I also [indecipherable] the\nDutch people I stayed with. He said to me, \"Well, we have an orphanage here of children\n53\nwho were -- who were in -- hidden by Belgians during the war, but whose parents went to\nthe concentration camps, and then the orphanage still we\u2019ve -- have a place for them\n[indecipherable]. So, I know they can find a place for you, but you will not be part of the\norphanage except for sp -- sleeping purposes. You can go after a career, or back to\nschool, whatever you,\u201d -- but they couldn\u2019t help me. So I said, \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll take the room.\u201d\nThey gave me a room under a roof, very nice. I went back to visit it two years ago with\nmy second son, my wife with me. So I was in an orphanage, and I was free to go, and I --\nit was arranged for me to -- they say, what do you want to learn to be? What do you want\nto be? Well, I had no idea, and they had -- some Jewish organization had the place to\nbecome a mechanic or something. And there were [indecipherable] people go to Israel.\nAnd I went in there and I went to school, and then I found a photographer there, who was\na -- the court photographer for Belgium some. He had a very big studio on a main street\nin Brussels, very fancy, very rich. And I was inter -- always interested photography, and\nhe was a Russian Jew who had lived in Belgium most of his life, who was involved in un\n-- during World War two, in a spy group, working against the Germans, that operated in\nFrance, and in Belgium. And there\u2019s several books written on this spying group, called\nthe Red Orchestra. The German Intelligence, the Gestapo call it the Red Orchestra. But\nmost of the members of the Red Orchestra were Jews, and so had been my boss, the\nphotographer. So he was very well known, and because of -- not [indecipherable] because\nhe was photographer, and he did take portraits, mainly. So I wanted to work in the lab,\nand I think he had two labs, one was for his real business, the other one probably for\n54\nsome other business. He and I got along fine, but in the meantime was being re-\ninterviewed by Jewish organizations, and they kept asking me about going to Israel.\nThese were American organizations, some of them are Israeli, or pa -- or Palestinian. And\nthey continuously tried to tell me I should go to Israel. I didn\u2019t have a job, I didn\u2019t have a\nprofession, I didn\u2019t have anything. But I was healthy, I was a body, and they needed\nbodies there. So, on one of the interviews, this Jewish interviewer said to me, \u201cWell, you\nknow, with your age, and your experience, having come out alive from the concentration\ncamps, and being healthy, intelligent, and whatever like that, right now learn to be a\nmechanic for photog -- photographer. These are the type [indecipherable] in Israel.\u201d I\nsaid, \u201cWell, I agree.\u201d He said, \u201cHow about you?\u201d I said, \u201cI don\u2019t like me. I have no\ninterest in Israel. I have sympathy for the Jews that found a new home there, who came\nlike me, out of the camps, but to me it\u2019s too much sand.\u201d I -- I needed to say something,\nwhy I wa -- that was really -- I -- I needed -- I don\u2019t like hot climates, that\u2019s one reason.\nThere were a number of things, and also it was not -- how should I say? Fancy, like going\nto the United States. This was a country developing, that didn\u2019t have their statehood yet.\nEverything was new, and it was going -- like going to military again in -- first, also. And\n-- and the United States appealing to me -- they did, because liberated by them. I ge -- I\nliked the guys. You asked me that before, why I liked them, and so all this and more\nappealed to me. And I was a western European, this was the Middle East to me, and --\nand -- and in one of the answers the guy said to me -- oh, I said -- why do you not\n[indecipherable] I said, \u201cWell, too much sand, and too many Arabs. I don\u2019t like hot\n55\nclimate.\u201d And he -- he looked at me, and I thought I had to say something, and I said, for\na joke, \u201cAnd too many Jews.\u201d And I thought at that moment the guy was going to throw\nme out of the office. But I -- I meant it as a joke. But too hot, and too much sand, that was\none of the things I really meant. In short, I wasn\u2019t interested in going to Israel, but he\ntried to push me. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t go, and -- but -- but th-the worst thing I did was when\nhe asked me, \u201cWhat are you going to do then?\u201d So I said, \u201cWell, I -- I try to go to the\nUnited States.\u201d I told you that once before. \u201cWell, have you got paper?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d I said,\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to get paper.\u201d And -- \u201cFrom whom?\u201d I said, \u201cI located a cousin of my father.\u201d\nApparently he is -- he was rich, because he had to have some money to sponsor\nsomebody, and everybody at the time tried to go the United States, not just Jews, eastern\nEuropeans who didn\u2019t want to go back to Poland, or somewhere. And he said, \u201cSuppose\nyou don\u2019t get the paper to go? What are you going to do then?\u201d Well, I thought about\nstaying in Brussels. I also had a quite nice girlfriend, and -- was 12 years older than\nmyself, a teacher, but that wasn\u2019t the main reason. I still wanted to go United States, and\nmake a new life for myself. And I already had tasted American life with the young men I\nwas with in Germany. They had a big influence, really, on me. Clean cut guys who\nalready knew something about war, and had traveled, and seen Europe, an-and a lot of\nother thing. Well, United States [indecipherable]. So, when the guy said, \u201cSuppose you\ndon\u2019t get your papers?\u201d Well, I said -- he was -- he was [indecipherable] \u201cIll go back to\nGermany.\u201d And I said back to Germany, because that\u2019s where I came from, where I knew\na lot of people, my parents had friends who were not Jewish. And when I said go on back\n56\nto Germany, he said, \u201cHow can you go back to Germany? The land did this for you.\u201d I\nsaid, \u201cThe land that some people did to me and my par -- my family.\u201d Well, we\ndisagreed, and again, like I said, he was going to then throw me out for sure, but he\ndidn\u2019t. And I was serious, but today I would say I would have made a mistake, because\nfor a Jew to live in Germany, like I said before, it\u2019s different than living, a Jew, here. I\nwould take real offense if I heard them all Nazi talk, and I have, in the military, on the --\nbeing American uniform, and understanding German, I overheard many things that\npeople said, in outdoor caf\u00e9, or what -- someplace.",
        "Q: What did you hear?",
        "A: Anti-Semitic statements. Nothing out of the ordinary. Anti-Israel. And for that matter,\nI want to add this here, about German, and the talk I gave in high school about the\nHolocaust, that these people, like the SS, who did this [indecipherable] exist anywhere. In\npeacetime they become criminals because they shoot somebody, beat somebody to death.\nIn wartime they get away with it. They kill an enemy. So the people that did this in\nGermany, the same people we have in United States, too, only we have a different\ngovernment, democratic government, and for that matter, I think we have them in Israel,\ntoo. Iam sure that Jews who could kill Arabs, just because they\u2019re Arabs, who hate them,\nand Arabs who just can hate -- kill Jews, because they\u2019re Jews. Unfortunately, that\u2019s the\nway the world 1s. I think you have to be realistic about that. Hatred has always existed,\nwill continue to exist, and as far as I am concerned -- like I said before, it can tear you\napart. It\u2019s not good to hate. It [indecipherable].\n57",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Okay, I was interviewed for Palestine, too. Okay, start?",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: Okay, one of the nicer things about going to United States, and waiting for papers,\nwas first when I found a sponsor. Was a distant relative of mine, cousin of my father, I\nhad never met before. But he turned out to be a rich man, but not very generous, because\nI came to United States with 10 dollars in my pocket, he did not pay -- want to pay for\nmy ticket on the ship, which would have been about a hundred dollars, or so. So I went in\nperson to his home in New London, Connecticut. I thanked him, and send him every\nyear, for Rosh Hashanah, a card. But he didn\u2019t answer. He really didn\u2019t want any\nresponsibilities. I felt -- I felt, I didn\u2019t say so, but I -- that if I -- this -- I had been in his\nplace, and a young boy comes over, missed out on a cation, has nobody, I send him back\nto school, maybe -- possibly through college, and if he want to [indecipherable] his\nmoney back for college, say, \u201cLook, you can pay me back when you can.\u201d But he -- this\nwas not the case, and there was also one of the reasons why I went into U.S. army. I want\nto be on my own, and as it turned out, I don\u2019t have to have to say thank you to anybody. I\njust did it on myself, I wasn\u2019t dependent on anybody. But one other lucky thing happened\nin Bozdoltz when I was sitting in a -- a sidewalk caf\u00e9, having a cup of coffee, was an\nAmerican sitting next to me, next table. He couldn\u2019t speak French, and I helped him\nalong, asking the waiter some questions. He turned out to be a big businessman from\nNew York, and he involved me in a conversation, and then I told him I waiting to go\n58\nUnited States, and he said, \u201cWhat are you going to do there?\u201d He offered me a job in his\nimport export business. He owned -- also owned a zipper factory in New York. And he\nsaid, \u201cWell, when you get to y -- New York, come and see me, maybe I have a job for\nyou.\u201d It turned out he did have a job for me, and I learned production of zippers, and I\nworked in -- he really wanted to employ me in his import export business, because I\nspoke language. I didn\u2019t tell him I was going to go to the army. I would have been drafted\nanyway, there was still a draft on at the time, and I would have had to serve two years. So\nhe lost me anyway. So instead, I enlisted in the U.S. army for three years, whereas a draft\nwould have been for two years, something like that. This afforded me an opportunity to\nget a high school diploma, and -- which I did all while working as a soldier, training and\nso on. And I -- from the time I applied, to the time I started with the U.S. army were\nabout three months. I went to Fort Dix, New Jersey for basic training, and stayed there\nfour months, and then this incident happened with this colonel, I think I might have told\nthat story.",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t tell it on tape.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t tell on tape?",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: Well, I was chosen from my battalion, wh-which was at a strength of about seven to\n800 men, I was chosen the soldier of the month, that meant being a good soldier, and\ndoing things right, and handling weapons all right, and going to study certain items, or\nthings, that the army needed. Basically what a young soldier does who first comes in the\n59\narmy, nothing special. Well, out of this, based on the points you win, through the months,\nI got the highest points, and was named soldier of the month. That meant having the\nhonor of sitting in the colonel\u2019s office, on Saturday morning when there was no training,\nand answering his telephone, on -- on the -- on his -- yeah, outside -- sit -- sitting outside\nthe colonel\u2019s office, with the adjutant, who was a captain. At that time the colonel was\nreading the New York Times, and all of a sudden, very loud he said, when he read the\nheadlines in the New York Times, which said Israel a state, United Nations has voted to\nwelcome Israel into the nations of the free world, or -- and the colonel said to himself, or\nmaybe so everybody could hear it in the office, \u201cGoddamn Jew politics.\u201d Well, the\nadjutant knew that I was Jewish, the colonel didn\u2019t. He wasn\u2019t very much interested in\nthe soldier of the month. To him it was just another soldier answering telephone --\nalthough I did get a certificate from him for that. And he -- I -- I wasn\u2019t sure how I was\ngoing to respond to that, he didn\u2019t say this to -- to me, just to himself, expressed\nsomething real loud in the office, and I walked out, and I wasn\u2019t going to have the honor\nof sitting in this man\u2019s outer office. The adjutant came after me, he knew what I was\ndoing, and he knew that I\u2019d understood what the colonel had said. He was very\nembarrassed, and he asked me to please come back. He didn\u2019t want to make a big issue\nout of this. I said, \u201cNo, I just came here to the United States, and I admire the freedoms\nwe have here, also freedom of expression, but -- but not improper things like -- like that.\u201d\nSo he underst -- said he understands, but it wasn\u2019t his opinion, and no -- he didn\u2019t think\nanybody else in the office, just the colonel\u2019s opinion. Well, I said I can understand,\n60\neverybody\u2019s entitled to his opinion, but not 1n a position like he is, make a blanket\nstatement like that. So, the final thing was that I did not go back to the office, and in\nleaving him, he said, \u201cWillner, remember for the rest of your career, that all kinds of\npeople make this world.\u201d And I just remember that sometimes.",
        "Q: Did you ever experience any -- did -- repercussions? You were saying a little earlier\nthat -- that the adjutant was concerned that you were going to be maybe demoted, or\nsomething, because you had left the office.",
        "A: | -- I -- I really, at that time, could care less. I mean, I didn\u2019t -- I -- I -- I didn\u2019t think of\nthat I\u2019m afraid of being -- I don\u2019t think that could have happened to me, knowing already\nwhat I knew about the U.S. army, that everybody\u2019s pretty much the same, and people are\npeople, there are good ones and bad ones. There\u2019s always a rotten apple somewhere. But\nthere also good apples on top. So, it didn\u2019t bother me. Particularly, I was very con -- not\nconcerned, but aware of the freedom that people had here, and this was part of it. When I\nfinished that basic training, was a battalion at Fort Dix, my luck started. The whole\nbattalion was ordered to Alaska, about 700 men or so, and I was in despair. I thought if\nI\u2019m going to be in the army, I\u2019m going to use my language background, French or\nGerman, or both, but what about Alaska? Besides it\u2019s very cold there. So from my\nviewpoint, I also had to consider -- which I always considered, giving back something to\nthis country, and I was debating with myself, well maybe I should go to Alaska, like\neverybody else, but again here\u2019s free speech, I can open my mouth and say I\u2019m better fit\nfor Germany, or France. I can do the army more good, and perform better than being a\n61\nsoldier. Many soldiers better than I am, they can shoot better, and do this better, that\nbetter. And I decided, no, I should not keep my mouth shut. And particularly I thought\nperhaps, being soldier of the month, maybe somebody remembers me, and they will talk\nto me, because not normally down in the army that you go and complain [indecipherable]\nwith reason. So I went to see another officer who was in personnel, and I said what I\u2019m --\nI\u2019m -- I\u2019m not norm -- not normally in the habit of making complaints, this not a\ncomplaint, a suggestion, I would appreciate look into this. That -- that [indecipherable],\nas you know, I said, the battalion, infantry battalion is going to Alaska, and I feel that I\u2019m\nwasting my time, and I\u2019m wasting the army\u2019s time by just being a soldier. The only thing\nhe has to know maybe, to fire some weapon, and I can do that, but I can do much more if\nI\u2019m 1n a position in -- in Europe someplace. So the United States at that time was all over\nEurope, except in the east. And so, make the long story short, he didn\u2019t say yes or no, but\nhe said, \u201cYou'll be notified.\u201d I was n-notified the next day that I\u2019m taken off the orders.\nSo that was the first day, it didn\u2019t say I was going to Germany, but then I went around, I\nwas excited. I went, asked some people, some -- most people didn\u2019t know, but then I\ncame up on the sergeant who said, \u201cYeah, I\u2019ve seen your name. I think you\u2019re going to\nGermany.\u201d Well, I -- I was hoping he was right, and it was true. I went to Germany, and\non the ship to transport were some other foreign-born people, also in the army, mostly\nPolish, or Czechs, in total about 10. And when we arrived in Germany, in Bremerhaven,\nthe security people came on board, and they said, \u201cYou, you, and you, and you. You\nremain here.\u201d There was myself included, another guy from [indecipherable] Germany,\n62\nand about seven or eight Poles, and one or two Czechs. And what this was, they were\nhunting spies. The -- the [indecipherable] Intelligence had gotten information that some\nof the people who claimed to be refugees from the east, were not -- were from the east,\nbut were not refugees, they pretended to be. They want to get into United States, and spy\nfor Russia, or Poland. But they check everybody out then, including myself. Anybody\nwas fa -- I forgot to say, I was not a citizen at the time. And everybody -- oh -- oh -- amo\n-- among these 10 men, didn\u2019t have American citizenship. The regulation at that time was\nthat anybody who immigrate to United States, who comes 1n, and is of draft age, will\nserve in the army first. This for all the people who signed papers that they come for\npermanent residence to United States -- not if you\u2019re visiting here, you -- and you\u2019ve\ngiven up your citizenship. I never reclaimed my German citizenship, which I could have.\nI can go today the German embassy and say, \u201cUnder Hitler I was deprived of a German\ncitizenship, I want it back.\u201d I could have it. I know somebody that did that here. I have no\ninterest in that. They can keep their citizenship after all that. So -- so we were held in\nMarmuk, Germany, we came in Bremerhaven port, then went by train to Marmuk,\nGermany. It\u2019s an old German castle. There were no fences or anything again. Not as a\nprisoner, but just a place to live. And they told us they have to investigate each one of us,\nand clear us to go to our new assignment.",
        "Q: What year was this?",
        "A: This was in 1948. I didn\u2019t think, frankly, that six -- seven months, or eight months\nafter immigrate to United States, I would be back where I came from. Never in my\n63\nwildest dreams I would have thought -- 1t wouldn\u2019t have happened if I would have gone\nto Alaska, and I thought I\u2019d go to Alaska, or go the Far East or something. But -- so I\nopened my mouth, and I learned my first lesson, you want to get something done, don\u2019t\ncomplain about it, go and talk to the right people. Maybe you\u2019ll get a no, like people are\nre-religious, who think about praying to God, to give them this or that, or -- and then it\ndoesn\u2019t happen. Or like a rabbi once said, here in the military, \u201cWell, God is hearing you,\nbut he just said no.\u201d Well, that\u2019s the way I felt about some of these things, so they say no,\nsay no, but at least I try. I don\u2019t know if you see that little saying on the wall, I\u2019ve had for\n25 years. Failures [indecipherable] people are failures. Failures are people who thi -- who\nthought -- I\u2019m n -- y -- all mixed up now -- who thought and never did. Number\n[indecipherable] plan yama, but if you don\u2019t do anything, you know, nothing\u2019s going to\nhappen, or you complain about somebody if you don\u2019t complain about -- you go into a\nstore, and you have something to complain about the merchandise, or the sales lady, well\ndon\u2019t talk to her, talk to her supervisor, or to the manager of the place. Get something\ncorrected. So my saying is failures are divided into two classes, those who did and never\nthought, and those who thought and never did. You thinking about a plan of something\n[indecipherable] or you do it, otherwise you might as well be talking to the wall. And also\n[indecipherable] you doing something, to think about it first. I have buil -- built many\nthings which I thought were -- help m -- help me in my sickness, or whatever, and to -- in\norder to get my shoes on better. It\u2019s harder to get myself dressed, and I\u2019ve become very\ninventive. The moment I think about something, I start doing it already. But a lot of\n64\nthings I\u2019ve done, just sitting in a corner, they\u2019re useless. But I did them, so 1t was fun\ndoing them, and the idea to do this, and I pass on the ideas to other people, who were able\nto help themselves [indecipherable]. So -- and finally -- 1t was about 10 days later, after\nsitting in [indecipherable], only two people were released to go to their destination,\nmyself and another guy. And all the Poles were kept, because they were pretty sure, they\njust didn\u2019t know who, that there were spies being infiltrated into the U.S. army in Europe.\nOkay, that was the start of the Cold War, let\u2019s say, and -- but it was true, there were\npeople who were being infiltrated. It was a good chance for them to do that. And to --\nthere was specifically a case -- not one case, 5,000 people, they called it the Lodge act.\nLodge was a senator, and he had a law passed that said there are many people in Europe,\nor in Germany, particularly, who came originally from East Bloc countries, from Poland\nand Russia maybe, Czechoslovakia, who cannot go back, because they are not\nCommunists, or for other reasons, whatever. Some unfortunately, because they\u2019re war\ncriminals. And he said, \u201cWe have to do something, we employing these people.\u201d The\nU.S. army was employing them as auxiliary guards. They had the regular uniform that\nGls wore, but it was dyed black. No insignia. And they wore rifle at night, and they stood\nguard around these places, where there were American soldiers housed. And these\npeople, probably some of them were on the Nazi side [indecipherable] because they lost\nthe war, not on the American side. But the Lodge act said we give them a chance for new\nfuture, and they don\u2019t have any dependents, they must be unmarried. We accept 5,000 of\nthese people, who are already working for us, in the --\n65\nEnd of Tape Three, Side A\nBeginning Tape Three, Side B",
        "A: -- he was a army Intelligence school at Owamagow, Germany. That\u2019s where they have\nthe Passion play, you may have heard about that. And the school had two courses, and I\nwas picked for the criminal investigator\u2019s course. What is this, being a de-de-detective in\nthe army. Which is nice, because you don\u2019t have to wear a uniform, you go out in civilian\nclothes. So you\u2019re a soldier, I fig-figure for tho -- for two years, and you have a ID that\nyou are a -- a detective, or a criminal investigator in this case [indecipherable], and you\nhave many privileges, including most of the officer\u2019s normally have. Here I was only a\nprivate, or a corporal, and I applied for it, and the captain called me 1n, and he said,\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t think you are qualified.\u201d I said, \u201cWhy not, sir?\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re too short.\u201d I said,\n\u201cCaptain, have you ever heard of exceptions?\u201d I thought he was a guy who would cat --\nnot ask please do this, or do that, or -- I -- I was showing him that I knew what was on.\nHe said, \u201cYeah, well wh-what do -- exception would you have?\u201d \u201cAn exception for\nheight.\u201d I know that the minimum 1s five foot in 0 -- in -- in officer\u2019s school the same\nthing, but they give a -- a exception. He said, \u201cAnd your English is not that good.\u201d I said,\n\u201cThat\u2019s true, but I can learn very fast.\u201d And [indecipherable] he didn\u2019t want to let me go\nto school. So at that time, I had this civilian friend, a lady, who was a girlfriend of a\ncolonel, who was higher than the captain, she told him my story, and that the captain had\nrefused let me go to school. And this girl called this captain and said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you let\nWillner go to school?\u201d He had some stupid reasons. He himself was a stupid man, and so\n66\nthe colonel said, \u201cWell I -- I think he 1s very capable, and I think you should consider\nhim.\u201d He couldn\u2019t tell him what to do, but captains don\u2019t fool around with colonels. And\nso next thing I know was an orders to come investigator\u2019s school. Very interesting, in the\nmountains, beautiful, and I became a criminal investigator and they teach you all the\nthings a detective learns. But you deal only with army members, or air force, or navy.\nAnd -- so when I finished that, I was assigned to Heidelberg, which is the headquarters\nfor yu -- all U.S. forces in Europe. And in Heidelberg -- it -- it\u2019s the headquarters where\nthere\u2019s staff officers. Well I wasn\u2019t going to be a staff officer, because first of all I wasn\u2019t\nan officer. Number two, that\u2019s -- you have to know good knowledge of the English\nlanguage, you had to write reports, staff studies, that wasn\u2019t for me, I knew that. So I\ndidn\u2019t turn out -- I\u2019m going to the right school, and -- well, in Heidelberg. Our captain,\nthe commander, was a Jewish guy by the name of Marcus. He was a lawyer in civilian\nlife, and he was being -- he had been drafted for the army, and he became the commander\nof the investigation unit. So he was very good. And -- and then he ha -- assigned me to an\nen -- to a guy who also was Jewish, who had been a police force in Philadelphia. And he\nwas a champion boxer there. Big guy name of Goldstein. And they assigned me to him as\nhis partner. Now in police work you usually will partnership with a policeman that\u2019s\nalready well into it, and Goldstein was not only former policeman, he was big, strong, a\nbully of a guy, who if you -- he talked to you, pay -- you pay attention. He was a nice\nperson, too. He had himself been a captain, but he was demoted to captain after World\nWar two, because they made many people officers, and after World War two --\n67",
        "Q: Excuse me --",
        "A: -- it was common that a lot of officers, who made more money being officers in the\narmy than civilian life, wanted to stay in the army as a career, but they couldn\u2019t use\neverybody on staff, there was too many people. They were losing the forces, and he was\nrift. And then they had a deal, when people were rift, could re-enlist in the army, but not\nas officers, as master sergeant. That\u2019s a ter-ter-terrible come-down. You -- that\u2019s not a\nproper thing to do in proper management in my opinion, to have people moted up, and\nthen they go down again. But again, that was our system, and when I knew him was a\ncaptain, and I was a corporal, so Captain Marcus said, \u201cYou go as -- w -- Goldstein.\u201d And\nit turned out to be terrific experience, he turned out to be a terrific guy. He was very good\ninvestigator, he was very good with criminals. Good interrogator. I really learned a lot.\nAs a matter of fact, he was very courageous guy, and he treated me like -- he taught me\nthing, and I was very grateful for that. And th -- and then he got into trouble. He was\nhonest, but he had an affair with a German professor\u2019s wife. [indecipherable] been\ninvited the house -- and the German professor was not a Nazi or nothing, nothing to do\nwith, strictly -- so Goldstein did that, and then she was going to divorce him, and marry\nGoldstein. And she did, finally. I saw them one time in the States. Okay, those things\nhappened there, but -- okay, I working with Goldstein, and -- interesting cases. And -- for\ninstance, a guy [indecipherable] from Heidelberg all of a sudden, came like -- w -- from\nParis came a request, they want Heidelberg to send an investigator to Paris that spoke\nboth German and French. German, because he had to operate in a French zone in\n68\nGermany, and the American zone, you had to know German. Not all investigators spoke\nfour language. There was one thing, and the second thing was that he -- yeah, that he\nspoke French also fluently, and work with the French police in the past. I thought that\nwas great. So I went to Paris. I bought my first car, I bought a surplus Jeep from the\narmy. One thing, but I didn\u2019t have any money. 400 bucks that I pay for that thing. Lot of\nmoney in those days. And I put my dog in it -- I always had German Shepherd -- and\nbaggage, and I came to the French border, and the Frenchman said, \u201cWhat -- what do you\nhave in there?\u201d Gasoline, I had four extra cans of gas, because gasoline was expensive 1n\nthose days. You had to buy German, but we were entitled to American gas\n[indecipherable], and I had four jerry cans full. And the French customs officer, \u201c\u201cWhat\u2019s\nin there?\u201d He knew what was in there, gas. \u201cYou cannot import any gas to France.\u201d I\nsaid, \u201cIt\u2019s my gas, not for sale, and selling on black market. I have to report to Paris, and I\njust bought this Jeep, and I was told that it was difficult to get gas, and also more\nexpensive. So I took four [indecipherable].\u2019\u201d\u2019 You know, you cannot take\n[indecipherable].\u201d That was just plain harassment. They were jealous. Then I said, \u201cWill\nyou give me a statement that you don\u2019t let military allies -- that you won\u2019t let me cross\nthe border with four cans of gas? What big deal is this, four cans of gas?\u201d\n[indecipherable]. He said yeah. Also, they -- he wanted me to leave it there for him to sell\nBlack Market, they were [indecipherable]. So I -- I got upset, and I drove my car to a\nditch. He said, \u201cWhat are you driving it there for?\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019m making phone call,\ntelephone there.\u201d But I went to the ditch, I took my four cans of gas, and I poured them\n69\ninto the ditch. I filled my gas tank first, one more time. And the French came up, \u201cAh, if\nsomebody throws a -- throw the match down there, and going to be fire,\u201d and all this. But\nI was really upset, and th -- this guy, he got upset. That\u2019s what I wanted. I wasn\u2019t going to\nleave those four cans there. I made it to Paris, but I might as well not have made it. 20\nmiles out of Paris, I was looking at my gauge, and was at the end [indecipherable], if\nworse comes to worse, I would have gotten the French gas, but my car start to be on fire.\nI don\u2019t know, I\u2019m not a mechanic, I don\u2019t know anything. I\u2019m not interested in\nmechanics. I -- I -- I know my car\u2019s out of gas, or little -- couple little things. My wife the\nsame way, my old son the same way, and he should know about mechanics in helicopters.\nWell, it started burning, and I thought I had a fire extinguisher, couldn\u2019t find it. I said,\n\u201cLet the he -- damn thing burn, I want to get to Paris.\u201d 40 more miles I hitchhiked, but I\nfigured, with the dog, it\u2019s going to be difficult, German Shepherd. But I get picked up,\nand some drove me into Paris. Not only drove me to Paris, but drove me to the place I\nwas supposed to go. So okay, that\u2019s that. In Paris I had my greatest time. I figured I can\npick up on my education, and the army is going to pay for it. They encouraged that, they -\n- and the GI bill, and I was assigned to the French FBI [indecipherable]. They had several\n[indecipherable], and I wound up with a very nice inspector, who taught me all\n[indecipherable] thing. Basically, the job was, if an American did something wrong in\nParis, the French arrested him, and then they didn\u2019t know what to do with him. They\nturned him over to the Americans. So they decided to have somebody permanently up\nthere -- not always, call somebody someplace. And got the job, and I -- they paid for a\n70\nroom, the army paid for nice hotel room in a [indecipherable] from the Arc of Triumph,\nand the owner of the hotel -- hotel, liked my dog. I was all fixed up. So I lived in there for\n-- short of a year, and I had interesting experience, I was -- I\u2019Il just mention one, or two.\nA -- they had phony money circulating then. This -- these were not phony dollars, but the\noccupation money, they call it scrip. Scrip was money that the Black Market was done\nwith. You would go in the PX, and buy things with it [indecipherable].And\n[indecipherable]",
        "Q: Your job -- your job lasted a year. What -- will you describe more specifically what\nyour job was?",
        "A: My job [indecipherable]. As a criminal investigator, criminal investigations within the\narmy. Somebody murdered somebody in the army, and somebody stole, raided the supply\nroom, sold on the Black Market. Some people got involved in drugs, phony money being\nprinted by the French in southern France. Everything, like -- yeah. And I -- even\nincluding homosexual, which was not normal that time. My boss asked me one time if I\nhad been in England. I said no. \u201cWant to take a quick trip to England, just across\nchannel?\u201d \u201cYeah, what is it?\u201d \u201cWell, we have a guy, the English arrested a guy, a Black\nman, who is a homosexual.\u201d And the English [indecipherable] people know about the\nEnglish. At one time Britain was known for homosexuality. The men -- n-nice people,\nwell-known people. And he said, \u201cWell, the guy is a homosexual. He is not dangerous, he\nis not commit any other crimes, but [indecipherable] been arrested, he can\u2019t turn loose\nagain, he must be escorted back to his base.\u201d I said, \u201cDo I have to wear a weapon?\u201d I\n71\nfigured I might fall asleep, it might grab my weapon. He said, \u201cThat\u2019s required of you,\nbut you wear it underneath your jacket, concealed.\u201d I said, \u201cOkay.\u201d I went to London, and\npicked up the guy, and he was a Black sergeant and he -- very intelligent. He was\nobviously homosexual, but that was not -- not my problem, and he -- I got curious, the\nguy was intelligent, talkative. I never handled a homosexual. I had one as a friend one\ntime, and -- in the army. I di -- I di -- know he was homosexual. It didn\u2019t bother me, but -\n- but some people criticized me for it. I figure what I can do ma -- in my own bedroom,\nnobody\u2019s business. I ran away and I [indecipherable] good. I had a interview with the\nCIA when I retired from the army, and the CIA questions you, and puts you on a lie\ndetector, polygraph test. I answered everything truthfully, til they got to my sex life. And\nthe guy on the polygraph said, \u201cYou went out a lot?\u201d \u201cYeah.\u201d This nothing held against\nyou. They rather have somebody that he\u2019s been around, knows what\u2019s going on than\nsomebody who ts shy, and timid, you know? But some -- they had to ask [indecipherable]\nquestion. So, I was sitting across this guy on a train coming back from London, and,\n\u201cExcuse me, I -- you seem to be a pretty nice guy, and -- and in some places it\u2019s not\nconsidered a crime, but I\u2019m new in this. Can you tell me please, 1f you want to talk, why\nare you a homosexual? You look nice, and --,\u201d He said, \u201cWell sir, we walked here and\nyou see a good looking woman come out in the street, you -- make you excited, you may\nget -- you -- you look, and that\u2019s basically the same thing when I see a man.\u201d That\u2019s a --\nthat\u2019s all he said. A nice guy, I didn\u2019t think [indecipherable]\n72",
        "Q: So how did you feel about the army\u2019s policy, or asking you to arrest this man for\nbeing homosexual?",
        "A: I didn\u2019t arrest him, I escorted him. I\u2019m ne -- my -- my arrests were in different\n[indecipherable] Nazis, which we were not supposed to arrest, but I did [indecipherable]\npeople [indecipherable].",
        "Q: One more question before you move on. So you were just saying some -- something\nabout the polygraph test, did you finish that thought?",
        "A: They ask me, \u201cHow\u2019s your sex life with your wife?\u201d See, it was okay if you said,\n\u201cWell, I fool around, I have lot of girlfriend.\u201d They think you\u2019re normal, but with a guy it\nwas [indecipherable]. I said to him, \u201cWell, I tell you, I -- Is -- talk about everything, my\nlife is an open book. To my wife, too. But it\u2019s not just one of your damn business what\ngoes on in my -- my se -- sex life with my wife. If you ask me about a girlfriend, or\nsomebody else, I could possibly answer. But not about my wife. It\u2019s none of your\nbusiness whether it\u2019s good or bad.\u201d And I got up. Oh no, he s -- he said, \u201cThis -- this --\nthis concludes the interview.\u201d Fine [indecipherable], but they -- they come out with some\nother thing, asking -- they -- they particularly interested in -- you recording this?

I [indecipherable] my business there, but\nwhen they start questioning, I -- I never got the question, and -- and they trusted me,\nbecause know my opinion. And somewhere I might have told some of my bosses the\nincident that going to Israel with a guy who [indecipherable], and they thought, well, this\nguy\u2019s Okay, but -- but nevertheless, I\u2019m sure there\u2019s some who -- who think Jews have\ndouble s -- citizenship, and some of them do, some of the non-Jews do.

        "Q: What is the incident that you just mentioned about going to Israel with somebody\u201d?",
        "A: The -- Israel [indecipherable] somewhere. I went with my wife, and my younger son.\nAnd I wouldn\u2019t have goin -- even going to Israel, wouldn\u2019t have had the relative there,\nwho even provided me with the money for the ticket. I didn\u2019t make too much money in\nthe beginning, and when he asked me to come, I -- he gave me -- it was my uncle, he was\na pu -- he was very -- he was in east -- stayed in Germany, my mother\u2019s brother. He was\ndecorated during World War one, he\u2019s the one with the saber story I told. And he wanted\nto fight the Germans, because his mother got arrested and sent to Theresienstadt. So the\nPalestin -- the Israelis didn\u2019t take him, he was too old. He had been a bachelor all his life.\nHe was a playboy, as a matter of fact, but nice guy. He was my favorite uncle. He didn\u2019t\ncare about money, or anything, but he liked to go to parties, and -- and a woman that was\ninterested in him, 20 years younger, and was our do -- my doctor\u2019s daughter. And she\n74\nwant to marry him. She was 20 years older than he was. And I have picture of her sitting\non his lap when she was 20, he was 40, at a party. Well, he never married her, he went to\nIsrael, because his first girlfriend, who was a nurse, who enlists in the army when he\nenlist in the army, and they -- and he was sent to Queest, to what\u2019s that? A ci -- the island\nCyprus.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: The Germans want to attack there, want to take Greece, and he was in British uniform,\nhe was still a German citizen. That\u2019s excuse for [indecipherable] but he, you know,\n[indecipherable] uniform. But he didn\u2019t care, so the British said, \u201cWell, since you speak\nGerman fluently, we have a special job for you. We [indecipherable] landing\n[indecipherable] keep the Germans out [indecipherable] go on to Italy.\u201d And he said,\n\u201cWhat do you want me to do?\u201d \u201cWe want you to parachute at night, in the\n[indecipherable].\u201d\u201d He had never jumped by para -- he was 50 years o -- oh, they didn\u2019t\ntake him to the army [indecipherable] were 50, I think. 50 is nothing [indecipherable] the\narmy. He said, \u201cOkay.\u201d When he was in the aircraft ready to jump, there was a\n[indecipherable] the aircraft, and the pilot gets a little shaky, and he s -- he figures\nsomething\u2019s happen -- ha -- something\u2019s happened to the aircraft, that\u2019s going to be more\nof a fire on it, and he said, \u201cJump.\u201d And my uncle didn\u2019t know whether he was to jump\nbecause of the fire on the plane, or before he arrived at destination, because the pilot was\n[indecipherable] was the destination, and they were all taken prisoners by the German.\nThey fall off the plane. So he had all these men, sent to German prison camp, including\n75\nmy uncle, and he -- this -- the -- the German commander under him, Wehrmacht\ncommander, the army commander, not -- not a [indecipherable] person, knew that his\nhouse was already full of people [indecipherable] anyway. He didn\u2019t -- well, he got them\nin there, and the -- the commander was a [indecipherable] officer, and when he got to my\nuncle, he ask him, \u201cYou ever serve in German army?\u201d What he going to answer?\n[indecipherable] he couldn\u2019t prove it, you know. [indecipherable]. He wanted to show he\nfought in the German army, and the British army, he was traitor. He [indecipherable]\nsome o -- someone -- he tried to find out who the Jews were, and I think he was given an\norder, he didn\u2019t do this on his own, he was given an order to do that. So he said, \u201cAll\nJews step one step forward.\u201d They were all line up, and nobody step forward. He said\nlouder, \u201cAll Jews step one step forward.\u201d I don\u2019t know how many men there, I forgot. I\nknow it was something like a couple hundred. All the British soldiers step one step\nforward. And there was [indecipherable] for a prison camp. And my uncle was found out\nanyway, but they couldn\u2019t prove that he had not -- he\u2019d given British citizenship, which\nhe -- which he hadn\u2019t. He was still German citizen. So may -- the -- when he finally\n[indecipherable] he became PW, and then [indecipherable] one day the Gestapo, and had\nhim on the list.

So, I -- I -- maybe\n76\nwe should just get back to the chronology, and you were talking about being in Paris, and\nyou had left Paris.",
        "A: Paris [indecipherable] the only interesting thing I did in Paris, was when there was\ninformation on being phony American dollars printed in Marseilles. And the French\nknew all about it, and they were appearing in Germany, that\u2019s where they used that phony\n-- that scrip money, and there was a lot of Black Market going on. So the French said\nthey found the printing press in Marseilles. They asked me want to go along for the ride,\nnot to do anything. Take my gun with me, but not to do anything [indecipherable]. Went\ndown there -- and I was afraid of the French, because they always had [indecipherable]\nfor money, just like here. Like giving the whole thing away, and selling it\n[indecipherable] on the way down, and [indecipherable]. So I was very careful. We came\ndown and they didn\u2019t know about it, you know? And police covered all the exits, and told\nthem to wait, and they called [indecipherable] pretty soon it got pretty interesting. I\nmyself had a small experience with phony money, because of my language background.\nAnd phony money was the thing at the time, that had a value, you guy in the PX for it.\nPX has everything. And in Heidelberg there was a [indecipherable] there\u2019s some guy who\nsells phony dollars, the occupation dollars. And my boss, \u201cWell Willner, you go find out,\nby yourself, otherwise two come, they think [indecipherable]. Go by yourself.\u201d I figured,\nwell, phony money cannot very dangerous. The guy has a gun, he probably is out there --\nwhat they call the -- what did they call Eichmann, they -- shripeshoop. They gave a\nnickname, shripeshruf merror. The mer -- office [indecipherable] all that stuff, killing\n77\npeople, went out on paper wi -- 1n his office.

        "A: Was -- the reason why I was successful, and it\u2019s amazing.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: [indecipherable] before you have a -- the boss told me there\u2019s a guy who was a\ndistributor, like people do cocaine, or -- but phony money.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And I thought we were going to do like in France, [indecipherable] big. He was\ncarrying the money around, selling the people for German marks. I wanted six people to\nsupport me, because you never know what\u2019s behind it, and what members when they go -\n- be by -- by myself, because y -- they never suspect you, you\u2019re short, nobody thinks\nyou\u2019re with the police. \u201cYeah,\u201d I said, \u201cbut who is there to help me if -- to\n[indecipherable] over there?\u201d \u201cI\u2019Il have some people sent in by [indecipherable].\u201d I go in\nthis place in Germany, in a coffee house, meet the guy, and I [indecipherable], \u201cDo you\nhave the money?\u201d \u201cYup.\u201d \u201cCan I see a sample of it?\u201d He said, \u201cWhat do you want it for?\u201d\nI said, \u201cWell, I\u2019m immigrating to the United States pretty soon, I earn a lot of -- more\nGerman marks on the Black Market, I want to convert it into money.\u201d [indecipherable]\nthen have to get green dollars for it. He looked at me, \u201cWhere you from?\u201d I made a lie.\n79\n\u2018Are you Jewish?\u201d That was just how -- he thought I was a Jew who was immigrating\n[indecipherable]. I said, \u201cNo, I think -- but I still [indecipherable] some money. Aren\u2019t\nyou -- are you seller, or aren\u2019t you?\u201d I said and the phony money, all this was being\nrecorded on me, and I had a [indecipherable] turned out to be outside in case anything\nhappens, and more than one guy there that I could sound the alarm. So, I mean, I\n[indecipherable] sat there at the table. I said, \u201cCan you show me a sample?\u201d I said, \u201cWhat\nfor?\u201d No, he said, \u201cWhat for?\u201d I said, \u201cI want to know -- I\u2019m not buying this for myself,\nI\u2019m buying this for a friend of mine, but he is in a position, he cannot be seen.\u201d Okay.\n\u201cTindecipherable| show me a sample.\u201d But the money he wanted for it was quite high,\nand I think if it\u2019s high, he has probably good production, that will pass for -- for real.\nThen may a problem, and this doesn\u2019t look good, it\u2019s no problem. So, he takes out a bill\nunder the table, he hands it to me under the table, and he says, \u201cThat\u2019s a risky business. I\nhope nobody\u2019s watching us.\u201d And the police all over, he just sat there. \u201cYeah,\u201d I said,\n\u201cprobably, but why here [indecipherable]? Nobody following me, you know.\u201d Okay, him\n-- we made a deal, he gave me bag of money, I paid him, and the moment the translation -\n- the transaction was completed -- completed, he said -- I say, \u201cYou\u2019re under arrest,\u201d in\nGerman. But I had no right to. I was a German under the -- in the company of a German\npoliceman. Well, we just didn\u2019t have one at that, and the moment I said that, he looked at\nthe rear door, he looked there, he was going to escape it, but I had his money, and I said,\n\u201ctindecipherable], if you think of getting out of here without getting caught, you\u2019re\nmistaken. I have a military police company outside, of over a hundred men.\u201d It wasn\u2019t\n80\ntrue at all. And he said to me that he\u2019s stupid, and that -- that I have to understand they\nhave to do this to make the money, well, other people [indecipherable] making money\nnow. But then I came out, he esc-escorted me out -- I never even called the guys in. I\nwalked out the front door with him, and took big MP\u2019s kind of by the arm, and put him in\njail. So that was my [indecipherable]. Then I go in from Heidelberg, to Paris already\n[indecipherable] that too? And [indecipherable] Paris -- Liege, Belgium. Liege is a pretty\nbig town, for Belgium it\u2019s warm. And I lived there before in Brussels, 1f you remember?\nSo I was very happy to get to Belgium.",
        "Q: Were you in touch with the family that had -- y-your foster family in Belgium at all\nafter the war?",
        "A: [indecipherable] I -- I told you about that, and when the [indecipherable] the manager.\nDidn\u2019t I tell you that?",
        "Q: Not on tape.",
        "A: Okay, I -- I -- I'll weave that in here. I had been in Belgium before, and I enjoyed my\nassignment there. Then one day my job was changed. Instead of doing criminal\ninvestigation, I was going to do congressional investigation from our [indecipherable]\nhere. And they needed qualified or -- investigators for that, partially speaking the\nlanguage. What happened, congressional investigations in washing, if you had a son who\nwas the army during the invasion of France, or in Germany, and he was found missing in\naction -- there were many of them, thousands, but they had also quite a few hundred who\ndeserted, who didn\u2019t want to fight, and who got married to other women, local women.\n81\nHad already wife in the United States, maybe children. And the last that we knew of\nthem, he never showed up, he disappeared from his unit. So, a guy didn\u2019t show up in his\nunit, that could happen he got lost, or had a girl from someplace, then he was AWOL.\nAWOL is absent without leave. He would get some small punishment for that, but they\ncannot give you more than 30 days in jail, unless the guy stays a-away, excuse me, a year\nor something, then it\u2019s desertion, it becomes automatically desertion. So, congressional\ninvestigation demanded the parents, let\u2019s say, had the son missing in France, he was\nnever found. We have cemeteries over there, and usually people got buried in our\nAmerican cemeteries. We do not have cemeteries in Germany. It\u2019s not a fact well known,\nbecause our law says we will not bury American soldiers in enemy territory if they get\nkilled there. So if they got killed in Germany, they had to transport it back to France, or --\nor Holland, or Belgium. Okay, so this congressional investigations were usually initiated\nby parents, who went to their congressman, say, \u201cHey, do something about it. We want to\nget our son home in a casket [indecipherable] buried -- or even buried over there, but w --\nwhat -- know what happened to him.\u201d So you could get people buried, not in Germany,\nbut in France, Belgium. So whatever the family decided. I had the -- this cousin, who\nbefore the war, came to United States, he got killed in France, has a grave there in a\nmilitary cem -- an American military cemetery, and I visit his grave, send the picture to\nhis parents. They were originally from Germany. And then they ask me that the\ngovernment told us we can have his body brought back here, buried a local cemetery, or\nhave it -- him stay in a French cemetery. I said, \u201cLeave him there. He\u2019s dead. I know y --\n82\nhow you feel about him, but if you bring him here, what have you accomplished? You go\nmore often to the cemetery, you feel worse. Sometimes gotta finish -- the war is finished,\nyou can\u2019t go on and on with these things.\u201d And -- he was the only son. I said, \u201cYou had\nto -- you paid a high price for escaping Germany, came to United States, but that\u2019s the\nway it goes.\u201d If I had to make a choice, my family [indecipherable] 10 members of the\nfamily, and what I\u2019m po -- proposing 1s that we do a certain thing, but 10 -- out of 10,\neight are -- eight [indecipherable] took them all alive. I know this in advance, you may\nstill do it, or you may not do anything at all, because you\u2019re a coward, or you say this\nwon\u2019t work, or -- anyway, So in the -- in these congressional investigations, like I said, I -\n- we had to go further than the cemetery, the cemetery was only the last instance\n[indecipherable], or in the United States. And the deal was -- my job was to find out from\nlocal people, if there was an American, or more, killed in that area. They usually knew\nbecause the German shot him there, they were not going to bury him. And then the\nFrench fo -- found him, and they make a local grave out of it, right in the cemetery, bury\nhim. So I said to this guy, \u201cDo you have any unmarked graves here, where you don\u2019t\nknow whether they are Americans or German?\u201d He said yes, and that\u2019s the way we\nusually worked it. If they said yes, if they were sometimes a mound, not totally un-\nunderground, they would say, \u201cThere a hundred soldiers buried here,\u201d or, \u201c\u201cThere a\nhundred French soldiers buried here, a hundred American buried here.\u201d Or German\ntroops with Americans. We went to the extreme, our country, to -- which I -- I think is --\nwas right, even this point. These guys, they died for their country, and they have a right\n83\nto be properly take care of. So -- and finally -- so what I finally [indecipherable] hundred\nguys that the farmer told me, \u201cI don\u2019t know, we -- we just picked up these guys after the\nbattle was over, and they were dead, and we threw them all in a hole, covered up.\u201d I said,\n\u201cAre they Germans, or Americans?\u201d He said, \u201cI think they\u2019re mixed, they\n[indecipherable]. Sometime that is only German. I said, \u201cOkay, we got to open this\ngrave up.\u201d That wasn\u2019t my job. They had what they call graves registration teams. They\nwere Americans, comprised of guys, and linguists, and dentists sometimes with dental\ncharts, and what was the other thing? Well, may -- they -- if I thought, or somebody else\nthought, among those hundred Germans, may be two Americans we\u2019re looking for, they\ndecided to dig them all up, and sometimes that the uniforms, they were a mess. But\nfortunately, I didn\u2019t have anything to do with that, I just had to investigation, and -- and\nthen report, and then they took action on what to do about it. So I had this place with\nabout a hundred Germans, and I said to this farmer, \u201cAre you sure they\u2019re no\nAmericans?\u201d Because I got after action reports from the army, before I [indecipherable].\nThey said the 75\" infantry company went through there, through the area, and I had a\nmap -- had their all map f -- when they went to the war, and they send out two scouts, to\nfind out where the Germans [indecipherable], and those two scouts never came back. I\nhave reason to assume they got killed, if they were taken prisoner, and they could have\n[indecipherable] as prisoners, but prisoners we usually found alive. So, here already\nhundred or so Germans, and they decided to dig up. When I said I come back in two or\nthree days, when you should be finished, and then -- and they had not archaeologists, but\n84\nthey had dentists sometime, and [indecipherable] soldiers. And they couldn\u2019t, they were\nbloody and rotten already. But the teeth, you could tell. And the other thing was dogtags.\nHad the dogtags, you have two of them, and take one off and take it with you, to report\nthat this man was killed.",
        "Q: But were all these bodies from the last battles of World War two, or were -- what was\nthe --",
        "A: [indecipherable] yeah, probably.",
        "Q: So there were [indecipherable]",
        "A: Except -- except for the ardents. The ardents offensive -- where I worked my way\nthrough [indecipherable] there was the ardents, or the -- they have another name, too. The\nHertkin Forest battle. Hertkin forest was very tall trees, and the artillery shells\n[indecipherable] up the top, there was bird and [indecipherable]. And many people got\nkilled by shellbursts from the top, the Germans were shooting not to the bottom, but to\nthe top, because the top created a lot of splinters, and whatnot, and -- and -- and then\nspread out to the [indecipherable] underground [indecipherable]. But in this hundred men\ngrave, I came back a few days, and they -- we -- they told me, \u201cWe didn\u2019t find what you\nasked for, but we found something else interesting.\u201d Not the guy -- the guys were looking\nfor. And they came with a box, and in that box was half a leg, and in that half a leg was a\npair of boots, American boots. So right away I knew these were American\u2019s feet, I didn\u2019t\nhave to look at a dogtags, I think. And so I said to guy, \u201cWell, put this in the box,\u201d clean\nit up, took some of the dirt off. And then I said, \u201cOpen up the boots.\u201d So he opens the\n85\nboots, we gi -- at the time we had boots, they were not boots total, they -- on the side we\nhad two closures, you tied them up[indecipherable]. So, opened it up, and I find the guy\u2019s\nname in there. He turn -- didn\u2019t turn out to be the two guys I was looking for, but another\nguy who was also missing 1n action -- I thou -- I thought was missing in action. So\napparently, during the fights there, he had his leg shot off, and I said, \u201cWell, his body\nmust be nearby or something.\u201d And I said to the guys, \u201cYou want to dig a little further\n[indecipherable]?\u201d And they didn\u2019t feel like it, I didn\u2019t feel like it. I said, \u201cOkay.\u201d I know\nwe don\u2019t tell the congressional investigator that we found a leg, that there was the rest of\nthe body [indecipherable] whole thing. I said, \u201cBut they will be convinced that he is\nkilled, maybe.\u201d I -- you see, I was not in favor in spending so much -- too many dollars\nwith digging up people [indecipherable] rested in peace. And we sent that box back to the\nStates by air. Five days later I get a call. Wh -- some colonel on the phone. \u201cWhat are you\ndoing out there, Willner? You having a lot of fun?\u201d I didn\u2019t know what he was talking\nabout. He said, \u201cOr you have nothing to do, you do things like you do?\u201d I said,\n\u201cColonel,\u201d I said, \u201ctell -- I -- I don\u2019t know what you\u2019 re talking about.\u201d \u201cWell, you send us\nback a leg.\u201d These were the people that they -- they have [indecipherable] like a morgue,\nthey process dead bodies, clean them up, put them in nice box, very fancy. And so he\nsaid, \u201cThe leg you dug up, you want to talk to the guy?\u201d",
        "Q: Hm.",
        "A: Yeah. The leg had been shot off, and the guy was alive in United States.\n[indecipherable] his serial number, and they found him, and then they went to the\n86\nPentagon, and said serial number such and such, he wasn\u2019t killed, he -- he\u2019s right here. So\nI was, you say the butt of joke or something, for a long time down there, I am digging up\nlegs, and finding guys that alive.",
        "Q: So this was in -- during the -- the bat -- World War two, that he had lost his leg?",
        "A: World War two, on the Belgian -- Belgian, French and German border, generally. And",
        "Q: What -- what -- how did you feel about being in -- being in Germany again after the\nwar, and doing this work for the American army? Did you feel comfortable?",
        "A: [had a great time, I found my personal -- a lot of satisfaction, being successful, had a\nfree hand, my boss was so good that I went out in faraway places, and the weekends were\ncoming up, I would have liked to be home, but I liked to see other places, too. Had a Jeep\navailable, and a driver. Normally a team consists of three people, one officer, one\nsergeant or corporal, and one dri -- drivers were these Polish guys who went\n[indecipherable] United States, they employ them as guard, or driver. So I -- I was\noperating [indecipherable] also very independent, and the boss we had, he kept the\n[indecipherable]. He said that I was doing a great job, and normally he said, \u201cThere\u2019s an\nofficer, but I cannot promote you to become an officer, you got to go to school, and -- but\nPll give you another promotion.\u201d Got another stripe, and on -- once a year you have an\ninspection of people who don\u2019t normally wear a uniform, who -- who work in special\nunits, and my boss came around for some general took once a year look at you. And we\nhad to have all our uniforms in a closet, neat, pressed, insignia and all that. And it had to\n87\nbe open, not locked. And we went about our jobs while these guys were looking our stuff.\nAnd I had my hung up properly, and everything cleaned, and shoes shined, you play\nsoldier again. And then captain -- that evening, Captain Marcus called me in. He said,\n\u201cWillner, apparently the general knows you, he heard of you. You do [indecipherable]\nsharp here, but you got one problem. The question was why you not an officer.\u201d I told\nhim same story, you have to be a citizen first, and you cannot become commander of\nAmerican troops if you\u2019re not a citizen, only if you\u2019re doctor, a chaplain, or -- you can\u2019t\nbe foreign -- not [indecipherable] foreigner.\u201d So he said, \u201cYeah, but he looked\nparticularly through your stuff, he wanted to see what -- how you keep your stuff. He\n[indecipherable] nothing -- anything about your stuff, but I found you -- you -- he put me\ni-1n a bad shape. I -- he -- the general asked me what grade I have by now, and I told him\nsergeant. And we open up your locker, and you find corporal stripes on there. That\u2019s one\nless stripe [indecipherable] there are three. Why is that?\u201d I said, \u201cCaptain Marcus, I tell\nyou frankly. I feel like a nothing with just two stripes. I -- I -- I decided I\u2019m going to put\nmy stripes on when I have three stripes, to amount to something.\u201d He know -- I was a\ngood [indecipherable] Captain Marcus, I could say that, and he laughed, and, \u201cLook, if\nyou don\u2019t have them on by tomorrow morning, I\u2019m going to take your three stripes away,\nyou -- youll be nothing but a private.\u201d [indecipherable] and what -- then I wrote a letter,\nI think I can get [indecipherable]. I wrote a letter to the general, and I said it\u2019s not normal\nto -- for a sergeant to write to a general, and has permission from his commanding\nofficer, and I do not have permission from my commanding officer, he doesn\u2019t know\n88\nabout it, but I\u2019d like to explain something. And what he -- what I explain 1s maybe not\nacceptable to you either. It was not acceptable to Captain Marcus. I told him that I think\nnot because I earned them, or I\u2019m capable of doing the job, I just thought th-three stripes\nwere better than two stripes, it\u2019s a higher rank. A lot of guys had two stripes, but\n[indecipherable]. And he laughed, he -- okay. Captain Marcus took care of it, have me\nput them on. I know. I had the same thing happen to officer\u2019s school. You get promoted if\nyou're a private or -- or is a [indecipherable]. Okay, my three year -- now comes the\nimportant part. My three year less -- lesson -- enlistment was up. I had learned English\nbetter, I have got myself a high school diploma. The army had arrangements with state of\nNew York board of education, that for military people who needed a high school\ndiploma, they can take courses, or they can take a final examination for high school, and\nthe state of New York will issue a high school diploma, even if you have not graduated\nfrom high school, provided you pass the exam. So I looked at, and asked the guy that was\nin charge of it, looked at this and see if I am -- where I was weak. I always felt weak in --\nin m -- n -- math, or English maybe. I looked at it, it didn\u2019t look that difficult to me. And\nI said, \u201cI'll take the exam without studying, and if I don\u2019t pass, Ill start studying\n[indecipherable].\u201d I took a 10 hour examination, five sections each, and passed with\nflying colors. I was so happy. And that qualified me to take another test to become an\nofficer, because you have to be -- and the other things involved, first of all, because the\nKorean war was going on, they accepted people with less education to get them to\nofficer\u2019s school without a college degree. But you had to have a high school diploma, and\n89\nto be a citizen. So I had the high school diploma, but I didn\u2019t -- I wasn\u2019t a citizen yet.\nAnd with the -- I explain that, an-and in past a system has been developed, it also has to\nhave college education [indecipherable] army. They used to have a time where you can\nget your college education in the army. The University of Maryland, Virginia, they taught\ncourses in the Pentagon, and some other place. And they -- so that\u2019s what -- what was I\ngo -- what I was going to do. But I was up 19 -- three years, and I saved up all my leave\ntime, which was 30 days a year, I never took leave, never went on vacation, and Captain\nMarcus knew this, and he said, \u201cWhen you go to Paris, and you have to stay over the\nweekend, in the arm -- army\u2019s expense, because something ready for you, you are\nspending time working with other soldiers that are taking the weekend off, going\nsomeplace. And I will make a special deal, which I\u2019m also as commanding officer. I\nknow you saving up your leave time for other things more serious. So when you in Paris,\non Saturday, you don\u2019t have to come back, you want to stay there you stay there,\u201d and\nthis is -- I -- he -- he -- commanding officer could give you le -- leave time, three days, no\nmore. It was only three days you had to take [indecipherable] leave, and 1t was just at his\n-- it\u2019s like an award they -- they gave away three day passes to guys who did good jobs,\nwho wanted to see their families. And so I had 90 days, the agreement with\n[indecipherable] was I go back to New York, I go to the -- get my citizenship, and the\nrequirement was that, when you get a citizenship if you\u2019re in the army, it\u2019s three years, if\nyou\u2019re a civilian, five years, unless you\u2019re the wife of a military, and he 1s all -- overseas,\n90\nand he can -- the wife can get it two years, I think, because they prefer to be citizens, to\nprotect the pe -- United States. So --\nEnd of Tape Four, Side A\nBeginning Tape Four, Side B",
        "A: -- planes, but the Dutch knew, or they want metal detectors [indecipherable] but we\u2019re\nsitting [indecipherable] and they go melting, and discover or find the plane. And the\npilot\u2019s still sitting in his seat, completely preserved. I\u2019ve seen it. And the reason why\npreco -- preserved, because the ground is different, and it\u2019s calctum, and whatever is in\nthere. It\u2019s very soft, and it\u2019s very -- it -- it\u2019s like what do you call that, embalming stuff.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And it -- it\u2019s exciting when you see a young pilot, and the last place he sits, and he just",
        "Q: I\u2019m just -- say this is tape number four, side B, and we\u2019re -- we\u2019re rolling.",
        "A: Okay. I got my nine -- 90 days of leave, was to carry out some personal affairs in New\nYork, maybe get my citizenship, and then re-enlist in the army, if I get to go to officer\u2019s\nschool, because you could not go -- you could pass the examination -- entrance\nexamination, but you could not go to officer\u2019s school unless you went in front of a board,\nand they -- they voted for you. Nine people usually, they ask you questions. And -- but\nlike I said, I needed the citizenship paper. And I figure 90 days enough, because\n[indecipherable] said three years in the army, and what was the other one? No\npunishments, you didn\u2019t go to jail for anything, had a clear record. And three years in ma\n91\n-- and oh yeah, three years, and -- and then you -- you re-enlist, otherwise you leave the\narmy. And then you had to show the high school diploma, and your citizenship papers,\nand then you had to go in front of a board of officers, and this was not my area, New\nYork, this was in Governor\u2019s Island, you know, Governor\u2019s Island, New York.\nGovernor\u2019s Island had at one time military people on there, and offices, there was a\nwhole fort, and that\u2019s where I had to go to get all my administration done. But I didn\u2019t\nhave anybody to help me, I had to carry my [indecipherable]. But my main concern was\nto get to be a citizen so I could go in Governor\u2019s Island in front of the board, and the\nboards are maybe done twice a month, or something like that. And then they give you a\nselected, or not selected. So, I went there the day for two months to the headquarter of the\nimmigration naturalization service in New York, on [indecipherable], and stood in line,\nyou know. And I got very upset. I figure, I\u2019m qualified, I did nothing wrong, and these\npeople are preventing me from doing what I want to do, [indecipherable] me up with\noffice school not in being in time, and the army realized they -- can realize they\n[indecipherable] can -- can do all these things. And already 60 days gone by, and I talked\nto an officer, and he even said [indecipherable] advice, he said, \u201cWillner, go to\nWashington, go to the Pentagon. These are civilians here who -- they\u2019re bureaucratic,\nwell, the military are bureaucratic, but they like to give people the runaround. But if you\nare qualified, really qualified, I don\u2019t see any reason why you shouldn\u2019t go to the\nPentagon, let them help you out. Your people. You [indecipherable].\u201d It\u2019s a funny thing. I\nwalk in the Pentagon, in to the adjutant general\u2019s section, I didn\u2019t know who to see, and I\n92\ntold them I have a serious matter, I\u2019m going to talk somebody high up, [indecipherable]\nsaid that colonel so and so will see you. I walk in there, gave him a sharp salute, and told\nhim my story. I mentioned concentration camps, I mentioned citizenship, and what I\u2019d\ndone in the army so far, and the guy was impressed. And he said to me -- I said -- my\nopinion is they give me the runaround for one reason or another. Well, if you\u2019re qualified,\nyou\u2019re qualified, that\u2019s -- we\u2019ll take you into -- and he grabs the phone, and he mang up\nthe phone, he said, \u201cBy the way, are you a republican or a democrat?\u201d I didn\u2019t know what\nto say, I figure I'll say a democratic, he\u2019s a republican, he\u2019s not going to help me. And I\nwas really a -- up -- I was nervous. I think I have to say something. So the guy said -- I\nsaid, \u201cSir, I\u2019m not even a citizen yet.\u201d Make an excuse. I [indecipherable] \u201cI\u2019m not even a\ncitizen yet, so I can\u2019t vote.\u201d Well, he said, \u201cMake up your mind. Do you want to become\ncitizen? Say you are a citizen, what would you vote, democratic or republican?\u201d Again,\nthis is [indecipherable], I said democrat. He said, \u201c\u201cGood.\u201d He was a democrat. But -- so I\n-- ]-] -- J --",
        "Q: So you were lucky.",
        "A: I was I-lucky. I was lucky. Now I\u2019m more luck -- even luckier than that. He still had\nthe phone in his hand, dialed a number -- I didn\u2019t know he was going to, and during the ta\n-- and came through, he was talking to Franklin Delano Roosevelt, junior -- junior fo --\nthe son, who was a congressman, and he was a golf partner of him. That\u2019s how the\ncolonel knew Roosevelt. He was a big one, looked like his father. And he said on the\nphone -- called him by his first name, and, \u201cI have a young sergeant in my office, he had\n93\nan interesting story, something for our public information people, maybe.\u201d He said, \u201cNo,\nnever mind public information, I\u2019d like to talk with the guy [1indecipherable].\u201d And the\ncolonel said to me, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know if you haven\u2019t gotten it by now, but I\u2019ve been\ntalking to Franklin Roosevelt. Not the president,\u201d he was dead already, \u201cbut his son, he\u2019s\na congressman, he may be able to help you.\u201d So I -- I said -- I figured that it\u2019s probably\ntrue, he can help me. And then he asked a few more questions that Franklin wanted\nanswered, and he said, \u201cAsk Sargent Willner he\u2019s free for lunch.\u201d Of course I was free\nfor lunch you know, a guy like him, and have the honor to meet somebody like\n[indecipherable], and somebody who could help me, really. Better than na -- in the army\ncolonel, you know, [indecipherable] general. So he said -- yeah, and the colonel said,\n\u201cT\u2019II,\u201d -- he asked me I had transportation, I said no. \u201cWell, I get a staff car.\u201d So they go\nand get me a staff car, he took me to Roosevelt\u2019s office on the hill, and we greet each\nother, and he said, \u201cI heard you have an interesting story.\u201d I didn\u2019t tell him how I told\nyou, but I told him a little bit. He said, \u201cHow about your family [indecipherable]\u201d.\nNobody survived. \u201cAnd, so what\u2019s your future?\u201d I didn\u2019t want to shoot too high, but I\nsaid [indecipherable]. I said, \u201cI -- you know I\u2019m here because my citizenship. I passed the\nexamination [indecipherable] officer candidate school. I haven\u2019t passed the board yet for\nofficer, because they won\u2019t take me until I\u2019m a citizen, and that\u2019s what -- what the\nproblem is. I\u2019m fully qualified, and you have to be a citizen before they -- the board takes\nyou [indecipherable] become an o -- become an officer.\u201d \u201cOkay,\u201d he said,\n\u201cTindecipherable| make a reservation for two someplace, yeah. I -- I got to call this.\u201d He\n94\ncalled the commissioner of immigration naturalization in New York, he was a retired\ngeneral, forgot his name, but he [indecipherable] him up. And he said to him -- he was\nordering him to, \u201cGeneral,\u201d -- they all [indecipherable] general [indecipherable] retire. \u201cI\nhave a young sergeant here, he has a perfect -- perfect record and everything. He\u2019s a\nrefugee from Germany. I think he\u2019Il be a good officer, I think we need some fresh blood,\nand he\u2019s given the runaround by your people.\u201d And he didn\u2019t talk back, but he wrote\ndown the information, and then he said, \u201cYes, that\u2019s all.\u201d [indecipherable]. \u201cOh, one\nmore thing,\u201d he apparently said he\u2019s going to call the people responsible for this, you\nknow, right away. And Roosevelt said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to wait very long, and Willner\nhasn\u2019t got long, I will see this to the end, before the month is up.\u201d So when I -- he made\nthe reservation, and he called the general in New York, he said, before we left -- I don\u2019t\nknow if it was an hour, 11:30. I know some people take long lunches, but by one o\u2019clock,\nI want an answer from you personally. Call his office what the state of it is. If there\u2019s a\nproblem, no problem, I want everything handled immediately. I could have lied and said\nsomething that -- that they didn\u2019t know. So we went to lunch, we had a good lunch, we\ndidn\u2019t talk about anything bad, he just asked me some questions -- you asked me how --\nhow I felt the United States, and if I knew about his father, and I have a letter hanging,\nfrom him, downstairs, and he asked me about the situation in Germany, what I thought\nabout it. And my knowledge was limited except to what I experienced. He had some\npolitical questions, too. But we had a good conversation, and he said, \u201cWell, the army\u2019s\nnot for everybody, if you do all right, I -- three years won\u2019t do you any harm. But maybe\n95\nyou want to become a politician like me.\u201d And I was going to say, \u201cWell, with a father\nlike yours, that\u2019s easy,\u201d you know, but probably -- only now foreign born people become\npoliticians, too. Hey, there\u2019s a Holocaust survivor, too, but --",
        "Q: Mm-hm [indecipherable |",
        "A: And [indecipherable] politician [indecipherable]. I don\u2019t know, but we kidded around\na lot, and yeah, oh yeah, yeah, I know what he said, \u201cBut not like my brother.\u201d You know\nhis brother\u2019s story? He had another brother -- he had several brothers, in cali -- in\nCalifornia, James. He [indecipherable] he make me laugh, or something, and he said -- I -\n- | -- I didn\u2019t know. I never heard the name James. But I said -- \u201cOh, oh, you don\u2019t know.\nHe\u2019s running for office again, and he\u2019s quite a ladies man, he\u2019s married. And he just had\na very interesting poster put out about him by the opposition. He -- he had a folder --\nposter they were putting in California on the walls, and it said on there, send Jimmy back\nto Washington. The wife you save may be your own.\u201d You have your -- laugh about his\nbrother, you know, fooling around, and it\u2019s so funny. He was really a -- he was really -- I\ncheck on it later [indecipherable], and he was such a ladies man.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And so then we came back from lunch, and the secretary said, \u201cThe gentleman called\nalready. He didn\u2019t want to talk to me, he wanted to talk to you.\u201d Said okay, he take the\nphone. And I\u2019m making this up, I mean, I didn\u2019t hear what he said, but he must have\nasked Roosevelt if I could be next morning in New York. And Roosevelt asked me if I\ncould be there. \u201cSure. I\u2019ll -- Pll get a private plane [indecipherable] but -- but I'll be\n96\nthere.\u201d He said, \u201cYou'll be -- not going -- you\u2019re not going there just to talk to people,\nyou\u2019re going to be sworn in citizen tomorrow morning. So get a clean uniform.\u201d I said I\ndon\u2019t have any [indecipherable]. So -- and you may have to answer some questions there.\nSo I was next morning in New York. They had a special ceremony for me, I was the only\none. I walked in [indecipherable] room, and there\u2019s a woman judge, and she said, \u201cSo\nyou want to become a citizen? You already half a citizen, you are military sergeant, and\nI\u2019m not going to ask you a lot of questions, but just a few.\u201d She want to put me at ease.\nAnd I was worried, I -- I hadn\u2019t studied like my wife did later on, I -- just when I ran into.\nI was too busy, and too nervous. He -- she -- she said, \u201cWho\u2019s Uncle Sam?\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d I\nsaid, \u201che\u2019s the guy I work for.\u201d And then she said, in getting more serious, she said, \u201cIf\nyou\u2019re a citizen, are you willing to pay taxes?\u201d I thought it was a stupid thing, I said,\n\u201cYes, off course.\u201d I said, \u201cNot be willing to pay taxes, I don\u2019t think I can get to see. The\nmilitary take -- takes the taxes out of your pay right away. So -- but I\u2019m willing to pay\ntaxes.\u201d And I don\u2019t remember the third question she asked me. So I was sworn in --",
        "Q: She only asked you three questions?",
        "A: Two.",
        "Q: Two questions, mm-hm.",
        "A: And the swearing in ceremony was very nice, but people -- my [indecipherable]",
        "Q: -- the thing about the swearing in ceremony.",
        "A: After I was sworn in, I had my certificate, I immediately went back to my place, I\npacked, and that -- for New York. And I left [indecipherable]. So when I came to New\n97\nYork, my next move was to get in front of the officer selection board, and I had my\npapers, and I went to Governor\u2019s Island. There was the headquarters of the first U.S.\narmy. And I went in there, and told them what the story was, and they said they have\nselection boards only once or twice a month. I said, \u201cThat might be trouble, so w --\nwhen\u2019s the next selection board meeting?\u201d And he didn\u2019t know. And I was lucky again,\nthere\u2019s meeting next morning, but I was not on the list of people to be interviewed. So\nthey added me to it. And they say this 1s a special, and -- so I came in front of the board,\nthere were nine officers, and there were about 20 or so people to [indecipherable]. So I\ntimed these people, see how long this takes. Five minutes. And I went in there, I was still\ngoing on for half an hour. And I thought -- not like here 1s interesting, or -- I thought I\u2019m\nnot going to make it. They\u2019re asking real hard questions. And nothing against me, they\nwere very nice, but you -- you are nervous when you go. This is my fu-future, and now I\nhave everything, now I got to go to school, and then I worry about getting through\nschool. So, they ask me all kind of questions and I answer. Then this thing was finished, I\nwas the last one, I had to take the ferry back from Ellis Island to New York -- Manhattan.\nI got in a ferry, and one major was on the ferry, and there was an aboard, and he said\nhello [indecipherable] far away. And then I decided I\u2019m going to make a move. I know\nit\u2019s not legal for him to tell me, but I made [indecipherable]. I\u2019ve got to know, I won\u2019t be\nable to sleep. People had told me I will be notified in about a week. And the way this\nthing worked up there, I know they asked me a lot of questions they didn\u2019t ask the other\npeople. They were concerned, I was a foreigner, who was going to be in charge of\n98\nAmerican troops, maybe with a career, and into combat. They wanted someho -- body\nthey can trust, and they -- so when I left, I didn\u2019t know whether am I going to make it or\nnot. So I find this major on the boat, on the ferry. I go over to him, and I say, \u201cExcuse me\nsir, I know it\u2019s illegal, I know you cannot give me the answer, but I\u2019m going to ask you\nanyway, because I\u2019m so damn nervous. I\u2019ve been waiting for this for a long time\n[indecipherable] problems, they all got straightened out, and you got 15 guys -- nine guys\n-- nine guys, and nobody took more than five minutes, one guy took 15 minutes, and I\nwas in there at least half an hour. I like to know where I stand. I know you cannot tell me\nwhether I made it, cause they told me I\u2019d be notified. And -- can you give me an\nindication?\u201d I wa -- atsfa -- I tell you, the guy\u2019s nice, he will say something. And he said,\n\u201cWell, I cannot tell you anything. But you can go home, and tell your folks you did all\nright. I know that you did all right.\u201d And so I was notified, and they did another nice\nthing, they changed my order, I didn\u2019t have to go back to Europe and pick up the stuff I\nleft there. They sent it back, and the army immediately sent me to Fort Dix. I went to a\nprep school first, for leadership training. So I graduated -- and leadership training school\nwas not mainly for officers -- for future officers, but for future sergeants. For the guys\nwho get higher, but need more leadership training, that was eight weeks. But they added\nthe officer candidates to it, and -- because the army say, \u201cIf they cannot make that course,\nthey sure as hell cannot make the officer\u2019s course.\u201d So I did that, I did all right, and I\nmade two great acquaintance there, which were important in my life. One was my best\nmilitary friend, who was not Jewish, but who had also come from England, so he was\n99\nmilitary. His father was American who went to England, married a British woman, and\nhe was a sergeant [indecipherable]. He became very good friend. He got married while he\nwas in school, when he was not allowed to get married. With my money. He\u2019s -- asked\nme, one day he called up, \u201cI got to get married. I don\u2019t want to lose this woman, can I\nborrow money from you?\u201d Remember this, that a lot of guys borrow money, but we\nnever borrowed from [indecipherable]. I said, \u201cHow much?\u201d He said, \u201c300 dollars.\u201d I\nsay, \u201cSure.\u201d I send him 300 dollars, he got married, he had three boys. But then we\nstarted this school together, and went to Philadelphia, from Fort Dix, on the weekend, to\ngo to a -- to go to an orchestra, I believe, philharmonic. And a famous guy was there, a\nBritish conductor, sir -- sir -- sir -- in the military they got free tickets. So we got together\nfour guys, went to Philadelphia. On the way back, a drunken guy drove into our car, he\nbacked out, high speed. I was asleep in the back seat, I wound up in the hospital. I was\nfive weeks in the hospital by a concussion, broken nose [indecipherable]. And so I didn\u2019t\ngo to the course because I was atained in the hospital, but my best friend went. So, I got\nhealed, and then I\u2019m [indecipherable] there to the doctor, my nose was going back to the\nside like this, it broke in two places. And the specialist -- military specialist, didn\u2019t want\nto correct it. He had made a mistake and not set 1t back when it happened. And he said,\n\u201cWell, what do you want to be, a Clark Gable?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d I said, \u201cI just want a straight nose\nagain.\u201d I -- I -- and he said -- and start pushing on my nose, it started bleeding, and the\nnurse shook her head. When he was out, she said, \u201cDon\u2019t take that doctor.\u201d \u201cYeah,\u201d I\nsaid, \u201cto me, he\u2019s more like a veterinarian, or in Germany, they call a -- a horse doctor. I\n100\nnever se-seen anything like that.\u2019 And he told me to come in my quit. He said, \u201cYou still\nwant it done, you can be -- come to my clinic.\u201d And he want to do this again. I said, \u201cNo,\nI\u2019m refusing now to be touched by you. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re doing the right thing.\u201d To\nmake a long story short, a year later, Walter Reed Army Hospital operated, plastic\nsurgeon, went put it back where it was. Very nice [indecipherable]. He was just -- just a\njerk. Then I went to day school, and we weren\u2019t on the same class -- every class was 250\npeople, and my friend was ahead of me, but because he got married, his weekends were\nspent with his wife, he didn\u2019t study too hard, and he flunked a couple of courses. Not --\nhe was intelligent, but he -- he didn\u2019t study. So they had a deal in the school, if a guy is a\ngood guy, he\u2019s -- if he\u2019s -- they think he\u2019s capable of making [indecipherable], they gave\nhim a second chance, they started him again the second time, beginning of the course, we\nhad three months in already, and he flunked. He was sent back to my class. So he was --\nhere we were together again, and we graduate together. And so in --",
        "Q: We\u2019ve just got a couple more minutes.",
        "A: Okay, I will tell you one thing and then -- a very important thing I\u2019d like to get it in --\nnot now, about prejudice at the officer candidate school. And [indecipherable] the officer\n-- the class I was in, usually a hundred and tw -- 250 people started in class, and out of\n250 people who were selected, 95 percent were college graduates, who were not in\nROTC, [indecipherable] but who didn\u2019t want to go to Korea [indecipherable],and who\nwanted to become officers. So the -- there was a lot of competition, I didn\u2019t have cl -- I\njust finished high school, but the requirement was that as soon as I become an officer, I --\n101\nI -- I studied for two years on the side, for two years college. Now they changed that to\ncollege degree. So I was lucky in that respect too, I can remember that, but the\ncompetition. My room mate, we had two guys to a room, had [indecipherable] top guy,\nand he was from -- he had a master\u2019s degree in hotel business. He went to New Jersey\nsomeplace, or ne -- well anyway, he helped me a lot, and I helped him. He was\nacademically tops, and I was in some other things tops. Like shine your shoes. No, no,\nbut physically. So out of the 250 people, 121 graduated, less than 50 percent. I was\nfeeling pretty good, and I was number 112 out of 121, but I made it, first time. They told\nme -- the officer\u2019s told me if I don\u2019t make it the first time, they\u20191l make me make it a\nsecond time, that my friend did. And they thought I had the capability, and -- but they\ntreated me very nice there, except one major who was prejudice. And that story\n[indecipherable |",
        "Q: Okay, let\u2019s stop there for today then.\nEnd of Tape Four, Side B\n102\nBeginning Tape Five, Side A",
        "Q: It\u2019s now the 13\" of July, and we\u2019re on tape number five, side A, of an interview with\nEddie Willner.",
        "A: I think we stopped yesterday on -- on when we graduated from school, and I gave you\nsome figures. Well, there was one major 1n the school who was what they call a tactical\nofficer, who 1s instructor --",
        "Q: Actually, we did the figures. The only thing that -- yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, the figures I -- I\u2019m not going to mention.",
        "Q: Yeah, okay.",
        "A: So I\u2019m -- when we actually graduated --",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: -- it was in a theater, with a stage, there were two generals there, and all our former\ninstructors, and officers from the class, they were lined up on the stage. So on -- there\nwere three -- usually, an -- normally, there -- two people call on the stage to have the bars\npinned on by a general. He\u2019s the top academic guy in the class, and the second guy is the\ntop athletic guy, who wins all the military stakes mishum sports, and stuff like. So the\nsecond guy got called up, and all of a sudden they call my name on the stage, and I was\nnumber 121 in line to get the bars, and only the first two get their bars pinned on by the\ngeneral, and the others, somebody else pins them on. I was called on stage, and we\nsupposed to complete the prize to have the bars pinned on by a general because it was\nstated that I was the first naturalized citizen after the war who became an army officer.\n103\nNot only that, that I was cited for having done -- worked the hardest to become an officer.\nAnd then the general made a joke, he said, \u201cAre you f -- did you follow your or-orders\nfrom your immediate superiors not to go on weekends to a hotel and study -- sit ina\nroom, but just to go out and have some fun?\u201d I said no. I was ordered one time, because\nmy colleagues reported me -- we had what in -- what they called buddy ratings. 24 guys\nwho live with you on one floor, had to report on each other what kind of -- criticized you,\nor -- so you could think about your -- they called them buddy ratings. And our instructor\nwould look at them, and I was reported by quite a few of them for not going on leave on\nweekends, which they wanted to, because it\u2019s very hard, the studies, and some guys\ncracked up, and went out -- went out of the school, they couldn\u2019t take it, it was too -- too\n-- too strict, and in my case, I took leave like e-everybody else, went downtown like\neverybody else, but didn\u2019t go to a movie, or didn\u2019t date any girls. I went to hotel room,\nand I studied. So, at the time we had, like I said, a couple of people that need psychiatric\ntreatment, because they just couldn\u2019t take it. But that\u2019s the part of becoming an officer, th\n-- taking a lot of stress and th -- and to me that didn\u2019t mean anything, I had gone through\na lot more than that. But I need to study. I figure if \u2019'm going to make it, I need to study.\nPhysical part was no problem. So I study -- they reported me that I didn\u2019t take it easy on\nweekends, that I went to a hotel room and studied. On Monday the senior instructor had\nme in the office, and said, \u201cYou got to stop this. I don\u2019t want you [indecipherable] about\nit.\u201d Anyway, that was one. So when I -- here we were on a stage, and I was the third one\nto get the bars pinned on by a general. And then we had to say good-bye, salute every\n104\nofficer that was our instructor, were about a dozen or so from my class. And the way it\nworked, you got your diploma, shook hands with a general, and he put the bars on rikey,\nand then went on to the next guy, and then went from rank to rank, lower, lower. Til I got\nto the major who was so prejudiced. And actually, I knew this, he\u2019d tried to get me out of\nschool, get me -- not have m -- not graduate fr-from the officer\u2019s school. And I don\u2019t\nthink I told the story, what -- the actual happening, what -- what -- how I found out that\nhe was prejudiced, and that he really tried to get me, you know out of my way, out of\nschool. And this was not just me, but everybody who was Black, or Jewish, or some other\nforeign [indecipherable] came from foreign country, maybe, or his parents gave him\n[indecipherable] name. He was picking on them, and tried to get them kicked out of\nschool, including me. In my case, it was another story. He used my being foreign-born,\nand having gone through the Holocaust, by saying when -- during a coun-counseling\nsession, \u201cCandi-Candidate Willner, if you become an officer, and the army sends you to\nGermany, wouldn\u2019t that be very bad that you hate those Germans, and you -- because\nthey killed your parents, and your family, and wouldn\u2019t that be very bad for the army,\nsend you to Germany, and you would have to put up with those people, who did this?\nYou probably hate the Germans.\u201d I said, \u201cMajor, I don\u2019t hate the Germans. I -- that\u2019s the\nonly people are responsible for what happened, but I don\u2019t put everybody in the same pot.\nI -- those who have done bad things, I don\u2019t want any part of them, but there\u2019s Germans -\n- many Germans who are good. Otherwise I wouldn\u2019t be here today.\u201d \u201cWell, I don\u2019t\nunderstand you,\u201d he said, \u201cI -- I -- I -- you must hate the Germans.\u201d I said, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t\n105\nhate the Germans. I am German myself, of Jewish faith, and I don\u2019t have that problem. If\nthe army sends me to Germany, I\u2019ll conduct myself the way is expected of me, and I\nimmedi -- I had to keep my personal feelings to myself, in the interest of the army\n[indecipherable].\u201d Well, he kept on and on, digging, but he didn\u2019t get anywhere wi-with\nme, and he apparently tried to talk me into saying something that I hated Germans\nbecause what happened, and therefore I would not be a good representative of the United\nStates Army, or United States, in Germany, because my hatred.",
        "Q: Did he -- did you talk to people about -- I mean, the war was over a few years, an-and\nyou were starting to get a little bit of distance from -- from those events. Did you talk to\npeople about what had happened to you during the Holocaust, or did they ask you about\nit?",
        "A: Oh yes. If I just take the officer candidate school, seven instructors asked me, and they\neven were so nice that if -- they said if you have any problems during examination time,\nthey were si -- going around checking, see everybody was honest during examination.\nAnd they even told me if you have any problems with the answers in English, write them\ndown in French or German, we\u2019ll figure it out. The other main instructor, same rank as\nthis prejudiced major, who asked me, counseled me, this was the highest rank in our\ngroup, major, he happened to be a war hero, who went to Korea, and was promoted twice\non the battlefield. Was a major, and was -- and -- and received two Silver Stars, which is\na high decoration, and he knew that this guy was prejudiced, and he talked to me a couple\nof times. And he in turn talked to a captain who also asked me, \u201cWhat did he ask you?\u201d\n106\nSo it became known among the other instructor, this guy\u2019s prejudiced. But in my case,\nnot in some of the other cases, they want to see me get through with this, and graduate,\nand they told me not to worry. And knowing this, that I had everybody else behind me, I\nwas able to go ahead, and not be intimidated, and they did a lot of things for me, to help\nme along.",
        "Q: So you were really -- it sounds like you were really on your own, as a -- as somebody\nwho is such a recent citizen. I mean that you -- that was really unusual at the time.",
        "A: It was unusual, it was stated also in g -- on -- on the graduation citation that I had been\nin a concentration camp, and that they -- I was the first one to go through. There had been\nother foreigners may -- foreign born people, but not one who had been in a concentration\ncamp for that long, and had escaped from a transport of -- of a concentration camp. And\nhad been for years, not just short while, imprisoned. And had outlived his time -- that\nnormally was people lived, if they worked for a year, and then they went down, you\nknow [indecipherable] and then I did this for three years, and prior to that, in the inter-\ninternment camps in France, which were not that bad, they didn\u2019t kill people, but some\npeople died from hunger, and so -- and then I had escaped actually twice, once 1n France,\nbut then I got caught there, and well they -- they explained all that. So they were very\nimpressed, I would say and -- and also I felt that -- that I had something tell my fellow\nofficers, that I was a good influence to my friends and colleagues, and they saw it from a\ndifferent viewpoint, they thought it was something, having been there, not hating the\nGermans, but that I could add something to it, which was actually true, because I was\n107\ninvolved once in writing up a plan in Korea, for prisoners of war, not to mistreat them,\nbecause we didn\u2019t do that, we went by the Geneva Convention, and because of my\nexperiences, I was very sensitive to when a guy becomes a prisoner, not like I became\none because I was a Jew, but to become the prisoner in the field, in -- 1n war time, that\nthey are not to be mistreated, or to interrogation -- what do you call that -- tortured. I was\nvery outspoken on that, and -- which all -- is the American way, we don\u2019t mistreat\nprisoners generally, and there were some exception, which also looked -- could have\nhappened -- when I said one time that somebody asked me this could happen here. I said,\n\u201cNot with our -- in our democracy, but there are people -- not the country, that would do\nbad things if not properly supervised, officers included.\u201d To wit, Lieutenant Calley in\nKorea -- in Viet -- in Vietnam, who killed women and children, who went to jail for a few\nyears, but in my opinion, that -- the case of Lieutenant Calley was that his superior\nofficer, a captain, should have been punished more than Lieutenant Calley, because he\nwas responsible for him, he knew what he was doing, and he should have stopped him.\nAnd he should have made a supply officer, not the combat officer up front, where he\ncould kill. Give him a job where he doesn\u2019t need his rifle. And during class on how to\ntreat prisoner of war, because the war in Korea was going on then, they gave us a case in\nschool, which they wanted us to solve. They say suppose you were in combat, and you\ntake Chinese, or Korean prisoners. And the day before you attacked, and you went in\nChinese position, and some of you -- your friends got captured by the Chinese, or the\nKoreans. And you knew that they got captured alive, and the next day you\u2019re on the\n108\nattack -- we -- we Americans are on the attack, and we overrun the Chinese position, and\nyou find the guys they were taken prisoners the day before shot in the head, their hands\nbound behind them. In other words, the Chinese shot the prisoners, your best friends,\nyour comrade. What would b-be your reaction? Well, we had different answers. When I -\n- came my turn, and the instructor asked me, well, somebody said we kill them, and it -- it\nhappened actually, that they got so upset about it during combat, that when they found\nthis -- this really happened that they got killed, with their hands bound behind their back,\nthat our troops went wild, and they took no Chinese prisoners, they shot them. Or in one\ncase, they had a few prisoners, and the lieutenant said to the sergeant, \u201cTake him back.\u201d\nTake him back was generally understood to a prisoner enclave, an enclosure to take them\nout of combat, and keep in a prison camp. But in this particular case, this officer always\nsaid, when he said to the sergeant take him back, he meant take him behind the hill, then\nexecute him. It happened. So he asked me, what would you do, this happened to your\nunit? You find out the sergeant take these guys over the hill, and you find out -- not your\norder, but you find the sergeant did this on his own. What would you do? Let it go on?\nAnd I said no. I would court mar -- if -- if a b -- I would prefer charges against the\nsergeant after the battle, and have him court martialed. \u201cIs that -- that is the proper\nprocedure, isn\u2019t it,\u201d I said, \u201cin the United States.\u201d The instructing officer said, \u201c\u201cThat\u2019s\ncorrect, that is our policy, but in doing this, you will destroy the fighting spirit of your\ntroops, and you have a morale problem, because you\u2019re stopping guys to get even with\nthe other side, who did that. And my answer would be close your eyes to it,\u201d -- and this\n109\nwas not the school\u2019s solution, this -- this was this instructor. He said, \u201cIt\u2019s my -- my\nsolution, not the school\u2019s solution. And if you court martial a guy after the battle 1s over,\nyour -- your -- the rest of your troops probably won\u2019t fight the way they\u2019re supposed to,\nbecause you\u2019re doing something against your own people.\u201d I say, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but we fight\nby the rules of the c -- Geneva convention, which are very humane, and a prisoner is\nsupposed to be taken back and put into an enclosure. When the war is finished, he\u2019s\nreleased.\u201d And if I have a problem with the morale of the troops, my job would be that\nafter the battle is over -- during the battle you can\u2019t do anything, you\u2019re in the heat of the\nbattle. You can\u2019t say that shooting\u2019s [indecipherable] stop this, or because you don\u2019t --\nwe don\u2019t do this. But after the battle is over, the next day or something, after everybody\nalready calmed down, say, \u201cWell, this what I witnessed yesterday. This not the way we\nfight a war, we don\u2019t execute prisoners, and I don\u2019t want to see this happen again.\u201d Not\nthreaten -- threaten him with a court martial, but just imply that you will take stern action\nif this [indecipherable] our side does it. And I finished up saying this discussion back and\nforth, they were back and forth. I say, \u201cIf we do this, we\u2019re not better than they are, even\nthat\u2019s revenge. And you don\u2019t do -- you don\u2019t kill a prisoner.\u201d So that [indecipherable]",
        "Q: When were you -- when were you in officer\u2019s school? Was that --",
        "A: This was in 1952.",
        "Q: Oh, okay.",
        "A: I graduated on my birthday, 15 August, 1952. The war was going on in Korea then.",
        "Q: And did you go to Korea after you graduated? What happened?\n110",
        "A: I was a lucky guy, yes I did. But the Korean [indecipherable] was coming the finish\nthe war, they gave up. No, I\u2019m kidding. I got there at the end of the war. I didn\u2019t have to\nfight anyone. But my instructors told me if I don\u2019t graduate from officer candidate\nschool, they will send me to Korea everybody else, and they have -- they would think that\nI would get a battlefield commission, having gone through the other thing. And I said,\n\u201cDon\u2019t do me any favors. I fought enough in my lifetime. If I have to go, I go, I do my\njob. But I don\u2019t want to become an officer by being courageous, or getting a medal, and\npost -- posthumously. After I went through this in Germany, I -- I don\u2019t need to die on a\nbattlefield here.\u201d",
        "Q: Was it hard at all for you to be known as this -- this survivor, among your fellow\nofficer candidate?",
        "A: No, on the contr -- on the contrary. They are very understanding, they ask me a lot of\nquestions. My roommate was a guy of Italian descent, this guy [indecipherable] and he\nalso change his name from an Italian name to -- his name was Nash, and he -- we\ncompliment -- compliment each other, and a lot of time discuss things. He was a great\nguy. And I had no problem being a -- I like to finish up by saying this thing. This major,\nwho tried to get me out of school, was not -- wasn\u2019t able to do this all the time. I -- \u2019'm\nsure he was stopped after this case, my case, which became more of less, not public, but\nthe officers talked among them and say this guy shouldn\u2019t be able to do that. Or I\u2019m sure\nthere were actually three majors, and the others were lower ranking, and two majors were\nfor me, and just this one guy against. And the two majors were for me were -- one was\n11]\nlike I said, a war hero, and a -- and the other was a very fine gentleman too, and they --\nthey ask me sometimes some questions, but not in detail, and they thought I was an asset.\nSo anyway, at -- at graduation they were all lined up, and I stepped down when I had my\nbars on, and you said good-bye to each one of the officers who were your instructors, and\n-- and saluted. And you were in the military, where you turned right, and formed a line.\nYou salute, you shook hands, turn right again, turn left again in front of the next guy,\nabout a dozen guys, and here was my major who [indecipherable]. I made two steps\ninstead of one step, and I stepped past him. I didn\u2019t salute him, and I didn\u2019t shake hands,\nor say anything to him. And I know that a lot of people watching, a lot of people knew\nmy dislike -- or his dislike, that we had a problem, but that I -- and I figured I was a -- an\ncommissioned officer now, although I was inferior to him, he -- that I was -- I wanted to\ndo that, I really -- I had planned this, I -- I didn\u2019t just do that on the spur of the moment. I\nsaid I\u2019m not going to salute. On the outside, I salute him, it\u2019s required, but here -- I won\u2019t\nmake an issue out of it. And nobody\u2019s going to say anything during a big ceremony. We\nhad a couple hundred people there. And particularly since I was cited [indecipherable]\nstage. And I\u2019m sure the general didn\u2019t know about it. He might have asking question\nafterwards, why didn\u2019t this lieutenant salute, or -- but they were too preoccupied with\nthings there. And -- so I figured well, everybody saw this, and the people that knew about\nit, they wonder what happened once the doors open, everybody was free to go, this guy\nwould come after me and tell me that was a bad thing. Some guys came over to me and\nsaid, \u201cBoy, I take my hat off for you. I know what\u2019s going on.\u201d And I said -- he never\n112\ncame to me, and he let me go. And I figure if he does, then he will make case of it, but\notherwise he -- maybe you\u2019 ve taught this lesson. And I always hoped that in the milikin --\nmilitary career I would run across him so I could really tell him off. I never did. I don\u2019t\nknow what happened to him, I don\u2019t -- so that was then. Can we stop for a minute?",
        "Q: Yeah. After s -- what happened after you graduated then? You went to Korea just\nbriefly?",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t go to Korea, I went to -- everyone went to a specialized school after you\nbecome a second lieutenant. You go to -- this was an infantry officer\u2019s school, that was\nyour basic instruction, whereas other guys went to F-Fort Knox, if they wanted to be in\ntanks. They would then be tank officers. And there was another school to become an\nartillery officer, and one more to be -- infantry, artillery, tanks, and -- yeah, that was it.\nOh yeah, and -- and th-the four -- and the other branch was branch [indecipherable], you\nwere assigned to a branch afterward. You could be assigned to a branch right away, then\nyou went to your branch school to be specialized. You were an ordinance officer, which\nmeant repairing tanks or guns. You went to the ordinance school at -- it\u2019s outside\nWashingham. In my case, I was trained as a combat infantry officer, but I wasn\u2019t\nspecialized as such. I -- I -- my desire was to go into Intelligence because I spoke\nlanguages, and had served with [indecipherable]. So my desire was really to catch spies,\npeople who were stealing our secrets, in this case the Russians were good at that, and our\nside had to find out who these people were to catch them. And that was the intent, that\nwas my plan, to be a counter-Intelligence officer. But that\u2019s not what you become right\n113\naway in the army, you become an Intelligence officer, period. You do first Intelligence\nwork. Not secretly maybe, and sit in the staff, or in an office. And so that\u2019s what I\nintended to be. And I went for six months then, to two schools -- actually eight months.\nNo, six and a half -- six and a half months. I went to Fort Lee, Virginia, and I wound up\nat a course in there I had not intended to take. The last course I took was aerially -- a-\naerially supply. Aerially supply meant for the paratroopers who come -- some out of\nairplanes, but not that. But to -- we supply these guys by air, too. Somebody was\nsurrounded in a battle, like it happened in World War two. They needed guns,\nammunition, first aid, doctors, so they would have to jump over an area where these guys\nwere surrounded, and therefore you needed aerially supplied. So I took that course, and\nwhat it amounted to is jet plane that could be opened up from the rear -- by the rear door,\nnot on the side, and supplies were stacked up in the plane, and you had to shove them out.\nAnd they either came down by parachute over a target, or the plane flew -- flew so low,\njust above ground, like a couple of feet, and would had to be a skillful pilot, and these --\naerially supply officer would be inside the plane to see to it that it got pushed out on time,\nover the target, not over the enemies side, that he would get our supplies, and so I took\nthat course. When I was finished [indecipherable] I wanted to go to Germany. I was\ncalled to an office in the Pentagon, and there was an officer of Chinese ancestry. He was\ncivilian Intelligence officer, he turned out to be a former aide de camp of General\nWainwright, who was the -- we called Vinegar Joe, who fought in Asia during World\nWar two. And very famous, he was in charge there. And this guy that talked to me in the\n114\nPentagon was his aide, Chinese American. He was aide during World War two, and he\nspoke Chinese, and he was at the young age of 27, a lieutenant colonel, because a\ngeneral\u2019s aide. And when I met him, he was civilian Intelligence officer working for the\narmy, and he was my sponsor, if you like. And they wanted me to go to Korea. Of course,\nthat\u2019s where the action was at that time, and I told him that I would like to go to\nGermany, because I know the language, and he said to me that, \u201cOh, you\u2019re not married\nnow, and every officer has to go initially to Korea.\u201d The war was still going on, we didn\u2019t\nknow when it was going to be finished. \u201cAnd it\u2019s better to go now while you\u2019re not\nmarried, because you may be thinking about getting married, and then you have to leave\nyour wife at home for a year. But go now while you\u2019re single, have a good time, if you\u2019re\nnot in combat.\u201d And I said, \u201cOkay.\u201d He said he\u2019II guarantee me that I go to Germany wh\n-- after I come back from Korea. I\u2019m glad I took his advice. I could have insisted I go\nGermany, when -- talk to somebody else and -- but he appreciate I didn\u2019t go over his\nhead, and made a big thing out of it. I went to Korea, and he saw to it that I got a position\nin Korea which was -- called for an officer with th-two grades higher than I was, a major\nEnd of Tape Five, Side A\nBeginning Tape Five, Side B",
        "A: -- went on a troopship, and on the troopship to go into Korea, we went first to\nOkinawa, and I was given a job on the ships as a -- being a compartment commander, and\nthe troops sleep on the troopship four -- four beds high, o-one on top of another, filled\n115\nwith people. We had a lot of problems, guys getting seasick, including myself, but -- and\nmessing up the place, and then other people get sick, well, I took some action by having\n-- having teams go topside, get fresh air, go down and change -- put another\n[indecipherable] and I kept my place very clean. And I got commended by the top guy\nthere, and well, wh-when I arrived in Korea, I -- I was given a letter of recommendation -\n- | forget 1 -- I\u2019m a very -- what\u2019d they say, a very active, or -- I wa -- I was an action\nofficer, what they -- one --not just sits by and watches. So anyway, it was a go -- I -- I\ncame there, bu -- good thing -- also I had my dog on board, which was illegal by the\narmy. The army said no pets to Korea. And I didn\u2019t have anybody, no parents, no -- and I\ndidn\u2019t know what to do with my dog, I -- somebody advised me, \u201cTake him to Seattle, to\nthe port, see the captain of the ship, of the troop transport, because he 1s navy, you are\narmy. The army told you no pets to Korea, but the navy might think different. And you --\nif the navy gives you permission, the ships under -- under navy control. Maybe you\u2019 ll\nfind a captain that\u2019s sympa --.\u201d And I was lucky, I went to Seattle two days ahead of time\nwith my dog. I went up to the ship, I knew the ship I was going to sail on. Saw the\ncaptain of the ship, and I said, \u201cCaptain, I have a dog that I feel very strong about, and I\nwa-want to take to Korea. But the army has regulations that say no, you can\u2019t take any\npets to Korea.\u201d He said, \u201cThat\u2019s the army.\u201d Just like somebody from -- \u201cI don\u2019t give a\ndamn about army regulations. The ship 1s -- I\u2019m the captain, I\u2019m [indecipherable]. You\nwant to bring your dog on board, bring him on board. But bring him one day before\ntroops come on board.\u201d I did. I was lucky, I'd prefabricated a dog house which could be\n116\ntaken apart in no time, just a couple of screws. I came on board, the captain al -- sees me,\ngave me a corner for my dog. And I brought my dog into Korea. I had [indecipherable].",
        "Q: When did you get -- just a little sideline, but when did you get your first dog after the\nwar, and what made you decide to do it?",
        "A: What -- I won -- I won\u2019t say a long story, but I -- I was lonely. No parents, no wife.\nThat actually is a thing I really didn\u2019t talk about because it\u2019s too long, and too -- too\ninvolved, and very personal, I think, it -- what one goes through when you\u2019re lonely, or\nwhen you have everybody killed in the family. And I was just like -- the dog to me was\nlike a member of the family, and there were two things that I did to remain sane, actually,\nand to -- not to -- I couldn\u2019t stay behind closed doors was one thing. I all -- I -- even\ntoday I leave the doors open in my house. I go to the toilet, I don\u2019t close the door if it\u2019s\njust my family that\u2019s in the house -- not when there are other people, because I don\u2019t like\nclosed doors. And I didn\u2019t like that before, and I just -- I -- I -- in the camps, you always\nhad comas, people who were the same boat, and my whole story with Michael Swab is\nthe same thing. I had a buddy, I had somebody who -- who felt like I did. And when I\nwas in the army then as an officer, it\u2019s sometimes lonely, because you are maybe the only\nofficer, and you are with the men, but they\u2019re not on an equal level with you, you still\nlonely. So I wung -- wasn\u2019t going to do that. I said, well, even my first sergeant was a\nman 20 years older than myself. When we were in private together, I ask him to call me\nby my first name, not say Lieutenant Willner, or sir -- he\u2019s 20 years older. So I made up\nfor some of this loneliness by doing certain things, and the other thing that they didn\u2019t\n117\ntalk about was having girlfriends. I got involved with other women. I was lonely. And I\nalso, since I was -- since my liberation, I -- I wanted to get married, but I knew I didn\u2019t\nhave an education, I didn\u2019t have a job, or -- in the re -- once I was in the army, I figured,\nwell, a lieutenant doesn\u2019t make much money, but I'll wait til I'll be a captain or so. But I\nwanted to get married, and have children. And I -- there was part, getting married fast,\nnot to be lonely any more. But I said to myself, I must find the right woman, because be\nvery difficult to be married to a concentration camp survivor. You have your\nidiosyncrasies, maybe. But other people have too, who were -- who were not in camp, but\nthere are certain things that we do have. I\u2019m aware -- I\u2019m aware of it. Some people don\u2019t\nknow it, my f -- my best friend, Michael Swab, his whole life, whenever he was with me,\nor alone, walking the street, he look -- he look over his shoulder. He did this all the time,\neven after he got married, because he always thought some Gestapo or somebody was\nfollowing him, that he was being -- so, that was a problem he had, not -- not a big\nproblem, but so I observed him one time doing that. And some people had, like I said,\nidiosyncrasies. They also had -- think they are very bad. I must al -- also say that, since I\nwas very close to Michael Swab, that he beat his second wife. And she told me one time,\nwhen she was -- when they were visiting here, and I -- I was really shook up, and so I\ndecided -- I told my wife, and she said she knows, and thought that was terrible. When\nyou got upset about something, instead of arguing with wife -- I argue with my wife, but\nthen we clear it up before the end of the day, if it\u2019s not cleared up right away. But he beat\nhis wife, so he was -- some of the real bad things from the camps, he took with him, and\n118\nhe applied it to -- so I -- I couldn\u2019t -- this was terrible. I decided I will go with him under\nfalse pretense and talk to him about it, very seriously. Because we had no secrets for each\nother. And I took him to the Potomac River, near -- in a secluded area, nice day. I said,\n\u201cMichael, I got you up here because I want to talk to you. I don\u2019t want anybody around.\nAnd I want to tell -- to tell you -- you beat your wife.\u201d I had to be careful because he -- he\nwould know that she told me or my wife, and that he\u2019|l beat up again. \u201cI -- I-I -- and this\nI-I cannot be quiet about. And you know, we\u2019ve always been very truthful to each other,\nand that is not a thing that I -- that you should do. There\u2019s no excuse for it. Absolutely\nnone, you ca -- tell me anything you want, but I-I will not accept it. You don\u2019t beat your\nwife, you don\u2019t beat women, and I don\u2019t have to tell you why not, you don\u2019t do.\u201d He\nnever said one word. He didn\u2019t say yes, no, or it\u2019s none of your business, which he\nwouldn\u2019t have said. And that was it. So anyway, my loneliness -- oh yeah, finding\n[indecipherable] wife. After I was 19, and out, every woman I went out with, or I was\nintimate with, I always considered, not marrying her, but what am I looking for besides\nsex\u2019? She had to have certain qualities that -- maybe more qualities because I went\nthrough the camps, but particularly because I went through the camps. Have\n[indecipherable] and I start making up a list. Get organized was always m-my way of\ndoing things. And I wind up with good point and the bad points, what I want to see. And I\ngave each question a point, and when I came up with more good points than bad points, I\n-- would she be a good wife? But it was just still a little game I was playing with myself,\nbut I didn\u2019t ge -- consulted anybody else, but -- but needless to say, but I -- I -- I did get\n119\ninvolved with quite a few girls, and didn\u2019t make any difference what religion, or -- I did\nhave one thing I do want to mention. I was a-always very fond of the French language,\nand everybody would have bet that Pll marry a French woman, so I could sp-speak\nFrench all the time. And I -- I thought so, too [indecipherable] my ol -- my oldest son just\nwent to -- they had the 50 anniversary of the Normandy invasion in Europe. He and\nanother officer went to France, and took some pictures there on the beaches there where\nwe landed. And they still have some tank obstacles there. And I had to laugh, because he\nvisited that, he took pictures, and I said, \u201cI was there, too.\u201d He said, \u201cI know where you\nwere at that time.\u2019 He knows exactly where I was. \u201cNo,\u201d I said, \u201canother time I was\nthere, not during the invasion.\u201d When I was in the army, as a criminal investigator, I had\na case, which took me to Karankan, France, which is right behind the beaches where we\nlanded during the invasion. And my son [indecipherable] Karankan, but when I was there\nI met a French girl, and I stayed with her for a couple of days, and then I said, the same\ntime I visit the beaches, and I have a picture with her standing next to the tank\nobstruction. They\u2019re not -- they\u2019re not bodies any more, but there are certain things that\nyou can still see why -- what we encountered there. And -- and on the back it said the\nplace, and the year, the -- and he said [indecipherable] the same place, but not like you\nprobably. So, what I\u2019m trying to say is that I -- I was never alone by doing this, and I\ncame -- I never came -- oh, I was engaged once, to a Jewish girl from Detroit, because I\nwent to the chapel, to Jewish services here -- the military chapel, and I met this man, and\nhe introduced me to his niece, who was visiting from Detroit. She had just graduated\n120\nfrom high school, she\u2019s very cute, and I started dating her a couple a -- they wanted me to\ndate her. I was 26 when I graduate from officer\u2019s school, and the average age was 22,\nguys who [indecipherable] from college. I was a little bit older than the rest of them, also\na little maturer. But I dated her, and I got seriously thinking about marrying her. I\nintroduced her to my relatives in New York, and I -- the one who was against German,\nthe daughter I\u2019d mentioned before, that she lectured me I shouldn\u2019t marry a German, and\nI didn\u2019t tell the rest of the story, I just will -- didn\u2019t want to [indecipherable]. I -- I was\ngoing to break off my alle -- my -- with my cousin, you know, but my wife came to New\nYork to get her citizenship, three weeks after we got married, she met my cousin, and my\ncousin fell in love with her. She loved her, and the -- the one [indecipherable]",
        "Q: The same cousin who had said -- uh-huh -- said don\u2019t --",
        "A: Marry a German.",
        "Q: -- marry a German. Uh-huh.",
        "A: And I was going to break up with her [indecipherable]. Well, that was okay. So she\nmet her, and there were no more problems. My wife still talked to her, and din -- din --\nshe didn\u2019t throw it up. And -- so back to -- to a girl I got engaged to. She was okay, her\nfamily was okay in New Jersey, but then I was supposed to meet her parents -- excuse me\n-- in -- in Detroit, and I went there, and I had just graduated from officer\u2019s school, I was\nvery proud to have made it, and to have a career maybe, ahead of me, and to have\nsucceeded, and all that stuff, okay. So -- also I -- I probably looked pretty good in\nuniform as an officer at the time. And so she was impressed, probably, but I found out\n12]\nshe was okay, but maybe too immature, just graduated from high school, and I was very\nmature. I could have handled it, but could she handle it, a difficult guy like me? No, but --\nI wasn\u2019t difficult, but I -- I did have certain things I -- I -- the thing came a-abo-about in a\nway that I did not expect it to break off our engagement, but it was the right thing, I was\nlucky. When I visited her parents, they approved of me, and the father took me aside, say\ngoodnight, and said to me, \u201cYou -- you are going to Korea I understand.\u201d I -- [ -- I\nexpected to be ordered to Korea, I didn\u2019t know yet for sure. I said, \u201cYes.\u201d He said, \u201cWhat\n-- what do you want to be, a defender of capitalism?\u201d And he talked to me in the way a\nCommunist was talk -- would talk. And he was entitled to his opinion, but that was my\ncountry, I had went through hard times getting there, and I -- what he basically said that I\nshouldn\u2019t be an officer of an im-imperialist army. And I said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to give up\nmy career be that I\u2019ve practically fought for it,\u201d I went -- so I told him that I was not\ngoing to leave the army, and I could also called it I\u2019m a defender of a democracy. And I\ndidn\u2019t argue with him, but just discuss it. But those were his words, actually, defender of\ncapitalism. So I said to myself afterwards, I\u2019ve nothing against the girl, nothing against\nher parents as people, but this bother me. So knowing that I would be going to Korea, I\nsaid to myself, under normal circumstances, if I\u2019m married, and going to Korea, my wife,\nif I have no children, would either go back to her parents, or probably to my parent\u2019s\nhouse, and live with them til I come back from Korea, and then we have a house, or su --\napartment. So I said, well, I don\u2019t have parents. I don\u2019t have anybody. She will be with\nher parents while I\u2019m in Korea, and every day she\u2019ll hear from her father, \u201cWhat kind of\n122\nlife is this? Your husbands the other end of the world, you\u2019re here, and he\u2019s defending\nimperialism th -- over there in Korea.\u201d And before I know it, before I get back after a\nyear, I have a divorce on my hands. I said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to get married.\u201d This -- she --\nshe going to be under influence of her parents. She\u2019s young. If she had made up her own\nmind, be a different story. If she\u2019d [indecipherable] living with a girlfriend, but her\nintention was to stay on with her parents. And I think she\u2019ll be hearing this all the time.\nI\u2019m not going to start -- I want to get married once, and [indecipherable] and not get\ndivorced. So she had to be the right woman, and I felt she wasn\u2019t the right one, so I broke\nit off. I felt very bad about it, and my aunt told me -- this woman who was against the\nmarriage, \u201cWell Eddie, it\u2019s better to feel bad for a couple of months, than feeling bad the\nrest of your life.\u201d And I agreed with her. I went to Korea, but I had, shortly before Korea\n-- well, this really doesn\u2019t matter, I met another woman, and I\u2019m mentioning this not just\nto mention I went out with women, but that I -- the specific circumstance. I -- when I\nwent to Germany one time [indecipherable] the first time, as an enlisted man, I went to\ncriminal investigation school, I mentioned that. And on the train I met a British girl, who\nwas traveling with her mother from England to southern Germany. And I got to talk to\nher, and she said her mother was Jewish. So she was half Jewish, and that her father had\ndivorced the mother under the nur -- Nuremberg laws. And -- but he wasn\u2019t a Nazi, but\nhe took advantage of the Nuremberg laws. And he left Germany, too, he went to South\nAmerica someplace, with the two boys. And he left the mother and the daughter in\nGermany, they got a -- they got to England. So when I met th-the mother, I was re-\n123\nvisiting friends, and I didn\u2019t know that her daughter who was traveling there, was married\nat that time. I didn\u2019t expect a woman, traveling with her mother, that she was married.\nShe never told me about it, and she came to visit me at the school on weekends. That was\nnear Munich, Germany. I got involved with her, and -- and when I went to Korea, she\ntold me -- she asked me what I was going to do, I said, \u201cWell, I have four weeks of\nvacation. Since I\u2019m not engaged any more, I don\u2019t have any plans.\u201d She said -- and I still\ndidn\u2019t know she was married at the time. She said, \u201cIf you would come visit me.\u201d I said\nyes. She, I think, took four weeks. We got [indecipherable] around the [indecipherable]\nand couple other places, and then she told me she was married, but that she\u2019s going to\ndivorce her husband. And we had not talked about marriage, she and I, we just -- and to\nme it was another attraction. I -- I had -- not going to say that her on my list of\nprospective future wife, particularly just -- she was married, too. And I had no intention\ngo out with a married woman, or -- because my time was valuable, and I figured a\nmarried woman, that\u2019s probably just for sex. But some ba -- maybe I'll marry her, maybe\nnot. Not her -- not the British girl. So we were together four weeks, and I s -- said at the\nend of four weeks, \u201cDon\u2019t wait for me to come back from Korea, even if you get\ndivorced, I\u2019m not going to marry you.\u201d Because it was her intention would get to know\nme better, and I thought -- I never thought one moment I would marry her. And there was\nnothing wrong with her, except whatever the problem was between her husband, she told\nme what it was. And so I knew from the beginning I was just spending -- having a good\ntime, and she was having a good time. So, when we left on last day, we said good-bye for\n124\ngood, and I was on my way to Korea -- after a couple of days, she asked me, in England,\nif you -- you can only get a divorce, which she still wanted to get, if you commit adultery\n-- you admit to adultery. And when she talked about adultery, I said, \u201cWell, in my book,\nmy dictionary, it said adultery is two wrong people doing a right thing.\u201d And -- and so I\ntried to keep -- keep a happy atmosphere, you know? To her it was just good-bye for\ngood. Well, to me, too, but it was no -- no problem for me. She had still hopes that I\nwould -- she was going to divorce her husband, maybe I\u2019 Il be interested. She -- so she\nwent back to England, I went to Korea. All of a sudden -- well, she asked me if I would\nhelp her in -- in her divorce, because she can onl -- if she admits adultery in court, then\nshe can divorce. But I figure I\u2019m single, I have no problem. I have no wife -- adultery, not\nthat I say it\u2019s okay, but she committed adultery, but I didn\u2019t [indecipherable]. I said,\n\u201cSure, you can -- if that helps.\u201d And I was in Korea, I got a letter from the British court,\nfrom a judge, that she swore in court that she committed adultery with me, and they want\nto know whether it was true or not. And I found myself in a situation in Korea, I said -- I\ndidn\u2019t think that far. An officer in the United States army, you\u2019re not supposed to commit\nadultery. An officer and a gentleman, they always put that gentleman in there. You know,\na gentleman in my book is a man who di -- who\u2019ll defend a woman from any man but\nhimself, that\u2019s a gentleman. But so I -- I was in -- I -- what do you call that, in a -- I\ncouldn\u2019t --",
        "Q: Bind.\n125",
        "A: Ina bind. So I say, if I don\u2019t answer the letter, they going to write to the Pentagon in\nWashington, trying to find Lieutenant Willner, and they\u2019Il write what it\u2019s all about. It\u2019s a\nquestion adultery, and then the army\u2019s going to question me. And I\u2019m not doing the right\nthing, they\u2019re going to kick me out. So what do I do? I had two sleepless nights in Korea,\nand it came to me all of a sudden. I said, I must answer this letter, but I will not admit to\nadultery, because the army [indecipherable] they were very strong on that at that time, not\n-- not -- now it happens all the time, guys get with their fellow officers of lower ranking,\nand used to read in the papers, generals get kicked out, and so it was much more serious\nthan now, now it\u2019s -- okay, so anyway -- but I cannot say I didn\u2019t, because she swore in\ncourt that she did. I\u2019Il call her a liar, which she wasn\u2019t, she was telling the truth. And I\nwouldn\u2019t tell a lie. So I sent a one sentence letter to the British court, I said, \u201cI will\nneither deny nor admit it.\u201d That puts her in the clear, and I didn\u2019t do anything. If the army\ncomes [indecipherable] end of it. So that just on the sideline. We go further. When I came\nfrom -- back from Korea, and I was in -- actually, before moving to Japan, I was on\nteedeewhy, in Japan, on temporary duty, because the war is finished, and we didn\u2019t have\nanything to do. I had my men, they were bored. I studied the countryside in Korea a little\nbit, and I went to Tokyo, I was ordered to Tokyo to take care of some small job, and I\nwas one day -- this very funny. I was one day in the men\u2019s room, doing my business, and\na general was standing next to me doing his business, and he said, \u201cOh, you -- you are\nLieutenant Willner.\u201d I said, \u201cYeah.\u201d He saw my red name tags on. \u201cWell, when you\nfinish, stop by my office.\u201d I had gone to officer candidate school with his son, who was\n126\nnot going to be a professional officer, but as a favor to his father, he became an officer --\na reserve officer. And his -- I had met him once before, with his son, who took me home\nwith him, and -- so I thought he wanted to chat about his son, or what we doing -- or we\ndone since [indecipherable]. So what he said, \u201cYou were here in Tokyo once before from\nKorea. What for?\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d I said, \u201cthey have some stuff to be -- files to clean out\n[indecipherable], and we didn\u2019t have anything to do in Korea, the war is finished.\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d he said, \u201cthe army\u2019s spending a lot of money having you -- you and a couple of\nguys come to Japan and take care of -- why don\u2019t we transfer you over here, and you do it\nhere? Because eventually bi -- in Korea we have less and less troops, the war is finished.\u201d\nI said, \u201cGeneral, that\u2019s nice, but my plan is to pick up an education, I like education to\nremain active as an officer, and I want to go back to the States from Korea directly, and\nthen enroll in some courses, night courses, or whatever. And I wanted to go to\nWashington.\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d he said, \u201clet\u2019s do first things first.\u201d \u201cAlso, if I go to Japan, I must\nstay much longer. Here, my year is finished, I go back.\u201d The rules were that you stayed\ntwo years in a place where there\u2019s no war. [indecipherable] go to Korea for\n[indecipherable] one ma -- one year ago, yeah, and then -- actually 1t was nine mon --\nnine months there, in Japan. So they said, \u201cOkay, we\u2019ll give you a special deal. You talk\nto my deputy, and we\u2019 ll transfer your unit to -- to Japan. And I'll --.\u201d",
        "Q: Maybe we should continue on the next tape, cause we\u2019re about to get cut off.\nEnd of Tape Five, Side B\n127\nBeginning Tape Six, Side A",
        "A: I went with my unit to Japan, and everybody was very happy, including myself,\nbecause I wanted to get to know Japan, and I knew I didn\u2019t have to stay for two years in\nJapan. So I stayed nine months in Japan, def -- s -- fixed up my papers saying that they\nagree that I should pick up some courses, that wasn\u2019t -- Japan wasn\u2019t the place\n[indecipherable] might be, and I should then go back, which I did. And I -- and I had nine\nwonderful months in Japan, in Tokyo. And I transferred back to United States, to\nWashington. I was assigned to -- as an assistant to the commandant of the command\nmanagement school at Fort Belwah, which is right outside Washington. And I was living\nat Fort Meyer. Fort Meyer is -- was very nice. That was just for living purposes for me,\nand I commuted every day to Fort Belwah. One year after that, I was assigned to\nHeidelberg, Germany, to the headquarter of the U.S. Army, Europe, where I had been\nbefore as an enlisted man, a criminal investigator, and now I came back as an officer.\nAnd I knew the place, I liked the place. Heidelberg is a very romantic place, very\nbeautiful. The Nekile river flows, there\u2019s an old castle there, and the Americans always\npicked a nice place to put up their headquarters. It was in a bombed out, very romantical.\nAnd there was a university there. It was a famous place, and also good to be stationed. So\nI was assigned there as chief of the analiss section for technical Intelligence. It was a staff\nofficer\u2019s Jo -- assignment, and -- which was good for my record, and my boss was an\nItalian American, lieutenant colonel, whom I got along with very well, but actually, I\nfound out when I -- shortly before going to Germany, that I was supposed to go to Berlin.\n128\nAnd I got this letter from this colonel, and it said, \u201cDue to unso -- foreseen\ncircumstances, you are coming to my headquarters in Heidelberg.\u201d And I didn\u2019t mind.\nBerlin would have been okay with me, too. And my old friend George Strauss was there\nalready, and it would have been interesting in that we were -- would have been -- he -- he\nalready was, George Strauss, a detachment commander, which means you are your own\nboss, you have so many men, and you direct the unit. It\u2019s very much in demand in the\narmy to get ahead, to be the commander of a unit, which I was going to be, but when I\nwent to Heidelberg, I was a staff officer, not a commander of a unit. But that was okay,\ntoo. I got into a position where I had a little bit of supervision. My boss had supervision\nover my friend George Strauss. But my boss, Colonel Skolie, was retiring pretty soon\nfrom the army, and he didn\u2019t care any more about what\u2019s going on, he didn\u2019t want to be\nbothered, un there was something bad going on, and he always told me, \u201cWillner, you\ntake care of it.\u201d And I would call j -- my friend George Strauss in Berlin, and say, the\ncolonel said to do this or do that. He never did, he left 1t up to me to s -- act in his name.\nAnd it was a good arrangement, and I liked it, and George Strauss didn\u2019t know that -- I\ntold him afterwards, I said, \u201cThe colonel never said any such thing, I was making these\nup.\u201d And he was m -- ma -- it was okay with him. And so, after I got assigned to\nHeidelberg, to Colonel Skolie, he had a habit of going every morning for coffee to the\nofficer\u2019s club at 10 o\u2019clock, and he asked me to come along with him. And we sat down,\nhad our cup of coffee [indecipherable] was little bit of exercise, since always sitting\nbehind a desk, and then -- so Colonel Skolie, the first two weeks, he was watching me\n129\nlike a hawk while drinking coffee. And I looked around the young women, and he said\n[indecipherable] to me, \u201cWell, you probably noticed that I watch you.\u201d I said, \u201cYes, I\ndid.\u201d \u201cWell, there\u2019s a reason for it. The guy you are replacing, we had to get rid of him,\nhe was kicked out of the army. He turned out to be a homosexual officer, and he got\ncaught in something. That\u2019s why you were changed from Berlin, to -- to replace him here\nin my headquarters. And I\u2019m very much pleased that you are interested in girls.\u201d So he --\nhe was afraid he gets another guy who was a homosexual. It was not very common, but it\n-- it did happen. So Colonel Skolie had -- once before in his career had another\nhomosexual. He was afraid himself that someone might think he might be ac/dc, that the\narmy is going to check him. But he wasn\u2019t, he was a Catholic, with a Protestant wife, and\nhe had a good marriage, but except for religion. He insisted on going to Catholic church,\nand she insisted going with the children -- well, he was a very nice guy. So here I was in\nHeidelberg, and he was happy that I was not a homosexual, you know, I was very much\ninterested in girls, and I started dating like mad. I met my wife after three months there.\nIn those three months, before I met my wife, I had gone out with three different girls, and\nhad a good time, and one of them was a -- woman was in the PX -- I don\u2019t know you\nknow what the PX 1s, sales girl. And when I got married she was a saleslady who\nadvised my wife what -- what she\u2019ll buy. Well, she knows I\u2019m going to get married, but -\n- and she was just a girl, German girl that just want to get married to an American. And\nwat -- when I met my wife was in the headquarters in the office, a very interesting, I\u2019m\nnot going to tell the whole story, but I knew immediately, and I -- like I said I was in\n130\nmeantime going from 19 to 31 years, 12 years a long time, and I had -- in the meantime, I\nhad a couple of girls I might have considered, including my fianc\u00e9e. But when I met my\nwife, after three months I ask her to marry. I was three months in Heidelberg, and another\nthree months that I met her.",
        "Q: Did you do the list for your wife?",
        "A: Yup.",
        "Q: Must have turned out pretty well.",
        "A: Probably a hundred. No, no we -- but I was particularly interested in her opinion about\nthe Nazis, and she was working in these headquarters, in another floor, in a big building,\nand I watch her once in awhile. And a lot of girls were dating American soldiers, and I\nlooked, and she didn\u2019t date, or talk to any American soldiers. She wasn\u2019t one of those that\njust want to get married to an American, and to have a boyfriend. And so I said hello to\nher a couple of times, and she didn\u2019t seem to be interested very much. And I was, in\nmeeting her, because she wasn\u2019t dating anybody, I know that -- well, she could have\ndated a German outside that I didn\u2019t know about, but you -- and so when she was\nworking -- only when she wasn\u2019t studying, but she didn\u2019t have any money to continue her\nstudy in Heidelberg. She wanted -- she majored in foreign languages, and she knew\nItalian, and some Russian, and English very well, of course, and she had a job that she\nhad to know English for, and so she interrupt her studies every time she didn\u2019t have any\nmoney, she s -- worked up there. And I could visit her in her office, but she couldn\u2019t visit\nme in my office, because that was cofe -- classified secret, the door, you couldn't get in,\n131\nsomebody had to open up on the other side. So to meet her -- she didn\u2019t seem to be much\ninterested meeting me. I figure I\u2019Il meet her. I ask her one time -- oh yeah, the first thing\nthat happened, I -- there was a trial in Heidelberg over the SS -- who -- who was born in\nHeidelberg, they caught him after the war, he was a -- not -- not high-ranking, a simple\nguy, who had -- who was accused of having killed three people. They didn\u2019t -- didn\u2019t say\nJews or not Jews, but he was an SS, but they weren\u2019t sure they could prove it, and the\nonly one and the -- that they caught in Heidelberg, who was a native of Heidelberg. But\nwhen I read the story in the paper, I read that what he did before he became an SS. He\nwas street sweeper in Heidelberg, a guy, very simple, no education -- very little educa --\nand a guy with probably inferiority complex, who all of a sudden became an SS, with a\nnice uniform, looked sharp, but was dumb, not educated. And was somebody all of a\nsudden, and then beat up Jews, or whatever. He was a member of the elite in Germany.\nAnd I looked at it and said, \u201cThey ought to cor --,\u201d I said to myself, \u201cthey ought to catch\nthe big guys, not a small guy like him.\u201d Some of the mass murderers, and n-not\n[indecipherable] people. And I decided I wanted to see a trial. I didn\u2019t know the guy, he\nwas not in the camp I was in, and -- but I was just curious how the German courts were\ndoing with a guy like that. So I told my boss I wanted to go that day -- I want a day off, I\nwant to go to court, I need you okay that. And I went out the door. My wife started going\nout the door, too from a different [indecipherable]. I said, \u201cWhere are you going, Miss\nSuberchess?\u201d And she has a Latin name [indecipherable] in Germany during the Middle\nAges, only the doctors, teachers, and the pe-people who could read and write, they spoke\n132\nLatin, not German, educated people. And her family was a gen -- m-mainly a family of\nteachers. So I said, \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d She said she\u2019s going to court. \u201cOh,\u201d I said,\n\u201cI\u2019m going to court, too.\u201d I said, \u201cWhat -- what kind of a crime did you commit?\u201d I was\ntrying to make a joke.[indecipherable] \u201cI didn\u2019t commit a crime, but I\u2019m just watch a\ntrial.\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019m watching a trial, too. What kind of a trial, are you a witness, then?\u201d No,\nshe didn\u2019t want to tell me right away. And it came out she\u2019s going the same place I was.\nAnd I couldn\u2019t think of a reason why a German girl would be interested in SS, unless she\nwas a relative, or something. So I ask her, \u201c\u201cWhy are you interested in SS?\u201d And she gave\nme the -- a reason, the same reason that I was interested in it. See how justice is done in\nGermany today. So that got me interested in her, more than just for other reasons, and a\nyoung woman is interested in -- in Nazis, and [indecipherable]. And I said, \u201cOkay, you\nwant a ride?\u201d She was going by bicycle, I had my car, and is that okay? She accepted a\nride, and the -- excuse me [indecipherable]. So we got to the court, I parked my car, I --\nlike I said, I was in uniform, and came out with her, and there\u2019s a -- a guard or some guy\nup there by the doors on the courtroom, and the courtroom is filled already with people,\ncomplete -- the guy said, \u201cCan\u2019t go in, it\u2019s full.\u201d Well, I figured I am an officer in the\nUnited States army, they lost the war, I\u2019m going to go in, no matter what. And I -- and I\nspoke German. So I said to the guard, \u201cWho gave you your order that you can\u2019t let an\nAmerican army officer in?\u201d \u201cOh,\u201d he said, \u201cthey didn\u2019t tell me an American army officer,\nthey said nobody goes in.\u201d \u201cWell, I -- | am sorry, but you will make a place for me. I'll --\n, and there was my future wife, left out. I couldn\u2019t speak for her, that -- give her a seat,\n133\nbut I, as an army officer had -- was considered maybe -- they -- they -- they figured we\nhad -- we won the war, and we wer -- demanded certain things, but I wasn\u2019t normally\ndoing that, but I was insisting here, in this case. Make a long story short, my wife didn\u2019t\ngo into the court, and this guy told a German civilian to leave, that he had to make some\nspace for some important people. But only me, and I sat up there, and I listened to an\nunimpressive to -- trial. The guy -- I almost felt sorry for the guy -- the former -- he was a\nbeat up old -- well, not old man, but he was, at that time I\u2019m going to see him an old man,\nbecause I was only 30 and something, and he was 45 or something. Well, they couldn\u2019t\nprove actually, any murder, but he admitted having been SS, having been in certain place,\nand had beaten up people, and to -- but not -- they couldn\u2019t prove that he murdered\npeople. So he got a couple of months in jail. That was standard throughout Germany\n[indecipherable]. But I -- 1t bothered me. I said, \u201cHere is a guy who probably had an\ninferiority complex. In the concentration camp he could beat up professors and doctors,\nand people who were more intelligent, and more educated than he was, because he had no\neducation. And he got caught. But the big biggies, they were free. And I sa -- I thought\nthat the guys who were over him should be sitting in -- in the docket there then. Well, I\ncan\u2019t say I\u2019m s -- I felt sorry for him, but I -- I -- I have -- didn\u2019t think that was -- he\nshouldn\u2019t be sitting there, that somebody else should be. Okay, that\u2019s Heidelberg. So then\nwe come to a long story, and I do want to say -- to be [indecipherable] how I finally got\nto marry my wife, what problems there were involved, on the part of the Americans, on\n134\nthe part of the Germans, on the part of her family, on the part religion, politics, east, west,\ncombination --",
        "Q: You did -- just to remind you, you did talk earlier on in the interview, just as a\ndigression yesterday about the problems with the army, about how you weren\u2019t supposed\nto marry a foreign -- a foreigner, particularly a German, because of your -- your work\nwith secret materials. So that part\u2019s been covered.",
        "A: Th-That is ma --",
        "Q: But the rest, it would be good to hear.",
        "A: But 1-it\u2019s a long story, with a rabbi involved, and a general involved, and a -- the\nGermans, because of Communism, and because of Nazism too. And also, not myself, I --\nI wanted to make sure one thing, I\u2019m not marrying to a big Nazi family, in respect to my\nparents, not that she would have had any guilt in this, her father, if he would have been a\nNazi, but that would be a very odd thing. But I did have a secretary, or a -- he was\nactually called in the army, a clerk, for -- he was a soldier, who could type up my\nclassified stuff. He was a Jewish guy, by the name of Ross Engle. He was -- had a\nmaster\u2019s degree in political science, he was drafted. Didn\u2019t have any desire to become an\nofficer. He would have made a good officer, but -- little guy like me, and he was going\nout with a German girl that I also knew, and I just talked to [indecipherable] in the\nfinance office, like a cashier, or something like that, military finance office. And his case\nis interesting, 1t was just the opposite from mine. He met this very nice, young girl, very\nlovely, and it turns out that she came from big Nazi family. So big that it was a famous\n135\nname in Germany. He was her -- the brother of her mother, of the Rice Youth Leader,\nwith all the German Jews went into uniform, the Nazi party member. And -- like the boy\nscouts, but they wore little knives, and all that. I would have been one, I would have been\nJewish, but -- the Hitler Youth. That\u2019s what it -- what -- Hitler Youth Leader. He was the\nHitler Youth Leader of Germany. There were two during Hitler\u2019s reign, and he was one\nof them. So the mother was the sister of this guy. Well, that was during the war, and I\nfigure well, after the war -- he figured the -- that the war is finished, that they don\u2019t keep\ntheir mouth shut, because they were Nazis, and anti-Semites, probably. Well, you didn\u2019t\nhave to be a Nazi to be an anti-Semite, necessarily. You could have been Nazi, and have\nknown some Jews that you liked, and still be a big Nazi, and -- and still like Jews\nsecretly, or something. But in his case it turned out, the poor guy, he was very smart --\nlike I said, he had a master\u2019s degree in political science. He was only a company clerk, he\nwas doing good work, and he -- he met this girl, and so it turned out her family\u2019s Nazi,\nand when he talked to me about this, he told me then that his father is a rabbi, and his\ngrandfather was a rabbi, and here he was in -- marrying into a Nazi family. H-He was in\nlove with the girl. Well, I said, \u201cWell, I consider myself lucky, I also -- y- you know\nabout my going out with Miss Dambotsios, and I found out from my wife only recently\nthat he tried to date her too, one time, but she didn\u2019t want to go out with him. And so, he\ncame to my wedding, and he took all the pictures. I have pictures of -- very nice guy.",
        "Q: Do you want to go ahead and say something about your -- your wife, and -- and how\nthat worked?\n136",
        "A: So I was very much impressed with her ideas about Nazism, and how much she knew\nabout Jews. Not from her parents, but after the war, because they didn\u2019t have any Jews\nwhere she lived, in the countryside there. All she did, she thinks one girl that she\nbefriended was Jewish, probably, but she wasn\u2019t sure, when she was a kid. And so\n[indecipherable] I did get married to this girl, and he got permission right away, in the --\nin the army, you had to get permission, because -- not just for security, but they didn\u2019t\nwant any bad elements to come into United States, girls who were prostitutes, or --\nexcuse me, or had other things, Communists, or something. And so they tried to get the --\nthe army required two things . In one, a form, a letter from your commanding officer,\nyour boss, that he certif -- that he okays that so and so gets married to -- and there\u2019s -- he\nhad to do some checking with the police, and then finally approve it. In a case of an\nofficer, in my case, I had to meet Colonel Skolie, my immediate superior, but it was only\na performer thing. I had the paper typed out, and I just said, \u201cWould you please sign my\npermission to get married?\u201d Because I was an officer, I had more of a privilege, let\u2019s say.\nAnd they -- they -- they assumed that an officer, which wasn\u2019t always true, had the\ncommon sense not to marry a prostitute, or -- but they did. Some of the best looking girls\nwere prostitutes there. And they were [indecipherable] glad to get rid of them, send them\nto United States. And there were guys who knew their wives were prostitute, and -- and\nstill want to marry them. But anyway, when I came with my paper to my colonel, he of\ncourse signed it right away, and he had known me for awhile already, so we had no\nproblem. But then my -- the second thing that we had to get was permission from the\n137\nchaplain -- not permission, to have the chaplain signature on there. If you\u2019re Jewish, you\ngo to the Jewish chaplain. That\u2019s the -- in the army they have chaplains who are catering -\n- catering wha -- providing the military with moral support, or religious support, who on\nSundays have a mass, if they\u2019re Catholic, or they\u2019re Protestant, and on Friday night have\na Jewish service in that army chapel, which is -- in the army serves all faith. So when the\nJews have their service, they cover up the cross, usually, and the rabbi comes and talks\nfrom the chapel. In that time the Jewish community in Heidelberg was about 200 people.\nSo we had a Jewish chaplain, in this case, Orthodox. So there is -- you never know what\nthe chaplain, if he\u2019s Jewish, whether Orthodox, Reformed, or Conservative. The army\ntook them in, and there were usually many Orthodox rabbis who didn\u2019t have a job\nbecause every o-orth -- there a lot of ri -- guys -- rabbis, who don\u2019t have a congregation\nhere in the United States. And the army needed rabbis, and they went to [indecipherable]\ncalled the chaplain\u2019s board, or the chaplain -- they advised the army on who might make\na good military chaplain. And they only re-recommended Orthodox people, which was\nwrong, because the majority of Jews are not Orthodox in the United States of -- United\nStates Army. In Israel it\u2019s a different -- even there they\u2019re not -- they\u2019re not the majority.\nBut the Orthodox chaplains are required not to s-say the prayers all in Hebrew, but to talk\nmainly English, and have the He-Hebrew. Whereas the -- the Reform rabbis have\neverything English, and I preferred that because w -- if I wanted to say a prayer or\nanything, I like to understand what I\u2019m -- I could read Hebrew, but I didn\u2019t understand. I\nstudied for Bar Mitzvah, and never was. Two weeks before my Bar Mitzvah, the war\n138\nstarted, in 1940, and I was not Bar Mitzvahed, so -- but I knew how to read Hebrew, and\nI knew the prayers, but I didn\u2019t understand it. I was never much interested in it, but -- but\nwhen I did go to chapel, I wanted to make sure if I did say something, I want to\nunderstand it. So, with the Orthodox, we had no common ground, they -- they didn\u2019t do\nwhat the army [indecipherable] told them to, to say it in English, but they -- they rattled,\nand they shugon, and they went through the motions like the Orthodox do, and I didn\u2019t do\nthis at ho -- in my hometown in Germany, and I didn\u2019t do this here, but [indecipherable]\njust went along, everybody chanted certain songs. So, the one we had in Hamburg that\ntime was Orthodox, and I knew was going to face, going with my paper to have him sign\nit, he probably would say how about your wife converting before I sign the paper. And\nexactly what happened. But, before I went to the Jewish chaplain, I went to the cath -- no,\nto the Protestant chaplain. There were three chaplains there, Catholic, Protestant, and\nJewish. And the Protestant chaplain was the head chaplain, he had the highest rank. He\nwas a colonel, and the Jewish chaplain was a major. And like I said, I was a lieutenant, so\nI was even lower. They all had ranks. I went to the chief chaplain, becau -- you see, it just\nsaid chaplain\u2019s signature, but what they meant was of your faith. There wasn\u2019t -- we\ndidn\u2019t have to do this, but I figure I\u2019m going to get around this Orthodox chaplain, who 1s\ngo -- not going to sign my paper, because he wants my wife to d -- to convert. And I went\nto the Protestant chaplain, and he said, \u201cWell,\u201d he said, \u201cyes, I could sign your paper, but\nI have to respect the Jewish chaplain, he is [indecipherable] your faith here, and I would\nfeel better if you get his signature.\u201d And I said to the chaplain, \u201cI tell you the truth, I\n139\ndidn\u2019t go to the Jewish chaplain because the Orthodox. That\u2019s okay with me, but I am\nafraid he is going to ask me for my wife to convert before he sign the paper. And I\u2019m not\nwilling to let that happen, because although my wife probably would convert to marry\nme, but to me it doesn\u2019t mean a thing, and I don\u2019t approve of the Orthodox, I don\u2019t go\naround -- if we had a Reform rabbi, I would consider it, but we don\u2019t happen to have\none.\u201d And he said, \u201cTry it anyway.\u201d Okay, I went to see the Jewish chaplain. I knew him\nalready. And he was a guy who was not -- not very nice. He was very Yiddish, if you say,\nand from he -- like he ca -- he came out of the ghetto, and he was telling me what to do,\nand that my wife or I should do this or that. And I said, \u201cI am not Orthodox, rabbi, please.\nI respect your views, I want you respect mine, too. And I, if I consider myself anything, I\nam Jewish, and I\u2019m not religious. And, as a matter of fact, I have questions not about\nJudaism, but religion in general, and my faith, because of the concen,\u201d -- he knew I was\nin concentration camp. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not sure about God, but in the respect m-my parents\nwould have been alive, and they would have wanted me to marry in the chapel, Jewish.\nAnd they probably would have approved of a non-Jewish wife, but I -- I -- I would get\nmarried in this chapel, but not Orthodox.\u201d And I knew that the chapels in the army, even\nif they were Orthodox, if he did approve of a marriage, or a wedding [indecipherable] to\nperform a wedding, he could perform this in a way that was not approved by the army,\nwas not completely Orthodox, but --\nEnd of Tape Six, Side A\nBeginning Tape Six, Side B\n140",
        "A: \u201cHow about converting your wife before I sign this paper?\u201d I said, \u201cI may -- no thank\nyou, we\u2019ve have talked about extensively. I just want your signature, so I can go ahead\nand get married.\u201d He hesitated, he said he wanted to talk about conversion to my wife,\nand -- who was not with me. And I said, \u201cNo, ki -- rabbi, this is between me and my wife,\nnot between you and my wife. And we talked about it plenty, and me -- don\u2019t think -- I\nthink my wife is a good -- will be a good wife, and had a good background, and I\ncouldn\u2019t require more than that. So please sign my paper.\u201d And he said he wants to talk to\nher, he wants a conversion. I said, \u201cNo, I told you, we\u2019re not -- she\u2019s not going to convert.\nNot because she doesn\u2019t -- I don\u2019t want to.\u201d And he was really upset because a Jew was\ndoing this. But that\u2019s mine life, not his life, or anybody else\u2019s. So I said, \u201cOkay, you\u2019re\nnot going to sign? I\u2019m going back and I\u2019Il see what we can do about this.\u201d He said, \u201cYou\n-- | won\u2019t sign til I talk some more to you.\u201d He didn\u2019t sign, he didn\u2019t say til she converts,\nbe -- he could not do that. And I said, \u201cBefore I leave your office, rabbi, I\u2019m going to tell\nyou, you are a bad rabbi. You are a bad military officer. Here I was, a lower ranking guy,\nand I\u2019m telling you something that somebody should have heard a long time to you. Not\nbecause you don\u2019t want to -- me to -- you know, give paper to marry, or my wife to\nconvert, because in general, you run lousy services here in this chapel, and this 1s not just\nme who\u2019s saying this. You are an Orthodox rabbi, and I\u2019m not Orthodox, that\u2019s not why\nI\u2019m against you. Because the army requires you, as an Orthodox rabbi, to conduct most of\nyour service in English, and that\u2019s why you lost the congregation here, and there are\nabout 200 Jews here, and you walk in here on a Friday night, you get a dozen people\n14]\nhere, you don\u2019t get anybody. And we had rabbis who were Orthodox, who had a lot more\nattraction to get Jews in here. Apparently you don\u2019t care. Y-You care about certain things\nabout Judaism.\u201d And I -- finally, I shouted at him, and that was it, I walked out. And I\nwas told I can get permission to get married without getting his signature on there. Okay.\nTwo, three weeks later, I heard about a plane going to Israel for American military\nofficers who were chaplains, or rabbis, for the clergy, military clergy. And it was a\nprivate trip, a German airplane, passenger plane, but somebody in the headquarters was\narranging this, to visit the holy land, which is for Jews, Catholics, it\u2019s for everybody,\nChristian and Jew. So it was a very cheap price, 200 dollars, I believe, for two weeks in\nIsrael, including the trip. This was in 1956 -- \u201957. And I heard there were two seats empty\non there, they couldn\u2019t fill two seats. But like I said, all the people going were -- were\nclergymen, and I found out that my rabbi wasn\u2019t going, which was fine with me, but two\nseats were free, but you had to pay for it, just like the rabbis did. For the rabbis it was not\npaid for by the army, but it\u2019s just some time off they got that -- seeing the holy land. I\nhad an uncle in Israel, who I\u2019m -- talked about before on the tape, who went to Israel,\nbecame prisoner of war, fought for the briti -- with the British, and -- my mother\u2019s\nbrother, and who broke the saber for the police, that\u2019s the story I have here on the tape.\nAnd I wanted to see him, and he was getting to be an old man, he -- he was a widow in\nthe meantime, no children, and he was my favorite uncle, actually. And he also had done\nsomething in the war, fought against the Germans in the first World War, he was in\n[indecipherable]. Okay, so I went and I said, \u201cIf these seats not -- can I pay for one of\n142\nthese seats and go to Israel?\u201d \u201cSure.\u201d I put my name on the list, off I went to Israel. Who\nsits next to me? The only -- the only Reformed rabbi military we had in Germany. I had\nheard of him, but he was far away from where I was at. He is my -- he sits next to me,\nand we look at each other, and he didn\u2019t know who was I, I didn\u2019t know who he was. And\nI mention my name, and he said, \u201cWillner, Willner. I got it. You are the one that gave\nhell to the Orthodox rabbi in the headquarters in Heidelberg where there\u2019s chaplain.\u201d I\nsaid, \u201cHow do you know?\u201d You know, to -- word had gotten around in the meantime,\nthere was this young officer who we called this chaplain of the doorma, and what\nhappened, there was a -- a retreat for Jewish chaplains, military chaplain, and Jewish\nmilitary chaplain assistants. Every chaplain had an assistant, a Jewish guy in the case of a\nJewish chaplain. In the case of the Catholic chaplain, he was Catholic soldier. And they\nwere the clerks, the secretaries, in fact. So our rabbi had the secretary, a Jewish guy, a -- a\nsergeant or something, who was also main career in the army, and when I had the\nargument with the chaplain, door was open to the next office, and there was the Jewish\nchaplain assistant sitting outside. And he had gone on this retreat, and he had told the\nother ch-chaplain assistants that, you know, \u201cSome young lieutenant in Heidelberg, he\nreally came in one day, and he gave my boss, who\u2019s a major, gave him hell, told him off\nin no uncertain terms, what a bad rabbi he was. I -- I -- I never heard anything like it.\u201d\nAnd so, he had all the other chaplain assistant. Then the assistant of the chaplain I was\nsitting next to on the airplane, he had heard it from the assistant from the Orthodox\nchaplain, the story. He said, \u201cYou are the guy I -- Willner, who wanted to get -- want to\n143\nget married, and,\u201d -- I say, \u201cWell, that\u2019s the whole thing. I don\u2019t care about Orthodox, and\n-- but I just want to have him sign my paper, and if he didn\u2019t want to sign it, and didn\u2019t,\u201d -\n- also said I -- I couldn\u2019t use the chapel, but maybe get some other rabbi to come. There\nweren\u2019t many rabbis in Germany, but -- to perform the ceremony. And I said, \u201cWell, I\ndon\u2019t get married -- I got married at city hall. I\u2019d -- it\u2019s not required that I get married\nunder Jewish law, or [indecipherable] law in the chapel, I just don\u2019t get married in the\nchapel.\u201d And so the Reform rabbi said, \u201cYou have a little problem there. I -- I don\u2019t really\nsee it as a problem. I don\u2019t know your future wife. I think differently about these things,\nand I\u2019m willing to marry you. Beca I -- if you want -- you want to get married in the first\nplace in the chapel, why should you be kept out of the chapel because the rabbi doesn\u2019t\nagree? That\u2019s not his private property, the chapel,\u201d he said. \u201cHe should marry anybody\nwants to get married.\u201d I said, \u201cYeah, he -- he\u2019Il marry anybody wants to convert. Maybe\nsome guy matries a prostitute off the street, as long as she c-converts to Judaism, he\u2019 II --\nhe\u2019ll marry her, probably,\u201d you know. And so this guy -- by this time we were finished\nwith the trip. In Israel we separate, I\u2019m going to see my uncle, they went sightseeing. In\ntwo weeks we met again to depart Israel, and on the way back, I sat next to him again,\nand he said, \u201cYou [indecipherable] Israel, and -- and by the way, do you still want to get\nmarried in the chapel?\u201d \u201cYeah,\u201d I said, \u201cyes. Because my parents would like to see me\nget marr -- and it\u2019s a nicer thing than just signing a paper in city hall, and I'll go for a\nJewish ceremony, but nothing -- even Orthodox, you know, but -- but not somebody who\nrequire my wife to be a -- become a,\u201d -- he, \u201cOkay, I don\u2019t require your wife to convert,\n144\nbut after I meet her, I make up my own opinion I want to marry you.\u201d He wanted to see\nwhat kind of woman she was, and -- so -- \u201cBut you have to come to my place, get\nmarried in my chapel, I cannot do it in that chapel in [indecipherable].\u201d I said okay. \u201cBut\nfirst you introduce me to your wife.\u201d So we went, and he secluded himself for about two\nhours in his office while I was waiting outside. And I said, \u201cWhat are you guys doing in\nthere? You -- you converting my wife now, when she comes out you say she is a Jew.\u201d\nAnd he -- he was asking her questions, and telling her. And he says, \u201cYour wife, 1t seems\nto me she probably knows as much about Jude as you do, if not more.\u201d I say,\n[indecipherable]. \u201cWell, I gave her a couple of books to learn some more about Judaism,\nsee, because I want to -- if I marry her in a Jewish ceremony, I want her to know about\nJudaism, but no conversion.\u201d [indecipherable]. And as far as the actual date is concerned,\nwe can make that later. I went back to Heidelberg -- and his place was a couple hours\naway from Heidelberg, and I -- he -- yeah, a-at that time, talking about luck, not his luck,\nthe Orthodox chaplain was ordered back to United States before my wedding day came\nup, and I was to go to the other chaplain -- because he had a child that was -- mentally\nhad a problem, and for personal reasons he was transferred back to United States, to\nanother job in the army. And we had no chaplain in Heidelberg, and so the chaplain\ncalled me up, the -- he informed that, \u201cOh, you are lucky. You don\u2019t even have to come\nmy chapel down here, I\u2019Il come to your chapel. You -- Pll perform the marriage in front\nof the Jews that you know, that live in Heidelberg, and so as we planned to do here, but\nyou do in your chapel. I could not have done this if your chaplain was still there, that\u2019s\n145\nlike hitting him in the face, you know, that\u2019s some -- making him look bad. But he\u2019s not\nthere, and so we\u2019re not doing -- he\u2019s not coming back either, not [indecipherable] gone\nfor sure.\u201d [indecipherable] fine. So he said, \u201cWell, you know, we\u2019re not going to have a\nbig thing.\u201d I said, \u201cI don\u2019t want a big thing. Just a few friends from the office,\u201d or -- non-\nJews, Jews, my boss is going come to the wedding, and we go to city hall, say -- in\nGermany you have a very f -- not fancy, but a more former wedding -- even in the city\nhall when you get your papers -- not talking about the party, or dinner, or something. But\nso he came to Heidelberg, and we went to the chapel. I took my boss along, my bosses\nboss, high ranking officer. Rosinger, the guy who was going to take the picture, and my --\nand the only Jewish guy in my -- no, Rosinger was one in the military Jewish guy, and I\nhad one civilian [indecipherable] for me, who was a GS 12, who was an expert on\nIntelligence some field, who was born as a German Jew in Berlin, whose father had been\narrested in the Crystal night, going to Dachau, and the mother was Christian. The mother\nthought the father\u2019s not going to come back from Dachau, she committed suicide in\nBerlin. And -- and the father came back from Dachau, and his wife was dead. But that\u2019s\njust -- this happened. So Jerry Coats, who was also Jewish, then came along. He married\na girl also from a Nazi family, a judge, a Nazi judge who didn\u2019t want any part of him, but\nhe was the other Jewish guy. So we had Jerry, and Rosinger, and my boss, and the boss\u2019\nboss, and that was it.",
        "Q: Johanna\u2019s parents didn\u2019t come?\n146",
        "A: They asked to come, and the father was retired already, by \u201965, and they said to him\nwhen he applied, \u201cOnly in case of death.\u201d [indecipherable] allowed to go to y-your\ndaughter\u2019s funeral in Heidelberg. And he said, \u201cThen I don\u2019t have to see her any more,\u201d\nwhen she died, and -- you know, ridiculous, but they -- what they wanted to do, people\nwho were drawing social security in East Germany, which he was, as a teacher, they were\nhoping they were staying in the west then, then the west will have to pay social security\n[indecipherable]. But they didn\u2019t -- they couldn\u2019t come. They did come one time, but not\nfor our wedding.",
        "Q: So you hadn\u2019t met them by the time you got married, or had you?",
        "A: After I got married. They stayed a couple of days, and then went back. So we went to\nchapel, the day came [indecipherable]. He performed a Jewish ceremony, breaking the\nglass. It was pretty much -- just wasn\u2019t very Orthodox, he did other thing. He gave us a\nHebrew certificate, Hebrew and English, signed officially by him, so that we had a\nJewish marriage, and our piece -- people there at the altar with me. And he made a little\nspeech, and then he said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to go for a snack downstairs.\u201d They had a social\nhall downstairs, that they had in all the chapel of the churches here, and you meet for the\nornek Shabbat on Friday night. And said okay. I actually planned to take them to lunch\nevery -- the -- all these people. And we go downstairs, and very quietly -- this is a big\nbuilding, right across from the headquarters. Very quietly, a lot of the Jews that knew me,\nor didn\u2019t know me, they had passed the word around, have had the wedding very quiet, I\nshould have a surprise. We come downstairs to the social hall, there are about 150 - 200\n147\npeople there, not just Jewish, for our marriage, and the food, and everyth -- they had done\nthis -- our wedding was upstairs in the chapel -- very quietly through the back door. And\nsomebody stood in the street, and they said, \u201cBe quiet, don\u2019t talk, this way,\u201d and so. Not\nonly did we had the rabbi, and these other people there, I had a second rabbi there. And\nthe rabbi whose wife was a woman who knew my family, was born in the same town that\nI was born in Germany, who knew my family, he\u2019s still alive today. He died since. He\nwas con-Conservative, but he had just been assigned to Germany, and he\u2019s been assigned\nto fill a chaplain job, but he didn\u2019t want to intrude on my chaplain, and he waited til I\ncame down. So we had two rabbis at my wedding, one rabbis wife, woman from my\nhometown and knew the family. I didn\u2019t know her then, but [indecipherable] little boy.\nAnd so they knew about my family. So Rabbi Vidall remain a rabbi for 25 years in the\narmy, and she settled out in California. So, I had a nice wedding, and then I invited the\nsame people that were initially in the group, for dinner in a -- a restaurant in Heidelberg.\nSo, I was lucky. [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Ah, hold on one second.",
        "A: After I got married, everything was finished -- finished ralb. I didn\u2019t know this, but\nthey had considered me, before I got married, to be assigned as a liaison officer to the\nGerman CIA, as a army liaison officer, US Army, because I spoke German fluently, and\nthey require that. In the meantime I got married, and they said -- the Germans said, \u201cIf\nhe\u2019s married, the officer, his wife must be an American, but to also speak German\nfluently.\u201d Well, I -- I just happened to fit the bill, and the -- in the first one I was not\n148\nmarried, and then I was married, too. So when I then got called in and was told I get the\njob, and my wife was cleared, and our general G2, he\u2019s the chief Intelligence officer of\nthe command for Europe, he called me in and said, \u201cWell now, you are on the way to\noccupy a very important job. We picked you because we feel you fit the bill, but I know\nyour background, concentration camps. You do not go there to find out who the Nazis\nare. You find -- you go there because you have a job to do for the United States. I can\nunderstand if you have any feelings, you find Nazis in there. We know that, but your job\nis not to uncover them, your job is to see that we get all the report that we\u2019re supposed to\nget, that the people that we interview, and so on, that they\u2019re not -- they don\u2019t keep the\ninformation from us.\u201d Former Nazis, or whatever. \u201cBut not for -- because of what\nhappened to you, that you are getting revenge.\u201d I said, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about it.\nI know what job I have to do. But, I will not associate socially with the guys I know who\npreviously had been big Nazis to all of a sudden cater to us, and,\u201d -- \u201cThat\u2019s okay,\u201d he\nsaid, \u201cbut like I said, you\u2019re not going there to stir up trouble in the German agency.\u201d\nThey all had ph-phony names, and there were war criminals who were hired after the\nwar, but soon gotten rid of later, but they came in there. So I went to the agency, and\neverything wound up very well, til one day -- they had three liaison officers like myself,\nBritish, French, and ger -- and -- and American, with the German agency, and everything\nwent on fine, and -- til one day the French liaison officer asked for a meeting with me\noutside the agency where we were working, to have lunch someplace in the countryside.\nAnd he wants to talk to me about something very seriously, that he felt that I understand\n149\nmore than anybody else, about Nazis and the German CIA, specifically one man, who\nwas an SS officer, and Gestapo member, and you know, had committed a war crime in\nCzechoslovakia, who was working with us, but who is working really against us, because\nhe is one who will not give us all the reports, who looks down on us, who probably still a\nNazi, and who -- who really doesn\u2019t cooperate with us. \u201cIf he had cooperated, I probably\nwouldn\u2019t have said a thing,\u201d he said, \u201cbut here\u2019s his file,\u201d and he gave me a file about two\ninches thick, in a briefcase, and he say, \u201cTake it back with you, look it over yourself, and\nwe, the French government, want this guy out of this job. And since he\u2019s in the American\noccupation zone,\u201d wh-where we were located, \u201cI feel I should go to the American liaison\nofficer, and have him take care of it.\u201d And I just -- with a smile he said, \u201cI know, because\nof your background, you\u2019ll do something about it.\u201d I said, \u201cWell, frankly, you\u2019re right,\nbut my general told me that I\u2019m not here to find out who the Nazis are, who the war\ncriminals are. You know what my job is, same as yours. But I know we,\u201d -- somebody\nlike this, who was sentenced to death twice, in absentia, in Czechoslovakia. After the\nwar, they couldn\u2019t find him. They knew him as a worker -- they knew he was alive\nsomewhere, because he had submerged in a German agency under a different name. So\nthe French officer, \u201cHere\u2019s the file, Eddie, take it home with you. If your general decides\nto do nothing about it, we will do something about it. But Pll leave it to your judgment.\u201d\nSo he said -- I said, \u201cWhat will you do if my people say no, they don\u2019t want any part of\nthat? Like I said, the general told me, I\u2019m not there to find out the SS or the Gestapo\nman.\u201d He said, \u201cVery simple,\u201d he said, \u201cand please convey this to your general. We will\n150\ngive it to the local newspapers, we will make public that in a new -- in the west German\ngovernment, in the newly created Central Intelligence Agency of West Germany, you\nhave a guy who was condemned to death by the Czechs, and you employ him. Not very\ngood for the German -- the new west German government.\u201d I said, \u201cGood.\u201d I said, \u201cIll\ntake care of it. I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll have to go newspapers, but I don\u2019t know, but I cannot\npromise.\u201d I took it to Heidelberg. Right away I ask for -- I get into the general\u2019s office,\nsometimes very difficult. I said, \u201cI have something of utmost importance.\u201d Okay, I was\nlet in. I said, \u201cGeneral, I remember what you told me, my job is not to find out who the\nNazis are, but I found something worse, I found a war criminal in our midst, who is also\nprobably against us, Americans, and I did not go after him. Here\u2019s what happened, the\nFrench asked me to speak to them, and gave me a file for you to look over, and make a\ndecision. We hoping to get him out.\u201d And that actually took place. He said, \u201cOkay.\u201d He\nhad no problem with that, that I was just passing it on. I said, \u201cFrankly, I -- I -- I read the\nwhole file, and the man, on a high level, he was retired early -- they said retired, but I\nthink he was transferred to another place, under another name.\u201d But that\u2019s all I could do,\nbut I did something where I could do. The director general of the agency where I was,\none time told a young officer, a naval officer West Germany [indecipherable] was\nworking temporarily. He didn\u2019t know I was in a concentration camp when I got to his\nagency, but one day I was -- 1t was very hot in the office, I took my jacket off, I had a\nshort sleeve shirt on, and somebody saw the number on my arm. Apparently he knew\nright away what that was, and the word got around to the director that -- that the\n151\nAmerican liaison officer probably was in concentration camp. And he never talked to me\nabout it, the boss there, but the naval officer, a young guy, who was not [indecipherable]\nyoung guy, after the war, he became a naval officer, the guy was about 30 years old,\nmarried. He in -- I invited him -- he invited me to his home first for dinner one time with\nmy wife, and I invite him to my house. And we didn\u2019t talk about business, because I\nfigured that was improper, that they probably think I\u2019m going to li -- hear him out, see\nwhat he knows about them, and digging up things that they didn\u2019t want us to know. And\nafter the social visit, the two social visits, he came to my office. He said he\u2019d been told by\nthe director not to soci -- socially associate with me. They were afraid I was going to find\nout there were a lot -- a lot of the guys in there who -- so that\u2019s the story about that I was",

A normal\nassignment is three years, or two years, we had extended, and I\u2019ve been re-selected by --\nby the city government, which of -- whi -- there are seven councilors, and -- plus the\nmayor. And at city council meetings, people get sworn in for various long term job. And I\nhad volunteered for 21 years, to be a member, and also a chairman of the public safety\ncommission, which we -- we used to be called the law enforcement commission, which\nhas overview the police, the fire department, and the ambulances, yeah. But my interest\nwas the police, because I served as criminal investigator, and I felt I had something to\noffer, maybe advice, and also because the name was added to public safety commission,\nprob -- human relations commission, which I\u2019m very much interested in. And which --\nand there were cases to cover, and discuss in the -- first in our commission meeting, then\nbrought up to the city council, and so withot -- and I resigned, like I said, because of my\nphysical disabilities, and I felt I had served enough.

        "Q: So --",
        "A: And without further ado -- and -- and what I like to mention 1s that when my son, my\nyoungest son was still living at home, was studying at Georgetown, and become a foreign\naffairs officer in the State Department eventually, that he thought he also should do\nsomething for the city. He still lives at home, and the other children are married, of\ncourse, but he\u2019s volunteered then, that after I resign, or asked not to be reconsidered for\nthis job, he came to me [indecipherable] and said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t I go in your place, and also\ndo something for the city?\u201d I said, \u201cIt\u2019s fine with me, 1f you have time to do this, you\nhave to study a lot, but they have meetings at night, but maybe you can handle that.\u201d He\napplied, and there were four or five people applying for two jobs, two of them, there were\nseven -- there seven commissioners, and two p-place for [indecipherable] and another.

And I -- I didn\u2019t think he had too much to offer, but he\u2019s young, and he can ler --\nhe heard a lot from me what goes on in the city, and the problems, so he is somewhat\n154\nfamiliar. And he did get selected, and then the day came when he was going to be sworn\nin, in the front of the city council, and the cit -- in the city hall, publicly, and\n[indecipherable] people were there.

        "Question: This is United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, volunteer collection,\ninterview with Eddie Willner, conducted by Gail Schwartz, on October 11\", 2000, in\nFalls Church, Virginia. This is a continuation of a post-Holocaust interview conducted by\nArwin Donohue on July 12\" and 13\", 2000. This is tape number one, side A. Before we\ncontinue with the interview, I just wanted to clarify some chronology. When were you\nmarried? Do you remember the actual date?\n157",
        "Answer: We were married in Germany, in Heidelberg, which 1s a famous place for\ngetting married, but I was stationed there with the headquarters US Army. And we\nmarried on the 21\u201c of August, 1958.",
        "Q: And you did discuss the c -- the conditions before.",
        "A: We got married in the city hall, in the Jewish chapel.",
        "Q: Yeah. You had talked about that previously. The other date I wanted to ask you, is do\nyou know when you became a citizen of the United States, approximately?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember exactly, but I can -- probably 1951, because I went to officer\u2019s\nschool after I became a citizen, I couldn\u2019t go before. And that was in *52. I graduated in\nAugust *52. So it must have been in *51 or \u201950. Of -- maybe \u201950.",
        "Q: Was this a very significant moment for you, becoming a United States citizen?",
        "A: Yes, it was a very significant moment that I wa -- became a citizen not 1n a big\nceremony, I -- I was the only one, and it was an American female judge, and she was\ntrying to be funny. I was in uniform, I was a sergeant of the US Army, and she\u2019s asked\nme three questions before becoming a citizen. Lift up your right hand, and answer my\nquestions, that you tell me the truth, and nothing but, and so on. So she said, \u201c\u201cWho\u2019s\nUncle Sam?\u201d I said, \u201cI work for him.\u201d Okay, that was [indecipherable]. Then she asked\nme for other questions I\u2019m willing to pay tax in this country. Yes. And the third question\nI don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t remember.",
        "Q: Okay. Let\u2019s now just talk a little bit about your time in army, which again you\u2019ve gone\ninto a lot of detail in the previous interviews, but my question was, when you were\n158\nstationed in Japan, did you see any evidence, or did you feel any of that -- 0-of the\nJapanese being the United States former enemies? Did a-any of that enter into your\nexperiences?",
        "A: No, because the Japanese way of life -- we were looking as the people, the conqueror,\nthe people who are better maybe, we won the war. And they\u2019re very submissive, the\nJapanese, when they don\u2019t win. And they become prisoners, and -- so I -- I didn\u2019t have\nany problem with that, or -- I don\u2019t know if anybody else had, after MacArthur, who most\npeople feel had the right type of occupation in Japan, for Japan. In Germany it wouldn\u2019t\nhave worked that way, had a different type of occupation. But in Japan, the Japanese\nbecame very pro-American right away, because the policies MacArthur -- and the\ndemocracy, which introduced into ja -- Japan right away, and they fell right in line. And\nthey changed over very quickly, whereas in Germany, I feel, they didn\u2019t change over so\nquickly, if they change over at all. Compared to the Nazis, I think there is no comparison,\nexcept the Japanese themself, compare themself during the war to the Germans. They\ncalled themself Germans of the Far East. But they didn\u2019t do all the things the Germans\ndid. So -- and after the war, they also felt that had something in common with the\nGermans. They lost the war, both of them. So the big thing that I can state, the difference,\nwhen my wife and I took a taxi in Tokyo, and we spoke in English, there was a distance\nbetween the taxi driver and us. This was in 1950 -- after Korean war, in 1958 - \u201959 - \u201960.\nAnd they were still repairing all things from the bombardment. And the Japanese tax1\ndrivers, for instance, if we talk German in the back of the cab, he will listen, he will say\n159\nafter awhile, \u201cWhat nationality are you?\u201d And I had this thing, I was an amer -- an\nAmerican, of course, but they respected the Germans, even though they both -- because\nlike I said, they felt they had something in common, they also lost the war together. They\nfelt they were very hard working people, clean, and also ruthless in war. So they called\nthemselves, rightfully so , the -- the Asians -- the Germans of the Far East.",
        "Q: What did you mean that they didn\u2019t do what the Germans did?",
        "A: Well, they did no -- also, we didn\u2019t do what we did to the Germans. Prosecute people\nwho committed war crimes. They prosecuted some, but not -- they didn\u2019t have\nconcentration camps, although they killed a lot of Chinese, particularly. But they didn\u2019t\nhave concentration camps, they had POW camps, where they treat the people just as bad\nas in -- in a concentration camp. But on the whole, they did not -- as a matter of fact, they\ndid not have anything against Jews, Japanese. They let the Jews come into Shanghai,\n5,000 of them re -- and a girl that was in my class in Germany went to -- to Shanghai, and\nI met her later in Florida, so I know how they were treated. But Japan was, for most Jews,\na -- acountry to wait til the war ended, or a place to go through to some other place. But\nthey didn\u2019t bother Jews.",
        "Q: Did you see any evidence with other Americans, of anti-Japanese sentiment?",
        "A: Did the Americans were anti-Japanese, or the Japanese anti-American?",
        "Q: N-No, in -- in -- when you were there in the army, with the other American soldiers,\ndid they evidence any anti-Japanese sentiments?",
        "A: Not very much, no. Because the Japanese very friendly, very nice, and I must say my\n160\nown job, which was in military Intelligence, and we were not in uniform, we were\ndocumented civilian. I was commanding officer of a small unit. They -- they -- we had no\nproblem whatsoever, and when they found out that I had been in a concentration camp,\nthat interests them, but they ca -- always came out with the same thing, \u201cWhat about the\natomic bomb?\u201d That we [indecipherable]. To them I was not a German Jew, I was an\nAmerican civilian, and they felt very bad about us dropping atomic bomb there. I didn\u2019t\nfeel so bad about it, and I had problems with them -- with Japanese. They took me once\nto Hiroshima, to the famous museum, just like the Holocaust museum here, and in the\nmuseum were life size pictures of what looked like right after the bombing. And you saw\npeople there burned. People like you c-could see in the Holocaust museums. And they\ntook me through this museum for about two hours, and I was the only American, there\nwas three Japanese, they all spoke English. And after two hours, it was about lunchtime,\none of the Japanese said to me, \u201cMr. Willner, where we going to eat lunch?\u201d \u201cOh,\u201d I said,\n\u201cany -- any Japanese restaurant will do, it doesn\u2019t make any difference.\u201d And he said to\nme, \u201cMr. Willner, you can eat lunch now, after seeing this?\u201d And I said, \u201cYes. I\u2019ve seen\nstuff like this before, not from one bomb, but from many bombs. I\u2019ve seen people dead\nfrom bombings. I\u2019ve seen -- I\u2019ve seen thousands, probably. And where I worked in a\nGerman synthetic [indecipherable] factory, it was bombed by amer -- by the Americans,\nbut not by one bomb, but by hundred or 200 bombers at one time. And s -- and even one\ncity in Germany, city of Draisin, was bombed by the British, and during one bombing\nraid more people were killed than by one bomb here in Hiroshima. Most people don\u2019t\n161\nknow this.\u201d So -- well, they got to be a little funny about this, they just [indecipherable].\nThey wanted me to feel sorry for that. And I couldn\u2019t feel sorry for them, because they\ncontinued the war, they were warned, and the only thing that stopped our conversation,\nthere was dead silence, was one man\u2019s name was Mr. Maneeshi, and he was the only\nJapanese I disliked in my six years in Japan, because he was doing certain things that I\ndisapproved of. He also lied, which is accepted in Japan, because if you don\u2019t know the\nanswer to something, you make it up. But Mr. Maneeshi, I said to him -- after he said\nabout you can eat lunch now after seeing this, I said yes. And there was silence, and I\nsaid, \u201cBy the way, did you ever hear of Pearl Harbor?\u201d And then there was dead silence,\nand then we went to lunch. Not one more word was said about the atomic bomb, or Pearl\nHarbor.",
        "Q: So you -- so you spent six years in Japan in the army?",
        "A: I spent six years in Japan. I went two -- two tours in Japan. After the Korean war,\nwhen the Korean war was over, I was sent with my unit to Japan, and we stayed nine\nmonths. So I was as a bachelor the first time. The second time I went to Japan, I went\nvoluntarily, the army asked me, I didn\u2019t have to go. And if I could take my family, I said\nyes. They said yes. And three of my children are born in Japan, three out of the six. And\none of them has a Japanese name. I had very good friends, and we still have Japanese\nvisiting us here. I ca -- became a friend of a general, whose daughter learned cooking our\nhouse, German cooking, Jewish cooking, American cooking, and her daughter, the Ph.D.,\nnot married, still lives now in United States, comes here all the time, and she lives in\n162\nPennsylvania, and the mother is about -- that\u2019s the daughter of the general, she is teaching\nEnglish, she speaks fluent English. She had a master\u2019s degree from Columbia University.\nShe never lived here, she [indecipherable]. So they a very fine family, and they became in\nclose touch all the time.",
        "Q: Speaking about her being in America, let\u2019s go back a little bit in time. What was it like\nfor you? How did you feel when you first put your foot down on American soil?",
        "A: Well, it was -- everything was new, of course. And I didn\u2019t know, really, what to\nexpect. Well, maybe I did, but I -- I just didn\u2019t expect anything. Because I came here with\n10 dollars in my pocket. I didn\u2019t have a job, although somebody I met in Europe said,\ncome and see me sometimes. But a lot of people said come and see me sometime. But he\ndid give me a job. And I was told that because I signed what I think are called first\npapers, at that time [indecipherable] were the papers that you want to become a citizen.\nYou apply for it, and you -- your -- your sponsor. I was completely separate from him, he\n-- he was just a guy that lends his name to my -- [indecipherable] that my papers will\ncome over. That\u2019s all. Once I was here --",
        "Q: Y-Y -- Yo -- now you -- I know you had talked about that, what my question was, was\nwhen you put that very first time, do you remember putting your foot down on American\nsoil? Was that an emotional experience for you?",
        "A: Not very emotional, but it was something that I had to see, that I was very happy\nabout, even though I didn\u2019t know what to expect. A lot of my friends went to Israel, and I\nhad no intention of going, I mentioned it before, and --\n163",
        "Q: Did you come -- did you come by boat?",
        "A: Boat.",
        "Q: What boat?",
        "A: By boat. I don\u2019t remem -- it was -- 1t was a cattle ship. I think it was third or fourth\nclass, down in the hole, and I didn\u2019t pay for it, some Jewish organization paid for it. I\nthink it was about a hundred or a hundred and 10 dollars to come over. And to my name I\nhad another 10 dollars. So I came over. And I was told that I would maybe be -- I might\nbe drafted, because the draft didn\u2019t stop right after World War two, so they were still\ndrafting people, and s-sign papers to become an American citizen, there\u2019s -- they had a\ngood chance, that I was healthy, and so on.",
        "Q: Did you see the -- did you see the Statue of Liberty when you came in?",
        "A: Did I what?",
        "Q: Did you see the Statue of Liberty when you arrived?",
        "A: No, unfortunately not. There was a -- it was -- everybody was all inside, and we didn\u2019t\n-- you didn\u2019t see the Statue of Liberty, because there was a lot of fog up there.",
        "Q: All right, let\u2019s talk now a little bit about your sharing of your Holocaust experience.\nHow much of it did you share with your wife? You had talked about some very painful\ntimes in your previous interviews, and I was just wondering, did you share these\nextremely difficult times with your wife?",
        "A: I share [indecipherable], yes.",
        "Q: An-And when did you?\n164",
        "A: Not immediately, but later. I had to insure myself that she didn\u2019t come from a family -\n- | had to know about their thinking, and whether they approved, or didn\u2019t approve. In\nthis case, they approved of me in every way. I had no problems with my in-laws, and on\nmy side there was nobody left. So with my wife, particularly, I found somebody that not\nonly felt deeply with me, she -- although she had no experience of her own, but she did\nhave experiences between democracy and Communism, because she lived in East\nGermany, and not very far from where I escaped, and she left also, illegally, East\nGermany for West Germany. Her father was a teacher, and he decided on the -- well,\neven before Communism, under the Prussian rulers, that all his children are going to be\nschool teachers. And my wife was not willing -- she was not willing to become a school\nteacher, and be taught where to taught, and what to teach. She also wanted to become a\nteacher. So she left when there was still time, and crossed the border illegally. There was\nno war up here in Berlin, that was early in the game. And it was very interesting, her\ntown, and her territory was about -- was Russian occupied for -- no, I\u2019m sorry, was a --\nAmerican occupied, but first the Nazis were there, then the American troops owa, and\nthen Eisenhower signed some papers where the demarcation line on the border would be,\nand the part that she was in was turned over to the Russians. So the Americans went in\nfirst, occupied it, and then turn over to the Ru -- so she didn\u2019t like 1t under Communism\nbecause of the teaching experience, and she left for Heidelberg. Now, in Germany at that\ntime, there was lack of worker people, and she could only stay if you came from the east,\nif you found a job. So she found a job on a farm. When she had money -- when she had\n165\n[indecipherable]. Michael? Must be my wife. I thought my son was there.\n[indecipherable]. So she left for Heidelberg, got herself a job -- oh, she\u2019s going\nsomeplace. I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t know it. She worked, and she studied. When I met her, she\ndidn\u2019t work on a farm any more, she knew enough English, and she attend the Heidelberg\nUniversity\u2019s English Institute, where they taught English, proper English. So her English\nwas very good, and she wound up at a job in the American headquarters where I was\nworking in Heidelberg. And she worked as a clerk, and then when she had enough\nmoney, she went back to the university. So when I met her, she was working of course,\nbeca -- and we dated.",
        "Q: Yeah, you had talked about that, but my question was, when did you tell her about the\nvery difficult moments of your war time experience?",
        "A: [indecipherable] that is very interesting, your question. And also the way it went. At\nfirst I appeared to her in American officer\u2019s uniform. And nobody expected me to have\nbeen in concentration camp. As a matter of fact, only one time I was called in front of a\ngeneral in Heidelberg, they plate -- and they were doing a parade, when some German\ngenerals came to visit the American headquarters, all the officers and staff, on the\ngeneral\u2019s staff, had to be outside, and watch the parade, and when the American flag\ncame by, and we had to salute. And when the German flag came by, we had to salute.\nThat was no problem for me, but when they played the German national anthem, I\u2019m\nsorry to say the German national anthem today, is not the same words that -- that exist\nunder Hitler, but the melody is the same, and I could not salute while they were playing\n166\nthe German national anthem, because in the concentration camp one time, I witnessed a --\nhang a couple of people, and they played the German national anthem. So there was a\nphoto taken of the officers saluting, and someone said, \u201cHow come Willner is not\nsaluting?\u201d And some officer said, \u201cOh, you\u2019ll have to excuse him. He knows why he\u2019s\nnot going to salute.\u201d He knew the reason. Well, the final outcome, I was called to the\ngeneral\u2019s office, and he said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to dress you down. You were supposed to\nsalute like everybody else, but next time -- I know your background, we not holding\nagainst you. I can feel your feelings. Just don\u2019t show up. We have to do this, whether we\nlike it or not, and I don\u2019t feel -- to make you do it would not be the right thing.\u201d So we\ngot some very good understanding there. Far as my wife is concerned, it\u2019s a lot of long\nstory. She didn\u2019t know my background, and I actually met her in Heidelberg, there was a\ntrial of an SS.",
        "Q: Yeah, you had talked about that.",
        "A: So we know that. After that, I think that the question of Nazism, and anti-Semitism --\nin -- where she lived, she didn\u2019t know any Jews, so they couldn\u2019t -- would not say\nanything about that, but my wife is today more Jewish than I am. I coo --",
        "Q: M-M-My question was when did you then tell her -- when did you finally reveal to her\nthe very painful moments?",
        "A: About three months after I met her. And we met probably, on most evenings after\nwork. And that means [indecipherable] three months I wanted to marry her, because of\nthis -- that she didn\u2019t know who I was, or ba -- and I questioned her, what she thought\n167\nabout all these things that happened during the war. And every one was very satisfactory\nto me. And they were not made up by some -- as some people did that liked to tell you\nwhat you like to hear.",
        "Q: Well, let\u2019s get onto your children now. When did you begin to tell them what\nhappened to you during the war? Did you wait for them to ask you?",
        "A: No. They were told when I -- when they going to Jewish Sunday school at Fort\nBelbar, which is a military Jewish Sunday school [indecipherable] was a rabbi, and a\nmilitary chaplain. And some that were Orthodox, sometime Reformed. They went 10\nyears, each one of them to Fort Belbar, which is near Washington. So each one of our\nchildren had 10 years of Jewish education, but somewhere during that time, when they\nwere old enough -- not when they were six years old, or five years old, I told them about\nthe Holocaust, and my background. And so they all found out, I would say, n -- in the\nrange of seven, eight years, or nine years, and more and more I told them all what they\nwanted to know, and they always questioned, and I gave some talks in the Sunday school,\nwhich they also listened to. But they were fully aware of my background, and their\nmother\u2019s background, and the fact that my children would not believe, when Bar Mitzvah\ntime came along that the Orthodox rabbi would not recognize them as being Jewish,\nbecause the mother was not Jewish. I explained that. And they could not believe it. They\nbelieved the Holocaust, but they could not believe that the mother was not Jewish, and --\nbecause she went with -- with us to the synagogue. She knows how to read Hebrew. As a\n168\nmatter of fact, she knew more than the average Jewish wife, which was not at my request,\nshe did on her own.",
        "Q: How did your wife -- or did she -- educate the children about the Holocaust? Was it\ndifferent than the way you did?",
        "A: No, I did that. I did all that, because I was a f-first witness to this, she was not, and she\n-- she knew about concentration camps, she had heard about it, that\u2019s about all. Like most\nGermans had, my age or older. I cannot accept, for instance, that the Germans tell to me,\nsomebody my age or older, that they didn -- he didn\u2019t know there was such thing as\nconcentration camp. Because they themselves were afraid of going to concentration\ncamps. It wasn\u2019t just Jews that were in there. And as far as my wife 1s concerned, before\nshe met me, she knew about concentration camps from reading the newspaper, not from\n[indecipherable]. I was the first one she met that was there.",
        "Q: So it was you, you said, who was the one to educate your children about this, rather\nthan your wife?",
        "A: Right. And to some extent, some of those teachers in school [indecipherable] in\nschool, but they didn\u2019t give a good account of it, because they only told them what\n[indecipherable] was. So my -- my children, all of them, have a very deep understanding\nof the Holocaust by now of course, they\u2019re much, much older. As a matter of fact, I don\u2019t\nknow if I mentioned this before, but my oldest son, who 1s a lieutenant colonel, and who -\n- it\u2019s something I didn\u2019t mention at that time, because it didn\u2019t exist, he is now a\nprofessor at West Point, teaching young cadets. And I\u2019m sure he talks about the\n169\nHolocaust too, because he -- that\u2019s not his main subject, his main subject\u2019s for\ninternational relations, foreign affairs, and politics. And he\u2019s very mach -- much aware of\nthe Holocaust, all his children are, and he has marched, in the deep winter, for 14 days,\nall by himself, the same march that we called the Death March, from Blechhammer to\nGross-Rosen. He marched that. That\u2019s the one that\u2019s at West Point. I am glad to have\nsomebody like him up there. If he is going to be asked any question, he knows all the\nanswer.",
        "Q: Wh-What is his name?",
        "A: Albert Willner. And I have some more information I want to tell you about him,\nbecause I\u2019m real proud of him. I -- in a way, not -- not more proud than the other\nchildren, because the others didn\u2019t have the chance to do what he did, and Albert, I like to\nmaybe elaborate a little bit later about Albert and his past, not just about the\nconcentration camp, but how he fared in the military so far. And he just moved from\nWashington a couple of mo -- two months ago, to West Point.",
        "Q: Before we get to your children, and I do want to ask you about that later on, after you\nfinished with the army, you were in the army for 20 years, I understand, then you worked\nfor -- was it the federal government, and if so, what position did you occupy?",
        "A: Yes, I worked for the federal government for another 20 years -- 20 years in the army,\nand you have a possibility when you -- you get your 20 years credit, then you go into\ncivil serv -- or you take separate [indecipherable] for 20 years in the army. I decided to f -\n- retire from the army, go into the reserves, and -- which I did, and then -- then working\n170\nfor -- in federal civil service for another 20 years. I applied, I took a test, what they call a\nmid-level test to place you someplace. It was a 10 hour test, plus the fact that I was an\nofficer in the army, they give you extra point per the -- the schools you went to. So\n[indecipherable] point, so finally I retired [indecipherable] from the federal government,\nalso after 20 years.",
        "Q: What department did you work for?",
        "A: I worked in an outfit that\u2019s not well known. It\u2019s called the International Statistical\nProgram Center. It\u2019s located with the Bureau of the Census. Now, most of the people are\nstatisticians, who are borrowed from Bureau of the Census for this organization. And\nthere was an organization, couple of hundred people, still exists today, and it\u2019s called the\nInternational Statistical Program, ISPC.",
        "Q: So do you have a statistical background?",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t. That was my problem. I don\u2019t have a sta -- and I really don\u2019t care about\nstatistics, but I did have a language [indecipherable] and I put that to good use. Th-There\nwas the French needed 1n there, Spanish I didn\u2019t know. German I didn\u2019t know, and I\nhandled all the correspon -- correspondence. And all the incoming mail, and all the\nincoming newspapers from foreign countries, they were wanted by the US government,\nand I distribute them to the people that had a need to know. That\u2019s open information,\nnewspaper. So people who saw me in the morning, sitting at my desk, reading newspaper\nfor two hours, they always felt I had the best job in there. How can he get away with this?\nHe doesn\u2019t do any work, he\u2019s reading the paper. That was part of my job. It\u2019s very\n17]\ninteresting, I had some very interesting people I worked for, and part of this work, I must\n-- to be frank about it, I think [indecipherable] part of this was paid for by the CIA. And\nthere was what you call contract work. So the Bureau of the Census has this section I was\nin, ISPC, which was not a -- not a CIA organization, but like I said, there are statisticians\nthere, and people -- demographers, and people who are very familiar with international\ncommerce. And so th -- it was a study writing organization.",
        "Q: Did you experience any anti-Semitism in this position with the government?",
        "A: No. My boss was Jewish one time, [indecipherable] for 10 years. He was a nice guy.\nAnd actual anti-Semitism, no, I don\u2019t think so. I had no problem there.",
        "Q: Did you stay in this one position for the 20 years?",
        "A: No. I stayed for 14 years in the same position. There was a big riff. 800 people got\nriffed. And I was supposed to get riffed, and lucky for me I spoke two foreign lang --\nthere was a provision made in the riff orders, anybody who speaks two or more foreign\nlanguage -- many people could speak one foreign language. Anybody who speaks two or\nmore foreign language fluent -- and is a language that being used, they will be placed in\nanother position, they will not be riffed. I was the only one that wound up in the po -- in -\n- in -- not being riffed. But I was placed in the position for the next six years -- like I said,\nI made the 20 years civil service, and 14 in one position, and after I got riffed, I was put\nin another position, where I wouldn\u2019t have to be a statistician. And I pushed the\nstatistician out of his job [indecipherable] riff procedures, who knew all about it, and then\nhad to work under me, at one grade less, and was a terrible situation. I tried to get out of\n172\nit, you know, the poor guy, he knew I was not at fault, but people were understanding.\nAfter two years my big boss said he didn\u2019t want me to leave the civil service with a bitter\ntaste in my mouth. He meant statistics. It wasn\u2019t my fault I didn\u2019t know anything about\nthem. And anyway, I finished my next four years in another job, which I had\n[indecipherable] statistic, as supervisor.",

        "Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer\ncollection interview with Eddie Willner. This is tape number one, side B. And we were\ntalking about your government career. So then you stayed in the government for 20 years,\nand when did you retire?",
        "A: I retired in 1968 for the first time, \u201988 the second time, from the civil service. The first\ntime from the military, in \u201968, after 20 years, and I stayed another 20 years in s -- regular\ncivil service, and --",
        "Q: And then what did you -- did you do anything professionally after 1988?",
        "A: No, I volunteered. I am very proud to say I served the public, in the city of Falls\nChurch, mainly. We have several organizations here which are selected, or appointed, or\nelected by the city of Falls Church, and I got myself into an organization that was called\nLaw Enforcement and Human Relations Advisory Commission. And I was selected by\n173\nthe city council. Three people interview you, and you either get the job [indecipherable]\nand you make it to be appointed. I have been the s -- longest serving member of that\norganization in Falls Church, and I recently -- I was going to say retired, it\u2019s a non-paying\njob, of course. And I felt I should do something for the city, they were good to me, or to\nthe United States, and I did that, too. I taught peop -- foreigners how to speak English. At\n7:30 in the morning, people that were employed otherwise here, and the main job, like I\nsaid, was public safety with that commission, and I served for almost 21 years on the\ncommission. I resigned from it. I\u2019m happy to say my youngest son took my place. But\nunfortunately, he has to change schools pretty soon, he\u2019s going to [indecipherable] back\nto Georgetown for foreign affairs for a Master\u2019s in foreign affairs, and he\n[indecipherable] to be the recipient of a scholarship for one year for another Master\u2019s\ndegree in national security affairs. And he goes to that place paid for. You get a regular\nsalary, but you\u2019re going to school for a year, and he\u2019s just started that.",

        "A: His name is Michael Willner.",
        "Q: You had touched on in a previous interview, some thoughts about food and what it\nmeant to you. When you were in the army, I think you had mentioned some -- you don\u2019t\nlike to see food wasted --",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "Q: -- because -- can you talk a little bit about that?\n174",
        "A: [indecipherable] only one thing that comes to my mind, a little -- the almost\n[indecipherable] I created in the army. I -- I don\u2019t like to see foods wasted, and one time\nin the army, when I was a lieutenant, the mess officer got sick, he had to go in the\nhospital for a week, and some superior officer came to me, and said for -- he wanted me\nto fill in for one week til this guy gets back on, as a mess officer. And this was a huge\nmess hall cona -- called a consolidated mess hall at Camp Killmer, New Jersey. And it\nfed about 2,000 men, so it\u2019s a real big operation. And I saw the food that was being\nwasted there. So I hung up some big signs, take all you want, eat all you take. In other\nwords, you didn\u2019t have to take the food they were giving you on your plate, they went\nthrough the line. And it didn\u2019t work, so the guys were still -- I told the cooks, \u201cDon\u2019t put\nso much on their plates, they can\u2019t eat what you put.\u201d And if -- so some of them paid\n[indecipherable]. And I told the men, \u201cDon\u2019t take it, even if they want to give it to you,\nsay take some off.\u201d Well, it didn\u2019t work, so I -- I came to a concl -- I -- I was very -- it\nreally bothered me, all this food being wasted.",
        "Q: Wh-Why did it bother you?",
        "A: Well, because some people were still hungry in this world. Not because I saw people\nhungry only, but there were still many countries -- even in our country. I arranged one\ntime here in Washington, at the officer\u2019s club at Fort Meyer, to send some food that was\nleftover to the old people\u2019s home. You don\u2019t say old people\u2019s home any more, but senior\ncitizens, or whatever. So we can all just do something about it. In the army it was just\nwell, when I asked for some leftover for my dogs, they packed up a whole roast for my\n175\ndog. Well, I -- I said, that whole roast could be -- there are no meals at night, people who\nwork night shift, they don\u2019t get fed, the mess hall is closed, only in the day is open. You\ncan cut up some sandwiches for them, and help themselves. And you have some leftovers\nspoil, then you can throw it away. But they had refrigerators, and just everything was\nthere. But anyway, it bothered me because I saw so many people hungry in the war, and I\nwas hungry. And the final outcome was that after trying everything else, I stood at the\nend of the line when they cleaning their plates. They just shove their leftovers into a big\nvat, and then put into a machine, and machine cleans their tray. I made guys go back who\nhad too much food on their plate, I made them go back to the table and eat. And\nsomebody said to the officer on duty that they had in Camp Killmer, New Jersey, and he\ncame over, and he took me aside, and he said, \u201cLieutenant Willner, I understand why you\nare doing this, but you cannot do it here. This is -- this -- this one of the freedoms we\nhave, they can take it or leave it, like many other things. And besides, we have so much\nfood, we\u2019re not hungry. I know there are hungry people in the world, n -- but not right\nhere at Camp Killmer. And we -- if they want to waste it, that\u2019s up to them.\u201d",
        "Q: Were you more sensitive to this because of what you experienced during the war?",
        "A: Oh yes. Of course I was more sensitive. I just couldn\u2019t see it, th-the food being\nwasted. And I -- I did get some comments from some people who were maybe foreign\nborn, most of them, who came to me and they said, \u201cI like what you did, Lieutenant, and\nthe [indecipherable].\u201d But the majority had no understanding, th-they just didn\u2019t care, or\nthey were never hungry. There were a couple of people from maybe some -- Montana or\n176\npl -- some out of the way place, who didn\u2019t have all this nice, solid food, who ate poorly\nat home, who didn\u2019t have much money. They had a little understanding for this. They\nwere more appreciative. But if you were -- if you are never hungry in your life, you\nalways had plenty of food.",
        "Q: Did this affect you when you were raising your children, your attitude towards food?",
        "A: Yes. But I had no problem with my children. I said, \u201cYou have to eat what is in your\nplate.\u201d I always made my children eat everything on the plate. And all that would say, \u201cI\ndon\u2019t want so much.\u201d I don\u2019t [indecipherable]. So we took it back, or eat it the next day.\nBut we had no problem.",
        "Q: Did you ever make your children go hungry, to experience what you did?",
        "A: Yes. Against the wishes of my wife, who was also hungry during the war, I not -- the\nfirst time I did this was I made them go to school without breakfast.",
        "Q: Why\u2019?",
        "A: Because the night before, and a couple of nights before, I bought pictures home of\nhungry people, skeletons walking around, children in Africa and some other place. And I\nshowed these to my children, and I said, \u201c\u201cThat\u2019s why I want you to eat everything. These\npeople would be lucky if they could lick your plate after you\u2019re finished.\u201d And so I was\nvery strict on that, and I did that one more time, I did it at suppertime. Let them go to bed\nhungry. I figured the only way you can understand what 1s -- but I decided later on that\u2019s\nnot going to work. They know they\u2019re going to get a meal the next day, and the people\nwho were hungry don\u2019t have that advantage.\n177",
        "Q: What was your children\u2019s reaction when you did this?",
        "A: They -- they understood. They understood why I was doing it. There no problem, there\nwas no problem. They were of an age that they understood, and they had -- they a-\naverage readers, they look at the newspapers, and I always brought home pictures of\npeople that were hungry, always, for probably years.",
        "Q: When you first got here to the United States, did you feel that people understood what\nyou had gone through? Did you feel they respected you for what you had gone through?",
        "A: The people I worked with, and the people I --",
        "Q: The people you came in contact with when you first came to the United States.",
        "A: No, there wasn\u2019t that much [indecipherable], occa -- in the military yes, there was\nmore of an understanding than the civil service. In the military we much closer to each\nother. And there were people that went through combat in World War two, who saw\nsome of the camps. Or people in -- were in Japan, prisoner of war. I got much more\nunderstanding sa -- from the military. The older ones, the ones that stayed in, not the\ndraftee World War two, he was out already, but people who were professionals, either\nofficer, or enlisted men, didn\u2019t make any difference, there were many -- oh, there was\neven one that I remember who came from a family, he was very poor, Italian family, and\nhe said, \u201cI -- I -- I like what you\u2019re doing lieutenant, cause I -- I grew up hungry.\u201d So that\nwas the extent of the conversation, but --",
        "Q: Did you, when you got here to the United States, did you search out for other people\nwho were survivors?\n178",
        "A: No. When I found out occasionally that somebody was, I would say hello, and Mr.\nKernic probably is the only one, coincidentally, we met, found out we were in the same\ncamp. We didn\u2019t know each other in camp. And as -- outside him, I\u2019ve met one or two\nthat I knew in Heidelberg. I met one one time from Poland, and --",
        "Q: When -- when you would get together, would you talk about your -- y-your\nexperiences to each other?",
        "A: I\u2019m sorry?",
        "Q: When you met these people, would you talk about your wartime experiences with\neach other?",
        "A: Yes, Mr. Kernic, yes. Mr. Kernic is an exception because he does not look at only the\nbad things, which -- I\u2019m the same way. We can laugh together about some experience we\nhad. How we got away with something. There was one particular instance, there was an\nSS officer, who was from the Rhineland, from -- near Cologne. Now that\u2019s where I came\nfrom. And he asked me something one day, he didn\u2019t hit me. And he asked Mr. Kernic\none time [indecipherable] just ow -- he told me this after the war, here in Washington,\nand -- that he was called -- we didn\u2019t know his -- not by his real name, but they called\nhim Tom Mix, because he\u2019s wearing his pistol cowboy style, a little bit to the side,\nhanging down. And he shot people. And Tom Mix was a guy about, I don\u2019t know, 25\nyears old maybe, but he hated Austrians, particularly Viennese, with a Viennese accent,\nand Mr. Kernic has a Viennese accent. And every time he saw him, he asked him\nsomething, he answered with a Viennese ac -- he hit him in his face. I said, \u201cOh you -- I\n179\ndidn\u2019t have that problem,\u201d maybe cause I he -- where I came from, but that wasn\u2019t\nbecause he liked Jews that much, maybe [indecipherable] a boy, and I grew up very strict,\nmy father disciplined, and when he came I stood at attention. Maybe Viennese people,\nthey didn\u2019t have so much discipline like German Jews. And I think Kernic agrees with\nme, that\u2019s probably was it.",
        "Q: What is Mr. Kernic\u2019s first name? Which camp was he in with you?",
        "A: He was in Blechhammer, which was also called Auschwitz three, which he told me, I\ndidn\u2019t even know -- never knew, a -- but he did a lot of research.",
        "Q: Did you have any kind of language barrier when you came here to the United States?",
        "A: No. I spoke English before I came here. English, French and Dutch.",
        "Q: How did you know the English?",
        "A: Little bit in school, most of it in -- in the army, when I was liberated, and I stayed with\nthe army for six months. That\u2019s where I picked up most of my English.",
        "Q: Do you --",
        "A: And by the way, Kernic\u2019s name is Ernest. I call him Ernie, I was thinking about it w --\nit\u2019s Ernest. Ernest Kernic.",
        "Q: Do you think you are a different person because of what you went through in the war,\nand the losses --",
        "A: [indecipherable |",
        "Q: -- and the losses that you\u2019ve had.\n180",
        "A: I don\u2019t know what I would have been, or become, what profession. I think I really was\ntoo young. I could say, well, like some people say, I wanted to become a doctor. I never\nhad that in my mind, and you go by maybe a member of the family. I was too young, I\nthink, I was -- I left, actually, my parents home when I was 11. I went to Belgium, I was\nwithout my parents. My father just put me on a train, got me out of Germany, after the\nCrystal Night. So that question never came up, even when I lived with the Dutch people.\nI -- I don\u2019t --",
        "Q: W-Was there a time 1n your life when you resisted thinking about what you had --\nwhen you tried to put it away from your life, resisted thinking about what you had gone\nthrough, and the losses that you\u2019ve had?",
        "A: Oh, I tried it several time. You have to I-live -- learn to live with it, and to the -- your\nexperiences, some are even valuable for the rest of your life, some of them, you forget\nabout it, and there\u2019s some things the b -- I learned in the camps that are certainly not\nusable on the outside.",
        "Q: Such as?",
        "A: Well, little things -- making things, for instance. I make a lot of little things, I invent a\nlot of little things. I am outside [indecipherable] upstairs [indecipherable]. I cannot lift up\nmy leg because I have Parkinson\u2019s very much, so I build something. All these little thing\nI learn because of the camp. But they have very little use outside.",
        "Q: Are you more comfortable around other survivors than people who have not gone\nthrough this?\n18]",
        "A: Am I more comfortable with what?",
        "Q: Are you more comfortable-ble around people who are also survivors than people who\nare not?",
        "A: No. No, no. No, no. The only problem I have with people who continuously cry about\nwho they lost, and -- and who I don\u2019t want to be exposed to. I lost also, by official count,\nby official document, there were 28 Willners, tha -- my father\u2019s name, who went in, I\u2019m\nthe only one who came back. But I don\u2019t continuously talk about it, but I made up\nsomething that\u2019s sitting up there for anybody who doesn\u2019t know, but they can read on the\npa -- I don\u2019t want to tell the story each time. So I have the names, birthdays, birthplace,\nand where they lived. So I -- I don\u2019t want -- frankly, I decided, after your interview,\nprobably, not to get interview again, because it\u2019s enough. Enough is enough. I -- it\u2019s like\nopening old wounds, and some of them, I -- I don\u2019t want to be reminded of it all the time.\nI want to live a normal life. I want my children to live a normal life. And I think I gave\nthem enough to -- not to forget, to be very conscious of it. My oldest son -- my father had\nan iron cross which he won during World War one, in the German army, and I gave that\nto my oldest son because he\u2019s an army officer, but besides that, he has stuff -- things\nhanging in his office that -- has his grandfather iron cross, and some other stories about\nhim. One particular story is not about him, but is about me, a one page thing. And it\u2019s\nwritten up by the federal government here, and it\u2019s a very short story, but it tells my\nstory. And I don\u2019t want to go into big story, but he has that framed 1n his office. And he\nwas, for awhile, the commanding officer of a heli -- attack helicopter p -- unit. Cobra\n182\nattack helicopters, before he went to the teaching business. That\u2019s what a young officer\nhas to do something to get ahead maybe, and he wanted to be combat officer. And he had\nyoung pilots come into his office, they had problems with their nerves, they were shaky\nafter certain flights. Not combat flight, but helicopter not working properly, being up in\nthe air, trying to get down, save your life. And jumping out of a helicopter, and five\nseconds later it was on fire. So these guys had problems dealing with this. And most\npeople who go into this know that, that that might come up. Well, I\u2019m sure my son had\nproblems, but he doesn\u2019t let it get ahold of him too much. He had a young officer come\nin, and one day told him that he had a problem, that he doesn\u2019t know if he can go on\nflying. He\u2019s not sure of himself any more. And he said, \u201cPlease go over there to the wall,\nread that story.\u201d He didn\u2019t tell him that was his father, and the guy read the story, and my\nson said to him -- he t-told me this -- \u201cYou think you have problems?\u201d He said, \u201cNo, sir.\u201d\nHe said, \u201cOkay, if you re -- you really have problems, you come and see me again. I\ndon\u2019t think you have any problem.\u201d",
        "Q: You said that -- that this will probably be the -- you\u2019re not going to be interviewed\nafter this, and my question to you --",
        "A: Excuse me [indecipherable]. Yeah, I need something. Yeah, please [indecipherable].",
        "Q: Do you have any special kind of dreams, or have your dreams changed since the war\ntime?",
        "A: Well, I used to have a lot of dreams in about -- a couple of years ago, about the\nconcentration camps, about some serious pictures of people hanging themselves, so --\n183\nbecause where I was in last camp, Langenstein, that happened very much, people gave\nup. And so I used to wake up in a sweat, thinking about it, but because I got so busy with\nmy children, all kind of activities, I started slowly getting away from the dreams. And at\nthis time, the dreams were, let\u2019s say about 10 - 20 years ago, about three times a week, on\nthe average. Dreaming about camps, sometimes even more. I dream now once or twice a\nmonth, and not so bad, because I had, two months ago hallucinations, but not about the\ncamps, that\u2019s because of Parkinson\u2019s. And they giving me too much medication, and I\nwas losing some weight, and I was overdose. So I two nights -- one time, one night was\nthe -- I had to go with ambulance, but that turned out to be nothing serious, except that\nthey reduce [indecipherable] medication. So, coming back to the camps, I got used to it\nafter awhile, but I lost a lot of sleep over it, but I wake up, and then -- but the main thing\nthat happened, getting away from there is my wife, keep me busy, doing a lot of things\nfor me, and our children. My wife knowingly why she was doing this, and I didn\u2019t want\nto involve my children, getting something for the -- they -- I -- I also keep away from\nthem, and I want them to keep away from me things. If I have something bad happens for\nthe day, something\u2019s -- maybe, let\u2019s say something -- something which says something\nabout being a Jew, or -- or being anti-Semitic, that would hurt me. But it depends who it\ncomes from. If it\u2019s from a private citizen, I don\u2019t give a damn, frankly. He can go and I --\nPll be very blunt, and I -- and if it\u2019s somebody intelligent, who is maybe my boss, or\nsomebody higher up, or in the papers, I get upset about it. So my children come across\nsomething like that, they want to tell me about it, they know not to tell me that evening\n184\nthey come home, or when they used to come home. Next morning, that\u2019s okay. I don\u2019t\nwant to hear anything bad in the evening, same thing for my wife. If she got a phone call,\nI was supposed to see somebody next day for a new job, or for something important, an\ninvestment, or something like that, I am -- wa -- she wouldn\u2019t know -- don\u2019t -- if it\u2019s good\nnews, you can tell me, if it\u2019s bad news, you keep it to yourself, tell it to me morning at\nbreakfast time. And it worked pretty well. Because you tell me in the evening something\nbad, I can\u2019t sleep. It\u2019s unfortunate, but it doesn\u2019t have to be about anti-Sem -- it could be\nabout anything, any bad news.",
        "Q: As you\u2019ve gotten older, do you think more about your wartime experiences?",
        "A: No. I -- I tell you why. I\u2019m trying to think why I\u2019m saying this. I do occasionally, in a\nfree moment, think about the [indecipherable] that\u2019s the way it was, or the way it went.\nIt\u2019s because my children, they keep me so busy, with all their good news all the time, that\nI can\u2019t think only bad news. That\u2019s really a fact. And really the pleasure, they grew into\nthis. My youngest son, who 1s back to school now, he comes back home, he usually has\ngood news in the evening, had a good day. If it\u2019s a bad day, he won\u2019t say anything about\nit [indecipherable].",
        "Q: When -- when your children turned 11, which was the age that you left your family,\ndid that bring -- was that a painful time for you? Did it bring back memories of the time\nyou left?",
        "A: These were not painful times for me, no. You mean at this time, to think about it?\n185",
        "Q: I was just saying when your children turned -- became the age that you were when you\nhad to leave?",
        "A: No. Not at all. I think it strengthened my children in many respects. I\u2019m\n[indecipherable], and it\u2019s not on purpose, but in -- in a way, it\u2019s my doing, they look up to\nme. | -- there are also some things in my life I haven\u2019t told them. Little things, no -- not\nvery important things, not about concentration camp. Little thing that happened, and I\ndon\u2019t bother them maybe an -- an older age. For instance, one of my sons, I hit him a\ncouple of times, just with my hand, I never hit him with a stick or a belt, or anything like\nthat. And if they did something that I punished one, and I punished the wrong one,\nanother guy did it. I would never hesitate go to my children, even 11 years old or\nsomething, and say, \u201cI'm sorry I hit you, and you didn\u2019t do it, or you did it, but I -- I still -\n- | didn\u2019t want to hit you in the spur of the moment, I did. I apologize for it.\u201d And I never\nthought myself too big to do that. And I think the children appreciated it, too.",
        "Q: Are you angry that you had to go through the terrible war experiences that you did,\nand other people, for instance, over here, didn\u2019t have to?",
        "A: No, not because other people didn\u2019t have to, but my wife tells me -- matter of fact,\nwe\u2019 ve talked about this morning, I\u2019m somewhat still angry, in -- in my background, in my\ndeeper -- inner -- inner -- in the -- I don\u2019t know how to word this. There\u2019s some things in\nlife that made me angry, and other people do, probably because of my co -- on prejudice,\nfor instance. Any kind of prejudice. And -- doesn\u2019t have to be anti-Semitism. I witnessed\n186\nsome prejudice in officer candidate school, Blacks, who were thrown out just because\ntheir color. Jews also, but you -- but you couldn\u2019t prove it.",
        "Q: But my question was, there were people your age in this country who didn\u2019t\nexperience what you did in Europe. Are you angry that you had to be the one to\nexperience it, and not them?",
        "A: Well, I\u2019m still angry at some things that have -- not really related to the concentration\ncamp. I get angry at my wife at something, maybe, that went wrong. And I said, \u201cYou\nshould have known better.\u201d Has nothing to do with the concentration camp, but down\ndeep is -- it goes back to the concentration camp, where I didn\u2019t want to do anything\nwrong, because it will cost me my life, or a beating, something like that. So there\u2019s an\nanger there. So we had something come up, a -- something very normal, and I got angry\nabout it. And I know that\u2019s the type of anger that my wife objects to, because it\u2019s not -- I\ndon\u2019t have to be angry about it, but I am. It\u2019s not the -- anything earthshaking. Maybe not\nsomething [indecipherable], 1t may be just statement. May -- I don\u2019t want to be specific\nabout something, but my wife makes a statement about something, and she doesn\u2019t know\nmuch about it, maybe politics, or something, and then my son 1s disc -- discussing with\nher poli -- I\u2019m just listening. And I said, \u201cHow can you make such statement? You don\u2019t\neven know this guy, you don\u2019t know about this guy.\u201d And that\u2019s the anger that I get, that\nshe shouldn\u2019t say that because she doesn\u2019t know this. The same thing [indecipherable]\nmy children.",
        "Q: Well, how does that relate to your camp experience?\n187",
        "A: Like I said, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s something -- it\u2019s an anger that\u2019s still there from the camps.\nThat\u2019s why [indecipherable] Dutchman, and we made a hell of a life. We thought alike,\nvery much alike. But unfortunately I have to say in his case, it showed on the outside, not\non the inside, he beat his wife, I found out. She told me, and I -- I told him that he\nshouldn\u2019t do this, and he never gave me an answer yes or no. So he did had -- did have an\nanger, too.",
        "Q: Did you feel that you lost part of your childhood that you\u2019ve never gotten back?",
        "A: I lost part of my childhood, and what?",
        "Q: And -- and you\u2019ve never gotten it back?",
        "A: No. I don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t think about that. That\u2019s true [indecipherable], I did. I lost a good\npart of my childhood. But I -- there -- best friends of my parents were German Jews who\nwere -- escaped to Israel, just before the war started, and the daughter of these best\nfriends of my parents, 1s -- the name of Inga Snitzler. She lived in vi -- in Vienna. The\nfirst [indecipherable] then they came here, after the parents died, she and her sister came\nhere. And I had a great childhood with her, because the parents were good friends.\nBabysitter babysat for both her and me, and when you went in -- we were invited to\nGermany one time, she came also with her husband -- unfortunately he died recently, and\nhe -- he didn\u2019t want to go to Germany, and I didn\u2019t want to either, I -- I was in Germany\nstationed, couple of years in the army, but the last trip was invited at the expense of the\nlike [indecipherable]. And frankly, if I had to do it again, I wouldn\u2019t do it, not because I\ndidn\u2019t get a good reception.\n188\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\n189\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer\ncollection interview with Eddie Willner. This is tape number two, side A. And you had\nsaid that you wanted to talk about your children, so this is your chance.",
        "A: Well, first of all I really should talk about my wife, who came before the children. The\n-- not the extraordinary children, but the extraordinary wife, which I feel she is, and our\noldest son -- first of all, we have six boys and -- no, I\u2019m -- six children, three boys and\nthree girls, and they range from 30 to 40. So we had all of them within 10 years. And they\nall accomplished already something in their life. They all went to college. Some of them\nhave two degrees, some of them have Master\u2019s, and one of them has -- the one in the\narmy, the oldest one, has a Master\u2019s, and a Ph.D., and is now teaching at West Point.\nNow, Albert, that\u2019s Albert Willner, th -- 1s 40, but I really don\u2019t know where to start with\nhis extraordinary accomplishments, and unusual interests, as the oldest of our children,\nlike I said, three boys and three girls. But before I start bragging about him, I should start\nat the source of all these, my wonderful wife, Johanna, a German born Protestant, without\nconverting to Judaism, has been the most supportive in raising our children in the Jewish\nfaith. All of our children have had 10 years of Jewish education. As for myself, any\n[indecipherable] believe in God, no matter what religion, is fine. The most important\nthing is what\u2019s in your heart. Because of my past, and in memory of my parents, 28\nmembers of my family, and so many who had to die just because they were Jews, I would\nalways remain a Jew. In summary, after my life -- after the concentration camps, the best\n190\nrita gud machoum, if you understand what means. It means restitution. It\u2019s not really the\nright word. Was not much success, but the fact for the millions of people that perished, I\nwas able to make up for the losses, if only one to one million. Six million Jews -- some\npeople ask me jokingly if I\u2019m trying to make them all up again. So, all I could is six. And\nthe -- like I said, the summary of my life after the concentration camps, the best\n[indecipherable] good amount of restitution was not my success, but the fact that for the\nmillions of people that perished, I was able to make up some of the losses.\n[indecipherable]. My anger with God, and we talked about anger before, and this with\nGod, being the only survivor of the Willner family, out of 28, has changed to\nthankfulness, permitting me to forgive God, and not the other way around. I can truly say\nthat my mission in life has been accomplished, and I will be able to peacefully rest some\nday among some of my liberators at Arlington National Cemetery. I feel very strongly\nabout that. And that\u2019s past life. I can truly say that really, some of these men a-are known\nto me by name, but I know th-they died during World War two, that Arlington Cemetery,\nwho paid with their lives, so that others like myself might live. And every time I walk\nthrough Arlington, I know occasionally on some holiday, I put some flowers down, and\nsome [indecipherable] of World War two soldier, and my oldest son does the same thing,\nwe just go and [indecipherable] and we -- he was also married in the chapel\n[indecipherable] military by a non -- I forgot what they call it -- non-demonush -- demon\n-- denominational chaplain, army chaplain. I feel that America 1s blessed with many\nthings, and I think particularly -- I\u2019m particularly thankful for the freedoms of speech,\n19]\nwhich has been especially meaningful for me, the freedom of speech. I\u2019m not talking\nabout [indecipherable] but the most impressive thing that I still think about all the time, is\nfreedom of speech. I can say anything I want, and not have to worry, even when I had my\ngovernment job. I can say I don\u2019t like this president, and I don\u2019t have to worry about\nsomebody standing at my door, and arresting me. Well, now to Albert\u2019s military career.\nAlbert, the oldest one -- and by the way, my wife and I agreed before we got married, that\nwe would like to have probably four children, and soon, because we got married, both, at\nan old age. I was 32 almost, and she was 30. And religion was going to be no problem. I\nonly stated that I want my children to grow up with the Jewish religion, not because I\u2019m\nSO Ss -- going to the synagogue, keep all the things my faith asks of me, because my\nparents died as Jews. In their memory, and my wife agreed, I felt if I had met another\nwife, who said, \u201cWell I\u2019m a Protestant, or a Catholic, but I got to [indecipherable] my\nfaith,\u201d she would have become Jewish, I would have asked her to, but -- but I felt that\u2019s\nnot necessary, like I said before. What\u2019s in -- what\u2019s in your heart, that\u2019s what\u2019s\nimportant. In her case, I knew particularly what was -- so Albert was born in Germany,\nthen went to American schools, some overseas in Japan. And finally he went to college\nhere in the United States, and he got an ROTC schol -- ROTC scholar -- scholarship. And\nhe happened to come out as the number one man in his class, and the first man that the --\ntop man who gets the scholarship at that time -- not gets a scholarship, c-comes out on\ntop, the first guy in his class, is offered a regular army commission, which is you can\nbecome a professional army officer. And I told him to take it, if he didn\u2019t like it, he can\n192\nalways leave the army later. So I wasn\u2019t aff -- afforded that opportunity, I came out a\nharder way, through officer candidate school. I\u2019m sorry, I have to drink some water first.\nMy voice is going out. So, to make a real, real long story short, after I finish the ROTC,\nand he -- he majored in political science, and he went into the army, got a regular\ncommission, then became a paratrooper, became a ranger, studied Chinese for three\nyears, went to China for one year on an educational tour, just traveling around for one\nyear. Then became a -- what they call a foreign area officer, studies foreign areas, they\nmust know the language. And then he didn\u2019t think that he should be just a soldier at a\ndesk, he should be a combat soldier. And I must say also, frankly, that I feel what\nhappened in World War two, when Jews were not able to defend themselves, I didn\u2019t\nwant my children to be in a position -- you don\u2019t know when it\u2019s -- could happen. There\nare people who would -- don\u2019t like Jews, and I -- I think German Jews particularly have\nbeen criticized why they went to the places of killing, like sheep. Well, nobody had a\ngun. In Germany nobody owned a gun, my father didn\u2019t own one, although my uncle\nowned a saber, which he brought back from World War two, but -- so I was very\nparticular s -- I felt very strongly about getting a military education, in the same time\nserving your country, and seeing to it that we remain a democracy. And the army can be\nresponsible, to a certain extent, provided we have the right leaders. And Albert went in,\nand then, since he wanted to become a combat soldier, not sit down and some --\nsomebody telling him, oh you\u2019re just a desk officer, he went to attack helicopters, and he\nwas -- he was taught to fly Cobra attack helicopters, which were very successful during\n193\nseveral wars. And then he became commander of -- of -- of the unit. Then he got\npromoted to major, and then every officer who wants to stay in the army, ma-make the\ncareer today, must have a Master\u2019s degree in one field or another. So the army gave\nAlbert 18 months to go to the University of Virginia, and get a Master\u2019s degree within 18\nmonths. Well, again, to make a long story short, he finished his Master\u2019s degree in\nforeign relations in nine months instead of 18 months. So he -- one professor was\nChinese, one of his three professors that he got close to. He said, \u201cAlbert, you finished\n[indecipherable] what are you going to do now?\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d he said, \u201cgo back to the army.\nTake whatever job they give me.\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d he said, \u201cyou are Ph.D. material, you know\nthat. So,\u201d he said, \u201cwhy don\u2019t you stay on and we\u2019ll be your sponsors.\u201d But he had to\nmake request to the army, and the army said -- no, first the professor wrote the army. We\nhave a young officer here, who finished 1n a -- 1n eight -- in -- in nine months, when most\npeople have 18 months to finish it. Can he stay here and go on to a Ph.D.? Well nobody\ncan finish a Ph.D. in nine months, they knew that. So he was told then, if he studies on\nhis own afterwards, they\u2019Il let him stay another nine months. So he stayed another nine\nmonths at UVA, and he didn\u2019t finish of course, but he studied very hard. He was married\nalready at that time, and his family left him alone at night when he was studying. Well,\nmake a -- he finished his Ph.D. in three years, and then the army send him to China, like I\nsaid, and then he went again into hel-helicopters, and when he finished that job, he\nneeded a job th -- for further promotion, he got that in Germany for three years, and his --\nthen the next assignment was in Washington, the Pentagon. He was the war plants officer\n194\nfor the Far East. In other words, he was responsible for the planning if there was any\nattack in the Far East, in Japan, Korea, China. That was the area of responsibility. And\nhe\u2019s now a lieutenant colonel, and two years ago he was interviewed for teaching at West\nPoint. And it\u2019s very difficult to get a professorship there, and there are two ways. You\ncan stay just for two years, on a regular assign -- or you can be -- ask to make it rest of\nyour career. If you do, you get a further promotion, you\u2019re assured to leave the army as a\none star general. And so he went to West Point. He loves it, his wife loves it. They are\nliving one block from the river, and his teaching is very nice, he likes it, he enjoy -- he\nalways wanted to teach. And I\u2019m glad he did it, with his background. And I mentioned to\n-- him before, in another part of the interview that he followed my Death March in\nPoland for one week -- for two -- for two weeks, and he retraced everything during the\nwinter. And he has many o-other endeavors that he did, pertaining to the Holocaust. So\nit\u2019s very close then he -- I don\u2019t have to tell him. He will -- he has now all of my papers\nthat he will organize, and go through, and he [indecipherable] source with my family, if\nany [indecipherable] for the Holocaust, he has the records, and he will get the -- the\ninterview tape, too. So I\u2019m very proud of Albert, he has accomplished enough, at a young\nage, and he\u2019s a great guy, and he has done many things to his -- my -- for instance, for as\nfar as mother\u2019s concerned, on his birthday he delivers -- or has delivered flowers to his\nmother for having me born. And they have a very good relationship with both father and\nmother. And the worst thing that I am concerned with, that if ever I ha -- anything\nhappens to me [indecipherable] children are good hands [indecipherable] why I was taken\n195\ncare of, but I am worried about having to go to an old people\u2019s home one day. I don\u2019t\nthink that will happen unless medically, it\u2019s impossible to keep at home, because I have\nsix children who will fight over having me in the house. So anyway, that\u2019s a good\nthought. Whatever happens, now that\u2019s another story. And they will take care of their\nmother.",
        "Q: Wh-What about your other children?",
        "A: Okay. We come to Nicole, our oldest daughter. Our oldest daughter was impressed by\nolder son\u2019s beginnings in ROTC. She didn\u2019t have ROTC when she started college -- and\nby the way, I must explain about education. I was a male chauvinist, I must admit that,\ncoming from Europe, from Germany. German, and whether Jewish or not, most men\nwere sh -- male chauvinists. And when I came to United States [indecipherable] start in\nhaving children, I thought, not having too much money, that the boys must go to college.\nWell very soon my [indecipherable] by my wife, and m-my daughters, and I felt in --\nmarriages sometimes don\u2019t last very long here. The women have to have profession, too,\nso they can make their own living. And I said, \u201cWell, the money\u2019s not going to have me\nsplit three ways to go to college, it\u2019s going to be six ways from now on.\u201d So how do I do\nthat? Well, I know how much money was avail -- and I had no experience with college,\nbecause nobody had st -- had started yet, and Albert was going to start. So I said, \u201cOne\nthing Ill assure you of, the first year\u2019s assured, for everybody. I -- I pay for it. After that\nyou\u2019re on your own.\u201d So I want to put a taste in their mouths what college 1s like, not to\nsay I go to work first, and like I have a lot of people that let their children go to work for\n196\na year, and they make so much money, and they don\u2019t want to get a college degree. You\nknow, why should I go to college, I can make more money not going? So I didn\u2019t want\nthat to happen, since I like -- like the education. I picked some up in the army, picked up\na degree in the army, but not like my oldest son. Because my main interest was a family,\nnot -- not studying. So some of them wound up with scholarships, or part scholar -- and I\nmade sure that, of course, they started first year, that was on me, and anything else later\non will have to be scholarships, or borrow money from a bank, or from me, if -- 1f -- if\nnothing -- if you don\u2019t -- couldn\u2019t get the money, but you pay me back, because we have\nto get some money for your mother to be on her own someday. I don\u2019t want her to be\ndependent on you. I -- I want her to have enough to live on if something happens to me.\nSo they all agreed. And I said, \u201cIf you need any money at the end of your college time,\nthe fourth year, and the third year, and you can\u2019t get any loans because your dad makes\ntoo much money, or whatever, you can borrow money from me, and no interest. And you\npay me back when you can, when you start working.\u201d And that\u2019s what happened every\none of them. The three last ones owed me each -- I don\u2019t know how much they owed me,\nbut somewhere around 10,000 dollars each. And I -- I agreed that -- like I said, no -- no\ninterest. If they can pay, they pay me back [indecipherable] hundred dollars a month. And\nif they good -- good at it, paying back the money they owe me, said they owe me no\ninterest. I will let them off when I can afford to. So as it turned out, the last three owed\nme about six, seven, 8,000 dollars, and I was at a point in time when I was making good\nmoney with the government, I said you all paid me back, what you could every month,\n197\nand y -- I -- I wrote it off, you don\u2019t owe me any money any more. Because I could\nafford, there was nobody else going to college. So they all understood, and they all were\nhelping, and they were -- and they continue to do so. So we go to Nina. Nina, or Nicole,\nwho is 39, the oldest daughter, is a terrific girl. After she saw her mother doing these\nthings in the military, and getting paid for it also, she volunteered after two years in\ncollege, to go out to ROTC. In the meantime, her brother was a battalion commander, not\nreally, but like -- but that the ROTC battalion commander. And she got also a\ncommission as a second lieutenant, and they gave me the honor to -- if I can appear in\nuniform, to be at the Pentagon, or at the college, and pin the bars on my daughter. And so\none side was her brother, and the other side was me, pinning second lieutenant bars on\nher. So she became a captain in the army, then she met her husband, she was Intelligence\nin Berlin, very interesting career. She was, since she studied psychology, they put her in\nIntelligence too, and she was dealing with the Russians in Berlin. We visited her, we\nwent to east Berlin. She went in uniform, because the Russians had an agreement, they\ndon\u2019t touch Americans. The east Germans wanted to, but they were not allowed to touch\nus, It was a very interesting experience. But anyway, Nina became a captain, then met her\nhusband at the advanced Intelligence school in -- and she married a guy who was\nCatholic, but he agreed that the children were now Jewish. So she got out of the army,\nhe\u2019s now a lieutenant colonel, he was -- his last job was -- he was military attache --\ndefense attach\u00e9 in Belarus, which is white Russia, or the city of Minsk, where a lot of\nJews lived, and still live. They have three synagogues there, and my daughter used to go\n198\nwith her husband to the Dubabitchka synagogue in Minsk. And he finished his tour last\nyear. They live here in Anendale, and she still brings her children up the Jewish way. She\nhas one boy and two girls. And she educates them a very nice way, play the violin, play\nthe piano, and so on. And her husband has been offered now, the next assignment as a\nmilitary attach\u00e9 to Czechoslovakia, to Prague. And I said, \u201cTake it, take it. That\u2019s a nice\nplace to go to, Prague.\u201d We -- my wife and I have been there one time. And so Nina 1s\nvery successful in many ways, particularly bringing up her children the proper way. And\nshe did the right thing to leave the army. She was a good soldier, she\u2019s a good mother,\nparticularly sh-she studies ecology, which [indecipherable] in the army, no, she was near\nthe mother. So, we come to the third child, Marcel, who is money-wise, the most\nsuccessful of all. He worked for a congressman, for our congressman as an intern. Well,\nfirst of all he went and he -- he got an appointment to the Air Force Academy. After two\nyears, his eyes were turning bad, he wanted to become an engineer, and a jet pilot. But in\nthis -- when he almost finished his second year, he was told by the air force that he\u2019s not\ngoing to fly, because eyes were getting bad from reading too much, but he was going to\nbecome an engineer, besides being a pilot. And he said, \u201cWell, what I g -- what am I\ngoing to do, I\u2019m not going to fly?\u201d \u201cWell, you go to missile silo when you graduate.\u201d He\nsaid no. I\u2019m not going to missile silo and be stuck two years the underground. And he\nsaid, \u201cI\u2019m resigning from the academy.\u201d Which he did. And I had told him, \u201cWell, you\u2019re\non your own. You had a [indecipherable], you had to stay four years afterwards, so five\nyears. And you going to go do something else, but you\u2019re putting me in a -- in a bind with\n199\nmoney, whi -- I was hoping you would get -- I wouldn\u2019t have to pay a penny for you at\nthe academy, but you quit.\u201d He said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Pop, don\u2019t worry.\u201d He went to the\nVirginia Polytechnic in He was good at math, and he got a -- first of all he got his two\nyears credit from the academy, because h -- if you leave after two years, you have a\ncommitment, and he left when he had two years, just in time. So he didn\u2019t have to pay\nanything back, and he got his degree in Applied Mathematics. Short story that when he\ncame out, he worked for the congressman, like I said, and then he applied -- and -- and --\nat the high school that his -- his high school as substitute math teacher. Well, then he\nbecame -- he was also winner in north -- northern Virginia wrestling matches, that\u2019s why\nthe academy was also interested in him, besides other things. Well, then he want his first\njob, he wasn\u2019t make any money with the congressman, that was free for the congressman.\nBut he was getting half a day at the school, he was getting paid for that. He said, \u201cI gotta\nmake more money.\u201d So, he applied for a first job, and he gives a reference the\ncongressman, one of the Beltway bandits, if you know what that -- people getting\ncontracts from the government. And the person interviewed him said, \u201cDo you have any\nreferences?\u201d Well, the school, and the congressman. Well he called both of them, and the\ncongressman took the phone himself, and he said, \u201cIn my 10 years as a congressman, I\nnever had a better intern.\u201d",
        "Q: Which congressman was this?",
        "A: That was --",
        "Q: It was Wolfe?\n200",
        "A: Wolfe. Congressman Wolfe. And so upon Wolfe giving him a nice reference, he was\nhired by BDM corporation. And he moved up very quickly, and since then, again to make\na long story short, in order to get ahead you have to change companies sometimes. He\nwent to work for Merck, big pharmacirculated company. And so Merck, he was a director\nat Merck, and he moved about -- well, he moved from Merck to Brussels for two years.\nHe was the European representative for Merck, and he got a big computer system started\nover there. And his -- he made a name for himself. He 1s now listed -- I don\u2019t know --\neven know what this guys name 1s, big -- the biggest guy in computers, who in the news\nall the time, young guy who made millions and mill -- he is listed as the guest speaker\nwith him, on something that\u2019s coming up. But again, he\u2019s changed from Merck. He was\nrecruited by Squibb -- by what\u2019s that firm, has three names? Another pharmaceutical\ncompany who is in Princeton, New Jersey, and it has the name of a British city. Anyway,\nit doesn\u2019t make any difference. He also is going out with a young lady that 1s very nice,\nspoke fluent French, which I love, and was good. He went out with her for nine years.\nShe wanted to marry him, he also wanted to get married, but he said, \u201cI don\u2019t get married\ntil I make at least a salary of 100,000 a year.\u201d Well, when he made it, he got married to\nher. But since then he moved up, and he became the executive director of Bristol, Meyer,\nSquibb, which also a very big fa -- he -- he\u2019s a wonderful son, not because he makes a lot\nof money, he is. And I could s-say many things, [indecipherable] two boys, wonderful\nwife, who came here yesterday while her husband\u2019s flying to Brussels. So that\u2019s him.\nThey live in Princeton, New Jersey. After Marcel comes Marguerite, and she\u2019s 36, and\n201\nMarguerite just got her second degree, [indecipherable] also a Master\u2019s in ec-economics\nand marketing. And she just got married, and she\u2019s the first one that got married to a\nJewish guy, who doesn\u2019t care a bit about being Jewish, and she is more Jewish than he 1s.\nHis parents were here, they\u2019re very Jewish, from New York, and he\u2019s a great guy. They\nall married -- they have all great partner, every one of them. And their -- their philosophy,\nor their desire 1s, if he doesn\u2019t fit in the family, I\u2019m not going to marry him, or her. And\nthey all fit in. We have the best all of six -- one is not married, the last one, of course.\nThey all -- we all get along, just not the in-laws, and they get along with us, and they get\nalong with each other. And they all kind -- we have three of them living nearby, they\nwanted to be sh -- be sure they take care of their parents, some of them, so one of them\nlives in Princeton, Marcel, and Albert at West Point, and the rest of them live around\nhere.",
        "Q: Is Marguerite working?",
        "A: Marguerite is working, and don\u2019t tell me what company, I -- I can never. She\u2019s\nworking for a big firm that is taking contracts, and that re-organizes people personnel-\nwise, and marketing, depending on the market. And she\u2019s what you might call a -- a\nwoman that takes care of problems for the company. She\u2019s a very strong woman, and\nthen we come to the next one, shall I finish the children?",
        "Q: Yeah, just a moment.\nEnd of Tape Two, Side A\nBeginning Tape Two, Side B\n202",
        "Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer\ncollection interview with Eddie Willner. This is tape number two, side B, and you were\ndescribing your children, and we\u2019re now up to number five.",
        "A: Okay, I will pick up some of the in-laws that I -- I don\u2019t mention much about them,\nabout who they are. Albert\u2019s wife -- her father was a naval officer on an aircraft carrier,\nhe was also a pilot. He\u2019s a very nice guy, he is also retired, and lives in Alabama.\nNicole\u2019s husband I mentioned, is also military, 1s also lieutenant colonel, recently in\nBelarus as a military attache. Great guy. And he and Albert are probably the -- the two\n[indecipherable] that are close together of all the kids because they in the military.\nMarcel\u2019s wife speaks fluent French, was working for a big advertising -- not advertising\nfirm, people who deal with money, and making up taxes for a big firm [indecipherable], I\nforgot the name. She does not work, she takes care of the two boys. Marguerite, I said,\nwas just married to a Jewish guy, who is also in finance. They don\u2019t have no children,\nthey live 10 minutes from here. Now we come to Satcheco. Satcheco, of course, was born\nin Japan. She is my daughter, and my wife\u2019s daughter, but we gave her a ja -- a-- a\nJapanese name, because we liked living in Japan. She\u2019s 33 now. She has an unusual job.\nShe is a adjudicator with the Virginia employment office, but actually she deals in\nunemployment, that\u2019s her specialty. She is in charge of a group who handles cases that\nhave been rej -- routinely rejected. And she gets a second opinion on it, and a decision\nwhether people should get unemployment or not, depending on whether they quit their\njob, or they were fired, or [indecipherable]. So the n-name of adjudicator 1s not the real\n203\nname, that is the professional name. She\u2019s also -- she called a -- I forgot what it -- it\u2019s like\nan administrative judge, I -- I -- I can\u2019t think of the name right now. Satcheco has the\nJapanese name, is named after a friend of ours. I mentioned the general and his daughter,\nwho come -- who -- who had a daughter who still comes to see us here once a year. And\nshe likes her name. She doesn\u2019t look Japanese, which surprises everybody when she goes\n-- they always look for Japanese [indecipherable] call her name. She\u2019s 33, and she\nmarried a guy and he\u2019s of Chinese descent. He is a engineer, working for the U.S. patent\noffice. And he is only Chinese in looks, a typical American boy. His father\u2019s already born\nhere, he\u2019s a [indecipherable] engineer. His mother was born in China, came here as a\nyoung girl. And she had a li -- a very big marriage, of all Chinese people, about 250 of\nthem, less -- a ye -- about a year ago, and she\u2019s now pregnant. And she keeps on working,\nand her husband, like I said, works for the patent bureau, and he does everything we\nwant. He is not religious in any way, but he\u2019ll go to synagogue if you want him to, but he\ndoes not -- [indecipherable] synagogue. But they both think cooked Chinese food 1s very\ngood. I think that\u2019s how they got together. But she\u2019s pregnant now, so she has to watch\nherself. And he 1s a great guy, as an in -- son in -- we -- we don\u2019t call them son-in-laws,\nwe just call them -- they call me Pop, and I -- I call them by their name. So his name is\nDarren, and the last one 1s Michael, the youngest one, who 1s really outstanding in a\ndifferent way. He\u2019s a big -- a real scholar. He went to UVA, and College of William and\nMary for one year. He also had a military scholarship, but he didn\u2019t take advantage of it.\nIt -- the military were not for him, and that was okay. So he got himself a degree in\n204\nforeign affairs. He is now working on the Master\u2019s at the Georgetown University Foreign\nService School, and he will graduate as a diplomat, I guess, up there. And he -- in the\nmeantime, he was awarded by the Department of Defense -- he worked this summer, he\nborrowed all the money to go to Georgetown, because I wasn\u2019t willing to pay for\nGeorgetown, he\u2019s 30 years old, he can do some work in the meantime, which he did. He\ngot himself employed by Department of Defense, in the Pentagon, in the Joint Staff, as an\nanalyst for National Security Affairs. And he was picked, he didn\u2019t know it when he\nstarted that two people get picked in the Pentagon, but he had to go to a new school. They\ngave out regular degree, and Master\u2019s degrees in National Security. And there was an\narticle in the paper, he told me down there, I didn\u2019t read it, Washington Post, about this\nnew university, or -- if it\u2019s called university, I don\u2019t have the name right now, but it\u2019s in -\n- and the school gives out is -- is -- 1s qualified on the national whatever, to graduate\npeople Master\u2019s degrees in national security affairs. [indecipherable] just started a school\nwhere you finish in one year, get his Master\u2019s. In meantime he gets 35,000 dollars, in\naddition, for his living expenses. But he lives here, but he will move out with a good\nfriend of his into an apartment in December. So he doesn\u2019t have to pay anything here,\nfood is free, the good food of his mother, which he will miss, and he lives in the\nbasement, that\u2019s his territory. I never know he\u2019s here, not here, and I don\u2019t have to pay a\npenny for his upkeep, or for -- he takes care of all this himself. He\u2019s terrific son, he\u2019s our\nbaby, a mother\u2019s baby. So that\u2019s the children, I don\u2019t think I left anybody out.\n205",
        "Q: Well, that\u2019s a wonderful family, that\u2019s a wonderful family. Let me just ask you before\nwe close, on a previous comment you made in an interview. You said that you were\nGerman, that was in response to some incident. Do you still feel German after all these\nyears? Would you describe yourself that way?",
        "A: It\u2019s a good question. I have to make a distinction, 1f somebody says, \u201cAre you German\nor Jewish?\u201d Some people come with the question. Well, I\u2019m German. That\u2019s my\nnationality, or was, was. Jewish is my religion. There\u2019s a big difference. Do I feel\nGerman, Jewish? I would say both. Because there\u2019s some traits in my character that\u2019s\ndefinitely German, not Jewish. And there\u2019s some of them may be Jewish. Now, I think I\nhave the advantage of taking the best of all three of these things, German,\n[indecipherable] take poetry, or some, and there was a German poem that kept me alive\nin the camps in the war.",
        "Q: Can you s -- can you say it now?",
        "A: [indecipherable]. Well, I can say it in German, but I will give it to you, it\u2019s in my\nwallet in English. Or my wife can send it to you, make a copy of It.",
        "Q: Can you say it in German now?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Why don\u2019t you do it?",
        "A: Unga vontzen trotsashaldin. Mira deshpoink kraftisi sang, houfidi amadai gotaiba. It\u2019s\nfrom Gerta. So that\u2019s definitely German. It means something basically -- the translation\u2019s\nvery ba -- not -- you cannot translate -- 1t\u2019s you are countin -- all power -- all bad powers\n206\nthat be. You never give up, you show yourselves in strength, not down being, and well,\nwhich also, I like to add something which I used in the army in a different way. When\nyou are a commander, or in charge of men who go into combat, you don\u2019t want to show\nthat you are scared. But everybody is scared. That doesn\u2019t make you an officer, or not an\nofficer. They\u2019re all scared the first time, or second or third time. There\u2019s no such thing,\nyou heard, as an atheist in a foxhole. Well, I -- I -- I -- my motto was, keep your fears to\nyourself, and share your courage with others. And that\u2019s why I teamed up with this\nDutchman in concentration camp. Sure we were scared, but we didn\u2019t show it to each\nother, and that\u2019s why I succeeded eventually, with lack of co -- now let me see about the\nother part. And in -- in spite of all this, you are staying alive, you\u2019re keeping yourself\nalive, by all means. And this German poem was -- really had a large responsibility in\nkeeping me alive.",
        "Q: Did you know it as a child before the war started?",
        "A: Yes, I knew it before I went in the camps. And actually, it\u2019s a lot li --",
        "Q: W-When did you learn it?",
        "A: It\u2019s ala -- probably in fourth, fifth grade. Very early. It\u2019s a very serious poem,\n[indecipherable]",
        "Q: Was this a poem that all the children --",
        "A: -- just took that part that -- that applied to me.",
        "Q: Was this a poem that all children had to learn in school?\n207",
        "A: All children in Germany, yes. And then later on, I changed to a Jewish school, because\nJews couldn\u2019t go any more. I had a Jewish teacher, and he was more German than the\nGermans. And I -- he was so strict, my father was very strict, that when I found him\nliving in the United States, in New York, after the war, he had not escaped to New York\nwith his wife, no children, but he had been hidden by two German f-families who were\nboth schoolteachers like he was, and hidden throughout the war. It would have cost them\ntheir lives if they were found out. That was my teacher, my strictest teacher, a guy I\nprobably hated at the time, who hit me a million times, and then I got it when I came\nhome, from my father, I got double dosage. So when I finally found him, he was 75, or\n80 years old in New York, I went -- I called him up first. I found out coincidentally, in a\nGerman Jewish newspaper which I read, and in a announcement of somebody die -- oh\nyeah, the people went Shanghai, I mentioned to you before, the girl that was in my class.\nShe said, \u201cYou know, our old teacher lives in New York?\u201d I said, \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t.\u201d \u201cMr.\nDamon lives in New York, he came after the war.\u201d I said, \u201cYou got his number? I want to\ncall him.\u201d I called him up same evening, and Mr. Damon said, \u201cOh yeah, Willner,\nWillner, I remember you.\u201d And I said, bull, he can\u2019t remember, he had thousands of kids.\nAnd he doesn\u2019t remember me. Maybe he remembers me for some of the bad things I did.\nSo he said -- I said to him for a joke, \u201cWell, Mr. Damon, I remember you, too, very well.\nAs a matter of fact, my rear still hurts.\u201d\u201d And soon after my wife and I went to New York,\nwe went to see him, and he -- we couldn\u2019t have done a greater pleasure to this guy. And\nhe was supposed to go with us to Germany, to receive some honors, in the city where we\n208\nwere invited for two weeks. He couldn\u2019t go be -- his heart -- his heart was not strong\nenough. He has died since.",
        "Q: You had s-said that your --",
        "A: Oh yeah, before he died, I wanted him to write a letter to address the German people\ninviting us, and say whatever he wanted to say to the Germans. Well, he was very nice\nabout it, he didn\u2019t insult anybody. And he -- I read the letter to a group of about 500\nGermans [indecipherable], and maybe 100 Jews, who came back from different -- from\nBrazil, from Israel, or -- and I could -- I became so emotional during the -- reading his --\nhis letter that one German came up to me, a newspaper guy, he said, \u201cWould you read it\nin front of German TV station?\u201d I -- I said I would. That was the greatest thing, I read it\nfor my schoolteacher, because he bared himself, and he took them to task, but in a nice\nway. And he also didn\u2019t suffer, he was hidden, he could say something good, and not just\nbad about the Germans. The two teachers hid him, and their wives, were not caught, and\nthen sor -- the part that you asked me about Germany, that\u2019s good and bad. And\n[indecipherable] able -- I -- I tell you s -- one thing, far as that is concerned, hate, or what\ndo you call it, when somebody -- guilt -- oh, collective guilt. I don\u2019t believe in collective\nguilt, never have. I don\u2019t think that all Germans are guilty. There are many Germans that\nare guilty, who knew about it, who didn\u2019t lift a finger. I\u2019m not talking about the SS now,\nthe real bad guys. So -- as a matter of fact, I would not be alive today if it wouldn\u2019t be\nsome German, who was somehow -- gave me a piece of bread, extra piece of bread, or\n[indecipherable] something. So, I said to my wife after the army, what are we going to do\n209\nby going in a civil service job. Well, there were many jobs open in Germany that time,\nfor Americans, and civilian. I said, \u201cI go back and get a job.\u201d \u201cYou would?\u201d Johanna\nsaid, \u201cI won\u2019t. I\u2019m finished with Germany.\u201d So I changed my mind since, I th -- I think\nmy wife was right. So that part of Germany, so you ha -- you have some good, and some\nbad, and some people -- I think if you hate people, all people like t -- you believe they\u2019re\nall guilty, it eats you up eventually, not the other person, the other person didn\u2019t --\nprobably don\u2019t give a damn. And people are sensitive. I -- I never -- I don\u2019t love the SS or\nsomebody like that, I don\u2019t say that, but that some people were good Germans. So there\u2019s\ngood Jews, and bad Jews. Maybe there were more Nazis then. But I believe today -- for\ninstance, what goes on in Israel [indecipherable] watch TV, I -- I think the Jews have a\npoint. The Arabs who cannot deny them certain things. Unfortunately it\u2019s a situation that\nis very difficult to solve, if at all. I -- I must -- I made a speech, and I haven\u2019t made many\nspeeches here, about the Holocaust. One was at the high school that our children went to,\nand the principal was of German descent, not Jewish. He invited me, and he said -- and I\ncouldn\u2019t turn him down. And he -- he not -- not -- he didn\u2019t take the ger -- the history\nclass, at that time [indecipherable] World War two, 1s -- he took 700 kids into the\nauditorium, and he said, \u201cI want you to listen to Mr. Willner, Albert\u2019s father.\u201d They\nlistened to me, and at the end of my talk -- so I talk about some of the experiences World\nWar two -- at the end of the talk one boy stood up, had a question, and he said to me,\n\u201cMr. Willner, you think it could happen here?\u201d I said, \u201cIt\u2019s a very good question,\u201d I said,\n\u201cves, it could. But we have a democratic government. But Germany had a democratic\n210\ngovernment too, when Hitler came to power. It can be turned around like you never know\nwhat\u2019s going to happen. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to happen here, not in my lifetime, I\nhope, but these people, bad people exist here, too. Who hate, who don\u2019t like Jews, don\u2019t\nlike Blacks, or whatever. And the same people that I saw in SS uniforms in Germany, I\nhave seen them, I\u2019m sorry to say, in our own army. Just put an SS uniform. People who\nwould kill Vietnamese women and children, think nothing of it. Gooks, they were gooks\nto them.\u201d And people were shocked, particularly the principal, he took me to his office\nlater on, I won\u2019t -- he was shocked because he felt, as a German -- he was born here, his\nfather was German, he said. And I told him, \u201cDr. Toombs, this 1s ridiculous that you even\nthink that way. What responsibility could you have had in what the Germans did because\nyour father is German himself? There\u2019s no such thing as collective guilt, not in my\nbook.\u201d Well, we really became very good friends, of course, we were already. And so\nthese -- and I must add that the same people, some people like that, exist even among the\nJews in Israel, who would go kill Arabs just because they\u2019re Arabs. I\u2019m sorry to say, but\nit -- that\u2019s the way I feel. So these bad people exist in any country, given a chance to do\nit. [have seen my own army, Lieutenant Calley, who -- who killed women and children\nin his [indecipherable]. He should not be in -- jailed, his superior should have been jailed.\nWhy? Because they knew he was a killer, and what he was eventually going to do. They\nshould have made him -- his commanding officer should have made a supply officer in\nthe back, where he can\u2019t do any harm, shoot women and children. So these people\n211\nexisted. And here, in peace time, the types exist and if they do something bad, they wind\nup in the penitentiary. In war time they get away with it.",
        "Q: Do you think the current interest in the Holocaust with the museums, and so forth --",
        "A: The current interest [indecipherable]",
        "Q: The current interest in the Holocaust, and people coming to museums and so forth, is\nsomething that will be permanent, or is it a passing interest?",
        "A: That\u2019s difficult to say. Depending how much we -- we -- we have to put a lot -- we\nJews have to put a lot into it. And other people who are not Jews, who think likewise, that\nif you don\u2019t protect certain things, or that people go [indecipherable]. Like yesterday I\nwas discussing the NRA. I got an application to apply for NRA, for the membership. And\nI talked to my wife about it, and I said, \u201cThrow it away.\u201d And she happened to listen to\nan NRA interview of this guy who is in charge, LaPierre. I wasn\u2019t here. And she told me\nabout it. Well, as long as we have people like that, we have to be active doing something\nabout it. And we have to keep going. [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Mm-hm. So you feel it\u2019s important to have museums dedicated to the Holocaust?",
        "A: Yeah. I think it\u2019s important. But it\u2019s not important maybe in some little town where\nnobody takes a look at pe -- it\u2019s the passing thing. And recently the name came up,\nHolocaust industry. I got a letter now they -- they -- th-they -- they -- they are -- they are\nelevating a wall in Paris, just like the Vietnam Wall here, with all the names on it. They\nwant my parents name on it, they want me to contribute money. I will not contribute any\nmoney, my parents don\u2019t have a grave, that\u2019s true, but I\u2019d rather give the money I have to\n212\ngive away to living causes, where it\u2019s -- well, I can tell you, I feel very strong recently\nabout certain incidents that had happened. And then I can think [indecipherable], which\nupset me very much. I was a contributor like most of -- most Jews, to the Jewish appeal.\nThey now write this letter that a Russian Jew, who came to Israel with his father, was\ndrafted, became a sergeant in the army, was killed in Lebanon or someplace, and they\ncouldn\u2019t bury the guy, because his mother was not Jewish. That\u2019s the Orthodox. No, I\ncould not live in Israel with people like that. I tell you very frankly, they make me sick\nsometimes. Some of them don\u2019t fight for their country, let some other people fight for\ntheir country. And when this happened to this guy who killed -- was killed for Israel, and\nthey couldn\u2019t bury him because the Orthodox wouldn\u2019t let them do it, and he had to be\nshipped back to Russia, to his mother. I thought [indecipherable]. At that moment I wrote\na letter to the United Jewish Appeal, I\u2019m sorry I don\u2019t have it right now, I don\u2019t even\nknow where I put it. And th-the president or executive director answered it personally. I\nsaid, \u201cI will not contribute any money because I know some of your money go -- go to\nOrthodox Jews, I don\u2019t support Orthodox Jews.\u201d And he wrote me a nice letter. I said,\n\u201cT\u2019d rather give the money to the Holocaust Museum, and not -- not the United Jewish\nAppeal, where I know some of the people, recipients, and just to run their schools, or\nwhatever.\u201d Let them do it themselves, I -- I don\u2019t approve of it. When they can\u2019t let a guy\nbe buried in the cemetery, even if he was buried in the corner, but they just said no for\nsome reason. [indecipherable]\n213",
        "Q: Is there any message you wanted to give to your grandchildren when they\u2019re a little\nolder. Do you have anything to say because of your experience?",
        "A: Well, I\u2019m sure my grinch -- grandchildren will be instructed by their parents. And\nthey\u2019re -- they have available all my tapes, and my -- no, at this stage I would say no,\nthey\u2019re too small.",
        "Q: No, I don\u2019t mean now, but is there a message to them when they\u2019re older, that you\nwould want to leave for them.",
        "A: They can see what I have to say, what their grandfather had to say on all the tapes and\nvideos, and they\u2019re a little bit different, but I think it drives home some of the things\nwe\u2019 re interested in, in seeing continuing. So -- oh, they get -- they will also get some\nthings in writing, and they have written poems. If you go to the next room -- I don\u2019t know\nif I can [indecipherable], I\u2019d like to just read you one poem that my oldest son wrote\nwhen he was 11 or 12 years old. You wouldn\u2019t believe it, and that\u2019s how the\ngrandchildren will think, too, I hope.",
        "Q: Would you like to read it? Okay.",
        "A: [ll let you read it, 1f I can get up [indecipherable].",
        "Q: You said there was a poem that your son Albert had written that you\u2019d like to read.",
        "A: Albert wrote this when he was 12 years old. \u201cThey were invited to death, and didn\u2019t\nknow it. The Nazis told them that there was a shower. Well, in a way it was. A shower of\ndeath. They were put in there, death started to rain about them. Cries, shouts, screams,\nprayers, and then death rested on their souls.\u201d He was 12 years old when he wrote that.\n214\nAnd that\u2019s very deep. And we have a few others that some of the other kids wrote, but\nthis, 1t was the one impressed me the most. And this is the kind of education he got\nmostly through my wife, poetry. She likes to write, she\u2019s writing a book, too. And she\nwrote lot of poetry. She has stuff accept by Hadassah, the Jewish newspaper, printed.\nAnd she had several other things. So, she must take credit for that. Not for writing this,\nfor putting this kind of spirit into him. And when you ask about the grandchildren, I\u2019m\nsure his children will continue to feel like he does. He\u2019s very quiet about it, but he speaks\nout when he should. So --",
        "Q: Is there anything you wanted to add for the tape, for the interview that we haven\u2019t\ntalked about? Anything you wanted to say before we close?",
        "A: [indecipherable]. I have not forgotten anything, but I would say that in general, we\ndon\u2019t disagree on any of the things I said, the children and I, because they have seen all\nthe videotapes that have been made, the things that I\u2019ve said. And in talking to them, I\u2019ve\nconfirmed, or reinforced some of the things I\u2019ve said. And the grandchildren I cannot say.\nI really cannot, to be honest. Some of them frankly will not grow up as Jews, but it\ndoesn\u2019t bother me, as long as they have in their heart, and they know something about\ntheir past, that I don\u2019t want the daughter to say, \u201cWell, my husband is Catholic,\u201d -- and in\na matter of fact -- well, that\u2019s another story. I\u2019m not going to -- she teach them how to be\nJewish, and she can do it. She takes it serious, so does Maggie. So the -- out of the girls\nbe -- the mothers being the ones that\u2019s really educate the children, because they\u2019re home,\nor because the Jewish religion, the Orthodox say so, that\u2019s fine with me. But I would say\n215\ndefinitely two [indecipherable] know right now, Marguerite and Nicole are educating\ntheir children -- Marguerite doesn\u2019t have any children yet, but she was going the way\nNicole goes, and her children, particularly the two daughters, getting a good Jewish\neducation. They belong to a synagogue here. They don\u2019t go much to synagogue, but they\ngo to the re-religious education. And they did the same thing in Minsk.",
        "Q: Do you think that the world has learned the lessons of the Holocaust, or will 1t ever?",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t think so. They -- they aware of it, but why -- why would the Blacks in\nAfrica care about all [indecipherable] their own. Why the many Chinese have been killed\nin some of the wars, millions. And they -- they don\u2019t think that the way we do, that Jews\nwere killed only because they were Jews, and there were different reasons. For the\nmoment, that\u2019s all still 1n people\u2019s mind, people are still alive, they experience it, but I\nthink another two generation, it will peter out somehow. It -- because they have the\n[indecipherable] with television now, I -- I will say one thing, or my wife at least thinks\nso, that if we had a television, it wouldn\u2019t have happened. Not in -- in that -- that way. So\nI think television will do a lot in the future to prevent things. Well, I-I -- I-I -- I\u2019m very si-\nsim-simplisistic [indecipherable] as far as that goes. I think the United States, I always\nfelt, we don\u2019t have ma -- many problems as Jews, but other people have, the Blacks. So\nin a way, if they didn\u2019t have any problems with the Blacks, they probably would have\nsomebody else [indecipherable] would be more. Might be Jews, it might be an Asian,\nKorean, Japan -- whoever. Or Blacks from Africa. But I don\u2019t think we have too much to\nworry about here, not in our lifetime.\n216",

        "Answer: Okay, I said before, I was born in Munchinglapba, which is in the Rhineland,\nnear Cologne, between Cologne and Dusseldorf. And I am a fairly good rec -- recol --\nrecollection. My mother already is born in that city, and my father was born about 20\nmiles from there. And my father got to know my mother because of World War One. He\nwas in the German army, in the front line, and just like today when we have a war, on --\nWorld War Two, families send packages to their sons, who are soldiers, or -- or\ncommunities do that to the sons of the community who are fighting wars. And so in my\nfather\u2019s case, he received, while he was in Russia, so-called care packages, and -- from\nthe Winter family. We had a Willners, and the Winter family had two daughters and one\nson.",
        "A: My mother\u2019s family. And so when the war was over, my father went to this home, and\n-- to thank her for the two years of cookies, or baked stuff they sent him to Russia. And\nthen they both -- the girl that sent these to him, my aunt, and my mother were not\nmarried, but -- and he -- my father, of course, 1s not, and he was looking around to see if\nhe could find a wife, or something. And he did not get interested in the girl that send him\nthe cookies, baked the cookies, but in her sister, younger sister, which became -- who\nbecame my mother.",
        "A: My mother\u2019s name was Augusta Willner -- or Winter, as -- here. And they got married\nin 1924, and two years later I arrived. The period in Germany, in that time, was bad, just\nlike in the United States. We had the collapse of the stock market, [indecipherable] by\nWorld War One, and there were many people without jobs, and many upheavals.\nCommunists and others. And so I -- I assumed that they knew each other since the end of\nthe war, since that\u2019s when he went there first, but they got married 1924. And so six years\nlater, and I arrived another two years later, I was the only child of -- and I also think I\nknow is shu -- that\u2019s reason my parents had only one child, because the situation -- the\neconomic situation in Germany was very bad, complete collapse. And my father did have\na job, and so we -- apparently, they had no problems, but they decided just to have one\nchild. And then Hitler came on the scene, and then su-sure enough, a lot of Jews didn\u2019t\nhave a -- had less children, and in my father\u2019s case, he lived, like I said, 20 miles from\nwhere I was born, and his father lived in that same house in the country, til 1941, and he\nwas -- then they took him out of his house, they took the house away from him, and sold\nit, the Nazi party, and they gave it to a Nazi, was -- and -- and so in -- in that house were\nall the belongings of the Willner family, which were demolished on the Crystal night.\nAnd I[ have to tell a story about my father, because it was different in many cases, 1n this\ncase, 1t was -- it turned out pretty good. When my -- when Crystal night happened, they\nburned the synagogues, and they demolished Jewish homes, stores, and wrote Jew on\nbuildings belonging to Jews. My fa-father went -- left the -- he knew there was something\ngoing on against the Jews, and he went to look after his father, lived by himself, almost\n80 years old, and -- but pretty fit, but he want to see then he\u2019s okay, so he | -- went there,\nand when he came to the house -- like I tell you, 1s a small community in the country,\nmaybe about 500 people living there. And he had a tha -- I think the house must have\nbeen built just before World War One.[indecipherable] and he walked in, and he knew\nthat something going on inside. As he walked in, he saw Na-Nazis in -- in uniform, the\nBrown shirts, smashing everything in the place. My grandfather standing by and,\nwatching, not saying anything. So my father walked in, he knew that he -- he shouldn\u2019t\nhave come, maybe, except for his father. And the chief of police of the little town of\nKlaifaht was there. The chief of police was not a Nazi, he was in uniform, police uniform.\nAnd my father walked in, he says, \u201cSiegfried,\u201d which was his name, \u201cwhat are you doing\nhere?\u201d The connection between him and the chief of police was that when they were little\nchildren, or boys, they sat together on a -- on a school bench for several years. And they\nknew each other very -- very well. So he couldn\u2019t, in front of other people, Germans, say,\n\u201cDisappear, get out of here -- here.\u201d He said, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know why you came here.\u201d\nHe said, \u201cWell [indecipherable] look after my father.\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d he said, \u201c[indecipherable]\nI\u2019m looking after your father, nothing happens to him. But see, I cannot stop these guys,\ntoo, what they\u2019re doing.\u201d They came from another city. They always sent in German,\nthey didn\u2019t use the same people from the same city, always from the next city, or so. And\nhe -- \u201cI cannot prevent any smashing of materials, but I will see to it that fath -- your\nfather isn\u2019t hurt. And by the way,\u201d he said, \u201cyou know your brother is in prison here.\u201d \u201cI\nknow.\u201d This was the son, the younger brother, who was li-living in the house with ma --\nmy grandfather, but had moved out [indecipherable] he got married. He was married to a\nChristian woman, whose brothers were Nazis, and asked her to divorce him under the\nNuremberg laws. And she refused. She said that in the good days she was with him, he\u2019s\n-- in the bad days were -- make a long story short, they went to -- with the help of a\nCatholic organization to Holland, which was, at that time, this was in -- this was in 1938 -\n- 30 -- \u00b039, beginning of \u201939. They went to a place in Holland, like a camp, but a Catholic\norganization was taking care of them, too. Moved them maybe to Brazil, or someplace in\nSouth America. And --",
        "A: I was at home, and nothing happened to me. I -- nobody came to our house. I went to\nmy school, I had to leave German school, because Jewish children could not be in the\nclassroom with the German children. And so I went to then, the new school, Jewish\nschool, one they installed in the back room of a synagogue, which was a Conservative\nsynagogue. And then I wanted to go to school, and see what happens, and somebody said,\n\u201cYour s -- your school is burning.\u201d Well, 1t was synagogue that was burnt, but the school\nwas in the synagogue. I wanted to take a look. Nobody bother me, some um -- most\npeople, I mean, didn\u2019t know I was Jewish, you know. And the incident there was\ninteresting. The Nazis put the thing -- this is a -- a [indecipherable] fire. And the -- the\nfire department showed up to put out the fire. And the -- not what the Nazis wanted, they\nwanted us to burn down, but they endangered, in many cases, the houses next to them,\nwhich were not Jewish houses. But -- and people protested, and so the fire department\nstanding by, in our case, had the water ready, and -- in case the flames would go out to\nthe side, to the other houses. And the police came, or was already there, in\n[indecipherable] and they said, \u201c\u201cWe want you to stop the burning, you endanger other\npeople\u2019s lives.\u201d And they said no, they going to burn down to the ground. So a policeman\ntrying to stop them, but they -- they couldn\u2019t, and the one policeman then went to a fire\nhose, which wa -- were -- were -- that were not in use, because they -- they want to burn\ndown, not put the fire -- and they only had them down for protection on the other homes.\nSo policeman took the hose, and started directing towards the synagogue. And one of the\nNazis, the Brown shirt came by, and with a dagger, cut the hose, so there wouldn\u2019t be no\nwater coming out, they quit. So that was my knowledge of the hol -- Crystal night. I\ndidn\u2019t --",
        "A: I heard the discussion.",
        "A: I -- later on they told me what -- people that I knew, what happened, they were ta -- all\ntalking about there were conflict with the police and the Brown shirt. Yes, I -- I did -- I\ndidn\u2019t see the actual cutting, but I saw the argument between the SA and the police. And\nthe police was pretty decent, our town. I have other example on that. And so they told me\nto go home, which I did. And I passed several Jewish homes, and they were all the\nwindows smashed in, the furniture on the sidewalk, nothing ta -- I didn\u2019t see anybody get\nhurt or anything, but some people did get hurt, but in general, in our town, nobody got\nhurt.",
        "A: And my father, like I said, he -- he left early in the morning to look after his father. So\nwe didn\u2019t know any -- was -- this was all about, and we could -- we could guess what this\nall about, but we didn\u2019t expect that. My father told us to stay home, just stay where we\nare. My grandparents were, on my mother\u2019s side, were also in the same town, about half a\nmile away. Nothing happened to them.",
        "A: Not my parents. My grandparents were. Not Orthodox, they were -- they had kosher at\nhome, but they didn\u2019t go to synagogue every [indecipherable] Saturday morning or\nFriday night. And my grandfather looked like a real Germanic type. He was blonde, had -\n- the hair he had left, had a big moustache, and he looked like a German peasant, maybe.\nAnd so he had a lot of friends who were not Jewish, and we had no -- no -- none in\nparticular [indecipherable] my family. There were other families who got beaten up,\nmany of them. Some of them because they [indecipherable] alone and they was enable,\ntook advantage of it, beat up a Jew, or smash his window. And in our place, the -- like I\nsaid, the police was pretty good. My uncle, my mother\u2019s brother, Neil, had been arrested\nCrystal night, and sent to Dachau concentration camp. He was also a decorated war\nveteran, he had the Iron Cross. He had -- he brought home from the war, his saber, which\nhe was allowed to, because of his rank, and he had the Iron Cross. So before 1 -- Cr-\nCrystal night, two policemen came to the -- to my grandparents home where he lived, he\nwas not married, and they said, \u201cWe have orders to pick up your saber, and your medals.\u201d\nHe questioned that. He said, \u201cWe are police, we are not Nazi party members. We have an\norder we have to carry out.\u201d Ma -- they were excusing the action. They didn\u2019t even want\nto do it, but they -- policemen had to do it. So my uncle said, \u201cOkay.\u201d He had a medal, he\ntook the medals, threw them on the floor, and, \u201c\u201cYou can also have the saber.\u2019 And he\nthrew the saber and broke the -- the blade. And he threw that on the floor to them. And\nthey were very apologetic about it, and, \u201cWe\u2019re just carrying out orders. We are sorry.\nIt\u2019s not our doing, but is our order.\u201d And they took -- and they took my great-grandfather,\nwhom I also knew. He got to be 96. He was also in the house, and he used to be a public\nschool teacher, and he had received for his work what they call the Hohnsellon medal.\nHohnsellon was the German Kaiser, of the Hohnsellon family. And he gave awards, and\nmedals out to people who are deserving, who did something for the state, or for the\ncountry. And he had that framed on the wall, the medal and certificate. And they said,\n\u201cBy the way, we have to take that, too.\u201d My uncle [indecipherable] military, but every\nJew -- Jews don\u2019t have the right to have medals any more. So, he took -- they took that,\ntoo. But they did no harm. So, to continue the story for my father. The police just took\nhim back to the police building, and the jail was attached to it, it was just a couple of\ncells. And the police chief said to my father, \u201cWant to see your brother?\u201d And they\nopened the door, and there are five Jews in there, men, his brother included. And they had\na -- they were playing cards. They had food in there, and they were -- you know what,\nthey were being nice to bi -- and he said -- he was [indecipherable], \u201cSay good-bye to\nyour brother, because frankly I don\u2019t know when you\u2019re going to see him again,\u201d this\npolice chief said. Well, they didn\u2019t think about Dachau, but that\u2019s where he went,\nDachau. And if my father would have been [indecipherable] he would have gone, too.\nBut, he -- the chief said, \u201cI don\u2019t have an arrest warrant for you here. They probably have\na [indecipherable] your hometown. So I have to make a call.\u201d And he called the chief in\nMitchiglumba, and he said, \u201cI have a,\u201d -- I think he said old friend of mine, apparently\n[indecipherable] and he didn\u2019t say, I have a Jew here by the name of Willner, and he an\nold friend of mine. \u201cI don\u2019t have an arrest warrant wi -- but he lives in your city. Would\n10\nyou check, please?\u201d He said, \u201cYes, he\u2019s on the list to be arrested.\u201d So the guy that was\nmy father\u2019s friend, he, \u201cOkay, I\u20191l send him back to you.\u201d Hung up the phone, and of\ncourse my father listened to all of this. And the chief said, \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what Siegfried.\nThe next bus is at 11 o\u2019clock, you will be on it, back to your home, and then you will\nreport to the police, which is what we agree [indecipherable] here.\u201d And he did like this --\nyour problem. So the other policeman knew, and --",
        "A: He winked at my father. And to make a long story short, the next bus, 11 o\u2019clock, my\nfather thought he was being sent back out with a police escort to -- the chief said, \u201cGet on\nthe bus. Report to the chief when you get there.\u201d No police escort, or -- and my father, of\ncourse, didn\u2019t report to the police. He -- he went home first and said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to\nstay here, they going to start looking for me,\u201d and he [indecipherable]\n1]",
        "A: Okay, we es -- we escaped, of course, from a transport of Langenstein concentration\ncamp, to -- we were going east. That I knew. I knew a couple [indecipherable] from a\nmap I had seen. I didn\u2019t have any maps. And Langenstein concentration camp was one\nthat was going to be a temporary camp for the building of tunnels, to produce the wheat\nto underground, because the factories were all bombed out by the ally. And Michael\nSwab, that\u2019s one of my best friends, and I describe Michael, how I met him in a camp.\nHis father was killed, and his brother-in-law. They were frozen to death. They came back\nfrom work and they had been told they did not perform properly, they were sabotaging\nGerman wer -- wer -- for these 150 germ -- 150 Dutch Jews, who had arrived at this small\ncamp, which was about 600 people, to repair railr -- railroads, and then -- so Mike\u2019s fa-\nfather and brother came back from work one day, and they were accused not having\nworked properly, and they s -- wanted to make example of them. They stood these people\nup in the middle of the winter, which 1s pretty bad in Poland, not like here, and they took\na fire hose, and hosed them down with cold water. Ordered them to stand, they couldn\u2019t\nrub themselves dry and warm, it was ice cold water. And to make a long story\n[indecipherable] by next morning they were -- most of them, they were dead. Mike\u2019s\nfather and brother-in-law, Morron. That\u2019s where we came -- there were f -- I spoke\nDutch, that was the other thing. I think I explained before why I -- how I came to speak\nDutch, I picked up a Dutch -- [indecipherable] Dutch was very inposit. So, when we\nemptied the camp, they had a new method, I thought. In the previous Death March, that\nwe had from Bleshammer to Roshosen, we marched everybody together, 4,000 some\n12\npeople that marched out. But there were other people came in from other camps, smaller\ncamps, so the -- Swallhallingpoint, which was our camp. And so, there were actually\nmore than 4,000, I didn\u2019t know that til after the war. All through my friend, Mizza\nKraning. And they decided, when we walked out of Langenstein, to walk out in groups of\n500, which was for better control, in case some people may escape. And there are 4,000\npeople coming, and -- which was good for us, too. Not every group had a police dog,\nGerman Shepherd, or had a lot of guards. Some of the guards were ol-older guys, older\nSS men, and they knew the war was finished, they lost. And so -- but, we didn\u2019t walk --\nwant to walk out, Mike and I, and we hid for awhile, and then we saw the Germans put\nup machine guns. I figured they\u2019re going to execute everybody in front of the camp.\nWell, they made a last appeal over the PA system, they said, \u201cThis 1s the last call,\neverybody get out of the back who 1s left, who is hiding. If you don\u2019t be marched out,\nyou will -- you know what\u2019s going to happen.\u201d So Michael and I decided we got up -- not\ndisappear, but in the final stand, sh-shoot out on the spot. We stayed there through some\ncases. We went to -- or came out of hiding, and there was a double wall in one of the\nbarracks, and we were loit the last group walking out, and we lucky we did, because I\nhave pictures from the v-video from the National Archives, that was taken on the camp,\nwe were in the middle, where the barracks were, the -- how do you call his? The\nappelleplatz in German, which was the -- just like soldiers have to be on the --\n13",
        "A: Yeah, for roll call. The last roll call, they said otherwise they -- they get shot. So\nMichael and I decided we\u2019re going, that well escape from outside of [indecipherable]. All\nthat has been ah -- always our friend. So we wen -- walked out with the la -- a last group\nof 500, or so. And we decided that we must escape. Oh yeah, we joined in the group, four\nother young fellows who were mostly Dutch, there was one other guy there, who we had\nconfidence in, we knew each other. Mike knew them better than I did. And they accepted\nme, and we -- we had decided that we will, during the night, escape into three different\ndirection, two each. We did two each, because that\u2019s always better than being alone, for\none thing, give you more encouragement. And then also, when we escaped, six, two in\neach direction, one back, and one forward, or one to the side, or whatever, that when they\nstart firing, it is much harder for them to get all of them, if they all bunched together,\nrunning away. And that we would have a chance to come out alive, that somebody\u2019s 1s\nget -- going to get shot, and somebody may be lucky. And the -- Mike Swab and I were\nthe lucky ones. We -- there were shots fired at us, but maybe by one or two guys in the\ngroup.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, frankly. They went in another direction. I assume, I cannot say, that they\nwere killed. They fired enough shots. And one thing I didn\u2019t mention, we escape, we had\nthe -- the -- the situation had to be proper -- prop -- had to be in such a way that they\ncouldn\u2019t follow us where -- where we were, didn\u2019t have the -- the personnel to do this.\nWe had just crossed a small bridge, and we knew that police dogs pick up the smell of an\n14\nescaping prisoner, or somebody else, particularly us, we smelt to high heaven. We were\nfull of lice, we -- w-we\u2019re walking skeleton. By then I\u2019m wa -- when I was weighed --\nweighted by American, 75 pounds when I was 18 years old. But we were healthy -- and\nMike\u2019s about the same. So okay, we decided we do this when -- I think the word is\npospicious. When the time is proper to leave. And the big thing that helped us was it was\na pretty dark night. They could not put on lights, the SS, to see who is running, or ma --\nbecause there were airplanes are overhead, Americans.\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "A: -- we had talked about this many times befo -- before our escape. We thought it would\nbe good to escape the dog or dogs, if we swam through a river, because they couldn\u2019t\npick up the smell in the water. And -- or, 1n case there was no water, they would go after\nthe prisoner, then bite them, go for their throat. And then by their barking, attract the\nguards, help them finish the job. So, when we crossed the bridge, for awhile, our luck\nwas on our side. We knew where the river was, we could just cross the bridge, but -- and\nthere were planes overhead, so we knew they couldn\u2019t put any searchlights on. And we\nwere told -- we were marching ranks of four, two to one side, and two to the other side\nsumweech. And the SS were -- they went a little bit further out, and we got -- then they\u2019re\ngoing to hit just as much as we would if they stayed there. And so here we were across\nthe bridge, and we said, \u201cNow.\u201d We all took off, and Mike and I, we | -- took off for the\nriver, because we didn\u2019t know they were planning before, who was going to be on the\n15\nriver side, who was going to be other way. Michael and I [indecipherable] and running\nthe other way, but running the river way. And we also didn\u2019t know who could swim.\nWell, we talked about it, and some guys were too weak to swim. And Mike and I could\nswim, which was no problem. And the river was a tiny little thing, but enough to get the\ndog off our back. And not dogs, and -- one dog. So we got into the water, which was of\ncourse, ice cold, and the dog got Mike in the leg, but we -- we want to strangle the dog.\nWe decided the dog is not as -- he\u2019s ferocious, but makes a lot of noise, and their dogs --\nwe have here the police department, who will also attack somebody, but not for the\nthroat, like these dogs were trained for us. And well, to make a long story short, it wasn\u2019t\n[indecipherable] the guy called off -- the guy in charge of -- I guess a group of 500, there\nwere two whistle blows, and I think that meant recall, I don\u2019t know, I think it meant\nrecall, because the dog immediately left us, and also ran back. We thought we were going\nto kill the dog and -- and -- because I know from doing this after the Holocaust, a dog that\nattacks you, even German Shepherd, and you get to the throat, and you get -- cut him off\nhis air, he cannot -- he may be able to bite you, but he\u2019ll tear into you everywhere, and\nthat\u2019s what we had thought we would have to do, but he was recall, and we went through\nthe water on the other side. And then made a U-turn, sort of through the back\n[indecipherable] you fear somebody\u2019s going to come across the bridge, and we don\u2019t\nwant to be here. And could hear at night better. Also if maybe they made a U-turn, too,\nand we meet head to head. So where to prevent all that? Well, we draw a split second\n16\ndecision, and well, we went and we saw a couple of f-farms -- farmhouses. I said, \u201cWe\ngot to get into one of those farmhouses, not wake up the inhabitants, and\u201d --",
        "A: -- so we hid in a potato cellar of the house, which was which was -- faces to the\noutside, and we s -- ate raw potatoes, and we left the house again because didn\u2019t -- we\ndidn\u2019t want to be discovered by the farmer. So we only travel at -- at night, in the daytime\nwe hid in bushes, to watch the sound of the artillery, we hear sounds of the arti -- it was\ncoming from, we figure out, the front line. And it was towards the west. There, I\n[indecipherable]. So, but we got a little bit confused, we didn\u2019t know, we didn\u2019t care\nwhere we were, as long as we stayed away from these -- so we hit one more time, and\nnear t -- near a village, outside, and we heard tanks rumbling. We were -- it must be the\nAmericans. We didn\u2019t see one German tank in there. We saw soldiers far away. And we\nsaid we have to do everything to get as fast as we can towards them. So when we -- one\nmorning, in the early morning, there were German old guys, and young guys, what they\ncall the li -- not li [indecipherable] volksdune, which were the guys that they got back in\nthe service, too old to be a soldier the front, or too young. And they were lay -- laying --\nlying in holes, real -- two guys per hole, or under vilv. We were afraid the American\ntanks were coming through, like as if they were not the regular soldiers, but they were\ncalled up again to serve. Well, how do we get past these guys, dincorner? Like I said, it\nwas very dark in there. And we listened first, and we figure out there\u2019s one hole there,\nand one hole further, but enough in the middle to crawl through. They can fire at us, but it\n17\nlooks as don\u2019t come out [indecipherable]. Didn\u2019t know the enemy\u2019s right across the field.\nAnd they wouldn\u2019t fire a bazooka or a det at the German weapon against tanks, which we\ncall a bazooka. And -- so I said -- we s -- we decide to crawl [indecipherable], and the --\nall of a sudden it got light -- oh no, be-before you -- you got through, this German called\non us, and we gave the password, and he called loud enough so you could -- everybody\ncould hear, there was -- it was quiet for awhile. There was nobody firing, it was a wait.\nAnd -- and he 1 -- asked for the password, and of course, didn\u2019t have the pas -- I said,\n\u201cHell mund.\u201d Shut up, I said. This -- the German army patrol, they call it the patrol. My\nGerman was good, you know, and I had heard command given before. Michael\n[indecipherable] me [inaudible] he spoke [indecipherable] German, but not that good. So\nI made up something, I said, \u201cShut up,\u201d to the German reconnaissance patrol. And he\nsaid, \u201cBut the password.\u201d I -- I -- this was all calling, ontaw, I didn\u2019t even see the guy, I\nknew he was in [inaudible] and I said, \u201cWe are from the -- I said some,\u201d -- I -- I -- I\nmentioned Germany. I don\u2019t remember what I said, I made up a unit, and then -- so I\napparently didn\u2019t get the password, but we\u2019re here for the same thing, we want to find out\nwho is front of us. And we kept crawling, we just didn\u2019t bother, and he didn\u2019t say\nanything. So, all of a sudden, it was like these guys were behind us, and we saw tanks,\nmaybe five time as far as the tree on the other side of the street.",
        "A: Yeah.\n18",
        "A: So before that moved up in the night, and sit still.",
        "A: Because they were going to move early in the morning, and -- which they did, when it\nwas light, and they had been ordered to move up, relieve another unit, and there was 16\nor 17 tanks. One company, a thir -- a third armored division. 32\" armored regiment. And\nwhen we saw the first American tank switch on the mo -- the engine, they started to\nmove, Mike and I came out with our hands up. We were the only people around that they\ncould see. And the moment we did that, they all stopped, and waited for the command of\nthe commanding officer, what they should do. [indecipherable]. Well, a couple of guys\njumped off the tanks, and we showed the number on our arm, and they looked at us,\nwe're full of lice, skeleton, he said, \u201cOkay.\u201d He jump on the tank. He as -- he said,\n\u201cWe're going to take you along. [indecipherable] this village fine.\u201d Okay. \u201cWhere are the\nguys with the panzerfow, or the bazooka?\u201d We said, \u201cThere are two holes hide behind\nthat, because we sneaked right through the middle.\u201d So a German -- a American who\nspoke German more or less fluently, a sergeant came up, and he had a public address\nsystem, was [indecipherable] thing. He said -- he said, \u201c\u201cWe know where you are, that\nyou \u2019ve been ordered to defend the village, but we just found out from two,\u201d -- he didn\u2019t\nsay [indecipherable] we came, \u201cwho have just come through there, who knows where\nyour positions are. We give you five minutes. Come out with a white flag, or we going to\nblast your village to pieces.\u201d And they gave them five minutes, and the tanks started\nforward, and the Germans came out with their hands up, a couple dozen all along the\n19\nvillage. And that was about all. They took them prisoner, but I don\u2019t think th -- at least\nwe didn\u2019t keep them. They were turned over to some other Americans, who came by,\nwho were supposed to take them to a pr -- a [indecipherable] or something. I guess --\nthey\u2019re all old guys, and young kids, six -- 15 - 16. And then so, we identified us, and\nthen we come -- the commander came, first lieutenant, and Lieutenant Hovlent is still\nalive today, a very nice, religious man, who gave permission then to -- that we stay with\nthem, that we didn\u2019t know where to go, and maybe show them where some other\nprisoners would be hidden, or liberated. That\u2019s why they sent the radio out, and also they\nwere giving wh -- well, I told them that the camp 1s probably about so many miles from\nhere, within a radius, if they should dispatch a column in their camp. And it had now --\nanother unit already got there and found the camp. Okay, so they went to the next village,\nand it was night -- evening, [indecipherable] to stay here, I -- that\u2019s where we going to\nstay. We thought they were going [indecipherable]. \u201cYou stay with us, you will sleep like\nus, you throw some Germans out of their homes, and they can go and find some friends,\nsleep with them. But we want a good, nice, warm place. And you can go with us.\u201d And\nLieutenant Hovlent, and his executive officer, who unfortunately, died recently -- because\nhe knew more about -- I coming to another story later on, than Lieutenant Hovlent. He --\nhe set up to a kitchen [indecipherable], about 150 soldiers, in a company with 70 tank,\nand, \u201cYou stay with the kitchen. When they sleep, you want to eat.\u201d Had to come to the\nkitchen to eat, but the kitchen [indecipherable] there. So [indecipherable], and he made\n20\nannouncement that these three young boys, [indecipherable] the kitchen, they can go in\nany time they -- they want to, and eat. Okay.",
        "A: Yes. Mike also, though not -- not very well, but like I said, one sergeant spoke\nGerman, and there was a Jewish soldier, too.",
        "A: That we came from a concentration camp. They didn\u2019t know about the camp, but they\n[indecipherable] when they heard from other guys, and I guess in their u -- papers, the\njournal they kept, yeah, the military journal the commanding officer keeps, what they did\ntoday, what they did yesterday, how much ammunition they have left, how many guys\nwent sick, and [indecipherable]. So we were -- spoke enough English to [inaudible], and\nLieutenant Hovlent never spoke very much, he still doesn\u2019t. He was a very religious guy.\nToward the fraternization phase, when the war was over, six months later, that peace was\nsigned. A lot of American, there was a -- not the law, but a rule, not to fraternize with the\nGerman, and it was more or less an -- an order, not to go out with German girls, because\n[indecipherable] available. And they wanted food, which the soldiers gave them, and they\ngot sex in return. But some of them -- many of the soldiers did, but Lieutenant Hovlent\nnever talked to a German, never touched a girl. And there was one more guy with them,\nHansen, who was of German descent, parents spoke German at home. He knew fluent\nGerman. He was in the kitchen with us. He slept with us. And I said one day to him,\n21\n\u201cNick, you told me you have German descent, your parents spoke German at home, do\nyou speak German?\u201d He ne -- he said, \u201cYes, fluently.\u201d \u201cAnd then why don\u2019t you speak\nwith some of them? Why do you make it difficult?\u201d He said, \u201cAfter what I -- you boys\ntold me, I\u2019m not proud to be of German descent, and I decided I\u2019m not going to speak any\nGerman.\u201d And he kept his word, he never spoke [indecipherable] he lives in New Jersey,\nNick Hansen, and like I said Lieutenant Hovlent was a very religious guy. He lives in\nMinnesota today. He has other children. His wife, unfortunately, has Parkinson\u2019s, too, so\nwe have another thing in common. But I lost Lieutenant Hovlent\u2019s contact one time when\nhe moved, and for years I didn\u2019t talk to him, or call him couple times a year. But my wife\nwent on the computer one day, and through research, she found him. And this was a\ncouple of years ago. And I call him up again, and since that time we\u2019re calling each other\nonce a month.",
        "A: No. Our work consisted of just watching them prepare the food and eat. And I picked\nup 50 pounds in three months, which was actually a danger, because a lot of prisoners\ndied from overeating, and also, I forgot to mention, one of the requirements to stay with\nthem was that we go to the battalion surgeon, to the doctor [indecipherable] and get ourse\n-- self examined, see that we don\u2019t carry any infectious diseases, the protection of\n[indecipherable] soldier. And well, we got examined by a doctor, and he decided we\ndon\u2019t have any infectious diseases. We are full -- we are full of lice, we have to get rid of\nthem immediately, so nobody else -- and about food he didn\u2019t say, he said they got to be -\n22\n- be fattened a little bit. He -- he -- th-they -- they weighed us, and that\u2019s why I knew five\n-- 75 pounds. And they knew that we were just skeletons, but healthy. So, we stayed with\nthe kitchen crew, and then they got orders to move onto another village, another va -- and\nthe same thing happened again, they soja -- oh yeah, I forgot. The first thing they did\nafter they came from the doctor is two soldiers [indecipherable] escort a -- to a rel -- toa\nGerman house. The woman\u2019s husband was fighting somewhere in Russia, and she was\nthere with one child. And he said, \u201cWell, we putting these two boys in your house, and --\nwhere\u2019s your husband?\u201d She said, \u201cIn Russia. Maybe he\u2019s dead,\u201d she said. \u201cWell,\u201d he\nsaid, \u201chow big was your husband, how tall?\u201d \u201cSmall, like I am.\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d he said, \u201cthese\ntwo men here are small, too. Show them the clothes that you had for your husband.\u201d\nWent into closet, and take -- pick out some clothes, and he -- they said, \u201cYou going to\nstay temporarily in this house, til you\u2019ve been deloused, you got some clothing and pick\nout what you want. And then when you finish bathing, we want to come for scout, we\ngoing to go leave you now here, and we come back with a medical team.\u201d\n[indecipherable] And the woman cried, and cried. We weren\u2019t -- we weren\u2019t going to do\nany harm to her, but she thought them were [indecipherable] come take her house away,\nand -- which -- so she had a big pot -- pot -- a big vat, where she cooked the food for the\ncows, and for the other animals, and she was taking care of all the thing. The thing was,\nalmost same size like the company -- [indecipherable] company has for cooking their\nfood for the Soviets, in big, round thing. A tub. And so she had one of those things in the\n-- where the cows are, in the --\n23",
        "A: Where the -- barn. And she asked, \u201cIs this big enough?\u201d I said, \u201cThat\u2019s good, we can\nboth get in there.\u201d [indecipherable] big enough, [indecipherable] was clean, you know,\nbut there were now smell of some food or something. The [indecipherable] smell was\nmaking us sick, not the -- not the [indecipherable] smelling food sometime, because we\nhad been -- we had -- the food that we had eaten for -- for a long time was just bread,\nmainly, and some ba -- bayjay -- what\u2019s the -- what cows eat they cooked in there, and\nthey gave them, and so on. Th-they this big, and not bir -- [indecipherable] is the German\nname. [indecipherable]. Let me think.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Beets, beets. They\u2019re special beets for animals, okay, but people can eat them, too,\nwhen you\u2019re hungry, you can cook them, the beet. And we used to occasionally steal\nthem from the fields we were working nearby. And so -- and the woman said we going to\nstay there, and we hadn\u2019t eaten dinner yet, she\u2019Il cook for us, too. I didn\u2019t know, and\nreally [indecipherable] back too. But that\u2019s what they wanted us, to stay overnight there,\nto get rid of all that [indecipherable] clothing that was full of lice. When I say full, my\nclothing must have been crawling with a couple of hundred lice, and [indecipherable],\nand we were picking up [indecipherable] but -- by having so many -- well, needless to\nsay, we got rid of all our clothes, we went in the tub, she made hot water.\n24\n[indecipherable] by that time these guys came with DDT, or something, and all\n[indecipherable]. And he said, \u201cWe gotta shave your hair once more.\u201d Our hair was short,\nbut had grown back already, little bit. We don\u2019t want there to be any eggs, or anything\nlike that. We said okay. And so we stayed all night. Next day we moved out, with the\n[indecipherable] -- and oh, when we got back to the kitchen, they said, \u201cLieutenant\nHovlent was here, he left some clothes for you.\u201d There was a pile on the floor. Uniforms,\nAmerican uniforms. You going to stay with us, right? Yes. [indecipherable]. He put some\nclean belted uniforms on, and no rank on it, because we didn\u2019t have any rank, we were\nnot in the army. And just a uniform underwear, [indecipherable]. So we looked like them,\nto make a long story short, we stayed six months with them. The war was over, but was,\nyou know, we got [indecipherable] sign the armistice, so we never --",
        "A: Six months.",
        "A: Okay. [indecipherable] the big story which about DP camps, that\u2019s where most people\nwent. But before I come to that, we stayed with them for so long, and we gained weight,\nwe were healthy again, spoke better English, and then they talked to us, they said, \u201cWell,\nwhat are you going to do, we\u2019re going to return to the United States, pretty soon, and we\nhad you here, and you had -- you enjoyed us, we enjoyed you.\u201d And well, I said, \u201cI will\ngo back to Brussels, where I have a sister of my mother living, was married to a Catholic.\nShe was the one that sent the cookies to my father, and she\u2019s probably still there,\u201d\n25\nbecause in the beginning they didn\u2019t touch mixed marriages in foreign countries. They\nwere coming there late August, decided when they have time to do it, but there was a war\ngoing on, that came first. And so none of the mixed marriages they didn\u2019t bother with\nright away. So, I said, \u201cI\u2019m going back to Brussels because all of my c -- my family\nagreed that\u2019s where we going to meet, at my aunts.\u201d And Mike said, \u201cWell, I know my\nfather\u2019s dead, and my brother-in-law. I don\u2019t know anything about my mother and my\nsister. I\u2019m going back to Amsterdam.\u201d So Lieutenant Hovlent said, \u201cWell, suppose you\ndon\u2019t find anybody there, what are you going to do then?\u201d [indecipherable] yeah, he said,\n\u201cYou were happy here, a lot of things are still mixed up. [indecipherable], after the war\nyou can stay with us as long as you wish, til we return to the United States. But we may\nstay here for a couple of years, we don\u2019t know.\u201d So we said fine. So they made out phony\npapers, military orders, with my real name on them, and for Mike Swab. No -- no rank on\nthere, not private or anything, and say Eddie Willner is traveling to Brussels, Belgium by\ntrain, by orders of colonel so and so. [indecipherable]",
        "A: And I went to Brussels --",
        "A: Oh, we didn\u2019t know much about the United States, they -- except the military. They\nwere great, they were enthused, they -- everybody tries to help out every, but these are\nthe people that [indecipherable]. There\u2019s another, unfortunately he is dead, too, I mean I\n26\nfound out an address, my wife did research at the computer, Brady Laird was a mess\nsergeant, he was a nice guy, and then I found his -- he sent me a letter, he said he never\nmarried, and the next time I wrote a letter to him, 1t came back. He had died. And so --\nBrady [indecipherable], and -- and the -- the other guys we made friends with were a\ncouple of guys, for various reasons. And one big Texan, he was huge, I have picture, he\nwas the largest man in the company, and when he stood with the arms stretch out, Mike\nand I were standing under his arms. I have an picture of that. He didn\u2019t fit into a tank, he\nwas so big.",
        "A: Yeah. And I -- we caught a couple of Nazis then, that -- the German population turned\nin some guys who are back, and our -- had to undress them, and [indecipherable] the\nuniform and put in some prisoner\u2019s uniform, and turn over to German police. And I even\nput on the German uniform, which I think fitted me, and got a photo of my hands up, and\nboots on the -- [indecipherable] fun with the company. We didn\u2019t have any -- any duties,\nor any work, although we participate a little bit in the kitchen [indecipherable]",
        "A: My -- well, my hopes were to find my mother, and father, and -- who knew I was\nthere, and find other member of the family, and to -- I had no plans, except go to\nBrussels, and maybe walk back to Germany, my hometown, and find my grandfather,\n[indecipherable] who had been sent to Theresienstadt, and who I don\u2019t bel -- I just found\nout recently that he died in 1944. How could an old man, whose 80 years old, last that\n27\nlong in [indecipherable]? I don\u2019t understand. I intend to check into it, he -- he was\nGerman [indecipherable] but he was a tough old cookie, but still being that way, he --\nhow an old man survived that long, and die from hunger, like some other. In\nTheresienstadt, there was no gas chamber, they managed -- they shot some people, in the\nmass of people. There were no max -- mass executions there because Hitler used as a\nshowcase for the Red Cross, and for international. And my wife and I went to\nTheresienstadt, and that\u2019s how we went to the room where my gr-grandfather lived. But I\ndidn\u2019t know at that time that he lived three years, and he had been thrown in a mass grave\nthere, that -- with [indecipherable] but not gas chamber. When somebody died they didn\u2019t\ndo away with the body, you saw that. Bu with the --",
        "A: By -- I got there by train, and with travel orders from the American army, which was\nillegal, but nobody questioned, I went. And Mike Swab went to Amsterdam, he didn\u2019t\nfind anybody from his family, so he went back to the Third Armored Division, and there\nwas -- and [indecipherable] where I don\u2019t find anybody. I come back and\n[indecipherable]",
        "A: Mike [indecipherable] got adopted by a soldier from the company, and got that way to\nthe United States. And I came back to Belgium, I put in my papers, I found a sponsor,\nand I had to wait for my affidavit to come in -- my paper. And I was finally -- I finally\nleft the United States, in December, \u201947.",
        "A: Yes, in a way I did, but I remember it made me so comfortable. The only -- frankly,\nI\u2019m sorry to say, the only guy that made me uncomfortable was a Jewish guy in the unit,\nbecause not what he did towards us or anything, 1t was the way he behaved. We came out\nof an anti-Semitic world, or group, and we -- myself -- we behaved, before we became\nprisoners, while we were prisoners, in a way that normal -- but em -- let me say I didn\u2019t\n29\nfin -- I hate to say this, cause it sounds like prejudice, but it isn\u2019t. Jews from eastern\nEurope are different Jews from western Europe, because they grew up in ghettos, the\neastern European, the -- the western u -- was integrated, like my family was. I didn\u2019t\nknow that I was Jewish until [indecipherable] I didn\u2019t know I was Jewish, I went to\nsynagogue, but it never concerned me, never gave me a problem. And then came the Jews\nfrom the ghettos, and with the pious, and other things, and I was in the impression, the\nway the Nazis made us look bad, the Jews, they said all Jews are merchants, or they get\nthe money out of pocket of a -- questioned the ma --[indecipherable]. I found out that\nsome of the guys who came from Poland, because of their surroundings, were different\npeople. And I look at them differently, just like the Germans -- the non-Jewish people\nlooked at Germans who -- or who are Jewish, and [indecipherable] they said they like us.\nWhereas in Poland, because living conditions in Poland said these are not\n[indecipherable] Jews, or whatever, they\u2019re different. But in -- in the American army, the\none Jew that I met in the company was not a nice guy, to start with, and nothing to do\nwith being Jewish, but he did some of the things that Jews were oft accused of. He tried\nto make money, and the way he did it, he gambled with soldiers, he took the money out\nof their pocket. I\u2019m not saying that non-Jews don\u2019t do that, but I was a little bit more\naware of things -- not to be criticized because I -- whatever I do is -- as a money business,\nor whatever. I was not in a position to anyway, but -- but there were things this guy did,\nand had w -- he won quite a bit of money, had already done this on the way over, on the\nship, had made thousands of dollars. And so I -- the others were [indecipherable] and\n30\nthey saw this, too. And they saw that we didn\u2019t associate very much with him, unless he\nassociated with us, he was a -- and he was from New York. He was what you might call a\nghetto type. Now, New York the ghetto, too. So New York Jews, I -- I -- I when people\nask me where you from, some people think I\u2019m from New York, cause I pick up a little\naccent from the three months I was there. And -- and so I wa -- I wasn\u2019t very proud of\nhim, he did a lot of things that didn\u2019t make me proud to be a Jew, or something I could --\nyou could say. I was ashamed for him. And so your answer to your question that the\nAmerican were nice, yes, they -- they were nice, I found this guy Hansen, didn\u2019t speak\nGerman because he -- he felt very badly about, from a moral viewpoint that this happened\nby his former people that he came from. And he didn\u2019t like that. Like Lieutenant Hovlent\nwas -- I found out after the war, was very religious, that\u2019s why he behaved that way, and\nthe guys also, I -- I compare notes with many people, but soldiers behave different in war\n-- in the war [indecipherable] conditions. Like the villages we were in, guys thought\nabout taking the women, maybe the husband wasn\u2019t there, and didn\u2019t make any\ndifference to them, and [indecipherable] it didn\u2019t happen our unit, not that anybody got\ncaught, but -- but the guy that I don\u2019t -- didn\u2019t like, he would have been capable of doing\nsuch a thing. He tried it one time, and I -- we told him, Mike and I, sta -- stop. He came to\nthe [indecipherable], I told you about that farm woman, that made the hot water for us.\nHe wanted to go to bed with her, and he put his weapon on the table like -- like a threat. I\n-- and, \u201cLouie, don\u2019t do that. I don\u2019t want to be a part of this. I had my problems with the\nGermans. I -- I do-don\u2019t do this because I love the Nazis, or that, but this 1s a human\n31\nbeing, don\u2019t do this. There\u2019s no -- this woman is not a -- walk around in uniform with the\nNazis, tha -- she is just plain farm woman, and her husband\u2019s at the front because he was\nordered that way. And you don\u2019t do this, be -- how would you come a soldier into your\nhome?\u201d And he ever -- absolutely had been drinking too. And we told him that he better\ngo home to his home. And he kept on, and we took away his rifle, because we thought he\nmight -- not do anything to us, but [indecipherable] well, and we just [indecipherable]\nthat he was the only one that we knew -- there may have been another guy was Jewish,\nbut -- but we had good experiences too, after, and -- with Jews, and non-Jews. But he\ngave me a bitter taste in the mouth, and I -- he got married, and later had kids, I called\nhim, and [indecipherable] but I never went to visit him, I just talked to him on the phone,\nyou know. And the guys was nice to us, why, I -- well, basically because what we had\nendured. And there were many, and they\u2019d seen pictures in the paper, and read about it.\nSo they probably felt a little sorry for us, but we didn\u2019t feel sorry for ourselves, so there\nwas no problem. We weren\u2019t -- we were treated okay, like men, and -- and there were\ntalks about them, we\u2019ll find a way -- they want to go to the United States, which Michael\ndid. So [indecipherable] many nice people there, aga -- or say that you thought the\nAmericans were nice. And we found out that a lot of them were of different background,\nlike Louie was one, then we found Irish Catholic, and we found all kinds of religions.\nAnd maybe because some guys were religious, or believers, that\u2019s why they were nice.\nAnd people were not so nice. Cannot say that they were not religious, but they -- th-they -\n- people like [indecipherable] that I said about Jews now, I [indecipherable] for the other\n32\nPoles too, who were not Jews, we had many experiences with them, too. Some of them\nwere worse than the Germans, some of them were in guards, or were [indecipherable |\nfrom the area, were sometime with Germany, and sometimes not. And when we had\nPoles as supervisors for our work, they beat us like the SS did. So, I cannot make\nstatement, all American are nice, or all are bad, or Jews, or whatever. And -- or Italians\nare a certain way. Yeah, I think that it\u2019s -- it -- it\u2019s [indecipherable], and we found out\nvery early that we didn\u2019t -- like Nick Hansen was German [indecipherable]. I disagreed\nwith him, I said, \u201cTalk to these people, not all of them are bad. If all of them had been\nbad, I wouldn\u2019t be here today. There were some good ones.\u201d But I -- my experience has\nbeen talking to people -- Americans, maybe Jewish people savay, that those who were not\nin the camps, hate the Germans more than the wa -- than the ones who were in the camp.\nThat\u2019s an unusual thing. Because they say all Germans are bad, some of them are -- all --\nall the Nazis are, they make -- don\u2019t differentiate be -- no Nazis. And so I saw Poles who\n-- that were very bad, and who are -- had German SS, and some of the Poles, and know,\nyou find bad and good everywhere, but being good, and being able to do good, also had\nsomething to do with material things. United States is a rich country. We had soldier\nchocolate there, had everything to eat. And it\u2019s easy to be a good guy sometimes, when\nyou have a lot of things, if that\u2019s what needed, bread, or something to eat, be hungry. And\nthen somebody -- the -- the person I feel is sometimes really good, a real great person,\nwhen they don\u2019t have much, and then give away something. And right now, I did pretty\nwell in life, professionally. I worked hard, and I -- I\u2019m glad I\u2019m not dependent on\n33\nGerman government because I came out sick for the rest of my life, and get a small\npension. The business that\u2019s going on now in getting back for the Jews, the -- some of the\nthings that they owned, paintings, or getting pension, because they -- bec -- like Social\nSecurity, they say if you worked as slave labor, but -- but the companies that that used\nyour slave labor should pay you compensation. I filed for it, I didn\u2019t want to. My wife did\nfor me, I sign it, because I -- I certainly earned it, and I yi -- I -- I know -- I know I wor --\nworked for what German companies, but I said they should have given it -- most people\nare dead already -- right after the war, and they\u2019re -- they\u2019re waiting so long til they\u2019re --\nno -- not many left any more. So when the money comes, I'll take it, but I am not going\nto use it for myself, I\u2019m going to give it away. To my wife, who has been good to me, can\ndo whatever she wants, and some percentage to a good cause, not necessarily a Jewish\ngood cause. In my donations, I include the others as well as Jews. And I don\u2019t need their\nmoney, and I -- I tell you, I\u2019m torn from the experience that really upset me. I got myself\nexamined by Germany, to file for [indecipherable] you know what the [indecipherable]\nis? Making [indecipherable], and normally you do that if you have a -- something happen\nto you, and you get -- you need medi -- medical help for your life, and the Germans pay\nfor it, some extent. Well, number one, I went in the army, for various reasons, to give\nsomething back to this country, as a civil service employee, in the army now, in the army,\nalso as a volunteer. And like I said, I got exa-examined, and they said to me, some\npeople, \u201cYeah, but you -- you act like a -- like the strong guy, you\u2019re a military officer.\u201d\nHe -- some -- some people said, \u201cYou don\u2019t look sick to me.\u201d And I said, \u201cI\u2019m not, I,\u201d --\n34\nbut -- but when you go in the -- the Germans, you got to tell them you -- you suffer. I\ndidn\u2019t. That\u2019s ridiculous. I\u2019m not suffering, I\u2019m happy, I don\u2019t need them, and -- but I did\nget myself examined, and they didn\u2019t pass the law, whether you have something or not,\nyou get the minimum, if you have been one year in a camp, or more. So -- but then they\ncame up with something else, not -- couple of years ago, which is like Social Security,\nsay they worked, but they didn\u2019t pay in, but we owe it to them. We didn\u2019t pay them, si --\nthey came out with German Social Security, and they sent me a letter, and they said,\n\u201cYes, you entitled that, but you must pay in the basic sum, so we can start 1n to -- to make\nit So many quarters, you don\u2019t have enough.\u201d Or whatever, I -- I [indecipherable]. So I\ndid that, and I figure I earned that. And they said, \u201cIn your -- with your background, you\ngot yourself education after the war, which we consider college education,\n[indecipherable] military [indecipherable], and you -- so -- so you entitled to it. Who are\nyou -- did you work for?\u201d And I did say it, and send the papers in. And then they said,\n\u201cYou got to get this exam done by a doctor in Washing, who 1s a confidential\u201d -- not --\nwhat do you call it, not confidential, who do it confidentially for the German embassy. I\nwent to see the doctor, was a German [indecipherable] in Washing, who had been taken\nprisoner in Africa, by Rommel, Africa corps. No, he was in Africa, but he was taken\nprisoner by the British. I start undressing for him to examine me, he said, \u201cWe\u2019re the\nsame age.\u201d And, \u201cYou were in a concentration camp?\u201d \u201cYeah.\u201d \u201cOh yeah,\u201d he say, \u201cyou\nhave a number.\u201d And then I took all my clothes off, he said, \u201cYou look better than I do,\nphysically.\u201d Whatever that meant, and [indecipherable] would see that he was going to\n35\ngive me negative, say this guy\u2019s in perfect shape, he [indecipherable] a mark on him.\nWell, I have a mark here.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: And --",
        "A: Well, that was from a big shot in the camps, and they took some guys for example,\nthey fired, and they going to liquidate us, an example. And I came out I think I have it on\nthe tape. We were left for dead, and the -- well they told me to use that, but the only thing\nI -- I was disqualified from the U.S. Army after one parachute jump. They told me that I\nshould not jump, I am not going to be a jump bump -- this is a good thing to do if you --\nif you [indecipherable] to jump, y-yo -- to show you got courage, to jump out an air-\nairplane. So the young officers all did it, I want to do it, too. And by the way, my\nchildren, [indecipherable] five out of six are par-parachutists. So, they had to do what the\nold man couldn\u2019t do. But anyway, then, so this Social Security from Germany, the guy,\nhe -- I thought he is going to send me a confidential report. He send it to the embassy. I\ndidn\u2019t see what he wrote, but he wrote nothing good for me that was in my favor, and\nnevertheless -- well, he probably was a Nazi, or anti-Semite. I don\u2019t know what he -- I\nhad that feeling all along, that he thought I was getting something for nothing, and -- and\nI didn\u2019t, you know, I was entitled to it. So anyway, when he came out, they made a\n36\nruling. After checking what could I have been, if I had, under normal circumstance, not in\na concentration camp, not having to go 1n the army to make a living, and to -- what could\nI have been today? They gave a wide -- well, they gave me a high category, officer in the\narmy alone, that the same thing, had went to college, or you become a -- a teacher, you\nhave to have a certain intelligence, and they told me they going to give me a high rating\nin Social Security, but in that case, if I want a higher -- rating higher income, I have to\npay them anyswhere between 20 and 40,000 dollar, whatever I choose of categories. It is\nnot well known, but the reason was -- and if I do not choose the high income, the lowest\none is you pay in 2,000 dollars, and you get [indecipherable] income when you\u2019re 65.\nWell, we had some friends in German embassy, and some other people [indecipherable].\nAnd there is Leo, [indecipherable] language when they have the German, and this guy\nwas the German finantha a -- finance attach\u00e9 at the embassy here. And -- and he said\nwhat -- any -- I said, if I had 20,000 dollar, 40,000 dollar, I -- I\u2019d rather invest it in here,\nin this country. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to be Germany to-tomorrow, but I\u2019m not going\nto give them any money. I don\u2019t have that money to spare, and I -- it just didn\u2019t feel good\nabout it. But the mistake I made [indecipherable]. So I -- I gave them 2,000 dollars. They\nadvised me I should get my foot into the door, I\u2019m entitled to it [indecipherable] like\nthose thing, but to -- to give to the la -- and then they give me small sum. Well, they came\nout with a small sum which was so insulting that I immediate -- I -- I didn\u2019t get upset\nvery often about things I -- they\u2019re sending me every month a check, they have been for\nthree, four years now, for 46 dollars. I think that\u2019s an insult for somebody who spent\n37\nthree years in a concentration camp. And that becau -- now, if I would have given them\n40,000 dollars, I\u2019m probably -- I don\u2019t know how much, I\u2019d probably get a thousand\ndollar a month income. I didn\u2019t do that. Well, I -- I would have liked to have that kind of\nmoney coming in, but I -- I -- I don\u2019t, and I do very well without them. But the small\ncheck is an insult, I think, for anybody, not because I [indecipherable]. I -- I -- I -- every\ntime I see that they have money come in -- so --",
        "A: No. When it comes to revenge, my friend Mike Swab tried some revenge, and I\nstopped him, because revenge is good for people who maybe you know did something\nbad to your family, or to -- killed people now -- SS, particularly. I feel -- felt that -- I\nguess if you know something about somebody, and the SS officer came to one of the\ntowns that we occupied when I was with the tank company, and Mike went up there, I\ndidn\u2019t know about it, had taken this gun along, we all were given a -- we both were given\na caliber 45 pistol in case there was some problem. But we were not to wear it, because\nwe weren\u2019t [indecipherable]. We didn\u2019t even have any documents [indecipherable], but\nthey were nice, and they said just in case, never know what happens. There may be a --\nwhat they call the werewolf, they may start again. A terrorism attack against the\nAmericans, even if the war is finished, whatever. It didn\u2019t happen in Germany, but they\nhated, like Mike, and -- I -- I can\u2019t even say he had hated, he [indecipherable] make it\neven with some people, this guy was an SS officer, whom some Nazis -- some -- no, not\n38\nnat -- some of the people in -- in whose house we lived thewa, had said, \u201cWell, these\nguys were in a concentration camp, he -- he got to be known around town that two of the\nguys with the Americans were in concentration. Well some people feel really bad, and\nwant to make -- do -- do us a favor by coming to us and saying, \u201cIn that house, that\u2019s not\neven occupied 1s a big Nazi, or an SS officer.\u2019 So somebody had told Mike there\u2019s an SS\nofficer came back, and then I [indecipherable] myself and Mike, we both would red if we\nsaw an SS, particularly an officer. And most of the SS were bad. There was such a thing\nas the waffer SS, you probably know, that\u2019s [indecipherable]. But they were bad. So he\nhad gone to this house, and I thought he was going to kill this guy. He pistol whipped\nhim, he hit him. When I hear screaming, I went in, and Michael said to me, \u201cThis is an\nSS. I want to kill the son of a bitch.\u201d Well, I said, \u201cNo, Mike. I don\u2019t have any sympathy\nfor this guy, but you going to be 1n jail again. You came out on one, you\u2019re going into\nanother jail because it\u2019s against the law in Germany, and you don\u2019t know if this guy --\nwhat he did. If you happen to know, maybe I can underst-stand, and other people will\nunderstand, too. If you knew him yourself, in a camp, or something, I think. But not this\nguy.\u201d Also was crippled, by the way, and I figured he\u2019s been punished. But we got out of\nthere, [indecipherable], and I said, \u201cMichael, don\u2019t ever do this again. I'll be your friend\nfor life, but my,\u201d -- talking about Mike [indecipherable] about him. My license plate on\nmy car 1s Michael\u2019s number on -- that was his arm. So I don\u2019t ever forget Michael. When\nhe lived in New York, and he died of cancer, he was married twice, the first wife died of\ncancer, too. He had a lot of bad luck. And when he knew he was dying, in Holland, I\n39\nwent to see him. And in Holland, you can die at home, [indecipherable] and you can also\nbe given a pill to h-hasten it, you know? I don\u2019t know what he did, but he knew he was\ndying, and my oldest son, and my oldest daughter came [indecipherable] to them, they\ndecided. And like I said, a couple of years ago I put a lifesaver card, they ask me\n[indecipherable]. I wasn\u2019t going to sell my whole story at that, I just [indecipherable] my\nbest friend had this number, and then he died. And you\u2019re going to make one special for\nyou. So I didn\u2019t tell him the story, so they said the governor allows only this and that. I\nsaid, \u201cLook, I go as far as [indecipherable] necessary.\u201d I think I want to do that a lot of\npeople put on their right now what they -- they\u2019re a veteran, or won a -- a m -- a medal.\nBut this guy was in concentration camp with me, and we both made it, and that\u2019s why I\nwant this special number. And I have that now permanently on my car. Some people said,\n\u201cWell you don\u2019t want to be reminded every day for the camp.\u201d I\u2019m not. I used to, but I do\nthink of Mike, at least once a day. And I told his second wife [indecipherable] no\nconsequence because he doesn\u2019t have that feeling for things like that. He\u2019s buried in\nHolland, as a Master Sargent in the U.S. Air Force. He went into U.S. Air Force, and he\u2019s\nthe one [indecipherable] so Michael -- we left this SS, and he didn\u2019t do it any more. So\nMike tir -- hated. I decided that hatred is bad. If you hate somebody who did something\nbad to you. It nags on you, it -- it -- 1t eats you up, hatred, and you become a bad person\nyourself. It\u2019s no good. I\u2019ve seen many people who will hate the German [indecipherable]\nGerman, and they say Nazis. I can understand that somewhat, or you find in Germany\n[indecipherable] today. I found some. I found some here, but -- in the army, but not bad\n40\nfor me to get excited about it. I think that\u2019s natural for some people to hate one or another\nfo -- or for one reason or another. The people way Jews hate them because they originally\ntaught that for awhile. The present Pope has tried to correct it, but in -- in United States, it\ndoesn\u2019t bother me if somebody\u2019s anti-Semite. I can tell them to go to hell. I can tell them\nin Germany too, to go to hell today, and nothing happen. People in Germany have\ndifferent feelings. If he then --\nEnd of Tape Two, Side A\nBeginning Tape Two, Side B",
        "A: -- was an enlisted man after I came into the United States, went into the army, and I\nwanted to become officer, but I couldn\u2019t because one, mostly for educational reason. I\nstopped my formal education in Germany when I was in seventh grade, and then I went\nto school in [indecipherable]. So what --",
        "A: We just said something about --",
        "A: I want to tell you, the reason it doesn\u2019t bother me here, because I know that no action\nwill be taken, prejudicial action. That somebody makes a bad comment, it\u2019s a free\ncountry, free speech, and to me, that\u2019s a greater thing here, living in this democracy, that\nit\u2019s not you'll have good food to eat, or be [indecipherable] one time, and that I -- this --\nthis [indecipherable] that as far as food is concerned, and many other thing, but the bigger\n41\nthing with me 1s free speech; that I can say anything I want. That I say in the office, I\u2019m\nworking for the government, the president\u2019s a jerk, I don\u2019t have to worry about the police\ncoming, picking me up at home because I said something against the president, I\u2019m a\ngovernment employee. This democracy, too. For people who never -- who were exposed\nto that, and we were always afraid of saying thing, [indecipherable] opinion about\nsomething, it means a lot. For somebody never had, like North Americans, it\u2019s -- it -- it\ndoesn\u2019t -- it\u2019s not very important, because every day we have an example, we say things\nthat under a dictatorship you couldn\u2019t say, and you have to worry about it. So I feel free\nthat even if something bad had said, nothing\u2019s going to come of it, they\u2019re not going to\nsmash somebody\u2019s windows because of that. It\u2019s just an expression here, and it\u2019s like\nsomebody said something about Blacks, nigger. My next door neighbor was very\nprejudiced when I moved in. He\u2019s my best friend in the street right now, a-always has\nbeen -- not all -- not in the beginning, but I noticed their opinion about Blacks, and they\ntalked about niggers. And our swimming pool here was segregated. I didn\u2019t know that,\nbut when I want apply for membership, I found out that my next door neighbor\u2019s also the\npresident of the swim club. And I went over to him, because you needed two people to\nsponsor you. That\u2019s how Blacks never got into the pool, because some people were\nalready in the pool, were not [indecipherable] some Black person to get in. Went to see\nmy neighbor, and I said, \u201cLook, I know you don\u2019t take any Blacks into the swimming\npool. I want to join the pool, but you probably not going to sponsor me. And I don\u2019t feel\nthe -- about Blacks the way you do. It\u2019s just blind prejudice, I don\u2019t think you -- I think\n42\nyou a good person, but you grew up that way, to -- not to like Negroes. And you get\ntogether people who think the same thing.\u201d And when the hou-house were being built\nhere, the superintendent said -- he had some Black workers here, and when he talked\nabout Black workers, \u201cWatch when they walk on the new grass. Don\u2019t let them walk on\nit.\u201d And I said, \u201cWhy?\u201d \u201cWhere a Black walks on grass, no grass will ever grow again.\u201d\n\u201cAre you kidding?\u201d I said, \u201cYou don\u2019t mean that. A joke or something?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d he said\nwa -- and that\u2019s the superintendent [indecipherable]. The next door neighbor didn\u2019t say\nanything about that, so I know how he thinks. So when I came to him the application, I\nsaid, \u201cYou probably not going to sponsor me, because you know how I feel about\nBlacks.\u201d \u201cOh here, let me think about it.\u201d Boy, and I give him time to think about it. You\nknow, I didn\u2019t want to start to be the troublemaker in the neighborhood. So I went to my\nwife, and I said, \u201cI don\u2019t think I want to join the pool here.\u201d Which would be a good thing\nfor the children. And then I decided, well, I\u2019m also depriving the children, my wife had to\n-- we had only one car, I have the car, and she -- it\u2019s good for the health to go in the\nsummer to the pool. I think I -- I -- I\u2019m going to talk to him. I went to him, and he said,\n\u201cTl sign you on, and I -- I get you another member to sign.\u201d I said, \u201cGood. But I also\nwant you to know I\u2019m not joining your pool to be a troublemaker. I don\u2019t agree with your\npolicies, and they going to be changed one day, and you know which side I\u2019m going to\nvote for, to let the Blacks in.\u201d And I felt that was necessary to say [indecipherable] know\nwhat kind of neighbor I am, and maybe he -- he won\u2019t have any part of me, but we\nbecame good friends, and he does anything for me I want him to do. He knows I\u2019m\n43\nJewish, and they\u2019re Southern Baptists. And Southern Baptists were automatically against\nBlacks in those days. I went out with a girl one time in Richmond, when I went to school\n[indecipherable] and she was Southern Baptist, she took me on Sunday morning to a\nchurch, and I said, \u201cI\u2019m -- this -- I don\u2019t see any Blacks in here.\u201d \u201cOh,\u201d she said, \u201cthey\u2019re\nnot welcome.\u201d I say, \u201cIn a church? Well, let\u2019s go then,\u201d I said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be ina\nchurch -- I\u2019m not very religious, but I don\u2019t want to be in a church that doesn\u2019t let\neverybody in. That\u2019s no church for me.\u201d So, come back to my neighbor, they don\u2019t call\nBlacks by nasty name. They are very dilerant. Their son, Ned Fortune, also called them\nniggers, and when he was very small, he changed. When he talked to my children, my\nchildren told him they don\u2019t like they u -- to use that word. And I really can see where he\nhad a change of mind. He grew up that way, and his wife grew up that way. So, that\u2019s\nwhy I think, in a democracy, where you can say every -- anything you want.",
        "A: I just started thinking about it. I don\u2019t remember at the time, but I would say that he\nbasically thinks I was right, and he did find out about me, what I went through through\nthe war, and he -- he was an en-engineer with the telephone company. And he -- he -- he\ngrew up saying this -- calling people that name, and that was just a daily thing where he\ncame from, and his wife. And he had second thought about that, and -- and to -- and to\nadd something to that story, his son, who 1s getting married next week, and we the only\npeople in the street who are invited to his wedding. That shows you how good friends we\nare, we are. Their son went to William and Mary. I think he went. And he -- his\n44\nroommate was a Black guy. And he changed his mind by living with a Black guy from\nAfrica, not American Black. And he doesn\u2019t -- he didn\u2019t use the word any mo --\n[indecipherable], but he still went to college, if he would have known beforehand that his\nroommate was a different color, he prob -- may [indecipherable], but he didn\u2019t. He had a\ngood experience with this Black guy, and he is changed. And he getting married now. So,\nFreedom of Speech, the greater thing, as far as I\u2019m concerned, in my life in the United\nStates. I have to g -- if I want to complain about something, I can go and complain. My\nchildren haven\u2019t been handled properly by people, by authority, by -- I have good\nexample there, and people did not think -- I didn\u2019t -- never think -- I never thought, for\ninstance, being Jewish I carry a chip on my shoulder, or it\u2019s something that I have to be\nashamed of. I\u2019m not even saying I\u2019m proud of it either, but I\u2019m proud to be a Jew -- ?'m\nnot proud to be anything else either, but I can be proud of something I\u2019ve accomplished.\nBut, well, maybe my ancestors accomplished something, that\u2019s why people call them a\nproud Jew. But I -- the people who are anti-Semitic here in the United States, can be\nfought against openly. In other countries, they call themselves democracy, but are not a\nreal democracy. And we have things that leave something to be desired, to -- maybe not\nthe Jewish [indecipherable] something else, or the Black, particularly, have -- they\u2019re still\nbeing prejudiced. I always said, well, as a Jew I can go [indecipherable] have the right\ncolor. But if you\u2019re Black on top of it, you don\u2019t accept in the first place, just because of\nyour color. But in America, there are many people -- and America has changed, even\nduring the ti-time I\u2019ve been here, for the better. It\u2019s not perfect, it never claimed to be\n45\nperfect in question of race, or -- or many other thing, but we can change things here, as\nlong as we stay a democracy, and have the [indecipherable] the -- that we have, the -- the\n-- if you discuss this wi -- Germany, for instance, there still 1s this not anti-Semitism, not\nHitlerism, or anything, but what basically in German\u2019s eye, my wife will -- like we could\nhave -- like a -- [indecipherable] sometimes too arrogant, and with this arrogance there\ncomes this prejudice, or they say this guy is this or that. The -- some people have certain\ntraits, Jews have certain traits, some of them not too good, and some are good traits. I\nalways point out on TV when somebody is Jewish. And my wife asked me one time,\n\u201cWhy do you think that he is Jewish?\u201d Not because of her [indecipherable] had to\nimpress her, but I think the children should -- they -- that\u2019s one part of the learning\nprocess, that you can be proud of some people -- when it\u2019s a criminal that\u2019s being shown\non TV that is Jewish, or -- certainly not. But I want to point out that people who invented\nthe -- a good example, in 19 -- soon after we got married, I was ordered by the army for\n10 days to Brussels, from Germany, to go attend the World Fair, and to visit the Soviet\npavilion there, and look at some things. And I don\u2019t [indecipherable] and I went the\nsecond time with the American joint media, we came from Washington, I came from\nHeidelburg, and because he didn\u2019t speak German, they said, \u201cTake him under your\nwings, he\u2019s one of our people,\u201d or -- you know, key people, \u201cand show him around.\u201d\n[indecipherable] too new to it, you already have some experience with speaking the\nlanguage. So this guy turns out to be a Christian American who was a -- who are the\n46\npeople who -- they are very simple religion, they all speak up. I can\u2019t remember the name\nnow, but is their religion. Not -- they have a very simple church.",
        "A: Quaker, yeah, Quaker. Very nice man, but he was anti-German. He told me on a boat\nabout [indecipherable] my wife was my fianc\u00e9e then, how I could marry a German. And\nnothing. I was German, too. I was Jewish as my religion, but so she was not a Nazi or\nsomething like that. And to me it\u2019s -- I don\u2019t think it makes any difference. But we\nwalked in the German pavilion from the Russian pavilion, and 1n the entrance hall had\nlife-size picture of a German no-Nobel Prize winners. And a -- more than a third or so\nwere Jews, German Jews. And this man, who was a Quaker, high ranking in -- in the\nPalmer defense, said to me, \u201cLook at this.\u201d And I said, \u201cI noticed, I know.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t get\nit,\u201d he said. We sat down the table eat lunch, the cafeteria, and there was a lack of space,\nand the waiter came over, and said, \u201cExcuse me, you have a table for -- you\u2019re only two. I\nhave two students here, would like to sit down, they\u2019re tired. Would you mind I seat them\nat your table?\u201d \u201cNo, go ahead.\u201d They sat down the table, they happened to be German\nstudents, and this guy saw red, the guy that was with me. And he said, \u201cDid you see,\u201d --\nhe addressed the German student, \u201cdid you see the Nobel Prize winners that are on -- how\ncan you have the nerve, Jews that you persecuted, take credit for them in your entrance\nhall?\u201d And I was shocked, and th -- I knew that -- but I didn\u2019t know he was going to talk\nlike that, and one of the German students said, \u201cWell sir, that was -- these people were\nbefore Hitler, and after Hitler, and Hitler did that, about the Jews. And we are proud of\n47\nthem today again. I\u2019m glad we are proud of them again, that they were Germans of the\nJewish religion, who won the Nobel Prize.\u201d But I never could convince this American\nthat I married a German, and several times happened to me here, in particularly Jewish\npeople. My own family [indecipherable], and the only family I had left [indecipherable]\nwas in New York, a distant relatives. I stayed with them for three months before I went to\nthe army. I slept in the kitchen. They had come in themselves to the United States right\nafter the war, and they -- when they were in Bolivia.",
        "A: They -- the -- this was my father\u2019s sister, Paula Friedlander, and my uncle Herbert\nFriedlander. They daughter is still living in Florida, only five -- five years older than I\nam. And where were we ma --",
        "A: You wa -- I want to say [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yes. My cousin lives in Florida, send a letter to me in Germany, I said I was going to\nget married, how could I marry a German? These were German Jews from Berlin, and\nshe couldn\u2019t understand. A matter of fact, came to a point where she was insulting. It\nwasn\u2019t about not being Jewish, but about being German. If your not Jewish they had no\nproblem with that, they were non-religious. So then I said to her, \u201cFirst of all, you are\nGerman, too, of the Jewish religion, or you were.\u201d And then you have to know the\nperson, know the family. In her case, I checked it out, they were not Nazi family. I could\n48\nnot, I don\u2019t think, for her parent\u2019s sake, that I could not marry Nazi family, who maybe\nwere anti-Semitic before I changed their mind. Even though their daughter may not be\nresponsible for this [indecipherable] 1t would be hard thing to do. You very much in love\nwith somebody, you can do a lot of thing. I -- I could have married in the family Nazi, bu\n-- but in -- I\u2019m getting off the subject -- in my office in Heidelberg was a soldier, a\nrabbi\u2019s son, who married a German whose family were big Nazis, and who told him\nnever to come to their home [indecipherable] Nazis after the war. And in my case, with\nmy cousin Flora, I then told her, \u201cLook, if you will not accept my wife, you don\u2019t have to\n-- you don\u2019t have to come to my house. I don\u2019t come to yours either, and I don\u2019t want\nanything to do with you any more. You reject her and you don\u2019t even know her. You\njudge a person not by the family -- I mean sometimes you can, but not -- 1n this case\nabsolutely not. So 1f you remain with this opinion or position, let this be the last letter\nbetween us, because I\u2019m going to live with her, not with you. So it\u2019s important to me.\u201d So\nmy aunt, her mother, wrote back to me. \u201cI know how you feel about the family, we\nhaven\u2019t got many left. Don\u2019t do this, cutting her off, not writing her any more, seeing her\nany more, some,\u201d -- but I said, \u201cI agree with you, very few people left. I am not making\ndecision, she is making decision. So I don\u2019t have to -- if she is against my wife, she is\nagainst me, and I don\u2019t like people who make judgments without knowing the facts,\nwithout knowing the person.\u201d To make a long story short, I married her, and because of\nmy job I was changed -- I\u2019m coming back to that again with some other thing\n[indecipherable]. I beca -- security, with a top secret project I was working on, they say\n49\nhe cannot be married -- the American army said, \u201cHe cannot be married to a foreigner.\u201d\nAs a matter of fact, even worse, not to somebody from the East Block country, East\nGermany, and -- because I\u2019m working on -- on a secret project. So, the army said, \u201cWe\u2019re\nnot going to give you permission to get married.\u201d But they changed their mind later on,\nhe got cleared, and I -- I married her. I -- I threatened the army that I\u2019m going to resign\nmy commi -- \u201cYou cannot stop me from marrying her. You -- you -- because I\u2019m going\nto resign my commission and leave the army. I have served enough time, I can get out\nany time I want to.\u201d And they said, \u201cDon\u2019t do that, don\u2019t make that quick judgment.\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d I said, \u201cyou stop me from getting married. If you come with me and say that\nshe\u2019s an east German spy, that\u2019s why [indecipherable], and I have top secret knowledge, I\ncan see, but you checked her out, that everything\u2019s okay.\u201d So to make a long story short,\nbecause of this assignment that was pending -- I didn\u2019t know about that, they send me\nand her to United States, and she became citizen, three weeks. They cleared her, and my\nboss said, she\u2019s as clean as [indecipherable] family -- about Communism, not about\nNazism, but I checked that out too, in the meantime, on a -- in a personal way. That was a\nk --",
        "A: I had friends who had access to paper, secret papers in the army. I was intelligence\nofficer, and there were other intelligence officers. So my boss, the colonel, came to me\nand said, \u201cWe agree, and I tell you something, that they won\u2019t tell you, but you work for\nme, that in everything I checked on your wife -- your future wife, came out as white as a\n50\nsheet. Absolutely [indecipherable]. Nothing suspicious. So -- but the new job that we\nhave you -- we have planned for you, your wife has to be a citizen if she is -- cannot be a\nGerman wa -- particularly from East Germany. So, the general wants to come and s-see\nyou. He -- he wants you to come and see him.\u201d A-And so I went to see the general, and\nhe said, \u201cWell Willner, we have you scheduled for a nice, plushy job. You going to work\nas our liaison officer at the German Central Intelligence Agency, okay? But a\nrequirement there 1s that your wife be an American citizen.\u201d If the guy is married that the\njob is given to. \u201cWell,\u201d I said, \u201csir, you know the problems we had first, and so you are --\nhe -- you find out what -- you find out what I can do for you to get your wife to be a\ncitizen, yeah.\u201d He -- he already knew, but he just wanted me to go through a procedure,\nto see what\u2019s involved. Well, in the middle of the week, had all the information I needed,\nI went back to the general, and he made the statement -- made the statement, sent me to\nthe Chief of Staff of the army in Germany, in Europe, and another general, and they s --\nmade -- gave off -- they gave statements that in the interest of U.S. security, my wife is to\nbecome a citizen as soon as possible. They didn\u2019t say that I was scheduled for a new job,\nthat\u2019s why -- they just said that -- they send us on a military plane back here, and my wife\nbecame a citizen in three weeks. She studied on the plane all the question they might ask\nher. So, she became a cit -- series -- I had to wait three -- three and a half years, and I was\nin the army.\n51",
        "A: So, we came back to Heidelberg, and her job -- she -- I met her in the American\nheadquarters, where she worked when she wasn\u2019t studying. She was studying languages\nat the University of Heidelberg, and when she didn\u2019t have any money left, she went to\nwork with the Americans, in an office. When she had enough money, she went back to\nthe university. Well, since she was already working in -- on -- without having a clear\n[indecipherable] needed up there, she worked on some non-classified stuff, but she had a\nGerman salary. When we came back from the United States, she was an American\ncitizen, and her boss was an American, of course, civilian. He said, \u201cYou posi -- your job\nhas changed. I couldn\u2019t keep you, because you not germ -- German any more. This\nposition was for a German.\u201d She said, \u201cOkay. What job have you got for me?\u201d He said,\n\u201cSame job, we will switch you. You going am -- federal civil service.\u201d And he got his\n[indecipherable] out of it. So it\u2019s -- overnight, she was making three times as much\nmoney, but unfortunately, my job was seen to a different location, and she had to quit that\njob, go with me. And that\u2019s what she needed a citizenship for. They knew all -- they\nknew all that in advance, that might change and that -- and that -- and if we had children\nthere was still something else. But -- so, we came back to Heidelberg, and we -- we live\nin government housing, and I got changed to another city in Germany, and became the\nliaison officer to the German CIA, for the army, and there -- I\u2019m going to speak about\nsome other interesting things.\n52\nBeginning Tape Three, Side A",
        "A: No, I going to start here.",
        "A: Okay, I\u2019m sorry we -- I\u2019m -- should have had part of my story before, and not now,\nand -- to be in the proper order of sequence.",
        "A: It doesn\u2019t matter? Okay.",
        "A: Okay, we go back to Brussels, where I went after the war and stayed --",
        "A: And at that time, I was all by myself, and I went to Jewish organizations for help, and\nI was very lucky. I was considered an orphan, but here was a 19 year old orphan. You\ndon\u2019t put an orphan of that age in an orphanage. But the head of the Jewish organization -\n- there was the HIAS, and the Joint Committee, the head to -- was -- not the overhead, but\none of the heads was a Mr. Muntzbah, who was in the internment camp in France with\nmy father, and I knew him, and he survived the war, and became an official in one of\nthese organizations. And when I went to see him one day, he said look -- I didn\u2019t have a\nplace to stay, I stayed temporarily with some people -- and I also [indecipherable] the\nDutch people I stayed with. He said to me, \"Well, we have an orphanage here of children\n53\nwho were -- who were in -- hidden by Belgians during the war, but whose parents went to\nthe concentration camps, and then the orphanage still we\u2019ve -- have a place for them\n[indecipherable]. So, I know they can find a place for you, but you will not be part of the\norphanage except for sp -- sleeping purposes. You can go after a career, or back to\nschool, whatever you,\u201d -- but they couldn\u2019t help me. So I said, \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll take the room.\u201d\nThey gave me a room under a roof, very nice. I went back to visit it two years ago with\nmy second son, my wife with me. So I was in an orphanage, and I was free to go, and I --\nit was arranged for me to -- they say, what do you want to learn to be? What do you want\nto be? Well, I had no idea, and they had -- some Jewish organization had the place to\nbecome a mechanic or something. And there were [indecipherable] people go to Israel.\nAnd I went in there and I went to school, and then I found a photographer there, who was\na -- the court photographer for Belgium some. He had a very big studio on a main street\nin Brussels, very fancy, very rich. And I was inter -- always interested photography, and\nhe was a Russian Jew who had lived in Belgium most of his life, who was involved in un\n-- during World War two, in a spy group, working against the Germans, that operated in\nFrance, and in Belgium. And there\u2019s several books written on this spying group, called\nthe Red Orchestra. The German Intelligence, the Gestapo call it the Red Orchestra. But\nmost of the members of the Red Orchestra were Jews, and so had been my boss, the\nphotographer. So he was very well known, and because of -- not [indecipherable] because\nhe was photographer, and he did take portraits, mainly. So I wanted to work in the lab,\nand I think he had two labs, one was for his real business, the other one probably for\n54\nsome other business. He and I got along fine, but in the meantime was being re-\ninterviewed by Jewish organizations, and they kept asking me about going to Israel.\nThese were American organizations, some of them are Israeli, or pa -- or Palestinian. And\nthey continuously tried to tell me I should go to Israel. I didn\u2019t have a job, I didn\u2019t have a\nprofession, I didn\u2019t have anything. But I was healthy, I was a body, and they needed\nbodies there. So, on one of the interviews, this Jewish interviewer said to me, \u201cWell, you\nknow, with your age, and your experience, having come out alive from the concentration\ncamps, and being healthy, intelligent, and whatever like that, right now learn to be a\nmechanic for photog -- photographer. These are the type [indecipherable] in Israel.\u201d I\nsaid, \u201cWell, I agree.\u201d He said, \u201cHow about you?\u201d I said, \u201cI don\u2019t like me. I have no\ninterest in Israel. I have sympathy for the Jews that found a new home there, who came\nlike me, out of the camps, but to me it\u2019s too much sand.\u201d I -- I needed to say something,\nwhy I wa -- that was really -- I -- I needed -- I don\u2019t like hot climates, that\u2019s one reason.\nThere were a number of things, and also it was not -- how should I say? Fancy, like going\nto the United States. This was a country developing, that didn\u2019t have their statehood yet.\nEverything was new, and it was going -- like going to military again in -- first, also. And\n-- and the United States appealing to me -- they did, because liberated by them. I ge -- I\nliked the guys. You asked me that before, why I liked them, and so all this and more\nappealed to me. And I was a western European, this was the Middle East to me, and --\nand -- and in one of the answers the guy said to me -- oh, I said -- why do you not\n[indecipherable] I said, \u201cWell, too much sand, and too many Arabs. I don\u2019t like hot\n55\nclimate.\u201d And he -- he looked at me, and I thought I had to say something, and I said, for\na joke, \u201cAnd too many Jews.\u201d And I thought at that moment the guy was going to throw\nme out of the office. But I -- I meant it as a joke. But too hot, and too much sand, that was\none of the things I really meant. In short, I wasn\u2019t interested in going to Israel, but he\ntried to push me. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t go, and -- but -- but th-the worst thing I did was when\nhe asked me, \u201cWhat are you going to do then?\u201d So I said, \u201cWell, I -- I try to go to the\nUnited States.\u201d I told you that once before. \u201cWell, have you got paper?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d I said,\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to get paper.\u201d And -- \u201cFrom whom?\u201d I said, \u201cI located a cousin of my father.\u201d\nApparently he is -- he was rich, because he had to have some money to sponsor\nsomebody, and everybody at the time tried to go the United States, not just Jews, eastern\nEuropeans who didn\u2019t want to go back to Poland, or somewhere. And he said, \u201cSuppose\nyou don\u2019t get the paper to go? What are you going to do then?\u201d Well, I thought about\nstaying in Brussels. I also had a quite nice girlfriend, and -- was 12 years older than\nmyself, a teacher, but that wasn\u2019t the main reason. I still wanted to go United States, and\nmake a new life for myself. And I already had tasted American life with the young men I\nwas with in Germany. They had a big influence, really, on me. Clean cut guys who\nalready knew something about war, and had traveled, and seen Europe, an-and a lot of\nother thing. Well, United States [indecipherable]. So, when the guy said, \u201cSuppose you\ndon\u2019t get your papers?\u201d Well, I said -- he was -- he was [indecipherable] \u201cIll go back to\nGermany.\u201d And I said back to Germany, because that\u2019s where I came from, where I knew\na lot of people, my parents had friends who were not Jewish. And when I said go on back\n56\nto Germany, he said, \u201cHow can you go back to Germany? The land did this for you.\u201d I\nsaid, \u201cThe land that some people did to me and my par -- my family.\u201d Well, we\ndisagreed, and again, like I said, he was going to then throw me out for sure, but he\ndidn\u2019t. And I was serious, but today I would say I would have made a mistake, because\nfor a Jew to live in Germany, like I said before, it\u2019s different than living, a Jew, here. I\nwould take real offense if I heard them all Nazi talk, and I have, in the military, on the --\nbeing American uniform, and understanding German, I overheard many things that\npeople said, in outdoor caf\u00e9, or what -- someplace.",
        "A: Anti-Semitic statements. Nothing out of the ordinary. Anti-Israel. And for that matter,\nI want to add this here, about German, and the talk I gave in high school about the\nHolocaust, that these people, like the SS, who did this [indecipherable] exist anywhere. In\npeacetime they become criminals because they shoot somebody, beat somebody to death.\nIn wartime they get away with it. They kill an enemy. So the people that did this in\nGermany, the same people we have in United States, too, only we have a different\ngovernment, democratic government, and for that matter, I think we have them in Israel,\ntoo. Iam sure that Jews who could kill Arabs, just because they\u2019re Arabs, who hate them,\nand Arabs who just can hate -- kill Jews, because they\u2019re Jews. Unfortunately, that\u2019s the\nway the world 1s. I think you have to be realistic about that. Hatred has always existed,\nwill continue to exist, and as far as I am concerned -- like I said before, it can tear you\napart. It\u2019s not good to hate. It [indecipherable].\n57",
        "A: Okay, I was interviewed for Palestine, too. Okay, start?",
        "A: Okay, one of the nicer things about going to United States, and waiting for papers,\nwas first when I found a sponsor. Was a distant relative of mine, cousin of my father, I\nhad never met before. But he turned out to be a rich man, but not very generous, because\nI came to United States with 10 dollars in my pocket, he did not pay -- want to pay for\nmy ticket on the ship, which would have been about a hundred dollars, or so. So I went in\nperson to his home in New London, Connecticut. I thanked him, and send him every\nyear, for Rosh Hashanah, a card. But he didn\u2019t answer. He really didn\u2019t want any\nresponsibilities. I felt -- I felt, I didn\u2019t say so, but I -- that if I -- this -- I had been in his\nplace, and a young boy comes over, missed out on a cation, has nobody, I send him back\nto school, maybe -- possibly through college, and if he want to [indecipherable] his\nmoney back for college, say, \u201cLook, you can pay me back when you can.\u201d But he -- this\nwas not the case, and there was also one of the reasons why I went into U.S. army. I want\nto be on my own, and as it turned out, I don\u2019t have to have to say thank you to anybody. I\njust did it on myself, I wasn\u2019t dependent on anybody. But one other lucky thing happened\nin Bozdoltz when I was sitting in a -- a sidewalk caf\u00e9, having a cup of coffee, was an\nAmerican sitting next to me, next table. He couldn\u2019t speak French, and I helped him\nalong, asking the waiter some questions. He turned out to be a big businessman from\nNew York, and he involved me in a conversation, and then I told him I waiting to go\n58\nUnited States, and he said, \u201cWhat are you going to do there?\u201d He offered me a job in his\nimport export business. He owned -- also owned a zipper factory in New York. And he\nsaid, \u201cWell, when you get to y -- New York, come and see me, maybe I have a job for\nyou.\u201d It turned out he did have a job for me, and I learned production of zippers, and I\nworked in -- he really wanted to employ me in his import export business, because I\nspoke language. I didn\u2019t tell him I was going to go to the army. I would have been drafted\nanyway, there was still a draft on at the time, and I would have had to serve two years. So\nhe lost me anyway. So instead, I enlisted in the U.S. army for three years, whereas a draft\nwould have been for two years, something like that. This afforded me an opportunity to\nget a high school diploma, and -- which I did all while working as a soldier, training and\nso on. And I -- from the time I applied, to the time I started with the U.S. army were\nabout three months. I went to Fort Dix, New Jersey for basic training, and stayed there\nfour months, and then this incident happened with this colonel, I think I might have told\nthat story.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t tell on tape?",
        "A: Well, I was chosen from my battalion, wh-which was at a strength of about seven to\n800 men, I was chosen the soldier of the month, that meant being a good soldier, and\ndoing things right, and handling weapons all right, and going to study certain items, or\nthings, that the army needed. Basically what a young soldier does who first comes in the\n59\narmy, nothing special. Well, out of this, based on the points you win, through the months,\nI got the highest points, and was named soldier of the month. That meant having the\nhonor of sitting in the colonel\u2019s office, on Saturday morning when there was no training,\nand answering his telephone, on -- on the -- on his -- yeah, outside -- sit -- sitting outside\nthe colonel\u2019s office, with the adjutant, who was a captain. At that time the colonel was\nreading the New York Times, and all of a sudden, very loud he said, when he read the\nheadlines in the New York Times, which said Israel a state, United Nations has voted to\nwelcome Israel into the nations of the free world, or -- and the colonel said to himself, or\nmaybe so everybody could hear it in the office, \u201cGoddamn Jew politics.\u201d Well, the\nadjutant knew that I was Jewish, the colonel didn\u2019t. He wasn\u2019t very much interested in\nthe soldier of the month. To him it was just another soldier answering telephone --\nalthough I did get a certificate from him for that. And he -- I -- I wasn\u2019t sure how I was\ngoing to respond to that, he didn\u2019t say this to -- to me, just to himself, expressed\nsomething real loud in the office, and I walked out, and I wasn\u2019t going to have the honor\nof sitting in this man\u2019s outer office. The adjutant came after me, he knew what I was\ndoing, and he knew that I\u2019d understood what the colonel had said. He was very\nembarrassed, and he asked me to please come back. He didn\u2019t want to make a big issue\nout of this. I said, \u201cNo, I just came here to the United States, and I admire the freedoms\nwe have here, also freedom of expression, but -- but not improper things like -- like that.\u201d\nSo he underst -- said he understands, but it wasn\u2019t his opinion, and no -- he didn\u2019t think\nanybody else in the office, just the colonel\u2019s opinion. Well, I said I can understand,\n60\neverybody\u2019s entitled to his opinion, but not 1n a position like he is, make a blanket\nstatement like that. So, the final thing was that I did not go back to the office, and in\nleaving him, he said, \u201cWillner, remember for the rest of your career, that all kinds of\npeople make this world.\u201d And I just remember that sometimes.",
        "A: | -- I -- I really, at that time, could care less. I mean, I didn\u2019t -- I -- I -- I didn\u2019t think of\nthat I\u2019m afraid of being -- I don\u2019t think that could have happened to me, knowing already\nwhat I knew about the U.S. army, that everybody\u2019s pretty much the same, and people are\npeople, there are good ones and bad ones. There\u2019s always a rotten apple somewhere. But\nthere also good apples on top. So, it didn\u2019t bother me. Particularly, I was very con -- not\nconcerned, but aware of the freedom that people had here, and this was part of it. When I\nfinished that basic training, was a battalion at Fort Dix, my luck started. The whole\nbattalion was ordered to Alaska, about 700 men or so, and I was in despair. I thought if\nI\u2019m going to be in the army, I\u2019m going to use my language background, French or\nGerman, or both, but what about Alaska? Besides it\u2019s very cold there. So from my\nviewpoint, I also had to consider -- which I always considered, giving back something to\nthis country, and I was debating with myself, well maybe I should go to Alaska, like\neverybody else, but again here\u2019s free speech, I can open my mouth and say I\u2019m better fit\nfor Germany, or France. I can do the army more good, and perform better than being a\n61\nsoldier. Many soldiers better than I am, they can shoot better, and do this better, that\nbetter. And I decided, no, I should not keep my mouth shut. And particularly I thought\nperhaps, being soldier of the month, maybe somebody remembers me, and they will talk\nto me, because not normally down in the army that you go and complain [indecipherable]\nwith reason. So I went to see another officer who was in personnel, and I said what I\u2019m --\nI\u2019m -- I\u2019m not norm -- not normally in the habit of making complaints, this not a\ncomplaint, a suggestion, I would appreciate look into this. That -- that [indecipherable],\nas you know, I said, the battalion, infantry battalion is going to Alaska, and I feel that I\u2019m\nwasting my time, and I\u2019m wasting the army\u2019s time by just being a soldier. The only thing\nhe has to know maybe, to fire some weapon, and I can do that, but I can do much more if\nI\u2019m 1n a position in -- in Europe someplace. So the United States at that time was all over\nEurope, except in the east. And so, make the long story short, he didn\u2019t say yes or no, but\nhe said, \u201cYou'll be notified.\u201d I was n-notified the next day that I\u2019m taken off the orders.\nSo that was the first day, it didn\u2019t say I was going to Germany, but then I went around, I\nwas excited. I went, asked some people, some -- most people didn\u2019t know, but then I\ncame up on the sergeant who said, \u201cYeah, I\u2019ve seen your name. I think you\u2019re going to\nGermany.\u201d Well, I -- I was hoping he was right, and it was true. I went to Germany, and\non the ship to transport were some other foreign-born people, also in the army, mostly\nPolish, or Czechs, in total about 10. And when we arrived in Germany, in Bremerhaven,\nthe security people came on board, and they said, \u201cYou, you, and you, and you. You\nremain here.\u201d There was myself included, another guy from [indecipherable] Germany,\n62\nand about seven or eight Poles, and one or two Czechs. And what this was, they were\nhunting spies. The -- the [indecipherable] Intelligence had gotten information that some\nof the people who claimed to be refugees from the east, were not -- were from the east,\nbut were not refugees, they pretended to be. They want to get into United States, and spy\nfor Russia, or Poland. But they check everybody out then, including myself. Anybody\nwas fa -- I forgot to say, I was not a citizen at the time. And everybody -- oh -- oh -- amo\n-- among these 10 men, didn\u2019t have American citizenship. The regulation at that time was\nthat anybody who immigrate to United States, who comes 1n, and is of draft age, will\nserve in the army first. This for all the people who signed papers that they come for\npermanent residence to United States -- not if you\u2019re visiting here, you -- and you\u2019ve\ngiven up your citizenship. I never reclaimed my German citizenship, which I could have.\nI can go today the German embassy and say, \u201cUnder Hitler I was deprived of a German\ncitizenship, I want it back.\u201d I could have it. I know somebody that did that here. I have no\ninterest in that. They can keep their citizenship after all that. So -- so we were held in\nMarmuk, Germany, we came in Bremerhaven port, then went by train to Marmuk,\nGermany. It\u2019s an old German castle. There were no fences or anything again. Not as a\nprisoner, but just a place to live. And they told us they have to investigate each one of us,\nand clear us to go to our new assignment.",
        "A: This was in 1948. I didn\u2019t think, frankly, that six -- seven months, or eight months\nafter immigrate to United States, I would be back where I came from. Never in my\n63\nwildest dreams I would have thought -- 1t wouldn\u2019t have happened if I would have gone\nto Alaska, and I thought I\u2019d go to Alaska, or go the Far East or something. But -- so I\nopened my mouth, and I learned my first lesson, you want to get something done, don\u2019t\ncomplain about it, go and talk to the right people. Maybe you\u2019ll get a no, like people are\nre-religious, who think about praying to God, to give them this or that, or -- and then it\ndoesn\u2019t happen. Or like a rabbi once said, here in the military, \u201cWell, God is hearing you,\nbut he just said no.\u201d Well, that\u2019s the way I felt about some of these things, so they say no,\nsay no, but at least I try. I don\u2019t know if you see that little saying on the wall, I\u2019ve had for\n25 years. Failures [indecipherable] people are failures. Failures are people who thi -- who\nthought -- I\u2019m n -- y -- all mixed up now -- who thought and never did. Number\n[indecipherable] plan yama, but if you don\u2019t do anything, you know, nothing\u2019s going to\nhappen, or you complain about somebody if you don\u2019t complain about -- you go into a\nstore, and you have something to complain about the merchandise, or the sales lady, well\ndon\u2019t talk to her, talk to her supervisor, or to the manager of the place. Get something\ncorrected. So my saying is failures are divided into two classes, those who did and never\nthought, and those who thought and never did. You thinking about a plan of something\n[indecipherable] or you do it, otherwise you might as well be talking to the wall. And also\n[indecipherable] you doing something, to think about it first. I have buil -- built many\nthings which I thought were -- help m -- help me in my sickness, or whatever, and to -- in\norder to get my shoes on better. It\u2019s harder to get myself dressed, and I\u2019ve become very\ninventive. The moment I think about something, I start doing it already. But a lot of\n64\nthings I\u2019ve done, just sitting in a corner, they\u2019re useless. But I did them, so 1t was fun\ndoing them, and the idea to do this, and I pass on the ideas to other people, who were able\nto help themselves [indecipherable]. So -- and finally -- 1t was about 10 days later, after\nsitting in [indecipherable], only two people were released to go to their destination,\nmyself and another guy. And all the Poles were kept, because they were pretty sure, they\njust didn\u2019t know who, that there were spies being infiltrated into the U.S. army in Europe.\nOkay, that was the start of the Cold War, let\u2019s say, and -- but it was true, there were\npeople who were being infiltrated. It was a good chance for them to do that. And to --\nthere was specifically a case -- not one case, 5,000 people, they called it the Lodge act.\nLodge was a senator, and he had a law passed that said there are many people in Europe,\nor in Germany, particularly, who came originally from East Bloc countries, from Poland\nand Russia maybe, Czechoslovakia, who cannot go back, because they are not\nCommunists, or for other reasons, whatever. Some unfortunately, because they\u2019re war\ncriminals. And he said, \u201cWe have to do something, we employing these people.\u201d The\nU.S. army was employing them as auxiliary guards. They had the regular uniform that\nGls wore, but it was dyed black. No insignia. And they wore rifle at night, and they stood\nguard around these places, where there were American soldiers housed. And these\npeople, probably some of them were on the Nazi side [indecipherable] because they lost\nthe war, not on the American side. But the Lodge act said we give them a chance for new\nfuture, and they don\u2019t have any dependents, they must be unmarried. We accept 5,000 of\nthese people, who are already working for us, in the --\n65\nEnd of Tape Three, Side A\nBeginning Tape Three, Side B",
        "A: -- he was a army Intelligence school at Owamagow, Germany. That\u2019s where they have\nthe Passion play, you may have heard about that. And the school had two courses, and I\nwas picked for the criminal investigator\u2019s course. What is this, being a de-de-detective in\nthe army. Which is nice, because you don\u2019t have to wear a uniform, you go out in civilian\nclothes. So you\u2019re a soldier, I fig-figure for tho -- for two years, and you have a ID that\nyou are a -- a detective, or a criminal investigator in this case [indecipherable], and you\nhave many privileges, including most of the officer\u2019s normally have. Here I was only a\nprivate, or a corporal, and I applied for it, and the captain called me 1n, and he said,\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t think you are qualified.\u201d I said, \u201cWhy not, sir?\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re too short.\u201d I said,\n\u201cCaptain, have you ever heard of exceptions?\u201d I thought he was a guy who would cat --\nnot ask please do this, or do that, or -- I -- I was showing him that I knew what was on.\nHe said, \u201cYeah, well wh-what do -- exception would you have?\u201d \u201cAn exception for\nheight.\u201d I know that the minimum 1s five foot in 0 -- in -- in officer\u2019s school the same\nthing, but they give a -- a exception. He said, \u201cAnd your English is not that good.\u201d I said,\n\u201cThat\u2019s true, but I can learn very fast.\u201d And [indecipherable] he didn\u2019t want to let me go\nto school. So at that time, I had this civilian friend, a lady, who was a girlfriend of a\ncolonel, who was higher than the captain, she told him my story, and that the captain had\nrefused let me go to school. And this girl called this captain and said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you let\nWillner go to school?\u201d He had some stupid reasons. He himself was a stupid man, and so\n66\nthe colonel said, \u201cWell I -- I think he 1s very capable, and I think you should consider\nhim.\u201d He couldn\u2019t tell him what to do, but captains don\u2019t fool around with colonels. And\nso next thing I know was an orders to come investigator\u2019s school. Very interesting, in the\nmountains, beautiful, and I became a criminal investigator and they teach you all the\nthings a detective learns. But you deal only with army members, or air force, or navy.\nAnd -- so when I finished that, I was assigned to Heidelberg, which is the headquarters\nfor yu -- all U.S. forces in Europe. And in Heidelberg -- it -- it\u2019s the headquarters where\nthere\u2019s staff officers. Well I wasn\u2019t going to be a staff officer, because first of all I wasn\u2019t\nan officer. Number two, that\u2019s -- you have to know good knowledge of the English\nlanguage, you had to write reports, staff studies, that wasn\u2019t for me, I knew that. So I\ndidn\u2019t turn out -- I\u2019m going to the right school, and -- well, in Heidelberg. Our captain,\nthe commander, was a Jewish guy by the name of Marcus. He was a lawyer in civilian\nlife, and he was being -- he had been drafted for the army, and he became the commander\nof the investigation unit. So he was very good. And -- and then he ha -- assigned me to an\nen -- to a guy who also was Jewish, who had been a police force in Philadelphia. And he\nwas a champion boxer there. Big guy name of Goldstein. And they assigned me to him as\nhis partner. Now in police work you usually will partnership with a policeman that\u2019s\nalready well into it, and Goldstein was not only former policeman, he was big, strong, a\nbully of a guy, who if you -- he talked to you, pay -- you pay attention. He was a nice\nperson, too. He had himself been a captain, but he was demoted to captain after World\nWar two, because they made many people officers, and after World War two --\n67",
        "A: -- it was common that a lot of officers, who made more money being officers in the\narmy than civilian life, wanted to stay in the army as a career, but they couldn\u2019t use\neverybody on staff, there was too many people. They were losing the forces, and he was\nrift. And then they had a deal, when people were rift, could re-enlist in the army, but not\nas officers, as master sergeant. That\u2019s a ter-ter-terrible come-down. You -- that\u2019s not a\nproper thing to do in proper management in my opinion, to have people moted up, and\nthen they go down again. But again, that was our system, and when I knew him was a\ncaptain, and I was a corporal, so Captain Marcus said, \u201cYou go as -- w -- Goldstein.\u201d And\nit turned out to be terrific experience, he turned out to be a terrific guy. He was very good\ninvestigator, he was very good with criminals. Good interrogator. I really learned a lot.\nAs a matter of fact, he was very courageous guy, and he treated me like -- he taught me\nthing, and I was very grateful for that. And th -- and then he got into trouble. He was\nhonest, but he had an affair with a German professor\u2019s wife. [indecipherable] been\ninvited the house -- and the German professor was not a Nazi or nothing, nothing to do\nwith, strictly -- so Goldstein did that, and then she was going to divorce him, and marry\nGoldstein. And she did, finally. I saw them one time in the States. Okay, those things\nhappened there, but -- okay, I working with Goldstein, and -- interesting cases. And -- for\ninstance, a guy [indecipherable] from Heidelberg all of a sudden, came like -- w -- from\nParis came a request, they want Heidelberg to send an investigator to Paris that spoke\nboth German and French. German, because he had to operate in a French zone in\n68\nGermany, and the American zone, you had to know German. Not all investigators spoke\nfour language. There was one thing, and the second thing was that he -- yeah, that he\nspoke French also fluently, and work with the French police in the past. I thought that\nwas great. So I went to Paris. I bought my first car, I bought a surplus Jeep from the\narmy. One thing, but I didn\u2019t have any money. 400 bucks that I pay for that thing. Lot of\nmoney in those days. And I put my dog in it -- I always had German Shepherd -- and\nbaggage, and I came to the French border, and the Frenchman said, \u201cWhat -- what do you\nhave in there?\u201d Gasoline, I had four extra cans of gas, because gasoline was expensive 1n\nthose days. You had to buy German, but we were entitled to American gas\n[indecipherable], and I had four jerry cans full. And the French customs officer, \u201c\u201cWhat\u2019s\nin there?\u201d He knew what was in there, gas. \u201cYou cannot import any gas to France.\u201d I\nsaid, \u201cIt\u2019s my gas, not for sale, and selling on black market. I have to report to Paris, and I\njust bought this Jeep, and I was told that it was difficult to get gas, and also more\nexpensive. So I took four [indecipherable].\u2019\u201d\u2019 You know, you cannot take\n[indecipherable].\u201d That was just plain harassment. They were jealous. Then I said, \u201cWill\nyou give me a statement that you don\u2019t let military allies -- that you won\u2019t let me cross\nthe border with four cans of gas? What big deal is this, four cans of gas?\u201d\n[indecipherable]. He said yeah. Also, they -- he wanted me to leave it there for him to sell\nBlack Market, they were [indecipherable]. So I -- I got upset, and I drove my car to a\nditch. He said, \u201cWhat are you driving it there for?\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019m making phone call,\ntelephone there.\u201d But I went to the ditch, I took my four cans of gas, and I poured them\n69\ninto the ditch. I filled my gas tank first, one more time. And the French came up, \u201cAh, if\nsomebody throws a -- throw the match down there, and going to be fire,\u201d and all this. But\nI was really upset, and th -- this guy, he got upset. That\u2019s what I wanted. I wasn\u2019t going to\nleave those four cans there. I made it to Paris, but I might as well not have made it. 20\nmiles out of Paris, I was looking at my gauge, and was at the end [indecipherable], if\nworse comes to worse, I would have gotten the French gas, but my car start to be on fire.\nI don\u2019t know, I\u2019m not a mechanic, I don\u2019t know anything. I\u2019m not interested in\nmechanics. I -- I -- I know my car\u2019s out of gas, or little -- couple little things. My wife the\nsame way, my old son the same way, and he should know about mechanics in helicopters.\nWell, it started burning, and I thought I had a fire extinguisher, couldn\u2019t find it. I said,\n\u201cLet the he -- damn thing burn, I want to get to Paris.\u201d 40 more miles I hitchhiked, but I\nfigured, with the dog, it\u2019s going to be difficult, German Shepherd. But I get picked up,\nand some drove me into Paris. Not only drove me to Paris, but drove me to the place I\nwas supposed to go. So okay, that\u2019s that. In Paris I had my greatest time. I figured I can\npick up on my education, and the army is going to pay for it. They encouraged that, they -\n- and the GI bill, and I was assigned to the French FBI [indecipherable]. They had several\n[indecipherable], and I wound up with a very nice inspector, who taught me all\n[indecipherable] thing. Basically, the job was, if an American did something wrong in\nParis, the French arrested him, and then they didn\u2019t know what to do with him. They\nturned him over to the Americans. So they decided to have somebody permanently up\nthere -- not always, call somebody someplace. And got the job, and I -- they paid for a\n70\nroom, the army paid for nice hotel room in a [indecipherable] from the Arc of Triumph,\nand the owner of the hotel -- hotel, liked my dog. I was all fixed up. So I lived in there for\n-- short of a year, and I had interesting experience, I was -- I\u2019Il just mention one, or two.\nA -- they had phony money circulating then. This -- these were not phony dollars, but the\noccupation money, they call it scrip. Scrip was money that the Black Market was done\nwith. You would go in the PX, and buy things with it [indecipherable].And\n[indecipherable]",
        "A: My job [indecipherable]. As a criminal investigator, criminal investigations within the\narmy. Somebody murdered somebody in the army, and somebody stole, raided the supply\nroom, sold on the Black Market. Some people got involved in drugs, phony money being\nprinted by the French in southern France. Everything, like -- yeah. And I -- even\nincluding homosexual, which was not normal that time. My boss asked me one time if I\nhad been in England. I said no. \u201cWant to take a quick trip to England, just across\nchannel?\u201d \u201cYeah, what is it?\u201d \u201cWell, we have a guy, the English arrested a guy, a Black\nman, who is a homosexual.\u201d And the English [indecipherable] people know about the\nEnglish. At one time Britain was known for homosexuality. The men -- n-nice people,\nwell-known people. And he said, \u201cWell, the guy is a homosexual. He is not dangerous, he\nis not commit any other crimes, but [indecipherable] been arrested, he can\u2019t turn loose\nagain, he must be escorted back to his base.\u201d I said, \u201cDo I have to wear a weapon?\u201d I\n71\nfigured I might fall asleep, it might grab my weapon. He said, \u201cThat\u2019s required of you,\nbut you wear it underneath your jacket, concealed.\u201d I said, \u201cOkay.\u201d I went to London, and\npicked up the guy, and he was a Black sergeant and he -- very intelligent. He was\nobviously homosexual, but that was not -- not my problem, and he -- I got curious, the\nguy was intelligent, talkative. I never handled a homosexual. I had one as a friend one\ntime, and -- in the army. I di -- I di -- know he was homosexual. It didn\u2019t bother me, but -\n- but some people criticized me for it. I figure what I can do ma -- in my own bedroom,\nnobody\u2019s business. I ran away and I [indecipherable] good. I had a interview with the\nCIA when I retired from the army, and the CIA questions you, and puts you on a lie\ndetector, polygraph test. I answered everything truthfully, til they got to my sex life. And\nthe guy on the polygraph said, \u201cYou went out a lot?\u201d \u201cYeah.\u201d This nothing held against\nyou. They rather have somebody that he\u2019s been around, knows what\u2019s going on than\nsomebody who ts shy, and timid, you know? But some -- they had to ask [indecipherable]\nquestion. So, I was sitting across this guy on a train coming back from London, and,\n\u201cExcuse me, I -- you seem to be a pretty nice guy, and -- and in some places it\u2019s not\nconsidered a crime, but I\u2019m new in this. Can you tell me please, 1f you want to talk, why\nare you a homosexual? You look nice, and --,\u201d He said, \u201cWell sir, we walked here and\nyou see a good looking woman come out in the street, you -- make you excited, you may\nget -- you -- you look, and that\u2019s basically the same thing when I see a man.\u201d That\u2019s a --\nthat\u2019s all he said. A nice guy, I didn\u2019t think [indecipherable]\n72",
        "A: I didn\u2019t arrest him, I escorted him. I\u2019m ne -- my -- my arrests were in different\n[indecipherable] Nazis, which we were not supposed to arrest, but I did [indecipherable]\npeople [indecipherable].",
        "A: They ask me, \u201cHow\u2019s your sex life with your wife?\u201d See, it was okay if you said,\n\u201cWell, I fool around, I have lot of girlfriend.\u201d They think you\u2019re normal, but with a guy it\nwas [indecipherable]. I said to him, \u201cWell, I tell you, I -- Is -- talk about everything, my\nlife is an open book. To my wife, too. But it\u2019s not just one of your damn business what\ngoes on in my -- my se -- sex life with my wife. If you ask me about a girlfriend, or\nsomebody else, I could possibly answer. But not about my wife. It\u2019s none of your\nbusiness whether it\u2019s good or bad.\u201d And I got up. Oh no, he s -- he said, \u201cThis -- this --\nthis concludes the interview.\u201d Fine [indecipherable], but they -- they come out with some\nother thing, asking -- they -- they particularly interested in -- you recording this? You\nare?",
        "A: Mm-hm.\n73\nThey think the Mossad is everywhere. And they are very active. I have never been\napproached, but I have been five time in Israel.

And somewhere I might have told some of my bosses the\nincident that going to Israel with a guy who [indecipherable], and they thought, well, this\nguy\u2019s Okay, but -- but nevertheless, I\u2019m sure there\u2019s some who -- who think Jews have\ndouble s -- citizenship, and some of them do, some of the non-Jews do. I met -- I met a\nDanish businessman in Germany. He showed me two pass -- the American passport, the\nDanish passport. He was not Jewish, but --",
        "A: The -- Israel [indecipherable] somewhere.

I didn\u2019t make too much money in\nthe beginning, and when he asked me to come, I -- he gave me -- it was my uncle, he was\na pu -- he was very -- he was in east -- stayed in Germany, my mother\u2019s brother. He was\ndecorated during World War one, he\u2019s the one with the saber story I told. And he wanted\nto fight the Germans, because his mother got arrested and sent to Theresienstadt. So the\nPalestin -- the Israelis didn\u2019t take him, he was too old. He had been a bachelor all his life.\nHe was a playboy, as a matter of fact, but nice guy. He was my favorite uncle.

And she\n74\nwant to marry him. She was 20 years older than he was. And I have picture of her sitting\non his lap when she was 20, he was 40, at a party. Well, he never married her, he went to\nIsrael, because his first girlfriend, who was a nurse, who enlists in the army when he\nenlist in the army, and they -- and he was sent to Queest, to what\u2019s that? A ci -- the island\nCyprus.",
        "A: The Germans want to attack there, want to take Greece, and he was in British uniform,\nhe was still a German citizen. That\u2019s excuse for [indecipherable] but he, you know,\n[indecipherable] uniform. But he didn\u2019t care, so the British said, \u201cWell, since you speak\nGerman fluently, we have a special job for you. We [indecipherable] landing\n[indecipherable] keep the Germans out [indecipherable] go on to Italy.\u201d And he said,\n\u201cWhat do you want me to do?\u201d \u201cWe want you to parachute at night, in the\n[indecipherable].\u201d\u201d He had never jumped by para -- he was 50 years o -- oh, they didn\u2019t\ntake him to the army [indecipherable] were 50, I think. 50 is nothing [indecipherable] the\narmy.

So he had all these men, sent to German prison camp, including\n75\nmy uncle, and he -- this -- the -- the German commander under him, Wehrmacht\ncommander, the army commander, not -- not a [indecipherable] person, knew that his\nhouse was already full of people [indecipherable] anyway. He didn\u2019t -- well, he got them\nin there, and the -- the commander was a [indecipherable] officer, and when he got to my\nuncle, he ask him, \u201cYou ever serve in German army?\u201d What he going to answer?\n[indecipherable] he couldn\u2019t prove it, you know. [indecipherable]. He wanted to show he\nfought in the German army, and the British army, he was traitor. He [indecipherable]\nsome o -- someone -- he tried to find out who the Jews were, and I think he was given an\norder, he didn\u2019t do this on his own, he was given an order to do that. So he said, \u201cAll\nJews step one step forward.\u201d They were all line up, and nobody step forward. He said\nlouder, \u201cAll Jews step one step forward.\u201d I don\u2019t know how many men there, I forgot. I\nknow it was something like a couple hundred.

He said he cannot stay in this prison camp, he is a Jew, and he is a danger\nto this country. They send him to another camp, the people were punished\n[indecipherable] and he -- he --\n76\nwe should just get back to the chronology, and you were talking about being in Paris, and\nyou had left Paris.",
        "A: Paris [indecipherable] the only interesting thing I did in Paris, was when there was\ninformation on being phony American dollars printed in Marseilles. And the French\nknew all about it, and they were appearing in Germany, that\u2019s where they used that phony\n-- that scrip money, and there was a lot of Black Market going on. So the French said\nthey found the printing press in Marseilles. They asked me want to go along for the ride,\nnot to do anything. Take my gun with me, but not to do anything [indecipherable]. Went\ndown there -- and I was afraid of the French, because they always had [indecipherable]\nfor money, just like here. Like giving the whole thing away, and selling it\n[indecipherable] on the way down, and [indecipherable]. So I was very careful. We came\ndown and they didn\u2019t know about it, you know? And police covered all the exits, and told\nthem to wait, and they called [indecipherable] pretty soon it got pretty interesting. I\nmyself had a small experience with phony money, because of my language background.\nAnd phony money was the thing at the time, that had a value, you guy in the PX for it.\nPX has everything. And in Heidelberg there was a [indecipherable] there\u2019s some guy who\nsells phony dollars, the occupation dollars. And my boss, \u201cWell Willner, you go find out,\nby yourself, otherwise two come, they think [indecipherable]. Go by yourself.\u201d I figured,\nwell, phony money cannot very dangerous. The guy has a gun, he probably is out there --\nwhat they call the -- what did they call Eichmann, they -- shripeshoop. They gave a\nnickname, shripeshruf merror. The mer -- office [indecipherable] all that stuff, killing\n77\npeople, went out on paper wi -- 1n his office. He didn\u2019t work there in the country, he\nvisits it.\nEnd of Tape Three, Side B\n78\nBeginning Tape Four, Side A",
        "A: [indecipherable |",
        "A: Was -- the reason why I was successful, and it\u2019s amazing.",
        "A: [indecipherable] before you have a -- the boss told me there\u2019s a guy who was a\ndistributor, like people do cocaine, or -- but phony money.",
        "A: And I thought we were going to do like in France, [indecipherable] big. He was\ncarrying the money around, selling the people for German marks. I wanted six people to\nsupport me, because you never know what\u2019s behind it, and what members when they go -\n- be by -- by myself, because y -- they never suspect you, you\u2019re short, nobody thinks\nyou\u2019re with the police. \u201cYeah,\u201d I said, \u201cbut who is there to help me if -- to\n[indecipherable] over there?\u201d \u201cI\u2019Il have some people sent in by [indecipherable].\u201d I go in\nthis place in Germany, in a coffee house, meet the guy, and I [indecipherable], \u201cDo you\nhave the money?\u201d \u201cYup.\u201d \u201cCan I see a sample of it?\u201d He said, \u201cWhat do you want it for?\u201d\nI said, \u201cWell, I\u2019m immigrating to the United States pretty soon, I earn a lot of -- more\nGerman marks on the Black Market, I want to convert it into money.\u201d [indecipherable]\nthen have to get green dollars for it. He looked at me, \u201cWhere you from?\u201d I made a lie.\n79\n\u2018Are you Jewish?\u201d That was just how -- he thought I was a Jew who was immigrating\n[indecipherable]. I said, \u201cNo, I think -- but I still [indecipherable] some money. Aren\u2019t\nyou -- are you seller, or aren\u2019t you?\u201d I said and the phony money, all this was being\nrecorded on me, and I had a [indecipherable] turned out to be outside in case anything\nhappens, and more than one guy there that I could sound the alarm. So, I mean, I\n[indecipherable] sat there at the table. I said, \u201cCan you show me a sample?\u201d I said, \u201cWhat\nfor?\u201d No, he said, \u201cWhat for?\u201d I said, \u201cI want to know -- I\u2019m not buying this for myself,\nI\u2019m buying this for a friend of mine, but he is in a position, he cannot be seen.\u201d Okay.\n\u201cTindecipherable| show me a sample.\u201d But the money he wanted for it was quite high,\nand I think if it\u2019s high, he has probably good production, that will pass for -- for real.\nThen may a problem, and this doesn\u2019t look good, it\u2019s no problem. So, he takes out a bill\nunder the table, he hands it to me under the table, and he says, \u201cThat\u2019s a risky business. I\nhope nobody\u2019s watching us.\u201d And the police all over, he just sat there. \u201cYeah,\u201d I said,\n\u201cprobably, but why here [indecipherable]? Nobody following me, you know.\u201d Okay, him\n-- we made a deal, he gave me bag of money, I paid him, and the moment the translation -\n- the transaction was completed -- completed, he said -- I say, \u201cYou\u2019re under arrest,\u201d in\nGerman. But I had no right to. I was a German under the -- in the company of a German\npoliceman. Well, we just didn\u2019t have one at that, and the moment I said that, he looked at\nthe rear door, he looked there, he was going to escape it, but I had his money, and I said,\n\u201ctindecipherable], if you think of getting out of here without getting caught, you\u2019re\nmistaken. I have a military police company outside, of over a hundred men.\u201d It wasn\u2019t\n80\ntrue at all. And he said to me that he\u2019s stupid, and that -- that I have to understand they\nhave to do this to make the money, well, other people [indecipherable] making money\nnow. But then I came out, he esc-escorted me out -- I never even called the guys in. I\nwalked out the front door with him, and took big MP\u2019s kind of by the arm, and put him in\njail. So that was my [indecipherable]. Then I go in from Heidelberg, to Paris already\n[indecipherable] that too? And [indecipherable] Paris -- Liege, Belgium. Liege is a pretty\nbig town, for Belgium it\u2019s warm. And I lived there before in Brussels, 1f you remember?\nSo I was very happy to get to Belgium.",
        "A: [indecipherable] I -- I told you about that, and when the [indecipherable] the manager.\nDidn\u2019t I tell you that?",
        "A: Okay, I -- I -- I'll weave that in here. I had been in Belgium before, and I enjoyed my\nassignment there. Then one day my job was changed. Instead of doing criminal\ninvestigation, I was going to do congressional investigation from our [indecipherable]\nhere. And they needed qualified or -- investigators for that, partially speaking the\nlanguage. What happened, congressional investigations in washing, if you had a son who\nwas the army during the invasion of France, or in Germany, and he was found missing in\naction -- there were many of them, thousands, but they had also quite a few hundred who\ndeserted, who didn\u2019t want to fight, and who got married to other women, local women.\n81\nHad already wife in the United States, maybe children. And the last that we knew of\nthem, he never showed up, he disappeared from his unit. So, a guy didn\u2019t show up in his\nunit, that could happen he got lost, or had a girl from someplace, then he was AWOL.\nAWOL is absent without leave. He would get some small punishment for that, but they\ncannot give you more than 30 days in jail, unless the guy stays a-away, excuse me, a year\nor something, then it\u2019s desertion, it becomes automatically desertion. So, congressional\ninvestigation demanded the parents, let\u2019s say, had the son missing in France, he was\nnever found. We have cemeteries over there, and usually people got buried in our\nAmerican cemeteries. We do not have cemeteries in Germany. It\u2019s not a fact well known,\nbecause our law says we will not bury American soldiers in enemy territory if they get\nkilled there. So if they got killed in Germany, they had to transport it back to France, or --\nor Holland, or Belgium. Okay, so this congressional investigations were usually initiated\nby parents, who went to their congressman, say, \u201cHey, do something about it. We want to\nget our son home in a casket [indecipherable] buried -- or even buried over there, but w --\nwhat -- know what happened to him.\u201d So you could get people buried, not in Germany,\nbut in France, Belgium. So whatever the family decided. I had the -- this cousin, who\nbefore the war, came to United States, he got killed in France, has a grave there in a\nmilitary cem -- an American military cemetery, and I visit his grave, send the picture to\nhis parents. They were originally from Germany. And then they ask me that the\ngovernment told us we can have his body brought back here, buried a local cemetery, or\nhave it -- him stay in a French cemetery. I said, \u201cLeave him there. He\u2019s dead. I know y --\n82\nhow you feel about him, but if you bring him here, what have you accomplished? You go\nmore often to the cemetery, you feel worse. Sometimes gotta finish -- the war is finished,\nyou can\u2019t go on and on with these things.\u201d And -- he was the only son. I said, \u201cYou had\nto -- you paid a high price for escaping Germany, came to United States, but that\u2019s the\nway it goes.\u201d If I had to make a choice, my family [indecipherable] 10 members of the\nfamily, and what I\u2019m po -- proposing 1s that we do a certain thing, but 10 -- out of 10,\neight are -- eight [indecipherable] took them all alive. I know this in advance, you may\nstill do it, or you may not do anything at all, because you\u2019re a coward, or you say this\nwon\u2019t work, or -- anyway, So in the -- in these congressional investigations, like I said, I -\n- we had to go further than the cemetery, the cemetery was only the last instance\n[indecipherable], or in the United States. And the deal was -- my job was to find out from\nlocal people, if there was an American, or more, killed in that area. They usually knew\nbecause the German shot him there, they were not going to bury him. And then the\nFrench fo -- found him, and they make a local grave out of it, right in the cemetery, bury\nhim. So I said to this guy, \u201cDo you have any unmarked graves here, where you don\u2019t\nknow whether they are Americans or German?\u201d He said yes, and that\u2019s the way we\nusually worked it. If they said yes, if they were sometimes a mound, not totally un-\nunderground, they would say, \u201cThere a hundred soldiers buried here,\u201d or, \u201c\u201cThere a\nhundred French soldiers buried here, a hundred American buried here.\u201d Or German\ntroops with Americans. We went to the extreme, our country, to -- which I -- I think is --\nwas right, even this point. These guys, they died for their country, and they have a right\n83\nto be properly take care of. So -- and finally -- so what I finally [indecipherable] hundred\nguys that the farmer told me, \u201cI don\u2019t know, we -- we just picked up these guys after the\nbattle was over, and they were dead, and we threw them all in a hole, covered up.\u201d I said,\n\u201cAre they Germans, or Americans?\u201d He said, \u201cI think they\u2019re mixed, they\n[indecipherable]. Sometime that is only German. I said, \u201cOkay, we got to open this\ngrave up.\u201d That wasn\u2019t my job. They had what they call graves registration teams. They\nwere Americans, comprised of guys, and linguists, and dentists sometimes with dental\ncharts, and what was the other thing? Well, may -- they -- if I thought, or somebody else\nthought, among those hundred Germans, may be two Americans we\u2019re looking for, they\ndecided to dig them all up, and sometimes that the uniforms, they were a mess. But\nfortunately, I didn\u2019t have anything to do with that, I just had to investigation, and -- and\nthen report, and then they took action on what to do about it. So I had this place with\nabout a hundred Germans, and I said to this farmer, \u201cAre you sure they\u2019re no\nAmericans?\u201d Because I got after action reports from the army, before I [indecipherable].\nThey said the 75\" infantry company went through there, through the area, and I had a\nmap -- had their all map f -- when they went to the war, and they send out two scouts, to\nfind out where the Germans [indecipherable], and those two scouts never came back. I\nhave reason to assume they got killed, if they were taken prisoner, and they could have\n[indecipherable] as prisoners, but prisoners we usually found alive. So, here already\nhundred or so Germans, and they decided to dig up. When I said I come back in two or\nthree days, when you should be finished, and then -- and they had not archaeologists, but\n84\nthey had dentists sometime, and [indecipherable] soldiers. And they couldn\u2019t, they were\nbloody and rotten already. But the teeth, you could tell. And the other thing was dogtags.\nHad the dogtags, you have two of them, and take one off and take it with you, to report\nthat this man was killed.",
        "A: [indecipherable] yeah, probably.",
        "A: Except -- except for the ardents. The ardents offensive -- where I worked my way\nthrough [indecipherable] there was the ardents, or the -- they have another name, too. The\nHertkin Forest battle. Hertkin forest was very tall trees, and the artillery shells\n[indecipherable] up the top, there was bird and [indecipherable]. And many people got\nkilled by shellbursts from the top, the Germans were shooting not to the bottom, but to\nthe top, because the top created a lot of splinters, and whatnot, and -- and -- and then\nspread out to the [indecipherable] underground [indecipherable]. But in this hundred men\ngrave, I came back a few days, and they -- we -- they told me, \u201cWe didn\u2019t find what you\nasked for, but we found something else interesting.\u201d Not the guy -- the guys were looking\nfor. And they came with a box, and in that box was half a leg, and in that half a leg was a\npair of boots, American boots. So right away I knew these were American\u2019s feet, I didn\u2019t\nhave to look at a dogtags, I think. And so I said to guy, \u201cWell, put this in the box,\u201d clean\nit up, took some of the dirt off. And then I said, \u201cOpen up the boots.\u201d So he opens the\n85\nboots, we gi -- at the time we had boots, they were not boots total, they -- on the side we\nhad two closures, you tied them up[indecipherable]. So, opened it up, and I find the guy\u2019s\nname in there. He turn -- didn\u2019t turn out to be the two guys I was looking for, but another\nguy who was also missing 1n action -- I thou -- I thought was missing in action. So\napparently, during the fights there, he had his leg shot off, and I said, \u201cWell, his body\nmust be nearby or something.\u201d And I said to the guys, \u201cYou want to dig a little further\n[indecipherable]?\u201d And they didn\u2019t feel like it, I didn\u2019t feel like it. I said, \u201cOkay.\u201d I know\nwe don\u2019t tell the congressional investigator that we found a leg, that there was the rest of\nthe body [indecipherable] whole thing. I said, \u201cBut they will be convinced that he is\nkilled, maybe.\u201d I -- you see, I was not in favor in spending so much -- too many dollars\nwith digging up people [indecipherable] rested in peace. And we sent that box back to the\nStates by air. Five days later I get a call. Wh -- some colonel on the phone. \u201cWhat are you\ndoing out there, Willner? You having a lot of fun?\u201d I didn\u2019t know what he was talking\nabout. He said, \u201cOr you have nothing to do, you do things like you do?\u201d I said,\n\u201cColonel,\u201d I said, \u201ctell -- I -- I don\u2019t know what you\u2019 re talking about.\u201d \u201cWell, you send us\nback a leg.\u201d These were the people that they -- they have [indecipherable] like a morgue,\nthey process dead bodies, clean them up, put them in nice box, very fancy. And so he\nsaid, \u201cThe leg you dug up, you want to talk to the guy?\u201d",
        "A: Yeah. The leg had been shot off, and the guy was alive in United States.\n[indecipherable] his serial number, and they found him, and then they went to the\n86\nPentagon, and said serial number such and such, he wasn\u2019t killed, he -- he\u2019s right here. So\nI was, you say the butt of joke or something, for a long time down there, I am digging up\nlegs, and finding guys that alive.",
        "A: World War two, on the Belgian -- Belgian, French and German border, generally. And",
        "A: [had a great time, I found my personal -- a lot of satisfaction, being successful, had a\nfree hand, my boss was so good that I went out in faraway places, and the weekends were\ncoming up, I would have liked to be home, but I liked to see other places, too. Had a Jeep\navailable, and a driver. Normally a team consists of three people, one officer, one\nsergeant or corporal, and one dri -- drivers were these Polish guys who went\n[indecipherable] United States, they employ them as guard, or driver. So I -- I was\noperating [indecipherable] also very independent, and the boss we had, he kept the\n[indecipherable]. He said that I was doing a great job, and normally he said, \u201cThere\u2019s an\nofficer, but I cannot promote you to become an officer, you got to go to school, and -- but\nPll give you another promotion.\u201d Got another stripe, and on -- once a year you have an\ninspection of people who don\u2019t normally wear a uniform, who -- who work in special\nunits, and my boss came around for some general took once a year look at you. And we\nhad to have all our uniforms in a closet, neat, pressed, insignia and all that. And it had to\n87\nbe open, not locked. And we went about our jobs while these guys were looking our stuff.\nAnd I had my hung up properly, and everything cleaned, and shoes shined, you play\nsoldier again. And then captain -- that evening, Captain Marcus called me in. He said,\n\u201cWillner, apparently the general knows you, he heard of you. You do [indecipherable]\nsharp here, but you got one problem. The question was why you not an officer.\u201d I told\nhim same story, you have to be a citizen first, and you cannot become commander of\nAmerican troops if you\u2019re not a citizen, only if you\u2019re doctor, a chaplain, or -- you can\u2019t\nbe foreign -- not [indecipherable] foreigner.\u201d So he said, \u201cYeah, but he looked\nparticularly through your stuff, he wanted to see what -- how you keep your stuff. He\n[indecipherable] nothing -- anything about your stuff, but I found you -- you -- he put me\ni-1n a bad shape. I -- he -- the general asked me what grade I have by now, and I told him\nsergeant. And we open up your locker, and you find corporal stripes on there. That\u2019s one\nless stripe [indecipherable] there are three. Why is that?\u201d I said, \u201cCaptain Marcus, I tell\nyou frankly. I feel like a nothing with just two stripes. I -- I -- I decided I\u2019m going to put\nmy stripes on when I have three stripes, to amount to something.\u201d He know -- I was a\ngood [indecipherable] Captain Marcus, I could say that, and he laughed, and, \u201cLook, if\nyou don\u2019t have them on by tomorrow morning, I\u2019m going to take your three stripes away,\nyou -- youll be nothing but a private.\u201d [indecipherable] and what -- then I wrote a letter,\nI think I can get [indecipherable]. I wrote a letter to the general, and I said it\u2019s not normal\nto -- for a sergeant to write to a general, and has permission from his commanding\nofficer, and I do not have permission from my commanding officer, he doesn\u2019t know\n88\nabout it, but I\u2019d like to explain something. And what he -- what I explain 1s maybe not\nacceptable to you either. It was not acceptable to Captain Marcus. I told him that I think\nnot because I earned them, or I\u2019m capable of doing the job, I just thought th-three stripes\nwere better than two stripes, it\u2019s a higher rank. A lot of guys had two stripes, but\n[indecipherable]. And he laughed, he -- okay. Captain Marcus took care of it, have me\nput them on. I know. I had the same thing happen to officer\u2019s school. You get promoted if\nyou're a private or -- or is a [indecipherable]. Okay, my three year -- now comes the\nimportant part. My three year less -- lesson -- enlistment was up. I had learned English\nbetter, I have got myself a high school diploma. The army had arrangements with state of\nNew York board of education, that for military people who needed a high school\ndiploma, they can take courses, or they can take a final examination for high school, and\nthe state of New York will issue a high school diploma, even if you have not graduated\nfrom high school, provided you pass the exam. So I looked at, and asked the guy that was\nin charge of it, looked at this and see if I am -- where I was weak. I always felt weak in --\nin m -- n -- math, or English maybe. I looked at it, it didn\u2019t look that difficult to me. And\nI said, \u201cI'll take the exam without studying, and if I don\u2019t pass, Ill start studying\n[indecipherable].\u201d I took a 10 hour examination, five sections each, and passed with\nflying colors. I was so happy. And that qualified me to take another test to become an\nofficer, because you have to be -- and the other things involved, first of all, because the\nKorean war was going on, they accepted people with less education to get them to\nofficer\u2019s school without a college degree. But you had to have a high school diploma, and\n89\nto be a citizen. So I had the high school diploma, but I didn\u2019t -- I wasn\u2019t a citizen yet.\nAnd with the -- I explain that, an-and in past a system has been developed, it also has to\nhave college education [indecipherable] army. They used to have a time where you can\nget your college education in the army. The University of Maryland, Virginia, they taught\ncourses in the Pentagon, and some other place. And they -- so that\u2019s what -- what was I\ngo -- what I was going to do. But I was up 19 -- three years, and I saved up all my leave\ntime, which was 30 days a year, I never took leave, never went on vacation, and Captain\nMarcus knew this, and he said, \u201cWhen you go to Paris, and you have to stay over the\nweekend, in the arm -- army\u2019s expense, because something ready for you, you are\nspending time working with other soldiers that are taking the weekend off, going\nsomeplace. And I will make a special deal, which I\u2019m also as commanding officer. I\nknow you saving up your leave time for other things more serious. So when you in Paris,\non Saturday, you don\u2019t have to come back, you want to stay there you stay there,\u201d and\nthis is -- I -- he -- he -- commanding officer could give you le -- leave time, three days, no\nmore. It was only three days you had to take [indecipherable] leave, and 1t was just at his\n-- it\u2019s like an award they -- they gave away three day passes to guys who did good jobs,\nwho wanted to see their families. And so I had 90 days, the agreement with\n[indecipherable] was I go back to New York, I go to the -- get my citizenship, and the\nrequirement was that, when you get a citizenship if you\u2019re in the army, it\u2019s three years, if\nyou\u2019re a civilian, five years, unless you\u2019re the wife of a military, and he 1s all -- overseas,\n90\nand he can -- the wife can get it two years, I think, because they prefer to be citizens, to\nprotect the pe -- United States. So --\nEnd of Tape Four, Side A\nBeginning Tape Four, Side B",

And the\npilot\u2019s still sitting in his seat, completely preserved. I\u2019ve seen it. And the reason why\npreco -- preserved, because the ground is different, and it\u2019s calctum, and whatever is in\nthere.

        "A: And it -- it\u2019s exciting when you see a young pilot, and the last place he sits, and he just",
        "A: Okay. I got my nine -- 90 days of leave, was to carry out some personal affairs in New\nYork, maybe get my citizenship, and then re-enlist in the army, if I get to go to officer\u2019s\nschool, because you could not go -- you could pass the examination -- entrance\nexamination, but you could not go to officer\u2019s school unless you went in front of a board,\nand they -- they voted for you. Nine people usually, they ask you questions. And -- but\nlike I said, I needed the citizenship paper. And I figure 90 days enough, because\n[indecipherable] said three years in the army, and what was the other one? No\npunishments, you didn\u2019t go to jail for anything, had a clear record. And three years in ma\n91\n-- and oh yeah, three years, and -- and then you -- you re-enlist, otherwise you leave the\narmy. And then you had to show the high school diploma, and your citizenship papers,\nand then you had to go in front of a board of officers, and this was not my area, New\nYork, this was in Governor\u2019s Island, you know, Governor\u2019s Island, New York.\nGovernor\u2019s Island had at one time military people on there, and offices, there was a\nwhole fort, and that\u2019s where I had to go to get all my administration done. But I didn\u2019t\nhave anybody to help me, I had to carry my [indecipherable]. But my main concern was\nto get to be a citizen so I could go in Governor\u2019s Island in front of the board, and the\nboards are maybe done twice a month, or something like that. And then they give you a\nselected, or not selected. So, I went there the day for two months to the headquarter of the\nimmigration naturalization service in New York, on [indecipherable], and stood in line,\nyou know. And I got very upset. I figure, I\u2019m qualified, I did nothing wrong, and these\npeople are preventing me from doing what I want to do, [indecipherable] me up with\noffice school not in being in time, and the army realized they -- can realize they\n[indecipherable] can -- can do all these things. And already 60 days gone by, and I talked\nto an officer, and he even said [indecipherable] advice, he said, \u201cWillner, go to\nWashington, go to the Pentagon. These are civilians here who -- they\u2019re bureaucratic,\nwell, the military are bureaucratic, but they like to give people the runaround. But if you\nare qualified, really qualified, I don\u2019t see any reason why you shouldn\u2019t go to the\nPentagon, let them help you out. Your people. You [indecipherable].\u201d It\u2019s a funny thing. I\nwalk in the Pentagon, in to the adjutant general\u2019s section, I didn\u2019t know who to see, and I\n92\ntold them I have a serious matter, I\u2019m going to talk somebody high up, [indecipherable]\nsaid that colonel so and so will see you. I walk in there, gave him a sharp salute, and told\nhim my story. I mentioned concentration camps, I mentioned citizenship, and what I\u2019d\ndone in the army so far, and the guy was impressed. And he said to me -- I said -- my\nopinion is they give me the runaround for one reason or another. Well, if you\u2019re qualified,\nyou\u2019re qualified, that\u2019s -- we\u2019ll take you into -- and he grabs the phone, and he mang up\nthe phone, he said, \u201cBy the way, are you a republican or a democrat?\u201d I didn\u2019t know what\nto say, I figure I'll say a democratic, he\u2019s a republican, he\u2019s not going to help me. And I\nwas really a -- up -- I was nervous. I think I have to say something. So the guy said -- I\nsaid, \u201cSir, I\u2019m not even a citizen yet.\u201d Make an excuse. I [indecipherable] \u201cI\u2019m not even a\ncitizen yet, so I can\u2019t vote.\u201d Well, he said, \u201cMake up your mind. Do you want to become\ncitizen? Say you are a citizen, what would you vote, democratic or republican?\u201d Again,\nthis is [indecipherable], I said democrat. He said, \u201c\u201cGood.\u201d He was a democrat. But -- so I\n-- ]-] -- J --",
        "A: I was I-lucky. I was lucky. Now I\u2019m more luck -- even luckier than that. He still had\nthe phone in his hand, dialed a number -- I didn\u2019t know he was going to, and during the ta\n-- and came through, he was talking to Franklin Delano Roosevelt, junior -- junior fo --\nthe son, who was a congressman, and he was a golf partner of him. That\u2019s how the\ncolonel knew Roosevelt. He was a big one, looked like his father. And he said on the\nphone -- called him by his first name, and, \u201cI have a young sergeant in my office, he had\n93\nan interesting story, something for our public information people, maybe.\u201d He said, \u201cNo,\nnever mind public information, I\u2019d like to talk with the guy [1indecipherable].\u201d And the\ncolonel said to me, \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know if you haven\u2019t gotten it by now, but I\u2019ve been\ntalking to Franklin Roosevelt. Not the president,\u201d he was dead already, \u201cbut his son, he\u2019s\na congressman, he may be able to help you.\u201d So I -- I said -- I figured that it\u2019s probably\ntrue, he can help me. And then he asked a few more questions that Franklin wanted\nanswered, and he said, \u201cAsk Sargent Willner he\u2019s free for lunch.\u201d Of course I was free\nfor lunch you know, a guy like him, and have the honor to meet somebody like\n[indecipherable], and somebody who could help me, really. Better than na -- in the army\ncolonel, you know, [indecipherable] general. So he said -- yeah, and the colonel said,\n\u201cT\u2019II,\u201d -- he asked me I had transportation, I said no. \u201cWell, I get a staff car.\u201d So they go\nand get me a staff car, he took me to Roosevelt\u2019s office on the hill, and we greet each\nother, and he said, \u201cI heard you have an interesting story.\u201d I didn\u2019t tell him how I told\nyou, but I told him a little bit. He said, \u201cHow about your family [indecipherable]\u201d.\nNobody survived. \u201cAnd, so what\u2019s your future?\u201d I didn\u2019t want to shoot too high, but I\nsaid [indecipherable]. I said, \u201cI -- you know I\u2019m here because my citizenship. I passed the\nexamination [indecipherable] officer candidate school. I haven\u2019t passed the board yet for\nofficer, because they won\u2019t take me until I\u2019m a citizen, and that\u2019s what -- what the\nproblem is. I\u2019m fully qualified, and you have to be a citizen before they -- the board takes\nyou [indecipherable] become an o -- become an officer.\u201d \u201cOkay,\u201d he said,\n\u201cTindecipherable| make a reservation for two someplace, yeah. I -- I got to call this.\u201d He\n94\ncalled the commissioner of immigration naturalization in New York, he was a retired\ngeneral, forgot his name, but he [indecipherable] him up. And he said to him -- he was\nordering him to, \u201cGeneral,\u201d -- they all [indecipherable] general [indecipherable] retire. \u201cI\nhave a young sergeant here, he has a perfect -- perfect record and everything. He\u2019s a\nrefugee from Germany. I think he\u2019Il be a good officer, I think we need some fresh blood,\nand he\u2019s given the runaround by your people.\u201d And he didn\u2019t talk back, but he wrote\ndown the information, and then he said, \u201cYes, that\u2019s all.\u201d [indecipherable]. \u201cOh, one\nmore thing,\u201d he apparently said he\u2019s going to call the people responsible for this, you\nknow, right away. And Roosevelt said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to wait very long, and Willner\nhasn\u2019t got long, I will see this to the end, before the month is up.\u201d So when I -- he made\nthe reservation, and he called the general in New York, he said, before we left -- I don\u2019t\nknow if it was an hour, 11:30. I know some people take long lunches, but by one o\u2019clock,\nI want an answer from you personally. Call his office what the state of it is. If there\u2019s a\nproblem, no problem, I want everything handled immediately. I could have lied and said\nsomething that -- that they didn\u2019t know. So we went to lunch, we had a good lunch, we\ndidn\u2019t talk about anything bad, he just asked me some questions -- you asked me how --\nhow I felt the United States, and if I knew about his father, and I have a letter hanging,\nfrom him, downstairs, and he asked me about the situation in Germany, what I thought\nabout it. And my knowledge was limited except to what I experienced. He had some\npolitical questions, too. But we had a good conversation, and he said, \u201cWell, the army\u2019s\nnot for everybody, if you do all right, I -- three years won\u2019t do you any harm. But maybe\n95\nyou want to become a politician like me.\u201d And I was going to say, \u201cWell, with a father\nlike yours, that\u2019s easy,\u201d you know, but probably -- only now foreign born people become\npoliticians, too. Hey, there\u2019s a Holocaust survivor, too, but --",
        "A: And [indecipherable] politician [indecipherable]. I don\u2019t know, but we kidded around\na lot, and yeah, oh yeah, yeah, I know what he said, \u201cBut not like my brother.\u201d You know\nhis brother\u2019s story? He had another brother -- he had several brothers, in cali -- in\nCalifornia, James. He [indecipherable] he make me laugh, or something, and he said -- I -\n- | -- I didn\u2019t know. I never heard the name James. But I said -- \u201cOh, oh, you don\u2019t know.\nHe\u2019s running for office again, and he\u2019s quite a ladies man, he\u2019s married. And he just had\na very interesting poster put out about him by the opposition. He -- he had a folder --\nposter they were putting in California on the walls, and it said on there, send Jimmy back\nto Washington. The wife you save may be your own.\u201d You have your -- laugh about his\nbrother, you know, fooling around, and it\u2019s so funny. He was really a -- he was really -- I\ncheck on it later [indecipherable], and he was such a ladies man.",
        "A: And so then we came back from lunch, and the secretary said, \u201cThe gentleman called\nalready. He didn\u2019t want to talk to me, he wanted to talk to you.\u201d Said okay, he take the\nphone. And I\u2019m making this up, I mean, I didn\u2019t hear what he said, but he must have\nasked Roosevelt if I could be next morning in New York. And Roosevelt asked me if I\ncould be there. \u201cSure. I\u2019ll -- Pll get a private plane [indecipherable] but -- but I'll be\n96\nthere.\u201d He said, \u201cYou'll be -- not going -- you\u2019re not going there just to talk to people,\nyou\u2019re going to be sworn in citizen tomorrow morning. So get a clean uniform.\u201d I said I\ndon\u2019t have any [indecipherable]. So -- and you may have to answer some questions there.\nSo I was next morning in New York. They had a special ceremony for me, I was the only\none. I walked in [indecipherable] room, and there\u2019s a woman judge, and she said, \u201cSo\nyou want to become a citizen? You already half a citizen, you are military sergeant, and\nI\u2019m not going to ask you a lot of questions, but just a few.\u201d She want to put me at ease.\nAnd I was worried, I -- I hadn\u2019t studied like my wife did later on, I -- just when I ran into.\nI was too busy, and too nervous. He -- she -- she said, \u201cWho\u2019s Uncle Sam?\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d I\nsaid, \u201che\u2019s the guy I work for.\u201d And then she said, in getting more serious, she said, \u201cIf\nyou\u2019re a citizen, are you willing to pay taxes?\u201d I thought it was a stupid thing, I said,\n\u201cYes, off course.\u201d I said, \u201cNot be willing to pay taxes, I don\u2019t think I can get to see. The\nmilitary take -- takes the taxes out of your pay right away. So -- but I\u2019m willing to pay\ntaxes.\u201d And I don\u2019t remember the third question she asked me. So I was sworn in --",
        "A: Two.",
        "A: And the swearing in ceremony was very nice, but people -- my [indecipherable]",
        "A: After I was sworn in, I had my certificate, I immediately went back to my place, I\npacked, and that -- for New York. And I left [indecipherable]. So when I came to New\n97\nYork, my next move was to get in front of the officer selection board, and I had my\npapers, and I went to Governor\u2019s Island. There was the headquarters of the first U.S.\narmy. And I went in there, and told them what the story was, and they said they have\nselection boards only once or twice a month. I said, \u201cThat might be trouble, so w --\nwhen\u2019s the next selection board meeting?\u201d And he didn\u2019t know. And I was lucky again,\nthere\u2019s meeting next morning, but I was not on the list of people to be interviewed. So\nthey added me to it. And they say this 1s a special, and -- so I came in front of the board,\nthere were nine officers, and there were about 20 or so people to [indecipherable]. So I\ntimed these people, see how long this takes. Five minutes. And I went in there, I was still\ngoing on for half an hour. And I thought -- not like here 1s interesting, or -- I thought I\u2019m\nnot going to make it. They\u2019re asking real hard questions. And nothing against me, they\nwere very nice, but you -- you are nervous when you go. This is my fu-future, and now I\nhave everything, now I got to go to school, and then I worry about getting through\nschool. So, they ask me all kind of questions and I answer. Then this thing was finished, I\nwas the last one, I had to take the ferry back from Ellis Island to New York -- Manhattan.\nI got in a ferry, and one major was on the ferry, and there was an aboard, and he said\nhello [indecipherable] far away. And then I decided I\u2019m going to make a move. I know\nit\u2019s not legal for him to tell me, but I made [indecipherable]. I\u2019ve got to know, I won\u2019t be\nable to sleep. People had told me I will be notified in about a week. And the way this\nthing worked up there, I know they asked me a lot of questions they didn\u2019t ask the other\npeople. They were concerned, I was a foreigner, who was going to be in charge of\n98\nAmerican troops, maybe with a career, and into combat. They wanted someho -- body\nthey can trust, and they -- so when I left, I didn\u2019t know whether am I going to make it or\nnot. So I find this major on the boat, on the ferry. I go over to him, and I say, \u201cExcuse me\nsir, I know it\u2019s illegal, I know you cannot give me the answer, but I\u2019m going to ask you\nanyway, because I\u2019m so damn nervous. I\u2019ve been waiting for this for a long time\n[indecipherable] problems, they all got straightened out, and you got 15 guys -- nine guys\n-- nine guys, and nobody took more than five minutes, one guy took 15 minutes, and I\nwas in there at least half an hour. I like to know where I stand. I know you cannot tell me\nwhether I made it, cause they told me I\u2019d be notified. And -- can you give me an\nindication?\u201d I wa -- atsfa -- I tell you, the guy\u2019s nice, he will say something. And he said,\n\u201cWell, I cannot tell you anything. But you can go home, and tell your folks you did all\nright. I know that you did all right.\u201d And so I was notified, and they did another nice\nthing, they changed my order, I didn\u2019t have to go back to Europe and pick up the stuff I\nleft there. They sent it back, and the army immediately sent me to Fort Dix. I went to a\nprep school first, for leadership training. So I graduated -- and leadership training school\nwas not mainly for officers -- for future officers, but for future sergeants. For the guys\nwho get higher, but need more leadership training, that was eight weeks. But they added\nthe officer candidates to it, and -- because the army say, \u201cIf they cannot make that course,\nthey sure as hell cannot make the officer\u2019s course.\u201d So I did that, I did all right, and I\nmade two great acquaintance there, which were important in my life. One was my best\nmilitary friend, who was not Jewish, but who had also come from England, so he was\n99\nmilitary. His father was American who went to England, married a British woman, and\nhe was a sergeant [indecipherable]. He became very good friend. He got married while he\nwas in school, when he was not allowed to get married. With my money. He\u2019s -- asked\nme, one day he called up, \u201cI got to get married. I don\u2019t want to lose this woman, can I\nborrow money from you?\u201d Remember this, that a lot of guys borrow money, but we\nnever borrowed from [indecipherable]. I said, \u201cHow much?\u201d He said, \u201c300 dollars.\u201d I\nsay, \u201cSure.\u201d I send him 300 dollars, he got married, he had three boys. But then we\nstarted this school together, and went to Philadelphia, from Fort Dix, on the weekend, to\ngo to a -- to go to an orchestra, I believe, philharmonic. And a famous guy was there, a\nBritish conductor, sir -- sir -- sir -- in the military they got free tickets. So we got together\nfour guys, went to Philadelphia. On the way back, a drunken guy drove into our car, he\nbacked out, high speed. I was asleep in the back seat, I wound up in the hospital. I was\nfive weeks in the hospital by a concussion, broken nose [indecipherable]. And so I didn\u2019t\ngo to the course because I was atained in the hospital, but my best friend went. So, I got\nhealed, and then I\u2019m [indecipherable] there to the doctor, my nose was going back to the\nside like this, it broke in two places. And the specialist -- military specialist, didn\u2019t want\nto correct it. He had made a mistake and not set 1t back when it happened. And he said,\n\u201cWell, what do you want to be, a Clark Gable?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d I said, \u201cI just want a straight nose\nagain.\u201d I -- I -- and he said -- and start pushing on my nose, it started bleeding, and the\nnurse shook her head. When he was out, she said, \u201cDon\u2019t take that doctor.\u201d \u201cYeah,\u201d I\nsaid, \u201cto me, he\u2019s more like a veterinarian, or in Germany, they call a -- a horse doctor. I\n100\nnever se-seen anything like that.\u2019 And he told me to come in my quit. He said, \u201cYou still\nwant it done, you can be -- come to my clinic.\u201d And he want to do this again. I said, \u201cNo,\nI\u2019m refusing now to be touched by you. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re doing the right thing.\u201d To\nmake a long story short, a year later, Walter Reed Army Hospital operated, plastic\nsurgeon, went put it back where it was. Very nice [indecipherable]. He was just -- just a\njerk. Then I went to day school, and we weren\u2019t on the same class -- every class was 250\npeople, and my friend was ahead of me, but because he got married, his weekends were\nspent with his wife, he didn\u2019t study too hard, and he flunked a couple of courses. Not --\nhe was intelligent, but he -- he didn\u2019t study. So they had a deal in the school, if a guy is a\ngood guy, he\u2019s -- if he\u2019s -- they think he\u2019s capable of making [indecipherable], they gave\nhim a second chance, they started him again the second time, beginning of the course, we\nhad three months in already, and he flunked. He was sent back to my class. So he was --\nhere we were together again, and we graduate together. And so in --",
        "A: Okay, I will tell you one thing and then -- a very important thing I\u2019d like to get it in --\nnot now, about prejudice at the officer candidate school. And [indecipherable] the officer\n-- the class I was in, usually a hundred and tw -- 250 people started in class, and out of\n250 people who were selected, 95 percent were college graduates, who were not in\nROTC, [indecipherable] but who didn\u2019t want to go to Korea [indecipherable],and who\nwanted to become officers. So the -- there was a lot of competition, I didn\u2019t have cl -- I\njust finished high school, but the requirement was that as soon as I become an officer, I --\n101\nI -- I studied for two years on the side, for two years college. Now they changed that to\ncollege degree. So I was lucky in that respect too, I can remember that, but the\ncompetition. My room mate, we had two guys to a room, had [indecipherable] top guy,\nand he was from -- he had a master\u2019s degree in hotel business. He went to New Jersey\nsomeplace, or ne -- well anyway, he helped me a lot, and I helped him. He was\nacademically tops, and I was in some other things tops. Like shine your shoes. No, no,\nbut physically. So out of the 250 people, 121 graduated, less than 50 percent. I was\nfeeling pretty good, and I was number 112 out of 121, but I made it, first time. They told\nme -- the officer\u2019s told me if I don\u2019t make it the first time, they\u20191l make me make it a\nsecond time, that my friend did. And they thought I had the capability, and -- but they\ntreated me very nice there, except one major who was prejudice. And that story\n[indecipherable |\n102\nBeginning Tape Five, Side A",
        "A: I think we stopped yesterday on -- on when we graduated from school, and I gave you\nsome figures. Well, there was one major 1n the school who was what they call a tactical\nofficer, who 1s instructor --",
        "A: Yeah, the figures I -- I\u2019m not going to mention.",
        "A: So I\u2019m -- when we actually graduated --",
        "A: -- it was in a theater, with a stage, there were two generals there, and all our former\ninstructors, and officers from the class, they were lined up on the stage. So on -- there\nwere three -- usually, an -- normally, there -- two people call on the stage to have the bars\npinned on by a general. He\u2019s the top academic guy in the class, and the second guy is the\ntop athletic guy, who wins all the military stakes mishum sports, and stuff like. So the\nsecond guy got called up, and all of a sudden they call my name on the stage, and I was\nnumber 121 in line to get the bars, and only the first two get their bars pinned on by the\ngeneral, and the others, somebody else pins them on. I was called on stage, and we\nsupposed to complete the prize to have the bars pinned on by a general because it was\nstated that I was the first naturalized citizen after the war who became an army officer.\n103\nNot only that, that I was cited for having done -- worked the hardest to become an officer.\nAnd then the general made a joke, he said, \u201cAre you f -- did you follow your or-orders\nfrom your immediate superiors not to go on weekends to a hotel and study -- sit ina\nroom, but just to go out and have some fun?\u201d I said no. I was ordered one time, because\nmy colleagues reported me -- we had what in -- what they called buddy ratings. 24 guys\nwho live with you on one floor, had to report on each other what kind of -- criticized you,\nor -- so you could think about your -- they called them buddy ratings. And our instructor\nwould look at them, and I was reported by quite a few of them for not going on leave on\nweekends, which they wanted to, because it\u2019s very hard, the studies, and some guys\ncracked up, and went out -- went out of the school, they couldn\u2019t take it, it was too -- too\n-- too strict, and in my case, I took leave like e-everybody else, went downtown like\neverybody else, but didn\u2019t go to a movie, or didn\u2019t date any girls. I went to hotel room,\nand I studied. So, at the time we had, like I said, a couple of people that need psychiatric\ntreatment, because they just couldn\u2019t take it. But that\u2019s the part of becoming an officer, th\n-- taking a lot of stress and th -- and to me that didn\u2019t mean anything, I had gone through\na lot more than that. But I need to study. I figure if \u2019'm going to make it, I need to study.\nPhysical part was no problem. So I study -- they reported me that I didn\u2019t take it easy on\nweekends, that I went to a hotel room and studied. On Monday the senior instructor had\nme in the office, and said, \u201cYou got to stop this. I don\u2019t want you [indecipherable] about\nit.\u201d Anyway, that was one. So when I -- here we were on a stage, and I was the third one\nto get the bars pinned on by a general. And then we had to say good-bye, salute every\n104\nofficer that was our instructor, were about a dozen or so from my class. And the way it\nworked, you got your diploma, shook hands with a general, and he put the bars on rikey,\nand then went on to the next guy, and then went from rank to rank, lower, lower. Til I got\nto the major who was so prejudiced. And actually, I knew this, he\u2019d tried to get me out of\nschool, get me -- not have m -- not graduate fr-from the officer\u2019s school. And I don\u2019t\nthink I told the story, what -- the actual happening, what -- what -- how I found out that\nhe was prejudiced, and that he really tried to get me, you know out of my way, out of\nschool. And this was not just me, but everybody who was Black, or Jewish, or some other\nforeign [indecipherable] came from foreign country, maybe, or his parents gave him\n[indecipherable] name. He was picking on them, and tried to get them kicked out of\nschool, including me. In my case, it was another story. He used my being foreign-born,\nand having gone through the Holocaust, by saying when -- during a coun-counseling\nsession, \u201cCandi-Candidate Willner, if you become an officer, and the army sends you to\nGermany, wouldn\u2019t that be very bad that you hate those Germans, and you -- because\nthey killed your parents, and your family, and wouldn\u2019t that be very bad for the army,\nsend you to Germany, and you would have to put up with those people, who did this?\nYou probably hate the Germans.\u201d I said, \u201cMajor, I don\u2019t hate the Germans. I -- that\u2019s the\nonly people are responsible for what happened, but I don\u2019t put everybody in the same pot.\nI -- those who have done bad things, I don\u2019t want any part of them, but there\u2019s Germans -\n- many Germans who are good. Otherwise I wouldn\u2019t be here today.\u201d \u201cWell, I don\u2019t\nunderstand you,\u201d he said, \u201cI -- I -- I -- you must hate the Germans.\u201d I said, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t\n105\nhate the Germans. I am German myself, of Jewish faith, and I don\u2019t have that problem. If\nthe army sends me to Germany, I\u2019ll conduct myself the way is expected of me, and I\nimmedi -- I had to keep my personal feelings to myself, in the interest of the army\n[indecipherable].\u201d Well, he kept on and on, digging, but he didn\u2019t get anywhere wi-with\nme, and he apparently tried to talk me into saying something that I hated Germans\nbecause what happened, and therefore I would not be a good representative of the United\nStates Army, or United States, in Germany, because my hatred.",
        "A: Oh yes. If I just take the officer candidate school, seven instructors asked me, and they\neven were so nice that if -- they said if you have any problems during examination time,\nthey were si -- going around checking, see everybody was honest during examination.\nAnd they even told me if you have any problems with the answers in English, write them\ndown in French or German, we\u2019ll figure it out. The other main instructor, same rank as\nthis prejudiced major, who asked me, counseled me, this was the highest rank in our\ngroup, major, he happened to be a war hero, who went to Korea, and was promoted twice\non the battlefield. Was a major, and was -- and -- and received two Silver Stars, which is\na high decoration, and he knew that this guy was prejudiced, and he talked to me a couple\nof times. And he in turn talked to a captain who also asked me, \u201cWhat did he ask you?\u201d\n106\nSo it became known among the other instructor, this guy\u2019s prejudiced. But in my case,\nnot in some of the other cases, they want to see me get through with this, and graduate,\nand they told me not to worry. And knowing this, that I had everybody else behind me, I\nwas able to go ahead, and not be intimidated, and they did a lot of things for me, to help\nme along.",
        "A: It was unusual, it was stated also in g -- on -- on the graduation citation that I had been\nin a concentration camp, and that they -- I was the first one to go through. There had been\nother foreigners may -- foreign born people, but not one who had been in a concentration\ncamp for that long, and had escaped from a transport of -- of a concentration camp. And\nhad been for years, not just short while, imprisoned. And had outlived his time -- that\nnormally was people lived, if they worked for a year, and then they went down, you\nknow [indecipherable] and then I did this for three years, and prior to that, in the inter-\ninternment camps in France, which were not that bad, they didn\u2019t kill people, but some\npeople died from hunger, and so -- and then I had escaped actually twice, once 1n France,\nbut then I got caught there, and well they -- they explained all that. So they were very\nimpressed, I would say and -- and also I felt that -- that I had something tell my fellow\nofficers, that I was a good influence to my friends and colleagues, and they saw it from a\ndifferent viewpoint, they thought it was something, having been there, not hating the\nGermans, but that I could add something to it, which was actually true, because I was\n107\ninvolved once in writing up a plan in Korea, for prisoners of war, not to mistreat them,\nbecause we didn\u2019t do that, we went by the Geneva Convention, and because of my\nexperiences, I was very sensitive to when a guy becomes a prisoner, not like I became\none because I was a Jew, but to become the prisoner in the field, in -- 1n war time, that\nthey are not to be mistreated, or to interrogation -- what do you call that -- tortured. I was\nvery outspoken on that, and -- which all -- is the American way, we don\u2019t mistreat\nprisoners generally, and there were some exception, which also looked -- could have\nhappened -- when I said one time that somebody asked me this could happen here. I said,\n\u201cNot with our -- in our democracy, but there are people -- not the country, that would do\nbad things if not properly supervised, officers included.\u201d To wit, Lieutenant Calley in\nKorea -- in Viet -- in Vietnam, who killed women and children, who went to jail for a few\nyears, but in my opinion, that -- the case of Lieutenant Calley was that his superior\nofficer, a captain, should have been punished more than Lieutenant Calley, because he\nwas responsible for him, he knew what he was doing, and he should have stopped him.\nAnd he should have made a supply officer, not the combat officer up front, where he\ncould kill. Give him a job where he doesn\u2019t need his rifle. And during class on how to\ntreat prisoner of war, because the war in Korea was going on then, they gave us a case in\nschool, which they wanted us to solve. They say suppose you were in combat, and you\ntake Chinese, or Korean prisoners. And the day before you attacked, and you went in\nChinese position, and some of you -- your friends got captured by the Chinese, or the\nKoreans. And you knew that they got captured alive, and the next day you\u2019re on the\n108\nattack -- we -- we Americans are on the attack, and we overrun the Chinese position, and\nyou find the guys they were taken prisoners the day before shot in the head, their hands\nbound behind them. In other words, the Chinese shot the prisoners, your best friends,\nyour comrade. What would b-be your reaction? Well, we had different answers. When I -\n- came my turn, and the instructor asked me, well, somebody said we kill them, and it -- it\nhappened actually, that they got so upset about it during combat, that when they found\nthis -- this really happened that they got killed, with their hands bound behind their back,\nthat our troops went wild, and they took no Chinese prisoners, they shot them. Or in one\ncase, they had a few prisoners, and the lieutenant said to the sergeant, \u201cTake him back.\u201d\nTake him back was generally understood to a prisoner enclave, an enclosure to take them\nout of combat, and keep in a prison camp. But in this particular case, this officer always\nsaid, when he said to the sergeant take him back, he meant take him behind the hill, then\nexecute him. It happened. So he asked me, what would you do, this happened to your\nunit? You find out the sergeant take these guys over the hill, and you find out -- not your\norder, but you find the sergeant did this on his own. What would you do? Let it go on?\nAnd I said no. I would court mar -- if -- if a b -- I would prefer charges against the\nsergeant after the battle, and have him court martialed. \u201cIs that -- that is the proper\nprocedure, isn\u2019t it,\u201d I said, \u201cin the United States.\u201d The instructing officer said, \u201c\u201cThat\u2019s\ncorrect, that is our policy, but in doing this, you will destroy the fighting spirit of your\ntroops, and you have a morale problem, because you\u2019re stopping guys to get even with\nthe other side, who did that. And my answer would be close your eyes to it,\u201d -- and this\n109\nwas not the school\u2019s solution, this -- this was this instructor. He said, \u201cIt\u2019s my -- my\nsolution, not the school\u2019s solution. And if you court martial a guy after the battle 1s over,\nyour -- your -- the rest of your troops probably won\u2019t fight the way they\u2019re supposed to,\nbecause you\u2019re doing something against your own people.\u201d I say, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but we fight\nby the rules of the c -- Geneva convention, which are very humane, and a prisoner is\nsupposed to be taken back and put into an enclosure. When the war is finished, he\u2019s\nreleased.\u201d And if I have a problem with the morale of the troops, my job would be that\nafter the battle is over -- during the battle you can\u2019t do anything, you\u2019re in the heat of the\nbattle. You can\u2019t say that shooting\u2019s [indecipherable] stop this, or because you don\u2019t --\nwe don\u2019t do this. But after the battle is over, the next day or something, after everybody\nalready calmed down, say, \u201cWell, this what I witnessed yesterday. This not the way we\nfight a war, we don\u2019t execute prisoners, and I don\u2019t want to see this happen again.\u201d Not\nthreaten -- threaten him with a court martial, but just imply that you will take stern action\nif this [indecipherable] our side does it. And I finished up saying this discussion back and\nforth, they were back and forth. I say, \u201cIf we do this, we\u2019re not better than they are, even\nthat\u2019s revenge. And you don\u2019t do -- you don\u2019t kill a prisoner.\u201d So that [indecipherable]",
        "A: This was in 1952.",
        "A: I graduated on my birthday, 15 August, 1952. The war was going on in Korea then.\n110",
        "A: I was a lucky guy, yes I did. But the Korean [indecipherable] was coming the finish\nthe war, they gave up. No, I\u2019m kidding. I got there at the end of the war. I didn\u2019t have to\nfight anyone. But my instructors told me if I don\u2019t graduate from officer candidate\nschool, they will send me to Korea everybody else, and they have -- they would think that\nI would get a battlefield commission, having gone through the other thing. And I said,\n\u201cDon\u2019t do me any favors. I fought enough in my lifetime. If I have to go, I go, I do my\njob. But I don\u2019t want to become an officer by being courageous, or getting a medal, and\npost -- posthumously. After I went through this in Germany, I -- I don\u2019t need to die on a\nbattlefield here.\u201d",
        "A: No, on the contr -- on the contrary. They are very understanding, they ask me a lot of\nquestions. My roommate was a guy of Italian descent, this guy [indecipherable] and he\nalso change his name from an Italian name to -- his name was Nash, and he -- we\ncompliment -- compliment each other, and a lot of time discuss things. He was a great\nguy. And I had no problem being a -- I like to finish up by saying this thing. This major,\nwho tried to get me out of school, was not -- wasn\u2019t able to do this all the time. I -- \u2019'm\nsure he was stopped after this case, my case, which became more of less, not public, but\nthe officers talked among them and say this guy shouldn\u2019t be able to do that. Or I\u2019m sure\nthere were actually three majors, and the others were lower ranking, and two majors were\nfor me, and just this one guy against. And the two majors were for me were -- one was\n11]\nlike I said, a war hero, and a -- and the other was a very fine gentleman too, and they --\nthey ask me sometimes some questions, but not in detail, and they thought I was an asset.\nSo anyway, at -- at graduation they were all lined up, and I stepped down when I had my\nbars on, and you said good-bye to each one of the officers who were your instructors, and\n-- and saluted. And you were in the military, where you turned right, and formed a line.\nYou salute, you shook hands, turn right again, turn left again in front of the next guy,\nabout a dozen guys, and here was my major who [indecipherable]. I made two steps\ninstead of one step, and I stepped past him. I didn\u2019t salute him, and I didn\u2019t shake hands,\nor say anything to him. And I know that a lot of people watching, a lot of people knew\nmy dislike -- or his dislike, that we had a problem, but that I -- and I figured I was a -- an\ncommissioned officer now, although I was inferior to him, he -- that I was -- I wanted to\ndo that, I really -- I had planned this, I -- I didn\u2019t just do that on the spur of the moment. I\nsaid I\u2019m not going to salute. On the outside, I salute him, it\u2019s required, but here -- I won\u2019t\nmake an issue out of it. And nobody\u2019s going to say anything during a big ceremony. We\nhad a couple hundred people there. And particularly since I was cited [indecipherable]\nstage. And I\u2019m sure the general didn\u2019t know about it. He might have asking question\nafterwards, why didn\u2019t this lieutenant salute, or -- but they were too preoccupied with\nthings there. And -- so I figured well, everybody saw this, and the people that knew about\nit, they wonder what happened once the doors open, everybody was free to go, this guy\nwould come after me and tell me that was a bad thing. Some guys came over to me and\nsaid, \u201cBoy, I take my hat off for you. I know what\u2019s going on.\u201d And I said -- he never\n112\ncame to me, and he let me go. And I figure if he does, then he will make case of it, but\notherwise he -- maybe you\u2019 ve taught this lesson. And I always hoped that in the milikin --\nmilitary career I would run across him so I could really tell him off. I never did. I don\u2019t\nknow what happened to him, I don\u2019t -- so that was then. Can we stop for a minute?",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t go to Korea, I went to -- everyone went to a specialized school after you\nbecome a second lieutenant. You go to -- this was an infantry officer\u2019s school, that was\nyour basic instruction, whereas other guys went to F-Fort Knox, if they wanted to be in\ntanks. They would then be tank officers. And there was another school to become an\nartillery officer, and one more to be -- infantry, artillery, tanks, and -- yeah, that was it.\nOh yeah, and -- and th-the four -- and the other branch was branch [indecipherable], you\nwere assigned to a branch afterward. You could be assigned to a branch right away, then\nyou went to your branch school to be specialized. You were an ordinance officer, which\nmeant repairing tanks or guns. You went to the ordinance school at -- it\u2019s outside\nWashingham. In my case, I was trained as a combat infantry officer, but I wasn\u2019t\nspecialized as such. I -- I -- my desire was to go into Intelligence because I spoke\nlanguages, and had served with [indecipherable]. So my desire was really to catch spies,\npeople who were stealing our secrets, in this case the Russians were good at that, and our\nside had to find out who these people were to catch them. And that was the intent, that\nwas my plan, to be a counter-Intelligence officer. But that\u2019s not what you become right\n113\naway in the army, you become an Intelligence officer, period. You do first Intelligence\nwork. Not secretly maybe, and sit in the staff, or in an office. And so that\u2019s what I\nintended to be. And I went for six months then, to two schools -- actually eight months.\nNo, six and a half -- six and a half months. I went to Fort Lee, Virginia, and I wound up\nat a course in there I had not intended to take. The last course I took was aerially -- a-\naerially supply. Aerially supply meant for the paratroopers who come -- some out of\nairplanes, but not that. But to -- we supply these guys by air, too. Somebody was\nsurrounded in a battle, like it happened in World War two. They needed guns,\nammunition, first aid, doctors, so they would have to jump over an area where these guys\nwere surrounded, and therefore you needed aerially supplied. So I took that course, and\nwhat it amounted to is jet plane that could be opened up from the rear -- by the rear door,\nnot on the side, and supplies were stacked up in the plane, and you had to shove them out.\nAnd they either came down by parachute over a target, or the plane flew -- flew so low,\njust above ground, like a couple of feet, and would had to be a skillful pilot, and these --\naerially supply officer would be inside the plane to see to it that it got pushed out on time,\nover the target, not over the enemies side, that he would get our supplies, and so I took\nthat course. When I was finished [indecipherable] I wanted to go to Germany. I was\ncalled to an office in the Pentagon, and there was an officer of Chinese ancestry. He was\ncivilian Intelligence officer, he turned out to be a former aide de camp of General\nWainwright, who was the -- we called Vinegar Joe, who fought in Asia during World\nWar two. And very famous, he was in charge there. And this guy that talked to me in the\n114\nPentagon was his aide, Chinese American. He was aide during World War two, and he\nspoke Chinese, and he was at the young age of 27, a lieutenant colonel, because a\ngeneral\u2019s aide. And when I met him, he was civilian Intelligence officer working for the\narmy, and he was my sponsor, if you like. And they wanted me to go to Korea. Of course,\nthat\u2019s where the action was at that time, and I told him that I would like to go to\nGermany, because I know the language, and he said to me that, \u201cOh, you\u2019re not married\nnow, and every officer has to go initially to Korea.\u201d The war was still going on, we didn\u2019t\nknow when it was going to be finished. \u201cAnd it\u2019s better to go now while you\u2019re not\nmarried, because you may be thinking about getting married, and then you have to leave\nyour wife at home for a year. But go now while you\u2019re single, have a good time, if you\u2019re\nnot in combat.\u201d And I said, \u201cOkay.\u201d He said he\u2019II guarantee me that I go to Germany wh\n-- after I come back from Korea. I\u2019m glad I took his advice. I could have insisted I go\nGermany, when -- talk to somebody else and -- but he appreciate I didn\u2019t go over his\nhead, and made a big thing out of it. I went to Korea, and he saw to it that I got a position\nin Korea which was -- called for an officer with th-two grades higher than I was, a major\nEnd of Tape Five, Side A\nBeginning Tape Five, Side B",
        "A: -- went on a troopship, and on the troopship to go into Korea, we went first to\nOkinawa, and I was given a job on the ships as a -- being a compartment commander, and\nthe troops sleep on the troopship four -- four beds high, o-one on top of another, filled\n115\nwith people. We had a lot of problems, guys getting seasick, including myself, but -- and\nmessing up the place, and then other people get sick, well, I took some action by having\n-- having teams go topside, get fresh air, go down and change -- put another\n[indecipherable] and I kept my place very clean. And I got commended by the top guy\nthere, and well, wh-when I arrived in Korea, I -- I was given a letter of recommendation -\n- | forget 1 -- I\u2019m a very -- what\u2019d they say, a very active, or -- I wa -- I was an action\nofficer, what they -- one --not just sits by and watches. So anyway, it was a go -- I -- I\ncame there, bu -- good thing -- also I had my dog on board, which was illegal by the\narmy. The army said no pets to Korea. And I didn\u2019t have anybody, no parents, no -- and I\ndidn\u2019t know what to do with my dog, I -- somebody advised me, \u201cTake him to Seattle, to\nthe port, see the captain of the ship, of the troop transport, because he 1s navy, you are\narmy. The army told you no pets to Korea, but the navy might think different. And you --\nif the navy gives you permission, the ships under -- under navy control. Maybe you\u2019 ll\nfind a captain that\u2019s sympa --.\u201d And I was lucky, I went to Seattle two days ahead of time\nwith my dog. I went up to the ship, I knew the ship I was going to sail on. Saw the\ncaptain of the ship, and I said, \u201cCaptain, I have a dog that I feel very strong about, and I\nwa-want to take to Korea. But the army has regulations that say no, you can\u2019t take any\npets to Korea.\u201d He said, \u201cThat\u2019s the army.\u201d Just like somebody from -- \u201cI don\u2019t give a\ndamn about army regulations. The ship 1s -- I\u2019m the captain, I\u2019m [indecipherable]. You\nwant to bring your dog on board, bring him on board. But bring him one day before\ntroops come on board.\u201d I did. I was lucky, I'd prefabricated a dog house which could be\n116\ntaken apart in no time, just a couple of screws. I came on board, the captain al -- sees me,\ngave me a corner for my dog. And I brought my dog into Korea. I had [indecipherable].",
        "A: What -- I won -- I won\u2019t say a long story, but I -- I was lonely. No parents, no wife.\nThat actually is a thing I really didn\u2019t talk about because it\u2019s too long, and too -- too\ninvolved, and very personal, I think, it -- what one goes through when you\u2019re lonely, or\nwhen you have everybody killed in the family. And I was just like -- the dog to me was\nlike a member of the family, and there were two things that I did to remain sane, actually,\nand to -- not to -- I couldn\u2019t stay behind closed doors was one thing. I all -- I -- even\ntoday I leave the doors open in my house. I go to the toilet, I don\u2019t close the door if it\u2019s\njust my family that\u2019s in the house -- not when there are other people, because I don\u2019t like\nclosed doors. And I didn\u2019t like that before, and I just -- I -- I -- in the camps, you always\nhad comas, people who were the same boat, and my whole story with Michael Swab is\nthe same thing. I had a buddy, I had somebody who -- who felt like I did. And when I\nwas in the army then as an officer, it\u2019s sometimes lonely, because you are maybe the only\nofficer, and you are with the men, but they\u2019re not on an equal level with you, you still\nlonely. So I wung -- wasn\u2019t going to do that. I said, well, even my first sergeant was a\nman 20 years older than myself. When we were in private together, I ask him to call me\nby my first name, not say Lieutenant Willner, or sir -- he\u2019s 20 years older. So I made up\nfor some of this loneliness by doing certain things, and the other thing that they didn\u2019t\n117\ntalk about was having girlfriends. I got involved with other women. I was lonely. And I\nalso, since I was -- since my liberation, I -- I wanted to get married, but I knew I didn\u2019t\nhave an education, I didn\u2019t have a job, or -- in the re -- once I was in the army, I figured,\nwell, a lieutenant doesn\u2019t make much money, but I'll wait til I'll be a captain or so. But I\nwanted to get married, and have children. And I -- there was part, getting married fast,\nnot to be lonely any more. But I said to myself, I must find the right woman, because be\nvery difficult to be married to a concentration camp survivor. You have your\nidiosyncrasies, maybe. But other people have too, who were -- who were not in camp, but\nthere are certain things that we do have. I\u2019m aware -- I\u2019m aware of it. Some people don\u2019t\nknow it, my f -- my best friend, Michael Swab, his whole life, whenever he was with me,\nor alone, walking the street, he look -- he look over his shoulder. He did this all the time,\neven after he got married, because he always thought some Gestapo or somebody was\nfollowing him, that he was being -- so, that was a problem he had, not -- not a big\nproblem, but so I observed him one time doing that. And some people had, like I said,\nidiosyncrasies. They also had -- think they are very bad. I must al -- also say that, since I\nwas very close to Michael Swab, that he beat his second wife. And she told me one time,\nwhen she was -- when they were visiting here, and I -- I was really shook up, and so I\ndecided -- I told my wife, and she said she knows, and thought that was terrible. When\nyou got upset about something, instead of arguing with wife -- I argue with my wife, but\nthen we clear it up before the end of the day, if it\u2019s not cleared up right away. But he beat\nhis wife, so he was -- some of the real bad things from the camps, he took with him, and\n118\nhe applied it to -- so I -- I couldn\u2019t -- this was terrible. I decided I will go with him under\nfalse pretense and talk to him about it, very seriously. Because we had no secrets for each\nother. And I took him to the Potomac River, near -- in a secluded area, nice day. I said,\n\u201cMichael, I got you up here because I want to talk to you. I don\u2019t want anybody around.\nAnd I want to tell -- to tell you -- you beat your wife.\u201d I had to be careful because he -- he\nwould know that she told me or my wife, and that he\u2019|l beat up again. \u201cI -- I-I -- and this\nI-I cannot be quiet about. And you know, we\u2019ve always been very truthful to each other,\nand that is not a thing that I -- that you should do. There\u2019s no excuse for it. Absolutely\nnone, you ca -- tell me anything you want, but I-I will not accept it. You don\u2019t beat your\nwife, you don\u2019t beat women, and I don\u2019t have to tell you why not, you don\u2019t do.\u201d He\nnever said one word. He didn\u2019t say yes, no, or it\u2019s none of your business, which he\nwouldn\u2019t have said. And that was it. So anyway, my loneliness -- oh yeah, finding\n[indecipherable] wife. After I was 19, and out, every woman I went out with, or I was\nintimate with, I always considered, not marrying her, but what am I looking for besides\nsex\u2019? She had to have certain qualities that -- maybe more qualities because I went\nthrough the camps, but particularly because I went through the camps. Have\n[indecipherable] and I start making up a list. Get organized was always m-my way of\ndoing things. And I wind up with good point and the bad points, what I want to see. And I\ngave each question a point, and when I came up with more good points than bad points, I\n-- would she be a good wife? But it was just still a little game I was playing with myself,\nbut I didn\u2019t ge -- consulted anybody else, but -- but needless to say, but I -- I -- I did get\n119\ninvolved with quite a few girls, and didn\u2019t make any difference what religion, or -- I did\nhave one thing I do want to mention. I was a-always very fond of the French language,\nand everybody would have bet that Pll marry a French woman, so I could sp-speak\nFrench all the time. And I -- I thought so, too [indecipherable] my ol -- my oldest son just\nwent to -- they had the 50 anniversary of the Normandy invasion in Europe. He and\nanother officer went to France, and took some pictures there on the beaches there where\nwe landed. And they still have some tank obstacles there. And I had to laugh, because he\nvisited that, he took pictures, and I said, \u201cI was there, too.\u201d He said, \u201cI know where you\nwere at that time.\u2019 He knows exactly where I was. \u201cNo,\u201d I said, \u201canother time I was\nthere, not during the invasion.\u201d When I was in the army, as a criminal investigator, I had\na case, which took me to Karankan, France, which is right behind the beaches where we\nlanded during the invasion. And my son [indecipherable] Karankan, but when I was there\nI met a French girl, and I stayed with her for a couple of days, and then I said, the same\ntime I visit the beaches, and I have a picture with her standing next to the tank\nobstruction. They\u2019re not -- they\u2019re not bodies any more, but there are certain things that\nyou can still see why -- what we encountered there. And -- and on the back it said the\nplace, and the year, the -- and he said [indecipherable] the same place, but not like you\nprobably. So, what I\u2019m trying to say is that I -- I was never alone by doing this, and I\ncame -- I never came -- oh, I was engaged once, to a Jewish girl from Detroit, because I\nwent to the chapel, to Jewish services here -- the military chapel, and I met this man, and\nhe introduced me to his niece, who was visiting from Detroit. She had just graduated\n120\nfrom high school, she\u2019s very cute, and I started dating her a couple a -- they wanted me to\ndate her. I was 26 when I graduate from officer\u2019s school, and the average age was 22,\nguys who [indecipherable] from college. I was a little bit older than the rest of them, also\na little maturer. But I dated her, and I got seriously thinking about marrying her. I\nintroduced her to my relatives in New York, and I -- the one who was against German,\nthe daughter I\u2019d mentioned before, that she lectured me I shouldn\u2019t marry a German, and\nI didn\u2019t tell the rest of the story, I just will -- didn\u2019t want to [indecipherable]. I -- I was\ngoing to break off my alle -- my -- with my cousin, you know, but my wife came to New\nYork to get her citizenship, three weeks after we got married, she met my cousin, and my\ncousin fell in love with her. She loved her, and the -- the one [indecipherable]",
        "A: Marry a German.",
        "A: And I was going to break up with her [indecipherable]. Well, that was okay. So she\nmet her, and there were no more problems. My wife still talked to her, and din -- din --\nshe didn\u2019t throw it up. And -- so back to -- to a girl I got engaged to. She was okay, her\nfamily was okay in New Jersey, but then I was supposed to meet her parents -- excuse me\n-- in -- in Detroit, and I went there, and I had just graduated from officer\u2019s school, I was\nvery proud to have made it, and to have a career maybe, ahead of me, and to have\nsucceeded, and all that stuff, okay. So -- also I -- I probably looked pretty good in\nuniform as an officer at the time. And so she was impressed, probably, but I found out\n12]\nshe was okay, but maybe too immature, just graduated from high school, and I was very\nmature. I could have handled it, but could she handle it, a difficult guy like me? No, but --\nI wasn\u2019t difficult, but I -- I did have certain things I -- I -- the thing came a-abo-about in a\nway that I did not expect it to break off our engagement, but it was the right thing, I was\nlucky. When I visited her parents, they approved of me, and the father took me aside, say\ngoodnight, and said to me, \u201cYou -- you are going to Korea I understand.\u201d I -- [ -- I\nexpected to be ordered to Korea, I didn\u2019t know yet for sure. I said, \u201cYes.\u201d He said, \u201cWhat\n-- what do you want to be, a defender of capitalism?\u201d And he talked to me in the way a\nCommunist was talk -- would talk. And he was entitled to his opinion, but that was my\ncountry, I had went through hard times getting there, and I -- what he basically said that I\nshouldn\u2019t be an officer of an im-imperialist army. And I said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to give up\nmy career be that I\u2019ve practically fought for it,\u201d I went -- so I told him that I was not\ngoing to leave the army, and I could also called it I\u2019m a defender of a democracy. And I\ndidn\u2019t argue with him, but just discuss it. But those were his words, actually, defender of\ncapitalism. So I said to myself afterwards, I\u2019ve nothing against the girl, nothing against\nher parents as people, but this bother me. So knowing that I would be going to Korea, I\nsaid to myself, under normal circumstances, if I\u2019m married, and going to Korea, my wife,\nif I have no children, would either go back to her parents, or probably to my parent\u2019s\nhouse, and live with them til I come back from Korea, and then we have a house, or su --\napartment. So I said, well, I don\u2019t have parents. I don\u2019t have anybody. She will be with\nher parents while I\u2019m in Korea, and every day she\u2019ll hear from her father, \u201cWhat kind of\n122\nlife is this? Your husbands the other end of the world, you\u2019re here, and he\u2019s defending\nimperialism th -- over there in Korea.\u201d And before I know it, before I get back after a\nyear, I have a divorce on my hands. I said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to get married.\u201d This -- she --\nshe going to be under influence of her parents. She\u2019s young. If she had made up her own\nmind, be a different story. If she\u2019d [indecipherable] living with a girlfriend, but her\nintention was to stay on with her parents. And I think she\u2019ll be hearing this all the time.\nI\u2019m not going to start -- I want to get married once, and [indecipherable] and not get\ndivorced. So she had to be the right woman, and I felt she wasn\u2019t the right one, so I broke\nit off. I felt very bad about it, and my aunt told me -- this woman who was against the\nmarriage, \u201cWell Eddie, it\u2019s better to feel bad for a couple of months, than feeling bad the\nrest of your life.\u201d And I agreed with her. I went to Korea, but I had, shortly before Korea\n-- well, this really doesn\u2019t matter, I met another woman, and I\u2019m mentioning this not just\nto mention I went out with women, but that I -- the specific circumstance. I -- when I\nwent to Germany one time [indecipherable] the first time, as an enlisted man, I went to\ncriminal investigation school, I mentioned that. And on the train I met a British girl, who\nwas traveling with her mother from England to southern Germany. And I got to talk to\nher, and she said her mother was Jewish. So she was half Jewish, and that her father had\ndivorced the mother under the nur -- Nuremberg laws. And -- but he wasn\u2019t a Nazi, but\nhe took advantage of the Nuremberg laws. And he left Germany, too, he went to South\nAmerica someplace, with the two boys. And he left the mother and the daughter in\nGermany, they got a -- they got to England. So when I met th-the mother, I was re-\n123\nvisiting friends, and I didn\u2019t know that her daughter who was traveling there, was married\nat that time. I didn\u2019t expect a woman, traveling with her mother, that she was married.\nShe never told me about it, and she came to visit me at the school on weekends. That was\nnear Munich, Germany. I got involved with her, and -- and when I went to Korea, she\ntold me -- she asked me what I was going to do, I said, \u201cWell, I have four weeks of\nvacation. Since I\u2019m not engaged any more, I don\u2019t have any plans.\u201d She said -- and I still\ndidn\u2019t know she was married at the time. She said, \u201cIf you would come visit me.\u201d I said\nyes. She, I think, took four weeks. We got [indecipherable] around the [indecipherable]\nand couple other places, and then she told me she was married, but that she\u2019s going to\ndivorce her husband. And we had not talked about marriage, she and I, we just -- and to\nme it was another attraction. I -- I had -- not going to say that her on my list of\nprospective future wife, particularly just -- she was married, too. And I had no intention\ngo out with a married woman, or -- because my time was valuable, and I figured a\nmarried woman, that\u2019s probably just for sex. But some ba -- maybe I'll marry her, maybe\nnot. Not her -- not the British girl. So we were together four weeks, and I s -- said at the\nend of four weeks, \u201cDon\u2019t wait for me to come back from Korea, even if you get\ndivorced, I\u2019m not going to marry you.\u201d Because it was her intention would get to know\nme better, and I thought -- I never thought one moment I would marry her. And there was\nnothing wrong with her, except whatever the problem was between her husband, she told\nme what it was. And so I knew from the beginning I was just spending -- having a good\ntime, and she was having a good time. So, when we left on last day, we said good-bye for\n124\ngood, and I was on my way to Korea -- after a couple of days, she asked me, in England,\nif you -- you can only get a divorce, which she still wanted to get, if you commit adultery\n-- you admit to adultery. And when she talked about adultery, I said, \u201cWell, in my book,\nmy dictionary, it said adultery is two wrong people doing a right thing.\u201d And -- and so I\ntried to keep -- keep a happy atmosphere, you know? To her it was just good-bye for\ngood. Well, to me, too, but it was no -- no problem for me. She had still hopes that I\nwould -- she was going to divorce her husband, maybe I\u2019 Il be interested. She -- so she\nwent back to England, I went to Korea. All of a sudden -- well, she asked me if I would\nhelp her in -- in her divorce, because she can onl -- if she admits adultery in court, then\nshe can divorce. But I figure I\u2019m single, I have no problem. I have no wife -- adultery, not\nthat I say it\u2019s okay, but she committed adultery, but I didn\u2019t [indecipherable]. I said,\n\u201cSure, you can -- if that helps.\u201d And I was in Korea, I got a letter from the British court,\nfrom a judge, that she swore in court that she committed adultery with me, and they want\nto know whether it was true or not. And I found myself in a situation in Korea, I said -- I\ndidn\u2019t think that far. An officer in the United States army, you\u2019re not supposed to commit\nadultery. An officer and a gentleman, they always put that gentleman in there. You know,\na gentleman in my book is a man who di -- who\u2019ll defend a woman from any man but\nhimself, that\u2019s a gentleman. But so I -- I was in -- I -- what do you call that, in a -- I\ncouldn\u2019t --\n125",
        "A: Ina bind. So I say, if I don\u2019t answer the letter, they going to write to the Pentagon in\nWashington, trying to find Lieutenant Willner, and they\u2019Il write what it\u2019s all about. It\u2019s a\nquestion adultery, and then the army\u2019s going to question me. And I\u2019m not doing the right\nthing, they\u2019re going to kick me out. So what do I do? I had two sleepless nights in Korea,\nand it came to me all of a sudden. I said, I must answer this letter, but I will not admit to\nadultery, because the army [indecipherable] they were very strong on that at that time, not\n-- not -- now it happens all the time, guys get with their fellow officers of lower ranking,\nand used to read in the papers, generals get kicked out, and so it was much more serious\nthan now, now it\u2019s -- okay, so anyway -- but I cannot say I didn\u2019t, because she swore in\ncourt that she did. I\u2019Il call her a liar, which she wasn\u2019t, she was telling the truth. And I\nwouldn\u2019t tell a lie. So I sent a one sentence letter to the British court, I said, \u201cI will\nneither deny nor admit it.\u201d That puts her in the clear, and I didn\u2019t do anything. If the army\ncomes [indecipherable] end of it. So that just on the sideline. We go further. When I came\nfrom -- back from Korea, and I was in -- actually, before moving to Japan, I was on\nteedeewhy, in Japan, on temporary duty, because the war is finished, and we didn\u2019t have\nanything to do. I had my men, they were bored. I studied the countryside in Korea a little\nbit, and I went to Tokyo, I was ordered to Tokyo to take care of some small job, and I\nwas one day -- this very funny. I was one day in the men\u2019s room, doing my business, and\na general was standing next to me doing his business, and he said, \u201cOh, you -- you are\nLieutenant Willner.\u201d I said, \u201cYeah.\u201d He saw my red name tags on. \u201cWell, when you\nfinish, stop by my office.\u201d I had gone to officer candidate school with his son, who was\n126\nnot going to be a professional officer, but as a favor to his father, he became an officer --\na reserve officer. And his -- I had met him once before, with his son, who took me home\nwith him, and -- so I thought he wanted to chat about his son, or what we doing -- or we\ndone since [indecipherable]. So what he said, \u201cYou were here in Tokyo once before from\nKorea. What for?\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d I said, \u201cthey have some stuff to be -- files to clean out\n[indecipherable], and we didn\u2019t have anything to do in Korea, the war is finished.\u201d\n\u201cWell,\u201d he said, \u201cthe army\u2019s spending a lot of money having you -- you and a couple of\nguys come to Japan and take care of -- why don\u2019t we transfer you over here, and you do it\nhere? Because eventually bi -- in Korea we have less and less troops, the war is finished.\u201d\nI said, \u201cGeneral, that\u2019s nice, but my plan is to pick up an education, I like education to\nremain active as an officer, and I want to go back to the States from Korea directly, and\nthen enroll in some courses, night courses, or whatever. And I wanted to go to\nWashington.\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d he said, \u201clet\u2019s do first things first.\u201d \u201cAlso, if I go to Japan, I must\nstay much longer. Here, my year is finished, I go back.\u201d The rules were that you stayed\ntwo years in a place where there\u2019s no war. [indecipherable] go to Korea for\n[indecipherable] one ma -- one year ago, yeah, and then -- actually 1t was nine mon --\nnine months there, in Japan. So they said, \u201cOkay, we\u2019ll give you a special deal. You talk\nto my deputy, and we\u2019 ll transfer your unit to -- to Japan. And I'll --.\u201d\n127\nBeginning Tape Six, Side A",
        "A: I went with my unit to Japan, and everybody was very happy, including myself,\nbecause I wanted to get to know Japan, and I knew I didn\u2019t have to stay for two years in\nJapan. So I stayed nine months in Japan, def -- s -- fixed up my papers saying that they\nagree that I should pick up some courses, that wasn\u2019t -- Japan wasn\u2019t the place\n[indecipherable] might be, and I should then go back, which I did. And I -- and I had nine\nwonderful months in Japan, in Tokyo. And I transferred back to United States, to\nWashington. I was assigned to -- as an assistant to the commandant of the command\nmanagement school at Fort Belwah, which is right outside Washington. And I was living\nat Fort Meyer. Fort Meyer is -- was very nice. That was just for living purposes for me,\nand I commuted every day to Fort Belwah. One year after that, I was assigned to\nHeidelberg, Germany, to the headquarter of the U.S. Army, Europe, where I had been\nbefore as an enlisted man, a criminal investigator, and now I came back as an officer.\nAnd I knew the place, I liked the place. Heidelberg is a very romantic place, very\nbeautiful. The Nekile river flows, there\u2019s an old castle there, and the Americans always\npicked a nice place to put up their headquarters. It was in a bombed out, very romantical.\nAnd there was a university there. It was a famous place, and also good to be stationed. So\nI was assigned there as chief of the analiss section for technical Intelligence. It was a staff\nofficer\u2019s Jo -- assignment, and -- which was good for my record, and my boss was an\nItalian American, lieutenant colonel, whom I got along with very well, but actually, I\nfound out when I -- shortly before going to Germany, that I was supposed to go to Berlin.\n128\nAnd I got this letter from this colonel, and it said, \u201cDue to unso -- foreseen\ncircumstances, you are coming to my headquarters in Heidelberg.\u201d And I didn\u2019t mind.\nBerlin would have been okay with me, too. And my old friend George Strauss was there\nalready, and it would have been interesting in that we were -- would have been -- he -- he\nalready was, George Strauss, a detachment commander, which means you are your own\nboss, you have so many men, and you direct the unit. It\u2019s very much in demand in the\narmy to get ahead, to be the commander of a unit, which I was going to be, but when I\nwent to Heidelberg, I was a staff officer, not a commander of a unit. But that was okay,\ntoo. I got into a position where I had a little bit of supervision. My boss had supervision\nover my friend George Strauss. But my boss, Colonel Skolie, was retiring pretty soon\nfrom the army, and he didn\u2019t care any more about what\u2019s going on, he didn\u2019t want to be\nbothered, un there was something bad going on, and he always told me, \u201cWillner, you\ntake care of it.\u201d And I would call j -- my friend George Strauss in Berlin, and say, the\ncolonel said to do this or do that. He never did, he left 1t up to me to s -- act in his name.\nAnd it was a good arrangement, and I liked it, and George Strauss didn\u2019t know that -- I\ntold him afterwards, I said, \u201cThe colonel never said any such thing, I was making these\nup.\u201d And he was m -- ma -- it was okay with him. And so, after I got assigned to\nHeidelberg, to Colonel Skolie, he had a habit of going every morning for coffee to the\nofficer\u2019s club at 10 o\u2019clock, and he asked me to come along with him. And we sat down,\nhad our cup of coffee [indecipherable] was little bit of exercise, since always sitting\nbehind a desk, and then -- so Colonel Skolie, the first two weeks, he was watching me\n129\nlike a hawk while drinking coffee. And I looked around the young women, and he said\n[indecipherable] to me, \u201cWell, you probably noticed that I watch you.\u201d I said, \u201cYes, I\ndid.\u201d \u201cWell, there\u2019s a reason for it. The guy you are replacing, we had to get rid of him,\nhe was kicked out of the army. He turned out to be a homosexual officer, and he got\ncaught in something. That\u2019s why you were changed from Berlin, to -- to replace him here\nin my headquarters. And I\u2019m very much pleased that you are interested in girls.\u201d So he --\nhe was afraid he gets another guy who was a homosexual. It was not very common, but it\n-- it did happen. So Colonel Skolie had -- once before in his career had another\nhomosexual. He was afraid himself that someone might think he might be ac/dc, that the\narmy is going to check him. But he wasn\u2019t, he was a Catholic, with a Protestant wife, and\nhe had a good marriage, but except for religion. He insisted on going to Catholic church,\nand she insisted going with the children -- well, he was a very nice guy. So here I was in\nHeidelberg, and he was happy that I was not a homosexual, you know, I was very much\ninterested in girls, and I started dating like mad. I met my wife after three months there.\nIn those three months, before I met my wife, I had gone out with three different girls, and\nhad a good time, and one of them was a -- woman was in the PX -- I don\u2019t know you\nknow what the PX 1s, sales girl. And when I got married she was a saleslady who\nadvised my wife what -- what she\u2019ll buy. Well, she knows I\u2019m going to get married, but -\n- and she was just a girl, German girl that just want to get married to an American. And\nwat -- when I met my wife was in the headquarters in the office, a very interesting, I\u2019m\nnot going to tell the whole story, but I knew immediately, and I -- like I said I was in\n130\nmeantime going from 19 to 31 years, 12 years a long time, and I had -- in the meantime, I\nhad a couple of girls I might have considered, including my fianc\u00e9e. But when I met my\nwife, after three months I ask her to marry. I was three months in Heidelberg, and another\nthree months that I met her.",
        "A: Yup.",
        "A: Probably a hundred. No, no we -- but I was particularly interested in her opinion about\nthe Nazis, and she was working in these headquarters, in another floor, in a big building,\nand I watch her once in awhile. And a lot of girls were dating American soldiers, and I\nlooked, and she didn\u2019t date, or talk to any American soldiers. She wasn\u2019t one of those that\njust want to get married to an American, and to have a boyfriend. And so I said hello to\nher a couple of times, and she didn\u2019t seem to be interested very much. And I was, in\nmeeting her, because she wasn\u2019t dating anybody, I know that -- well, she could have\ndated a German outside that I didn\u2019t know about, but you -- and so when she was\nworking -- only when she wasn\u2019t studying, but she didn\u2019t have any money to continue her\nstudy in Heidelberg. She wanted -- she majored in foreign languages, and she knew\nItalian, and some Russian, and English very well, of course, and she had a job that she\nhad to know English for, and so she interrupt her studies every time she didn\u2019t have any\nmoney, she s -- worked up there. And I could visit her in her office, but she couldn\u2019t visit\nme in my office, because that was cofe -- classified secret, the door, you couldn't get in,\n131\nsomebody had to open up on the other side. So to meet her -- she didn\u2019t seem to be much\ninterested meeting me. I figure I\u2019Il meet her. I ask her one time -- oh yeah, the first thing\nthat happened, I -- there was a trial in Heidelberg over the SS -- who -- who was born in\nHeidelberg, they caught him after the war, he was a -- not -- not high-ranking, a simple\nguy, who had -- who was accused of having killed three people. They didn\u2019t -- didn\u2019t say\nJews or not Jews, but he was an SS, but they weren\u2019t sure they could prove it, and the\nonly one and the -- that they caught in Heidelberg, who was a native of Heidelberg. But\nwhen I read the story in the paper, I read that what he did before he became an SS. He\nwas street sweeper in Heidelberg, a guy, very simple, no education -- very little educa --\nand a guy with probably inferiority complex, who all of a sudden became an SS, with a\nnice uniform, looked sharp, but was dumb, not educated. And was somebody all of a\nsudden, and then beat up Jews, or whatever. He was a member of the elite in Germany.\nAnd I looked at it and said, \u201cThey ought to cor --,\u201d I said to myself, \u201cthey ought to catch\nthe big guys, not a small guy like him.\u201d Some of the mass murderers, and n-not\n[indecipherable] people. And I decided I wanted to see a trial. I didn\u2019t know the guy, he\nwas not in the camp I was in, and -- but I was just curious how the German courts were\ndoing with a guy like that. So I told my boss I wanted to go that day -- I want a day off, I\nwant to go to court, I need you okay that. And I went out the door. My wife started going\nout the door, too from a different [indecipherable]. I said, \u201cWhere are you going, Miss\nSuberchess?\u201d And she has a Latin name [indecipherable] in Germany during the Middle\nAges, only the doctors, teachers, and the pe-people who could read and write, they spoke\n132\nLatin, not German, educated people. And her family was a gen -- m-mainly a family of\nteachers. So I said, \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d She said she\u2019s going to court. \u201cOh,\u201d I said,\n\u201cI\u2019m going to court, too.\u201d I said, \u201cWhat -- what kind of a crime did you commit?\u201d I was\ntrying to make a joke.[indecipherable] \u201cI didn\u2019t commit a crime, but I\u2019m just watch a\ntrial.\u201d I said, \u201cI\u2019m watching a trial, too. What kind of a trial, are you a witness, then?\u201d No,\nshe didn\u2019t want to tell me right away. And it came out she\u2019s going the same place I was.\nAnd I couldn\u2019t think of a reason why a German girl would be interested in SS, unless she\nwas a relative, or something. So I ask her, \u201c\u201cWhy are you interested in SS?\u201d And she gave\nme the -- a reason, the same reason that I was interested in it. See how justice is done in\nGermany today. So that got me interested in her, more than just for other reasons, and a\nyoung woman is interested in -- in Nazis, and [indecipherable]. And I said, \u201cOkay, you\nwant a ride?\u201d She was going by bicycle, I had my car, and is that okay? She accepted a\nride, and the -- excuse me [indecipherable]. So we got to the court, I parked my car, I --\nlike I said, I was in uniform, and came out with her, and there\u2019s a -- a guard or some guy\nup there by the doors on the courtroom, and the courtroom is filled already with people,\ncomplete -- the guy said, \u201cCan\u2019t go in, it\u2019s full.\u201d Well, I figured I am an officer in the\nUnited States army, they lost the war, I\u2019m going to go in, no matter what. And I -- and I\nspoke German. So I said to the guard, \u201cWho gave you your order that you can\u2019t let an\nAmerican army officer in?\u201d \u201cOh,\u201d he said, \u201cthey didn\u2019t tell me an American army officer,\nthey said nobody goes in.\u201d \u201cWell, I -- | am sorry, but you will make a place for me. I'll --\n, and there was my future wife, left out. I couldn\u2019t speak for her, that -- give her a seat,\n133\nbut I, as an army officer had -- was considered maybe -- they -- they -- they figured we\nhad -- we won the war, and we wer -- demanded certain things, but I wasn\u2019t normally\ndoing that, but I was insisting here, in this case. Make a long story short, my wife didn\u2019t\ngo into the court, and this guy told a German civilian to leave, that he had to make some\nspace for some important people. But only me, and I sat up there, and I listened to an\nunimpressive to -- trial. The guy -- I almost felt sorry for the guy -- the former -- he was a\nbeat up old -- well, not old man, but he was, at that time I\u2019m going to see him an old man,\nbecause I was only 30 and something, and he was 45 or something. Well, they couldn\u2019t\nprove actually, any murder, but he admitted having been SS, having been in certain place,\nand had beaten up people, and to -- but not -- they couldn\u2019t prove that he murdered\npeople. So he got a couple of months in jail. That was standard throughout Germany\n[indecipherable]. But I -- 1t bothered me. I said, \u201cHere is a guy who probably had an\ninferiority complex. In the concentration camp he could beat up professors and doctors,\nand people who were more intelligent, and more educated than he was, because he had no\neducation. And he got caught. But the big biggies, they were free. And I sa -- I thought\nthat the guys who were over him should be sitting in -- in the docket there then. Well, I\ncan\u2019t say I\u2019m s -- I felt sorry for him, but I -- I -- I have -- didn\u2019t think that was -- he\nshouldn\u2019t be sitting there, that somebody else should be. Okay, that\u2019s Heidelberg. So then\nwe come to a long story, and I do want to say -- to be [indecipherable] how I finally got\nto marry my wife, what problems there were involved, on the part of the Americans, on\n134\nthe part of the Germans, on the part of her family, on the part religion, politics, east, west,\ncombination --",
        "A: Th-That is ma --",
        "A: But 1-it\u2019s a long story, with a rabbi involved, and a general involved, and a -- the\nGermans, because of Communism, and because of Nazism too. And also, not myself, I --\nI wanted to make sure one thing, I\u2019m not marrying to a big Nazi family, in respect to my\nparents, not that she would have had any guilt in this, her father, if he would have been a\nNazi, but that would be a very odd thing. But I did have a secretary, or a -- he was\nactually called in the army, a clerk, for -- he was a soldier, who could type up my\nclassified stuff. He was a Jewish guy, by the name of Ross Engle. He was -- had a\nmaster\u2019s degree in political science, he was drafted. Didn\u2019t have any desire to become an\nofficer. He would have made a good officer, but -- little guy like me, and he was going\nout with a German girl that I also knew, and I just talked to [indecipherable] in the\nfinance office, like a cashier, or something like that, military finance office. And his case\nis interesting, 1t was just the opposite from mine. He met this very nice, young girl, very\nlovely, and it turns out that she came from big Nazi family. So big that it was a famous\n135\nname in Germany. He was her -- the brother of her mother, of the Rice Youth Leader,\nwith all the German Jews went into uniform, the Nazi party member. And -- like the boy\nscouts, but they wore little knives, and all that. I would have been one, I would have been\nJewish, but -- the Hitler Youth. That\u2019s what it -- what -- Hitler Youth Leader. He was the\nHitler Youth Leader of Germany. There were two during Hitler\u2019s reign, and he was one\nof them. So the mother was the sister of this guy. Well, that was during the war, and I\nfigure well, after the war -- he figured the -- that the war is finished, that they don\u2019t keep\ntheir mouth shut, because they were Nazis, and anti-Semites, probably. Well, you didn\u2019t\nhave to be a Nazi to be an anti-Semite, necessarily. You could have been Nazi, and have\nknown some Jews that you liked, and still be a big Nazi, and -- and still like Jews\nsecretly, or something. But in his case it turned out, the poor guy, he was very smart --\nlike I said, he had a master\u2019s degree in political science. He was only a company clerk, he\nwas doing good work, and he -- he met this girl, and so it turned out her family\u2019s Nazi,\nand when he talked to me about this, he told me then that his father is a rabbi, and his\ngrandfather was a rabbi, and here he was in -- marrying into a Nazi family. H-He was in\nlove with the girl. Well, I said, \u201cWell, I consider myself lucky, I also -- y- you know\nabout my going out with Miss Dambotsios, and I found out from my wife only recently\nthat he tried to date her too, one time, but she didn\u2019t want to go out with him. And so, he\ncame to my wedding, and he took all the pictures. I have pictures of -- very nice guy.\n136",
        "A: So I was very much impressed with her ideas about Nazism, and how much she knew\nabout Jews. Not from her parents, but after the war, because they didn\u2019t have any Jews\nwhere she lived, in the countryside there. All she did, she thinks one girl that she\nbefriended was Jewish, probably, but she wasn\u2019t sure, when she was a kid. And so\n[indecipherable] I did get married to this girl, and he got permission right away, in the --\nin the army, you had to get permission, because -- not just for security, but they didn\u2019t\nwant any bad elements to come into United States, girls who were prostitutes, or --\nexcuse me, or had other things, Communists, or something. And so they tried to get the --\nthe army required two things . In one, a form, a letter from your commanding officer,\nyour boss, that he certif -- that he okays that so and so gets married to -- and there\u2019s -- he\nhad to do some checking with the police, and then finally approve it. In a case of an\nofficer, in my case, I had to meet Colonel Skolie, my immediate superior, but it was only\na performer thing. I had the paper typed out, and I just said, \u201cWould you please sign my\npermission to get married?\u201d Because I was an officer, I had more of a privilege, let\u2019s say.\nAnd they -- they -- they assumed that an officer, which wasn\u2019t always true, had the\ncommon sense not to marry a prostitute, or -- but they did. Some of the best looking girls\nwere prostitutes there. And they were [indecipherable] glad to get rid of them, send them\nto United States. And there were guys who knew their wives were prostitute, and -- and\nstill want to marry them. But anyway, when I came with my paper to my colonel, he of\ncourse signed it right away, and he had known me for awhile already, so we had no\nproblem. But then my -- the second thing that we had to get was permission from the\n137\nchaplain -- not permission, to have the chaplain signature on there. If you\u2019re Jewish, you\ngo to the Jewish chaplain. That\u2019s the -- in the army they have chaplains who are catering -\n- catering wha -- providing the military with moral support, or religious support, who on\nSundays have a mass, if they\u2019re Catholic, or they\u2019re Protestant, and on Friday night have\na Jewish service in that army chapel, which is -- in the army serves all faith. So when the\nJews have their service, they cover up the cross, usually, and the rabbi comes and talks\nfrom the chapel. In that time the Jewish community in Heidelberg was about 200 people.\nSo we had a Jewish chaplain, in this case, Orthodox. So there is -- you never know what\nthe chaplain, if he\u2019s Jewish, whether Orthodox, Reformed, or Conservative. The army\ntook them in, and there were usually many Orthodox rabbis who didn\u2019t have a job\nbecause every o-orth -- there a lot of ri -- guys -- rabbis, who don\u2019t have a congregation\nhere in the United States. And the army needed rabbis, and they went to [indecipherable]\ncalled the chaplain\u2019s board, or the chaplain -- they advised the army on who might make\na good military chaplain. And they only re-recommended Orthodox people, which was\nwrong, because the majority of Jews are not Orthodox in the United States of -- United\nStates Army. In Israel it\u2019s a different -- even there they\u2019re not -- they\u2019re not the majority.\nBut the Orthodox chaplains are required not to s-say the prayers all in Hebrew, but to talk\nmainly English, and have the He-Hebrew. Whereas the -- the Reform rabbis have\neverything English, and I preferred that because w -- if I wanted to say a prayer or\nanything, I like to understand what I\u2019m -- I could read Hebrew, but I didn\u2019t understand. I\nstudied for Bar Mitzvah, and never was. Two weeks before my Bar Mitzvah, the war\n138\nstarted, in 1940, and I was not Bar Mitzvahed, so -- but I knew how to read Hebrew, and\nI knew the prayers, but I didn\u2019t understand it. I was never much interested in it, but -- but\nwhen I did go to chapel, I wanted to make sure if I did say something, I want to\nunderstand it. So, with the Orthodox, we had no common ground, they -- they didn\u2019t do\nwhat the army [indecipherable] told them to, to say it in English, but they -- they rattled,\nand they shugon, and they went through the motions like the Orthodox do, and I didn\u2019t do\nthis at ho -- in my hometown in Germany, and I didn\u2019t do this here, but [indecipherable]\njust went along, everybody chanted certain songs. So, the one we had in Hamburg that\ntime was Orthodox, and I knew was going to face, going with my paper to have him sign\nit, he probably would say how about your wife converting before I sign the paper. And\nexactly what happened. But, before I went to the Jewish chaplain, I went to the cath -- no,\nto the Protestant chaplain. There were three chaplains there, Catholic, Protestant, and\nJewish. And the Protestant chaplain was the head chaplain, he had the highest rank. He\nwas a colonel, and the Jewish chaplain was a major. And like I said, I was a lieutenant, so\nI was even lower. They all had ranks. I went to the chief chaplain, becau -- you see, it just\nsaid chaplain\u2019s signature, but what they meant was of your faith. There wasn\u2019t -- we\ndidn\u2019t have to do this, but I figure I\u2019m going to get around this Orthodox chaplain, who 1s\ngo -- not going to sign my paper, because he wants my wife to d -- to convert. And I went\nto the Protestant chaplain, and he said, \u201cWell,\u201d he said, \u201cyes, I could sign your paper, but\nI have to respect the Jewish chaplain, he is [indecipherable] your faith here, and I would\nfeel better if you get his signature.\u201d And I said to the chaplain, \u201cI tell you the truth, I\n139\ndidn\u2019t go to the Jewish chaplain because the Orthodox. That\u2019s okay with me, but I am\nafraid he is going to ask me for my wife to convert before he sign the paper. And I\u2019m not\nwilling to let that happen, because although my wife probably would convert to marry\nme, but to me it doesn\u2019t mean a thing, and I don\u2019t approve of the Orthodox, I don\u2019t go\naround -- if we had a Reform rabbi, I would consider it, but we don\u2019t happen to have\none.\u201d And he said, \u201cTry it anyway.\u201d Okay, I went to see the Jewish chaplain. I knew him\nalready. And he was a guy who was not -- not very nice. He was very Yiddish, if you say,\nand from he -- like he ca -- he came out of the ghetto, and he was telling me what to do,\nand that my wife or I should do this or that. And I said, \u201cI am not Orthodox, rabbi, please.\nI respect your views, I want you respect mine, too. And I, if I consider myself anything, I\nam Jewish, and I\u2019m not religious. And, as a matter of fact, I have questions not about\nJudaism, but religion in general, and my faith, because of the concen,\u201d -- he knew I was\nin concentration camp. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not sure about God, but in the respect m-my parents\nwould have been alive, and they would have wanted me to marry in the chapel, Jewish.\nAnd they probably would have approved of a non-Jewish wife, but I -- I -- I would get\nmarried in this chapel, but not Orthodox.\u201d And I knew that the chapels in the army, even\nif they were Orthodox, if he did approve of a marriage, or a wedding [indecipherable] to\nperform a wedding, he could perform this in a way that was not approved by the army,\nwas not completely Orthodox, but --\nEnd of Tape Six, Side A\nBeginning Tape Six, Side B\n140",
        "A: \u201cHow about converting your wife before I sign this paper?\u201d I said, \u201cI may -- no thank\nyou, we\u2019ve have talked about extensively. I just want your signature, so I can go ahead\nand get married.\u201d He hesitated, he said he wanted to talk about conversion to my wife,\nand -- who was not with me. And I said, \u201cNo, ki -- rabbi, this is between me and my wife,\nnot between you and my wife. And we talked about it plenty, and me -- don\u2019t think -- I\nthink my wife is a good -- will be a good wife, and had a good background, and I\ncouldn\u2019t require more than that. So please sign my paper.\u201d And he said he wants to talk to\nher, he wants a conversion. I said, \u201cNo, I told you, we\u2019re not -- she\u2019s not going to convert.\nNot because she doesn\u2019t -- I don\u2019t want to.\u201d And he was really upset because a Jew was\ndoing this. But that\u2019s mine life, not his life, or anybody else\u2019s. So I said, \u201cOkay, you\u2019re\nnot going to sign? I\u2019m going back and I\u2019Il see what we can do about this.\u201d He said, \u201cYou\n-- | won\u2019t sign til I talk some more to you.\u201d He didn\u2019t sign, he didn\u2019t say til she converts,\nbe -- he could not do that. And I said, \u201cBefore I leave your office, rabbi, I\u2019m going to tell\nyou, you are a bad rabbi. You are a bad military officer. Here I was, a lower ranking guy,\nand I\u2019m telling you something that somebody should have heard a long time to you. Not\nbecause you don\u2019t want to -- me to -- you know, give paper to marry, or my wife to\nconvert, because in general, you run lousy services here in this chapel, and this 1s not just\nme who\u2019s saying this. You are an Orthodox rabbi, and I\u2019m not Orthodox, that\u2019s not why\nI\u2019m against you. Because the army requires you, as an Orthodox rabbi, to conduct most of\nyour service in English, and that\u2019s why you lost the congregation here, and there are\nabout 200 Jews here, and you walk in here on a Friday night, you get a dozen people\n14]\nhere, you don\u2019t get anybody. And we had rabbis who were Orthodox, who had a lot more\nattraction to get Jews in here. Apparently you don\u2019t care. Y-You care about certain things\nabout Judaism.\u201d And I -- finally, I shouted at him, and that was it, I walked out. And I\nwas told I can get permission to get married without getting his signature on there. Okay.\nTwo, three weeks later, I heard about a plane going to Israel for American military\nofficers who were chaplains, or rabbis, for the clergy, military clergy. And it was a\nprivate trip, a German airplane, passenger plane, but somebody in the headquarters was\narranging this, to visit the holy land, which is for Jews, Catholics, it\u2019s for everybody,\nChristian and Jew. So it was a very cheap price, 200 dollars, I believe, for two weeks in\nIsrael, including the trip. This was in 1956 -- \u201957. And I heard there were two seats empty\non there, they couldn\u2019t fill two seats. But like I said, all the people going were -- were\nclergymen, and I found out that my rabbi wasn\u2019t going, which was fine with me, but two\nseats were free, but you had to pay for it, just like the rabbis did. For the rabbis it was not\npaid for by the army, but it\u2019s just some time off they got that -- seeing the holy land. I\nhad an uncle in Israel, who I\u2019m -- talked about before on the tape, who went to Israel,\nbecame prisoner of war, fought for the briti -- with the British, and -- my mother\u2019s\nbrother, and who broke the saber for the police, that\u2019s the story I have here on the tape.\nAnd I wanted to see him, and he was getting to be an old man, he -- he was a widow in\nthe meantime, no children, and he was my favorite uncle, actually. And he also had done\nsomething in the war, fought against the Germans in the first World War, he was in\n[indecipherable]. Okay, so I went and I said, \u201cIf these seats not -- can I pay for one of\n142\nthese seats and go to Israel?\u201d \u201cSure.\u201d I put my name on the list, off I went to Israel. Who\nsits next to me? The only -- the only Reformed rabbi military we had in Germany. I had\nheard of him, but he was far away from where I was at. He is my -- he sits next to me,\nand we look at each other, and he didn\u2019t know who was I, I didn\u2019t know who he was. And\nI mention my name, and he said, \u201cWillner, Willner. I got it. You are the one that gave\nhell to the Orthodox rabbi in the headquarters in Heidelberg where there\u2019s chaplain.\u201d I\nsaid, \u201cHow do you know?\u201d You know, to -- word had gotten around in the meantime,\nthere was this young officer who we called this chaplain of the doorma, and what\nhappened, there was a -- a retreat for Jewish chaplains, military chaplain, and Jewish\nmilitary chaplain assistants. Every chaplain had an assistant, a Jewish guy in the case of a\nJewish chaplain. In the case of the Catholic chaplain, he was Catholic soldier. And they\nwere the clerks, the secretaries, in fact. So our rabbi had the secretary, a Jewish guy, a -- a\nsergeant or something, who was also main career in the army, and when I had the\nargument with the chaplain, door was open to the next office, and there was the Jewish\nchaplain assistant sitting outside. And he had gone on this retreat, and he had told the\nother ch-chaplain assistants that, you know, \u201cSome young lieutenant in Heidelberg, he\nreally came in one day, and he gave my boss, who\u2019s a major, gave him hell, told him off\nin no uncertain terms, what a bad rabbi he was. I -- I -- I never heard anything like it.\u201d\nAnd so, he had all the other chaplain assistant. Then the assistant of the chaplain I was\nsitting next to on the airplane, he had heard it from the assistant from the Orthodox\nchaplain, the story. He said, \u201cYou are the guy I -- Willner, who wanted to get -- want to\n143\nget married, and,\u201d -- I say, \u201cWell, that\u2019s the whole thing. I don\u2019t care about Orthodox, and\n-- but I just want to have him sign my paper, and if he didn\u2019t want to sign it, and didn\u2019t,\u201d -\n- also said I -- I couldn\u2019t use the chapel, but maybe get some other rabbi to come. There\nweren\u2019t many rabbis in Germany, but -- to perform the ceremony. And I said, \u201cWell, I\ndon\u2019t get married -- I got married at city hall. I\u2019d -- it\u2019s not required that I get married\nunder Jewish law, or [indecipherable] law in the chapel, I just don\u2019t get married in the\nchapel.\u201d And so the Reform rabbi said, \u201cYou have a little problem there. I -- I don\u2019t really\nsee it as a problem. I don\u2019t know your future wife. I think differently about these things,\nand I\u2019m willing to marry you. Beca I -- if you want -- you want to get married in the first\nplace in the chapel, why should you be kept out of the chapel because the rabbi doesn\u2019t\nagree? That\u2019s not his private property, the chapel,\u201d he said. \u201cHe should marry anybody\nwants to get married.\u201d I said, \u201cYeah, he -- he\u2019Il marry anybody wants to convert. Maybe\nsome guy matries a prostitute off the street, as long as she c-converts to Judaism, he\u2019 II --\nhe\u2019ll marry her, probably,\u201d you know. And so this guy -- by this time we were finished\nwith the trip. In Israel we separate, I\u2019m going to see my uncle, they went sightseeing. In\ntwo weeks we met again to depart Israel, and on the way back, I sat next to him again,\nand he said, \u201cYou [indecipherable] Israel, and -- and by the way, do you still want to get\nmarried in the chapel?\u201d \u201cYeah,\u201d I said, \u201cyes. Because my parents would like to see me\nget marr -- and it\u2019s a nicer thing than just signing a paper in city hall, and I'll go for a\nJewish ceremony, but nothing -- even Orthodox, you know, but -- but not somebody who\nrequire my wife to be a -- become a,\u201d -- he, \u201cOkay, I don\u2019t require your wife to convert,\n144\nbut after I meet her, I make up my own opinion I want to marry you.\u201d He wanted to see\nwhat kind of woman she was, and -- so -- \u201cBut you have to come to my place, get\nmarried in my chapel, I cannot do it in that chapel in [indecipherable].\u201d I said okay. \u201cBut\nfirst you introduce me to your wife.\u201d So we went, and he secluded himself for about two\nhours in his office while I was waiting outside. And I said, \u201cWhat are you guys doing in\nthere? You -- you converting my wife now, when she comes out you say she is a Jew.\u201d\nAnd he -- he was asking her questions, and telling her. And he says, \u201cYour wife, 1t seems\nto me she probably knows as much about Jude as you do, if not more.\u201d I say,\n[indecipherable]. \u201cWell, I gave her a couple of books to learn some more about Judaism,\nsee, because I want to -- if I marry her in a Jewish ceremony, I want her to know about\nJudaism, but no conversion.\u201d [indecipherable]. And as far as the actual date is concerned,\nwe can make that later. I went back to Heidelberg -- and his place was a couple hours\naway from Heidelberg, and I -- he -- yeah, a-at that time, talking about luck, not his luck,\nthe Orthodox chaplain was ordered back to United States before my wedding day came\nup, and I was to go to the other chaplain -- because he had a child that was -- mentally\nhad a problem, and for personal reasons he was transferred back to United States, to\nanother job in the army. And we had no chaplain in Heidelberg, and so the chaplain\ncalled me up, the -- he informed that, \u201cOh, you are lucky. You don\u2019t even have to come\nmy chapel down here, I\u2019Il come to your chapel. You -- Pll perform the marriage in front\nof the Jews that you know, that live in Heidelberg, and so as we planned to do here, but\nyou do in your chapel. I could not have done this if your chaplain was still there, that\u2019s\n145\nlike hitting him in the face, you know, that\u2019s some -- making him look bad. But he\u2019s not\nthere, and so we\u2019re not doing -- he\u2019s not coming back either, not [indecipherable] gone\nfor sure.\u201d [indecipherable] fine. So he said, \u201cWell, you know, we\u2019re not going to have a\nbig thing.\u201d I said, \u201cI don\u2019t want a big thing. Just a few friends from the office,\u201d or -- non-\nJews, Jews, my boss is going come to the wedding, and we go to city hall, say -- in\nGermany you have a very f -- not fancy, but a more former wedding -- even in the city\nhall when you get your papers -- not talking about the party, or dinner, or something. But\nso he came to Heidelberg, and we went to the chapel. I took my boss along, my bosses\nboss, high ranking officer. Rosinger, the guy who was going to take the picture, and my --\nand the only Jewish guy in my -- no, Rosinger was one in the military Jewish guy, and I\nhad one civilian [indecipherable] for me, who was a GS 12, who was an expert on\nIntelligence some field, who was born as a German Jew in Berlin, whose father had been\narrested in the Crystal night, going to Dachau, and the mother was Christian. The mother\nthought the father\u2019s not going to come back from Dachau, she committed suicide in\nBerlin. And -- and the father came back from Dachau, and his wife was dead. But that\u2019s\njust -- this happened. So Jerry Coats, who was also Jewish, then came along. He married\na girl also from a Nazi family, a judge, a Nazi judge who didn\u2019t want any part of him, but\nhe was the other Jewish guy. So we had Jerry, and Rosinger, and my boss, and the boss\u2019\nboss, and that was it.\n146",
        "A: They asked to come, and the father was retired already, by \u201965, and they said to him\nwhen he applied, \u201cOnly in case of death.\u201d [indecipherable] allowed to go to y-your\ndaughter\u2019s funeral in Heidelberg. And he said, \u201cThen I don\u2019t have to see her any more,\u201d\nwhen she died, and -- you know, ridiculous, but they -- what they wanted to do, people\nwho were drawing social security in East Germany, which he was, as a teacher, they were\nhoping they were staying in the west then, then the west will have to pay social security\n[indecipherable]. But they didn\u2019t -- they couldn\u2019t come. They did come one time, but not\nfor our wedding.",
        "A: After I got married. They stayed a couple of days, and then went back. So we went to\nchapel, the day came [indecipherable]. He performed a Jewish ceremony, breaking the\nglass. It was pretty much -- just wasn\u2019t very Orthodox, he did other thing. He gave us a\nHebrew certificate, Hebrew and English, signed officially by him, so that we had a\nJewish marriage, and our piece -- people there at the altar with me. And he made a little\nspeech, and then he said, \u201cWe\u2019re going to go for a snack downstairs.\u201d They had a social\nhall downstairs, that they had in all the chapel of the churches here, and you meet for the\nornek Shabbat on Friday night. And said okay. I actually planned to take them to lunch\nevery -- the -- all these people. And we go downstairs, and very quietly -- this is a big\nbuilding, right across from the headquarters. Very quietly, a lot of the Jews that knew me,\nor didn\u2019t know me, they had passed the word around, have had the wedding very quiet, I\nshould have a surprise. We come downstairs to the social hall, there are about 150 - 200\n147\npeople there, not just Jewish, for our marriage, and the food, and everyth -- they had done\nthis -- our wedding was upstairs in the chapel -- very quietly through the back door. And\nsomebody stood in the street, and they said, \u201cBe quiet, don\u2019t talk, this way,\u201d and so. Not\nonly did we had the rabbi, and these other people there, I had a second rabbi there. And\nthe rabbi whose wife was a woman who knew my family, was born in the same town that\nI was born in Germany, who knew my family, he\u2019s still alive today. He died since. He\nwas con-Conservative, but he had just been assigned to Germany, and he\u2019s been assigned\nto fill a chaplain job, but he didn\u2019t want to intrude on my chaplain, and he waited til I\ncame down. So we had two rabbis at my wedding, one rabbis wife, woman from my\nhometown and knew the family. I didn\u2019t know her then, but [indecipherable] little boy.\nAnd so they knew about my family. So Rabbi Vidall remain a rabbi for 25 years in the\narmy, and she settled out in California. So, I had a nice wedding, and then I invited the\nsame people that were initially in the group, for dinner in a -- a restaurant in Heidelberg.\nSo, I was lucky. [indecipherable]",
        "A: After I got married, everything was finished -- finished ralb. I didn\u2019t know this, but\nthey had considered me, before I got married, to be assigned as a liaison officer to the\nGerman CIA, as a army liaison officer, US Army, because I spoke German fluently, and\nthey require that. In the meantime I got married, and they said -- the Germans said, \u201cIf\nhe\u2019s married, the officer, his wife must be an American, but to also speak German\nfluently.\u201d Well, I -- I just happened to fit the bill, and the -- in the first one I was not\n148\nmarried, and then I was married, too. So when I then got called in and was told I get the\njob, and my wife was cleared, and our general G2, he\u2019s the chief Intelligence officer of\nthe command for Europe, he called me in and said, \u201cWell now, you are on the way to\noccupy a very important job. We picked you because we feel you fit the bill, but I know\nyour background, concentration camps. You do not go there to find out who the Nazis\nare. You find -- you go there because you have a job to do for the United States. I can\nunderstand if you have any feelings, you find Nazis in there. We know that, but your job\nis not to uncover them, your job is to see that we get all the report that we\u2019re supposed to\nget, that the people that we interview, and so on, that they\u2019re not -- they don\u2019t keep the\ninformation from us.\u201d Former Nazis, or whatever. \u201cBut not for -- because of what\nhappened to you, that you are getting revenge.\u201d I said, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about it.\nI know what job I have to do. But, I will not associate socially with the guys I know who\npreviously had been big Nazis to all of a sudden cater to us, and,\u201d -- \u201cThat\u2019s okay,\u201d he\nsaid, \u201cbut like I said, you\u2019re not going there to stir up trouble in the German agency.\u201d\nThey all had ph-phony names, and there were war criminals who were hired after the\nwar, but soon gotten rid of later, but they came in there. So I went to the agency, and\neverything wound up very well, til one day -- they had three liaison officers like myself,\nBritish, French, and ger -- and -- and American, with the German agency, and everything\nwent on fine, and -- til one day the French liaison officer asked for a meeting with me\noutside the agency where we were working, to have lunch someplace in the countryside.\nAnd he wants to talk to me about something very seriously, that he felt that I understand\n149\nmore than anybody else, about Nazis and the German CIA, specifically one man, who\nwas an SS officer, and Gestapo member, and you know, had committed a war crime in\nCzechoslovakia, who was working with us, but who is working really against us, because\nhe is one who will not give us all the reports, who looks down on us, who probably still a\nNazi, and who -- who really doesn\u2019t cooperate with us. \u201cIf he had cooperated, I probably\nwouldn\u2019t have said a thing,\u201d he said, \u201cbut here\u2019s his file,\u201d and he gave me a file about two\ninches thick, in a briefcase, and he say, \u201cTake it back with you, look it over yourself, and\nwe, the French government, want this guy out of this job. And since he\u2019s in the American\noccupation zone,\u201d wh-where we were located, \u201cI feel I should go to the American liaison\nofficer, and have him take care of it.\u201d And I just -- with a smile he said, \u201cI know, because\nof your background, you\u2019ll do something about it.\u201d I said, \u201cWell, frankly, you\u2019re right,\nbut my general told me that I\u2019m not here to find out who the Nazis are, who the war\ncriminals are. You know what my job is, same as yours. But I know we,\u201d -- somebody\nlike this, who was sentenced to death twice, in absentia, in Czechoslovakia. After the\nwar, they couldn\u2019t find him. They knew him as a worker -- they knew he was alive\nsomewhere, because he had submerged in a German agency under a different name. So\nthe French officer, \u201cHere\u2019s the file, Eddie, take it home with you. If your general decides\nto do nothing about it, we will do something about it. But Pll leave it to your judgment.\u201d\nSo he said -- I said, \u201cWhat will you do if my people say no, they don\u2019t want any part of\nthat? Like I said, the general told me, I\u2019m not there to find out the SS or the Gestapo\nman.\u201d He said, \u201cVery simple,\u201d he said, \u201cand please convey this to your general. We will\n150\ngive it to the local newspapers, we will make public that in a new -- in the west German\ngovernment, in the newly created Central Intelligence Agency of West Germany, you\nhave a guy who was condemned to death by the Czechs, and you employ him. Not very\ngood for the German -- the new west German government.\u201d I said, \u201cGood.\u201d I said, \u201cIll\ntake care of it. I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll have to go newspapers, but I don\u2019t know, but I cannot\npromise.\u201d I took it to Heidelberg. Right away I ask for -- I get into the general\u2019s office,\nsometimes very difficult. I said, \u201cI have something of utmost importance.\u201d Okay, I was\nlet in. I said, \u201cGeneral, I remember what you told me, my job is not to find out who the\nNazis are, but I found something worse, I found a war criminal in our midst, who is also\nprobably against us, Americans, and I did not go after him. Here\u2019s what happened, the\nFrench asked me to speak to them, and gave me a file for you to look over, and make a\ndecision. We hoping to get him out.\u201d And that actually took place. He said, \u201cOkay.\u201d He\nhad no problem with that, that I was just passing it on. I said, \u201cFrankly, I -- I -- I read the\nwhole file, and the man, on a high level, he was retired early -- they said retired, but I\nthink he was transferred to another place, under another name.\u201d But that\u2019s all I could do,\nbut I did something where I could do. The director general of the agency where I was,\none time told a young officer, a naval officer West Germany [indecipherable] was\nworking temporarily. He didn\u2019t know I was in a concentration camp when I got to his\nagency, but one day I was -- 1t was very hot in the office, I took my jacket off, I had a\nshort sleeve shirt on, and somebody saw the number on my arm. Apparently he knew\nright away what that was, and the word got around to the director that -- that the\n151\nAmerican liaison officer probably was in concentration camp. And he never talked to me\nabout it, the boss there, but the naval officer, a young guy, who was not [indecipherable]\nyoung guy, after the war, he became a naval officer, the guy was about 30 years old,\nmarried. He in -- I invited him -- he invited me to his home first for dinner one time with\nmy wife, and I invite him to my house. And we didn\u2019t talk about business, because I\nfigured that was improper, that they probably think I\u2019m going to li -- hear him out, see\nwhat he knows about them, and digging up things that they didn\u2019t want us to know. And\nafter the social visit, the two social visits, he came to my office. He said he\u2019d been told by\nthe director not to soci -- socially associate with me. They were afraid I was going to find\nout there were a lot -- a lot of the guys in there who -- so that\u2019s the story about that I was\n152\nBeginning of Tape Seven, Side A",
        "A: On the introduction, it\u2019s very short, I served for 21 years, selected by the city council\nas a member of the public safety and human relations advisory commission. A normal\nassignment is three years, or two years, we had extended, and I\u2019ve been re-selected by --\nby the city government, which of -- whi -- there are seven councilors, and -- plus the\nmayor. And at city council meetings, people get sworn in for various long term job. And I\nhad volunteered for 21 years, to be a member, and also a chairman of the public safety\ncommission, which we -- we used to be called the law enforcement commission, which\nhas overview the police, the fire department, and the ambulances, yeah. But my interest\nwas the police, because I served as criminal investigator, and I felt I had something to\noffer, maybe advice, and also because the name was added to public safety commission,\nprob -- human relations commission, which I\u2019m very much interested in. And which --\nand there were cases to cover, and discuss in the -- first in our commission meeting, then\nbrought up to the city council, and so withot -- and I resigned, like I said, because of my\nphysical disabilities, and I felt I had served enough. And of course this volunteering, and\nwithout pay, and took up a lot of my time, and I was physically [indecipherable], I\nthought I -- and all felt I should resign, and I had served long enough, longer than\n153\nanybody ever served before [indecipherable] on any commission. And I was the first one\nwith the police who were -- also [indecipherable], who was named with a badge by the\npolice as a honorary chief of police of Falls Church, and which was very nice, and the\ncity of Falls Church [indecipherable] 50 years, then we became independent from the\ncounty. So this was first time they assigned anybody, and gave him a badge of po -- poli -\n- police chief.",
        "A: And without further ado -- and -- and what I like to mention 1s that when my son, my\nyoungest son was still living at home, was studying at Georgetown, and become a foreign\naffairs officer in the State Department eventually, that he thought he also should do\nsomething for the city. He still lives at home, and the other children are married, of\ncourse, but he\u2019s volunteered then, that after I resign, or asked not to be reconsidered for\nthis job, he came to me [indecipherable] and said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t I go in your place, and also\ndo something for the city?\u201d I said, \u201cIt\u2019s fine with me, 1f you have time to do this, you\nhave to study a lot, but they have meetings at night, but maybe you can handle that.\u201d He\napplied, and there were four or five people applying for two jobs, two of them, there were\nseven -- there seven commissioners, and two p-place for [indecipherable] and another. So\nhe got selected [indecipherable] by it\u2019s usually three -- three city councilors, who review,\nyour -- why -- your -- your knowledge, to a we -- whether or not you could add anything\nto this. And I -- I didn\u2019t think he had too much to offer, but he\u2019s young, and he can ler --\nhe heard a lot from me what goes on in the city, and the problems, so he is somewhat\n154\nfamiliar. And he did get selected, and then the day came when he was going to be sworn\nin, in the front of the city council, and the cit -- in the city hall, publicly, and\n[indecipherable] people were there. Well, it was a regular city council meeting, not -- not\nfor him to be just s-sworn in, was part of it, [indecipherable] many things going on, and\nthe part that deals with his swearing 1n is on tape, and the mayor made an announcement,\nand since we were there to watch him, the mayor recognized us, and asked us if we want\nto stand with him while he\u2019s being sworn in. And we went up the podium, and we\nthought that was it, the oath of office, and then the mayor started talking about the\nWillner family, and first of all it was the father, it was son is really taking his place, and\nthen the mother [indecipherable] family, and this was completely unexpected by me or\nmy wife, or my son. We thought we just going there to watch him being sworn in, in a\npublic meeting. And -- and what you see here, you can also hear, you don\u2019t have to see\nthe picture. This a time they walk up to the podium, and he 1s sworn in, and the rest of\nthem you will hear.\n155\n-- people from the neighborhood, thank you very much, and we\u2019ll be working on this\nitem. Appreciate that you brought it to our attention. Now, we\u2019ll first call for an\nadministration of the oath of office to Jackie Druzinsky.",

And it\u2019s an important commission, it\u2019s\nimportant work. It\u2019s probably, in addition to education, the most important function that\nour government performs.

        "Answer: We were married in Germany, in Heidelberg, which 1s a famous place for\ngetting married, but I was stationed there with the headquarters US Army. And we\nmarried on the 21\u201c of August, 1958.",

        "A: I don\u2019t remember exactly, but I can -- probably 1951, because I went to officer\u2019s\nschool after I became a citizen, I couldn\u2019t go before. And that was in *52. I graduated in\nAugust *52. So it must have been in *51 or \u201950. Of -- maybe \u201950.",
        "A: Yes, it was a very significant moment that I wa -- became a citizen not 1n a big\nceremony, I -- I was the only one, and it was an American female judge, and she was\ntrying to be funny. I was in uniform, I was a sergeant of the US Army, and she\u2019s asked\nme three questions before becoming a citizen. Lift up your right hand, and answer my\nquestions, that you tell me the truth, and nothing but, and so on. So she said, \u201c\u201cWho\u2019s\nUncle Sam?\u201d I said, \u201cI work for him.\u201d Okay, that was [indecipherable]. Then she asked\nme for other questions I\u2019m willing to pay tax in this country. Yes. And the third question\nI don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t remember.\n158\nstationed in Japan, did you see any evidence, or did you feel any of that -- 0-of the\nJapanese being the United States former enemies? Did a-any of that enter into your\nexperiences?",
        "A: No, because the Japanese way of life -- we were looking as the people, the conqueror,\nthe people who are better maybe, we won the war. And they\u2019re very submissive, the\nJapanese, when they don\u2019t win. And they become prisoners, and -- so I -- I didn\u2019t have\nany problem with that, or -- I don\u2019t know if anybody else had, after MacArthur, who most\npeople feel had the right type of occupation in Japan, for Japan. In Germany it wouldn\u2019t\nhave worked that way, had a different type of occupation. But in Japan, the Japanese\nbecame very pro-American right away, because the policies MacArthur -- and the\ndemocracy, which introduced into ja -- Japan right away, and they fell right in line. And\nthey changed over very quickly, whereas in Germany, I feel, they didn\u2019t change over so\nquickly, if they change over at all. Compared to the Nazis, I think there is no comparison,\nexcept the Japanese themself, compare themself during the war to the Germans. They\ncalled themself Germans of the Far East. But they didn\u2019t do all the things the Germans\ndid. So -- and after the war, they also felt that had something in common with the\nGermans. They lost the war, both of them. So the big thing that I can state, the difference,\nwhen my wife and I took a taxi in Tokyo, and we spoke in English, there was a distance\nbetween the taxi driver and us. This was in 1950 -- after Korean war, in 1958 - \u201959 - \u201960.\nAnd they were still repairing all things from the bombardment. And the Japanese tax1\ndrivers, for instance, if we talk German in the back of the cab, he will listen, he will say\n159\nafter awhile, \u201cWhat nationality are you?\u201d And I had this thing, I was an amer -- an\nAmerican, of course, but they respected the Germans, even though they both -- because\nlike I said, they felt they had something in common, they also lost the war together. They\nfelt they were very hard working people, clean, and also ruthless in war. So they called\nthemselves, rightfully so , the -- the Asians -- the Germans of the Far East.",
        "A: Well, they did no -- also, we didn\u2019t do what we did to the Germans. Prosecute people\nwho committed war crimes. They prosecuted some, but not -- they didn\u2019t have\nconcentration camps, although they killed a lot of Chinese, particularly. But they didn\u2019t\nhave concentration camps, they had POW camps, where they treat the people just as bad\nas in -- in a concentration camp. But on the whole, they did not -- as a matter of fact, they\ndid not have anything against Jews, Japanese. They let the Jews come into Shanghai,\n5,000 of them re -- and a girl that was in my class in Germany went to -- to Shanghai, and\nI met her later in Florida, so I know how they were treated. But Japan was, for most Jews,\na -- acountry to wait til the war ended, or a place to go through to some other place. But\nthey didn\u2019t bother Jews.",
        "A: Did the Americans were anti-Japanese, or the Japanese anti-American?",
        "A: Not very much, no. Because the Japanese very friendly, very nice, and I must say my\n160\nown job, which was in military Intelligence, and we were not in uniform, we were\ndocumented civilian. I was commanding officer of a small unit. They -- they -- we had no\nproblem whatsoever, and when they found out that I had been in a concentration camp,\nthat interests them, but they ca -- always came out with the same thing, \u201cWhat about the\natomic bomb?\u201d That we [indecipherable]. To them I was not a German Jew, I was an\nAmerican civilian, and they felt very bad about us dropping atomic bomb there. I didn\u2019t\nfeel so bad about it, and I had problems with them -- with Japanese. They took me once\nto Hiroshima, to the famous museum, just like the Holocaust museum here, and in the\nmuseum were life size pictures of what looked like right after the bombing. And you saw\npeople there burned. People like you c-could see in the Holocaust museums. And they\ntook me through this museum for about two hours, and I was the only American, there\nwas three Japanese, they all spoke English. And after two hours, it was about lunchtime,\none of the Japanese said to me, \u201cMr. Willner, where we going to eat lunch?\u201d \u201cOh,\u201d I said,\n\u201cany -- any Japanese restaurant will do, it doesn\u2019t make any difference.\u201d And he said to\nme, \u201cMr. Willner, you can eat lunch now, after seeing this?\u201d And I said, \u201cYes. I\u2019ve seen\nstuff like this before, not from one bomb, but from many bombs. I\u2019ve seen people dead\nfrom bombings. I\u2019ve seen -- I\u2019ve seen thousands, probably. And where I worked in a\nGerman synthetic [indecipherable] factory, it was bombed by amer -- by the Americans,\nbut not by one bomb, but by hundred or 200 bombers at one time. And s -- and even one\ncity in Germany, city of Draisin, was bombed by the British, and during one bombing\nraid more people were killed than by one bomb here in Hiroshima. Most people don\u2019t\n161\nknow this.\u201d So -- well, they got to be a little funny about this, they just [indecipherable].\nThey wanted me to feel sorry for that. And I couldn\u2019t feel sorry for them, because they\ncontinued the war, they were warned, and the only thing that stopped our conversation,\nthere was dead silence, was one man\u2019s name was Mr. Maneeshi, and he was the only\nJapanese I disliked in my six years in Japan, because he was doing certain things that I\ndisapproved of. He also lied, which is accepted in Japan, because if you don\u2019t know the\nanswer to something, you make it up. But Mr. Maneeshi, I said to him -- after he said\nabout you can eat lunch now after seeing this, I said yes. And there was silence, and I\nsaid, \u201cBy the way, did you ever hear of Pearl Harbor?\u201d And then there was dead silence,\nand then we went to lunch. Not one more word was said about the atomic bomb, or Pearl\nHarbor.",
        "A: I spent six years in Japan. I went two -- two tours in Japan. After the Korean war,\nwhen the Korean war was over, I was sent with my unit to Japan, and we stayed nine\nmonths. So I was as a bachelor the first time. The second time I went to Japan, I went\nvoluntarily, the army asked me, I didn\u2019t have to go. And if I could take my family, I said\nyes. They said yes. And three of my children are born in Japan, three out of the six. And\none of them has a Japanese name. I had very good friends, and we still have Japanese\nvisiting us here. I ca -- became a friend of a general, whose daughter learned cooking our\nhouse, German cooking, Jewish cooking, American cooking, and her daughter, the Ph.D.,\nnot married, still lives now in United States, comes here all the time, and she lives in\n162\nPennsylvania, and the mother is about -- that\u2019s the daughter of the general, she is teaching\nEnglish, she speaks fluent English.

Because I came here with\n10 dollars in my pocket. I didn\u2019t have a job, although somebody I met in Europe said,\ncome and see me sometimes. But a lot of people said come and see me sometime. But he\ndid give me a job. And I was told that because I signed what I think are called first\npapers, at that time [indecipherable] were the papers that you want to become a citizen.\nYou apply for it, and you -- your -- your sponsor. I was completely separate from him, he\n-- he was just a guy that lends his name to my -- [indecipherable] that my papers will\ncome over. That\u2019s all. Once I was here --",
        "A: Not very emotional, but it was something that I had to see, that I was very happy\nabout, even though I didn\u2019t know what to expect. A lot of my friends went to Israel, and I\nhad no intention of going, I mentioned it before, and --\n163",

I\nthink it was about a hundred or a hundred and 10 dollars to come over. And to my name I\nhad another 10 dollars. So I came over. And I was told that I would maybe be -- I might\nbe drafted, because the draft didn\u2019t stop right after World War two, so they were still\ndrafting people, and s-sign papers to become an American citizen, there\u2019s -- they had a\ngood chance, that I was healthy, and so on.",
        "A: Did I what?",
        "A: No, unfortunately not. There was a -- it was -- everybody was all inside, and we didn\u2019t\n-- you didn\u2019t see the Statue of Liberty, because there was a lot of fog up there.",

In\nthis case, they approved of me in every way. I had no problems with my in-laws, and on\nmy side there was nobody left. So with my wife, particularly, I found somebody that not\nonly felt deeply with me, she -- although she had no experience of her own, but she did\nhave experiences between democracy and Communism, because she lived in East\nGermany, and not very far from where I escaped, and she left also, illegally, East\nGermany for West Germany. Her father was a teacher, and he decided on the -- well,\neven before Communism, under the Prussian rulers, that all his children are going to be\nschool teachers. And my wife was not willing -- she was not willing to become a school\nteacher, and be taught where to taught, and what to teach. She also wanted to become a\nteacher. So she left when there was still time, and crossed the border illegally. There was\nno war up here in Berlin, that was early in the game. And it was very interesting, her\ntown, and her territory was about -- was Russian occupied for -- no, I\u2019m sorry, was a --\nAmerican occupied, but first the Nazis were there, then the American troops owa, and\nthen Eisenhower signed some papers where the demarcation line on the border would be,\nand the part that she was in was turned over to the Russians. So the Americans went in\nfirst, occupied it, and then turn over to the Ru -- so she didn\u2019t like 1t under Communism\nbecause of the teaching experience, and she left for Heidelberg. Now, in Germany at that\ntime, there was lack of worker people, and she could only stay if you came from the east,\nif you found a job. So she found a job on a farm. When she had money -- when she had\n165\n[indecipherable]. Michael? Must be my wife. I thought my son was there.\n[indecipherable]. So she left for Heidelberg, got herself a job -- oh, she\u2019s going\nsomeplace. I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t know it. She worked, and she studied. When I met her, she\ndidn\u2019t work on a farm any more, she knew enough English, and she attend the Heidelberg\nUniversity\u2019s English Institute, where they taught English, proper English. So her English\nwas very good, and she wound up at a job in the American headquarters where I was\nworking in Heidelberg. And she worked as a clerk, and then when she had enough\nmoney, she went back to the university. So when I met her, she was working of course,\nbeca -- and we dated.",
        "A: [indecipherable] that is very interesting, your question. And also the way it went. At\nfirst I appeared to her in American officer\u2019s uniform. And nobody expected me to have\nbeen in concentration camp. As a matter of fact, only one time I was called in front of a\ngeneral in Heidelberg, they plate -- and they were doing a parade, when some German\ngenerals came to visit the American headquarters, all the officers and staff, on the\ngeneral\u2019s staff, had to be outside, and watch the parade, and when the American flag\ncame by, and we had to salute. And when the German flag came by, we had to salute.\nThat was no problem for me, but when they played the German national anthem, I\u2019m\nsorry to say the German national anthem today, is not the same words that -- that exist\nunder Hitler, but the melody is the same, and I could not salute while they were playing\n166\nthe German national anthem, because in the concentration camp one time, I witnessed a --\nhang a couple of people, and they played the German national anthem. So there was a\nphoto taken of the officers saluting, and someone said, \u201cHow come Willner is not\nsaluting?\u201d And some officer said, \u201cOh, you\u2019ll have to excuse him. He knows why he\u2019s\nnot going to salute.\u201d He knew the reason. Well, the final outcome, I was called to the\ngeneral\u2019s office, and he said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to dress you down. You were supposed to\nsalute like everybody else, but next time -- I know your background, we not holding\nagainst you. I can feel your feelings. Just don\u2019t show up. We have to do this, whether we\nlike it or not, and I don\u2019t feel -- to make you do it would not be the right thing.\u201d So we\ngot some very good understanding there. Far as my wife is concerned, it\u2019s a lot of long\nstory. She didn\u2019t know my background, and I actually met her in Heidelberg, there was a\ntrial of an SS.",
        "A: So we know that. After that, I think that the question of Nazism, and anti-Semitism --\nin -- where she lived, she didn\u2019t know any Jews, so they couldn\u2019t -- would not say\nanything about that, but my wife is today more Jewish than I am. I coo --",
        "A: About three months after I met her. And we met probably, on most evenings after\nwork. And that means [indecipherable] three months I wanted to marry her, because of\nthis -- that she didn\u2019t know who I was, or ba -- and I questioned her, what she thought\n167\nabout all these things that happened during the war. And every one was very satisfactory\nto me. And they were not made up by some -- as some people did that liked to tell you\nwhat you like to hear.",
        "A: No. They were told when I -- when they going to Jewish Sunday school at Fort\nBelbar, which is a military Jewish Sunday school [indecipherable] was a rabbi, and a\nmilitary chaplain. And some that were Orthodox, sometime Reformed. They went 10\nyears, each one of them to Fort Belbar, which is near Washington. So each one of our\nchildren had 10 years of Jewish education, but somewhere during that time, when they\nwere old enough -- not when they were six years old, or five years old, I told them about\nthe Holocaust, and my background. And so they all found out, I would say, n -- in the\nrange of seven, eight years, or nine years, and more and more I told them all what they\nwanted to know, and they always questioned, and I gave some talks in the Sunday school,\nwhich they also listened to. But they were fully aware of my background, and their\nmother\u2019s background, and the fact that my children would not believe, when Bar Mitzvah\ntime came along that the Orthodox rabbi would not recognize them as being Jewish,\nbecause the mother was not Jewish. I explained that. And they could not believe it. They\nbelieved the Holocaust, but they could not believe that the mother was not Jewish, and --\nbecause she went with -- with us to the synagogue. She knows how to read Hebrew. As a\n168\nmatter of fact, she knew more than the average Jewish wife, which was not at my request,\nshe did on her own.",
        "A: No, I did that. I did all that, because I was a f-first witness to this, she was not, and she\n-- she knew about concentration camps, she had heard about it, that\u2019s about all. Like most\nGermans had, my age or older. I cannot accept, for instance, that the Germans tell to me,\nsomebody my age or older, that they didn -- he didn\u2019t know there was such thing as\nconcentration camp. Because they themselves were afraid of going to concentration\ncamps. It wasn\u2019t just Jews that were in there. And as far as my wife 1s concerned, before\nshe met me, she knew about concentration camps from reading the newspaper, not from\n[indecipherable]. I was the first one she met that was there.",
        "A: Right. And to some extent, some of those teachers in school [indecipherable] in\nschool, but they didn\u2019t give a good account of it, because they only told them what\n[indecipherable] was. So my -- my children, all of them, have a very deep understanding\nof the Holocaust by now of course, they\u2019re much, much older. As a matter of fact, I don\u2019t\nknow if I mentioned this before, but my oldest son, who 1s a lieutenant colonel, and who -\n- it\u2019s something I didn\u2019t mention at that time, because it didn\u2019t exist, he is now a\nprofessor at West Point, teaching young cadets. And I\u2019m sure he talks about the\n169\nHolocaust too, because he -- that\u2019s not his main subject, his main subject\u2019s for\ninternational relations, foreign affairs, and politics. And he\u2019s very mach -- much aware of\nthe Holocaust, all his children are, and he has marched, in the deep winter, for 14 days,\nall by himself, the same march that we called the Death March, from Blechhammer to\nGross-Rosen. He marched that. That\u2019s the one that\u2019s at West Point. I am glad to have\nsomebody like him up there. If he is going to be asked any question, he knows all the\nanswer.",
        "A: Albert Willner. And I have some more information I want to tell you about him,\nbecause I\u2019m real proud of him. I -- in a way, not -- not more proud than the other\nchildren, because the others didn\u2019t have the chance to do what he did, and Albert, I like to\nmaybe elaborate a little bit later about Albert and his past, not just about the\nconcentration camp, but how he fared in the military so far. And he just moved from\nWashington a couple of mo -- two months ago, to West Point.",
        "A: Yes, I worked for the federal government for another 20 years -- 20 years in the army,\nand you have a possibility when you -- you get your 20 years credit, then you go into\ncivil serv -- or you take separate [indecipherable] for 20 years in the army. I decided to f -\n- retire from the army, go into the reserves, and -- which I did, and then -- then working\n170\nfor -- in federal civil service for another 20 years. I applied, I took a test, what they call a\nmid-level test to place you someplace. It was a 10 hour test, plus the fact that I was an\nofficer in the army, they give you extra point per the -- the schools you went to.

That\u2019s open information,\nnewspaper. So people who saw me in the morning, sitting at my desk, reading newspaper\nfor two hours, they always felt I had the best job in there. How can he get away with this?\nHe doesn\u2019t do any work, he\u2019s reading the paper. That was part of my job. It\u2019s very\n17]\ninteresting, I had some very interesting people I worked for, and part of this work, I must\n-- to be frank about it, I think [indecipherable] part of this was paid for by the CIA. And\nthere was what you call contract work. So the Bureau of the Census has this section I was\nin, ISPC, which was not a -- not a CIA organization, but like I said, there are statisticians\nthere, and people -- demographers, and people who are very familiar with international\ncommerce.

And I pushed the\nstatistician out of his job [indecipherable] riff procedures, who knew all about it, and then\nhad to work under me, at one grade less, and was a terrible situation. I tried to get out of\n172\nit, you know, the poor guy, he knew I was not at fault, but people were understanding.\nAfter two years my big boss said he didn\u2019t want me to leave the civil service with a bitter\ntaste in my mouth.

I -- I don\u2019t like to see foods wasted, and one time\nin the army, when I was a lieutenant, the mess officer got sick, he had to go in the\nhospital for a week, and some superior officer came to me, and said for -- he wanted me\nto fill in for one week til this guy gets back on, as a mess officer. And this was a huge\nmess hall cona -- called a consolidated mess hall at Camp Killmer, New Jersey. And it\nfed about 2,000 men, so it\u2019s a real big operation. And I saw the food that was being\nwasted there. So I hung up some big signs, take all you want, eat all you take. In other\nwords, you didn\u2019t have to take the food they were giving you on your plate, they went\nthrough the line. And it didn\u2019t work, so the guys were still -- I told the cooks, \u201cDon\u2019t put\nso much on their plates, they can\u2019t eat what you put.\u201d And if -- so some of them paid\n[indecipherable].

        "A: Well, because some people were still hungry in this world. Not because I saw people\nhungry only, but there were still many countries -- even in our country. I arranged one\ntime here in Washington, at the officer\u2019s club at Fort Meyer, to send some food that was\nleftover to the old people\u2019s home. You don\u2019t say old people\u2019s home any more, but senior\ncitizens, or whatever. So we can all just do something about it. In the army it was just\nwell, when I asked for some leftover for my dogs, they packed up a whole roast for my\n175\ndog. Well, I -- I said, that whole roast could be -- there are no meals at night, people who\nwork night shift, they don\u2019t get fed, the mess hall is closed, only in the day is open. You\ncan cut up some sandwiches for them, and help themselves. And you have some leftovers\nspoil, then you can throw it away. But they had refrigerators, and just everything was\nthere. But anyway, it bothered me because I saw so many people hungry in the war, and I\nwas hungry. And the final outcome was that after trying everything else, I stood at the\nend of the line when they cleaning their plates. They just shove their leftovers into a big\nvat, and then put into a machine, and machine cleans their tray. I made guys go back who\nhad too much food on their plate, I made them go back to the table and eat.

This is -- this -- this one of the freedoms we\nhave, they can take it or leave it, like many other things. And besides, we have so much\nfood, we\u2019re not hungry.

There were a couple of people from maybe some -- Montana or\n176\npl -- some out of the way place, who didn\u2019t have all this nice, solid food, who ate poorly\nat home, who didn\u2019t have much money. They had a little understanding for this. They\nwere more appreciative. But if you were -- if you are never hungry in your life, you\nalways had plenty of food.",

I said, \u201cOh you -- I\n179\ndidn\u2019t have that problem,\u201d maybe cause I he -- where I came from, but that wasn\u2019t\nbecause he liked Jews that much, maybe [indecipherable] a boy, and I grew up very strict,\nmy father disciplined, and when he came I stood at attention.

My oldest son -- my father had\nan iron cross which he won during World War one, in the German army, and I gave that\nto my oldest son because he\u2019s an army officer, but besides that, he has stuff -- things\nhanging in his office that -- has his grandfather iron cross, and some other stories about\nhim. One particular story is not about him, but is about me, a one page thing. And it\u2019s\nwritten up by the federal government here, and it\u2019s a very short story, but it tells my\nstory. And I don\u2019t want to go into big story, but he has that framed 1n his office. And he\nwas, for awhile, the commanding officer of a heli -- attack helicopter p -- unit. Cobra\n182\nattack helicopters, before he went to the teaching business. That\u2019s what a young officer\nhas to do something to get ahead maybe, and he wanted to be combat officer. And he had\nyoung pilots come into his office, they had problems with their nerves, they were shaky\nafter certain flights. Not combat flight, but helicopter not working properly, being up in\nthe air, trying to get down, save your life. And jumping out of a helicopter, and five\nseconds later it was on fire. So these guys had problems dealing with this. And most\npeople who go into this know that, that that might come up. Well, I\u2019m sure my son had\nproblems, but he doesn\u2019t let it get ahold of him too much.

And so I used to wake up in a sweat, thinking about it, but because I got so busy with\nmy children, all kind of activities, I started slowly getting away from the dreams. And at\nthis time, the dreams were, let\u2019s say about 10 - 20 years ago, about three times a week, on\nthe average. Dreaming about camps, sometimes even more. I dream now once or twice a\nmonth, and not so bad, because I had, two months ago hallucinations, but not about the\ncamps, that\u2019s because of Parkinson\u2019s. And they giving me too much medication, and I\nwas losing some weight, and I was overdose. So I two nights -- one time, one night was\nthe -- I had to go with ambulance, but that turned out to be nothing serious, except that\nthey reduce [indecipherable] medication. So, coming back to the camps, I got used to it\nafter awhile, but I lost a lot of sleep over it, but I wake up, and then -- but the main thing\nthat happened, getting away from there is my wife, keep me busy, doing a lot of things\nfor me, and our children. My wife knowingly why she was doing this, and I didn\u2019t want\nto involve my children, getting something for the -- they -- I -- I also keep away from\nthem, and I want them to keep away from me things. If I have something bad happens for\nthe day, something\u2019s -- maybe, let\u2019s say something -- something which says something\nabout being a Jew, or -- or being anti-Semitic, that would hurt me. But it depends who it\ncomes from. If it\u2019s from a private citizen, I don\u2019t give a damn, frankly. He can go and I --\nPll be very blunt, and I -- and if it\u2019s somebody intelligent, who is maybe my boss, or\nsomebody higher up, or in the papers, I get upset about it. So my children come across\nsomething like that, they want to tell me about it, they know not to tell me that evening\n184\nthey come home, or when they used to come home. Next morning, that\u2019s okay. I don\u2019t\nwant to hear anything bad in the evening, same thing for my wife. If she got a phone call,\nI was supposed to see somebody next day for a new job, or for something important, an\ninvestment, or something like that, I am -- wa -- she wouldn\u2019t know -- don\u2019t -- if it\u2019s good\nnews, you can tell me, if it\u2019s bad news, you keep it to yourself, tell it to me morning at\nbreakfast time. And it worked pretty well. Because you tell me in the evening something\nbad, I can\u2019t sleep. It\u2019s unfortunate, but it doesn\u2019t have to be about anti-Sem -- it could be\nabout anything, any bad news.",
        "A: No. I -- I tell you why. I\u2019m trying to think why I\u2019m saying this. I do occasionally, in a\nfree moment, think about the [indecipherable] that\u2019s the way it was, or the way it went.\nIt\u2019s because my children, they keep me so busy, with all their good news all the time, that\nI can\u2019t think only bad news. That\u2019s really a fact. And really the pleasure, they grew into\nthis. My youngest son, who 1s back to school now, he comes back home, he usually has\ngood news in the evening, had a good day. If it\u2019s a bad day, he won\u2019t say anything about\nit [indecipherable].",
        "A: These were not painful times for me, no. You mean at this time, to think about it?\n185",
        "A: No. Not at all. I think it strengthened my children in many respects. I\u2019m\n[indecipherable], and it\u2019s not on purpose, but in -- in a way, it\u2019s my doing, they look up to\nme. | -- there are also some things in my life I haven\u2019t told them. Little things, no -- not\nvery important things, not about concentration camp. Little thing that happened, and I\ndon\u2019t bother them maybe an -- an older age. For instance, one of my sons, I hit him a\ncouple of times, just with my hand, I never hit him with a stick or a belt, or anything like\nthat. And if they did something that I punished one, and I punished the wrong one,\nanother guy did it. I would never hesitate go to my children, even 11 years old or\nsomething, and say, \u201cI'm sorry I hit you, and you didn\u2019t do it, or you did it, but I -- I still -\n- | didn\u2019t want to hit you in the spur of the moment, I did. I apologize for it.\u201d And I never\nthought myself too big to do that. And I think the children appreciated it, too.",
        "A: No, not because other people didn\u2019t have to, but my wife tells me -- matter of fact,\nwe\u2019 ve talked about this morning, I\u2019m somewhat still angry, in -- in my background, in my\ndeeper -- inner -- inner -- in the -- I don\u2019t know how to word this. There\u2019s some things in\nlife that made me angry, and other people do, probably because of my co -- on prejudice,\nfor instance. Any kind of prejudice. And -- doesn\u2019t have to be anti-Semitism. I witnessed\n186\nsome prejudice in officer candidate school, Blacks, who were thrown out just because\ntheir color. Jews also, but you -- but you couldn\u2019t prove it.",
        "A: Well, I\u2019m still angry at some things that have -- not really related to the concentration\ncamp. I get angry at my wife at something, maybe, that went wrong. And I said, \u201cYou\nshould have known better.\u201d Has nothing to do with the concentration camp, but down\ndeep is -- it goes back to the concentration camp, where I didn\u2019t want to do anything\nwrong, because it will cost me my life, or a beating, something like that. So there\u2019s an\nanger there. So we had something come up, a -- something very normal, and I got angry\nabout it. And I know that\u2019s the type of anger that my wife objects to, because it\u2019s not -- I\ndon\u2019t have to be angry about it, but I am. It\u2019s not the -- anything earthshaking. Maybe not\nsomething [indecipherable], 1t may be just statement. May -- I don\u2019t want to be specific\nabout something, but my wife makes a statement about something, and she doesn\u2019t know\nmuch about it, maybe politics, or something, and then my son 1s disc -- discussing with\nher poli -- I\u2019m just listening. And I said, \u201cHow can you make such statement? You don\u2019t\neven know this guy, you don\u2019t know about this guy.\u201d And that\u2019s the anger that I get, that\nshe shouldn\u2019t say that because she doesn\u2019t know this. The same thing [indecipherable]\nmy children.\n187",
        "A: Like I said, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s something -- it\u2019s an anger that\u2019s still there from the camps.\nThat\u2019s why [indecipherable] Dutchman, and we made a hell of a life. We thought alike,\nvery much alike. But unfortunately I have to say in his case, it showed on the outside, not\non the inside, he beat his wife, I found out. She told me, and I -- I told him that he\nshouldn\u2019t do this, and he never gave me an answer yes or no. So he did had -- did have an\nanger, too.",
        "A: I lost part of my childhood, and what?",
        "A: No. I don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t think about that. That\u2019s true [indecipherable], I did. I lost a good\npart of my childhood. But I -- there -- best friends of my parents were German Jews who\nwere -- escaped to Israel, just before the war started, and the daughter of these best\nfriends of my parents, 1s -- the name of Inga Snitzler. She lived in vi -- in Vienna. The\nfirst [indecipherable] then they came here, after the parents died, she and her sister came\nhere. And I had a great childhood with her, because the parents were good friends.\nBabysitter babysat for both her and me, and when you went in -- we were invited to\nGermany one time, she came also with her husband -- unfortunately he died recently, and\nhe -- he didn\u2019t want to go to Germany, and I didn\u2019t want to either, I -- I was in Germany\nstationed, couple of years in the army, but the last trip was invited at the expense of the\nlike [indecipherable]. And frankly, if I had to do it again, I wouldn\u2019t do it, not because I\ndidn\u2019t get a good reception.\n188\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\n189\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "A: Well, first of all I really should talk about my wife, who came before the children. The\n-- not the extraordinary children, but the extraordinary wife, which I feel she is, and our\noldest son -- first of all, we have six boys and -- no, I\u2019m -- six children, three boys and\nthree girls, and they range from 30 to 40. So we had all of them within 10 years. And they\nall accomplished already something in their life. They all went to college. Some of them\nhave two degrees, some of them have Master\u2019s, and one of them has -- the one in the\narmy, the oldest one, has a Master\u2019s, and a Ph.D., and is now teaching at West Point.\nNow, Albert, that\u2019s Albert Willner, th -- 1s 40, but I really don\u2019t know where to start with\nhis extraordinary accomplishments, and unusual interests, as the oldest of our children,\nlike I said, three boys and three girls. But before I start bragging about him, I should start\nat the source of all these, my wonderful wife, Johanna, a German born Protestant, without\nconverting to Judaism, has been the most supportive in raising our children in the Jewish\nfaith. All of our children have had 10 years of Jewish education. As for myself, any\n[indecipherable] believe in God, no matter what religion, is fine. The most important\nthing is what\u2019s in your heart. Because of my past, and in memory of my parents, 28\nmembers of my family, and so many who had to die just because they were Jews, I would\nalways remain a Jew. In summary, after my life -- after the concentration camps, the best\n190\nrita gud machoum, if you understand what means. It means restitution. It\u2019s not really the\nright word. Was not much success, but the fact for the millions of people that perished, I\nwas able to make up for the losses, if only one to one million. Six million Jews -- some\npeople ask me jokingly if I\u2019m trying to make them all up again. So, all I could is six. And\nthe -- like I said, the summary of my life after the concentration camps, the best\n[indecipherable] good amount of restitution was not my success, but the fact that for the\nmillions of people that perished, I was able to make up some of the losses.\n[indecipherable]. My anger with God, and we talked about anger before, and this with\nGod, being the only survivor of the Willner family, out of 28, has changed to\nthankfulness, permitting me to forgive God, and not the other way around. I can truly say\nthat my mission in life has been accomplished, and I will be able to peacefully rest some\nday among some of my liberators at Arlington National Cemetery. I feel very strongly\nabout that. And that\u2019s past life. I can truly say that really, some of these men a-are known\nto me by name, but I know th-they died during World War two, that Arlington Cemetery,\nwho paid with their lives, so that others like myself might live. And every time I walk\nthrough Arlington, I know occasionally on some holiday, I put some flowers down, and\nsome [indecipherable] of World War two soldier, and my oldest son does the same thing,\nwe just go and [indecipherable] and we -- he was also married in the chapel\n[indecipherable] military by a non -- I forgot what they call it -- non-demonush -- demon\n-- denominational chaplain, army chaplain. I feel that America 1s blessed with many\nthings, and I think particularly -- I\u2019m particularly thankful for the freedoms of speech,\n19]\nwhich has been especially meaningful for me, the freedom of speech. I\u2019m not talking\nabout [indecipherable] but the most impressive thing that I still think about all the time, is\nfreedom of speech. I can say anything I want, and not have to worry, even when I had my\ngovernment job. I can say I don\u2019t like this president, and I don\u2019t have to worry about\nsomebody standing at my door, and arresting me. Well, now to Albert\u2019s military career.\nAlbert, the oldest one -- and by the way, my wife and I agreed before we got married, that\nwe would like to have probably four children, and soon, because we got married, both, at\nan old age. I was 32 almost, and she was 30. And religion was going to be no problem. I\nonly stated that I want my children to grow up with the Jewish religion, not because I\u2019m\nSO Ss -- going to the synagogue, keep all the things my faith asks of me, because my\nparents died as Jews. In their memory, and my wife agreed, I felt if I had met another\nwife, who said, \u201cWell I\u2019m a Protestant, or a Catholic, but I got to [indecipherable] my\nfaith,\u201d she would have become Jewish, I would have asked her to, but -- but I felt that\u2019s\nnot necessary, like I said before. What\u2019s in -- what\u2019s in your heart, that\u2019s what\u2019s\nimportant. In her case, I knew particularly what was -- so Albert was born in Germany,\nthen went to American schools, some overseas in Japan. And finally he went to college\nhere in the United States, and he got an ROTC schol -- ROTC scholar -- scholarship. And\nhe happened to come out as the number one man in his class, and the first man that the --\ntop man who gets the scholarship at that time -- not gets a scholarship, c-comes out on\ntop, the first guy in his class, is offered a regular army commission, which is you can\nbecome a professional army officer. And I told him to take it, if he didn\u2019t like it, he can\n192\nalways leave the army later. So I wasn\u2019t aff -- afforded that opportunity, I came out a\nharder way, through officer candidate school. I\u2019m sorry, I have to drink some water first.\nMy voice is going out. So, to make a real, real long story short, after I finish the ROTC,\nand he -- he majored in political science, and he went into the army, got a regular\ncommission, then became a paratrooper, became a ranger, studied Chinese for three\nyears, went to China for one year on an educational tour, just traveling around for one\nyear. Then became a -- what they call a foreign area officer, studies foreign areas, they\nmust know the language. And then he didn\u2019t think that he should be just a soldier at a\ndesk, he should be a combat soldier. And I must say also, frankly, that I feel what\nhappened in World War two, when Jews were not able to defend themselves, I didn\u2019t\nwant my children to be in a position -- you don\u2019t know when it\u2019s -- could happen. There\nare people who would -- don\u2019t like Jews, and I -- I think German Jews particularly have\nbeen criticized why they went to the places of killing, like sheep. Well, nobody had a\ngun. In Germany nobody owned a gun, my father didn\u2019t own one, although my uncle\nowned a saber, which he brought back from World War two, but -- so I was very\nparticular s -- I felt very strongly about getting a military education, in the same time\nserving your country, and seeing to it that we remain a democracy. And the army can be\nresponsible, to a certain extent, provided we have the right leaders. And Albert went in,\nand then, since he wanted to become a combat soldier, not sit down and some --\nsomebody telling him, oh you\u2019re just a desk officer, he went to attack helicopters, and he\nwas -- he was taught to fly Cobra attack helicopters, which were very successful during\n193\nseveral wars. And then he became commander of -- of -- of the unit. Then he got\npromoted to major, and then every officer who wants to stay in the army, ma-make the\ncareer today, must have a Master\u2019s degree in one field or another. So the army gave\nAlbert 18 months to go to the University of Virginia, and get a Master\u2019s degree within 18\nmonths. Well, again, to make a long story short, he finished his Master\u2019s degree in\nforeign relations in nine months instead of 18 months. So he -- one professor was\nChinese, one of his three professors that he got close to. He said, \u201cAlbert, you finished\n[indecipherable] what are you going to do now?\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d he said, \u201cgo back to the army.\nTake whatever job they give me.\u201d \u201cWell,\u201d he said, \u201cyou are Ph.D. material, you know\nthat. So,\u201d he said, \u201cwhy don\u2019t you stay on and we\u2019ll be your sponsors.\u201d But he had to\nmake request to the army, and the army said -- no, first the professor wrote the army. We\nhave a young officer here, who finished 1n a -- 1n eight -- in -- in nine months, when most\npeople have 18 months to finish it. Can he stay here and go on to a Ph.D.? Well nobody\ncan finish a Ph.D. in nine months, they knew that. So he was told then, if he studies on\nhis own afterwards, they\u2019Il let him stay another nine months. So he stayed another nine\nmonths at UVA, and he didn\u2019t finish of course, but he studied very hard. He was married\nalready at that time, and his family left him alone at night when he was studying. Well,\nmake a -- he finished his Ph.D. in three years, and then the army send him to China, like I\nsaid, and then he went again into hel-helicopters, and when he finished that job, he\nneeded a job th -- for further promotion, he got that in Germany for three years, and his --\nthen the next assignment was in Washington, the Pentagon. He was the war plants officer\n194\nfor the Far East. In other words, he was responsible for the planning if there was any\nattack in the Far East, in Japan, Korea, China. That was the area of responsibility. And\nhe\u2019s now a lieutenant colonel, and two years ago he was interviewed for teaching at West\nPoint. And it\u2019s very difficult to get a professorship there, and there are two ways. You\ncan stay just for two years, on a regular assign -- or you can be -- ask to make it rest of\nyour career. If you do, you get a further promotion, you\u2019re assured to leave the army as a\none star general. And so he went to West Point. He loves it, his wife loves it. They are\nliving one block from the river, and his teaching is very nice, he likes it, he enjoy -- he\nalways wanted to teach. And I\u2019m glad he did it, with his background. And I mentioned to\n-- him before, in another part of the interview that he followed my Death March in\nPoland for one week -- for two -- for two weeks, and he retraced everything during the\nwinter. And he has many o-other endeavors that he did, pertaining to the Holocaust. So\nit\u2019s very close then he -- I don\u2019t have to tell him. He will -- he has now all of my papers\nthat he will organize, and go through, and he [indecipherable] source with my family, if\nany [indecipherable] for the Holocaust, he has the records, and he will get the -- the\ninterview tape, too. So I\u2019m very proud of Albert, he has accomplished enough, at a young\nage, and he\u2019s a great guy, and he has done many things to his -- my -- for instance, for as\nfar as mother\u2019s concerned, on his birthday he delivers -- or has delivered flowers to his\nmother for having me born. And they have a very good relationship with both father and\nmother. And the worst thing that I am concerned with, that if ever I ha -- anything\nhappens to me [indecipherable] children are good hands [indecipherable] why I was taken\n195\ncare of, but I am worried about having to go to an old people\u2019s home one day. I don\u2019t\nthink that will happen unless medically, it\u2019s impossible to keep at home, because I have\nsix children who will fight over having me in the house. So anyway, that\u2019s a good\nthought. Whatever happens, now that\u2019s another story. And they will take care of their\nmother.",
        "A: Okay. We come to Nicole, our oldest daughter. Our oldest daughter was impressed by\nolder son\u2019s beginnings in ROTC. She didn\u2019t have ROTC when she started college -- and\nby the way, I must explain about education. I was a male chauvinist, I must admit that,\ncoming from Europe, from Germany. German, and whether Jewish or not, most men\nwere sh -- male chauvinists. And when I came to United States [indecipherable] start in\nhaving children, I thought, not having too much money, that the boys must go to college.\nWell very soon my [indecipherable] by my wife, and m-my daughters, and I felt in --\nmarriages sometimes don\u2019t last very long here. The women have to have profession, too,\nso they can make their own living. And I said, \u201cWell, the money\u2019s not going to have me\nsplit three ways to go to college, it\u2019s going to be six ways from now on.\u201d So how do I do\nthat? Well, I know how much money was avail -- and I had no experience with college,\nbecause nobody had st -- had started yet, and Albert was going to start. So I said, \u201cOne\nthing Ill assure you of, the first year\u2019s assured, for everybody. I -- I pay for it. After that\nyou\u2019re on your own.\u201d So I want to put a taste in their mouths what college 1s like, not to\nsay I go to work first, and like I have a lot of people that let their children go to work for\n196\na year, and they make so much money, and they don\u2019t want to get a college degree. You\nknow, why should I go to college, I can make more money not going? So I didn\u2019t want\nthat to happen, since I like -- like the education. I picked some up in the army, picked up\na degree in the army, but not like my oldest son. Because my main interest was a family,\nnot -- not studying. So some of them wound up with scholarships, or part scholar -- and I\nmade sure that, of course, they started first year, that was on me, and anything else later\non will have to be scholarships, or borrow money from a bank, or from me, if -- 1f -- if\nnothing -- if you don\u2019t -- couldn\u2019t get the money, but you pay me back, because we have\nto get some money for your mother to be on her own someday. I don\u2019t want her to be\ndependent on you. I -- I want her to have enough to live on if something happens to me.\nSo they all agreed. And I said, \u201cIf you need any money at the end of your college time,\nthe fourth year, and the third year, and you can\u2019t get any loans because your dad makes\ntoo much money, or whatever, you can borrow money from me, and no interest. And you\npay me back when you can, when you start working.\u201d And that\u2019s what happened every\none of them. The three last ones owed me each -- I don\u2019t know how much they owed me,\nbut somewhere around 10,000 dollars each. And I -- I agreed that -- like I said, no -- no\ninterest. If they can pay, they pay me back [indecipherable] hundred dollars a month. And\nif they good -- good at it, paying back the money they owe me, said they owe me no\ninterest. I will let them off when I can afford to. So as it turned out, the last three owed\nme about six, seven, 8,000 dollars, and I was at a point in time when I was making good\nmoney with the government, I said you all paid me back, what you could every month,\n197\nand y -- I -- I wrote it off, you don\u2019t owe me any money any more. Because I could\nafford, there was nobody else going to college. So they all understood, and they all were\nhelping, and they were -- and they continue to do so. So we go to Nina. Nina, or Nicole,\nwho is 39, the oldest daughter, is a terrific girl. After she saw her mother doing these\nthings in the military, and getting paid for it also, she volunteered after two years in\ncollege, to go out to ROTC. In the meantime, her brother was a battalion commander, not\nreally, but like -- but that the ROTC battalion commander. And she got also a\ncommission as a second lieutenant, and they gave me the honor to -- if I can appear in\nuniform, to be at the Pentagon, or at the college, and pin the bars on my daughter. And so\none side was her brother, and the other side was me, pinning second lieutenant bars on\nher. So she became a captain in the army, then she met her husband, she was Intelligence\nin Berlin, very interesting career. She was, since she studied psychology, they put her in\nIntelligence too, and she was dealing with the Russians in Berlin. We visited her, we\nwent to east Berlin. She went in uniform, because the Russians had an agreement, they\ndon\u2019t touch Americans. The east Germans wanted to, but they were not allowed to touch\nus, It was a very interesting experience. But anyway, Nina became a captain, then met her\nhusband at the advanced Intelligence school in -- and she married a guy who was\nCatholic, but he agreed that the children were now Jewish. So she got out of the army,\nhe\u2019s now a lieutenant colonel, he was -- his last job was -- he was military attache --\ndefense attach\u00e9 in Belarus, which is white Russia, or the city of Minsk, where a lot of\nJews lived, and still live. They have three synagogues there, and my daughter used to go\n198\nwith her husband to the Dubabitchka synagogue in Minsk. And he finished his tour last\nyear. They live here in Anendale, and she still brings her children up the Jewish way. She\nhas one boy and two girls. And she educates them a very nice way, play the violin, play\nthe piano, and so on. And her husband has been offered now, the next assignment as a\nmilitary attach\u00e9 to Czechoslovakia, to Prague. And I said, \u201cTake it, take it. That\u2019s a nice\nplace to go to, Prague.\u201d We -- my wife and I have been there one time. And so Nina 1s\nvery successful in many ways, particularly bringing up her children the proper way. And\nshe did the right thing to leave the army. She was a good soldier, she\u2019s a good mother,\nparticularly sh-she studies ecology, which [indecipherable] in the army, no, she was near\nthe mother. So, we come to the third child, Marcel, who is money-wise, the most\nsuccessful of all. He worked for a congressman, for our congressman as an intern. Well,\nfirst of all he went and he -- he got an appointment to the Air Force Academy. After two\nyears, his eyes were turning bad, he wanted to become an engineer, and a jet pilot. But in\nthis -- when he almost finished his second year, he was told by the air force that he\u2019s not\ngoing to fly, because eyes were getting bad from reading too much, but he was going to\nbecome an engineer, besides being a pilot. And he said, \u201cWell, what I g -- what am I\ngoing to do, I\u2019m not going to fly?\u201d \u201cWell, you go to missile silo when you graduate.\u201d He\nsaid no. I\u2019m not going to missile silo and be stuck two years the underground. And he\nsaid, \u201cI\u2019m resigning from the academy.\u201d Which he did. And I had told him, \u201cWell, you\u2019re\non your own. You had a [indecipherable], you had to stay four years afterwards, so five\nyears. And you going to go do something else, but you\u2019re putting me in a -- in a bind with\n199\nmoney, whi -- I was hoping you would get -- I wouldn\u2019t have to pay a penny for you at\nthe academy, but you quit.\u201d He said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Pop, don\u2019t worry.\u201d He went to the\nVirginia Polytechnic in He was good at math, and he got a -- first of all he got his two\nyears credit from the academy, because h -- if you leave after two years, you have a\ncommitment, and he left when he had two years, just in time. So he didn\u2019t have to pay\nanything back, and he got his degree in Applied Mathematics. Short story that when he\ncame out, he worked for the congressman, like I said, and then he applied -- and -- and --\nat the high school that his -- his high school as substitute math teacher. Well, then he\nbecame -- he was also winner in north -- northern Virginia wrestling matches, that\u2019s why\nthe academy was also interested in him, besides other things. Well, then he want his first\njob, he wasn\u2019t make any money with the congressman, that was free for the congressman.\nBut he was getting half a day at the school, he was getting paid for that. He said, \u201cI gotta\nmake more money.\u201d So, he applied for a first job, and he gives a reference the\ncongressman, one of the Beltway bandits, if you know what that -- people getting\ncontracts from the government. And the person interviewed him said, \u201cDo you have any\nreferences?\u201d Well, the school, and the congressman. Well he called both of them, and the\ncongressman took the phone himself, and he said, \u201cIn my 10 years as a congressman, I\nnever had a better intern.\u201d",
        "A: That was --\n200",
        "A: Wolfe. Congressman Wolfe. And so upon Wolfe giving him a nice reference, he was\nhired by BDM corporation. And he moved up very quickly, and since then, again to make\na long story short, in order to get ahead you have to change companies sometimes. He\nwent to work for Merck, big pharmacirculated company. And so Merck, he was a director\nat Merck, and he moved about -- well, he moved from Merck to Brussels for two years.\nHe was the European representative for Merck, and he got a big computer system started\nover there. And his -- he made a name for himself. He 1s now listed -- I don\u2019t know --\neven know what this guys name 1s, big -- the biggest guy in computers, who in the news\nall the time, young guy who made millions and mill -- he is listed as the guest speaker\nwith him, on something that\u2019s coming up. But again, he\u2019s changed from Merck. He was\nrecruited by Squibb -- by what\u2019s that firm, has three names? Another pharmaceutical\ncompany who is in Princeton, New Jersey, and it has the name of a British city. Anyway,\nit doesn\u2019t make any difference. He also is going out with a young lady that 1s very nice,\nspoke fluent French, which I love, and was good. He went out with her for nine years.\nShe wanted to marry him, he also wanted to get married, but he said, \u201cI don\u2019t get married\ntil I make at least a salary of 100,000 a year.\u201d Well, when he made it, he got married to\nher. But since then he moved up, and he became the executive director of Bristol, Meyer,\nSquibb, which also a very big fa -- he -- he\u2019s a wonderful son, not because he makes a lot\nof money, he is. And I could s-say many things, [indecipherable] two boys, wonderful\nwife, who came here yesterday while her husband\u2019s flying to Brussels. So that\u2019s him.\nThey live in Princeton, New Jersey. After Marcel comes Marguerite, and she\u2019s 36, and\n201\nMarguerite just got her second degree, [indecipherable] also a Master\u2019s in ec-economics\nand marketing. And she just got married, and she\u2019s the first one that got married to a\nJewish guy, who doesn\u2019t care a bit about being Jewish, and she is more Jewish than he 1s.\nHis parents were here, they\u2019re very Jewish, from New York, and he\u2019s a great guy. They\nall married -- they have all great partner, every one of them. And their -- their philosophy,\nor their desire 1s, if he doesn\u2019t fit in the family, I\u2019m not going to marry him, or her. And\nthey all fit in. We have the best all of six -- one is not married, the last one, of course.\nThey all -- we all get along, just not the in-laws, and they get along with us, and they get\nalong with each other. And they all kind -- we have three of them living nearby, they\nwanted to be sh -- be sure they take care of their parents, some of them, so one of them\nlives in Princeton, Marcel, and Albert at West Point, and the rest of them live around\nhere.",
        "A: Marguerite is working, and don\u2019t tell me what company, I -- I can never. She\u2019s\nworking for a big firm that is taking contracts, and that re-organizes people personnel-\nwise, and marketing, depending on the market. And she\u2019s what you might call a -- a\nwoman that takes care of problems for the company. She\u2019s a very strong woman, and\nthen we come to the next one, shall I finish the children?\n202",
        "A: Okay, I will pick up some of the in-laws that I -- I don\u2019t mention much about them,\nabout who they are. Albert\u2019s wife -- her father was a naval officer on an aircraft carrier,\nhe was also a pilot. He\u2019s a very nice guy, he is also retired, and lives in Alabama.\nNicole\u2019s husband I mentioned, is also military, 1s also lieutenant colonel, recently in\nBelarus as a military attache. Great guy. And he and Albert are probably the -- the two\n[indecipherable] that are close together of all the kids because they in the military.\nMarcel\u2019s wife speaks fluent French, was working for a big advertising -- not advertising\nfirm, people who deal with money, and making up taxes for a big firm [indecipherable], I\nforgot the name. She does not work, she takes care of the two boys. Marguerite, I said,\nwas just married to a Jewish guy, who is also in finance. They don\u2019t have no children,\nthey live 10 minutes from here. Now we come to Satcheco. Satcheco, of course, was born\nin Japan. She is my daughter, and my wife\u2019s daughter, but we gave her a ja -- a-- a\nJapanese name, because we liked living in Japan. She\u2019s 33 now. She has an unusual job.\nShe is a adjudicator with the Virginia employment office, but actually she deals in\nunemployment, that\u2019s her specialty. She is in charge of a group who handles cases that\nhave been rej -- routinely rejected. And she gets a second opinion on it, and a decision\nwhether people should get unemployment or not, depending on whether they quit their\njob, or they were fired, or [indecipherable]. So the n-name of adjudicator 1s not the real\n203\nname, that is the professional name. She\u2019s also -- she called a -- I forgot what it -- it\u2019s like\nan administrative judge, I -- I -- I can\u2019t think of the name right now. Satcheco has the\nJapanese name, is named after a friend of ours. I mentioned the general and his daughter,\nwho come -- who -- who had a daughter who still comes to see us here once a year. And\nshe likes her name. She doesn\u2019t look Japanese, which surprises everybody when she goes\n-- they always look for Japanese [indecipherable] call her name. She\u2019s 33, and she\nmarried a guy and he\u2019s of Chinese descent. He is a engineer, working for the U.S. patent\noffice. And he is only Chinese in looks, a typical American boy. His father\u2019s already born\nhere, he\u2019s a [indecipherable] engineer. His mother was born in China, came here as a\nyoung girl. And she had a li -- a very big marriage, of all Chinese people, about 250 of\nthem, less -- a ye -- about a year ago, and she\u2019s now pregnant. And she keeps on working,\nand her husband, like I said, works for the patent bureau, and he does everything we\nwant. He is not religious in any way, but he\u2019ll go to synagogue if you want him to, but he\ndoes not -- [indecipherable] synagogue. But they both think cooked Chinese food 1s very\ngood. I think that\u2019s how they got together. But she\u2019s pregnant now, so she has to watch\nherself. And he 1s a great guy, as an in -- son in -- we -- we don\u2019t call them son-in-laws,\nwe just call them -- they call me Pop, and I -- I call them by their name. So his name is\nDarren, and the last one 1s Michael, the youngest one, who 1s really outstanding in a\ndifferent way. He\u2019s a big -- a real scholar. He went to UVA, and College of William and\nMary for one year. He also had a military scholarship, but he didn\u2019t take advantage of it.\nIt -- the military were not for him, and that was okay. So he got himself a degree in\n204\nforeign affairs. He is now working on the Master\u2019s at the Georgetown University Foreign\nService School, and he will graduate as a diplomat, I guess, up there. And he -- in the\nmeantime, he was awarded by the Department of Defense -- he worked this summer, he\nborrowed all the money to go to Georgetown, because I wasn\u2019t willing to pay for\nGeorgetown, he\u2019s 30 years old, he can do some work in the meantime, which he did. He\ngot himself employed by Department of Defense, in the Pentagon, in the Joint Staff, as an\nanalyst for National Security Affairs. And he was picked, he didn\u2019t know it when he\nstarted that two people get picked in the Pentagon, but he had to go to a new school. They\ngave out regular degree, and Master\u2019s degrees in National Security. And there was an\narticle in the paper, he told me down there, I didn\u2019t read it, Washington Post, about this\nnew university, or -- if it\u2019s called university, I don\u2019t have the name right now, but it\u2019s in -\n- and the school gives out is -- is -- 1s qualified on the national whatever, to graduate\npeople Master\u2019s degrees in national security affairs. [indecipherable] just started a school\nwhere you finish in one year, get his Master\u2019s. In meantime he gets 35,000 dollars, in\naddition, for his living expenses. But he lives here, but he will move out with a good\nfriend of his into an apartment in December. So he doesn\u2019t have to pay anything here,\nfood is free, the good food of his mother, which he will miss, and he lives in the\nbasement, that\u2019s his territory. I never know he\u2019s here, not here, and I don\u2019t have to pay a\npenny for his upkeep, or for -- he takes care of all this himself. He\u2019s terrific son, he\u2019s our\nbaby, a mother\u2019s baby. So that\u2019s the children, I don\u2019t think I left anybody out.\n205",
        "A: It\u2019s a good question. I have to make a distinction, 1f somebody says, \u201cAre you German\nor Jewish?\u201d Some people come with the question. Well, I\u2019m German. That\u2019s my\nnationality, or was, was. Jewish is my religion. There\u2019s a big difference. Do I feel\nGerman, Jewish? I would say both. Because there\u2019s some traits in my character that\u2019s\ndefinitely German, not Jewish. And there\u2019s some of them may be Jewish. Now, I think I\nhave the advantage of taking the best of all three of these things, German,\n[indecipherable] take poetry, or some, and there was a German poem that kept me alive\nin the camps in the war.",
        "A: [indecipherable]. Well, I can say it in German, but I will give it to you, it\u2019s in my\nwallet in English. Or my wife can send it to you, make a copy of It.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Unga vontzen trotsashaldin. Mira deshpoink kraftisi sang, houfidi amadai gotaiba. It\u2019s\nfrom Gerta. So that\u2019s definitely German. It means something basically -- the translation\u2019s\nvery ba -- not -- you cannot translate -- 1t\u2019s you are countin -- all power -- all bad powers\n206\nthat be. You never give up, you show yourselves in strength, not down being, and well,\nwhich also, I like to add something which I used in the army in a different way. When\nyou are a commander, or in charge of men who go into combat, you don\u2019t want to show\nthat you are scared. But everybody is scared. That doesn\u2019t make you an officer, or not an\nofficer. They\u2019re all scared the first time, or second or third time. There\u2019s no such thing,\nyou heard, as an atheist in a foxhole. Well, I -- I -- I -- my motto was, keep your fears to\nyourself, and share your courage with others. And that\u2019s why I teamed up with this\nDutchman in concentration camp. Sure we were scared, but we didn\u2019t show it to each\nother, and that\u2019s why I succeeded eventually, with lack of co -- now let me see about the\nother part. And in -- in spite of all this, you are staying alive, you\u2019re keeping yourself\nalive, by all means. And this German poem was -- really had a large responsibility in\nkeeping me alive.",
        "A: Yes, I knew it before I went in the camps. And actually, it\u2019s a lot li --",
        "A: It\u2019s ala -- probably in fourth, fifth grade. Very early. It\u2019s a very serious poem,\n[indecipherable]",
        "A: -- just took that part that -- that applied to me.\n207",
        "A: All children in Germany, yes. And then later on, I changed to a Jewish school, because\nJews couldn\u2019t go any more. I had a Jewish teacher, and he was more German than the\nGermans. And I -- he was so strict, my father was very strict, that when I found him\nliving in the United States, in New York, after the war, he had not escaped to New York\nwith his wife, no children, but he had been hidden by two German f-families who were\nboth schoolteachers like he was, and hidden throughout the war. It would have cost them\ntheir lives if they were found out. That was my teacher, my strictest teacher, a guy I\nprobably hated at the time, who hit me a million times, and then I got it when I came\nhome, from my father, I got double dosage. So when I finally found him, he was 75, or\n80 years old in New York, I went -- I called him up first. I found out coincidentally, in a\nGerman Jewish newspaper which I read, and in a announcement of somebody die -- oh\nyeah, the people went Shanghai, I mentioned to you before, the girl that was in my class.\nShe said, \u201cYou know, our old teacher lives in New York?\u201d I said, \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t.\u201d \u201cMr.\nDamon lives in New York, he came after the war.\u201d I said, \u201cYou got his number? I want to\ncall him.\u201d I called him up same evening, and Mr. Damon said, \u201cOh yeah, Willner,\nWillner, I remember you.\u201d And I said, bull, he can\u2019t remember, he had thousands of kids.\nAnd he doesn\u2019t remember me. Maybe he remembers me for some of the bad things I did.\nSo he said -- I said to him for a joke, \u201cWell, Mr. Damon, I remember you, too, very well.\nAs a matter of fact, my rear still hurts.\u201d\u201d And soon after my wife and I went to New York,\nwe went to see him, and he -- we couldn\u2019t have done a greater pleasure to this guy. And\nhe was supposed to go with us to Germany, to receive some honors, in the city where we\n208\nwere invited for two weeks. He couldn\u2019t go be -- his heart -- his heart was not strong\nenough. He has died since.",
        "A: Oh yeah, before he died, I wanted him to write a letter to address the German people\ninviting us, and say whatever he wanted to say to the Germans. Well, he was very nice\nabout it, he didn\u2019t insult anybody. And he -- I read the letter to a group of about 500\nGermans [indecipherable], and maybe 100 Jews, who came back from different -- from\nBrazil, from Israel, or -- and I could -- I became so emotional during the -- reading his --\nhis letter that one German came up to me, a newspaper guy, he said, \u201cWould you read it\nin front of German TV station?\u201d I -- I said I would. That was the greatest thing, I read it\nfor my schoolteacher, because he bared himself, and he took them to task, but in a nice\nway. And he also didn\u2019t suffer, he was hidden, he could say something good, and not just\nbad about the Germans. The two teachers hid him, and their wives, were not caught, and\nthen sor -- the part that you asked me about Germany, that\u2019s good and bad. And\n[indecipherable] able -- I -- I tell you s -- one thing, far as that is concerned, hate, or what\ndo you call it, when somebody -- guilt -- oh, collective guilt. I don\u2019t believe in collective\nguilt, never have. I don\u2019t think that all Germans are guilty. There are many Germans that\nare guilty, who knew about it, who didn\u2019t lift a finger. I\u2019m not talking about the SS now,\nthe real bad guys. So -- as a matter of fact, I would not be alive today if it wouldn\u2019t be\nsome German, who was somehow -- gave me a piece of bread, extra piece of bread, or\n[indecipherable] something. So, I said to my wife after the army, what are we going to do\n209\nby going in a civil service job. Well, there were many jobs open in Germany that time,\nfor Americans, and civilian. I said, \u201cI go back and get a job.\u201d \u201cYou would?\u201d Johanna\nsaid, \u201cI won\u2019t. I\u2019m finished with Germany.\u201d So I changed my mind since, I th -- I think\nmy wife was right. So that part of Germany, so you ha -- you have some good, and some\nbad, and some people -- I think if you hate people, all people like t -- you believe they\u2019re\nall guilty, it eats you up eventually, not the other person, the other person didn\u2019t --\nprobably don\u2019t give a damn. And people are sensitive. I -- I never -- I don\u2019t love the SS or\nsomebody like that, I don\u2019t say that, but that some people were good Germans. So there\u2019s\ngood Jews, and bad Jews. Maybe there were more Nazis then. But I believe today -- for\ninstance, what goes on in Israel [indecipherable] watch TV, I -- I think the Jews have a\npoint. The Arabs who cannot deny them certain things. Unfortunately it\u2019s a situation that\nis very difficult to solve, if at all. I -- I must -- I made a speech, and I haven\u2019t made many\nspeeches here, about the Holocaust. One was at the high school that our children went to,\nand the principal was of German descent, not Jewish. He invited me, and he said -- and I\ncouldn\u2019t turn him down. And he -- he not -- not -- he didn\u2019t take the ger -- the history\nclass, at that time [indecipherable] World War two, 1s -- he took 700 kids into the\nauditorium, and he said, \u201cI want you to listen to Mr. Willner, Albert\u2019s father.\u201d They\nlistened to me, and at the end of my talk -- so I talk about some of the experiences World\nWar two -- at the end of the talk one boy stood up, had a question, and he said to me,\n\u201cMr. Willner, you think it could happen here?\u201d I said, \u201cIt\u2019s a very good question,\u201d I said,\n\u201cves, it could. But we have a democratic government. But Germany had a democratic\n210\ngovernment too, when Hitler came to power. It can be turned around like you never know\nwhat\u2019s going to happen. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to happen here, not in my lifetime, I\nhope, but these people, bad people exist here, too. Who hate, who don\u2019t like Jews, don\u2019t\nlike Blacks, or whatever. And the same people that I saw in SS uniforms in Germany, I\nhave seen them, I\u2019m sorry to say, in our own army. Just put an SS uniform. People who\nwould kill Vietnamese women and children, think nothing of it. Gooks, they were gooks\nto them.\u201d And people were shocked, particularly the principal, he took me to his office\nlater on, I won\u2019t -- he was shocked because he felt, as a German -- he was born here, his\nfather was German, he said. And I told him, \u201cDr. Toombs, this 1s ridiculous that you even\nthink that way. What responsibility could you have had in what the Germans did because\nyour father is German himself? There\u2019s no such thing as collective guilt, not in my\nbook.\u201d Well, we really became very good friends, of course, we were already. And so\nthese -- and I must add that the same people, some people like that, exist even among the\nJews in Israel, who would go kill Arabs just because they\u2019re Arabs. I\u2019m sorry to say, but\nit -- that\u2019s the way I feel. So these bad people exist in any country, given a chance to do\nit. [have seen my own army, Lieutenant Calley, who -- who killed women and children\nin his [indecipherable]. He should not be in -- jailed, his superior should have been jailed.\nWhy? Because they knew he was a killer, and what he was eventually going to do. They\nshould have made him -- his commanding officer should have made a supply officer in\nthe back, where he can\u2019t do any harm, shoot women and children. So these people\n211\nexisted. And here, in peace time, the types exist and if they do something bad, they wind\nup in the penitentiary. In war time they get away with it.",
        "A: The current interest [indecipherable]",
        "A: That\u2019s difficult to say. Depending how much we -- we -- we have to put a lot -- we\nJews have to put a lot into it. And other people who are not Jews, who think likewise, that\nif you don\u2019t protect certain things, or that people go [indecipherable]. Like yesterday I\nwas discussing the NRA. I got an application to apply for NRA, for the membership. And\nI talked to my wife about it, and I said, \u201cThrow it away.\u201d And she happened to listen to\nan NRA interview of this guy who is in charge, LaPierre. I wasn\u2019t here. And she told me\nabout it. Well, as long as we have people like that, we have to be active doing something\nabout it. And we have to keep going. [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yeah. I think it\u2019s important. But it\u2019s not important maybe in some little town where\nnobody takes a look at pe -- it\u2019s the passing thing. And recently the name came up,\nHolocaust industry. I got a letter now they -- they -- th-they -- they -- they are -- they are\nelevating a wall in Paris, just like the Vietnam Wall here, with all the names on it. They\nwant my parents name on it, they want me to contribute money. I will not contribute any\nmoney, my parents don\u2019t have a grave, that\u2019s true, but I\u2019d rather give the money I have to\n212\ngive away to living causes, where it\u2019s -- well, I can tell you, I feel very strong recently\nabout certain incidents that had happened. And then I can think [indecipherable], which\nupset me very much. I was a contributor like most of -- most Jews, to the Jewish appeal.\nThey now write this letter that a Russian Jew, who came to Israel with his father, was\ndrafted, became a sergeant in the army, was killed in Lebanon or someplace, and they\ncouldn\u2019t bury the guy, because his mother was not Jewish. That\u2019s the Orthodox. No, I\ncould not live in Israel with people like that. I tell you very frankly, they make me sick\nsometimes. Some of them don\u2019t fight for their country, let some other people fight for\ntheir country. And when this happened to this guy who killed -- was killed for Israel, and\nthey couldn\u2019t bury him because the Orthodox wouldn\u2019t let them do it, and he had to be\nshipped back to Russia, to his mother. I thought [indecipherable]. At that moment I wrote\na letter to the United Jewish Appeal, I\u2019m sorry I don\u2019t have it right now, I don\u2019t even\nknow where I put it. And th-the president or executive director answered it personally. I\nsaid, \u201cI will not contribute any money because I know some of your money go -- go to\nOrthodox Jews, I don\u2019t support Orthodox Jews.\u201d And he wrote me a nice letter. I said,\n\u201cT\u2019d rather give the money to the Holocaust Museum, and not -- not the United Jewish\nAppeal, where I know some of the people, recipients, and just to run their schools, or\nwhatever.\u201d Let them do it themselves, I -- I don\u2019t approve of it. When they can\u2019t let a guy\nbe buried in the cemetery, even if he was buried in the corner, but they just said no for\nsome reason. [indecipherable]\n213",

        "A: They can see what I have to say, what their grandfather had to say on all the tapes and\nvideos, and they\u2019re a little bit different, but I think it drives home some of the things\nwe\u2019 re interested in, in seeing continuing. So -- oh, they get -- they will also get some\nthings in writing, and they have written poems. If you go to the next room -- I don\u2019t know\nif I can [indecipherable], I\u2019d like to just read you one poem that my oldest son wrote\nwhen he was 11 or 12 years old.

And we have a few others that some of the other kids wrote, but\nthis, 1t was the one impressed me the most. And this is the kind of education he got\nmostly through my wife, poetry. She likes to write, she\u2019s writing a book, too. And she\nwrote lot of poetry. She has stuff accept by Hadassah, the Jewish newspaper, printed.\nAnd she had several other things. So, she must take credit for that. Not for writing this,\nfor putting this kind of spirit into him. And when you ask about the grandchildren, I\u2019m\nsure his children will continue to feel like he does. He\u2019s very quiet about it, but he speaks\nout when he should. So --",
        "A: [indecipherable]. I have not forgotten anything, but I would say that in general, we\ndon\u2019t disagree on any of the things I said, the children and I, because they have seen all\nthe videotapes that have been made, the things that I\u2019ve said. And in talking to them, I\u2019ve\nconfirmed, or reinforced some of the things I\u2019ve said. And the grandchildren I cannot say.\nI really cannot, to be honest. Some of them frankly will not grow up as Jews, but it\ndoesn\u2019t bother me, as long as they have in their heart, and they know something about\ntheir past, that I don\u2019t want the daughter to say, \u201cWell, my husband is Catholic,\u201d -- and in\na matter of fact -- well, that\u2019s another story. I\u2019m not going to -- she teach them how to be\nJewish, and she can do it. She takes it serious, so does Maggie. So the -- out of the girls\nbe -- the mothers being the ones that\u2019s really educate the children, because they\u2019re home,\nor because the Jewish religion, the Orthodox say so, that\u2019s fine with me. But I would say\n215\ndefinitely two [indecipherable] know right now, Marguerite and Nicole are educating\ntheir children -- Marguerite doesn\u2019t have any children yet, but she was going the way\nNicole goes, and her children, particularly the two daughters, getting a good Jewish\neducation. They belong to a synagogue here. They don\u2019t go much to synagogue, but they\ngo to the re-religious education. And they did the same thing in Minsk.",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t think so. They -- they aware of it, but why -- why would the Blacks in\nAfrica care about all [indecipherable] their own. Why the many Chinese have been killed\nin some of the wars, millions. And they -- they don\u2019t think that the way we do, that Jews\nwere killed only because they were Jews, and there were different reasons. For the\nmoment, that\u2019s all still 1n people\u2019s mind, people are still alive, they experience it, but I\nthink another two generation, it will peter out somehow. It -- because they have the\n[indecipherable] with television now, I -- I will say one thing, or my wife at least thinks\nso, that if we had a television, it wouldn\u2019t have happened. Not in -- in that -- that way. So\nI think television will do a lot in the future to prevent things. Well, I-I -- I-I -- I\u2019m very si-\nsim-simplisistic [indecipherable] as far as that goes. I think the United States, I always\nfelt, we don\u2019t have ma -- many problems as Jews, but other people have, the Blacks. So\nin a way, if they didn\u2019t have any problems with the Blacks, they probably would have\nsomebody else [indecipherable] would be more. Might be Jews, it might be an Asian,\nKorean, Japan -- whoever. Or Blacks from Africa. But I don\u2019t think we have too much to\nworry about here, not in our lifetime.\n216",
        "A: I hope -- I hope -- I hope it\u2019s the -- it\u2019s the right thing I believe, but who knows, you\nnever know, but I na -- I think dictatorships hopefully on the way out, we just happened\nto have another one go in Yugoslavia, and I hope it continues and we can make the world\nbetter by example, by keeping the Holocaust story alive. I think it\u2019s very important, but\nhow much do you keep alive in 50 years from now, I -- I don\u2019t know. Because there other\nconcerns in the world.",
