We tried to catch the whole city. We caught Katamon,\nif you heard about this, it\u2019s a big section, we were fighting. The Castel(ph).\n103May 16, 2014\nCastel(ph) is the big mountain to go to Jerusalem. We opened the road, and then we\nsi \u2014 little by little, we took care on all the \u2014 almost all the road, til we opened up the\nBurma road. We were securing the Burma road, because from the beginning we\ncouldn\u2019t get there with \u2014 with trucks, with nothing. We brought over thousands of\npeople from one side, and on the other side, and people with hammers, wi-with\nshovels, with everything, made a little pass. And used to \u2014 one side used to come\nfrom tele \u2014 Tel Aviv side. Trucks with food, with ammunition, whatever we need,\nand carry on the b \u2014 on their backs, on their arms, to the other side, and load the\nother trucks, go to Jerusalem. That\u2019s what started Burma road.

The first ceasefire\nwas in \u2014 I think in June. End of June. Was a ceasefire for three weeks. Then \u2014 now\nall brigade, they brought us down, we got some replacement because we got about a\n180 people \u2014 soldier died, in those couple months. And we went back in this area\nafter the ceasefire. The meantime, it was an embargo. But when the British left on\nMay 15\", were boats already waiting outside to come in, with weapons. We got a lot\nof weapons from Czechoslovakia. We start to get some cannons, some planes, little\n104\nMay 16, 2014\nby little, we rebuilt, and we start to push the Arabs back. When there was the second\nceasefire, we were in a different situation because we could bring in everything, just\nmoney. And with money you know from where it came. Who could give the money?\nAmerican Joes. And that\u2019s the way we finished the \u2014 the war in \u201949, til the ceasefire.\nAnd if they couldn\u2019t kill that time, the Irgun, Bernadotte, if you know who was\nBernadotte.",

        "A: Same story.",
        "Q: Yeah. That\u2019s speaking to someone who shaped you. What would you want to say\nto somebody who comes after us? What would you want them to understand about\nwhat happened?",
        "A: It\u2019s very hard to \u2014 even to think what to say. What can I tell them? I can tell them\nmy story. I can tell them that people should behave a little bit different to us. That\u2019s\nall. What can I tell them more? That the whole world, even United States, they\nknew what\u2019s going on in Europe, they knew what the German do to the \u2014 not only\nto the Jews, they killed also five million Poles, and plus other nationality. And they\nknew what\u2019s going on. And what they do? Did you hear \u2014 did you hear somebody\n108May 16, 2014\ngive a speech about this? Maybe they were too busy with \u2014 with their own war, but\nthey should at least say something.",
        "Q: A real abandonment.",
        "A: Yeah. When I was hiding, I didn\u2019t maybe think about this, I wasn\u2019t maybe\nenough old to think things like this, but after, I start to think, where all the world\nwas? And they had the power to do something. Maybe not \u2014 maybe if they would\nthreaten Germany that we will wipe you up of the wa \u2014 of the war, maybe they\nwould behave a little bit themselves, but they didn\u2019t do nothing.",
        "Q: You were telling me also earlier that there were young men when you were \u2014 you\nknow, when you were still in the ghetto in Mlynov, who went to the Judenrat, and\ninstead of giving the gold to the Germans, the young men were saying, give it to us\nso that we can get weapons. How do you explain that, that the young men wanted\nthis, and the \u2014 and the older men, the Judenrat did otherwise?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know what to tell you, I just give you the story, what was, the time was\nwitnesses to this. They begged to them, give us money, give us something that you\ngive away to the German, we\u2019|l buy some and try to survive. Maybe 25 percent\nwould survive, but give us something. Let us at least do something, not to go like\nsheeps to \u2014 to the killing area. I don\u2019t know, maybe this was the \u2014 the \u2014 for years the\nJews were depressed. Maybe the \u2014 they were too religious and b-believing in\nsomething that cannot help us. Can only pray and can believe in something \u2014 I don\u2019t\n109\nMay 16, 2014\nknow. I\u2019ve no explanation. As I told you, that I don\u2019t believe any more in this\ntraditional religion, because when I crawled between the legs to the synagogue \u2014\nwhy? Because I want to also hear th-the praying, and I saw what\u2019s going on,\neverybody\u2019s crying and everybody is begging, and the roof didn\u2019t open up and those\n... and the angels didn\u2019t come and save us. And what can I tell you more?",
        "Q: Yeah. When \u2014 I\u2019m sorry.",
        "A: No problem.",
        "Q: When \u2014 when did it become possible for you to open up and talk about si \u2014\nbecause clearly there\u2019s such a cost.",
        "A: The last couple years.",
        "Q: And why?",
        "A: Listen, you get older, you start to think different. With age, you change your\nmind, you change your behavior. You physically get changed, and maybe that\u2019s the\n[indecipherable]",

I mean, they ask me whose \u2014 who you are,\nwho\u2019s your father? When I told them Moshke(ph), then they\u2019re oh, we know him\ngood. But \u2014 because he used to deal with them, you know.",

They recruit us when the Arabs got \u2014 attacked transportation,\nthen from the beginning, we used to go in in the bus, seat two guys with submachine\nguns that used to make in Israel. Took it apart, keep it in the back. When something\n102\nMay 16, 2014\nstart, we used to put it together and \u2014 and then in the f\u2014 before the declaration of the\nstate, in May 15, \u201948, when Ben Gurion said, we became a legal army. And the\nPalmach was almost three \u2014 three brigades, organized.",
        "A: And we were like here, the \u2014 the Marines. Always in the head, always special\noperations [indecipherable]",
        "A: From the beginning, I was a platoon commander, a soldier and a platoon\ncommander. And we got caught in Jerusalem. We used to \u2014 all the convoys to\nJerusalem because the Jordanian army cut off the road to Jerusalem, cut off the\npipe of water to Jerusalem. Then the Palmach, we got stationed all the road to\nJerusalem to secure the [indecipherable] by the last convoy, was by 180 trucks.\nAnd Colonel Marcus, did you hear about him? Colonel Marcus was a American\ncolonel that he went to Israel, he was fighting, and he \u2014 he became the commander\nof Jerusalem area. Then we organized the 180 trucks, and we were securing them.\nWe brought food, ammunition, water to Jerusalem, because by that time, was about\n60,000 Jews. And this convoy wouldn\u2019t arrive Jerusalem, Jerusalem would fell.\nPeople would die from hunger. And we got caught, the whole brigade in Jerusalem,\nand we were fighting there. We tried to catch the whole city. We caught Katamon,\nif you heard about this, it\u2019s a big section, we were fighting. The Castel(ph).\n103May 16, 2014\nCastel(ph) is the big mountain to go to Jerusalem. We opened the road, and then we\nsi \u2014 little by little, we took care on all the \u2014 almost all the road, til we opened up the\nBurma road. We were securing the Burma road, because from the beginning we\ncouldn\u2019t get there with \u2014 with trucks, with nothing. We brought over thousands of\npeople from one side, and on the other side, and people with hammers, wi-with\nshovels, with everything, made a little pass. And used to \u2014 one side used to come\nfrom tele \u2014 Tel Aviv side. Trucks with food, with ammunition, whatever we need,\nand carry on the b \u2014 on their backs, on their arms, to the other side, and load the\nother trucks, go to Jerusalem. That\u2019s what started Burma road. And lit \u2014 and we\nwere securing the area, because the Jordanian army was not far away from there.\nAnd little by little, brought tractors and blew out, and we made a road.",
        "A: Yeah. Not only I, was a lot of my age. And that\u2019s the way we open alternative\nroad to Jerusalem. And \u2014 and we si \u2014 were til the first ceasefire. The first ceasefire\nwas in \u2014 I think in June. End of June. Was a ceasefire for three weeks. Then \u2014 now\nall brigade, they brought us down, we got some replacement because we got about a\n180 people \u2014 soldier died, in those couple months. And we went back in this area\nafter the ceasefire. The meantime, it was an embargo. But when the British left on\nMay 15\", were boats already waiting outside to come in, with weapons. We got a lot\nof weapons from Czechoslovakia. We start to get some cannons, some planes, little\n104\nMay 16, 2014\nby little, we rebuilt, and we start to push the Arabs back. When there was the second\nceasefire, we were in a different situation because we could bring in everything, just\nmoney. And with money you know from where it came. Who could give the money?\nAmerican Joes. And that\u2019s the way we finished the \u2014 the war in \u201949, til the ceasefire.\nAnd if they couldn\u2019t kill that time, the Irgun, Bernadotte, if you know who was\nBernadotte.",
        "A: Bernadotte was there, from the UN, the head of keep the ceasefire. And Lehi\nkilled him in Jerusalem. We were already ready to attack, take away the West\nBank, maybe would take it in three days. But because they killed him, the whole war\nwas cancelled.",
        "A: Which gun?",
        "A: I still have the gun today.",
        "A: Yeah.\n105\nMay 16, 2014",

        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: No, none of us.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, no explanation. It was like a secret, nobody [indecipherable] 10 -\n15 - 20 years ago, I used to go twice a year \u2014 the last 20 years used to go almost\ntwice a year to Israel. Used to meet, and we used to talk between \u2014 why we didn\u2019t\ntalk about nothing \u2014 this? Nobody got an answer.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: I would say about 15 years ago.\n106\nMay 16, 2014",
        "A: Something like this. You know, most of the time, when I got married, I got\ndifferent world, how to make a living, how to build up myself, how to supply for the\nfamily everything. I didn\u2019t think about this.",
        "A: Hm?",

        "A: When we went out from the wedding \u2014 Haifa\u2019s a big port \u2014 all the boats start\nblowing [indecipherable] noisemakers. I said, what it 1s? He said, you \u2014 what, you\ndon\u2019t know it\u2019s a Christmas night?",
        "A: Yeah.\n107\nMay 16, 2014",

        "A: Six.",

        "A: I will tell him the same thing what I\u2019m telling you.",
        "A: Same story.",
        "A: It\u2019s very hard to \u2014 even to think what to say. What can I tell them? I can tell them\nmy story. I can tell them that people should behave a little bit different to us. That\u2019s\nall. What can I tell them more? That the whole world, even United States, they\nknew what\u2019s going on in Europe, they knew what the German do to the \u2014 not only\nto the Jews, they killed also five million Poles, and plus other nationality. And they\nknew what\u2019s going on. And what they do? Did you hear \u2014 did you hear somebody\n108May 16, 2014\ngive a speech about this? Maybe they were too busy with \u2014 with their own war, but\nthey should at least say something.",
        "A: Yeah. When I was hiding, I didn\u2019t maybe think about this, I wasn\u2019t maybe\nenough old to think things like this, but after, I start to think, where all the world\nwas? And they had the power to do something. Maybe not \u2014 maybe if they would\nthreaten Germany that we will wipe you up of the wa \u2014 of the war, maybe they\nwould behave a little bit themselves, but they didn\u2019t do nothing.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know what to tell you, I just give you the story, what was, the time was\nwitnesses to this. They begged to them, give us money, give us something that you\ngive away to the German, we\u2019|l buy some and try to survive. Maybe 25 percent\nwould survive, but give us something. Let us at least do something, not to go like\nsheeps to \u2014 to the killing area. I don\u2019t know, maybe this was the \u2014 the \u2014 for years the\nJews were depressed. Maybe the \u2014 they were too religious and b-believing in\nsomething that cannot help us. Can only pray and can believe in something \u2014 I don\u2019t\n109\nMay 16, 2014\nknow. I\u2019ve no explanation. As I told you, that I don\u2019t believe any more in this\ntraditional religion, because when I crawled between the legs to the synagogue \u2014\nwhy? Because I want to also hear th-the praying, and I saw what\u2019s going on,\neverybody\u2019s crying and everybody is begging, and the roof didn\u2019t open up and those\n... and the angels didn\u2019t come and save us. And what can I tell you more?",
        "A: No problem.",
        "A: The last couple years.",
        "A: Listen, you get older, you start to think different. With age, you change your\nmind, you change your behavior. You physically get changed, and maybe that\u2019s the\n[indecipherable]",

I mean, they ask me whose \u2014 who you are,\nwho\u2019s your father? When I told them Moshke(ph), then they\u2019re oh, we know him\ngood. But \u2014 because he used to deal with them, you know.",
        "A: My father used to \u2014 I\u2019ll give you just an example. Every week, he used to kill\nseven cows; seven, eight cows. We used to have in our stable, steady, staying six,\nseven cows, because he used to supply for them and the Polish army used to come\nfor maneuvers all summer, used to supply meat for them.
