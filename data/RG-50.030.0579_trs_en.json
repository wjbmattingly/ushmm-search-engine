And, when the \u2014 I went in there, down to Camp Forrest, Tennessee,\nwent through training down there. Then I went through training up at f-fort - Camp\nS-Salano(ph), Kansas, up at Camp Phillips.

And actually, the training was\nenough, cause we knew how to string a line, we knew how to make ties in the line\nfor communications, and go out and repair them after they get \u2014 get shot up or\nbroken up, and that\u2019s what we did.",
        "Q: What \u2014 can you tell us about your first combat experience?",
        "A: First combat experience, I took a Polish prisoner, first day. He was wearing a\nwine colored suit. He was a \u2014 he was operating a machine gun. He wasn\u2019t pulling\nthe trigger, he was just loading them. And the SS officer was about 50 to 75 yards\nin back of him, with a string tied to the trigger of the machine gun, and he pulls \u2014\npulls the string for that machine gun to operate. And these guys were supposed to\nstay there and load it up when it\u2019s empty, load it up. If they didn\u2019t, he\u2019d shoot them.\nAnd the \u2014 this man come out of the woods there, put his hands up when he saw me.\nAnd so I called the \u2014 our sergeant, pa \u2014 Sawyer. He was from Sewickly, he was\nPolish. I says, what\u2019s he talking about? Well, he says, he\u2019s been in that \u2014 been in\nthat position for two days now with no water and he wants a drink. He says, don\u2019t\ngive him anything. I gave him a slug of water out of my canteen, and he was very\ngrateful for it. And that was my first combat experience right there.",

        "A: How\u2019s that?",
        "Q: Were you at all involved in crossing the Moselle?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And can you tell \u2014 tell us about that experience?",
        "A: We crossed the Moselle on September the 12\", and that was mean and nasty\nfighting down there. And that\u2019s where I got the Bronze Star first \u2014 I mean, first\ntime. And what happened was, they put us down in a defensive position at\nDilliard(ph). As a \u2014 right above a church, a ro \u2014 dirt road went up the church, went\nup the OP. And they had shelled the OP, and quite a few of them were killed up\nthere. And they\u2019re sending an ambulance up there. And they told us that the \u2014 we\nhad to stay there 1n this position. So I start digging a little bit. And the first time the\n88 come in, and I digging \u2014 started digging faster, you know, I was really shoveling\ndirt there. What happened was that that, they had notified the guys in back of me, I\nwas a\u2014 oh, about \u2014 about 50 yards in front of them. And they rolled back under a\nbig apple tree, and I was out in that bend in the road that goes up the hill. A Dilliard\nthere from Dilliard. And I happened to look across the field, here come a German\npatr \u2014 patrol across the field. And there wasn\u2019t supposed to be a German on that\nside of the river. I saw they\u2019re getting close, closer and closer to our position, and I\nstart cutting loose at them when they got too close.",
        "Q: How were you armed? How were you armed? Wha-What weapon were you\ncarrying?",
        "A: The M1",
        "Q: The M1",
        "A: M1.",
        "Q: The carbine or the full sized?",
        "A: The \u2014 the \u2014 the full [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Right, good.",
        "A: Yeah. And then I knocked off the last three in that patrol, there was\napproximately nine of them. And I knocked off the last three, and I thought, it\u2019s\nfunny, I don\u2019t hear no shots behind me. Here what happened was the sergeant come\nup and ordered the men under the tree to fall back. And they forgot to tell me when\nI was up there digging. And that really made me mad.",
        "Q: I can imagine.",
        "A: They left me there by myself. I knocked off the first three, and the rest of them\ngave \u2014 saw the three were being knocked off, they disappeared. And to this day,\nwhen I talk to Felix, he was down in a building in there, and they said he\u2019s \u2014 he said\nit\u2019s all the same patrol. That\u2019s another \u2014 he\u2019s over there, and so then, actually, I\nwasn\u2019t supposed to be doing that work. I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m a\u2014 I\u2019m a wireman, but I had to\ndefend my position, and I did. And not only it happened then, it happened during\nthe whole war, especially in the Battle of the Bulge. And from then on, when we \u2014\nwell, after \u2014 after Argentan, Argentan-Falaise Gap, that battle up there in France,\nthat was the beginning of it, and then when he got to Moselle river, which driving\nacross France, you know, 50 - 60 mile an hour, how fast you want to go, until we\ngot to Orleans. And I got a picture of G Company in Orleans. Did you ever see\nthat picture? One guy was carrying a sniper rifle. And then the [indecipherable] got\nto Moselle, that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s where what, 317\" lost 300 and some \u2014 365 men, wasn\u2019t\nit? Across that river.\nA2: The battalion, the battalion.",
        "A: Huh?\nA2: The battalion lost that.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, we lost 365 men right there at crossing. And which I thought, and\nsome others too say [indecipherable] you know. Back in \u2014 back before this war\nstarted, when I was in school, I studied history. My family goes back as far as the\nyear 1205. I\u2019m entitled to wear a deer\u2019s head [indecipherable] with a dagger\nthrough his head. You know what that means? It means your ancestors fought 1n the\nCrusades. And I had a relative fight in all wars, from [indecipherable] World War,\nCivil War, Spanish War, American war, and the \u2014 like, I had a uncle \u2014 great-uncle\nwas killed in World War I. He got the DSO for what he did, but he died for it. He\nrescued two of his buddies out on the field, and he got machine-gunned. And they \u2014\nthey named a street down in Fort Benning, Brockman Way, because he got the\nDSO. And \u2014 so our family\u2019s been in a \u2014 wars, all wars.",
        "Q: Can you tell us about the battle \u2014 your experiences at the Battle of the Bulge?",
        "A: Cold, cold, let\u2019s put it that way. We were gonna left \u2014 I was gonna head to \u2014 was\nheading to Beechy, out of Saint Avold, France. We got down there about 11\no\u2019clock at night, and we was to go across into Beechy, Germany there. And they\nsaid, never mind. There\u2019s trucks up there, get on them, you\u2019re going for a long ride.\nSo we took the long ride up to Luxembourg, a hundred \u2014 hundred mile way. And\nthe first stop in Luxembourg, there\u2019s a bend in the road going from Luxembourg\ncity, up to Mersch. There\u2019s a big bend road. The \u2014 in the middle of that bend is a \u2014\nis a bar, a caf\u00e9. And that\u2019s when we first got our first booze in Luxembourg. We\ngot Luxembourg \u2014 Mersch, the town of Mersch, top the hill Mersch was a\nknocked out German tank \u2014 I don\u2019t know who knocked that out \u2014 knocked out tank\nthere. And I knew then something\u2019s wrong up here, we\u2019re just going up here for a\nholiday. But we got up to Mersch and then we headed up north to Ettelbruck.\nWe\u2019re still going riding, riding at night. Ettelbruck, we took the back road above\nEttelbruck, and it circled down around Oberfeulen and we went into\nNiederfeulen. And that\u2019s where we stopped for a couple weeks right there,\nNiederfeulen. And then from Niederfeulen we went to Heiderscheid,\nHeiderscheid, and then there was a lot of towns, small towns around there. Tadler\nand Kehmens(ph). And from there we went to Wiltz. After we hit Wiltz, it was\nmiserable cold. And we\u2019re going up to Buchholz, and that was cold. The wind was\nblowing like crazy. And the town where we stopped, that was it. And they put us\nback on the trucks again, and they took us down south to cross into \u2014 over to the\ncrossing to Depburg. What was the name of that river?\nA2: Sauer river.",
        "A: Sauer river.\nA2: And Diligen(ph).",
        "A: And Diligen(ph), yeah. Diligen\u2019s(ph) where \u2014 where I crossed. And I went back\nover there, first trip when I went back was in \u201972, my wife and I went over. And we\nstopped there at Diligen(ph). It\u2019s a \u2014 where we cr \u2014 where they had the bridge head,\nthat was the \u2014 some farmer. And he was mad at us, even then. Because the\nengineers come in and knocked his barn down to make a crossing. And I still ta \u2014 I\ndidn\u2019t do it, you know? And then, we crossed there, and then into Bitburg, and\ncome back down. Back down, we come back down into \u2014 to Luxembourg, and\nfrom Luxembourg we crossed over the river again, and we stayed over there, that\nsi \u2014 this time, we stayed over there. We went into Saarburg, Saarburg and up to\nthe t-town, little town of Oberzerf. That\u2019s where Turner got his medal, Oberzerf.\nZerf, Zerf.\nA2: Dolle.",
        "A: Dolle?\nA2: Dolle is where he got his Congressional Medal of Honor.",
        "A: Well, who got \u2014 who got the [indecipherable] at Oberzerf?\nA2: I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: Ri-Right there, we crossed there, at Zerf, and Oberzerf was before Zerf. And\nthat\u2019s where they throwed these Screaming Mimis at us, in this town. And it hit the\nGeneral McBride\u2019s Jeep, flattened it flatter than a pancake. And the\ncommunication officer, Officer Dolka(ph), well, anyway, he got his\n[indecipherable] blown off, and that\u2019s the last I saw of that guy. And \u2014 and then we\nwent through the woods to Gemirth(ph), and we stayed in a cellar which was a\ngrocery store above us. And I went down the cellar, that\u2019s where they got all the\nbottles, and the whole platoon stayed down in that cellar that night.",
        "Q: What did you select?",
        "A: They couldn\u2019t get out, we couldn't get out because they was throwing mortar\nshells on us. And so we \u2014 we was drinking schnapps, chasing it down with white\nwine. Don\u2019t ever do it again. And from then on, we went down through the \u2014 those\nwoods, Gemirth(ph), and what was the name of that town? If I had my map here\nI'd tell you. That we went to [indecipherable] and from Kashdra(ph) we went\nnorth to Mainz, crossed the river Mainz and from there up to Kassel. And went up\nto Kassel and \u2014 and then we headed down to Eisenach. Gerdt, Netbray(ph), the \u2014\nAutobahn, on the Autobahn, and we got to Weimar. And it\u2019s four of us in the\npicture there. We just decided we need some drinks and we asked these people in\nWeimar where it was. And the one man says, you go up this road, he says, it\u2019s two\nfarmers up there, and they make good schnapps. So we went up that road, and we\ngot within about three miles of the camp. Now, we didn\u2019t even know the camp was\nthere, we didn't know anything about those camps. They never told us about the\nconcentration camps. And we \u2014 I was driving the truck, we had a three-quarter ton\ntruck, a Dodge, and I was the driver. And I asked Billman, Corporal Billman, I\nsays, do they have monkeys over here? He says no. I says, well look up in them\ntrees. And there was the inmates. They saw us coming first, before we saw them,\nand they went up in the trees to hide. And one of them was Italian, and the guy from\n\u2014 Siberelli(ph) from Altoona, he\u2019s Italian and he can speak the language. We asked\nhim about it, what \u2014 what you\u2019re doing there? And they told us about the camp. We\ndidn\u2019t per \u2014 still didn\u2019t believe them. So we took them up the ca \u2014 road up there.\nWhat\u2019s the name of that mountain up there? Well, anyway, we took them up that\ncamp, and we drove in the front gate. There wasn\u2019t a guard around, in fact they had\ndisappeared about three days before, and the Americans or anything else, six\narmored \u2014 they heard the six armored tanks coming, and they took off. And we\nwent in there, and we saw the sights, we saw the bodies, the piles of bodies were\nright there, and that was it. And it made us kind of mad. I\u2019m gonna speak a little\nrough now. And we stayed there \u2014 we got there on the 11\"\", we stayed there in\nWeimar on the 12\", and the 13\", 14\" we left. We started going east then, we had \u2014\nwas ordered to le-leave. And well, we went back over there, this past year, on the\nHolocaust day. The people, I kept asking them, all over the city, you know, I says,\nyou tell me why you was \u2014 why the camp was there. We didn\u2019t know it was there.\nSo, that made me kind of mad. I just told them, I says, you\u2019re full of shit. I says,\nyour kids were playing up in that camp during the war, the whole time, the kids\nwere up there. They knew it was there. And you could smell it. You could smell it,\nthe camp, from miles away. That\u2019s six miles up there t \u2014 from the downtown, and\nyou could smell it. And so then, when I come th \u2014 was up there on the 12\" of April\nthis year, they had the ceremony about everything up there, and was greeted by this\nman from Ukraine, a Russian. And then when \u2014 when the book I got, it\u2019s in my\ncase here. Okay. Yup, yup. It was \u2014 no, the little black book in the case. Little black\nbook. These are the pictures we took over there. This what my daughter made up.\nThis book I brought over there. It\u2019s in English. That\u2019s got the pictures of everything,\nBuchenwald.",
        "Q: Mr. Brockman, let\u2019s \u2014 let\u2019s back up to the 11\" of April, 1945. You said you\nweren't told about the concentration camps and about their existence. Yet, as you \u2014\nwhen you \u2014 you first made contact, what did you think you were seeing? What did\nyou think you were taking in?",
        "A: The Crystal Night, I read about that before, back here in the States. And I\nalways was a reader, and a history man. And I read about that Crystal Night, and I\njust wondered, you know, why the people let them do that. And you figure you got\na guy with a black mustache on, he\u2019s the boss, period. What he did, what he said,\nwhat he ordered, if you didn\u2019t do it, you \u2014 you were shot, you know. These SS guys\nwill sho \u2014 shoo \u2014 shoot you. I had a run in with a SS man where this picture was\ntaken here of that \u2014 that there. We were talking to those two Polish prisoners. That\nwas in the middle of some town after we left Weimar. That\u2019s where we \u2014 where it\nis. Those guys were walking home from that part of the country to Poland. We told\nhim stay still, you\u2019ll get transportation, you know? No. But anyway, they was in a\nhouse. They were in a, like a slave labor camp. And was four women, three story\nhouse, four women. And this one come down, when we go into the town, she was\ncovered with blood. She had a broken nose, busted jaw, her body was beat up. And\nI says, what happened to you? And she told me. She said, the SS man over there,\nshe says, he tried to rape me. I says, you mean that private, the SS private? He says,\nhe\u2019s not an ess \u2014 he\u2019s not a private, he\u2019s a captain. I says, you\u2019re sure about that? So\nshe called her other girlfriends out of the house, and they says, yes, he\u2019s a captain.\nAnd he beat hell on her, cause he tried to ra-rape her, right then and there. And well,\nhe got four MIs, right quick like. Four of shot him, because he had no right to live.",
        "Q: Were you speaking to the woman in English, or did you have a \u2014",
        "A: How\u2019s that?",
        "Q: Were you speaking to the woman in English, or \u2014",
        "A: English, yeah.",
        "Q: What town was that, do you recall?",
        "A: A town?",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: That \u2014 I don\u2019t re-recall that town. If they bring that \u2014 that book where they took\nthat picture, I would know. But we run across several of them going down si \u2014 when\nwe left \u2014 left \u2014 we left the \u2014 the air \u2014 area there Gera. Now we were south. And we\nran in \u2014 across several of those camps. Labor camps, I mean, there wasn\u2019t the\nkilling then, there was just \u2014",
        "Q: Working.",
        "A: \u2014u-\u2014use their bodies, that\u2019s it. And then we got down to Austria, we stopped at\nthe Enz river, that\u2019s \u2014 couldn\u2019t get no further cause we\u2019re supposed to meet the\nRussians there. They took three or four days getting there. But I \u2014 that \u2014 now, when\nthis first started out, my daughter says, why don\u2019t you go? I says, no, I says, I \u2014I\nsaid, I had enough of it, and I didn't want to be reminded. You don\u2019t lose sight or\ntrack of it in your mind, of what went on over there, during the whole war. You try\nto, try to move everything back here. But di \u2014 you don\u2019t, you can\u2019t. And some\npeople say they do, and I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m aware they\u2019re li \u2014 they can\u2019t. Because it\u2019s\nsomething that happened to you. It turns you. And then, when we got these camps,\nwe got the Buchenwald, we got the other camps, that really turns you off unto the\nGerman people. Although, there\u2019s a town up in \u2014 above Hannover, Germany, it\u2019s\ncalled Brockmanville. Due to the fact we had \u2014 the Brockmans were kicked out of\nEngland way back before th \u2014 it was Crusades times. And they went to Germany,\nlived in Germany for 200 years. And they come back over to England and they\ncome back to England, then from there they went to America. I got a great-great-\ngrandfather \u2014 well, a couple more greats, he\u2019s buried down there in Chester county,\nphi \u2014 Philadelphia. He was buried down there in 1690. That\u2019s how old we are.",
        "Q: Sir, you said it \u2014 th-the whole experience in Buchenwald and the other camps,\ndid it change how you felt about the war, and why you were fighting it, and your\nrole in it?",
        "A: Yes, I \u2014 it did, du-due to the fact that I was always a happy-go-lucky guy, e-even\nduring the war. We got through France, I was still a happy-go-lucky guy. But then\nwhen I saw the Buchenwald, and I saw the bodies, and I saw everything there, it \u2014\nand then you get to thinking about it, it\u201911 change your mind real quick. You\u2019re not a\nhappy-go-lucky guy, you\u2019re a killer then. Even though I was a wireman, I still had\nto get rid of some guys in our way. And, well to this day, my daughter still don\u2019t\nknow. All she knows is [indecipherable], and who was the other woman? And she\nstarted putting everything together. This picture here, this guy, that\u2019s him right\nthere. That was taken on the 12\".",
        "Q: You said it changed \u2014 the experiences in the camp changed the way you felt\nabout the Germans and the German people.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: 317 stayed on a little bit in Germany after the war was officially over. Did you\nstay on as well, for \u2014",
        "A: It was official over on \u2014 on the seventh. May the eighth was the official day. We\npulled out of there, was it the \u2014 was it \u2014 Kurtsdorf(ph), Austria. And then we went\nover to Spital am Pyhrn, Austria. We stayed there, I think about two, three weeks.\nThen we moved down to Fussen, Germany, down that part down there. And I liked\nthat part down there, because that\u2019s where they sent all the women, down there to\nget away from the bombing. So \u2014 but anyway, on June \u2014 June 23\", I think it was, or\n24\"\" | got a letter from my aunt, and she passed away now, but I got a letter from\nmy aunt saying my brother had been killed over in Europe. He was killed on May\nthe 10\". That\u2019s two days after the war he was killed. He was ground crew chief on a\nB17 out of England. And their plane was flying over, dropping Care packages to\nHolland and Belgium. He was dropping Care packages there. An airplane was\ncoming in, another plane was taking off, they come together. Two planes ti \u2014\ncompletely burn up. The only way you could identify him is by his teeth, after the \u2014\nand he was buried in the cemetery, Cambridge, England. And then my uncle was a\ngrange man, and he says, let\u2019s bring him back over to sir \u2014 so we got him arl \u2014 he\u2019s\nburied in Arlington now. And my sister, she was a \u2014 she retired as a lieutenant in\nthe WACs, she spent her time down in Japan when occupation. So then, what did\nupset me about my brother, because they didn\u2019t no \u2014 the government didn\u2019t notify\nme, which they should have. And, we brought him back. But just a lot of things you\n\u2014 people ask me different questions, and then it starts coming back just plain as day.\nAnd I kind of hate that a little bit, because I was trying to forget it. But when I come\nback, I was \u2014 we come back on a Wednesday, but \u2014 see, my daughter had to go with\nme, she had to be my caretaker, you know, on the trip, on that trip. And, well, she\nwanted \u2014 so then, we flew back. We just got back in time when that volcano blew\nits stack over there, out there, you know. And so we made it in time. Well then, the\nnext day, on Thursday, the ra-rabbi from synagogue in Wa-Washington, PA, he\ncalled. And he\u2019s a jolly fellow, real fat. Beard. Very jolly. And don\u2019t ask me his\nname, I can\u2019t remember. He says, would you like \u2014 would you speak in front of the\ncongregation on Friday? I said, all right. So I got over there, I got to talking to him\nbefore he had this \u2014 we had the service on Friday night. And he says \u2014 and he \u2014 he\nmade his talk at the service about us soldiers. He says we should talk and tell about\nthe war. He says, when they don\u2019t, then \u2014 then his whole sermon was about that, we\nshould talk. Well then, he introduced me, and I asked him, I says, how long you\nwant me to talk? He says, about 15 minutes. It was two and a half hours before I got\nout of there. Them people have all ears and everything else. And I passed out there\n\u2014I passed 150 of these out to them. And my daughter got them, where she did I\ndon\u2019t know, don\u2019t ask. But I\u2019m \u2014 so then he called me again, he said, why don\u2019t you\ncome back over and do it again, and he says, we\u2019ll tape it. He got \u2014 so I started,\nfrom the time I went in the service to almost what\u2019s \u2014 I come home. Took two and a\nhalf hours. I didn\u2019t cover all of it, but I cover most of it. And then the \u2014 what was\nthe name of the lady? Sounds like tobacco. Judy, that was it. She called, she wanted\nme and my daughter to come over and have lunch with them. So we went over\nthere. And it\u2019s quite \u2014 quite interesting. Especially doing the service. And the book\nwas in English, so it\u2019s \u2014 songbook. I sang right around with them.",
        "Q: You said \u2014 you said that you did not speak to your daughter about it, did you\nspeak to \u2014 about \u2014 did you speak to anyone in your family about your experiences in\nthe war?",
        "A: I talked to no one.",
        "Q: And why is that?",
        "A: Not even friends, not even when I go down to American Legion or the vets, I\nnever told about war. I never said that word to anybody. And, I had a good friend,\nby the name of Worth, Danny Worth from Washington, PA. Not Washington\nstate. Danny Worth, he\u2019s buried over there in Lorraine cemetery. At Saint Avold,\nhe was killed [indecipherable]. They had an 88 up the road, straight up the road,\nand I told him, I says, we gotta get in this other house, cause they got a better cellar\nin there. It was brick [indecipherable] brick and that. And he never made it. That\n88 come down and took his throat right off. Now here\u2019s a guy that when I go down\nto Columbia, Tennessee \u2014 you know what Columbia, Tennessee is noted for,\nbesides mules? And Lansing, Michigan the same way. They got the prettiest girls\nin the st \u2014 in the cou \u2014 1n the United States there. And I drove a truck to Lansing,\nMichigan before the war, and then \u2014 then I found out. But he would be s \u2014 he\nwould actually blush walking down the street with a girl. That\u2019s the type of man he\nwas. He never swore, he never cussed or anything like that. He was a radioman in\nthe \u2014 in the company, and that \u2014 he\u2019s sitting in the Jeep when a shell come in, took\nhis throat off. He\u2019s buried over there. Now here\u2019s a guy here, he went to church and\nall this. An old reprobate like me is still alive and he\u2019s dead. Can you figure that\nout? Why the good persons go? I can\u2019t.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s back up a bit to your actual training, when you were in training. Do you\nrecall anyone \u2014 do you recall anybody visiting your training camp? Was there\nanybody important who visited your camp?",
        "A: We had the President Roosevelt down there, driving through. We spent three\ndays out in the drill \u2014 drill field putting up a pump that\u2019s \u2014 and everything was lined\nup with a string, all the way down through that whole camp, the whole division,\nthat\u2019s 13,000 men. And he drove through there with that cigar in his mouth, that\ncigarette lighter \u2014 ha \u2014 holder, rather. He drove through that camp, boom, about 90\nmile an hour I would say, you know. And that\u2019s the only one \u2014 so, like that.\nRoosevelt, that\u2019s the only one come down sa \u2014 we saw.",
        "Q: Was that a thrill for you? Did you enjoy seeing him, the president?",
        "A: Well, I\u2019m not a political man, I never liked politics. And, course they got\npoliticians at home now, they\u2019re giving me awards and decorations, by a dozen\nnow. I said \u2014 I just got one from Tim Murphy over here to \u2014 House of\nRepresentatives, and his secretary was there ya \u2014 last night, wasn\u2019t 1t? Yeah, yeah.\nShe was there. And she hand that to me. I says, oh-oh, I says, did Barbara have\nsomething to do with that? That\u2019s my daughter. And she says, yup. And Murphy,\nTim Murphy, because he\u2019s House of Representatives.",
        "Q: \u2019m-\u2014I\u2019m sorry to keep coming back to the issue of the camps, but after having\nseen the camps, labor camps, did it change how you interacted with the German\npeople?",
        "A: I can\u2019t tell that story, no.",
        "Q: Tell us.",
        "A: No. Yes, it did. It changed. Like, we moved in their houses, you got 10 minutes\nto get out of here, we\u2019re taking over. And we had one town in a part of the country\nof \u2014 part of Germany. It\u2019s where the people were ger \u2014 women wear their hair in a\nknot on top of their head. And I think it\u2019s above \u2014 it\u2019s up around Kaiserslautern,\nNeustadt. And this woman says, what are you doing over here to us? We were at\nthe door, told her we will like, take your house, you know, and this. And she says,\nwhat are you doing here? We didn\u2019t ask you to come over here. She never made it.\nShe got a .45. That\u2019s when it start turns. And, if they didn\u2019t get out of our way, we\nknocked them out of our way. And we had to let them know we were soldiers, and\nwe let them know the hard way. We got down to Austria in Spital am Pyhrn. We\ngot in a house down there, and they had room for us, we didn't have to kick them\nout. And the one girl\u2019s name Heidi, very beautiful blonde. And she was \u2014 I\u2019d say\nshe was strictly a Nazi to begin with. Her mother was Swiss, her father was\nGerman, and he owned about two or three blocks of Berlin up there. That\u2019s where\nshe\u2019s born and raised, in Berlin. And I asked her, I says, did you go out there and\nheil this that, heil this, the guy there, and the \u2014 when they had the big parade? She\nsays no, I says, I don\u2019t believe you. Well, we left there and I come home, I got a\nletter from her. And she\u2019s telling about, you know, she\u2019s having rough time. So we\ncollected a box of clothes, and my wife sent her her mother\u2019s je \u2014 coat, with fur\naround there. We sent the clothes over to her. And we was friends with her for all\nthese years. And when we went over there \u2014 I\u2019ve been over there seven times. We\nwent back first time over in \u201972. And we went over there, we would always look her\nup. And she took us into Austria this last time we saw her, and her mother is in a\nnursing home, at that time, I think she\u2019s dead now, in Austria down at \u2014 at\nKitschdorf. She had nice apartment, balcony overlooking the Alps, beautiful view\nfrom across that valley for Kirshdorf there. And it cost her 28 dollars a month to\nstay in that apartment building. And that\u2019s going downstairs to the kitchen to eat,\nyou know, free of charge. But it start \u2014 I started relax a little bit then when I got\nthere, because the war was over then. And \u2014 but she also give me a good wine to\ndrink too, when I want a drink of wine, or \u2014 she give me good wine. That\u2019s why I\nbecome friends with her. [indecipherable] But it\u2019s hard to say, you know, if I could\ndo it over again, I probably would.",
        "Q: Why\u2019?",
        "A: Well, the same situation, everything else, I\u2019d \u2014 being now, do it over again, you\nknow something. You\u2019re a little bit sharper on what\u2019s going on in the world.\n[coughs] Excuse me. Then, when I read that book about the Crystal Night over\nhere, well that start tearing me right then, you know, could people do this? And then\nit started \u2014 the other book I read about the Jewish population over there, how they\nwere be tr-treat like that. And I was never taught to be another nationality, or to be\nmean to them or anything like that. My mother was Irish. If I was \u2014 did anything\nwrong, I got clobbered. I mean, I got the paddle, more than once. And that kind of\nstraightens you up a little bit. But then the \u2014 when the \u2014 is \u2014 in school, when \u201cLife\u201d\nmagazine come out, first come out, and they had some pictures about over here, at\nthat time, and I \u2014 I couldn\u2019t understand it, why people could do that. And that\u2019s\nwhat I told these we \u2014 people from Weimar, I couldn\u2019t understand. That\u2019s where\nHitler got his start, out in Weimar. That the hotel was in, he did his speaker out of\nthe balcony that hotel. That was \u2014 that was nice hotel. My daughter, she don\u2019t eat\nfish. First night was over there, she went like this to the waiter, you know. And she\nsays, I don\u2019t eat fish. Well, he got another plate. Boy, did she get a plate. Everybody\nsays, we want that too. And so that go on for about three days like that, my daughter\ncall him over. If she didn\u2019t like stuff, they\u2019d change it. We got treated royal. So I\ncalled them over, I got my finger going, I called him over one day \u2014 one night. And\nI says, we can have anything, and you\u2019ll get anything for us? Anything you want,\nwe'll get for you. I says, I want a Mercedes van. I says, I want a Mercedes van. I\ndidn\u2019t get it.",
        "Q: Do you remember hag \u2014 receiving your orders to go home?",
        "A: I was down Fiissen, Germany in the in Schwangau-Horn Schwangau, that\u2019s\nwhere I was at, and right below the castle neu, the Neuschwanstein castle. We had\na whole hotel down there to ourselves, our communication wire section. And we\nwas going \u2014 going out on a wire trip, was driving. And they say, Brock. I says,\nwhat? They says, pack up, you\u2019re going home. And it hit me real quick. I was\nsurprised. I thought I was going to Japan. Says no, you\u2019re going home. And to tell\nyou the truth, I was really sad. Those guys were down in that truck, which I had\nbeen driving all that time, and they\u2019re going out on a job, and I\u2019m not going. It upset\nme. I was, I was \u2014 upset me. I never saw them guys until the-they come home. Was\nafter they had families and everything else. This one had about four or five kids.\nSiberelli(ph) had about four or five kids. Billman had three. And I drove up there\nand saw them one time, and that\u2019s the last I saw of them. And one of the guys from\nthe 80\", he said he was from Williamsport. He says, I think Billman\u2019s dead,\nbecause he remembered reading a story about a Billman in the paper. And I know\nSiberelli(ph) probably dead, because he was a big drinker. And Harry Eckrel(ph),\nI don\u2019t know too much about him, cause he was a nut.",
        "Q: What was acti \u2014 what was coming home like when you actually arrived\nstateside?",
        "A: When I come home, I left [indecipherable]. They says come back, come back in\nfive days, there\u2019s too many of us, they couldn\u2019t take care of us. So I went ma \u2014 went\nback to my hometown. You know, I didn\u2019t get a handshake, a greeting? Because I\nwas coming home early, and their husbands were still in the service, they were a\nlittle mad about that. So then I got a job the next day after I was discharged, on\nOctober the 25\". I got \u2014 come home, next day I went and got a job in the mine 160\nfor Consolidated Coal. And I\u2019ve \u2014 a year later I got married, I raised a family. I\ndidn\u2019t cry in the booze about anything \u2014 about anything, cause I got a job. And \u2014\nwhich was a good thing I got that job, cause my wife is handicapped now, she can\u2019t\nwalk. She\u2019s down there now, riding around in an electric wheelchair. She\u2019s no \u2014 has\nno knee on her left leg, it\u2019s a \u2014 it\u2019s 17 inches of steel plates. And she come up to the\nplace I was staying with \u2014 people I was staying with \u2014 my mother died when I was\n16, and I lived with this other cou \u2014 family. And she come up there. She\u2019s a\nhairdresser and she\u2019s dressing this woman\u2019s hair. We become friends, we got\nmarried. Cause the boy where I was staying with, he come home from the service,\nand he had to have a place to stay with his wife, they were si \u2014 raising a family. So,\nI says, we might as well get married. She was a telephone operator, worked out of\nDelaware during the war.",
        "Q: This interview that we\u2019re conducting is \u2014 is for future generations. What would\nyou most like future generations to know about what you experienced?",
        "A: Boy, that\u2019s a rough question. I would like to have them experience that I had, so\nthey know what war is about, then they\u2019Il know. Same experience. Maybe there\nwon\u2019t be no more wars then. If everybody \u2014 everybody knows about them. But\nwe're not \u2014 we\u2019re not go \u2014 we\u2019re gonna have wars, always. We\u2019ve got it right now\no-over there now. Now we got to worry about China. They\u2019ve got a rocket going\noff and it goes 900 mile, knock out a ship out, out in the middle of the ocean. What\nare they gonna do about that?",
        "Q: Is there anything you\u2019d like to say in closing, sir? Is there anything you\u2019d like to\nsay in closing?",
        "A: Oh, I don\u2019t know. Like this rabbi says, you should talk about it. If I had some\nmaps here, you\u2019d be here a couple days. So I\u2019ll s \u2014 Ill say to each and everybody\nelse, stay out of the war. That\u2019s the only thing I can say, stay away from war. It\ndon\u2019t do you any good. Physically, and mentally, it knocks ya. And you think\nsometimes you might forget about it, but then something happens, or you read\nsomething in the paper, or a magazine, it brings the memory back again. Course in\nmy house, I\u2019ve got books after books about the war. And DVDs, now it\u2019s DVDs,\nand I got a big stack of them. But they, like Barbara said, my daughter says, you\nnever tell me anything about the war. [indecipherable] I got the books, and the\nDVDs and all that, reading about it today. I watch everything that\u2019s on TV about\nthe war. War as I knew it and everything else, those programs. And I cuss some of\nthem, I says \u2014 that was my big mistake, you know. It was a big mistake in certain\nparts of the battle. When we crossed the Moselle river, we lost all those men due to\nthe fact one man, he come down from division and he ordered a third battalion to go\nand attack at three o\u2019clock in the afternoon. You don\u2019t go and attack three o\u2019clock\nin the afternoon, you wait til morning or night. Broad daylight he ordered attack\nthird battalion go in there. Colonel Roberts. He blamed \u2014 blamed the big wheels for\nthat. He\u2019s dead. And there\u2019s certain instance like that happened during the battle,\nthe whole time. The mistakes they made, I don\u2019t care if [indecipherable] was\nO.C.S., come out of there, in 90 day wonders. You wonder how they got that, the\nrank. And they didn\u2019t know any better what I \u2014 what I know. Cause I had a high\nI.Q. When I went in to the \u2014 took the I.Q. exam out of Fort Mead, mine was very\nhigh. They says, oh you\u2019re \u2014 you\u2019re goo \u2014 eligible to go to O.C.S. And the one\nsergeant says, well, you can\u2019t go, you got glasses. Well, you see this medal right\nhere, the one in the middle?",
        "Q: Yes, sir.",
        "A: That\u2019s a Good Conduct Medal. I got that the last day I was discharged. The\nsergeant says, you don\u2019t have a Good Conduct Medal, I says, no, I wasn\u2019t too good.",
        "Q: We thank you for the interview, sir.",
        "A: Yeah, I \u2014",
        "Q: Thank you very much.",
        "A: I still say that \u2014 that we have the leadership, we won\u2019t have this trouble. But we\ndon\u2019t \u2014 we don\u2019t have our leadership any more. If we had good leadership 1n \u2014 in \u2014\nover there in Congress and that. They\u2019re sitting on their butts, that\u2019s it, they\u2019re not\ndoing anything. We\u2019re going to get into it somepla \u2014 I guess. It\u2019s gonna happen. I\ndon\u2019t know, I\u2019m 90 now, and I \u2014 I won\u2019t \u2014 probably won\u2019t be around to see it.

        "A: Well, at that time, we\u2019re young. And when they bombed Pearl Harbor, made us\nkind of mad. We took it as a joke, tell you the truth. And we \u2014 and after we started\nreading stories about it, and stories about \u2014 about Germany, and it turned us,\nstarted turn us. And, when the \u2014 I went in there, down to Camp Forrest, Tennessee,\nwent through training down there. Then I went through training up at f-fort - Camp\nS-Salano(ph), Kansas, up at Camp Phillips. From there we sent us out to Yuma,\nArizona to desert training. Then they sent us to New Jersey.

And\nthen \u2014 [background voices] Yeah, 15\u201c of August, that\u2019s when I got over there.\nThat prepared us, I think, that year and a half, compared to what they\u2019re training\nnow, you know, weeks. They\u2019re not getting enough training. And \u2014 and we got in\nFrance, and we do \u2014 was in the war.",

And actually, the training was\nenough, cause we knew how to string a line, we knew how to make ties in the line\nfor communications, and go out and repair them after they get \u2014 get shot up or\nbroken up, and that\u2019s what we did.",
        "A: First combat experience, I took a Polish prisoner, first day. He was wearing a\nwine colored suit. He was a \u2014 he was operating a machine gun. He wasn\u2019t pulling\nthe trigger, he was just loading them. And the SS officer was about 50 to 75 yards\nin back of him, with a string tied to the trigger of the machine gun, and he pulls \u2014\npulls the string for that machine gun to operate. And these guys were supposed to\nstay there and load it up when it\u2019s empty, load it up. If they didn\u2019t, he\u2019d shoot them.\nAnd the \u2014 this man come out of the woods there, put his hands up when he saw me.\nAnd so I called the \u2014 our sergeant, pa \u2014 Sawyer. He was from Sewickly, he was\nPolish. I says, what\u2019s he talking about? Well, he says, he\u2019s been in that \u2014 been in\nthat position for two days now with no water and he wants a drink. He says, don\u2019t\ngive him anything. I gave him a slug of water out of my canteen, and he was very\ngrateful for it. And that was my first combat experience right there.",
        "A: How\u2019s that?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: We crossed the Moselle on September the 12\", and that was mean and nasty\nfighting down there. And that\u2019s where I got the Bronze Star first \u2014 I mean, first\ntime. And what happened was, they put us down in a defensive position at\nDilliard(ph). As a \u2014 right above a church, a ro \u2014 dirt road went up the church, went\nup the OP. And they had shelled the OP, and quite a few of them were killed up\nthere. And they\u2019re sending an ambulance up there. And they told us that the \u2014 we\nhad to stay there 1n this position. So I start digging a little bit. And the first time the\n88 come in, and I digging \u2014 started digging faster, you know, I was really shoveling\ndirt there. What happened was that that, they had notified the guys in back of me, I\nwas a\u2014 oh, about \u2014 about 50 yards in front of them. And they rolled back under a\nbig apple tree, and I was out in that bend in the road that goes up the hill. A Dilliard\nthere from Dilliard. And I happened to look across the field, here come a German\npatr \u2014 patrol across the field. And there wasn\u2019t supposed to be a German on that\nside of the river. I saw they\u2019re getting close, closer and closer to our position, and I\nstart cutting loose at them when they got too close.",
        "A: The M1",
        "A: M1.",
        "A: The \u2014 the \u2014 the full [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yeah. And then I knocked off the last three in that patrol, there was\napproximately nine of them. And I knocked off the last three, and I thought, it\u2019s\nfunny, I don\u2019t hear no shots behind me. Here what happened was the sergeant come\nup and ordered the men under the tree to fall back. And they forgot to tell me when\nI was up there digging. And that really made me mad.",
        "A: They left me there by myself. I knocked off the first three, and the rest of them\ngave \u2014 saw the three were being knocked off, they disappeared. And to this day,\nwhen I talk to Felix, he was down in a building in there, and they said he\u2019s \u2014 he said\nit\u2019s all the same patrol. That\u2019s another \u2014 he\u2019s over there, and so then, actually, I\nwasn\u2019t supposed to be doing that work. I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m a\u2014 I\u2019m a wireman, but I had to\ndefend my position, and I did. And not only it happened then, it happened during\nthe whole war, especially in the Battle of the Bulge. And from then on, when we \u2014\nwell, after \u2014 after Argentan, Argentan-Falaise Gap, that battle up there in France,\nthat was the beginning of it, and then when he got to Moselle river, which driving\nacross France, you know, 50 - 60 mile an hour, how fast you want to go, until we\ngot to Orleans. And I got a picture of G Company in Orleans. Did you ever see\nthat picture? One guy was carrying a sniper rifle. And then the [indecipherable] got\nto Moselle, that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s where what, 317\" lost 300 and some \u2014 365 men, wasn\u2019t\nit? Across that river.\nA2: The battalion, the battalion.",
        "A: Huh?\nA2: The battalion lost that.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, we lost 365 men right there at crossing. And which I thought, and\nsome others too say [indecipherable] you know. Back in \u2014 back before this war\nstarted, when I was in school, I studied history. My family goes back as far as the\nyear 1205. I\u2019m entitled to wear a deer\u2019s head [indecipherable] with a dagger\nthrough his head. You know what that means? It means your ancestors fought 1n the\nCrusades. And I had a relative fight in all wars, from [indecipherable] World War,\nCivil War, Spanish War, American war, and the \u2014 like, I had a uncle \u2014 great-uncle\nwas killed in World War I. He got the DSO for what he did, but he died for it. He\nrescued two of his buddies out on the field, and he got machine-gunned. And they \u2014\nthey named a street down in Fort Benning, Brockman Way, because he got the\nDSO. And \u2014 so our family\u2019s been in a \u2014 wars, all wars.",
        "A: Cold, cold, let\u2019s put it that way. We were gonna left \u2014 I was gonna head to \u2014 was\nheading to Beechy, out of Saint Avold, France. We got down there about 11\no\u2019clock at night, and we was to go across into Beechy, Germany there. And they\nsaid, never mind. There\u2019s trucks up there, get on them, you\u2019re going for a long ride.\nSo we took the long ride up to Luxembourg, a hundred \u2014 hundred mile way. And\nthe first stop in Luxembourg, there\u2019s a bend in the road going from Luxembourg\ncity, up to Mersch. There\u2019s a big bend road. The \u2014 in the middle of that bend is a \u2014\nis a bar, a caf\u00e9. And that\u2019s when we first got our first booze in Luxembourg. We\ngot Luxembourg \u2014 Mersch, the town of Mersch, top the hill Mersch was a\nknocked out German tank \u2014 I don\u2019t know who knocked that out \u2014 knocked out tank\nthere. And I knew then something\u2019s wrong up here, we\u2019re just going up here for a\nholiday. But we got up to Mersch and then we headed up north to Ettelbruck.\nWe\u2019re still going riding, riding at night. Ettelbruck, we took the back road above\nEttelbruck, and it circled down around Oberfeulen and we went into\nNiederfeulen. And that\u2019s where we stopped for a couple weeks right there,\nNiederfeulen. And then from Niederfeulen we went to Heiderscheid,\nHeiderscheid, and then there was a lot of towns, small towns around there. Tadler\nand Kehmens(ph). And from there we went to Wiltz. After we hit Wiltz, it was\nmiserable cold. And we\u2019re going up to Buchholz, and that was cold. The wind was\nblowing like crazy. And the town where we stopped, that was it. And they put us\nback on the trucks again, and they took us down south to cross into \u2014 over to the\ncrossing to Depburg. What was the name of that river?\nA2: Sauer river.",
        "A: Sauer river.\nA2: And Diligen(ph).",
        "A: And Diligen(ph), yeah. Diligen\u2019s(ph) where \u2014 where I crossed. And I went back\nover there, first trip when I went back was in \u201972, my wife and I went over. And we\nstopped there at Diligen(ph). It\u2019s a \u2014 where we cr \u2014 where they had the bridge head,\nthat was the \u2014 some farmer. And he was mad at us, even then. Because the\nengineers come in and knocked his barn down to make a crossing. And I still ta \u2014 I\ndidn\u2019t do it, you know? And then, we crossed there, and then into Bitburg, and\ncome back down. Back down, we come back down into \u2014 to Luxembourg, and\nfrom Luxembourg we crossed over the river again, and we stayed over there, that\nsi \u2014 this time, we stayed over there. We went into Saarburg, Saarburg and up to\nthe t-town, little town of Oberzerf. That\u2019s where Turner got his medal, Oberzerf.\nZerf, Zerf.\nA2: Dolle.",
        "A: Dolle?\nA2: Dolle is where he got his Congressional Medal of Honor.",
        "A: Well, who got \u2014 who got the [indecipherable] at Oberzerf?\nA2: I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: Ri-Right there, we crossed there, at Zerf, and Oberzerf was before Zerf. And\nthat\u2019s where they throwed these Screaming Mimis at us, in this town. And it hit the\nGeneral McBride\u2019s Jeep, flattened it flatter than a pancake. And the\ncommunication officer, Officer Dolka(ph), well, anyway, he got his\n[indecipherable] blown off, and that\u2019s the last I saw of that guy. And \u2014 and then we\nwent through the woods to Gemirth(ph), and we stayed in a cellar which was a\ngrocery store above us. And I went down the cellar, that\u2019s where they got all the\nbottles, and the whole platoon stayed down in that cellar that night.",
        "A: They couldn\u2019t get out, we couldn't get out because they was throwing mortar\nshells on us. And so we \u2014 we was drinking schnapps, chasing it down with white\nwine. Don\u2019t ever do it again. And from then on, we went down through the \u2014 those\nwoods, Gemirth(ph), and what was the name of that town? If I had my map here\nI'd tell you. That we went to [indecipherable] and from Kashdra(ph) we went\nnorth to Mainz, crossed the river Mainz and from there up to Kassel. And went up\nto Kassel and \u2014 and then we headed down to Eisenach. Gerdt, Netbray(ph), the \u2014\nAutobahn, on the Autobahn, and we got to Weimar. And it\u2019s four of us in the\npicture there. We just decided we need some drinks and we asked these people in\nWeimar where it was. And the one man says, you go up this road, he says, it\u2019s two\nfarmers up there, and they make good schnapps. So we went up that road, and we\ngot within about three miles of the camp. Now, we didn\u2019t even know the camp was\nthere, we didn't know anything about those camps. They never told us about the\nconcentration camps. And we \u2014 I was driving the truck, we had a three-quarter ton\ntruck, a Dodge, and I was the driver. And I asked Billman, Corporal Billman, I\nsays, do they have monkeys over here? He says no. I says, well look up in them\ntrees. And there was the inmates. They saw us coming first, before we saw them,\nand they went up in the trees to hide. And one of them was Italian, and the guy from\n\u2014 Siberelli(ph) from Altoona, he\u2019s Italian and he can speak the language. We asked\nhim about it, what \u2014 what you\u2019re doing there? And they told us about the camp. We\ndidn\u2019t per \u2014 still didn\u2019t believe them. So we took them up the ca \u2014 road up there.\nWhat\u2019s the name of that mountain up there? Well, anyway, we took them up that\ncamp, and we drove in the front gate. There wasn\u2019t a guard around, in fact they had\ndisappeared about three days before, and the Americans or anything else, six\narmored \u2014 they heard the six armored tanks coming, and they took off. And we\nwent in there, and we saw the sights, we saw the bodies, the piles of bodies were\nright there, and that was it. And it made us kind of mad. I\u2019m gonna speak a little\nrough now. And we stayed there \u2014 we got there on the 11\"\", we stayed there in\nWeimar on the 12\", and the 13\", 14\" we left. We started going east then, we had \u2014\nwas ordered to le-leave. And well, we went back over there, this past year, on the\nHolocaust day. The people, I kept asking them, all over the city, you know, I says,\nyou tell me why you was \u2014 why the camp was there. We didn\u2019t know it was there.\nSo, that made me kind of mad. I just told them, I says, you\u2019re full of shit. I says,\nyour kids were playing up in that camp during the war, the whole time, the kids\nwere up there. They knew it was there. And you could smell it. You could smell it,\nthe camp, from miles away. That\u2019s six miles up there t \u2014 from the downtown, and\nyou could smell it. And so then, when I come th \u2014 was up there on the 12\" of April\nthis year, they had the ceremony about everything up there, and was greeted by this\nman from Ukraine, a Russian. And then when \u2014 when the book I got, it\u2019s in my\ncase here. Okay. Yup, yup. It was \u2014 no, the little black book in the case. Little black\nbook. These are the pictures we took over there. This what my daughter made up.\nThis book I brought over there. It\u2019s in English. That\u2019s got the pictures of everything,\nBuchenwald.",
        "A: The Crystal Night, I read about that before, back here in the States. And I\nalways was a reader, and a history man. And I read about that Crystal Night, and I\njust wondered, you know, why the people let them do that. And you figure you got\na guy with a black mustache on, he\u2019s the boss, period. What he did, what he said,\nwhat he ordered, if you didn\u2019t do it, you \u2014 you were shot, you know. These SS guys\nwill sho \u2014 shoo \u2014 shoot you. I had a run in with a SS man where this picture was\ntaken here of that \u2014 that there. We were talking to those two Polish prisoners. That\nwas in the middle of some town after we left Weimar. That\u2019s where we \u2014 where it\nis. Those guys were walking home from that part of the country to Poland. We told\nhim stay still, you\u2019ll get transportation, you know? No. But anyway, they was in a\nhouse. They were in a, like a slave labor camp. And was four women, three story\nhouse, four women. And this one come down, when we go into the town, she was\ncovered with blood. She had a broken nose, busted jaw, her body was beat up. And\nI says, what happened to you? And she told me. She said, the SS man over there,\nshe says, he tried to rape me. I says, you mean that private, the SS private? He says,\nhe\u2019s not an ess \u2014 he\u2019s not a private, he\u2019s a captain. I says, you\u2019re sure about that? So\nshe called her other girlfriends out of the house, and they says, yes, he\u2019s a captain.\nAnd he beat hell on her, cause he tried to ra-rape her, right then and there. And well,\nhe got four MIs, right quick like. Four of shot him, because he had no right to live.",
        "A: How\u2019s that?",
        "A: English, yeah.",
        "A: A town?",
        "A: That \u2014 I don\u2019t re-recall that town. If they bring that \u2014 that book where they took\nthat picture, I would know. But we run across several of them going down si \u2014 when\nwe left \u2014 left \u2014 we left the \u2014 the air \u2014 area there Gera. Now we were south. And we\nran in \u2014 across several of those camps. Labor camps, I mean, there wasn\u2019t the\nkilling then, there was just \u2014",
        "A: \u2014u-\u2014use their bodies, that\u2019s it. And then we got down to Austria, we stopped at\nthe Enz river, that\u2019s \u2014 couldn\u2019t get no further cause we\u2019re supposed to meet the\nRussians there. They took three or four days getting there. But I \u2014 that \u2014 now, when\nthis first started out, my daughter says, why don\u2019t you go? I says, no, I says, I \u2014I\nsaid, I had enough of it, and I didn't want to be reminded. You don\u2019t lose sight or\ntrack of it in your mind, of what went on over there, during the whole war. You try\nto, try to move everything back here. But di \u2014 you don\u2019t, you can\u2019t. And some\npeople say they do, and I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m aware they\u2019re li \u2014 they can\u2019t. Because it\u2019s\nsomething that happened to you. It turns you. And then, when we got these camps,\nwe got the Buchenwald, we got the other camps, that really turns you off unto the\nGerman people. Although, there\u2019s a town up in \u2014 above Hannover, Germany, it\u2019s\ncalled Brockmanville. Due to the fact we had \u2014 the Brockmans were kicked out of\nEngland way back before th \u2014 it was Crusades times. And they went to Germany,\nlived in Germany for 200 years. And they come back over to England and they\ncome back to England, then from there they went to America. I got a great-great-\ngrandfather \u2014 well, a couple more greats, he\u2019s buried down there in Chester county,\nphi \u2014 Philadelphia. He was buried down there in 1690. That\u2019s how old we are.",
        "A: Yes, I \u2014 it did, du-due to the fact that I was always a happy-go-lucky guy, e-even\nduring the war. We got through France, I was still a happy-go-lucky guy. But then\nwhen I saw the Buchenwald, and I saw the bodies, and I saw everything there, it \u2014\nand then you get to thinking about it, it\u201911 change your mind real quick. You\u2019re not a\nhappy-go-lucky guy, you\u2019re a killer then. Even though I was a wireman, I still had\nto get rid of some guys in our way. And, well to this day, my daughter still don\u2019t\nknow. All she knows is [indecipherable], and who was the other woman? And she\nstarted putting everything together. This picture here, this guy, that\u2019s him right\nthere. That was taken on the 12\".",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: It was official over on \u2014 on the seventh. May the eighth was the official day. We\npulled out of there, was it the \u2014 was it \u2014 Kurtsdorf(ph), Austria. And then we went\nover to Spital am Pyhrn, Austria. We stayed there, I think about two, three weeks.\nThen we moved down to Fussen, Germany, down that part down there. And I liked\nthat part down there, because that\u2019s where they sent all the women, down there to\nget away from the bombing. So \u2014 but anyway, on June \u2014 June 23\", I think it was, or\n24\"\" | got a letter from my aunt, and she passed away now, but I got a letter from\nmy aunt saying my brother had been killed over in Europe. He was killed on May\nthe 10\". That\u2019s two days after the war he was killed. He was ground crew chief on a\nB17 out of England. And their plane was flying over, dropping Care packages to\nHolland and Belgium. He was dropping Care packages there. An airplane was\ncoming in, another plane was taking off, they come together. Two planes ti \u2014\ncompletely burn up. The only way you could identify him is by his teeth, after the \u2014\nand he was buried in the cemetery, Cambridge, England. And then my uncle was a\ngrange man, and he says, let\u2019s bring him back over to sir \u2014 so we got him arl \u2014 he\u2019s\nburied in Arlington now. And my sister, she was a \u2014 she retired as a lieutenant in\nthe WACs, she spent her time down in Japan when occupation. So then, what did\nupset me about my brother, because they didn\u2019t no \u2014 the government didn\u2019t notify\nme, which they should have. And, we brought him back. But just a lot of things you\n\u2014 people ask me different questions, and then it starts coming back just plain as day.\nAnd I kind of hate that a little bit, because I was trying to forget it. But when I come\nback, I was \u2014 we come back on a Wednesday, but \u2014 see, my daughter had to go with\nme, she had to be my caretaker, you know, on the trip, on that trip. And, well, she\nwanted \u2014 so then, we flew back. We just got back in time when that volcano blew\nits stack over there, out there, you know. And so we made it in time. Well then, the\nnext day, on Thursday, the ra-rabbi from synagogue in Wa-Washington, PA, he\ncalled. And he\u2019s a jolly fellow, real fat. Beard. Very jolly. And don\u2019t ask me his\nname, I can\u2019t remember. He says, would you like \u2014 would you speak in front of the\ncongregation on Friday? I said, all right. So I got over there, I got to talking to him\nbefore he had this \u2014 we had the service on Friday night. And he says \u2014 and he \u2014 he\nmade his talk at the service about us soldiers. He says we should talk and tell about\nthe war. He says, when they don\u2019t, then \u2014 then his whole sermon was about that, we\nshould talk. Well then, he introduced me, and I asked him, I says, how long you\nwant me to talk? He says, about 15 minutes. It was two and a half hours before I got\nout of there. Them people have all ears and everything else. And I passed out there\n\u2014I passed 150 of these out to them. And my daughter got them, where she did I\ndon\u2019t know, don\u2019t ask. But I\u2019m \u2014 so then he called me again, he said, why don\u2019t you\ncome back over and do it again, and he says, we\u2019ll tape it. He got \u2014 so I started,\nfrom the time I went in the service to almost what\u2019s \u2014 I come home. Took two and a\nhalf hours. I didn\u2019t cover all of it, but I cover most of it. And then the \u2014 what was\nthe name of the lady? Sounds like tobacco. Judy, that was it. She called, she wanted\nme and my daughter to come over and have lunch with them. So we went over\nthere. And it\u2019s quite \u2014 quite interesting. Especially doing the service. And the book\nwas in English, so it\u2019s \u2014 songbook. I sang right around with them.",
        "A: I talked to no one.",
        "A: Not even friends, not even when I go down to American Legion or the vets, I\nnever told about war. I never said that word to anybody. And, I had a good friend,\nby the name of Worth, Danny Worth from Washington, PA. Not Washington\nstate. Danny Worth, he\u2019s buried over there in Lorraine cemetery. At Saint Avold,\nhe was killed [indecipherable]. They had an 88 up the road, straight up the road,\nand I told him, I says, we gotta get in this other house, cause they got a better cellar\nin there. It was brick [indecipherable] brick and that. And he never made it. That\n88 come down and took his throat right off. Now here\u2019s a guy that when I go down\nto Columbia, Tennessee \u2014 you know what Columbia, Tennessee is noted for,\nbesides mules? And Lansing, Michigan the same way. They got the prettiest girls\nin the st \u2014 in the cou \u2014 1n the United States there. And I drove a truck to Lansing,\nMichigan before the war, and then \u2014 then I found out. But he would be s \u2014 he\nwould actually blush walking down the street with a girl. That\u2019s the type of man he\nwas. He never swore, he never cussed or anything like that. He was a radioman in\nthe \u2014 in the company, and that \u2014 he\u2019s sitting in the Jeep when a shell come in, took\nhis throat off. He\u2019s buried over there. Now here\u2019s a guy here, he went to church and\nall this. An old reprobate like me is still alive and he\u2019s dead. Can you figure that\nout? Why the good persons go? I can\u2019t.",
        "A: We had the President Roosevelt down there, driving through. We spent three\ndays out in the drill \u2014 drill field putting up a pump that\u2019s \u2014 and everything was lined\nup with a string, all the way down through that whole camp, the whole division,\nthat\u2019s 13,000 men. And he drove through there with that cigar in his mouth, that\ncigarette lighter \u2014 ha \u2014 holder, rather. He drove through that camp, boom, about 90\nmile an hour I would say, you know. And that\u2019s the only one \u2014 so, like that.\nRoosevelt, that\u2019s the only one come down sa \u2014 we saw.",
        "A: Well, I\u2019m not a political man, I never liked politics. And, course they got\npoliticians at home now, they\u2019re giving me awards and decorations, by a dozen\nnow. I said \u2014 I just got one from Tim Murphy over here to \u2014 House of\nRepresentatives, and his secretary was there ya \u2014 last night, wasn\u2019t 1t? Yeah, yeah.\nShe was there. And she hand that to me. I says, oh-oh, I says, did Barbara have\nsomething to do with that? That\u2019s my daughter. And she says, yup. And Murphy,\nTim Murphy, because he\u2019s House of Representatives.",
        "A: I can\u2019t tell that story, no.",
        "A: No. Yes, it did. It changed. Like, we moved in their houses, you got 10 minutes\nto get out of here, we\u2019re taking over. And we had one town in a part of the country\nof \u2014 part of Germany. It\u2019s where the people were ger \u2014 women wear their hair in a\nknot on top of their head. And I think it\u2019s above \u2014 it\u2019s up around Kaiserslautern,\nNeustadt. And this woman says, what are you doing over here to us? We were at\nthe door, told her we will like, take your house, you know, and this. And she says,\nwhat are you doing here? We didn\u2019t ask you to come over here. She never made it.\nShe got a .45. That\u2019s when it start turns. And, if they didn\u2019t get out of our way, we\nknocked them out of our way. And we had to let them know we were soldiers, and\nwe let them know the hard way. We got down to Austria in Spital am Pyhrn. We\ngot in a house down there, and they had room for us, we didn't have to kick them\nout. And the one girl\u2019s name Heidi, very beautiful blonde. And she was \u2014 I\u2019d say\nshe was strictly a Nazi to begin with. Her mother was Swiss, her father was\nGerman, and he owned about two or three blocks of Berlin up there. That\u2019s where\nshe\u2019s born and raised, in Berlin. And I asked her, I says, did you go out there and\nheil this that, heil this, the guy there, and the \u2014 when they had the big parade? She\nsays no, I says, I don\u2019t believe you. Well, we left there and I come home, I got a\nletter from her. And she\u2019s telling about, you know, she\u2019s having rough time. So we\ncollected a box of clothes, and my wife sent her her mother\u2019s je \u2014 coat, with fur\naround there. We sent the clothes over to her. And we was friends with her for all\nthese years. And when we went over there \u2014 I\u2019ve been over there seven times. We\nwent back first time over in \u201972. And we went over there, we would always look her\nup. And she took us into Austria this last time we saw her, and her mother is in a\nnursing home, at that time, I think she\u2019s dead now, in Austria down at \u2014 at\nKitschdorf. She had nice apartment, balcony overlooking the Alps, beautiful view\nfrom across that valley for Kirshdorf there. And it cost her 28 dollars a month to\nstay in that apartment building. And that\u2019s going downstairs to the kitchen to eat,\nyou know, free of charge. But it start \u2014 I started relax a little bit then when I got\nthere, because the war was over then. And \u2014 but she also give me a good wine to\ndrink too, when I want a drink of wine, or \u2014 she give me good wine. That\u2019s why I\nbecome friends with her. [indecipherable] But it\u2019s hard to say, you know, if I could\ndo it over again, I probably would.",
        "A: Well, the same situation, everything else, I\u2019d \u2014 being now, do it over again, you\nknow something. You\u2019re a little bit sharper on what\u2019s going on in the world.\n[coughs] Excuse me. Then, when I read that book about the Crystal Night over\nhere, well that start tearing me right then, you know, could people do this? And then\nit started \u2014 the other book I read about the Jewish population over there, how they\nwere be tr-treat like that. And I was never taught to be another nationality, or to be\nmean to them or anything like that. My mother was Irish. If I was \u2014 did anything\nwrong, I got clobbered. I mean, I got the paddle, more than once. And that kind of\nstraightens you up a little bit. But then the \u2014 when the \u2014 is \u2014 in school, when \u201cLife\u201d\nmagazine come out, first come out, and they had some pictures about over here, at\nthat time, and I \u2014 I couldn\u2019t understand it, why people could do that. And that\u2019s\nwhat I told these we \u2014 people from Weimar, I couldn\u2019t understand. That\u2019s where\nHitler got his start, out in Weimar. That the hotel was in, he did his speaker out of\nthe balcony that hotel. That was \u2014 that was nice hotel. My daughter, she don\u2019t eat\nfish. First night was over there, she went like this to the waiter, you know. And she\nsays, I don\u2019t eat fish. Well, he got another plate. Boy, did she get a plate. Everybody\nsays, we want that too. And so that go on for about three days like that, my daughter\ncall him over. If she didn\u2019t like stuff, they\u2019d change it. We got treated royal. So I\ncalled them over, I got my finger going, I called him over one day \u2014 one night. And\nI says, we can have anything, and you\u2019ll get anything for us? Anything you want,\nwe'll get for you. I says, I want a Mercedes van. I says, I want a Mercedes van. I\ndidn\u2019t get it.",
        "A: I was down Fiissen, Germany in the in Schwangau-Horn Schwangau, that\u2019s\nwhere I was at, and right below the castle neu, the Neuschwanstein castle. We had\na whole hotel down there to ourselves, our communication wire section. And we\nwas going \u2014 going out on a wire trip, was driving. And they say, Brock. I says,\nwhat? They says, pack up, you\u2019re going home. And it hit me real quick. I was\nsurprised. I thought I was going to Japan. Says no, you\u2019re going home. And to tell\nyou the truth, I was really sad. Those guys were down in that truck, which I had\nbeen driving all that time, and they\u2019re going out on a job, and I\u2019m not going. It upset\nme. I was, I was \u2014 upset me. I never saw them guys until the-they come home. Was\nafter they had families and everything else. This one had about four or five kids.\nSiberelli(ph) had about four or five kids. Billman had three. And I drove up there\nand saw them one time, and that\u2019s the last I saw of them. And one of the guys from\nthe 80\", he said he was from Williamsport. He says, I think Billman\u2019s dead,\nbecause he remembered reading a story about a Billman in the paper. And I know\nSiberelli(ph) probably dead, because he was a big drinker. And Harry Eckrel(ph),\nI don\u2019t know too much about him, cause he was a nut.",
        "A: When I come home, I left [indecipherable]. They says come back, come back in\nfive days, there\u2019s too many of us, they couldn\u2019t take care of us. So I went ma \u2014 went\nback to my hometown. You know, I didn\u2019t get a handshake, a greeting? Because I\nwas coming home early, and their husbands were still in the service, they were a\nlittle mad about that. So then I got a job the next day after I was discharged, on\nOctober the 25\". I got \u2014 come home, next day I went and got a job in the mine 160\nfor Consolidated Coal. And I\u2019ve \u2014 a year later I got married, I raised a family. I\ndidn\u2019t cry in the booze about anything \u2014 about anything, cause I got a job. And \u2014\nwhich was a good thing I got that job, cause my wife is handicapped now, she can\u2019t\nwalk. She\u2019s down there now, riding around in an electric wheelchair. She\u2019s no \u2014 has\nno knee on her left leg, it\u2019s a \u2014 it\u2019s 17 inches of steel plates. And she come up to the\nplace I was staying with \u2014 people I was staying with \u2014 my mother died when I was\n16, and I lived with this other cou \u2014 family. And she come up there. She\u2019s a\nhairdresser and she\u2019s dressing this woman\u2019s hair. We become friends, we got\nmarried. Cause the boy where I was staying with, he come home from the service,\nand he had to have a place to stay with his wife, they were si \u2014 raising a family. So,\nI says, we might as well get married. She was a telephone operator, worked out of\nDelaware during the war.",
        "A: Boy, that\u2019s a rough question. I would like to have them experience that I had, so\nthey know what war is about, then they\u2019Il know. Same experience. Maybe there\nwon\u2019t be no more wars then. If everybody \u2014 everybody knows about them. But\nwe're not \u2014 we\u2019re not go \u2014 we\u2019re gonna have wars, always. We\u2019ve got it right now\no-over there now. Now we got to worry about China. They\u2019ve got a rocket going\noff and it goes 900 mile, knock out a ship out, out in the middle of the ocean. What\nare they gonna do about that?",
        "A: Oh, I don\u2019t know. Like this rabbi says, you should talk about it. If I had some\nmaps here, you\u2019d be here a couple days. So I\u2019ll s \u2014 Ill say to each and everybody\nelse, stay out of the war. That\u2019s the only thing I can say, stay away from war. It\ndon\u2019t do you any good. Physically, and mentally, it knocks ya. And you think\nsometimes you might forget about it, but then something happens, or you read\nsomething in the paper, or a magazine, it brings the memory back again. Course in\nmy house, I\u2019ve got books after books about the war. And DVDs, now it\u2019s DVDs,\nand I got a big stack of them. But they, like Barbara said, my daughter says, you\nnever tell me anything about the war. [indecipherable] I got the books, and the\nDVDs and all that, reading about it today. I watch everything that\u2019s on TV about\nthe war. War as I knew it and everything else, those programs. And I cuss some of\nthem, I says \u2014 that was my big mistake, you know. It was a big mistake in certain\nparts of the battle. When we crossed the Moselle river, we lost all those men due to\nthe fact one man, he come down from division and he ordered a third battalion to go\nand attack at three o\u2019clock in the afternoon. You don\u2019t go and attack three o\u2019clock\nin the afternoon, you wait til morning or night. Broad daylight he ordered attack\nthird battalion go in there. Colonel Roberts. He blamed \u2014 blamed the big wheels for\nthat. He\u2019s dead. And there\u2019s certain instance like that happened during the battle,\nthe whole time. The mistakes they made, I don\u2019t care if [indecipherable] was\nO.C.S., come out of there, in 90 day wonders. You wonder how they got that, the\nrank. And they didn\u2019t know any better what I \u2014 what I know. Cause I had a high\nI.Q. When I went in to the \u2014 took the I.Q. exam out of Fort Mead, mine was very\nhigh. They says, oh you\u2019re \u2014 you\u2019re goo \u2014 eligible to go to O.C.S. And the one\nsergeant says, well, you can\u2019t go, you got glasses. Well, you see this medal right\nhere, the one in the middle?",
        "A: That\u2019s a Good Conduct Medal. I got that the last day I was discharged. The\nsergeant says, you don\u2019t have a Good Conduct Medal, I says, no, I wasn\u2019t too good.",
        "A: Yeah, I \u2014",
        "A: I still say that \u2014 that we have the leadership, we won\u2019t have this trouble. But we\ndon\u2019t \u2014 we don\u2019t have our leadership any more. If we had good leadership 1n \u2014 in \u2014\nover there in Congress and that. They\u2019re sitting on their butts, that\u2019s it, they\u2019re not\ndoing anything. We\u2019re going to get into it somepla \u2014 I guess. It\u2019s gonna happen. I\ndon\u2019t know, I\u2019m 90 now, and I \u2014 I won\u2019t \u2014 probably won\u2019t be around to see it. PI\ntry to stay around, but I ca \u2014 forget it.",
