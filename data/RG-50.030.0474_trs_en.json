        "Q: Good morning, Nicole.",
        "A: Good morning.",
        "Q: Nicole, what was your name at birth?",
        "A: My name at birth was Nicole Jeanne Celina Denier.",
        "Q: A long name!",
        "A: It\u2019s really \u2014 my name, chosen name from my family is Nicole, Jeanne my Catholic\ngrandmother, Celina my Jewish grandmother, and Denier the name of the father, which is\na very pedestrian French name and played a lot in my fate.",
        "Q: Uh-huh, and...",
        "A: And because your identity paper carried your name. If I had been named Levy, my whole\nfate would have been different. Because you are constantly asked \u2014 it seems funny now\nthat Americans think it\u2019s such an extraordinary thing to have to have an I.D. You had to\nshow your I.D. all the time in France to get into buildings and so. And there I was: Nicole\nDenier. Nicole, Nicole Horowitz would have been much different. And if you are Jew\nthose skunks pushed your I.D. \u2014 not only showed juif, but it was put through.",
        "Q: Each page...",
        "A: No, you have a yellow... It was a sort of a card. But the word juif\u2014 you could not erase\nit.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: Or cover it up because it was made with spikes. And it cut through the card and you\ncould not hide it. They thought of so many ugly things.",
        "Q: What was the date of your birth?",
        "A: January 27, yesterday, 1921.",
        "Q: So, we just missed your birthday.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: [Laughs] So, we can wish you happy birthday.",
        "A: Thank you. Happy 82\" birthday.",
        "Q: Yes. Tell us a little bit about your, your family.",
        "A: I have two sides of my family. My mother\u2019s side was the Jewish side. It was a well-\nknown Jewish family from Avignon. The Jewish popes, popes...\u201d No, the Jewish \u2014 yeah,\nin the 11\" century, the Jews from Portugal and Spain came to be protected by the Jewish\nPope at Avignon. And all my family comes from that region. And they are well-known;\nit\u2019s Cr\u00e9mieux \u2014 C-R-E-M-I-E-U-X, so that there is a village named Cr\u00e9mieux in\nAvignon, and so...",
        "Q: Now, explain why you say this is a Jewish Pope.",
        "A: Because, at the time, the Pope in Avignon protected the Jews. And they came to live in\nAvignon. And that means that when the Germans asked about the Jews, you had to prove\nthat you were a French Jew. And the French Jew had to have five generations. And five\ngenerations, you have to go way back to cover five generations, but it was easy for my\nmother because she was a Pope Jew.",
        "Q: And your mother\u2019s name?",
        "A: My mother\u2019s name was Marcelle and then she took my father\u2019s name. Cr\u00e9mieux was the\noriginal name of the family. And she became Denier when she married Pierre Denier.",
        "Q: And her first name was Marcelle?",
        "A: Marcelle.",
        "Q: Marcelle?",
        "A: M-A-R...",
        "Q: And her last name? Maiden name?",
        "A: Maiden name?",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Was Monina. M-O-N-I-N-A.",
        "Q: And your father...?",
        "A: My father was a Catholic. They met during the First World War. She was a \u2014 you know \u2014\nbourgeois nurse. And they fell in love and married. And he was an interesting fellow. He\nwasn\u2019t born to be a father. He deserted when I was three months. And my fa-... my\nbrother was only, was only 12 months older, so he was 14 or 15 months. He took off and\nwent to Argentina. And became a great scientist. He has a museum named in his honor in\nArgentina. But he was a real skunk.",
        "Q: So, he never kept in touch with you?",
        "A: Never! Never wrote a letter, never sent a penny. But his parents took over. Those are my\nCatholic grandparents. And they were very influential in my life, intellectually.",
        "Q: So let me ask you something, your mother 1s left with two babies.",
        "A: And no money.",
        "Q: And no money.",
        "A: So, she comes from a powerful family with a lot of money.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: That cousin who married Mendes-France is from those other people with castles and\nwhat would be now millions. And they supplied her with money.",
        "Q: So she did not work?",
        "A: She did work.",
        "Q: She did work, too?",
        "A: She did work. And she lived with her sister. Her sister lived with us, if you want, and her\nmother lived with us. So we had a warm family. And it was in a neighborhood near the\nLuxembourg, which up to this day I like very much. Which my daughter, when she\nvisited it, thought was ridiculously poor. But she didn\u2019t realize that at the time I thought it\nwas a little jewel. My mother had great taste and it was a small apartment but extremely\nsunny and opposite the elementary school where I went. And I had a cozy family...",
        "Q: So you felt secure at the time?",
        "A: Most. And the interesting thing about the Catholic grandparents is that my grandfather\nnever allowed the name of his son pronounced in front of him the moment he left us,\nnever. He... the mother was more tender-hearted and kept in touch. But he never would\nlike to see the letters; he was not interested in ever hearing from that man.",
        "Q: So, did you think that your mother and her mother-in-law spoke about \u2014 that her mother-\nin-law told your mother about what her son was doing? So she \u2014 so your mother knew?\nOr do you think not?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think... It\u2019s interesting, when \u2014 much later, when I went into her papers, when she\ndied and I went to settle things, I found love letters of Pierre Denier that she had still\nkept. I don\u2019t think his name was ever mentioned in the house of his parents because they\nfelt so shameful, but they certainly took over. They had a house in Brittany, and they\nspent three months of the year. The whole summer they spent in Brittany with the\ngrandparents.",
        "Q: So there was no break with the grandparents on the other side?",
        "A: Oh!",
        "Q: On the contrary, they were very much involved.",
        "A: Oh, very much and intellectually. He \u2014 my grandfather was for his job but extremely\nintellectual. He made his money by making up, what you would call, the New York Times\ncrossword puzzle. And then once a year, he would go \u2014 he never went out; they were\nvery sedentary. But once a year he would get dressed, go out and compete, there was a\ncompetition and that made the money for the rest of the year.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: So his money was made really from crossword puzzles. Either winning the competition \u2014\nthat was a yearly thing \u2014 or making them up in the name of the guy who signed for them,\nfor something that would be Le Monde, that was a great newspaper of the day. And that\nmeant that he was encyclop\u00e9dique. When he died, there was a fight over who would get\nhis dictionary, because the dictionaries were annotated and it counted a lot. He trained us,\nhe teached us in Latin, in French. He had groups of our little friends come every... once a\nweek to study with him and he was great. I mean, they were just great. And it was very,\nvery modest life. They did not have any hot water. They did not have any running water\nexcept in one faucet in the whole house. So you can read those breaux (ph) that you see\nnow, people collect them. But for us it was a necessity of life. You had to heat your water\nand then have them pour it and then you had those big bowls and you wash like that.",
        "Q: So the difference between your mother\u2019s family...",
        "A: And the other family.",
        "Q: And the other family was very different financially.",
        "A: Extraordinary. But from the other side, we got some financial help, but we saw them for\nthe first of January or something, but not...",
        "Q: But not on a regular basis?",
        "A: Oh no, it was not at all. Because the caste system is such in France that you live in a\ndifferent part of the city, you never, never...",
        "Q: So explain this caste system, as you understand it.",
        "A: Well, you have the working class; we had nothing to do with that. We were bourgeois\npoor, but we had a maid. We always had a maid. It was done that way. And she had what\nis now the students\u2019 quarters in the building where we used to live, because they had the,\nhad the view. It was on the sixth floor. All that floor was maids. And now it\u2019s all students\nand they all fight...",
        "Q: To get that...",
        "A: ...to have the view because it\u2019s over the roofs.",
        "Q: So, there\u2019s a strict kind of class system that was in place?",
        "A: Yes. And you were not aware of it; it\u2019s built in you. You talk differently. I married a man\nwho 1s that way and I mean, he spends his time watching T.V. and they say \u201cwho\u201d when\nthey should say \u201cwhom\u201d, and he says \u201cwhom\u201d aloud. I can hear him from my room\nbecause he is incensed. It\u2019s built in you, that you speak well, but you wear their discard as\nclothes \u2014 except for shoes; the rich never give their shoes. You can\u2019t wear other people\u2019s\nshoes.",
        "Q: Uh-huh, but you can wear other people\u2019s...",
        "A: All the rest was discards, all the time. And I remember the time when I begin to wear my\nown clothes and it was a sensation and that was \u2014 I was in my twenties.",
        "Q: But now you said that your grandparents \u2014 which grandparents had had the house in\nBrittany?",
        "A: The poor ones.",
        "Q: The poor ones?",
        "A: But all their money was put in buying land in Brittany. Now, we go back, it\u2019s like having\na mansion to us, an acre of land on the sea...",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: ...1n Brittany. Because the mansion Constanty (ph) was near B\u00e9ly (ph). It\u2019s mentioned\nconstantly on the news because of tt.",
        "Q: Now your, your mother is obviously young when her husband leaves her. Did, did she\never divorce him?",
        "A: Oh, yes.",
        "Q: She did, but she didn\u2019t remarry?",
        "A: No, you didn\u2019t in those days, a woman did not. And she didn\u2019t take lovers either. She\nreally... it destroyed her.",
        "Q: So, she was very much in love with him?",
        "A: I think it was a passion \u2014 it makes me feel choked.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah, hmm.",
        "A: It\u2019s interesting because when I got involved with an American, and another one of those\nlove-at-first-sight and fast-move type. It ran in the blood. She was devastated in a way;\non the other hand, she saw that I was going to be happy. And she let me go and never\nregretted it, and I wrote every week and never missed a week. And he wrote, too, so they\nhad two views of our lives. When we were at the University of Chicago, we would write.\nAnd they also wrote \u2014 both of them \u2014 and I still have their letters, wrote every week. So,\nthere is a way to keep in touch. We didn\u2019t have phones and so...",
        "Q: Right. So you wrote to the grandparents and you wrote to....?",
        "A: Oh, I have the letters of my grandmother.",
        "Q: You do?",
        "A: We didn\u2019t write, but she wrote.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: She died when I was 30. You see, they got married much earlier and so they had children\nearly. So, I was lucky to have her \u2018til I was 30. And I remember in Chicago when they\ntold me very carefully...",
        "Q: That she had gone. Tell me what you remember about your mother. What she was like for\nyou as a mother?",
        "A: She was a roly-poly.",
        "Q: Which means, what, heavy?",
        "A: She was... We called them the \u201cfatties\u201d, my mother and aunt. We were not respectful. We\nwere loving, but not respectful. Ce sont les petites grosses \u2014 \u201cthe little fatties\u201d\u2019.",
        "Q: And you called her that to her face?",
        "A: Oh, sure.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: I called her mamoun, also. People call me mamoun now, too, but they were the two \u201clittle\nfatties\u201d. They were fat, small, but she didn\u2019t look Jewish at all. I had my nose, I was the\nJewish one looking, but I had perfect papers. It was a queer mixture.",
        "Q: When you \u2014 you were not baptized? Or were you baptized? When you were, when you\nwere a baby\u201d?",
        "A: No, because neither of the grandparents \u2014 although grandmother had been raised in a\nconvent and him by monks \u2014 they were not believers. So, I had a perfectly non-religious\nchildhood. When I was \u2014 when the German occupation came, the Jewish issue came to\nthe fore. The day the Americans started their war, seventh of December, 1941. Then the\nGermans began to force the French Jews, the Jews in France, let\u2019s say, to wear the star,\nthe yellow star. And the people lined up, but I didn\u2019t know my mother was Jewish until\nthen. It was never mentioned; we never went to the temple or to the church. It was\ncompletely /aic...",
        "Q: So until you were twenty, you didn\u2019t, you didn\u2019t know there was some background of the\nfamily? Nobody said...",
        "A: Oh yes, I knew that there was some Jewish background, but it meant nothing.",
        "Q: It meant nothing? Because there was nothing in your life...",
        "A: There was nothing culturally. I had never seen a word of Hebrew until I was in my 50s\npractically. And it meant nothing to her. And it was strictly separation of church and\nstate, so it was never mentioned. In school, I never heard anything, any mention of even\nCatholicism, although 90 percent of them Catholic.",
        "Q: Did you celebrate any holidays?",
        "A: Well, Christmas.",
        "Q: Christmas, but as a non-religious holiday.",
        "A: As a non-religious holiday.",
        "Q: But not Easter\u2019?",
        "A: Is there, is \u2014 there was a chocolate.",
        "Q: Chocolate?",
        "A: Chocolate eggs.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: That\u2019s all.",
        "Q: So you never attended synagogue? You never attended church?",
        "A: Never attended either. Never set foot in a synagogue.",
        "Q: Interesting.",
        "A: And then the Germans came.",
        "Q: Okay let\u2019s talk a little bit more. Your mother is a \u201cfattie\u201d you say, she\u2019s \u201croly-poly\u201d\u2019. But\nwhat is her personality like? She\u2019s a warm person? She\u2019s an intelligent person?",
        "A: [Sighs] You have to go back, way back. That would be 19\" century. She was from\nMarseilles, from Avignon. She was so prosperous that the apartment house where she\nlived in is still there, standing up at an apartment house; that means something. It\u2019s a\nbeautiful, stone, powerful apartment house. She never \u2014 she was sad, she was destroyed.",
        "Q: Because of the father leaving...",
        "A: She was destroyed for some reason. I never saw my mother but somewhat sad. My aunt\nwas the joy of our childhood.",
        "Q: Her sister?",
        "A: Yes, she was playful. But I had a brother; I had a brother who was only 11 months older.\nWe played and played and played. And we were happy. We managed to \u2014 they were\nextremely loving. I found my mother, her sadness was kind of frightening, but she was so\nloving that we didn\u2019t...",
        "Q: And what was your aunt\u2019s name that lived with you? Her sister?",
        "A: Tante Yvonne.",
        "Q: Tante...?",
        "A: Tante Yvonne. Tante Yvonne \u2014 Tantine.",
        "Q: Tantine?",
        "A: Tantine. Mamoun and Tantine. And we... and she was married to a Monteux. You know\nPierre Monteux?",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: It was his son or whatever. So, she married well, and he... for... and he left suddenly and\ndisappeared from, from all of our lives.",
        "Q: Another one?",
        "A: Another one. So, it was really a family of divorce.",
        "Q: Oh, my.",
        "A: It isn\u2019t built in the genes.",
        "Q: No it\u2019s not [laughs]. And were you close to your brother?",
        "A: We lived in twin beds, in the same room. We played together. He resented me when I\nbegan to be 10 or 11. Because, that was maybe genetic, I was my size at 10. I grew up\nfaster and there was one or two years there that he was smaller and he deeply resented\nthat. But then later we became friends again.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: When... when I began to be an excellent student and go to those highly competitive oral\nexams that the French torture the young with, he came to see me perform, bringing his\nbest friend who 1s still one of our closest friends \u2014 he lives in France. And so that showed\nme that he loved me in a clumsy way, but he did. And then, he and my husband got along\nvery well and we remained friends through the rest of his life and he wrote regularly, also\n\u2014 we corresponded. And when he died you, you could see that, you would say that we\nwere the closest thing. When he came to Cleveland to have his arteries bypassed, he\nasked me to come with him. Which was quite a thing to ask because, by that time, I was\nteaching college. I had to take the 11 days that it took him to stay in Cleveland. And I\nwas friendly with his \u2014 to, to this day I am friendly with his kids. Now adults, they come\nand visit us and stay with us at the beach. We rent the biggest possible house and all the\nnephews from France come. I\u2019m very family-inclined. I think it\u2019s part of the happiness of\nlife.",
        "Q: And obviously you had a very close set of relationships, even from the...",
        "A: Yes, yes and money had nothing to do with it. Which is a pleasure.",
        "Q: Can I assume that you loved school, or not?",
        "A: I adored school and I was recognized, and they had things \u2014 they had prize at the time,\nyou know the prix d\u2019excellence, prize of excellence, and I made a point of getting. But\nwhat I was more pleased with is that they had the prix de bonne camaraderie. The good\nchum of the year and I always got that one.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: That\u2019s lovely. What a nice idea.",
        "A: I was \u2014 and I am \u2014 a good chum and I still have friends from childhood. We write\nregularly and, and their children are close friend. I have a letter, I got a letter yesterday\nfrom the daughter of my closest friend. She\u2019s extremely close to us.",
        "Q: Was it wonderful to grow up 1n Paris as a child?",
        "A: Yes, although we had no money, so we did not go to... I went once in my life to a\nrestaurant, in my life, in my childhood, when I was 12. I remember it and it was a\ncafeteria. But to this day, I remember it as a day of extraordinary thing. We \u2014 things that\nare normal for Americans now were not in existence. It didn\u2019t matter. I don\u2019t think my\nfriends went to restaurants, either.",
        "Q: And who cooked in the house? Did your mother cook?",
        "A: We had a maid.",
        "Q: You had a maid who cooked?",
        "A: I never entered the kitchen until I was 18.",
        "Q: You never entered the kitchen?",
        "A: I remember that because it was a sentence in my biography, that my husband\nremembered. I never entered the kitchen.",
        "Q: Isn\u2019t that extraordinary? It seems extraordinary, doesn\u2019t it?",
        "A: For an American, but...",
        "Q: So, was she a good cook?",
        "A: In my grandmother, you remember, I said my...",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah",
        "A: ...was a good cook, yeah. My mother was a good cook and I am a good cook. But I\u2014 Jew\n\u2014 that may be genetic, or it may be whatever, it could be taste.",
        "Q: So, if you had a maid who cooked, did your grandmother cook in the house, too? And...\nyou\u2019re talking about your father\u2019s mother?",
        "A: No, no, no, no, no, I\u2019m talking about the one who lived with us.",
        "Q: Okay, so she also went, but she went into the kitchen then?",
        "A: Oh she did. Maybe the others did. I just didn\u2019t.",
        "Q: You just didn\u2019t?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Did you have a favorite food as a kid?",
        "A: Uh-uh.",
        "Q: No?",
        "A: It didn\u2019t matter too much.",
        "Q: It didn\u2019t matter to you?",
        "A: Nah, I don\u2019t remember food.",
        "Q: Despite of the fact that France is so known for extraordinary...",
        "A: And I went once to a cafeteria and I thought it was a great celebration. No, I don\u2019t.",
        "Q: Did you go to museums as a kid? Or were they not there, maybe not?",
        "A: I probably did. No, I wasn\u2019t very... I had an uncle, my brother... my husband had an\nuncle who was a painter. So, I am in some of his paintings and I was in some museum.\nAnd he gave us some paintings. And some paintings of his are still in Paris museums.",
        "Q: You don\u2019t mean your husband\u2019s brother?",
        "A: No, I mean my father\u2019s brother...",
        "Q: Brother, 1s a painter?",
        "A: Yes. And he was a stay-at-home. My grandmother had two children, one who stayed at\nhome and never left the house practically, and the other one who took to... went to, to\nArgentina. And they were also only 18 months apart. Like night and day.",
        "Q: And this is to skip time, but did you ever make contact with your father or did your father\never try to make contact...?",
        "A: Ah, that is an interesting thing. When I was 60...",
        "Q: 60?",
        "A: When I was 60, my son in town called me one day and said, \u201cI have Jeannette\u201d \u2014 my\ngrandmother was named Jeanne, remember? \u2014 \u201cI have Jeannette on the phone.\u201d And I\nsaid, \u201cAnd who on earth is Jeannette?\u201d At that point I was in \u2014 directing Continuing\nEducation for the women in the college. And I was at my desk, surrounded by secretaries\nand \u201cWho on earth is Jeannette?\u201d And he said, \u201cYour sister.\u201d I didn\u2019t know I had a sister.\nAnd so he put Jeannette on the phone and Jeannette was in town. She was researching her\nfamily. And to this day, we are very close. We went to Argentina; she had the six\nchildren that I would have loved to have. And when we met that evening, when she came\nto Washington to see us, we went to a restaurant and the children said, \u201cThat we have to\nsee, the two sisters.\u201d I was 60, she was 40. We were the same person. We laugh at the\nsame thing, we adore each other. If she lived next door, I would talk about my sister as\nthe lady in the house here talks about her sister.",
        "Q: So he remarried.",
        "A: Well, six times.",
        "Q: Six times?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. So, he moved around a lot.",
        "A: Moved around a lot. I recently got, got something, yeah. I mean, he was really a woman\nchaser. Great charm, great gifts. But my sister is quite a thing. Yes, I have that half-sister.\nI never see her because... but we sent her money at the time when Argentina was in\ntrouble. She\u2019s delightful, married, six beautiful children.",
        "Q: Very interesting. Did you go to the movies as a kid?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Ah-huh.",
        "A: My grandmother, the one we lived with, loved movies, and at the time you paid\naccording to the quality of the seats. So we were poor, so were always sitting in front. But\nevery Thursday afternoon, she took us to the movies.",
        "Q: And did you have favorites? Did you see American movies?",
        "A: You have American movies in the 30s in Paris?",
        "Q: I don\u2019t know, they were \u2014 they were in Poland, but not in Paris?",
        "A: No, no, they were... maybe on the Champs Elys\u00e9es, but not in my neighborhood. But I\nsaw the old French movies and some them are excellent. And it was completely... There\nwere no rules of age, you know. I must have seen extraordinary, risky things and I\nnever... To the innocent, everything is innocent.",
        "Q: That\u2019s true, so every single Thursday with your grandmother?",
        "A: Yes, that was the...",
        "Q: So, it was very special.",
        "A: And every Sunday, we went to the Catholic grandparents\u2019 and we had a big dinner. It was\na feast, and they played with us. One funny thing my grandfather had is that he played at\nour level. So he played checkers, chess. We played games. There was a game where you\nthrow dice, whatever.",
        "Q: So, in addition to teaching you languages...",
        "A: All, all afternoon we played games. And they were surrounded by great books. They had\nfirst edition, all the Oscar Wilde in first edition. They were collecting first editions. I\nmean, they were not collecting, but they bought the books. So, it was a very, very\nbookish, intellectual household, completely full.",
        "Q: We are going to have to stop the tape now.",
        "A: You are getting tired? [Laughs]",
        "Q: No, no, no, we just have to change the tape. I\u2019m not getting... [Laughs]\nEnd of Tape #1\nTape #2",
        "A: Then the war came.",
        "Q: Nicole, when you were growing up were you conscious politically of what was going on?\nWas there talk in the family or what it \u2014 were you more intellectually...",
        "A: I was conscious and I liked it, I liked the political life. I liked the fact that my grandfather\nwould, was... left, as he got older. And we were for the worker movement, whatever it\nwas, not communist but let\u2019s say center-left. And we were somewhat left, more left, I\nmean, don\u2019t forget that there were newspapers in that household all the time. So, we\nfollowed the political life very much so. And then it continued and still to this day, \u2019'm\nvery conscious of political things and...",
        "Q: So, when Hitler takes over in Germany, in January of \u00b033.",
        "A: I was...twelve.",
        "Q: You were twelve?",
        "A: Twelve. The French were blissfully wanting to be unaware. Remember, there was a\nmovement to try to appease, to do as if nothing was happening. So, we went to send\npeople visiting and they came back saying, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, don\u2019t worry, it won\u2019t happen.\u201d\nAnd we felt insulated, and when it came, it came only because the Americans entered the\nwar. The Germans invaded France and France completely capitulated and it was\nshameful and I was very aware of that. But, as I mention in passing, the French protected\ntheir thoroughbreds, and so they sent to unoccupied France. And I had a scholarship that\npaid not only my mother for, for my upkeep, it paid for books for me. So, whenever I\nwanted to buy books, the government would pay. And during the war they kept feeding\nus money, because of my continuing to be such a good student.",
        "Q: Okay, let\u2019s go back a little bit. So, so prior to...",
        "A: Unaware.",
        "Q: ...the Germans taking...",
        "A: Unaware.",
        "Q: You\u2019re unaware. But when refugees begin to come into France and certainly at first...",
        "A: Not in our milieu.",
        "Q: Not in your milieu? So you didn\u2019t know this...",
        "A: They didn\u2019t move into that neighborhood at all. Not any more than they would move into\nBethesda.",
        "Q: So you\u2019re not conscious of this? You\u2019re not feeling this?",
        "A: No, no, no.",
        "Q: So, it\u2019s \u00b036, it\u2019s \u00b037, \u00b038...",
        "A: No, happy in high school and working very hard. Okay, yes, I began to be aware of them\nin \u00b040 when France fell.",
        "Q: But what about \u00b039?",
        "A: \u00b039, I was, again, I had, I had my vacation paid by the government in a youth hostel in\nVerdun. And I visited the German battlefields and the German cemeteries. And I made a\nGerman friend.",
        "Q: Who was a pianist, yes?",
        "A: Yes, and he remained a friend until he died, and...",
        "Q: Now this is, you are talking with him and visiting these World War I...",
        "A: Yes, and he is a German...delight. And that, I think, helped me through life, not ever\ngeneralizing about Germans because I knew that Hans Mattern existed in Kaiserslautern\nand if maybe there was one, there was more than one.",
        "Q: And his name is Hans?",
        "A: Hans Mattern. M-A-T-T-E-R-N.",
        "Q: And he was a concert pianist?",
        "A: And he was a concert pianist and I still have his letters at home. And we corresponded,\nand he came! When Germans invaded and my mother started having to wear the star,\nHans announced that as a German he was playing for them in the army. He came to visit\nand he came to visit Jews, a German in uniform coming to visit Jews! And he did, he\nnever changed.",
        "Q: So, you are, in 1939, under... you\u2019re outside of Paris.",
        "A: Paris. And we were very worried because my mother and aunt were government\nemployees and we were worried for them, but...",
        "Q: And what were your mother and your aunt doing?",
        "A: They were working for the government.",
        "Q: As... Doing what? As secretaries, or...?",
        "A: No, more than that, but they were not very high level. You know, at that time, women in\nthat milieu didn\u2019t study very hard. So, I don\u2019t think that their jobs were very important at\nall.",
        "Q: Was there worry that the war would turn west? Here, Hitler had gone east and Austria\nwas taken and Czechoslovakia and now Poland.",
        "A: We didn\u2019t give it a thought.",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t give it a thought?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Nothing? Was your brother concerned about being taken in the army at this point?",
        "A: And my brother turned 20 in 1940. He was born in \u201920. And he was a medical student\nalready, extremely good student himself. We were both on heavy, heavy scholarships.\nOur parents received money every month because we were such good students. And if we\nhad not kept our grade up...",
        "Q: You would have lost it.",
        "A: We would have lost the scholarship. Which means that my mother would have practically\nlost her way of life. So, we were always studying hard. And he left Paris walking and he\nwalked to, to the Pyrenees. At some point, the Germans were before him \u2014 he met a\nGerman on a bridge, stopped him and had pity on him because he was 20 years and was\nwearing a brand new uniform. And he said, \u201cHurry up, or else Pll make you a prisoner.\u201d\nAnd then he went all the way to the Pyrenees and he stayed in the provinces during the\nrest of the war years. He never came back Paris during the war years.",
        "Q: Uh-huh, this is obviously before the occupation that he left.",
        "A: No, in \u201940, they did occupy France.",
        "Q: Right. They come in, in...",
        "A: 40, French, French lost in, in 1940, the spring. The Germans just ran over them.",
        "Q: But that, was that a shock to you? That, that France was going to be attacked? I mean\nthere must have been some build up between \u00b039 and \u201940.",
        "A: I was studying so hard, you know. Those were the studies I don\u2019t even \u2014 I have good\nstudents among my grandchildren, I don\u2019t see the same intensity of the... competitive\nstudy. I was in my books up to here, and that was, I was specializing in Ancient Greek, so\nI was and that was when the Germans invaded France.",
        "Q: So explain something to me. You were in high school.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And that\u2019s a little bit different than the high school here, you\u2019re a bit older...",
        "A: Way above level. Let\u2019s say that at the time, definitely the graduating class would be\njunior college level here. I have checked it since, since I was teaching college all through\nmy adult life here. And so we were really advanced and so during the war years, and we\ntalk 21 \u2014 when I was 21, I was studying for what you would call a master\u2019s. But I was\nstudying independently, although I had been \u2014 but fate was very tied with my grades.\nBecause I had been accepted at Ecole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure, which would be like the\nRadcliffe, the chaplain was sensitive to the fact that the Germans were working against\nthe Jews, and gave me the baptism certificate that saved both my life and the life of my\nmother. So, from then on, I had a baptism certificate but I was never baptized.",
        "Q: And the baptism certificate was dated when? Way back...",
        "A: Way, way back? Sure, it was a perfect piece given by \u2014 practically given by a chaplain. It\nwas not made by him because it would have been suspicious. He wrote to somebody in\nthe Loire Valley, in a little village that guaranteed that at age 3, I had been 3 months, I\nhad been baptized in that village. It was new in the church, it was very complex. And I\nhad my baptism certificate, which was the life of the whole family in the future.",
        "Q: Yet you didn\u2019t ask for this. It was, it was...",
        "A: The chaplain...",
        "Q: Suggested that this was a good idea.",
        "A: Yes. That it was, it was going to be needed.",
        "Q: Did you feel vulnerable?",
        "A: No, I felt blissfully out of it. Maybe because my roly-polies were optimist and I definitely\nwas an optimist \u2014 it pays in my life to have been an optimist, to this day.",
        "Q: I\u2019m going to ask you a little bit about the money that you got because you were such a\ngood student. This was like a stipend?",
        "A: It was a real salary.",
        "Q: It was a real salary?",
        "A: It was a real salary that you could live on.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Yes, I mean they really, to this day, pushed for the people that they wanted to save. And\nthere were laws that they created to protect people like me \u2014 were created with Petain,\nyou see, Petain and Laval, was where those people protected their people. They, they\nsacrificed in a disheartening way. At that point, I began to be disheartened about it. But\nthat would be \u00b041, \u201942. The Petain Law \u2014 Petain took the second half of France, you\nremember Vichy and collaborators. And the Vichy laws are the laws under which I came,\nprotected people like myself. As against the Poles, that were refugees, the Polish, the\nHungarian, the names that you see in the book you can notice, for years, there is not one\nFrench name.",
        "Q: If I\u2019m correct, a few days before the occupation of Paris, didn\u2019t you take a train to the\nsouth? As I understand it, your mother asked you to leave? Do you remember this? There\nwere a lot of people leaving.",
        "A: It was... yes, but she was... and the Germans didn\u2019t appreciate it, she was a devoted\ngovernment employee. She stayed at her job.",
        "Q: So she did not leave?",
        "A: No, she didn\u2019t\u2014and also she was an optimist I don\u2019t think she saw, that, that was... In\nfact, to the very end, she was having, ready for the deportation, a little bag, a small black\nbag with a chamber pot in it. She thought it was going to be a working camp. And that...\nshe may have problem going to the toilet but that would be all and that she would\nsurvive; otherwise, she would not. When they came to pick us up, she still had that.",
        "Q: Why did she ask you to leave?",
        "A: Ah, the children were different.",
        "Q: So, she was worry about you as a child?",
        "A: Yes, as a, she was a very, very worried mother. And that train was full of children and\nwomen. There wasn\u2019t one single man on that train that went to southern France. That was\nin \u00b039, right?",
        "Q: I don\u2019t, I don\u2019t know. I think it was...",
        "A: Or \u00b040.",
        "Q: I think it was \u00b040 because Paris fell on June 14\" and this was a few days before.",
        "A: Yes, right, right, yes.",
        "Q: So did you have questions? \u201cWhy am I leaving and you\u2019re not leaving. I have a baptism\ncertificate and you\u2019re a Jew?\u201d",
        "A: No, no, no I was not thinking of the Jewish issue at all.",
        "Q: Nothing?",
        "A: No, the Jewish issue did not come up until...\u201940?",
        "Q: Until later.",
        "A: Until \u00b040 December \u201941. Then you had to register as Jews.",
        "Q: But then why 1s she asking you to leave, do you think? I know that thousands of people\nare going south.",
        "A: To protect, to protect me. I don\u2019t know what against.",
        "Q: From the war?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Do you think, from the war?",
        "A: From the possibility of the bomb or whatever happened.",
        "Q: Then you get stuck?",
        "A: Yeah, and I learn that eleven, that\u2019s the longest line. Nobody has lined up that long.\nEleven hours to come back!",
        "Q: But this is after a couple months? You\u2019re away for a couple of months.",
        "A: Yeah, right.",
        "Q: And where are you for these couple of months?",
        "A: I was at the house of a friend.",
        "Q: So, you got off the train? This, this was an intentional place that you were staying?",
        "A: Yeah, in Limoges.",
        "Q: In Limoges?",
        "A: Central France, God forsaken city, and I stayed there for a month or two and then lined\nup for eleven hours in order to get a ticket back to Paris.",
        "Q: So, then, okay, so now, why do you go back?",
        "A: Because my mother was there.",
        "Q: And did she say to you that it\u2019s okay? You were writing to each other, and she said, she\nsaid that it was okay to come and you said \u201cthat\u2019s enough already\u201d\u2019.",
        "A: I forgot...",
        "Q: You forgot.",
        "A: I remember the line up, I remember the train.",
        "Q: Do you remember German soldiers?",
        "A: I remember the first German soldier. My aunt was the funny roly-poly, so saw the first\nGerman soldier. And she came back to the house to say \u2014 somebody saw a German\nsoldier and said, \u201cI have seen a German soldier.\u201d And my aunt said, \u201cIt must be English,\nit must be British.\u201d She never understood the war; she never understood what was going\non. But it was a blessing. I remember the first one I saw. And they said... You know\nwhat they did? They sent smashingly good-looking soldiers for the first wave. Boy, were\nthey handsome, and they behaved perfectly. The French, you know, touched you, the\nAmericans played around. The Germans never touched a woman. They were\nimpeccable...bastards. Impeccable. Never, never. They would have been killed if they\nhad done anything wrong in their behavior. Perfectly handsome, awful bastards.",
        "Q: And do you remember seeing a German in Limoges or do you remember in Paris when\nyou came back?",
        "A: Oh, no, no, no. It was in Paris.",
        "Q: Was it shocking to come back to Paris occupied?",
        "A: It was a pleasure to see my mother again.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: You know, the occupation, I took... You took... When... There was a funny rule: you\ndidn\u2019t look at them. What arms do you have when you have no arms, while you are good-\nlooking, 21-year-old, and you never, never looked at the German in the face. That\u2019s the\nway. You look at their belly button where they have the sign saying \u201cGod Meet Us\u201d (ph).\nThat\u2019s what you look at. You never laugh, you never... but you never even look at them.\nThey do not exist. So, that was the game. I mean there were many games that were\nplayed like that. I never looked one in the eye, I saw, I saw they were there.",
        "Q: And that was as a way of ...",
        "A: Of resistance.",
        "Q: Of resistance?",
        "A: It must have been... disheartening. There were many things that must have disheartening.\nYou can dishearten somebody just by being very passive, \u201cYou don\u2019t exist, I see through\nyou.\u201d",
        "Q: Were you afraid?",
        "A: I was not.",
        "Q: No?",
        "A: No. We believed... they never, never were brutal or friendly or anything. Don\u2019t forget,\nthat was their rules. Impeccable.",
        "Q: Do you think this was true all over?",
        "A: Paris.",
        "Q: In Paris?",
        "A: And, as a typical French... Except for Paris, there is no French.",
        "Q: [Laughs] You think that.",
        "A: Yes, to this day, I still feel that way. There is a culture \u2014 You asked me if I went to the\ntheater. I went to the premiere because, for the premiere, I had free tickets. So, if there\nwas a play in Paris, I was at the premiere, the perfect orchestra seats. That was really\nperfect.",
        "Q: Can you explain what the premiere is?",
        "A: The first show.",
        "Q: The first show?",
        "A: Yeah, when, the show opens, at the opening hours. I had some tickets. So we had only the\njournalists and some, some people had those tickets in the best seat.",
        "Q: Did you understand how privileged you were?",
        "A: I was proud, I was proud. I was working terribly hard for it. I remember then, I remember\nbeing told you had only one room that you could barely heat. So that was the dining room\nfor the French. They had no kitchen practically and that was the maid. The dining room\nand the dining room table was where you worked, so I remember working with my\nbrother at the dining room table. We never, never, never stopped before midnight. Never.\nWe were... and we never interrupted each other, either. He had his books and I had my\nbooks. You know, we were... and that was a way of life.",
        "Q: And did you discuss your work with your mother?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No, no, that wasn\u2019t what it was, but you did with your grandfather?",
        "A: Yes, but that was earlier. Oh yes, he, he trained us. He, he would, he would give us little\nthings to translate. Yes, yes.",
        "Q: So, when the occupation begins, you\u2019re going to school and you remain in school. You,\nyou, your life does not radically change until later.",
        "A: Until \u201941, the Americans entered the war. We were plenty in, in anticipation of \u2014 we\nknew they were going to be the saviors. But it started elsewhere, but it didn\u2019t matter. The\n7\" of December, 1941, you did enter to the war. And you were to come eventually. Much\nlater, but you did eventually come, and at that point, the Germans pounced on the Jews.\nAnd requested the star. They requested that you register if you were a Jew, and that you\nwear a star. And that is where the lined up at the mairie, where I was later to be married.\nYou lined up as a Jew and that\u2019s where the Dashund (ph), who was a big philosopher,\nalready in Switzerland completely safe, came back to register as a Jew. People were\nproud to be Jewish and didn\u2019t realize what it was going to entail. You just didn\u2019t deny the\nfact that you were Jewish, \u201cDamn it, yes I am!\u201d",
        "Q: But now you had a baptism certificate.",
        "A: No, I went with my mother to line up, my mother lined up.",
        "Q: Yes, I understand that. But you didn\u2019t, you were not lining up...",
        "A: I was lining to be with her because I was afraid what was going to be... I was afraid that\nshe might be attacked in the street, who knows? I, I, I began to sense danger, but for her,\nnot for me. I was in no way in danger. Although I... we always joked that I, I really had\nthe Jewish nose. If the Germans were any more intelligent, they should have been after\nme, not after my mother.",
        "Q: And did it seem, I mean, you\u2019I|l have to pardon me for, for raising a question like this but,\nyour mother is Jewish.",
        "A: Mm-hmm.",
        "Q: So, you, of course, are born of your mother, even though you have a certificate that says\nyou are baptized; nevertheless, your mother remains a Jewish mother. Is that of no\nsignificance under the circumstances?",
        "A: I had no idea what being Jewish meant.",
        "Q: Right. So, for you it had no...",
        "A: No significance. A sense of danger for her, definitely, very, very broad-based, you know.\nIntangible, but there. She was... and that star was very ugly.",
        "Q: Do you ever say to your mother, \u201cLet me try to get you papers; you don\u2019t look Jewish\u2019\u2019?\nNo, she doesn\u2019t ask?",
        "A: There was little that was said and intuitively that I heard others say, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t they\nresist?\u201d And you reach a point where you are so deep in the hole that you don\u2019t resist.\nNobody is going to resist. It was, it was an enormous wave that was engulfing Europe.\nThere was nothing you could do.",
        "Q: [Quietly] What do you see in your head now?",
        "A: Hmm\u2019?",
        "Q: What, what are you seeing in your head now?",
        "A: I see...",
        "Q: I can see that you see something.",
        "A: Yeah, I see the lining up.",
        "Q: And that really upset you?",
        "A: Mm-hmm. I don\u2019t know what I would... I mean, you, you wouldn\u2019t tell them anything\nnow because it\u2019s so far away. But I understand deeply why they didn\u2019t revolt. It was too\nbig to resist.",
        "Q: But you feel the pain of seeing that line now.",
        "A: Oh, yeah. But now I have only American enthusiasm behind me, you know. I am not...\nBut...",
        "Q: When people were lining up in, after December 41.",
        "A: Then they were given, then they were given a piece of cloth. And it was sadistic \u2014 you\nhad to cut up your own star; you had to sew up your own star. It wasn\u2019t a star; they didn\u2019t\ngive you a Star. They give you a big piece of cloth with stars on it. And you cut it up and\nyou cut up around the star and you had to carefully sew so that it looked only like a star.\nIt was sadism.",
        "Q: And you could have them put on your...",
        "A: It had to be put on the left-hand side, outside at all moments. If you were in your pajamas\nand going out, it had to be on your pajamas. If you were outside on the street, the moment\nyou were outside on the street, you had to have the sign of your Jewish denomination,\nbeginning at age six.",
        "Q: And what... I understand that you were not either feeling Jewish or understanding what it\nmeant to be Jewish, but you saw Jewish people including your mother and your aunt...",
        "A: Mm-hmm.",
        "Q: ... your grandmother.",
        "A: My grandmother by that time was... She died in \u201938.",
        "Q: So, you see Jewish people wearing stars...",
        "A: It doesn\u2019t make me feel Jewish.",
        "Q: No, but were you angry? Were you upset? Did you think, \u201cWhat are they, why are they\ndoing this to these people?\u201d",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No? Was your mother agravat--... angry or fearful because she was wearing a star?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Was she proud of it?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No. This was just what happened?",
        "A: It was just really the reality of the day. Maybe it\u2019s survival instinct. But she was not\ngoing to deny it, although it meant religiously nothing.",
        "Q: So, something in her was...proud?",
        "A: Proud.",
        "Q: Proud, but of what, you\u2019re not sure.",
        "A: No, because they were not sure either, to this day, what is it that 1t meant by being\nJewish. According to that, in fact, my granddaughter who lives in McLain (ph) coming\nfrom the women is Jewish.",
        "Q: What do you hear... oh, I think I\u2019m gonna to stop. This is the question I\u2019m going to ask\nyou as we start with, after we change the tape. What did you start hearing about what was\nhappening on the eastern front?",
        "A: Never.",
        "Q: Never?",
        "A: Never. As I tell you, if my mother had learned that there were extermination camps, she\nwould have not kept her little chamber pot ready for deportation.",
        "Q: She would have?",
        "A: Not! Would not!",
        "Q: Not.",
        "A: Because it wasn\u2019t... If we had known that we were going to be stripped bare before we\neven hit the train... It was blissful ignorance. Until the end of the war we didn\u2019t know,\nuntil saw the news of the liberation of the camp, we did not know about the extent. We\ndid not see those cadavers piled on top of each other, not until 45.",
        "Q: Okay we have to change the tape now. So, let\u2019s stop the tape?\nEnd of Tape #2\nTape #3",
        "Q: When your mother lined up, when the, when the Jews were lining up, you remember this\nas 1941, not 1942? And 1s registration... that they were registering the same time they\nwere getting the Jewish star, as far as you remember?",
        "A: Yes. The two actually went together. Then there was a period of time my brother and I\nwere really worried for her and that started when she began wearing the star. So, we\nescort her. That\u2019s the time they begin to have laws \u2014 in the subway there were no cars\nleft, as I told you. And you had to take the... and the Germans had reserved for\nthemselves the first class. So, the one little way, one of the little ways the French resisted\nwas that nobody went in the first class. And the Jews were forced to go in the last train.\nAnd so the word was in Paris that everybody had to go in the last train. It was a sort of an\nextraordinary joke, because you couldn\u2019t get into the Jewish trains. And this is where I\nhave my little quote about my mother and the French anti-Semite. I escorted her very\noften because I was afraid for her. So, I was once in the train with her, and we were in the\nlast train, and she came in the train, push shoving and there was, of course, no sitting\nplace free, until a very tall gentleman, very distingu\u00e9, de Gaulle-type, you know \u2014 very\nstrange to be that tall but very distingu\u00e9. And he got up all his height, bowed to her very\nlow and gave her his seat and said to her, and I remember that was my war quote: \u201cAh,\nMadame, when are we going to be allowed to be anti-s\u00e9mite again?\u201d [Pauses] I love that.",
        "Q: What did you think when he said that?",
        "A: I thought it was true. That\u2019s the way they were, when we were caught finally after \u2014 but\nthat\u2019s \u2014 I am going ahead of myself. When we were caught, the French came to arrest us.\nFinally, they caught up with me and then they came \u2014 well, 1t was morning, in the early\nmorning hours (ph), I was out and the French, the French policeman came to our arrest,\nnot the Germans. The French were doing the dirty work.",
        "Q: But when you went... when this man said this...",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: So, the French are going into the last car not because they care about the Jews, but\nbecause they hate the Germans.",
        "A: Probably.",
        "Q: So, it wasn\u2019t to necessarily help the Jews at all.",
        "A: It was not allowed to them, mentally, morally, patriotically. It is not the moment where\nthey can even contemplate being anti-Semitic, because the Germans are anti-Semitic. It\nhad nothing to do with the Jews, probably. It hadn\u2019t much to do with my mother; she\nlaughed, and took the seat.",
        "Q: She laughed at them?",
        "A: Yeah, she had a sense of humor. And she took his seat.",
        "Q: Were you anti-Semitic, do you think, in some way?",
        "A: I\u2019ve been accused of it by an American friend \u2014 that was much, much later. I don\u2019t think\nso. If, by helping people, you feel superior, then maybe that was certainly the case. But I\ncertainly didn\u2019t feel superior to my mother.",
        "Q: I didn\u2019t, I didn\u2019t mean that as disrespectful. I meant that, given what you said about the\nFrench, and you were brought up in France as a secular person.",
        "A: No, oh no, oh no, no.",
        "Q: So, you would not have identified with what this guy was saying?",
        "A: Oh, no, no, no, no. No, but I knew that \u201cSo be it\u2019, that\u2019s the way, at that point, the French\nwere and you better take it. But it was putting it into words \u2014 and beautifully.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: But it wasn\u2019t allowed them. I mean, the French, as I said, when they finally caught us and\nthen let us go, again, because of my baptism certificate... The French were overwhelmed\nwith what they were doing with us at that point. They were even in Paris, and the\nbeginning of the deportation was already terribly ugly.",
        "Q: But let\u2019s stick with \u00b041 for a moment.",
        "A: Yes, yes. Mm-hmm.",
        "Q: 41, you... you remain living with your mother during \u00b041?",
        "A: Mm-hmm.",
        "Q: And your aunt?",
        "A: Mm-hmm.",
        "Q: And your brother, or he...?",
        "A: No, my mother... My brother was married, married very early and moved into an\napartment. He married a Catholic and so he was completely out of any problem because\nhe was out of the circuit, you see. They couldn\u2019t trace him.",
        "Q: Really, why couldn\u2019t they trace him? Didn\u2019t they...?",
        "A: Well, Germans were both extremely organized and completely disorganized. They were\nconcentrating, but they were sort of single-minded, you know, they had their eye on this\none. They weren\u2019t going to go to somebody else in the family who was married to\nsomebody from a long line of Catholic. That would be too complicated, no, please.",
        "Q: But he was in Paris.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And he was studying...",
        "A: And practically every day he came to see if we were still alive. There was a mixture of\nrealism, worry and completely aberrant behavior. Everyday he came to see if they were\nstill around, rather than tell them to move out. But that\u2019s the way it is. You asked me how\nit was and that\u2019s the way it is.",
        "Q: Did you have a phone?",
        "A: Nah.",
        "Q: No phone? So if you...",
        "A: Ah, wait a minute we were \u2014 no, no, I don\u2019t \u2014 I remember, I remember when the phone\nwas installed. I see myself in front of the phone, but I can\u2019t place it, but it... I spent my\nyouth without a phone definitely.",
        "Q: But it must have been somewhat dangerous for your brother to be coming to find out if\nyou were there?",
        "A: Yes, that\u2019s what I said. But it was aberrant.",
        "Q: So, you\u2019re both... you\u2019re living at the same... almost side by side with at least two\nemotions. One is you\u2019re worried about what will happen to your mother and your aunt.",
        "A: Yeah, but it didn\u2019t take much of my life.",
        "Q: But it didn\u2019t take much of your life?",
        "A: No, completely oblivious and they were, too! I think completely unknowing of the extent\nof the horror of the camp. . Put that in a big box because that was what kept us\ngoing was the fact that we didn\u2019t realize the extent of it.",
        "Q: Do you hear rumors?",
        "A: There were no rumors in Paris.",
        "Q: No rumors...",
        "A: No rumors in Paris. My mother was working with the Jews with the U.G.LF. \u2014 that\u2019s the\nFrench association of the Jews. She had a friend that was with her when she lost her job\nwith the government because they were Jewish, at the same time her job went. So, she\nbumped into the Jews and worked with them. And then that\u2019s the way she got the dates\nwhen the Germans were going to take, to take the kids. It was the Jews who gave the\ninformation.",
        "Q: So she, she lost her job because there are now rules against Jews holding certain kinds of\njobs, right?",
        "A: No, the Jews were bounced out of all administrative jobs.",
        "Q: In the, in the government?",
        "A: In the government, that\u2019s it, lost her job.",
        "Q: Yeah. Okay. So then she gets this other job...",
        "A: So, she gets the job working with a Jewish agency in Paris.",
        "Q: And what are you doing besides school? Are you, do you get involved...",
        "A: Dating.",
        "Q: You\u2019re dating? You started dating young?",
        "A: I was, it was...very chaste, but very liberating. They were, don\u2019t forget also... I don\u2019t\nknow if I was already dating because there were no men. They were either prisoners or\nthey were in hiding or they were in the Resistance in the fields somewhere outside of\nParis. I wasn\u2019t going to... Who was there, who was there to date? Anybody, anybody\nbetween the age of 20 and 25, there was none living or they were sick. Prisoners, killed,\nsick, Germans prisoners of war, or else there was nobody. I mean, there was a few, but\nvery few. Of course, I dated, but at the Sorbonne, mildly. But that\u2019s the other part of the\nResistance I got involved in.",
        "Q: At the Sorbonne?",
        "A: At the Sorbonne, that was delivery arms. It had nothing to do with the children of the\nJews.",
        "Q: So did, did you do that first, or at the same time? At...",
        "A: It was the same time...approximately.",
        "Q: Two different groups for whom you were working?",
        "A: The... The Resistance, 1t was extremely... First, 1t was very romantic \u2014 the only thing\nyou knew, you had somebody that hired you, and you depended on somebody above you.\nAnd you only knew \u2014 you only knew of that person was that the name he went by was\nnot his name. I was Michelle during the Resistance. Nobody knew where I lived, who I\nwas. You met in subways. You had to know nothing because of the torture. You had no\ninformation to give. I had no idea who the guy was; it was very, very seclusive (ph). I had\nno idea where he lived; I have not seen him ever. But he gave me orders and I filled out\nthe orders.",
        "Q: But how did it start? I mean, you were going to school...",
        "A: I met a guy at the Sorbonne. He was also a student. He was slightly older and he was\ninvolved. And I had a teacher, a history teacher, who was later, much later, the witness at\nmy wedding. He was teaching at what would be the Radcliffe of the time and he was a\nbig... He was a min... He was in the Cabinet, in fact. Minister... he was the Secretary or\nthe Minister of Information, or whatever. And his son put me in touch with that guy and\nthat guy would give me the orders. But he knew nothing about me and I know nothing to\nthis day about him either.",
        "Q: But he must have known enough to trust you.",
        "A: Because he knew where I came from. In other words, that teacher and his son had\nrecommended me as somebody solid. And there was also an element of that you had to,\nto risk.",
        "Q: And were you at all hesitant when you were approached...",
        "A: Oh, I loved it.",
        "Q: You loved it?",
        "A: Oh, it was funny.",
        "Q: Why?",
        "A: Wasn\u2019t it? I mean carrying, carrying arms.",
        "Q: And how, how would you do that, underneath your skirt? Or in a bag?",
        "A: In a bag.",
        "Q: In a bag?",
        "A: It wasn\u2019t... You know, at that time, they were not huge things; they were just little\npistols.",
        "Q: And so, where would you get the pistols, in the subway or something? Did someone pass\nyou one?",
        "A: Well, most of the meetings were in the subway, because everybody was in the subway.\nTo this day, they are still in the subway.",
        "Q: So, how would you know? You\u2019re told to go to the subway.",
        "A: Oh, you had to wear clothes \u2014 You had to wear your, your right-hand label is going to be\nthis way or you are going to wear \u2014 a flower, of course, or some sign, by which you\nwould be recognized. And the only thing you knew, that you would meet that person\nonce and never again. And his name was not his name, and if you fell in love with him,\ntoo bad for you, because you were never going to have an appointment with that one\nagain. Very, very stimulating.",
        "Q: So, you would meet this person, usually a boy, a man.",
        "A: Always a boy.",
        "Q: Always a boy.",
        "A: Oh, I know, one thing, also. Very French, and very... something that the Germans never\nunderstood: You would meet a boy and you knew that he was simpatico because he was\ninvolved the same cause as you were \u2014 and if the Germans were around, then you would\nhuddle.",
        "Q: As if you were kissing, as if you were lovers?",
        "A: That\u2019s right, in a corner of the porte-coche\u00e9re, and the man always protecting you. The\nman always with his broad back, so that if anything happened he was going to be hurt and\nyou were not going to be hurt. It was just delightful. And never again. Once or twice, I\nwould have given something to meet those guys again. But never again, it was never\ntwice the same.",
        "Q: So, these were very passionate moments and very exciting?",
        "A: They, they were exciting moments and they didn\u2019t last.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: But to this day, I remember them.",
        "Q: So explain... I see that \u2014 that you remember.",
        "A: Mm-hmm.",
        "Q: Explain why you were boy and girl together. And who would be carrying...",
        "A: Because then, then it was less, less dangerous. Then, the Germans were fooled. They\nreally thought they were witnessing a love affair. And who would dare interrupt a boy\nand a girl, twenty-one or -two, kissing in the corner of a door? Not a German, no, they\nwere too well behaved, no, no, no.",
        "Q: And who would carry the bag with the arms in 1t? Would you, a girl?",
        "A: Well, at that... probably, at that point, I had passed it on...to the man.",
        "Q: And how long would you be walking?",
        "A: Oh...",
        "Q: Do you think...a half hour or an hour or what?",
        "A: Yeah, one hour. All through Paris... not quite all through Paris. We really stayed around\nthe Latin Quarter. I was very much a student, my group was.",
        "Q: And would he then leave you, or you\u2019d...?",
        "A: Yeah, forever.",
        "Q: He would take it?",
        "A: He would take it and then that was it...never see him again. And the next day, I would\nget an order to meet somebody else, elsewhere in Paris, and...",
        "Q: And do it again.",
        "A: And do it again. Mm-hmm. But that was nothing; that had nothing to do with the Jews.",
        "Q: I under-... that this was just fighting the Germans. Do you, do you know the name of the,\nof the group with which you were associated?",
        "A: Mm-mm. No.",
        "Q: No, there was no, no knowledge of them.",
        "A: The less, the less you knew, the better off you all were. That\u2019s the sort of thing you go by.",
        "Q: If you can, explain this to me again, because I am a little bewildered about something.\nYou go into the subways; you meet somebody who has...",
        "A: You had an appointment; you had an appointment that... oh, and you never are ahead of\ntime more than five minutes, never, never. Never late, but never ahead of time. You\narrive promptly, you really \u2014 time was of the essence \u2014 you arrive at a certain time and\nyou do your job and you disappear and disperse, take another direction in the subway or\nwhatever.",
        "Q: And you don\u2019t want anybody loit-... loitering. It looks suspicious, I suppose.",
        "A: You don\u2019t want to be too involved too long. In other words, the faster that can go, the\nbetter.",
        "Q: But here, here\u2019s where my question 1s, \u2018cause I\u2019m not understanding something. When\nyou meet this guy, does he have the gun?",
        "A: Mm-hmm.",
        "Q: So, you were just...",
        "A: No, I have the gun.",
        "Q: Oh, you have the gun.",
        "A: Usually, I am bringing the arms to...",
        "Q: To him?",
        "A: To the other.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. Okay. So where then do you get the gun from then?",
        "A: Somebody...",
        "Q: Somebody has given it...",
        "A: ...or else at another place which I don\u2019t know. The man I don\u2019t know, and I will never\nsee him again, the same thing. And it goes a chain of command, and it goes way up and I\nhave no idea where it goes past a certain level \u2014 the guy I got my orders from. And even\nthat guy, I don\u2019t know who he is or who he was.",
        "Q: The guy who\u2019s name was Jacques, you don\u2019t know?",
        "A: Jacques or Pierre or Robert. And he knows he\u2019s going to meet somebody called Michelle\nand that was who I was at that time and we would never see each other, each other again.\nAnd you were not supposed to try to see each other again. [Pauses] We made it romantic.",
        "Q: It\u2019s romantic, but lonely.",
        "A: Oh, it was lonely in a way, but I was studying hard so that I wasn\u2019t lonely.",
        "Q: Did your mother know you were doing this?",
        "A: No. Ah, no! Ah, no! I know because she would have been endangered and that\u2019s the one\nthing I wanted to avoid. And also she was a babbler.",
        "Q: So you couldn\u2019t trust her?",
        "A: No, oh no, no.",
        "Q: Did you tell anybody? Did you have any close friends that you said something to?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so.",
        "Q: I\u2019m assuming you had close friends at this time.",
        "A: [pauses] \u00b041, \u00b042... Imoved out of my mother\u2019s place because I was endangering her. So,\nI took lodging at the student... it\u2019s still there.... on Boulevard St-Michel there was a\nstudent house. And I had, I had some friends that I had from the competitive years, you\nknow. Student friends, who knew nothing about my activities. No, it was... I mean,\nreally, if you call that lonely, that part was the silence.",
        "Q: And it\u2019s quite possible that people that you knew, with whom you were friends, were also\ndoing it, but nobody was talking, because you weren\u2019t supposed to.",
        "A: Yes, I don\u2019t know that... But maybe they were. Maybe they were. But we never\ndiscussed it afterwards. That was not something \u2014 but fun \u2014 it\u2019s done, it\u2019s disappeared,\nyou don\u2019t write about it, you forget about it. When I go to sleep, we were talking about\nthinking of... I think of all the times in Brittany in childhood. I don\u2019t think of those years\nat all. I never think of those years. Probably because they were so fleeting, the whole\nthing had to be fleeting in order to be safe for everybody.",
        "Q: Why do you say that you were endangering your mother? Since she was Jewish and you\nhad a baptism certificate and you were not suspected of being Jewish. Because of your\nactivities?",
        "A: Mm-hmm. If I had been caught... that would have endan-... Because I was not hiding\nwho I was, and therefore, she as a Jew would be endangered in another, at another level.",
        "Q: So, how did you explain to her why you left?",
        "A: That\u2019s why I didn\u2019t live with her.",
        "Q: I know, but why did you, how did you explain to her why you were leaving?",
        "A: Because I wanted my independence; that\u2019s why I had moved out.",
        "Q: And did you live nearby?",
        "A: Mm-hmm. Practically next door.",
        "Q: But in a, but in another building?",
        "A: In another building.",
        "Q: So, you saw your mother still very often?",
        "A: I must have, yeah. We were very close, we were very close.",
        "Q: Do you think she suspected you were doing something, or she believed you that you were\nbeing independent, to be living...?",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t think she was involved in my behavior. She thought I wanted to be\nindependent.",
        "Q: And were you working at this time? You had finished school, in \u201941, or not, or were you\nworking?",
        "A: I was on that scholarship and then again through school, I got a plum job, which\nconsisted [laughs] of teaching, but teaching people like, for instance, Dominique de\nVillepin, the present Minister of Foreign Affairs, had a father, whom I taught. Teaching\npeople from great families who were... failing. You know, they have that baccalaur\u00e9at,\nwhich 1s difficult. And so it was three or four hours in the morning, during which we\nwould tutor them 15 minutes at time, and see them all day long, always the same guy,\nteaching him everything for strictly that exam. And we had a practically 90 percent\nsuccess level. And that was very much fun, it was intensive teaching. I guess it... I never\nheard of it here too much. But over there, I think that school had some others created\nafter 1t, same intense \u2014 intensive teaching.",
        "Q: Was this a government job?",
        "A: No. And extremely well paid, oh boy!",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: A fortune, they paid you a fortune. But those were the, the, their parents were in the\nCabinet. They were the nerds\u2019 children \u2014 the guy at the school called them \u201cChildren of\nDegenerates\u201d, degenerates, children of degenerates and they were the cabinet members\u2019\nchildren, I mean, they were all...",
        "Q: [Laughs] Children of degenerates?",
        "A: Yes, that\u2019s the way we greeted them in the mornings. We were rough.",
        "Q: [Laughing] Did you give, did you give some of your salary to your mother?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: She didn\u2019t need it?",
        "A: Or I was egotistical, I don\u2019t remember any passing. Later on, I would help her in life,\nwhen I, after I was married. But, at that time I think that I was well-dressed, and...",
        "Q: So, did you, did you...",
        "A: And I paid... You know, it\u2019s far away, but I must have paid to stay at that student house.",
        "Q: You had to spend some of it...",
        "A: Mm-hmm.",
        "Q: Do you remember about how much it was?",
        "A: No, but it was royal.",
        "Q: So, you were now rolling in money in a way you hadn\u2019t before? Is that true? I mean, you\nhad...",
        "A: If it... because of the set-up of life in Paris, nothing changed. There were no cars to be\nhad, there were no... the great luxuries didn\u2019t exist, there were no furs... Yes, I had no...\nI was very slim, so I didn\u2019t even need to eat much. What were you going to spend your\nmoney on, simply clothes?",
        "Q: So, so let\u2019s talk about that a little bit. You have to have coupons to buy clothes and to buy\nfood, to have food. Was there, were there rations?",
        "A: That was late.",
        "Q: Or that was later?",
        "A: Yes. No, that was, that was then. We had coupons for bread, we had coupons for... heh,\nwe had coupons for wine, and, and coupons for cigarettes. I remember those three things.\nI remember the episode because my mother was the most unlikely chain-smoking roly-\npoly. She was a chain smoker. And the postman did not smoke but he sure liked to drink,\nso she exchanged all her wine for all his cigarettes. That was, that episode I remember, so\nthere were tickets. Also, well I gave my tickets away... to young men I loved, who had\nmothers who were sick, or whatever. I didn\u2019t, I didn\u2019t have many needs... What can you\ndo? There wasn\u2019t that much in the way of luxury to spend on and I had never been born\nor raised in luxury. It meant nothing to me.",
        "Q: Your... your room that you had, was it a room with a bathroom and a kitchen? Or did\nyou have to share with...",
        "A: No, no, I don\u2019t remember that, no. No, it was a student hostel. It\u2019s still there, on\nBoulevard St-Michel, and I think it was a room. And you know, they were not very heavy\non bathrooms, and definitely no kitchen.",
        "Q: Did you have heat?",
        "A: I guess so. I don\u2019t remember being deprived in any way...",
        "Q: You don\u2019t?",
        "A: No. Not at that time. Not in those circumstances",
        "Q: Well, we\u2019ve come very close to the end of the tape. So, I think we\u2019ll take a break and\nthen...",
        "A: Mm-hmm, but we are not talking about the thing that I came here for.",
        "Q: We are getting...",
        "A: We are getting there?",
        "Q: We\u2019re getting there.\nEnd of Tape #3\nTape #4",
        "Q: Nicole I, I don\u2019t want us to worry about whether something happened in 1941 or in 1942,\nbecause I\u2019m not sure anybody\u2019s memory can be clear about when things happened. But\ndo you have any recollection of whether, when you were smuggling the guns, that you\nmoved out from your mother, or was it... do you think it was later?",
        "A: No, I think I was still living with my mother when I did it. Because I used not to come\nback to the house, as I told you, not to come back to that apartment, not to involve her,\nnot to have her know about my activities. And so... And also for the date, I know that\nwhat really shook me was that Vel d\u2019Hiv... when the word came out, and it came out, not\nthat I saw the inside of the place, but rumor began circulating because, as I said it, was so\nclose to were everybody lived. And at that point, I thought I had to do something. But I\njust sort of had to do something.",
        "Q: More than what you were doing? \u2018Cause you obviously were doing something.",
        "A: Yes, but that had nothing to do with children and when they began touching children...",
        "Q: Then that bothered you.",
        "A: ... which was late, then I had to step in and do something. Because I was in a unique\nposition to probably be able to do something.",
        "Q: So, how did it happen that you started to try to save children, once you found out that\nthey were going to take children?",
        "A: My mother working with the Jewish organization had \u2014 thanks again to the organization\nof the German \u2014 an inkling or knowledge of the dates of the specific raids and the\naddresses of the specific raids. And that\u2019s the way I knew where to go to get the children.",
        "Q: But was... Do you have any idea how, why the Jewish organization knew? Were they in\nsome sense assisting with the Nazis?",
        "A: Well, when you think of it, they were terribly close to the enemy. It probably was. There\nwas a point there where it was unhealthy. But for my sake, it was practical. I think after\nthe war, there was some sort of disapproval of that sort of knowledge they had and the\nrelationship that they maybe shouldn\u2019t have had.",
        "Q: But when your mother... Your mother would give you the information...",
        "A: I guess that\u2019s the way I got it.",
        "Q: You think that\u2019s the way it came?",
        "A: Because there was no other way I could get it. And I know of what transpired after the\nwar about the U.G.I.F and how close they were with the Germans, because they knew of\nthe German work as it took place.",
        "Q: When your mother would give you this information, did she realize that you were going\nto do something? I mean, at that point, is she knowledgeable? \u201cCause she\u2019s just not\ngiving it to you casually.",
        "A: Probably, probably.",
        "Q: But you don\u2019t...",
        "A: But everything, everything was so...shrug your shoulder. You do it and then that\u2019s it. I\nthought it was normal, in other words, I never made... until you shook me up, I never\nthought of it. Definitely normal behavior. What are we going to do? Sit back and let it be.\nSo, I moved and in the same way, she thought it was absolutely normal that I, being the\ntype of person that I was, would feel that I had to do something. And I was in an unusual\nposition that I could do something. Because of the way the French government was going\nto protect me, one way or the other.",
        "Q: So you felt...",
        "A: Compelled.",
        "Q: [Coughs] I\u2019m sorry. You felt compelled to do something, but you also knew that the\nFrench government would protect you, which didn\u2019t mean that you were totally protected\nbecause the Germans might do something, yes?",
        "A: Well...",
        "Q: There was some danger.",
        "A: That came, that came \u2014 for instance, when I think of it, the vivid image I have is that\nmoment on the train in the middle of the night when a German soldier opened the\ncompartment door, and I felt at that point, I felt a very deep fear, because if the kid or\nwhoever it was that I was transporting \u2014 and it was a kid capable of talking \u2014 had given\nout anything to verify that I was not with the mother, I was dead \u2014 I was just as good as\ndead at that point. So, when I went into it, I didn\u2019t know the extent of the danger and\nmost of the time, probably, I wasn\u2019t discovered, so there was no danger. It worked well.",
        "Q: Right. But now you\u2019re doing this in connection with the underground group that you...",
        "A: No, it had nothing to do with the arms.",
        "Q: So, it\u2019s a different group.",
        "A: Completely different. That had to do with the Jewish U.G.LF.",
        "Q: All of it?",
        "A: The, the taking care, the taking children away, yes. Because otherwise I would not know\nwhere they were to be had, to start with, Paris being a big city.",
        "Q: So this was a Jewish underground...",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: ...organization that you were connected with.",
        "A: It wasn\u2019t really underground. It was the Jewish... administration of the Jews, at the\ntime...",
        "Q: The U.G.I.F., yeah, but this particular action was certainly not something that the\nGermans... You were not doing this openly?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And the only people that would have any inkling that I was doing it were the Jews, was\nthe Jewish organization in Paris.",
        "Q: So your mother \u2014 You recall your mother giving you the names and addresses of people\nyou were going to be taken. And they clearly, they were taking large groups of people at\nonce? Or they were taking a few at a time that they...?",
        "A: They came, they came individually. They would come to your apartment and ring, and if\nthe bell rang at four o\u2019clock in the morning, you knew who it was. And what happened is\nthat after the Vel d\u2019Hiv \u2014 this is when the Vel d\u2019Hiv come in \u2014 they would not anymore \u2014\nI didn\u2019t see it in the book \u2014 but they would not anymore tackle young children. So, the\nGermans were delighted to have somebody take them off their hands. Because it created\nsuch an endless fear of revolt among the French that they were afraid that at some point\nthe whole city would rebel against them. So, in some ways, I was in the middle. It was a\nsort of a cloaque, you know, of ugly things. It was some very shady participation there.\n\u2018Cause it had, at some point, to have the German willingness to give the babies, and that\nhappened at the very specific date. \u201cEnough with the babies! If there\u2019s one thing that we\ndon\u2019t need in Paris, it\u2019s that problem.\u201d And I stepped in and took that problem away from\ntheir hands.",
        "Q: Was anyone else doing it, do you know?",
        "A: That I would...not that I know of.",
        "Q: Not that you know of?",
        "A: I never mentioned it and nobody mentioned it to me. It was rare... It could have been\nobvious, you know, all those people taking a train.",
        "Q: So, let\u2019s talk about the process, you get names, and you...",
        "A: Addresses.",
        "Q: Addresses.",
        "A: Times, times, time, I guess.",
        "Q: These people did not necessarily expect you. You\u2019re just, you\u2019re just as surprising as the\nGermans knocking. For a different reason, but you\u2019re a surprise to them.",
        "A: Yes, and there is some persuading to do, because the women, as we know from personal\nexperience, do not give away their children. So I had some persuading to do to them,\nwhich was the difficult part. It was in two parts: first, \u201cThis is it, you are doomed\u201d\u2019.",
        "Q: You would tell them that?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know how I did, but I passed on that message. \u201cAs far as you are concerned, let it\nbe, there is nothing anybody can do. But there\u2019s something that that German soldier is\ngoing to allow to be done and that can be done: that I take that child away, and your child\nis safe.\u201d And then I would get the child. And the same day, he was in Italy, he or she, I\nremember.",
        "Q: Did you usually have one child?",
        "A: One child at a time.",
        "Q: One child at a time.",
        "A: I couldn\u2019t handle...",
        "Q: How long, how long would it...?",
        "A: I think the Jews \u2014 the Jewish association took care of them until the train time.",
        "Q: No, I mean, when you went to someone\u2019s apartment...",
        "A: I got the child. I got...",
        "Q: But how long would it take you to convince people usually? You would sit there for an\nhour, two hours or much less?",
        "A: [Scoffs] No, much less.",
        "Q: You don\u2019t have that much time?",
        "A: Much less, the Germans are not going to let me. They don\u2019t have the message. I have the\nmessage from the Germans at large; they don\u2019t. So they are brutal. They, they want the\nwhole thing finished and also maybe they have some human feeling that the whole thing\nis ugly, so they want it over with. So, I don\u2019t have much problem with them, I have the\nproblems with the woman.",
        "Q: You don\u2019t have problems with whom?",
        "A: With the Germans. The Germans have been given the message: \u201cNo children, no dealing\nwith children under the age of three\u201d. So, I had no problem with the German at that point.\nI am in a small apartment in nowhere in Paris, usually a poor neighborhood, not\nespecially a Jewish neighborhood and confronting a woman, and that\u2019s the woman that 1s\nthe problem or could be the problem.",
        "Q: Is the husband usually there, or not...?",
        "A: No, there were no men in Paris.",
        "Q: No men.",
        "A: He is either a prisoner of war or in the Resistance or he\u2019s out.",
        "Q: So, these women are alone?",
        "A: Women.",
        "Q: So, would it be very often very quickly that the people would say, \u201cOkay, take the\nchild\u2019?",
        "A: Yeah, I think when they saw Germans come in, they had a feeling that... of the ugliness\nof it. Even if they were uncultured and uninformed, they would sense the enormity of it\nand it wouldn\u2019t be a battle. I don\u2019t remember a battle. And then you would have to get the\nidentity of the child in order to after the war to be careful to have kept track.",
        "Q: Of who the child was.",
        "A: Of who the child was! And at that point, he was in Italy, the child was in Italy, ina\nconvent. And that\u2019s when another battle started with the Italians.",
        "Q: Were there mothers who refused to give you their, their children.",
        "A: Nope. Never did.",
        "Q: All of them \u2014 all of the mothers got...",
        "A: That\u2019s right. They would... all of the mothers would give a chance to the child.\nImmediately... what happened was that immediately they realized that there was no\nchance for them... with the Germans. There was no chance for them and if they took the\nchild with them, I told them in no uncertain terms \u201cThat child will not save you. The fact\nthat you have a child even at the breast will not save you.\u201d And the, the ugliness of the\nGerman soldiers was such that they felt it. And that I came from the, probably, I don\u2019t\nremember, but I came probably from the, from the Jewish agency, and that was\nreassuring for them. I had their identity, I had their card, and they trusted it. And then\nthey were, were in such a....state that they had to trust somebody.",
        "Q: Did you, by this time, understand sort of what was happening, that these people would be\nkilled?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: So you...",
        "A: I had a deep understanding. It didn\u2019t give me... I was 21. I thought everybody was dead\nat 25 or should be dead...",
        "Q: Anyway?",
        "A: ... anyway. And that it was the time limit for living, and that I was immortal, definitely. I\nnever felt that there was any \u2014 felt deeply that I was immortal.",
        "Q: So, did you think these Jews were going to be killed in a camp?",
        "A: Hmm. [nods]",
        "Q: You did.",
        "A: At that point, I had the feeling, because of the... because of the confrontation between the\nGerman soldier and the, and the women, I had the feeling that it was going to be very\nugly.",
        "Q: Now, do I understand you that the German was there with you sometimes?",
        "A: They, they were arresting the women.",
        "Q: At the same time?",
        "A: That\u2019s when I came.",
        "Q: You came at the time that they\u2019re arresting...?",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "Q: Oh, oh, I see...",
        "A: Because otherwise, the kid would not be left behind in the apartment all by himself.",
        "Q: No, see, I thought that you came prior to the Germans, that you would try to beat the\ntiming of the Germans. So you\u2019re there just as the German...?",
        "A: I wouldn\u2019t have had a chance.",
        "Q: Because the mothers wouldn\u2019t do it?",
        "A: They wouldn\u2019t do it. But when they see \u2014 saw the Germans come for the family and\nthey\u2019re willing to let go of the child. Then they realize the danger they were in, and they\nwere willing to let go of the child.",
        "Q: That\u2019s quite amazing. I didn\u2019t \u2014 I had no idea that it was...",
        "A: Well, when you think of it, it\u2019s the only way it made sense.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: And it was not very difficult because they really banged \u2014 they didn\u2019t knock at the door \u2014\nthey really banged at the door. And they looked... very... you would have to have a\npicture them \u2014 they were Gestapo soldiers; they were not regular German soldiers. Or\nthey were French policemen. But the whole, the whole episode was very dramatic and the\nwomen felt it.",
        "Q: So, when they knocked at the door or...",
        "A: They banged at the door!",
        "Q: ...banged at the door, were you standing with them? Or did you, after they got in, you\nwent in with...? I mean, how... where were you...?",
        "A: I guess I must have been with them.",
        "Q: It\u2019s quite amazing when you think about it, no?",
        "A: The whole thing is amazing, that it took place and I... and we survived.",
        "Q: Was there a lot of screaming and crying, with the children...?",
        "A: At other times, at other times, when I was taken with my mother, it was, it was another\nthing. When they finally got my number and came for me early morning. At that point,\nthere were a lot of hysterics. But when it was individual, the mothers were very\nprotective of the child and if you have a young child, you don\u2019t want to be hysterical in\nfront of the child, so they kept the face.",
        "Q: But often, the child feels the terror...",
        "A: They feel it but they freeze.",
        "Q: But they freeze?",
        "A: Which is what saved my life in the train when the Germans came in the compartment was\nthat the reaction of fear in that child then is going to be freezing and not yelling.",
        "Q: But what happened to you when you, you... On the one hand, you\u2019re going to probably\nsave the child. On the other hand, you know that this child\u2019s mother is going to be killed\nand that the child will never see the mother again.",
        "A: It was very dichotomique. Yeah, it didn\u2019t faze me.",
        "Q: It didn\u2019t faze you?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Was that because you were saving someone, or just because you...?",
        "A: I think, you had to be anesthesized (ph) or you\u2019re not going to work for the procedure.",
        "Q: You had to what?",
        "A: To be anesthesized.",
        "Q: Anesthesized.",
        "A: In some way, if you are very deeply involved in the whole procedure of the Germans,\nyou\u2019re not going to do it. You\u2019re going to miss it; you had to keep your composure.",
        "Q: So, the mother is taken, you have the child...",
        "A: Then, I give it during the day to the Jewish thing because I have to get my train ticket.\nThere is a procedure.",
        "Q: So you go to the U.G.LF. and they keep the children, the child.",
        "A: They keep the children until...",
        "Q: Until you leave?",
        "A: Right, until train time comes. And then I get my ticket, the children were traveling free,\nand then I get my ticket, always in the same direction: Paris-Nice.",
        "Q: Paris-Nice?",
        "A: Paris-Nice, which is the Paris-M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e. That\u2019s a very straight train, it 1s an\novernight.",
        "Q: An overnight train?",
        "A: It\u2019s an overnight train, so it was nice.",
        "Q: Now, were most of the children actually babies or...?",
        "A: The ones I took care of were all under three.",
        "Q: Were all under three? But some of them could talk a little bit?",
        "A: Yes. But not in front of Germans, they wouldn\u2019t.",
        "Q: They talked to you?",
        "A: Oh, babbled, yes.",
        "Q: Babbled.",
        "A: But they knew I wasn\u2019t their mother. But they were in pretty bad shape, bad day, you\nknow. They had had a bad day.",
        "Q: And did you try to comfort them?",
        "A: Sure, I was... warm and nice, but I was only 21. I hadn\u2019t even slept with a man; I was out\nof it. In the deep sense that I would have been when I had my own children in my arms,\ncompletely different, which probably helped.",
        "Q: Yes I...",
        "A: I would have become hysterical myself otherwise.",
        "Q: So, you'd be on the train, did you...?",
        "A: Then I took the train and...",
        "Q: Did you have... If there were babies, did you have diapers, did you have changing\nclothes?",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes, yes the U.G.I.F. organized... I had, I had the stuff.",
        "Q: Did they teach you how to change diapers?",
        "A: Oh, well. [shrugs]",
        "Q: Or did you know?",
        "A: At the time, you know, it was during war years, you did what you could. And they are not\nthat keen on cleanliness. But the child was safe. And I \u2014 they had \u2014 they had those long\nbanks, which are fairly padded. And I would give my warmth, in other words, I would\nput the baby on me so that, you know and I would wrap my arms around, so that the child\nfelt protected at the end of a difficult day. It was a difficult. I, I tried to feel for the baby.\nIt must have been very horrible. But they fell asleep and that\u2019s... until they stopped and\nthey...",
        "Q: So, then you would get off at Nice, yes?",
        "A: Yes, I had that episode when the Germans came in and the child...",
        "Q: Uh-huh. And then what happened?",
        "A: Because one time, the Germans, they were patrolling the train. I don\u2019t know what for, but\nfor... And at that time, I was frightened. Because my life was really on the line, if the kid\ngave me away. But I can remember, they absolutely froze; they never said a word, they\nwere just stiff with fear. They remembered the morning episode, the separation of their\nmother. It was the end of a terrible day. So, I didn\u2019t have any problem with the children,\nand we arrived in Nice finally. And I still remember, I still remember the view of the\nItalians. The Italians were cowards made live and had declared war with France, their\nneighbor, in June \u201940 and had moved militarily to Nice. That\u2019s all. [Laughs] That\u2019s all\nthey could manage. And so they occupied from Monaco to Nice, which is 30 kilometers\nof France territory. But for those kids it meant life and death because when you saw an\nItalian soldier, you knew that they were not going to kill any babies. So that\u2019s it. And I\nknow that they took them to some religious institution in Italy.",
        "Q: Now, was this established that the Italians police \u2014 oh, not the Italian police \u2014 the soldiers\nwould take...",
        "A: No, they were in the train station.",
        "Q: They were just there and you just gave it to them? You just gave it...",
        "A: Yes, yeah, yes. But at that time, the, the Jewish organization in Paris must have\ncommunicated. They had contact near the frontier, and those children were taken to\nconvents. And I know that because there was an enormous ruckus between those\nconvents and Israel, at the end of the war, because Israel wanted those Jewish kids to\ncome to Israel. And the Italians wouldn\u2019t give them. At that point, I thought it was a huge\njoke, I couldn\u2019t care less... what happened, they were alive. Whether they were Israeli\ncitizen or Italian citizen or no citizen, they were safe.",
        "Q: Now, how did people keep track of which child was, was actually who... you know what\nI mean? ...the identity of the child?",
        "A: Well, well I... that would be given to whoever was handed the child. I would give the\npap-whatever written scribbles I had about the identity of the mother.",
        "Q: I see. So, that would go with the child and then that would be given...",
        "A: Then that could be their problem.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: I got rid of that problem with the child.",
        "Q: So, as far as you knew, these soldiers would bring these babies...",
        "A: Oh, as far as I know from documentation, from movies, from everything that has been\nwritten, there was not one child killed by Italians.",
        "Q: And you would then stay overnight in Nice? Or go right... Or turn around and...?",
        "A: I had a feeling that I had to come back if only so that my mother wouldn\u2019t be worried and\nsuspicious, and so that I could continue in my studies or whatever I was doing. But that\nwas the least of my worries, so I don\u2019t really remember. I don\u2019t think I stayed in Nice \u2014 I\ndidn\u2019t have any money.",
        "Q: How long a trip did it take?",
        "A: Hmm\u2019?",
        "Q: How long a trip did you have?",
        "A: It\u2019s an overnight.",
        "Q: It\u2019s an overnight, so that if you would come in the morning...",
        "A: Yes, I guess I must \u2014 must have stayed somewhere. Maybe there was a day train. I have\nno idea of the return. That was...",
        "Q: But you think that you were still staying at mother\u2019s house, or you were in the other\nplace?",
        "A: I had another place and one night, I was so tired coming back early, I came to sleep at her\nplace and that\u2019s when the Germans got us. So it was a...",
        "Q: You were going back...",
        "A: I was going back and forth.",
        "Q: Did your mother ever become suspicious? Ever say anything to you?",
        "A: Well, she must have known there was something going on. She knew better than to ask.",
        "Q: Do you remember approximately how many trips you took?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Five? Ten? No? You have no idea?",
        "A: No, probably not more than ten. I remember just a very few of them, and definitely part\nof the job was not to count.",
        "Q: Do you have in your head pictures of some of these kids?",
        "A: Hmm\u2019?",
        "Q: Do you have in your head pictures of some of these kids? Do you see yourself on the\ntrain with these babies?",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes, that I do. Some moments are very clear.",
        "Q: Are you crying about this?",
        "A: No, that they were children and they were in my lap and they were sleeping and that\ndamn door flew opened.",
        "Q: It was pretty scary when the Germans...?",
        "A: Oh, yeah, that was for me, too. But the people in the compartment never knew much\neither. They didn\u2019t like \u2014 nobody liked to be asked by the Germans about their I.D. in the\nmiddle of the night.",
        "Q: So, one night instead of going to your little studio apartment...",
        "A: ...1 went back to sleep in my bed.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And that night, that morning, they came. Unmistakable knock at the door. And they were,\nthose were French policemen, two little French policemen almost may age.",
        "Q: Little ones? Almost your age?",
        "A: Yes, they were maybe 23 to my 21, but very young. And I remember them \u2014 they were\nalmost my size and they followed me... to where I washed. They watched me wash,\nsupposedly because they were afraid I was going to commit suicide.",
        "Q: So wait, wait, wait a second; they come to your mother\u2019s house...?",
        "A: They come to my mother\u2019s house.",
        "Q: Why do they come \u2014 for you do you think? What do they say?",
        "A: To take me to the Germans.",
        "Q: Take you? So do you think that they were...?",
        "A: And my mother.",
        "Q: ... tracking you...?",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "Q: In terms of your work?",
        "A: I think, I think that they were, yes. I think they were tracking me finally.",
        "Q: So they... Well, some Germans knew what you were doing because you were at the door\nwith them.",
        "A: Yes, right.",
        "Q: However, you thought this was okay...",
        "A: Well, as I said, I was blissfully lackadaisical. I... 1t is a tendency I have kept through my\nlife. I think it helps with the bumps of life altogether.",
        "Q: Now, do you think they were coming for you and your mother, or you, and they\nhappened to pick up your mother at the same time?",
        "A: They happened to pick up my mother [laughs] at the same time.",
        "Q: So all along, it\u2019s your mother who you think is in danger...",
        "A: Mm-hmm. And at that point mostly... What was lovely at that point was that the only\npapers that she carried was my baptism certificate. And she let those little soldiers, those\nlittle policemen, French policemen follow me and see as much of me as possible. She\ndidn\u2019t say, \u201cLeave her alone. Don\u2019t go to the bathroom with her.\u201d No, she wanted as\nmuch intimacy between those two little guys and her little daughter as possible. And that,\nat the end of the morning, is what saved our lives.",
        "Q: She was smart.",
        "A: Because then we were taken to the Germans. Then we were taken to the Marais and the\nGerman scene was very... That\u2019s when the women were hysterical. And there were 52 of\nus, as I remember, and they knew that I was going to get out. And they all gave me their\nlists of addresses and people to notify. And not one of single one of them came back\nalive. So, what happened is that the scene got uglier and uglier and at some point, as you\nsee in movies, you are pushed into a courtyard. And in the courtyard, there 1s a truck and\nthe back of the truck flips down and at that point, you\u2019re pushed in. And at that moment,\nit was bedlam. The women were hysterical. The whole tr-... the whole thing was\ncrowded; there were too many people for the courtyard. And my mother kept after those\ntwo little guys \u2014 and she was much more in danger than you can imagine \u2014 was keeping\nafter them saying, \u201cLet her go, she shouldn\u2019t be here, let her go!\u201d And at some point, they\nsaid, \u201cThe hell with you, get out of here!\u201d And at that point, I lost all my courage. I began\nto cry and she found all her courage back and she was, that little roly-poly with no\ngumption at all, was smiling and said, \u201cOkay, let\u2019s get out.\u201d And she knew how to get out\nand she knew how to find the caf\u00e9. And she stood there at the Jewish caf\u00e9, which 1s still\nthere, it\u2019s a Jewish caf\u00e9, and she plunked down and she had to have her cafe, in front of\nall the trucks going by.",
        "Q: We have to stop.\nEnd of Tape #4\nTape #5",
        "Q: Nicole, I would like to bring you back to when these two guys, the police \u2014 the French\npoliceman and French detective, am I correct? Or are they two French police?",
        "A: Two French policemen.",
        "Q: Two French policemen, no detective. When they come in, the bang on the door, were you\n\u2014 are you actually sleeping yet?",
        "A: Sure.",
        "Q: You are sleeping.",
        "A: It was four or five in the morning.",
        "Q: And...",
        "A: They take you to the subway.",
        "Q: No, but what do they say? Do they say anything? They\u2019re in the house, but not very long.\nThey just say...",
        "A: They, they, they...",
        "Q: \u201cCome out.\u201d",
        "A: The same thing that they must say around the world, \u201cI.D. verification.\u201d I.D. verification,\nwhatever that meant, or whatever.",
        "Q: So, your mother has the presence of mind to take your baptism certificate.",
        "A: Oh, that! She was carrying it...",
        "Q: All the time?",
        "A: All that morning. She practically slept with it. Yes, 1t was very meaningful to her that I\nwould survive those experiences.",
        "Q: So, she has that.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: But they know she is Jewish of course because she...",
        "A: Yes, she wears the star, mm-hmm. It\u2019s five o\u2019clock in the morning and we go on the\nsubway and it\u2019s filled with working class people. And they don\u2019t like it at all. You could\nfeel that they do it very early, but still get the lower class, working class people and those\nare the least prejudiced probably. And they don\u2019t like what they are seeing. They, they\nknow it\u2019s going to be ugly and they had those two women surrounded by those two police\nofficers.",
        "Q: Are you finally frightened at that moment?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No, you\u2019re still not frightened?",
        "Q: Takes you, takes you a while. So, they bring you to Marais?",
        "A: To the Marais.",
        "Q: The Marais?",
        "A: To the hotel in front of Flambaum, which is still there. A beautiful hdtel particulier. And\nthere, they take us to the... There that the Germans are, and then it becomes ugly, ugly, I\nmean, they start... My mother puts her hand on the table and they whipped her. So, that\nsort of behavior I hadn\u2019t seen before.",
        "Q: And do they ask you questions? Is there an interrogation or not?",
        "A: Well they ask for I.D. and I showed the I.D. and so they, they know that it is I and it 1s\nmy mother. And then we went into a waiting room with 50 other people, all women and\nchildren that morning, by the way.",
        "Q: And at this point, do you know that they\u2019re going to deport you? Do they say anything?\nThey\u2019re going to take you somewhere?",
        "A: I guess so. There was no other thought that you could have; that was it.",
        "Q: Do you remember what you were wearing? Did they, did they allow you to change your\nclothes from your pajamas or nightshirt or whatever you were wearing?",
        "A: Yes, since they watched me wash, they watched me dress! I was wearing the same thing I\nwore during the whole war years. I spent a lot on shoes. As I told you, the rich don\u2019t give\nup their shoes, so the luxury for me was to have shoes made to mesure \u2014 custom made.\nAnd no stockings because there were no stockings to be had during the war and, you\nknow, I remember the coat, which was very handsome. It was cut up from the beautiful\ncoat of a man cousin of mine, the rich cousins. So, I was simply well-dressed, no hat.",
        "Q: They watched you get dressed?",
        "A: They watched me get undressed...",
        "Q: And dressed?",
        "A: Wash...",
        "Q: And dressed.",
        "A: They went to the bathroom with me. So they watched me wash, bare.",
        "A: They sat around the sink with me while I washed.",
        "Q: Because...",
        "A: They didn\u2019t speak, but they were with me. And I came back and I snuck to the bathroom\nand that was so small they couldn\u2019t get in. But they stayed at the door of the bathroom. I\nwent to the bathroom and I went to my room and I got dressed and they were there when\nI got dressed. Then that\u2019s when they got attached.",
        "Q: And that, in part \u2014 they may have done it anyway \u2014 but your mother knew that that was\nsomehow... might, might work that they might get attached if they...",
        "A: I don\u2019t think that...",
        "Q: No?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think it was a conscious thought.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: They would have done anyhow. I mean, that was part of the.. humiliating you. You\nknow, it\u2019s humiliating to have somebody watch what you are washing your behind are\ntwo young people, snickering. They didn\u2019t snicker. They didn\u2019t say anything, do\nanything, just watched...but they were French.",
        "Q: But they were French.",
        "A: They were in a French uniform. And then we went to the subway, in second class, not\nspecially in a compartment. And those were French people going to work very early in\nthe morning. Therefore, those are not the bourgeois; those are the working class people.\nAnd you feel that they didn\u2019t like it.",
        "Q: Did they... anybody say anything?",
        "A: No! That was dangerous. Those French people were a... police people are... well, they\nhad their batons, at least, you know; it was dangerous to say anything.",
        "Q: When your mother was hit on the hand once you were in...",
        "A: She just took her hand off.",
        "Q: And that\u2019s all they did? They didn\u2019t, they didn\u2019t beat her; they simply didn\u2019t want her\nhand on the table, do you think?",
        "A: Just a whip.",
        "Q: Yeah, and it hurt?",
        "A: Probably, she didn\u2019t say anything.",
        "Q: So, you were then put in this room with about 50 other people, mainly women \u2014 or all\nwomen and children, no men.",
        "A: Mm-hmm, it was just women and children, no men at all.",
        "Q: And is there someone in the room guarding you?",
        "A: It\u2019s supposed... There is a room where the Germans are. And then there is the other\nroom. There is no need; there is nowhere to go.",
        "Q: Because the only exit...",
        "A: Would be through that room, which had their desk.",
        "Q: Any windows?",
        "A: I think there was, going into the courtyard. Nobody tried anything. They were kind of,\nyou go into a sort of what you would call a state of shock. You are not quite at your most\nvivid at that moment.",
        "Q: So, people are not talking?",
        "A: People are not talking, but they are passing pieces of paper to me with their name and\naddresses to contact.",
        "Q: But that\u2019s only when they knew that you were leaving?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No, they just did it.",
        "A: From the word go, they knew I had a baptism certificate. And my mother was flaunting it\nprobably and talking about it. And they knew that if one person had a chance of getting\nout, I was the one, and therefore I could contact, because they had no way of contacting\ntheir relatives. So, I came out with a list of names and addresses.",
        "Q: [Background person says something to interviewer] Okay, so we\u2019re now back after that\nlittle interruption. So...",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: So, people are handing you names of relatives that you can contact because they think, if\nanybody gets out, it\u2019ll be you.",
        "A: Yeah. And it was. Fifty-two of them, not one of them otherwise.",
        "Q: So, all of you go out to the courtyard, the truck comes, that little...",
        "A: Flips down.",
        "Q: Flips down.",
        "A: I saw a movie once that, that depicted that. That\u2019s the only movie that was about the time\nthat was realistic to me. It shows the truck \u2014 that\u2019s when you knew \u2014 and the back flips\ndown, and you\u2019re pushed in, and then that\u2019s it.",
        "Q: And was it, was it very rough? Was it a very large truck or smaller...?",
        "A: Was enough to get...dozens of people. It was a big truck. It took the courtyard. And the\npolicemen were going on the side of the courtyard toward the exit...and by that time they\nwere petrified.",
        "Q: And were people screaming?",
        "A: The women were somewhat hysterical. They were crying; if you were screaming, you\nwould be whipped. But sobbing probably and it was not pretty.",
        "Q: Now are you in the back? One of the last ones so that your mother can find...? I mean\nthese two policemen...",
        "A: At that point, my mother was following the policemen, so we must have gone to the side\nof it. And she was talking to them constantly, saying, \u201cLook at her, she should not be\nhere, let her go\u201d.",
        "Q: Then they finally said...",
        "A: Then they said...",
        "Q: \u201cGet the hell out of here\u201d\u2019.",
        "A: \u201cEh, merde, foutez le camp! Foutez le camp!\u201d",
        "Q: What did they say?",
        "A: \u201cMerde! Foutez le camp!\u201d They were tired of the whole scene.",
        "Q: Were there Germans there also?",
        "A: Yes, there were Germans, but it was such a confused set-up. There were only a few\nGerman soldiers; there were two French policemen who stayed out of the way; and there\nwere 52 \u2014I counted them \u2014 52 Jews. With a lot of commotion, because it\u2019s a lot of crying\nof babies and yelling of mothers; they forecast the worst.",
        "Q: So, when these two guys said...",
        "A: \u201cThe hell with you!\u201d",
        "Q: \u201cGet the hell out of here.\u201d",
        "A: \u201cGet the hell out of here.\u201d",
        "Q: Right. Where do, where did... how do you get out?",
        "A: That\u2019s when my mother suddenly recovered and became a very clear-eyed mother again.\nAnd I became nothing in tears.",
        "Q: At that moment...",
        "A: At that moment, the change of personality was unbelievable. She became the mother-in-\ncharge and I became the child good-for-nothing and in tears. And then she pulled me out.\nWell, you\u2019d have to see the porte-coche\u00e9re \u2014 It\u2019s a very specific thing for those enormous\nmansions, where they used to have the carriages come in with the four horses and a cart,\nright? So that\u2019s the courtyard and the porte-coche\u00e9re 1s opened \u2014 it had to be opened \u2014 and\nthat\u2019s the entrance that\u2019s an enormous entrance, enough for the truck to come out.",
        "Q: And you went out the same way that the truck...",
        "A: Yes! We went out by the truck! The truck was occupying the whole courtyard and we just\nsneaked away and the Ger-... the... two little French policemen were there and we went\nout.",
        "Q: No Germans saw you as far as you know? Certain...",
        "A: They were very busy. It was bedlam.",
        "Q: And as soon as you get out...",
        "A: My mother goes to Flambaum. She crossed the street and I said, \u201cYou are out of...!\u201d And\nwe see the truck going out... with the 50 people inside. And she\u2019s at the caf\u00e9 terrace \u2014\nterrace! \u2014 not even inside! On the terrace! She said, \u201cI have to have my coffee,\u201d and she\nhas her coffee. And Flambaum 1s patting her hand and saying, \u201cOh, madame, things will\nbe all right\u2019. And so the whole scene was preposterous.",
        "Q: Did people in the Flambaum know who, know what...",
        "A: There was nobody.",
        "Q: There was nobody...?",
        "A: It was very early still.",
        "Q: But somebody was there to serve you.",
        "A: Yes, but it wasn\u2019t a crowded terrace like the Montparnasse in...",
        "Q: And why do think that she went there? Was she just so exhausted from...?",
        "A: She just...yeah, I don\u2019t know, emotionally, she was drained, what you would say.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Funny how you can have your highs and then suddenly are completely wiped out. And\nshe always drank, drank coffee. She was a chain smoker and a heavy coffee drinker.",
        "Q: Now, did you stop crying as soon as you got out of that courtyard?",
        "A: Sure.",
        "Q: And why did, I mean, you may not know the answer to this question, but why at that\nmoment when the two police said, \u201cHell, get out of here!\u201d\u2019, you leave, why were you\ncrying then?",
        "A: I think it was, the whole thing was a little too much.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: I was overwhelmed. It was because it was such an ugly scene.",
        "Q: And you had never seen that...",
        "A: Yeah, can you imagine 50 women knowing they are doomed? And here I had talked with\nthem five minutes before. And they were young women with their children. They were\ngetting them younger and younger.",
        "Q: Hmm. [Long pause] You still see it, don\u2019t you?",
        "A: Hmm\u2019?",
        "Q: You can, you can see it now, can\u2019t you?",
        "A: Oh, sure. I\u2019m not making any effort to... [Chuckles].",
        "Q: To hide it. [Laughs] Did you get angry?",
        "A: No. No, not really. I never was angry, all through it. I rarely, rarely get angry...doesn\u2019t\nhelp.",
        "Q: But you got sad.",
        "A: Oh, that I do. And I don\u2019t get revengeful either. I remember when Paris fell. The\nAmericans marched down the Champs Elys\u00e9es. And I wanted to see the redition (ph) of\nthe Germans; so I went to the Arc de Triomphe. And the behavior of the French, who had\nbeen so non-committal during the war, was atrocious. They were spitting at... you know,\nby that time the Germans were putting in arms some people who were 18 and... nothing\nlittle fellows, who had seen nothing, done nothing. They were just marching, and they\nhad to have their head \u2014 their hands on their head to shame them. And the French \u2014 I was\npreventing the French from hurting the Germans. These were the wrong ones, anyhow.\nBut the scene was very ugly. The French didn\u2019t ever behave well.",
        "Q: No matter what was...?",
        "A: No matter what was happening, they were wrong, on the wrong side.",
        "Q: On the other hand, you speak of at least some of the war years, where the French are\nangry enough at the Germans to have a certain kind of...",
        "A: Those are popular classes that don\u2019t go to the Champs Elys\u00e9es to see the Americans\nmarch down.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: It\u2019s very funny how it is a city, the city 1s divided; those are not the same people.",
        "Q: Mm-hmm, so when you say the French...",
        "A: They were... We were at Passy. You see the Americans march at the Arch of Triumph.\nThat\u2019s near where we were, at my grandparents\u2019 house in Passy. Those are the exquisite,\nbroad avenues, and... little working people were not anywhere.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s go back to the caf\u00e9. You\u2019re in the caf\u00e9 and you\u2019re seeing the trucks... One truck?\nMore than one truck?",
        "A: No, one. I remember only one because that was the one where I would have gone and\nwhere the women I was talking with were going.",
        "Q: And did... How long did you sit there with your mother?",
        "A: Not long, just until after they had gone. And then, then she decided she wanted to go back\nto her apartment, where we had been captured the day before \u2014 the same day! To get her\nsilverware, of all things, I mean, she never... She always was one train behind, you\nknow.",
        "Q: So did you go?",
        "A: Sure!",
        "Q: You went back, so...",
        "A: And the Germans, in their disorganization, never went back to that apartment. They had\ndone their hit.",
        "Q: But you thought that they might come back to...",
        "A: Well I... It wasn\u2019t the most comfortable place for me to be. And to see that little fatty...\nAnd have you ever \u2014 and the crystal ware \u2014 have you ever piled crystal ware in a box? It\nbreaks as you put it down. It was utterly absurd; it was very much my mother. And then\nshe gave it to the neighbor downstairs to keep for the rest of the war. And one day, all\nafter the war, it was all there. But the Germans never came back to that apartment.",
        "Q: So, she packed what she thought was valuable...",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: ...and gave it to the neighbor downstairs.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: ...And then, did you pack any clothes? Did you pack anything?",
        "A: We didn\u2019t have much.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. And then you went Passy to...",
        "A: Yes, to live, and we lived out the rest of the war there. And when there was the liberation\nof Paris, I remember that I went from Passy \u2014 it was a very short walk to the Eiffel Tower\n\u2014 and I remember the American who flew under the Eiffel Tower. They were having so\nmuch fun liberating Paris. They were the anti-German. Imagine, flying under the Eiffel\nTower. They had fun.",
        "Q: Small plane.",
        "A: Small plane, but still...",
        "Q: You went to the apartment of your...",
        "A: ... grandparents.",
        "Q: Father\u2019s parents, right...",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Right? That side of the family?",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "Q: And they were in Brittany. They had gone...",
        "A: They stayed in Brittany all through the war.",
        "Q: So you, your mother had keys to that apartment.",
        "A: Sure.",
        "Q: Yeah, okay.",
        "A: Then there was a concierge. And what is funny is that the concierge never gave us up.\nYou had to... you were in danger all the time. All that was necessary \u2014 Passy was\nsurrounded by Germans; all the beautiful apartment buildings were occupied by\nGermans.",
        "Q: So, if this is the case, are you any longer doing any work with the underground?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember.",
        "Q: You don\u2019t remember?",
        "A: What we did then was hide people in that apartment.",
        "Q: Then you hide people?",
        "A: Yes, but they were older then. But people who were in danger of being deported. I had a\nbed; it never was empty. I was heavily dating, the curfew was midnight, so I would come\nback at midnight, get into my bed and it was full of people. Not full of people, but it was\nat least one person here, one person there, it would be...",
        "Q: Now, wait a minute. Now, now it\u2019s getting complicated.",
        "A: They were people who were hiding.",
        "Q: Right, but how... how would they come to you...?",
        "A: They knew...",
        "Q: They knew your mother?",
        "A: They knew my mother and they knew me and knew that we had survived and we were at\nPassy, they had the address and wanted an apartment for overnight. So, it served as a sort\nof a refuge.",
        "Q: For the night and then they would leave?",
        "A: Yes. And then they would have to find a permanent place where to hide until the\nliberation of France. And that I found for them. I found among my friends people who\nwould be willing to take women, children, whatever, for years to come. And it was\nmagnificent. At that point, among friends, that you found people who were willing to\nhelp, really to help. And I kept, kept those friends on both ends. The people who took\ncare of the people who were taken care of \u2014 I saw them until they died.",
        "Q: And, and how...?",
        "A: In the living room, I remember one. I was talking with friends of the fate of a young\nwoman that I knew whose husband had been taken, and nephew had been killed at the\nage of 18 months. The whole family was absolutely destroyed. And she was beginning a\npregnancy so she really wanted that child, because her husband just had been taken. And\nshe came to live with us at Passy. And then I saw a friend one day when she was there,\nand I said, \u201cWho on earth is going to be able to take you, pregnant, for the rest of your\npregnancy, to salvage the child?\u201d And the friend said, \u201cI will!\u2019 And she had her in her\nliving room \u2014 she had a very small place \u2014 for the remainder of the year. And they\nbecame the best of friends after the war. They did \u2014 had two houses with joint backyards.\nBut then, they never forget. I will. So, there were some individual cases of French\ndevotion.",
        "Q: So, how many people did you help, you and your mother, do you think?",
        "A: [Sighs] That was a flow...I don\u2019t know how long... you had the... we have to think of\ndates, that was \u00b043, \u201944. It was just one year...",
        "Q: Right, one year.",
        "A: One year. And then the Americans debarked and that was over. Although they continued\ndeporting, but I didn\u2019t know it then.",
        "Q: But you were not hiding. You were heavily... You describe yourself as heavily dating!\nSo, you\u2019re going out? Who are you going out with?",
        "A: If you... you can...If you were cute, you can always find a man [Laughs].",
        "Q: Were these boys in the underground? I mean, there\u2019s not a lot of men...",
        "A: Medical, medical doctors like my brother, anybody who was in one of those higher\nschools of higher learning were there.",
        "Q: Did you fall in love a lot?",
        "A: Hmm\u2019?",
        "Q: Did you fall in love a lot?",
        "A: Constantly.",
        "Q: Constant...",
        "A: The door opened and there I was. [Laughs]",
        "Q: Yes?",
        "A: Yes, I dated...I remember, I dated several times during the evening. And the best date\nwas around ten o\u2019clock. Six o\u2019clock, not very good; eight wasn\u2019t really better, but the ten\no\u2019clock date was really the serious one of the evening. That was... my heavy dating,\nnothing ever happened, but it was very exhilarating.",
        "Q: So, you would date three guys in one...?",
        "A: Oh, yes, uh-huh.",
        "Q: So, what would you do? Dinner with one and drinks with another...?",
        "A: Yes, right.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: Mm-hmm. And Paris is a lovely city where to walk.",
        "Q: Was... were people sexually free during this time or not?",
        "A: Not L.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: No. I don\u2019t think it was at all the morals of the generation. You are talking to somebody\nwho is in her 80s. That was 60 years ago, you know. I think that behavior is only in the\nlast... It became much more lax in America with my daughter\u2019s generation. But I had not\nseen it in my generation.",
        "Q: So, when you say it was more... the 10 o\u2019clock date... I don\u2019t know if you planned it like\nthis, but 10 o\u2019clock, it was more exciting. Is that because the...?",
        "A: Kissing.",
        "Q: Uh-huh, so there was a lot of...?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Yeah, of course, very exciting.",
        "A: So, that\u2019s why it had to be that time.",
        "Q: So, did you choose people you were dating at the particular hours? You knew what was\ngoing to happen, sort of?",
        "A: Well, we made an appointment.",
        "Q: Were you frightened of being caught? Or you didn\u2019t care?",
        "A: Anyhow, when you are out with a guy, you don\u2019t feel that frightened. No, I didn\u2019t have\nthe tendency to feel frightened.",
        "Q: Were you now carrying around your baptismal papers or not?",
        "A: I could not find them for the life of me. They are not important. [Laughs]",
        "Q: What did your I.D. card say? Nothing? Just your name.",
        "A: That, I probably could find it. I have it.",
        "Q: You do have it?",
        "A: I had it; it did say my name. I never destroyed papers, so somewhere in a box, I might \u2014 if\nI find it, Pll send it to you.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: At the museum.",
        "Q: And how, how are you getting coupons for food? I mean, you\u2019re not working, right? Or\nare you working?",
        "A: No, but my mother could collect for, for us.",
        "Q: Because she\u2019s working for... She\u2019s still working...?",
        "A: No, no you could not. No, no, this is the official French government that gave them at the\nmairie and mairie, at the...",
        "Q: Was giving coupons?",
        "A: Yes, you get your coupons every month. Everybody did.",
        "Q: So, is your mother at home all the time now?",
        "A: When?",
        "Q: After, after the arrest, when you go to Passy?",
        "A: I forgot, I tell you. The food, as I said, was very, of very minimal interest.",
        "Q: Was this a hard time, that year?",
        "A: [Shakes head]",
        "Q: It wasn\u2019t?",
        "A: No, I... The hard times was the German occupation, you know. For instance, during\nthe... when the Americans liberated us, we had \u2014 it was \u00b045, the Battle of the Bulge \u2014 one\nof the hardest winters we ever had. We had no heat whatsoever and it didn\u2019t matter. I\nremember when we invited an American for dinner. He was the one who introduced me\nto my husband. He came, he was flabbergasted that we had absolutely nothing. You\nknow, it was a polenta-type of thing. And from then on, he brought us the supplies; he\nwas very generous and fun. But we didn\u2019t suffer. We ate whatever there was to be eaten.",
        "Q: And that...",
        "A: It isn\u2019t that important in life. The freedom was what mattered.",
        "Q: We\u2019re going to take a break and ...\nEnd of Tape #5\nTape #6",
        "Q: So, you\u2019re telling me that after the arrest, that year, until liberation \u2014 not after liberation,\nwhich may have had all sort of difficulties attached to it \u2014 that 1t wasn\u2019t so difficult.",
        "A: After liberation?",
        "Q: No, no, no, no. That...",
        "A: The year...",
        "Q: From \u00b043, when you were arrested and...",
        "A: We felt safe.",
        "Q: You felt safe.",
        "A: After... If you were going to be given in by the concierge, it\u2019s going to take place in two\nweeks.",
        "Q: Mm-hmm.",
        "A: If not, she\u2019s not going to say anything.",
        "Q: Something. Was there any communication with your grandparents in Brittany?",
        "A: Sure.",
        "Q: You were writing?",
        "A: Sure.",
        "Q: So, they knew whether you were okay or you were not okay?",
        "A: They must have, I must have the letters...",
        "Q: Was there censorships of letters? Were the German. ..?",
        "A: Yes, there was, but you... there are ways of going around it. If they were family \u2014 I\nshould have brought you one I have--I found a hil- hilarious one of my brother\u2019s from the\nPyrenees experience in France. It was... they were typed; they were printed by the\nGermans. And I better give them to you because the print 1s disappearing. If it isn\u2019t good\npaper, you know, the printing it becomes very, very white out. But it\u2019s all printed so is\ntu\u00e9, killed. It\u2019s for people like war killed, tu\u00e9, bless\u00e9, fatigu\u00e9, d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9, provision. I mean,\nthe things that really mattered. And you had no right to write anything that had not to do\nwith the immediacies of daily living. I mean, people find a way of... And you, you find a\nway of writing. You should see how microscopic your handwriting can be. And they let\nit, they let it ride. And you can imagine the German spending his day looking at those\ncards going by.",
        "Q: And your grandparents were okay during the whole time, in Brittany, as far as you know.",
        "A: Oh, unfazed.",
        "Q: Unfazed?",
        "A: Unfazed. I mean, they had a property, they were solidly established. They spent, I told\nyou, they spent most of the year in Brittany, most of their older lives. And although it was\nvery uncomfortable, it was a beautiful set-up and they were safe. I don\u2019t think they\nworried.",
        "Q: Now what, what news were getting about the progress of the war and also what the Nazis\nare doing to Jews? Are you now getting more...?",
        "A: Nothing.",
        "Q: Nothing? Nothing!",
        "A: Nothing, I think... I don\u2019t remember.",
        "Q: Are there newspapers? There are newspapers. Did they say anything?",
        "A: The newspapers were censored. [laughs] The correspondence between people may have\nbeen censored but if there was one thing that was censored, it was the newspapers and...\nso you learn practically noth-... In fact, I knew nothing about the American debarkation\nfrom the German-French and French newspaper.",
        "Q: And you\u2019re not getting rumors?",
        "A: I didn\u2019t hear one word of rumor.",
        "Q: It\u2019s funny...",
        "A: We were expecting, expecting, expecting. It was kind of joke. I remember a neph-... a\nnephew of mine \u2014 two, two and a half \u2014 and he was spending the night at Passy with me,\nat the place we were. And he was learning to speak and he was bouncing on the bed. And\nI remember the thing that he was saying, \u201cLes Am\u00e9ricains sont a Paris.\u201d or whatever; he\nwas bouncing on the bed. I mean, there was some knowledge, but it was after the fact;\nthey were already there.",
        "Q: So, didn\u2019t know anyone who had a radio of some kind that could get...?",
        "A: BBC?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: The Jews, their radios were taken. Oh, they, they were very thorough. To have no radio,\nno communication, the, the subway was full of radios. You know why? Because the Jews\nput their radios in the subway, and we put one in the subway.",
        "Q: But how about non-Jews? They had radios.",
        "A: Yeah, I have seen that in the movies, but I don\u2019t remember in France sitting around the\nradio listening, I don\u2019t.",
        "Q: So, you are blank, you have no idea how long this was going to last, how short it\u2019s going\nto last? You can\u2019t tell?",
        "A: It had to end.",
        "Q: It had to end?",
        "A: It had to end; you were getting kind of tongue sticking out and panting. By that time, it\nhad lasted quite a long but...we knew... When was it? I didn\u2019t think that...I remember\none episode. I wrote it... It\u2019s after the American landed. Somebody... saw a truck, an\nAmerican truck, and touched the wheel, the, the, the tire. And the tire was real rubber.\nAnd he communicated to everybody that the Americans were going to win the war\nbecause we were sick in ersatz by now. Nothing was real you know; everything was\nersatz. Those were people with real rubber, they had it made.",
        "Q: [Laughs] That\u2019s funny. You never got depressed?",
        "A: I\u2019m not a depressed type. No, with old age, when I had that massive stroke, that was a\ntime when I was depressed. It was very depressing to find myself completely paralyzed.\nBut then, you bounce back.",
        "Q: So, nothing during the war, even those...",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: You would get sad or you would...?",
        "A: No, depressed 1s not the word, no.",
        "Q: No? What word would you use?",
        "A: At some point, I was overwhelmed.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: I was overwhelmed because, to this day, it is beyond my humane understanding to see\nthat extent of cruelty. That was, that was unbelievable... That a nation could then inflict\nthat on their neighbors... and a nation civilized. I was a student; therefore, the idea that\nthose guys were usually learned people, they were not savages from the depth of the\njungle, they came from universities. And they could live through it.",
        "Q: So what did it...?",
        "A: It\u2019s not individually. As a nation, it overwhelmed me. And that wasn\u2019t depression; that\nwas just amazement. To this day, I don\u2019t... I don\u2019t understand what went on.",
        "Q: Did it in any way at that time, not now, but at that time make you cynical about human\nbeings and about education? Did it make you wonder what was the point of education if\npeople...?",
        "A: Oh, no! That I never wondered, no, because that was also my salvation... You get lost in\na good book \u2014 that\u2019s it, you found your salvation.",
        "Q: But then it seems that education doesn\u2019t protect someone, to be... to remain civilized.",
        "A: No, but I never felt thought philosophically about it; I just acted when needed.",
        "Q: Mm-hmm. And your... well, go ahead, you\u2019re thinking of...",
        "A: Hmm\u2019?",
        "Q: You\u2019re thinking about something. What do you want to say, something?",
        "A: No. I don\u2019t know. My short-time memory is gone.",
        "Q: Did your... I know that said that after your... Go ahead.",
        "A: No, I was having a funny thought. I was thinking one thing that came of the war. I told\nyou how cold people were. It was unbelievable that the walls were dripping wet.\nDripping wet from humidity, you know, no heat in the building for five years and then\nthere were the walls. And... what was I thinking? Oh, you lived in bed. To this day my\nfavorite place is my bed. You absolutely lived in bed because that was the warm place\nyou could control and you could do practically everything. Not talking about even the\nlove part, which we didn\u2019t make, but you could eat, you could read, you could write, you\ncould talk. And when I met John, I received... I received my dates in my bed. They sat\naround, and I remember John, covered with his uniform because the apartment was so\ncold, sitting by my right side and we had conversation. That\u2019s the way I entertained.",
        "Q: So, there was no heat the whole time?",
        "A: Uh-uh. I think there were two week... two weekends... I, I know that before that there\nwere two weekends. That\u2019s almost nothing. In one room, one room.",
        "Q: Then there\u2019s no hot water?",
        "A: No hot water ever. No stockings. That came with the Americans.",
        "Q: So were you always cold even...?",
        "A: Yeah, you, you were always feeling damp and cold, yes. That was the... to me, that was\nthe worst part of the war.",
        "Q: Just a constant physical discomfort.",
        "A: Of the cold.",
        "Q: Of the cold.",
        "A: Not the hunger at all.",
        "Q: I wonder then...",
        "A: It takes, no, it takes nothing to fill you up. You can eat a little bread and you are satisfied.\nAnd I was young and slim.",
        "Q: Did you lose weight during the war?",
        "A: No, I kept my weight.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: No, you... you had a very unhealthy but fattening diet. Bread is fattening. We had bread\nand flour. That we did have \u2014 a sort of polenta.",
        "Q: Hmm. What did you drink mainly, coffee or wine, or both?",
        "A: I told you, there was no coffee. Come on, coffee is an exotic thing. You can\u2019t coffee any\nmore than you can have tobacco. They don\u2019t come from France. France doesn\u2019t cultivate\nthat sort of plant. So, what... We did have wine. There was, I told you, a ration of wine. I\ndidn\u2019t drink any. Water, so I only drank water.",
        "Q: Hmm.",
        "A: There were no soft drinks. Ah, that\u2019s a magnificent thing that they did to us. You kept\nyour figure. There was nothing \u2014 the sugar was out, there was no sugar. There was no,\nwhat\u2019s that, no butter, no fats. No fats. One time a week, I mean, there was nothing to be\nfat \u2014 a lot of vegetables and fruit. It was the perfect slender diet.",
        "Q: But you did have vegetables and fruit?",
        "A: In France, we sure did. And we went to farms to pick them up. You picked up your\ncherries. You had friends who lived in the country and you... I went 50 miles a day on\nmy bicycle to pick up cherries from the tree, to pick up strawberries from the ground. It\nwas a very... They were precious things that you had. But no fat \u2014 no fat on you. Nobody\n\u2014 that\u2019s the thing \u2014 there was, at the end of the war, not one obese person in France. They\nall died. They couldn\u2019t take the diet.",
        "Q: But your mother you said was fat.",
        "A: She lost... she lost it. She was extremely thin by the end the...",
        "Q: She was thin by the end of the war?",
        "A: Sure.",
        "Q: Did she gain it back?",
        "A: Some.",
        "Q: Some.",
        "A: A Jewish mother, she would manage.",
        "Q: So, how did you have the time to bicycle out to the country?",
        "A: Well, there were weekends.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Even if you work, you have weekends. I would do, I would do the whole thing in one\nday. I remember, I would do the 50, 50 miles a day.",
        "Q: But how would you keep the food? There\u2019s no electric, there\u2019s no...",
        "A: The balcony.",
        "Q: I see, outside. And in the summer, then what?",
        "A: You ate it.",
        "Q: You just ate it fast.",
        "A: It isn\u2019t that warm in Paris.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: I remember when we first, when I was first married and we had a maid. We had to\nhave... I had an American husband; we had a magnificent apartment overlooking the\nLuxembourg Gardens. And he absolutely insisted we have an icebox. I had never heard\nof that. So, we had an icebox. She said, \u201cWhat are we going to put in it?\u201d I still\nremember, \u201cMadame Nicole, what are we going to put in the icebox to please Mr. John?\u201d\nSo, we would think, and we would find something to put in the icebox to please the\nAmerican. But she would put... You see, they had those, those things in the windows. To\nthis day, if you go to Paris to an old apartment, in the kitchen, there 1s an opening in the\nwindow in the kitchen and it is sort of a meshed window, and all the food was there.\nThat\u2019s... the refrigeration, and it works for them. For that sort of very moderate weather,\nit works. And then also you have the shops. You shop everyday. It\u2019s a different way of\nlife.",
        "Q: So, when do you get an inkling that the Germans are finished? Only when the Americans\nmarch in?",
        "A: When we saw the rubber tire. The Americans were overwhelming. When you saw them\ncome down the Champs Elys\u00e9es, you know that it could not be resisted. In a, ina\ndifferent way... it was a maelstrom of strength and a fresh strength. By that time, the\nGermans were beaten. They were down to their last troops, to their youngest soldiers.\nThey were demoralized...",
        "Q: And you saw that?",
        "A: And you could see that in the type of soldiers that they would send in the streets.",
        "Q: Now, you said earlier that you tried to stop people who were throwing... were spitting at\nthe soldiers?",
        "A: At... that was at the liberation of Paris. What was the name of the...? There is still that\nhotel. There is the Arch of Triumph and then there is a street... L\u2019 Attala... No, not\nl\u2019Attala; it was another name. There was a huge hotel facing the Champs Elys\u00e9es and the\nArch of Triumph at an angle. And that\u2019s when I saw, all that, and then the Avenue Foche\nand that... They were marching.",
        "Q: Am, am I correct that you also saw women whose heads had been shaved?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And what did you...?",
        "A: And I protected them.",
        "Q: You protected them? From what?",
        "A: Yes, from that. I shamed the people who was doing it because they were wrong. There\nwere the same ones who would sleep with the Americans. They would sleep with, they\nwould sleep with... These were not the, the ugly fighters. They were just easy to catch\nand it was ugly and it was demeaning of the people who did it as well as the people, and\nit was very ugly to watch...very ugly to watch.",
        "Q: But it happened all over...",
        "A: And it... and the people who were doing it probably were the people who had done\nnothing to resist the German occupation. But they hit on... maybe they were worthless\nbut it was nonsensical; it was beside the point. And they marched them the same way that\nthey marched the young soldiers with their hands on their... head.",
        "Q: That they did it in public, it was very humiliating.",
        "A: Again around at the Arch of Triumph, the same route.",
        "Q: So, the time was ugly, the time after was ugly...",
        "A: There were... Yes, I don\u2019t want to give you the impression that the whole life was ugly.\nBut those were very ugly scenes. It seems that people took their worst possible feelings\nand they had a way of expressing those very ugly feelings. And they took an opportunity\nand it hit at the wrong target.",
        "Q: Did anyone threaten you when you tried... when you were protecting these women?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: They were ashamed.",
        "Q: They were?",
        "A: They were ashamed at what they were doing. I saw Arletty, you know, the... the great\nactress who... She had a fabulous word, they shaved her head. She slept with Stilpnagel,\nwas the name of the general in charge of France. And her answer was, \u201cMon ceur est a la\nFrance, mais mon con est internationale.\u201d And I thought that was good. My heart\nbelongs to France, but my cunt is international. [Laughs]",
        "Q: [Laughing] Yeah.",
        "A: That is sort of a woman who... she would have... So, she slept with a general occupying\nthe... She would have slept with an American general if he had been more than that\nrubber tire . She would have been better than many. [Laughing]",
        "Q: [Laughs] So, what is it like, those first few months of liberation?",
        "A: [Sighs]",
        "Q: It\u2019s still not easy.",
        "A: No, but who cares about the physical when you are 21? It was...",
        "Q: Actually, you\u2019re a little older by now.",
        "A: By now \u00b040, 23.",
        "Q: 23, yeah.",
        "A: And I don\u2019t accept the, the, the couvre-feu was still at midnight. They kept, they kept you\nout of the streets at night. The streets were dangerous. But your dates \u2014 my dates always\ntook me home. I remember, my mother was waiting on the balcony, so they all knew that;\nthey stopped at the corner of the street, because my mother was going to pounce on them.\n[Laughs] It was fun. Yeah, I didn\u2019t...We didn\u2019t think in those terms. We didn\u2019t think in\nterms of \u2014 it\u2019s now that we\u2019re thinking in those terrible terms. We just lived with it and\nwere swallowed by it. The same way when I look at the Martin Luther King thing, this is\nhistory at the time. You live through it; we didn\u2019t make such a point of saying, \u201cThis is\nthe march of the...this is the year where we are beginning to end this sort of racial...\u201d\nYou don\u2019t think in those terms.",
        "Q: The war is not finally over, however, when France is liberated, when Paris is liberated.\nThere\u2019s still...there\u2019s still time.",
        "A: Then the Battle of the Bulge comes in. Then we party. What happens... but what was\nvery interesting is that you never stopped the partying. What happened is that it was\neverybody brings, so everybody brought something. And if you didn\u2019t have much, you\ndidn\u2019t have much. You had the party and you had the dancing, you had the music, you\nhad the youth. And then you walked home. It\u2019s walkable, again. You can you go to a\nparty practically \u2014 and also the people, you know, are all in the same milieu, so they\nlive... I can circumscribe Paris. Somebody, oh, Mendes-France is having a boulevard\nnamed after him in the 13\". I don\u2019t even know where is the 13\" in the city. I never set\nfoot in the place. The 4\" arrondissement is where the Marais is; that one there, never\nagain. I know 14\", the 15\", the 16\", the 17\" is wealthy but I never go, the 18\" is\nMontmartre, I never set foot in it, and the 19\" is where the young live now but it\u2019s awful.\nThe 20\" and 21\u00b0, never heard of it.",
        "Q: So you went...",
        "A: And again, the Opera, I mean, it 1s small and you can see that you really, when you think\nof it, you go to Tuileries Garden, it\u2019s the same, very circumscribe arrondissement. I\u2019m not\na specialist in Paris.",
        "Q: Hmm. So, you partied?",
        "A: Sure, everybody partied.",
        "Q: Including people who were more adult than you, older? Your mother? That generation?\nNo, not...?",
        "A: It was, oh no, no, no, no, no, I\u2019m talking about the 20-year-olds. No, because, then you\nhad to go... Then, you had to walk home... You have to walk home, because it\u2019s really\npitch dark. There\u2019s the blackout, and the blackout means that you see nothing in the\nstreet. And you don\u2019t have any electric light or anything.",
        "Q: Now...",
        "A: So, you tripped.",
        "Q: [Laughs] So, you have to be young.",
        "A: Yes, it\u2019s, it\u2019s for, it\u2019s for the young. You don\u2019t find anybody past their 40\u2019s.",
        "Q: Does the organization of your life changed drastically when the Americans come in?\nObviously, you\u2019re... you\u2019re free.",
        "A: Because of my mother, yes.",
        "Q: And what does that mean?",
        "A: That was lifted, she was safe, I mean, we all...",
        "Q: So you didn\u2019t have to worry?",
        "A: No. That\u2019s a huge change.",
        "Q: Right. And is your aunt still with her?",
        "A: Oh, sure!",
        "Q: So they\u2019re all the...",
        "A: You know, lived all through their lives together.",
        "Q: Together. So, now you know you can go out and party and do what you will? You don\u2019t\nhave to worry about anything happening?",
        "A: Well, I could \u2014 I always did go out and party, except now the worry is lifted. But I never\nwas that much of a worrier. My brother was more the worrier than I.",
        "Q: Did he come back to Paris once the Americans came?",
        "A: No, he settled in Normandy. He wanted... I wanted to be a small fish in a big town; he\nliked to be a huge fish 1n a very small town. So he settled in the provinces where I would\nnever set foot.",
        "Q: And where was his, where was his wife and child at the time? Did they go with him?",
        "A: Yeah. They bought a big estate and settled and bought a big mansion and settled private\nhospital.",
        "Q: But where was his wife and child during the war? \u2018Cause he had left and gone across to\nthe Pyrenees, yes?",
        "A: Well, he wasn\u2019t married then. That was \u201940. That was...",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: That was the coming... the moving in of the army. He married in \u201942, \u201943...",
        "Q: But during the war, he married?",
        "A: Oh, yeah.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: And he had children during the war. Since they were playing with us at the liberation.",
        "Q: And so, when was the first time you saw your brother after 1940? \u201944? \u00b045?",
        "A: He came back [laughs]... I remember, when it is over, him coming back. He had had \u2014 I\nsaw it somewhere in an article recently \u2014 he had had one towel for the whole time when\nhe was out, so he used the same towel. It was so dirty, it was stiff! He brought it back!\nThat\u2019s what I remember of his return. But he returned in maybe \u00b042, \u201943.",
        "Q: Really? So before the liberation he returned?",
        "A: Oh, yes, since he was, he was a doctor, so he was safe.",
        "Q: That\u2019s right. That\u2019s \u2018cause he was coming everyday to make sure that...",
        "A: He was again...what do you call that? A horse? A running horse... He was intern, you\nknow. To be intern in medicine is more than to be an extern, or to be just a plain doctor.\nHe was really competitive and very good at, at his job, so he was completely safe. He was\nnamed Michel Denier and he...",
        "Q: Did he have a baptism certificate too?",
        "A: He didn\u2019t, no.",
        "Q: He didn\u2019t?",
        "A: No, but he had been with the, the... He had been a scout and that was with the\nProtestants. And the Protestants, the moment they tried to touch him, they pounced back\nand said, \u201cNot at all, he has been a scout since he was the age of nine, don\u2019t touch him\u201d.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: So, he was protected by the Protestants and I was protected by the Catholics.",
        "Q: And your mother was, who knows? [Laughs]",
        "A: [Laughs] She swam through, probably didn\u2019t know how to swim.",
        "Q: All right, we have to change the tape.\nEnd of Tape #6\nTape #7",
        "Q: How, how did it happen that you started working in Switzerland? What, what... was...?",
        "A: In fact, there were five girls \u2014 because we were all in our... between 20 and 25 \u2014 who\nwere chosen by the French government to thank them for their work in the war, to go to\nSwitzerland, which was paradise and chocolate, to take care of the remnants of people\nfrom the camps. They landed... they couldn\u2019t... they were untrans-... People could not\nbe transported. They were too sick to be sent to their country of origin, were sent to\nSwitzerland, and who had... which had remained nastily... neutral during the war. They\nare still fighting the issue in 2003. But they were \u201cneutral\u201d during the war, but at least\nthey offered the hospitals. They had fantastically modern hospitals, 1n particular in\nDavos, that you see now on the T.V., which is a ski resort, agreed, but it had best\ntubercular hospitals in Europe. And so they accepted... the stretcher cases were sent from\nthe camp to Switzerland. And I was sent to Switzerland to take the... to wait until they\nwere no longer stretcher cases and then transport them back to Paris.",
        "Q: How were you five chosen? Who... This is in... This is in \u201946?",
        "A: That was after the... \u00b045.",
        "Q: This is \u00b045. So who chooses you? I mean, what... who in the government knows that\nyou\u2019re doing this?",
        "A: Oh, I had a boyfriend.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Who was high in government.",
        "Q: Do you want to name him or you don\u2019t want to name him?",
        "A: He was named Jean Iliovissy (ph) and now he\u2019s working at the U.N., probably is dead.",
        "Q: So, he mentioned your name?",
        "A: Well, I had a reputation; I had the papers, I had the figures to prove. But he pushed\ncertainly.",
        "Q: So the... is... you had not met your husband to be yet?",
        "A: No I met him, I met him in December \u00b046. No, December \u201845.",
        "Q: So this is...",
        "A: \"45.",
        "Q: This is\u201945 and you\u2019re in Switzerland for about six months, am I correct?",
        "A: Yes, six months. I was working in Geneva and then Saint Martin (ph) and then Davos.",
        "Q: And what were you supposed to do for these folks, these people?",
        "A: I was what you call a social worker. My job was as vague as the job of a social worker,\nwhich infuriates my daughter, who\u2019s an active lawyer. I was a social worker, so I\u2019d\nwould vi-... visit them, cheer them up...take them out, make them walk, and... visit with\nthem. I was with them when they died and I encouraged them to go out, walk and get\nback into life.",
        "Q: These were not just French... These weren\u2019t French citizens?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: They were all French citizens?",
        "A: At that time, they were all French citizens. They were \u2014 no, excuse me, there were a few\nother nationalities, but almost all of them were French. And some of them had\ntuberculosis and some of them were completely emaciated. I probably fell in love with\none. It was absolutely glorious. Switzerland can be glorious. I didn\u2019t like them. They\nwould, they would say... what did they say? They had such a terrible sentence. \u201cOne of\nyour... one of your deportees...\u201d\u201d Oh, what happened is that they stole. They came back\nfrom the camp and they had been hungry, and they were in the land of plenty and you\nwould put a marvelous table and they stole from each other. And it was almost instinctive\nand they did. And the Swiss, I remember them saying to me, \u201cOne of you deportees has\nstolen again.\u201d And it really hurt me because it was a complete misunderstanding of who\nthey were. They were like animals; they had been hungry for so long that they couldn\u2019t\nresist. You had to have the understanding that the Swiss didn\u2019t. But they had the food.\nAnd the fresh air. So that they got better. And they had very good hospitals, very good\nhospitals, and the hospital care was great. And my job was to be, you know, to come in\nthe room and be fresh and available. And some to them would die and I would call the\nfamily and be there when they died and comfort the family and be present at the funeral.\nThe presence was enormous for them at the time, a friendly presence.",
        "Q: And there were five of you from Paris doing this?",
        "A: Hmm\u2019?",
        "Q: There were five young women doing this?",
        "A: No, they were sent to different...",
        "Q: Ah, they were sent to different places. And you were the one sent to Switzerland?",
        "A: I was the one sent to Switzerland.",
        "Q: And what happened to the boy you had fallen in love with?",
        "A: I... euh...he died very recently. I kept in touch. I became very friendly to his wife. He\nwas a marvelous fellow. He was not a Jewish deportee, he was a political deportee. And\nhe wasn\u2019t from Auschwitz; he was from Mauthausen, which was second worst. Those\nwere death camps.",
        "Q: So, you\u2019re there in \u2019\u00b045. Have you yet seen photographs, newsreels of anything that\nhappened in...?",
        "A: In Switzerland? [Shakes head]",
        "Q: Before you went, nothing? So, the knowledge that you have is from people telling you\nwhat happened?",
        "A: And dealing with them, seeing the way they look and seeing them die. The amplitude of\nit was there because they had suffered it. But I had volunteered to be taking care of\nchildren survivors and that\u2019s because there were no children survivors that I had been\nsent as a sort of compensation to take care of other people who had survived. Then I\nwould accompany the convoy back to France.",
        "Q: You mean, when people would get well, that you would...?",
        "A: When they were feeling well, then I would...",
        "Q: You would take them back.",
        "A: Take them like a nurse.",
        "Q: But you wanted to take care of children, but there were no children...?",
        "A: There were none. I was told there were none, there were not. When you look at history\nthere were not convoys of surviving cases taken care of by the Swiss. There were not.",
        "Q: There were hidden children, but they obviously didn\u2019t come to Switzerland.",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: And why did you stop working in Switzerland? You were there for six... Was it only for\na certain period of time, or everybody from France was okay, or unfortunately had died\nand then you came back\u2019?",
        "A: Yeah, after six months...",
        "Q: Did you then meet you husband or is it then that you were with UNRRA.",
        "A: It was... in December \u00b045 that I met John for... It was at the end of... It was after my\nreturn.",
        "Q: From Switzerland?",
        "A: Mm-hmm.",
        "Q: And you fell in love with him... quickly?",
        "A: Right off, as well. But then the other one was in my life, and they met in the subway. I\nremember, they didn\u2019t like each other at all.",
        "Q: The two men you were involved with.",
        "A: Yes, the deportee...",
        "Q: Uh-huh. I see.",
        "A: They didn\u2019t like it. I still remember the meeting. They met in the subway, they greeted\neach other. But there was no...",
        "Q: But they didn\u2019t like each other.",
        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: And did you like John immediately better then you liked this other guy? Or were you not\nsure?",
        "A: The other guy lasted in my life a long time.",
        "Q: He did?",
        "A: In my life, I mean, not in actuality, but in flirting. Because he had been a real hero and\nthat he had a halo that John didn\u2019t have. John spending one night on the beaches, it was\nenough for him, you know, he absolutely loathes discomfort. I don\u2019t think he was ever\nwithout a real breakfast once in his life. But he still will talk about that night on the sand.\nAnd I told you that he would, he would burn a tree and he\u2019d burn the furniture to be\nwarm. No, he was no great hero. But one reason I married John was that he was a strong\ncharacter. He came from Tulsa and he was a conscientious objector. And in... He had\none of his closest friends, I mentioned to you, that Mauricio Freidman, who was a genius,\na Jew, was also a conscientious objector, but he was for religious reasons and John was\nfor philosophical reasons. And in Tulsa, they said, \u201cPhilosophical reasons, five years of\nhard labor.\u201d So you went to the, the prison where the assassin is, wherever, a prison in\nOklahoma, which is the pits. And he spent one year there. And he got to the library and\nhe started organizing the coming of the books to read. He thought he would cover a lot of\nreading in five years. And then he was pardoned, and in one day, he was shipped\noverseas. So, that\u2019s the way, you know. But then he had, he had done something with his\nlife. And he is quite a character.",
        "Q: How was he shipped if he was a conscientious objector?",
        "A: Because they pardoned him. They first condemned him for hard labor, and then, after a\nyear, or whoever was the President pardoned him, they got him; the same day, he was\nshipped overseas to England and then from England to France.",
        "Q: So, you figured this was strong character.",
        "A: Well he, he was. He was and I told you the way he understood the suffering of my\nmother.",
        "Q: How do you understand. ..?",
        "A: And he would hide, he would hide rations. You know, we had those beautiful curtains,\nsilk curtains. And after John had gone out, we would look and there were those sardine\nboxes, hidden beneath the folds of the country curtains. He was generous and he had a\nfeeling for, for suffering, and he had never seen or done anything himself. Except once,\nwe went wherever it was, we went where they have the most... in San Francisco they\nhave a terrible prison. What was the name of it?",
        "Q: Alcatraz?",
        "A: Alcatraz. We went to Alcatraz. We went with a group of judges and John was a top\nlawyer, and we were there with the judges. And we were in a cell in Alcatraz. And they\nput you in the cell individually and then they lock, to give you the feel of what it means\nto be a prisoner in Alcatraz. And John said to me in passing, \u201cI\u2019m the only one in the\ncrowd who knows what it is to be in a real prison with a locked door.\u201d For he had spent\none year in it.",
        "Q: What, what do you think is, what is it about John that enabled him to understand the\nsuffering that you and your mother went through, or that... what happened? Do you have\nany idea?",
        "A: Do you call that a big heart? I don\u2019t, I don\u2019t know. He\u2019s a liberal at heart. Anything that\nsmacks of... imposing your will on you because of the race or anything... He was born a\nliberal, and his family, too. His... our grandparents and his parents just adored each other.\nThey spoke not a word in common and they babbled away, Catholic grandparents. It was\na joke! Well, my grandmother had been raised with some English, so she could speak a\nfew words. How you can go with people just on feelings without any vocabulary is\namazing, gestures.",
        "Q: So, did you see John for about a month in December?",
        "A: Very little, very little. I was heavily dating elsewhere, and it was absolutely spat at to date\nsomebody in uniform in Paris. We were... We\u2019d go to a theater together; we received\ninsults when we would come down the aisle. Really, insults. Because I was dating a\nsoldier. You just did not date the conquering soldier. It was spat upon by the French.",
        "Q: In spite of the fact that these were soldiers who had...",
        "A: Oh, the French never liked to be... It is not easy to be liberated by somebody that you do\nnot respect intellectually, and also someone so new. To this day I\u2019m getting the articles\nabout how, the same thing, they think we are young and innocent in a bad sense of the\nword. So, they were very... antagonistic. So, when we would go out outside, it was\ncourage to go out with a then-American soldier because you did get passing insults.",
        "Q: So, did you ask him not to wear his uniform? Or he had to wear his uniform all the time?",
        "A: Well, of course, and I... He was liberating us.",
        "Q: Did he propose to you very quickly?",
        "A: He proposed to me very quickly, if you count... He stayed three weeks in France and\nthen they were shipped back to the States. That had been from... He was gone by the\ntime of 27\" of January; he left around middle January. So, if you count the time where I\nam very busy dating, it\u2019s December to the third week of January. And then he said he was\ninterested. And then, again, we hadn\u2019t touched each other; we hadn\u2019t even kissed on the\ncheek. He had sat by my bed and we had discoursed for a long time in the evening, and\nwhat happened and what is what I deeply believe in \u2014 I don\u2019t know that my children do,\nbut, but that\u2019s their lives \u2014 I believe that to marry somebody you have to have the same\npolitical opinions, if not religious opinions. We were both at ease, and both left \u2014 not too\nfar left, but for the poor. Okay? You have two things in common, you have it made. With\nToulet (ph), he was Catholic, practicing Catholic and far right. As we said to each other,\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need to go out for election, we stay home\u201d and we would cancel each other.\nWe cannot marry and make it, and make a 60-year commitment, as I with John, with\nsomebody who destroys your vote when you go to the voting booth. So that counted a lot.\nWe were really very close, so I said, \u201cNo, I am not going to touch, marriage-wise,\nanybody in uniform.\u201d I had seen the French uniform, the English uniform, the German\nuniform, the American uniform. \u201cYou go back home and come back dressed properly.\u201d\nSo, he went back to wherever it was in the States, got demobilized, got into his uniform\nand then he came back. Then he came back and he rang the bell. And my mother, who\nhad cried \u2014 Oh, he sent to me from... He came back by boat; at the time we didn\u2019t have\nthe planes \u2014 So, he sent me a telegram and said, \u201cReserve the 14\"\". Signed, the Huron\u201d\nwhich 1s the critical term that Voltaire has for guys from the Pampa. And he came back...\nOh, do my dates make sense? He left in December, we wrote to each other, he came back\non the 13\" of July and the 13\" in the evening we were then engaged.",
        "Q: You mean in January he came back?",
        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: Oh, he came back months later?",
        "A: He comes... he came back...",
        "Q: Six months later.",
        "A: Six months later it took him time to get...",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Not only out of uniform, to get a job. So, he got a job at the same hotel where they... that\nhad been occupied with the Germans, was then occupied by the Americans and he got a\njob as an assistant to the Brigadier General, whatever, in charge of American things in\nParis. And then he had a job and then the day he was back, we had got engaged. I never\nbelieved in waiting. As I said, there is an element of luck, and also, don\u2019t let it pass by \u2014\ngrab it. So we did. And the 13\" or the 14\" we were engaged. And when we were married,\nthe French did not like at all officially the idea that a French woman would marry an\nAmerican, not done. So they had us wait and the first date we could get was in\nSeptember, so we were married in September \u00b045.",
        "Q: It\u2019s an amazing story.",
        "A: Is it?",
        "Q: Yes, I think so. You hardly know this person! You spent...",
        "A: I knew the essential.",
        "Q: Clearly. That was... you...",
        "A: Okay, you had the physical attraction. I found him handsome... He was making himself\navailable. He was very interested. And we had the same opinion: no God. And the same\ndemocratic of the left political view and what there is to, so jump in.",
        "Q: And he seemed a sweet person...and a generous person.",
        "A: And also, also very kind, yes.",
        "Q: Yes, so your mother liked him?",
        "A: Oh, my mother when he called back, no she was de-...devastated at the idea that he was\nan American. It\u2019s 3,000 or 6,000 miles away, her daughter, her only daughter. She had\nlived with us, you know. We were extremely close. So, when he called, she had opened \u2014\nshe was completely without decency of fear. She had opened the telegram and I had read\nit right around, so obviously she knew he was coming back. But when he called to ask for\nthe appointment, she said, \u201cOh, what a surprise!\u201d\u201d And he laughed because he knew she\nwas laughing... er, she was lying. But she knew I was going to be happy and it was nice,\nit was important for her. She had had such a terrible... Oh, at first she would say, \u201cOh,\u201d\nshe would say, \u201cit\u2019s only one month.\u201d Then she would say, \u201cOh, it\u2019s only three months.\u201d\nThen after that she stopped saying, \u201cIt\u2019s only...\u201d She knew it was going to work out. And\nthen she became very fond of him, yes. And when she died... she wanted him to, I mean,\nlater on in life when she wasn\u2019t feeling well at all, she was as much interested in having\nhim come back to see her as she was in me coming.",
        "Q: That\u2019s nice.",
        "A: Yeah, he was a good \u2014 and he still is \u2014 a good fellow, yeah. It\u2019s not easy to live 60 years\ntogether. Mostly tail years, tail end years.",
        "Q: What is \u2014 what was that, when?",
        "A: The tail end years.",
        "Q: The tail end are difficult.",
        "A: Are not that easy... part of the game. So, it\u2019s a life.",
        "Q: What language did you have between you, French?",
        "A: I never know.",
        "Q: [Laughs]",
        "A: I... Don\u2019t ask me, because sometimes it\u2019s English and sometimes it\u2019s French. He would\nsay that it is more French because it flatters him. But I think it\u2019s mostly English.",
        "Q: Did you, did you speak English?",
        "A: Not a word.",
        "Q: When you met, not a word?",
        "A: No, but I read fluently. With my background... The French background of school,\nschooling was very bizarre. You studied language but not a word of spoken language, all\nliterature. So I knew the grammar. I knew the literature very well. And I remember that I\nexpressed myself with a great difficulty. I practically didn\u2019t speak a word of English. But\nwhen you have the grammar the vocabulary and what else? And it comes. Three months\nin the country and you speak fluently.",
        "Q: But when you met in France...?",
        "A: Then he spoke French.",
        "Q: He spoke... and he was fluent in French, clearly... Sort of.",
        "A: Yeah, I mean he has... as our children say, \u201cBoth our parents have an accent.\u201d I have an\naccent and he has an accent in French. They don\u2019t; they are fluent.",
        "Q: They are fluent. When did you work for UNRRA in Paris?",
        "A: UNRRA? UNRRA 1s after the war.",
        "Q: Right? Is that, was that between the time you meet John and you get married or after?",
        "A: UNRRA sent something to me, I didn\u2019t work for UNRRA.",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t?",
        "A: People in my family did, but I didn\u2019t, not that I remember. Which 1s it\u2019s very... What\ndoes it spell out? United...",
        "Q: That you were visiting survivors in hospitals? Maybe, maybe only, that you only did that\nin Switzerland?",
        "A: Only in Switzerland.",
        "Q: Only in Switzerland?",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes, yes.",
        "Q: So then, in between the time you meet John and he comes back, are you working?\nYou\u2019ve come back from Switzerland...",
        "A: I probably was teaching.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. So you went back to teaching? And when he came and you got married, where\nwere you living?",
        "A: 187 Boulevard St-Michel, above the Ecole des Mines, above the Luxembourg Garden.\nWe were the...",
        "Q: So it\u2019s near where, where your mother was living?",
        "A: No, no, no, no, no. We sometimes lived with her at first, but as soon as we could, we got\nour own apartment.",
        "Q: So where was she living now? The old apartment?",
        "A: My mother?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: During... She was still living in the old apartment. During the time when we lived in\nBoulevard St-Michel she was visiting us for dinner or... but keeping us... I mean, we\nwere very private; we didn\u2019t live with her.",
        "Q: Yeah, but when you were growing up, you were living near Luxembourg...",
        "A: Up \u2018til 12 years of age, then at Vaugirard and that\u2019s where I was caught by the Germans\nwith my mother.",
        "Q: Okay. So how long... You are in Paris with John until 1948? For two years? Three years?",
        "A: Mm-hmm. Yes, and then we came back in \u00b048.",
        "Q: And was it good living in Paris? I mean, your mother must have been very happy that you\nwere there.",
        "A: I guess! We were living in Boulevard St-Michel, we had a maid, I had all my friends.\nYes, it was great. It was difficult to let go...",
        "Q: To leave! Yeah, I would think...",
        "A: Yeah, it was a great sacrifice. Mostly, when you consider my culture, my background,\nthat was huge. But you don\u2019t realize it until afterwards. I don\u2019t think anybody would do it\nnow. Not with my background. I offered for him to stay there and work there and find a\njob, but he didn\u2019t want to.",
        "Q: He didn\u2019t want to?",
        "A: No, he should have, but that\u2019s after the fact.",
        "Q: And wh-...",
        "A: He had no studies finished. I had earned my degree already, I was already teaching. He\nwas just a student studying at University of Chicago. He had... He wanted to enter law\nschool and he wanted to go to Chicago Law School. So, happily, I have enough degrees\nand good records that immediately I kept , SO I went with him.",
        "Q: So you left and...",
        "A: But Chicago, I tell you, when we are in Chicago, he had made a mistake and he drove\nthrough a slum area, and to come from Paris and think you are going to live your life... It\nwas a mistake, but it was still overwhelming.",
        "Q: He... You... so he drove you through it?",
        "A: No, it was a mistake. He took the wrong turn. We lived by the university, which isn\u2019t\nthat...",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: ... glorious.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But at least it was an apartment, you know, a graduate student apartment, which was\ndecent. Although the neighborhood isn\u2019t very great. But it\u2019s mostly nowadays. It was all\nright back then. But those slums--from Chicago, I don\u2019t know if you know them. They\nare, they are worse than Harlem by a long...",
        "Q: We have to change the tape.\nEnd of Tape #7\nTape #8",
        "Q: Okay. Was your mother very upset when you decided that you were going \u2014 both going \u2014\nto leave Paris?",
        "A: Of course, she must have been. But she was enough of a good mother to realize that by\nthat time, we had been deeply married, and we were really kicking, so that was more\nmeaningful for her. Also, his mother came to visit, and although again there was a\ncomplete barrier of language, they liked each other, and she liked how, you know,\nlearned and sedate the mother was. Sort of give her the idea of the stability that she\nabsolutely had not had in her love life.",
        "Q: So you, you ended up having something that she wished she had had, but she never\nwanted to destroy it?",
        "A: Oh, no she would not.",
        "Q: She did not...",
        "A: She would not interfere.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And it\u2019s extraordinary because she was completely... she didn\u2019t know the word of\ndiscretion. You know, when, when we lived together, there was that master bedroom that\nwas the end of a long hall \u2014 they are specialist of long halls. That\u2019s the only places where\nthey put theirs clothes is in the long halls. And then, then the bath, she would barge in\nany time, never thought of it. Don\u2019t forget, she had been without a man for all her life.\nShe did not know what married life meant. Or, either she was nosy, or she was very\nindiscreet. Both of them, true.",
        "Q: So, you come to Chicago and you... John goes to law school. Am I correct? Or he\nfinishes his B.A....",
        "A: Goes to law school and I am accepted for a... with a teaching fellowship for a doctorate\nin Ancient Greek.",
        "Q: Ancient Greek.",
        "A: And we live in a graduate student apartment. Which is not bad. And I learned to cook.",
        "Q: You finally get into a kitchen?",
        "A: I have to. John was in charge \u2014 we shared always, to this day, we do share \u2014 so, at the\ntime, he was 1n charge of the dishes and I was in charge of the cooking. And now, I\u2019m\ntrying to make him in charge of the cooking. \u2018Cause I think it\u2019s, I think it\u2019s more\nconstructive for old age. It\u2019s more stimulating for him. I take over the cleaning up and the\ndishes, which is not much fun.",
        "Q: Was this the first time you were in a kitchen?",
        "A: Where, in Chicago?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Probably. I didn\u2019t make a huge point of it but I have \u2014 I have pictures \u2014 I might send you\none, where it is obviously he in the kitchen and not I.",
        "Q: Did you like being in the kitchen? Did you like cooking?",
        "A: I had a gift.",
        "Q: You had a gift?",
        "A: My mother, grandmother was a good cook, I told you my mother was a good cook and I\nturned out to be a good cook. I, yes, I like it because I like to entertain. So to this day, we\nhave friends and I cook. And all the friends know that I am a good cook, so it\u2019s a pleasure\nto come. Good conversation and good food, so...",
        "Q: It can\u2019t be better.",
        "A: It\u2019s all right.",
        "Q: And why Ancient Greek?",
        "A: It was the field I was the least proficient in. And when I came here I was so proficient in\nFrench and in Latin that it would have been ridiculous for me to... And I am glad\nbecause it\u2019s a one-on-one \u2014 at that level, it\u2019s a one-on-one relationship for the PhD. So, it\nwould have been devastating to have a relationship \u2014 and they were... I didn\u2019t like them\nvery much. And they... the little bit of the relationship I had, they already were very\nresentful that I was so superior. I mean, you think of it, I had had fourteen years of Greek\nby the time I reached Chicago.",
        "Q: Fourteen?",
        "A: Fourteen, because you start in guatorzi\u00e9me, quinzi\u00e9me, seizi\u00e9me, philosophie and then I\nwent through all the competitive...",
        "Q: So, you\u2019re saying that the other students were resentful?",
        "A: Yes, and the teachers also.",
        "Q: The teachers.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t get along at all well. You know, I had to have special \u2014 for a PhD, you have to\nhave, whatever you call it, in each field. You have to have an exam and the French person\ndidn\u2019t like it, didn\u2019t like me, I felt. It was very difficult to teach me. What is he going to\nteach me? I remember, I showed some authors and he... he wasn\u2019t interested in them. I\nwasn\u2019t the run-of-the-mill student that he was expecting. But \u2014 and those were the rough\nyears. The weather was... Talk about yesterday, you know. That plus was the day in and\nday out.",
        "Q: Cold, very cold.",
        "A: Oh, biting cold and we, we had to cross the Midway. And I told you, that\u2019s one thing I\ndon\u2019t like is cold. And you could not escape it without a car in Chicago.",
        "Q: So, Chicago was much colder, even though it was extremely uncomfortable during the\nwar. It was not this cold, or was it?",
        "A: Paris, [laughs] when they say they have a cold wave, it\u2019s a joke. I told you, there is one\ninch of snow and the Luxembourg will close its gates. And they take pictures of all the\nmuseums with the little statue with a crummy little inch on the shoulders of the statue and\nthey have a snowstorm. No, so even in the depth of it, Paris is livable. Chicago was, was\nreally biting cold.",
        "Q: Were there... I\u2019m assuming there were very few women PhD students in 1948, even in\nChicago. You must have been not only a superior student in Ancient Greek, but there\nweren\u2019t, women were not going and getting... a lot of people weren\u2019t going and getting\nPhDs. But certainly not women, so you must have been...?",
        "A: I was, we were isolated. We were very self-sufficient and busy studying and I have\npictures in that student apartment where I with my great dictionaries and John with his\nlaw studies. We were happy and self-sufficient. I, I don\u2019t... I had some...they had some\nwar... He had a G.I. Bill. We lived on that G.I. Bill. And he had some friends in law\nschool who lived in war... it was sort of huts in the middle of Midway. And we thought it\nwas paradise that they had a place. You know, we, we had not really, in the States, a real\napartment of our own. But it never was a problem for me not having much to live on, as\nlong as I had the books and studies and John.",
        "Q: How long did it take you to get a PhD?",
        "A: I never finished it. By that time, I was closing in and starting having to write a thesis\nsince I passed all the exams, and I had to pass one in French, which I remember \u2018cause\nJohn said it was a big joke \u2018cause it took me a long time. He didn\u2019t realize it was a test on\nmy English, not just my French. Dr. Smith took off and I was left in the lurch, and at that\npoint, I said, \u201cLook, who needs it? I have a certificate of proficiency in all the fields...\u201d\neven in German \u2014 that\u2019s when I studied German. And if I had time, that\u2019s what I would\nstudy. I\u2019m fascinated by deepening the German language. I had to study German for the\nPhD in Greek because many of the learned books on Ancient Greeks are in German. So, I\npassed the German proficiency exam; it was a written exam not a spoken one. Oh, I\nremember going to a course and there was a guy teaching the course. And I was\ndistraught at the idea of coming from the war, having to study German, and he began to\nsay something in German to the class and I utterly disliked it. And he sensed it and he\ncalled me after class and he said, \u201cDon\u2019t you feel that way. I am a Jew. So, you don\u2019t\nhave to be so frightened of me.\u201d But I was delighted that I had only to write, to know\nhow to read. And I love the literature. And I love the literature... I have to find those\nbooks. Anybody that can find those books for me is my love. There was a series of books,\nnine in number, which are extremely well done by cognates. You, you have to realize that\n75 percent of all of the languages have common Greek and Latin roots. So, you start with\nthe literature; it\u2019s all written in German. And you read the nine little books and at the end,\nyou are reading German.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: And there is no grammar at all; nine little books and no grammar. You have the same in\nFrench. I think I have the French series. And it\u2019s a very clever way of doing it \u2018cause you\nget yourself into it without noticing it. Then you'll be able to read it. So I read it.",
        "Q: Your professor left University of Chicago and they had no replacement.",
        "A: No, no replacement. She was taking a break, but it was really not a moral thing to do. She\nshouldn\u2019t have in the middle of the year then that...",
        "Q: Right and with only one, one PhD student.",
        "A: [Laughs] Well, that\u2019s probably why she took the pretext that there wasn\u2019t much for her to\nstay. So, I didn\u2019t miss it, you know; I always went by without... All \u2014 It\u2019s called All But\nthe Thesis...",
        "Q: A.B.D.",
        "A: A.B.D., whatever.",
        "Q: And you, did you stay in Chicago or you moved elsewhere? Did you move east or west?",
        "A: I always found a jobs and we moved with my jobs.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: So I wrote and found and we moved wherever I found. And I wrote to the University of\nMaryland and hop! they jumped at me. So I began teaching at Maryland and we came to\nthe area, and that\u2019s the way we started.",
        "Q: And did you love teaching?",
        "A: Not at Maryland. I don\u2019t know if I dare say that. The \u2014 their student body was very poor.\nAnd the faculty wasn\u2019t much higher. Johns Hopkins was \u2014 I taught at Johns Hopkins\nSchool of Advanced Studies \u2014 that was interesting \u2014 on Massachusetts Avenue. American\nU. wasn\u2019t very interesting either; the teachers were better but the students were still very\nmediocre. There isn\u2019t really... It is not really an area of great universities. It\u2019s not very\nstimulating. But, by that time, I was teaching also in the daytime. Those were only\nevening jobs, I told you, because by that time we supported both my mother and aunt in\ntheir retirement. Their retirement from government was very pitiful so we supplemented\nit. And I was teaching during the daytime at Mount Vernon College and I \u2014 The Greek\ndied, the Latin died, the French at that time began to die off. And they said, \u201cWhat are we\ngoing to do with you?\u201d I said, \u201cThere is one thing you don\u2019t have.\u201d It was \u00b063. \u201cIt\u2019s a\nprogram of Continuing Education.\u201d And I opened in the area the first program of\nContinuing Education for \u2014 I called that for women and men. And now the whole college\nis living out of its programs for women. But it, there was no program for women at the\ntime.",
        "Q: Then how did you come to that? That was a very new idea at that time.",
        "A: Because I was going to lose my job. \u201cHow did you come to that?\u201d [Laughs]",
        "Q: [Laughs]",
        "A: That is a very good incentive. I still have the first program. I made it, pasted it by hand.\nAnd I was very imaginative. I started, I had started with non-credit courses and I had the\nmost imaginative program in the city. I had a friend of John, and he was a builder, you\nknow, he had built his own house. So, I had a course. And I had another one, he was very\ngood with tinkering with car, a course in auto-mechanics. I had a course in home repairs\nat the time when, on Foxhall Road, you had, you had people flocking for the home repair.\nAnd people flocking for the car repair course. And I had, you know, the bet-... and I paid\nthem very highly as I had been highly paid in France and they enjoyed it. It became\nhumongously successful.",
        "Q: It was very smart.",
        "A: It was a clever idea and I enjoyed it and they enjoyed it.",
        "Q: And when did you have your children?",
        "A: I placed them. I missed, I missed the summer months in both cases. I was a teacher, so\nthree months, that was perfect. Missed both cases and I hit on Christmas. So, I had two\nChristmas vacations and I had Silvia. My daughter was born on the 21*' of December, and\nI went back to school on the fourth. I never missed a beat. I went to the hospital \u2014 I was\nSO pregnant you could have pushed me I would have rolled down the hill \u2014 and I had her\nwithout pain. I mean, the children were the least problem of my life. And when I had\nOlivier, the first one, 1n Paris, I was in the delivery room and John was outside and he\nheard the baby cry, and he stopped the nurse and said, \u201cThat was, there, there, what\u2019s\nthat?\u201d and she said, \u201cYou must be teasing me. She\u2019s been there for 15 minutes.\u201d He said,\n\u201cWas there, is there another baby there?\u201d She said, \u201cNo, I checked and it was...\u201d Fifteen\nminutes for one and no pain for the other. I had lost the first one. The first one of them all\nwas... lost at birth. It was an abnormal child, and it was devastating. That was \u201947,\ndevastating to have an abnormal child. It couldn\u2019t be... it couldn\u2019t be salvaged. It was a\nspina bifida. And they said now that the war deprivation, finally it got to me. It was a\nlack of certain nutrients in my body, that I could not produce a child with a growth spine.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. Wow!",
        "A: That was difficult, but...",
        "Q: I can imagine.",
        "A: But we didn\u2019t miss a beat after that. I waited because we had study years, and I couldn\u2019t \u2014\nI had to wait for five years \u2014 but then we did it after that.",
        "Q: But 15 minutes for each.",
        "A: Second, for the second.",
        "Q: Still, even so. That\u2019s really...",
        "A: And no pain for Silvia. They would put in my room the other women to, to see what it\nwas like to have a child without... thinking it was anything.",
        "Q: And who took care of the child, your children?",
        "A: I had a maid, a black woman who was devotion... I had checked among my friends. And\nI checked and we once visited a friend. She had a nursemaid, an old maid that took care\nof the children, and when the maid left, the children had a tantrum and wanted to go with\nthe maid. I said, [kisses her finger] \u201cThis is the one for me.\u201d\u2019 Never mind the degree of\nwhatever the... That\u2019s the recommendation and I had that one and she... we lived I don\u2019t\nknow where and at 7:30, I left the children knowing the she would be there.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: And she was there until... I have pictures of her with Silvia. She was there for years, and\nI had my mother-in-law living with us. But she never lifted a finger, so it was Annie Mae\nwho took care of the children.",
        "Q: I have two questions to ask you. You\u2019re born of a Jewish mother and a Catholic father. I\nunderstand that you\u2019re an atheist. Do you have \u2014 if someone asks you what your\nbackground is \u2014 do you say you\u2019re Catholic, do you say you\u2019re Jewish, or do you say\nyou\u2019re nothing?",
        "A: I say nothing.",
        "Q: Nothing?",
        "A: Because it\u2019s truly, it is nothing. I cannot claim anything else. I would lie to say I was\nraised a Catholic because I really... It was built on a false paper that I got when I was 21.\nAnd Jewish, I... If you asked me where is a synagogue in Paris, I have no idea and no\ncuriosity. But if my children had married a Jew, I would have been perfectly satisfied. I\ndon\u2019t even know what they married. They married somebody who claims to be a Catholic\nbut... And the other one married somebody interesting in that his father \u2014 she, she delved\ninto pastor\u2019s sons, she loved pastor\u2019s sons, I don\u2019t know why. She married the son of a\npastor and her mother-in-law, the wife of a pastor, never set foot in the church, not even\nfor the baptism of the children did she set foot in the church.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: But I never ask what she believes or not but her husband is a pastor. A delight, a very\nnice guy. My son 1s divorced, but I remain friendly with his ex, who\u2019s the mother of my\ngrandchildren. Also, I have an extremely bizarre trait, once I have loved somebody, I\ncan\u2019t stop. I mean, you cannot pull the plug and say, \u201cI am going to the next chapter of\nmy life. You drop this one, and I\u2019m going to be in love with...\u201d",
        "Q: So, you have many loves in your life.",
        "A: I have many people that I have loved for a long time and I hold on to them \u2014 not in a\npossessive way, because it\u2019s so far away \u2014 but they are still meaningful. I am not a person\nwith different chapters and close doors. I don\u2019t close doors.",
        "Q: Does that come from your family you think?",
        "A: Hmm\u2019?",
        "Q: Does that come from your family? Is this how your family 1s?",
        "A: No, remember, my mother...",
        "Q: But your mother was forced to close a chapter in certain ways.",
        "A: Yeah, my father\u2019s family... He left... I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s probably genetic, but I have no\nidea where it comes from.",
        "Q: You never met your father. You met the daughter, you met Jeannette.",
        "A: I tried to meet... It\u2019s a big loss in my life. At the end of the war, in \u201947, you had the right\nto ask the Red Cross about anybody around the world, and they would contact that person\nand give you news and I asked about Pierre Denier. I hadn\u2019t heard about him since...\u201940.\nI know in \u00b040, I was 18; when I was 18, he married somebody my age. And he must have\nbeen an interesting character and I wanted to see him. And I was told that he was dead.\nAnd that was a big shock, I remember. And they said he died of lung cancer. And I had\nnever, never even heard talk, anybody talk about the fellow, so I asked my mother,\n\u201cPierre Denier\u201d \u2014 I never called him father, I always called him Pierre Denier if I\nmentioned him to anybody \u2014 \u201cPierre Denier, was he a smoker?\u201d She said, \u201cThree packs a\nday,\u201d but I knew nothing about him.",
        "Q: Did Jeannette help you to get...?",
        "A: Hmm\u2019?",
        "Q: Did his daughter that you met, your sister...",
        "A: You mean Jeannette?",
        "Q: Yes, Jeannette, did she give you some sense of what he was like?",
        "A: It\u2019s interesting. It\u2019s interesting because I was very interested in what he was like. And if\nyou follow... If I follow the schedule, he married \u2014 he had many mistresses and then he\nmarried Jeannette\u2019s mother, who is a delight, loved me, I mean, we wrote the letters and\nit was very funny. And Jeannette said that Pierre Denier died when she was 10 months\nold. And so we had one picture of Pierre Denier with Michelle as a baby on his shoulder,\nbut he was at a casino \u2014 it was because of the game and the women that he was there.\nAnd she made the comment \u2014 you asked the question \u2014 she made the comment, \u201cDo you\nrealize that, out of the three of us, Michelle is the only one who had had her picture with\nher father?\u201d He really is a character.",
        "Q: So, there is a picture of Michelle?",
        "A: But if you go to... if you go to, to Resistencia in Argentina there is a\nmuseum named after him, he became a big scientist. He suddenly blossomed when he\nwas there. And it\u2019s funny because I knew several divorced men who ended up in\nArgentina it was the wild pampa.",
        "Q: For Nazis and for refugees.",
        "A: Maybe that, I mean, many people took refuge in the last frontier, and it is an\nextraordinary and huge country. He felt free, maybe.",
        "Q: Let me ask you one last question. I think it\u2019s the last question. Do, do you think that it...\nthat there are... that there\u2019s some effect of having been through the war and your\nexperiences on you.",
        "A: That there is some effect?",
        "Q: Effect on you from the war, that you, that you can piece together. Did it change you in\nsome way, did it...? Or is it simply this is just part of what you went through?",
        "A: You know what came to my mind? What came to my mind is that it probably enriched\nmy life. To have thrown at you so many experiences that call for a reaction, it gets things\nout of you that probably would remain dormant and unused if not for the catastrophe.\nDoes it make any sense?",
        "Q: Yes, it does. Is there anything you\u2019d like to say that you haven\u2019t mentioned?",
        "A: [Shakes head] No, I think I am talked out.",
        "Q: You think you\u2019re talked out? Well, I can\u2019t thank you enough for...",
        "A: I hope you get something out of it.",
        "Q: I, I did. And I\u2019m sure other people will. And I\u2019m really grateful. You\u2019re a wonderful\nstoryteller and you have a great story to tell.\n[Picture of Nicole as a young woman is shown]",
        "Q: What\u2019s this?",
        "A: This is a picture of Nicole looking out of the window. I was 11 or 12 years old. My hair\nlooks very nice but it\u2019s a fake. I pretended that my hair was naturally curly; it wasn\u2019t. The\nmaid rolled it up with an iron, a curling iron every morning in the kitchen and that\u2019s why\nit is this way.\n[Another picture of Nicole is shown]",
        "Q: And this one?",
        "A: This one I cannot date. I must have been 22 or 23. It\u2019s taken in a studio. But it had to do\nwith, as I said, installing of the phone, and the... it was a marketing ploy that they invited\nyou to have your picture taken in the studio right afterwards.\nEnd of Tape #8\nConclusion of Interview\n"

        "Q: And did it seem, I mean, you\u2019I|l have to pardon me for, for raising a question like this but,\nyour mother is Jewish.",
        "Q: So, you, of course, are born of your mother, even though you have a certificate that says\nyou are baptized; nevertheless, your mother remains a Jewish mother. Is that of no\nsignificance under the circumstances?",
        "Q: Right. So, for you it had no...",
        "Q: Do you ever say to your mother, \u201cLet me try to get you papers; you don\u2019t look Jewish\u2019\u2019?\nNo, she doesn\u2019t ask?",
        "Q: [Quietly] What do you see in your head now?",
        "Q: What, what are you seeing in your head now?",
        "Q: I can see that you see something.",
        "Q: And that really upset you?",
        "Q: But you feel the pain of seeing that line now.",
        "Q: When people were lining up in, after December 41.",
        "Q: And you could have them put on your...",
        "Q: And what... I understand that you were not either feeling Jewish or understanding what it\nmeant to be Jewish, but you saw Jewish people including your mother and your aunt...",
        "Q: ... your grandmother.",
        "Q: So, you see Jewish people wearing stars...",
        "Q: No, but were you angry? Were you upset? Did you think, \u201cWhat are they, why are they\ndoing this to these people?\u201d",
        "Q: No? Was your mother agravat--... angry or fearful because she was wearing a star?",
        "Q: Was she proud of it?",
        "Q: No. This was just what happened?",
        "Q: So, something in her was...proud?",
        "Q: Proud, but of what, you\u2019re not sure.",
        "Q: What do you hear... oh, I think I\u2019m gonna to stop. This is the question I\u2019m going to ask\nyou as we start with, after we change the tape. What did you start hearing about what was\nhappening on the eastern front?",
        "Q: Never?",
        "Q: She would have?",
        "Q: Not.",
        "Q: Okay we have to change the tape now. So, let\u2019s stop the tape?",
        "Q: When your mother lined up, when the, when the Jews were lining up, you remember this\nas 1941, not 1942? And 1s registration... that they were registering the same time they\nwere getting the Jewish star, as far as you remember?",
        "Q: What did you think when he said that?",
        "Q: But when you went... when this man said this...",
        "Q: So, the French are going into the last car not because they care about the Jews, but\nbecause they hate the Germans.",
        "Q: So, it wasn\u2019t to necessarily help the Jews at all.",
        "Q: She laughed at them?",
        "Q: Were you anti-Semitic, do you think, in some way?",
        "Q: I didn\u2019t, I didn\u2019t mean that as disrespectful. I meant that, given what you said about the\nFrench, and you were brought up in France as a secular person.",
        "Q: So, you would not have identified with what this guy was saying?",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "Q: But let\u2019s stick with \u00b041 for a moment.",
        "Q: 41, you... you remain living with your mother during \u00b041?",
        "Q: And your aunt?",
        "Q: And your brother, or he...?",
        "Q: Really, why couldn\u2019t they trace him? Didn\u2019t they...?",
        "Q: But he was in Paris.",
        "Q: And he was studying...",
        "Q: Did you have a phone?",
        "Q: No phone? So if you...",
        "Q: But it must have been somewhat dangerous for your brother to be coming to find out if\nyou were there?",
        "Q: So, you\u2019re both... you\u2019re living at the same... almost side by side with at least two\nemotions. One is you\u2019re worried about what will happen to your mother and your aunt.",
        "Q: But it didn\u2019t take much of your life?",
        "Q: Do you hear rumors?",
        "Q: No rumors...",
        "Q: So she, she lost her job because there are now rules against Jews holding certain kinds of\njobs, right?",
        "Q: In the, in the government?",
        "Q: Yeah. Okay. So then she gets this other job...",
        "Q: And what are you doing besides school? Are you, do you get involved...",
        "Q: You\u2019re dating? You started dating young?",
        "Q: At the Sorbonne?",
        "Q: So did, did you do that first, or at the same time? At...",
        "Q: Two different groups for whom you were working?",
        "Q: But how did it start? I mean, you were going to school...",
        "Q: But he must have known enough to trust you.",
        "Q: And were you at all hesitant when you were approached...",
        "Q: You loved it?",
        "Q: Why?",
        "Q: And how, how would you do that, underneath your skirt? Or in a bag?",
        "Q: In a bag?",
        "Q: And so, where would you get the pistols, in the subway or something? Did someone pass\nyou one?",
        "Q: So, how would you know? You\u2019re told to go to the subway.",
        "Q: So, you would meet this person, usually a boy, a man.",
        "Q: Always a boy.",
        "Q: As if you were kissing, as if you were lovers?",
        "Q: So, these were very passionate moments and very exciting?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: So explain... I see that \u2014 that you remember.",
        "Q: Explain why you were boy and girl together. And who would be carrying...",
        "Q: And who would carry the bag with the arms in 1t? Would you, a girl?",
        "Q: And how long would you be walking?",
        "Q: Do you think...a half hour or an hour or what?",
        "Q: And would he then leave you, or you\u2019d...?",
        "Q: He would take it?",
        "Q: And do it again.",
        "Q: I under-... that this was just fighting the Germans. Do you, do you know the name of the,\nof the group with which you were associated?",
        "Q: No, there was no, no knowledge of them.",
        "Q: If you can, explain this to me again, because I am a little bewildered about something.\nYou go into the subways; you meet somebody who has...",
        "Q: And you don\u2019t want anybody loit-... loitering. It looks suspicious, I suppose.",
        "Q: But here, here\u2019s where my question 1s, \u2018cause I\u2019m not understanding something. When\nyou meet this guy, does he have the gun?",
        "Q: So, you were just...",
        "Q: Oh, you have the gun.",
        "Q: To him?",
        "Q: Uh-huh. Okay. So where then do you get the gun from then?",
        "Q: Somebody has given it...",
        "Q: The guy who\u2019s name was Jacques, you don\u2019t know?",
        "Q: It\u2019s romantic, but lonely.",
        "Q: Did your mother know you were doing this?",
        "Q: So you couldn\u2019t trust her?",
        "Q: Did you tell anybody? Did you have any close friends that you said something to?",
        "Q: I\u2019m assuming you had close friends at this time.",
        "Q: And it\u2019s quite possible that people that you knew, with whom you were friends, were also\ndoing it, but nobody was talking, because you weren\u2019t supposed to.",
        "Q: Why do you say that you were endangering your mother? Since she was Jewish and you\nhad a baptism certificate and you were not suspected of being Jewish. Because of your\nactivities?",
        "Q: So, how did you explain to her why you left?",
        "Q: I know, but why did you, how did you explain to her why you were leaving?",
        "Q: And did you live nearby?",
        "Q: But in a, but in another building?",
        "Q: So, you saw your mother still very often?",
        "Q: Do you think she suspected you were doing something, or she believed you that you were\nbeing independent, to be living...?",
        "Q: And were you working at this time? You had finished school, in \u201941, or not, or were you\nworking?",
        "Q: Was this a government job?",
        "Q: Really?",
        "Q: [Laughs] Children of degenerates?",
        "Q: [Laughing] Did you give, did you give some of your salary to your mother?",
        "Q: She didn\u2019t need it?",
        "Q: So, did you, did you...",
        "Q: You had to spend some of it...",
        "Q: Do you remember about how much it was?",
        "Q: So, you were now rolling in money in a way you hadn\u2019t before? Is that true? I mean, you\nhad...",
        "Q: So, so let\u2019s talk about that a little bit. You have to have coupons to buy clothes and to buy\nfood, to have food. Was there, were there rations?",
        "Q: Or that was later?",
        "Q: Your... your room that you had, was it a room with a bathroom and a kitchen? Or did\nyou have to share with...",
        "Q: Did you have heat?",
        "Q: You don\u2019t?",
        "Q: Well, we\u2019ve come very close to the end of the tape. So, I think we\u2019ll take a break and\nthen...",
        "Q: We are getting...",
        "Q: We\u2019re getting there.",
        "Q: Nicole I, I don\u2019t want us to worry about whether something happened in 1941 or in 1942,\nbecause I\u2019m not sure anybody\u2019s memory can be clear about when things happened. But\ndo you have any recollection of whether, when you were smuggling the guns, that you\nmoved out from your mother, or was it... do you think it was later?",
        "Q: More than what you were doing? \u2018Cause you obviously were doing something.",
        "Q: Then that bothered you.",
        "Q: So, how did it happen that you started to try to save children, once you found out that\nthey were going to take children?",
        "Q: But was... Do you have any idea how, why the Jewish organization knew? Were they in\nsome sense assisting with the Nazis?",
        "Q: But when your mother... Your mother would give you the information...",
        "Q: You think that\u2019s the way it came?",
        "Q: When your mother would give you this information, did she realize that you were going\nto do something? I mean, at that point, is she knowledgeable? \u201cCause she\u2019s just not\ngiving it to you casually.",
        "Q: But you don\u2019t...",
        "Q: So you felt...",
        "Q: [Coughs] I\u2019m sorry. You felt compelled to do something, but you also knew that the\nFrench government would protect you, which didn\u2019t mean that you were totally protected\nbecause the Germans might do something, yes?",
        "Q: There was some danger.",
        "Q: Right. But now you\u2019re doing this in connection with the underground group that you...",
        "Q: So, it\u2019s a different group.",
        "Q: All of it?",
        "Q: So this was a Jewish underground...",
        "Q: ...organization that you were connected with.",
        "Q: The U.G.I.F., yeah, but this particular action was certainly not something that the\nGermans... You were not doing this openly?",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: So your mother \u2014 You recall your mother giving you the names and addresses of people\nyou were going to be taken. And they clearly, they were taking large groups of people at\nonce? Or they were taking a few at a time that they...?",
        "Q: Was anyone else doing it, do you know?",
        "Q: Not that you know of?",
        "Q: So, let\u2019s talk about the process, you get names, and you...",
        "Q: Addresses.",
        "Q: These people did not necessarily expect you. You\u2019re just, you\u2019re just as surprising as the\nGermans knocking. For a different reason, but you\u2019re a surprise to them.",
        "Q: You would tell them that?",
        "Q: Did you usually have one child?",
        "Q: One child at a time.",
        "Q: How long, how long would it...?",
        "Q: No, I mean, when you went to someone\u2019s apartment...",
        "Q: But how long would it take you to convince people usually? You would sit there for an\nhour, two hours or much less?",
        "Q: You don\u2019t have that much time?",
        "Q: You don\u2019t have problems with whom?",
        "Q: Is the husband usually there, or not...?",
        "Q: No men.",
        "Q: So, these women are alone?",
        "Q: So, would it be very often very quickly that the people would say, \u201cOkay, take the\nchild\u2019?",
        "Q: Of who the child was.",
        "Q: Were there mothers who refused to give you their, their children.",
        "Q: All of them \u2014 all of the mothers got...",
        "Q: Did you, by this time, understand sort of what was happening, that these people would be\nkilled?",
        "Q: So you...",
        "Q: Anyway?",
        "Q: So, did you think these Jews were going to be killed in a camp?",
        "Q: You did.",
        "Q: Now, do I understand you that the German was there with you sometimes?",
        "Q: At the same time?",
        "Q: You came at the time that they\u2019re arresting...?",
        "Q: Oh, oh, I see...",
        "Q: No, see, I thought that you came prior to the Germans, that you would try to beat the\ntiming of the Germans. So you\u2019re there just as the German...?",
        "Q: Because the mothers wouldn\u2019t do it?",
        "Q: That\u2019s quite amazing. I didn\u2019t \u2014 I had no idea that it was...",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: So, when they knocked at the door or...",
        "Q: ...banged at the door, were you standing with them? Or did you, after they got in, you\nwent in with...? I mean, how... where were you...?",
        "Q: It\u2019s quite amazing when you think about it, no?",
        "Q: Was there a lot of screaming and crying, with the children...?",
        "Q: But often, the child feels the terror...",
        "Q: But they freeze?",
        "Q: But what happened to you when you, you... On the one hand, you\u2019re going to probably\nsave the child. On the other hand, you know that this child\u2019s mother is going to be killed\nand that the child will never see the mother again.",
        "Q: It didn\u2019t faze you?",
        "Q: Was that because you were saving someone, or just because you...?",
        "Q: You had to what?",
        "Q: Anesthesized.",
        "Q: So, the mother is taken, you have the child...",
        "Q: So you go to the U.G.LF. and they keep the children, the child.",
        "Q: Until you leave?",
        "Q: Paris-Nice?",
        "Q: An overnight train?",
        "Q: Now, were most of the children actually babies or...?",
        "Q: Were all under three? But some of them could talk a little bit?",
        "Q: They talked to you?",
        "Q: Babbled.",
        "Q: And did you try to comfort them?",
        "Q: Yes I...",
        "Q: So, you'd be on the train, did you...?",
        "Q: Did you have... If there were babies, did you have diapers, did you have changing\nclothes?",
        "Q: Did they teach you how to change diapers?",
        "Q: Or did you know?",
        "Q: So, then you would get off at Nice, yes?",
        "Q: Uh-huh. And then what happened?",
        "Q: Now, was this established that the Italians police \u2014 oh, not the Italian police \u2014 the soldiers\nwould take...",
        "Q: They were just there and you just gave it to them? You just gave it...",
        "Q: Now, how did people keep track of which child was, was actually who... you know what\nI mean? ...the identity of the child?",
        "Q: I see. So, that would go with the child and then that would be given...",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: So, as far as you knew, these soldiers would bring these babies...",
        "Q: And you would then stay overnight in Nice? Or go right... Or turn around and...?",
        "Q: How long a trip did it take?",
        "Q: How long a trip did you have?",
        "Q: It\u2019s an overnight, so that if you would come in the morning...",
        "Q: But you think that you were still staying at mother\u2019s house, or you were in the other\nplace?",
        "Q: You were going back...",
        "Q: Did your mother ever become suspicious? Ever say anything to you?",
        "Q: Do you remember approximately how many trips you took?",
        "Q: Five? Ten? No? You have no idea?",
        "Q: Do you have in your head pictures of some of these kids?",
        "Q: Do you have in your head pictures of some of these kids? Do you see yourself on the\ntrain with these babies?",
        "Q: Are you crying about this?",
        "Q: It was pretty scary when the Germans...?",
        "Q: So, one night instead of going to your little studio apartment...",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: Little ones? Almost your age?",
        "Q: So wait, wait, wait a second; they come to your mother\u2019s house...?",
        "Q: Why do they come \u2014 for you do you think? What do they say?",
        "Q: Take you? So do you think that they were...?",
        "Q: ... tracking you...?",
        "Q: In terms of your work?",
        "Q: So they... Well, some Germans knew what you were doing because you were at the door\nwith them.",
        "Q: However, you thought this was okay...",
        "Q: Now, do you think they were coming for you and your mother, or you, and they\nhappened to pick up your mother at the same time?",
        "Q: So all along, it\u2019s your mother who you think is in danger...",
        "Q: She was smart.",
        "Q: We have to stop.",
        "Q: Nicole, I would like to bring you back to when these two guys, the police \u2014 the French\npoliceman and French detective, am I correct? Or are they two French police?",
        "Q: Two French policemen, no detective. When they come in, the bang on the door, were you\n\u2014 are you actually sleeping yet?",
        "Q: You are sleeping.",
        "Q: And...",
        "Q: No, but what do they say? Do they say anything? They\u2019re in the house, but not very long.\nThey just say...",
        "Q: \u201cCome out.\u201d",
        "Q: So, your mother has the presence of mind to take your baptism certificate.",
        "Q: All the time?",
        "Q: So, she has that.",
        "Q: But they know she is Jewish of course because she...",
        "Q: Are you finally frightened at that moment?",
        "Q: No, you\u2019re still not frightened?",
        "Q: Takes you, takes you a while. So, they bring you to Marais?",
        "Q: The Marais?",
        "Q: And do they ask you questions? Is there an interrogation or not?",
        "Q: And at this point, do you know that they\u2019re going to deport you? Do they say anything?\nThey\u2019re going to take you somewhere?",
        "Q: Do you remember what you were wearing? Did they, did they allow you to change your\nclothes from your pajamas or nightshirt or whatever you were wearing?",
        "Q: They watched you get dressed?",
        "Q: And dressed?",
        "Q: And dressed.",
        "Q: Because...",
        "Q: And that, in part \u2014 they may have done it anyway \u2014 but your mother knew that that was\nsomehow... might, might work that they might get attached if they...",
        "Q: No?",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: But they were French.",
        "Q: Did they... anybody say anything?",
        "Q: When your mother was hit on the hand once you were in...",
        "Q: And that\u2019s all they did? They didn\u2019t, they didn\u2019t beat her; they simply didn\u2019t want her\nhand on the table, do you think?",
        "Q: Yeah, and it hurt?",
        "Q: So, you were then put in this room with about 50 other people, mainly women \u2014 or all\nwomen and children, no men.",
        "Q: And is there someone in the room guarding you?",
        "Q: Because the only exit...",
        "Q: Any windows?",
        "Q: So, people are not talking?",
        "Q: But that\u2019s only when they knew that you were leaving?",
        "Q: No, they just did it.",
        "Q: [Background person says something to interviewer] Okay, so we\u2019re now back after that\nlittle interruption. So...",
        "Q: So, people are handing you names of relatives that you can contact because they think, if\nanybody gets out, it\u2019ll be you.",
        "Q: So, all of you go out to the courtyard, the truck comes, that little...",
        "Q: Flips down.",
        "Q: And was it, was it very rough? Was it a very large truck or smaller...?",
        "Q: And were people screaming?",
        "Q: Now are you in the back? One of the last ones so that your mother can find...? I mean\nthese two policemen...",
        "Q: Then they finally said...",
        "Q: \u201cGet the hell out of here\u201d\u2019.",
        "Q: What did they say?",
        "Q: Were there Germans there also?",
        "Q: So, when these two guys said...",
        "Q: \u201cGet the hell out of here.\u201d",
        "Q: Right. Where do, where did... how do you get out?",
        "Q: At that moment...",
        "Q: And you went out the same way that the truck...",
        "Q: No Germans saw you as far as you know? Certain...",
        "Q: And as soon as you get out...",

        "Q: You\u2019re thinking about something. What do you want to say, something?",
        "Q: Did your... I know that said that after your... Go ahead.",
        "Q: So, there was no heat the whole time?",

        "Q: Really?",
        "Q: Hmm. What did you drink mainly, coffee or wine, or both?",
        "Q: Hmm.",
        "Q: But you did have vegetables and fruit?",
        "Q: But your mother you said was fat.",

        "Q: And you saw that?",
        "Q: Now, you said earlier that you tried to stop people who were throwing... were spitting at\nthe soldiers?",

        "Q: 23, yeah.",
        "Q: The war is not finally over, however, when France is liberated, when Paris is liberated.\nThere\u2019s still...there\u2019s still time.",
        "Q: So you went...",
        "Q: Hmm. So, you partied?",
        "Q: Including people who were more adult than you, older? Your mother? That generation?\nNo, not...?",
        "Q: Now...",
        "Q: [Laughs] So, you have to be young.",
        "Q: Does the organization of your life changed drastically when the Americans come in?\nObviously, you\u2019re... you\u2019re free.",
        "Q: And what does that mean?",
        "Q: So you didn\u2019t have to worry?",

        "Q: Did he come back to Paris once the Americans came?",
        "Q: And where was his, where was his wife and child at the time? Did they go with him?",
        "Q: But where was his wife and child during the war? \u2018Cause he had left and gone across to\nthe Pyrenees, yes?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: But during the war, he married?",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",

        "Q: Really? So before the liberation he returned?",
        "Q: That\u2019s right. That\u2019s \u2018cause he was coming everyday to make sure that...",

        "Q: So this is...",
        "Q: This is\u201945 and you\u2019re in Switzerland for about six months, am I correct?",

        "Q: These were not just French... These weren\u2019t French citizens?",
        "Q: They were all French citizens?",
        "Q: And there were five of you from Paris doing this?",
        "Q: There were five young women doing this?",
        "Q: Ah, they were sent to different places. And you were the one sent to Switzerland?",
        "Q: And what happened to the boy you had fallen in love with?",
        "Q: So, you\u2019re there in \u2019\u00b045. Have you yet seen photographs, newsreels of anything that\nhappened in...?",
        "Q: Before you went, nothing? So, the knowledge that you have is from people telling you\nwhat happened?",

        "Q: You would take them back.",
        "Q: But you wanted to take care of children, but there were no children...?",
        "Q: There were hidden children, but they obviously didn\u2019t come to Switzerland.",
        "Q: And why did you stop working in Switzerland? You were there for six... Was it only for\na certain period of time, or everybody from France was okay, or unfortunately had died\nand then you came back\u2019?",
        "Q: Did you then meet you husband or is it then that you were with UNRRA.",
        "Q: From Switzerland?",

        "Q: What, what do you think is, what is it about John that enabled him to understand the\nsuffering that you and your mother went through, or that... what happened? Do you have\nany idea?",
        "Q: So, did you see John for about a month in December?",
        "Q: In spite of the fact that these were soldiers who had...",
        "Q: So, did you ask him not to wear his uniform? Or he had to wear his uniform all the time?",

        "Q: Oh, he came back months later?",
        "Q: Six months later.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: It\u2019s an amazing story.",
        "Q: Yes, I think so. You hardly know this person! You spent...",

        "Q: Cold, very cold.",
        "Q: So, Chicago was much colder, even though it was extremely uncomfortable during the\nwar. It was not this cold, or was it?",
        "Q: Were there... I\u2019m assuming there were very few women PhD students in 1948, even in\nChicago. You must have been not only a superior student in Ancient Greek, but there\nweren\u2019t, women were not going and getting... a lot of people weren\u2019t going and getting\nPhDs. But certainly not women, so you must have been...?",

        "A: Or cover it up because it was made with spikes. And it cut through the card and you\ncould not hide it. They thought of so many ugly things.",
        "A: January 27, yesterday, 1921.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Thank you. Happy 82\" birthday.",
        "A: I have two sides of my family. My mother\u2019s side was the Jewish side. It was a well-\nknown Jewish family from Avignon. The Jewish popes, popes...\u201d No, the Jewish \u2014 yeah,\nin the 11\" century, the Jews from Portugal and Spain came to be protected by the Jewish\nPope at Avignon. And all my family comes from that region. And they are well-known;\nit\u2019s Cr\u00e9mieux \u2014 C-R-E-M-I-E-U-X, so that there is a village named Cr\u00e9mieux in\nAvignon, and so...",
        "A: Because, at the time, the Pope in Avignon protected the Jews. And they came to live in\nAvignon. And that means that when the Germans asked about the Jews, you had to prove\nthat you were a French Jew. And the French Jew had to have five generations. And five\ngenerations, you have to go way back to cover five generations, but it was easy for my\nmother because she was a Pope Jew.",
        "A: My mother\u2019s name was Marcelle and then she took my father\u2019s name. Cr\u00e9mieux was the\noriginal name of the family. And she became Denier when she married Pierre Denier.",
        "A: Marcelle.",
        "A: M-A-R...",
        "A: Maiden name?",
        "A: Was Monina. M-O-N-I-N-A.",
        "A: My father was a Catholic. They met during the First World War. She was a \u2014 you know \u2014\nbourgeois nurse. And they fell in love and married. And he was an interesting fellow. He\nwasn\u2019t born to be a father. He deserted when I was three months. And my fa-... my\nbrother was only, was only 12 months older, so he was 14 or 15 months. He took off and\nwent to Argentina. And became a great scientist. He has a museum named in his honor in\nArgentina. But he was a real skunk.",
        "A: Never! Never wrote a letter, never sent a penny. But his parents took over. Those are my\nCatholic grandparents. And they were very influential in my life, intellectually.",
        "A: And no money.",
        "A: So, she comes from a powerful family with a lot of money.",
        "A: That cousin who married Mendes-France is from those other people with castles and\nwhat would be now millions. And they supplied her with money.",
        "A: She did work.",
        "A: She did work. And she lived with her sister. Her sister lived with us, if you want, and her\nmother lived with us. So we had a warm family. And it was in a neighborhood near the\nLuxembourg, which up to this day I like very much. Which my daughter, when she\nvisited it, thought was ridiculously poor. But she didn\u2019t realize that at the time I thought it\nwas a little jewel. My mother had great taste and it was a small apartment but extremely\nsunny and opposite the elementary school where I went. And I had a cozy family...",
        "A: Most. And the interesting thing about the Catholic grandparents is that my grandfather\nnever allowed the name of his son pronounced in front of him the moment he left us,\nnever. He... the mother was more tender-hearted and kept in touch. But he never would\nlike to see the letters; he was not interested in ever hearing from that man.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think... It\u2019s interesting, when \u2014 much later, when I went into her papers, when she\ndied and I went to settle things, I found love letters of Pierre Denier that she had still\nkept. I don\u2019t think his name was ever mentioned in the house of his parents because they\nfelt so shameful, but they certainly took over. They had a house in Brittany, and they\nspent three months of the year. The whole summer they spent in Brittany with the\ngrandparents.",
        "A: Oh!",
        "A: Oh, very much and intellectually. He \u2014 my grandfather was for his job but extremely\nintellectual. He made his money by making up, what you would call, the New York Times\ncrossword puzzle. And then once a year, he would go \u2014 he never went out; they were\nvery sedentary. But once a year he would get dressed, go out and compete, there was a\ncompetition and that made the money for the rest of the year.",
        "A: So his money was made really from crossword puzzles. Either winning the competition \u2014\nthat was a yearly thing \u2014 or making them up in the name of the guy who signed for them,\nfor something that would be Le Monde, that was a great newspaper of the day. And that\nmeant that he was encyclop\u00e9dique. When he died, there was a fight over who would get\nhis dictionary, because the dictionaries were annotated and it counted a lot. He trained us,\nhe teached us in Latin, in French. He had groups of our little friends come every... once a\nweek to study with him and he was great. I mean, they were just great. And it was very,\nvery modest life. They did not have any hot water. They did not have any running water\nexcept in one faucet in the whole house. So you can read those breaux (ph) that you see\nnow, people collect them. But for us it was a necessity of life. You had to heat your water\nand then have them pour it and then you had those big bowls and you wash like that.",
        "A: And the other family.",
        "A: Extraordinary. But from the other side, we got some financial help, but we saw them for\nthe first of January or something, but not...",
        "A: Oh no, it was not at all. Because the caste system is such in France that you live in a\ndifferent part of the city, you never, never...",
        "A: Well, you have the working class; we had nothing to do with that. We were bourgeois\npoor, but we had a maid. We always had a maid. It was done that way. And she had what\nis now the students\u2019 quarters in the building where we used to live, because they had the,\nhad the view. It was on the sixth floor. All that floor was maids. And now it\u2019s all students\nand they all fight...",
        "A: ...to have the view because it\u2019s over the roofs.",
        "A: Yes. And you were not aware of it; it\u2019s built in you. You talk differently. I married a man\nwho 1s that way and I mean, he spends his time watching T.V. and they say \u201cwho\u201d when\nthey should say \u201cwhom\u201d, and he says \u201cwhom\u201d aloud. I can hear him from my room\nbecause he is incensed. It\u2019s built in you, that you speak well, but you wear their discard as\nclothes \u2014 except for shoes; the rich never give their shoes. You can\u2019t wear other people\u2019s\nshoes.",
        "A: All the rest was discards, all the time. And I remember the time when I begin to wear my\nown clothes and it was a sensation and that was \u2014 I was in my twenties.",
        "A: The poor ones.",
        "A: But all their money was put in buying land in Brittany. Now, we go back, it\u2019s like having\na mansion to us, an acre of land on the sea...",
        "A: ...1n Brittany. Because the mansion Constanty (ph) was near B\u00e9ly (ph). It\u2019s mentioned\nconstantly on the news because of tt.",
        "A: Oh, yes.",
        "A: No, you didn\u2019t in those days, a woman did not. And she didn\u2019t take lovers either. She\nreally... it destroyed her.",
        "A: I think it was a passion \u2014 it makes me feel choked.",
        "A: It\u2019s interesting because when I got involved with an American, and another one of those\nlove-at-first-sight and fast-move type. It ran in the blood. She was devastated in a way;\non the other hand, she saw that I was going to be happy. And she let me go and never\nregretted it, and I wrote every week and never missed a week. And he wrote, too, so they\nhad two views of our lives. When we were at the University of Chicago, we would write.\nAnd they also wrote \u2014 both of them \u2014 and I still have their letters, wrote every week. So,\nthere is a way to keep in touch. We didn\u2019t have phones and so...",
        "A: Oh, I have the letters of my grandmother.",
        "A: We didn\u2019t write, but she wrote.",
        "A: She died when I was 30. You see, they got married much earlier and so they had children\nearly. So, I was lucky to have her \u2018til I was 30. And I remember in Chicago when they\ntold me very carefully...",
        "A: She was a roly-poly.",
        "A: She was... We called them the \u201cfatties\u201d, my mother and aunt. We were not respectful. We\nwere loving, but not respectful. Ce sont les petites grosses \u2014 \u201cthe little fatties\u201d\u2019.",
        "A: Oh, sure.",
        "A: I called her mamoun, also. People call me mamoun now, too, but they were the two \u201clittle\nfatties\u201d. They were fat, small, but she didn\u2019t look Jewish at all. I had my nose, I was the\nJewish one looking, but I had perfect papers. It was a queer mixture.",
        "A: No, because neither of the grandparents \u2014 although grandmother had been raised in a\nconvent and him by monks \u2014 they were not believers. So, I had a perfectly non-religious\nchildhood. When I was \u2014 when the German occupation came, the Jewish issue came to\nthe fore. The day the Americans started their war, seventh of December, 1941. Then the\nGermans began to force the French Jews, the Jews in France, let\u2019s say, to wear the star,\nthe yellow star. And the people lined up, but I didn\u2019t know my mother was Jewish until\nthen. It was never mentioned; we never went to the temple or to the church. It was\ncompletely /aic...",
        "A: Oh yes, I knew that there was some Jewish background, but it meant nothing.",
        "A: There was nothing culturally. I had never seen a word of Hebrew until I was in my 50s\npractically. And it meant nothing to her. And it was strictly separation of church and\nstate, so it was never mentioned. In school, I never heard anything, any mention of even\nCatholicism, although 90 percent of them Catholic.",
        "A: Well, Christmas.",
        "A: As a non-religious holiday.",
        "A: Is there, is \u2014 there was a chocolate.",
        "A: Chocolate eggs.",
        "A: That\u2019s all.",
        "A: Never attended either. Never set foot in a synagogue.",
        "A: And then the Germans came.",
        "A: [Sighs] You have to go back, way back. That would be 19\" century. She was from\nMarseilles, from Avignon. She was so prosperous that the apartment house where she\nlived in is still there, standing up at an apartment house; that means something. It\u2019s a\nbeautiful, stone, powerful apartment house. She never \u2014 she was sad, she was destroyed.",
        "A: She was destroyed for some reason. I never saw my mother but somewhat sad. My aunt\nwas the joy of our childhood.",
        "A: Yes, she was playful. But I had a brother; I had a brother who was only 11 months older.\nWe played and played and played. And we were happy. We managed to \u2014 they were\nextremely loving. I found my mother, her sadness was kind of frightening, but she was so\nloving that we didn\u2019t...",

        "A: It was his son or whatever. So, she married well, and he... for... and he left suddenly and\ndisappeared from, from all of our lives.",
        "A: Another one. So, it was really a family of divorce.",
        "A: It isn\u2019t built in the genes.",
        "A: We lived in twin beds, in the same room. We played together. He resented me when I\nbegan to be 10 or 11. Because, that was maybe genetic, I was my size at 10. I grew up\nfaster and there was one or two years there that he was smaller and he deeply resented\nthat. But then later we became friends again.",
        "A: When... when I began to be an excellent student and go to those highly competitive oral\nexams that the French torture the young with, he came to see me perform, bringing his\nbest friend who 1s still one of our closest friends \u2014 he lives in France. And so that showed\nme that he loved me in a clumsy way, but he did. And then, he and my husband got along\nvery well and we remained friends through the rest of his life and he wrote regularly, also\n\u2014 we corresponded. And when he died you, you could see that, you would say that we\nwere the closest thing. When he came to Cleveland to have his arteries bypassed, he\nasked me to come with him. Which was quite a thing to ask because, by that time, I was\nteaching college. I had to take the 11 days that it took him to stay in Cleveland. And I\nwas friendly with his \u2014 to, to this day I am friendly with his kids. Now adults, they come\nand visit us and stay with us at the beach. We rent the biggest possible house and all the\nnephews from France come. I\u2019m very family-inclined. I think it\u2019s part of the happiness of\nlife.",
        "A: Yes, yes and money had nothing to do with it. Which is a pleasure.",
        "A: I adored school and I was recognized, and they had things \u2014 they had prize at the time,\nyou know the prix d\u2019excellence, prize of excellence, and I made a point of getting. But\nwhat I was more pleased with is that they had the prix de bonne camaraderie. The good\nchum of the year and I always got that one.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: I was \u2014 and I am \u2014 a good chum and I still have friends from childhood. We write\nregularly and, and their children are close friend. I have a letter, I got a letter yesterday\nfrom the daughter of my closest friend. She\u2019s extremely close to us.",
        "A: Yes, although we had no money, so we did not go to... I went once in my life to a\nrestaurant, in my life, in my childhood, when I was 12. I remember it and it was a\ncafeteria. But to this day, I remember it as a day of extraordinary thing. We \u2014 things that\nare normal for Americans now were not in existence. It didn\u2019t matter. I don\u2019t think my\nfriends went to restaurants, either.",
        "A: We had a maid.",

        "A: ...was a good cook, yeah. My mother was a good cook and I am a good cook. But I\u2014 Jew\n\u2014 that may be genetic, or it may be whatever, it could be taste.",
        "A: No, no, no, no, no, I\u2019m talking about the one who lived with us.",
        "A: Oh she did. Maybe the others did. I just didn\u2019t.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Uh-uh.",
        "A: It didn\u2019t matter too much.",

        "A: I probably did. No, I wasn\u2019t very... I had an uncle, my brother... my husband had an\nuncle who was a painter. So, I am in some of his paintings and I was in some museum.\nAnd he gave us some paintings. And some paintings of his are still in Paris museums.",
        "A: No, I mean my father\u2019s brother...",
        "A: Yes. And he was a stay-at-home. My grandmother had two children, one who stayed at\nhome and never left the house practically, and the other one who took to... went to, to\nArgentina. And they were also only 18 months apart. Like night and day.",
        "A: Ah, that is an interesting thing. When I was 60...",
        "A: When I was 60, my son in town called me one day and said, \u201cI have Jeannette\u201d \u2014 my\ngrandmother was named Jeanne, remember? \u2014 \u201cI have Jeannette on the phone.\u201d And I\nsaid, \u201cAnd who on earth is Jeannette?\u201d At that point I was in \u2014 directing Continuing\nEducation for the women in the college. And I was at my desk, surrounded by secretaries\nand \u201cWho on earth is Jeannette?\u201d And he said, \u201cYour sister.\u201d I didn\u2019t know I had a sister.\nAnd so he put Jeannette on the phone and Jeannette was in town. She was researching her\nfamily. And to this day, we are very close. We went to Argentina; she had the six\nchildren that I would have loved to have. And when we met that evening, when she came\nto Washington to see us, we went to a restaurant and the children said, \u201cThat we have to\nsee, the two sisters.\u201d I was 60, she was 40. We were the same person. We laugh at the\nsame thing, we adore each other. If she lived next door, I would talk about my sister as\nthe lady in the house here talks about her sister.",
        "A: Well, six times.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Moved around a lot. I recently got, got something, yeah. I mean, he was really a woman\nchaser. Great charm, great gifts. But my sister is quite a thing. Yes, I have that half-sister.\nI never see her because... but we sent her money at the time when Argentina was in\ntrouble. She\u2019s delightful, married, six beautiful children.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: My grandmother, the one we lived with, loved movies, and at the time you paid\naccording to the quality of the seats. So we were poor, so were always sitting in front. But\nevery Thursday afternoon, she took us to the movies.",
        "A: You have American movies in the 30s in Paris?",
        "A: No, no, they were... maybe on the Champs Elys\u00e9es, but not in my neighborhood. But I\nsaw the old French movies and some them are excellent. And it was completely... There\nwere no rules of age, you know. I must have seen extraordinary, risky things and I\nnever... To the innocent, everything is innocent.",
        "A: Yes, that was the...",
        "A: And every Sunday, we went to the Catholic grandparents\u2019 and we had a big dinner. It was\na feast, and they played with us. One funny thing my grandfather had is that he played at\nour level. So he played checkers, chess. We played games. There was a game where you\nthrow dice, whatever.",
        "A: All, all afternoon we played games. And they were surrounded by great books. They had\nfirst edition, all the Oscar Wilde in first edition. They were collecting first editions. I\nmean, they were not collecting, but they bought the books. So, it was a very, very\nbookish, intellectual household, completely full.",

And we were for the worker movement, whatever it\nwas, not communist but let\u2019s say center-left. And we were somewhat left, more left, I\nmean, don\u2019t forget that there were newspapers in that household all the time. So, we\nfollowed the political life very much so. And then it continued and still to this day, \u2019'm\nvery conscious of political things and...",
        "A: I was...twelve.",
        "A: Twelve. The French were blissfully wanting to be unaware. Remember, there was a\nmovement to try to appease, to do as if nothing was happening. So, we went to send\npeople visiting and they came back saying, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, don\u2019t worry, it won\u2019t happen.\u201d\nAnd we felt insulated, and when it came, it came only because the Americans entered the\nwar. The Germans invaded France and France completely capitulated and it was\nshameful and I was very aware of that. But, as I mention in passing, the French protected\ntheir thoroughbreds, and so they sent to unoccupied France. And I had a scholarship that\npaid not only my mother for, for my upkeep, it paid for books for me. So, whenever I\nwanted to buy books, the government would pay. And during the war they kept feeding\nus money, because of my continuing to be such a good student.",
        "A: Unaware.",
        "A: Unaware.",

        "A: No, no, no.",
        "A: No, happy in high school and working very hard. Okay, yes, I began to be aware of them\nin \u00b040 when France fell.",
        "A: \u00b039, I was, again, I had, I had my vacation paid by the government in a youth hostel in\nVerdun. And I visited the German battlefields and the German cemeteries. And I made a\nGerman friend.",
        "A: Yes, and he remained a friend until he died, and...",
        "A: Yes, and he is a German...delight. And that, I think, helped me through life, not ever\ngeneralizing about Germans because I knew that Hans Mattern existed in Kaiserslautern\nand if maybe there was one, there was more than one.",
        "A: Hans Mattern. M-A-T-T-E-R-N.",
        "A: And he was a concert pianist and I still have his letters at home. And we corresponded,\nand he came! When Germans invaded and my mother started having to wear the star,\nHans announced that as a German he was playing for them in the army. He came to visit\nand he came to visit Jews, a German in uniform coming to visit Jews! And he did, he\nnever changed.",
        "A: Paris. And we were very worried because my mother and aunt were government\nemployees and we were worried for them, but...",
        "A: They were working for the government.",
        "A: No, more than that, but they were not very high level. You know, at that time, women in\nthat milieu didn\u2019t study very hard. So, I don\u2019t think that their jobs were very important at\nall.",
        "A: We didn\u2019t give it a thought.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: And my brother turned 20 in 1940. He was born in \u201920. And he was a medical student\nalready, extremely good student himself. We were both on heavy, heavy scholarships.\nOur parents received money every month because we were such good students. And if we\nhad not kept our grade up...",
        "A: We would have lost the scholarship. Which means that my mother would have practically\nlost her way of life. So, we were always studying hard. And he left Paris walking and he\nwalked to, to the Pyrenees. At some point, the Germans were before him \u2014 he met a\nGerman on a bridge, stopped him and had pity on him because he was 20 years and was\nwearing a brand new uniform. And he said, \u201cHurry up, or else Pll make you a prisoner.\u201d\nAnd then he went all the way to the Pyrenees and he stayed in the provinces during the\nrest of the war years. He never came back Paris during the war years.",
        "A: No, in \u201940, they did occupy France.",
        "A: 40, French, French lost in, in 1940, the spring. The Germans just ran over them.",
        "A: I was studying so hard, you know. Those were the studies I don\u2019t even \u2014 I have good\nstudents among my grandchildren, I don\u2019t see the same intensity of the... competitive\nstudy. I was in my books up to here, and that was, I was specializing in Ancient Greek, so\nI was and that was when the Germans invaded France.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Way above level. Let\u2019s say that at the time, definitely the graduating class would be\njunior college level here. I have checked it since, since I was teaching college all through\nmy adult life here. And so we were really advanced and so during the war years, and we\ntalk 21 \u2014 when I was 21, I was studying for what you would call a master\u2019s. But I was\nstudying independently, although I had been \u2014 but fate was very tied with my grades.\nBecause I had been accepted at Ecole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure, which would be like the\nRadcliffe, the chaplain was sensitive to the fact that the Germans were working against\nthe Jews, and gave me the baptism certificate that saved both my life and the life of my\nmother. So, from then on, I had a baptism certificate but I was never baptized.",
        "A: Way, way back? Sure, it was a perfect piece given by \u2014 practically given by a chaplain. It\nwas not made by him because it would have been suspicious. He wrote to somebody in\nthe Loire Valley, in a little village that guaranteed that at age 3, I had been 3 months, I\nhad been baptized in that village. It was new in the church, it was very complex. And I\nhad my baptism certificate, which was the life of the whole family in the future.",
        "A: The chaplain...",
        "A: Yes. That it was, it was going to be needed.",
        "A: No, I felt blissfully out of it. Maybe because my roly-polies were optimist and I definitely\nwas an optimist \u2014 it pays in my life to have been an optimist, to this day.",
        "A: It was a real salary.",
        "A: It was a real salary that you could live on.",
        "A: Yes, I mean they really, to this day, pushed for the people that they wanted to save. And\nthere were laws that they created to protect people like me \u2014 were created with Petain,\nyou see, Petain and Laval, was where those people protected their people. They, they\nsacrificed in a disheartening way. At that point, I began to be disheartened about it. But\nthat would be \u00b041, \u201942. The Petain Law \u2014 Petain took the second half of France, you\nremember Vichy and collaborators. And the Vichy laws are the laws under which I came,\nprotected people like myself. As against the Poles, that were refugees, the Polish, the\nHungarian, the names that you see in the book you can notice, for years, there is not one\nFrench name.",
        "A: It was... yes, but she was... and the Germans didn\u2019t appreciate it, she was a devoted\ngovernment employee. She stayed at her job.",
        "A: No, she didn\u2019t\u2014and also she was an optimist I don\u2019t think she saw, that, that was... In\nfact, to the very end, she was having, ready for the deportation, a little bag, a small black\nbag with a chamber pot in it. She thought it was going to be a working camp. And that...\nshe may have problem going to the toilet but that would be all and that she would\nsurvive; otherwise, she would not. When they came to pick us up, she still had that.",
        "A: Ah, the children were different.",
        "A: Yes, as a, she was a very, very worried mother. And that train was full of children and\nwomen. There wasn\u2019t one single man on that train that went to southern France. That was\nin \u00b039, right?",
        "A: Or \u00b040.",
        "A: Yes, right, right, yes.",
        "A: No, no, no I was not thinking of the Jewish issue at all.",
        "A: No, the Jewish issue did not come up until...\u201940?",
        "A: Until \u00b040 December \u201941. Then you had to register as Jews.",
        "A: To protect, to protect me. I don\u2019t know what against.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: From the possibility of the bomb or whatever happened.",
        "A: Yeah, and I learn that eleven, that\u2019s the longest line. Nobody has lined up that long.\nEleven hours to come back!",
        "A: Yeah, right.",
        "A: I was at the house of a friend.",
        "A: Yeah, in Limoges.",
        "A: Central France, God forsaken city, and I stayed there for a month or two and then lined\nup for eleven hours in order to get a ticket back to Paris.",
        "A: Because my mother was there.",
        "A: I forgot...",
        "A: I remember the line up, I remember the train.",
        "A: I remember the first German soldier. My aunt was the funny roly-poly, so saw the first\nGerman soldier. And she came back to the house to say \u2014 somebody saw a German\nsoldier and said, \u201cI have seen a German soldier.\u201d And my aunt said, \u201cIt must be English,\nit must be British.\u201d She never understood the war; she never understood what was going\non. But it was a blessing. I remember the first one I saw. And they said... You know\nwhat they did? They sent smashingly good-looking soldiers for the first wave. Boy, were\nthey handsome, and they behaved perfectly. The French, you know, touched you, the\nAmericans played around. The Germans never touched a woman. They were\nimpeccable...bastards. Impeccable. Never, never. They would have been killed if they\nhad done anything wrong in their behavior. Perfectly handsome, awful bastards.",
        "A: Oh, no, no, no. It was in Paris.",
        "A: It was a pleasure to see my mother again.",
        "A: You know, the occupation, I took... You took... When... There was a funny rule: you\ndidn\u2019t look at them. What arms do you have when you have no arms, while you are good-\nlooking, 21-year-old, and you never, never looked at the German in the face. That\u2019s the\nway. You look at their belly button where they have the sign saying \u201cGod Meet Us\u201d (ph).\nThat\u2019s what you look at. You never laugh, you never... but you never even look at them.\nThey do not exist. So, that was the game. I mean there were many games that were\nplayed like that. I never looked one in the eye, I saw, I saw they were there.",
        "A: Of resistance.",
        "A: It must have been... disheartening. There were many things that must have disheartening.\nYou can dishearten somebody just by being very passive, \u201cYou don\u2019t exist, I see through\nyou.\u201d",
        "A: I was not.",
        "A: No. We believed... they never, never were brutal or friendly or anything. Don\u2019t forget,\nthat was their rules. Impeccable.",
        "A: Paris.",
        "A: And, as a typical French... Except for Paris, there is no French.",
        "A: Yes, to this day, I still feel that way. There is a culture \u2014 You asked me if I went to the\ntheater. I went to the premiere because, for the premiere, I had free tickets. So, if there\nwas a play in Paris, I was at the premiere, the perfect orchestra seats. That was really\nperfect.",
        "A: The first show.",
        "A: Yeah, when, the show opens, at the opening hours. I had some tickets. So we had only the\njournalists and some, some people had those tickets in the best seat.",
        "A: I was proud, I was proud. I was working terribly hard for it. I remember then, I remember\nbeing told you had only one room that you could barely heat. So that was the dining room\nfor the French. They had no kitchen practically and that was the maid. The dining room\nand the dining room table was where you worked, so I remember working with my\nbrother at the dining room table. We never, never, never stopped before midnight. Never.\nWe were... and we never interrupted each other, either. He had his books and I had my\nbooks. You know, we were... and that was a way of life.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Yes, but that was earlier. Oh yes, he, he trained us. He, he would, he would give us little\nthings to translate. Yes, yes.",
        "A: Until \u201941, the Americans entered the war. We were plenty in, in anticipation of \u2014 we\nknew they were going to be the saviors. But it started elsewhere, but it didn\u2019t matter. The\n7\" of December, 1941, you did enter to the war. And you were to come eventually. Much\nlater, but you did eventually come, and at that point, the Germans pounced on the Jews.\nAnd requested the star. They requested that you register if you were a Jew, and that you\nwear a star. And that is where the lined up at the mairie, where I was later to be married.\nYou lined up as a Jew and that\u2019s where the Dashund (ph), who was a big philosopher,\nalready in Switzerland completely safe, came back to register as a Jew. People were\nproud to be Jewish and didn\u2019t realize what it was going to entail. You just didn\u2019t deny the\nfact that you were Jewish, \u201cDamn it, yes I am!\u201d",
        "A: No, I went with my mother to line up, my mother lined up.",
        "A: I was lining to be with her because I was afraid what was going to be... I was afraid that\nshe might be attacked in the street, who knows? I, I, I began to sense danger, but for her,\nnot for me. I was in no way in danger. Although I... we always joked that I, I really had\nthe Jewish nose. If the Germans were any more intelligent, they should have been after\nme, not after my mother.",
        "A: Mm-hmm.",
        "A: I had no idea what being Jewish meant.",
        "A: No significance. A sense of danger for her, definitely, very, very broad-based, you know.\nIntangible, but there. She was... and that star was very ugly.",
        "A: There was little that was said and intuitively that I heard others say, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t they\nresist?\u201d And you reach a point where you are so deep in the hole that you don\u2019t resist.\nNobody is going to resist. It was, it was an enormous wave that was engulfing Europe.\nThere was nothing you could do.",
        "A: Hmm\u2019?",
        "A: I see...",
        "A: Yeah, I see the lining up.",
        "A: Mm-hmm. I don\u2019t know what I would... I mean, you, you wouldn\u2019t tell them anything\nnow because it\u2019s so far away. But I understand deeply why they didn\u2019t revolt. It was too\nbig to resist.",
        "A: Oh, yeah. But now I have only American enthusiasm behind me, you know. I am not...\nBut...",
        "A: Then they were given, then they were given a piece of cloth. And it was sadistic \u2014 you\nhad to cut up your own star; you had to sew up your own star. It wasn\u2019t a star; they didn\u2019t\ngive you a Star. They give you a big piece of cloth with stars on it. And you cut it up and\nyou cut up around the star and you had to carefully sew so that it looked only like a star.\nIt was sadism.",
        "A: It had to be put on the left-hand side, outside at all moments. If you were in your pajamas\nand going out, it had to be on your pajamas. If you were outside on the street, the moment\nyou were outside on the street, you had to have the sign of your Jewish denomination,\nbeginning at age six.",
        "A: Mm-hmm.",
        "A: My grandmother by that time was... She died in \u201938.",
        "A: It doesn\u2019t make me feel Jewish.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: It was just really the reality of the day. Maybe it\u2019s survival instinct. But she was not\ngoing to deny it, although it meant religiously nothing.",
        "A: Proud.",
        "A: No, because they were not sure either, to this day, what is it that 1t meant by being\nJewish. According to that, in fact, my granddaughter who lives in McLain (ph) coming\nfrom the women is Jewish.",
        "A: Never.",
        "A: Never. As I tell you, if my mother had learned that there were extermination camps, she\nwould have not kept her little chamber pot ready for deportation.",
        "A: Not! Would not!",
        "A: Because it wasn\u2019t... If we had known that we were going to be stripped bare before we\neven hit the train... It was blissful ignorance. Until the end of the war we didn\u2019t know,\nuntil saw the news of the liberation of the camp, we did not know about the extent. We\ndid not see those cadavers piled on top of each other, not until 45.\nEnd of Tape #2\nTape #3",
        "A: Yes. The two actually went together. Then there was a period of time my brother and I\nwere really worried for her and that started when she began wearing the star. So, we\nescort her. That\u2019s the time they begin to have laws \u2014 in the subway there were no cars\nleft, as I told you. And you had to take the... and the Germans had reserved for\nthemselves the first class. So, the one little way, one of the little ways the French resisted\nwas that nobody went in the first class. And the Jews were forced to go in the last train.\nAnd so the word was in Paris that everybody had to go in the last train. It was a sort of an\nextraordinary joke, because you couldn\u2019t get into the Jewish trains. And this is where I\nhave my little quote about my mother and the French anti-Semite. I escorted her very\noften because I was afraid for her. So, I was once in the train with her, and we were in the\nlast train, and she came in the train, push shoving and there was, of course, no sitting\nplace free, until a very tall gentleman, very distingu\u00e9, de Gaulle-type, you know \u2014 very\nstrange to be that tall but very distingu\u00e9. And he got up all his height, bowed to her very\nlow and gave her his seat and said to her, and I remember that was my war quote: \u201cAh,\nMadame, when are we going to be allowed to be anti-s\u00e9mite again?\u201d [Pauses] I love that.",
        "A: I thought it was true. That\u2019s the way they were, when we were caught finally after \u2014 but\nthat\u2019s \u2014 I am going ahead of myself. When we were caught, the French came to arrest us.\nFinally, they caught up with me and then they came \u2014 well, 1t was morning, in the early\nmorning hours (ph), I was out and the French, the French policeman came to our arrest,\nnot the Germans. The French were doing the dirty work.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Probably.",
        "A: It was not allowed to them, mentally, morally, patriotically. It is not the moment where\nthey can even contemplate being anti-Semitic, because the Germans are anti-Semitic. It\nhad nothing to do with the Jews, probably. It hadn\u2019t much to do with my mother; she\nlaughed, and took the seat.",
        "A: Yeah, she had a sense of humor. And she took his seat.",
        "A: I\u2019ve been accused of it by an American friend \u2014 that was much, much later. I don\u2019t think\nso. If, by helping people, you feel superior, then maybe that was certainly the case. But I\ncertainly didn\u2019t feel superior to my mother.",
        "A: No, oh no, oh no, no.",
        "A: Oh, no, no, no, no. No, but I knew that \u201cSo be it\u2019, that\u2019s the way, at that point, the French\nwere and you better take it. But it was putting it into words \u2014 and beautifully.",
        "A: But it wasn\u2019t allowed them. I mean, the French, as I said, when they finally caught us and\nthen let us go, again, because of my baptism certificate... The French were overwhelmed\nwith what they were doing with us at that point. They were even in Paris, and the\nbeginning of the deportation was already terribly ugly.",
        "A: Yes, yes. Mm-hmm.",
        "A: Mm-hmm.",
        "A: Mm-hmm.",
        "A: No, my mother... My brother was married, married very early and moved into an\napartment. He married a Catholic and so he was completely out of any problem because\nhe was out of the circuit, you see. They couldn\u2019t trace him.",
        "A: Well, Germans were both extremely organized and completely disorganized. They were\nconcentrating, but they were sort of single-minded, you know, they had their eye on this\none. They weren\u2019t going to go to somebody else in the family who was married to\nsomebody from a long line of Catholic. That would be too complicated, no, please.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: And practically every day he came to see if we were still alive. There was a mixture of\nrealism, worry and completely aberrant behavior. Everyday he came to see if they were\nstill around, rather than tell them to move out. But that\u2019s the way it is. You asked me how\nit was and that\u2019s the way it is.",
        "A: Nah.",
        "A: Ah, wait a minute we were \u2014 no, no, I don\u2019t \u2014 I remember, I remember when the phone\nwas installed. I see myself in front of the phone, but I can\u2019t place it, but it... I spent my\nyouth without a phone definitely.",
        "A: Yes, that\u2019s what I said. But it was aberrant.",
        "A: Yeah, but it didn\u2019t take much of my life.",
        "A: No, completely oblivious and they were, too! I think completely unknowing of the extent\nof the horror of the camp. . Put that in a big box because that was what kept us\ngoing was the fact that we didn\u2019t realize the extent of it.",
        "A: There were no rumors in Paris.",
        "A: No rumors in Paris. My mother was working with the Jews with the U.G.LF. \u2014 that\u2019s the\nFrench association of the Jews. She had a friend that was with her when she lost her job\nwith the government because they were Jewish, at the same time her job went. So, she\nbumped into the Jews and worked with them. And then that\u2019s the way she got the dates\nwhen the Germans were going to take, to take the kids. It was the Jews who gave the\ninformation.",
        "A: No, the Jews were bounced out of all administrative jobs.",
        "A: In the government, that\u2019s it, lost her job.",
        "A: So, she gets the job working with a Jewish agency in Paris.",
        "A: Dating.",
        "A: I was, it was...very chaste, but very liberating. They were, don\u2019t forget also... I don\u2019t\nknow if I was already dating because there were no men. They were either prisoners or\nthey were in hiding or they were in the Resistance in the fields somewhere outside of\nParis. I wasn\u2019t going to... Who was there, who was there to date? Anybody, anybody\nbetween the age of 20 and 25, there was none living or they were sick. Prisoners, killed,\nsick, Germans prisoners of war, or else there was nobody. I mean, there was a few, but\nvery few. Of course, I dated, but at the Sorbonne, mildly. But that\u2019s the other part of the\nResistance I got involved in.",
        "A: At the Sorbonne, that was delivery arms. It had nothing to do with the children of the\nJews.",
        "A: It was the same time...approximately.",
        "A: The... The Resistance, 1t was extremely... First, 1t was very romantic \u2014 the only thing\nyou knew, you had somebody that hired you, and you depended on somebody above you.\nAnd you only knew \u2014 you only knew of that person was that the name he went by was\nnot his name. I was Michelle during the Resistance. Nobody knew where I lived, who I\nwas. You met in subways. You had to know nothing because of the torture. You had no\ninformation to give. I had no idea who the guy was; it was very, very seclusive (ph). I had\nno idea where he lived; I have not seen him ever. But he gave me orders and I filled out\nthe orders.",
        "A: I met a guy at the Sorbonne. He was also a student. He was slightly older and he was\ninvolved. And I had a teacher, a history teacher, who was later, much later, the witness at\nmy wedding. He was teaching at what would be the Radcliffe of the time and he was a\nbig... He was a min... He was in the Cabinet, in fact. Minister... he was the Secretary or\nthe Minister of Information, or whatever. And his son put me in touch with that guy and\nthat guy would give me the orders. But he knew nothing about me and I know nothing to\nthis day about him either.",
        "A: Because he knew where I came from. In other words, that teacher and his son had\nrecommended me as somebody solid. And there was also an element of that you had to,\nto risk.",
        "A: Oh, I loved it.",
        "A: Oh, it was funny.",
        "A: Wasn\u2019t it? I mean carrying, carrying arms.",
        "A: In a bag.",
        "A: It wasn\u2019t... You know, at that time, they were not huge things; they were just little\npistols.",
        "A: Well, most of the meetings were in the subway, because everybody was in the subway.\nTo this day, they are still in the subway.",
        "A: Oh, you had to wear clothes \u2014 You had to wear your, your right-hand label is going to be\nthis way or you are going to wear \u2014 a flower, of course, or some sign, by which you\nwould be recognized. And the only thing you knew, that you would meet that person\nonce and never again. And his name was not his name, and if you fell in love with him,\ntoo bad for you, because you were never going to have an appointment with that one\nagain. Very, very stimulating.",
        "A: Always a boy.",
        "A: Oh, I know, one thing, also. Very French, and very... something that the Germans never\nunderstood: You would meet a boy and you knew that he was simpatico because he was\ninvolved the same cause as you were \u2014 and if the Germans were around, then you would\nhuddle.",
        "A: That\u2019s right, in a corner of the porte-coche\u00e9re, and the man always protecting you. The\nman always with his broad back, so that if anything happened he was going to be hurt and\nyou were not going to be hurt. It was just delightful. And never again. Once or twice, I\nwould have given something to meet those guys again. But never again, it was never\ntwice the same.",
        "A: They, they were exciting moments and they didn\u2019t last.",
        "A: But to this day, I remember them.",
        "A: Mm-hmm.",
        "A: Because then, then it was less, less dangerous. Then, the Germans were fooled. They\nreally thought they were witnessing a love affair. And who would dare interrupt a boy\nand a girl, twenty-one or -two, kissing in the corner of a door? Not a German, no, they\nwere too well behaved, no, no, no.",
        "A: Well, at that... probably, at that point, I had passed it on...to the man.",
        "A: Oh...",
        "A: Yeah, one hour. All through Paris... not quite all through Paris. We really stayed around\nthe Latin Quarter. I was very much a student, my group was.",
        "A: Yeah, forever.",
        "A: He would take it and then that was it...never see him again. And the next day, I would\nget an order to meet somebody else, elsewhere in Paris, and...",
        "A: And do it again. Mm-hmm. But that was nothing; that had nothing to do with the Jews.",
        "A: Mm-mm. No.",
        "A: The less, the less you knew, the better off you all were. That\u2019s the sort of thing you go by.",
        "A: You had an appointment; you had an appointment that... oh, and you never are ahead of\ntime more than five minutes, never, never. Never late, but never ahead of time. You\narrive promptly, you really \u2014 time was of the essence \u2014 you arrive at a certain time and\nyou do your job and you disappear and disperse, take another direction in the subway or\nwhatever.",
        "A: You don\u2019t want to be too involved too long. In other words, the faster that can go, the\nbetter.",
        "A: Mm-hmm.",
        "A: No, I have the gun.",
        "A: Usually, I am bringing the arms to...",
        "A: To the other.",
        "A: Somebody...",
        "A: ...or else at another place which I don\u2019t know. The man I don\u2019t know, and I will never\nsee him again, the same thing. And it goes a chain of command, and it goes way up and I\nhave no idea where it goes past a certain level \u2014 the guy I got my orders from. And even\nthat guy, I don\u2019t know who he is or who he was.",
        "A: Jacques or Pierre or Robert. And he knows he\u2019s going to meet somebody called Michelle\nand that was who I was at that time and we would never see each other, each other again.\nAnd you were not supposed to try to see each other again. [Pauses] We made it romantic.",
        "A: Oh, it was lonely in a way, but I was studying hard so that I wasn\u2019t lonely.",
        "A: No. Ah, no! Ah, no! I know because she would have been endangered and that\u2019s the one\nthing I wanted to avoid. And also she was a babbler.",
        "A: No, oh no, no.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so.",
        "A: [pauses] \u00b041, \u00b042... Imoved out of my mother\u2019s place because I was endangering her. So,\nI took lodging at the student... it\u2019s still there.... on Boulevard St-Michel there was a\nstudent house. And I had, I had some friends that I had from the competitive years, you\nknow. Student friends, who knew nothing about my activities. No, it was... I mean,\nreally, if you call that lonely, that part was the silence.",
        "A: Yes, I don\u2019t know that... But maybe they were. Maybe they were. But we never\ndiscussed it afterwards. That was not something \u2014 but fun \u2014 it\u2019s done, it\u2019s disappeared,\nyou don\u2019t write about it, you forget about it. When I go to sleep, we were talking about\nthinking of... I think of all the times in Brittany in childhood. I don\u2019t think of those years\nat all. I never think of those years. Probably because they were so fleeting, the whole\nthing had to be fleeting in order to be safe for everybody.",
        "A: Mm-hmm. If I had been caught... that would have endan-... Because I was not hiding\nwho I was, and therefore, she as a Jew would be endangered in another, at another level.",
        "A: That\u2019s why I didn\u2019t live with her.",
        "A: Because I wanted my independence; that\u2019s why I had moved out.",
        "A: Mm-hmm. Practically next door.",
        "A: In another building.",
        "A: I must have, yeah. We were very close, we were very close.",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t think she was involved in my behavior. She thought I wanted to be\nindependent.",
        "A: I was on that scholarship and then again through school, I got a plum job, which\nconsisted [laughs] of teaching, but teaching people like, for instance, Dominique de\nVillepin, the present Minister of Foreign Affairs, had a father, whom I taught. Teaching\npeople from great families who were... failing. You know, they have that baccalaur\u00e9at,\nwhich 1s difficult. And so it was three or four hours in the morning, during which we\nwould tutor them 15 minutes at time, and see them all day long, always the same guy,\nteaching him everything for strictly that exam. And we had a practically 90 percent\nsuccess level. And that was very much fun, it was intensive teaching. I guess it... I never\nheard of it here too much. But over there, I think that school had some others created\nafter 1t, same intense \u2014 intensive teaching.",
        "A: No. And extremely well paid, oh boy!",
        "A: A fortune, they paid you a fortune. But those were the, the, their parents were in the\nCabinet. They were the nerds\u2019 children \u2014 the guy at the school called them \u201cChildren of\nDegenerates\u201d, degenerates, children of degenerates and they were the cabinet members\u2019\nchildren, I mean, they were all...",
        "A: Yes, that\u2019s the way we greeted them in the mornings. We were rough.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Or I was egotistical, I don\u2019t remember any passing. Later on, I would help her in life,\nwhen I, after I was married. But, at that time I think that I was well-dressed, and...",
        "A: And I paid... You know, it\u2019s far away, but I must have paid to stay at that student house.",
        "A: Mm-hmm.",
        "A: No, but it was royal.",
        "A: If it... because of the set-up of life in Paris, nothing changed. There were no cars to be\nhad, there were no... the great luxuries didn\u2019t exist, there were no furs... Yes, I had no...\nI was very slim, so I didn\u2019t even need to eat much. What were you going to spend your\nmoney on, simply clothes?",
        "A: That was late.",
        "A: Yes. No, that was, that was then. We had coupons for bread, we had coupons for... heh,\nwe had coupons for wine, and, and coupons for cigarettes. I remember those three things.\nI remember the episode because my mother was the most unlikely chain-smoking roly-\npoly. She was a chain smoker. And the postman did not smoke but he sure liked to drink,\nso she exchanged all her wine for all his cigarettes. That was, that episode I remember, so\nthere were tickets. Also, well I gave my tickets away... to young men I loved, who had\nmothers who were sick, or whatever. I didn\u2019t, I didn\u2019t have many needs... What can you\ndo? There wasn\u2019t that much in the way of luxury to spend on and I had never been born\nor raised in luxury. It meant nothing to me.",
        "A: No, no, I don\u2019t remember that, no. No, it was a student hostel. It\u2019s still there, on\nBoulevard St-Michel, and I think it was a room. And you know, they were not very heavy\non bathrooms, and definitely no kitchen.",
        "A: I guess so. I don\u2019t remember being deprived in any way...",
        "A: No. Not at that time. Not in those circumstances",
        "A: Mm-hmm, but we are not talking about the thing that I came here for.",
        "A: We are getting there?\nEnd of Tape #3\nTape #4",
        "A: No, I think I was still living with my mother when I did it. Because I used not to come\nback to the house, as I told you, not to come back to that apartment, not to involve her,\nnot to have her know about my activities. And so... And also for the date, I know that\nwhat really shook me was that Vel d\u2019Hiv... when the word came out, and it came out, not\nthat I saw the inside of the place, but rumor began circulating because, as I said it, was so\nclose to were everybody lived. And at that point, I thought I had to do something. But I\njust sort of had to do something.",
        "A: Yes, but that had nothing to do with children and when they began touching children...",
        "A: ... which was late, then I had to step in and do something. Because I was in a unique\nposition to probably be able to do something.",
        "A: My mother working with the Jewish organization had \u2014 thanks again to the organization\nof the German \u2014 an inkling or knowledge of the dates of the specific raids and the\naddresses of the specific raids. And that\u2019s the way I knew where to go to get the children.",
        "A: Well, when you think of it, they were terribly close to the enemy. It probably was. There\nwas a point there where it was unhealthy. But for my sake, it was practical. I think after\nthe war, there was some sort of disapproval of that sort of knowledge they had and the\nrelationship that they maybe shouldn\u2019t have had.",
        "A: I guess that\u2019s the way I got it.",
        "A: Because there was no other way I could get it. And I know of what transpired after the\nwar about the U.G.I.F and how close they were with the Germans, because they knew of\nthe German work as it took place.",
        "A: Probably, probably.",
        "A: But everything, everything was so...shrug your shoulder. You do it and then that\u2019s it. I\nthought it was normal, in other words, I never made... until you shook me up, I never\nthought of it. Definitely normal behavior. What are we going to do? Sit back and let it be.\nSo, I moved and in the same way, she thought it was absolutely normal that I, being the\ntype of person that I was, would feel that I had to do something. And I was in an unusual\nposition that I could do something. Because of the way the French government was going\nto protect me, one way or the other.",
        "A: Compelled.",
        "A: Well...",
        "A: That came, that came \u2014 for instance, when I think of it, the vivid image I have is that\nmoment on the train in the middle of the night when a German soldier opened the\ncompartment door, and I felt at that point, I felt a very deep fear, because if the kid or\nwhoever it was that I was transporting \u2014 and it was a kid capable of talking \u2014 had given\nout anything to verify that I was not with the mother, I was dead \u2014 I was just as good as\ndead at that point. So, when I went into it, I didn\u2019t know the extent of the danger and\nmost of the time, probably, I wasn\u2019t discovered, so there was no danger. It worked well.",
        "A: No, it had nothing to do with the arms.",
        "A: Completely different. That had to do with the Jewish U.G.LF.",
        "A: The, the taking care, the taking children away, yes. Because otherwise I would not know\nwhere they were to be had, to start with, Paris being a big city.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: It wasn\u2019t really underground. It was the Jewish... administration of the Jews, at the\ntime...",
        "A: No.",
        "A: And the only people that would have any inkling that I was doing it were the Jews, was\nthe Jewish organization in Paris.",
        "A: They came, they came individually. They would come to your apartment and ring, and if\nthe bell rang at four o\u2019clock in the morning, you knew who it was. And what happened is\nthat after the Vel d\u2019Hiv \u2014 this is when the Vel d\u2019Hiv come in \u2014 they would not anymore \u2014\nI didn\u2019t see it in the book \u2014 but they would not anymore tackle young children. So, the\nGermans were delighted to have somebody take them off their hands. Because it created\nsuch an endless fear of revolt among the French that they were afraid that at some point\nthe whole city would rebel against them. So, in some ways, I was in the middle. It was a\nsort of a cloaque, you know, of ugly things. It was some very shady participation there.\n\u2018Cause it had, at some point, to have the German willingness to give the babies, and that\nhappened at the very specific date. \u201cEnough with the babies! If there\u2019s one thing that we\ndon\u2019t need in Paris, it\u2019s that problem.\u201d And I stepped in and took that problem away from\ntheir hands.",
        "A: That I would...not that I know of.",
        "A: I never mentioned it and nobody mentioned it to me. It was rare... It could have been\nobvious, you know, all those people taking a train.",
        "A: Addresses.",
        "A: Times, times, time, I guess.",
        "A: Yes, and there is some persuading to do, because the women, as we know from personal\nexperience, do not give away their children. So I had some persuading to do to them,\nwhich was the difficult part. It was in two parts: first, \u201cThis is it, you are doomed\u201d\u2019.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know how I did, but I passed on that message. \u201cAs far as you are concerned, let it\nbe, there is nothing anybody can do. But there\u2019s something that that German soldier is\ngoing to allow to be done and that can be done: that I take that child away, and your child\nis safe.\u201d And then I would get the child. And the same day, he was in Italy, he or she, I\nremember.",
        "A: One child at a time.",
        "A: I couldn\u2019t handle...",
        "A: I think the Jews \u2014 the Jewish association took care of them until the train time.",
        "A: I got the child. I got...",
        "A: [Scoffs] No, much less.",
        "A: Much less, the Germans are not going to let me. They don\u2019t have the message. I have the\nmessage from the Germans at large; they don\u2019t. So they are brutal. They, they want the\nwhole thing finished and also maybe they have some human feeling that the whole thing\nis ugly, so they want it over with. So, I don\u2019t have much problem with them, I have the\nproblems with the woman.",
        "A: With the Germans. The Germans have been given the message: \u201cNo children, no dealing\nwith children under the age of three\u201d. So, I had no problem with the German at that point.\nI am in a small apartment in nowhere in Paris, usually a poor neighborhood, not\nespecially a Jewish neighborhood and confronting a woman, and that\u2019s the woman that 1s\nthe problem or could be the problem.",
        "A: No, there were no men in Paris.",
        "A: He is either a prisoner of war or in the Resistance or he\u2019s out.",
        "A: Women.",
        "A: Yeah, I think when they saw Germans come in, they had a feeling that... of the ugliness\nof it. Even if they were uncultured and uninformed, they would sense the enormity of it\nand it wouldn\u2019t be a battle. I don\u2019t remember a battle. And then you would have to get the\nidentity of the child in order to after the war to be careful to have kept track.",
        "A: Of who the child was! And at that point, he was in Italy, the child was in Italy, ina\nconvent. And that\u2019s when another battle started with the Italians.",
        "A: Nope. Never did.",
        "A: That\u2019s right. They would... all of the mothers would give a chance to the child.\nImmediately... what happened was that immediately they realized that there was no\nchance for them... with the Germans. There was no chance for them and if they took the\nchild with them, I told them in no uncertain terms \u201cThat child will not save you. The fact\nthat you have a child even at the breast will not save you.\u201d And the, the ugliness of the\nGerman soldiers was such that they felt it. And that I came from the, probably, I don\u2019t\nremember, but I came probably from the, from the Jewish agency, and that was\nreassuring for them. I had their identity, I had their card, and they trusted it. And then\nthey were, were in such a....state that they had to trust somebody.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: I had a deep understanding. It didn\u2019t give me... I was 21. I thought everybody was dead\nat 25 or should be dead...",
        "A: ... anyway. And that it was the time limit for living, and that I was immortal, definitely. I\nnever felt that there was any \u2014 felt deeply that I was immortal.",
        "A: Hmm. [nods]",
        "A: At that point, I had the feeling, because of the... because of the confrontation between the\nGerman soldier and the, and the women, I had the feeling that it was going to be very\nugly.",
        "A: They, they were arresting the women.",
        "A: That\u2019s when I came.",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: Because otherwise, the kid would not be left behind in the apartment all by himself.",
        "A: I wouldn\u2019t have had a chance.",
        "A: They wouldn\u2019t do it. But when they see \u2014 saw the Germans come for the family and\nthey\u2019re willing to let go of the child. Then they realize the danger they were in, and they\nwere willing to let go of the child.",
        "A: Well, when you think of it, it\u2019s the only way it made sense.",
        "A: And it was not very difficult because they really banged \u2014 they didn\u2019t knock at the door \u2014\nthey really banged at the door. And they looked... very... you would have to have a\npicture them \u2014 they were Gestapo soldiers; they were not regular German soldiers. Or\nthey were French policemen. But the whole, the whole episode was very dramatic and the\nwomen felt it.",
        "A: They banged at the door!",
        "A: I guess I must have been with them.",
        "A: The whole thing is amazing, that it took place and I... and we survived.",
        "A: At other times, at other times, when I was taken with my mother, it was, it was another\nthing. When they finally got my number and came for me early morning. At that point,\nthere were a lot of hysterics. But when it was individual, the mothers were very\nprotective of the child and if you have a young child, you don\u2019t want to be hysterical in\nfront of the child, so they kept the face.",
        "A: They feel it but they freeze.",
        "A: Which is what saved my life in the train when the Germans came in the compartment was\nthat the reaction of fear in that child then is going to be freezing and not yelling.",
        "A: It was very dichotomique. Yeah, it didn\u2019t faze me.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: I think, you had to be anesthesized (ph) or you\u2019re not going to work for the procedure.",
        "A: To be anesthesized.",
        "A: In some way, if you are very deeply involved in the whole procedure of the Germans,\nyou\u2019re not going to do it. You\u2019re going to miss it; you had to keep your composure.",
        "A: Then, I give it during the day to the Jewish thing because I have to get my train ticket.\nThere is a procedure.",
        "A: They keep the children until...",
        "A: Right, until train time comes. And then I get my ticket, the children were traveling free,\nand then I get my ticket, always in the same direction: Paris-Nice.",
        "A: Paris-Nice, which is the Paris-M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e. That\u2019s a very straight train, it 1s an\novernight.",
        "A: It\u2019s an overnight train, so it was nice.",
        "A: The ones I took care of were all under three.",
        "A: Yes. But not in front of Germans, they wouldn\u2019t.",
        "A: Oh, babbled, yes.",
        "A: But they knew I wasn\u2019t their mother. But they were in pretty bad shape, bad day, you\nknow. They had had a bad day.",
        "A: Sure, I was... warm and nice, but I was only 21. I hadn\u2019t even slept with a man; I was out\nof it. In the deep sense that I would have been when I had my own children in my arms,\ncompletely different, which probably helped.",
        "A: I would have become hysterical myself otherwise.",
        "A: Then I took the train and...",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes, yes the U.G.I.F. organized... I had, I had the stuff.",
        "A: Oh, well. [shrugs]",
        "A: At the time, you know, it was during war years, you did what you could. And they are not\nthat keen on cleanliness. But the child was safe. And I \u2014 they had \u2014 they had those long\nbanks, which are fairly padded. And I would give my warmth, in other words, I would\nput the baby on me so that, you know and I would wrap my arms around, so that the child\nfelt protected at the end of a difficult day. It was a difficult. I, I tried to feel for the baby.\nIt must have been very horrible. But they fell asleep and that\u2019s... until they stopped and\nthey...",
        "A: Yes, I had that episode when the Germans came in and the child...",
        "A: Because one time, the Germans, they were patrolling the train. I don\u2019t know what for, but\nfor... And at that time, I was frightened. Because my life was really on the line, if the kid\ngave me away. But I can remember, they absolutely froze; they never said a word, they\nwere just stiff with fear. They remembered the morning episode, the separation of their\nmother. It was the end of a terrible day. So, I didn\u2019t have any problem with the children,\nand we arrived in Nice finally. And I still remember, I still remember the view of the\nItalians. The Italians were cowards made live and had declared war with France, their\nneighbor, in June \u201940 and had moved militarily to Nice. That\u2019s all. [Laughs] That\u2019s all\nthey could manage. And so they occupied from Monaco to Nice, which is 30 kilometers\nof France territory. But for those kids it meant life and death because when you saw an\nItalian soldier, you knew that they were not going to kill any babies. So that\u2019s it. And I\nknow that they took them to some religious institution in Italy.",
        "A: No, they were in the train station.",
        "A: Yes, yeah, yes. But at that time, the, the Jewish organization in Paris must have\ncommunicated. They had contact near the frontier, and those children were taken to\nconvents. And I know that because there was an enormous ruckus between those\nconvents and Israel, at the end of the war, because Israel wanted those Jewish kids to\ncome to Israel. And the Italians wouldn\u2019t give them. At that point, I thought it was a huge\njoke, I couldn\u2019t care less... what happened, they were alive. Whether they were Israeli\ncitizen or Italian citizen or no citizen, they were safe.",
        "A: Well, well I... that would be given to whoever was handed the child. I would give the\npap-whatever written scribbles I had about the identity of the mother.",
        "A: Then that could be their problem.",
        "A: I got rid of that problem with the child.",
        "A: Oh, as far as I know from documentation, from movies, from everything that has been\nwritten, there was not one child killed by Italians.",
        "A: I had a feeling that I had to come back if only so that my mother wouldn\u2019t be worried and\nsuspicious, and so that I could continue in my studies or whatever I was doing. But that\nwas the least of my worries, so I don\u2019t really remember. I don\u2019t think I stayed in Nice \u2014 I\ndidn\u2019t have any money.",
        "A: Hmm\u2019?",
        "A: It\u2019s an overnight.",
        "A: Yes, I guess I must \u2014 must have stayed somewhere. Maybe there was a day train. I have\nno idea of the return. That was...",
        "A: I had another place and one night, I was so tired coming back early, I came to sleep at her\nplace and that\u2019s when the Germans got us. So it was a...",
        "A: I was going back and forth.",
        "A: Well, she must have known there was something going on. She knew better than to ask.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No, probably not more than ten. I remember just a very few of them, and definitely part\nof the job was not to count.",
        "A: Hmm\u2019?",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes, that I do. Some moments are very clear.",
        "A: No, that they were children and they were in my lap and they were sleeping and that\ndamn door flew opened.",
        "A: Oh, yeah, that was for me, too. But the people in the compartment never knew much\neither. They didn\u2019t like \u2014 nobody liked to be asked by the Germans about their I.D. in the\nmiddle of the night.",
        "A: ...1 went back to sleep in my bed.",
        "A: And that night, that morning, they came. Unmistakable knock at the door. And they were,\nthose were French policemen, two little French policemen almost may age.",
        "A: Yes, they were maybe 23 to my 21, but very young. And I remember them \u2014 they were\nalmost my size and they followed me... to where I washed. They watched me wash,\nsupposedly because they were afraid I was going to commit suicide.",
        "A: They come to my mother\u2019s house.",
        "A: To take me to the Germans.",
        "A: And my mother.",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "A: I think, I think that they were, yes. I think they were tracking me finally.",
        "A: Yes, right.",
        "A: Well, as I said, I was blissfully lackadaisical. I... 1t is a tendency I have kept through my\nlife. I think it helps with the bumps of life altogether.",
        "A: They happened to pick up my mother [laughs] at the same time.",
        "A: Mm-hmm. And at that point mostly... What was lovely at that point was that the only\npapers that she carried was my baptism certificate. And she let those little soldiers, those\nlittle policemen, French policemen follow me and see as much of me as possible. She\ndidn\u2019t say, \u201cLeave her alone. Don\u2019t go to the bathroom with her.\u201d No, she wanted as\nmuch intimacy between those two little guys and her little daughter as possible. And that,\nat the end of the morning, is what saved our lives.",
        "A: Because then we were taken to the Germans. Then we were taken to the Marais and the\nGerman scene was very... That\u2019s when the women were hysterical. And there were 52 of\nus, as I remember, and they knew that I was going to get out. And they all gave me their\nlists of addresses and people to notify. And not one of single one of them came back\nalive. So, what happened is that the scene got uglier and uglier and at some point, as you\nsee in movies, you are pushed into a courtyard. And in the courtyard, there 1s a truck and\nthe back of the truck flips down and at that point, you\u2019re pushed in. And at that moment,\nit was bedlam. The women were hysterical. The whole tr-... the whole thing was\ncrowded; there were too many people for the courtyard. And my mother kept after those\ntwo little guys \u2014 and she was much more in danger than you can imagine \u2014 was keeping\nafter them saying, \u201cLet her go, she shouldn\u2019t be here, let her go!\u201d And at some point, they\nsaid, \u201cThe hell with you, get out of here!\u201d And at that point, I lost all my courage. I began\nto cry and she found all her courage back and she was, that little roly-poly with no\ngumption at all, was smiling and said, \u201cOkay, let\u2019s get out.\u201d And she knew how to get out\nand she knew how to find the caf\u00e9. And she stood there at the Jewish caf\u00e9, which 1s still\nthere, it\u2019s a Jewish caf\u00e9, and she plunked down and she had to have her cafe, in front of\nall the trucks going by.\nEnd of Tape #4\nTape #5",

There that the Germans are, and then it becomes ugly, ugly, I\nmean, they start... My mother puts her hand on the table and they whipped her. So, that\nsort of behavior I hadn\u2019t seen before.",
        "A: Well they ask for I.D. and I showed the I.D. and so they, they know that it is I and it 1s\nmy mother. And then we went into a waiting room with 50 other people, all women and\nchildren that morning, by the way.",
        "A: I guess so. There was no other thought that you could have; that was it.",
        "A: Yes, since they watched me wash, they watched me dress! I was wearing the same thing I\nwore during the whole war years. I spent a lot on shoes. As I told you, the rich don\u2019t give\nup their shoes, so the luxury for me was to have shoes made to mesure \u2014 custom made.\nAnd no stockings because there were no stockings to be had during the war and, you\nknow, I remember the coat, which was very handsome. It was cut up from the beautiful\ncoat of a man cousin of mine, the rich cousins. So, I was simply well-dressed, no hat.",
        "A: They watched me get undressed...",
        "A: Wash...",
        "A: They went to the bathroom with me. So they watched me wash, bare.",
        "A: They sat around the sink with me while I washed.",
        "A: They didn\u2019t speak, but they were with me. And I came back and I snuck to the bathroom\nand that was so small they couldn\u2019t get in. But they stayed at the door of the bathroom. I\nwent to the bathroom and I went to my room and I got dressed and they were there when\nI got dressed. Then that\u2019s when they got attached.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think that...",
        "A: I don\u2019t think it was a conscious thought.",
        "A: They would have done anyhow. I mean, that was part of the.. humiliating you. You\nknow, it\u2019s humiliating to have somebody watch what you are washing your behind are\ntwo young people, snickering. They didn\u2019t snicker. They didn\u2019t say anything, do\nanything, just watched...but they were French.",
        "A: They were in a French uniform. And then we went to the subway, in second class, not\nspecially in a compartment. And those were French people going to work very early in\nthe morning. Therefore, those are not the bourgeois; those are the working class people.\nAnd you feel that they didn\u2019t like it.",
        "A: No! That was dangerous. Those French people were a... police people are... well, they\nhad their batons, at least, you know; it was dangerous to say anything.",
        "A: She just took her hand off.",
        "A: Just a whip.",
        "A: Probably, she didn\u2019t say anything.",
        "A: Mm-hmm, it was just women and children, no men at all.",
        "A: It\u2019s supposed... There is a room where the Germans are. And then there is the other\nroom. There is no need; there is nowhere to go.",
        "A: Would be through that room, which had their desk.",
        "A: I think there was, going into the courtyard. Nobody tried anything. They were kind of,\nyou go into a sort of what you would call a state of shock. You are not quite at your most\nvivid at that moment.",
        "A: People are not talking, but they are passing pieces of paper to me with their name and\naddresses to contact.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: From the word go, they knew I had a baptism certificate. And my mother was flaunting it\nprobably and talking about it. And they knew that if one person had a chance of getting\nout, I was the one, and therefore I could contact, because they had no way of contacting\ntheir relatives. So, I came out with a list of names and addresses.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yeah. And it was. Fifty-two of them, not one of them otherwise.",
        "A: Flips down.",
        "A: I saw a movie once that, that depicted that. That\u2019s the only movie that was about the time\nthat was realistic to me. It shows the truck \u2014 that\u2019s when you knew \u2014 and the back flips\ndown, and you\u2019re pushed in, and then that\u2019s it.",
        "A: Was enough to get...dozens of people. It was a big truck. It took the courtyard. And the\npolicemen were going on the side of the courtyard toward the exit...and by that time they\nwere petrified.",
        "A: The women were somewhat hysterical. They were crying; if you were screaming, you\nwould be whipped. But sobbing probably and it was not pretty.",
        "A: At that point, my mother was following the policemen, so we must have gone to the side\nof it. And she was talking to them constantly, saying, \u201cLook at her, she should not be\nhere, let her go\u201d.",
        "A: Then they said...",
        "A: \u201cEh, merde, foutez le camp! Foutez le camp!\u201d",
        "A: \u201cMerde! Foutez le camp!\u201d They were tired of the whole scene.",
        "A: Yes, there were Germans, but it was such a confused set-up. There were only a few\nGerman soldiers; there were two French policemen who stayed out of the way; and there\nwere 52 \u2014I counted them \u2014 52 Jews. With a lot of commotion, because it\u2019s a lot of crying\nof babies and yelling of mothers; they forecast the worst.",
        "A: \u201cThe hell with you!\u201d",
        "A: \u201cGet the hell out of here.\u201d",
        "A: That\u2019s when my mother suddenly recovered and became a very clear-eyed mother again.\nAnd I became nothing in tears.",
        "A: At that moment, the change of personality was unbelievable. She became the mother-in-\ncharge and I became the child good-for-nothing and in tears. And then she pulled me out.\nWell, you\u2019d have to see the porte-coche\u00e9re \u2014 It\u2019s a very specific thing for those enormous\nmansions, where they used to have the carriages come in with the four horses and a cart,\nright? So that\u2019s the courtyard and the porte-coche\u00e9re 1s opened \u2014 it had to be opened \u2014 and\nthat\u2019s the entrance that\u2019s an enormous entrance, enough for the truck to come out.",
        "A: Yes! We went out by the truck! The truck was occupying the whole courtyard and we just\nsneaked away and the Ger-... the... two little French policemen were there and we went\nout.",
        "A: They were very busy. It was bedlam.",
        "A: My mother goes to Flambaum. She crossed the street and I said, \u201cYou are out of...!\u201d And\nwe see the truck going out... with the 50 people inside. And she\u2019s at the caf\u00e9 terrace \u2014\nterrace! \u2014 not even inside! On the terrace! She said, \u201cI have to have my coffee,\u201d and she\nhas her coffee. And Flambaum 1s patting her hand and saying, \u201cOh, madame, things will\nbe all right\u2019. And so the whole scene was preposterous.",
        "A: There was nobody.",
        "A: It was very early still.",
        "A: Yes, but it wasn\u2019t a crowded terrace like the Montparnasse in...",
        "A: She just...yeah, I don\u2019t know, emotionally, she was drained, what you would say.",
        "A: Funny how you can have your highs and then suddenly are completely wiped out. And\nshe always drank, drank coffee. She was a chain smoker and a heavy coffee drinker.",
        "A: Sure.",
        "A: I think it was, the whole thing was a little too much.",
        "A: I was overwhelmed. It was because it was such an ugly scene.",
        "A: Yeah, can you imagine 50 women knowing they are doomed? And here I had talked with\nthem five minutes before. And they were young women with their children. They were\ngetting them younger and younger.",
        "A: Hmm\u2019?",
        "A: Oh, sure. I\u2019m not making any effort to... [Chuckles].",
        "A: No. No, not really. I never was angry, all through it. I rarely, rarely get angry...doesn\u2019t\nhelp.",
        "A: Oh, that I do. And I don\u2019t get revengeful either. I remember when Paris fell. The\nAmericans marched down the Champs Elys\u00e9es. And I wanted to see the redition (ph) of\nthe Germans; so I went to the Arc de Triomphe. And the behavior of the French, who had\nbeen so non-committal during the war, was atrocious. They were spitting at... you know,\nby that time the Germans were putting in arms some people who were 18 and... nothing\nlittle fellows, who had seen nothing, done nothing. They were just marching, and they\nhad to have their head \u2014 their hands on their head to shame them. And the French \u2014 I was\npreventing the French from hurting the Germans. These were the wrong ones, anyhow.\nBut the scene was very ugly. The French didn\u2019t ever behave well.",
        "A: No matter what was happening, they were wrong, on the wrong side.",
        "A: Those are popular classes that don\u2019t go to the Champs Elys\u00e9es to see the Americans\nmarch down.",
        "A: It\u2019s very funny how it is a city, the city 1s divided; those are not the same people.",
        "A: They were... We were at Passy. You see the Americans march at the Arch of Triumph.\nThat\u2019s near where we were, at my grandparents\u2019 house in Passy. Those are the exquisite,\nbroad avenues, and... little working people were not anywhere.",
        "A: No, one. I remember only one because that was the one where I would have gone and\nwhere the women I was talking with were going.",
        "A: Not long, just until after they had gone. And then, then she decided she wanted to go back\nto her apartment, where we had been captured the day before \u2014 the same day! To get her\nsilverware, of all things, I mean, she never... She always was one train behind, you\nknow.",
        "A: Sure!",
        "A: And the Germans, in their disorganization, never went back to that apartment. They had\ndone their hit.",
        "A: Well I... It wasn\u2019t the most comfortable place for me to be. And to see that little fatty...\nAnd have you ever \u2014 and the crystal ware \u2014 have you ever piled crystal ware in a box? It\nbreaks as you put it down. It was utterly absurd; it was very much my mother. And then\nshe gave it to the neighbor downstairs to keep for the rest of the war. And one day, all\nafter the war, it was all there. But the Germans never came back to that apartment.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: We didn\u2019t have much.",
        "A: Yes, to live, and we lived out the rest of the war there. And when there was the liberation\nof Paris, I remember that I went from Passy \u2014 it was a very short walk to the Eiffel Tower\n\u2014 and I remember the American who flew under the Eiffel Tower. They were having so\nmuch fun liberating Paris. They were the anti-German. Imagine, flying under the Eiffel\nTower. They had fun.",
        "A: Small plane, but still...",
        "A: ... grandparents.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: They stayed in Brittany all through the war.",
        "A: Sure.",
        "A: Then there was a concierge. And what is funny is that the concierge never gave us up.\nYou had to... you were in danger all the time. All that was necessary \u2014 Passy was\nsurrounded by Germans; all the beautiful apartment buildings were occupied by\nGermans.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember.",
        "A: What we did then was hide people in that apartment.",
        "A: Yes, but they were older then. But people who were in danger of being deported. I had a\nbed; it never was empty. I was heavily dating, the curfew was midnight, so I would come\nback at midnight, get into my bed and it was full of people. Not full of people, but it was\nat least one person here, one person there, it would be...",
        "A: They were people who were hiding.",
        "A: They knew...",
        "A: They knew my mother and they knew me and knew that we had survived and we were at\nPassy, they had the address and wanted an apartment for overnight. So, it served as a sort\nof a refuge.",
        "A: Yes. And then they would have to find a permanent place where to hide until the\nliberation of France. And that I found for them. I found among my friends people who\nwould be willing to take women, children, whatever, for years to come. And it was\nmagnificent. At that point, among friends, that you found people who were willing to\nhelp, really to help. And I kept, kept those friends on both ends. The people who took\ncare of the people who were taken care of \u2014 I saw them until they died.",
        "A: In the living room, I remember one. I was talking with friends of the fate of a young\nwoman that I knew whose husband had been taken, and nephew had been killed at the\nage of 18 months. The whole family was absolutely destroyed. And she was beginning a\npregnancy so she really wanted that child, because her husband just had been taken. And\nshe came to live with us at Passy. And then I saw a friend one day when she was there,\nand I said, \u201cWho on earth is going to be able to take you, pregnant, for the rest of your\npregnancy, to salvage the child?\u201d And the friend said, \u201cI will!\u2019 And she had her in her\nliving room \u2014 she had a very small place \u2014 for the remainder of the year. And they\nbecame the best of friends after the war. They did \u2014 had two houses with joint backyards.\nBut then, they never forget. I will. So, there were some individual cases of French\ndevotion.",
        "A: [Sighs] That was a flow...I don\u2019t know how long... you had the... we have to think of\ndates, that was \u00b043, \u201944. It was just one year...",
        "A: One year. And then the Americans debarked and that was over. Although they continued\ndeporting, but I didn\u2019t know it then.",
        "A: If you... you can...If you were cute, you can always find a man [Laughs].",
        "A: Medical, medical doctors like my brother, anybody who was in one of those higher\nschools of higher learning were there.",
        "A: Hmm\u2019?",
        "A: Constantly.",
        "A: The door opened and there I was. [Laughs]",
        "A: Yes, I dated...I remember, I dated several times during the evening. And the best date\nwas around ten o\u2019clock. Six o\u2019clock, not very good; eight wasn\u2019t really better, but the ten\no\u2019clock date was really the serious one of the evening. That was... my heavy dating,\nnothing ever happened, but it was very exhilarating.",
        "A: Oh, yes, uh-huh.",
        "A: Yes, right.",
        "A: Mm-hmm. And Paris is a lovely city where to walk.",
        "A: Not L.",
        "A: No. I don\u2019t think it was at all the morals of the generation. You are talking to somebody\nwho is in her 80s. That was 60 years ago, you know. I think that behavior is only in the\nlast... It became much more lax in America with my daughter\u2019s generation. But I had not\nseen it in my generation.",
        "A: Kissing.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: So, that\u2019s why it had to be that time.",
        "A: Well, we made an appointment.",
        "A: Anyhow, when you are out with a guy, you don\u2019t feel that frightened. No, I didn\u2019t have\nthe tendency to feel frightened.",
        "A: I could not find them for the life of me. They are not important. [Laughs]",
        "A: That, I probably could find it. I have it.",
        "A: I had it; it did say my name. I never destroyed papers, so somewhere in a box, I might \u2014 if\nI find it, Pll send it to you.",
        "A: At the museum.",
        "A: No, but my mother could collect for, for us.",
        "A: No, no you could not. No, no, this is the official French government that gave them at the\nmairie and mairie, at the...",
        "A: Yes, you get your coupons every month. Everybody did.",
        "A: When?",
        "A: I forgot, I tell you. The food, as I said, was very, of very minimal interest.",
        "A: [Shakes head]",
        "A: No, I... The hard times was the German occupation, you know. For instance, during\nthe... when the Americans liberated us, we had \u2014 it was \u00b045, the Battle of the Bulge \u2014 one\nof the hardest winters we ever had. We had no heat whatsoever and it didn\u2019t matter. I\nremember when we invited an American for dinner. He was the one who introduced me\nto my husband. He came, he was flabbergasted that we had absolutely nothing. You\nknow, it was a polenta-type of thing. And from then on, he brought us the supplies; he\nwas very generous and fun. But we didn\u2019t suffer. We ate whatever there was to be eaten.",
        "A: It isn\u2019t that important in life. The freedom was what mattered.\nTape #6",
        "A: After liberation?",
        "A: The year...",
        "A: We felt safe.",
        "A: After... If you were going to be given in by the concierge, it\u2019s going to take place in two\nweeks.",
        "A: If not, she\u2019s not going to say anything.",
        "A: Sure.",
        "A: Sure.",
        "A: They must have, I must have the letters...",
        "A: Yes, there was, but you... there are ways of going around it. If they were family \u2014 I\nshould have brought you one I have--I found a hil- hilarious one of my brother\u2019s from the\nPyrenees experience in France. It was... they were typed; they were printed by the\nGermans. And I better give them to you because the print 1s disappearing. If it isn\u2019t good\npaper, you know, the printing it becomes very, very white out. But it\u2019s all printed so is\ntu\u00e9, killed. It\u2019s for people like war killed, tu\u00e9, bless\u00e9, fatigu\u00e9, d\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9, provision. I mean,\nthe things that really mattered. And you had no right to write anything that had not to do\nwith the immediacies of daily living. I mean, people find a way of... And you, you find a\nway of writing. You should see how microscopic your handwriting can be. And they let\nit, they let it ride. And you can imagine the German spending his day looking at those\ncards going by.",
        "A: Oh, unfazed.",
        "A: Unfazed. I mean, they had a property, they were solidly established. They spent, I told\nyou, they spent most of the year in Brittany, most of their older lives. And although it was\nvery uncomfortable, it was a beautiful set-up and they were safe. I don\u2019t think they\nworried.",
        "A: Nothing.",
        "A: Nothing, I think... I don\u2019t remember.",
        "A: The newspapers were censored. [laughs] The correspondence between people may have\nbeen censored but if there was one thing that was censored, it was the newspapers and...\nso you learn practically noth-... In fact, I knew nothing about the American debarkation\nfrom the German-French and French newspaper.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t hear one word of rumor.",
        "A: We were expecting, expecting, expecting. It was kind of joke. I remember a neph-... a\nnephew of mine \u2014 two, two and a half \u2014 and he was spending the night at Passy with me,\nat the place we were. And he was learning to speak and he was bouncing on the bed. And\nI remember the thing that he was saying, \u201cLes Am\u00e9ricains sont a Paris.\u201d or whatever; he\nwas bouncing on the bed. I mean, there was some knowledge, but it was after the fact;\nthey were already there.",
        "A: BBC?",
        "A: The Jews, their radios were taken. Oh, they, they were very thorough. To have no radio,\nno communication, the, the subway was full of radios. You know why? Because the Jews\nput their radios in the subway, and we put one in the subway.",
        "A: Yeah, I have seen that in the movies, but I don\u2019t remember in France sitting around the\nradio listening, I don\u2019t.",
        "A: It had to end.",
        "A: It had to end; you were getting kind of tongue sticking out and panting. By that time, it\nhad lasted quite a long but...we knew... When was it? I didn\u2019t think that...I remember\none episode. I wrote it... It\u2019s after the American landed. Somebody... saw a truck, an\nAmerican truck, and touched the wheel, the, the, the tire. And the tire was real rubber.\nAnd he communicated to everybody that the Americans were going to win the war\nbecause we were sick in ersatz by now. Nothing was real you know; everything was\nersatz. Those were people with real rubber, they had it made.",
        "A: I\u2019m not a depressed type. No, with old age, when I had that massive stroke, that was a\ntime when I was depressed. It was very depressing to find myself completely paralyzed.\nBut then, you bounce back.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No, depressed 1s not the word, no.",
        "A: At some point, I was overwhelmed.",
        "A: I was overwhelmed because, to this day, it is beyond my humane understanding to see\nthat extent of cruelty. That was, that was unbelievable... That a nation could then inflict\nthat on their neighbors... and a nation civilized. I was a student; therefore, the idea that\nthose guys were usually learned people, they were not savages from the depth of the\njungle, they came from universities. And they could live through it.",
        "A: It\u2019s not individually. As a nation, it overwhelmed me. And that wasn\u2019t depression; that\nwas just amazement. To this day, I don\u2019t... I don\u2019t understand what went on.",
        "A: Oh, no! That I never wondered, no, because that was also my salvation... You get lost in\na good book \u2014 that\u2019s it, you found your salvation.",
        "A: No, but I never felt thought philosophically about it; I just acted when needed.",
        "A: Hmm\u2019?",
        "A: No. I don\u2019t know. My short-time memory is gone.",
        "A: No, I was having a funny thought. I was thinking one thing that came of the war. I told\nyou how cold people were. It was unbelievable that the walls were dripping wet.\nDripping wet from humidity, you know, no heat in the building for five years and then\nthere were the walls. And... what was I thinking? Oh, you lived in bed. To this day my\nfavorite place is my bed. You absolutely lived in bed because that was the warm place\nyou could control and you could do practically everything. Not talking about even the\nlove part, which we didn\u2019t make, but you could eat, you could read, you could write, you\ncould talk. And when I met John, I received... I received my dates in my bed. They sat\naround, and I remember John, covered with his uniform because the apartment was so\ncold, sitting by my right side and we had conversation. That\u2019s the way I entertained.",
        "A: Uh-uh. I think there were two week... two weekends... I, I know that before that there\nwere two weekends. That\u2019s almost nothing. In one room, one room.",
        "A: No hot water ever. No stockings. That came with the Americans.",
        "A: Yeah, you, you were always feeling damp and cold, yes. That was the... to me, that was\nthe worst part of the war.",
        "A: Of the cold.",
        "A: Not the hunger at all.",
        "A: It takes, no, it takes nothing to fill you up. You can eat a little bread and you are satisfied.\nAnd I was young and slim.",
        "A: No, I kept my weight.",
        "A: No, you... you had a very unhealthy but fattening diet. Bread is fattening. We had bread\nand flour. That we did have \u2014 a sort of polenta.",
        "A: I told you, there was no coffee. Come on, coffee is an exotic thing. You can\u2019t coffee any\nmore than you can have tobacco. They don\u2019t come from France. France doesn\u2019t cultivate\nthat sort of plant. So, what... We did have wine. There was, I told you, a ration of wine. I\ndidn\u2019t drink any. Water, so I only drank water.",

There was no,\nwhat\u2019s that, no butter, no fats. No fats. One time a week, I mean, there was nothing to be\nfat \u2014 a lot of vegetables and fruit. It was the perfect slender diet.",
        "A: In France, we sure did. And we went to farms to pick them up. You picked up your\ncherries. You had friends who lived in the country and you... I went 50 miles a day on\nmy bicycle to pick up cherries from the tree, to pick up strawberries from the ground. It\nwas a very... They were precious things that you had. But no fat \u2014 no fat on you. Nobody\n\u2014 that\u2019s the thing \u2014 there was, at the end of the war, not one obese person in France. They\nall died. They couldn\u2019t take the diet.",
        "A: She lost... she lost it. She was extremely thin by the end the...",
        "A: Sure.",
        "A: Some.",
        "A: A Jewish mother, she would manage.",
        "A: Well, there were weekends.",
        "A: Even if you work, you have weekends. I would do, I would do the whole thing in one\nday. I remember, I would do the 50, 50 miles a day.",
        "A: The balcony.",
        "A: You ate it.",
        "A: It isn\u2019t that warm in Paris.",
        "A: I remember when we first, when I was first married and we had a maid. We had to\nhave... I had an American husband; we had a magnificent apartment overlooking the\nLuxembourg Gardens. And he absolutely insisted we have an icebox. I had never heard\nof that. So, we had an icebox. She said, \u201cWhat are we going to put in it?\u201d I still\nremember, \u201cMadame Nicole, what are we going to put in the icebox to please Mr. John?\u201d\nSo, we would think, and we would find something to put in the icebox to please the\nAmerican. But she would put... You see, they had those, those things in the windows. To\nthis day, if you go to Paris to an old apartment, in the kitchen, there 1s an opening in the\nwindow in the kitchen and it is sort of a meshed window, and all the food was there.\nThat\u2019s... the refrigeration, and it works for them. For that sort of very moderate weather,\nit works. And then also you have the shops. You shop everyday. It\u2019s a different way of\nlife.",
        "A: When we saw the rubber tire. The Americans were overwhelming. When you saw them\ncome down the Champs Elys\u00e9es, you know that it could not be resisted. In a, ina\ndifferent way... it was a maelstrom of strength and a fresh strength. By that time, the\nGermans were beaten. They were down to their last troops, to their youngest soldiers.\nThey were demoralized...",
        "A: And you could see that in the type of soldiers that they would send in the streets.",
        "A: At... that was at the liberation of Paris. What was the name of the...? There is still that\nhotel. There is the Arch of Triumph and then there is a street... L\u2019 Attala... No, not\nl\u2019Attala; it was another name. There was a huge hotel facing the Champs Elys\u00e9es and the\nArch of Triumph at an angle. And that\u2019s when I saw, all that, and then the Avenue Foche\nand that... They were marching.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: And I protected them.",
        "A: Yes, from that. I shamed the people who was doing it because they were wrong. There\nwere the same ones who would sleep with the Americans. They would sleep with, they\nwould sleep with... These were not the, the ugly fighters. They were just easy to catch\nand it was ugly and it was demeaning of the people who did it as well as the people, and\nit was very ugly to watch...very ugly to watch.",
        "A: And it... and the people who were doing it probably were the people who had done\nnothing to resist the German occupation. But they hit on... maybe they were worthless\nbut it was nonsensical; it was beside the point. And they marched them the same way that\nthey marched the young soldiers with their hands on their... head.",
        "A: Again around at the Arch of Triumph, the same route.",
        "A: There were... Yes, I don\u2019t want to give you the impression that the whole life was ugly.\nBut those were very ugly scenes. It seems that people took their worst possible feelings\nand they had a way of expressing those very ugly feelings. And they took an opportunity\nand it hit at the wrong target.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: They were ashamed.",
        "A: They were ashamed at what they were doing. I saw Arletty, you know, the... the great\nactress who... She had a fabulous word, they shaved her head. She slept with Stilpnagel,\nwas the name of the general in charge of France. And her answer was, \u201cMon ceur est a la\nFrance, mais mon con est internationale.\u201d And I thought that was good. My heart\nbelongs to France, but my cunt is international. [Laughs]",
        "A: That is sort of a woman who... she would have... So, she slept with a general occupying\nthe... She would have slept with an American general if he had been more than that\nrubber tire . She would have been better than many. [Laughing]",
        "A: [Sighs]",
        "A: No, but who cares about the physical when you are 21? It was...",
        "A: By now \u00b040, 23.",
        "A: And I don\u2019t accept the, the, the couvre-feu was still at midnight. They kept, they kept you\nout of the streets at night. The streets were dangerous. But your dates \u2014 my dates always\ntook me home. I remember, my mother was waiting on the balcony, so they all knew that;\nthey stopped at the corner of the street, because my mother was going to pounce on them.\n[Laughs] It was fun. Yeah, I didn\u2019t...We didn\u2019t think in those terms. We didn\u2019t think in\nterms of \u2014 it\u2019s now that we\u2019re thinking in those terrible terms. We just lived with it and\nwere swallowed by it. The same way when I look at the Martin Luther King thing, this is\nhistory at the time. You live through it; we didn\u2019t make such a point of saying, \u201cThis is\nthe march of the...this is the year where we are beginning to end this sort of racial...\u201d\nYou don\u2019t think in those terms.",
        "A: Then the Battle of the Bulge comes in. Then we party. What happens... but what was\nvery interesting is that you never stopped the partying. What happened is that it was\neverybody brings, so everybody brought something. And if you didn\u2019t have much, you\ndidn\u2019t have much. You had the party and you had the dancing, you had the music, you\nhad the youth. And then you walked home. It\u2019s walkable, again. You can you go to a\nparty practically \u2014 and also the people, you know, are all in the same milieu, so they\nlive... I can circumscribe Paris. Somebody, oh, Mendes-France is having a boulevard\nnamed after him in the 13\". I don\u2019t even know where is the 13\" in the city. I never set\nfoot in the place. The 4\" arrondissement is where the Marais is; that one there, never\nagain. I know 14\", the 15\", the 16\", the 17\" is wealthy but I never go, the 18\" is\nMontmartre, I never set foot in it, and the 19\" is where the young live now but it\u2019s awful.\nThe 20\" and 21\u00b0, never heard of it.",
        "A: And again, the Opera, I mean, it 1s small and you can see that you really, when you think\nof it, you go to Tuileries Garden, it\u2019s the same, very circumscribe arrondissement. I\u2019m not\na specialist in Paris.",
        "A: Sure, everybody partied.",
        "A: It was, oh no, no, no, no, no, I\u2019m talking about the 20-year-olds. No, because, then you\nhad to go... Then, you had to walk home... You have to walk home, because it\u2019s really\npitch dark. There\u2019s the blackout, and the blackout means that you see nothing in the\nstreet. And you don\u2019t have any electric light or anything.",
        "A: So, you tripped.",
        "A: Yes, it\u2019s, it\u2019s for, it\u2019s for the young. You don\u2019t find anybody past their 40\u2019s.",
        "A: Because of my mother, yes.",
        "A: That was lifted, she was safe, I mean, we all...",
        "A: No. That\u2019s a huge change.",
        "A: Oh, sure!",
        "A: You know, lived all through their lives together.",
        "A: Well, I could \u2014 I always did go out and party, except now the worry is lifted. But I never\nwas that much of a worrier. My brother was more the worrier than I.",
        "A: No, he settled in Normandy. He wanted... I wanted to be a small fish in a big town; he\nliked to be a huge fish 1n a very small town. So he settled in the provinces where I would\nnever set foot.",
        "A: Yeah. They bought a big estate and settled and bought a big mansion and settled private\nhospital.",
        "A: Well, he wasn\u2019t married then. That was \u201940. That was...",
        "A: That was the coming... the moving in of the army. He married in \u201942, \u201943...",
        "A: Oh, yeah.",
        "A: And he had children during the war. Since they were playing with us at the liberation.",
        "A: He came back [laughs]... I remember, when it is over, him coming back. He had had \u2014 I\nsaw it somewhere in an article recently \u2014 he had had one towel for the whole time when\nhe was out, so he used the same towel. It was so dirty, it was stiff! He brought it back!\nThat\u2019s what I remember of his return. But he returned in maybe \u00b042, \u201943.",
        "A: Oh, yes, since he was, he was a doctor, so he was safe.",
        "A: He was again...what do you call that? A horse? A running horse... He was intern, you\nknow. To be intern in medicine is more than to be an extern, or to be just a plain doctor.\nHe was really competitive and very good at, at his job, so he was completely safe. He was\nnamed Michel Denier and he...",
        "A: He didn\u2019t, no.",
        "A: No, but he had been with the, the... He had been a scout and that was with the\nProtestants. And the Protestants, the moment they tried to touch him, they pounced back\nand said, \u201cNot at all, he has been a scout since he was the age of nine, don\u2019t touch him\u201d.",
        "A: So, he was protected by the Protestants and I was protected by the Catholics.",

But they were \u201cneutral\u201d during the war, but at least\nthey offered the hospitals. They had fantastically modern hospitals, 1n particular in\nDavos, that you see now on the T.V., which is a ski resort, agreed, but it had best\ntubercular hospitals in Europe. And so they accepted... the stretcher cases were sent from\nthe camp to Switzerland. And I was sent to Switzerland to take the... to wait until they\nwere no longer stretcher cases and then transport them back to Paris.",
        "A: That was after the... \u00b045.",

        "A: \"45.",
        "A: Yes, six months. I was working in Geneva and then Saint Martin (ph) and then Davos.",
        "A: I was what you call a social worker. My job was as vague as the job of a social worker,\nwhich infuriates my daughter, who\u2019s an active lawyer. I was a social worker, so I\u2019d\nwould vi-... visit them, cheer them up...take them out, make them walk, and... visit with\nthem. I was with them when they died and I encouraged them to go out, walk and get\nback into life.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: At that time, they were all French citizens. They were \u2014 no, excuse me, there were a few\nother nationalities, but almost all of them were French. And some of them had\ntuberculosis and some of them were completely emaciated. I probably fell in love with\none. It was absolutely glorious. Switzerland can be glorious. I didn\u2019t like them. They\nwould, they would say... what did they say? They had such a terrible sentence. \u201cOne of\nyour... one of your deportees...\u201d\u201d Oh, what happened is that they stole. They came back\nfrom the camp and they had been hungry, and they were in the land of plenty and you\nwould put a marvelous table and they stole from each other. And it was almost instinctive\nand they did. And the Swiss, I remember them saying to me, \u201cOne of you deportees has\nstolen again.\u201d And it really hurt me because it was a complete misunderstanding of who\nthey were. They were like animals; they had been hungry for so long that they couldn\u2019t\nresist. You had to have the understanding that the Swiss didn\u2019t. But they had the food.\nAnd the fresh air. So that they got better. And they had very good hospitals, very good\nhospitals, and the hospital care was great. And my job was to be, you know, to come in\nthe room and be fresh and available. And some to them would die and I would call the\nfamily and be there when they died and comfort the family and be present at the funeral.\nThe presence was enormous for them at the time, a friendly presence.",
        "A: Hmm\u2019?",
        "A: No, they were sent to different...",
        "A: I was the one sent to Switzerland.",
        "A: I... euh...he died very recently. I kept in touch. I became very friendly to his wife. He\nwas a marvelous fellow. He was not a Jewish deportee, he was a political deportee. And\nhe wasn\u2019t from Auschwitz; he was from Mauthausen, which was second worst. Those\nwere death camps.",
        "A: In Switzerland? [Shakes head]",
        "A: And dealing with them, seeing the way they look and seeing them die. The amplitude of\nit was there because they had suffered it. But I had volunteered to be taking care of\nchildren survivors and that\u2019s because there were no children survivors that I had been\nsent as a sort of compensation to take care of other people who had survived.

        "A: It was... in December \u00b045 that I met John for... It was at the end of... It was after my\nreturn.",
        "A: Mm-hmm.",
        "A: Right off, as well. But then the other one was in my life, and they met in the subway. I\nremember, they didn\u2019t like each other at all.",
        "A: Yes, the deportee...",
        "A: They didn\u2019t like it. I still remember the meeting. They met in the subway, they greeted\neach other. But there was no...",
        "A: No, no.",
        "A: The other guy lasted in my life a long time.",
        "A: In my life, I mean, not in actuality, but in flirting. Because he had been a real hero and\nthat he had a halo that John didn\u2019t have. John spending one night on the beaches, it was\nenough for him, you know, he absolutely loathes discomfort. I don\u2019t think he was ever\nwithout a real breakfast once in his life. But he still will talk about that night on the sand.\nAnd I told you that he would, he would burn a tree and he\u2019d burn the furniture to be\nwarm. No, he was no great hero. But one reason I married John was that he was a strong\ncharacter. He came from Tulsa and he was a conscientious objector. And in... He had\none of his closest friends, I mentioned to you, that Mauricio Freidman, who was a genius,\na Jew, was also a conscientious objector, but he was for religious reasons and John was\nfor philosophical reasons. And in Tulsa, they said, \u201cPhilosophical reasons, five years of\nhard labor.\u201d So you went to the, the prison where the assassin is, wherever, a prison in\nOklahoma, which is the pits. And he spent one year there. And he got to the library and\nhe started organizing the coming of the books to read. He thought he would cover a lot of\nreading in five years. And then he was pardoned, and in one day, he was shipped\noverseas. So, that\u2019s the way, you know. But then he had, he had done something with his\nlife. And he is quite a character.",
        "A: Because they pardoned him. They first condemned him for hard labor, and then, after a\nyear, or whoever was the President pardoned him, they got him; the same day, he was\nshipped overseas to England and then from England to France.",
        "A: Well he, he was. He was and I told you the way he understood the suffering of my\nmother.",
        "A: And he would hide, he would hide rations. You know, we had those beautiful curtains,\nsilk curtains. And after John had gone out, we would look and there were those sardine\nboxes, hidden beneath the folds of the country curtains. He was generous and he had a\nfeeling for, for suffering, and he had never seen or done anything himself. Except once,\nwe went wherever it was, we went where they have the most... in San Francisco they\nhave a terrible prison. What was the name of it?",
        "A: Alcatraz. We went to Alcatraz. We went with a group of judges and John was a top\nlawyer, and we were there with the judges. And we were in a cell in Alcatraz. And they\nput you in the cell individually and then they lock, to give you the feel of what it means\nto be a prisoner in Alcatraz. And John said to me in passing, \u201cI\u2019m the only one in the\ncrowd who knows what it is to be in a real prison with a locked door.\u201d For he had spent\none year in it.",
        "A: Do you call that a big heart? I don\u2019t, I don\u2019t know. He\u2019s a liberal at heart. Anything that\nsmacks of... imposing your will on you because of the race or anything... He was born a\nliberal, and his family, too. His... our grandparents and his parents just adored each other.\nThey spoke not a word in common and they babbled away, Catholic grandparents. It was\na joke! Well, my grandmother had been raised with some English, so she could speak a\nfew words. How you can go with people just on feelings without any vocabulary is\namazing, gestures.",
        "A: Very little, very little. I was heavily dating elsewhere, and it was absolutely spat at to date\nsomebody in uniform in Paris. We were... We\u2019d go to a theater together; we received\ninsults when we would come down the aisle. Really, insults. Because I was dating a\nsoldier. You just did not date the conquering soldier. It was spat upon by the French.",
        "A: Oh, the French never liked to be... It is not easy to be liberated by somebody that you do\nnot respect intellectually, and also someone so new. To this day I\u2019m getting the articles\nabout how, the same thing, they think we are young and innocent in a bad sense of the\nword. So, they were very... antagonistic. So, when we would go out outside, it was\ncourage to go out with a then-American soldier because you did get passing insults.",
        "A: Well, of course, and I... He was liberating us.",
        "A: He proposed to me very quickly, if you count... He stayed three weeks in France and\nthen they were shipped back to the States. That had been from... He was gone by the\ntime of 27\" of January; he left around middle January. So, if you count the time where I\nam very busy dating, it\u2019s December to the third week of January. And then he said he was\ninterested. And then, again, we hadn\u2019t touched each other; we hadn\u2019t even kissed on the\ncheek. He had sat by my bed and we had discoursed for a long time in the evening, and\nwhat happened and what is what I deeply believe in \u2014 I don\u2019t know that my children do,\nbut, but that\u2019s their lives \u2014 I believe that to marry somebody you have to have the same\npolitical opinions, if not religious opinions. We were both at ease, and both left \u2014 not too\nfar left, but for the poor. Okay? You have two things in common, you have it made. With\nToulet (ph), he was Catholic, practicing Catholic and far right. As we said to each other,\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need to go out for election, we stay home\u201d and we would cancel each other.\nWe cannot marry and make it, and make a 60-year commitment, as I with John, with\nsomebody who destroys your vote when you go to the voting booth. So that counted a lot.\nWe were really very close, so I said, \u201cNo, I am not going to touch, marriage-wise,\nanybody in uniform.\u201d I had seen the French uniform, the English uniform, the German\nuniform, the American uniform. \u201cYou go back home and come back dressed properly.\u201d\nSo, he went back to wherever it was in the States, got demobilized, got into his uniform\nand then he came back. Then he came back and he rang the bell. And my mother, who\nhad cried \u2014 Oh, he sent to me from... He came back by boat; at the time we didn\u2019t have\nthe planes \u2014 So, he sent me a telegram and said, \u201cReserve the 14\"\". Signed, the Huron\u201d\nwhich 1s the critical term that Voltaire has for guys from the Pampa. And he came back...\nOh, do my dates make sense? He left in December, we wrote to each other, he came back\non the 13\" of July and the 13\" in the evening we were then engaged.",
        "A: No, no.",
        "A: He comes... he came back...",
        "A: Six months later it took him time to get...",
        "A: Not only out of uniform, to get a job. So, he got a job at the same hotel where they... that\nhad been occupied with the Germans, was then occupied by the Americans and he got a\njob as an assistant to the Brigadier General, whatever, in charge of American things in\nParis. And then he had a job and then the day he was back, we had got engaged. I never\nbelieved in waiting. As I said, there is an element of luck, and also, don\u2019t let it pass by \u2014\ngrab it. So we did. And the 13\" or the 14\" we were engaged. And when we were married,\nthe French did not like at all officially the idea that a French woman would marry an\nAmerican, not done. So they had us wait and the first date we could get was in\nSeptember, so we were married in September \u00b045.",
        "A: Is it?",
        "A: I knew the essential.",
        "A: Okay, you had the physical attraction. I found him handsome... He was making himself\navailable. He was very interested. And we had the same opinion: no God. And the same\ndemocratic of the left political view and what there is to, so jump in.",
        "A: And also, also very kind, yes.",
        "A: Oh, my mother when he called back, no she was de-...devastated at the idea that he was\nan American. It\u2019s 3,000 or 6,000 miles away, her daughter, her only daughter. She had\nlived with us, you know. We were extremely close. So, when he called, she had opened \u2014\nshe was completely without decency of fear. She had opened the telegram and I had read\nit right around, so obviously she knew he was coming back. But when he called to ask for\nthe appointment, she said, \u201cOh, what a surprise!\u201d\u201d And he laughed because he knew she\nwas laughing... er, she was lying. But she knew I was going to be happy and it was nice,\nit was important for her. She had had such a terrible... Oh, at first she would say, \u201cOh,\u201d\nshe would say, \u201cit\u2019s only one month.\u201d Then she would say, \u201cOh, it\u2019s only three months.\u201d\nThen after that she stopped saying, \u201cIt\u2019s only...\u201d She knew it was going to work out. And\nthen she became very fond of him, yes. And when she died... she wanted him to, I mean,\nlater on in life when she wasn\u2019t feeling well at all, she was as much interested in having\nhim come back to see her as she was in me coming.",
        "A: Yeah, he was a good \u2014 and he still is \u2014 a good fellow, yeah. It\u2019s not easy to live 60 years\ntogether. Mostly tail years, tail end years.",
        "A: The tail end years.",

        "A: I... Don\u2019t ask me, because sometimes it\u2019s English and sometimes it\u2019s French. He would\nsay that it is more French because it flatters him. But I think it\u2019s mostly English.",
        "A: Not a word.",
        "A: No, but I read fluently. With my background... The French background of school,\nschooling was very bizarre. You studied language but not a word of spoken language, all\nliterature. So I knew the grammar. I knew the literature very well. And I remember that I\nexpressed myself with a great difficulty. I practically didn\u2019t speak a word of English. But\nwhen you have the grammar the vocabulary and what else? And it comes. Three months\nin the country and you speak fluently.",
        "A: Then he spoke French.",
        "A: Yeah, I mean he has... as our children say, \u201cBoth our parents have an accent.\u201d I have an\naccent and he has an accent in French. They don\u2019t; they are fluent.",

        "A: No, no, no, no, no. We sometimes lived with her at first, but as soon as we could, we got\nour own apartment.",
        "A: My mother?",
        "A: During... She was still living in the old apartment. During the time when we lived in\nBoulevard St-Michel she was visiting us for dinner or... but keeping us... I mean, we\nwere very private; we didn\u2019t live with her.",
        "A: Up \u2018til 12 years of age, then at Vaugirard and that\u2019s where I was caught by the Germans\nwith my mother.",
        "A: Mm-hmm. Yes, and then we came back in \u00b048.",
        "A: I guess! We were living in Boulevard St-Michel, we had a maid, I had all my friends.\nYes, it was great. It was difficult to let go...",
        "A: Yeah, it was a great sacrifice. Mostly, when you consider my culture, my background,\nthat was huge. But you don\u2019t realize it until afterwards. I don\u2019t think anybody would do it\nnow. Not with my background. I offered for him to stay there and work there and find a\njob, but he didn\u2019t want to.",
        "A: No, he should have, but that\u2019s after the fact.",
        "A: He had no studies finished. I had earned my degree already, I was already teaching. He\nwas just a student studying at University of Chicago. He had... He wanted to enter law\nschool and he wanted to go to Chicago Law School. So, happily, I have enough degrees\nand good records that immediately I kept , SO I went with him.",
        "A: But Chicago, I tell you, when we are in Chicago, he had made a mistake and he drove\nthrough a slum area, and to come from Paris and think you are going to live your life... It\nwas a mistake, but it was still overwhelming.",
        "A: No, it was a mistake. He took the wrong turn. We lived by the university, which isn\u2019t\nthat...",
        "A: ... glorious.",
        "A: But at least it was an apartment, you know, a graduate student apartment, which was\ndecent. Although the neighborhood isn\u2019t very great. But it\u2019s mostly nowadays. It was all\nright back then. But those slums--from Chicago, I don\u2019t know if you know them. They\nare, they are worse than Harlem by a long...\nEnd of Tape #7\nTape #8",
        "A: Of course, she must have been. But she was enough of a good mother to realize that by\nthat time, we had been deeply married, and we were really kicking, so that was more\nmeaningful for her. Also, his mother came to visit, and although again there was a\ncomplete barrier of language, they liked each other, and she liked how, you know,\nlearned and sedate the mother was. Sort of give her the idea of the stability that she\nabsolutely had not had in her love life.",
        "A: Oh, no she would not.",
        "A: She would not interfere.",
        "A: And it\u2019s extraordinary because she was completely... she didn\u2019t know the word of\ndiscretion. You know, when, when we lived together, there was that master bedroom that\nwas the end of a long hall \u2014 they are specialist of long halls. That\u2019s the only places where\nthey put theirs clothes is in the long halls. And then, then the bath, she would barge in\nany time, never thought of it. Don\u2019t forget, she had been without a man for all her life.\nShe did not know what married life meant. Or, either she was nosy, or she was very\nindiscreet. Both of them, true.",

        "A: I have to. John was in charge \u2014 we shared always, to this day, we do share \u2014 so, at the\ntime, he was 1n charge of the dishes and I was in charge of the cooking. And now, I\u2019m\ntrying to make him in charge of the cooking. \u2018Cause I think it\u2019s, I think it\u2019s more\nconstructive for old age. It\u2019s more stimulating for him. I take over the cleaning up and the\ndishes, which is not much fun.",
        "A: Where, in Chicago?",
        "A: Probably. I didn\u2019t make a huge point of it but I have \u2014 I have pictures \u2014 I might send you\none, where it is obviously he in the kitchen and not I.",

So to this day, we\nhave friends and I cook. And all the friends know that I am a good cook, so it\u2019s a pleasure\nto come. Good conversation and good food, so...",
        "A: It\u2019s all right.",
        "A: It was the field I was the least proficient in. And when I came here I was so proficient in\nFrench and in Latin that it would have been ridiculous for me to... And I am glad\nbecause it\u2019s a one-on-one \u2014 at that level, it\u2019s a one-on-one relationship for the PhD. So, it\nwould have been devastating to have a relationship \u2014 and they were... I didn\u2019t like them\nvery much. And they... the little bit of the relationship I had, they already were very\nresentful that I was so superior. I mean, you think of it, I had had fourteen years of Greek\nby the time I reached Chicago.",
        "A: Fourteen, because you start in guatorzi\u00e9me, quinzi\u00e9me, seizi\u00e9me, philosophie and then I\nwent through all the competitive...",
        "A: Yes, and the teachers also.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t get along at all well. You know, I had to have special \u2014 for a PhD, you have to\nhave, whatever you call it, in each field. You have to have an exam and the French person\ndidn\u2019t like it, didn\u2019t like me, I felt. It was very difficult to teach me. What is he going to\nteach me? I remember, I showed some authors and he... he wasn\u2019t interested in them. I\nwasn\u2019t the run-of-the-mill student that he was expecting. But \u2014 and those were the rough\nyears. The weather was... Talk about yesterday, you know. That plus was the day in and\nday out.",
        "A: Oh, biting cold and we, we had to cross the Midway. And I told you, that\u2019s one thing I\ndon\u2019t like is cold. And you could not escape it without a car in Chicago.",
        "A: Paris, [laughs] when they say they have a cold wave, it\u2019s a joke. I told you, there is one\ninch of snow and the Luxembourg will close its gates. And they take pictures of all the\nmuseums with the little statue with a crummy little inch on the shoulders of the statue and\nthey have a snowstorm. No, so even in the depth of it, Paris is livable. Chicago was, was\nreally biting cold.",
        "A: I was, we were isolated. We were very self-sufficient and busy studying and I have\npictures in that student apartment where I with my great dictionaries and John with his\nlaw studies. We were happy and self-sufficient. I, I don\u2019t... I had some...they had some\nwar... He had a G.I. Bill. We lived on that G.I. Bill. And he had some friends in law\nschool who lived in war... it was sort of huts in the middle of Midway. And we thought it\nwas paradise that they had a place. You know, we, we had not really, in the States, a real\napartment of our own. But it never was a problem for me not having much to live on, as\nlong as I had the books and studies and John.",
        "A: I never finished it. By that time, I was closing in and starting having to write a thesis\nsince I passed all the exams, and I had to pass one in French, which I remember \u2018cause\nJohn said it was a big joke \u2018cause it took me a long time. He didn\u2019t realize it was a test on\nmy English, not just my French. Dr. Smith took off and I was left in the lurch, and at that\npoint, I said, \u201cLook, who needs it? I have a certificate of proficiency in all the fields...\u201d\neven in German \u2014 that\u2019s when I studied German. And if I had time, that\u2019s what I would\nstudy. I\u2019m fascinated by deepening the German language. I had to study German for the\nPhD in Greek because many of the learned books on Ancient Greeks are in German. So, I\npassed the German proficiency exam; it was a written exam not a spoken one. Oh, I\nremember going to a course and there was a guy teaching the course. And I was\ndistraught at the idea of coming from the war, having to study German, and he began to\nsay something in German to the class and I utterly disliked it. And he sensed it and he\ncalled me after class and he said, \u201cDon\u2019t you feel that way. I am a Jew. So, you don\u2019t\nhave to be so frightened of me.\u201d But I was delighted that I had only to write, to know\nhow to read. And I love the literature. And I love the literature... I have to find those\nbooks. Anybody that can find those books for me is my love. There was a series of books,\nnine in number, which are extremely well done by cognates. You, you have to realize that\n75 percent of all of the languages have common Greek and Latin roots. So, you start with\nthe literature; it\u2019s all written in German. And you read the nine little books and at the end,\nyou are reading German.",
        "A: And there is no grammar at all; nine little books and no grammar. You have the same in\nFrench. I think I have the French series. And it\u2019s a very clever way of doing it \u2018cause you\nget yourself into it without noticing it. Then you'll be able to read it. So I read it.",
        "A: No, no replacement. She was taking a break, but it was really not a moral thing to do. She\nshouldn\u2019t have in the middle of the year then that...",
        "A: [Laughs] Well, that\u2019s probably why she took the pretext that there wasn\u2019t much for her to\nstay. So, I didn\u2019t miss it, you know; I always went by without... All \u2014 It\u2019s called All But\nthe Thesis...",
        "A: A.B.D., whatever.",
        "A: I always found a jobs and we moved with my jobs.",
        "A: So I wrote and found and we moved wherever I found. And I wrote to the University of\nMaryland and hop! they jumped at me. So I began teaching at Maryland and we came to\nthe area, and that\u2019s the way we started.",
        "A: Not at Maryland. I don\u2019t know if I dare say that. The \u2014 their student body was very poor.\nAnd the faculty wasn\u2019t much higher. Johns Hopkins was \u2014 I taught at Johns Hopkins\nSchool of Advanced Studies \u2014 that was interesting \u2014 on Massachusetts Avenue. American\nU. wasn\u2019t very interesting either; the teachers were better but the students were still very\nmediocre. There isn\u2019t really... It is not really an area of great universities. It\u2019s not very\nstimulating. But, by that time, I was teaching also in the daytime. Those were only\nevening jobs, I told you, because by that time we supported both my mother and aunt in\ntheir retirement. Their retirement from government was very pitiful so we supplemented\nit. And I was teaching during the daytime at Mount Vernon College and I \u2014 The Greek\ndied, the Latin died, the French at that time began to die off. And they said, \u201cWhat are we\ngoing to do with you?\u201d I said, \u201cThere is one thing you don\u2019t have.\u201d It was \u00b063. \u201cIt\u2019s a\nprogram of Continuing Education.\u201d And I opened in the area the first program of\nContinuing Education for \u2014 I called that for women and men. And now the whole college\nis living out of its programs for women. But it, there was no program for women at the\ntime.",
        "A: Because I was going to lose my job. \u201cHow did you come to that?\u201d [Laughs]",
        "A: That is a very good incentive. I still have the first program. I made it, pasted it by hand.\nAnd I was very imaginative. I started, I had started with non-credit courses and I had the\nmost imaginative program in the city. I had a friend of John, and he was a builder, you\nknow, he had built his own house. So, I had a course. And I had another one, he was very\ngood with tinkering with car, a course in auto-mechanics. I had a course in home repairs\nat the time when, on Foxhall Road, you had, you had people flocking for the home repair.\nAnd people flocking for the car repair course. And I had, you know, the bet-... and I paid\nthem very highly as I had been highly paid in France and they enjoyed it. It became\nhumongously successful.",
        "A: It was a clever idea and I enjoyed it and they enjoyed it.",
        "A: I placed them. I missed, I missed the summer months in both cases. I was a teacher, so\nthree months, that was perfect. Missed both cases and I hit on Christmas. So, I had two\nChristmas vacations and I had Silvia. My daughter was born on the 21*' of December, and\nI went back to school on the fourth. I never missed a beat. I went to the hospital \u2014 I was\nSO pregnant you could have pushed me I would have rolled down the hill \u2014 and I had her\nwithout pain. I mean, the children were the least problem of my life. And when I had\nOlivier, the first one, 1n Paris, I was in the delivery room and John was outside and he\nheard the baby cry, and he stopped the nurse and said, \u201cThat was, there, there, what\u2019s\nthat?\u201d and she said, \u201cYou must be teasing me. She\u2019s been there for 15 minutes.\u201d He said,\n\u201cWas there, is there another baby there?\u201d She said, \u201cNo, I checked and it was...\u201d Fifteen\nminutes for one and no pain for the other. I had lost the first one. The first one of them all\nwas... lost at birth. It was an abnormal child, and it was devastating. That was \u201947,\ndevastating to have an abnormal child. It couldn\u2019t be... it couldn\u2019t be salvaged. It was a\nspina bifida. And they said now that the war deprivation, finally it got to me. It was a\nlack of certain nutrients in my body, that I could not produce a child with a growth spine.",
        "A: That was difficult, but...",
        "A: But we didn\u2019t miss a beat after that. I waited because we had study years, and I couldn\u2019t \u2014\nI had to wait for five years \u2014 but then we did it after that.",
        "A: Second, for the second.",
        "A: And no pain for Silvia. They would put in my room the other women to, to see what it\nwas like to have a child without... thinking it was anything.",
        "A: I had a maid, a black woman who was devotion... I had checked among my friends. And\nI checked and we once visited a friend. She had a nursemaid, an old maid that took care\nof the children, and when the maid left, the children had a tantrum and wanted to go with\nthe maid. I said, [kisses her finger] \u201cThis is the one for me.\u201d\u2019 Never mind the degree of\nwhatever the... That\u2019s the recommendation and I had that one and she... we lived I don\u2019t\nknow where and at 7:30, I left the children knowing the she would be there.",
        "A: And she was there until... I have pictures of her with Silvia. She was there for years, and\nI had my mother-in-law living with us. But she never lifted a finger, so it was Annie Mae\nwho took care of the children.\nbackground is \u2014 do you say you\u2019re Catholic, do you say you\u2019re Jewish, or do you say\nyou\u2019re nothing?",
        "A: I say nothing.",
        "A: Because it\u2019s truly, it is nothing. I cannot claim anything else. I would lie to say I was\nraised a Catholic because I really... It was built on a false paper that I got when I was 21.\nAnd Jewish, I... If you asked me where is a synagogue in Paris, I have no idea and no\ncuriosity. But if my children had married a Jew, I would have been perfectly satisfied. I\ndon\u2019t even know what they married. They married somebody who claims to be a Catholic\nbut... And the other one married somebody interesting in that his father \u2014 she, she delved\ninto pastor\u2019s sons, she loved pastor\u2019s sons, I don\u2019t know why. She married the son of a\npastor and her mother-in-law, the wife of a pastor, never set foot in the church, not even\nfor the baptism of the children did she set foot in the church.",
        "A: But I never ask what she believes or not but her husband is a pastor. A delight, a very\nnice guy. My son 1s divorced, but I remain friendly with his ex, who\u2019s the mother of my\ngrandchildren. Also, I have an extremely bizarre trait, once I have loved somebody, I\ncan\u2019t stop. I mean, you cannot pull the plug and say, \u201cI am going to the next chapter of\nmy life. You drop this one, and I\u2019m going to be in love with...\u201d",
        "A: I have many people that I have loved for a long time and I hold on to them \u2014 not in a\npossessive way, because it\u2019s so far away \u2014 but they are still meaningful. I am not a person\nwith different chapters and close doors. I don\u2019t close doors.",
        "A: Hmm\u2019?",
        "A: No, remember, my mother...",
        "A: Yeah, my father\u2019s family... He left... I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s probably genetic, but I have no\nidea where it comes from.",
        "A: I tried to meet... It\u2019s a big loss in my life. At the end of the war, in \u201947, you had the right\nto ask the Red Cross about anybody around the world, and they would contact that person\nand give you news and I asked about Pierre Denier. I hadn\u2019t heard about him since...\u201940.\nI know in \u00b040, I was 18; when I was 18, he married somebody my age. And he must have\nbeen an interesting character and I wanted to see him. And I was told that he was dead.\nAnd that was a big shock, I remember. And they said he died of lung cancer. And I had\nnever, never even heard talk, anybody talk about the fellow, so I asked my mother,\n\u201cPierre Denier\u201d \u2014 I never called him father, I always called him Pierre Denier if I\nmentioned him to anybody \u2014 \u201cPierre Denier, was he a smoker?\u201d She said, \u201cThree packs a\nday,\u201d but I knew nothing about him.",
        "A: Hmm\u2019?",
        "A: You mean Jeannette?",
        "A: It\u2019s interesting. It\u2019s interesting because I was very interested in what he was like. And if\nyou follow... If I follow the schedule, he married \u2014 he had many mistresses and then he\nmarried Jeannette\u2019s mother, who is a delight, loved me, I mean, we wrote the letters and\nit was very funny. And Jeannette said that Pierre Denier died when she was 10 months\nold. And so we had one picture of Pierre Denier with Michelle as a baby on his shoulder,\nbut he was at a casino \u2014 it was because of the game and the women that he was there.\nAnd she made the comment \u2014 you asked the question \u2014 she made the comment, \u201cDo you\nrealize that, out of the three of us, Michelle is the only one who had had her picture with\nher father?\u201d He really is a character.",
        "A: But if you go to... if you go to, to Resistencia in Argentina there is a\nmuseum named after him, he became a big scientist. He suddenly blossomed when he\nwas there. And it\u2019s funny because I knew several divorced men who ended up in\nArgentina it was the wild pampa.",
        "A: Maybe that, I mean, many people took refuge in the last frontier, and it is an\nextraordinary and huge country. He felt free, maybe.",
        "A: That there is some effect?",
        "A: You know what came to my mind? What came to my mind is that it probably enriched\nmy life. To have thrown at you so many experiences that call for a reaction, it gets things\nout of you that probably would remain dormant and unused if not for the catastrophe.\nDoes it make any sense?",
        "A: [Shakes head] No, I think I am talked out.",
        "A: I hope you get something out of it.\n[Picture of Nicole as a young woman is shown]",
        "A: This is a picture of Nicole looking out of the window. I was 11 or 12 years old. My hair\nlooks very nice but it\u2019s a fake. I pretended that my hair was naturally curly; it wasn\u2019t. The\nmaid rolled it up with an iron, a curling iron every morning in the kitchen and that\u2019s why\nit is this way.\n[Another picture of Nicole is shown]",
        "A: This one I cannot date. I must have been 22 or 23. It\u2019s taken in a studio.
