        "Wentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/9/95 Int. IRVING HEYMONT\nPage l\nIrving Heymont interview 2/9/95\nSWB: Okay the first thing that I'd like you to tell me\nabout is the experience in liberating a camp.\nIRVING HEYMONT: Actually, I personally had very little to\ndo with liberating camps. Now first let me say, I don't\nknow of anybody who liberated a camp. We overran camps. My\nregiment overran a sub-camp of Mauthausen called\nGunskierken, in Austria. We overran it because the adjacent\nregiment failed to keep abreast, and we were ordered to\nextend our area. And it was K company, the fifth infantry\nregiment, that overran Gunskierken. I visited Gunskierken\nwithin a few hours after we had overran and got the report.\nI spend 15 minutes there at the most, and then had to go on\nwith the rest of my duties. I recall seeing the emaciated\npeople, and about, later I learned that we figured it was\nabout 2000 dead, and above all you can never forget the\nodor. I had nothing with me, but I did offer someone some\nCigarettes, which was all I had. I was told later, I didn't\nsee it myself, that some of the people who were given\nCigarettes, tended to start to eat them. At that time, I\nwas a regimental operations officer and had to continue on.\nSWB: Did the people react to you at all there?",
        "IRVING HEYMONT: I'm really no judge. I was under so qu- so\nshort a time, that I'm- anything I say would really be any\nwitness at all. My reg- my division did put out a pamphlet\ndescribing in greater detail what was found and had\nphotographs in it.\nSWB: You gave someone a pack of cigarettes, do you remember\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/9/95 Int. IRVING HEYMONT\nPage 2\nanything about his reaction to that.\nIRVING HEYMONT: Not really. I remember he was\u2019 severely\nemaciated. He wore what looked like the striped uniform,\nand incidentally, may I add a note about that. A few days\nearlier, we ran into, about two or three, no it was two men,\nin striped uniforms. Dazed, glazed look in their eyes,\nwandering down the road. My regimental commander turned to\nme and said, Hey Irv, we better round up these prisoners and\nSlap them back into jail. We had no idea what they\nrepresented at the time. At no time was, were we ever told,\nout yonder there's a concentration camp, try to get there.\nPrisoner of war camps, yes. Uh, I conducted a very",
        "unscientific, completely statistically poor survey, and I\nhave yet to find an American soldier, who was at division\nlevel or lower who wo- could claim that, they knew where a\nconcentration camp was and they were told to get it. We\nstumbled on them. I'm sorry to say it, but that's the best\nas I recollect, and I haven't forgotten much about that.\nSWB: Now can you describe when and how it was you came _ to\nbe sent to Landsberg and what Landsberg was.\nIRVING HEYMONT: My regimental commander and I were ordered\nto Paris to testify at a board proceeding, and then\nauthorized to take leave. This was early September 1945.\nAt this time I was, I had been uh, had a new assignment, I\nwas commanding the second battalion of the fifth infantry\nregiment, 71st division. When I arrived back, to make a\nlong story short, I found that in my absence, my battalion\nhad been moved to Landsberg, and I arrived there in the\nmiddle of the night, or I should say early hours of the\nmorning. The next morning, my first attempt was to find out\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/9/95 Int. IRVING HEYMONT\nPage 3",
        "where all the elements of the battalion were and what had\nhappened. When I left, the battalion was in Augsberg, and\nnow we're in Landsberg. And uh, shortly after breakfast,\nuh, General Ralph, Anslau Ralph, the assistant division\ncommander arrived, and told me about this DP camp. And uh,\nhe said let's go look. And off we went. And there I first\nfound out what it was like. What, what it was. And it was a\nShock. Shall I continue? The camp was in the German\nKacerne. The kacerne is a German military post, a peacetime\nstation. It was called the Sauerboer kacerne, last occupied\nby some German artillery unit. The camp, I was told, was\nabout 80 percent, the other 20 percent a mixture of\nprimarily people from Baltic countries, and a small number\nof Poles. The camp, I was told, we took over exactly as it\nhad been, with a unit of the 80th division that we had\nrelieved. To my utter consternation, I found there were\nAmerican soldiers on guard at the entrance, the purpose to\nkeep people in the camp from going out. Unless they had a\npass. The camp walls were surrounded, was topped with\nbarbed wire. People are milling around, seemingly aimless,\nthe streets were littered with the debris of the German\nartillery units, the camp itself was filthy beyond\ndescription. The room, the halls, the buildings, and these\nwere all pretty modern barrack buildings, reeked of the odor\nof urine, you could see where people had defecated behind\nstairwells. It was one unholy mess. Shall I continue?\nPeople were living in what in the American army terminology,\nwould be squadrons, designed for 20, 30 men. Uh, they had",
        "started, obvious to me, tried to make inhabitable family\nquarters. They did that my hanging blankets, using\ncardboards from large packing cases, some wooden closets to\nwall off little cubicles. And also it was quite obvious\nthat they were all trying to cook, have meals there, they\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/9/95 Int. IRVING HEYMONT\nPage 4\nall had little electric warmers. As I soon found out, the\nuh, everything compounded problems. The uh, cooking over\nthe, in the rooms, and then having to wash dishes in _ the\nsinks, clogged up the toilet, the plumbing system, and a\nlack of toilet paper, the use of newspaper clogged that up\nand it was not designed to hold the number of people who\nwere there. Uh, initially we estimated there were about\n4000 people in the camp. At no time did we ever really know\nthe population. Except it was always overcrowded. And\nthere was always a struggle to get the numbers down So_ we\nwould not have to, as we later on, to force people to move\nto other camps. Uh forcing people to move, a transport, had\nterrific connotations. Yet at the same time, they didn't\nwant to lower it because that determined how many rations\nthey had. At the end I came to the conclusion that during",
        "the period I was there, till the end of 1945, the population\nvaried from four to seven thousand. Uh, I was shocked at\nthe first sight. It was incredible. Should I continue or\nam I boring you.\nSWB:\nIRVING HEYMONT: What was even more incredible were the\norders I got from General Rolf. Uh, he took me to his side\nand said, look. You will not take orders from your\nregimental commander about the camp. You will take orders\ndirect from division through me, which is a rather untenable\nposition. And he said don't worry about your battalion, let\nthem take care of themselves. You worry about this camp.\nYour job is to get this camp cleaned up, without incurring\nany adverse publicity. If you get any adverse pub-publicity\nfor the U.S. Army career goodbye. I was a regular army\nofficer. Uh, needless to say, I was not particularly\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/9/95 Int. IRVING HEYMONT\nPage 5\npleased to have those orders. I recognized a number of\nthings right off. First, of all the problems of the camp,",
        "one of the things would, would be simplified if we only had\none kind of person in the camp. So I requested that all\nnon-Jews be moved elsewhere, and make the camp an all-Jewish\nDP camp. To my great surprise, that was very quickly done.\nIt wasn't until months later that I learned that General\nEisenhower had issued orders that all the Jews should be in\nall-Jewish DP camps. I was rather surprised when I heard\nthat, I, my ego was shattered, I thought I'd had a lot of\ninfluence. The uh, but I was also surprised that no one had\never told me that. Another thing I did, uh, after I,\nforgive me if I ramble...\nSWB: Let's just go back to one thing. Why was it a problem\nto have Jews and non-Jews together, explain this to me, I\ndon't understand.\nIRVING HEYMONT: The, for one thing there was a matter of\nKosher food for some of the Jews. Secondly, there was\nenmity within the group, within the population. The Jews\nconsidered the Baltics, peo- uh the, not really victims of\nthe Holocaust, that many of them had come to Germany volun\ntarily to work. And uh, that they had not suffered the way\nthe Jews had. The Poles were very few. Also, the\nmotivation of the two groups were totally different. And\nuh, I- particularly if the orders were, my orders were not\nto get any adverse, incur any adverse publicity. I felt it\nwould be simpler if I dealt with only one kind of people.\nThe uh, I soon realized that the camp, the Jews had an\ninternal camp organization. Despite their despair, I-I-I'm",
        "rambling now, I find it hard to put it all cohesively. They\nhad done some remarkable things which didn't appear on the\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/9/95 Int. IRVING HEYMONT\nPage 6\nsurface. They had organized a camp committee. A self\ndesignated camp committee, but fairly popularly accepted by\nthe others. And these were a remarkable group of men. They\nhad organized a sort of a camp structure. They had set up a\ncamp hospital.\nSWB: Let's stop, we have to reload...",
        "[CAMERA RELOAD]",
        "[CR#2 ]\nIRVING HEYMONT: It's interesting, for a moment, to tell you\nthe origin of the camp. It was started aS an emergency\nmeans to care, to house and care for the survivors of the\neleven little sub-camps of Dachau that were centered around\nLandsberg Khelfring. These camps had a total population of\nabout 30,000, 99 percent Jews, most of them from Hungary,",
        "some brought in from Auschwitz. It was a crash project to\nbuild two underground factories, to assemble the German jets\nthat had been bombed out of the original plan Augsborg. On\nthat note, it was a work to death camp. Not an\nextermination camp, but a work to death camp. About half of\nthe thirty thousand died, and are buried in a number of\ncemeteries around there. So they used this Kacerne, this\nGerman army post in town, to house them. And they,\npopulation was increased by survivors who drifted in from\nall over the countryside and other camps. The Jews who\nformed about 80 percent of the camp when JI arrived, had\norganized themselves into a city within a city. There was a\nself-designated camp committee consisting of some of the\nmost brilliant men I've ever met. Most of them were Jews\nfrom Baltic countries, from Latvia-Lithuania. And they had\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/9/95 Int. IRVING HEYMONT\nPage 7\norganized a structure, they had a police department of their\nown, internally. And above all, they organized ae school\nsystem. They set up a hospital where they were training\nnurses. The school system was really, the driving force was\na fantastic individual, Dr. Jake Wallaisky, a trained",
        "agronomist who had worked for ORT, the Jewish Organization\nfor Rehabilitation and for Training, in Europe. And he had\npractically set up a people's university. His driving thing\nwas you had to learn how to work to survive when freedom\ncame. The leadership strongly resented being wards of the\nU.S. Army. And uh, they kept after me, wanting to have what\nthey called, uh, responsibility for the camp. And I kept\ntelling them, when they showed me that they couldn't[?] have\nthe camp cleaned up, take care of it, they can have their\nauthority. I wonder what they often thought, here are these\nmen, after what they had been through, many of them had\nresponsible jobs, listening to a 27-year old army officer\ntelling them they can't have responsibility for themselves\nuntil they maintained certain degrees of sanitation. And\nuh, every problem that we had in regard to sanitation, they\nalways came back with a stock answer. Tf at's that\nimportant to you, move us out of Germany, and that will\nsolve your sanitation problem. Of course, nothing I could\ndo. But, in dealing with them, with the camp committee, I\nwas also under a different pressure. General Rolf told me\nthat at the first possible opportunity, I should hold a\ndemocratic election for a new camp committee. The reason\nfor it became obvious to me. The army did not want to be\naccused of setting up people to run the camp and not giving\nthe people of the camp their own choice. Compounded with\nthat, I-I might say r- at this point, I was not the only one\nthere. There was an UNRHA team, and an American joint\ndistribution committee, American joint Jewish distribution",
        "Working transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/9/95 Int. IRVING HEYMONT\nPage 8\ncommittee team, that had arrived about a month before I did.\nAnd they were very helpful. They really did the pick and\nshovel work. And uh, I asked General Rolf, and he send my\nrequest, they rounded up all the Jewish soldiers in the\ndivision who could speak Yiddish or German, to report to be\nattached to my battalion to work in the camp to assist the\nuh, UNRHA and the AJDC team. The head of the UNRHA team was\na very nice chap, but unfortunately he spoke, did not\u2019 sp-,\nwas not Jewish, did not speak German, and couldn't\ncommunicate with the people of the camp. I asked that he be\nreplaced by somebody who could speak German or Yiddish and\npreferably who can commune with the people. They sent a Dr.\nAbraham Glassgold, who was Jewish and had experience, and\nwho was an incredibly wonderful man. He was the right man\nfor the right job. Well anyway, the uh, I figured that I\nhad to get some way to get to the camp people other than\nthrough the camp committee, because I didn't know what they\nwere saying. So I thought, one way to do it, I had _ to\nestablish myself. So I asked them to assemble a meeting of\neveryone in the camp, at which I spoke. And uh, I remember\nthe AJDC team, Rabbi Rosenberg translated for me. And my",
        "pitch was very simple. That you were, who suffered all\nthis, were liberated. You can't die of disease now, a real\nstirring speech. And I ended up by saying, I'm going to\nabolish the American army guards at the gate, they will be\nthere, but not to keep you in, but to keep unauthorized\nGermans out. You're free to go out anytime you want. The\npass system is abolished, and I want you, yourselves, to\ntake down the barbed wire around the camp, hurrah, hurrah,\nhurrah, great joy. What I did not know, until many months\nlater, that General Eisenhower had issued orders that the\npass system, the restriction on Jews, DP's, leaving the camp\nwould cease immediately. No one had ever told me of that.\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/9/95 Int. IRVING HEYMONT\nPage 9\nAnyway...\nSWB: Why hadn't it been done?\nIRVING HEYMONT: You ask why hadn't that been done. I\nCannot answer that question definitively. I can only guess,\nand I can only repeat things that were told to me, and I\ndon't think it's germane right now. The uh, I felt one way",
        "to reach the camp population was for the camp to have a\nnewspaper. But at that time, all newspapers were illegal.\nAnd I knew, I was smart enough not to ask whether I can have\nthe people publish a camp newspaper. If I did that, they\nmight say no. So I spoke to Dr. Glassgold, and I said, why\ndon't you sponsor the newspaper, allegedly. It will be\nunder your auspices. And I told the camp committee they can\nstart a newspaper, I would not censor it, Mr. Craddock would\nnot censor it, but I'm sure they would not give us any\ngrounds to regret that. And they didn't. And they started\nthe Landsberg Zeitung. And immediately they requested of\nme, could I find some Hebrew print for them. Well my\nbattalion supply officer was a very wonderful young man.\nVery full of initiative, meaning he could steal anything in\nSight that he thought we would use. Well he scoured the\ncountryside and found only one set of Hebrew print in\nMunich, and that had been pre-empted by an organization of\nthe uh, organization of the Jewish liberated political\nprisoners. So they published their newspaper in Yiddish,\nbut using Roman characters. So Zeitung came out\nC-A-J-T-U-N-G. How they got it printed, I don't know, I\ndidn't ask, there are a thousand and one things that went on\nin the camp I had no Knowledge and didn't have the time to\nlook into. But it turned out to be a very interesting\npaper. A really, an outstanding paper, with a lot of good\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.",
        "Wentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/9/95 Int. IRVING HEYMONT\nPage 10\nnews, literary things, and was avidly read, and as I was\ntold later, set an example for other Jewish DP camps\u2019 and\nbecame the um leading Jewish DP camp in Germany. They did\nan outstanding job. The uh, they were always after me _ to\nfind things to help them. And uh, I was very much\nintrigued, very much desirous, of helping them in the\nschools. And I, one of them, several of them, took me out\nto the site of one of the underground factories that they\nbuilt. And it was a fantastic thing. We went in\nunderground and you could look up and see the undercarriage\nof railroad cars. Tremendous presses and power equipment,\nand there we were scrounging for screwdrivers, files,\nhammers, little vices. I don't know, it just struck me as\nweird. I visited that site again, in 1991. It had _ been\ncompleted by the German army, and had been used _ for\nmunitions storage, the Americans, we used to use it to store\nnuclear warheads, for the German Pershing missile unit, that\nhad been in the, what was then the site of the DP camp.\nIncidentally, when I visited that camp in 1989 at the\nkacerne, the kacerne commander complained to me how crowded\nhe was. He had 700 men there. And when I told him we had\nfour to seven thousand, he was incredulous. But anyway, uh,\nI'm rambling.",
        "SWB: Let's do something short because we only have a minute\nleft. Why don't you just tell me the physical condition of\nthe people in the camp when you got there.\nIRVING HEYMONT: Surprisingly, in good shape. And I found\nout why. There was a DP hospital not too far away, at St.\nTatillion, and the more serious cases were brought there.\nIn my stirring speech, I pointed out, you who survived, now\ngonna succumb to disease because of your own filth. And the\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/9/95 Int.

What you see here are\nthe survivors. And they're not going to die that quickly.\nSo be it.",

        "[CR#3]\nSWB: Before you start, tell me a little about your",

What was the first thing\nyou wanted to do.\nIRVING HEYMONT: Keep out of trouble.\nSWB: How did you run the camp, and what were your major\ngoals?\nIRVING HEYMONT: I've often been asked, what waS my major\ngoal in running the camp. The answer is very simple. Keep\nout of trouble, not incur any adverse publicity, do as I was\ntold, and not imperil my career. At the same time, do as\nmuch as I can to help these people. I realized later on,\nthat if my father had not found ah, service in the Czarist\narmy distasteful, made his way to the United States about\n1900, I might, if I had been lucky, have been a Survivor in\nthat camp. The other thing that soon became apparent to me,\nis what the motivation of the people in the camp were. And\nI realized that, with the increased attention being paid to\nthe uh, plight of Jewish DP's, and the treatment by the army\nas as result of an investigation ordered by President\nTruman, the Harrison report, the high-level attention we\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.",
        "Wentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/9/95 Int. IRVING HEYMONT\nPage 12\ngot, got to be very very close. We had generals in and out,\nabout every other day. But looking back now, I can see\nwhere there are two different perceptions. Two different\nviews were clashing. What the DP's wanted, and what\u2019 the\narmy wanted. Ah, simply, the army wanted, would be very\nhappy, if the Jewish DP's were content to live in camps,\nlike soldiers in garrison at peacetime, and would be clean,\nneat, and orderly, and not cause any difficulties. The DP's\nhad tremendous differences among themselves. Uh, there even\nwere some Jewish DP's who couldn't talk to the others.\nThese were the Greeks and Greek Jews, who didn't even speak\nYiddish. But they had a different set of motivations. The\nfirst and primary motivation was to find survivors, members\nof the family. And the ends they went to were incredible.\nThey traveled all over the face of Europe, looking for\nSurvivors. I was told that the post office was a cemetery\nin their home town, that people would leave notes. on\ntombstones. The other great motivation was to try to\nrestore, wherever possible, some semblance of family life.\nThat's why they cooked together. That's why they try to\nbreak these barracks, rooms, into somewhat private rooms.\nAnd above all, despite their internal differences, they were\nall united on one thing, to get out of Germany, at the first\nand guickest possible time. The army saw these, I'm\nspeaking in broad general terms. Uh, here were people who\nwere not neat, clean, orderly, and docile. And above all,",
        "were suspected of being prime movers in ae black market.\nThat was a terrible bugaboo, the black market. The black\nmarket was any transaction that wasn't according to_ the\nunreasonable regulations. The standing joke was, among the\nAmericans, if everybody in Germany, at least in the American\nzone, who was black marketing was put into jail, there'd be\nnobody left to guard them. There was no question that the\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/9/95 Int. IRVING HEYMONT\nPage 13\nDP's, just like the native, the local Germans, were also\nblack-marketing. Swapping to get cigarettes, in turn,\nSwapped for something else. There were a few really big\nblack marketers. I met some of them. Their goal was\u2019 to\namass something and, diamonds, jewelry were the goal, that\nare easily transportable, easily hidden, and equ- of equal\nvalue, and of value no matter where you are. And that way\nthey would have a stake to start all over. The head of the\nlocal military government, a Major Ryan, now deceased, of\nGerman descent, was, thought that all the black marketers\nhad their origin in the Landsberg DP camp. And they would\ntake off, looking for survivors, carrying army blankets with\nthem. The only kind they had. Ah, it was getting cold. He",
        "felt they were taking the army blankets were going to sell\nthem, so he slapped them into jail for black marketers and I\nwould have to fight with him and try to get them out. It\nreached a point finally where the feud between the two of us\ngot to be so great that it was resolved by my _ battalion\nbeing moved, wholesale, in exchange for another battalion in\nthe regiment, and he got transferred to another town. They\ncouldn't remove me, they didn't want to remove me individ\nually cause that would have caused problems which we won't\ngo into. So those different perceptions, the problem of\nSanitation, which was a bugaboo to all our visiting\ngenerals, and the army we're always big on, everything has\nto be neat and clean and orderly. All the debris strewn\naround on the streets, left over by the Germans, uh, the\npeople at camp told me when I spoke to them about cleaning\nit up, they said, why should we, we didn't leave it. If you\ndon't like it, get the Germans to clean it up. They\nabsolutely refused to. I finally got it cleaned up by\nslightly illegal, I struck a deal with some friend of mine\nwho was running a POW cage at Dachau. And uh, they sent a\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/9/95 Int. IRVING HEYMONT\nPage 14",
        "lot of prisoners out, under guard, each day, until they\ncleaned up the street. Another thing that was unreasonable,\nwinter was coming, and it was a problem of how do you heat\nthe camp. And I was told that they had made wonderful\narrangements. They had arranged with the local German\ngovernment for the forrestmeister, the forestry man, to set\naside German woods where the camp people would cut the wood.\nAnd they made arrangements for a local agricultural inst-\nequipment factory in Landsberg, still there, still\noperating, would manufacture pot-bellied stoves. When I\nasked how do I get the wood cut, with what, and then how do\nI transport it from the woods into the camp. I was only\nauthorized two two two and a half ton trucks. I was\u2019 told,\nuse local initiative. Meaning, we don't know the answer but\nyou go solve it. Well we solved it. By a number of things.\nThen after a while, the people of the camp, we got them to\ngo out to cut wood, the young people by telling them all\nsorts of lies about how they were going to learn how to use\npower saws, which they'll use in Palestine, God knows if\nthey had trees there or not, and uh we promised them an\nextra reward of cigarettes, which we got out of the Red\nCross packages for prisoners of war, which we had quite a\nbit. And it worked for a while, and then they started to\ncomplain. It was wet out there, they didn't have adequate\nclothing, and they made a very unusual statement. They\nsaid, you know, considering what the Germans did, burning\nus, the least we can expect the Germans to do is to supply\nthings for us to burn to keep warm. Is that unreasonable?",
        "I couldn't answer. Finally, given the uh, time limit, I\narranged for to get SS prisoners, we had an SS cage. By\nthis time all the Verrmachter had been discharged, up near\nBubliegen, run by F company I think it was. But, I can only\nhave access to them on a strict union scale. I could have\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/9/95 Int. IRVING HEYMONT\nPage 15\nthem for eight hours from the time they left the cage until\nthey returned. Uh, we made no comment. And in turn, we had\nto feed them a noon meal. And uh, to feed them the noon\nmeal, we brought them into the camp. And they claimed the\npeople of the camp were insulting them. And we told them,\nthat's too bad. If you don't want to put up with it, you\nstay out in the woods, we can't bring the food to you, but\nyou can stay out in the woods without food. Solved that\nproblem. We were always faced with all these, each one of\nthem nothing earth-shaking, but very meddlesome[?] and\nbothersome. The other problem was the housing situation.\nThe camp was getting to be intolerably crowded. We got\naccess to a new camp called Wolfhartshausen, which had been\nin a big German munitions factory and had a lot of small\nhouses, suitable, wonderful, for families. And uh, we",
        "wanted to move them there to relieve the crowding. IT ran\ntrucks down, with the people of the camp, go see for\nyourself that we're not fooling them. Took all the camp\nleaders down. Nobody wanted to move, very few. The idea of\na transport had memories for them they couldn't shake. And\nbesides, they claimed, lLansdberg waS now a city, a\ncommunity, they had schools, they formed friendships,\nassociations, they didn't want to move. Meanwhile, more and\nmore Jewish Jews were coming in from East Europe, and_ uh,\nagain it was a problem. The overcrowding and yet you can't,\nwhere you didn't want to force people to go we knew that\nwould lead to very undesirable circumstances. Finally I was\ntold, practically with no notice, that an engineering\nbrigade would be moved out of Landsberg and the village\nturned over to the camp and I could requisition a certain\nnumber of German houses. And there I made a horrible\nmistake. Instead of getting the Germans to move the Germans\nout of the houses, we did it ourselves. And the people of\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/9/95 Int. IRVING HEYMONT\nPage 16\nthe camp just watched to see, here are Germans being moved\nout, they way they had been moved out. And uh, we had told",
        "the Germans they can take anything that could be moved. And\nthey started to take their furniture and some of the people\nof the camp said no, that's not right, they're taking more\nthan we were allowed to take and they started to stop,\nfights broke out, and it was a near riot. Well, I called\nout the troops, separated them, closed the camp, moved all\nthe Jews back into the camp, and I realized that was a\nmistake the way I handled it. Fortunately I've never had\nanother occasion to redo it again so I could do it properly.\nThe, that housing problem, was really very, in many respects\nvery touching. I remember one woman came to me once, with\nher little son, she stopped me in the camp. I was\u2019 always\nbeing stopped and asked things. She said she had lost...\n[CAMERA RELOAD]\n[CR#4 ]\nIRVING HEYMONT: That housing situation wasS a constant\nproblem as well as the sanitation. Now once I stopped by a\nwoman in the camp, and by this time my poor German, which I\nstudied in school, was adequate to get along, and with those\nwho spoke Yiddish, told me that she had lost her husband,\nand I forget how many, fantastic number of family members,\nand she and her little son were the only survivors. And she\ndoesn't want to punish any Germans, all she wanted was a\nlittle apartment where she and her son could live and not in\none of the rooms in the barracks. And would I please take\ncare of it and have it made available to her, and was~ she",
        "asking too much, in consideration of what the Germans had to\ndone to her. It was one of the things that I had to let go.\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/9/95 Int. IRVING HEYMONT\nPage 1/7\nThe uh, another thing that was very interesting, was my\nrelation with the Germans. Everybody in Landsberg and\nvicinity knew me, who I was. And I don't think anybody\nloved me. Every time I'd drive through the town, I can see\npeople silently stare at me. And uh, I would used to go to\none barber shop to get my hair cut. My driver, who was a\nvery loyal soul, would come in and he would sit watching the\nbarber cut my hair, with his carbine in his lap. One time,\nwe were driving through Landsberg and some kid threw a rock\nat me, in the Jeep. We could go faster in the Jeep than he\ncould run. And I caught him, anda lot of people saw me. I\ngrabbed him, and put him right in the back of the Jeep and\nheld on to him, took him into the camp, and I called the\nlocal military government, turned him over to them, the\npolice came and got him. Uh, I was told later that he was\nturned back to his parents and told, if anything like that\nhappened again, it was a young kid, I'd say he must have\nbeen about ten or eleven, I'm guessing. They would be",
        "punished. I was subsequently told, of course I can't prove\nit, that the police had to return to the house later to keep\nthe parents from beating so severely. The uh, I mentioned\nabout the riot, I should add, the next day I got calls from\nall the army units in the area, what waS going on. All\nthose German civilian employees were staying home. The\nrumor was that the uh, I had set one day aside for all the\nJewish DP's to pillage and loot, and they had all gone home\nto protect their selves. We were also, another thing that\ncontributed to my infamy, is that we were ordered for a\nknock-down, house-to-house, room-by-room search for hidden\nweapons, from high headquarters. I thought it was the most\nridiculous thing. We did do it, I think we collected up\nsome spears from the time when the Germans were in Africa.\nBut, I had a note made, in German, which every time they\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/9/95 Int. IRVING HEYMONT\nPage 18\nentered a house, they handed a copy of the note, which told\nthem what's gonna happen, and it was signed with my name.\nThat of course contributed to my popularity. The other big\nthing in the camp was the election. I was urged to hold the\nelection as soon as possible. Finally, we figured it was",
        "time to hold the election. And it involved extensive\nnegotiations with the camp committee on how to conduct\u2019 the\nelection. Uh, their idea was that they run, we decided on\nwhat the structure of the camp administration would be, what\nwould be elected, that there would be slates. And uh the\npercentage of the number of officers would be apportioned as\nto the way, how many, how well the slate did, same as_ the\nEuropean system, the system that's used in Israel now. And\nof couse, I violently objected. I said absolutely not,\nwe're going to do it American style. You vote for a\ncandidate, and the one who gets the most votes wins. And\nthe men of the battalion really thought that was a wonderful\nthing to do, and they all pitched in as best as they\nremember how you construct a ballot, ballot boxes, polling\nbooths, ballots, watchers, and so forth. What amazed me\nwas, they very, there were three principal parties formed.\nOne from the east European, the Polish Jews, the other one\nfrom, a lot of them from the Baltic area. And they had\nleaflets. How and where they had them printed, I don't\nknow. How and they hired trucks with little bands parading\nthrough the streets of the camp, I don't, to this very day I\ndon't know. I made a collection of those leaflets which I\ngave to an ins- an ins- an institute in New York, but it was\nthe most spirited thing I'd ever seen. And we had one\ntrouble with one man who came in to the booth we had erected\nwith his wife, and we said you can't do that. You go in and\nvote, she goes in and votes after you, or before you. S-\nAnd he took that aS a personal offense. He couldn't",

IRVING HEYMONT\nPage 19\nunderstand why he and his wife couldn't go in and he would\nvote with, for her. But it went off and they, I could\nreport to General Rolf, they now had a democratically\nelected camp committee.\nSWB: Tell me about when and where you got the truckload of\ntoilet paper.\nIRVING HEYMONT: One of the problems was the s- that\ncontributed was a lack of toilet paper. The uh, well\nreally, let me cover that briefly, then I'd like to go back\ninto the mess hall deal. And uh, the local burgermeister,\nand the local military government told me that toilet paper\nin Germany was at a premium. But I figure somewhere in this\ngreat American U.S. army, if you look around, somewhere,\nyou'll find whatever it is you need. And the big supply\ndepot was up in the Antwerp area. So I told my supply\nofficer, you take a truck, a two-and-a half ton truck, ten\nand a half trailer, and you get up there and somewhere\nthere's a warehouse full of toilet paper, I'm sure of it.\nAnd you come back with a truck and trailer load full. And",
        "1f anybody catches you in the act, you tell them I sent you,\nyou know from nothing, you're merely doing what I, you were\ntold. He came back. Sure enough, he found a warehouse full\nof toilet paper, I don't know how he did it, but he came\nback with a full load. And I felt very happy. But the next\nday afterwards, after it had been distributed I got really\nmad. I looked out and I found the whole camp festooned with\ntoilet paper, rolled up like crepe, like crepe hangings. I\nfound out what was the occasion. They knew, and I didn't\nknow, I heard a few hours later, that Mr. Ben-Gurion was\ncoming to visit the camp, and they were decorating the camp\nfor him, with my toilet paper that we went all the way to\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/9/95 Int. IRVING HEYMONT\nPage 20\nAntwerp to steal. Anyway, Mr. Ben-Gurion arrived, and I met\nwith him, I told him what our problems were and I said I'll\nshow you what I consider the best in the camp, and I'll show\nyou what I consider the worst in the camp and you judge for\nyourself. And I'm certainly not going to try to fool you.\nOf course, you can talk to people and I can't do as well.\nWell we went through the camp, and he spoke to the people of\nthe camp, and listening to him was quite an experience. I",
        "watched the audience more than I watched him. From the look\nof the people, you would think the lord himself had\ndescended on earth to mingle with the people. I had never\nseen anything like it before or since. When he left, uh, he\nSaid to me, he said you know I understand your problems.\nAnd he said, don't think a trip across the Mediterranean\nwipes out all of your problems. We have some of those too.\nHe didn't go into detail, nor did I press him. But the rapt\naudience, the way they hung on every word, was\u2019 really\nsomething to see. But I was so mad to see my toilet paper\nbeing crepe paper.\nSWB: You wanted to talk about the mess hall.\nIRVING HEYMONT: Oh yes. Another one of my very brilliant\nideas, God was I naive, to try to get, reduce the sanitation\nproblem, incidentally let me di- distract for a moment. One\nof the reasons I found out, many years later, why they\nurinated in the halls, defecated, 1s when I real Primo\nLevy's book, about the problem when you had to go out at\nnight, and the last man had to carry the bucket, and they\ncould tell by the sound, so to avoid going out with at\nnight, they'd do it right in the camp in a corner, and that\ncarried on. Well anyway, to try to reduce the washing of\nthe dishes in the sinks in the latrines, and flushing it\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.",
        "Wentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/9/95 Int. IRVING HEYMONT\nPage 21\ndown the toilets and everything, I had the idea, we'll have\na community mess hall, a community dining room. And the\nproblem, we fixed up a, it was a riding hall, and we fixed\nthat up with tables and chairs and uh, the camp newspaper\nadvertised for waitresses, and we promised them cigarettes\nand other goodies as a reward. The problem came up uh, how\nabout dishes. And that was quite a problem. But I solved\nit in my usual inimitable manner. I turned to my. supply\nofficer, and I said, go get dishes. And we found out where\nall the china factories were in Bavaria, and we worked out a\ndeal where the military government would arrange for the\nlocal, for the uh kreis Landsberg, not the city, to pick up\nthe tab, if he could get it. He did. How and where I don't\nknow, I didn't ask. But lo and behold he came back with the\ndishware, and we had a gala opening....\n[CAMERA RELOAD |\n[CR#5]\nSWB: Do you want to start?\nIRVING HEYMONT: I'll finish up about the uh mess hall.

        "SWB: Go ahead.\nIRVING HEYMONT: Oh my great pride and joy in having finally\nseen the mess hall come to fruition tempered after a while,\nwhen I realized [?????] and yes they did eat in the mess\nhall, but they also took the food back to their rooms\u2019 and\ncooked and ate there as well. Anyway, I like to think that\nit contributed to communal spirit and possibly, eased up a\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/9/95 Int. IRVING HEYMONT\nPage 22\nlittle bit on the sanitation problem. One could hope. I\nreally don't know. Another interesting thing, was\u2019 the\nquestion of children. The number of children in the camp,\nconsidering the size of the population, was\u2019 relatively\nsmall. But they were really the pride, the treasure, the\njoy, and the attention lavished on them was very obvious.\nAnd they were all in school, run by the people in the camp\nthemselves. And they started all this before the UNRHA\nteam, before the AJDC team. An interesting things was, uh,\nwe were always plagued by all our German employees. Can we\nSpare some condoms. And God we had lots and lots of",
        "condoms. Got to the point during the actual fighting that\nyou wouldn't send a patrol out unless they had a condoms and\na pro kit with them. But anyway, nobody in the camp ever\nasked me for condoms. And one time I mentioned it to some\nmembers of the camp committee and they looked at me. And\nthey said, you don't understand, there are six million who\ndied, we have to do something about it. Nobody wants a\ncondom, we want children, we have to make up for the six\nmillion. We had visitors all the time. I'm not talking\nabout all the generals. And they always arranged to come\nwhen it was time to have a noon meal. Because we had an\nexcellent mess, and I suspected they sometimes came to get a\nreal good meal, and to find ways to tell me things I should\ndo, and didn't have time to do or didn't want to do. But\nanyway we got quite afew Civilian visitors from\norganizations in the United States. And uh I got told later\non that I was rude to one of them. And that was Mr. Jacob\nPatowski, who I believe was the head of one of the needle\nunions, I think the cap and hatmakers, something like that,\nI'm not sure. And he was telling me about all the wonderful\nthings that his union was going to do for the people of the\ncamp. And I was ina hurry, I had so many other things, I\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.",
        "Wentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/9/95 Int.

He didn't take that too well. Another\nvisitor that I had was Rabbi Abraham Klausner. Now there is\na most unusual man. Uh, in my opinion, never haS one man\ndone so much good yet managed to irritate so many people as\nwell. He visited me twice. Once he came when Mr. Ben\nGurion came and I had nothing to do with him. He came\nanother time and I admit, I must admit looking back now,\nthat I was, that my view was based on a regular army\nofficer, who was very conscious, of a Jew being in the\nregular army, and anything that reflected on one Jew,\nreflected on all. And he came in the most outlandish\nuniform. Completely out of uniform. I found out later on\nthat in my opinion, in effect, he had gone absent without\nleave from his unit. I'm not denying in any manner all the\nwonderful fantastic things that that man did to help the\nDP's. But he made a request of me that was illegal, and got\nme very enraged, and I said if you, if that's the best way\nyou could look, and that's all you can ask me for, don't\never show up here again or I'm gonna punch you in the nose.\nUh, I wrote this ina letter to my wife, which was published\nin the uh, reproduced in the book put out by the American\nJewish archives, and uh, Rabbi Klausner read it, and he and\nI carried on a very short correspondence, and what he said I",
        "think 1s worthy is repeating. After this business about\npunching him in the nose, all that, he said obviously, what\nhe was trying to do was to save the Jews of Europe by\nbringing them out into the American zone of Germany, from\nbehind the East Europe. And my goal, apparently, was to try\nto make him more comfortable. Looking back, he was right.\nHe really was right. Looking back, what did I do, I made\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/9/95 Int.

I couldn't contribute to their getting out of\nGermany, I did a little illegal mailing of letters, before\nthey had access to a postal system, but looking back, in\ntruth, he- Klausner was right. I made life a little more\nbearable. How much of a contribution that is, I don't know.\nIt doesn't matter now.\nSWB: What did he ask you for...\nIRVING HEYMONT: I'd rather not go into that.",

That morning I arrived as I told you,\nat Landsberg in the middle of the night, about two or three\nin the morning. They told me breakfast was across\u2019 the\nstreet where the guy in headquarters had a mess hall,\nofficers' mess.

There were some\nnurses, and I think there were one or two maintenance people\nwith some of the equipment. But otherwise it was all run by\nthe Jews. And let me just put it this way, they weren't all\nangels. Uh, I hate to categorize groups, but one group that\ncaused us a lot of trouble were the truck drivers. To be\nable to drive a truck was a uh very valuable skill, and uh,\nmany of them were able to survive in the concentration camps\nbecause of skills. And uh some of the more enterprising\nsouls managed to survive, and they knew how to maneuver.\nThey caused us quite a bit of trouble. They caused uh, once\nor twice there was a near strike. The uh, there was that\nincident, I'll never forget, the illegal restaurant. I was\ntold they found a restaurant up in the attic of one of the\nbarracks run by one of the men of the camp, they even hired\nsome German waitresses. And of course the camp police broke\nit up, and the man was in the camp jail. I suppose I should\nhave inquired how do they do it, how do they manage to get\naway with it, but I just didn't. And I remember the next\nday I asked, what happened to the man you put in jail. They\nsaid, oh he died of a heart attack. I don't know. Didn't\npursue. Another incident that I saw, was uh, I came into\nthe camp one day and near my office, not far from the\nentrance, there was a near, almost a small riot, aman being\nbeaten. Well I waited and pulled my pistol and shoved them\nto aside and collared them, found out. They had recognized",

The camp organization was\nstronger because it was a self, a democratically elected\ncamp committee, no differences. And the people of the camp\nhad developed their schools, their institutions, a cultural\nand social program, whether that, whether I was the c-,\ncontributing to it or not, I don't know.
