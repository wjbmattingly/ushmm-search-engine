        "Q: Would you tell me your full name please?",
        "A: My name 1s Stephen Frank Dachi.",
        "Q: Where were you born?",
        "A: I was born in Budapest, Hungary, in April of 1933.",
        "Q: Uh, tell me about your your early childhood.",
        "A: Well, I was a child of a couple of doctors. My father was a dentist and my mother was a\npediatrician and uh in 1936, when I was not quite three years old, my father passed away in a\nsort of a medical uh mishap and uh then my mother died shortly thereafter, so I was left to be\nraised by my grandparents, uh just before the war started, and my grandparents were living\nin Timisoara, in Romania, so that from Budapest uh I ended up uh going to Timisoara and\nthat's where I went to school and lived until uh after the war in 1948 when we left.",
        "Q: What was Timisoara like for a young child? What was your family life like, friends, that sort\nof a thing?",
        "A: Well, uh that small city of about a hundred thousand people was a little bit out of the\nmainstream of the worst of the war and uh life was uh was fairly uh fairly quiet, but uh there\nwere plenty of periods of danger and excitement uh during the war that 1s, when uh...there\nwere uh lots of bombing raids because Timisoara was on the railway line and uh when the\nAllies were bombing the Ploesti oil fields in Romania, they were also bombing the uh\nrailway tracks that were leading the oil away from the area. And then uh once in a while uh\nGerman troops would come through. Uh there weren't any occupying forces there normally.\nOf course, Romania was fighting on the side of the Axis uh powers during the war, but\noccasionally uh some Nazi contingent would come through and uh uh come into town. I\nremember once uh one of their commanders made a speech from the main theater saying that\nthat night there was going to be a Jew hanging from every second window on the main\nsquare, and uh they did round up and take people away. I, I remember in uh going to school\nin the morning sometimes and having my classmates tell about how their fathers were taken\naway in the middle of the night uh almost always never to be seen again. So there was plenty\nof tragedy, plenty of stress and excitement.\nUh we...our family was not Jewish but we were nevertheless uh uh always in danger\nanyway. My grandparents uh were very conscious of having this small boy to raise and my\ngrandmother was always talking about how she had to somehow live uh until I was twenty-\none to uh fulfill her responsibility that she assumed when my parents passed away, but I\nknow uh because they told me that uh, you know, they lived in dread of that knock on the\ndoor in the middle of the night also, and they kept a couple of vials of poison on their\nbedstands, because they told me that they were not going to be taken away, that if the\nGermans came to take them away, they would commit suicide. Uh I don't know what would\nhave happened to me uh but in any case that did not happen. Uh and we uh we lived with\nthat until finally the Russian troops came through in uh in...sometime in the spring or\nsummer of 1944. The Germans were pushed back and uh then we had to start worrying about\nabout the Russians. Uh I was uh I was a Hungarian citizen living in Romania and at the time\nRomania had switched sides and was now fighting on the side of the Russians. Now they\nswitched sides just as the Russians reached the Romanian border, so uh there was not that\nmuch destruction in Romania. Uh but Hungary put up very stiff resistance because the\nHun...uh the Hungarian Nazi uh government was one of uh Hitler's firmest allies. Admiral\nHorthy...",
        "Q: Excuse me...if we can save some of that and let the historians give that kind of a\nbackground...I'd like to stick with your story...you have a particularly interesting one at this\npoint. Uh what happened to you when the Russians came in?",
        "A: Well, because I was a Hungarian citizen and the Hungarians were still fighting on the side of\nthe Nazis, uh the Russians were rounding up Hungarians to take them away uh and so one\nday a Russian soldier came to our house and uh said that I was going to go with him, and my\ngrandmother uh who was a Romanian citizen and was not involved in this so they didn't uh\nask any questions of her...uh said \"Well, you're not taking him away\" and he said \"Well, we\nare, So you better give him a winter coat because he's going far away where it's going to be\ncold.\" So my grandmother, bless her soul, she thought that if she refused to give me a coat\nthat they wouldn't take me away uh but of course they did. So then uh we uh...I was taken to\nthis basement of a police station where the people on that particular day where being\nrounded up, and I recognized some of them and I know that subsequently uh, you know,\nnone of those people that I saw there were ever seen again because we were uh scheduled to\nbe taken away uh to Siberia, but just as uh this round-up was in the...going on and we were\nin there in the basement, the German bombing raid came and there were bombs flying\naround all over the place, exploding right around us and uh glass shattering and uh door\nframes cracking and people...guards, prisoners, everyone was uh was uh lying down on the\nfloor with their heads...hands covering their head and uh, you know, I was eleven years old,\nso I thought this was the time for me to make a getaway so I just climbed out the window\nand ran down the street without worrying about my safety or life...1 mean there were bombs\nfalling right on the street where I was running. Craters would open up in front of me and I\nhad to get around, but I managed to somehow uh get away from there and then I ran to a\nsynagogue uh some distance away and there uh a rabbi took me in and hid me in the\nbasement for several days until uh the the round-up seemed to abate and uh he told me that\nbecause during the war so many people had helped save Jewish lives by hiding people...that\nwas done somewhat more in Romania maybe than in Hungary...uh that he was uh\nreciprocating a little bit, taking some people in now that uh the tide had turned and uh so he\nhe kept me there for a few days and then eventually I went back home uh but decided no one\nwill ever get me again, and uh uh, you know, we always uh slept and sat, whatever, with\nwith a getaway path in mind in case someone came in to get us. To this day, in in any\nrestaurant I go to, I always sit with my back to the wall and facing the door, because deep in\nmy subconscious I'm still on the alert for somebody coming 1n to to get me, so these things\nstay with you forever.",
        "Q: You are...you had escaped. You're now with your grandparents. Tell us what happened.",
        "A: Well, uh afterwards uh ...",
        "Q: You were liberated or...the Russians had come in. Did they leave you alone after this or...?",
        "A: Yes, they uh...the Russians uh didn't come around again to get me, at least, and then the war\nended in '45. I had uh I had a uh an aunt who with her husband had moved to Canada before\nthe war, and so in 1948 we managed to get papers and uh uh got out of there, uh bribing the\nauthorities and having all of our earthly goods taken away from us in exchange for a passport\nand an exit uh visa. Uh we couldn't get our papers at the same time, so I had to uh travel...I\nwent first. I went by myself from Romania all the way to Canada and then later uh my uh my\ngrandmother followed. My grandfather had already died. In those three years, from the end\nof the war until 1948, uh we found out how a few of our family members had perished.\nUh almost all the members of my family died during the war, one way or another. Uh my\nsister...I had a sister who was eight years older than I was who when my parents died chose\nto remain in in Hungary and went to live in a convent, and uh during the war the Nazis sort\nof seized this convent and used the women for housework and uh whatever else...sewing and\nLord knows what what else...and then when uh during the siege of Budapest, they uh...when\nthe Nazis were fleeing Budapest eventually...this was in the winter...uh they took my sister\nand all the other women in the convent with them. My sister already had uh an advanced\ncase of TB they call galloping consumption and so on the truck uh when she got too sick uh\non the road to Austria, they just threw her out on the roadside and left her there to to die in in\nuh the snow, and we found out about this because uh another woman who was on the truck\nwith her who survived came to visit us sometime later to tell us the story, and, you know,\nthat was a common thing that uh many people who survived the Holocaust or the war in\nsome way...at the end of the war they made a special effort to go and visit whenever they\ncould the families of people that that died next to them or that they saw, so that they could\nrecount the circumstances. That happened a lot and we had two or three such visits about\nother relatives as well as my sister. So that was one act of human solidarity that the few\nsurvivors tried to to do as a good turn for the relatives of those who had perished.",
        "Q: How did you then...you were 1n Canada...you got to Canada...what what did you do then as a\nyoung child. You were now thirteen, fourteen...",
        "A: Fifteen...yes. I was fifteen. Well, when I got to Canada I finished high school and my uncle\nand aunt had helped me get there, and then I went to university and eventually in the '50's uh\nI studied dentistry in at the University of Oregon. That's how I first came to the United\nStates. And then when I got my dental degree in 1956, I did some advanced uh work,\ngraduate work and I got a graduate degree in uh oral pathology, uh specializing in diseases of\nthe mouth and the face and the neck, and then uh I went into uh academic life and was one of\nthe founders of a new college of dentistry at the University of Kentucky in Lexington, where\nfive of us started a new school, really from a from an empty cornfield and at the end of that\nperiod when the first class graduated from there in 1966, I decided to uh to look for let's say\nnew horizons and like so many people uh looked toward a second career. So in 1967 I left\nthe school, left the university and uh initially took a leave of absence and uh joined the staff\nof the Peace Corps and I uh worked as a Peace Corps Deputy Director and then eventually as\na Country Director of the Peace Corps, first in Columbia, then in Venezuela and finally in\nBrazil and uh that turned out to be a very good and uh wonderful learning experience and so\nI, I uh resigned my professorship...can't stay on a leave of absence for ever\n..and uh then I was recruited into the Foreign Service and I became a Foreign Service officer\nwith the United States Information Agency, USIA, which uh has the press and cultural\nsections of American embassies around the world, and they call it USIS...so I worked and\nstayed with them from 1972 until now and I've had a series of assignments around the world\nincluding being uh Cultural Attache in Hungary tn uh in the '70's, and then on loan to the\nDepartment of State as Consul General in Sao Paulo, Brazil in the mid-'80's.",
        "Q: So you were in Brazil in the mid '80's and something rather extraordinary happened.",
        "A: Yes. Something...something very extraordinary happened. Uh I remember the day it all\nbegan very clearly. On June the 6th 1985...1t was only about three months after Lee and I,\nmy wife and I, had arrived to Sao Paulo to take up my duties as Consul General and uh the\nphone rang in the morning and it was my press attache, Jim Dandridge, who was calling me\nto tell me that he had heard on the radio and was watching on television at that very time,\nthat there was an exhumation going on uh for the alleged remains of Josef Mengele and that\nhe thought I should uh know about that. And that was quite a...quite a startling way to start a\nday which was the first day off, the first holiday that I'd had since I'd arrived, and all of a\nsudden all of these dim memories came into my mind because I, I really hadn't followed the\nstory of Josef Mengele as closely as perhaps many others had, but it all came back to me in a\nin a flash about a half a million people whose death he was involved with and uh all of the\nmany times that he had been sighted or thought to have been found before. Uh but I didn't\nhave too much time to to think uh you know, long thoughts because uh things, events began\nto cascade uh you know, at a very rapid pace.\nUh I started getting uh phone calls from the Embassy in Brasilia, the capital, from the State\nDepartment in Washington, from television, from networks, from newspapers, uh from\neverywhere because uh, you know, there had been so many times when Mengele had been\nfound and it turned out to be a hoax or false news that uh, you know, if this if this was going\nto be the real thing, there was tremendous interest everywhere, and more specifically as far\nas our government and the Department of State and the Justice Department were concerned.\nUh there had been an agreement signed only recently between the German, Israeli and\nAmerican governments that we would coordinate and cooperate on any further Nazi hunts\nand here uh there was this going on and the U.S. government knew nothing about it, so they\nwere anxious to find out very quickly. And so I began uh right away to to look for my\nGerman counterpart, the German Consul there who was very busy uh with all the events\ngoing on, but I insisted that he meet me and uh he uh he was not anxious to do it, but\neventually uh I didn't...I didn't uh let up and so about midnight that night in a restaurant we\nfinally met and he told me the first part of the story,\nthat a few days earlier German uh police had raided the home of Hans SeidImeier, who was a\nmanager of the Mengele family enterprises in GUnzburg what was then West Germany, and\nuh had found some papers, notes, letters with some addresses on them indicating that uh uh\nwhere Mengele either was or had been, so without any knowledge as to whether he was alive\nor dead, the German authorities immediately came to Brazil, contacted the Federal police\nand had staked out this house uh whose address they they gleaned from this information, but\nafter a few days of staking the house out and not seeing any any old man who looked uh he\nwould possibly in uh Josef Mengele's category of age group or whatever, they raided the\nhouse\nand uh and uh came upon this couple, Wolfgang and Lisalotte Brossert, uh who were\nGerman Brazilians and who uh quickly admitted that they had had a role in in uh sheltering\nand protecting Josef Mengele for the last few years of his life according to the story they told\nand that when he died by drowning on the beach...he was with them at this beach...that he\nhad had a stroke while he was uh...this is what she said...that he had had a stroke while he\nwas swimming there in this beach town of Bertioga, and uh that uh he therefore drowned\nbecause he couldn't get out of the water, and Mrs. Brossert uh decided right there that she\ndidn't want to expose and reveal the whole story of of Mengele's hiding and so on and their\nrole in it most importantly, so she went to some length to bury him under a false name and\nby bending some rules about the identification of the dead and so on, buried him there some\nuh five or six years before and uh now took the authorities there for the exhumation and was\nquite uh forthcoming with information. Uh...",
        "Q: Who persuaded her to take the authorities? How did they convince her that she had to do\nthis?",
        "A: You mean to to give the information now?...Well, I think she thought the game was up. I\nthink that uh it was uh...she had to make a choice as to whether she was going to try to uh\nkeep up with a whole new package of lies and deception, and I think she probably decided\nright away that that would be impossible and it would be too complicated and that uh that\nshe couldn't get away with it so I think uh from the beginning she decided uh to cooperate. In\nother words, she made a decision to bury him under false name, hoping that somehow uh\nthat would do it, but once once she saw that the game was up, one one of the things uh she\nsaid when they first raided her house apparently by...according to press reports, was uh \"I\ndidn't think it would take you this long to uh to get here.\"\nSo uh...but in in the house there, aside from the various uh uh stories that she told, they also\nfound some photographs. They found a diary that was allegedly that of Mengele that was\ntaken away by hand-writing experts, and uh and some other memorabilia and then she told\nmany stories about Mengele's son having come to visit both when Mengele was still alive\nand after he died, he came to retrieve some of his possessions, including part of the diary, but\nshe didn't tell him about another part that she kept, so the diary ended up being divided into\ntwo two parts. Uh in any event, uh when they exhumed these what were essentially were just\nbones, then the big project began. Is it him, or isn't it him\u2019? And how do you, how do you\nidentify a set of bones that have been buried not too many years ago archaeologically\nspeaking, but quite a few years ago, five or six years. So uh there there were a lot of a lot of\nsensitive factors involved. First of all, this exhumation took place in Brazil and the Brazilian\ngovernment and, to some extent, the Brazilian medical experts were very eager to prove that\nthey were fully competent to do such an examination and uh and the Brazilian government\nwas very eager to prove that they didn't need any foreigners interfering 1n their internal\nbusiness, so at first they said that they wouldn't give any visas to foreign specialists to\nparticipate in the identification and I received a call from Washington that day telling me that\nI'd better go in quickly and speak to the Chief of Police uh to to see 1f we could persuade him\nto change his mind, because uh these people had to come in, so I went uh the very next\nmorning to call on uh a man who now its has a very widely-known name around the\nworld....Romeu Tuma, who at that time was the Chief of the Sao Paulo Police.\nNow he's the chief of the Federal police for all of Brazil. And I had met him before. I didn't\nknow him well. As I was riding down in the car to see him and I was thinking just what what\nwould I say, you know, so I got there. He was a very...he's a very decent, nice man. Uh a\nvery unusual human being. A very unusual policeman, and I said to him, Dr. Tuma, I uh I\nwas born and raised in eastern Europe also and most of my family perished in the war and in\nthe Holocaust, and this man that we're talking about here, uh is responsible for the death of at\nleast 400,000 people. Four hundred thousand people. And I said that relatives and the\nsurvivors and all of their kin, all of the human beings who have shared this terrible historical\ntragedy, are scattered all over the world and their wounds in many, many, many cases\nhaven't healed yet, and they never will until they know what happened to that man, and even\nthen those wounds will only heal very superficially.\nBut Dr. Tuma, all of those people around the world have a right to be present here when we\ngo through this process. They have a right to be witnesses, to be present at the most\nimportant identification that we could do in our lifetimes, any one of us. They deserve to be\nhere and these specialists coming from other countries are coming here on their behalf:\nThey're coming here on behalf of all of mankind that suffered this horrible tragedy. And to\nDr. Tuma's great credit, he immediately sensed and understood this, and he immediately said\nyes and the the little mini-crisis was over and the people came and we could begin a more\nthorough approach of international cooperation 1n solving this vitally important puzzle,\nSo several groups came. There were quite a few specialists who came from Germany to join\nthose who had been there initially who were mostly policemen. And then there was a group\nof forensic specialists who were contracted by the Justice Department which uh in the last, in\nthe previous few years had inaugurated an Office of Special Investigations, specializing in\nuh pursuing Nazi uh war criminals and Nazi questions. I think that office was established\nduring the presidency of Jimmy Carter. And uh the U.S. Marshall's Service and the Justice\nDepartment also sent uh fingerprint experts and hand-writing experts and other such\nspecialists. And then the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles who retained the services\nof an independent, private group of forensic specialists, some of whom who had played very\nimportant roles in the identification of the disappeared Argentine citizens after the dirty war\nthere in the '70's where several thousand people disappeared without a trace, and also the\nJustice Department specialists were very experienced in in these world famous cases, so\nthese uh people all began to to arrive and showed up and the Israeli government sent an\nobserver whose name was Menachem Russek\u2019, who I think worked for their Justice\nDepartment, to follow events,\nand I remember vividly the first meeting that Dr. Tuma had with all of these newly arrived\nspecialists and their Brazilian counterparts, trying to organize and plan how this process\nwould be done, and I had already met most of them but I hadn't met Mr. Russek, so at the\nend of the meeting as people were walking out, I followed Mr. Russek and I went up to him\nand he was a short man with with silver hair, very ruddy cheeks and quite a spring 1n his step\nand he was walking out the building and I was sort of walking behind him, and I introduced\nmyself. I told him who I was and I said to Mr. Russek, I said, \"I hope that uh we can do this\nwhole process well enough to reach a satisfactory and scientifically acceptable outcome. I\nknow how much that means to you and how much it means to all of mankind.\" And up to\nthen he'd been sort of walking along and when I said that, he stopped and he turned and\nlooked me in the eye and he pondered the matter for a moment and then he said, \"The first\ntime I had the pleasure of meeting Dr. Josef Mengele in person was in Auschwitz in 1945\nand I certainly hope to have the pleasure to meet him in person one more time,\" and with that\nhe stopped and turned again and walked right out, but to me in those few words, the whole\ndrama, the whole tragedy, the whole sensitivity of this case came to life in such a powerful\nway that uh, you know, that the feeling that people have, the need that people have that\nsomehow Justice should be done...now you can't do justice with a man who's killed 400,000\npeople, but you can do the close...closest thing to it no matter how distant. You can somehow\nclose the circle, and if this man in fact died of a natural death without having been brought to\njustice, then at least let's be clear about the fact that he really 1s dead and close the circle in\nthat small but very important way.\nWell, uh then the work began. Now I was still only an observer at the time, although uh\npeople knew that I had been an oral pathologist uh at that time I was still the Consul General\nfollowing events for the U.S. government as part of the agreement that existed. And the\nspecialists went to work uh doing those things that can be done. Now the two basic ways in\nwhich remains can be identified are fingerprints, which of course don't exist when only\nbones remain, and dental x-rays, but in order to use dental x-rays to identify remains, you not\nonly have to have x-rays taken from the skull of the remains but you have to have x-rays\n\u2018Menachem Russek, an Israeli police superintendent charged by the Israeli government with the\ntask of tracking war criminals.\nfrom the person known to be the one we're seeking to identify that were in some authentic\nfile prior to his death, and by comparing the two you would have one of the most accurate\nand reliable ways of identifying remains that are currently known to medical science.\nUnfortunately, there were no such x-rays available in Mengele's Gestapo files or anywhere\nelse. The only thing that was available in those files was a dental chart which uh from my\nstandpoint as a dentist and with a with a knowledge in dental charting of of the 1980's was\nuh extremely incomplete. The only thing that chart had was an indication of which teeth that\nMengele had examined at the time he entered the SS in uh 1939, which teeth were present\nand which teeth were absent. That was the only thing on that chart. Now had a tooth in the\nskull...had there been a tooth in the skull that was present in the skull which was marked as\nmissing in 1939, it would have been proof positive that this was not the skull of Josef\nMengele, but there was no such tooth. Uh and other than that one feature, the chart was of no\nvalue because he obviously lost quite a number of teeth between 1939 and whenever he died\nor whenever this skull was being examined, but that was of no value in comparing it to the\nchart,\nso uh the specialists on these teams went ahead and did some various anthropological\nexaminations that showed that these bones belonged to an old man, that he was a Caucasian\nmale and not of some other racial origin, that his height was extremely close to the height\nthat Mengele was known to have had, and uh there were a number of other examinations\ncarried out on the bone bones, that were consistent with with Mengele. But the the really\nvery important examination that was done was was a procedure called craniometry, in which\nwhich is a also very accurate procedure. It just hasn't been around long enough to hold up in\ncourt the way dental x-rays would but nonetheless is very uh very accurate in which a\nnumber of features of the face, angles and sizes of ear lobes and the corner of the nose, the\nangle of the bridge of the nose and the lips, the chin and so on, are measured. And then with\na scientific measurement can be compared to an overlap and uh this was done with great care\nthere, and it was shown by comparing the photograph of the young Mengele from the SS\nfiles with the photograph of the old man that was found in Mrs. Brossert's house, that all of\nthese features matched perfectly and then by superimposing these same features on the skull,\nwhich is part of this technique, it was shown that all of these measurements and features\ncoincided between the photograph of the young man and the old man and between both of\nthese photographs and the skull. So between this very powerful positive identification\nevidence, the other things, the measurements that were taken on the bones and the fact that\nmany things matched with what was known about Mengele, all of the specialists there uh\nagreed that there was more than ninety-five percent chance that these remains were\ndefinitely those of Josef Mengele and uh the American specialists in particular said that with\ntheir extensive experience in court testimony, that that evidence was completely sufficient in\nany American court of law, it would be considered conclusive proof that these remains were\nthat of Josef Mengele.\nSo based on that, they decided to call a press conference and announce the results and I\nremember very vividly a meeting that was held just before the press conference in which Dr.\nTuma had gathered all of the people involved in this procedure, and at the end of this whole\nprocess and he said \"Now I would like each of you individually to stand up and tell me what\nyour findings are.\" And he went around the room and each individual stood up and said \"Dr.\nTuma, based on the examination that I've performed and the data that I have seen, I believe\nthat these are the remains of Josef Mengele.\" And each one in turn stood up and said that in\nfront of all the others, in front of Dr. Tuma, including the American specialists from the\nSimon Weisenthal Center and the specialists from the U.S. Department of Justice. And I was\nsitting next to Menachan Russek again who was taking notes uh but was there as strictly an\nobserver, and uh I didn't know what was going through his mind and I don't want to speak\nfor what may have been going through his mind, but I did ask him, \"How do you feel now at\nthis moment, Mr. Ruseck, in light of what you said to me before,\" and he said with that\nwonderful Jewish sense of humor, he looked at me and he said \"Well, better I should stand\non his grave than he on mine.\" And so at the end of this, the press conference was held.\nThe results were announced and the news went out all over the world. And then there was a\nbrief period of sort of silence on the world screen. I mean a lot of people were very skeptical\nat first, who had to re-examine their their feelings in light of this powerful evidence that had\ncome out, but there were...there were others who who had a hard time reaching that point.\nFrankly, uh, you know, I don't claim to have been through the Holocaust the way uh the\nsurvivors from the concentration camps have because I don't think anyone can have that kind\nof a painful and unbelievably cruel experience that they've suffered but uh even from the\nlittle bit that I did, I can certainly see and understand how someone who went through that\nexperience could never accept that in this life a man capable of perpetrating such\nunspeakable cruelties to their fellow human beings as well as to them, could somehow be\nallowed by by fate to die a natural death and not be brought to justice. That anyone who can't\naccept that because of what they've been through because they can't believe that such a thing\ncould occur, I can certainly sympathize with. That's quite different from looking at the\nevidence and looking at the facts because there are many things in feelings that go beyond\nfacts and conclusive evidence and so on.\nIn any case, not too long after that, people started to file their reports from these teams of\nspecialists and in those reports there was another item that occurred while these\nexaminations were going on that I was involved in, because as we were looking there at the\nphotographs and uh people were projecting on the wall the drawings of all these features of\nMengele's face from the photograph and the superimposition with the skull, I noticed in a\nphotograph of the old man that there was a scar right here on the face, and I noticed on the\nskull that was also being projected on the wall, there there was a hole in the bone in roughly\nthe same area, and I was reminded of the fact that the woman...there were two...you know\nthere were two couples who had protected Mengele. The first one were the ones who hid him\nfor something like fourteen years, because he was in Brazil from 1961 until 1979, and the\nfirst fourteen years of that he was hidden by this couple of Austro-Hungarians called Geza\nand Gitta Stammer, and then when finally they split up, that's when the Brosserts came into\nthe picture as his second set of protectors and uh Mrs. Stammer had recounted that for many,\nmany years, Mengele was afraid to leave the house at all. He wouldn't go to any doctors or\ndentists, but that he had a number of times a badly swollen face from an abscessed tooth.\nAnd because Mengele had been a doctor, of course...uh, you know, I shudder to even say the\nword because, you know, a a a sub-human being like that shouldn't use the word doctor even\nif he earned such a degree in school, but in any case he was a physician and so he lanced\nthese boils inside of his mouth a number of times in order to to treat the abscess without\nhaving to go to a doctor, and because I'd been a professor of oral pathology and the head of\nthe Department of Dental Diagnosis at the University of Kentucky and Kentucky 1s a a poor\nstate in which in eastern Kentucky particularly, and in the days that I was there in the '60's,\nthere were hundreds of people who who suffered from a lack of dental treatment, even in\nemergencies, and who would who would have these infections that normally in this country\nnowadays are treated automatically, uh they let them go for months and years at a time and I\nsaw many patients who who would have abscesses that came and went and they never even\nhad the tooth pulled where eventually the infection would break through the bone and enter\nthe sinus above the teeth, you know, the sinuses we have in our head, and uh set up an\ninfection inside the sinuses and then through that hole it would periodically drain, either\ninside the mouth or out, outside on the face, and so because Mrs. Stammer has said that he\nhad several episodes of swollen jaws and face and I saw on this picture being projected on\nthe wall that there was a hole in the bone in about that place and that there was a scar on the\nface on the spot where this what they call a fistulous track, the track where the infection\ndrains out would have occurred and there was similar to what I had seen before with patients\nin Kentucky, that uh that may be a an important link.\nAnd so the uh the American specialists said well, that's very interesting. Why don't you...why\ndon't you come and uh take a look at the skull itself and see whether you, whether you still\nfeel that way, so that's when I uh first went into the room where they had the bones and, you\nknow, I held this skull in my hands to to to look at it, and holding that skull in my hands I\nwas transfixed. I I drifted off into into another state of mind that uh, you know, I had never\nexperienced before and all of a sudden I saw myself standing in a railway station where\n400,000 people were lined up on both sides of the track, standing there with their tattered,\ntorn clothes and their their badly beaten appearance, and I took that skull and I walked down\nthose tracks showing, showing it to everyone there and saying \"Here, behold this skull.\"\nHere we are, all of us, from different worlds at this time, being present at a what...I don't\nknow...this this vision didn't go beyond this. I didn't know the answer, but I showed that skull\nto everyone of those 400 people in the few seconds that it took, in my mind, and then the\nvision passed and I was back with the skull and I saw the hole there and I suggested that this\nwas indeed very much like a maxillary sinus, a sinus of the upper jaw infection and that I\nthought this was consistent. Well, this was an interesting piece of evidence matching what\nsomeone said who had harbored Mengele, with the actual findings in the skull, so the\nAmericans all thought this was very interesting. They all accepted this although none of\nthem had really seen a case like this before. It's so rare nowadays to have people who will let\nsomething like that go for months and years, that uh even these forensic specialists really\nhadn't encountered it,\nand uh here I have to tell you another little story that uh uh was to me has been a very\nmoving one. But that evening I went home and I was talking to Lee about the fact that, you\nknow, I have some cases, and I had some slides of people just like that of uh people who had\nsinus infections draining to the face and that these slides were part of my teaching slides that\nI had used at the University of Kentucky and here it was almost twenty years since I've used\nthem...eighteen years and wouldn't I love to have those slides so I could show the specialists\nthat uh that uh, you know, there was some basis in fact of what I was talking about. Well,\nthese slides were all...I had several thousand slides...six, eight, ten thousand...I don't know\nhow many, and they were all stored in the basement of my mother-in-law who lives in in the\ngreater Washington area, or lived in the greater Washington area and I thought to myself,\n\"How am I going to get these slides. How am I going to get the three or four slides I need\nfrom these ten thousand.\" So I called my dentist in Washington, a friend of mine, good friend\nof mine. His name is Jay Slotkin (ph). He's a periodontist. And he's Jewish and I called him\nup and I said \"Jay, this is what's going on. I wonder if you would mind going to my mother-\nin-law's basement and getting out these ten thousand slides and going through them and\nfinding these slides that I need and sending them to me.\" I was calling him about seven thirty\nor eight o'clock in the evening, and he said \"Well, I'll be glad to do that.\" He says, \"When do\nyou think you would need that.\" I said \"Well, tomorrow morning is when I would need\nthem.\" So he sort of sucked in his breathe for a moment and then he said, \"Alright\" and we\nmade arrangements and he went out to Springfield, Virginia, to the basement of the house\nwhere my mother-in-law lived and he got down from the top shelf all of these boxes of\nslides, and he got a colleague friend of his. The two of them went back to his office and that\nentire night they went through all ten thousand slides that I had until they found the four or\nfive that I needed and the next morning a courier picked them up, gave them to the Pan Am\npilot and they flew them down the next day so that I could show them to the specialists as\nconvincing that uh that uh you know, that I knew what I was talking about.",
        "Q: At this point we need to pause. We'll change tapes.\nTape #2\nTECHNICAL CONVERSATION",
        "Q: OK. We're on. We're back on camera. Uh you're uh dentist friends and colleagues had found\nthese, these slides that you needed...tell us what happened when you received the slides, and\nif you could repeat the question.",
        "A: Well, uh when uh...you know, what happened when I received the slides? Well, uh the\nslides by that point were just a very important sort of final detail that made the American\nspecialists accept the validity of what I had said about the hole 1n the skull. Uh but then that\nwas just one more thing and the press conference went ahead as I said earlier and uh\neverything was closed, but I always felt that I wanted to be sure that Jay Slotkin knew and\nappreciated how important the role he had played in this case because I knew that it had\nmeant a great deal to him. Uh but this was in 1985. I didn't get back to Washington until\n1988, and uh during that time, very sadly Jay uh began to fall ill and has developed a uh this\nrare disease called A-myotropic lateral sclerosis, or Lou Gehrig's Disease. It's the same\ncondition that uh Senator Jacob Javits had not too many years ago. It's an awful thing\nbecause gradually all the muscles become paralyzed and a person eventually has to live in uh\nin uh what amounts to a total iron lung, and be uh be maintained on life support systems, and\ntheir mind of course stays perfectly clear, and uh this has happened to Jay and uh at the end\nof 1990 he is stabilized but in a condition wh...and he's being cared for with a wonderful uh\ngroup of professionals, but he is completely paralyzed, but when I came back in 1988 uh...",
        "Q: Let's let's stay with this if we can. I need to stay with the with the Mengele search sequence,\nif that's all right.",
        "A: Do you want me to finish the story about Jay or not?",
        "Q: All right. If if we could make it brief, yeah. Yeah.",
        "A: Well, I don't have to. It's up to you. Well, I was going to say when I came back through\narrangements with his friends and family I went out to his home and uh it was a very moving\nexperience in telling him this story that I'm telling now as he sat there uh paralyzed and\nlistening to this, so uh, you know, we were all in tears when we finished but I felt uh the\nsatisfaction of knowing that I could at least tell him it first hand, the story of what role he had\nplayed in this case, and it was the first time that I learned the uh meaning of the Yiddish\nword uh mitzvah, which people were telling me that I had done and uh I felt very good about\nthat. Uh but to get back to the sequence of events, uh by the fall or late summer of 1985, it uh\nstarted to become apparent that there was a discrepancy in what the German and Brazilian\ndoctors had written and what the American doctors had written about this hole in the skull\nand about the about the possible sinus infection, because the uh the Americans were the ones\nwho questioned me about it, and it was the Americans who who accepted uh what I had to\nsay, but because it was marginal to the uh...back in June...to the process itself, the Germans\nand the Brazilians never really paid much attention to this little dialogue and in their report\nthey simply wrote that there was an unexplained hole there that uh must have been caused by\nsomething or other, possibly after the death of the individual, so when this discrepancy\nbegan to show up in the published reports, it was apparent that it had to be resolved right\naway. Otherwise it would forever leave a vast gap for people to say that well, there's still\nunresolved questions and so on.\nSo uh they called me from the Justice Department and they said that we'd better go ahead\nand do some pathological studies on this hole to see whether it was something that was\ncaused before death, or after death, and of course that can be done by pathological studies\nbecause you can prepare tissue from the bone to be examined under the microscope and any\nevidence of infection that obviously had to be there before death would still be seen in the\nbones, whereas if 1t was just a fracture or some other break that occurred after the bones were\nburied or the body was buried, then there would be no evidence on the microscope of any\nsigns of infection or inflammation or any other healing process that might have occurred, so\nit's very easy to tell the difference. So I contacted the uh Brazilian pathologist who worked in\nuh association with the coroner's office and uh then I put on my hat of the pathologist instead\nof the Consul General's hat, and then the two of us went ahead and in his laboratory with his\ntechniques and procedures, uh tissue was prepared from uh the skull in this particular area\naround the hole. It was examined under the microscope and it was quite clear that there was\na lot of evidence of bone infection, of what some people call osteomyelitis uh that had\noccurred around this hole and uh then we prepared the photographs and so on and I was able\nto to advise the Justice Department that indeed uh this was something from a dental infection\nand not something that occurred after death.\nWell, this was so important that the Justice Department then reconvened as many of the\nspecialists that they could co...get, to come to the Smithsonian and this was in about January\nof '86, the year following all of these events, and I came up and I put on a little seminar to the\nspecialists who were there, showing the slides and all of the evidence that I had worked up\ntogether with my Brazilian colleague who had done the laboratory work and uh based on\nthat, everyone who was present...the German specialists as well as the American...agreed that\nthis was evidence of a bone infection of osteomyelitis in the in the jaw skull and that uh both\nthe Brazilian and Germans then modified their report to show that. So that closed a small\ngap, uh but it still left the big issue open. I said earlier that the specialists at the end of their\nfirst set of studies said that the probability was more than ninety-five percent, based on the\nevidence they gathered, that this was Josef Mengele. And that's good enough for courts of\nlaw and it's good enough in almost all the cases, but Josef Mengele is not one of almost all\nthe cases. Josef Mengele was very special, and if somehow that ninety-five plus percent\ncould be moved to a hundred, we still had an obligation to try.\nAnd when I was up here at the at the Smithsonian conference, the people at the Justice\nDepartment, and the head of that office is Neil Scher\u2019, uh pointed out to me that the diary\nwhich had been found in the home of Mrs. Brossert when the original police raid occurred at\nthe time in June of 1985 when Mrs. Brossert led people to the cemetery\u201d in Embu for the\nexhumation, that this diary was taken away and was examined by hand-writing specialists\nfrom the two countries, I presume, but that there was quite unanimous agreement by these\nspecialists that this hand-writing in the diary was the hand-writing of Josef Mengele,\nbecause that could be compared with samples of his hand-writing that was available in the\nSS files, which had been guarded in safe-keeping by the Office of Special Investigation at\nthe Justice Department, so we had an authenticated diary which hand-writing experts agreed\nabout that. And in that authenticated diary, Mengele had many references to visits to both\nphysicians and dentists and the one and and so they gave me uh the information about a\nnumber of visits to doctors that eventually after he dared come out of hiding at least on those\noccasions when he had to go to a doctor or a dentist which was in the second half of his\neighteen years in Brazil, uh that he would make notes in this diary. His diary spoke nothing\nabout the war or his personal views about the Holocaust or anything else. His diary was just\na sort of a mechanical writing down of whatever happened to him on any given day to keep\nhim...presumably to stave off boredom. There was no substance. There was no thought.\nThere was no meaning tn these diaries. It was just a little hour by hour log.\nSo in uh...they asked me if I could, if I could ask the Brazilian federal police to track down\nthe doctors and dentists to whom references were made in the diary and I did that and the\npolice was very cooperative and they uh did find a number of these people, some of whom\nuh remembered having treated someone like Josef Mengele uh but of course had no x-rays to\nto go by it. Uh others didn't remember. Others had died or couldn't be found, but the most\nimportant key person was the man who according to the diary had done a root canal\ntreatment on Mengele in uh 1968...excuse me...1978...right, in 1978...and about that\n*Neil M. Scher, Department of Justice, Director of the Office of Special Investigations, Criminal\nDivision. His final report was published in 1992, entitled In the Matter of Josef Mengele: A Report\nto the Attorney General of the United States.\n*The remains of Josef Mengele's body was exhumed on 6 June 1985 from the Nossa Senhora do\nRosario Cemetary in Embu.\nparticular case, Mengele had written in his diary \"...I went to see Dr. Gama\u2019 in Sama\" ...S - A\n-M -A....that was what he wrote. \"I went to see Dr. Men...uh I went to see a dentist by the\nname of Dr. Gama in Sama to have a root canal done and he did this root canal on my upper\nfirst molar, upper tooth and I paid him two thousand cruzieros on the first appointment on\nDecember uh December the 6th, and that uh I went back for a second appointment on\nDecember the 9th and paid another one thousand cruzieros for a second appointment.\" He\nkept close track of how much he was paying people. And so we asked the Brazilian police to\nfind the Dr. Gama also because that might be a person who would have these dental x-rays\nbecause you have to take x-rays to do a root canal. And if we could find an x-ray at...with a\ndentist whose name came from an authenticated diary on which everyone agreed was really\nthat of Josef Mengele, then you would have solid, irrefutable evidence, a chain of evidence.\nUh but the police interviewed a Dr. Gama and uh this Dr. Gama didn't remember anything\nwhatsoever about the case, and that was as far as the police investigation went uh with these\nvarious doctors including this one.\nSo then Neil Scher asked me if I could take this a little further, given that I was a dentist and\nI was down there and and go a little bit further with this Dr. Gama to see whether he might\nremember something, or maybe looking at his charts we could discover some evidence, so I\nwent back and with the agreement and cooperation of the Brazilian federal police, uh I went\nto see Dr. Gama, who in fact was uh very cooperative, and he told me that uh he didn't think\nthat he had anything to do with Mengele because for one thing he didn't do any root canals,\nbut that he referred his root canal patients to another specialist whose name was totally\ndifferent, but in any event he went to see his specialist friend and he retrieved from him all of\nthe charts of patients that he had referred to him in 1978 and 1979 for root canals, and he\nbrought me the charts to look at and there were thirty-five, forty of these, so I went through\nthose uh very quickly to se...and 1t was obvious that none of these uh remotely resembled\nanything that could have been Mengele. If you take forty charts of people who've had root\ncanals, first of all uh over half of them were women. Then of the remaining half uh, you\nknow, half of them had root canals done on their lower teeth, not on their upper teeth, and\nthen of the remaining few and many of them had root canals done on their front teeth, not on\ntheir back teeth, so we only had three charts left of people that this particular Dr. Gama had\nreferred for root canal treatment during the time period in question that matched the diary,\nwho had root canals done on their upper back teeth, and all three of those people were still\nalive and existed in that community and could be found and so that pretty well definitely\nruled out this Dr. Gama on a variety of different grounds.\nSo then the question came up uh well, there must be other Dr. Gama's around, and this 1s\n\u201cDr. Hercy Gonzaga Gama Angelo.\nwhere I began to get really exercised about this case and seeing what I could do to to to take\nit a little bit further, so together with my assistant uh Vice Consul by the name of Fred\nKaplan, we began to to...well, first of all, uh pour over the diary. It was in German and it was\nkind of hard reading. His hand-writing wasn't all that good, but I was trying to get more\ninformation out of there and at the same time trying to find out if there were other Dr.\nGama's in the area, and then we had the, really the top question was what does Sama stand\nfor. He said he went to see Dr. Gama in Sama, but there is no town called Sama in the area of\nSao Paulo and uh there was abundant evidence to prove that Mengele didn't wander very far\naway from his hideout, so he wouldn't have traveled two hundred miles to see a root canal\nspecialist. He would have had it done somewhere close to where he lived, so we uh went to\nall of the different dental associations and uh so on and uh with the help of a dentist uh friend\nof mine in Sao Paulo, we put together the most comprehensive list possible of Dr. Gama's in\nthe state of Sao Paulo. The city of Sao Paulo has a population of about sixteen, seventeen\nmillion people, and the state of Sao Paulo has about thirty-two million people. We are\ntalking about a big area. So we put together this list and we came up with about eighteen\ndentists by the name of Gama, of whom one, of course, was the one I'd interviewed and\nalready ruled out, but of the remaining Gama's, most of them had graduated from dental\nschool after 1979, at least a majority of them had. Uh one had died. One had moved away\nfrom Sao Paulo immediately upon graduation. Uh to make a long story short, there was no\nGama left who could remotely fit the situation that uh we were trying to to clarify.\nSo at the same time I was pouring over this diary and saying now what could Sama stand for.\nWhat could Sama stand for? It's obviously not the name of a town. There is no town by the\nname of Sama. And by reading the diary over and over again, I realized that when it came to\nnames, Mengele was using a bit of a code. When he didn't want a possible reader of his diary\nto know who he was referring to, he would use an abbreviation of using initials. The first\ninitial of the first name, and the first one or two letters of the second name. And so I noticed\nthat there was a repetition of this pattern throughout the diary, and then I started to think of\nSama in terms of how I could interpret that word as a possible abbreviation. And it finally\ncame to me in ain a flash that Sama could very possibly stand for Santo Amaro, the name of\na suburb of Sao Paulo where I was living, and where he was known to have lived with the\nBrosserts and the Stammers. And so I got very excited at this thought, so Fred Kaplan and I\nwent back to the Consulate and we picked up a phone book with yellow pages in it. Now in\nBrazil, the yellow pages are not used very extensively but it was the first thing that was in\nmy way, so I picked it up. A lot of people have unlisted numbers and so on, but uh in any\ncase we looked under dentists in Santo Amaro and there was the name of a Dr. Gama that\nhadn't turned up on any of our lists before.\nSo we made a test phone call there to ask for an appointment and the assistant told us that Dr.\nGama specialized in root canal treatment, so I immediately got back in touch with the\nBrazilian federal police and they gave me an officer to come with me when we went out\nthere. And we went to the office of Dr. Gama who uh, you know, we told him why we were\nthere, and he, of course, remembered the Mengele case from the press uh the year before, but\nhe didn't remember having treated the man six years earlier and of course normally one\nwould not expect him to remember that, because at the time he treated it, there was nothing\nunusual about the matter. The unusual thing was six years later, but that doesn't help you\nremember back to a routine case. He had no reason to dream that he might have been\ninvolved. So he said...well, he said he had eight thousand charts uh but we we said we would\nlike to go through those charts right then and there. It was the police officer and Fred Kaplan\nand I. And I said to him, \"Now we are looking for someone on whom you did a root canal on\nhis upper first molar on December the 6th, 1978, and got two thousand cruzieros, and you\nhad a second appointment and got a thousand cruzieros,\" and he said \"Well, you're welcom\nto go through these charts.\" Now it was a lucky thing that he still had them. Uh in in modern\nmedical and dental practice, of course, it's routine to keep complete records. But years ago it\nwasn't so routine and then less advanced countries as far as medical care is concerned, some\npeople still don't keep records, particularly since there's a there's a tendency not to pay taxes\nand uh so it was a pleasant surprise to see that Dr. Gama had complete records for all of\nthose years, and he had complete charts.\nSo we started going through the charts and it was very easy to go through quickly because he\nhappened to write the date when a first...when a patient first went to him in the upper left\nhand corner of this six by nine cardboard, uh you know, index card, so by looking just in in\nthat corner, we could go through very quickly and eliminate all the people who went to him\nafter January of 1979 when Mengele reportedly died and then we were looking for the other\ndate. And after about thirty, forty minutes, we came across a card that had those\nentries... December the 6th, 1978, first molar, two thousand cruzieros... December the 9th, so\non. And then we turned the card over on the other side and we saw that the name that was\nwritten in there was Pedro Hochbichler, which was the known alias that Mengele had had\nused when he was hiding in Brazil and the address on Estrada Varenga was the same one uh\nthe house where he lived by himself for a number of years when the Brosserts were helping\nhim and protecting him but not harboring him in their own house.\nAs a matter of fact, I I ran into a lady when I gave a a talk in Sao Paulo about Mengele who\ntold me that she had lived in the house next door with her parents and that they used to see\nthis man going for walks every day in front of the house. It looked just like the pictures and\nso on and at that address, but he never spoke to them and he wouldn't greet them back when\nthey said hello and the father wanted to invite him in for coffee or something as a neighbor,\nbut he never accepted and would never speak to them. So here we found this chart. So then,\nuh he was flabbergasted, of course, and fascinated, but he still couldn't remember anything\nabout the man except that the handwriting on the chart was clearly his and he said, \"Yes,\nthat's my hand-writing so, you know, if that's what you wanted, I treated him.\" So we said,\n\"What we really want is to see if you have any of the x-rays,\" and he said, \"Well, no I don't\nbecause I always send the x-rays back to the dentist who referred a patient to me\" and we\nsaid \"Well, who referred this man to you.\" And he looked on his chart and he said, \"Well,\nand that was Dr. Tutiya\u2019.\" Now that's a Japanese name but there are over a million Japanese\nBrazilians living in the Sao Paulo area. It's the largest Japanese community anywhere outside\nof Japan, and there are many, many professionals in the health professions and elsewhere\nwho are second, third generation Japanese, born and living in Brazil as Brazilian citizens.\nAnd in questioning...this is a flashback...but in questioning Mrs. Stammer and Mrs. Brossert\nabout whether they knew of who had been Mengele's dentist when he finally started going to\none again, swore that they couldn't remember the name but that he was a Japanese dentist.\nUh subsequently the Justice Department satisfied itself uh by way of its investigation that uh\nthe women were indeed telling the truth and they did not remember the name, but uh\ndefinitely they remembered that Mengele was referring to a Japanese dentist and once said\nthat he wanted to go to a Japanese dentist because since all Japanese look the same to him,\nhe assumed that Japanese couldn't tell the difference between one Caucasian male and\nanother, which is perfectly consistent with the kind of mentality the man had. So I asked Dr.\nGama \"Where is Dr. Tutiya\" and he said \"Well, he's just a block and a half down the street.\"\nSo we thanked him very much and the three of us walked out of there and crossed the street\nand, you know, the adrenalin was just pumping like crazy and there was a record store there\nthat was playing, you know, loud music on a loud speaker for the street and that sort of\nenhanced the sort of trance-like or movie-like atmosphere as we were, you know, brimming\nwith excitement walking the block and a half involved to get to the office of Mr. Tuttya, Dr.\nTutiya. So we got there. We knocked on the door and uh yes, he was in. And he saw us and\nthe police officer showed him the photograph of Mengele, one of the photographs that had\nbeen found in Mrs. Brassart's house, and he said \"Oh yes. That's the man with a hat.\" And\nthe reason he said that is because in Sao Paulo, it's extremely unusual to wear a hat. People\ndon't wear hats in Sao Paulo, but Mengele wore a hat because many years ago, his first wife\nstill in Germany who subsequently divorced him, but when he was leaving to flee Germany\nand went to Argentina, she said \"Oh, they're going to find you because you have such a high\nforehead that you're going to be easy to find all your life.\" And so in Buenos Aires,\naccording to records that I read, he actually tried to have a hair implant done of the high part\nof his forehead, try to shrink that down, but of course that didn't work. You can't grow hair\non the part of skin that never had hair, so then he started wearing a hat in order to to reduce\nthe size of the visible part of his forehead, so he always wore a hat and these photographs\nwere taken with him wearing a hat and this dentist immediately recognized that.\nDr. Kasumasa Tuttya.\nAnd we asked him if he remembered something about it, and he had a vague recollection but\nbut uh we said \"Well, do you have any records of Pedro Hochbichler.\" So he said \"well, just\na moment.\" And he went in a little room in the back and opened the drawer. ...I could see\nhim from the front room...went through some envelopes and charts and pulled out a chart\njust like that and brought it out and showed us that he had done a great deal of dental\ntreatment for this man, including two partial removable dentures and a lot of other dental\ntreatment, and so we said, \"Well, do you have any x-rays.\" And he said, \"Well, let me go\nback and check\" and then he went back in the room and opened another drawer and was in\nthere for what seemed like an eternity but finally came out with a little brown envelope,\nopened it up and six or seven dental x-rays dropped out on the table and that was a very\nmoving and very emotional moment and uh we uh took the x-rays and the other records with\nus. Of course, this was legally sanctioned by the police officer who was with us, and uh the\ndentist, of course, was also perfectly willing to cooperate and uh I immediately called Neil\nScher in Washington and he had an associate who worked on this case for the whole time, a\nvery fine professional called David Meyerwell (ph). I called them and told them what had\nhappened. Of course, they knew that we were doing this, so they were very excited to hear\nthe results and 1t was Neil Scher who started me on this process.\nUh and then I also called Dr. Lowell Levine, who is an American dental forensic specialist\nwho had been down on the original team in June in Brazil in '85 and did the dental specialty\nwork, and he came back immediately and uh then we had these x-rays which were located\nonly through the decoded information from an authenticated diary of Josef Mengele. There\nwas no other way to find these x-rays. I I used the diary found there. It was authenticated by\nhand-writing experts from Germany and the United States, used the information I gleaned\nfrom there, broke the code in which it was written, and using only and exclusively\ninformation from that authenticated diary, found the dentist and these x-rays. Therefore,\nthese x-rays could be taken with absolute certainty as belonging to Josef Mengele. Then it\nwas only a matter of Dr. Levine coming down and matching those x-rays with the x-rays\ntaken of the skull which had been found in Embu at the time of the exhumation and when\nthere was a hundred percent coincidence in all of the details of those x-rays, that allowed the\ncase to be closed with a hundred percent certainty that should lay to rest in a scientific way\nthe fact that Josef Mengele is dead.",

        "A: My name 1s Stephen Frank Dachi.",
        "A: I was born in Budapest, Hungary, in April of 1933.",
        "A: Well, I was a child of a couple of doctors. My father was a dentist and my mother was a\npediatrician and uh in 1936, when I was not quite three years old, my father passed away in a\nsort of a medical uh mishap and uh then my mother died shortly thereafter, so I was left to be\nraised by my grandparents, uh just before the war started, and my grandparents were living\nin Timisoara, in Romania, so that from Budapest uh I ended up uh going to Timisoara and\nthat's where I went to school and lived until uh after the war in 1948 when we left.",
        "A: Well, uh that small city of about a hundred thousand people was a little bit out of the\nmainstream of the worst of the war and uh life was uh was fairly uh fairly quiet, but uh there\nwere plenty of periods of danger and excitement uh during the war that 1s, when uh...there\nwere uh lots of bombing raids because Timisoara was on the railway line and uh when the\nAllies were bombing the Ploesti oil fields in Romania, they were also bombing the uh\nrailway tracks that were leading the oil away from the area. And then uh once in a while uh\nGerman troops would come through. Uh there weren't any occupying forces there normally.\nOf course, Romania was fighting on the side of the Axis uh powers during the war, but\noccasionally uh some Nazi contingent would come through and uh uh come into town. I\nremember once uh one of their commanders made a speech from the main theater saying that\nthat night there was going to be a Jew hanging from every second window on the main\nsquare, and uh they did round up and take people away. I, I remember in uh going to school\nin the morning sometimes and having my classmates tell about how their fathers were taken\naway in the middle of the night uh almost always never to be seen again. So there was plenty\nof tragedy, plenty of stress and excitement.\nUh we...our family was not Jewish but we were nevertheless uh uh always in danger\nanyway. My grandparents uh were very conscious of having this small boy to raise and my\ngrandmother was always talking about how she had to somehow live uh until I was twenty-\none to uh fulfill her responsibility that she assumed when my parents passed away, but I\nknow uh because they told me that uh, you know, they lived in dread of that knock on the\ndoor in the middle of the night also, and they kept a couple of vials of poison on their\nbedstands, because they told me that they were not going to be taken away, that if the\nGermans came to take them away, they would commit suicide. Uh I don't know what would\nhave happened to me uh but in any case that did not happen. Uh and we uh we lived with\nthat until finally the Russian troops came through in uh in...sometime in the spring or\nsummer of 1944. The Germans were pushed back and uh then we had to start worrying about\nabout the Russians. Uh I was uh I was a Hungarian citizen living in Romania and at the time\nRomania had switched sides and was now fighting on the side of the Russians. Now they\nswitched sides just as the Russians reached the Romanian border, so uh there was not that\nmuch destruction in Romania. Uh but Hungary put up very stiff resistance because the\nHun...uh the Hungarian Nazi uh government was one of uh Hitler's firmest allies. Admiral\nHorthy...",
        "A: Well, because I was a Hungarian citizen and the Hungarians were still fighting on the side of\nthe Nazis, uh the Russians were rounding up Hungarians to take them away uh and so one\nday a Russian soldier came to our house and uh said that I was going to go with him, and my\ngrandmother uh who was a Romanian citizen and was not involved in this so they didn't uh\nask any questions of her...uh said \"Well, you're not taking him away\" and he said \"Well, we\nare, So you better give him a winter coat because he's going far away where it's going to be\ncold.\" So my grandmother, bless her soul, she thought that if she refused to give me a coat\nthat they wouldn't take me away uh but of course they did. So then uh we uh...I was taken to\nthis basement of a police station where the people on that particular day where being\nrounded up, and I recognized some of them and I know that subsequently uh, you know,\nnone of those people that I saw there were ever seen again because we were uh scheduled to\nbe taken away uh to Siberia, but just as uh this round-up was in the...going on and we were\nin there in the basement, the German bombing raid came and there were bombs flying\naround all over the place, exploding right around us and uh glass shattering and uh door\nframes cracking and people...guards, prisoners, everyone was uh was uh lying down on the\nfloor with their heads...hands covering their head and uh, you know, I was eleven years old,\nso I thought this was the time for me to make a getaway so I just climbed out the window\nand ran down the street without worrying about my safety or life...1 mean there were bombs\nfalling right on the street where I was running. Craters would open up in front of me and I\nhad to get around, but I managed to somehow uh get away from there and then I ran to a\nsynagogue uh some distance away and there uh a rabbi took me in and hid me in the\nbasement for several days until uh the the round-up seemed to abate and uh he told me that\nbecause during the war so many people had helped save Jewish lives by hiding people...that\nwas done somewhat more in Romania maybe than in Hungary...uh that he was uh\nreciprocating a little bit, taking some people in now that uh the tide had turned and uh so he\nhe kept me there for a few days and then eventually I went back home uh but decided no one\nwill ever get me again, and uh uh, you know, we always uh slept and sat, whatever, with\nwith a getaway path in mind in case someone came in to get us. To this day, in in any\nrestaurant I go to, I always sit with my back to the wall and facing the door, because deep in\nmy subconscious I'm still on the alert for somebody coming 1n to to get me, so these things\nstay with you forever.",
        "A: Well, uh afterwards uh ...",
        "A: Yes, they uh...the Russians uh didn't come around again to get me, at least, and then the war\nended in '45. I had uh I had a uh an aunt who with her husband had moved to Canada before\nthe war, and so in 1948 we managed to get papers and uh uh got out of there, uh bribing the\nauthorities and having all of our earthly goods taken away from us in exchange for a passport\nand an exit uh visa. Uh we couldn't get our papers at the same time, so I had to uh travel...I\nwent first. I went by myself from Romania all the way to Canada and then later uh my uh my\ngrandmother followed. My grandfather had already died. In those three years, from the end\nof the war until 1948, uh we found out how a few of our family members had perished.\nUh almost all the members of my family died during the war, one way or another. Uh my\nsister...I had a sister who was eight years older than I was who when my parents died chose\nto remain in in Hungary and went to live in a convent, and uh during the war the Nazis sort\nof seized this convent and used the women for housework and uh whatever else...sewing and\nLord knows what what else...and then when uh during the siege of Budapest, they uh...when\nthe Nazis were fleeing Budapest eventually...this was in the winter...uh they took my sister\nand all the other women in the convent with them. My sister already had uh an advanced\ncase of TB they call galloping consumption and so on the truck uh when she got too sick uh\non the road to Austria, they just threw her out on the roadside and left her there to to die in in\nuh the snow, and we found out about this because uh another woman who was on the truck\nwith her who survived came to visit us sometime later to tell us the story, and, you know,\nthat was a common thing that uh many people who survived the Holocaust or the war in\nsome way...at the end of the war they made a special effort to go and visit whenever they\ncould the families of people that that died next to them or that they saw, so that they could\nrecount the circumstances. That happened a lot and we had two or three such visits about\nother relatives as well as my sister. So that was one act of human solidarity that the few\nsurvivors tried to to do as a good turn for the relatives of those who had perished.",
        "A: Fifteen...yes. I was fifteen. Well, when I got to Canada I finished high school and my uncle\nand aunt had helped me get there, and then I went to university and eventually in the '50's uh\nI studied dentistry in at the University of Oregon. That's how I first came to the United\nStates. And then when I got my dental degree in 1956, I did some advanced uh work,\ngraduate work and I got a graduate degree in uh oral pathology, uh specializing in diseases of\nthe mouth and the face and the neck, and then uh I went into uh academic life and was one of\nthe founders of a new college of dentistry at the University of Kentucky in Lexington, where\nfive of us started a new school, really from a from an empty cornfield and at the end of that\nperiod when the first class graduated from there in 1966, I decided to uh to look for let's say\nnew horizons and like so many people uh looked toward a second career. So in 1967 I left\nthe school, left the university and uh initially took a leave of absence and uh joined the staff\nof the Peace Corps and I uh worked as a Peace Corps Deputy Director and then eventually as\na Country Director of the Peace Corps, first in Columbia, then in Venezuela and finally in\nBrazil and uh that turned out to be a very good and uh wonderful learning experience and so\nI, I uh resigned my professorship...can't stay on a leave of absence for ever\n..and uh then I was recruited into the Foreign Service and I became a Foreign Service officer\nwith the United States Information Agency, USIA, which uh has the press and cultural\nsections of American embassies around the world, and they call it USIS...so I worked and\nstayed with them from 1972 until now and I've had a series of assignments around the world\nincluding being uh Cultural Attache in Hungary tn uh in the '70's, and then on loan to the\nDepartment of State as Consul General in Sao Paulo, Brazil in the mid-'80's.",
        "A: Yes. Something...something very extraordinary happened. Uh I remember the day it all\nbegan very clearly. On June the 6th 1985...1t was only about three months after Lee and I,\nmy wife and I, had arrived to Sao Paulo to take up my duties as Consul General and uh the\nphone rang in the morning and it was my press attache, Jim Dandridge, who was calling me\nto tell me that he had heard on the radio and was watching on television at that very time,\nthat there was an exhumation going on uh for the alleged remains of Josef Mengele and that\nhe thought I should uh know about that. And that was quite a...quite a startling way to start a\nday which was the first day off, the first holiday that I'd had since I'd arrived, and all of a\nsudden all of these dim memories came into my mind because I, I really hadn't followed the\nstory of Josef Mengele as closely as perhaps many others had, but it all came back to me in a\nin a flash about a half a million people whose death he was involved with and uh all of the\nmany times that he had been sighted or thought to have been found before. Uh but I didn't\nhave too much time to to think uh you know, long thoughts because uh things, events began\nto cascade uh you know, at a very rapid pace.\nUh I started getting uh phone calls from the Embassy in Brasilia, the capital, from the State\nDepartment in Washington, from television, from networks, from newspapers, uh from\neverywhere because uh, you know, there had been so many times when Mengele had been\nfound and it turned out to be a hoax or false news that uh, you know, if this if this was going\nto be the real thing, there was tremendous interest everywhere, and more specifically as far\nas our government and the Department of State and the Justice Department were concerned.\nUh there had been an agreement signed only recently between the German, Israeli and\nAmerican governments that we would coordinate and cooperate on any further Nazi hunts\nand here uh there was this going on and the U.S. government knew nothing about it, so they\nwere anxious to find out very quickly. And so I began uh right away to to look for my\nGerman counterpart, the German Consul there who was very busy uh with all the events\ngoing on, but I insisted that he meet me and uh he uh he was not anxious to do it, but\neventually uh I didn't...I didn't uh let up and so about midnight that night in a restaurant we\nfinally met and he told me the first part of the story,\nthat a few days earlier German uh police had raided the home of Hans SeidImeier, who was a\nmanager of the Mengele family enterprises in GUnzburg what was then West Germany, and\nuh had found some papers, notes, letters with some addresses on them indicating that uh uh\nwhere Mengele either was or had been, so without any knowledge as to whether he was alive\nor dead, the German authorities immediately came to Brazil, contacted the Federal police\nand had staked out this house uh whose address they they gleaned from this information, but\nafter a few days of staking the house out and not seeing any any old man who looked uh he\nwould possibly in uh Josef Mengele's category of age group or whatever, they raided the\nhouse\nand uh and uh came upon this couple, Wolfgang and Lisalotte Brossert, uh who were\nGerman Brazilians and who uh quickly admitted that they had had a role in in uh sheltering\nand protecting Josef Mengele for the last few years of his life according to the story they told\nand that when he died by drowning on the beach...he was with them at this beach...that he\nhad had a stroke while he was uh...this is what she said...that he had had a stroke while he\nwas swimming there in this beach town of Bertioga, and uh that uh he therefore drowned\nbecause he couldn't get out of the water, and Mrs. Brossert uh decided right there that she\ndidn't want to expose and reveal the whole story of of Mengele's hiding and so on and their\nrole in it most importantly, so she went to some length to bury him under a false name and\nby bending some rules about the identification of the dead and so on, buried him there some\nuh five or six years before and uh now took the authorities there for the exhumation and was\nquite uh forthcoming with information. Uh...",
        "A: You mean to to give the information now?...Well, I think she thought the game was up. I\nthink that uh it was uh...she had to make a choice as to whether she was going to try to uh\nkeep up with a whole new package of lies and deception, and I think she probably decided\nright away that that would be impossible and it would be too complicated and that uh that\nshe couldn't get away with it so I think uh from the beginning she decided uh to cooperate. In\nother words, she made a decision to bury him under false name, hoping that somehow uh\nthat would do it, but once once she saw that the game was up, one one of the things uh she\nsaid when they first raided her house apparently by...according to press reports, was uh \"I\ndidn't think it would take you this long to uh to get here.\"\nSo uh...but in in the house there, aside from the various uh uh stories that she told, they also\nfound some photographs. They found a diary that was allegedly that of Mengele that was\ntaken away by hand-writing experts, and uh and some other memorabilia and then she told\nmany stories about Mengele's son having come to visit both when Mengele was still alive\nand after he died, he came to retrieve some of his possessions, including part of the diary, but\nshe didn't tell him about another part that she kept, so the diary ended up being divided into\ntwo two parts. Uh in any event, uh when they exhumed these what were essentially were just\nbones, then the big project began. Is it him, or isn't it him\u2019? And how do you, how do you\nidentify a set of bones that have been buried not too many years ago archaeologically\nspeaking, but quite a few years ago, five or six years. So uh there there were a lot of a lot of\nsensitive factors involved. First of all, this exhumation took place in Brazil and the Brazilian\ngovernment and, to some extent, the Brazilian medical experts were very eager to prove that\nthey were fully competent to do such an examination and uh and the Brazilian government\nwas very eager to prove that they didn't need any foreigners interfering 1n their internal\nbusiness, so at first they said that they wouldn't give any visas to foreign specialists to\nparticipate in the identification and I received a call from Washington that day telling me that\nI'd better go in quickly and speak to the Chief of Police uh to to see 1f we could persuade him\nto change his mind, because uh these people had to come in, so I went uh the very next\nmorning to call on uh a man who now its has a very widely-known name around the\nworld....Romeu Tuma, who at that time was the Chief of the Sao Paulo Police.\nNow he's the chief of the Federal police for all of Brazil. And I had met him before. I didn't\nknow him well. As I was riding down in the car to see him and I was thinking just what what\nwould I say, you know, so I got there. He was a very...he's a very decent, nice man. Uh a\nvery unusual human being. A very unusual policeman, and I said to him, Dr. Tuma, I uh I\nwas born and raised in eastern Europe also and most of my family perished in the war and in\nthe Holocaust, and this man that we're talking about here, uh is responsible for the death of at\nleast 400,000 people. Four hundred thousand people. And I said that relatives and the\nsurvivors and all of their kin, all of the human beings who have shared this terrible historical\ntragedy, are scattered all over the world and their wounds in many, many, many cases\nhaven't healed yet, and they never will until they know what happened to that man, and even\nthen those wounds will only heal very superficially.\nBut Dr. Tuma, all of those people around the world have a right to be present here when we\ngo through this process. They have a right to be witnesses, to be present at the most\nimportant identification that we could do in our lifetimes, any one of us. They deserve to be\nhere and these specialists coming from other countries are coming here on their behalf:\nThey're coming here on behalf of all of mankind that suffered this horrible tragedy. And to\nDr. Tuma's great credit, he immediately sensed and understood this, and he immediately said\nyes and the the little mini-crisis was over and the people came and we could begin a more\nthorough approach of international cooperation 1n solving this vitally important puzzle,\nSo several groups came. There were quite a few specialists who came from Germany to join\nthose who had been there initially who were mostly policemen. And then there was a group\nof forensic specialists who were contracted by the Justice Department which uh in the last, in\nthe previous few years had inaugurated an Office of Special Investigations, specializing in\nuh pursuing Nazi uh war criminals and Nazi questions. I think that office was established\nduring the presidency of Jimmy Carter. And uh the U.S. Marshall's Service and the Justice\nDepartment also sent uh fingerprint experts and hand-writing experts and other such\nspecialists. And then the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles who retained the services\nof an independent, private group of forensic specialists, some of whom who had played very\nimportant roles in the identification of the disappeared Argentine citizens after the dirty war\nthere in the '70's where several thousand people disappeared without a trace, and also the\nJustice Department specialists were very experienced in in these world famous cases, so\nthese uh people all began to to arrive and showed up and the Israeli government sent an\nobserver whose name was Menachem Russek\u2019, who I think worked for their Justice\nDepartment, to follow events,\nand I remember vividly the first meeting that Dr. Tuma had with all of these newly arrived\nspecialists and their Brazilian counterparts, trying to organize and plan how this process\nwould be done, and I had already met most of them but I hadn't met Mr. Russek, so at the\nend of the meeting as people were walking out, I followed Mr. Russek and I went up to him\nand he was a short man with with silver hair, very ruddy cheeks and quite a spring 1n his step\nand he was walking out the building and I was sort of walking behind him, and I introduced\nmyself. I told him who I was and I said to Mr. Russek, I said, \"I hope that uh we can do this\nwhole process well enough to reach a satisfactory and scientifically acceptable outcome. I\nknow how much that means to you and how much it means to all of mankind.\" And up to\nthen he'd been sort of walking along and when I said that, he stopped and he turned and\nlooked me in the eye and he pondered the matter for a moment and then he said, \"The first\ntime I had the pleasure of meeting Dr. Josef Mengele in person was in Auschwitz in 1945\nand I certainly hope to have the pleasure to meet him in person one more time,\" and with that\nhe stopped and turned again and walked right out, but to me in those few words, the whole\ndrama, the whole tragedy, the whole sensitivity of this case came to life in such a powerful\nway that uh, you know, that the feeling that people have, the need that people have that\nsomehow Justice should be done...now you can't do justice with a man who's killed 400,000\npeople, but you can do the close...closest thing to it no matter how distant. You can somehow\nclose the circle, and if this man in fact died of a natural death without having been brought to\njustice, then at least let's be clear about the fact that he really 1s dead and close the circle in\nthat small but very important way.\nWell, uh then the work began. Now I was still only an observer at the time, although uh\npeople knew that I had been an oral pathologist uh at that time I was still the Consul General\nfollowing events for the U.S. government as part of the agreement that existed. And the\nspecialists went to work uh doing those things that can be done. Now the two basic ways in\nwhich remains can be identified are fingerprints, which of course don't exist when only\nbones remain, and dental x-rays, but in order to use dental x-rays to identify remains, you not\nonly have to have x-rays taken from the skull of the remains but you have to have x-rays\n\u2018Menachem Russek, an Israeli police superintendent charged by the Israeli government with the\ntask of tracking war criminals.\nfrom the person known to be the one we're seeking to identify that were in some authentic\nfile prior to his death, and by comparing the two you would have one of the most accurate\nand reliable ways of identifying remains that are currently known to medical science.\nUnfortunately, there were no such x-rays available in Mengele's Gestapo files or anywhere\nelse. The only thing that was available in those files was a dental chart which uh from my\nstandpoint as a dentist and with a with a knowledge in dental charting of of the 1980's was\nuh extremely incomplete. The only thing that chart had was an indication of which teeth that\nMengele had examined at the time he entered the SS in uh 1939, which teeth were present\nand which teeth were absent. That was the only thing on that chart. Now had a tooth in the\nskull...had there been a tooth in the skull that was present in the skull which was marked as\nmissing in 1939, it would have been proof positive that this was not the skull of Josef\nMengele, but there was no such tooth. Uh and other than that one feature, the chart was of no\nvalue because he obviously lost quite a number of teeth between 1939 and whenever he died\nor whenever this skull was being examined, but that was of no value in comparing it to the\nchart,\nso uh the specialists on these teams went ahead and did some various anthropological\nexaminations that showed that these bones belonged to an old man, that he was a Caucasian\nmale and not of some other racial origin, that his height was extremely close to the height\nthat Mengele was known to have had, and uh there were a number of other examinations\ncarried out on the bone bones, that were consistent with with Mengele. But the the really\nvery important examination that was done was was a procedure called craniometry, in which\nwhich is a also very accurate procedure. It just hasn't been around long enough to hold up in\ncourt the way dental x-rays would but nonetheless is very uh very accurate in which a\nnumber of features of the face, angles and sizes of ear lobes and the corner of the nose, the\nangle of the bridge of the nose and the lips, the chin and so on, are measured. And then with\na scientific measurement can be compared to an overlap and uh this was done with great care\nthere, and it was shown by comparing the photograph of the young Mengele from the SS\nfiles with the photograph of the old man that was found in Mrs. Brossert's house, that all of\nthese features matched perfectly and then by superimposing these same features on the skull,\nwhich is part of this technique, it was shown that all of these measurements and features\ncoincided between the photograph of the young man and the old man and between both of\nthese photographs and the skull. So between this very powerful positive identification\nevidence, the other things, the measurements that were taken on the bones and the fact that\nmany things matched with what was known about Mengele, all of the specialists there uh\nagreed that there was more than ninety-five percent chance that these remains were\ndefinitely those of Josef Mengele and uh the American specialists in particular said that with\ntheir extensive experience in court testimony, that that evidence was completely sufficient in\nany American court of law, it would be considered conclusive proof that these remains were\nthat of Josef Mengele.\nSo based on that, they decided to call a press conference and announce the results and I\nremember very vividly a meeting that was held just before the press conference in which Dr.\nTuma had gathered all of the people involved in this procedure, and at the end of this whole\nprocess and he said \"Now I would like each of you individually to stand up and tell me what\nyour findings are.\" And he went around the room and each individual stood up and said \"Dr.\nTuma, based on the examination that I've performed and the data that I have seen, I believe\nthat these are the remains of Josef Mengele.\" And each one in turn stood up and said that in\nfront of all the others, in front of Dr. Tuma, including the American specialists from the\nSimon Weisenthal Center and the specialists from the U.S. Department of Justice. And I was\nsitting next to Menachan Russek again who was taking notes uh but was there as strictly an\nobserver, and uh I didn't know what was going through his mind and I don't want to speak\nfor what may have been going through his mind, but I did ask him, \"How do you feel now at\nthis moment, Mr. Ruseck, in light of what you said to me before,\" and he said with that\nwonderful Jewish sense of humor, he looked at me and he said \"Well, better I should stand\non his grave than he on mine.\" And so at the end of this, the press conference was held.\nThe results were announced and the news went out all over the world. And then there was a\nbrief period of sort of silence on the world screen. I mean a lot of people were very skeptical\nat first, who had to re-examine their their feelings in light of this powerful evidence that had\ncome out, but there were...there were others who who had a hard time reaching that point.\nFrankly, uh, you know, I don't claim to have been through the Holocaust the way uh the\nsurvivors from the concentration camps have because I don't think anyone can have that kind\nof a painful and unbelievably cruel experience that they've suffered but uh even from the\nlittle bit that I did, I can certainly see and understand how someone who went through that\nexperience could never accept that in this life a man capable of perpetrating such\nunspeakable cruelties to their fellow human beings as well as to them, could somehow be\nallowed by by fate to die a natural death and not be brought to justice. That anyone who can't\naccept that because of what they've been through because they can't believe that such a thing\ncould occur, I can certainly sympathize with. That's quite different from looking at the\nevidence and looking at the facts because there are many things in feelings that go beyond\nfacts and conclusive evidence and so on.\nIn any case, not too long after that, people started to file their reports from these teams of\nspecialists and in those reports there was another item that occurred while these\nexaminations were going on that I was involved in, because as we were looking there at the\nphotographs and uh people were projecting on the wall the drawings of all these features of\nMengele's face from the photograph and the superimposition with the skull, I noticed in a\nphotograph of the old man that there was a scar right here on the face, and I noticed on the\nskull that was also being projected on the wall, there there was a hole in the bone in roughly\nthe same area, and I was reminded of the fact that the woman...there were two...you know\nthere were two couples who had protected Mengele. The first one were the ones who hid him\nfor something like fourteen years, because he was in Brazil from 1961 until 1979, and the\nfirst fourteen years of that he was hidden by this couple of Austro-Hungarians called Geza\nand Gitta Stammer, and then when finally they split up, that's when the Brosserts came into\nthe picture as his second set of protectors and uh Mrs. Stammer had recounted that for many,\nmany years, Mengele was afraid to leave the house at all. He wouldn't go to any doctors or\ndentists, but that he had a number of times a badly swollen face from an abscessed tooth.\nAnd because Mengele had been a doctor, of course...uh, you know, I shudder to even say the\nword because, you know, a a a sub-human being like that shouldn't use the word doctor even\nif he earned such a degree in school, but in any case he was a physician and so he lanced\nthese boils inside of his mouth a number of times in order to to treat the abscess without\nhaving to go to a doctor, and because I'd been a professor of oral pathology and the head of\nthe Department of Dental Diagnosis at the University of Kentucky and Kentucky 1s a a poor\nstate in which in eastern Kentucky particularly, and in the days that I was there in the '60's,\nthere were hundreds of people who who suffered from a lack of dental treatment, even in\nemergencies, and who would who would have these infections that normally in this country\nnowadays are treated automatically, uh they let them go for months and years at a time and I\nsaw many patients who who would have abscesses that came and went and they never even\nhad the tooth pulled where eventually the infection would break through the bone and enter\nthe sinus above the teeth, you know, the sinuses we have in our head, and uh set up an\ninfection inside the sinuses and then through that hole it would periodically drain, either\ninside the mouth or out, outside on the face, and so because Mrs. Stammer has said that he\nhad several episodes of swollen jaws and face and I saw on this picture being projected on\nthe wall that there was a hole in the bone in about that place and that there was a scar on the\nface on the spot where this what they call a fistulous track, the track where the infection\ndrains out would have occurred and there was similar to what I had seen before with patients\nin Kentucky, that uh that may be a an important link.\nAnd so the uh the American specialists said well, that's very interesting. Why don't you...why\ndon't you come and uh take a look at the skull itself and see whether you, whether you still\nfeel that way, so that's when I uh first went into the room where they had the bones and, you\nknow, I held this skull in my hands to to to look at it, and holding that skull in my hands I\nwas transfixed. I I drifted off into into another state of mind that uh, you know, I had never\nexperienced before and all of a sudden I saw myself standing in a railway station where\n400,000 people were lined up on both sides of the track, standing there with their tattered,\ntorn clothes and their their badly beaten appearance, and I took that skull and I walked down\nthose tracks showing, showing it to everyone there and saying \"Here, behold this skull.\"\nHere we are, all of us, from different worlds at this time, being present at a what...I don't\nknow...this this vision didn't go beyond this. I didn't know the answer, but I showed that skull\nto everyone of those 400 people in the few seconds that it took, in my mind, and then the\nvision passed and I was back with the skull and I saw the hole there and I suggested that this\nwas indeed very much like a maxillary sinus, a sinus of the upper jaw infection and that I\nthought this was consistent. Well, this was an interesting piece of evidence matching what\nsomeone said who had harbored Mengele, with the actual findings in the skull, so the\nAmericans all thought this was very interesting. They all accepted this although none of\nthem had really seen a case like this before. It's so rare nowadays to have people who will let\nsomething like that go for months and years, that uh even these forensic specialists really\nhadn't encountered it,\nand uh here I have to tell you another little story that uh uh was to me has been a very\nmoving one. But that evening I went home and I was talking to Lee about the fact that, you\nknow, I have some cases, and I had some slides of people just like that of uh people who had\nsinus infections draining to the face and that these slides were part of my teaching slides that\nI had used at the University of Kentucky and here it was almost twenty years since I've used\nthem...eighteen years and wouldn't I love to have those slides so I could show the specialists\nthat uh that uh, you know, there was some basis in fact of what I was talking about. Well,\nthese slides were all...I had several thousand slides...six, eight, ten thousand...I don't know\nhow many, and they were all stored in the basement of my mother-in-law who lives in in the\ngreater Washington area, or lived in the greater Washington area and I thought to myself,\n\"How am I going to get these slides. How am I going to get the three or four slides I need\nfrom these ten thousand.\" So I called my dentist in Washington, a friend of mine, good friend\nof mine. His name is Jay Slotkin (ph). He's a periodontist. And he's Jewish and I called him\nup and I said \"Jay, this is what's going on. I wonder if you would mind going to my mother-\nin-law's basement and getting out these ten thousand slides and going through them and\nfinding these slides that I need and sending them to me.\" I was calling him about seven thirty\nor eight o'clock in the evening, and he said \"Well, I'll be glad to do that.\" He says, \"When do\nyou think you would need that.\" I said \"Well, tomorrow morning is when I would need\nthem.\" So he sort of sucked in his breathe for a moment and then he said, \"Alright\" and we\nmade arrangements and he went out to Springfield, Virginia, to the basement of the house\nwhere my mother-in-law lived and he got down from the top shelf all of these boxes of\nslides, and he got a colleague friend of his. The two of them went back to his office and that\nentire night they went through all ten thousand slides that I had until they found the four or\nfive that I needed and the next morning a courier picked them up, gave them to the Pan Am\npilot and they flew them down the next day so that I could show them to the specialists as\nconvincing that uh that uh you know, that I knew what I was talking about.\nTape #2\nTECHNICAL CONVERSATION",
        "A: Well, uh when uh...you know, what happened when I received the slides? Well, uh the\nslides by that point were just a very important sort of final detail that made the American\nspecialists accept the validity of what I had said about the hole 1n the skull. Uh but then that\nwas just one more thing and the press conference went ahead as I said earlier and uh\neverything was closed, but I always felt that I wanted to be sure that Jay Slotkin knew and\nappreciated how important the role he had played in this case because I knew that it had\nmeant a great deal to him. Uh but this was in 1985. I didn't get back to Washington until\n1988, and uh during that time, very sadly Jay uh began to fall ill and has developed a uh this\nrare disease called A-myotropic lateral sclerosis, or Lou Gehrig's Disease. It's the same\ncondition that uh Senator Jacob Javits had not too many years ago. It's an awful thing\nbecause gradually all the muscles become paralyzed and a person eventually has to live in uh\nin uh what amounts to a total iron lung, and be uh be maintained on life support systems, and\ntheir mind of course stays perfectly clear, and uh this has happened to Jay and uh at the end\nof 1990 he is stabilized but in a condition wh...and he's being cared for with a wonderful uh\ngroup of professionals, but he is completely paralyzed, but when I came back in 1988 uh...",
        "A: Do you want me to finish the story about Jay or not?",
        "A: Well, I don't have to. It's up to you. Well, I was going to say when I came back through\narrangements with his friends and family I went out to his home and uh it was a very moving\nexperience in telling him this story that I'm telling now as he sat there uh paralyzed and\nlistening to this, so uh, you know, we were all in tears when we finished but I felt uh the\nsatisfaction of knowing that I could at least tell him it first hand, the story of what role he had\nplayed in this case, and it was the first time that I learned the uh meaning of the Yiddish\nword uh mitzvah, which people were telling me that I had done and uh I felt very good about\nthat. Uh but to get back to the sequence of events, uh by the fall or late summer of 1985, it uh\nstarted to become apparent that there was a discrepancy in what the German and Brazilian\ndoctors had written and what the American doctors had written about this hole in the skull\nand about the about the possible sinus infection, because the uh the Americans were the ones\nwho questioned me about it, and it was the Americans who who accepted uh what I had to\nsay, but because it was marginal to the uh...back in June...to the process itself, the Germans\nand the Brazilians never really paid much attention to this little dialogue and in their report\nthey simply wrote that there was an unexplained hole there that uh must have been caused by\nsomething or other, possibly after the death of the individual, so when this discrepancy\nbegan to show up in the published reports, it was apparent that it had to be resolved right\naway. Otherwise it would forever leave a vast gap for people to say that well, there's still\nunresolved questions and so on.\nSo uh they called me from the Justice Department and they said that we'd better go ahead\nand do some pathological studies on this hole to see whether it was something that was\ncaused before death, or after death, and of course that can be done by pathological studies\nbecause you can prepare tissue from the bone to be examined under the microscope and any\nevidence of infection that obviously had to be there before death would still be seen in the\nbones, whereas if 1t was just a fracture or some other break that occurred after the bones were\nburied or the body was buried, then there would be no evidence on the microscope of any\nsigns of infection or inflammation or any other healing process that might have occurred, so\nit's very easy to tell the difference. So I contacted the uh Brazilian pathologist who worked in\nuh association with the coroner's office and uh then I put on my hat of the pathologist instead\nof the Consul General's hat, and then the two of us went ahead and in his laboratory with his\ntechniques and procedures, uh tissue was prepared from uh the skull in this particular area\naround the hole. It was examined under the microscope and it was quite clear that there was\na lot of evidence of bone infection, of what some people call osteomyelitis uh that had\noccurred around this hole and uh then we prepared the photographs and so on and I was able\nto to advise the Justice Department that indeed uh this was something from a dental infection\nand not something that occurred after death.\nWell, this was so important that the Justice Department then reconvened as many of the\nspecialists that they could co...get, to come to the Smithsonian and this was in about January\nof '86, the year following all of these events, and I came up and I put on a little seminar to the\nspecialists who were there, showing the slides and all of the evidence that I had worked up\ntogether with my Brazilian colleague who had done the laboratory work and uh based on\nthat, everyone who was present...the German specialists as well as the American...agreed that\nthis was evidence of a bone infection of osteomyelitis in the in the jaw skull and that uh both\nthe Brazilian and Germans then modified their report to show that. So that closed a small\ngap, uh but it still left the big issue open. I said earlier that the specialists at the end of their\nfirst set of studies said that the probability was more than ninety-five percent, based on the\nevidence they gathered, that this was Josef Mengele. And that's good enough for courts of\nlaw and it's good enough in almost all the cases, but Josef Mengele is not one of almost all\nthe cases. Josef Mengele was very special, and if somehow that ninety-five plus percent\ncould be moved to a hundred, we still had an obligation to try.\nAnd when I was up here at the at the Smithsonian conference, the people at the Justice\nDepartment, and the head of that office is Neil Scher\u2019, uh pointed out to me that the diary\nwhich had been found in the home of Mrs. Brossert when the original police raid occurred at\nthe time in June of 1985 when Mrs. Brossert led people to the cemetery\u201d in Embu for the\nexhumation, that this diary was taken away and was examined by hand-writing specialists\nfrom the two countries, I presume, but that there was quite unanimous agreement by these\nspecialists that this hand-writing in the diary was the hand-writing of Josef Mengele,\nbecause that could be compared with samples of his hand-writing that was available in the\nSS files, which had been guarded in safe-keeping by the Office of Special Investigation at\nthe Justice Department, so we had an authenticated diary which hand-writing experts agreed\nabout that. And in that authenticated diary, Mengele had many references to visits to both\nphysicians and dentists and the one and and so they gave me uh the information about a\nnumber of visits to doctors that eventually after he dared come out of hiding at least on those\noccasions when he had to go to a doctor or a dentist which was in the second half of his\neighteen years in Brazil, uh that he would make notes in this diary. His diary spoke nothing\nabout the war or his personal views about the Holocaust or anything else. His diary was just\na sort of a mechanical writing down of whatever happened to him on any given day to keep\nhim...presumably to stave off boredom. There was no substance. There was no thought.\nThere was no meaning tn these diaries. It was just a little hour by hour log.\nSo in uh...they asked me if I could, if I could ask the Brazilian federal police to track down\nthe doctors and dentists to whom references were made in the diary and I did that and the\npolice was very cooperative and they uh did find a number of these people, some of whom\nuh remembered having treated someone like Josef Mengele uh but of course had no x-rays to\nto go by it. Uh others didn't remember. Others had died or couldn't be found, but the most\nimportant key person was the man who according to the diary had done a root canal\ntreatment on Mengele in uh 1968...excuse me...1978...right, in 1978...and about that\n*Neil M. Scher, Department of Justice, Director of the Office of Special Investigations, Criminal\nDivision. His final report was published in 1992, entitled In the Matter of Josef Mengele: A Report\nto the Attorney General of the United States.\n*The remains of Josef Mengele's body was exhumed on 6 June 1985 from the Nossa Senhora do\nRosario Cemetary in Embu.\nparticular case, Mengele had written in his diary \"...I went to see Dr. Gama\u2019 in Sama\" ...S - A\n-M -A....that was what he wrote. \"I went to see Dr. Men...uh I went to see a dentist by the\nname of Dr. Gama in Sama to have a root canal done and he did this root canal on my upper\nfirst molar, upper tooth and I paid him two thousand cruzieros on the first appointment on\nDecember uh December the 6th, and that uh I went back for a second appointment on\nDecember the 9th and paid another one thousand cruzieros for a second appointment.\" He\nkept close track of how much he was paying people. And so we asked the Brazilian police to\nfind the Dr. Gama also because that might be a person who would have these dental x-rays\nbecause you have to take x-rays to do a root canal. And if we could find an x-ray at...with a\ndentist whose name came from an authenticated diary on which everyone agreed was really\nthat of Josef Mengele, then you would have solid, irrefutable evidence, a chain of evidence.\nUh but the police interviewed a Dr. Gama and uh this Dr. Gama didn't remember anything\nwhatsoever about the case, and that was as far as the police investigation went uh with these\nvarious doctors including this one.\nSo then Neil Scher asked me if I could take this a little further, given that I was a dentist and\nI was down there and and go a little bit further with this Dr. Gama to see whether he might\nremember something, or maybe looking at his charts we could discover some evidence, so I\nwent back and with the agreement and cooperation of the Brazilian federal police, uh I went\nto see Dr. Gama, who in fact was uh very cooperative, and he told me that uh he didn't think\nthat he had anything to do with Mengele because for one thing he didn't do any root canals,\nbut that he referred his root canal patients to another specialist whose name was totally\ndifferent, but in any event he went to see his specialist friend and he retrieved from him all of\nthe charts of patients that he had referred to him in 1978 and 1979 for root canals, and he\nbrought me the charts to look at and there were thirty-five, forty of these, so I went through\nthose uh very quickly to se...and 1t was obvious that none of these uh remotely resembled\nanything that could have been Mengele. If you take forty charts of people who've had root\ncanals, first of all uh over half of them were women. Then of the remaining half uh, you\nknow, half of them had root canals done on their lower teeth, not on their upper teeth, and\nthen of the remaining few and many of them had root canals done on their front teeth, not on\ntheir back teeth, so we only had three charts left of people that this particular Dr. Gama had\nreferred for root canal treatment during the time period in question that matched the diary,\nwho had root canals done on their upper back teeth, and all three of those people were still\nalive and existed in that community and could be found and so that pretty well definitely\nruled out this Dr. Gama on a variety of different grounds.\nSo then the question came up uh well, there must be other Dr. Gama's around, and this 1s\n\u201cDr. Hercy Gonzaga Gama Angelo.\nwhere I began to get really exercised about this case and seeing what I could do to to to take\nit a little bit further, so together with my assistant uh Vice Consul by the name of Fred\nKaplan, we began to to...well, first of all, uh pour over the diary. It was in German and it was\nkind of hard reading. His hand-writing wasn't all that good, but I was trying to get more\ninformation out of there and at the same time trying to find out if there were other Dr.\nGama's in the area, and then we had the, really the top question was what does Sama stand\nfor. He said he went to see Dr. Gama in Sama, but there is no town called Sama in the area of\nSao Paulo and uh there was abundant evidence to prove that Mengele didn't wander very far\naway from his hideout, so he wouldn't have traveled two hundred miles to see a root canal\nspecialist. He would have had it done somewhere close to where he lived, so we uh went to\nall of the different dental associations and uh so on and uh with the help of a dentist uh friend\nof mine in Sao Paulo, we put together the most comprehensive list possible of Dr. Gama's in\nthe state of Sao Paulo. The city of Sao Paulo has a population of about sixteen, seventeen\nmillion people, and the state of Sao Paulo has about thirty-two million people. We are\ntalking about a big area. So we put together this list and we came up with about eighteen\ndentists by the name of Gama, of whom one, of course, was the one I'd interviewed and\nalready ruled out, but of the remaining Gama's, most of them had graduated from dental\nschool after 1979, at least a majority of them had. Uh one had died. One had moved away\nfrom Sao Paulo immediately upon graduation. Uh to make a long story short, there was no\nGama left who could remotely fit the situation that uh we were trying to to clarify.\nSo at the same time I was pouring over this diary and saying now what could Sama stand for.\nWhat could Sama stand for? It's obviously not the name of a town. There is no town by the\nname of Sama. And by reading the diary over and over again, I realized that when it came to\nnames, Mengele was using a bit of a code. When he didn't want a possible reader of his diary\nto know who he was referring to, he would use an abbreviation of using initials. The first\ninitial of the first name, and the first one or two letters of the second name. And so I noticed\nthat there was a repetition of this pattern throughout the diary, and then I started to think of\nSama in terms of how I could interpret that word as a possible abbreviation. And it finally\ncame to me in ain a flash that Sama could very possibly stand for Santo Amaro, the name of\na suburb of Sao Paulo where I was living, and where he was known to have lived with the\nBrosserts and the Stammers. And so I got very excited at this thought, so Fred Kaplan and I\nwent back to the Consulate and we picked up a phone book with yellow pages in it. Now in\nBrazil, the yellow pages are not used very extensively but it was the first thing that was in\nmy way, so I picked it up. A lot of people have unlisted numbers and so on, but uh in any\ncase we looked under dentists in Santo Amaro and there was the name of a Dr. Gama that\nhadn't turned up on any of our lists before.\nSo we made a test phone call there to ask for an appointment and the assistant told us that Dr.\nGama specialized in root canal treatment, so I immediately got back in touch with the\nBrazilian federal police and they gave me an officer to come with me when we went out\nthere. And we went to the office of Dr. Gama who uh, you know, we told him why we were\nthere, and he, of course, remembered the Mengele case from the press uh the year before, but\nhe didn't remember having treated the man six years earlier and of course normally one\nwould not expect him to remember that, because at the time he treated it, there was nothing\nunusual about the matter. The unusual thing was six years later, but that doesn't help you\nremember back to a routine case. He had no reason to dream that he might have been\ninvolved. So he said...well, he said he had eight thousand charts uh but we we said we would\nlike to go through those charts right then and there. It was the police officer and Fred Kaplan\nand I. And I said to him, \"Now we are looking for someone on whom you did a root canal on\nhis upper first molar on December the 6th, 1978, and got two thousand cruzieros, and you\nhad a second appointment and got a thousand cruzieros,\" and he said \"Well, you're welcom\nto go through these charts.\" Now it was a lucky thing that he still had them. Uh in in modern\nmedical and dental practice, of course, it's routine to keep complete records. But years ago it\nwasn't so routine and then less advanced countries as far as medical care is concerned, some\npeople still don't keep records, particularly since there's a there's a tendency not to pay taxes\nand uh so it was a pleasant surprise to see that Dr. Gama had complete records for all of\nthose years, and he had complete charts.\nSo we started going through the charts and it was very easy to go through quickly because he\nhappened to write the date when a first...when a patient first went to him in the upper left\nhand corner of this six by nine cardboard, uh you know, index card, so by looking just in in\nthat corner, we could go through very quickly and eliminate all the people who went to him\nafter January of 1979 when Mengele reportedly died and then we were looking for the other\ndate. And after about thirty, forty minutes, we came across a card that had those\nentries... December the 6th, 1978, first molar, two thousand cruzieros... December the 9th, so\non. And then we turned the card over on the other side and we saw that the name that was\nwritten in there was Pedro Hochbichler, which was the known alias that Mengele had had\nused when he was hiding in Brazil and the address on Estrada Varenga was the same one uh\nthe house where he lived by himself for a number of years when the Brosserts were helping\nhim and protecting him but not harboring him in their own house.\nAs a matter of fact, I I ran into a lady when I gave a a talk in Sao Paulo about Mengele who\ntold me that she had lived in the house next door with her parents and that they used to see\nthis man going for walks every day in front of the house. It looked just like the pictures and\nso on and at that address, but he never spoke to them and he wouldn't greet them back when\nthey said hello and the father wanted to invite him in for coffee or something as a neighbor,\nbut he never accepted and would never speak to them. So here we found this chart. So then,\nuh he was flabbergasted, of course, and fascinated, but he still couldn't remember anything\nabout the man except that the handwriting on the chart was clearly his and he said, \"Yes,\nthat's my hand-writing so, you know, if that's what you wanted, I treated him.\" So we said,\n\"What we really want is to see if you have any of the x-rays,\" and he said, \"Well, no I don't\nbecause I always send the x-rays back to the dentist who referred a patient to me\" and we\nsaid \"Well, who referred this man to you.\" And he looked on his chart and he said, \"Well,\nand that was Dr. Tutiya\u2019.\" Now that's a Japanese name but there are over a million Japanese\nBrazilians living in the Sao Paulo area. It's the largest Japanese community anywhere outside\nof Japan, and there are many, many professionals in the health professions and elsewhere\nwho are second, third generation Japanese, born and living in Brazil as Brazilian citizens.\nAnd in questioning...this is a flashback...but in questioning Mrs. Stammer and Mrs. Brossert\nabout whether they knew of who had been Mengele's dentist when he finally started going to\none again, swore that they couldn't remember the name but that he was a Japanese dentist.\nUh subsequently the Justice Department satisfied itself uh by way of its investigation that uh\nthe women were indeed telling the truth and they did not remember the name, but uh\ndefinitely they remembered that Mengele was referring to a Japanese dentist and once said\nthat he wanted to go to a Japanese dentist because since all Japanese look the same to him,\nhe assumed that Japanese couldn't tell the difference between one Caucasian male and\nanother, which is perfectly consistent with the kind of mentality the man had. So I asked Dr.\nGama \"Where is Dr. Tutiya\" and he said \"Well, he's just a block and a half down the street.\"\nSo we thanked him very much and the three of us walked out of there and crossed the street\nand, you know, the adrenalin was just pumping like crazy and there was a record store there\nthat was playing, you know, loud music on a loud speaker for the street and that sort of\nenhanced the sort of trance-like or movie-like atmosphere as we were, you know, brimming\nwith excitement walking the block and a half involved to get to the office of Mr. Tuttya, Dr.\nTutiya. So we got there. We knocked on the door and uh yes, he was in. And he saw us and\nthe police officer showed him the photograph of Mengele, one of the photographs that had\nbeen found in Mrs. Brassart's house, and he said \"Oh yes. That's the man with a hat.\" And\nthe reason he said that is because in Sao Paulo, it's extremely unusual to wear a hat. People\ndon't wear hats in Sao Paulo, but Mengele wore a hat because many years ago, his first wife\nstill in Germany who subsequently divorced him, but when he was leaving to flee Germany\nand went to Argentina, she said \"Oh, they're going to find you because you have such a high\nforehead that you're going to be easy to find all your life.\" And so in Buenos Aires,\naccording to records that I read, he actually tried to have a hair implant done of the high part\nof his forehead, try to shrink that down, but of course that didn't work. You can't grow hair\non the part of skin that never had hair, so then he started wearing a hat in order to to reduce\nthe size of the visible part of his forehead, so he always wore a hat and these photographs\nwere taken with him wearing a hat and this dentist immediately recognized that.\nDr. Kasumasa Tuttya.\nAnd we asked him if he remembered something about it, and he had a vague recollection but\nbut uh we said \"Well, do you have any records of Pedro Hochbichler.\" So he said \"well, just\na moment.\" And he went in a little room in the back and opened the drawer. ...I could see\nhim from the front room...went through some envelopes and charts and pulled out a chart\njust like that and brought it out and showed us that he had done a great deal of dental\ntreatment for this man, including two partial removable dentures and a lot of other dental\ntreatment, and so we said, \"Well, do you have any x-rays.\" And he said, \"Well, let me go\nback and check\" and then he went back in the room and opened another drawer and was in\nthere for what seemed like an eternity but finally came out with a little brown envelope,\nopened it up and six or seven dental x-rays dropped out on the table and that was a very\nmoving and very emotional moment and uh we uh took the x-rays and the other records with\nus. Of course, this was legally sanctioned by the police officer who was with us, and uh the\ndentist, of course, was also perfectly willing to cooperate and uh I immediately called Neil\nScher in Washington and he had an associate who worked on this case for the whole time, a\nvery fine professional called David Meyerwell (ph). I called them and told them what had\nhappened. Of course, they knew that we were doing this, so they were very excited to hear\nthe results and 1t was Neil Scher who started me on this process.\nUh and then I also called Dr. Lowell Levine, who is an American dental forensic specialist\nwho had been down on the original team in June in Brazil in '85 and did the dental specialty\nwork, and he came back immediately and uh then we had these x-rays which were located\nonly through the decoded information from an authenticated diary of Josef Mengele. There\nwas no other way to find these x-rays. I I used the diary found there. It was authenticated by\nhand-writing experts from Germany and the United States, used the information I gleaned\nfrom there, broke the code in which it was written, and using only and exclusively\ninformation from that authenticated diary, found the dentist and these x-rays. Therefore,\nthese x-rays could be taken with absolute certainty as belonging to Josef Mengele. Then it\nwas only a matter of Dr. Levine coming down and matching those x-rays with the x-rays\ntaken of the skull which had been found in Embu at the time of the exhumation and when\nthere was a hundred percent coincidence in all of the details of those x-rays, that allowed the\ncase to be closed with a hundred percent certainty that should lay to rest in a scientific way\nthe fact that Josef Mengele is dead.",

        "PREFACE",
