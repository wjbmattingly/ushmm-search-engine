        "Question: United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, Jeff and Toby Herr collection.\nThis is an interview with Francis Akos, conducted by Gary Covino, on September 23rd,\n1998, in Chicago, Illinois. This is a follow up interview to a United States Holocaust\nMemorial Museum videotaped interview conducted with Francis Akos. The United\nStates Holocaust Memorial Museum gratefully acknowledges Jeff and Toby Herr for\nmaking this interview possible. This is tape number one, side A.",
        "A: My name ts Francis Akos, A-k-o-s. We are recording at Orchestra Hall in Chicago,\nwhich is my second home, being assistant concert master here for the last 44 years.",
        "Q: And you\u2019re about to start the season, I guess, huh?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And you just -- you just come back from a tour of Europe?",
        "A: We just came back from -- from a scenic tour of Europe and Friday is opening night.",
        "Q: When -- this is jumping ahead some, actually, but since you mentioned you\u2019ve just\nbeen in Europe, I imagine, with what you do in life, you go to Europe fairly often?",
        "A: Well, it started in \u201871. Until then the Chicago symphony was an unknown, great\norchestra. But \u201871 with Shorty, we went to Europe the first time and since then, several\ntimes to Europe and to Japan and Russia and Australia. We were all over.",
        "Q: So, you\u2019ve been going back then for, you know, since the early 70\u2019s, it\u2019s a --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- quarter of -- quarter of a century.",
        "A: Quarter of a century, right.",
        "Q: What is it like to go back? Does it -- does it ever bring up memories of what happened\nto you during the war? Do you ever -- have you ever been to, or near any of those places\nagain?",
        "A: At ce -- at certain -- at certain times it happened, but generally speaking, not. But at\none point, when we were in Hamburg, I went out to see the -- the place where the\nCaparkone wa -- bombing happened and since then there were some books written and\nthere are -- there is a museum there and I didn\u2019t feel at home too much when I went back\nto Hungary. We went -- we were in Russia and then we went to Hungary and -- and\nVienna, to play a concert each. It ba -- it brought back memories, but for some reason, I\nwasn\u2019t too upset about what happened. But as concertmaster of the Berlin opera house\nsince -- I mean from -- for \u201850 -- f -- \u201850 til \u201854. I took this as a rehabilitation -- kind of\nrestitution, because I made it -- I play in a proba -- a -- a -- an audition and I ma -- got the\njob and I lived there for three years, almost four. And I made some very good friends.\nNot -- not all of them were -- were -- were avid Nazis. And they treated me very nicely,\nso I -- I didn\u2019t have any bad feelings about being back to Euro -- to Germany,\nspecifically, and Berlin.",
        "Q: So you feel like your time in -- in those years in Berlin right after the war, it was\nalmost like there was a timeta --",
        "A: Yeah, it is --",
        "Q: Some sort of reconciliation?",
        "A: It was -- it was like that, I took it that way. Some -- some people couldn\u2019t understand\nhow can you live in Germany. But everybody is little different.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. You mentioned the Caparkone.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Ho-How do you spell that?",
        "A: C-a-p-a-r-c-o -- no, a-r-k-o-n-e. Caparkone. Well, in English it\u2019s with a c, I think in\nGermany it was also the same way, the spelling of the -- of this ship. That was a 37,000\nton Hamburg - South America liner. And since then I discovered, by accident, that when\nthe Germans made a f-film of the Titanic, in \u201841, they used this ship for the feeling of that\n-- of the Titanic.",
        "Q: They made a movie about the Titanic?",
        "A: They made they -- they are the -- very famous movie, it was during the war time. And\nthis is the -- the ship they used.",
        "Q: We should mention -- I mean you go into description at some length in your interview\nwith the Holocaust Museum --",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: -- and also with the S-Shoah Foundation, you tell the story of being on the ship, it was\na ship where they had taken thousands of prisoners, the Germans had put thousands of\nprisoners on these ships. It was right at the end of the war.",
        "A: There were three -- three big ship in the Bay of Lubec. And that\u2019s the North Sea and\nwhat we found out afterwards, there was no fuel on the ships. So what they planned with\nus, nobody knows. M-Most likely, they wanted to do something to -- to get rid of all this\nper -- concentration camp prisoners, but the British took it into their hands on -- on May\nthird. And they were on the ships in the afternoon. And there was about 7,000 who died\nand maybe 400 who -- who are alive.",
        "Q: The British bombed it --",
        "A: Who were alive.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: The British bombed it because everything was going -- going north. The -- the -- the\nGermans were evacuating and -- and sending all the troops further north and they thought\nthat thasat -- these ships are transport ships for -- for German military. But what came out\nlater -- what was found out, that the -- Bannerat, the -- the Swe-Swedish Bannerat -- the\nSwedish what?",
        "Q: I think he -- he was called Count.",
        "A: Count. Yes, Count Bannerat had a meeting with Himmler in -- in Lubec. That\u2019s where\nthey -- they shipped us in f-from. To the -- to the big ships. And he found out that there\nare sh -- pris-prisoners -- concen-concentration camp prisoners on these ships and by\neight o\u2019clock in the morning, the British got the mes-message that don\u2019t bomb these ships\nbecause they are innocent survivors of -- of the concentration camps and the British\nsupposedly said, \u201cIt\u2019s too late.\u201d And at 2:30 they bombed the ships.",
        "Q: Mm.",
        "A: So, coincidences happened, nobody knows what happen -- really caused them.",
        "Q: It\u2019s still being investigated to this day, no?",
        "A: It sure is. There is a film that was made by a German young man who -- who\nhappened to -- to be spending some vacation time at the North Sea, and he\u2019s -- heard\nabout that there is a -- a memorial for the Holocaust ma -- victims, 7,000 of them. And he\nstarted to dig in and -- and look -- look into it. And he found ca -- found out all kinds of\ndetails and he found a few survivors, including me. And he made a film at -- a\ndocumentary about it. Unfortunately, the film is not well known at all, because the\nEnglish subtitles are not legible. Very -- they didn\u2019t have enough money to -- to do the\nright subtitling. And that\u2019s -- that\u2019s where it is. It was played in -- I mean, it was shown in\n-- in Germany several ti -- several places, in France and in Holland. But, many people\nknow about the Titanic, everybody knows about the Titanic. Nobody knows about the\nCaparkone and the Deutschland. And the Athena, there was three ships.",
        "Q: And the vast majority of people on those ships died.",
        "A: Right. There were only -- only about 400 all together that survived. And 7,000 are at -\n- known dead. So they -- they knew the numbers that -- that were shipped -- put -- put on\nthe ships. So this film was done on a very si -- very low budget. This is a one man\noperation, basically. The guy is from Berlin and he was trying his best. But a -- without\nenough backing, is not going to be well-known anywhere.",
        "A: Right. So you\u2019re experience actually, on the -- you know, your quote unquote, \u201cDay\nof Liberation\u201d --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- consisted of diving off the side of this --",
        "A: Of jumping into the -- into the cold sea and being lucky enough to be fished out by --\nby some little boat that was around the ship and getting into the -- o-on land, when the\nBritish came in, that was a -- a -- barracks -- some kind of barracks when we -- we came\non -- on shore and the British tanks were coming in and -- and tearing down the -- the\nflags. And then we -- we had nothing. Basically zero. What we had on was wet and that --\nthat was what -- what we owned, the few people who -- who survived. So the British\nwent into different houses and told the Germans, give these people eat -- to eat, give\nthese people something to wear and shoes and -- and this is how I started my new life.",
        "Q: When -- do you remember, when you were with the British and they were telling\nGermans to give you something to eat and to give you clothes, I guess, how were the\nGermans reacting to that?",
        "A: Well, they -- they had no idea what\u2019s going on. They only saw the -- the British come\nin and they didn\u2019t know what were these wet -- wet people came from. They -- they saw\nsome bombing maybe, but they didn\u2019t know that those -- those -- the concentration camp\nprisoners, until they saw them with -- with the hair shor-shorn and no -- well, nobody had\nanything, but basically, no-nobody has a -- had a piece of paper to -- to prove who they\nwere. Anyway, the British then -- then gave us some -- some identification cards. But it\nwas hairy.",
        "Q: Hairy?",
        "A: Very hairy.",
        "Q: In what way\u201d?",
        "A: In very many ways. You -- you didn\u2019t know who you were talking to, whether it was a\n-- a Nazi who -- who was trying to kill you before and who 1s now trying to -- to save his\nown hide or -- or whether it was somebody who just came off the ship, by accident.\nAnyway, it was very -- a long time ago, so I can\u2019t remember. Then it was difficult to get -\n- get where you wanted to go, because that -- the French and the Belgians, I think and the\nPoles sent their -- their people to -- to collect their own people, because there -- they were\nnotified. But anybody behind the Iron Curtain, like -- like Hungarians and Czechs and --\nnobody cared really, but there was a United Nations relief organization, you -- the\nUNRRA, Unrah, and I had a chance to -- actually, I -- I found somewhere -- I organized\nmyself a -- a violin and through -- through -- through the British, I became a -- a violinist\nfor the officer\u2019s club. I didn\u2019t know much -- too many British officer songs anyway, but I\n-- I survived somehow and I played a little bit. Of course, it was difficult because -- I\nspoke a little English, but not -- now, my English is better, my acc-accent is the same.\nBut I had to make myself understood. And s-si -- one of the officers helped me to get\nnotification to the Red Cross, because I had an uncle in Ankara who survived the war in -\n- in Turkey. And I knew his address. I didn\u2019t have a chance to send anything to Budapest,\nbecause I -- I didn\u2019t know whether my parents were alive or not, first of all and secondly\nthere was no c-communication or -- or mail or anything like that. But through the Red\nCross, I -- I sent a note to my uncle, who then notified my parents that I was alive. So it\ntook four months until I -- I finally got back to Hungary -- to Budapest. Mayas -- with a\nCzech transport. There was nothing going on for -- for Hungarians. But I -- I joined at\nthat Czech transport and I got back somehow. On buses, on trains, on -- had no money, of\ncourse. And then I went to -- to my old apartment, not knowing whether my mother is\naround, or my father. That\u2019s where they -- they deported me from, originally. And so they\nwere alive. And then I became concertmaster of the -- of the Budapest Concert Orchestra.\nThey knew it through my mother that I was alive and they were waiting for me, as a --\nwith -- with that position. And those were the first few months, everything was very\ndifficult. There was inflation, there was no -- no food, no money, no nothing. Basically, it\nwas terrible times. And it was basically Russian occupation. So, we went through all\nkinds of horror stories. But I played. I practice, I played and I got back into the swing of\nthings and then I left. Some of us felt that the -- the world is open, now that the war is\nover, the world is open for -- for -- for us talented, good, good instrumentalists, et-\netcetera. And we went over to Austria and then to France and we ha -- we s -- we had a --\nwith some colleagues, I played in a string quartet and nothing really j-jived. Because the\nworld wasn\u2019t open. In France, you couldn\u2019t -- couldn\u2019t get a job if you didn\u2019t have\nnationality -- I mean, didn\u2019t belong to -- even -- even as a -- as a foreigner, if you didn\u2019t\nhave the right kind of papers, you couldn\u2019t get a job. So when I went back, I played an\naudition for the opera. They were looking for a concertmaster in Budapest and I got the\njob. I was the youngest concertmaster they ever had in the Budapest Philharmonic. Twas\nlike -- like in Vienna, the Philharmonic and the opera orchestra is the same -- or was the\nsame. And I was there for -- for a season, two seasons and somebody who knew me from\nway back, when I was a student -- this lady was a pianist and she survived the war in -- in\n-- in Sweden. And she recommended me for concertmaster to come to Gurterburg, in\nSweden. So I got the passport, I didn\u2019t promise them anything, but I went out to -- to play\nthe audition. And after I played out the -- the audition and I was -- I got the job, then I\nwent back to Budapest -- oh, I went back and I got a year of -- va -- leave of absence -- a\nleave, yeah. And then I never went back, afterwards. I didn\u2019t go back, I went out to\nSweden and I was concertmaster in Gurterburg for three years. Then there was an\nopening in Berlin and they wanted me to come. I played an audition again. I got the job\nand that\u2019s when I started in the opera house. This Shtetisher oper, meaning civic opera,\nbut that was one of the big operas. They had three in -- in Berlin -- 1n West Berlin and in\nEast Berlin, there were three or four opera houses, but three of -- three of them were\nfamous. The Startsh oper and the Commisher oper was -- were in East Berlin. My opera,\nthe Shtetisher oper was West Berlin. And I never went over to the east side, because I\nwasn\u2019t interested in it. I knew -- knew what Communism is and I knew what Russian\noccupation is, I wasn\u2019t interested. But that was an interesting life. West Berlin was -- was\nan island in -- in -- in Germany. And that was very good, until I got my American pa --\nvisa, which took eight -- eight years I was waiting for the American visa. And when I got\nit, I couldn\u2019t say, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t come, because I have a good job in Berlin.\u201d So I came to\nAmerica.",
        "Q: Let me -- before we take up that part of the story, let me ask you a couple questions.\nI\u2019m curious -- you know, you\u2019re -- most -- most of the people that I\u2019ve interviewed who\nsurvived the Holocaust, they have very vivid memories of their day of liberation. And\nusually it\u2019s soldiers march into a camp or they\u2019re -- they\u2019re in hiding and they -- they see\nthe Russians coming or the Americans coming or whatever and it\u2019s a -- it\u2019s a very\ndistinctive experience. Now your day of liberation is actually being bombed, scrambling\nfor --",
        "A: Much more distinctive.",
        "Q: -- scrambling for you life --",
        "A: Just looking.",
        "Q: -- tremendous -- tremendous chaos.",
        "A: Yeah. It was -- it was -- I was right in the middle of tt.",
        "Q: Yeah. So my -- my question 1s -- do you know, or can you remember, when was --\nyou know, all these other interviews I\u2019ve done, people say, \u201cAnd th -- and then, when we\nwent out and met the Russians, then we were liberated.\u201d You know, they knew they were\nliberated. They -- people knew what their -- that their moment of liberation had come and\nI\u2019m wondering, when was the time you ever felt that, given how crazy it was that day?",
        "A: I -- I never really verbalized it, but I suppose it was the time when I saw the English\nsoldiers cam -- coming 1n the -- in the tanks, into this Ubertshooter -- what is an\nUbertshooter -- un -- submarine school, basically. It was in the submarine school where --\nwhere the left side of the -- the harbor, that we hit land with these little boats that helped.\nNot too many. And at the same time, this Bri-British tanks were coming from the right\nand those British soldiers took down the Nazi flag that was still o-on -- on the flagpole.\nAnd I suppose that was the time that I was liberated, because now -- now I could speak\nEnglish to the English soldiers. So that was -- that was the end of the war for me. I didn\u2019t\nknow it\u2019s -- May three is -- is just a date. And now I know what it was, cause they were --\nfive more days they -- they went on with the war, but that was almost the ho -- the end.",
        "Q: But even now, when you\u2019re talking, you say, \u201cWhen I saw them take down the flag, I\nsuppose that was it.\u201d Sounds like --",
        "A: Yeah, I suppose that was it.",
        "Q: -- y-you say you suppose that was it, sounds like at the time, it didn\u2019t really strike you.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t -- no, it didn\u2019t. I was wet and cold and I was worried. I really didn\u2019t -- didn\u2019t\nfeel liberated, but that was it, cause I was liberated, basically. And I survived. The other\n7,000 died.",
        "Q: Did you ever have any discu -- I mean you s -- you s -- you spoke some English, so I\nbelieve in your other interviews, you mentioned that you were able to speak with the\nBritish about what had happened. Did you ever --",
        "A: Nobody -- nobody really asked me what happened. They -- they just -- somehow they\n-- they must have known it from other people, too. I probably told them, I don\u2019t\nremember exactly what -- what I told them, that we were on the ship and the ship was\nbombed, that -- and who we are. Maybe I did, but they -- they seem to have known that\nthese are people who should be helped, these are not Nazis coming out of the water.",
        "Q: Did you feel -- you know, the British saved you on the one hand, but had bombed you\non the other hand. Did you feel grateful, resentful?",
        "A: After -- after the fact, I\u2019ve -- I felt very resentful, but I was glad that it was over. It was\nover because of them. That was a big, big mistake that they made and nobody can explain\nhow it happened. Nobody really could find out details. This guy who -- who made the\nfilm went all -- all the way to -- to the British command and --",
        "Q: If you could move --",
        "A: -- he interviewed -- he interviewed some of the pilots -- no, that was in the Stern\nmagazine, that was a -- a -- a serial that they had an interview with the pilots and they\nreally did not have any inkling what they did. But then when they found out, it was --\nthey had regrets, too. So thousands -- thousands perished and a few hundred were\nSUIVIVOTS.",
        "Q: Could you tell me a little more about what it was like when you went back to\nBudapest, where you were from?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: The war was over now, what was the city like, how did it feel to be there? How did\nyou feel as a -- as a Jew, being back there?",
        "A: It was very difficult for everybody, basically because -- because of the Russians. The\nRussians took as much as whatever could they -- could take out besides the -- the -- the --\nthe Nazis ruined Budapest with street fights. And I remember when -- when they\ndeported me, first they took us -- that was night -- evening, raids during the day and\nduring the evening, they put -- put together I don\u2019t know how many hundreds of Jews\ninto the big synagogue -- that\u2019s the biggest in Europe, the hung -- the -- the Budapest\nsynagogue, and that\u2019s where we were -- we were kept and during the night, we heard de-\ndemolition sounds. All but one bridge -- bridges were detonated and -- and there was no\nconnection between Pest and Buda, other than one that they left. And that\u2019s where we\nwent over to the Buda side. In the morning --",
        "Q: Now, this is when -- when is this happening?",
        "A: And this 1s -- this is November four an -- \u201844.",
        "Q: So this 1s during the war?",
        "A: During the war when -- when the -- the Hungarian Nazis took over the government\nand they rounded up all the Jews. Most of them into ghettos, but some of us were\ndeported right away. And we walked to vie -- to Vienna under -- under guns. So that was\ncoming back to -- to this place, to -- to Budapest, 1t was ruined by -- by the Germans and\nit was ruined by the Hungarian Nazis and then it was ruined by the Russians. So it was a\npretty bad situation, but everybody tried to survive and there was no -- no difference\nbetween Jews, non-Jews. We -- we were musicians. We played in the orchestra and --\nand there was craving for -- for some culture after awhile, but we played in this overcoats\nbecause there was no heat. So it was a very, very strange situation.",
        "Q: But the Jewish community of Budapest had been devastated, no?",
        "A: Yeah, most of it, most of it. The only place where -- where there were some surviving\nJews, was in Budapest, because of the ghetto situation and there was -- there were some -\n- some houses that were under Swedish and Swiss protection, supposedly. Well, they\ntook me from a Swedish -- Swedish pro-protected house, too. But in general, Jews from\nthe countryside were deported much earlier than -- than what happened to me, or us. And\nthe surviving Hungarian Jews were all either in hiding or in -- in ghettos that were so-\ncalled liberated by the Russians.",
        "Q: What would -- what did it feel to -- like, to be walking down familiar streets in\nBudapest, where once, you know, you had family, friends and all this life in this\ncommunity and what was it like then, after the war?",
        "A: We didn\u2019t really know too much in the beginning, who survived, who didn\u2019t survive?\nWho was around, who wasn\u2019t around? It was a strange world all together. And I\nremember that a school -- school friend of mine, I didn\u2019t see him again, not until just a\nfew years ago, he was in -- in Chicago and he talked to me. I knew his father was 1n the\nsame transport, walking to Vienna and then on the -- on the cattle car wizness going to --\nbeing transported to Hamburg mayan gummer. And I saw him die in -- in the camp. He\nwas in the same barracks where -- where I was. So, I didn\u2019t see him when I came home,\nbut I knew certain things. And I saw one of my friend from school, who became a -- a\npartisan in -- in -- in Russia, fighting on the side of the Russians, against the Germans. He\ncame back with the Russians to Budapest and became a high positioned police officer,\nwho was trying to find and did find th-the Nazis who -- the Hungarian Nazis who were\nresponsible for most of the atrocities that took place. So it was strange, it was a very\nstrange world and -- and -- and I left it behind and came back to it. But by then it was a\nlittle better, where I was concertmaster in the opera house, but we still didn\u2019t have peace.\nNot just peace, but bombed out buildings and -- and bombed out apartments and -- and\nvery little -- very little food. The Russians took as much as was movable, they took. They\n-- they dismantled toilets in the hotels and -- and washing -- wash basins and took them,\nbecause most of these -- these so-called soldiers, they have never seen anything that rem -\n- rem -- that is close to co-comfort and that is close to luxury. So they -- they got -- they\nwent wild. They took the watches off -- off your arm and they had -- some of them had\nfive, six watches on their arms. Duvi, duvi, that was the -- the word. Give, give, whatever\nyou can. And they took the rings off the fingers of the people and -- and the watches and\nit was a very strange world, but you know, it just comes to me sporadically, when I talk\nabout it. Otherwise, I don\u2019t think about it.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: It was after all five -- 50 years ago. 45 -- more then 50 years ago.",
        "Q: Do you feel that -- I mean, your life is a life of music, do you feel --\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with\nFrancis Akos. This is tape number one, side B.",
        "A: -- talk about it. Otherwise, I don\u2019t think about tt.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: It was after all five -- 50 years ago. 45 -- more then 50 years ago.",
        "Q: Do you feel that -- I mean, your life is a life of music, do you feel that -- were you sort\nof mentally and emotionally, maybe even spiritually, sort of cu -- yo -- is so much of your\nlife bound up with the music that -- do you think it was any help in surviving what you\nsurvived? And do you think it was a help after the war in taking your mind off what was\ngoing on all around you?",
        "A: Well, not that -- not in that vein, what you were just saying, the last sentence. It -- you\njust keep on living. But help, yes, because in the concentration camp, I survived because\nthe -- the guy who was in -- in charge of my barracks -- for some reason, I don\u2019t know\nwhy and how he -- he found out that I am playing the violin and -- and there was sudden-\nsuddenly there was a violin. And every evening they were -- they were trying to -- to\nkeep up their spirits and they were singing -- there were Polish people, German people,\nHungarians, all mixture. And I was playing the violin for them and this guy liked it. So\nhe really saved my life, basically, because there were transports going out of that camp to\nBergen-Belsen and to Auschwitz and he always saved me. So that\u2019s sh -- music helped\nme a lot.",
        "Q: Right. Well, we should say that you tell that story in both of your video interviews.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Actually at -- at greater length, so if anyone wants to --",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: -- check them, they can just --",
        "A: It\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- 1t\u2019s my story, so -- and that I remember very well.",
        "Q: Hm.",
        "A: Later, when I was concertmaster in Berlin, somehow I connected with him -- either he\nconnected with me or I connected with him, but then I lost track of him. So we are now\nback in America, \u201854.",
        "Q: How -- let me ask you, you said it took eight years to --",
        "A: To get the visa, because of -- of the -- the what do you call it, quota system. Okay, a\nHungarian, no matter where you -- I ask for my visa in Paris, but I was born in Budapest,\nso it went under a Hungarian quota and it took -- took six years until -- or s -- eight years\nuntil I got it.",
        "Q: When you first applied for the visa --",
        "A: Yeah?",
        "Q: This was soon aft -- not too --",
        "A: That was in \u201846.",
        "Q: Why did you want to come to America?",
        "A: Because America was -- was everybody\u2019s -- in everybody\u2019s mind, that was the place\nwhere to -- where to escape, where to go. A free country and -- and you -- you get what\nyou -- what you deserve as far as, you know, your -- your knowledge, your talent,\nwhatever. And that was well-known before the war, during the war, after the war.\nAmerica was the place where to go. Many people went to Canada, many people went to\nAustralia. Sweden wasn\u2019t bad either, but I -- I didn\u2019t feel like I belonged to Sweden,\nbecause it was so even. Everybody had everything, basically and no big difference\nbetween ups and downs. The -- the best and not -- not -- and the worst. It was very much\nin equilibrium. I -- somehow I didn\u2019t feel -- when I went this German -- the Berlin\nposition was offered to me, that I should come and play -- audition -- audition, I didn\u2019t\nhesitate. I could have stayed in -- in Sweden and become a -- a satisfied, even keeled\nperson.",
        "Q: But that -- so, Sweden was -- well, it sounds like you\u2019re saying Sweden was a little\nboring?",
        "A: Well, it -- you can -- you can say that somehow, yes, but there are some Swedes who\nare not boring, either. But I was too young for -- for settling down for good -- good life,\nin general. I had a good job and it was very nice, but it wasn\u2019t exciting enough.",
        "Q: By the time your visa was coming through --",
        "A: Yeah?",
        "Q: -- after -- eight years after you applied to come to America, did you still really want to\ncome to America or did you have some thoughts of maybe you were settling 1n in -- in\nother parts of Europe?",
        "A: Well, I was concertmaster in Berlin, I didn\u2019t want to go anywhere else, but I had an\noffer from Swede -- Switzerland, also. I p-played -- played a solo in [indecipherable]\nwith the -- with the orchestra there and they wanted me to come from Berlin to -- to\nSwitzerland, but th-then the American visa came and it was really difficult to say no,\nbecause that was, you know, originally the idea, to come to America, now here 1s a visa. I\ncouldn\u2019t say no.",
        "Q: Where -- when and where did you finally come over to this country?",
        "A: I came over in January, \u201854. And the previous summer, I was concert -- I was one of\nthe members of the Casals Festival Orchestra, that has several concertmasters from --\nfrom America and from other places, from Canada. And I made friends with -- with a few\nand they told me it will be very difficult. First of all, you have to become a member of the\nunion before you even can -- can play an audition. And then you have to settle for what --\nwhat\u2019s -- what\u2019s available. So it wasn\u2019t an -- an open book. So I came over, I had to stay\nin New York, I was staying in New York for awhile. And I couldn\u2019t play an audition for\nthe opening for the following years, but I was offered a -- a position that was not a union\nposition. The Aspen School of Music, the Aspen Festival was av-available for me and\nthat\u2019s where I we-went during the summer, which wasn\u2019t a bad summer, to spend the first\nsummer in -- in America in Aspen, which was very nice. And then I had to fly back to --\nto New York to get my union card and then I played an audition and made it into the\nMinneapolis Symphony, as leader of the second violins. And that lasted one year. I mean\nit would -- could have lasted longer, but I wasn\u2019t -- wasn\u2019t satisfied, I -- I wasn\u2019t happy\nwith just being third or fourth member of the -- of the hierarchy in the violins. And there\nwas an opening in -- in Chicago. I played the audition in Chicago and got the job and\nmoved to Chicago. That was \u201855. And I stayed, got married, have two daughters and I am\nhere now for -- assistant concertmaster for 44 seasons, which is long time with one\norchestra.",
        "Q: What is your wife\u2019s name?",
        "A: Phyllis.",
        "Q: Phyllis? And your daughter\u2019s names?",
        "A: Daughter are Katie, or Kate, as -- as she likes to be called and Judy. And Judy has two\nlittle ones, Justin is 11, well 10, basically and Melissa is eight. And I am a proud gra-\ngrandfather. Phyllis has three daughters, they are older. My -- my -- my older daughter is\n40 and her older d -- older daughter is a little more than 40, I think 42. She has three\nlovely ladies and I have two, so we are f -- a family of five girls and her oldest daughter\nhas two sons, so we have three grandsons and one granddaughter.",
        "Q: Did you meet your wife over here, or --",
        "A: Yeah, over here, yeah. She is from Chicago. And she graduated as a piano major in --\nat Northwestern. So music brought us together, basically.",
        "Q: Do you ever talk with your -- or years ago, did you talk with your daughters about\nyour experiences during the war? Have you ever talked to your grandchildren about it?",
        "A: Yes, s-s-slowly and -- and a little bit. Not -- not much. But my daughters know most\nof it and they -- they know the -- the tapes -- the -- the interviews that I made, it probably\ngives them more than what I gave them before. And with the grandchildren, not -- not\nyet. Not yet, but after awhile I\u2019m sure they -- they will find out. It\u2019s very difficult to, you\nknow, to just give them one part and not the whole story and the whole story is too long\nand too difficult to understand and -- so I\u2019m -- I never really sat down, now you look, you\n-- you listen, okay? I didn\u2019t do that.",
        "Q: Would they -- was it more that they had to ask you something to -- for 1t to become a\nsubject of discussion?",
        "A: Not really, I -- it was no subject, but I think now that they are old enough to -- to\nunderstand, at least partially, what -- what I can tell them. I -- I's -- really thought -- the\nother day I just -- I was just thinking I will sit down with the older ones together and --\nand talk -- tell them a little bit.",
        "Q: These are your grandchildren you\u2019re talking about?",
        "A: Yeah, these are grandchildren.",
        "Q: What about years ago, though, in your house, with your daughters? Did you talk about\nit much with them?",
        "A: There was a time when we -- we belonged to -- to a Temple and there I -- then I was\ntalking to them a little bit, because I was still -- I was asked to talk to the class to -- you\nknow, Sunday school. And I told them a little bit, very little. It\u2019s very difficult to -- to\nmake them understand. When they go to the Holocaust Museum, they will understand\nmuch more than the -- what I -- I can give them, I think. But this is a wonderful thing that\n-- that interview business, that they are going to try to -- to make the next and the next\ngeneration understand what -- what it is and what it was.",
        "Q: What about you, yourself? Would you -- your own preferences, just going all -- along\nin life, with your family, whatever, is 1t something that you prefer not to dwell on? Is it\nsomething that you don\u2019t think about that often any more? Is it something that y -- that is\nwith you a lot?",
        "A: No, I -- I have met people who think about it all the time and who talk about it all the\ntime and I wasn\u2019t that way. I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s my nature, probably. I got over it.\nSomehow I -- I probably got hurt by it, but I didn\u2019t dwell on it for a long, long time. Then\n-- then I became more interested in 1t when -- when it became -- I think mostly with --\nwith the interview, with the Holocaust Museum interview, that I should remember it\nmore and -- and talk about it more. The first time this Caparkone story came out, a friend\nof mine from London sent me a clipping from -- from the Times that was kind of a\ndescription of the Stan magazine\u2019s articles that came out every week, as a serial, about\nthe Caparkone. So, the only -- only reason I knew about it, because he send me a Time\nmag -- and then I -- I started buying the Stan magazine issues. And that\u2019s how it all s-\nstarted, really. And then I -- I knew about the -- the man who -- who wrote the book a\nlittle bit, who -- who wrote the -- the articles, the serial in the Stan Magazine, he also put\nit in a boo-book form and I got in touch with him. And then later I sent them some -- sent\nhim some material that I had, like the -- the first identification card that I got from the\nBritish [indecipherable] in Noistat and other stuff. Then we -- we became friendly,\nbecause he -- he looked me up when I was in Hamburg with the symphony. And he took\nme back to the memorial that -- that\u2019s on the beach in Noistat, over the Lubec Bay. And\nso I got into more -- more and more to discuss, to talk about it, to -- to think about it. But\nI am not -- not upset any more. I was -- it was a long time ago and I survived, that was\nthe main -- that -- that\u2019s my main feeling.",
        "Q: What about when things happen, like you know, in the 70\u2019s there was -- I believe it\nwas in the 70\u2019s, there was a series on American television about the Holocaust. When a\nmovie like \u201cSchindler\u2019s List\u201d --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- comes out, do you watch those things? Do you avoid them, or --",
        "A: Well, I went -- I went to see \u201cSchindler\u2019s List\u201d and I was very -- very much taken by\nit, because it was very close to what I understoo -- what I -- what I experienced. So yes, I\ndo -- I do see it [indecipherable] lot, the last -- what was it, the six days of -- the invasion.\n\u201cThe Longest Day\u201d was a film and -- and things like that, yes, I do see it. I do -- I do\nremember a lot, but I -- I wasn\u2019t going to see the \u201cTitanic\u201d, it -- I don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t care\nmuch for the -- for the story, because I have my own story and -- and it was -- with all the\nlove story that w-went with it and all that, I -- I really wasn\u2019t interested in it. It\u2019s bad\nenough that it happened, but to me that\u2019s not entertainment.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. You had your own version of the Titanic.",
        "A: Ah, yeah. Right, right.",
        "Q: Are there -- have there been, during your -- you\u2019ve been here 40 -- 40 -- what, 41\nyears, I think, yeah.",
        "A: In \u201855, yeah 43 years.",
        "Q: 43 years here.",
        "A: 53 years.",
        "Q: Wait, no.",
        "A: 40, oh now, fif -- 43 years, right.",
        "Q: 43 years here at the symphony, are there members of the symphony now, or during the\ntime you\u2019ve been here, have there been other members who were also survivors of the\nHolocaust?",
        "A: Well, I think so. Well, there\u2019s one -- one Hungarian colleague of mine who is -- who\nis here, who -- who hasn\u2019t been in concentration camp, but he was in -- in -- in -- d-\ndrafted in the Hungarian army just like I was. And he is a survivor, because he was\naround, he was Jewish. And I don\u2019t know too many. We have -- we have several who\nwere not born in this country, but I don\u2019t -- don\u2019t know of anybody who is -- or the -- the\nguy who is a Czech. He -- he came out after the war, so he survived the -- the war. But he\nis not Jewish, so it\u2019s not the same category. I don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t know of any other.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. When you were with the academies in Europe after the war -- I mean, you\nwere concertmaster or whatever --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Were there -- were there ever any -- what was it like being Jewish in that setting?\nWere there ever any problems, did it ever come up? Was it just not an issue?",
        "A: No, it was -- it was just not an issue. It -- it was too much of an issue before and\nduring the war. See, before the war, when | -- I was in the academy as a student and we\nhad a competition and I won the competition as the best student of -- of the first year of --\nof the course, of academy. And -- and they had some bad demonstrations before and\nduring. After that, I was coming down with the violin that -- that I just won, who -- where\nthe director of the academy handed it to me and as I was coming down the st -- the steps,\nsome of them were screaming about the girl who didn\u2019t win, that was not Jewish. They\nsaid, \u201cNever mind, you have your violin in your hand, but she is the winner anyway.\u201d S-\nStuff like that, there was -- there was numerous clauses that was a -- the 10 percent what\ndo you call it?",
        "Q: Quota?",
        "A: Quota system in the universities and the academies counted as university. But I was in\nbefore -- before the -- became worse. And at the end there was no-nobody who was\nJewish who -- who could play publicly. We had to play concerts in the private homes.\nThis is during and -- during the war -- before, during the war, basically. Because the war\nstarted in 1939 and ended in \u201845, so it was six years and in -- during that time, I finished\nthe academy and got my -- my diplomas, etcetera. There was no -- no anti-Semit -- open\nanti-Semitism after the war, basically, because there were too many Jewish people who --\nsome -- some survivors basically, but the -- on -- on -- in positions, because they came in\nwith the Russians or the Russians put them in, so as I -- as I mentioned, this friend of\nmine, who became a -- a high -- high official officer of -- of the Hungarian -- well, it\u2019s\npolice - sickel -- sickel police, whatever it was, I don\u2019t know exactly, but there were\nmany of those who were put in. So no open anti-Semitism e-existed.",
        "Q: In the camp, you said, in a way, you know, being able to play the violin saved your\nlife. I\u2019m wondering if there 1s any way -- but then you went through long periods where, I\nguess you didn\u2019t have the opportunity to play at all?",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "Q: I\u2019m wondering if -- what do you think the whole experience, did it have -- do you\nthink it had any affect on your musical development in any way?",
        "A: Well, it might have, I don\u2019t know. A-All I know is that I had -- had to practice a lot to\nmake up for all the time that I didn\u2019t see a violin, when I came back to -- to Budapest\nafter -- after the war. And it -- it took quite a while to get back to normalcy. I don\u2019t know\nif -- if the development had -- had anything to do with -- with the experience. I mean, yo -\n- yO -- my -- my musical development -- I was pretty well developed, I think, because I\nwasn\u2019t a youngster any more when I came back. It might have had some influence.",
        "Q: Maybe, but you\u2019re not sure?",
        "A: Maybe, I don\u2019t know. No, I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. You know, there\u2019s always that -- that thought that gets raised often when\npeople talk about the Holocaust and they talk about the Germans and it\u2019s -- it\u2019s sort of\nthis notion of, you know, the Germans, you know, a people with such a high culture, with\nsuch, you know -- you know, wonderful things to their culture, such amazing music and\nhow could -- how could a people capable of all that, also be capable of the monstrosities\nof the Holocaust, you know?",
        "A: Better minds than I couldn\u2019t answer this question. It was the most organized\ndisorganized kind of life. When I tell you that they -- they took transports -- th-the camp -\n- Neuengamme was basically a -- a transit camp. They had -- I got sick when I -- in -- I\nthink two or three weeks into -- into the camp life, I got -- I think pneumonia and they --\nthey put me in the hospital barracks, that they had a hel -- hospital barracks, where they\ntook care of you with m -- with medication and then from the hospital barracks, they took\nthem to Bergen-Belsen, on the transport, to -- to put them in -- in gas chambers, so if that\ncan explain anything, it\u2019s organized disorganization, it\u2019s impossible to -- to -- to get an\nanswer.",
        "Q: I-It\u2019s not a question you dwell on very often, or --",
        "A: No, no, no, absolutely not. That \u201cSchindler\u2019s List\u201d shows you basically what -- what\nwent on behind this -- behind this scenes of -- of themselves. So the -- the officers and --\nand some of those people who -- Schindler himself was -- was a Nazi, basically, to begin\nwith. That\u2019s -- some -- some -- some of them had better human feelings than -- than\nothers. No, it was -- it was something that -- that nobody can understand.",
        "Q: Is there any piece of music that makes -- brings up any memories or -- or recalls\nanything to you, in particular?",
        "A: Not -- not really, I -- I don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t think there is any specific piece, no.",
        "Q: Nothing you associate with those times?",
        "A: None. No, no, absolutely not. The times I -- I associate with this -- is probably my --\nmy youth, when I -- when I learned certain pieces and then later the -- when I played\nthem again. But has very little connotation.",
        "Q: What about -- you mentioned in the camp where this guy gave you --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- a violin and that saved your life and you played folk songs.",
        "A: I played folk songs. I don\u2019t know what I played and how I played them.",
        "Q: Do you remember them any more?",
        "A: No, no, absolutely not. They were singing and I was trying to -- to emulate what I\nheard. But there was -- you know, lots of Polish non-Jews in that camp -- in that barracks\nwhere I was and Austrians and Germans and Czechs and Hungarian -- very few\nHungarians, by the way. And it wasn\u2019t a -- a -- a Jewish barracks at -- at all, it was all\nmixed. And so we had blackouts, because the bombers were going over Hamburg, to\nBerlin and Leipzig and all the other places that they were bombing. This was right in the\nmiddle of the last winter of -- of the war. And so the blackouts, th-they turned off the\nlights and there was nothing else to do, either -- either you -- you -- you were sleeping or\nyou were singing. Yeah, it was a strange, strange world, but I was lucky that -- I don\u2019t\nknow how I would have survived, probably never -- I wouldn\u2019t have survived. But th-this\n-- playing helped.",
        "Q: Have you ever in any of your trips to Europe, gone to some of the concentration\ncamps?",
        "A: Well, my wife went -- went to Dachau when we were in Munich and she was very,\nvery touched and impressed by that and -- and she will never forget it. And, as I told you,\nI went -- went out with -- with this guy to -- to the memorial -- to the memorial at -- in\nNice-Nicestadt, which is in Lubec Bay. And I went out to see the old camp once when I\nwas in Hamburg.",
        "Q: Which camp?",
        "A: Neuen-Neuengamme, my camp. And that is just a -- a big obelisk and -- and names of\nall the countries that were represented by -- by pro -- prisoners and how many from --\nfrom which country. I didn\u2019t see any of the -- the -- I saw an interesting thing when I was\nin -- we were in Brussels and we took a -- took a sightseeing bus with my wife. And next\nto the highway, the -- the driver slowed down and he said, \u201cThis is the place where they\nkept the Jews before they were sent to -- to Germany, and this is Belgium.\u201d So that\u2019s --\nthat\u2019s the other place that I have seen.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. What was it like -- I guess, so you went back to your camp, but the -- the\ncamp itself really wasn\u2019t there, right?",
        "A: It wasn\u2019t there, no, it wasn\u2019t there at -- many, many, many years later, 1t was just a --\nthe mem-memorial to the camp and s -- fields, I think.",
        "Q: Yeah. And you haven\u2019t felt any desire to see any of the other ones?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Why is that?",
        "A: Because I know what it 1s like, or what was -- what it was like. There were barracks\neverywhere, but what was interesting that -- that we saw in Paris, there is a -- a memorial\nto the -- to the French -- it doesn\u2019t say Jews. It -- 1t is behind the Notterdam, sunk in the --\nin the ground. You ge -- go down many, many steps and the sign outside says, \u201cTo the\nmemory of deportees\u201d and then the number, hundred some thousand. And you go in,\ndownstairs, underground, there is lights and every German concentration camps name,\nbecause there\u2019s a lot of French Jews who were in different camps. But it has nothing to\ndo with Jews, it -- they don\u2019t want to have anything to do with it. And so that\u2019s -- you can\ncut this out if you want to. It -- that -- that\u2019s another place where -- where we saw a\nmemorial. It\u2019s -- it\u2019s a very touching scene because it\u2019s underground, it\u2019s like a cellar and\nit\u2019s like bars and lights, little lights. And Yad Vashem, of course, we saw Yad Vashem.\nThat\u2019s -- when we were in Israel we went to see Yad Vashem and that\u2019s the first time my\nwife saw the name written, Neuengamme. So it -- it wasn\u2019t fictitious, 1t was real for her,\nyou know?",
        "Q: After the war, did you ever think about going to Israel? Moving to Israel?",
        "A: No. No, for some reason, I didn\u2019t. I was brought up -- we were never really -- really\nreligious. We were Jewish and that meant all the troubles that came with being Jewish,\nbut -- and we went to -- to -- my uncle went every Friday to -- to service, but my parents\nonly went to -- to high holidays. And I was Bar Mitzvah, but I wasn\u2019t brought up\nreligious. So that was one of --\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with\nFrancis Akos. This is tape number two, side A.",
        "A: -- to -- my uncle went every Friday to -- to service, but my parents only went to -- to\nhigh holidays. And I was Bar Mitzvah, but I wasn\u2019t brought up religious. So that was one\nof the reasons, probably, that I never sort of go into Israel.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Yeah, I have to mention -- I have to mention that my wife was always much more\nJewish than I was. I mean, in her life. And she went to -- to -- after school -- she went to a\nJewish school. She know -- she knows how to read and write Yiddish, so she\u2019s much\nmore into Judaism than I was. But she enjoyed it when she went -- went -- after school,\nshe went to this school and she enjoyed it and she still knows how to write and read.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: How to talk -- how to speak Yiddish.",
        "Q: I\u2019m not sure if this 1s covered in any of the other interviews, but what -- what\neventually happened to your parents?",
        "A: Oh my -- my father was deported, but my mother somehow got -- got him out. They\nwere in a -- ina open air, giant -- not a stadium, but it -- 1t\u2019s a -- the factory kind of thing.\nAnd my mother got him out, he -- he was sick, too. And they survived in the apartment\nwhere -- where we lived. And my father died in the end of the revolution in \u201856. And I\nbrought my mother out in \u00b057. I paid -- paid in for -- for those wonderful Russians who --\nwho were doing this humanitarian deed, to bring people out of Hungary, into Austria,\nacross that little bridge that was ma -- named in one of those books, for good money --\ngood do -- good dollars they got f-for their humanitarian act. And she came out here and\nshe died here. She was 94 and a half and she died. And that was about six years ex -- I\nthink it\u2019s six years ago.",
        "Q: You mention your father died in \u201856, during the uprising, was it -- did 1t have\nsomething --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- to do with the uprising, or --",

        "A: Well, it started in \u201871. Until then the Chicago symphony was an unknown, great\norchestra. But \u201871 with Shorty, we went to Europe the first time and since then, several\ntimes to Europe and to Japan and Russia and Australia. We were all over.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Quarter of a century, right.",
        "A: At ce -- at certain -- at certain times it happened, but generally speaking, not. But at\none point, when we were in Hamburg, I went out to see the -- the place where the\nCaparkone wa -- bombing happened and since then there were some books written and\nthere are -- there is a museum there and I didn\u2019t feel at home too much when I went back\nto Hungary. We went -- we were in Russia and then we went to Hungary and -- and\nVienna, to play a concert each. It ba -- it brought back memories, but for some reason, I\nwasn\u2019t too upset about what happened. But as concertmaster of the Berlin opera house\nsince -- I mean from -- for \u201850 -- f -- \u201850 til \u201854. I took this as a rehabilitation -- kind of\nrestitution, because I made it -- I play in a proba -- a -- a -- an audition and I ma -- got the\njob and I lived there for three years, almost four. And I made some very good friends.\nNot -- not all of them were -- were -- were avid Nazis. And they treated me very nicely,\nso I -- I didn\u2019t have any bad feelings about being back to Euro -- to Germany,\nspecifically, and Berlin.",
        "A: Yeah, it is --",
        "A: It was -- it was like that, I took it that way. Some -- some people couldn\u2019t understand\nhow can you live in Germany. But everybody is little different.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: C-a-p-a-r-c-o -- no, a-r-k-o-n-e. Caparkone. Well, in English it\u2019s with a c, I think in\nGermany it was also the same way, the spelling of the -- of this ship. That was a 37,000\nton Hamburg - South America liner. And since then I discovered, by accident, that when\nthe Germans made a f-film of the Titanic, in \u201841, they used this ship for the feeling of that\n-- of the Titanic.",
        "A: They made they -- they are the -- very famous movie, it was during the war time. And\nthis is the -- the ship they used.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: There were three -- three big ship in the Bay of Lubec. And that\u2019s the North Sea and\nwhat we found out afterwards, there was no fuel on the ships. So what they planned with\nus, nobody knows. M-Most likely, they wanted to do something to -- to get rid of all this\nper -- concentration camp prisoners, but the British took it into their hands on -- on May\nthird. And they were on the ships in the afternoon. And there was about 7,000 who died\nand maybe 400 who -- who are alive.",
        "A: Who were alive.",
        "A: The British bombed it because everything was going -- going north. The -- the -- the\nGermans were evacuating and -- and sending all the troops further north and they thought\nthat thasat -- these ships are transport ships for -- for German military. But what came out\nlater -- what was found out, that the -- Bannerat, the -- the Swe-Swedish Bannerat -- the\nSwedish what?",
        "A: Count. Yes, Count Bannerat had a meeting with Himmler in -- in Lubec. That\u2019s where\nthey -- they shipped us in f-from. To the -- to the big ships. And he found out that there\nare sh -- pris-prisoners -- concen-concentration camp prisoners on these ships and by\neight o\u2019clock in the morning, the British got the mes-message that don\u2019t bomb these ships\nbecause they are innocent survivors of -- of the concentration camps and the British\nsupposedly said, \u201cIt\u2019s too late.\u201d And at 2:30 they bombed the ships.",
        "A: So, coincidences happened, nobody knows what happen -- really caused them.",
        "A: It sure is. There is a film that was made by a German young man who -- who\nhappened to -- to be spending some vacation time at the North Sea, and he\u2019s -- heard\nabout that there is a -- a memorial for the Holocaust ma -- victims, 7,000 of them. And he\nstarted to dig in and -- and look -- look into it. And he found ca -- found out all kinds of\ndetails and he found a few survivors, including me. And he made a film at -- a\ndocumentary about it. Unfortunately, the film is not well known at all, because the\nEnglish subtitles are not legible. Very -- they didn\u2019t have enough money to -- to do the\nright subtitling. And that\u2019s -- that\u2019s where it is. It was played in -- I mean, it was shown in\n-- in Germany several ti -- several places, in France and in Holland. But, many people\nknow about the Titanic, everybody knows about the Titanic. Nobody knows about the\nCaparkone and the Deutschland. And the Athena, there was three ships.",
        "A: Right. There were only -- only about 400 all together that survived. And 7,000 are at -\n- known dead. So they -- they knew the numbers that -- that were shipped -- put -- put on\nthe ships. So this film was done on a very si -- very low budget. This is a one man\noperation, basically. The guy is from Berlin and he was trying his best. But a -- without\nenough backing, is not going to be well-known anywhere.",
        "A: Right. So you\u2019re experience actually, on the -- you know, your quote unquote, \u201cDay\nof Liberation\u201d --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Of jumping into the -- into the cold sea and being lucky enough to be fished out by --\nby some little boat that was around the ship and getting into the -- o-on land, when the\nBritish came in, that was a -- a -- barracks -- some kind of barracks when we -- we came\non -- on shore and the British tanks were coming in and -- and tearing down the -- the\nflags. And then we -- we had nothing. Basically zero. What we had on was wet and that --\nthat was what -- what we owned, the few people who -- who survived. So the British\nwent into different houses and told the Germans, give these people eat -- to eat, give\nthese people something to wear and shoes and -- and this is how I started my new life.",
        "A: Well, they -- they had no idea what\u2019s going on. They only saw the -- the British come\nin and they didn\u2019t know what were these wet -- wet people came from. They -- they saw\nsome bombing maybe, but they didn\u2019t know that those -- those -- the concentration camp\nprisoners, until they saw them with -- with the hair shor-shorn and no -- well, nobody had\nanything, but basically, no-nobody has a -- had a piece of paper to -- to prove who they\nwere. Anyway, the British then -- then gave us some -- some identification cards. But it\nwas hairy.",
        "A: Very hairy.",
        "A: In very many ways. You -- you didn\u2019t know who you were talking to, whether it was a\n-- a Nazi who -- who was trying to kill you before and who 1s now trying to -- to save his\nown hide or -- or whether it was somebody who just came off the ship, by accident.\nAnyway, it was very -- a long time ago, so I can\u2019t remember. Then it was difficult to get -\n- get where you wanted to go, because that -- the French and the Belgians, I think and the\nPoles sent their -- their people to -- to collect their own people, because there -- they were\nnotified. But anybody behind the Iron Curtain, like -- like Hungarians and Czechs and --\nnobody cared really, but there was a United Nations relief organization, you -- the\nUNRRA, Unrah, and I had a chance to -- actually, I -- I found somewhere -- I organized\nmyself a -- a violin and through -- through -- through the British, I became a -- a violinist\nfor the officer\u2019s club. I didn\u2019t know much -- too many British officer songs anyway, but I\n-- I survived somehow and I played a little bit. Of course, it was difficult because -- I\nspoke a little English, but not -- now, my English is better, my acc-accent is the same.\nBut I had to make myself understood. And s-si -- one of the officers helped me to get\nnotification to the Red Cross, because I had an uncle in Ankara who survived the war in -\n- in Turkey. And I knew his address. I didn\u2019t have a chance to send anything to Budapest,\nbecause I -- I didn\u2019t know whether my parents were alive or not, first of all and secondly\nthere was no c-communication or -- or mail or anything like that. But through the Red\nCross, I -- I sent a note to my uncle, who then notified my parents that I was alive. So it\ntook four months until I -- I finally got back to Hungary -- to Budapest. Mayas -- with a\nCzech transport. There was nothing going on for -- for Hungarians. But I -- I joined at\nthat Czech transport and I got back somehow. On buses, on trains, on -- had no money, of\ncourse. And then I went to -- to my old apartment, not knowing whether my mother is\naround, or my father. That\u2019s where they -- they deported me from, originally. And so they\nwere alive. And then I became concertmaster of the -- of the Budapest Concert Orchestra.\nThey knew it through my mother that I was alive and they were waiting for me, as a --\nwith -- with that position. And those were the first few months, everything was very\ndifficult. There was inflation, there was no -- no food, no money, no nothing. Basically, it\nwas terrible times. And it was basically Russian occupation. So, we went through all\nkinds of horror stories. But I played. I practice, I played and I got back into the swing of\nthings and then I left. Some of us felt that the -- the world is open, now that the war is\nover, the world is open for -- for -- for us talented, good, good instrumentalists, et-\netcetera. And we went over to Austria and then to France and we ha -- we s -- we had a --\nwith some colleagues, I played in a string quartet and nothing really j-jived. Because the\nworld wasn\u2019t open. In France, you couldn\u2019t -- couldn\u2019t get a job if you didn\u2019t have\nnationality -- I mean, didn\u2019t belong to -- even -- even as a -- as a foreigner, if you didn\u2019t\nhave the right kind of papers, you couldn\u2019t get a job. So when I went back, I played an\naudition for the opera. They were looking for a concertmaster in Budapest and I got the\njob. I was the youngest concertmaster they ever had in the Budapest Philharmonic. Twas\nlike -- like in Vienna, the Philharmonic and the opera orchestra is the same -- or was the\nsame. And I was there for -- for a season, two seasons and somebody who knew me from\nway back, when I was a student -- this lady was a pianist and she survived the war in -- in\n-- in Sweden. And she recommended me for concertmaster to come to Gurterburg, in\nSweden. So I got the passport, I didn\u2019t promise them anything, but I went out to -- to play\nthe audition. And after I played out the -- the audition and I was -- I got the job, then I\nwent back to Budapest -- oh, I went back and I got a year of -- va -- leave of absence -- a\nleave, yeah. And then I never went back, afterwards. I didn\u2019t go back, I went out to\nSweden and I was concertmaster in Gurterburg for three years. Then there was an\nopening in Berlin and they wanted me to come. I played an audition again. I got the job\nand that\u2019s when I started in the opera house. This Shtetisher oper, meaning civic opera,\nbut that was one of the big operas. They had three in -- in Berlin -- 1n West Berlin and in\nEast Berlin, there were three or four opera houses, but three of -- three of them were\nfamous. The Startsh oper and the Commisher oper was -- were in East Berlin. My opera,\nthe Shtetisher oper was West Berlin. And I never went over to the east side, because I\nwasn\u2019t interested in it. I knew -- knew what Communism is and I knew what Russian\noccupation is, I wasn\u2019t interested. But that was an interesting life. West Berlin was -- was\nan island in -- in -- in Germany. And that was very good, until I got my American pa --\nvisa, which took eight -- eight years I was waiting for the American visa. And when I got\nit, I couldn\u2019t say, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t come, because I have a good job in Berlin.\u201d So I came to\nAmerica.",
        "A: Much more distinctive.",
        "A: Just looking.",
        "A: Yeah. It was -- it was -- I was right in the middle of tt.",
        "A: I -- I never really verbalized it, but I suppose it was the time when I saw the English\nsoldiers cam -- coming 1n the -- in the tanks, into this Ubertshooter -- what is an\nUbertshooter -- un -- submarine school, basically. It was in the submarine school where --\nwhere the left side of the -- the harbor, that we hit land with these little boats that helped.\nNot too many. And at the same time, this Bri-British tanks were coming from the right\nand those British soldiers took down the Nazi flag that was still o-on -- on the flagpole.\nAnd I suppose that was the time that I was liberated, because now -- now I could speak\nEnglish to the English soldiers. So that was -- that was the end of the war for me. I didn\u2019t\nknow it\u2019s -- May three is -- is just a date. And now I know what it was, cause they were --\nfive more days they -- they went on with the war, but that was almost the ho -- the end.",
        "A: Yeah, I suppose that was it.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t -- no, it didn\u2019t. I was wet and cold and I was worried. I really didn\u2019t -- didn\u2019t\nfeel liberated, but that was it, cause I was liberated, basically. And I survived. The other\n7,000 died.",
        "A: Nobody -- nobody really asked me what happened. They -- they just -- somehow they\n-- they must have known it from other people, too. I probably told them, I don\u2019t\nremember exactly what -- what I told them, that we were on the ship and the ship was\nbombed, that -- and who we are. Maybe I did, but they -- they seem to have known that\nthese are people who should be helped, these are not Nazis coming out of the water.",
        "A: After -- after the fact, I\u2019ve -- I felt very resentful, but I was glad that it was over. It was\nover because of them. That was a big, big mistake that they made and nobody can explain\nhow it happened. Nobody really could find out details. This guy who -- who made the\nfilm went all -- all the way to -- to the British command and --",
        "A: -- he interviewed -- he interviewed some of the pilots -- no, that was in the Stern\nmagazine, that was a -- a -- a serial that they had an interview with the pilots and they\nreally did not have any inkling what they did. But then when they found out, it was --\nthey had regrets, too. So thousands -- thousands perished and a few hundred were\nSUIVIVOTS.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: It was very difficult for everybody, basically because -- because of the Russians. The\nRussians took as much as whatever could they -- could take out besides the -- the -- the --\nthe Nazis ruined Budapest with street fights. And I remember when -- when they\ndeported me, first they took us -- that was night -- evening, raids during the day and\nduring the evening, they put -- put together I don\u2019t know how many hundreds of Jews\ninto the big synagogue -- that\u2019s the biggest in Europe, the hung -- the -- the Budapest\nsynagogue, and that\u2019s where we were -- we were kept and during the night, we heard de-\ndemolition sounds. All but one bridge -- bridges were detonated and -- and there was no\nconnection between Pest and Buda, other than one that they left. And that\u2019s where we\nwent over to the Buda side. In the morning --",
        "A: And this 1s -- this is November four an -- \u201844.",
        "A: During the war when -- when the -- the Hungarian Nazis took over the government\nand they rounded up all the Jews. Most of them into ghettos, but some of us were\ndeported right away. And we walked to vie -- to Vienna under -- under guns. So that was\ncoming back to -- to this place, to -- to Budapest, 1t was ruined by -- by the Germans and\nit was ruined by the Hungarian Nazis and then it was ruined by the Russians. So it was a\npretty bad situation, but everybody tried to survive and there was no -- no difference\nbetween Jews, non-Jews. We -- we were musicians. We played in the orchestra and --\nand there was craving for -- for some culture after awhile, but we played in this overcoats\nbecause there was no heat. So it was a very, very strange situation.",
        "A: Yeah, most of it, most of it. The only place where -- where there were some surviving\nJews, was in Budapest, because of the ghetto situation and there was -- there were some -\n- some houses that were under Swedish and Swiss protection, supposedly. Well, they\ntook me from a Swedish -- Swedish pro-protected house, too. But in general, Jews from\nthe countryside were deported much earlier than -- than what happened to me, or us. And\nthe surviving Hungarian Jews were all either in hiding or in -- in ghettos that were so-\ncalled liberated by the Russians.",
        "A: We didn\u2019t really know too much in the beginning, who survived, who didn\u2019t survive?\nWho was around, who wasn\u2019t around? It was a strange world all together. And I\nremember that a school -- school friend of mine, I didn\u2019t see him again, not until just a\nfew years ago, he was in -- in Chicago and he talked to me. I knew his father was 1n the\nsame transport, walking to Vienna and then on the -- on the cattle car wizness going to --\nbeing transported to Hamburg mayan gummer. And I saw him die in -- in the camp. He\nwas in the same barracks where -- where I was. So, I didn\u2019t see him when I came home,\nbut I knew certain things. And I saw one of my friend from school, who became a -- a\npartisan in -- in -- in Russia, fighting on the side of the Russians, against the Germans. He\ncame back with the Russians to Budapest and became a high positioned police officer,\nwho was trying to find and did find th-the Nazis who -- the Hungarian Nazis who were\nresponsible for most of the atrocities that took place. So it was strange, it was a very\nstrange world and -- and -- and I left it behind and came back to it. But by then it was a\nlittle better, where I was concertmaster in the opera house, but we still didn\u2019t have peace.\nNot just peace, but bombed out buildings and -- and bombed out apartments and -- and\nvery little -- very little food. The Russians took as much as was movable, they took. They\n-- they dismantled toilets in the hotels and -- and washing -- wash basins and took them,\nbecause most of these -- these so-called soldiers, they have never seen anything that rem -\n- rem -- that is close to co-comfort and that is close to luxury. So they -- they got -- they\nwent wild. They took the watches off -- off your arm and they had -- some of them had\nfive, six watches on their arms. Duvi, duvi, that was the -- the word. Give, give, whatever\nyou can. And they took the rings off the fingers of the people and -- and the watches and\nit was a very strange world, but you know, it just comes to me sporadically, when I talk\nabout it. Otherwise, I don\u2019t think about it.",
        "A: It was after all five -- 50 years ago. 45 -- more then 50 years ago.",
        "A: -- talk about it. Otherwise, I don\u2019t think about tt.",
        "A: It was after all five -- 50 years ago. 45 -- more then 50 years ago.",
        "A: Well, not that -- not in that vein, what you were just saying, the last sentence. It -- you\njust keep on living. But help, yes, because in the concentration camp, I survived because\nthe -- the guy who was in -- in charge of my barracks -- for some reason, I don\u2019t know\nwhy and how he -- he found out that I am playing the violin and -- and there was sudden-\nsuddenly there was a violin. And every evening they were -- they were trying to -- to\nkeep up their spirits and they were singing -- there were Polish people, German people,\nHungarians, all mixture. And I was playing the violin for them and this guy liked it. So\nhe really saved my life, basically, because there were transports going out of that camp to\nBergen-Belsen and to Auschwitz and he always saved me. So that\u2019s sh -- music helped\nme a lot.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: It\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- 1t\u2019s my story, so -- and that I remember very well.",
        "A: Later, when I was concertmaster in Berlin, somehow I connected with him -- either he\nconnected with me or I connected with him, but then I lost track of him. So we are now\nback in America, \u201854.",
        "A: To get the visa, because of -- of the -- the what do you call it, quota system. Okay, a\nHungarian, no matter where you -- I ask for my visa in Paris, but I was born in Budapest,\nso it went under a Hungarian quota and it took -- took six years until -- or s -- eight years\nuntil I got it.",
        "A: Yeah?",
        "A: That was in \u201846.",
        "A: Because America was -- was everybody\u2019s -- in everybody\u2019s mind, that was the place\nwhere to -- where to escape, where to go. A free country and -- and you -- you get what\nyou -- what you deserve as far as, you know, your -- your knowledge, your talent,\nwhatever. And that was well-known before the war, during the war, after the war.\nAmerica was the place where to go. Many people went to Canada, many people went to\nAustralia. Sweden wasn\u2019t bad either, but I -- I didn\u2019t feel like I belonged to Sweden,\nbecause it was so even. Everybody had everything, basically and no big difference\nbetween ups and downs. The -- the best and not -- not -- and the worst. It was very much\nin equilibrium. I -- somehow I didn\u2019t feel -- when I went this German -- the Berlin\nposition was offered to me, that I should come and play -- audition -- audition, I didn\u2019t\nhesitate. I could have stayed in -- in Sweden and become a -- a satisfied, even keeled\nperson.",
        "A: Well, it -- you can -- you can say that somehow, yes, but there are some Swedes who\nare not boring, either. But I was too young for -- for settling down for good -- good life,\nin general. I had a good job and it was very nice, but it wasn\u2019t exciting enough.",
        "A: Yeah?",
        "A: Well, I was concertmaster in Berlin, I didn\u2019t want to go anywhere else, but I had an\noffer from Swede -- Switzerland, also. I p-played -- played a solo in [indecipherable]\nwith the -- with the orchestra there and they wanted me to come from Berlin to -- to\nSwitzerland, but th-then the American visa came and it was really difficult to say no,\nbecause that was, you know, originally the idea, to come to America, now here 1s a visa. I\ncouldn\u2019t say no.",
        "A: I came over in January, \u201854. And the previous summer, I was concert -- I was one of\nthe members of the Casals Festival Orchestra, that has several concertmasters from --\nfrom America and from other places, from Canada. And I made friends with -- with a few\nand they told me it will be very difficult. First of all, you have to become a member of the\nunion before you even can -- can play an audition. And then you have to settle for what --\nwhat\u2019s -- what\u2019s available. So it wasn\u2019t an -- an open book. So I came over, I had to stay\nin New York, I was staying in New York for awhile. And I couldn\u2019t play an audition for\nthe opening for the following years, but I was offered a -- a position that was not a union\nposition. The Aspen School of Music, the Aspen Festival was av-available for me and\nthat\u2019s where I we-went during the summer, which wasn\u2019t a bad summer, to spend the first\nsummer in -- in America in Aspen, which was very nice. And then I had to fly back to --\nto New York to get my union card and then I played an audition and made it into the\nMinneapolis Symphony, as leader of the second violins. And that lasted one year. I mean\nit would -- could have lasted longer, but I wasn\u2019t -- wasn\u2019t satisfied, I -- I wasn\u2019t happy\nwith just being third or fourth member of the -- of the hierarchy in the violins. And there\nwas an opening in -- in Chicago. I played the audition in Chicago and got the job and\nmoved to Chicago. That was \u201855. And I stayed, got married, have two daughters and I am\nhere now for -- assistant concertmaster for 44 seasons, which is long time with one\norchestra.",
        "A: Phyllis.",
        "A: Daughter are Katie, or Kate, as -- as she likes to be called and Judy. And Judy has two\nlittle ones, Justin is 11, well 10, basically and Melissa is eight. And I am a proud gra-\ngrandfather. Phyllis has three daughters, they are older. My -- my -- my older daughter is\n40 and her older d -- older daughter is a little more than 40, I think 42. She has three\nlovely ladies and I have two, so we are f -- a family of five girls and her oldest daughter\nhas two sons, so we have three grandsons and one granddaughter.",
        "A: Yeah, over here, yeah. She is from Chicago. And she graduated as a piano major in --\nat Northwestern. So music brought us together, basically.",
        "A: Yes, s-s-slowly and -- and a little bit. Not -- not much. But my daughters know most\nof it and they -- they know the -- the tapes -- the -- the interviews that I made, it probably\ngives them more than what I gave them before. And with the grandchildren, not -- not\nyet. Not yet, but after awhile I\u2019m sure they -- they will find out. It\u2019s very difficult to, you\nknow, to just give them one part and not the whole story and the whole story is too long\nand too difficult to understand and -- so I\u2019m -- I never really sat down, now you look, you\n-- you listen, okay? I didn\u2019t do that.",
        "A: Not really, I -- it was no subject, but I think now that they are old enough to -- to\nunderstand, at least partially, what -- what I can tell them. I -- I's -- really thought -- the\nother day I just -- I was just thinking I will sit down with the older ones together and --\nand talk -- tell them a little bit.",
        "A: Yeah, these are grandchildren.",
        "A: There was a time when we -- we belonged to -- to a Temple and there I -- then I was\ntalking to them a little bit, because I was still -- I was asked to talk to the class to -- you\nknow, Sunday school. And I told them a little bit, very little. It\u2019s very difficult to -- to\nmake them understand. When they go to the Holocaust Museum, they will understand\nmuch more than the -- what I -- I can give them, I think. But this is a wonderful thing that\n-- that interview business, that they are going to try to -- to make the next and the next\ngeneration understand what -- what it is and what it was.\nsomething that you don\u2019t think about that often any more? Is it something that y -- that is\nwith you a lot?",
        "A: No, I -- I have met people who think about it all the time and who talk about it all the\ntime and I wasn\u2019t that way. I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s my nature, probably. I got over it.\nSomehow I -- I probably got hurt by it, but I didn\u2019t dwell on it for a long, long time. Then\n-- then I became more interested in 1t when -- when it became -- I think mostly with --\nwith the interview, with the Holocaust Museum interview, that I should remember it\nmore and -- and talk about it more. The first time this Caparkone story came out, a friend\nof mine from London sent me a clipping from -- from the Times that was kind of a\ndescription of the Stan magazine\u2019s articles that came out every week, as a serial, about\nthe Caparkone. So, the only -- only reason I knew about it, because he send me a Time\nmag -- and then I -- I started buying the Stan magazine issues. And that\u2019s how it all s-\nstarted, really. And then I -- I knew about the -- the man who -- who wrote the book a\nlittle bit, who -- who wrote the -- the articles, the serial in the Stan Magazine, he also put\nit in a boo-book form and I got in touch with him. And then later I sent them some -- sent\nhim some material that I had, like the -- the first identification card that I got from the\nBritish [indecipherable] in Noistat and other stuff. Then we -- we became friendly,\nbecause he -- he looked me up when I was in Hamburg with the symphony. And he took\nme back to the memorial that -- that\u2019s on the beach in Noistat, over the Lubec Bay. And\nso I got into more -- more and more to discuss, to talk about it, to -- to think about it. But\nI am not -- not upset any more. I was -- it was a long time ago and I survived, that was\nthe main -- that -- that\u2019s my main feeling.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Well, I went -- I went to see \u201cSchindler\u2019s List\u201d and I was very -- very much taken by\nit, because it was very close to what I understoo -- what I -- what I experienced. So yes, I\ndo -- I do see it [indecipherable] lot, the last -- what was it, the six days of -- the invasion.\n\u201cThe Longest Day\u201d was a film and -- and things like that, yes, I do see it. I do -- I do\nremember a lot, but I -- I wasn\u2019t going to see the \u201cTitanic\u201d, it -- I don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t care\nmuch for the -- for the story, because I have my own story and -- and it was -- with all the\nlove story that w-went with it and all that, I -- I really wasn\u2019t interested in it. It\u2019s bad\nenough that it happened, but to me that\u2019s not entertainment.",
        "A: Ah, yeah. Right, right.",
        "A: In \u201855, yeah 43 years.",
        "A: 53 years.",
        "A: 40, oh now, fif -- 43 years, right.",
        "A: Well, I think so. Well, there\u2019s one -- one Hungarian colleague of mine who is -- who\nis here, who -- who hasn\u2019t been in concentration camp, but he was in -- in -- in -- d-\ndrafted in the Hungarian army just like I was. And he is a survivor, because he was\naround, he was Jewish. And I don\u2019t know too many. We have -- we have several who\nwere not born in this country, but I don\u2019t -- don\u2019t know of anybody who is -- or the -- the\nguy who is a Czech. He -- he came out after the war, so he survived the -- the war. But he\nis not Jewish, so it\u2019s not the same category. I don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t know of any other.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: No, it was -- it was just not an issue. It -- it was too much of an issue before and\nduring the war. See, before the war, when | -- I was in the academy as a student and we\nhad a competition and I won the competition as the best student of -- of the first year of --\nof the course, of academy. And -- and they had some bad demonstrations before and\nduring. After that, I was coming down with the violin that -- that I just won, who -- where\nthe director of the academy handed it to me and as I was coming down the st -- the steps,\nsome of them were screaming about the girl who didn\u2019t win, that was not Jewish. They\nsaid, \u201cNever mind, you have your violin in your hand, but she is the winner anyway.\u201d S-\nStuff like that, there was -- there was numerous clauses that was a -- the 10 percent what\ndo you call it?",
        "A: Quota system in the universities and the academies counted as university. But I was in\nbefore -- before the -- became worse. And at the end there was no-nobody who was\nJewish who -- who could play publicly. We had to play concerts in the private homes.\nThis is during and -- during the war -- before, during the war, basically. Because the war\nstarted in 1939 and ended in \u201845, so it was six years and in -- during that time, I finished\nthe academy and got my -- my diplomas, etcetera. There was no -- no anti-Semit -- open\nanti-Semitism after the war, basically, because there were too many Jewish people who --\nsome -- some survivors basically, but the -- on -- on -- in positions, because they came in\nwith the Russians or the Russians put them in, so as I -- as I mentioned, this friend of\nmine, who became a -- a high -- high official officer of -- of the Hungarian -- well, it\u2019s\npolice - sickel -- sickel police, whatever it was, I don\u2019t know exactly, but there were\nmany of those who were put in. So no open anti-Semitism e-existed.",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: Well, it might have, I don\u2019t know. A-All I know is that I had -- had to practice a lot to\nmake up for all the time that I didn\u2019t see a violin, when I came back to -- to Budapest\nafter -- after the war. And it -- it took quite a while to get back to normalcy. I don\u2019t know\nif -- if the development had -- had anything to do with -- with the experience. I mean, yo -\n- yO -- my -- my musical development -- I was pretty well developed, I think, because I\nwasn\u2019t a youngster any more when I came back. It might have had some influence.",
        "A: Maybe, I don\u2019t know. No, I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: Better minds than I couldn\u2019t answer this question. It was the most organized\ndisorganized kind of life. When I tell you that they -- they took transports -- th-the camp -\n- Neuengamme was basically a -- a transit camp. They had -- I got sick when I -- in -- I\nthink two or three weeks into -- into the camp life, I got -- I think pneumonia and they --\nthey put me in the hospital barracks, that they had a hel -- hospital barracks, where they\ntook care of you with m -- with medication and then from the hospital barracks, they took\nthem to Bergen-Belsen, on the transport, to -- to put them in -- in gas chambers, so if that\ncan explain anything, it\u2019s organized disorganization, it\u2019s impossible to -- to -- to get an\nanswer.",
        "A: No, no, no, absolutely not. That \u201cSchindler\u2019s List\u201d shows you basically what -- what\nwent on behind this -- behind this scenes of -- of themselves. So the -- the officers and --\nand some of those people who -- Schindler himself was -- was a Nazi, basically, to begin\nwith. That\u2019s -- some -- some -- some of them had better human feelings than -- than\nothers. No, it was -- it was something that -- that nobody can understand.",

        "A: None. No, no, absolutely not. The times I -- I associate with this -- is probably my --\nmy youth, when I -- when I learned certain pieces and then later the -- when I played\nthem again. But has very little connotation.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: I played folk songs. I don\u2019t know what I played and how I played them.",
        "A: No, no, absolutely not. They were singing and I was trying to -- to emulate what I\nheard. But there was -- you know, lots of Polish non-Jews in that camp -- in that barracks\nwhere I was and Austrians and Germans and Czechs and Hungarian -- very few\nHungarians, by the way. And it wasn\u2019t a -- a -- a Jewish barracks at -- at all, it was all\nmixed. And so we had blackouts, because the bombers were going over Hamburg, to\nBerlin and Leipzig and all the other places that they were bombing. This was right in the\nmiddle of the last winter of -- of the war. And so the blackouts, th-they turned off the\nlights and there was nothing else to do, either -- either you -- you -- you were sleeping or\nyou were singing. Yeah, it was a strange, strange world, but I was lucky that -- I don\u2019t\nknow how I would have survived, probably never -- I wouldn\u2019t have survived. But th-this\n-- playing helped.",
        "A: Well, my wife went -- went to Dachau when we were in Munich and she was very,\nvery touched and impressed by that and -- and she will never forget it. And, as I told you,\nI went -- went out with -- with this guy to -- to the memorial -- to the memorial at -- in\nNice-Nicestadt, which is in Lubec Bay. And I went out to see the old camp once when I\nwas in Hamburg.",
        "A: Neuen-Neuengamme, my camp. And that is just a -- a big obelisk and -- and names of\nall the countries that were represented by -- by pro -- prisoners and how many from --\nfrom which country. I didn\u2019t see any of the -- the -- I saw an interesting thing when I was\nin -- we were in Brussels and we took a -- took a sightseeing bus with my wife. And next\nto the highway, the -- the driver slowed down and he said, \u201cThis is the place where they\nkept the Jews before they were sent to -- to Germany, and this is Belgium.\u201d So that\u2019s --\nthat\u2019s the other place that I have seen.",
        "A: It wasn\u2019t there, no, it wasn\u2019t there at -- many, many, many years later, 1t was just a --\nthe mem-memorial to the camp and s -- fields, I think.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Because I know what it 1s like, or what was -- what it was like. There were barracks\neverywhere, but what was interesting that -- that we saw in Paris, there is a -- a memorial\nto the -- to the French -- it doesn\u2019t say Jews. It -- 1t is behind the Notterdam, sunk in the --\nin the ground. You ge -- go down many, many steps and the sign outside says, \u201cTo the\nmemory of deportees\u201d and then the number, hundred some thousand. And you go in,\ndownstairs, underground, there is lights and every German concentration camps name,\nbecause there\u2019s a lot of French Jews who were in different camps. But it has nothing to\ndo with Jews, it -- they don\u2019t want to have anything to do with it. And so that\u2019s -- you can\ncut this out if you want to. It -- that -- that\u2019s another place where -- where we saw a\nmemorial. It\u2019s -- it\u2019s a very touching scene because it\u2019s underground, it\u2019s like a cellar and\nit\u2019s like bars and lights, little lights. And Yad Vashem, of course, we saw Yad Vashem.\nThat\u2019s -- when we were in Israel we went to see Yad Vashem and that\u2019s the first time my\nwife saw the name written, Neuengamme. So it -- it wasn\u2019t fictitious, 1t was real for her,\nyou know?",
        "A: No. No, for some reason, I didn\u2019t. I was brought up -- we were never really -- really\nreligious. We were Jewish and that meant all the troubles that came with being Jewish,\nbut -- and we went to -- to -- my uncle went every Friday to -- to service, but my parents\nonly went to -- to high holidays. And I was Bar Mitzvah, but I wasn\u2019t brought up\nreligious. So that was one of --\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "A: -- to -- my uncle went every Friday to -- to service, but my parents only went to -- to\nhigh holidays. And I was Bar Mitzvah, but I wasn\u2019t brought up religious. So that was one\nof the reasons, probably, that I never sort of go into Israel.",
        "A: Yeah, I have to mention -- I have to mention that my wife was always much more\nJewish than I was. I mean, in her life. And she went to -- to -- after school -- she went to a\nJewish school. She know -- she knows how to read and write Yiddish, so she\u2019s much\nmore into Judaism than I was. But she enjoyed it when she went -- went -- after school,\nshe went to this school and she enjoyed it and she still knows how to write and read.",
        "A: How to talk -- how to speak Yiddish.",
        "A: Oh my -- my father was deported, but my mother somehow got -- got him out. They\nwere in a -- ina open air, giant -- not a stadium, but it -- 1t\u2019s a -- the factory kind of thing.\nAnd my mother got him out, he -- he was sick, too. And they survived in the apartment\nwhere -- where we lived. And my father died in the end of the revolution in \u201856. And I\nbrought my mother out in \u00b057. I paid -- paid in for -- for those wonderful Russians who --\nwho were doing this humanitarian deed, to bring people out of Hungary, into Austria,\nacross that little bridge that was ma -- named in one of those books, for good money --\ngood do -- good dollars they got f-for their humanitarian act. And she came out here and\nshe died here. She was 94 and a half and she died. And that was about six years ex -- I\nthink it\u2019s six years ago.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: No, no, no, no, no, just -- it was very difficult times, but they couldn\u2019t get a doctor and\nthey couldn\u2019t go anywhere and it was very bad. Now, unfortunately, when I went -- when\nI was back in -- in Hungary -- in Hungary, I didn\u2019t have a chance to even look for where\nhe was.",
        "A: Carway, which means Charles in Hungarian. And my mother was Rosa.",
        "A: No, I -- I think I brought up everything, but even if you didn\u2019t ask, I brought it up. I\nthink it was very good.",
        "A: Thank you.",
        "A: No, I -- I -- not today. I have to go home, because I have a rehearsal in the evening\nhere. Oh, Highland Park Strings, I didn\u2019t mention. I am conducting the Highland Park\nStrings, which is basically an amateur music lovers group and this is our 20th season\nstarting. I\u2019m going to start the rehearsal today -- tonight. 20 seasons we have been\nplaying string music and we have been going to -- we were -- we were once in Italy for a\nfew concerts and we are supposed to be going to Israel this December.",
        "A: That group is called the Highland Park Strings and it\u2019s a nice group of people and I\u2019m\nhaving all kinds of soloists with -- with them and we have always -- mostly -- five\nconcerts a -- a season.",
        "A: Good. I thank you.\n"
