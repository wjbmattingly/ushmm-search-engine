She said\nbring it with you. But I was young and little so 1t was a hill that you have to climb up. SO I was\nholding onto this painting and painting. Then my brother he was, one habit he had. He counted\nhow many people he had and he saw one was missing. I was the one was missing. He came back\nand threw the painting in the water and he grabbed me and there was only a certain time that you\ncould do it. And then the Russians put us in jail for 24 hours.",

But in order convince them, he took one of my cousins and with him as a\nwitness and that he did the job. And then.",
        "Q: Did what kind of job?",

        "A: Who?",
        "Q: The Russian soldiers?",
        "A: No they did their job and they put us in jail. And then they have of course, I don\u2019t\u2019 know who\nwas there and they probably discussed the incident. And then they decided that they let us go.",

So the Russians said you know it was like an\nexchanging. The Russians went out and the Germans came in and vice versa, but then the\nRussians came in and then they had to disappear so they said to the Jewish population that the\nGermans killed the men not the women.

She said\nbring it with you. But I was young and little so 1t was a hill that you have to climb up. SO I was\nholding onto this painting and painting. Then my brother he was, one habit he had. He counted\nhow many people he had and he saw one was missing. I was the one was missing. He came back\nand threw the painting in the water and he grabbed me and there was only a certain time that you\ncould do it. And then the Russians put us in jail for 24 hours.",

But my brother knew a few words and he said I will work hard and I will\ndo this, so they finally accepted us. And he wanted to unite us with my father and the brothers\nand with my uncle. But in order convince them, he took one of my cousins and with him as a\nwitness and that he did the job. And then.",

        "A: It was near Lvov. This was already the next town.",
        "A: We stayed there you know I don\u2019t know how long it took. But I know that one of these days\nthe Russians said you know if you want to go back you can go back. If you want to go with us or\nstay here. You can stay. But my oldest brother, he wanted to go back. And being, if you said\nyou want to go back, they treated you as traitors. So one night without even knowing anything,\nthe Russians came. Always, they always did come midnight and they took us everybody and they\ntook us on a train with cattle you know.",

We weren\u2019t familiar with the surroundings with, with\nnothing. We didn\u2019t know where we were going but we wound up. One day we wound up in\nSiberia.",
        "A: Of course.",
        "A: Not that I know of.",
        "A: It was a very tense atmosphere. It was a, I mean we didn\u2019t get enough food, enough water. It\nwas three days and finally when we arrived you know how they treat the refugees or like\nanybody else until you settle down. And then we found out we\u2019re in Siberia.",
        "A: I wouldn\u2019t know exactly.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember being warm there, believe me. it was always cold. It was so cold in the\nwinter that we didn\u2019t go out. Because the snow was very deep and in Siberia there is very little\nsummer.",
        "A: To Novosibirsk.",
        "A: Yes, a very big city but we weren\u2019t 1n the city. We were in the outskirts of the city, it was like\na camp.",
        "A: Probably.",
        "A: It was like barracks you know. It was all the people were in the same barracks. There were a\nfew, I\u2019m sure there were more there. And this was it. And we had --",

        "A: We were in the barracks.",
        "A: Yes, everybody got the rations. You know every child and every grown up they got the\nrations. And how we survived is because my brothers were older so they, my mother just\nmaneuvered around to give the boys more than the girls so that\u2019s how we survived. They needed\nmore food.",
        "A: To work and they were older.",
        "A: Ihave no idea. I have no idea and I think if my brothers would be here or whether they would\nbe able to tell you. I really don\u2019t know.",
        "A: Well we were, I guess everybody was miserable you know. And everybody came home\nprobably they were tired and then and they were glad to go to sleep or something. I don\u2019t\u2019\nremember too many conversations that went on that what I know. I\u2019m sure they did but I don\u2019t\nknow.",

        "A: Well we were inside until they transferred us to the Urals. I think this was I don\u2019t know how\nlong it was. Was it a half a year or three quarters of a year. I have no idea. And they transferred\nus to the Urals.",
        "A: The whole family, most of, I guess the whole camp. And that\u2019s where I still didn\u2019t go to\nschool there. Because we were still in the woods. And my peers still had to work.",
