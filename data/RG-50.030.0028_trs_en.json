        "Q: Would you tell me your full name please?",
        "A: My name is Tomasz Blatt, B-L-A-T-T. And I'm born in 1927 in Poland.",
        "Q: What's the town in Poland?",
        "A: In a little town, Izbica. This is in the Lublin district.",
        "Q: Tell me about it. Tell me about your parents and what they did, and your childhood.",
        "A: This town was a very interesting town, because...uh...it's a hundred percent Jewish town.\nIn...uh...in 1870...uh...a Polish aristocrat...uh...did recetve a permit to build a Jewish town.\nAnd...uh...in a place close to the river Wieprz, he established this...uh...Jewish...uh...town. In\nthe beginning, there were about four houses according the... the what I discovered in the\ntown....",
        "Q: Tom, what we need to do...excuse me...we need less of the history. We need your story.",
        "A: Okay....It's a typical Jewish town, a shtetl, hundred percent Jewish. The Christian population\nlived around the town, on the foothills. About 3,000 Jews used to live there. Uh...And\nthe...this town was built in a valley surrounded by hills, or mountains, and this the Germans\nlater used for the purpose which we will come to it. We had..uh...one shul and about three,\nfour Beis Medresh [NB: Beth Midrash]. Very deeply orthodox. As a matter of fact, I\nremember there was next to it a town, Zamo __, and one Saturday, some Jewish or free...they\ncalled them \"free thinkers\" did come with bicycles. On top of it they were without caps,\nwithout a hat. And I remember the...half of the town they chased them out with sticks and\nwith stones because they come on a Saturday and...um... Saturday, Friday in the evening and\nthe next day Saturday, the town was quiet because it was a holy day, like nobody in the town\nexcept in the evening. I remember Yom Kippur. You could feel it in the air. You could see\nthe people moving by to...to the Beis Medresh...or to the temple, to the shul. It was deeply\northodox. There were a few which did try...uh...to reach out. For instance, my father.\nIn our town everyone had a name; on top of it, he had a special name given. For example, if\nhe does...he didn't have a leg, they called him [Leme Yoine (ph)]. [Yoine (ph)]| was his name,\nbecause uh...my father, why I'm telling him was because my father was already what you\ncall \"free thinker.\" He did try to move out from the orthodox ways, so they called him\n[Leibele Goy (ph)]. It was..., my [NB: his] first name was [Leibele (ph)], he was Goy\nbecause he did...uh...smoke cigarettes sometimes Saturday. They did know it. You can't\nsneak...you can't smoke cigarettes in Izbica but when the...the shutters in the the home\nweren't closed, all the peoples in the neighbor did know that my dad was smoking cigarettes\nSaturday because of it. I remember mine...if you talk about my childhood. I will tell you a\nstory which will give you an idea. Uh...For example, my father had a Polish friend, a\nChristian. He send him out to buy pork meat usual; because...uh...nobody could see my dad\nbe going into...uh...to buy pork meat, of course. So he sent this Christian friend. And I...once\nI remember and my father told me, \"Try it.\" And I tried it and I liked it. But in that time they\nused to live in so-called, in a [Urisha (ph)|. You know what [Urisha (ph)] is? [Urisha (ph)] is\na house because it was built maybe 50, 80 years ago by my grand, grand, grandparents and\nlater when the children did get grandchildren, they get married and so on, they divided this\nhouse. So...uh...finally when I...was already over there, when I was about 10 years old, this\nwhole house was divided with partitions that everybody could hear everybody across the\nwall. So mine...mine aunt did hear me...did hear the conversation with my dad and she\nnoticed by listening in that time, I'm eating pork meat. So what...the next thing I remember\nshe opened the door where my father lived and said, \"Tom.\" \"Toivi,\" not \"Tom.\" Not Tom.\n\"Toivi, you eat pork meat?\" I said, \"Yes, Mimi, I ate.\" \"You know what [Streicher\u2019 (ph)]\nis?\" \"Yes, I know what [Streicher (ph)] is.\" \"You will go to Hell.\" I know about Hell\nbecause my uncle told me stories, how they burn people and everything else. \"Promise me,\nyou wouldn't eat any more.\" So I say I wouldn't. And she left. And I was such...so scared\nabout Hell and everything else that immediately...1t was a shock to me I remember...what I\nremember is I...I was in a high fever and laid down the sofa and my whole head was just like\na...like a mill. And I was sick for about two days. They called the doctor and that time, you\nknow, the doctor...doctors used to come to the home, and he said, \"Give him aspirin. I don't\nsee anything.\" And finally when my Mimi did come to visit me, and I remember the first\nthing what I ask her was, \"Mimi, will I go to Hell?\" And she probably understood what the\nproblem is; that I simply, that I'm that scared. I'm sick from being scared. And she said, \"Oh,\nToivi, you know, don't worry because when your Bar Mitzvah will come, God will forgive\nyou everything.\" Now, this...this had a fourfold effect because I wasn't afraid anymore. I\nwas Okay, but I again I did...when mine...the next time my dad did ask me if you want a\npiece of pork meat, I said \"Yes,\" because anyway, in about two, three years God will forgive\nme. So anyway, I just tell you a little picture it was. Some people they tried to get out from\nthe circle of...uh... orthodox behavior, but it was very...it was trying. But...I otherwise,\nactually it was a deeply Jewish town.... uh ...with a very big respect for the Rabbi. The Rabbi\nwas our authority. And...uh...Friday, with the shochet and everything else. And so it was 'til\n1939, when the war started.",
        "Q: Tell us about that.",
        "A: Uh...I remember the town...you know, we didn't have...uh... radios in that time, so any news\n'He may be using the Yiddish word \"treife\" here.\nwas...uh...transmitted by person who had a big...uh...drum...uh...Jewish guy. His name was\n[Hydel (ph)], and he did go to the middle of the town to the marketplace and drummed up\nuntil all the people had come together, and now he said, \"Hello, hello. This is the news...\"\nand so on. He did say that a war started. Hitler invaded Poland, and a mobilization is in order\nand...uh...he was the latest news from the Burgermeister's office, Mayor's office, I would say.\nAnd he advised to glue in strips of paper on the windows so they shouldn't shatter if the\nbombs fall down, and that was the news. So people start to pick up newspapers, cut it in\nstrips, and glue in and some people did prepare dry bread; and so it was in our place too. And\nlater I remember planes coming. I remember Polish plane shot down, and the next I\nremember my family was moving out from the town, hiding in a village from the bombs. We\nwere afraid that Izbica will be bombed because there was a big factory, a military factory in\nIzbica uh producing material for fortification purposes. So I went to this village, Panska-\nDolina.\nOver there, I remember Polish soldiers and I remember when the news arrived that the\nSoviet Union is fighting against Poland, too. I remember the speech from the Polish officer,\nthat they have, they are stabbed in the back by the Soviet soldiers and now they will fight to\nthe last drop of blood. And ...uh...later I remember the rumor, the Germans are coming, and\nnow we are a group of people about 25. We don't know what to do, scared in the forest. The\nyoung people say, \"Oh, we will run away from the Germans. We are going across the river\nBug to the Russians.\" The older people, mine parents included...my father, \"No, we're going\nback to Izbica. Germans. Of course, they're anti-Semites, but they're also people.\" And I\nremember we split then. It was in the night. I remember the stars and could be about maybe\n12 o'clock in the middle of the night, like a...like a film, like a movie, we departed. And the\nsons did walk to the east, and some parents did go back to Izbica. And I went back with my\nparents. We come to Izbica and now...uh.. (chuckle) interesting news. The Germans are\nleaving. So I said, \"The Germans are leaving. I didn't see a German soldier. I must see a\nGerman soldier.\" So I went down looking for a German soldier. \"Oh, there're two German\nsoldiers still in the bakery buying bread.\" So I went to the bakery and I seen in front of them\ntwo German soldiers with bikes and talking and they...they sound like Yiddish because\nGerman is pretty close to Yiddish. So I was wondering...take a look, they're speaking my\nlanguage. (laughing) And...uh...I did say hello to them. We did talk a little bit. I Yiddish and\nthey're German. There's nothing wrong with it. And they left. Uh...A day later the Russians\narrived. What it was in the beginning, that the Germans simply did go too far and later\ndid...did come to agreement about the...the demarcation line, and they moved out. And the\nRussians arrived. In that time the local communists organized their own militia and they\nwere in power for about two weeks and later again, it's a mistake. The Russians are leaving\nagain. The Germans are coming. So again what should we do? My mother told my father,\n\"Listen, Let go out. I know Russian. I know the language. Let go out from here.\" And my\nfather said, \"No.\" Actually he bought a horse and carriage already. And later he said, \"No, I\nwas born here. I could die here.\"\nAnd my father for some reason, which saved me later in my life I could say, he was in a way\na Polish patriot. He was a volunteer in the Polish legionnaires, so called Pi_sudski's\narmy...uh...uh...in the First World War. He was wounded. He was a invalid. And...uh...which\nwas, you know, a very horrible in that time. So he...and he said, no, he will stay here. He was\nborn here and he...he could die here. And he stayed. And this was...and this sealed our future,\nour destiny. So I've seen the Russians going, and a lot of Jews did, runned after them close\nby the...the regular army soldiers, everybody going east. And I was a child 12 years old, but I\nfelt that something historical happened, that something...I felt something is wrong. We\nshould go. But we didn't. The Russians left and Izbica was a no-man's land. No Russians. No\nGermans. The Germans did come. But they stopped about 12...12 kilometers before Izbica in\na district town of Krasnystaw. Izbica was nobody. So two...the third night, sitting in my\nroom I hear a big explosion. And suddenly \u2014 screaming, yelling, \"What's happened?\" A\ngroup of Jews stood on the street outside talking, and some Poles throw a grenade at them.\nAnd they killed a few and they wounded a few. So we start to be terrorized by the Poles. So\npeople were scared to go outside the town and there's another legation did form, a Jewish\ndelegation, under the leadership of Miss Roetenstein. Still I remember her name. By the way,\nthis 1s the same, this 1s my Mimi (chuckle) which she told me I shouldn't eat...I1 shouldn't eat\nunkosher. Under...under her leadership, they went to Krasnystaw. Actually, to invite\nGermans to come to Izbica because it...1t is no law in Izbica and we are afraid and that they\nmust come in. So Germans did come into Izbica to protect the Jews.\nNo, you must understand that there were no Gestapo in the first days. There were simple\nWehrmacht soldiers. And there was also called an Ortskommandantur Wehrmacht, a local\ncommand...command of the soldiers arrived and they patrolled the streets so they were pretty\nquiet. As matter of fact, the Jews used to do business... uh...with the soldiers. I remember\na...kids did go out and buy from them cigarettes and sold...uh...different stuff. It...1t was\nrather peaceful with them, until Gestapo arrived. There were two of them. Ludwig Klein and\nKarl Engels. Both survived the war, and I was a witness against both of them at Hamburg.\nThey both committed suicide in...1n Hamburg after the war, being 1n jail. Well, anyway,\nthese two SS were a terror in Izbica. Every day, before breakfast, they went out, killed five,\nten Jews; and later they ordered breakfast. It was unbelieve...unbelievable and we realized,\nfinally, that we have no rights. And many times we wished that if the first Germans which\narrived, if they would kill a 100 Jews, if they would terrorize the town, it would be a blessing\nbecause everybody would escape with the Russians. You understand? In the beginning!\nBut, unfortunately, for us the first Germans were good Germans, so- called. So...now it was\ntoo late, and we were in a trap. In that time, again, compared to the future, it wasn't so bad.\nThere were still families. Some people were killed because of Engels, but otherwise it was\npossible to live. There were...uh...there were labor camps and Jews were forced to go to\nwork in labor camps. In the beginning, they were forced to work on the streets from 8 o'clock\nin the morning til 7 o'clock in the evening, and they were released home. Later, as I said,\nthere were labor camps where they went out for a month or for a week. They worked. Later\nthey...they were exchanged. New Jews did come and they were let home.\nUh... Now on that point, I must tell you that the Germans 1n that time established Jewish\nCouncils, so-called \"Judenrat.\" And through the Judenrat, they were able to execute their\norders, so the Judenrat sent people to work in the labor camps and the Judenrat also after a\nmonth or so sent new people. The old ones...the first ones should be released. So it wasn't a\norder. Now, everybody, according...according the rules, everybody was supposed to go for\none month to the labor. But again, if there was a rich fellow in the list he was able to pay the\npoor...to pay the poor fellow, and he did voluntary go. But as the time progressed, it was\nworse and worse. We heard about beating. We heard about torture, and people refused to go.\nIn that time the first so-called \"Aktions\" happened. \"Aktion\" is a roundup. It started with\nroundups to the labor camps. They would come in the morning and told the Jewish Council\nto deliver 500 men or 200 men. If the Jewish Council wasn't able to deliver through their\nown police, they started indiscrimate to go from house to house, beat, shot... Ukrainians,\nwhich worked with the Nazis together. And they...they caught...they simple caught people on\nthe streets 'til they get the amount of 500 people and they took them away.",
        "Q: What were you and your parents doing?",
        "A: I was a goy in ______ the picture and later got to the ____.. So in that time, I was already in\ndanger. I was, of course, 12, 13 years old, 13. So my father looked for protection. What\nabout my family in that time? My mother, of course, was a housewife. My father lost his\nbusiness, He had from before, as a legionnaire, he had a liquor store business, so-called\n\"monopol koncesja\" in Poland, uh...as a veteran from the legionnaires. Lost my [NB: his]\nbusiness, but still he was able to make a living. He was very well known. He has done some\nbusiness with the Polish farmer, even if 1t was illegal; but he did look to protect me. So he\nmade a deal with a Pole of German origin, Mr. [Platow (ph)]. Mr. [Platow (ph)] had a\nblacksmith shop. He made with him a deal that I will work for him. So I should be employed\nin case the Germans are looking unemployed, because 1n the beginning they took so-called\nunemployed Jews. I went to work about 8 o'clock in the morning til 5:00. It was hard work\nbecause in that time we had a lathe, I remember; and the lathe, it's not like now--you put in\nan electric motor, and the lathe is running. I did need to move everything by myself, and\nmany times I thought I...I will collapse but then my boss said, \"You turn. Just turn.\" And I\nthought I...I must turn because this is my protection. I must turn the wheel even if I wasn't\nable to breath anymore. But I managed. (Pause) When the Gestapo arrived, they went...they\nhad two motorcycles and a car and they...and they need a repair shop. So they went to\nanother mechanic, blacksmith. His name was [Solecky (ph)]. And the motorcycles were over\nthere, always, for the night to be cleaned or the car was over there...the Gestapo car. And\nonce in the evening I was going by, the boss, Mr. [Solecky (ph)] from this...uh...repair shop\ntold me, \"Tom, would you like to help me? I have a lot of work; stay overnight and put\ntogether a motorcycle.\" So I said, \"Okay, I will just tell my dad.\" Told my dad that I will be\na whole night working in Mr. [Solecky's (ph)... will call it from now on \"garage,\" because\nAmericans are familiar with what a...what a garage is. And while I was working next day, he\nsaid...[Solecky (ph)]...\"Listen, why don't you work with me. Leave Mr. [Platow (ph)|. Come\nto me.\"\nAnd I thought it was a good idea. First of all, I will be protected by Gestapo, clean the\nmotorcycles, and I agreed. And from that time on, I started to work...uh...for Mr. [Solecky\n(ph)] and it was dangerous because the motorcycles of the Gestapo need to be cleaned, you\nknow, spotless. And I worked very hard and I done a good job. And as I see it now, it was a\ngood choice because later when the death camps did come, I was protected practically...\npractically the last minute, and I was able to see how town is sinking down, myself being\nprotected. I didn't need to hide like another people that hide in that time. I've seen it. Okay.\nGoing back to the labor camps. Suddenly, transports arrived from...uh...Pozna_...from\nwest...from the western part of Poland...Pozna_, Ko _o, Konin, and lot of Jews arrived; we\ndivided...the Judenrat divided the people to different houses and that time I did get very close\nwith...uh...[Jussik Bresler (ph)|, who was...uh...a dentist's son from Ko _o. In our place used\nto live a man, his name was Kohn, with his wife. Once I remember...it was the evening...I\nstill remember my mother standing close...close to the window with Mr. Kohn and his wife,\nand discussing a letter. And I listen: \"gassing people, gassing....\"\" And my mother I\nremember saying, \"It's impossible. It's a fantasy. Can't be.\" So a lot of time parents don't\neven realize how much children could listen in, pretending doing something else. And I did.\nWhat I understood, and later I find out more is Miss [Mrs.] Kohn, received a letter from her\nson in Ko_o, which was still in Ko_o, that in a place called Chelmno, they're gassing people.\nHe wrote about this. But, as I said, it was dismissed.\nBy the way, her son who wrote the letter survived and he lives in [Holland (ph)], in Israel.\nAnd I later talked to him when I went to Israel. And I was in the South, reminding him about\nthis letter he wrote. Anyway, so this was a bad signal, but later quiet down. At least I didn't\nhear...at least I didn't hear anything. But once was some \"Akcja.\" The SS arrived in the\nmorning, did...uh...asked the Judenrat to deliver 2,000 people to the marketplace. And the\nJudenrat did go home to home and delivered, but a lot of people already were afraid about\nthe torture, about the beating, and hide. So the Nazis themselves start to look for them and\ncollected them in the marketplace. After such a \"Aktion,\" after the...uh...the desired amount\nof Jews were concentrated in the marketplace, everybody else could go out and uh...town\nwas like normal. The people were over there, then later they were taken to the station, there\nwere already wagons for them loaded and taken away. Like they took them away before to\nlabor camps close to Zamo _...was a labor...labor camp, [Mokre Zdanow (ph). They left.\nBut usual, in a case like this, they took away some family...family members, and the family\nwhich was left usual...usually sent some Poles, Christian Pole, a friend, to go after the train\nto see the destination. And so after this transport left, some people...Polish people went after\nthem with a bike or with...uh...either way, with another train tracing this train. The same\nnight...uh...I...a day later, I remember I was at home and I heard some knocking in the\nwindow. It was already after the curfew...curfew time. But nevertheless, many times I did\nsneak out after curfew time. But I hear some knocking, and as I go to the window\nand...uh...there was a knock like I had...uh when I went to my friend [Jussik (ph)], I knock\nthe same way...three times long and three times short it was. I recognize as my friend [Jussik\n(ph)] from...from Ko_o. So I opened the door, go out, sneak out, you know, because Jews are\nnot allowed outside, and hidden behind this house I say...I noticed [Jussik (ph)] standing by.\nI said, \"[Jussik (ph)|, What's the urgency? What is so...\" \"Tom, I must tell you something.\nTom, you remember [Ruza (ph)]?\" I said, \"Yes.\" \"She was taken before yesterday.\" \"Yes.\"\n\"She's dead.\" I mean, \"What do you mean, she's dead?\" \"I mean...you remember the\ntransport which left with the trains...the last transport of 2,000 Jew? All of them are dead.\"\n\"What do you mean, all of them are dead?\" \"Tom, you don't know?\" I said, \"No.\" He said,\n\"There's a place call Belzec, and I have a friend who just come back and he told me that all\nthe Jews, not only from Izbica, every day, thousands of them are coming in to this camp\nBelzec, and this camp should be overflowing but nobody comes out. Only people are going\nin. And night time is a big fire, and they're killing people there. I don't know how. They say\nby elect...electrocuting them.\" Because in the beginning, they didn't know the method. \"But\nthey're killed.\" I said, \"[Jussik (ph)|, you are dreaming.\" \"That's what I want to tell you.\"\nHe left. I didn't tell this my parents because I didn't want to scare them. But the next time the\nwhole town did know, that there's a death camp, Belzec, 35 miles from Izbica, and they're\nkilling people over there.\nSo everybody start to build hiding places. Before the...we had hiding places before too, but\nthey were primitive, only to...to hide themself in case they..they want to take them to labor\ncamp. But now the stake was life, and they...they start to build very elaborate hiding places.\nIn that time the Mayor of the city...in that time was a German Mayor of the city, a Polish\nGerman, \"Volks...\"--so-called \"Volksdeutsch.\" He decided to move to better location.\nBefore the war, he did live in some kind dingy, a little rundown house, but now he want a\nbetter house, so he moved exactly in the same house where we....we did live. It was\nlike...you would call it in...n America, apartment house like on the ___. In Poland, it was\nreally a little house where few families lived together. So he did become our...our neighbor.\nIn this particular house, which was a long building...we...we had about eight families, but by\nhim moving in, we did join the same attic. The attic over this house, part was on his...on top\nof his apartment and part of our apartment, so what we have done...we ask a mason to take a\npart of this attic, build a double wall. We made a hiding place over there. The entrance was\nfrom...was from our room upstairs. They build a little opening, a little door, maybe three feet\nby two. We squeezed in, went into the attic, and we were actually on...on Mr. Schultz, which\nwas the mayor, on his..on his property; so when we put against the wall our little cabinet, it\ndid cover the entrance and we were safe, and this was our hiding place. The drawback was\nthat we did need a guy from outside to...but this I have done because when was...I was\nalready protected. I told you which way. So I have done run back to the...uh...the garage.\nAnyway, now the second Akcja did come, and the third. Izbica was empty. Soon transport\nfrom Nuremberg, from Czechoslovakia, from Slovakia.... Why I say Czechoslovakia\nseparate and Slovakia separate? Because the Czech Jews, they're completely\ndifferent...uh...than the Slovakian Jews. The Slovakian Jews looked more like the Polish\nJews. Same type of people; and... uh...(pause) from Berlin...some people. In...from,\npractically, from a low population, Izbica did grow to about 15, 20 thousand; so it was even\npeople...even the street was ...were too many people to move around. So again a Akcja and\nagain did go down to 10,000...",
        "Q: What is your point? What.... Describe you...",
        "A: I will go to it. I will go; I can't describe every akcja...I will describe one big one...one where\nthey took me to Sobibor. I will tell you about one Akcja. If I will describe, if I will try to\ndescribe everything, it will be miserable, terrible, and would take me a long, long time and\nprobably you would be exhausted and I would be exhausted. I will tell you about the typical\nAkcja. It always started about, about 4 o'clock in the morning with a shot in the air. They had\nsome shotting [shooting] and the whole town was surrounded. As I said, Izbica was in a\nvalley. It was like a...a trap. You didn't need too many soldiers on top of the mountains so\nanybody should be visible...the whole town should be visible. Nobody was able to go out.\nAnd another group of Ukrainians...Ukrainians that cooperated with the Germans, went in the\ntown and they dragged people out. First, as normally before, the Judenrat call out to the Jews\nto go out to the streets and called, \"Jews, Come out. You're going to labor.\" Uh...sometimes,\neven they lured them...\"Everybody will get a half a bread...a half a bread on the...on the\nway.\" And so on. \"Come out. Nothing will happen.\" That's what the German told him to\nsay. And when then this didn't help because we did know the truth, the Germans and the\nUkrainians dragged down the houses. When I heard the first shot...not...not only me...all\nover...all in the house heard the shouting, we immediately concentrated in our apartment. In\nthat time we had a connection to the whole house. If there was no door to the next apartment,\nwe made a door or opening so everybody was able to pass, to come to our ...and we went to\nthe first floor into the attic and I put this against the wall and did run back to the garage. Oh,\nmy boss, he was, of course, a Volksdeutsche; he was so happy because now he could make\nsome money. He put on the red arm band with the \"Hakenkreuz,\" with the swastika, took his\nrifle and went out with Germans to look for Jews. The Aktion was a whole day. When they\nhad a group of about... about thousand people in the marketplace, they used to... uh...take\nthem to the train station, which was about a mile away through the whole city, the main road.\nThe main road was lined up on both ways by Poles, looking.\nAt least, I talk about mine town. And I was standing between them. I was...I wasn't afraid\nbecause the Mayor of the city had a car. I was cleaning for him. The Gestapo wouldn't take\nme because I was cleaning their motorcycles, and the policeman did know him because they\ndid come to salute him. Everybody did know I worked for [Solecky(ph)| ...for this\nVolksdeutsche. And even if they were...by chance somebody would take...take me, they\nwould take me out from the circle. I was... was sure about this. So I was just standing with\nthe Poles looking. And once I've seen...I've seen many times cases like that, but this\nparticular day was a kid, maybe...maybe seven years old which did run out, because not too\nmany Ukrainians did guard this column of people. But maybe every...every hundred feet\nmaybe a Ukrainian. It was easy to run out. But the problem was a different problem. This\nboy run out. Three minutes later, he was taken back by Poles, and pushed him back in the\ncolumn. The point 1s this, that in mine dreams I don't dream about the German peo..., about\nthe Germans. I'm not afraid of about the Germans. The Germans didn't know who I was. I\nwas afraid about my neighbors, the Poles. They were living...you see, the Germans...they\ndidn't know Jews. Their vision of Jews was from the...Rosenberg's\u2019...Rosenberg? From\nhis...from the propaganda. A Jew must have a long nose, and so on and so. But the Poles are\nmy neighbors. They did live with Jews for hundreds of years, and I was afraid of them.\nAnyway, I was sitting back and observing. Nothing I could do. Transport finally...all the\npeople were moved to the train station and they were...they weren't still enough people. Two\ntrains already left for Belzec so the Aktion was, they take another night. And that time I told\n[Solecky (ph)] that I want to hide my brother. I want to take him away to a safer place. Mine\nbrother was together with father in this attic, but I... was afraid about...uh...this place. So I\ntook my brother out. I went over there. Took my brother out, and I took him with me to the\ngarage. A whole night was going on screaming. I remember I...this...this [Solecky (ph)], my\nboss, locked me in the garage, and in the garage was a Fiat, uh, the...the mayor's car, and I\nslept in this car. And that's a terrible sight. Outside was the screaming, shouting, \"Shma\nIsrael\" and so on. I turned on the radio, and the radio...I still remember...the song. The\nradio....there was a station from Vienna and I remember the \"Lily Marlene\" song. And this\nwas singing, and the screaming...it was a...a terrible...I just turned on the radio to...to...should\ntake over, but was impossible and I'm sleeping with my brother. My brother in the back seat,\nand I in the front and my boss had a...a sense of humor, and every so often he did come and\nknock on the door. He did know I'm over there because he allowed me in the garage but he\nknocked, \"Jews, Raus! Jews, Raus!\" Just to scare me. Just for the fun, you know. And later,\nof course, he said, \"Don't be afraid. Stay over there.\" And he left.\nEarly in the morning, he opened the garage and I told mine brother to go in the...to hide\nbetween the junks and that in the corner. It was a little partition. And Ukrainians did come in,\ncleaning their rifles and cleaning their pistols, and here one of the Volksdeutsches, of the\nGerman collaborators, did come in...a guy who I know very well, and I cleaned his\nmotorcycles always. And so I told him, Mr. Krauser, I did...did want to know my family's\n* Alfred Rosenberg was a leading ideologue of Nazi racist theories and served as the Reich\nMinister for the Occupied Territories in the East.\nstill intact...I told Mr. Krauser, \"Would you like to go with me to my home to see if\neverything is okay? They did...they didn't rob us or whatever?\" So he said, \"Okay. Come.\"\nAnd so I went with him and come into our home and, of course, the door is smashed open\nand in there was Ukrainians trying on socks, changed their socks... remember still. He did\nfind a pair of socks he was changing. In another room was another Ukrainian looking in\nthere and the...Krauser, said to them \"Raus!\" He had a nice Hakenkreuz, you know, on\nhis..uh...shirt, the swastika, and he told them to get out. He was our authority, so they left. So\nwhile Krauser was down...uh..I did try to sneak in upstairs to see the hiding place is still\nintact. He noticed it. So he said...so he said, \"Tom, do you want to go upstairs?\" So I said,\n\"Aw, forget it. No. Let go back.\" I didn't want to take the chance. But he felt something and\nhe said, \"No, let go upstairs.\" I said, ''No, Mr. Krauser, no let not.\" \"Let go.\" He went up\nand I went after him. He looks around and he said, \"So, Tom.\" I said, \"Okay, everything 1s\nokay, let's go back.\" But he felt something. He wasn't so stupid. He looked around, knocked\non the floor, knocked on the wall. And later he goes to this little cabinet and wanted to move\nit. And I grabbed him by the hand, \"Mr. Krauser, please leave it.\" \"No, Tom. What 1s it?\nDon't be afraid.\" \"This is a hiding place. My parents're over there. Don't go in because you\nwill scare them.\" He said, \"Don't be afraid.\" He moved away. And he found about\nhundred...over a hundred Jews over there. He goes in, comes out, moved back this cabinet\nand told me, \"Tom....\". They called me, that time they didn't call me Tom. \"Toivi, don't be\nafraid.\" And he didn't betray it.\nLater, when the Aktion was over, the...and I did come to remove this cabinet and told them\neverything is over, and everybody went out, they made a collection of money to give him.\nBut it was after...after that. So this was the Aktion. Later were another Aktions, basically\nsimilar. I remember my aunt from Krasnystaw ____ was running wild on the street,\nbreaking ...breaking his finger. She had one little boy, also called Toivi. And they took him\naway. He was hiding...he was...I don't how come, but they took him, they left her. And she\nwas running wild on the street, breaking her fingers. \"My Toivi, they took him away...\" This\nI remember. And this was a typical Aktion. When Aktion, when they left there were\nwindows broken in the Jewish houses, people did look for gold, and there was a lot of down\non the street from the cut...they cut bedding to look for money and everything else...was like\na ruin everything. And I just...I just went house to house to notice that my friends [Srulek\n(ph)] is taken, this guy is taken, mine...mine friend, a girl was taken, and nothing you could\ndo. After each Aktion, we were promised this 1s the last ttme. Only unproductive Jews were\ntaken. You see... hope. Hope could kill, and hope could save. If I wouldn't have hope, I\nwould kill myself. So I...but a lot of people, because they hoped, they didn't fight and they\ndid go to death practically without...without resistance. Anyway, (sigh) that's another Aktion,\nanother one. Later, we hear about Sobibor. Another death camp, built this time north, on the\nnorth side of Izbica. And again a Aktion. I mustn't talk yet.\nThere is something which I could dwell on. In Izbica there were lot of Czechoslovak...Czech\nJews, from Czechoslovakia. They considered themselves, probably with German inspiration,\nthat they are better than the Polish Jews. So they made their own Judenrat....\nCzechoslovakian Judenrat. And the next Aktion, the Czechoslovakian Jews did chase the\nPolish Jews. And there was special Czechoslovakian militia...Jewish...Jewish militia, which\nchased....that time being a Czech Jew or a German Jew was a permit to live. That was a\nAkcja. When this was over, the Polish Jews would get together...not the Jews, the Judenrat\nPolish. How do I know it? I know it because my uncle was in Judenrat. He did come to my\nhome and talk with my father and I always had a...and it was public knowledge too. The\nnext...and so what's happened the Polish Jews did get...get together money and the Judenrat\ndid bribe the Landrat, because Mr. Landrat is district officials--the German, you know. And\nwhen it was next roundup, before closing the wagons, the Landrat, the district official, told\nall the Czech Judenrat and the Czech militia to go on the wagons, and [they] take them away.\nAnd this was the revenge from the Polish. I just tell you...uh...uh...uh...you could take it out.\nBut I just tell you the...the interaction, what it was. (sigh) So they played one against the\nother. (Pause) In 1942, so I was working in this garage for a long time, watching, seeing\neverything. Unfortunately, what...not being able to do anything. Once I think I helped, in a\nway, because there was a Aktion and like usual, in a Aktion...after the Aktion the Ukrainians,\nthe SS, did come to Solecky's garage to clean the...the guns. So I overheard...uh...one\nUkrainian, he said to Solecky, \"Listen, prepare for me something...some kind of, I think it\nwas a tire,\" because Wednesday, we coming back. So I was sure that Wednesday would be\nagain so I put out the word that Wednesday will be again...again a Aktion; which was true. It\nwas a Aktion next Wednesday.\nUh...up til now, my family was still intact. This hiding place was perfect. He didn't betray,\nKrauser. (Pause) Uh...me, as a boy, in the evening...uh..I used to go out after curfew to my\nfriends and we had girlfriends from Czechoslovakia and we did get together in a hallway and\nwe talk and...I, like any boys my age, 15 years, I did want to have my girlfriend. I was very\nshy, extremely shy, so finally, I...I met mine counterpart, a shy Czechoslovakian girl. And\nwe were just standing...nothing, just standing pretending to be grownup and later, I\nremember after Aktion I went to her and...uh...I went to the hallway, a dark hallway which\nalways, there...when I did come to her place and she did come out from her room and is\ntalking to me in the hallway, her mother...and every few minutes opened the door, looking\nwhat we are doing. And I come to the hallway's empty, the window's broken, and she's gone.\nThey took her away, so I thought about her mother being so protective of her, and now is\ngone. And...uh...so slowly all my friends....kids are gone. And now comes the time when we\nknow that we can't escape destiny and my father calls me and he said, \"Tom, Toivi, you must\nleave.\" Says I, \"What do you mean, 'leave'\"?\" \"Toivi, you see what's happened. The next\nAkcja will be Judenrein. That means no Jews could be. And this hiding place will not help\nanymore. So you have prepared Christian papers, so-called Aryan papers, and you will\nescape to Hungary. Your brother will be hidden here. I arranged everything by a Pole. Your\nmother has also false papers and she will go to Warsaw. And I will hide someplace here. But\nyou will go...you will...you must leave tonight.\" I don't want to go into any particulars\nabout...the...false papers, but about 2 o'clock in the night time, I recetved my papers. I\nwas...my name was Waldemar Ptaszek, and my mother's name was |Leukadia Stankewicz\n(ph)] and so on.\nIt wasn't much time to learn the new names because a half hour later, we suppose to go to the\ntrain station. Now, my mother was still...soon...soon came to my parents...I remember,\na...some gold coins. And I had about 100 mark in my pockets and a few Polish zlotys. And\nwe eat sardines...I remember me and my mother and little brother and was another boy,\n[Velvole (ph)], from another family. He's supposed to go with me. We eat, and later I kissed\nuh my mother, my father, my brother; said goodbye, and...uh...I should go...in that time, it\nwas agreed that I go to my neighbor, Schneider, wherever everybody who want to escape 1s\nconcentrating. What it was was a group of about 12 people, Jews, with false papers and a\nPolish Christian guide supposed to lead them until the Hungarian border. Close to the\nHungarian border, another fellow, Christian fellow, should take him over and try to sneak\nhim into Hungary. Now...now we say, all going to Hungary...you know, ___. To\nunderstand the desperation of the time, you must understand this. To go out from the\nghetto...first of all, to go out in curfew time, death sentence. To go out from the ghetto, death\nsentence. To be in a train, a death sentence. And you come to...to the (chuckle) to the border\nyou can't go through. You must sneak through. On top of it, there were rumors that the\nPolish guides, they take you to the border and later they rob you. They make you first write a\nletter that you crossed nicely, to lure everyone, and later they rob you and they kill you. Now\nyou understand this desperation that still my parents agreed to let me go. So I went out from\nthis...from my parent's house to go to the Schneiders'. Half way...I still can't understand why,\nbut half way to Schneider's house, I turn around and go back.\n[...I don't know...I think I was so much attached to my little brother...I think I did want to see\nmy brother again. Went back and my father was angry. I think he was superstitious, and he\nsaid, \"You shouldn't come back. It's not a good sign.\" It's some kind of superstitious. If\nyou...if you go back, it's not good. Anyway. So I felt bad that my father was angry. I turned\naround and went back to Schneider's house, and there about four girls and was some men\ncalled Rappoport from Zamo___ dressed as Polish peasant. Time comes close, and we are\nsneaking out slowly to the train station, watching that no German patrol should see us. By\nthe way, the Germans they...they walk so loud that we could hear them a half a mile away,\nbut still it was dangerous; so we sneaked into the train station but we are not...we can't go\ninto the train station because there are lamp post and it's a little town. They would\nimmediately recognize us. So we're waiting in a ditch till the train comes. The train arrives\nand before moving out, we did jump in in the last wagon. And this way we were on...on our\nway to the Hungarian border. By the way, tickets were bought by our guide beforehand; he\ndid give us the ticket for riding the train. On the way, I encountered...already in the\nbeginning, but the first 20 miles past Izbica a problem which I don't feel is so important to\ndwell on it, so I will skip it. But finally, after about an hour's drive...uh...on the road, I see\npeople closing the windows, starting to lit cigarettes. I hear some talking to themselves\nquietly. I see something change in the atmosphere. And suddenly, there's a train station and\nthe train slowed down and the left side...as if would have been a big fire, and I could feel the\nsmell. It was all over. And I understand, they're talking...they was talking...there's been Jews,\n\"Spalenie ydow\" [Translation: \"Burning Jews\" |] and so on, in Polish. And I look and\nthere's Belzec...passing by Belzec . Not knowing that a year later, we'll be in a place like this.\nAnd I...I was starting to shake. We passed Belzec. The train did not stop.\nIn the middle of the way, close to Lwow [L'vov], something happened. All eight Jews,\nthey're sitting in the same train...1n the same wagon, and there was one fellow, Rabinowicz,\nwho was always moving between us. Next to us were sitting, next to me, [Velvole (ph)],\nPolish farmers were sitting. And I heard one woman talking to another one that this one\nwhich is roaming, which is going around must be Jewish. And I was already scared, but so\nhappens, this Rabinowicz comes to me and tells me, \"Tom, [Guyosh (ph)],\" which is our\nguide, \"he wants more money. Otherwise, he's leaving us.\" So I told him, \"Listen,\nRabinowicz, you must run. Now we have really problems because next door is the woman\nwho is suspecting you are Jewish. Now you did come to me, and there's problems.\" So he\nimmediately told that...told another one, and in the next station, it was night time, we all left\nthe train and we managed to go, mingled with lot of people go to the front, and we went on\nthe same train except on another wagon. And we managed to come to close to Lwow. Now it\nwas agreed before we left Izbica not to travel through the main station in Lwow, because\nthere are rumors that the Gestapo is searching terrible this place. And they're checking\neverybody. The best place to go out a station before Lwow, go through Lwow by foot, and\nlater the next station, pass Lwow, and go on again to the train. And the guide will be waiting\nalready this station past Lwow. So we go out and the...place called Kleparo\u00e9w [NB: Polish\nspelling |. And I remember they were building some roads, so we need to go single file; and\nover there had a problem with a Ukrainian guard who stopped me but he asked me if I am\nJewish and I said no. Why did he...he didn't actual stop me. We were single file in a...1n front\nof us a Ukrainian militia man was riding a bicycle. And while he was passing our line and he\nstopped. And he was yelling, \"Eh, you, come raus!\" I wasn't sure if he yelled at me or he\nyelled somebody else. But...but nobody did go out from this...from the people moving, so I\nturned around and went to him. So he asked me...looked at me and asked me, \"Are you\nJewish?\" I said, \"No.\" \"Show me your papers.\" I showed him the papers: Waldemar\nPtaszek. In the train, I had already time to repeat \"Waldemar Ptaszek, born here and here,\nand my father's so and so.\" \"So what do you have in your rucksack?\" So I said, \"I have\nsomething...I have uh... food which I bought to...to take to my parents. I am just smuggling.\nIf you want to give me a fine, I can't help it but I don't have money.\" He looked at me and\nsaid, \"Okay. Go.\" Later...uh...I realized our mistake. I realized why...the... the...the Christian\nPoles recognized us as Jews on the train. You know why? We went into a train for\nsmugglers. And everybody was dressed like smugglers. And now the few Jews are coming\ndressed in their best because we are going for a trip. In the best...I had my shoes polished.\nWe were...we just stand up like a sore...like a sore thumb how they say it in..1n English so\nthis was our... and probably this the reason he called me. I was nicely dressed. We did stood\nout from the rest of the people.",
        "Q: Okay. At this point...excuse me...we need to stop and pause and change tapes.",
        "A: Yah. Okay.\nTAPE #2",
        "Q: Okay. Continue.",
        "Q: So, after the Ukrainian let me go back, I was walking. We were all together but basically\nmixed with another population walking the streets of L'vov [Polish: Lwow] in 1942. I was\nwalking my friend | Velvole (ph)], farther with him, 10 feet behind us was Rappoport and\nfarther, mingled with another people. And I remember passing the street Janowska ___. On\nJanowska street, there was a concentration camp. And I remember looking through the wires\nat the Jews working, and their [eyes] because you could see it. I didn't know. I heard about\nJanowska lager, but I didn't know it was right in the middle of the town. So L...I start to shake\nin that time too. I mean shake, being that scared. And....uh...later after walking along the...all\nthe way through the town, I arrived in Skni_ Ow [NB: Polish spelling], a station past ...past\nL'vov. Now I must tell you something. I was a very naive child. I had a big fantasy. I always\nfantasied. Even being in that train, I fantasized. You see, I did read a lot. A lot of Jack\nLondon and all the books; and I was always dreaming of traveling, of adventures. And for\nsome reason, I'm even ashamed to admit, I felt like I'm there...adventure. It was a mixture,\nbeing some hero of mine...from some book going to borders and...and feeling as a Jew,\nit's...1t's a deadly game. It was a mixture. Anyway, when I come to Skni_ ow, I...I didn't even\nunderstood that now the biggest... the worst part is coming now. And I spent all my Polish\nmoney because I'm going on a train and we already close to the border. I spent...I had 500\nZlotys, and I think it's 10 for something and...uh..I went to going to the toilet, looking on the\nmirror and looked at me myself and thought, \"How do you look, Tom? Face not bad. The\nnose, maybe a little bit too long, but also not bad. The hair, reddish. Not bad....\". Everything\nwas...in my opinion, I give...myself a plus...for...for the Aryan look. And...uh...the only\ntrouble was...was with my Jewish accent, and I talked Polish.\nGo back to the train, and now we have a big city street, and we suppose to go out in a town\npast the [Lsitvov (ph)] Street, and later go to the border. They're suppose to lead us to the\nborder, ...our...our...our guide. Anyway, while the train is coming close to the gate...to the\n[Lsitvov (ph)]| Street, something happened. There was a Jewish girl with us. Langer was her\nname. She was...she didn't have typical Semitic features cause none of us who did try to go\non Christian papers had the Semitic features, but she was nevertheless dark, dark eyes, so she\nalways did look out to the window when the train was moving so nobody should see her\nface. It wasn't as much as Semitic features than the look of a Jewish person in that time. This\ncare look, and so on. It was difficult to get rid of. And the German conductor did come to\nher, checking the tickets, like to anybody. And when he asked her, \"Bitte, die Fahrkarte,\"\nwhich \"Please, where is your ticket?\", she did turn over and she said, \"Bitte, Ich habe\"--\n\"Yes, please, I have.\" If she would talk still German, it wouldn't be so bad. But later she\nunderstood that she should pretend that she doesn't know German. And she started to back\noff...she was a pretty girl and he did want to talk to her and she start to talk half German 'til\nshe learned a few words in school. Anyway, she convinced the German that she doesn't\nknow German much and so he left. The Germans weren't so really sharp, but she arose the\nsuspicion of the Ukrainians. We're traveling with those. And soon Ukrainian militia man did\ncome asking her for the papers and I have done a basic mistake. Up \u2018til now, if I say a lie, I\nstart to get red. I start to stutter. Even now, I start to stutter. And when I was a kid, I was very\nshy. In that point, when they start to look for more Jews because they discover this girl,\ninstead to...to look around like another my neighbors did look, you know...the passengers, I\nstart to sweat, perspire. My face did get...my face did get red and I didn't know what to do so\nI took a newspaper, pretend like I'm reading. And this was even worse because then\neverybody was looking around and here's a guy reading a paper. And didn't take long when\nmy paper is taken away and I see in front of me a Ukrainian militiaman. \"What's your\nname?\" \"Me. Waldemar Ptaszek.\" And I remember I added, \"But in home they called me\n\"'Waldek.\"\" I told him this to make it more...at least I thought so, more truthful. He took my\npaper. He asked me for a document with a pictures which I don't have because I'm not full\naged. I'm under age. I have only my birth certificate. So he didn't know if I am Jewish or not,\nso he told me, \"Come with me to the toilet.\" They had a proof...to check and see if you are\ncircumcised because in America everybody practiced. In Poland, only a Jew. So they took\nme to the toilet and told me to pull down the pants. ____ pulled down the pants. They are\nlooking. Still can't find out. Something is wrong here. What was wrong? Why weren't they\nable to find out? Because two weeks before escaping, I did try to correct what my Rabbi or\nshochet, .... Who's doing the circumcisium? I don't even know. A rabbi?",
        "Q: Usually. Rabbi or [mohel].",
        "A: Whoever it 1s. I tried to correct, what 13 years ago, 14 years ago, what somebody did do to\nme. So I did...I did try to correct it with a string and with a tool and tie it. The only result was\nin that time that everything was swollen and so they weren't able to...to recognize and it hurt\nme. I wasn't able to urinate. But..uh...it was...wasn't able to see, but obviously they had seen\nthat somebody was manipulated over there, so they started talk to each other. And after the\nprofessional...the professional result, the diagnosis was that Jew or not Jew, something is\nwrong, and he took me. They took me. Pulled back the pants. The train stopped. I went...they\ntold us...they told me to go out and now I noticed they caught practically everybody...every\none of us. The...the whole group was caught, except one little boy. [Velvole (ph)], he wasn't\ncaught. I don't why. But he...he was caught later.\nAnyway, they took us to the...uh...uh...SS office where Gestapo is over there. Stryy [Polish:\nStry}] 1s a big city and there was one Gestapo is there and there was about five Ukrainians.\nThey told us to undress. We undressed. And at that time one Ukrainian hit me in my throat\nwith the fist and I was start to choke and when he want to hit me again, the Gestapo man\nstart to yell at him, forbid to hit. Yah. It's true. So he didn't beat us anymore when he forbid\nto beat us. And after they checked our clothing and discovered some money, told us again to\ndress. And they led us to...uh...like a little jail. We went in. Locked the doors. It was dark\ninside. They didn't say anything. Sitting up about an hour, the door opens a little bit, and you\nsee a Ukraine...Ukrainian guard in front and he said, \"You know what? If you will give me\nsome money, I will give you good advice. I know, no matter what still something...he said,\nyou still hide some money. After all this....\". Which was true. I had some money (laughing)\nstill hidden where they weren't able to discover in...uh...but anyway Rappoport hearing this,\nhad a glass case. Opened the glass case and he put away this little lining and picked up about\n50 marks or so hidden behind the lining of the glass case...eye glass case. And did give...give\nit this Ukrainian. Now the Ukrainian's giving us the advice. He opened more the dootr...a\nlittle bit more, so the light did come in. And he said, \"Look behind you.\" Behind us\nwas...was a window...a bar window, with bars. And something was hanging from the bars.\nHe said, \"You see it? This is long underwear. Yesterday, they arrested a Jew like you are\nnow arrested, and he hanged himself. So my advice is you hang yourself. One after another\none, it will be better than this what is waiting...awaiting you when the boss will come.\" The\nbig shot. Anyway, he closed the door. And we didn't take his advice. In the evening they told\nus to go out and...uh.. we were about 12 people, and after a warning that we will be shot if\nwe try to escape, they led us through the town of Stryy [Polish: Stryj] to another jail. People\nseeing us reacted different. Some did laugh. Some did joke. Some did spit. I've seen some\nfaces which did maybe feel for us. And finally, they took us to another jail for criminal\npolice. This was...another jail was a jail which did belong to so-called \"Kripo.\" \"Kripo\" is\nKriminalpolizei. Because they were the people arresting us, which I found out later.\nAnd...uh..over there, the same Rabinowicz who on the train... uh...was talking with me, was\nmoving back and forth...he was a hyper always. He told me and another friend, [| Velvole\n(ph)], that if you have some still money, we should give him, he will bribe the guard. Maybe\nwe could sneak out. And we have seen him a few times going out through the door with a\nguard and coming in so I did give him some money. I still had some hidden money, and I cut\noff the seam and took out. I just mention it because later it will come up again. Being 1n this\njail for a couple of days, they again transferred us to the big city jail, big four-story building.\nIn the city jail, we were in that time about eight people. The woman they took someplace\nelse. And was in the third floor, cell number 27 or 37. I think 27. And...uh...who was in this\ncell? Were about four Jews...one...two Ukrainians, one person we didn't know he's Jewish or\nnot. Weren't able to discover, so he was...uh...he did get soup...Red Cross soup. Because the\nRed Cross helped us with food, but only for the Christians--not for Jews. So he received it.\nSome people recognized...some from the jail...did hold him for a Christian, some not.\nAnyway, he had...he wasn't established, not there...not there. He was sick. He was laying in\nthe corner. And there was a German. I'll tell you about this German. It was big cell, pretty\nclean. We had four mattresses from straw, stacked a whole day one atop of another one. In\nthe night time, we did lay it on the floor, and we slept. (Pause) And it was...it was also...it\nwas there a lawyer from the city of Stryy [Polish: Stry}]--a Jewish...Jewish lawyer. He...I\nremember he had a talent...uh...he took a...a...a...comb. He was able to play a comb. And\nwhen he played the Ukrainians would listen in especial; night time they always asked\nhim...knocked on the middle of the door, \"Play a little bit.\" And because of it, they next day\nthey did give us more soup or whatever. So he has done tt.\nBut...uh..later, we had a custom...especially, the first days to tell stories of our past. And\neverybody tell...told his story. When it became my turn, I told him. I didn't have much to say.\nI was born Izbica and I am out from Izbica. But Alvin Lippmann had an interesting story to\ntell. Alvin Lippmann...uh...he was about...over 50 years old, very straight. I mean he kept\nhimself straight, slim, always his...his...coat, had a coat was buttoned and every day, he get\nup in the same hour and he was really...could be a military man. Now at that point...I hate\neven to tell the story. I hate to tell my whole story, to tell you the truth. I must again interject\nsomething. Why do I hate to tell? Because there's so many unbelievable scenes and\nsituations that if I tell everything, my whole story be...becomes unbelievable. So this is one\nof these...of these stories which I usually hate to tell, but I will tell 1t to you. You know what?\nI wrote my story in...1n...1n ghetto. I wrote it in the forest. I wrote it in Sobibor. It was many\ntimes lost, discovered. When I went out, I wrote again. They promised my story to hide\npages so I could recover after the war, which I did recover about 30 percent of it. In 1952\nfrom the 30 percent I...I did special...applied a job I should have a lot of time. And in Poland\nI used to work as a social director. In the months of..uh...uh...November, October, there\nwasn't...there was really quiet in the resort places. So I...I did fill in mine diary. And later,\nPoland...they want to publish it. But they did want to make so many corrections that I didn't\nallow it. And later when I went to Israel. They made me...let me go but this manuscript\nshould stay in the country, so I managed to smuggle out a manuscript to the\nJewish...uh...consulate in...1n Poland, and I later picked it up in...in Israel. But why Iam\ntelling you this story. Now I have a diary which I've written, in the dangerous, places my\nwhole life. What should I do with it? So I go to a Jewish survivor from Auschwitz. Actually,\nhe was the Secretary of the Jewish organization of the Auschwitz people in Haifa. I go to\nhim and said, \"Listen, I would like you should look it over, read it over and tell me what you\nfeel about this.\" Three weeks later I visit him\nand ask him, \"So, what do you think?\" And he looks at me and said, \"Oh, Yah. Yah. You\nhave a fantasy. Never heard of Sobibor. Revolt? Never heard.\" I was beaten many times in\nSobibor. Beaten by the SS. It didn't hurt me as much as if he was. And what as if he was\ndone? He done this: that for another 20 years, I didn't touch it. So, if he didn't believe me,\nwho could believe me? But later, I come to understand that people being in Auschwitz and\nBuchenwald, they were actual limited. They have seen only their own circle. And in many\ncases, ours like hiding 1n the forest, hiding and hiding was much worse than...than...than a\ncamp, than a concentration camp. Depends which kind. So anyway, but nevertheless it had\nsuch an effect that I put 1t away for 20 years. I didn't do anything. Still in America, when the\nHolocaust film did come out, I felt maybe I should do it. So I started on it. Now, why also...I\nhate ...I hate to...to publish it or whatever, because it's so...a story like this. It's hard to believe\nwhich I will tell you. Alvin Lippmann, his story. Alvin Lippmann was a German officer, a\nHauptmann [NB: Captain]. He fought in the Polish campaign, '39. He fought in the Russian\ncampaign; but unfortunately, he had a Jewish wife and two children. His wife in the\nbeginning of the war--this his story--in the beginning of the war, was under the protection of\nthe Wehrmacht because her husband was a German officer. There was a time when the\nfamilies were under protection. So later the Gestapo told him, \"Either divorce your wife. It's\nokay. Or get out from the Wehrmacht.\" He decided to get out. They let him from the\nWehrmacht. The moment he went out from the Wehrmacht, his...his family was not\nprotected anymore. And when they resettled the Jews to Poland, they settled his wife and\nchildren to Zamosc. And he left with them. He didn't want to leave his family, and they let\nhim go. In Zamosc, they made him a commandant of the Jewish police, militia. Until...and\nhe did survive until the last Aktion. The last Aktion was, they took away his wife and\nchildren, but they let him go. He was a German. So he wasn't able to protect either his wife\nor his children. That time he did try...he didn't want to go back to Germany. He did want to\ngo to Czechoslovakia, and he did try to make his way to Czechoslovakia. Anyway, he was in\nStryy when they arrested him. And he told us this story. Not only this, now the point--which\nis all--he taught...when General Ludendorff made this \"Putsch\" with Hitler, you know this\nstory, ...he took with him a company of German soldiers. Who was in this company? The\njung Leutnant [NB: Lieutenant], Alvin Lippmann.\nSo after the war, when Hitler was in the power, he did send a letter with his signature,\nprobably wasn't an original. It was a stamp. It was from the headquarters of NSDAP, the\nNazi organization. A thank you letter to...to the old fighters, all the Kamaraden. A thank you\nletter for his work for the Nazis, so he did get this letter. So he tells us this story, and the\nJewish lawyer was immediately excited, said, \"Listen, well, we have the documents. He has\nall the evidence. He has a Iron Cross. He has everything!\" And so he...he told him, \"Listen,\nyou better write a letter to General Governor Frank in Krakow and you should be ...first of\nall, you're a German.\" Second, he explained...he explained away this. And he wrote a letter.\nNow, I must go back a little bit. While we are...in this...while we are in this jail, in this room,\nwe were very hungry. We didn't get much food, but it was quiet. Nobody did bother us.\nNo...no... nobody did beat us. But once a nighttime, we heard a scream. Outside. So I went to\nthe window and looked down and right a big jail was another...uh...uh...house, two-floor\nhouse. And I observed once in awhile that some people are brought in and...uh...and there\nwas a rumor that they are Jews caught on Aryan, Christian papers or otherwise.\nAnd...uh...til...til except when the jail would be full, when there would be Aktion to Belzec,\nor to another place, they take them out. So the scream was exactly from...when they tried to\ntake them out from this jail to the...to the yard, some woman started to scream. And I was\nlooking down and I was wondering, \"Oh, God, Why we are separate? I'm a Jew too, but\nthey keep us separate ...God forbid they should take us...they should attach us.\" They took\nall...all of them away, but our room. Our cell wasn't touched. Now I'm going back. Now,\nAlvin Lippmann's letter goes out. Not long, about three days later, we heard some steps in\nthe hallways of the jail. Even this jail, we talk only Polish or Ukrainian. There were no\nGermans personnel. Once in awhile a German showed up so the whole jail was under guard.\nAnd we heard....we could... we could hear some changes. Everybody \"Achtung! Achtung!\nAchtung!\" in the hallways and we understood some big shots are coming. There are steps\nand steps and the steps stopped in front of our cell. Cell's open, and there are two tall guys\nwith the...uh...death head on their caps. You know it's SS, or Gestapo. And they opened the\ndoor, look at us and immediately \"Herr Lippmann. I understood immediately that there's\nsomething...they don't talk...they don't say to a guy they want to kill \"Herr.\" \"Herr\nLippmann,\" so he immediately stood up and they told him, \"Take your stuff and come with\nus. Please take your stuff.\" And so he took whatever he had with him and another look\naround\nand they asked Mr. Krewl (ph) ....Krewl (ph) was the head of the jail, Pole. They asked him,\n\"What are the other people doing here doing?\" And he explained that this cell belonged to\nthe criminal police and...uh...they are two Ukrainians and one, we don't know who it is, and\nthere are four Jews and so on and so. So the SS immediately put everything in order. They\ntold the Ukrainians to leave them and this guy who was not a Pole, not a Jew, they tell him\nhe's Jewish...they didn't care. If they kill....even they kill a Pole, what do they...what do they\nmean. What do they care? They classified him as a Jew, and they told all of us to go to\nthe...they should transfer us to the to another building which in between time was again\ncollecting some Jews. And you wouldn't believe it. When they took us in, me and [Velvole\n(ph)]| and another one to the other cell. It was terrible. I remember it was one room maybe\nlike this. Full of people. Dirty. Was no toilet, but there was a barrel from herring. Empty\nbarrel. And this used...this was as a toilet. I think it was a couple dead bodies laying by it. I\nstill remember if it was...1t was a Christian. I don't know if it was a Pole or a Ukrainian. I\nthink so, a Ukrainian. It was already the winter time and he was with this peasant coat, and\nhe was praying to \"Matka Boska [the Mother of God],\" to Mother Mary. And praying and\npraying. The whole day he was praying. He was treated with deep...deep respect. Uh...We\nhad people, strong men, in our cell. When lunch time did come and they threw in a sack with\nbread, and the strong man, he's supposed to divide. He didn't give everybody what belongs to\nhim, a quart...of loaf of bread, but he put in his hand and right he breaked up at least half. But\nhe can do anything. He was the law of the fist. But this man, the Christian man, he was so\nmuch respected because he helped the Jews that he...he didn't even need to stand in line for\nthis bread. It was delivered to him. Uh...uh...He wasn't biggest. I mean, we respected him\nbecause he did help us. Try at least. Now he's in the same... Well, I remember this. Now, I\ndidn't tell you this, but back still in the big cell...1n the first cell, I did become very friendly\nwith a person called Zellinger. He was a very rich fellow from the ghetto of Stryy. He was\narrested. I don't know from what reason. But he received packages from his wife in ghetto.\nAnd he helped me. When he...ever he received, he did give me...the package. And we\nbecame very friendly. His wife bribed the [Ogelobo (ph)|, [Ogelobo (ph)] is like the\nguard...the Ukrainian guard, and he received many times letters. The guard called him out,\ngive him the letter...called him outside. Anyway, he immediately...they let him come\nout...when...when they took him out, they did give him a better room, a better cell. But me,\nthe rest of them, the rest of us, were in this particular, miserable room. Next day, they called\nmy name. They called [Velvole's (ph)] name. We were called outside and pushed into\nanother cell where Zellinger was. What happened? Zellinger did give a bribe to them.... The\nother cell was already a cell for people which had the means--doctors, lawyers from the\nghetto--and there was no hunger over there. It was clean, and there was some business going\non with the Polish prisoners. We put in a...a...a pot with the string down and the Polish\nprisoners put in some...uh...meat or whatever, sausage, and we threw out the money. It was\nsome business. So it was a different atmosphere. So Zellinger helped me. Once I remember a\nfellow in this particular room. We were waiting for a next transport. We know that the next\ntime will be we will be killed the moment the transport is ready.",
        "Q: We need to keep moving a little.",
        "A: Yah. Okay. So, I will skip this story. The point is this. Once Zellinger received a letter from\nhis wife through the guard that...uh...tomorrow a doctor will come asking for sick people.\nWhat's happened? We did get sick...sick on the...typhus that broke out. But we were afraid\nthat if we tell the doctors that some people..., the Germans that some people are sick, we...we\nknow what kind of medicine they have for us. So we were afraid, but we notified the\nJudenrat. And the...the Judenrat bribed the...the...the Germans...it's look like, they should\nallow to take out a few people from jail. Anyway, Zellinger did received a letter from his\nwife that when the doctor comes, he should not be afraid to say he's sick. And Zellinger told\nme that. And when the next day, the doctor did come, I did go to the doctor time, and told\nthem that I am sick. The doctor looked at me and he said, \"Oh, there's more sick than you.\"\nUp \u2018til now, the Germans they didn't know, because when there was a roll call in the\nmorning, everybody was able to support. Was sort of a tight room, anyway. Uh...So I pushed\nmy way...I took a thermometer and rubbed it in my shirt and I knocked it down [up] to about\n41 celsius; I should be dead in that temperature, but was so scared to start to get it back and\nanyway through my manipulation the silver inside did break down in a few places. So...but, I\nwas...very panicky, but I managed to put put it at 38 celsius, and I go back to the doctor and\nthe doctor still didn't want to accept me so I went to his helper and I remember I had 20\nzlotys. I did give him 20 zlotys. I remember punching my chest to make red spots because I\nknow my brother was sick of the typhus in ghetto that the symptoms for typhus is red spots\non the chest. Anyway, the 20 zlotys helped me. He pushed me outside. They were allowed to\ntake out a certain amount of people, about 20 people from that jail. So I was, Zellinger they\ndidn't accept him, but they accepted me. And now they were going to take us out. The gates\nfrom the jail opened, and they take us to the hospital. Now, the...the jail didn't have a\nhospital. But the ghetto had. And while the ghetto was shrinking, the Stryy ghetto, the\nhospital was out of the ghetto. So they took us to that hospital. In one room or two rooms,\nthey did...they restrict only the people from the jail. And the rest was...uh...locked up and\nguards were standing around now, too... Jewish guards, Jewish policja. So...but now we're\ngoing outside and it was winter. I remember going through streets of Stryy and thinking,\n\"Should I run now? Should I....\" because the Jewish policia...they were only guarding. There\nwas no Germans. But they were in front with the Jewish...uh..nurses, and they didn't give a\ndamn about us, thinking that we are sick. And was a ideal time to jump out and just go. But\n[...I did look for a partner. I didn't have a penny and didn't know where to go. So I noticed\nanother fellow who I thought maybe he is simulating sicknesses too, and I told him, \"Listen,\ndo you want to run?\" And he told me, \"Don't do it now. Let go to the hospital. My father's in\nthe ghetto and my father will come. He...will have money and everything else.\" So I...I\nlistened to him. So now we're in this hospital I explained, this room.\nVisitors from the city were able to come in, but we weren't able to go out with the Jewish\nmilitia... uh... uh ...watch us. It didn't take long. He was really sick. So I wasn't able to go\nalong later. I was sick. I don't want to go into any particulars, but I was sick. (Sigh) Now,\none evening at 4 o'clock, the doctor comes in without his hat. I still remember. And he said,\n\"All prisoners from jail should go out from the room and go across the yard to the next...uh\n.. Next apartment...next house...___ house. So I wanted to get up and I did get up and this was\nabout January 8, 1943. And I go out and I...I don't remember now what's happened, what's\nmake me to turn back. I had a big white skirt--shirt, long shirt--and go out and it was cold\nand I remember I felt my feet were...my sole was like burning from snow, from the frost.\nEither this make me turn back or I notice a German soldier standing next to this next\nbuilding. Anyway, I turned back, went back to my bed and hide under the bed. Hide under\nthe bed; takes maybe three minutes, I hear somebody comes in. I looked from under the bed,\nand I see a Jewish policeman. Now it's a Jew, no matter what. I did move out and said,\n\"Listen. What's happened here?\" He told me, \"You here?\" I said, \"Yes.\" He said, \"Well,\nthen, don't be afraid. You will hear some shooting, but be quiet.\" He went out, and later was\nsome shooting, screaming. And nobody did come back; except a couple of hours later, I see\nthe doctor comes back. And like a...before the doctor come back, I was ready to escape.\nWhat's happened? When we were tn hospital...in the hospital, everybody was forced to give\nup the clothing to the dis... disinfection, but I managed not to give up. I did give up a shirt,\nbut the rest was hidden under my mattress with...uh ...my idea to escape. So while...shooting\nwas finished and nobody...uh...did come in, I did dress myself slowly from the stuff under\nthe mattress. It was no militia now watching us because everybody's supposed to be killed,\nand I want to go out, but I was so shaky that my movement...I still was sick, that I...I've seen\nthat I wouldn't go too far. They will recognize me immediately, so I went back under the\nbed. Later, I see that the doctor comes in. So I move out and say, \"Oh, Doctor.\" And he\nasks...sees me and said, \"Oh, How...what are you doing here?\" And I told him what I have\ndone. And he said, \"No, it's...it's impossible.\" Because they killed everybody from jail.\nThere were 20 people. They killed everybody. So he started to check. What's happened?\nWhen it's the high point of the typhus, there's a ttme when people run like in high fever.\nThey lose their conscious. They just run. I think it is about the tenth day of the sickness when\nthe crisis comes. And many times while we were 1n this...uh ...1n this hospital, from the\nneighboring rooms because neighboring rooms was Jews from the city, they did try to run in.\nMany times they did run in..in our restricted room, but the Jewish policja pushed them back.\nProbably every day happened something like that. They would start to run so when the\ndoctor was checking, he noticed that a bed from the adjoining room is empty because he\ncounted the bodies. There was 20 bodies. If the Germans would kill only 19, they would\nlook for me. But they were 20. So what's happened...what's happened is this..is the doctor\nfigured out....that cell...this guy, Ledermann and I...we didn't know...he...many times he did\ntry to get in the last few days to our... everybody's gone. There was no guard. He's gone. And\nhe took my place. So he told me, \"Tom, you go in Ledermann's bed, and from now on you're\nnot Blatt. You're Ledermann.\nSo in this way, I managed to go out from the jail, and not be a prisoner. Later, I don't want to\ngo into details again, I was healthy already and was ready to go out from this hospital and the\nmoment I did go out...I was ready to go out, the Jewish policeman did come. He practically\nsee me every day that I can go out from the hospital. I must give him money. I says, \"But\nlisten, I don't have money.\" \"No. You don't have it? Try to steal. Do whatever you want. I\nneed money. Because I saved you.\" I said, \"How did you save me? I did see you and did\ncome out for help to you. You didn't save me.\" Anyway, this policeman, this militiaman was\nmy tormentor. And...uh...I wasn't able to go out from the hospital. And the doctor told me I\nmust go out. You...you can take...we need the place for somebody else and I tried to avoid\nhim, but he took away this bed from me and he took away the food from me, so I was\nstealing in night time. Finally, they caught me. They grabbed me and they simply threw me\nout from jail. I didn't even go 200, half a mile when a militia man, another militia man I\ndidn't never know...a Jewish militia man did run after me. \"You dirty...you go go back. What\ndo you mean? You will escape from us?\" And (laughing) took me back to this hospital. Not\nonly they took me back, but listen. They had again a group from jail. Separate. He put me\nwith them, where I was in the beginning. Anyway, as I start to cry, and the doctor comes to\nvisiting and he noticed, \"Listen, I just threw you out. What are you doing?\" So I start to cry,\n\"What's will happen, will happen?\" And told the whole story. Told the whole story, so he\ncalled up Mr. Stark. He was the head of the Jewish...this probably you could check with any\nsources.... He called out the Jewish militia, and Mr. Stark, the commandant, did come and I\nremember he called in this...this tormentor of mine, the Jewish policeman who didn't let me\nout, and he beat him up over there. Yah. And they told me I could go. And I...then when\neverything is legal. I asked him even for my jacket which I...which the janitor used to wear.\nOkay. I went out to the ghetto and was a free man in the ghetto. I mean free, I was not\nanymore a jailman.\nNow I find out that Izbica are still Jews and my parents are over there. So I wrote them a\nletter. I find this out while...when I was still in jail. I wrote them a letter and give the address\nto the...the hospital. And there was a answer. Even when I was in the hospital, there was a\nanswer. But my name wasn't that time Blatt. It was Ledermann. And I forgot to tell this my\nparents. Anyway, I wrote another letter, another letter. In that time the ghetto of Stryy was\nhalf empty. And I did live with that Czech boy in one apartment. I didn't need food because\nif some reason even in that time was so many food in empty houses..., it was an Aktion in\nbetween time which I survived by hiding in somebody's hiding place. But I did want some\nmoney to buy a ticket to go back to Izbica, and I didn't know how to get the money. So I did\ngo to the Judenrat, and told one official over there if he could help me. My parents are alive\nin the ghetto and I...I need some money. I need 20 zlotys. \"Why do you need it?\" \"I want to\nbuy food.\" He went in. He came out with a paper that I could have free food for two weeks\nin the hospital. Now, I wasn't able to...I didn't tell them I want to escape. I took this paper. I\nnever went to the hospital. That particular...I have a strong intuition always. That particular\nmorning, and I'm a long sleeper...that particular morning I did get up...I remember 7 o'clock\nin the morning and said, \"I'm going to the hospital.\" I started the foot go...and I didn't even\nwait for a Jewish militia man to take me to the hospital because the hospital was outside the\nghetto and you were not allowed to go alone, only on the assistance from Jewish militia. I\nwent alone. Come to the hospital and looked for some people which I will get...get friendly\nbefore.",
        "Q: Let's stop [and pause please. We need to stop anyway. Let's take a break for a moment. |\n[NB: text in preceding brackets not apparent on videotape|",
        "Q: Okay. Let's pick it up now where you left off.",
        "A: Yah. So I didn't recetve any money from the Judenrat but... uh..this...uh...paper that I could\neat, if | want to, in the hospital and in that particular day, I had some feeling I must go to the\nhospital and went to the hospital to visit my friends which I know from before. And I...going\ntoward a office to ask for somebody and I notice over there some people, I notice a woman\nsitting and I'm going out. While I'm going in the hallway, somebody is behind me, running\nbehind me...\"Mister! Mister! Wait a second!\" I stopped and this was the doctor who in the\nbeginning, who changed my name to Ledermann, and I told the story. I said, but he didn't\nremember already my first...my true name. He said, \"Aren't you...what's your name?\" \"\nBlatt.\" \"Oh, yah. Blatt. Aren't you Blatt?\" \"Yah.\" \"Oh. How are you son? Listen, go to the\noffice. Somebody is waiting for you.\" So I go to the office and he said, \"The lady is waiting\nfor you.\" I look at the lady. I don't know her. And she looks at me. She doesn't know me\neither. So she told me to sit...sit down and she said, \"You know who I am? I'm Ola. I was\nyour nanny when you was a baby...milk nanny...nanny. I mean, probably my mother didn't\nhave milk or whatever. And I remember as a child. I remember some Ola, Ola, they mention\nin our house. \"I'm Ola.\" So she said, \"uh...First you must prove to me that you are really\nToivi.\" So she start to ask me how 1s Izbica look like and how my mother and my father\nlook like and I passed the test, obviously, and she said, \"Totvi, you sent a letter,\nand...uh...from the hospital. Your mother answered immediately, and the hospital answered\nimmediately again that 'Tomasz Blatt died January... January 8, 1943, in the Jewish hospital\nin Stryy,'\" because this way it was written in the... in the books. \"And later, you wrote\nanother letter and another letter and your parents were sure that somebody want to...to get\nsome money, blackmail. But your brother was so sure that you are alive that he didn't let\nyour parents in peace. So your parents decide to send me out to find my...find by myself.\nAnd while I was sitting here, asking the doctor told me that he remembered something about\nBlatt... Ledermann...something, and later you walk in and you walk out and the doctor was\nrunning after you.\"\nSo this is another of these stories unbelievable. But I tell you, every survivor has\nunbelievable story because it was un...unbelievable circumstances, the survivor's life.\nAnyway, so she had some money she did give me immediately. And she did give me a watch\nwhich my brother had. And this...this was his treasure. In fact I can remember the watch. He\nwouldn't even let anybody touch, but he'd give it to her she should give it to me. He was sure\nI am alive. So she says, \"Now, we'll tell your parents and your parents will be in touch with\nyou.\" And she left. The same day I went outside, the watch was taken by the Jewish\npoliceman. He met me. He said, \"Oh, you have a nice watch. Give it to me.\" And I did give\nit to him. I didn't ask. Now I was waiting. I...I was sure that something will be done and it\ndidn't take long. Some middle...not the middle of the night...about 10 o'clock, a knock in the\ndoor. Somebody comes in. Who comes in? Krauser. The same... (laughing) Volksdeutsch\nwho once didn't betray us. He said, \"Toivi, Totvi. Oh, how are you doing? Totvi, listen. I\ndid...I'm coming to take you to your parents.\" I'm sure my parents paid him a lot of money to\ndo it. And he had actually a paper from the Landrat, from the district officials, that I'm\nallowed to travel with the train. Everything was legal. So I, he...and they let me out through\nthe gate to the main gate because I was with a German. And we went to the train station. I\nwas with the star...the Star of David and while I was waiting for the train, hidden in a little\nhouse close to the train station, the shadow...uh...he went in to buy the tickets. Soon he\ncomes out and says, \"Listen, Toivi, there's a train leaving in a half an hour. A regular train.\nHe stops in any stations. Some little Ukrainians, but I don't know if I will be able to protect\nyou if something happened. You were paid. You could travel the train, but nevertheless.\nNow, there's another...\" I mean this was a train was leaving in about two hours. \"But there's\nanother train,\" it was leaving in about 20 minutes, \"which is a German train from the Eastern\nFront only for Germans. If you want to go, just throw down you Star of David. Come with\nme.\" And he said, \"It's actually more secure in the den of the lions than it is...\". And I said,\n\"Okay.\" Threw down the Star of David and went with him in, and a lot of hundred soldiers\nfrom the Eastern Front...must have been 1943...we went in a compartment.\nI still remember a woman. She was from the Todt Organization. And there was two\ngendarmes in the green uniforms....I know the gendarmes and the SS...I did know by the\nskull on the hat. And they were sitting and talking and the woman did talk about...one guy\nwas from Essen. I know they did talk a lot about from the city of Essen. But very shortly, and\nlater they switched to the...to Tunis, what there was in that time...they did win some territory\nin Tunis. Anyway it was still going on...later the woman asked me if I want tea. And he told\nme, Krausfer], \"Don't talk much.\" So I said, \"Danke schon.\" And he was angry I even said\n\"Danke schon\" there. I mean in the eyes of Krauser.... But \"Danke schon\" was okay. They\ndidn't notice anything. Uh... Until later, they...across me, the soldier did pick up a piece of\nchocolate he did give me, and everybody fall asleep. So as a German I arrived, because this\nwas a fast train. He didn't stop in any station. He didn't stop in Izbica either, because it was a\nsmall stop. We stopped past Izbica 12 kilometers, Krasnystaw. Over there we went down.\nAnd here the...Krauser said, Tom. Now here we must part. You must go by foot 12...12\nkilometers and I can't be with you anymore...anymore because everybody knows me there.\"\nSo...but he forgot to tell me that my parents moved. So I went to Izbica night time, come to\nmy home and knock in the door and there's a voice, \"Who is it?\" I say, \"It's me. Open.\" I\ndidn't recognize in the beginning. Well, inside they recognized me and said, \"You dirty Jew.\nRun away. You don't live here anymore. Go over there.\" So we were living 1n that time in a\nrundown place, so I come to this place. It was everything night time. It was very dangerous.\nKnock on the...there was some shutters, so I putted my finger behind the shutters because it\nwas everything dried out. You know the rundown houses; knock slowly in the window. I\ndidn't want to scare my parents. And heard a voice, \"Somebody's knocking.\" Later, I've seen\nlight and later, I say \"It's me. Toivi.\" And hear mine brother screaming, \"Toivi! Totvi!\" and\nthe doors open in the back and I go in, and my mother kissed me. My brother jumped on me.\nHe didn't want to let me...but the next question was whether you have your watch. (laughing)\n\"Give me back my watch.\" And...uh...my father, he pretend...uh...he didn't...he...he was\nrather a hard type. He pretend he didn't cry but I..but I've seen him...I've seen red eyes. And\nnow the story was going on a whole night.\nTheir story, to tell in a few words. After this, after I left, they made Izbica \"Judenrein;\" by\nthat time my brother and father were hidden. My mother was in Warsaw, also escaped. Soon\nafter I escaped. Later, they made Izbica again a \"Judenstadt.\" And actual when I researched\nthe German document...there's a document which Izbica... there's a nation...Izbica 1s to be a\n\"Judenstadt\" again. And...uh ... first my father returned, later and other people returned and\nagain, I don't want to give...there's a few interesting stories about this, but they will drag on\nso I will miss it. Just tell you that Izbica did again become Judenstadt. My father returned.\nMy brother returned. My mother returned. And...uh...of course, now I am back. More people\ndid come back. My mother had a beautiful job as a...1n a German company as a bookkeeper\nin Warsaw, as a Christian girl. She was blonde, thin, short nose. Very Aryan-looking.\nUnfortunately, they told me later that my little brother wrote her a letter that my father is\ngoing with another woman or sounding like that, and they told me she returned. She was\njealous or whatever. So now I'm in Izbica. In the morning, I go out to my Izbica, I'm back in\nmy town. Go out and the first guy I see is a good acquaintance of my family from the...the\ncoop...cooperative [spo _dzielczo or landszo __(ph)] and I say, \"Oh, hello. How are you?\"\nAnd he looks at me, \"You dirty Jew. You are still here?\" I can't believe it. I met another one\ngood. He said, \"Oh, your time will come soon.\" And I feel it's not my Izbica anymore.\nMaybe it never was. So I go around into houses. There were 200 Jews and they live about 10\nJews to one room in a little area. There was a tannery where most Jews lived. And...uh..I felt\nsomething happens. Something will happen and I want to go to the Partisans.\nSo I go to the Partisans. They told me, \"You can't go without a gun.\" They wouldn't take\nyou without a weapon. So I went to buy weapons. I don't have money. But I have a friend.\nHzick (ph) And I tell him, \"Listen. Let's buy a gun.\" He didn't have money either. So I\ntold my father, \"Listen, I don't want to sleep in this room. There's too many people. I want to\nsleep in the attic. Could you give me a blanket? And could you give me a coat, a winter\ncoat?\" He said, \"Okay.\" So I took it and sold it. I still didn't have enough for a gun.\n(Laughing) So finally [zick, Izick _ (ph) | did have the money, bought a gun and he\nhide it. He hid it in the...in the straw, in a place over there in the tannery. In the tannery was a\nhorse who did work in this...this...1n this towel I hid the gun. One day...but I was so in love\nwith the gun that many times I kept it in my pocket. Once I go with my...once there was a\nrumor that the Germans asked how many Jews are in Izbica. And that time my father was the\nJudenrat, the head of the Judenrat. The 200 Jews, were three people in Judenrat...my father\nwas...another one was Blanck and Kornfeld. So I did know immediately. So I remember\nwalking with my father to a Polish lady...was in Kovin, and I still remember the road, and I\nsaid to my father...that...they asked for the Jews. \"Isn't that something dangerous?\" He said,\n\"God knows...knows.\" I said, \"Dad, Let's buy a gun.\" He says, \"No. You can't buy a gun.\" I\nsaid, \"Dad, I have a gun already. In fact in my pocket.\" And he looked and he could see\nthis...uh...outline and he said, \"Be careful. Be careful. Don't...uh...we could get killed.\" But\nthe way he said tt, I've seen that is really the tragedy. Another time...maybe a half a year ago,\nhe would say, \"Tom, hide it. Throw it away.\" He didn't say this anymore. He let me keep it.\nHe just says, \"Be careful.\" The gun didn't help...help me anyway because when the time did\ncome, I remember I heard a big shot, jumped from the attic down. I hurt my back. Until now,\nit's hurting me. Did run to the hiding place. As I said, Izbica was in a valley. A lot of houses\nwere built in the hills so one wall was actually a built in the...1n in the hill. So one wall of this\ntannery was built in in the hill, so what we have done, we moved a panel and digged a very\nbig cave for about a lot of people. And was so nicely done nobody did notice this entrance\nand we hid over there. We heard the Germans coming in, looking. They went out. They can't\nfind us. We so happy. Next we hear again coming. Polish voices. \"No, they must be here!\nThey must be here! They are here!\" And the Germans start look again. And these...the\nPolish helpers start to help them, rip out the...the panels. And I still remember being over\nthere sweating. It was hot. And while they were pulling the panel, flashes of daylight did\ncome in in this cave. And the panel was like a spring. It didn't want to give in, like she would\nlike to save us. Unfortunately, crack! The panel went up, and they told us to go out. I\nremember I went out and I had only one shoe. And I was asking the German if I could go\nback to this...uh...to pick up another shoe. He allowed me to do it, and now they took us\noutside.\nAnd outside was many Jews already con... congregated and they surrounded by a few\nUkrainians there. But by being covered I managed...I actually managed to sneak out from\nthis...from this circle group, and I went outside and I had the knowledge that I cannot go\nout...I can't go outside from the town because on top of the hills is a ring with soldiers.\nIzbica's surrounded. I had a notion that I must hide on the foothills where the Christians'\nhouse are. Izbica...himself...the valley was...down was only Jews, but in the foothills, where\nthey're going to the top of the hills were Christians' houses...uh...farms. So I went into a\nblacksmith's shop and he said, \"Tom, Go out. Go out. I'm afraid.\" I went out. I went up\nfarther. Look happened and I met...I met my schoolmate, Janek Knopczik. \"Janek, hide me.\nPlease.\" \"Yah, sure, of course, Toivi. Go into the barn. Fast.\" So I went to the barn. And he\nwent...and he left. Well, I got to the barn. There's a padlock. I can't go in. So I start to look\nfor a place to go in, and there's a Polish Christian woman asked...yelling, \"Tom! Over here!\nRun away! Run away!\" So I asked, \"Why shall I run away?\" \"Because he's\ncoming...coming.\"\u201d \"Who's coming?\" \"[Knopezik.\" So Knopezik will come. He will open\nthe...the...the padlock. And I didn't run away. And here's Knopczik coming with a Nazi.\n\"Take him. He's a Jew.\"",
        "Q: Stop. Perfect. Let's change tapes very fast.\nTAPE #3",
        "Q: Okay. We are ready.",
        "A: So where am I.",
        "Q: Alright, you had just been...",
        "A: So he had... so he said...so he said to this Nazi, \"Take him. He's a Jew.\" So I said, \"Janek!\nYou're mistaken! He's joking.\" \"No, he's a Jew.\" So, and the Nazi said, \"Come.\" So Janek\nKnopczik also said, \"So, okay, I will see you in a shelf in a soap store.\" Because there were\nrumors they are make soap from...from Jews. So his goodbye was: \"I will see you in a shelf\nin a soap store.\" Okay, and I left and to make it short, I can't tell you more because there's\nstill some going on; but finally, I find myself with the rest of the Jews on the marketplace\nsurrounded by the Nazis. There was a woman I remember. While we were sitting on the\nmarketplace, on the cobblestones, there was a woman crying and running from one\nUkrainian to another one. \"I am not a Jew. I am not a Jew. I am not guilty. Please, I'm a\nChristian lady. I'm not a Jew. Is I'm not guilty at all.\" And they let her out. She was a\nmistake. They grabbed her, too. So she was not guilty being a Jew. I remember my school\nteacher, Steidel (ph). Very fine Pole. He...he was there, the head of the school. I remember\nwhile I was sitting on the cobblestones, I remember him walking...uh...uh...on the sidewalk,\nand he didn't want to look at us. And I felt...I still don't know why, this a little thing. So many\nother things to remember and I remember him. I remember his face. I remember he was\nfeeling for us. When another Pole did stare at us. Talking ...he did walk by like we didn't\nexist, and his head turned away. And I remember this picture. And I remember it was a\nbeautiful April day, April 28, and I was sure I will die. Finally, two trucks arrived. They told\nus to step in. We went in the trucks. The trucks were covered with canvas. It was dark inside,\nand the trucks started eastward and now there's hope. Maybe, it's not so evil because in the\nroad from Izbica, there's two concentration camp. There's Trawniki [NB: labor camp for\nJews, subcamp of Lublin]. There's Zawada [NB: labor camp for Jews] . We passed the\nturn off to Zawada and our hope is down. People are praying. They passed the turn off to\nTrawniki, and now we know in front of us is Sobibor, and we know what Sobibor is. And\nsome people...and everything is in the dark...uh....uh... in the truck. It's dark. And I hear\nvoices, \"Let fight. We will die anyway.\" I know the voices. \"No, we will die anyway. Let's\ndie together with the families.\" But they mood is that we will...when we stop, we will throw\nourselves on the Nazis. Finally, the truck stopped.\nAnd I remember still a voice. Somebody cut the... remember still while driving... my...\nmy...1n fact, my father's face...he was sweating terrible. I remember wiping my father's...wet\nforehead. It's wasn't completely dark. It was still...from the front some light coming. And I\nremember the voice, and finally the truck stopped....stopped and I hear a voice. Somebody\ncut open the canvas and noticed...looked outside that and said, \"Ist schwarz von Ukrainen.\"\n\"It's black from Ukrainians.\" Now this meant Ukrainians...the Nazis...they walked\nwith...because they walked with nothing...they had black uniforms. When he said, \"It's\nblack,\" he meant it was so many of them. It's no use. And he told us to go down. And we go\ndown and really, there were many Nazis. We were surrounded very tight with machine guns\nand everything. Probably the Nazis did...had experience. They did know that this a crucial\ntime when people coming and seeing there in front of Sobibor. So we stood up. We get out\nand we stood in front of the gate. What did I see? I see a big fence camouflaged by pine\nbranches, braided in...in the barbed wires, and a gate. On top of the gate a big sign, black and\nwhite, \"SS Sonderkommando.\" \"Sonderkommando\" meant special command. The gate\nopened. We go in. They told us to go in. I go in, and I can't believe it. I...my dreams and my\nnightmares...what I had about Sobibor...I imagined Sobibor's a Hell. Belzec's a Hell. Sobibor\na Hell. It looked like a Hell. And how's a Hell? I have it from my...my aunt's\ndescript...descriptions. Dark, and people running around with tar and with whatever. It's\nmiserable. What did I see? A beautiful, little place. Lawns, beautiful flowers. A nice train\nstation. Nice little houses. \"Schwalbennest\" was the title of one house. It means...uh...uh...\n\"Schwalbennest\" [Translation: \"Swallows'Nest]...uh...how is it in English? Anyway,\nand...uh...they told us to stop; and I think, \"This can't be a death camp. How could such a\nplace be a death camp?\" Birds are whistling. Nice trees. I still will remember the shape of\nthe...of the sky...of the...uh....(pause) Oh, what is in the sky?",
        "Q: The clouds?",
        "A: The clouds! And I didn't want to die. But I've seen the fire. From...there was far away,\nfarther, there was a...where they burned the people. I've seen the fire from behind...was again\na fence camouflaged. And I could feel the smell. And I thought and strange enough, I wasn't\nafraid of dying. I was afraid of being burned. And...uh...suddenly a voice, \"Men right,\nwoman, children should go left.\" And then I was always now with my mother when we\nwent down from the...from the truck. And that age when you are 15, you could pretend to be\na...a child or you could be a man already. But instinctively I felt it's better to be with men, so\nI kissed my mother goodbye. I said a few foolish words. [I still regret it, trying to figure out\nwhy did I say it?] It's still bothering me. I will tell you. I said, \"And you didn't want....you\ndidn't let me drink the milk yesterday.\" And she said, \"That what you have to say in that\nminute?\" And this is bothering my whole life. Why is it...? You see a day before, we had a\nlittle wooden... uh... box with ice, and the milk was over there. So I opened...I was first\nopened, I start to drink the milk. And my mother opened the door from the room. She said,\n\"Leave it for tomorrow. Don't drink everything.\" And...and now I...1in this moment, I did\ncome back to it and said such a foolish thing which is still bothering me, and left to mine\nfather and mine little brother left to my mother. We did cross each other. (Sigh) (Long\nPause) (sigh) Now (sigh) the German...when everybody went to their way, the German\nFrenzel [NB: Oberscharfthrer Karl Frenzel], with who I after the war I had a interview. He\ntold the woman and children go the direction of this fire. He left. And now he start to ask the\nmen who's a carpenter. Who's a mechanic? And I was no mechanic. What could a 15 year\nold boy be? But I did want to live so much. And wherever the Nazi moved, my eyes went\nafter him. And I really believe...(quavering) I really believe that...uh...my strong...I believe\nthat people could be influenced, that something is between people, some interaction. You\ndon't need to say it. And I felt that actually I influenced the German. When he was moving\nback and forth and our eyes met and my strong will said, \"Please take me inside.\" He\nstopped, looked at me, and said, \"Come out.\"...the Ukrainer. I should come out. And I still\nbelieve this was my strong will. I... something was which emitted from me to him. I still\nreally truly believe. And...uh...he told me to go out. My father did want to go out. He beat\nhim, and later when he assembled about 40 people, he told the rest to go in the same way that\nwoman and they left. In this way I started to work in Sobibor. Now Sobibor story.\nWhen they made a film, \"Escape from Sobibor,\" and I was a consultant, I was accused even\nby people knowing the history of the Holocaust ... even in Poland by Poles...I wonder how\nshould survive in ___ Auschwitz. A Buchenwald survivor told me, \"What a horrible film. A\ntypical horrible film. Look, the prisoners are going with the woman. Take a look how they\nlook like. We know how prisoner in a concentration camp did look like. Skinny, emaci... uh..\nworn out. Take a look there here how they look. It's...it's not a true picture of a...a Nazi\ncamp.\" Unfortunately, it was. There's a difference between a concentration camp and\nextermination camp. I don't want to go in anymore. No.",
        "Q: Just tell us where you were.",
        "A: Yah.",
        "Q: Don't worry about the film. Don't worry about...",
        "A: Yah. That...that what I want to tell you. So I remember I lay down. It was...in the barracks,\nthere was a fellow called Josel (ph). He did come write down my name, everybody's name,\nand told me to pick a place to sleep. From...all the...the three lines are free for you. I didn't\nknow that the day before they killed 72 Dutch Jews because they did try... supposedly try to\nescape. So I immediately picked on the third floor right in the corner far away from the door.\nAnd ...uh...soon as I put away...I had a little bit in the hand which I took from the home....I\ndon't know what I had...a piece of bread or whatever, I put it away in my place. I did lay\ndown for a minute. Later I did go out to the yard. And I didn't know what it was, but my\nwhole feelings about my family, I just lost them... they were probably burning in that time. I\ndidn't think. I didn't think at all. I didn't think about mine parents or myself, later; about my\nfamily until the end I was in Sobibor. Maybe this was from the nature some kind of shield,\nbut I didn't. Must admit. I didn't see anybody cry in Sobibor either. It was a different...people\nchanged, with ___ changed. Everything changed. Go out. Try to look. They have singing.\nSobibor, singing. Happy songs. Gate opens, and there're groups of people marching in.\nYoung people. Good dressed. Then again in front of them, I find out later it was a Kapo--a\nman dressed better with a big whip--and he commanded \"Abteilung, Halt!\" which means\n\"stop.\" Everything was in military fashion, and later they dispersed. While looking around I\nhear a voice, \"Totvi.\"\nTurn around and this was [Jussik Bressler (ph)| from Ko_o, my friend, who was caught a\nyear earlier. Now I have a friend. He was taken out as a dentist, not here but last Aktion from\nIzbica when they took. It was...uh...half a year earlier. And I go with him and he tells me\nabout Sobibor and later, we go behind the tailors' shop and there's a group of Jews playing\ntheir harmonica and playing the fiddle. And I'm shocked I hear music. \"How could you play\nhere in this place? Take a look at the fire.\" They said, \"Tom, we are dead anyway. You\nknow how they...they call...the Germans are calling us here? '[Nassersecker (ph)].\"\n\"[Nassersecker (ph)]\"--\"bed bugs.\" \"You're only a bed bug. And...uh...we will be dead\nanyway so you will get used to it, you see? Fires burning, you don't cry even now. You see,\nyour parents are burning over there.\" Yah. Different people. You wouldn't wonder. Some of\nthe first day maybe. And I didn't wonder later what I was seeing...the...it was couples, even\nSobibor, uh... girls and men connecting. As a matter fact, one...one couple lives here not far\nfrom Washington...survived both together. And...uh... this way I started to work. This...uh...\nThe same night in the morning, about 2 o'clock I hear a whistle. \"Everybody out. Everybody\nout.\" I go out with another people from the barrack because they're yelling...the kapos with\nwhips. They're chasing out, we go out. It's a night. Stars. The moon, ____ night. And I hear\nsomething, '\"Friseurs, here!\" '\"Friseurs\" means like barbers [Translation: \"Hairdressers\" ].\nAnd the...as a group they call themselves \"Friseurs.\" And later they call a group\n\"Gepackentragers\" [Translation: '\"Porters'|. The kapo called. I see another group goes to\nanother place, assembles. The kapo looks at me. \"Go to the Gepackentragers,\" because I\ndidn't know where I should go. So I go to the Gepackentragers, the people carrying luggage\nback. They called them \"Gepackentragers\" in German. And now...and the rest...well went\nback to the barracks. Well, later they led us...they led the barbers, the Friseurs so-called,\nsomeplace else and my group is led to a big, huge barrack with two gates, entrance gate and\nan exit gate. The gates are open and while we're waiting inside with other boys. I was told to\ncall in Dutch where the handbags should be left. And here people start to come in. Very well\ndressed. There was...uh...uh....uh...a transport from Holland. And they didn't know where\nthey are coming. They did come in passenger trains, and no idea. And they left the big\nluggage on the train station, being sure that they will be delivered. And now the handbags.\nBut here I notice some kind...that they had a strange feeling, because a woman...what does a\nwoman have in her handbag? Most precious things. She hate to part, and now they tell her to\npart with this. But there was a German immediately. She resisted, she was beaten. And one\nperson said...have seen she was beaten, volunteered to give up the handbags and they led\nthem out to the exit gate, and later they went to a yard where they were told to undress.\nAnd we...our group was still waiting in this barrack, even when the people went through. But\nfive minutes later, the Nazi calls us to the yard where the people undressed. Were undressed,\nbut now there's no people; but heaps of clothing. They told us...the Nazi tell us to...told us to\npick up the clothing and take it to the storeroom. So I picked up the clothing, took it to the\nstoreroom. It was a special storeroom. And now another transport, another group is coming\n..another 500 people. So I must run again to the first barrack. Take the handbags, and later\nagain to this. And later when the whole transport went through, the SS Frenzel told...took a\nfew of us...need to, \"Now, come with me.\" He led us about five meters from the gas\nchambers. It was a barrack where woman were coming in to cut the hair. He...he did give us\nthose scissors to help another one to finish up cutting the hair. I didn't know how...first of all,\nI never seen a woman nude. I was...even that situation, I was very ashamed. I didn't want to\nlook. I looked down, but I did get once a whipped so I picked up my head and took the...the\nshears and he told me I don't need to cut close. Just...uh...uh...If I have somebody has a\npigtail, cut the pigtails off. And there they was suspicious because the Germans told them,\nwhen they undressed before the Germans told them that they are going for a sanitary reasons\nto a barber to...to..., but...uh...some suspicion. But still they didn't think they were killed. As a\nmatter of fact, I am sure when they were in the gas chambers they didn't believe it. When the\nfirst gas did come in, probably they didn't...under...understood what's happened to them.\nAfter I finished cutting the hair, they told us to go out, and...uh...while I was still on the way\nback to my...to ...to the camp, the barracks, I heard already the motor, the gas motor working\nwith a high.... You know, at that time, the gas motor...they screamed. They started...they\nstarted very loud like \"Ahhhh....,\" even louder than the motor. They had a big motor there.\nLater about 15 minutes down...down and until quiet was. This was Sobibor.\nI was working over there for 6 months. I could...I could tell the story of...uh... one ... one\nescape and another one. It will drag on too long. Because while over there, I...I survived a\nexecution. Two people escaped and the barbed wires were cut, and the kapos immediately\nnotified the Germans and the Germans did come and Frenzel made immediately a roll call\nand he picked up every 10[th] person to be executed. So this was story. I could go on, so let's\nstop here. I went through this. Later a group working so-called \"Wald\"...\"Waldkommando,\"\nworking outside the camp cutting wood for the pyre, for the cremation. They escaped. They\nmade a revolt. And...uh...later...uh...they caught a lot of them. They brought them back, and I\nwas witnessing their execution. Things like that which I could talk a whole day and night.\nBut I will go now to the revolt. Or a little bit about myself. Being in Sobibor, I always did\nwant to escape. And I...for...for some strange reason, I always felt I will survive. I had\nalways something in me that I will survive. But I was looking. Once they did need people to\ngo to W_odawa to take apart some bakeries. They did need fireproof bricks. So the...the\nGermans asked for volunteers. Who wants to go? So I did go. Thinking that maybe in\nW_odawa I will be able to run away. But W_odawa was a situation that even the fellow\nprisoners did...did watch me because they did know if I escape or anybody else escape, they\nwould be killed. So one watched another one. We weren't able...but what's happened over\nthere...there were about 150 Jewish girls working in the ghetto, sorting some stuff. You\ncould see them from far away. And while working, when we were able to get closer to them,\nwe showed them that we are hiding money for them. So we...we have done it for about week,\nleaving money in the ruins of the ghetto to help the...the W_odawa girls. Nevertheless, most\nof them were later brought to Sobibor. This didn't help. Later was the...the\nbarrack...Waldkommander thought maybe I could work over there. In the beginning, it was\nvery nice because I had a method. I noticed that the Germans like clean people. They like\npeople going straight fast. The moment you see a run..rundown Jews, broken-down Jew,\nthey killing him. So always I kept myself clean. I put even my pants under me when I slept.\nThey should be ironed with my body, straight. I didn't need to do this too because clothing, I\ncould go any day change shoes or shirts or... because I was working sorting, and so on and so\non. But I always looked a open area. So I did go to work for the Waldkommando.\nThe foreman...the Kapo, was a good acquaintance of mine, and I asked him and he said,\n\"Okay. You could come me.\" We cut the wood. Later, ...uh...they're building a road over\nthere. And the German noticed me, Dachsler (ph), old German. And he said, \"Listen,\nKleiner, take a...take this group of people and go cut straight trees because we need it for the\nroad to put on top.\" So I had a group of people and...uh...and this was a good place to work\nbecause this German didn't beat. So anyway, going farther...so my way of surviving was stay\naway from the German. If you sleep in the barrack, take a...a...a...a...place far away from the\nentrance door, right in the corner, on the top floor even if you need to crawl...to...to it's\ndifficult to get up, do it. Keep yourself clean. Keep yourself straight. You see a German, go\nsomewhere. And...uh...and...uh... a lot of miracles. And this way I was existing Sobibor.\nUh...What also it was, I made a deal with a guy who sorted luggage. Because you sort\nluggage, you could make labyrinths. And I was sorting food. So I told him, \"Listen, I bring\nyou some food. You let me rest in your labyrinth to eat.\" So I was ...uh...taking a few canned\nfood to him, and I was eating; and later he was happy and I was happy because I was always\ntired and sleepy. Over there was a chance. I will skip little stories like this, but why I\nmention about this guy because he will come up again. Once in the middle of the night, my\nfriend shaking, \"Tom. Listen. Listen. What's happened?\" What's happened, he...he had a big\nbarrack. And the one part was...uh...uh...sectioned off for the kapos. And the door was open,\nand I heard some talking inside, so I did get up. I've seen something is going on, and I did go\nto my friend in the [bank (ph)] kommando. And I go to him, and it was dark in the barrack\nbecause what I know in which bunk he 1s, and I tell him, \"Listen, Shmufel], Hear what's\ngoing on? Something...something 1s happening here.\" So instead to answer me, he hit me in\nmy face with a...with something...some kind of metal, I know. So I thought \"If he knows and\nhe doesn't care, it's okay.\" So the next day there were rumors that the Kapos did plan to\nescape, but more people find out and they did...uh...want to go too. Anyway, I told you. But\nagain, by working...in that time I used to sort clothing...uh...I've seen the whole Kapos, a\nwhole group of kapos being taken to the crematorium. So I was wondering what's happened?\nBut again, a little bit later, I see this Berliner, the guy who used to...uh...the Lager, he used\nto sort luggage, has the uniform of the head Kapo, and did become the head Kapo and it was\nobvious that he did betray the action. But to make it short again, we killed him later. Before\nwe made the revolt. He was...uh...killed by...uh... prisoners.",
        "Q: Tell us about the revolt.",
        "A: Okay. Now, the situation was, of course, we were sure we will die. When...uh...even if\nthe...the war would stop right now and then the concentration camp could be free, we will be\nkilled. So this was a terrible feeling, there's no way out for us. Everybody did want to escape.\nI think that whatever I was thinking to run away always, everybody had in his mind.\nAlthough some people were resigned. They were Orthodox Jews, which nevertheless, even\nwith this terrible situation did pray. I remember Yom Kippur. And they did fast, and they did\nsay all the prayers and...uh...they were very observant Jews, and they still had their trust in\nGod and their tradition everything else. Now, there always was...I wouldn't say\norganization...there were a few people, influenced people in Sobibor...respected people. It\nwas a Hazzan, I remember. I don't remember his name. And was Leon Feldhandler. His\nfather was a Rabbi and he was...actually he was a member of the Judenrat in Zolkiewka, in\nthis town. And there were some talks...talks about the revolt. I was close to Feldhandler\nbecause he was a friend of my father in Izbica. He was in Izbica ghetto. He was taken to\nSobibor from Izbica ghetto in the time when I escaped to...to Stryy, and they caught me in\njail. But 1t wasn't until a transport from the Soviet Union arrived. When the Eastern Front\nwas coming nearer, the Germans eliminated the ghettos, Minsk and so on. And that time they\ntook all the Jews from Minsk, and from Lida and they brought them to Sobibor. I mean not\nall of them. A lot were killed on the spot, but a lot of...some transports come to Sobibor. And\nin that...1n this particular transport they included quite a few Jewish prisoners of war. Soviet\nprisoners of war, Jewish. Because they recognized as a Jew. In that time we had a lot of work\nand the Germans picked up another 80 people to help us from this particular transport from\nMinsk. Unfortunately, for them they picked up a few former POWS trained in the art of\nfighting. Former soldiers. And they picked up a man called Pechersky. He was a officer in\nthe Soviet Army, and ...to work with us.\nPretty soon, Leon Feldhandler recognized this potential material and he contacted, Leon\nFeldhandler, and Leon Feldhandler contacted Sasha Pechersky and...uh...again, I don't want\nto dwell much on it, they formed a organization. From that time on some concrete things\nhappened. I find out about a week before about the revolt. Uh... That time I was working as a\nFeuermann. How did I come to be...to get this job? Feuermann is like firemeister...master.\nAll the documents, heaps of documents, passports, pictures, books, soiled clothing was\nburned. While they were burning it, when I was sorting, I put the papers in a big blanket.\nLater with the blanket was still full, I put it on my shoulder and take it to the fire. Taking it to\nthe fire, I started to get familiar with the guy working over there. Did bring him some food.\nAnd slowly by slowly, I start to helping him; and later, when they built a bigger oven, I was\nworking over there as a steady personnel. My idea was to work in a...to be enclosed, out of\nthe view from the Germans. I could see them. They can't see me. From the window, I was\nable to see. But once I wasn't able and there was a terrible beating. But anyway, so...they\nplanned to kill a German in my place. So this way...but I did need to be contacted.\nOtherwise, I would...some stranger comes into this place, I would chase him out, being\nafraid myself. So he calls me in the evening and tells me, \"Toivi, I must tell you something. I\nknow you. I know your father. I will tell you something, but keep your mouth shut. We need\nyour place to kill a German.\" I was shocked. Later, I find out about what's happened. And I\nwas informed on the purpose. I...I understood that something is going on, and I was informed\nabout Sasha. Especially I was a guy...I was a guy in Sobibor which always did run around.\nYou know, I didn't keep in a place. I was always hyper and would just run. I did want to\nknow everything like I would be...go out and I'd write book, which I've done, actually.\n(laughing) I was always a very...boy who...I want to know everything. So in this way I did\nbecome, I was involved in it.\nSo I know the first plan was...there were different plans. The first plan was to dig a tunnel\nfrom the blacksmith shop through the barbed wires to outside. But when they analyzed it, it's\ndid come out that we need to work many, many days, nights to dispose of this very\ndangerous dispose of the soil. They need to find a way. And when...let's assume everything\nis okay. Six hundred people should go through the tunnel single file without quarrel will take\na whole night. Isn't practical. They threw it away. The next one was to poison...to kill all the\nNazis while they're in bed, because there was a group of young kids like me, they called\n\"putzers,\u201d which each morning 4 o'clock they're allowed to go out from the barrack to go to\nthe Germans and while they are in the bed, clean their shoes, clean their belts and so on. This\ntime to smuggle in instead a such a young boy should go a little bit older, at night and kill in\nbed and get their weapons. But they did...they discon...they disregarded because they\ndidn't...they weren't able to depend on young people doing such an important job. Anyway, a\nplan was accepted...the final plan, to kill all the Germans in a matter of one hour, between\nfour and five. We based our success on the German punctuality...punctuality. Discipline.\nAnd the plan was that the heads of the workshops because besides the people working in\nconjunction of the extermination, there were workshops. Tailors, shoemakers working for\nthe Germans only, because there was...so much... they had a labor force. Why not? So they\nestablished a few small workshops for themselves. And always a German have\nsomething...made something for himself, a uniform or shoes; or the...heads of the shop\nshould make appointments with the Germans to come on that particular day, October 13, for\nappointments between 4 and 5 o'clock. And over there there would be some people which\nwill... which will kill them. So I know about this plan. And this should happen between 4\nand 5, and the whole lager should look normal. We should not...we should not use the\nweapons which we get when we kill Germans so not to...before the time.\nI remember I was in that time waiting and mine fire place...1n mine place...where I burned\n...where the oven was. I pushed all these papers against the window so nobody should be\nable to look in because in, because in the sides when did people did bring me documents,\npapers, we threw 1n in the sides, and the the oven was in the middle, and I just later burn it.\nSo anyway was a window so I blocked the window and was waiting. And..uh...now I see a\ngroup...uh ... because they were divided. The organization had about six fighting groups of\nthree people and located in different places in the camp waiting for the Germans to be lured\nover there. So I see the group 1s supposed to come to mine place coming to my direction, to\nmy oven, but they're passing me. They're going in a different way. So I was panicky, but\npretty soon a Jew called....from 6d_, Sender, comes to me and said, \"Tom, they decide not\nto do anything to your place because the guard...the tower guard was very close.\" I was very\nclose to the fence and he could notice a German comes in, doesn't go out and could be\nsuspicious. \"We rather...we'll kill him in the men's storeroom.\" Then he told me to go over\nthere, and over there my job in that time was to stay guard on the...on the gate\nleading...connecting Lager | and Lager 2, because also we was connected...was divided in so-\ncalled four lagers, like 1, 2, 3 and 4. In Lager 1 were the building where they used to sleep\nand these workshop. Lager 2 we sorted, and Lager 3 we did burn, and Lager 4, we were\nbuilding something over there. So anyway I was suppose to stay guard and because this gate\nwas very close to the storeroom I just seen them both coming in. He was called in..1n to try\non a leather jacket, because it exactly his size. And he did go in and suspected nothing.\nWhile he put his hands in this...now this I haven't seen. This...the moment he was killed, he\ndid come out...the guy which I know and he told me that while he was coming tn, the Jewish\nprisoner said, \"Achtung!\" immediately. \"Attention.\" And start attention, took this leather\njacket and he immediately...he hold it for him and while he put in the hands in the leather\njacket, his arms very immobilized like....like in a straight jacket, and he was killed with an ax\nand we had a first gun. I was scared up to that point. I remember when he was killed and the\nguy who killed him did come out. He's a little bit blood on his shoe. He patted his pocket like\nto say, the gun is here. I...my whole ...[ wasn't scared any more. I did want only to know\nwhat will happen to me a half an hour later. That I did want to know. And I...I...I did know\nthere's no way back. This 1s it. They killed...as long as we didn't kill the German, everything\ncould be.... And later they called Beckman, and Beckman I remember he went to...to the\ndoor over the barrack and like whatever feeling he did turn around and went back and they\nkilled him anyway in the office.\nAnd to make a long story...and I...and I at that point, I remember there was a little train, like\na miners train, for the miners. Little wagons with a little electric engine. And the German\nwho was the head of this little train which connected all the Lagers with Lager 3, was\nalready killed. But inside I notice there's canned food. So a few cans, put into my pocket.\nAnd I remember I had friend, Linda Karoten (ph), Linda ____.. And she said, \"Tom, you're\npreparing like for a picnic.\" And I said, \"If we will survive we will need it.\" And later\n[...[...] eat. I ran in the forest. I reminded him this, that he said I'm preparing like a picnic\nbecause we used it later. We're so hungry and I had it. Anyway, now I remember the\nforeman was a French Jew...Jacov Dunietz [NB: Joseph Dunietz], and the foreman from the\ngroup did come to me, \"Tom, maybe you have some money?\" Because many times when I\ndid burn in my oven the soiled clothing...when the clothing was burned or books, some\nmoney did come through in the ashes. And when I cleaned the ashes, I find some gold\nalways. It did lose the luster, but it was not.... So...uh...he did know I could have it, so I did\ngive him some money. And the Germans were killed. Nobody did know. I was wondering\nthat...this was like normal. First of all the Kapos...the Kapos which were...there were two\nKapos in the organization...and they were instructed to use the whip to beat us like everyday.\nAnd they have done it. And I remember like every day, singing. We went back to Lager 1\nfor...uh...supper. And now the biggest shock. And this was I think was the...the most\nimportant ingredients of the success was so few people did know. There were...we were\nabout 600 people. And this was the time before the roll call when we stand in line in front of\nthe kitchen to eat. Believe it or not, practically the whole camp was still like every day\nstanding in the line. Maybe about 50 people were missing, the people which did know. But\nsoon one told another one, \"Listen, forget about supper. Something is going on. Let us grab\nan ax. Grab anything and be prepared.\" Now the dangerous moment did come because up\n'til now...the...the Germans were free to go and come. Each German has a place to watch.\nThe sorters, where clothing was sorted, there was a German standing. But he was allowed to\ngo for a cup of coffee or whatever he want. And another German ...let say...from the shoe\nsorters, the place they sorted shoes, did come by and he didn't notice the German who's\nsuppose to be by sorting clothing. He wasn't suspicious. He thought, \"Oh, maybe my friend\nwent for a cup of coffee.\" But now, 5:30. Well, the...the time did come close when all the\nGermans supposed to be in this place, Lager Ein, to...they witnessed the roll call. And now if\na German is missing, they will look each other. So we did know that the crucial time is\ncoming and... uh...uh...the line in front of the kitchen start to...to dwindle and I remember a\nshot and I remember Sasha Pechersky jumping on a table. And why I...now...a one Kapo\nwhistled a whistle, like for a...like for a roll call. Normal. And made it a little bit earlier. The\noriginal plan was actually to march...",
        "Q: Stick with what happened.",
        "A: Yah. The original plan was to march out to the front gate, but we heard a shot and the plan\nwas disregarded to march out to the front gate because probably the...the guard wouldn't\nknow what's happened and we could go too close, very close maybe to them also. But I\nheard a shot, Sasha jumping on the table and he start to talk, \"Listen.\" Something in this\nsense. \"Listen to me.\" I remember only one sentence from the whole talk. It was very short.\n\"The time did come that we will take revenge. We killed practical all the Germans. Now let's\nstood up and fight our way out.\" In this sense...but the sentence I remember exactly what he\nsaid was: \"If someone, if you will survive, he should remember to told...to tell the world the\nstory of Sobibor.\" And that what I did never forget, and that what I am doing. And\nsuddenly...I don't know if this was arranged, prearranged or not, but while he was still\ntalking somebody yelled, \"Hoorah!\" from the people standing. And another one picked up,\n\"Hoorah!\"; and the third one, and suddenly everybody, \"Hoorah, Hoorah,\" and start to run. I\ndidn't want to carry an ax, so I picked up a knife. I prepared a knife from before. It was easy\nto hide a knife. Was a knife somebody probably from some...somebody brought us...to\nSobibor maybe a rabbi or so...or so, because had pearl handles and the on..on the handle was\nwritten Kusheshov Paisach (ph) [NB: Kosher for Pesach]. It's some kind traditional knife.\nWas big, so I took it. My knife in the hand and start to run with it and biggest group to the\ngate leading up to Lager I, and over there I remember one Ukrainian did come by\naccident...did start to drive in with his bike, and he was thrown immediately from his bike,\nand I remember the bell was cut immediately with the gun. And while running through I\nknow...I remember and on the left side, a Ukrainian guard with his rifle standing like\nthat...like a...like a fixiated and just turning around himself. He could use the rifle and shot,\nbut he was handling it like a stick, like somebody hold...hold a can...cane, and just turning\naround. He didn't...he didn't know what to do. And I was running to go with the people to the\nfront gate and half way I heard some whistles...shot was all the time, but I heard whistles like\nfrom bullets whistling and I noticed and I, on the left side behind a barrack 1s a German with\na machine gun shotting at us. And here two my friend fall down, another one third. And I\nstarted to back up. I did run back. While everybody was running...running to the front, I did\nrun back. And...uh... some way I find my way to a little gate in a hallway for the guards,\nbecause between the fences guards were walking, this time empty. Probably I went into that\ngate. Luckily, I had behind myself...I left one barbed wire fence and another barbed wire\nfence. Now I had only one barbed wire fence in minds. Come to the fence, the last fence...the\nfreedom is, only the fence. I can't go through because I had a knife. If I had a ax I would cut\na hole. Instead, I don't know what to do.\nAnd here close me was Sasha Pechersky and Shlomo Szmajzner [NB: Stanislaw Szmajzner;\nsurname also spelled Symyzner]. Now, Shlomo Szmajzner had a rifle, and I remember\nwhat...this a minute later. And Sasha was with a knife only. And sudden, and suddenly a man\nappeared with a...with a ax and start to cut. He made a hole in...1n the fence. Now...but more\nand more people come and they don't wait in the line when machine guns are shotting at us\nto go through the hole. They start to climb on top of the fence. In that time exactly when I\nwas halfway going through the hole, the fence collapsed from the heaviness of the...of\nthe...from the weight of the people which actually I thought that time...and it was over me,\nand that time I thought this is the end of me. But actually, this saved me. Because the first\nfew went through I could see why the people is depending on me. The mines exploding and\nbodies flowing there. And finally when...when everybody when through at least at that part\nof the fence and I can't go out...from ...from the fence because the barbed wire did go in in\nthe clothing. So I left my coat. By the way, I had a leather coat from...I took it the last minute\nfrom the storeroom. It was also maybe lucky because the...the barbed wire wasn't able to go\nin too deep to the...my shirt or whatever. Anyway, I just slid out from under my coat and\nstart to run. I fall down a couple of times. I thought I'm shot and I wasn't. I start to run until I\nreached the forest. Now, I'll really speed up. Come to the forest. We are wandering about the\nday, the next day we come to a point and we undert...I already understood that it's not good to\nrun there. We are about 50 people. The next day we met another 30 people. So, and I've seen\nthat we are too many and must...something must be done. But...uh...we still kept together\nuntil one...until early in the morning. I remember we stopped out of the forest and Sasha said\nthat we must go out to check where we are, and they need money. So whoever had the\nmoney to give money to buy food. And all the men with rifles did left. Nine people with\nweapons left. We were against it. We understood that something is wrong. Only Shlomo\nSzmajzner was left, only because the rest of us surrounded him that we must have a guy with\na rifle left. And he promised he will come back. He did never come back. I talked with him\nlater after the war. Or maybe I shouldn't go into this. He said when I met him that this was\nhis soldier duty to go back to...to the army. Anyway.\nSo when he left there was real tragedies because groups start to form. The weak people did\nwant to go with the strong ones. And it was unforgettable...unforgettable scenes, which I\nwon't even to go in it. Finally, I took two boys and we left. Shmuel Wycen [NB: Samuel\nWeitzen]|, who used to work with me as a fireman, and his friend, Kostman, Fredrick. We\neluded the guards. We eluded the...the Germans and we made it to mine hometown, Izbica.\nOver there, I thought I have a Polish friend who was a good friend of my family who will\nhide us. The two boys didn't want to go into the town. They were in the forest. But I left to\nthe town in the evening, hoping that nobody will recognize me. It was sort of dark. I come to\nthe Polish lady. She didn't want to hide me. So I left back and told the guys, \"Listen, it's no\nway. We must look for another place. But you know what? Let go first eat. We're hungry.\nCome.\" Not far, we have seen light from a little farm. And we go to this farm. We were\nafraid to go in the villages. But these were farms..were little farms...little houses ... uh...single\nhouses. So we were not as...not as scared so much. We went into this little house, little farm,\nwe have seen from the forest. We come. There's light. We go into the kitchen. There's food\non the table, but no people. We call...I call, \"Farmer, Farmer.\" In Polish: \"Dzier_awca.\"\nNobody answered. Finally, we go back to this room and start to eat. We go back out again\nand finally, I see a little boy. We asked him, \"Listen. Come here. Where your father?\" And\nhe comes. He recognized we are Jews. And he said, \"Oh, my father and mother are scared.\nThey thought you are...you are bandits. And they're robbing so much here.\" So he called the\nparents. The parents did come down with his sister. I recognized his sister. I used to go to\nschool with mine... with...with me. And the atmosphere start to get warm, and later I told\nhim, \"Listen, Mr. Bojarski, what would you take to hide us? You are far away from the\ntown. Close to the forest. No neighbors. We will pay you good. And I have a house. After\nthe war, I will give you this house we have in Izbica.\" \"I will think about it. Go back to the\nforest.\" To make it short, in a couple of days he agreed to hide me.\nWe did put in so much gold and diamonds, and he was excited. His wife took a ring. His\ndaughter, earrings. \"Take it. Keep it. Fine.\" He built a hiding place in the barn. In the corner\nin the barn, he put in a table, covered it with a lot of straw. From outside, you had a panel\nwhich he opened to give us food. (Sigh) Okay. We were...I will skip also my adventures in\nthis hiding place and the way I did try to go out because I recognize it's late. And I will go to\na point where once in the nighttime, we hear some...the dog barking. People screaming.\nFinally, we heard people coming in in the barn and yelling to him, \"Tell me, where do you\nhave the Jews?\" Show me the Jews.\" And he...we recognized the voice of the farmer,\n\"There's no Jews here. No, there're no Jews.\" \"Yes, we know there're Jews.\" \"No, there're\nno.\" \"So tell me...where do you have...so nice, from where do you have so nice clothing?\nYou go to church nicely dressed, and your wife....\". Well, I understood. We were so happy\nthat he didn't drink. Because a lot of Poles are drinking. He didn't. But what he has done, he\nHoved nice] clothing always. Shoes for his sons, pants, sweaters; so this was noticible. So\nanyway, and they start to look for us in the straw. They didn't find us and they left. After they\nleft he did come in in the hiding place. \"You see what's happened? What would happen,\" he\nsaid, \"he did discover you? They would kill you. They would kill me. And the worse is\nthat...what a shame would be to my family when they...they did find out that we're hiding\nJews.\" Now I...I didn't have formal education, as I said, but I did read a lot. And he had a big\ncross on..on his chest and asked him, \"Mr. Bojarski, why are you ashamed? Why...why\nshould your family...should family be ashamed? You know Jesus Christ was a Jew.\" For\nhim it was the biggest insult. To accuse Jesus Christ of being a Jew! And probably when I\ntold him...on top of it, I told him the picture, \"Last Supper,\" he has in the kitchen: All 12\napostles are Jews. And the...1t was that a insult to him that I accused the apostles being\nJewish. Anyway, he went out mad. Couple of days later he comes, \"Guys, I have for you\nguys a hiding place. Because I find out that the Germans will search for Jews in any farm\nwhich 1s close to the forest. So only for 3 days I made another hiding place.\" And one\nevening, he did come. He told us to go out. And I expected hiding place if he's so afraid he\nwill do it, he will make it some place far away from him in the forest, I mean. But he made it\nright out behind the barn. It was already suspicious, but I still didn't suspect.\nWe didn't remember he.... When I went behind the barn, I noticed ...uh...a little carriage with\ntwo wheels. Two wheel carriage. No? Like a platform with two handles. On top of it was a\nbig millstone, a stone we'd make flour with it, in the old type mills they have grinding stones.\nAnyway, a big stone. I didn't know it. It was standing.... Later, I connected it. Now, he\npicked me up here by mine waist and pushed me in that hole, and later he pushed 1n another\none and later we did ask him for a kerosene lamp which he did give us. Put in...have the\nkerosene and looking. We're were in a hole about a meter and a half, a square meter and a\nhalf. The roof was...I've seen it from inside, a 2 by 4 long and across were pine branches and\nsome straw. The opening was a round opening maybe a square foot, a foot round or maybe a\nlittle bit more. We barely squeezed in. Was now pushed in straw on it. And so on. We are\nsitting inside and later we hear and that they're pushing something hard and something\nfall...very heavy on top of the hiding place. And what's happened, the 2 by 4 break down like\na letter V. So we said, \"Oh, God. Is broken down. Must go to him and tell him that\neverything is breaking...is breaking down. So we tried to push out the straw. Kostman was\nactually over there pushing out the straw. He said, \"I can't push out the straw.\" Now the\nlamp start to flicker...flicker, flicker and goes down. And what is interesting. I didn't feel\nshortage oxygen, but the lamp didn't want to burn anymore. I put in a match, start again to\nburn for a second, and out. Later, even the match didn't want to start and I start to feel, you\nknow, [not] enough air. And all the time the third one--Wycen, Shmuel--was holding with\nhis arm the 2 by 4, it shouldn't break down. He was supporting it. So (clearing throat)\nFredrich was, so Wycen screamed, \"Pull down the straw!\" So we pulled down, still no fresh\nair. He said, \"Something is blocking the entrance.\" Finally, we hear something sliding\nand...and this breath of fresh air comes in. And he opened it. And now we are going out.",
        "Q: Tom, we have about 4 minutes and what I need quickly is what happened and how did you\nget liberated.",
        "A: Okay. He did try to kill 1t. He didn't make it. He did give us...still we didn't believe it really.\nWe did go to the old place. And one...it didn't take much, but three days later, he did come\nwith helpers. Shot at us. Shot at my two friends. Shot at me. I pretended to be dead. Later\nwhen he took the...our clothing, and saying, \"Now we will check the Jewish clothing for\nmoney,\" when they went to the house, I did get up and run away. After I run away, I was in\nthe forest for awhile. Later, but he was...he didn't know I'm alive and if I'm alive he'll be in\ntrouble. Later and so he always watched us. I was always a step in front of him. And finally I\ndid run away in a different area where a few Poles did...did know my father, as a\nPolish...what would I say? Patriot...and helped me into...go into a Polish partisan\norganization called \"Bataliony Chlopskie,\" peasants battalions. And I worked over there as a\ncourier until the end of the war.

I was\nwalking my friend | Velvole (ph)], farther with him, 10 feet behind us was Rappoport and\nfarther, mingled with another people. And I remember passing the street Janowska ___. On\nJanowska street, there was a concentration camp. And I remember looking through the wires\nat the Jews working, and their [eyes] because you could see it. I didn't know. I heard about\nJanowska lager, but I didn't know it was right in the middle of the town. So L...I start to shake\nin that time too. I mean shake, being that scared. And....uh...later after walking along the...all\nthe way through the town, I arrived in Skni_ Ow [NB: Polish spelling], a station past ...past\nL'vov. Now I must tell you something. I was a very naive child. I had a big fantasy. I always\nfantasied. Even being in that train, I fantasized. You see, I did read a lot. A lot of Jack\nLondon and all the books; and I was always dreaming of traveling, of adventures. And for\nsome reason, I'm even ashamed to admit, I felt like I'm there...adventure. It was a mixture,\nbeing some hero of mine...from some book going to borders and...and feeling as a Jew,\nit's...1t's a deadly game. It was a mixture.

        "A: In a little town, Izbica. This is in the Lublin district.",
        "A: This town was a very interesting town, because...uh...it's a hundred percent Jewish town.\nIn...uh...in 1870...uh...a Polish aristocrat...uh...did recetve a permit to build a Jewish town.\nAnd...uh...in a place close to the river Wieprz, he established this...uh...Jewish...uh...town. In\nthe beginning, there were about four houses according the... the what I discovered in the\ntown....",
        "A: Okay....It's a typical Jewish town, a shtetl, hundred percent Jewish. The Christian population\nlived around the town, on the foothills. About 3,000 Jews used to live there. Uh...And\nthe...this town was built in a valley surrounded by hills, or mountains, and this the Germans\nlater used for the purpose which we will come to it. We had..uh...one shul and about three,\nfour Beis Medresh [NB: Beth Midrash]. Very deeply orthodox. As a matter of fact, I\nremember there was next to it a town, Zamo __, and one Saturday, some Jewish or free...they\ncalled them \"free thinkers\" did come with bicycles. On top of it they were without caps,\nwithout a hat. And I remember the...half of the town they chased them out with sticks and\nwith stones because they come on a Saturday and...um... Saturday, Friday in the evening and\nthe next day Saturday, the town was quiet because it was a holy day, like nobody in the town\nexcept in the evening. I remember Yom Kippur. You could feel it in the air. You could see\nthe people moving by to...to the Beis Medresh...or to the temple, to the shul. It was deeply\northodox. There were a few which did try...uh...to reach out. For instance, my father.\nIn our town everyone had a name; on top of it, he had a special name given. For example, if\nhe does...he didn't have a leg, they called him [Leme Yoine (ph)]. [Yoine (ph)]| was his name,\nbecause uh...my father, why I'm telling him was because my father was already what you\ncall \"free thinker.\" He did try to move out from the orthodox ways, so they called him\n[Leibele Goy (ph)]. It was..., my [NB: his] first name was [Leibele (ph)], he was Goy\nbecause he did...uh...smoke cigarettes sometimes Saturday. They did know it. You can't\nsneak...you can't smoke cigarettes in Izbica but when the...the shutters in the the home\nweren't closed, all the peoples in the neighbor did know that my dad was smoking cigarettes\nSaturday because of it. I remember mine...if you talk about my childhood. I will tell you a\nstory which will give you an idea. Uh...For example, my father had a Polish friend, a\nChristian. He send him out to buy pork meat usual; because...uh...nobody could see my dad\nbe going into...uh...to buy pork meat, of course. So he sent this Christian friend. And I...once\nI remember and my father told me, \"Try it.\" And I tried it and I liked it. But in that time they\nused to live in so-called, in a [Urisha (ph)|. You know what [Urisha (ph)] is? [Urisha (ph)] is\na house because it was built maybe 50, 80 years ago by my grand, grand, grandparents and\nlater when the children did get grandchildren, they get married and so on, they divided this\nhouse. So...uh...finally when I...was already over there, when I was about 10 years old, this\nwhole house was divided with partitions that everybody could hear everybody across the\nwall. So mine...mine aunt did hear me...did hear the conversation with my dad and she\nnoticed by listening in that time, I'm eating pork meat. So what...the next thing I remember\nshe opened the door where my father lived and said, \"Tom.\" \"Toivi,\" not \"Tom.\" Not Tom.\n\"Toivi, you eat pork meat?\" I said, \"Yes, Mimi, I ate.\" \"You know what [Streicher\u2019 (ph)]\nis?\" \"Yes, I know what [Streicher (ph)] is.\" \"You will go to Hell.\" I know about Hell\nbecause my uncle told me stories, how they burn people and everything else. \"Promise me,\nyou wouldn't eat any more.\" So I say I wouldn't. And she left. And I was such...so scared\nabout Hell and everything else that immediately...1t was a shock to me I remember...what I\nremember is I...I was in a high fever and laid down the sofa and my whole head was just like\na...like a mill. And I was sick for about two days. They called the doctor and that time, you\nknow, the doctor...doctors used to come to the home, and he said, \"Give him aspirin. I don't\nsee anything.\" And finally when my Mimi did come to visit me, and I remember the first\nthing what I ask her was, \"Mimi, will I go to Hell?\" And she probably understood what the\nproblem is; that I simply, that I'm that scared. I'm sick from being scared. And she said, \"Oh,\nToivi, you know, don't worry because when your Bar Mitzvah will come, God will forgive\nyou everything.\" Now, this...this had a fourfold effect because I wasn't afraid anymore. I\nwas Okay, but I again I did...when mine...the next time my dad did ask me if you want a\npiece of pork meat, I said \"Yes,\" because anyway, in about two, three years God will forgive\nme. So anyway, I just tell you a little picture it was. Some people they tried to get out from\nthe circle of...uh... orthodox behavior, but it was very...it was trying. But...I otherwise,\nactually it was a deeply Jewish town.... uh ...with a very big respect for the Rabbi. The Rabbi\nwas our authority. And...uh...Friday, with the shochet and everything else. And so it was 'til\n1939, when the war started.",
        "A: Uh...I remember the town...you know, we didn't have...uh... radios in that time, so any news\n'He may be using the Yiddish word \"treife\" here.\nwas...uh...transmitted by person who had a big...uh...drum...uh...Jewish guy. His name was\n[Hydel (ph)], and he did go to the middle of the town to the marketplace and drummed up\nuntil all the people had come together, and now he said, \"Hello, hello. This is the news...\"\nand so on. He did say that a war started. Hitler invaded Poland, and a mobilization is in order\nand...uh...he was the latest news from the Burgermeister's office, Mayor's office, I would say.\nAnd he advised to glue in strips of paper on the windows so they shouldn't shatter if the\nbombs fall down, and that was the news. So people start to pick up newspapers, cut it in\nstrips, and glue in and some people did prepare dry bread; and so it was in our place too. And\nlater I remember planes coming. I remember Polish plane shot down, and the next I\nremember my family was moving out from the town, hiding in a village from the bombs. We\nwere afraid that Izbica will be bombed because there was a big factory, a military factory in\nIzbica uh producing material for fortification purposes. So I went to this village, Panska-\nDolina.\nOver there, I remember Polish soldiers and I remember when the news arrived that the\nSoviet Union is fighting against Poland, too. I remember the speech from the Polish officer,\nthat they have, they are stabbed in the back by the Soviet soldiers and now they will fight to\nthe last drop of blood. And ...uh...later I remember the rumor, the Germans are coming, and\nnow we are a group of people about 25. We don't know what to do, scared in the forest. The\nyoung people say, \"Oh, we will run away from the Germans. We are going across the river\nBug to the Russians.\" The older people, mine parents included...my father, \"No, we're going\nback to Izbica. Germans. Of course, they're anti-Semites, but they're also people.\" And I\nremember we split then. It was in the night. I remember the stars and could be about maybe\n12 o'clock in the middle of the night, like a...like a film, like a movie, we departed. And the\nsons did walk to the east, and some parents did go back to Izbica. And I went back with my\nparents. We come to Izbica and now...uh.. (chuckle) interesting news. The Germans are\nleaving. So I said, \"The Germans are leaving. I didn't see a German soldier. I must see a\nGerman soldier.\" So I went down looking for a German soldier. \"Oh, there're two German\nsoldiers still in the bakery buying bread.\" So I went to the bakery and I seen in front of them\ntwo German soldiers with bikes and talking and they...they sound like Yiddish because\nGerman is pretty close to Yiddish. So I was wondering...take a look, they're speaking my\nlanguage. (laughing) And...uh...I did say hello to them. We did talk a little bit. I Yiddish and\nthey're German. There's nothing wrong with it. And they left. Uh...A day later the Russians\narrived. What it was in the beginning, that the Germans simply did go too far and later\ndid...did come to agreement about the...the demarcation line, and they moved out. And the\nRussians arrived. In that time the local communists organized their own militia and they\nwere in power for about two weeks and later again, it's a mistake. The Russians are leaving\nagain. The Germans are coming. So again what should we do? My mother told my father,\n\"Listen, Let go out. I know Russian. I know the language. Let go out from here.\" And my\nfather said, \"No.\" Actually he bought a horse and carriage already. And later he said, \"No, I\nwas born here. I could die here.\"\nAnd my father for some reason, which saved me later in my life I could say, he was in a way\na Polish patriot. He was a volunteer in the Polish legionnaires, so called Pi_sudski's\narmy...uh...uh...in the First World War. He was wounded. He was a invalid. And...uh...which\nwas, you know, a very horrible in that time. So he...and he said, no, he will stay here. He was\nborn here and he...he could die here. And he stayed. And this was...and this sealed our future,\nour destiny. So I've seen the Russians going, and a lot of Jews did, runned after them close\nby the...the regular army soldiers, everybody going east. And I was a child 12 years old, but I\nfelt that something historical happened, that something...I felt something is wrong. We\nshould go. But we didn't. The Russians left and Izbica was a no-man's land. No Russians. No\nGermans. The Germans did come. But they stopped about 12...12 kilometers before Izbica in\na district town of Krasnystaw. Izbica was nobody. So two...the third night, sitting in my\nroom I hear a big explosion. And suddenly \u2014 screaming, yelling, \"What's happened?\" A\ngroup of Jews stood on the street outside talking, and some Poles throw a grenade at them.\nAnd they killed a few and they wounded a few. So we start to be terrorized by the Poles. So\npeople were scared to go outside the town and there's another legation did form, a Jewish\ndelegation, under the leadership of Miss Roetenstein. Still I remember her name. By the way,\nthis 1s the same, this 1s my Mimi (chuckle) which she told me I shouldn't eat...I1 shouldn't eat\nunkosher. Under...under her leadership, they went to Krasnystaw. Actually, to invite\nGermans to come to Izbica because it...1t is no law in Izbica and we are afraid and that they\nmust come in. So Germans did come into Izbica to protect the Jews.\nNo, you must understand that there were no Gestapo in the first days. There were simple\nWehrmacht soldiers. And there was also called an Ortskommandantur Wehrmacht, a local\ncommand...command of the soldiers arrived and they patrolled the streets so they were pretty\nquiet. As matter of fact, the Jews used to do business... uh...with the soldiers. I remember\na...kids did go out and buy from them cigarettes and sold...uh...different stuff. It...1t was\nrather peaceful with them, until Gestapo arrived. There were two of them. Ludwig Klein and\nKarl Engels. Both survived the war, and I was a witness against both of them at Hamburg.\nThey both committed suicide in...1n Hamburg after the war, being 1n jail. Well, anyway,\nthese two SS were a terror in Izbica. Every day, before breakfast, they went out, killed five,\nten Jews; and later they ordered breakfast. It was unbelieve...unbelievable and we realized,\nfinally, that we have no rights. And many times we wished that if the first Germans which\narrived, if they would kill a 100 Jews, if they would terrorize the town, it would be a blessing\nbecause everybody would escape with the Russians. You understand? In the beginning!\nBut, unfortunately, for us the first Germans were good Germans, so- called. So...now it was\ntoo late, and we were in a trap. In that time, again, compared to the future, it wasn't so bad.\nThere were still families. Some people were killed because of Engels, but otherwise it was\npossible to live. There were...uh...there were labor camps and Jews were forced to go to\nwork in labor camps. In the beginning, they were forced to work on the streets from 8 o'clock\nin the morning til 7 o'clock in the evening, and they were released home. Later, as I said,\nthere were labor camps where they went out for a month or for a week. They worked. Later\nthey...they were exchanged. New Jews did come and they were let home.\nUh... Now on that point, I must tell you that the Germans 1n that time established Jewish\nCouncils, so-called \"Judenrat.\" And through the Judenrat, they were able to execute their\norders, so the Judenrat sent people to work in the labor camps and the Judenrat also after a\nmonth or so sent new people. The old ones...the first ones should be released. So it wasn't a\norder. Now, everybody, according...according the rules, everybody was supposed to go for\none month to the labor. But again, if there was a rich fellow in the list he was able to pay the\npoor...to pay the poor fellow, and he did voluntary go. But as the time progressed, it was\nworse and worse. We heard about beating. We heard about torture, and people refused to go.\nIn that time the first so-called \"Aktions\" happened. \"Aktion\" is a roundup. It started with\nroundups to the labor camps. They would come in the morning and told the Jewish Council\nto deliver 500 men or 200 men. If the Jewish Council wasn't able to deliver through their\nown police, they started indiscrimate to go from house to house, beat, shot... Ukrainians,\nwhich worked with the Nazis together. And they...they caught...they simple caught people on\nthe streets 'til they get the amount of 500 people and they took them away.",
        "A: I was a goy in ______ the picture and later got to the ____.. So in that time, I was already in\ndanger. I was, of course, 12, 13 years old, 13. So my father looked for protection. What\nabout my family in that time? My mother, of course, was a housewife. My father lost his\nbusiness, He had from before, as a legionnaire, he had a liquor store business, so-called\n\"monopol koncesja\" in Poland, uh...as a veteran from the legionnaires. Lost my [NB: his]\nbusiness, but still he was able to make a living. He was very well known. He has done some\nbusiness with the Polish farmer, even if 1t was illegal; but he did look to protect me. So he\nmade a deal with a Pole of German origin, Mr. [Platow (ph)]. Mr. [Platow (ph)] had a\nblacksmith shop. He made with him a deal that I will work for him. So I should be employed\nin case the Germans are looking unemployed, because 1n the beginning they took so-called\nunemployed Jews. I went to work about 8 o'clock in the morning til 5:00. It was hard work\nbecause in that time we had a lathe, I remember; and the lathe, it's not like now--you put in\nan electric motor, and the lathe is running. I did need to move everything by myself, and\nmany times I thought I...I will collapse but then my boss said, \"You turn. Just turn.\" And I\nthought I...I must turn because this is my protection. I must turn the wheel even if I wasn't\nable to breath anymore. But I managed. (Pause) When the Gestapo arrived, they went...they\nhad two motorcycles and a car and they...and they need a repair shop. So they went to\nanother mechanic, blacksmith. His name was [Solecky (ph)]. And the motorcycles were over\nthere, always, for the night to be cleaned or the car was over there...the Gestapo car. And\nonce in the evening I was going by, the boss, Mr. [Solecky (ph)] from this...uh...repair shop\ntold me, \"Tom, would you like to help me? I have a lot of work; stay overnight and put\ntogether a motorcycle.\" So I said, \"Okay, I will just tell my dad.\" Told my dad that I will be\na whole night working in Mr. [Solecky's (ph)... will call it from now on \"garage,\" because\nAmericans are familiar with what a...what a garage is. And while I was working next day, he\nsaid...[Solecky (ph)]...\"Listen, why don't you work with me. Leave Mr. [Platow (ph)|. Come\nto me.\"\nAnd I thought it was a good idea. First of all, I will be protected by Gestapo, clean the\nmotorcycles, and I agreed. And from that time on, I started to work...uh...for Mr. [Solecky\n(ph)] and it was dangerous because the motorcycles of the Gestapo need to be cleaned, you\nknow, spotless. And I worked very hard and I done a good job. And as I see it now, it was a\ngood choice because later when the death camps did come, I was protected practically...\npractically the last minute, and I was able to see how town is sinking down, myself being\nprotected. I didn't need to hide like another people that hide in that time. I've seen it. Okay.\nGoing back to the labor camps. Suddenly, transports arrived from...uh...Pozna_...from\nwest...from the western part of Poland...Pozna_, Ko _o, Konin, and lot of Jews arrived; we\ndivided...the Judenrat divided the people to different houses and that time I did get very close\nwith...uh...[Jussik Bresler (ph)|, who was...uh...a dentist's son from Ko _o. In our place used\nto live a man, his name was Kohn, with his wife. Once I remember...it was the evening...I\nstill remember my mother standing close...close to the window with Mr. Kohn and his wife,\nand discussing a letter. And I listen: \"gassing people, gassing....\"\" And my mother I\nremember saying, \"It's impossible. It's a fantasy. Can't be.\" So a lot of time parents don't\neven realize how much children could listen in, pretending doing something else. And I did.\nWhat I understood, and later I find out more is Miss [Mrs.] Kohn, received a letter from her\nson in Ko_o, which was still in Ko_o, that in a place called Chelmno, they're gassing people.\nHe wrote about this. But, as I said, it was dismissed.\nBy the way, her son who wrote the letter survived and he lives in [Holland (ph)], in Israel.\nAnd I later talked to him when I went to Israel. And I was in the South, reminding him about\nthis letter he wrote. Anyway, so this was a bad signal, but later quiet down. At least I didn't\nhear...at least I didn't hear anything. But once was some \"Akcja.\" The SS arrived in the\nmorning, did...uh...asked the Judenrat to deliver 2,000 people to the marketplace. And the\nJudenrat did go home to home and delivered, but a lot of people already were afraid about\nthe torture, about the beating, and hide. So the Nazis themselves start to look for them and\ncollected them in the marketplace. After such a \"Aktion,\" after the...uh...the desired amount\nof Jews were concentrated in the marketplace, everybody else could go out and uh...town\nwas like normal. The people were over there, then later they were taken to the station, there\nwere already wagons for them loaded and taken away. Like they took them away before to\nlabor camps close to Zamo _...was a labor...labor camp, [Mokre Zdanow (ph). They left.\nBut usual, in a case like this, they took away some family...family members, and the family\nwhich was left usual...usually sent some Poles, Christian Pole, a friend, to go after the train\nto see the destination. And so after this transport left, some people...Polish people went after\nthem with a bike or with...uh...either way, with another train tracing this train. The same\nnight...uh...I...a day later, I remember I was at home and I heard some knocking in the\nwindow. It was already after the curfew...curfew time. But nevertheless, many times I did\nsneak out after curfew time. But I hear some knocking, and as I go to the window\nand...uh...there was a knock like I had...uh when I went to my friend [Jussik (ph)], I knock\nthe same way...three times long and three times short it was. I recognize as my friend [Jussik\n(ph)] from...from Ko_o. So I opened the door, go out, sneak out, you know, because Jews are\nnot allowed outside, and hidden behind this house I say...I noticed [Jussik (ph)] standing by.\nI said, \"[Jussik (ph)|, What's the urgency? What is so...\" \"Tom, I must tell you something.\nTom, you remember [Ruza (ph)]?\" I said, \"Yes.\" \"She was taken before yesterday.\" \"Yes.\"\n\"She's dead.\" I mean, \"What do you mean, she's dead?\" \"I mean...you remember the\ntransport which left with the trains...the last transport of 2,000 Jew? All of them are dead.\"\n\"What do you mean, all of them are dead?\" \"Tom, you don't know?\" I said, \"No.\" He said,\n\"There's a place call Belzec, and I have a friend who just come back and he told me that all\nthe Jews, not only from Izbica, every day, thousands of them are coming in to this camp\nBelzec, and this camp should be overflowing but nobody comes out. Only people are going\nin. And night time is a big fire, and they're killing people there. I don't know how. They say\nby elect...electrocuting them.\" Because in the beginning, they didn't know the method. \"But\nthey're killed.\" I said, \"[Jussik (ph)|, you are dreaming.\" \"That's what I want to tell you.\"\nHe left. I didn't tell this my parents because I didn't want to scare them. But the next time the\nwhole town did know, that there's a death camp, Belzec, 35 miles from Izbica, and they're\nkilling people over there.\nSo everybody start to build hiding places. Before the...we had hiding places before too, but\nthey were primitive, only to...to hide themself in case they..they want to take them to labor\ncamp. But now the stake was life, and they...they start to build very elaborate hiding places.\nIn that time the Mayor of the city...in that time was a German Mayor of the city, a Polish\nGerman, \"Volks...\"--so-called \"Volksdeutsch.\" He decided to move to better location.\nBefore the war, he did live in some kind dingy, a little rundown house, but now he want a\nbetter house, so he moved exactly in the same house where we....we did live. It was\nlike...you would call it in...n America, apartment house like on the ___. In Poland, it was\nreally a little house where few families lived together. So he did become our...our neighbor.\nIn this particular house, which was a long building...we...we had about eight families, but by\nhim moving in, we did join the same attic. The attic over this house, part was on his...on top\nof his apartment and part of our apartment, so what we have done...we ask a mason to take a\npart of this attic, build a double wall. We made a hiding place over there. The entrance was\nfrom...was from our room upstairs. They build a little opening, a little door, maybe three feet\nby two. We squeezed in, went into the attic, and we were actually on...on Mr. Schultz, which\nwas the mayor, on his..on his property; so when we put against the wall our little cabinet, it\ndid cover the entrance and we were safe, and this was our hiding place. The drawback was\nthat we did need a guy from outside to...but this I have done because when was...I was\nalready protected. I told you which way. So I have done run back to the...uh...the garage.\nAnyway, now the second Akcja did come, and the third. Izbica was empty. Soon transport\nfrom Nuremberg, from Czechoslovakia, from Slovakia.... Why I say Czechoslovakia\nseparate and Slovakia separate? Because the Czech Jews, they're completely\ndifferent...uh...than the Slovakian Jews. The Slovakian Jews looked more like the Polish\nJews. Same type of people; and... uh...(pause) from Berlin...some people. In...from,\npractically, from a low population, Izbica did grow to about 15, 20 thousand; so it was even\npeople...even the street was ...were too many people to move around. So again a Akcja and\nagain did go down to 10,000...",
        "A: I will go to it. I will go; I can't describe every akcja...I will describe one big one...one where\nthey took me to Sobibor. I will tell you about one Akcja. If I will describe, if I will try to\ndescribe everything, it will be miserable, terrible, and would take me a long, long time and\nprobably you would be exhausted and I would be exhausted. I will tell you about the typical\nAkcja. It always started about, about 4 o'clock in the morning with a shot in the air. They had\nsome shotting [shooting] and the whole town was surrounded. As I said, Izbica was in a\nvalley. It was like a...a trap. You didn't need too many soldiers on top of the mountains so\nanybody should be visible...the whole town should be visible. Nobody was able to go out.\nAnd another group of Ukrainians...Ukrainians that cooperated with the Germans, went in the\ntown and they dragged people out. First, as normally before, the Judenrat call out to the Jews\nto go out to the streets and called, \"Jews, Come out. You're going to labor.\" Uh...sometimes,\neven they lured them...\"Everybody will get a half a bread...a half a bread on the...on the\nway.\" And so on. \"Come out. Nothing will happen.\" That's what the German told him to\nsay. And when then this didn't help because we did know the truth, the Germans and the\nUkrainians dragged down the houses. When I heard the first shot...not...not only me...all\nover...all in the house heard the shouting, we immediately concentrated in our apartment. In\nthat time we had a connection to the whole house. If there was no door to the next apartment,\nwe made a door or opening so everybody was able to pass, to come to our ...and we went to\nthe first floor into the attic and I put this against the wall and did run back to the garage. Oh,\nmy boss, he was, of course, a Volksdeutsche; he was so happy because now he could make\nsome money. He put on the red arm band with the \"Hakenkreuz,\" with the swastika, took his\nrifle and went out with Germans to look for Jews. The Aktion was a whole day. When they\nhad a group of about... about thousand people in the marketplace, they used to... uh...take\nthem to the train station, which was about a mile away through the whole city, the main road.\nThe main road was lined up on both ways by Poles, looking.\nAt least, I talk about mine town. And I was standing between them. I was...I wasn't afraid\nbecause the Mayor of the city had a car. I was cleaning for him. The Gestapo wouldn't take\nme because I was cleaning their motorcycles, and the policeman did know him because they\ndid come to salute him. Everybody did know I worked for [Solecky(ph)| ...for this\nVolksdeutsche. And even if they were...by chance somebody would take...take me, they\nwould take me out from the circle. I was... was sure about this. So I was just standing with\nthe Poles looking. And once I've seen...I've seen many times cases like that, but this\nparticular day was a kid, maybe...maybe seven years old which did run out, because not too\nmany Ukrainians did guard this column of people. But maybe every...every hundred feet\nmaybe a Ukrainian. It was easy to run out. But the problem was a different problem. This\nboy run out. Three minutes later, he was taken back by Poles, and pushed him back in the\ncolumn. The point 1s this, that in mine dreams I don't dream about the German peo..., about\nthe Germans. I'm not afraid of about the Germans. The Germans didn't know who I was. I\nwas afraid about my neighbors, the Poles. They were living...you see, the Germans...they\ndidn't know Jews. Their vision of Jews was from the...Rosenberg's\u2019...Rosenberg? From\nhis...from the propaganda. A Jew must have a long nose, and so on and so. But the Poles are\nmy neighbors. They did live with Jews for hundreds of years, and I was afraid of them.\nAnyway, I was sitting back and observing. Nothing I could do. Transport finally...all the\npeople were moved to the train station and they were...they weren't still enough people. Two\ntrains already left for Belzec so the Aktion was, they take another night. And that time I told\n[Solecky (ph)] that I want to hide my brother. I want to take him away to a safer place. Mine\nbrother was together with father in this attic, but I... was afraid about...uh...this place. So I\ntook my brother out. I went over there. Took my brother out, and I took him with me to the\ngarage. A whole night was going on screaming. I remember I...this...this [Solecky (ph)], my\nboss, locked me in the garage, and in the garage was a Fiat, uh, the...the mayor's car, and I\nslept in this car. And that's a terrible sight. Outside was the screaming, shouting, \"Shma\nIsrael\" and so on. I turned on the radio, and the radio...I still remember...the song. The\nradio....there was a station from Vienna and I remember the \"Lily Marlene\" song. And this\nwas singing, and the screaming...it was a...a terrible...I just turned on the radio to...to...should\ntake over, but was impossible and I'm sleeping with my brother. My brother in the back seat,\nand I in the front and my boss had a...a sense of humor, and every so often he did come and\nknock on the door. He did know I'm over there because he allowed me in the garage but he\nknocked, \"Jews, Raus! Jews, Raus!\" Just to scare me. Just for the fun, you know. And later,\nof course, he said, \"Don't be afraid. Stay over there.\" And he left.\nEarly in the morning, he opened the garage and I told mine brother to go in the...to hide\nbetween the junks and that in the corner. It was a little partition. And Ukrainians did come in,\ncleaning their rifles and cleaning their pistols, and here one of the Volksdeutsches, of the\nGerman collaborators, did come in...a guy who I know very well, and I cleaned his\nmotorcycles always. And so I told him, Mr. Krauser, I did...did want to know my family's\n* Alfred Rosenberg was a leading ideologue of Nazi racist theories and served as the Reich\nMinister for the Occupied Territories in the East.\nstill intact...I told Mr. Krauser, \"Would you like to go with me to my home to see if\neverything is okay? They did...they didn't rob us or whatever?\" So he said, \"Okay. Come.\"\nAnd so I went with him and come into our home and, of course, the door is smashed open\nand in there was Ukrainians trying on socks, changed their socks... remember still. He did\nfind a pair of socks he was changing. In another room was another Ukrainian looking in\nthere and the...Krauser, said to them \"Raus!\" He had a nice Hakenkreuz, you know, on\nhis..uh...shirt, the swastika, and he told them to get out. He was our authority, so they left. So\nwhile Krauser was down...uh..I did try to sneak in upstairs to see the hiding place is still\nintact. He noticed it. So he said...so he said, \"Tom, do you want to go upstairs?\" So I said,\n\"Aw, forget it. No. Let go back.\" I didn't want to take the chance. But he felt something and\nhe said, \"No, let go upstairs.\" I said, ''No, Mr. Krauser, no let not.\" \"Let go.\" He went up\nand I went after him. He looks around and he said, \"So, Tom.\" I said, \"Okay, everything 1s\nokay, let's go back.\" But he felt something. He wasn't so stupid. He looked around, knocked\non the floor, knocked on the wall. And later he goes to this little cabinet and wanted to move\nit. And I grabbed him by the hand, \"Mr. Krauser, please leave it.\" \"No, Tom. What 1s it?\nDon't be afraid.\" \"This is a hiding place. My parents're over there. Don't go in because you\nwill scare them.\" He said, \"Don't be afraid.\" He moved away. And he found about\nhundred...over a hundred Jews over there. He goes in, comes out, moved back this cabinet\nand told me, \"Tom....\". They called me, that time they didn't call me Tom. \"Toivi, don't be\nafraid.\" And he didn't betray it.\nLater, when the Aktion was over, the...and I did come to remove this cabinet and told them\neverything is over, and everybody went out, they made a collection of money to give him.\nBut it was after...after that. So this was the Aktion. Later were another Aktions, basically\nsimilar. I remember my aunt from Krasnystaw ____ was running wild on the street,\nbreaking ...breaking his finger. She had one little boy, also called Toivi. And they took him\naway. He was hiding...he was...I don't how come, but they took him, they left her. And she\nwas running wild on the street, breaking her fingers. \"My Toivi, they took him away...\" This\nI remember. And this was a typical Aktion. When Aktion, when they left there were\nwindows broken in the Jewish houses, people did look for gold, and there was a lot of down\non the street from the cut...they cut bedding to look for money and everything else...was like\na ruin everything. And I just...I just went house to house to notice that my friends [Srulek\n(ph)] is taken, this guy is taken, mine...mine friend, a girl was taken, and nothing you could\ndo. After each Aktion, we were promised this 1s the last ttme. Only unproductive Jews were\ntaken. You see... hope. Hope could kill, and hope could save. If I wouldn't have hope, I\nwould kill myself. So I...but a lot of people, because they hoped, they didn't fight and they\ndid go to death practically without...without resistance. Anyway, (sigh) that's another Aktion,\nanother one. Later, we hear about Sobibor. Another death camp, built this time north, on the\nnorth side of Izbica. And again a Aktion. I mustn't talk yet.\nThere is something which I could dwell on. In Izbica there were lot of Czechoslovak...Czech\nJews, from Czechoslovakia. They considered themselves, probably with German inspiration,\nthat they are better than the Polish Jews. So they made their own Judenrat....\nCzechoslovakian Judenrat. And the next Aktion, the Czechoslovakian Jews did chase the\nPolish Jews. And there was special Czechoslovakian militia...Jewish...Jewish militia, which\nchased....that time being a Czech Jew or a German Jew was a permit to live. That was a\nAkcja. When this was over, the Polish Jews would get together...not the Jews, the Judenrat\nPolish. How do I know it? I know it because my uncle was in Judenrat. He did come to my\nhome and talk with my father and I always had a...and it was public knowledge too. The\nnext...and so what's happened the Polish Jews did get...get together money and the Judenrat\ndid bribe the Landrat, because Mr. Landrat is district officials--the German, you know. And\nwhen it was next roundup, before closing the wagons, the Landrat, the district official, told\nall the Czech Judenrat and the Czech militia to go on the wagons, and [they] take them away.\nAnd this was the revenge from the Polish. I just tell you...uh...uh...uh...you could take it out.\nBut I just tell you the...the interaction, what it was. (sigh) So they played one against the\nother. (Pause) In 1942, so I was working in this garage for a long time, watching, seeing\neverything. Unfortunately, what...not being able to do anything. Once I think I helped, in a\nway, because there was a Aktion and like usual, in a Aktion...after the Aktion the Ukrainians,\nthe SS, did come to Solecky's garage to clean the...the guns. So I overheard...uh...one\nUkrainian, he said to Solecky, \"Listen, prepare for me something...some kind of, I think it\nwas a tire,\" because Wednesday, we coming back. So I was sure that Wednesday would be\nagain so I put out the word that Wednesday will be again...again a Aktion; which was true. It\nwas a Aktion next Wednesday.\nUh...up til now, my family was still intact. This hiding place was perfect. He didn't betray,\nKrauser. (Pause) Uh...me, as a boy, in the evening...uh..I used to go out after curfew to my\nfriends and we had girlfriends from Czechoslovakia and we did get together in a hallway and\nwe talk and...I, like any boys my age, 15 years, I did want to have my girlfriend. I was very\nshy, extremely shy, so finally, I...I met mine counterpart, a shy Czechoslovakian girl. And\nwe were just standing...nothing, just standing pretending to be grownup and later, I\nremember after Aktion I went to her and...uh...I went to the hallway, a dark hallway which\nalways, there...when I did come to her place and she did come out from her room and is\ntalking to me in the hallway, her mother...and every few minutes opened the door, looking\nwhat we are doing. And I come to the hallway's empty, the window's broken, and she's gone.\nThey took her away, so I thought about her mother being so protective of her, and now is\ngone. And...uh...so slowly all my friends....kids are gone. And now comes the time when we\nknow that we can't escape destiny and my father calls me and he said, \"Tom, Toivi, you must\nleave.\" Says I, \"What do you mean, 'leave'\"?\" \"Toivi, you see what's happened. The next\nAkcja will be Judenrein. That means no Jews could be. And this hiding place will not help\nanymore. So you have prepared Christian papers, so-called Aryan papers, and you will\nescape to Hungary. Your brother will be hidden here. I arranged everything by a Pole. Your\nmother has also false papers and she will go to Warsaw. And I will hide someplace here. But\nyou will go...you will...you must leave tonight.\" I don't want to go into any particulars\nabout...the...false papers, but about 2 o'clock in the night time, I recetved my papers. I\nwas...my name was Waldemar Ptaszek, and my mother's name was |Leukadia Stankewicz\n(ph)] and so on.\nIt wasn't much time to learn the new names because a half hour later, we suppose to go to the\ntrain station. Now, my mother was still...soon...soon came to my parents...I remember,\na...some gold coins. And I had about 100 mark in my pockets and a few Polish zlotys. And\nwe eat sardines...I remember me and my mother and little brother and was another boy,\n[Velvole (ph)], from another family. He's supposed to go with me. We eat, and later I kissed\nuh my mother, my father, my brother; said goodbye, and...uh...I should go...in that time, it\nwas agreed that I go to my neighbor, Schneider, wherever everybody who want to escape 1s\nconcentrating. What it was was a group of about 12 people, Jews, with false papers and a\nPolish Christian guide supposed to lead them until the Hungarian border. Close to the\nHungarian border, another fellow, Christian fellow, should take him over and try to sneak\nhim into Hungary. Now...now we say, all going to Hungary...you know, ___. To\nunderstand the desperation of the time, you must understand this. To go out from the\nghetto...first of all, to go out in curfew time, death sentence. To go out from the ghetto, death\nsentence. To be in a train, a death sentence. And you come to...to the (chuckle) to the border\nyou can't go through. You must sneak through. On top of it, there were rumors that the\nPolish guides, they take you to the border and later they rob you. They make you first write a\nletter that you crossed nicely, to lure everyone, and later they rob you and they kill you. Now\nyou understand this desperation that still my parents agreed to let me go. So I went out from\nthis...from my parent's house to go to the Schneiders'. Half way...I still can't understand why,\nbut half way to Schneider's house, I turn around and go back.\n[...I don't know...I think I was so much attached to my little brother...I think I did want to see\nmy brother again. Went back and my father was angry. I think he was superstitious, and he\nsaid, \"You shouldn't come back. It's not a good sign.\" It's some kind of superstitious. If\nyou...if you go back, it's not good. Anyway. So I felt bad that my father was angry. I turned\naround and went back to Schneider's house, and there about four girls and was some men\ncalled Rappoport from Zamo___ dressed as Polish peasant. Time comes close, and we are\nsneaking out slowly to the train station, watching that no German patrol should see us. By\nthe way, the Germans they...they walk so loud that we could hear them a half a mile away,\nbut still it was dangerous; so we sneaked into the train station but we are not...we can't go\ninto the train station because there are lamp post and it's a little town. They would\nimmediately recognize us. So we're waiting in a ditch till the train comes. The train arrives\nand before moving out, we did jump in in the last wagon. And this way we were on...on our\nway to the Hungarian border. By the way, tickets were bought by our guide beforehand; he\ndid give us the ticket for riding the train. On the way, I encountered...already in the\nbeginning, but the first 20 miles past Izbica a problem which I don't feel is so important to\ndwell on it, so I will skip it. But finally, after about an hour's drive...uh...on the road, I see\npeople closing the windows, starting to lit cigarettes. I hear some talking to themselves\nquietly. I see something change in the atmosphere. And suddenly, there's a train station and\nthe train slowed down and the left side...as if would have been a big fire, and I could feel the\nsmell. It was all over. And I understand, they're talking...they was talking...there's been Jews,\n\"Spalenie ydow\" [Translation: \"Burning Jews\" |] and so on, in Polish. And I look and\nthere's Belzec...passing by Belzec . Not knowing that a year later, we'll be in a place like this.\nAnd I...I was starting to shake. We passed Belzec. The train did not stop.\nIn the middle of the way, close to Lwow [L'vov], something happened. All eight Jews,\nthey're sitting in the same train...1n the same wagon, and there was one fellow, Rabinowicz,\nwho was always moving between us. Next to us were sitting, next to me, [Velvole (ph)],\nPolish farmers were sitting. And I heard one woman talking to another one that this one\nwhich is roaming, which is going around must be Jewish. And I was already scared, but so\nhappens, this Rabinowicz comes to me and tells me, \"Tom, [Guyosh (ph)],\" which is our\nguide, \"he wants more money. Otherwise, he's leaving us.\" So I told him, \"Listen,\nRabinowicz, you must run. Now we have really problems because next door is the woman\nwho is suspecting you are Jewish. Now you did come to me, and there's problems.\" So he\nimmediately told that...told another one, and in the next station, it was night time, we all left\nthe train and we managed to go, mingled with lot of people go to the front, and we went on\nthe same train except on another wagon. And we managed to come to close to Lwow. Now it\nwas agreed before we left Izbica not to travel through the main station in Lwow, because\nthere are rumors that the Gestapo is searching terrible this place. And they're checking\neverybody. The best place to go out a station before Lwow, go through Lwow by foot, and\nlater the next station, pass Lwow, and go on again to the train. And the guide will be waiting\nalready this station past Lwow. So we go out and the...place called Kleparo\u00e9w [NB: Polish\nspelling |. And I remember they were building some roads, so we need to go single file; and\nover there had a problem with a Ukrainian guard who stopped me but he asked me if I am\nJewish and I said no. Why did he...he didn't actual stop me. We were single file in a...1n front\nof us a Ukrainian militia man was riding a bicycle. And while he was passing our line and he\nstopped. And he was yelling, \"Eh, you, come raus!\" I wasn't sure if he yelled at me or he\nyelled somebody else. But...but nobody did go out from this...from the people moving, so I\nturned around and went to him. So he asked me...looked at me and asked me, \"Are you\nJewish?\" I said, \"No.\" \"Show me your papers.\" I showed him the papers: Waldemar\nPtaszek. In the train, I had already time to repeat \"Waldemar Ptaszek, born here and here,\nand my father's so and so.\" \"So what do you have in your rucksack?\" So I said, \"I have\nsomething...I have uh... food which I bought to...to take to my parents. I am just smuggling.\nIf you want to give me a fine, I can't help it but I don't have money.\" He looked at me and\nsaid, \"Okay. Go.\" Later...uh...I realized our mistake. I realized why...the... the...the Christian\nPoles recognized us as Jews on the train. You know why? We went into a train for\nsmugglers. And everybody was dressed like smugglers. And now the few Jews are coming\ndressed in their best because we are going for a trip. In the best...I had my shoes polished.\nWe were...we just stand up like a sore...like a sore thumb how they say it in..1n English so\nthis was our... and probably this the reason he called me. I was nicely dressed. We did stood\nout from the rest of the people.",
        "A: Yah. Okay.\nTAPE #2\nGo back to the train, and now we have a big city street, and we suppose to go out in a town\npast the [Lsitvov (ph)] Street, and later go to the border. They're suppose to lead us to the\nborder, ...our...our...our guide. Anyway, while the train is coming close to the gate...to the\n[Lsitvov (ph)]| Street, something happened. There was a Jewish girl with us. Langer was her\nname. She was...she didn't have typical Semitic features cause none of us who did try to go\non Christian papers had the Semitic features, but she was nevertheless dark, dark eyes, so she\nalways did look out to the window when the train was moving so nobody should see her\nface. It wasn't as much as Semitic features than the look of a Jewish person in that time. This\ncare look, and so on. It was difficult to get rid of. And the German conductor did come to\nher, checking the tickets, like to anybody. And when he asked her, \"Bitte, die Fahrkarte,\"\nwhich \"Please, where is your ticket?\", she did turn over and she said, \"Bitte, Ich habe\"--\n\"Yes, please, I have.\" If she would talk still German, it wouldn't be so bad. But later she\nunderstood that she should pretend that she doesn't know German. And she started to back\noff...she was a pretty girl and he did want to talk to her and she start to talk half German 'til\nshe learned a few words in school. Anyway, she convinced the German that she doesn't\nknow German much and so he left. The Germans weren't so really sharp, but she arose the\nsuspicion of the Ukrainians. We're traveling with those. And soon Ukrainian militia man did\ncome asking her for the papers and I have done a basic mistake. Up \u2018til now, if I say a lie, I\nstart to get red. I start to stutter. Even now, I start to stutter. And when I was a kid, I was very\nshy. In that point, when they start to look for more Jews because they discover this girl,\ninstead to...to look around like another my neighbors did look, you know...the passengers, I\nstart to sweat, perspire. My face did get...my face did get red and I didn't know what to do so\nI took a newspaper, pretend like I'm reading. And this was even worse because then\neverybody was looking around and here's a guy reading a paper. And didn't take long when\nmy paper is taken away and I see in front of me a Ukrainian militiaman. \"What's your\nname?\" \"Me. Waldemar Ptaszek.\" And I remember I added, \"But in home they called me\n\"'Waldek.\"\" I told him this to make it more...at least I thought so, more truthful. He took my\npaper. He asked me for a document with a pictures which I don't have because I'm not full\naged. I'm under age. I have only my birth certificate. So he didn't know if I am Jewish or not,\nso he told me, \"Come with me to the toilet.\" They had a proof...to check and see if you are\ncircumcised because in America everybody practiced. In Poland, only a Jew. So they took\nme to the toilet and told me to pull down the pants. ____ pulled down the pants. They are\nlooking. Still can't find out. Something is wrong here. What was wrong? Why weren't they\nable to find out? Because two weeks before escaping, I did try to correct what my Rabbi or\nshochet, .... Who's doing the circumcisium? I don't even know. A rabbi?",
        "A: Whoever it 1s. I tried to correct, what 13 years ago, 14 years ago, what somebody did do to\nme. So I did...I did try to correct it with a string and with a tool and tie it. The only result was\nin that time that everything was swollen and so they weren't able to...to recognize and it hurt\nme. I wasn't able to urinate. But..uh...it was...wasn't able to see, but obviously they had seen\nthat somebody was manipulated over there, so they started talk to each other. And after the\nprofessional...the professional result, the diagnosis was that Jew or not Jew, something is\nwrong, and he took me. They took me. Pulled back the pants. The train stopped. I went...they\ntold us...they told me to go out and now I noticed they caught practically everybody...every\none of us. The...the whole group was caught, except one little boy. [Velvole (ph)], he wasn't\ncaught. I don't why. But he...he was caught later.\nAnyway, they took us to the...uh...uh...SS office where Gestapo is over there. Stryy [Polish:\nStry}] 1s a big city and there was one Gestapo is there and there was about five Ukrainians.\nThey told us to undress. We undressed. And at that time one Ukrainian hit me in my throat\nwith the fist and I was start to choke and when he want to hit me again, the Gestapo man\nstart to yell at him, forbid to hit. Yah. It's true. So he didn't beat us anymore when he forbid\nto beat us. And after they checked our clothing and discovered some money, told us again to\ndress. And they led us to...uh...like a little jail. We went in. Locked the doors. It was dark\ninside. They didn't say anything. Sitting up about an hour, the door opens a little bit, and you\nsee a Ukraine...Ukrainian guard in front and he said, \"You know what? If you will give me\nsome money, I will give you good advice. I know, no matter what still something...he said,\nyou still hide some money. After all this....\". Which was true. I had some money (laughing)\nstill hidden where they weren't able to discover in...uh...but anyway Rappoport hearing this,\nhad a glass case. Opened the glass case and he put away this little lining and picked up about\n50 marks or so hidden behind the lining of the glass case...eye glass case. And did give...give\nit this Ukrainian. Now the Ukrainian's giving us the advice. He opened more the dootr...a\nlittle bit more, so the light did come in. And he said, \"Look behind you.\" Behind us\nwas...was a window...a bar window, with bars. And something was hanging from the bars.\nHe said, \"You see it? This is long underwear. Yesterday, they arrested a Jew like you are\nnow arrested, and he hanged himself. So my advice is you hang yourself. One after another\none, it will be better than this what is waiting...awaiting you when the boss will come.\" The\nbig shot. Anyway, he closed the door. And we didn't take his advice. In the evening they told\nus to go out and...uh.. we were about 12 people, and after a warning that we will be shot if\nwe try to escape, they led us through the town of Stryy [Polish: Stryj] to another jail. People\nseeing us reacted different. Some did laugh. Some did joke. Some did spit. I've seen some\nfaces which did maybe feel for us. And finally, they took us to another jail for criminal\npolice. This was...another jail was a jail which did belong to so-called \"Kripo.\" \"Kripo\" is\nKriminalpolizei. Because they were the people arresting us, which I found out later.\nAnd...uh..over there, the same Rabinowicz who on the train... uh...was talking with me, was\nmoving back and forth...he was a hyper always. He told me and another friend, [| Velvole\n(ph)], that if you have some still money, we should give him, he will bribe the guard. Maybe\nwe could sneak out. And we have seen him a few times going out through the door with a\nguard and coming in so I did give him some money. I still had some hidden money, and I cut\noff the seam and took out. I just mention it because later it will come up again. Being 1n this\njail for a couple of days, they again transferred us to the big city jail, big four-story building.\nIn the city jail, we were in that time about eight people. The woman they took someplace\nelse. And was in the third floor, cell number 27 or 37. I think 27. And...uh...who was in this\ncell? Were about four Jews...one...two Ukrainians, one person we didn't know he's Jewish or\nnot. Weren't able to discover, so he was...uh...he did get soup...Red Cross soup. Because the\nRed Cross helped us with food, but only for the Christians--not for Jews. So he received it.\nSome people recognized...some from the jail...did hold him for a Christian, some not.\nAnyway, he had...he wasn't established, not there...not there. He was sick. He was laying in\nthe corner. And there was a German. I'll tell you about this German. It was big cell, pretty\nclean. We had four mattresses from straw, stacked a whole day one atop of another one. In\nthe night time, we did lay it on the floor, and we slept. (Pause) And it was...it was also...it\nwas there a lawyer from the city of Stryy [Polish: Stry}]--a Jewish...Jewish lawyer. He...I\nremember he had a talent...uh...he took a...a...a...comb. He was able to play a comb. And\nwhen he played the Ukrainians would listen in especial; night time they always asked\nhim...knocked on the middle of the door, \"Play a little bit.\" And because of it, they next day\nthey did give us more soup or whatever. So he has done tt.\nBut...uh..later, we had a custom...especially, the first days to tell stories of our past. And\neverybody tell...told his story. When it became my turn, I told him. I didn't have much to say.\nI was born Izbica and I am out from Izbica. But Alvin Lippmann had an interesting story to\ntell. Alvin Lippmann...uh...he was about...over 50 years old, very straight. I mean he kept\nhimself straight, slim, always his...his...coat, had a coat was buttoned and every day, he get\nup in the same hour and he was really...could be a military man. Now at that point...I hate\neven to tell the story. I hate to tell my whole story, to tell you the truth. I must again interject\nsomething. Why do I hate to tell? Because there's so many unbelievable scenes and\nsituations that if I tell everything, my whole story be...becomes unbelievable. So this is one\nof these...of these stories which I usually hate to tell, but I will tell 1t to you. You know what?\nI wrote my story in...1n...1n ghetto. I wrote it in the forest. I wrote it in Sobibor. It was many\ntimes lost, discovered. When I went out, I wrote again. They promised my story to hide\npages so I could recover after the war, which I did recover about 30 percent of it. In 1952\nfrom the 30 percent I...I did special...applied a job I should have a lot of time. And in Poland\nI used to work as a social director. In the months of..uh...uh...November, October, there\nwasn't...there was really quiet in the resort places. So I...I did fill in mine diary. And later,\nPoland...they want to publish it. But they did want to make so many corrections that I didn't\nallow it. And later when I went to Israel. They made me...let me go but this manuscript\nshould stay in the country, so I managed to smuggle out a manuscript to the\nJewish...uh...consulate in...1n Poland, and I later picked it up in...in Israel. But why Iam\ntelling you this story. Now I have a diary which I've written, in the dangerous, places my\nwhole life. What should I do with it? So I go to a Jewish survivor from Auschwitz. Actually,\nhe was the Secretary of the Jewish organization of the Auschwitz people in Haifa. I go to\nhim and said, \"Listen, I would like you should look it over, read it over and tell me what you\nfeel about this.\" Three weeks later I visit him\nand ask him, \"So, what do you think?\" And he looks at me and said, \"Oh, Yah. Yah. You\nhave a fantasy. Never heard of Sobibor. Revolt? Never heard.\" I was beaten many times in\nSobibor. Beaten by the SS. It didn't hurt me as much as if he was. And what as if he was\ndone? He done this: that for another 20 years, I didn't touch it. So, if he didn't believe me,\nwho could believe me? But later, I come to understand that people being in Auschwitz and\nBuchenwald, they were actual limited. They have seen only their own circle. And in many\ncases, ours like hiding 1n the forest, hiding and hiding was much worse than...than...than a\ncamp, than a concentration camp. Depends which kind. So anyway, but nevertheless it had\nsuch an effect that I put 1t away for 20 years. I didn't do anything. Still in America, when the\nHolocaust film did come out, I felt maybe I should do it. So I started on it. Now, why also...I\nhate ...I hate to...to publish it or whatever, because it's so...a story like this. It's hard to believe\nwhich I will tell you. Alvin Lippmann, his story. Alvin Lippmann was a German officer, a\nHauptmann [NB: Captain]. He fought in the Polish campaign, '39. He fought in the Russian\ncampaign; but unfortunately, he had a Jewish wife and two children. His wife in the\nbeginning of the war--this his story--in the beginning of the war, was under the protection of\nthe Wehrmacht because her husband was a German officer. There was a time when the\nfamilies were under protection. So later the Gestapo told him, \"Either divorce your wife. It's\nokay. Or get out from the Wehrmacht.\" He decided to get out. They let him from the\nWehrmacht. The moment he went out from the Wehrmacht, his...his family was not\nprotected anymore. And when they resettled the Jews to Poland, they settled his wife and\nchildren to Zamosc. And he left with them. He didn't want to leave his family, and they let\nhim go. In Zamosc, they made him a commandant of the Jewish police, militia. Until...and\nhe did survive until the last Aktion. The last Aktion was, they took away his wife and\nchildren, but they let him go. He was a German. So he wasn't able to protect either his wife\nor his children. That time he did try...he didn't want to go back to Germany. He did want to\ngo to Czechoslovakia, and he did try to make his way to Czechoslovakia. Anyway, he was in\nStryy when they arrested him. And he told us this story. Not only this, now the point--which\nis all--he taught...when General Ludendorff made this \"Putsch\" with Hitler, you know this\nstory, ...he took with him a company of German soldiers. Who was in this company? The\njung Leutnant [NB: Lieutenant], Alvin Lippmann.\nSo after the war, when Hitler was in the power, he did send a letter with his signature,\nprobably wasn't an original. It was a stamp. It was from the headquarters of NSDAP, the\nNazi organization. A thank you letter to...to the old fighters, all the Kamaraden. A thank you\nletter for his work for the Nazis, so he did get this letter. So he tells us this story, and the\nJewish lawyer was immediately excited, said, \"Listen, well, we have the documents. He has\nall the evidence. He has a Iron Cross. He has everything!\" And so he...he told him, \"Listen,\nyou better write a letter to General Governor Frank in Krakow and you should be ...first of\nall, you're a German.\" Second, he explained...he explained away this. And he wrote a letter.\nNow, I must go back a little bit. While we are...in this...while we are in this jail, in this room,\nwe were very hungry. We didn't get much food, but it was quiet. Nobody did bother us.\nNo...no... nobody did beat us. But once a nighttime, we heard a scream. Outside. So I went to\nthe window and looked down and right a big jail was another...uh...uh...house, two-floor\nhouse. And I observed once in awhile that some people are brought in and...uh...and there\nwas a rumor that they are Jews caught on Aryan, Christian papers or otherwise.\nAnd...uh...til...til except when the jail would be full, when there would be Aktion to Belzec,\nor to another place, they take them out. So the scream was exactly from...when they tried to\ntake them out from this jail to the...to the yard, some woman started to scream. And I was\nlooking down and I was wondering, \"Oh, God, Why we are separate? I'm a Jew too, but\nthey keep us separate ...God forbid they should take us...they should attach us.\" They took\nall...all of them away, but our room. Our cell wasn't touched. Now I'm going back. Now,\nAlvin Lippmann's letter goes out. Not long, about three days later, we heard some steps in\nthe hallways of the jail. Even this jail, we talk only Polish or Ukrainian. There were no\nGermans personnel. Once in awhile a German showed up so the whole jail was under guard.\nAnd we heard....we could... we could hear some changes. Everybody \"Achtung! Achtung!\nAchtung!\" in the hallways and we understood some big shots are coming. There are steps\nand steps and the steps stopped in front of our cell. Cell's open, and there are two tall guys\nwith the...uh...death head on their caps. You know it's SS, or Gestapo. And they opened the\ndoor, look at us and immediately \"Herr Lippmann. I understood immediately that there's\nsomething...they don't talk...they don't say to a guy they want to kill \"Herr.\" \"Herr\nLippmann,\" so he immediately stood up and they told him, \"Take your stuff and come with\nus. Please take your stuff.\" And so he took whatever he had with him and another look\naround\nand they asked Mr. Krewl (ph) ....Krewl (ph) was the head of the jail, Pole. They asked him,\n\"What are the other people doing here doing?\" And he explained that this cell belonged to\nthe criminal police and...uh...they are two Ukrainians and one, we don't know who it is, and\nthere are four Jews and so on and so. So the SS immediately put everything in order. They\ntold the Ukrainians to leave them and this guy who was not a Pole, not a Jew, they tell him\nhe's Jewish...they didn't care. If they kill....even they kill a Pole, what do they...what do they\nmean. What do they care? They classified him as a Jew, and they told all of us to go to\nthe...they should transfer us to the to another building which in between time was again\ncollecting some Jews. And you wouldn't believe it. When they took us in, me and [Velvole\n(ph)]| and another one to the other cell. It was terrible. I remember it was one room maybe\nlike this. Full of people. Dirty. Was no toilet, but there was a barrel from herring. Empty\nbarrel. And this used...this was as a toilet. I think it was a couple dead bodies laying by it. I\nstill remember if it was...1t was a Christian. I don't know if it was a Pole or a Ukrainian. I\nthink so, a Ukrainian. It was already the winter time and he was with this peasant coat, and\nhe was praying to \"Matka Boska [the Mother of God],\" to Mother Mary. And praying and\npraying. The whole day he was praying. He was treated with deep...deep respect. Uh...We\nhad people, strong men, in our cell. When lunch time did come and they threw in a sack with\nbread, and the strong man, he's supposed to divide. He didn't give everybody what belongs to\nhim, a quart...of loaf of bread, but he put in his hand and right he breaked up at least half. But\nhe can do anything. He was the law of the fist. But this man, the Christian man, he was so\nmuch respected because he helped the Jews that he...he didn't even need to stand in line for\nthis bread. It was delivered to him. Uh...uh...He wasn't biggest. I mean, we respected him\nbecause he did help us. Try at least. Now he's in the same... Well, I remember this. Now, I\ndidn't tell you this, but back still in the big cell...1n the first cell, I did become very friendly\nwith a person called Zellinger. He was a very rich fellow from the ghetto of Stryy. He was\narrested. I don't know from what reason. But he received packages from his wife in ghetto.\nAnd he helped me. When he...ever he received, he did give me...the package. And we\nbecame very friendly. His wife bribed the [Ogelobo (ph)|, [Ogelobo (ph)] is like the\nguard...the Ukrainian guard, and he received many times letters. The guard called him out,\ngive him the letter...called him outside. Anyway, he immediately...they let him come\nout...when...when they took him out, they did give him a better room, a better cell. But me,\nthe rest of them, the rest of us, were in this particular, miserable room. Next day, they called\nmy name. They called [Velvole's (ph)] name. We were called outside and pushed into\nanother cell where Zellinger was. What happened? Zellinger did give a bribe to them.... The\nother cell was already a cell for people which had the means--doctors, lawyers from the\nghetto--and there was no hunger over there. It was clean, and there was some business going\non with the Polish prisoners. We put in a...a...a pot with the string down and the Polish\nprisoners put in some...uh...meat or whatever, sausage, and we threw out the money. It was\nsome business. So it was a different atmosphere. So Zellinger helped me. Once I remember a\nfellow in this particular room. We were waiting for a next transport. We know that the next\ntime will be we will be killed the moment the transport is ready.",
        "A: Yah. Okay. So, I will skip this story. The point is this. Once Zellinger received a letter from\nhis wife through the guard that...uh...tomorrow a doctor will come asking for sick people.\nWhat's happened? We did get sick...sick on the...typhus that broke out. But we were afraid\nthat if we tell the doctors that some people..., the Germans that some people are sick, we...we\nknow what kind of medicine they have for us. So we were afraid, but we notified the\nJudenrat. And the...the Judenrat bribed the...the...the Germans...it's look like, they should\nallow to take out a few people from jail. Anyway, Zellinger did received a letter from his\nwife that when the doctor comes, he should not be afraid to say he's sick. And Zellinger told\nme that. And when the next day, the doctor did come, I did go to the doctor time, and told\nthem that I am sick. The doctor looked at me and he said, \"Oh, there's more sick than you.\"\nUp \u2018til now, the Germans they didn't know, because when there was a roll call in the\nmorning, everybody was able to support. Was sort of a tight room, anyway. Uh...So I pushed\nmy way...I took a thermometer and rubbed it in my shirt and I knocked it down [up] to about\n41 celsius; I should be dead in that temperature, but was so scared to start to get it back and\nanyway through my manipulation the silver inside did break down in a few places. So...but, I\nwas...very panicky, but I managed to put put it at 38 celsius, and I go back to the doctor and\nthe doctor still didn't want to accept me so I went to his helper and I remember I had 20\nzlotys. I did give him 20 zlotys. I remember punching my chest to make red spots because I\nknow my brother was sick of the typhus in ghetto that the symptoms for typhus is red spots\non the chest. Anyway, the 20 zlotys helped me. He pushed me outside. They were allowed to\ntake out a certain amount of people, about 20 people from that jail. So I was, Zellinger they\ndidn't accept him, but they accepted me. And now they were going to take us out. The gates\nfrom the jail opened, and they take us to the hospital. Now, the...the jail didn't have a\nhospital. But the ghetto had. And while the ghetto was shrinking, the Stryy ghetto, the\nhospital was out of the ghetto. So they took us to that hospital. In one room or two rooms,\nthey did...they restrict only the people from the jail. And the rest was...uh...locked up and\nguards were standing around now, too... Jewish guards, Jewish policja. So...but now we're\ngoing outside and it was winter. I remember going through streets of Stryy and thinking,\n\"Should I run now? Should I....\" because the Jewish policia...they were only guarding. There\nwas no Germans. But they were in front with the Jewish...uh..nurses, and they didn't give a\ndamn about us, thinking that we are sick. And was a ideal time to jump out and just go. But\n[...I did look for a partner. I didn't have a penny and didn't know where to go. So I noticed\nanother fellow who I thought maybe he is simulating sicknesses too, and I told him, \"Listen,\ndo you want to run?\" And he told me, \"Don't do it now. Let go to the hospital. My father's in\nthe ghetto and my father will come. He...will have money and everything else.\" So I...I\nlistened to him. So now we're in this hospital I explained, this room.\nVisitors from the city were able to come in, but we weren't able to go out with the Jewish\nmilitia... uh... uh ...watch us. It didn't take long. He was really sick. So I wasn't able to go\nalong later. I was sick. I don't want to go into any particulars, but I was sick. (Sigh) Now,\none evening at 4 o'clock, the doctor comes in without his hat. I still remember. And he said,\n\"All prisoners from jail should go out from the room and go across the yard to the next...uh\n.. Next apartment...next house...___ house. So I wanted to get up and I did get up and this was\nabout January 8, 1943. And I go out and I...I don't remember now what's happened, what's\nmake me to turn back. I had a big white skirt--shirt, long shirt--and go out and it was cold\nand I remember I felt my feet were...my sole was like burning from snow, from the frost.\nEither this make me turn back or I notice a German soldier standing next to this next\nbuilding. Anyway, I turned back, went back to my bed and hide under the bed. Hide under\nthe bed; takes maybe three minutes, I hear somebody comes in. I looked from under the bed,\nand I see a Jewish policeman. Now it's a Jew, no matter what. I did move out and said,\n\"Listen. What's happened here?\" He told me, \"You here?\" I said, \"Yes.\" He said, \"Well,\nthen, don't be afraid. You will hear some shooting, but be quiet.\" He went out, and later was\nsome shooting, screaming. And nobody did come back; except a couple of hours later, I see\nthe doctor comes back. And like a...before the doctor come back, I was ready to escape.\nWhat's happened? When we were tn hospital...in the hospital, everybody was forced to give\nup the clothing to the dis... disinfection, but I managed not to give up. I did give up a shirt,\nbut the rest was hidden under my mattress with...uh ...my idea to escape. So while...shooting\nwas finished and nobody...uh...did come in, I did dress myself slowly from the stuff under\nthe mattress. It was no militia now watching us because everybody's supposed to be killed,\nand I want to go out, but I was so shaky that my movement...I still was sick, that I...I've seen\nthat I wouldn't go too far. They will recognize me immediately, so I went back under the\nbed. Later, I see that the doctor comes in. So I move out and say, \"Oh, Doctor.\" And he\nasks...sees me and said, \"Oh, How...what are you doing here?\" And I told him what I have\ndone. And he said, \"No, it's...it's impossible.\" Because they killed everybody from jail.\nThere were 20 people. They killed everybody. So he started to check. What's happened?\nWhen it's the high point of the typhus, there's a ttme when people run like in high fever.\nThey lose their conscious. They just run. I think it is about the tenth day of the sickness when\nthe crisis comes. And many times while we were 1n this...uh ...1n this hospital, from the\nneighboring rooms because neighboring rooms was Jews from the city, they did try to run in.\nMany times they did run in..in our restricted room, but the Jewish policja pushed them back.\nProbably every day happened something like that. They would start to run so when the\ndoctor was checking, he noticed that a bed from the adjoining room is empty because he\ncounted the bodies. There was 20 bodies. If the Germans would kill only 19, they would\nlook for me. But they were 20. So what's happened...what's happened is this..is the doctor\nfigured out....that cell...this guy, Ledermann and I...we didn't know...he...many times he did\ntry to get in the last few days to our... everybody's gone. There was no guard. He's gone. And\nhe took my place. So he told me, \"Tom, you go in Ledermann's bed, and from now on you're\nnot Blatt. You're Ledermann.\nSo in this way, I managed to go out from the jail, and not be a prisoner. Later, I don't want to\ngo into details again, I was healthy already and was ready to go out from this hospital and the\nmoment I did go out...I was ready to go out, the Jewish policeman did come. He practically\nsee me every day that I can go out from the hospital. I must give him money. I says, \"But\nlisten, I don't have money.\" \"No. You don't have it? Try to steal. Do whatever you want. I\nneed money. Because I saved you.\" I said, \"How did you save me? I did see you and did\ncome out for help to you. You didn't save me.\" Anyway, this policeman, this militiaman was\nmy tormentor. And...uh...I wasn't able to go out from the hospital. And the doctor told me I\nmust go out. You...you can take...we need the place for somebody else and I tried to avoid\nhim, but he took away this bed from me and he took away the food from me, so I was\nstealing in night time. Finally, they caught me. They grabbed me and they simply threw me\nout from jail. I didn't even go 200, half a mile when a militia man, another militia man I\ndidn't never know...a Jewish militia man did run after me. \"You dirty...you go go back. What\ndo you mean? You will escape from us?\" And (laughing) took me back to this hospital. Not\nonly they took me back, but listen. They had again a group from jail. Separate. He put me\nwith them, where I was in the beginning. Anyway, as I start to cry, and the doctor comes to\nvisiting and he noticed, \"Listen, I just threw you out. What are you doing?\" So I start to cry,\n\"What's will happen, will happen?\" And told the whole story. Told the whole story, so he\ncalled up Mr. Stark. He was the head of the Jewish...this probably you could check with any\nsources.... He called out the Jewish militia, and Mr. Stark, the commandant, did come and I\nremember he called in this...this tormentor of mine, the Jewish policeman who didn't let me\nout, and he beat him up over there. Yah. And they told me I could go. And I...then when\neverything is legal. I asked him even for my jacket which I...which the janitor used to wear.\nOkay. I went out to the ghetto and was a free man in the ghetto. I mean free, I was not\nanymore a jailman.\nNow I find out that Izbica are still Jews and my parents are over there. So I wrote them a\nletter. I find this out while...when I was still in jail. I wrote them a letter and give the address\nto the...the hospital. And there was a answer. Even when I was in the hospital, there was a\nanswer. But my name wasn't that time Blatt. It was Ledermann. And I forgot to tell this my\nparents. Anyway, I wrote another letter, another letter. In that time the ghetto of Stryy was\nhalf empty. And I did live with that Czech boy in one apartment. I didn't need food because\nif some reason even in that time was so many food in empty houses..., it was an Aktion in\nbetween time which I survived by hiding in somebody's hiding place. But I did want some\nmoney to buy a ticket to go back to Izbica, and I didn't know how to get the money. So I did\ngo to the Judenrat, and told one official over there if he could help me. My parents are alive\nin the ghetto and I...I need some money. I need 20 zlotys. \"Why do you need it?\" \"I want to\nbuy food.\" He went in. He came out with a paper that I could have free food for two weeks\nin the hospital. Now, I wasn't able to...I didn't tell them I want to escape. I took this paper. I\nnever went to the hospital. That particular...I have a strong intuition always. That particular\nmorning, and I'm a long sleeper...that particular morning I did get up...I remember 7 o'clock\nin the morning and said, \"I'm going to the hospital.\" I started the foot go...and I didn't even\nwait for a Jewish militia man to take me to the hospital because the hospital was outside the\nghetto and you were not allowed to go alone, only on the assistance from Jewish militia. I\nwent alone. Come to the hospital and looked for some people which I will get...get friendly\nbefore.",
        "A: Yah. So I didn't recetve any money from the Judenrat but... uh..this...uh...paper that I could\neat, if | want to, in the hospital and in that particular day, I had some feeling I must go to the\nhospital and went to the hospital to visit my friends which I know from before. And I...going\ntoward a office to ask for somebody and I notice over there some people, I notice a woman\nsitting and I'm going out. While I'm going in the hallway, somebody is behind me, running\nbehind me...\"Mister! Mister! Wait a second!\" I stopped and this was the doctor who in the\nbeginning, who changed my name to Ledermann, and I told the story. I said, but he didn't\nremember already my first...my true name. He said, \"Aren't you...what's your name?\" \"\nBlatt.\" \"Oh, yah. Blatt. Aren't you Blatt?\" \"Yah.\" \"Oh. How are you son? Listen, go to the\noffice. Somebody is waiting for you.\" So I go to the office and he said, \"The lady is waiting\nfor you.\" I look at the lady. I don't know her. And she looks at me. She doesn't know me\neither. So she told me to sit...sit down and she said, \"You know who I am? I'm Ola. I was\nyour nanny when you was a baby...milk nanny...nanny. I mean, probably my mother didn't\nhave milk or whatever. And I remember as a child. I remember some Ola, Ola, they mention\nin our house. \"I'm Ola.\" So she said, \"uh...First you must prove to me that you are really\nToivi.\" So she start to ask me how 1s Izbica look like and how my mother and my father\nlook like and I passed the test, obviously, and she said, \"Totvi, you sent a letter,\nand...uh...from the hospital. Your mother answered immediately, and the hospital answered\nimmediately again that 'Tomasz Blatt died January... January 8, 1943, in the Jewish hospital\nin Stryy,'\" because this way it was written in the... in the books. \"And later, you wrote\nanother letter and another letter and your parents were sure that somebody want to...to get\nsome money, blackmail. But your brother was so sure that you are alive that he didn't let\nyour parents in peace. So your parents decide to send me out to find my...find by myself.\nAnd while I was sitting here, asking the doctor told me that he remembered something about\nBlatt... Ledermann...something, and later you walk in and you walk out and the doctor was\nrunning after you.\"\nSo this is another of these stories unbelievable. But I tell you, every survivor has\nunbelievable story because it was un...unbelievable circumstances, the survivor's life.\nAnyway, so she had some money she did give me immediately. And she did give me a watch\nwhich my brother had. And this...this was his treasure. In fact I can remember the watch. He\nwouldn't even let anybody touch, but he'd give it to her she should give it to me. He was sure\nI am alive. So she says, \"Now, we'll tell your parents and your parents will be in touch with\nyou.\" And she left. The same day I went outside, the watch was taken by the Jewish\npoliceman. He met me. He said, \"Oh, you have a nice watch. Give it to me.\" And I did give\nit to him. I didn't ask. Now I was waiting. I...I was sure that something will be done and it\ndidn't take long. Some middle...not the middle of the night...about 10 o'clock, a knock in the\ndoor. Somebody comes in. Who comes in? Krauser. The same... (laughing) Volksdeutsch\nwho once didn't betray us. He said, \"Toivi, Totvi. Oh, how are you doing? Totvi, listen. I\ndid...I'm coming to take you to your parents.\" I'm sure my parents paid him a lot of money to\ndo it. And he had actually a paper from the Landrat, from the district officials, that I'm\nallowed to travel with the train. Everything was legal. So I, he...and they let me out through\nthe gate to the main gate because I was with a German. And we went to the train station. I\nwas with the star...the Star of David and while I was waiting for the train, hidden in a little\nhouse close to the train station, the shadow...uh...he went in to buy the tickets. Soon he\ncomes out and says, \"Listen, Toivi, there's a train leaving in a half an hour. A regular train.\nHe stops in any stations. Some little Ukrainians, but I don't know if I will be able to protect\nyou if something happened. You were paid. You could travel the train, but nevertheless.\nNow, there's another...\" I mean this was a train was leaving in about two hours. \"But there's\nanother train,\" it was leaving in about 20 minutes, \"which is a German train from the Eastern\nFront only for Germans. If you want to go, just throw down you Star of David. Come with\nme.\" And he said, \"It's actually more secure in the den of the lions than it is...\". And I said,\n\"Okay.\" Threw down the Star of David and went with him in, and a lot of hundred soldiers\nfrom the Eastern Front...must have been 1943...we went in a compartment.\nI still remember a woman. She was from the Todt Organization. And there was two\ngendarmes in the green uniforms....I know the gendarmes and the SS...I did know by the\nskull on the hat. And they were sitting and talking and the woman did talk about...one guy\nwas from Essen. I know they did talk a lot about from the city of Essen. But very shortly, and\nlater they switched to the...to Tunis, what there was in that time...they did win some territory\nin Tunis. Anyway it was still going on...later the woman asked me if I want tea. And he told\nme, Krausfer], \"Don't talk much.\" So I said, \"Danke schon.\" And he was angry I even said\n\"Danke schon\" there. I mean in the eyes of Krauser.... But \"Danke schon\" was okay. They\ndidn't notice anything. Uh... Until later, they...across me, the soldier did pick up a piece of\nchocolate he did give me, and everybody fall asleep. So as a German I arrived, because this\nwas a fast train. He didn't stop in any station. He didn't stop in Izbica either, because it was a\nsmall stop. We stopped past Izbica 12 kilometers, Krasnystaw. Over there we went down.\nAnd here the...Krauser said, Tom. Now here we must part. You must go by foot 12...12\nkilometers and I can't be with you anymore...anymore because everybody knows me there.\"\nSo...but he forgot to tell me that my parents moved. So I went to Izbica night time, come to\nmy home and knock in the door and there's a voice, \"Who is it?\" I say, \"It's me. Open.\" I\ndidn't recognize in the beginning. Well, inside they recognized me and said, \"You dirty Jew.\nRun away. You don't live here anymore. Go over there.\" So we were living 1n that time in a\nrundown place, so I come to this place. It was everything night time. It was very dangerous.\nKnock on the...there was some shutters, so I putted my finger behind the shutters because it\nwas everything dried out. You know the rundown houses; knock slowly in the window. I\ndidn't want to scare my parents. And heard a voice, \"Somebody's knocking.\" Later, I've seen\nlight and later, I say \"It's me. Toivi.\" And hear mine brother screaming, \"Toivi! Totvi!\" and\nthe doors open in the back and I go in, and my mother kissed me. My brother jumped on me.\nHe didn't want to let me...but the next question was whether you have your watch. (laughing)\n\"Give me back my watch.\" And...uh...my father, he pretend...uh...he didn't...he...he was\nrather a hard type. He pretend he didn't cry but I..but I've seen him...I've seen red eyes. And\nnow the story was going on a whole night.\nTheir story, to tell in a few words. After this, after I left, they made Izbica \"Judenrein;\" by\nthat time my brother and father were hidden. My mother was in Warsaw, also escaped. Soon\nafter I escaped. Later, they made Izbica again a \"Judenstadt.\" And actual when I researched\nthe German document...there's a document which Izbica... there's a nation...Izbica 1s to be a\n\"Judenstadt\" again. And...uh ... first my father returned, later and other people returned and\nagain, I don't want to give...there's a few interesting stories about this, but they will drag on\nso I will miss it. Just tell you that Izbica did again become Judenstadt. My father returned.\nMy brother returned. My mother returned. And...uh...of course, now I am back. More people\ndid come back. My mother had a beautiful job as a...1n a German company as a bookkeeper\nin Warsaw, as a Christian girl. She was blonde, thin, short nose. Very Aryan-looking.\nUnfortunately, they told me later that my little brother wrote her a letter that my father is\ngoing with another woman or sounding like that, and they told me she returned. She was\njealous or whatever. So now I'm in Izbica. In the morning, I go out to my Izbica, I'm back in\nmy town. Go out and the first guy I see is a good acquaintance of my family from the...the\ncoop...cooperative [spo _dzielczo or landszo __(ph)] and I say, \"Oh, hello. How are you?\"\nAnd he looks at me, \"You dirty Jew. You are still here?\" I can't believe it. I met another one\ngood. He said, \"Oh, your time will come soon.\" And I feel it's not my Izbica anymore.\nMaybe it never was. So I go around into houses. There were 200 Jews and they live about 10\nJews to one room in a little area. There was a tannery where most Jews lived. And...uh..I felt\nsomething happens. Something will happen and I want to go to the Partisans.\nSo I go to the Partisans. They told me, \"You can't go without a gun.\" They wouldn't take\nyou without a weapon. So I went to buy weapons. I don't have money. But I have a friend.\nHzick (ph) And I tell him, \"Listen. Let's buy a gun.\" He didn't have money either. So I\ntold my father, \"Listen, I don't want to sleep in this room. There's too many people. I want to\nsleep in the attic. Could you give me a blanket? And could you give me a coat, a winter\ncoat?\" He said, \"Okay.\" So I took it and sold it. I still didn't have enough for a gun.\n(Laughing) So finally [zick, Izick _ (ph) | did have the money, bought a gun and he\nhide it. He hid it in the...in the straw, in a place over there in the tannery. In the tannery was a\nhorse who did work in this...this...1n this towel I hid the gun. One day...but I was so in love\nwith the gun that many times I kept it in my pocket. Once I go with my...once there was a\nrumor that the Germans asked how many Jews are in Izbica. And that time my father was the\nJudenrat, the head of the Judenrat. The 200 Jews, were three people in Judenrat...my father\nwas...another one was Blanck and Kornfeld. So I did know immediately. So I remember\nwalking with my father to a Polish lady...was in Kovin, and I still remember the road, and I\nsaid to my father...that...they asked for the Jews. \"Isn't that something dangerous?\" He said,\n\"God knows...knows.\" I said, \"Dad, Let's buy a gun.\" He says, \"No. You can't buy a gun.\" I\nsaid, \"Dad, I have a gun already. In fact in my pocket.\" And he looked and he could see\nthis...uh...outline and he said, \"Be careful. Be careful. Don't...uh...we could get killed.\" But\nthe way he said tt, I've seen that is really the tragedy. Another time...maybe a half a year ago,\nhe would say, \"Tom, hide it. Throw it away.\" He didn't say this anymore. He let me keep it.\nHe just says, \"Be careful.\" The gun didn't help...help me anyway because when the time did\ncome, I remember I heard a big shot, jumped from the attic down. I hurt my back. Until now,\nit's hurting me. Did run to the hiding place. As I said, Izbica was in a valley. A lot of houses\nwere built in the hills so one wall was actually a built in the...1n in the hill. So one wall of this\ntannery was built in in the hill, so what we have done, we moved a panel and digged a very\nbig cave for about a lot of people. And was so nicely done nobody did notice this entrance\nand we hid over there. We heard the Germans coming in, looking. They went out. They can't\nfind us. We so happy. Next we hear again coming. Polish voices. \"No, they must be here!\nThey must be here! They are here!\" And the Germans start look again. And these...the\nPolish helpers start to help them, rip out the...the panels. And I still remember being over\nthere sweating. It was hot. And while they were pulling the panel, flashes of daylight did\ncome in in this cave. And the panel was like a spring. It didn't want to give in, like she would\nlike to save us. Unfortunately, crack! The panel went up, and they told us to go out. I\nremember I went out and I had only one shoe. And I was asking the German if I could go\nback to this...uh...to pick up another shoe. He allowed me to do it, and now they took us\noutside.\nAnd outside was many Jews already con... congregated and they surrounded by a few\nUkrainians there. But by being covered I managed...I actually managed to sneak out from\nthis...from this circle group, and I went outside and I had the knowledge that I cannot go\nout...I can't go outside from the town because on top of the hills is a ring with soldiers.\nIzbica's surrounded. I had a notion that I must hide on the foothills where the Christians'\nhouse are. Izbica...himself...the valley was...down was only Jews, but in the foothills, where\nthey're going to the top of the hills were Christians' houses...uh...farms. So I went into a\nblacksmith's shop and he said, \"Tom, Go out. Go out. I'm afraid.\" I went out. I went up\nfarther. Look happened and I met...I met my schoolmate, Janek Knopczik. \"Janek, hide me.\nPlease.\" \"Yah, sure, of course, Toivi. Go into the barn. Fast.\" So I went to the barn. And he\nwent...and he left. Well, I got to the barn. There's a padlock. I can't go in. So I start to look\nfor a place to go in, and there's a Polish Christian woman asked...yelling, \"Tom! Over here!\nRun away! Run away!\" So I asked, \"Why shall I run away?\" \"Because he's\ncoming...coming.\"\u201d \"Who's coming?\" \"[Knopezik.\" So Knopezik will come. He will open\nthe...the...the padlock. And I didn't run away. And here's Knopczik coming with a Nazi.\n\"Take him. He's a Jew.\"",
        "A: So where am I.",
        "A: So he had... so he said...so he said to this Nazi, \"Take him. He's a Jew.\" So I said, \"Janek!\nYou're mistaken! He's joking.\" \"No, he's a Jew.\" So, and the Nazi said, \"Come.\" So Janek\nKnopczik also said, \"So, okay, I will see you in a shelf in a soap store.\" Because there were\nrumors they are make soap from...from Jews. So his goodbye was: \"I will see you in a shelf\nin a soap store.\" Okay, and I left and to make it short, I can't tell you more because there's\nstill some going on; but finally, I find myself with the rest of the Jews on the marketplace\nsurrounded by the Nazis. There was a woman I remember. While we were sitting on the\nmarketplace, on the cobblestones, there was a woman crying and running from one\nUkrainian to another one. \"I am not a Jew. I am not a Jew. I am not guilty. Please, I'm a\nChristian lady. I'm not a Jew. Is I'm not guilty at all.\" And they let her out. She was a\nmistake. They grabbed her, too. So she was not guilty being a Jew. I remember my school\nteacher, Steidel (ph). Very fine Pole. He...he was there, the head of the school. I remember\nwhile I was sitting on the cobblestones, I remember him walking...uh...uh...on the sidewalk,\nand he didn't want to look at us. And I felt...I still don't know why, this a little thing. So many\nother things to remember and I remember him. I remember his face. I remember he was\nfeeling for us. When another Pole did stare at us. Talking ...he did walk by like we didn't\nexist, and his head turned away. And I remember this picture. And I remember it was a\nbeautiful April day, April 28, and I was sure I will die. Finally, two trucks arrived. They told\nus to step in. We went in the trucks. The trucks were covered with canvas. It was dark inside,\nand the trucks started eastward and now there's hope. Maybe, it's not so evil because in the\nroad from Izbica, there's two concentration camp. There's Trawniki [NB: labor camp for\nJews, subcamp of Lublin]. There's Zawada [NB: labor camp for Jews] . We passed the\nturn off to Zawada and our hope is down. People are praying. They passed the turn off to\nTrawniki, and now we know in front of us is Sobibor, and we know what Sobibor is. And\nsome people...and everything is in the dark...uh....uh... in the truck. It's dark. And I hear\nvoices, \"Let fight. We will die anyway.\" I know the voices. \"No, we will die anyway. Let's\ndie together with the families.\" But they mood is that we will...when we stop, we will throw\nourselves on the Nazis. Finally, the truck stopped.\nAnd I remember still a voice. Somebody cut the... remember still while driving... my...\nmy...1n fact, my father's face...he was sweating terrible. I remember wiping my father's...wet\nforehead. It's wasn't completely dark. It was still...from the front some light coming. And I\nremember the voice, and finally the truck stopped....stopped and I hear a voice. Somebody\ncut open the canvas and noticed...looked outside that and said, \"Ist schwarz von Ukrainen.\"\n\"It's black from Ukrainians.\" Now this meant Ukrainians...the Nazis...they walked\nwith...because they walked with nothing...they had black uniforms. When he said, \"It's\nblack,\" he meant it was so many of them. It's no use. And he told us to go down. And we go\ndown and really, there were many Nazis. We were surrounded very tight with machine guns\nand everything. Probably the Nazis did...had experience. They did know that this a crucial\ntime when people coming and seeing there in front of Sobibor. So we stood up. We get out\nand we stood in front of the gate. What did I see? I see a big fence camouflaged by pine\nbranches, braided in...in the barbed wires, and a gate. On top of the gate a big sign, black and\nwhite, \"SS Sonderkommando.\" \"Sonderkommando\" meant special command. The gate\nopened. We go in. They told us to go in. I go in, and I can't believe it. I...my dreams and my\nnightmares...what I had about Sobibor...I imagined Sobibor's a Hell. Belzec's a Hell. Sobibor\na Hell. It looked like a Hell. And how's a Hell? I have it from my...my aunt's\ndescript...descriptions. Dark, and people running around with tar and with whatever. It's\nmiserable. What did I see? A beautiful, little place. Lawns, beautiful flowers. A nice train\nstation. Nice little houses. \"Schwalbennest\" was the title of one house. It means...uh...uh...\n\"Schwalbennest\" [Translation: \"Swallows'Nest]...uh...how is it in English? Anyway,\nand...uh...they told us to stop; and I think, \"This can't be a death camp. How could such a\nplace be a death camp?\" Birds are whistling. Nice trees. I still will remember the shape of\nthe...of the sky...of the...uh....(pause) Oh, what is in the sky?",
        "A: The clouds! And I didn't want to die. But I've seen the fire. From...there was far away,\nfarther, there was a...where they burned the people. I've seen the fire from behind...was again\na fence camouflaged. And I could feel the smell. And I thought and strange enough, I wasn't\nafraid of dying. I was afraid of being burned. And...uh...suddenly a voice, \"Men right,\nwoman, children should go left.\" And then I was always now with my mother when we\nwent down from the...from the truck. And that age when you are 15, you could pretend to be\na...a child or you could be a man already. But instinctively I felt it's better to be with men, so\nI kissed my mother goodbye. I said a few foolish words. [I still regret it, trying to figure out\nwhy did I say it?] It's still bothering me. I will tell you. I said, \"And you didn't want....you\ndidn't let me drink the milk yesterday.\" And she said, \"That what you have to say in that\nminute?\" And this is bothering my whole life. Why is it...? You see a day before, we had a\nlittle wooden... uh... box with ice, and the milk was over there. So I opened...I was first\nopened, I start to drink the milk. And my mother opened the door from the room. She said,\n\"Leave it for tomorrow. Don't drink everything.\" And...and now I...1in this moment, I did\ncome back to it and said such a foolish thing which is still bothering me, and left to mine\nfather and mine little brother left to my mother. We did cross each other. (Sigh) (Long\nPause) (sigh) Now (sigh) the German...when everybody went to their way, the German\nFrenzel [NB: Oberscharfthrer Karl Frenzel], with who I after the war I had a interview. He\ntold the woman and children go the direction of this fire. He left. And now he start to ask the\nmen who's a carpenter. Who's a mechanic? And I was no mechanic. What could a 15 year\nold boy be? But I did want to live so much. And wherever the Nazi moved, my eyes went\nafter him. And I really believe...(quavering) I really believe that...uh...my strong...I believe\nthat people could be influenced, that something is between people, some interaction. You\ndon't need to say it. And I felt that actually I influenced the German. When he was moving\nback and forth and our eyes met and my strong will said, \"Please take me inside.\" He\nstopped, looked at me, and said, \"Come out.\"...the Ukrainer. I should come out. And I still\nbelieve this was my strong will. I... something was which emitted from me to him. I still\nreally truly believe. And...uh...he told me to go out. My father did want to go out. He beat\nhim, and later when he assembled about 40 people, he told the rest to go in the same way that\nwoman and they left. In this way I started to work in Sobibor. Now Sobibor story.\nWhen they made a film, \"Escape from Sobibor,\" and I was a consultant, I was accused even\nby people knowing the history of the Holocaust ... even in Poland by Poles...I wonder how\nshould survive in ___ Auschwitz. A Buchenwald survivor told me, \"What a horrible film. A\ntypical horrible film. Look, the prisoners are going with the woman. Take a look how they\nlook like. We know how prisoner in a concentration camp did look like. Skinny, emaci... uh..\nworn out. Take a look there here how they look. It's...it's not a true picture of a...a Nazi\ncamp.\" Unfortunately, it was. There's a difference between a concentration camp and\nextermination camp. I don't want to go in anymore. No.",
        "A: Yah.",
        "A: Yah. That...that what I want to tell you. So I remember I lay down. It was...in the barracks,\nthere was a fellow called Josel (ph). He did come write down my name, everybody's name,\nand told me to pick a place to sleep. From...all the...the three lines are free for you. I didn't\nknow that the day before they killed 72 Dutch Jews because they did try... supposedly try to\nescape. So I immediately picked on the third floor right in the corner far away from the door.\nAnd ...uh...soon as I put away...I had a little bit in the hand which I took from the home....I\ndon't know what I had...a piece of bread or whatever, I put it away in my place. I did lay\ndown for a minute. Later I did go out to the yard. And I didn't know what it was, but my\nwhole feelings about my family, I just lost them... they were probably burning in that time. I\ndidn't think. I didn't think at all. I didn't think about mine parents or myself, later; about my\nfamily until the end I was in Sobibor. Maybe this was from the nature some kind of shield,\nbut I didn't. Must admit. I didn't see anybody cry in Sobibor either. It was a different...people\nchanged, with ___ changed. Everything changed. Go out. Try to look. They have singing.\nSobibor, singing. Happy songs. Gate opens, and there're groups of people marching in.\nYoung people. Good dressed. Then again in front of them, I find out later it was a Kapo--a\nman dressed better with a big whip--and he commanded \"Abteilung, Halt!\" which means\n\"stop.\" Everything was in military fashion, and later they dispersed. While looking around I\nhear a voice, \"Totvi.\"\nTurn around and this was [Jussik Bressler (ph)| from Ko_o, my friend, who was caught a\nyear earlier. Now I have a friend. He was taken out as a dentist, not here but last Aktion from\nIzbica when they took. It was...uh...half a year earlier. And I go with him and he tells me\nabout Sobibor and later, we go behind the tailors' shop and there's a group of Jews playing\ntheir harmonica and playing the fiddle. And I'm shocked I hear music. \"How could you play\nhere in this place? Take a look at the fire.\" They said, \"Tom, we are dead anyway. You\nknow how they...they call...the Germans are calling us here? '[Nassersecker (ph)].\"\n\"[Nassersecker (ph)]\"--\"bed bugs.\" \"You're only a bed bug. And...uh...we will be dead\nanyway so you will get used to it, you see? Fires burning, you don't cry even now. You see,\nyour parents are burning over there.\" Yah. Different people. You wouldn't wonder. Some of\nthe first day maybe. And I didn't wonder later what I was seeing...the...it was couples, even\nSobibor, uh... girls and men connecting. As a matter fact, one...one couple lives here not far\nfrom Washington...survived both together. And...uh... this way I started to work. This...uh...\nThe same night in the morning, about 2 o'clock I hear a whistle. \"Everybody out. Everybody\nout.\" I go out with another people from the barrack because they're yelling...the kapos with\nwhips. They're chasing out, we go out. It's a night. Stars. The moon, ____ night. And I hear\nsomething, '\"Friseurs, here!\" '\"Friseurs\" means like barbers [Translation: \"Hairdressers\" ].\nAnd the...as a group they call themselves \"Friseurs.\" And later they call a group\n\"Gepackentragers\" [Translation: '\"Porters'|. The kapo called. I see another group goes to\nanother place, assembles. The kapo looks at me. \"Go to the Gepackentragers,\" because I\ndidn't know where I should go. So I go to the Gepackentragers, the people carrying luggage\nback. They called them \"Gepackentragers\" in German. And now...and the rest...well went\nback to the barracks. Well, later they led us...they led the barbers, the Friseurs so-called,\nsomeplace else and my group is led to a big, huge barrack with two gates, entrance gate and\nan exit gate. The gates are open and while we're waiting inside with other boys. I was told to\ncall in Dutch where the handbags should be left. And here people start to come in. Very well\ndressed. There was...uh...uh....uh...a transport from Holland. And they didn't know where\nthey are coming. They did come in passenger trains, and no idea. And they left the big\nluggage on the train station, being sure that they will be delivered. And now the handbags.\nBut here I notice some kind...that they had a strange feeling, because a woman...what does a\nwoman have in her handbag? Most precious things. She hate to part, and now they tell her to\npart with this. But there was a German immediately. She resisted, she was beaten. And one\nperson said...have seen she was beaten, volunteered to give up the handbags and they led\nthem out to the exit gate, and later they went to a yard where they were told to undress.\nAnd we...our group was still waiting in this barrack, even when the people went through. But\nfive minutes later, the Nazi calls us to the yard where the people undressed. Were undressed,\nbut now there's no people; but heaps of clothing. They told us...the Nazi tell us to...told us to\npick up the clothing and take it to the storeroom. So I picked up the clothing, took it to the\nstoreroom. It was a special storeroom. And now another transport, another group is coming\n..another 500 people. So I must run again to the first barrack. Take the handbags, and later\nagain to this. And later when the whole transport went through, the SS Frenzel told...took a\nfew of us...need to, \"Now, come with me.\" He led us about five meters from the gas\nchambers. It was a barrack where woman were coming in to cut the hair. He...he did give us\nthose scissors to help another one to finish up cutting the hair. I didn't know how...first of all,\nI never seen a woman nude. I was...even that situation, I was very ashamed. I didn't want to\nlook. I looked down, but I did get once a whipped so I picked up my head and took the...the\nshears and he told me I don't need to cut close. Just...uh...uh...If I have somebody has a\npigtail, cut the pigtails off. And there they was suspicious because the Germans told them,\nwhen they undressed before the Germans told them that they are going for a sanitary reasons\nto a barber to...to..., but...uh...some suspicion. But still they didn't think they were killed. As a\nmatter of fact, I am sure when they were in the gas chambers they didn't believe it. When the\nfirst gas did come in, probably they didn't...under...understood what's happened to them.\nAfter I finished cutting the hair, they told us to go out, and...uh...while I was still on the way\nback to my...to ...to the camp, the barracks, I heard already the motor, the gas motor working\nwith a high.... You know, at that time, the gas motor...they screamed. They started...they\nstarted very loud like \"Ahhhh....,\" even louder than the motor. They had a big motor there.\nLater about 15 minutes down...down and until quiet was. This was Sobibor.\nI was working over there for 6 months. I could...I could tell the story of...uh... one ... one\nescape and another one. It will drag on too long. Because while over there, I...I survived a\nexecution. Two people escaped and the barbed wires were cut, and the kapos immediately\nnotified the Germans and the Germans did come and Frenzel made immediately a roll call\nand he picked up every 10[th] person to be executed. So this was story. I could go on, so let's\nstop here. I went through this. Later a group working so-called \"Wald\"...\"Waldkommando,\"\nworking outside the camp cutting wood for the pyre, for the cremation. They escaped. They\nmade a revolt. And...uh...later...uh...they caught a lot of them. They brought them back, and I\nwas witnessing their execution. Things like that which I could talk a whole day and night.\nBut I will go now to the revolt. Or a little bit about myself. Being in Sobibor, I always did\nwant to escape. And I...for...for some strange reason, I always felt I will survive. I had\nalways something in me that I will survive. But I was looking. Once they did need people to\ngo to W_odawa to take apart some bakeries. They did need fireproof bricks. So the...the\nGermans asked for volunteers. Who wants to go? So I did go. Thinking that maybe in\nW_odawa I will be able to run away. But W_odawa was a situation that even the fellow\nprisoners did...did watch me because they did know if I escape or anybody else escape, they\nwould be killed. So one watched another one. We weren't able...but what's happened over\nthere...there were about 150 Jewish girls working in the ghetto, sorting some stuff. You\ncould see them from far away. And while working, when we were able to get closer to them,\nwe showed them that we are hiding money for them. So we...we have done it for about week,\nleaving money in the ruins of the ghetto to help the...the W_odawa girls. Nevertheless, most\nof them were later brought to Sobibor. This didn't help. Later was the...the\nbarrack...Waldkommander thought maybe I could work over there. In the beginning, it was\nvery nice because I had a method. I noticed that the Germans like clean people. They like\npeople going straight fast. The moment you see a run..rundown Jews, broken-down Jew,\nthey killing him. So always I kept myself clean. I put even my pants under me when I slept.\nThey should be ironed with my body, straight. I didn't need to do this too because clothing, I\ncould go any day change shoes or shirts or... because I was working sorting, and so on and so\non. But I always looked a open area. So I did go to work for the Waldkommando.\nThe foreman...the Kapo, was a good acquaintance of mine, and I asked him and he said,\n\"Okay. You could come me.\" We cut the wood. Later, ...uh...they're building a road over\nthere. And the German noticed me, Dachsler (ph), old German. And he said, \"Listen,\nKleiner, take a...take this group of people and go cut straight trees because we need it for the\nroad to put on top.\" So I had a group of people and...uh...and this was a good place to work\nbecause this German didn't beat. So anyway, going farther...so my way of surviving was stay\naway from the German. If you sleep in the barrack, take a...a...a...a...place far away from the\nentrance door, right in the corner, on the top floor even if you need to crawl...to...to it's\ndifficult to get up, do it. Keep yourself clean. Keep yourself straight. You see a German, go\nsomewhere. And...uh...and...uh... a lot of miracles. And this way I was existing Sobibor.\nUh...What also it was, I made a deal with a guy who sorted luggage. Because you sort\nluggage, you could make labyrinths. And I was sorting food. So I told him, \"Listen, I bring\nyou some food. You let me rest in your labyrinth to eat.\" So I was ...uh...taking a few canned\nfood to him, and I was eating; and later he was happy and I was happy because I was always\ntired and sleepy. Over there was a chance. I will skip little stories like this, but why I\nmention about this guy because he will come up again. Once in the middle of the night, my\nfriend shaking, \"Tom. Listen. Listen. What's happened?\" What's happened, he...he had a big\nbarrack. And the one part was...uh...uh...sectioned off for the kapos. And the door was open,\nand I heard some talking inside, so I did get up. I've seen something is going on, and I did go\nto my friend in the [bank (ph)] kommando. And I go to him, and it was dark in the barrack\nbecause what I know in which bunk he 1s, and I tell him, \"Listen, Shmufel], Hear what's\ngoing on? Something...something 1s happening here.\" So instead to answer me, he hit me in\nmy face with a...with something...some kind of metal, I know. So I thought \"If he knows and\nhe doesn't care, it's okay.\" So the next day there were rumors that the Kapos did plan to\nescape, but more people find out and they did...uh...want to go too. Anyway, I told you. But\nagain, by working...in that time I used to sort clothing...uh...I've seen the whole Kapos, a\nwhole group of kapos being taken to the crematorium. So I was wondering what's happened?\nBut again, a little bit later, I see this Berliner, the guy who used to...uh...the Lager, he used\nto sort luggage, has the uniform of the head Kapo, and did become the head Kapo and it was\nobvious that he did betray the action. But to make it short again, we killed him later. Before\nwe made the revolt. He was...uh...killed by...uh... prisoners.",
        "A: Okay. Now, the situation was, of course, we were sure we will die. When...uh...even if\nthe...the war would stop right now and then the concentration camp could be free, we will be\nkilled. So this was a terrible feeling, there's no way out for us. Everybody did want to escape.\nI think that whatever I was thinking to run away always, everybody had in his mind.\nAlthough some people were resigned. They were Orthodox Jews, which nevertheless, even\nwith this terrible situation did pray. I remember Yom Kippur. And they did fast, and they did\nsay all the prayers and...uh...they were very observant Jews, and they still had their trust in\nGod and their tradition everything else. Now, there always was...I wouldn't say\norganization...there were a few people, influenced people in Sobibor...respected people. It\nwas a Hazzan, I remember. I don't remember his name. And was Leon Feldhandler. His\nfather was a Rabbi and he was...actually he was a member of the Judenrat in Zolkiewka, in\nthis town. And there were some talks...talks about the revolt. I was close to Feldhandler\nbecause he was a friend of my father in Izbica. He was in Izbica ghetto. He was taken to\nSobibor from Izbica ghetto in the time when I escaped to...to Stryy, and they caught me in\njail. But 1t wasn't until a transport from the Soviet Union arrived. When the Eastern Front\nwas coming nearer, the Germans eliminated the ghettos, Minsk and so on. And that time they\ntook all the Jews from Minsk, and from Lida and they brought them to Sobibor. I mean not\nall of them. A lot were killed on the spot, but a lot of...some transports come to Sobibor. And\nin that...1n this particular transport they included quite a few Jewish prisoners of war. Soviet\nprisoners of war, Jewish. Because they recognized as a Jew. In that time we had a lot of work\nand the Germans picked up another 80 people to help us from this particular transport from\nMinsk. Unfortunately, for them they picked up a few former POWS trained in the art of\nfighting. Former soldiers. And they picked up a man called Pechersky. He was a officer in\nthe Soviet Army, and ...to work with us.\nPretty soon, Leon Feldhandler recognized this potential material and he contacted, Leon\nFeldhandler, and Leon Feldhandler contacted Sasha Pechersky and...uh...again, I don't want\nto dwell much on it, they formed a organization. From that time on some concrete things\nhappened. I find out about a week before about the revolt. Uh... That time I was working as a\nFeuermann. How did I come to be...to get this job? Feuermann is like firemeister...master.\nAll the documents, heaps of documents, passports, pictures, books, soiled clothing was\nburned. While they were burning it, when I was sorting, I put the papers in a big blanket.\nLater with the blanket was still full, I put it on my shoulder and take it to the fire. Taking it to\nthe fire, I started to get familiar with the guy working over there. Did bring him some food.\nAnd slowly by slowly, I start to helping him; and later, when they built a bigger oven, I was\nworking over there as a steady personnel. My idea was to work in a...to be enclosed, out of\nthe view from the Germans. I could see them. They can't see me. From the window, I was\nable to see. But once I wasn't able and there was a terrible beating. But anyway, so...they\nplanned to kill a German in my place. So this way...but I did need to be contacted.\nOtherwise, I would...some stranger comes into this place, I would chase him out, being\nafraid myself. So he calls me in the evening and tells me, \"Toivi, I must tell you something. I\nknow you. I know your father. I will tell you something, but keep your mouth shut. We need\nyour place to kill a German.\" I was shocked. Later, I find out about what's happened. And I\nwas informed on the purpose. I...I understood that something is going on, and I was informed\nabout Sasha. Especially I was a guy...I was a guy in Sobibor which always did run around.\nYou know, I didn't keep in a place. I was always hyper and would just run. I did want to\nknow everything like I would be...go out and I'd write book, which I've done, actually.\n(laughing) I was always a very...boy who...I want to know everything. So in this way I did\nbecome, I was involved in it.\nSo I know the first plan was...there were different plans. The first plan was to dig a tunnel\nfrom the blacksmith shop through the barbed wires to outside. But when they analyzed it, it's\ndid come out that we need to work many, many days, nights to dispose of this very\ndangerous dispose of the soil. They need to find a way. And when...let's assume everything\nis okay. Six hundred people should go through the tunnel single file without quarrel will take\na whole night. Isn't practical. They threw it away. The next one was to poison...to kill all the\nNazis while they're in bed, because there was a group of young kids like me, they called\n\"putzers,\u201d which each morning 4 o'clock they're allowed to go out from the barrack to go to\nthe Germans and while they are in the bed, clean their shoes, clean their belts and so on. This\ntime to smuggle in instead a such a young boy should go a little bit older, at night and kill in\nbed and get their weapons. But they did...they discon...they disregarded because they\ndidn't...they weren't able to depend on young people doing such an important job. Anyway, a\nplan was accepted...the final plan, to kill all the Germans in a matter of one hour, between\nfour and five. We based our success on the German punctuality...punctuality. Discipline.\nAnd the plan was that the heads of the workshops because besides the people working in\nconjunction of the extermination, there were workshops. Tailors, shoemakers working for\nthe Germans only, because there was...so much... they had a labor force. Why not? So they\nestablished a few small workshops for themselves. And always a German have\nsomething...made something for himself, a uniform or shoes; or the...heads of the shop\nshould make appointments with the Germans to come on that particular day, October 13, for\nappointments between 4 and 5 o'clock. And over there there would be some people which\nwill... which will kill them. So I know about this plan. And this should happen between 4\nand 5, and the whole lager should look normal. We should not...we should not use the\nweapons which we get when we kill Germans so not to...before the time.\nI remember I was in that time waiting and mine fire place...1n mine place...where I burned\n...where the oven was. I pushed all these papers against the window so nobody should be\nable to look in because in, because in the sides when did people did bring me documents,\npapers, we threw 1n in the sides, and the the oven was in the middle, and I just later burn it.\nSo anyway was a window so I blocked the window and was waiting. And..uh...now I see a\ngroup...uh ... because they were divided. The organization had about six fighting groups of\nthree people and located in different places in the camp waiting for the Germans to be lured\nover there. So I see the group 1s supposed to come to mine place coming to my direction, to\nmy oven, but they're passing me. They're going in a different way. So I was panicky, but\npretty soon a Jew called....from 6d_, Sender, comes to me and said, \"Tom, they decide not\nto do anything to your place because the guard...the tower guard was very close.\" I was very\nclose to the fence and he could notice a German comes in, doesn't go out and could be\nsuspicious. \"We rather...we'll kill him in the men's storeroom.\" Then he told me to go over\nthere, and over there my job in that time was to stay guard on the...on the gate\nleading...connecting Lager | and Lager 2, because also we was connected...was divided in so-\ncalled four lagers, like 1, 2, 3 and 4. In Lager 1 were the building where they used to sleep\nand these workshop. Lager 2 we sorted, and Lager 3 we did burn, and Lager 4, we were\nbuilding something over there. So anyway I was suppose to stay guard and because this gate\nwas very close to the storeroom I just seen them both coming in. He was called in..1n to try\non a leather jacket, because it exactly his size. And he did go in and suspected nothing.\nWhile he put his hands in this...now this I haven't seen. This...the moment he was killed, he\ndid come out...the guy which I know and he told me that while he was coming tn, the Jewish\nprisoner said, \"Achtung!\" immediately. \"Attention.\" And start attention, took this leather\njacket and he immediately...he hold it for him and while he put in the hands in the leather\njacket, his arms very immobilized like....like in a straight jacket, and he was killed with an ax\nand we had a first gun. I was scared up to that point. I remember when he was killed and the\nguy who killed him did come out. He's a little bit blood on his shoe. He patted his pocket like\nto say, the gun is here. I...my whole ...[ wasn't scared any more. I did want only to know\nwhat will happen to me a half an hour later. That I did want to know. And I...I...I did know\nthere's no way back. This 1s it. They killed...as long as we didn't kill the German, everything\ncould be.... And later they called Beckman, and Beckman I remember he went to...to the\ndoor over the barrack and like whatever feeling he did turn around and went back and they\nkilled him anyway in the office.\nAnd to make a long story...and I...and I at that point, I remember there was a little train, like\na miners train, for the miners. Little wagons with a little electric engine. And the German\nwho was the head of this little train which connected all the Lagers with Lager 3, was\nalready killed. But inside I notice there's canned food. So a few cans, put into my pocket.\nAnd I remember I had friend, Linda Karoten (ph), Linda ____.. And she said, \"Tom, you're\npreparing like for a picnic.\" And I said, \"If we will survive we will need it.\" And later\n[...[...] eat. I ran in the forest. I reminded him this, that he said I'm preparing like a picnic\nbecause we used it later. We're so hungry and I had it. Anyway, now I remember the\nforeman was a French Jew...Jacov Dunietz [NB: Joseph Dunietz], and the foreman from the\ngroup did come to me, \"Tom, maybe you have some money?\" Because many times when I\ndid burn in my oven the soiled clothing...when the clothing was burned or books, some\nmoney did come through in the ashes. And when I cleaned the ashes, I find some gold\nalways. It did lose the luster, but it was not.... So...uh...he did know I could have it, so I did\ngive him some money. And the Germans were killed. Nobody did know. I was wondering\nthat...this was like normal. First of all the Kapos...the Kapos which were...there were two\nKapos in the organization...and they were instructed to use the whip to beat us like everyday.\nAnd they have done it. And I remember like every day, singing. We went back to Lager 1\nfor...uh...supper. And now the biggest shock. And this was I think was the...the most\nimportant ingredients of the success was so few people did know. There were...we were\nabout 600 people. And this was the time before the roll call when we stand in line in front of\nthe kitchen to eat. Believe it or not, practically the whole camp was still like every day\nstanding in the line. Maybe about 50 people were missing, the people which did know. But\nsoon one told another one, \"Listen, forget about supper. Something is going on. Let us grab\nan ax. Grab anything and be prepared.\" Now the dangerous moment did come because up\n'til now...the...the Germans were free to go and come. Each German has a place to watch.\nThe sorters, where clothing was sorted, there was a German standing. But he was allowed to\ngo for a cup of coffee or whatever he want. And another German ...let say...from the shoe\nsorters, the place they sorted shoes, did come by and he didn't notice the German who's\nsuppose to be by sorting clothing. He wasn't suspicious. He thought, \"Oh, maybe my friend\nwent for a cup of coffee.\" But now, 5:30. Well, the...the time did come close when all the\nGermans supposed to be in this place, Lager Ein, to...they witnessed the roll call. And now if\na German is missing, they will look each other. So we did know that the crucial time is\ncoming and... uh...uh...the line in front of the kitchen start to...to dwindle and I remember a\nshot and I remember Sasha Pechersky jumping on a table. And why I...now...a one Kapo\nwhistled a whistle, like for a...like for a roll call. Normal. And made it a little bit earlier. The\noriginal plan was actually to march...",
        "A: Yah. The original plan was to march out to the front gate, but we heard a shot and the plan\nwas disregarded to march out to the front gate because probably the...the guard wouldn't\nknow what's happened and we could go too close, very close maybe to them also. But I\nheard a shot, Sasha jumping on the table and he start to talk, \"Listen.\" Something in this\nsense. \"Listen to me.\" I remember only one sentence from the whole talk. It was very short.\n\"The time did come that we will take revenge. We killed practical all the Germans. Now let's\nstood up and fight our way out.\" In this sense...but the sentence I remember exactly what he\nsaid was: \"If someone, if you will survive, he should remember to told...to tell the world the\nstory of Sobibor.\" And that what I did never forget, and that what I am doing. And\nsuddenly...I don't know if this was arranged, prearranged or not, but while he was still\ntalking somebody yelled, \"Hoorah!\" from the people standing. And another one picked up,\n\"Hoorah!\"; and the third one, and suddenly everybody, \"Hoorah, Hoorah,\" and start to run. I\ndidn't want to carry an ax, so I picked up a knife. I prepared a knife from before. It was easy\nto hide a knife. Was a knife somebody probably from some...somebody brought us...to\nSobibor maybe a rabbi or so...or so, because had pearl handles and the on..on the handle was\nwritten Kusheshov Paisach (ph) [NB: Kosher for Pesach]. It's some kind traditional knife.\nWas big, so I took it. My knife in the hand and start to run with it and biggest group to the\ngate leading up to Lager I, and over there I remember one Ukrainian did come by\naccident...did start to drive in with his bike, and he was thrown immediately from his bike,\nand I remember the bell was cut immediately with the gun. And while running through I\nknow...I remember and on the left side, a Ukrainian guard with his rifle standing like\nthat...like a...like a fixiated and just turning around himself. He could use the rifle and shot,\nbut he was handling it like a stick, like somebody hold...hold a can...cane, and just turning\naround. He didn't...he didn't know what to do. And I was running to go with the people to the\nfront gate and half way I heard some whistles...shot was all the time, but I heard whistles like\nfrom bullets whistling and I noticed and I, on the left side behind a barrack 1s a German with\na machine gun shotting at us. And here two my friend fall down, another one third. And I\nstarted to back up. I did run back. While everybody was running...running to the front, I did\nrun back. And...uh... some way I find my way to a little gate in a hallway for the guards,\nbecause between the fences guards were walking, this time empty. Probably I went into that\ngate. Luckily, I had behind myself...I left one barbed wire fence and another barbed wire\nfence. Now I had only one barbed wire fence in minds. Come to the fence, the last fence...the\nfreedom is, only the fence. I can't go through because I had a knife. If I had a ax I would cut\na hole. Instead, I don't know what to do.\nAnd here close me was Sasha Pechersky and Shlomo Szmajzner [NB: Stanislaw Szmajzner;\nsurname also spelled Symyzner]. Now, Shlomo Szmajzner had a rifle, and I remember\nwhat...this a minute later. And Sasha was with a knife only. And sudden, and suddenly a man\nappeared with a...with a ax and start to cut. He made a hole in...1n the fence. Now...but more\nand more people come and they don't wait in the line when machine guns are shotting at us\nto go through the hole. They start to climb on top of the fence. In that time exactly when I\nwas halfway going through the hole, the fence collapsed from the heaviness of the...of\nthe...from the weight of the people which actually I thought that time...and it was over me,\nand that time I thought this is the end of me. But actually, this saved me. Because the first\nfew went through I could see why the people is depending on me. The mines exploding and\nbodies flowing there. And finally when...when everybody when through at least at that part\nof the fence and I can't go out...from ...from the fence because the barbed wire did go in in\nthe clothing. So I left my coat. By the way, I had a leather coat from...I took it the last minute\nfrom the storeroom. It was also maybe lucky because the...the barbed wire wasn't able to go\nin too deep to the...my shirt or whatever. Anyway, I just slid out from under my coat and\nstart to run. I fall down a couple of times. I thought I'm shot and I wasn't. I start to run until I\nreached the forest. Now, I'll really speed up. Come to the forest. We are wandering about the\nday, the next day we come to a point and we undert...I already understood that it's not good to\nrun there. We are about 50 people. The next day we met another 30 people. So, and I've seen\nthat we are too many and must...something must be done. But...uh...we still kept together\nuntil one...until early in the morning. I remember we stopped out of the forest and Sasha said\nthat we must go out to check where we are, and they need money. So whoever had the\nmoney to give money to buy food. And all the men with rifles did left. Nine people with\nweapons left. We were against it. We understood that something is wrong. Only Shlomo\nSzmajzner was left, only because the rest of us surrounded him that we must have a guy with\na rifle left. And he promised he will come back. He did never come back. I talked with him\nlater after the war. Or maybe I shouldn't go into this. He said when I met him that this was\nhis soldier duty to go back to...to the army. Anyway.\nSo when he left there was real tragedies because groups start to form. The weak people did\nwant to go with the strong ones. And it was unforgettable...unforgettable scenes, which I\nwon't even to go in it. Finally, I took two boys and we left. Shmuel Wycen [NB: Samuel\nWeitzen]|, who used to work with me as a fireman, and his friend, Kostman, Fredrick. We\neluded the guards. We eluded the...the Germans and we made it to mine hometown, Izbica.\nOver there, I thought I have a Polish friend who was a good friend of my family who will\nhide us. The two boys didn't want to go into the town. They were in the forest. But I left to\nthe town in the evening, hoping that nobody will recognize me. It was sort of dark. I come to\nthe Polish lady. She didn't want to hide me. So I left back and told the guys, \"Listen, it's no\nway. We must look for another place. But you know what? Let go first eat. We're hungry.\nCome.\" Not far, we have seen light from a little farm. And we go to this farm. We were\nafraid to go in the villages. But these were farms..were little farms...little houses ... uh...single\nhouses. So we were not as...not as scared so much. We went into this little house, little farm,\nwe have seen from the forest. We come. There's light. We go into the kitchen. There's food\non the table, but no people. We call...I call, \"Farmer, Farmer.\" In Polish: \"Dzier_awca.\"\nNobody answered. Finally, we go back to this room and start to eat. We go back out again\nand finally, I see a little boy. We asked him, \"Listen. Come here. Where your father?\" And\nhe comes. He recognized we are Jews. And he said, \"Oh, my father and mother are scared.\nThey thought you are...you are bandits. And they're robbing so much here.\" So he called the\nparents. The parents did come down with his sister. I recognized his sister. I used to go to\nschool with mine... with...with me. And the atmosphere start to get warm, and later I told\nhim, \"Listen, Mr. Bojarski, what would you take to hide us? You are far away from the\ntown. Close to the forest. No neighbors. We will pay you good. And I have a house. After\nthe war, I will give you this house we have in Izbica.\" \"I will think about it. Go back to the\nforest.\" To make it short, in a couple of days he agreed to hide me.\nWe did put in so much gold and diamonds, and he was excited. His wife took a ring. His\ndaughter, earrings. \"Take it. Keep it. Fine.\" He built a hiding place in the barn. In the corner\nin the barn, he put in a table, covered it with a lot of straw. From outside, you had a panel\nwhich he opened to give us food. (Sigh) Okay. We were...I will skip also my adventures in\nthis hiding place and the way I did try to go out because I recognize it's late. And I will go to\na point where once in the nighttime, we hear some...the dog barking. People screaming.\nFinally, we heard people coming in in the barn and yelling to him, \"Tell me, where do you\nhave the Jews?\" Show me the Jews.\" And he...we recognized the voice of the farmer,\n\"There's no Jews here. No, there're no Jews.\" \"Yes, we know there're Jews.\" \"No, there're\nno.\" \"So tell me...where do you have...so nice, from where do you have so nice clothing?\nYou go to church nicely dressed, and your wife....\". Well, I understood. We were so happy\nthat he didn't drink. Because a lot of Poles are drinking. He didn't. But what he has done, he\nHoved nice] clothing always. Shoes for his sons, pants, sweaters; so this was noticible. So\nanyway, and they start to look for us in the straw. They didn't find us and they left. After they\nleft he did come in in the hiding place. \"You see what's happened? What would happen,\" he\nsaid, \"he did discover you? They would kill you. They would kill me. And the worse is\nthat...what a shame would be to my family when they...they did find out that we're hiding\nJews.\" Now I...I didn't have formal education, as I said, but I did read a lot. And he had a big\ncross on..on his chest and asked him, \"Mr. Bojarski, why are you ashamed? Why...why\nshould your family...should family be ashamed? You know Jesus Christ was a Jew.\" For\nhim it was the biggest insult. To accuse Jesus Christ of being a Jew! And probably when I\ntold him...on top of it, I told him the picture, \"Last Supper,\" he has in the kitchen: All 12\napostles are Jews. And the...1t was that a insult to him that I accused the apostles being\nJewish. Anyway, he went out mad. Couple of days later he comes, \"Guys, I have for you\nguys a hiding place. Because I find out that the Germans will search for Jews in any farm\nwhich 1s close to the forest. So only for 3 days I made another hiding place.\" And one\nevening, he did come. He told us to go out. And I expected hiding place if he's so afraid he\nwill do it, he will make it some place far away from him in the forest, I mean. But he made it\nright out behind the barn. It was already suspicious, but I still didn't suspect.\nWe didn't remember he.... When I went behind the barn, I noticed ...uh...a little carriage with\ntwo wheels. Two wheel carriage. No? Like a platform with two handles. On top of it was a\nbig millstone, a stone we'd make flour with it, in the old type mills they have grinding stones.\nAnyway, a big stone. I didn't know it. It was standing.... Later, I connected it. Now, he\npicked me up here by mine waist and pushed me in that hole, and later he pushed 1n another\none and later we did ask him for a kerosene lamp which he did give us. Put in...have the\nkerosene and looking. We're were in a hole about a meter and a half, a square meter and a\nhalf. The roof was...I've seen it from inside, a 2 by 4 long and across were pine branches and\nsome straw. The opening was a round opening maybe a square foot, a foot round or maybe a\nlittle bit more. We barely squeezed in. Was now pushed in straw on it. And so on. We are\nsitting inside and later we hear and that they're pushing something hard and something\nfall...very heavy on top of the hiding place. And what's happened, the 2 by 4 break down like\na letter V. So we said, \"Oh, God. Is broken down. Must go to him and tell him that\neverything is breaking...is breaking down. So we tried to push out the straw. Kostman was\nactually over there pushing out the straw. He said, \"I can't push out the straw.\" Now the\nlamp start to flicker...flicker, flicker and goes down. And what is interesting. I didn't feel\nshortage oxygen, but the lamp didn't want to burn anymore. I put in a match, start again to\nburn for a second, and out. Later, even the match didn't want to start and I start to feel, you\nknow, [not] enough air. And all the time the third one--Wycen, Shmuel--was holding with\nhis arm the 2 by 4, it shouldn't break down. He was supporting it. So (clearing throat)\nFredrich was, so Wycen screamed, \"Pull down the straw!\" So we pulled down, still no fresh\nair. He said, \"Something is blocking the entrance.\" Finally, we hear something sliding\nand...and this breath of fresh air comes in. And he opened it. And now we are going out.",
        "A: Okay. He did try to kill 1t. He didn't make it. He did give us...still we didn't believe it really.\nWe did go to the old place. And one...it didn't take much, but three days later, he did come\nwith helpers. Shot at us. Shot at my two friends. Shot at me. I pretended to be dead. Later\nwhen he took the...our clothing, and saying, \"Now we will check the Jewish clothing for\nmoney,\" when they went to the house, I did get up and run away. After I run away, I was in\nthe forest for awhile. Later, but he was...he didn't know I'm alive and if I'm alive he'll be in\ntrouble. Later and so he always watched us. I was always a step in front of him. And finally I\ndid run away in a different area where a few Poles did...did know my father, as a\nPolish...what would I say? Patriot...and helped me into...go into a Polish partisan\norganization called \"Bataliony Chlopskie,\" peasants battalions. And I worked over there as a\ncourier until the end of the war. This the whole story.",
        "A: You're welcome. How long did we talk?",
        "A: Good. I did good.\n"
