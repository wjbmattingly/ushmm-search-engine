        "A: Good afternoon.",
        "Q: Could you first tell us something about yourself, where you grew up?",
        "A: Well, I was born in Warsaw to a well- to- do family on November 3, 1924 and I was brought up\nat home. We had a villa in Shaborov which was about 20 minutes train ride from Warsaw in the\ncountry where I would spend the summers. Later on I went to a Hebrew academy in Warsaw\nand went through my grade school there, and had my Bar Mitzvah in Warsaw in the great\nsynagogue and remember playing in the parks and doing the things that kids do. I had two\nbrothers. My younger brother was named Syzmon. He was born in 1928, 27, excuse me, and\nwas roughly three years younger than me and I had another brother Meir who was born when I\nwas already nine years old, in 1934. I remember his birthday in particular because it just so\nhappens that my grandmother's sister and her husband and their young daughter, about my age,\ncame for a visit to Warsaw from America and it was a big event in our lives to see the\nAmericans visiting us. So despite the language barrier between us kids; because they could\nspeak Yiddish, you know, the grandparents could speak Yiddish and my parents could speak, it\nwas something of a sensation in our home to see, you know we were not used yet to see kids\nthat were not disciplined, sort of dominate the attention of the whole household. And after\ngraduating what you would call elementary school in Warsaw, I was admitted to gymnasium,\nwhich is high school and went there for one year. But about that time, the clouds of war began\nto gather and my father thought of sending me to agricultural school. I guess the reasoning\nbehind that decision was the fact, well there were several considerations. One, that I was not\ndoing so greatly in gymnasium.",
        "Q: You weren't the greatest student in the family.",
        "A: Except for history which I took genuine interest. I didn't show great promise at that time. I\ndon't know in what order of urgency these considerations came but there was the consideration\nthat Poland, they came and for the Jews and my father already at that time, I think\nAustria was already next to Germany, and Czechoslovakia was next in the frying pan and\nblackmailed by Hitler at the time, you know the whole incident with Sudetenland and so forth,\nthat served as a pretext for German aggression there. At any rate, my father felt that\nimmigration became imperative for us and he felt that someone with a farming background\nwould have a greater chance of being admitted to a foreign country than a merchant or\nprofessional. I don't know just how true that was but farmers were always readily admitted to\ncountries like South America and Canada. Canada was then considered unpopulated and my\nfather mentioned Canada as one of the possibilities of our immigration. So the decision was\nmade that I should become a farmer or at least I should learn farming and I was sent to that\nschool in a place called Wajenuswolinsky {ph 55} about 350 kilometers southeast of Warsaw\nand I began my education in farming there.",
        "Q: All of 1938?",
        "A: This was the summer of 1938 because I arrived there just in time for harvest which was the\nworst period from the standpoint of work, the fact that we had to work nothing like we consider\nwork today, from sunrise to sunset. But once the harvest was over, then we began class work.\nAs the season neared winter, work was progressively reduced and class work increased. And\nthat\u2019s the way it went. But of course, I never graduated from school because the war broke out.",
        "Q: Which work did you like or dislike the most, the schoolwork or the physical labor in the fields?",
        "A: Well, I was not too much enamored by the work in the field but I did like work with the\nanimals, with horses and cows and other animals we had there on the farm. I found it very\ninteresting and I became a very good student there, too, so that school had from a standpoint of\nmy upbringing and maturing, had a very favorable effect on my attitude towards learning and\nmany other things. So much so far that I surprised my parents when they saw my school report.",
        "Q: Were there other Jewish students at this school?",
        "A: There were only Jewish students at this school. This school was under the auspices of an\norganization called Tarbot which I think is Hebrew name for culture and the principle objective\nthere was to train Jews in agriculture so they can immigrate to Palestine and become farmers.\nThis was also a consideration even though my father when he mentioned Canada as a possible\nplace for our immigration, he considered Palestine as well but unfortunately, the British then\nhad a policy of, a restricted policy of immigration to Palestine and it is a strange thing that when\nwe mention today Palestine, today Palestine has a completely different connotation. In WW II.\nThe Palestine brigade that fought with the British 8\" Army, consisted of Jews alone from\nPalestine, from Israel as it became. Now the connotation conjures visions of intifada and\nmayhem and gang of cutthroats, you know that are",
        "Q: Anti-Jewish in a word.",
        "A: Anti-Jewish. Right.",
        "Q: So this was a school that was affiliated with the Zionists?",
        "A: Zionist orientated. It was, you might say it was soft on religion, aspect of it, but the religious\nlife in the school was accented to a certain degree and all the holidays were observed and so\nforth. I remember that we did not work in the fields on a Sunday, besides Saturday, also not on\nSunday in order not to offend the Christian peasants 1n the area, to respect because it was their\nday of rest. So we were only working internally on the grounds, on the grounds proper.",
        "Q: Were there any Socialistic aspects in the school?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: So it was more religious?",
        "A: It was mainly Zionist oriented and graduate students went to Palestine after finishing this\nschool. In fact, there was a reunion of survivors of that school in Israel in 1966, 1967 I think\nand I happened to be there for the Bar Mitzvah of my second son, Matthew and we found out\nthat there were about half a dozen survivors, all of them living in Israel except me, so they made\nit. They joked around and they said \u201c Topas remained the only Zionist among us\u201d. Because I\nwas living in America and they were there and they served in the Israeli army, one of them\nachieved a very high rank in the army. And only one of the fellows that graduated the farming\nschool remained a farmer.",
        "Q: Did you dream of going to Palestine during that year you were at the school?",
        "A: Yes. I had my sites set for Palestine. It was something very attractive to us, to be in a land that\nhistorically we take our roots from and for a couple of millennium there was a continuous\nhistory of the Jewish people and since we are persona non grata in Poland, in most of the\ncountries of the world in general, then Palestine loomed very largely in our consideration.",
        "Q: Were there any other reasons why you ended up going to this particular school, do you recall\nwhat it was like to be Jewish and to go to public schools for higher education at the time?",
        "A: I have never been exposed to, I have been only once in public school for a very brief period,\none year that my mother sent me to public school. I don\u2019t remember the circumstances. But\nother than that, I was always going, for instance, the primary school that I went to, the prep\nschool so to speak was a Hebrew academy, one of the most modern of it\u2019s kind and had a\nreligious orientation. Modern. Then I went to gymnasium henu which the Hebrew word\ndenotes upbringing, you know. Then I went to this Tarbot School and I think the reason they\nsent me there was they wanted me to be in a traditionally Jewish environment.",
        "Q: How would you describe the religious life with your family when you were growing up?",
        "A: Well the religious life with the family is really interesting in itself. To that extent that my\ngrandparents were assimilated on my father\u2019s side, not my mother\u2019s side. But since the\ngrandparents on my mother\u2019s side lived in a distance away from us in Forst we didn\u2019t have\nmuch contact with them. But in Warsaw, we virtually lived with our grandparents. We were\nliving in the same apartment building. My grandparents were assimilated; they did not observe\nthe Jewish holidays according to the law, meaning our stores were open on Saturday; although\nholidays like Passover and others were observed, they were observed to the extent they didn\u2019t\ninterfere with business. And my father was a very strong opponent of assimilation himself and\nhe sort of fashioned himself or fancied himself as a Polish patriot. So in 1920 during the\nBolshevik invasion, he joined the Polish militia at the age of 16, probably not telling exactly the\ntruth about his age. He was so bent to have a part of it you know in defense of Warsaw. But as\nhe matured, he was exposed to the anti-Semitism that the assimilation did not make a damn bit\nof difference to the anti-Semites. All the Jews are the same. So he was a thinking individual.\nOne of his pastimes, his contemporaries told me was going to courts and listening to trials\nbecause he liked the idea of logic expressed and the questions of law, questions of morality,\nquestions of right and wrong, very interested, good and evil. So eventually, eventually, he\nbecame aware that, or he came to the conclusion, that assimilation for the Jews as a means of\nacceptance in a non-Jewish society was a failure and he felt 1t was a bankrupt. Although many\npeople at the time majority disagreed with him and he was a maverick in his belief. So at time\nalready when I had reached the age of 7, he became religious.",
        "Q: So by the time you were seven he had concluded that assimilation was",
        "A: He might have concluded earlier but this was when he had made the move. And our house\nbecame kosher and so forth. Because in my childhood we had a Christmas tree and we were\nwell-to-do so it was fashionable at that time to hire German governesses because they were so\nclean and disciplined and so forth and I remember kneeling and clasping my hands to say a\nprayer in German. This was in Warsaw. But this radically has changed. For my father became\nreligious and began to realize that the values that are contained in our tradition now, Torah and\nour bible, are the values that are endurable, they are tested and that society, it is to benefit not\nonly to the Jews but to mankind to live by a law when morality is supreme, not other things.",
        "Q: Did you notice this when you were seven? This must have come as a major change.",
        "A: It was a major change. In fact, I remember exactly the time when my father made me aware\nthat Iam a Jew. Because I was sheltered you know in my life in Warsaw and in schools and I\nwas not exposed to the, I never found myself in a situation where I was exposed to anti-\nSemitism nor did I understand what it really meant. We lived in Poland so I was Polish. That\u2019s\nthe way I understood it. But one time when we were in our country in the summer, I might\nhave been then seven, that I recall that towards evening my father called me to the bedroom and\nhe told me to sit down. I want to talk to you and he told me very briefly that we are Jewish and\nthat we were enslaved in Egypt because this is the core of our belief and of the historical,\nfactual tenets of our belief and that we were taken out of Egypt to become a free people., to\nbecome a people to be a light to the nations. He said a few things that were just beyond me\nperhaps but then I came to learn this and I was taken out of the school I was going to and I was\nsent to a more religious oriented school. And we underwent a revolution and somewhere we\nwere alienated from our larger family circle because of my father\u2019s change.",
        "Q: Your youngest brother then, he would have grown up from day one in a very religious\nhousehold.",
        "A: You are very observant. That is exactly what happened. When I gave you the names, I told you\nthat my name was Yusick because I was born in the era when my father was in the mood of\ngiving Polish names and my brother\u2019s name was given originally in Stanislav although his\nHebrew name that was given at his circumcision was Szymon just as mine was Benjamin Josef\nfor Joseph Benjamin. But when my third brother was born, it was already in the era when my\nfather\u2019s orientation was completely changed, the name that was given to him was Meir, after my\ngrandfather\u2019s father. He was brought in completely different atmosphere from birth.",
        "Q: Would you describe your father as a strict father?",
        "A: I think that I would have to say yes, as a strict father. Although he could have been quite\nrelaxed, you know, and forgiving on occasions, but he was strict. He believed that the key word\nwe have to focus our attention is righteousness. To him, this is all and all -- to be right, to be\nmoral, to be truthful. He felt that our civilization as we know it stands or falls with our ability\nto comprehend that. That this is significant. Of course, today, this is all turned upside down by\nthe new social science engineering which says everything goes and everybody can have his own\nstyle and so forth.",
        "Q: How would you describe your mother?",
        "A: My mother came from a religious home but she was somewhat of a rebel. Perhaps not\nconsciously so but it was simply a question of economics. She was born as one of four sisters\nto a family where the head of the household, meaning her father, my grandfather, Hersh Aram,\nwas a hat maker. And he was a working person and he was also Talmudist, studist. When he\nwas not working he was spending his time in a house of study, in a religious house of study.\nNow, she did not see any, this is by conjecture, she didn\u2019t see future in following this tradition.\nBecause they didn\u2019t have big dowries. At that time, dowries had to be given with daughters to\nanybody who was worth his weight in salt.",
        "Q: And you had a grandfather with four daughters.",
        "A: Yeah, four daughters and she was the second in lineage. Three of the four daughters went into\nthe professions because they have seen they have to establish some economic independence.\nThere was just no future for them in the town. Excuse me, in the town. It is still a town. It is\nnow even more significant. I guess Poland calls it the capital of petro chemicals in Poland.\nAnd I revisited the town when I was there in 1989 and I found the apartment where my\ngrandparents lived and possibly where they brought up these four daughters. Now, this, in the\nUnited States would be way below poverty level because the whole apartment consisted of one\nroom and a kitchen and six people lived there. It is just hard to believe. And I remember\nvisiting there on Passover and my father would take us there and they were always\nimmaculately clean. Everything was so perfect -- they didn\u2019t have running water. They didn\u2019t\nhave a bathroom, no plumbing there. It was just a bewilderment when we first came to visit.\nMy father already became religious at that time because before, we didn\u2019t go there. And it was\ncontrast of two worlds that were completely, you know, there was the cosmopolitan Warsaw\nwith floors that were polished to a mirror shine with two maids in my grandma\u2019s home and\nplumbing and a bidet in the bathroom and all the conveniences and amenities of modern living.\nWhereas in Proust, it was backwards, only by contrast and they had to live there very frugally.\nSo my mother must have realized early in her life that her future lie with her ability to support\nherself and to make something of herself, other than just being a woman and going through the\nbiological process. Her older sister Franya, you\u2019 ll find out in my book, they\u2019re in furniture,\nyou'll find out that she had two boys and she was married to a painting contractor but she\nherself was a teacher. My mother was going for law but she married a wealthy husband, a well-\nto-do husband, a merchant, a businessman and Idacha the younger sister became a CPA, you\nknow a public accountant. I don\u2019t know if she was certified, 1f such a thing.",
        "Q: A notary?",
        "A: She was definitely a notary and she was also a bookkeeper. And the youngest one was with the\nfamily. I don\u2019t think she went in to a profession; she remained at home and never married.\nThey all perished in the Holocaust, except my grandfather who died a few years before the war.\nThe youngest daughter\u2019s name was Razel. So this was the background. When my mother came\nto Warsaw, she in the university in the school of law. In other words, you must\nrealize that I believe that only 5 or 3% of the Jews could be admitted to any state institution.\nShe had first to get through high school, an eight year course. As she said in her own\napplication here the document that I obtained from the archives, she says on her basis of her\nentry examination she was admitted to the state\u2019s gymnasium. She covered a course of 8+\ncourse in 7 or 8 years, perhaps in 7 years. And then she was admitted to University of Warsaw.\nBefore, they had this clause about bench clause and father restrictions but there were still\nrestrictions about how many Jews could be admitted. And she had two handicaps -- being\nJewish and being a woman.",
        "Q: And being from a small town, by Warsaw standards.",
        "A: By Warsaw standards. So in order to support herself, one of the jobs she had was a tutor to the\nTopas boys. So she was a tutor to my father and his brother Itzak and his youngest brother\nwhich was my uncle Ben. And this is how people fell in love with the tutor.",
        "Q: Not everyone has such a beautiful tutor.\nA; Well, the results were predictable.",
        "Q: Your father was smitten.",
        "A: He must have been. And he married very young. My mother at the time was 23 and he was 19\nwhen they married.",
        "Q: Did your grandparents have any say in this matter? It must have not been the planned marriage\nof their dreams.",
        "A: Indeed, it was not. As I understand it in retrospect, they were very much opposed to it, because\nin Europe it was not like in the United States where you have misalliances between rich and\npoor and between professional and non-professional. There was a class-consciousness, even\namong Jews so that it was unlikely that a person from a well-to-do family would marry\nsomeone from a very poor family by contrast. And my grandparents were opposing too on the\nground that the fact that they wanted someone from a more prestigious family than some\nobscure town in Poland and they didn\u2019t like the idea that my mother was older than he. Four\nyears older. They didn\u2019t like that. But apparently they were overruled.",
        "Q: By your father?",
        "A: Probably by my father. He wanted to have his way. My mother was never very happy living in\nsuch close proximity to my father\u2019s family because she realized the objection and she realized\nshe was married over these objections.",
        "Q: Interesting. How about your father\u2019s brothers?",
        "A: My father\u2019s brothers were not affected by this religious revolution and my uncle Neteck which\nwas the second in line was a very handsome bachelor as you can see from the existing\nphotographs, who was a bachelor for a long time and didn\u2019t get married until probably maybe a\nyear or two before the outbreak of WWII and his position in the company was that he had the\njob of administrator of the properties that my grandparents possessed, owned, and he was also\nthe head bookkeeper in the company that fabricated shoes, Topaz Shoe Company. But I have\nvery fond memories of my uncle the bachelor. Bachelors have money. Married people have\nresponsibilities and bills. And he lived with the grandparents. So my brother Szymon and I and\nmy cousin Lela, which was the daughter of my father\u2019s sister Bella Necovyak who lived with\nthem there, we would come on Sunday morning when my dear uncle Neteck was still sleeping\nin his room from the Saturday night outing trying to recover, we would be waiting for him to\nwake up sort of helping the process and then we would mooch from him movie money for the\nmatinee to go and see the movie. And we would scan the daily paper to tell him what are the\nchoices and he would open one eye and say are you here already. And he knew to buy his peace\nhe had top give us some movie money and then we would ask him for transportation for the\nstreetcars. Sometimes he would say, \u201cIt\u2019s such a beautiful day, why don\u2019t you go to the park?\u2019\n\u201cWhy do you always have to go to the movie?\u201d That is one of my fond memories that he was\nvery generous that way. I also remember that he bought me my first two -wheeler. My parents\nprobably couldn\u2019t afford it, even though they were well off but they had expenses.",
        "Q: And kids.",
        "A: And kids. That means the same.",
        "Q: Now I remember that your brother, from your description, he had to have been a hell of a nice\nguy. I don\u2019t know whether he was a great student.",
        "A: Who is that?",
        "Q: Your uncle.",
        "A: Neteck? I don\u2019t think that he distinguished himself particularly. He graduated high school. He\nmight have taken a course in bookkeeping and administration, I don\u2019t know exactly. But the\none who distinguished himself scholastically was the youngest son, Benack. He was\ndistinguished in many sports too, that\u2019s why we remember him. The newspaper clippings\nwould tell us about his prowess as a soccer player on a team called Hapoyal which was one of\nthe first line teams in Warsaw. It was a Jewish team. Hapoyal means the worker. That didn\u2019t\nsit well with my grandparents who first of all were opposed to any socialist ideas and my\ngrandmother thought it was a sheer waste of time to be engaged in sports of any kind and incur\nan injury or something like this and I understand he incurred an injury and he had blood\ninfection. But I remember that when he graduated high school and I was still then very young,\nhe didn\u2019t want to go or perhaps he couldn\u2019t get admission although he was a very good student,\nto the University of Warsaw and he wanted to go for chemical engineering. So he went to the\nPolytechnic in Prague in Czechoslovakia, and became an excellent chemist in his field. He\nsurvived the war and when he came to America he couldn\u2019t get any employment. But\neventually he got a job with Dutch copper and later on with Merck Pharmaceuticals when he\ndistinguished himself in silicone research and made some pittance for them and later on became\na director of research and went to Marshall Rectify in Los Angeles and he told me one time that\nthe rectifier that weighs about a ton made by General Electric was made by him that weighs as\nmuch as a book of matches.",
        "Q: We were talking about your uncle Benack, the chemical engineer. You were saying that he went\nto Czechoslovakia to study.",
        "A: In the German Polytechnic there.",
        "Q: In the 1930\u2019s?",
        "A: In the 1930\u2019s, yes.",
        "Q: Just before the Nazis came to Czechoslovakia?",
        "\\A: He graduated before the Sudenland, before the occupation. He must have graduated around\ncirca 1937.",
        "Q: What was he planning to do? When he finished graduating, what would he have done in\nPoland?",
        "A: Well, in fact he did graduate and he got a job with a sub clinical lab in Poland so he was\ngainfully employed as a chemical engineer.",
        "Q: In Warsaw\u2019?",
        "A: In Warsaw.\nQ; And what were you hoping to become: I remember you were interested in history and also you\nhad an inclination toward animal husbandry after that first experience at the college in\nsoutheastern Poland. What was on your mind to be?",
        "A: Well, once I got my feet wet in this agricultural school that my parents sent me, I really became\nfired with enthusiasm for being a farmer. I thought it was a great life, I thought it was a\nmeaningful life because being close to the soil, you are close to nature and it 1s a very healthy\nlife and since there is some ideological being associated with it because of Jews, basically we\nare a nation of farmers and freeholders. If you study ancient history, you\u2019ll find out that in it\u2019s\nclassical period, the kingdom of David and the kingdom of Solomon when the fortunes of the\nJews were at it\u2019s highest peak, most people were farmers. There were some , but\nthey didn\u2019t have a class of merchants. In fact in Israel, when they spoke of merchants, they\nspoke of Canaanites. The Canaanite merchants, they used to come to temple grounds and sell\ntrinkets or whatever it was. I am told there was a slogan, a motto that was displayed at the main\nroad leading to the school buildings as you would approach the field because we had a 50 acre\nfarm there and the name was, said in Hebrew . That means for us to return to the\nplow as we have moved from the plow to the scale, meaning to merchants. Because the Jews\nwere forced in medieval times and even in earlier times in exile, they forced out of so many\navenues of life, they couldn\u2019t own land, so they wound up as businessmen. So the stereotype of\na Jew as a businessman which emerged in Europe was not the true echoes of the Jewish people\nas it was then. At the time of Moses, that came not out of propensity of the people for that\nparticular subject but because of necessity. So I felt that we are going to turn the clock of\nhistory and we will straighten this out and we will become farmers again. Idealistic I was fired\nwith enthusiasm, not on a single argument, but on all these that I have mentioned by others but\nthat I cannot think of now.",
        "Q: So this reversal of medieval, social engineering so to speak.",
        "A: Yeah, medieval, social engineering.",
        "Q: I remember earlier you described the family reunion. The relatives from America and the\ndifferences in the way in which children behaved and also the language. What were the\nlanguages used in your family?",
        "A: Well, my grandparents spoke to them in Yiddish because this was the language that was always\nused as a back up language. Also used so that we wouldn\u2019t understand it -- they wanted to say\nsomething to each other. My parents were also fluent in Yiddish so that I think this 1s the\nlanguage they used. They might have reverted to Polish because, still, my grandmother\u2019s sister\nand her husband came from Poland. They emigrated only after World War I there. They still\nremembered the language so they could speak Polish but their daughter, Jean, was a very\nbeautiful girl -- she was actually my brother\u2019s age. I remember they went for a walk in Warsaw.\nThey got lost and finally we got a call from the police station that they found them in the park.\nThey were lost and they came to the police station. Someone from the adults took a taxi and\nbrought them back. She couldn\u2019t speak Polish but she knew a little Yiddish that she picked up\nfrom her parents and we just didn\u2019t know -- we communicated by body language.",
        "Q: Which languages did you normally speak?",
        "A: Polish.",
        "Q: Polish. I imagine you studied Hebrew?",
        "A: Hebrew, yes, yes.",
        "Q: I remember a little bit of German earlier on. Did you study German too?",
        "A: I took German as my -- there was a choice given in gymnasium, usually in Poland. It was either\nFrench or German. There was a choice. That\u2019s besides Hebrew and, of course, besides Polish.\nSometimes they would give you an option of English. We didn\u2019t have this option. But I learned\nEnglish anyway through a tutor.",
        "Q: So your household, would you describe it as being a Polish- speaking household?",
        "A: Basically it was a Polish- speaking household.",
        "Q: That didn\u2019t change your father underwent his ?\nA; This didn\u2019t change.",
        "Q: Now, your uncles that we mentioned. They did not experience the same religious conversion\nthat your father did:",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: They continued to participate in the assimilated culture?",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: We\u2019 ve mentioned the shoe store. Perhaps we should describe how the store was founded and by\nwhom? I know the name of the store was The I. Jacob Topas Store.",
        "A: Right. But I think the founders of the whole Topas Enterprises were actually my grandfather,\nJacob Topas and my grandmother Etta Sara Topas. It\u2019s hard for me to determine after such a\nlong time something that I was not private to, just exactly who had greater share in the\ndynamics of the expansion of this. But it started from a very modest beginning. Because after\nmarriage, my grandmother tried to develop the talent that my grandfather possessed. He was a\nperson who modeled ladies\u2019 shoes. He had a flair for this so she exploited him to the extent that\nshe wanted to set up a store that would manufacture handmade, custom-made shoes that would\nhave his imprint on it, his model. I think this is the way it originated. First, I think that they\nhad a place on Pyskas Street but by the time I was born they already had a flourishing store in\nWarsaw, in the same building where we had also an apartment. Later on they opened two more\nstores in Warsaw, one on Noves and one on Mar which was the main\nthoroughfare of Warsaw. But eventually, towards the time close before the outbreak of war,\nonly the main store remained functional. Because they found out that they don\u2019t need three\nstores in Warsaw, that people will come to this store. Because it was unique, because of the\nhand-made shoes. This shoe store catered to the intelligentsia and to the theater circles; people\nwho could pay a good price for a good pair of shoes. They were not inexpensive. Then we also\nopened a store in Katovitz before the outbreak of the war. My father ran that for a while but the\nPolish government forced him out by saying that they are not going to allow anybody to set up a\nstore who was not a citizen as of 1920 or something like this. Some restrictive measure that\nwere calculated against Jews, So we had to liquidate that store also about six months before the\noutbreak of the war.",
        "Q: That\u2019s interesting. So the anti-Semitism of the Polish government was --?",
        "A: Was also economic.",
        "Q: Economic, yes. And of course, there was no Polish state before 1918, 1919?",
        "A: I really don\u2019t know what they used as a cutoff date as to who 1s allowed to have a store or not to\nhave a store. Because initially we had representation there, someone that had stores of shoes\nalready and was just buying our shoes because there was a demand for them. The demand was\nso great that we decided, I mean my parents and grandparents, decided that perhaps they should\nopen a store there where they can also benefit from these sales to a greater extent than\nwholesaling it. So they went ahead and did it. But this didn\u2019t sit well probably with the\nmerchants -- shoe merchants in the city and they put pressure on the officialdom to out stop us.",
        "Q: Were there any other changes regarding your father\u2019s companies\u2019 business situation? I know\nthere were other laws being introduced in the late thirties at this time regarding Jews. Did you\nknow of any ---?",
        "A: There is one event in the history of our business that I only know second hand from my uncle.\nHe was closer to the center of action there than to know it. He claimed that the Polish\ngovernment had a war debt. I think probably 1920\u20141919, 1920, war with Russian Soviet\nUnion. That the Jews were disproportionately, very heavily assessed to pay this. He told me\nthat my grandfather, in the course of several years, had to pay something which would be in\nAmerican pre-dollar value, a quarter of a million dollars but in Polish currency was close to a\nmillion zlotys which was a unit of Polish currency was defined. The ratio between one was like\nfive zloty to a dollar.",
        "Q: Was there any chance that perhaps one of the stores was liquidated in order to help to pay this\noff?",
        "A: This is quite conceivable. It might have been because I know that some real estate was sold in\norder to meet that --- those demands. Because my grandparents owned land in the country\nwhere we had our villa. (End of Side A, Tape 1)\nI was mentioning the properties which my grandparents owned. They also, as I understand, had\na building in Berlin. This dates to the time that Poland was occupied; the occupation of Poland.\nThey also had an apartment house in Danzig. But by the time I was born, all these properties\nwere liquidated or sold, possibly to meet the demands of the Polish government. You know, the\nassessment as to how much of the debt is taxable to us. Poland had a peculiar labor law. It\npermitted occupation strike which meant -- in actual experience this is what happened. Our\nshoes were hand made. Most of the shoemakers which were employees were kind of the\ncottage-industry type meaning one who was the master craftsman employed journeymen and\nhelpers, apprentices in his own household. He would come to our office and get the materials\nand the models and so forth and he would bring the ready-made products and was paid for it.\nHe was paid in advance and he was paid when he finished it. If there were some corrections to\nbe made, he would have to do that too. So they were individual shoemakers, perhaps a hundred\nor so that were making the shoes for our company. Now they became members of a union. I\nremember distinctly that a few years before the war, there was a strike but they called it in\nPoland an occupation strike, which meant that they were permitted to come into the stores and\noccupy the seats that normally are reserved for the customers. Bur the strike provided that they\nhad to leave enough seats so that business can continue. Because I cannot conceive of a\ncustomer feeling comfortable in a store where there is a hostile strike.",
        "Q: A labor conflict?",
        "A: Conflict, right. So I recall that strike and I remember an incident there that was largely\ndiscussed and talked about later. That one of the strikers, a heavy big guy, not only did he sit on\nthe chairs but he stretched himself across several chairs to occupy. My father took him and\nforcibly threw him out the store. But the thing that struck me later is that I don\u2019t recall that any\nof the non-Jewish firms were ever affected by such a strike. This strike was eventually resolved\nand everything then returned to normal, but it was one of those things that the Jews were not the\nfirst-class citizens in Poland.",
        "Q: Even if they were well off?",
        "A: Even if they were well off, I would imagine. Because a Jew always has to prove himself as a\ncitizen. For instance, when the threat of war loomed against Poland and the Jews wanted to\nshow their loyalty, especially against Germany so there is in a book called Image Before My\nEyes by Lucien Dobritsky, there is a photograph of a Jew donating actually a military aircraft to\nthe Polish air force as a show of patriotism. But it didn\u2019t help.",
        "Q: As if anyone could have suspected or expected Jews to be in favor of Germany in such a war.",
        "A: But they said -- the Polish parliament, which was only debating since the death of Puchentsky,\nwas only debating I should say since 1935, was only debating the Jewish problem and attributed\nall the economic reverses or problems to the Jewish question of being a large majority there.\nAlthough the largest majority were really Ukrainians, minority I mean.",
        "Q: Minorities, yes.",
        "A: Were Ukrainians. But this was most of -- the Jews disturbed them.",
        "Q: So the Jewish problem was the greater one than the German problem?",
        "A: Because they made it so. This was what was debated. When a Jewish member of their\nparliament, their Same as they called it, came out and he said that we should confront; we\nshould unite and should confront a common enemy; so the response was that these are two\nseparate questions. That the Jewish question and the German question have nothing to do with\nthe Jewish problem. That\u2019s the way -- that was the answer",
        "Q: The workers, the people who made the shoes, were they non-Jewish or Jewish?",
        "A: Non-Jewish. In that -- shoemakers were all non-Jews. Now there are people which are doing\nthe tops and they were mostly Jewish because this is something that trade that falls within the\nsphere of Jewish interest for some reason or another.",
        "Q: The customers would be of all faiths?",
        "A: Yes, very heavily Christian. Because the product was known and you still can find people\ntoday that are of my age who live in Warsaw; they all remember the shoe store in Warsaw.\nBecause it was a known firm, it was a known name.",
        "Q: Now, 1938, which was the last year you were in Warsaw before the war; that was also the year\nwhen the Germans were expelling Polish Jews back to Poland. Do you have any recollection of\nany of that? Did you witness any?",
        "A: Yes, we seen people with bundles that were sometimes seen on the street. My father would\npoint out to me and say these are refugees from Germany. Also we seen photographs in the\nnewspaper, pictures in the newspaper of the rioting. The stories that were behind them; where\nthey were stripped of German citizenship and the Polish government declared quickly that they\nstripped them also of the Polish citizenship. So they were people without citizenship; it was\nvery sad; it was a foretaste of things to come to an unimaginable proportion and degree.",
        "Q: Earlier we were talking about patriotism, the Polish patriotism of your father. I recall when we\nwere looking at the photographs, that you mentioned other family members who were involved\nin various patriotic efforts; either when Poland was just becoming independent. I\u2019m referring to\nthe war against the Soviet Union in 1920. Then I remember too, there 1s someone who is in the\nRussian army at the time of the Russo-Japanese War?",
        "A: Yes. Poland, as you know, was occupied and didn\u2019t regain its independence until 1918 and\nprior to this, it was partitioned and occupied by three major powers which was Germany,\nAustrian-Hungarian empire and Russia. Warsaw was mainly under the Russian influence and\nRussian zone, so to speak. The Russian government tried to -- they had a very strong intensive\nprogram of reciprocation, so the language in high schools was Russian and Russian was the\nlanguage that you had to do business in Poland, in official Poland. Also when people were\ndrafted into the army, they went to the Imperial Russian army. Now my grandfather, probably\nstill a bachelor, was drafted into the Czar\u2019s army and was sent to Manchuria during the Russo-\nJapanese war. I remember him telling me stories of how cheap life was, of how many times\nthey executed Chinese. The Russians were executing Chinese and they were frightened of the\nRussians. The Russians might have cast the fear among the Chinese; they didn\u2019t do so well\nwith the Japanese because we know that the outcome of the war was not favorable to Russia.\nBut he served with them. I don\u2019t know, I couldn\u2019t tell you just how long. I know he was with\nhis friend who became his brother-in-law later because they married two sisters when they came\nback from the war, back to Warsaw. My future grandfather, Jacob Topas married my\ngrandmother Esther Topas. So this was one experience of the military. I don\u2019t think my\ngrandfather volunteered but my father did volunteer to the militia as I mentioned before, during\nthe Bolshevik invasion and was very patriotic that way. In fact my father served in the Polish\narmy later on already because there was a conscription, also Metek served in the Polish army\nfor a short period of time. My father was a non-commissioned officer in the Polish army and\nafter serving it, probably at a time when I was born, he also had to go periodically. He was\nrecalled for maneuvers and for a few weeks of what they called exercises, military exercises.\nMy father believed that we, the Jewish people, should be loyal regardless of anti-Semitism\nregardless of the inequities that existed in the social sphere of life, the economic discrimination\n--that we still owe allegiance to the country that we live in. In that respect, there was no\nquestion about it. He was also a realist and he knew that we have to get out of Poland because\nwe are an endangered species there.",
        "Q: My recollection is that even your mother was involved -- in describing her experiences at the\nUniversity of Warsaw and then the tutoring work that she did. There was a document that you\nshowed me earlier ---.",
        "A: Yes. That document showed that after graduating high school in 1918, 1919, she, during\nvacation time, did volunteer work in what they called Polish soldier home, which is apparently,\nI would imagine it\u2019s a convalescent home for soldiers that were injured in that 1919-1920 war.\nSo she was briefly employed there or volunteered her services. She introduced that certificate\nand other certificates similar where she worked as a teacher in a school sort of to support her\napplication for law school in the Warsaw University.",
        "Q: This was in 1920 when she was helping, helping to care for the Polish soldiers?",
        "A: Soldiers, I think so.",
        "Q: Which would have been the middle of that war?",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Yet, one of your family members was considered not to be a citizen of Poland? Or not a citizen\nof Poland early enough? I remember when you were talking about your store and --.",
        "A: All right. This was not a citizen of Poland but a citizen of the city. This is kind of a\ndiscrimination, sort of compartment -- put in different compartments. You can be in this\ncompartment but you cannot be in the other compartment. What it meant is that our family\nopened a branch of our store -- I think they opened it probably in 1938 ---. After six months of\nexistence, the Polish government of the city of Kapolt ordered them out because they\nclaimed that they were not citizens of the city, or dwellers or residents of the city at some\nundetermined time which would otherwise by implication permit it. Justify them being there,\nprusterick.",
        "Q: Of course, Katavista was near the German frontier and I imagine they were more paranoid than\nusual of all the border area.",
        "A: I think that basically they couldn\u2019t possibly -- they couldn\u2019t question my father\u2019s credentials\nsince he was a reserve non-commissioned officer, volunteer in a war against Russia. It was\nsimply a question of economic discrimination.",
        "Q: Economic anti-Semitism regardless of patriotism?",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Now meanwhile you were off to the east, studying to be a farmer. I imagine you had mixed\nfeelings. You obviously liked being near animals. You wanted to be a farmer and yet you were\nfar away from home. You had left the big city and now you\u2019re in the sticks. I suppose. For\nPoland that was the sticks.",
        "A: You\u2019re going to make me say things which are in my book, really. I am firm about that but you\nare very perceptive in understanding that someone who came from a big city suddenly changes\nhis environment to a very raw surroundings 1n a sense -- that we had to haul our own water,\neven in our dormitory and we were always exposed to the elements. The creature comforts that\nour home provided were very remote there. It was not easy to get assimilated there. I\nremember from the first class -- there were maybe thirty students that started the course. By the\ntime of the fall harvest, of the potato harvest, 1t was reduced to about twenty. Because the\nothers quit, just packed up and went home because it was just too tough for them. But with me,\nit was very tough and I was always on the verge of quitting during the harvest. But I said -- I\nfelt that it was an embarrassment to come home and say that I failed. So I said, let me see if I\ncan hold out at least another week because it doesn\u2019t look good to come after the first week. So\nby several such resolutions, I extended my stay beyond the harvest time. Eventually I got to\nlike the school and I took pride in being able to work there and being knowledgeable about\ncrops and about animals and animal life. Anything that relates to this type of life interested me.\nI had a genuine interest 1n it that was developed by a very dynamic teacher and director of the\nschool, a fellow named Yachim Scholinsky who still lives in Israel. A very dynamic person\nwho made study an excitement. He put excitement in it which you don\u2019t normally find in\nclassrooms.",
        "Q: Where were you when the war broke out?",
        "A: When the war broke out, I was in that school.",
        "Q: Almost harvest time again?",
        "A: Well, it was past the harvest time because the war broke out on September 1, as you know, and\nthe harvest usually starts in the middle of June and continues up to this point. Hitler did very\nwell by waiting for the Poles to gather for him, all the harvest and put them in barns where they\ncan easily have it picked up for their own use and for the army\u2019s use, there was feeding off\nPoland,",
        "Q: Were you surprised by the outbreak of war?",
        "A: Yes, I was surprised by the reality of 1t not about what you read in the papers. Because the\nmovies and the papers, they create a different image and illusion of what things really are until\nyou are really directly affected by them. The outbreak of the war was excitement and sort of\nloss of interest for school subjects. The school authorities suspended classes and they had\ndismissed all the students to go to their respective hometowns except for the contingent from\nWarsaw. Because they said Warsaw is under bombardment and for our own safety, we will\nremain in school. Because our school, I think the war broke out on Friday morning, I think on\nSunday our buildings were already occupied by the Polish army because they were quartered\nthere.",
        "Q: In what other ways does the war affect you? School is closed, Polish army takes over the\nschool, your home is besieged by German forces --?",
        "A: Not yet, at the very beginning, but it was under heavy pressure and bombardment because\nWarsaw -- there was a mass bombing raid on Warsaw before the war was declared. This was\ndone on September 1\u201c",
        "Q: And those continued, the bombing attacks?",
        "A: Yes. Sometimes I think, I don\u2019t know if the war was declared, maybe at night or at 10 a.m. but\nit was already much later, hours already into the race where most of the Polish air force already\nwas wiped out on the airfields before they got up in the air. So they definitely were taken by\nsurprise -- those that shouldn\u2019t have been taken by surprise. We heard on the radio Friday\nmorning at breakfast time, we heard about the attack on Warsaw and about the war. Of course,\nthere were mixed emotions. There was a lot of excitement but there was also great concern.\nWhat does it mean? What does it portend? But the authorities were very reassuring. They said\nthe war will soon be over and everybody will go home. I don\u2019t know whether by this they\nmeant that Poland will win the war or there would be an armistice and the newscasters were\nvery bombastic and enthusiastic in their reports. Of course, we didn\u2019t know, we didn\u2019t have the\nidea, the ability to be critical. We had no critical ability to be able to sort of digest the essence\nand what truth is in it. You would hear -- a broadcaster would say like this : The Polish cavalry\nis fighting in East Prussia like wild lions.",
        "Q: You had never seen a wild lion before?",
        "A: But that was a kind of metaphor meaning that they are fierce fighters and also that they are --\nthe Polish army is advancing on Berlin. I mean this was like on the first or second day of the\nwar. When England and France joined the war on the third day and we could hear the English\nnational anthem and the Marseilles played over the radio, there was literally -- the newspapers\nwere hysterical. They felt that the war is going to be finished in a matter of -- 1n a short time.\nNobody really predicted any specific time but the feeling was that it was just a question of time.",
        "Q: That Poland would win?",
        "A: That Poland, together with England and France would win.",
        "Q: When did you realize that Germany would win this one?",
        "A: When they told me that -- and I was in the city of Lublin -- that the Germans would be here in\none hour. In a city and Lublin was under bombardment.",
        "Q: It\u2019s way to the east.",
        "A: It\u2019s past Warsaw, right.",
        "Q: What about the Russian invasion? Did that come as a surprise?",
        "A: It was anti-climatic but 1t came also as a surprise. Perhaps to many people it was a welcome\nsurprise because out of the two evils, many people thought that if they went to the Russian zone\n-- in the beginning it was very easy when they divide because the border was not firm -- there\nwas an influx of people both ways and they were not yet -- they didn\u2019t have yet a strict\ninstruction, how to handle the border movement across the border. So that anybody that\nthought, believed that he was better off being on the Russian occupation than German -- a lot of\npeople made that choice and then they went. They made a wise choice because they had a\ngreater chance of survival in Russia even those who were sent to Siberia. They were displaced,\nthey still had a better chance of survival because there was no deliberate effort by Stalin to\ndestroy the people, no matter what nationality.",
        "Q: Unless they were Kolaks or or bourgeois or of production.",
        "A: Or Polish officers in Katin. That\u2019s an interesting aspect of the Polish officers in Katin that many\npeople don\u2019t know about it. A lot of Jewish officers were among these Polish officers and they\nwere killed including the chief chaplain of the Polish army. The Jewish chaplain of the Polish\narmy.",
        "Q: What was your greatest priority in September 1939 as your world 1s falling around you? What\nis your --?",
        "Q: To be reunited with my family.",
        "Q: Reunited with your family in Warsaw?",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: What is happening to your family in Warsaw?",
        "A: I didn\u2019t really know what was happening to my family. I could not establish contact. I don\u2019t\nknow whether the telephone lines were still functioning in the few days of the war but I know\nthat I managed to send a telegram to my mother asking her to send me money for a ticket to go\nback to Warsaw. I don\u2019t know whether she send me the money in time or whether the\nauthorities gave us the money to buy the tickets because eventually they relented and they told\nus that we can return to Warsaw. I think there were about five or six of us that immediately\nbegan to pack and go. I remember a very interesting incident. When I was in the post office\nstanding in line to send a telegram, there was a line -- the post office also had the national\nsavings bank of Poland which was called PKO, -- that means Polish Fund\nof, Saving Fund, which was government fund and people were using savings books. So there\nwere two Polish women standing in line talking to each other and very patriotically that they\nstill have confidence in the Polish government and that they are depositing. They were\ndepositing,",
        "Q: Eventually you do return to Warsaw?",
        "A: I didn\u2019t make it to Warsaw. I never made it to Warsaw. The irony of it is and you can find it in\nmy book that when I came to the cashier\u2019s window in with other students, I said\nWarsaw. So she said the eastern railroad station or the main? The eastern being on the east\nbank of the river, the main being in the center of the city of Warsaw. I said, main. She said that\nwill be 50 cents more or something like that.",
        "Q: They charged you for it?",
        "A: I gladly paid for it because I had sufficient funds to pay for it. The irony of it was that we never\ngot near Warsaw.",
        "Q: Well, you didn\u2019t know it was surrounded, right?",
        "A: Of course. Not only was it surrounded because the train traveled for about 40 or 50 kilometers\nand the railroad tracks were going skyward.",
        "Q: The aerial bombardment?",
        "A: Right. There was no further railroad transportation --from there on, we were on foot. We never\ngot any further than Lublin, the city of Lublin.",
        "Q: In retrospect, retrospective knowledge, what were your family experiencing in Warsaw during\nthese months?",
        "A: You mean, actually weeks of the war?",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: What was not known to me and I found out later by miraculously meeting with my father in\nLublin is that the Polish government -- there is a controversy about it by historians. Some claim\nthat the Germans, on Polish language gave the order in Polish to the Warsaw population that all\nable bodied men of military age should march east for mobilization where they going to make a\ndefense deeper in Poland, in the country. This was given on the night, I think, of the sixth or\nseventh of September. Then my father and his two brothers were of military age and the\nfollowed these orders. They marched east of the Vistula River and they marched east without\nany specific destination but they continued to march east where they were being strafed by the\nStuka planes. But this order, a few hours later was countermanded. I think the name of the\nofficer that gave the order, countermanded it, was Romanowski. By that time, it was already\ntoo late. Because I think the afterthought was they wanted to defend Warsaw and all the\nmanpower that would have done the defense left Warsaw. So my father and his two brothers\nwere actually on the road with thousands upon thousands of men and easy targets for the\nGerman Luftwaffe to strafe and to kill. The casualties were tremendous. Eventually my father\nlost contact with his two brothers in the confusion that ensued and he got as far as Lublin. I\nfound him on the evening of Rosh Hashanah, New Year\u2019s, in the synagogue where I went to\npray. I lived there too and I seen my father there.",
        "Q: So it was a chance encounter?",
        "A: Yes, it was unbelievable because there were thousands upon thousands of refugees that\nconverged on Lublin and flooded the town way beyond its normal population.",
        "Q: Were the rest of the family back in Warsaw, were they affected at all by the bombardment?\nWere there any ---?",
        "A: Yes, the building that we lived in, the artillery destroyed part of the roof of the building. One of\nthe bombs struck the courtyard and killed a couple of people who were in a doorway, didn\u2019t go\nto the shelter. I was also told that there was a maid in our building, in one of the store that were\nin the building -- there was a drugstore by the name of Prusak. Prusak was a very nice man. I\nthink it was a family store. He was the son of the owners and used to give candles and other\nthings to kids when they came in with parents. He, somehow, got set on fire by a firebomb and\nbecame like a human torch and was burned alive during the bombardment. They had no water\nbecause all the facilities were disrupted so people literally had to travel to the Vistula River with\nbuckets to bring water. The utilities were not restored until the Germans took the city at the end\nof September.",
        "Q: So your brothers, your mother, your grandparents --?",
        "A: My grandfather, not grandparents because grandma left for United States on the last ship before\nthe outbreak of the war.",
        "Q: That\u2019s right. So grandpa is there and what was the plan? When your grandmother left to go to\nAmerica, what was the plan?",
        "A: The plan was that she is able to help us in some way. Possibly to see if she can send us\naffidavits so we all can go. Because she went on a tourist visa and ostensibly to see the World\u2019s\nFair. But in reality, she had a sister living there that visited us a few years earlier. They were\nbakers here. So she went to see this sister. My father and the family here hoped that she would\nbe able to help because by that time it was already too late. My grandmother was granted a visa\nand, of course, after obtaining the visa, she had to buy the ticket. The name of the shipping\ncompany in Poland is called Orbees to this day.",
        "Q: The same company?",
        "A: My father later told me that there was such a melee in the office of wives of important Polish\ndiplomats and government officials, they were asking to get a ticket. They had no problems\nwith visas and so forth but they were sold out. They would say that they would sleep on the\ndeck of a ship if there were no more cabins. You know, they couldn\u2019t get it; they knew already\nwhat was coming.",
        "Q: This was on the Puzutski the ship?",
        "A: Yes, Puzutsk1.",
        "Q: Interesting that some of these people had less confidence in Poland\u2019s ability to withstand the\nGerman attack. You mentioned a family of diplomats and so forth.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: So your grandmother was able to help you from America?",
        "A: Yes, well this happened sometimes later. It was not-- after the order was restored in the\noccupied Poland and they allowed return to Warsaw; we left probably already in October\nsometime, in later part of October; by horse and wagon rather than by train to come back to\noccupied Warsaw. My father immediately proceeded, engaged people to repair the building, the\nroof in the building and to restore 1t because otherwise we wouldn\u2019t have shelter. And it was\nactually in the later fall, perhaps in November of that year, we didn\u2019t get packages. We got\naffidavits for the whole family to go to the United States. My father studied these affidavits and\ndebated whether he should go to German authorities to obtain permission to leave. I don\u2019t\nknow what specific reasons were given but he never made use of these affidavits because the\nfear was that there were already some other people that have American relatives reported and\nthey were imprisoned. This was very strange because American was not at war with Germany\nat the time. So we never made use --\u2014there was great excitement and expectation, the great\nexpectation -- but it sort of was left in abeyance. Bur later on, of course, we didn\u2019t feel it so\nbadly at that time but soon famine came and Russian and all this. And things got progressively\nwell. Then the packages began to come from America, from my grandmother. She used to send\nan average of six packages a day. In the course of two days every member of the family would\nget a package.",
        "Q: And you would be able to correspond with her?",
        "A: We could correspond with her. The mail was going, it was censored, we had to be careful what\nwe are saying. We couldn\u2019t make any complaints. We understood this, that we have to be brief\nin expressing. We had to sort of let her read between the lines.",
        "Q: How long did these packages continue to come?",
        "A: The packages came until the breakdown of the postal system in the Warsaw Ghetto, meaning\nuntil the Germans put an end to it which was a few months before the deportation to Treblinka,\nthe big action as they call it, the Grossactuen which would put it in May of 1942. The packages\nbecame sporadic, eventually there was a cut off point but they were our lifesavers because the\nfamine in 1941 became very severe. If you read the notes, the Ringlem notes of the Warsaw\nGhetto, you'll find out that people were dying at the rate of 400, 500 a day. It was twice as\nmuch already in \u201942. These packages were a thing that made a difference between us living or\ndying of hunger. Because we had no other resources that I knew of at the time. We had some\nhidden shoes but it was very dangerous to sell them even in a clandestine fashion. The rations\nwere not enough to sustain life. I remember during the time of famine in the Warsaw Ghetto in\n1941 that the children would just go in groups on the streets, after the curfew; I think the curfew\nwas 8 p.m. But it was not dark yet during the summer months so they would walk on the streets\nbarefoot with the swollen legs and beg for alms and beg for food. One of the standard lines\nthey would say, Yan which means I don\u2019t want to surrender my ration card.\nSurrender meaning dying, so they were begging for bread. My parents would always do\nsomething, however inconsequential this would have been to withstand this.",
        "Q: What did your grandmother send?",
        "A: The packages that we would get, I have a feeling, were not something that she, herself,\nprepared. There must have been an agency that handled and she just paid them for it. But it\nhad canned goods like sardines, it had coconut butter, a can of coconut butter which was very\nuseful because my brother, my youngest brother Meir, had a touch of tuberculosis and he was\nspitting with blood so he needed that. They would send us Salem Lipton Tea, I remember.\nLipton Tea was worth its weight in gold because you could get -- coffee and tea was at a\npremium, above other commodities except maybe for bread. So some of these things we used\nand some of them were sold in order to buy bread.",
        "Q: So she helped feed you and she essentially gave you the wherewithal to supplement?",
        "A: She gave us a lease on life.",
        "Q: Yes. And everyone received a package?",
        "A: Well, everyone received a package by families.",
        "Q: Who would she address it to? To your -----?",
        "A: Different names of our family members. But we understood who was -- it was for Shimatopas,\nit meant it was for our family.",
        "Q: For everyone, yeah. What happened to the shoe store under the occupation?",
        "A: Well, in 1939 I believe, in November, late October or November, the Germans had arrived and\nconfiscated all the shoes. It was quite -- the shoe store was closed already and they came in. I\nremember when they were standing; they rang the bell in my grandfather\u2019s apartment which\nwas one flight above the shoe store in the same apartment building. It was a four-story\napartment building with a courtyard in the center and apartments surrounding it. I remember\nthe chief gendarme said, Is das de grochen ? , Isaac Yacob Topas? So when it\nwas answered in the affirmative, then they graciously told him that he could keep something\nlike 20 or 30 pair of shoes, or whatever. They gave him a receipt for it and they said the rest\nwill be confiscated and he will have to help to load up the trucks, himself. He and my father\nand people that were caught on the street to help out with this, so there was kind of a, like a\nbucket brigade carrying the shoes to those trucks that were being loaded.",
        "Q: Do you remember when this was?",
        "A: I would have to look in my book for exact date but it was either in -- the closest I can think,\nNovember, more likely November 1939.",
        "Q: So the Germans knew who your grandfather was?",
        "A: Well, they had information about shoe stores and businesses and so forth.",
        "Q: I was trying to imagine when we were talking about the affidavits earlier, the reasons why he\nwouldn\u2019t pursue that and I thought to myself, well perhaps he didn\u2019t want to call attention to\nhimself, especially since other people were being arrested. ---presenting yourselves to the\nGermans?",
        "A: Well, I have a feeling, because this happened later, even more so. That anyone, this was\nprobably among the Jews more prevailing this, that reported to the German authorities and\nshowed they had affidavits and wanted to leave for America, the Germans could let them go,\nthey could tell them to go home, or they could put them in prison. We knew in Poviac which\nwas the most wholesome prison in Warsaw that they had some Jewish families that had\nAmerican --. We didn\u2019t even want to let them know that we had American relationships\nalthough the packages would have indicated this. But they didn\u2019t care. Food packages 1s this\nkind of thing, that it doesn\u2019t have any political significance.",
        "Q: But it\u2019s curious that the Germans were consciously trying to starve the ghetto of Warsaw and\nyet they allowed the food packages to come.",
        "A: Absolutely. Because it was a drop in the bucket. Maybe they would feel differently if it was a\nreal organized Jewish effort in America to send packages by the thousands to cover most of the\npeople in the city. Then they would say that it would be counter to their policy of starvation. In\nfact, my grandmother\u2019s sister with whom she lodged at the beginning after she arrived in\nAmerica, there was a limit on what she could take. She couldn\u2019t take currency, just a few\nhundred dollars, from Poland when she came over to visit. But she had some jewelry and she\nwas using that to cash in the jewelry to send us these packages. But that was not enough and\nshe had to go and sought a job and found -- became a nurse, kind of a live-in nurse with a\nparalyzed woman so the income from this, from working as a nurse, she would use to send us\nthese packages. She is a big heroine in our family. She did this and her sister, I found out when\nI came to the United States, was trying to dissuade her and would say, Itala, that was her name\nshe was called by. What are you doing? What are you knocking yourself out? They are not\ngoing to get these packages. The Germans are going to confiscate all these packages.\nTherefore you are doing it in vain. My grandmother, and this was a very persuasive argument\nbecause it is always easier not to do something than to do something, kind of a law of gravity, if\nshe listened to her, we would have perished sooner. I probably wouldn\u2019t get the point where I\ncan start my concentration camp career.",
        "Q: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: I wouldn\u2019t get that far.",
        "Q: You may not have survived the ghetto either. I mean there were all kinds of ways of not\nsurviving.",
        "A: Absolutely.",
        "Q: Do you recall any other -- I can remember you had an introduction to farming and no doubt you\nwere able to put some of that training to use in the ghetto?",
        "A: Well, the training of the farming stood me well in several ways. First of all in that school, it\nwas a bodybuilding process. The hard work. I became, I was what you call a strong fellow, a\nyoung man. Secondly, it gave me the knowledge of agriculture and ability to work on a farm.\nIn the Warsaw Ghetto there was an organization called Toporol, T-o-p-o-r-o-l, which stood for\n, Means a society supporting agricultural work. That opened courses in the\nWarsaw Ghetto for people interested in this and I took those courses. This way I became\naffiliated with this organization.\n(End of Tape 1.)\nIn the summer of 1941, perhaps even in the late spring of 1941, the Toporol organization, that\norganization that was dedicated to the agricultural work, sees an opportunity of utilizing all\nempty and vacant lots of buildings or just squares -- to utilize them in growing vegetables for\nthe starving ghetto. Of course, it was a puny effort in comparison to the need where you have\nhalf a million people, nearly half a million people, starving in the walls of the ghetto. But\nnevertheless, the effort was necessary even if the produce that came from all this work was\ndistributed to the students that were working on it. Because it was not that much that they could\n-- it would be very difficult for them anyhow to get it past that point. I was at a time, already\nsixteen years old and I was made, appointed, one of the instructors. I remember there was a\nlarge plot, yard in the street, Leshner Street, not far from where we lived where I had two\ngroups of students that were coming. One for two hours and then the next one for two hours\nand I was showing them how -- we were working those lots and I was showing them how to do\nit. They were very eager kids, even some of them were, of course, undernourished. They were\nvery enthusiastically interested in the work and doing this work. In fact, one of the girls that\nwas in the group, not in my group but in the group of another instructor who was sick and I was\nsent there as a replacement one time to fill in, remembered me long after the war and sent me a\nletter to this effect, which became an appendix to my book. She is trying to find out whether I\nam the same person who acted as an instructor at the time. These kids were very eager and we\nwere planting lettuce, radishes, tomatoes, I remember, cabbage, very basic things in a kind of\ngarden farming or tract farming as they call it. I was also assigned on a Gensha Street prison\nand I also remember working at a cemetery on Gensha Street and there was a very stark contrast\nbetween what we were doing. We were pruning tomato plants for the living, while perhaps a\n100 feet from us or less, there were people being buried in mass graves. Usually the method\nthat was used, they were using a chute from the back of a wagon into those graves. The work\nwas going on all day. Those people were being -- the dead were being collected. By that time\nthe famine was very severe. I was occupied with this job, which sometimes the reward was to\nthe students and the instructors that they could pick up some of the crops of their own\nhandiwork, own labor and I think that the instructors were also getting, weekly, a loaf of bread.",
        "Q: Were you an instructor as well?",
        "A: Yeah, I was an instructor. That was what we were getting above the students, the people that\nwere coming in these groups. In the end of June of the same summer, a call went out from this\norganization for able bodied men, whom they have on their roster already, to report for\nvolunteer work in the states around the Lublin district to help with the harvest. My parents very\nquickly consented to me to go. They would have one less mouth to feed and the conditions in\nghettos were very bad. By that time, my brother Szymon also already had a touch of\ntuberculosis. He was spitting blood. This is even with the help of the packages we were getting\nfrom America. It was just not enough. We were shipped to the district of Lublin and we\nworked there. We were quartered there and worked there. Even after the harvest I managed to\nstay there until February of the following year. This was a very significant factor in my own\npersonal survival from the standpoint that I was able to eat normally during that period of time\nand live in a healthy environment of the country, quite a contrast. In fact after I had been a\nmonth on those estates, I thought to bring my brother Szymon there, somehow. There was a\nsmall post office and I managed to make a phone call to a store that was opposite to our\napartment building. My father came to the phone and I told him about this. He said that my\nbrother Szymon didn\u2019t look like a Jew and he could pass for an Aryan easily -- that he should\ncome and join me, that he should send him out of Warsaw. He came and he stayed for a few\nmonths. Of course there was a problem there. He got homesick and eventually he left and went\nback home to the ghetto.",
        "Q: Because he was homesick?",
        "A: Yes, because he was homesick. But I did not go until it was absolutely -- I found out that it was\ndangerous to live there because we no longer, we were no longer needed there for the harvest in\nFebruary, right? So in February, I returned. We were almost shot in Denblin en route by the\nGerman authorities who did not recognize our pass or came within seconds of not telling you\nthis whole story. There were many such incidents because I was also involved in smuggling\nand I cannot go into this. There was just too many schemes and escapes and whatnot. I\nreturned to the ghetto in February, found out that my grandfather, Jacob Topas, the founder died\na few months earlier.",
        "Q: In January?",
        "A: From typhus epidemic that was raging in the Warsaw Ghetto from famine because the sanitary\nconditions were very poor at the time and the overcrowding brought in lice and lice begot\ntyphus. So you had everything together. But apparently all these things that the Germans put in\noperation to strangulate the economic life of the Warsaw Ghetto and to bring the demise of the\nJews, didn\u2019t happen for them fast enough. So the inevitable thing is that they had to resort to a\nmore drastic method of bringing about the end of the Jewish community in Warsaw and in\nPoland. In April of 1942, a reign of terror started in the Warsaw Ghetto. We began to talk about\nbuilding shelters; something was impending, we didn\u2019t know exactly what. The packages from\nAmerica stopped coming. I forgot to mention that when America entered the war, my\ngrandmother resorted to ---. She was very resourceful, she contacted someone in the\nPortuguese embassy or consulate and the packages were coming -- the point of origin was\nPortugal. Portugal was neutral so we were getting packages probably until spring of 1942.\nThen the whole postal system, the whole ghetto system began to break down. The Germans, as\nI mentioned to you, launched a reign of terror in April of 1942. They kept it up. Later on I\nlearned that this reign of terror was to paralyze the will of the people to resist for what was\ncoming., for what they had in store for them. That was the \u201cresettlement\u201d action. Resettlement\nmeant shipment to Treblinka. It started by them posting the declarations or the ordinance that\nthe Jews should report voluntarily to the umschlagplatz, the umschlagplatz being the depot from\nwhich the trains were leaving for Treblinka.. They would go east, they would obtain shelter.\nThose who report voluntarily would receive jam and bread and surprisingly enough, the first\nday, which was July 22\" and this happened to be Tish a\u2019Bov, the day of mourning for the Jews\nfor the two destructions of the First and Second Temple in 586 B.C. and 70 A.D. by\nBabylonians and Romans, respectively; so the Germans launched this action. The key\ningredient in carrying it out was deception. Deception being that the Jews were promised to go\nto the east where there\u2019s work, shelter for them and they imagined that nothing could be worse\nthan the ghetto so the poorest of the poor began to report to the umschlagplatz with their\nluggage,. The Germans tolerated it. The first shipment, the people received the bread, they\nreceived the jam, they were able to take their luggage and they were put in the box cats and\nshipped away. But within 24 hours, rumors spread as a wildfire, that someone escaped from\nthis transport and that Treblinka is really an extermination camp. I remember that evening\nwhen we heard it in our homes ---.",
        "Q: So already in July of \u201942 ---?",
        "A: Yes, I think within a day or two we already knew what Treblinka meant. Many people didn\u2019t\nwant to believe it, we believed it. In these circumstances-- by that time my brother and I were\nalready in a Luftwaffe camp, my brother Szymon. In other words, he -- we both report as\nvolunteers to go to Luftwaffe camp yet before this action was launched. This was kind if a\ntransition from the agricultural work into the Luftwaffe camp and this was a forced labor\ncolumn. We were not quartered there; we were still living with our family and were just\ncoming to a point at the Warsaw Ghetto gate where two Luftwaffe guards would take us to our\njob. Sometimes they used streetcars for part of the trip. There was a place called Bilanie; there\nwas a big storage of Luftwaffe equipment, paints, and maintenance things for aircraft when we\nwere supposed to work. But initially they got us cleaning bricks in bombed-out houses. I don\u2019t\nknow why but I said to myself, we are back in the brickfields, we are back in the brickfields.\nSymbolically we were reduced to the status of our ancestors in Egypt. But this still was,\ncomparatively, benign to what was in store for us in this forced labor column. When the action\nwas launched, as I mentioned before, on the second and third day, there were no volunteers to\ngo to the umschlagplatz. So the Germans began isolating and putting a dragnet on certain\nsections of -- block by block of the city and emptied the houses. They also would come in,\nwhen the Germans came to conduct this with their trucks and wagons, sometimes, they usually\nmarched people, those that could march. Those who were already immobile, they were\nhandicapped or they were so starved that they couldn\u2019t walk, they threw them in the wagons\nand they took them that way. They could come in and announce that they would respect all the\npasses because the people were working for German industry; they were working maybe for the\nghetto government, like the Judenrat; they were working for the city ornundines which was the\npolice; maybe they were working for the hospital; they would be all exempt. So they were ---.",
        "Q: They would respect these passes in the east after resettlement?",
        "A: They had an assorted degree of authority that in the beginning, they respected them all. As the\ntime went on, they were less and less respected. I didn\u2019t have any pass so that if I was caught, I\nprobably would have been shipped out to Treblinka too because we were simply assembling\nevery morning before the action started, however, early in the morning to go out and were\nbrought at the end of the day, to the point, to the gate and then we were on our own to get\nhome.. But after this action went into effect and was already in effect for a week or two, once\nwe came to work, the captain said when you come tomorrow to work, bring your things with\nyou because you\u2019re going to be here, interned for your own protection. Then he looked at the\nfaces; he passed all of us in review. The whole group of about two hundred people. He looked\nat my brother and he said he cannot come tomorrow, he\u2019s too young. He also, maybe, exempted\nanother kid and that was the end of it. When we came home, the ghetto was in such a state of\nterror besides this, that the German SS men were riding in rickshaws. You know what the\nrickshaws were? They were those bicycle-pedaled three-wheelers where the passengers are\nsitting in the front and the bicycle-peddler in the back. They would ride in the bicycle-pedaled\nrickshaw and they would be firing at the windows at the people and the crowds wherever they\nsee them.. So we were literally dodging bullets when we were coming back from our work. Of\ncourse, after that incident, after we were told that we\u2019re going to be interned there, I realized\nthat I\u2019m going to have to part from my family. The morning after this, when I got up in the\nmorning, my father was still praying. I said goodbye to my mother and she was packing some\nof my things that I was going to take with me. I said goodbye to my sweet brother Meir, my\nyoungest brother, Meir, and to Szymon. Then my father gave me a blessing; it was the first\ntime I\u2019d seen him cry in my life because he was a very steady influence. He was a very self-\npossessed individual and confident that somehow we\u2019re going to get through this whole ordeal\nand so forth. I don\u2019t know what was going on in his mind but if I did not realize it, he must\nhave realized that we are parting for good.",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t realize it?",
        "A: No. I was too much of an optimist. I was too young. I\u2019m sort of a romantic in a sense that I\nthink that hope can overcome reason.",
        "Q: And you had managed to come back before. I imagine that you had a feeling that somehow you\ncould manage. From Lublin the first time, and then coming -- I imagine each time you walked\nback from work, there was sort of a feeling of survival, giving the random violence that was\ngoing on?",
        "A: Correct. I also had faith that evil cannot vanquish good. So in the long run, I don\u2019t think that\nthere was any doubt even by those who perished that Germany will be defeated and that they\u2019re\ngoing to win the war. The question is when. But there was no doubt that Hitler will lose that\nwar and that the Allies will prevail and win. But meanwhile, we were in their grasp so such\noptimism has a limited value and effect on your well-being. Of course when I took my last\nglance at my father, that was it. I haven\u2019t seen him again nor my parents. I went to this camp.\nWe learned that in October, Yom Kippur, the Day of Judgment, was the last day of the\nshipments to Treblinka. In fact, the Jewish police had the honor of being put in the last\ntransport to Treblinka because they were promised that if they cooperate in the round-up of the\nJews in the Warsaw Ghetto, that they and their families would be spared. So they and their\nfamilies on the Judgment Day were spared until that point but then they were also shipped. I\nguess there was some poetic justice in that.",
        "Q: Symbolism at least.",
        "A: Right. I began to realize that if I wanted to know what happened to my parents and to my\nfamily, I would have to return t the ghetto. But you just simply cannot say I am leaving. We\nwere by that time already interned, we were prisoners, we were not free people. Although there\nwas such a nebulous air about it as to exactly what is our status there. We worked there; they\nintern us for our own protection. That means if we leave, we are just taking risk with the\nprotection. But, in reality, you could be shot for leaving without permission. I began to plan an\nescape. The way I went about it, I reported that I am a shoemaker by trade and that we have\npeople here whose shoes need repair. If they are going to continue to work, someone has to\nrepair their shoes, that I should be given the opportunity to do this. In order to do this, I need\ntools and equipment and I can get these in the ghetto. So they send me with a guard to the\nghetto. On the second such trip, I escaped. I left the cart waiting. Then I began to -- I had to\ngo where our home was. By that time, the ghetto was reduced in size. There was what they call\nNiemand\u2019s Land that means Nobody\u2019s Land and it was not permitted to be there but there was a\ngroup that the SS employed in the Warsaw Ghetto of Jews which was called Vertafastak.\nVertafastak was sort of a clean up group that was confiscating all the -- collecting all the goods\nof the people that were no longer there. Furniture, books, belongings, clothes, whatever else\nthose that were deported to Treblinka left behind. It was a big operation and a large contingent\nof these who were working. They would be doing it by streets.. I reported to work with such a\ngroup and when they went there, I separated myself from them by just ---. There were so many\npeople walking upstairs and downstairs and there were only a couple of guards usually at the\ngate. I went on the roof and through the roof I walked to the roof of the adjacent building, came\ndown and eventually got to the area of my own building which, of course was deserted. But I\nfound out that behind iron doors, back doors of one of the delicatessen stores, which really\ndelicatessen in Poland means something else, means like a grocery store. I found out that the\nsurvivors there who knew me and who were tenants in our building, that my mother perished,\nthat she was one of the first -- in one of the early raids -- and they told me that my father might\nstill be around but they don\u2019t know. Eventually I met in this Niemand\u2019s Land another person\nwho had a store also in the building. His name was Bart and he told me to look; he told me that\nthere is reason my father and my brother survived in there someplace, perhaps in the camp.\nWithout going into much detail, I never found out anything more beyond that except returning\nonce with the group I found that my Uncle Melek survived and he\u2019s now in the small ghetto. I\nwent to him. He, in turn, told me that my grandmother, my maternal grandmother survived by\nhiding herself in a clothes chest and her sisters, three sisters.",
        "Q: These are your mother\u2019s sisters from Plutz who were moved to the Warsaw Ghetto?",
        "A: Right. They survived and they were on U Sreet, not exactly where my uncle was. I\nwent and found them and I lived there because there were also two kids in there, while I was\nworking for this Vertafastak operation. This I did this until January, In January, I heard a rumor\nabout cleaning up the umschlagplatz again so I went to the arbeizen which 1s the work office. I\nwas sort of casing the joint as the word goes and I found out that another Luftwaffe guard came\nin with a Jewish foreman or leader and they were looking for volunteers. When I ascertained\nthat they are not from Bilanie but from another place, from Orcencia which was the airport, the\nlargest airfield to this day in Warsaw, I volunteered for this group. Also forced labor column\nand I was able to stay with my aunts and just go every morning to work. But when the action\nstarted and the Germans surrounded the ghetto on January 18\" or 19\", 1943, I found myself ina\ndilemma-- \u2014 how to get -- the problem how to get out and rejoin the group and not get caught in\nthe net, in the dragnet. Eventually through Visu who is a friend of Mead who was an\nartist in the process of painting the picture of the commanding officer of the airport, he and his\nbrother, and a few other fellows gathered that morning and a call was made to the Luftwaffe\ncamp from the Polish precinct. Polish police and they sent guards and brought us there. There\nwe were for a while until the Warsaw Ghetto uprising. In the interim, I made another foray to\nthe Warsaw Ghetto with another guard to obtain some things from my uncle, some clothes he\ngave me.",
        "Q: Uncle Melek?",
        "A: Uncle Melek. The book tells you about the details because I had a fight with him there. But\nthis I felt that he was hoarding some stuff that he got from the shoe store and that he was not\nsharing it with me. Anyway, by that time, the Warsaw Ghetto was already in its residual stage,\nwas in the final days of its existence. By that time, we didn\u2019t know about it, but the resistance\norganization already was functioning. One of the things was when I visited my uncle under\nguard, from this Orcencia Luftwaffe camp, there was a shot fired. We run to the window and\nwe found out that there were just two Jewish civilians that fired and killed one of the informers,\nGestapo Jewish informer. You could see that the Germans didn\u2019t interfere with it, they didn\u2019t\ncare. In April 18\" or 19\", I think, the Passover marked the Warsaw Ghetto revolt which was a\nreaction to the German entry to the ghetto to start to \u201cresettle\u2019\u2019, to liquidate the ghetto. Also\nfrom Orcencia, some weapons were smuggled to the fighters in the Warsaw Ghetto. I didn\u2019t\nknow it, exactly how they did it and who was ---. I was not among the insiders. From our\nairfield, planes took off to bomb, firebomb the Warsaw Ghetto by the Luftwaffe and we knew\nabout it. As the Warsaw Ghetto was going up in flames, rumors spread that they\u2019re going to\nliquidate all the camps around Warsaw including the one where I was interned. It was a small\ncamp, a little over 100 prisoners.",
        "Q: It was run by the Luftwaffe?",
        "A: By the Luftwaffe. We were working at the airfield. There was a Yunkirst enterprise, a\ndismantling division of aircraft, shot down fighter planes over Germany that was brought in\nthere. This is how the weapons got sometimes in the hands of the fighters. They were found in\nthese planes. I think on May 12\", we were being, we were sent to the Warsaw Ghetto under\nguard. At that time, the Warsaw Ghetto was already in ruins but the fight was still going on.\nWe were taken to the umschlagplatz and shipped to Majdanek. I didn\u2019t know about it but we\nfound out we were shipped to Majdanek, we decided not to jump the train, not to make any\nefforts, because we knew we were on a line that was not going to Treblinka; we established that\npoint. But it turned out to be that we were slated to go to gas chambers anyway. In Majdanek,\nalso there were gas chambers.",
        "Q: But you didn\u2019t know that?",
        "A: We didn\u2019t know that then. My father perished in Majdanek; I didn\u2019t know that then either.\nBecause this was posthumously and after the war. Anyway I cannot tell you all the details\nbecause I would be getting too emotional as to what has happened on this trip but we were\nlucky that we were only -- by that time -- since what was coming was anticipated, about\nfourteen guys escaped from our camp. What was left was about 88 men because I remember\nwhen the Luftwaffe turned us over to the SS at the umschlagplatz, they said, they\nyelled. So they said . There was 88, this is how I remember there were 88. We lost one\nguy in the melee in Majdanek but we saved some other people that were behind us and were\nsent to a camp named Budzyn. There was a miraculous saving, something happened in there\nthat was just unbelievable. I describe it in detail in my book and we were sent to Budzyn where\nthere was an aircraft Heinkil Aircraft plant, probably the worst camp in the penal system as far\nas treatment went by one named Fikes. Reinhold Fikes was the commanding officer in the rank\nof a sergeant and he was an incarnation of cruelty and bestiality in what he dd. In that camp, I\nstayed about eleven months. This camp eventually became -- was an SS labor camp \u2014became a\nconcentration camp. The difference being that they put us in striped uniforms. Before we were\nwearing our civilian clothes. This was a time where I registered as a chemist, as an inventor\nand later on this resulted me working on this super-weapon development which didn\u2019t turn out\nanything but it was a good vehicle to ride out the remaining months of the war. From that\ncamp, we were sent to a camp called Plaszow near Cracow. From Plaszow, we were shipped to\nFlossenburg. In Flossenburg, this group was really commissioned so to speak, really put to\nwork in what was reputed to be a super weapon.",
        "Q: Is this the same group of 88.",
        "A: No, no. The 88 had nothing to do with it. There was a registry because we were sent to Budzyn",
        "Q: This is when you became a chemist? You were in another group?",
        "A: There was another group because the camp had over 2,000 people in Budzyn. This group was\nonly maybe 50, 60 people large and it was an aggregate of people from different camps.\nBudzyn had a contingent in it; Plaszow picked up a few people. But eventually we were being\nset up in a sort of lab to work in, in Flossenburg. That\u2019s where the real work went in. It was an\nunbelievable experience because I learned English working in this lab. There was nothing\nreally for me to do. I found an English textbook and David Copperfield and I learned English,\nfound a tutor as well, among the prisoners.",
        "Q: A Jewish inmate?",
        "A: Yes, named Goldfarb who was teaching me grammar. But there was a group of prisoners who\nwas actually working on plans for this device, as the Germans called apparatus. There were\nsome rumors as to what it could do if it were successful in doing it. It fell into the realm of the\nsemi-fantastic. I spoke once to my uncle who was a chemist, about it, and he says that what\nthey propose to do could not be achieved. It was unobtainable but they thought it was. The\nGermans were not fools; they apparently were convinced that something could be done. This\nproject was not such a local thing. We didn\u2019t know about it at the time but it claimed the\ninterest of the highest echelon of Nazi power. I have a telegram that came after my book went\nto print, which is addressed to Himmler to grant permission to move this group, which 1s\nessential to the war effort, this is German\u2019s writing, a Jewish group essential to the war effort .\nDo you see the paradox in this? If we help them win the war, they\u2019re going to exterminate all\nthe Jews. To the war effort and I have a reply from Himmler\u2019s office, from Himmler\u2019s\nheadquarters, that he grants permission and that the matter should be taken up with so-and-so to\ntransfer the Jews, the scientists. So we\u2019re working there. Eventually, when this project did not\nproduce a mousetrap, it was disbanded and it was just a few weeks later that the Allies armies\nwere already close to Flossenburg. I don\u2019t know how close they were because I was on a death\nmarch for about three, close to four days. We were liberated in April by the 11 Armored\nDivision and of course, then I realized what happened to the other members of my family. I\nknew already in the Warsaw Ghetto, from my Uncle Melek, whom I found after I came from\nThe Orcencia; I met him after the Orcencia place, I was in his apartment. He told me that Uncle\nBen is hiding on the Aryan side of the Warsaw Ghetto and that Rose, his wife, has Aryan\npapers, works for German industry. She hides him in her apartment. I found out that possibly\nthat my Uncle Sevek, the orphan --cousin who lived -- one of the three orphans brought up in\nmy grandparents\u2019 home, is also some place in hiding but he didn\u2019t know where. He didn\u2019t know\nwhether he is still in hiding or whether he perished. But beyond that all contact was lost and I\nhave not learned of any details of any of my relatives except that I found out that my father,\nthrough Tracing Bureau, they send me this document that I showed you just when you\nfirst came in -- that attested to the fact that my father lost his life in Majdanek on September 23,\n1942. So my mother died in Treblinka in the first action, 1942, probably in August with my\nbrother Meir. Now the only person that I don\u2019t have a definite proof that was killed is my\nbrother Szymon, to this day. Because all other perished. My grandmother, who saved herself\nfrom the first round-up in 1942, was probably shipped out in 1943 if she didn\u2019t perish sooner,\nwith her daughters, my aunts and with these two boys of the eldest daughter, Frania.",
        "Q: So your brother Szymon, the last we saw of him, he went back to the ghetto because he was\nhomesick?",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: And he was staying with your mother?",
        "A: With the family, at home. Now --.",
        "Q: But he didn\u2019t go with your mother and the other brother?",
        "A: No, he didn\u2019t go with my mother. This much I have learned. Also I have learned -- of course\nafter liberation I have received, I have overheard conversation between liberated prisoners like\nmyself, that there was a Topas in Prague, in Czechoslovakia, in Roxy Hotel where refugees\nconverged. I immediately -- I was at that time with the United States Army; I was in the CIC\ncorp, Counter intelligence Corp. I was one of the most fortunate of prisoners that I was allowed\nstill to fight. I was with the 104th regiment of the 26\" division with the Third Army. After the\nwar, I was attached to a CIC unit in Nuremberg, in the town that you mentioned before,\nstationed in Nuremberg. I found out that my uncle survived; Uncle Ben survived and I also\nlater on found out that he fought in the Polish uprising of 1944. But Andros was shipped with\nthe Polish people to Germany because all Warsaw was emptied out of people. They were sent\neither to concentration camps or forced labor. He was sent to farm work. He remained on the\nruins of Warsaw and lived from what he -- like a scavenger. I sent somebody, a friend of mine\nwho also figures prominently in my book, to bring him. He brought him -- he went to the\nRussian zone and brought my Uncle Ben and we had a reunion and we met. Then I sent another\nprisoner to bring his wife from the British zone. I found out that she was in Castle because my\ngrandmother\u2019s letter told me this after I resumed contact with her. She sent me food packages\nand money and so forth",
        "Q: So your Uncle managed to survive midst the ruins of Warsaw until January \u201945 and then he was\nliberated by the Russians and then at the end of the war --?",
        "A: He went to Czechoslovakia.",
        "Q: He went to Czechoslovakia and you saw him again?",
        "A: Right. He was searching relatives. He wanted to get possible --. I don\u2019t know what he\nintended to do but he found out ---. Then he told me about Sevek, that he also survived and that\nhe went to Israel, he and his wife, Rita. They were childless and he was already by that time, in\nhis forties. Sevek, the cousin.",
        "Q: He survived in the ghetto, in Warsaw?",
        "A: No. He went into hiding. There\u2019s an interesting story. He used to work for our company. All\nthe orphans, the three orphans worked for our company but he married one of the pretty\nsalesgirls from our company. He separated himself from us and he opened his own store of\ncustom made shoes, a smaller --.",
        "Q: This was a non-Jewish wife?",
        "A: No, no, a Jewish wife, a salesgirl, right. Her name was Rita, a very attractive girl. They\nestablished themselves a few streets away from us, with a shoe store. When the war broke out,\nhe gave all of the goods to one of the Polish-- his Polish salesgirls. That Polish salesgirl took it\nto her own home and she would be selling, periodically, some of the leather or leather goods\nand bringing them money to live on, to the ghetto. She would be going back and forth. But\nlater on, established through her contact, they established a liaison with one of the Polish\nunderground operators from the Socialist Party who were more friendly towards \u2014 well--\ndisposed to the Jews --.",
        "Q: The People\u2019s Guard?",
        "A: Whatever. But it was not so altruistic. What happened is this; that he had in a place called\nRamburtoof, I believe. I\u2019m not absolutely certain because it had two names in Polish names of\nthe town that sound the same. When I went to visit Poland I was searching for the people that\nhid him in the wrong town because of the similarity of names. He had his wife living there -- it\nwas like a suburban town of Warsaw and a daughter and son which were already in their late\nteens. But he also had a lover in Warsaw where he worked so he couldn\u2019t support two of them.\nBy getting my uncle Sevek, my cousin Sevek and his wife to hide, he got income for them so\nthey didn\u2019t have to depend on my pay. He could live with his lover and they supplied the\nincome for his wife and kids, for the two children. He was in hiding there until liberated by the\nRussians. He was there for seventeen months living mainly under the floorboards of their\nbedroom or whatever.",
        "Q: So his liberation also was in January of \u201845 or earlier?",
        "A: Even earlier.",
        "Q: Because he\u2019s on the other side of the river?",
        "A: Right, he was on the east side of the river.",
        "Q: So we know that much about the town. It was to the east?",
        "A: Right. And something about Sevek. He was a very friendly guy. When I was growing up, I\nwas a kid., he was already almost 20 years old. He had a way with the kids, always a smile on\nhis face. You were never told that he had a hard life, that he was an orphan; he was not\nembittered by it and he didn\u2019t have any chip on his shoulder. He would spend a lot of time with\nthe kids and play around, clown to entertain us, and so forth. I was very happy to hear that he\nsurvived. Then, of course, I visited him to find out how he survived. That\u2019s why I\u2019m able to\ntell you that. He went to Israel; now he\u2019s in Germany, really. Because his wife couldn\u2019t find\nwork in Israel and there were hardships at the beginning. They went to Israel when it was still\nPalestine, before Independence.",
        "Q: So he settled in Israel?",
        "A: He was settled there; he was there maybe for two or three years. Then his wife wanted to go to\nFrance to find a job for him and for her and she couldn\u2019t. She couldn\u2019t get permission to reside\nthere so she went to Germany, unfortunate. This is where he is today. He is already 83 years\nold. Now about my brother Szymon. In 1989, my wife, in company of my wife, my friend\nMark, his wife, Bea, and their two sons, we embark on a trip of memory lane. To go back to\nPoland after 50 years absence and to Israel on our way back and Germany. I also stop in\nGermany.",
        "Q: To see --?",
        "A: To see Flossenburg -- and Sevek. We went together to visit Flossenburg. Now when we visit\nPoland, we realize that we are going to be there only six days or seven days. Our time was of\nessence there, so we preplanned exactly what we are going to ---.\n(End of Side A, Tape 11)\nWe arranged for two chauffeurs and two limos, two cars to take us around so we don\u2019t depend\non the regular tourist conveyance top see the places. Because there were specific places that the\nitinerary for our visit to Poland was planned in advance and it was very compact. We had to\ncrowd many things into a very short space -- so that when we arrived in Warsaw, we had two\nlimos already when we arrived at the airport to pick us up, to take us to the hotel and the\nfollowing morning, we started our visit. Of course my visit included first of all the city of\nWarsaw itself, the ghetto monument, the site of our apartment building in the Warsaw Ghetto,\nwhich building had been erased, had been destroyed during the uprising or possibly after the\nuprising, perhaps in the Polish revolt which was in 1944. It included visits to my childhood\nplace of Shaboruf where I -- to remember the villa that belonged to my grandparents, perhaps\nstill does, where we spent summers in my childhood days. Then we went to Majdanek, we visit\nin the Lublin district. I see also the city of Lublin which I had memory because I knew a family\nthere and a girl that perished in Poland. Then we went to places of that was of\ninterest to my friend Mark. We went, I think that this 1s what we did in the course of time. We\nstill had Warsaw, increments of Warsaw that were to be seen, for instance, the Warsaw cemetery\nthat we didn\u2018t have time. I don\u2019t know on which day but I think on one day, perhaps it was\nSunday, the following Sunday of our arrival, that we decided to split because Mark had his own\nitinerary with his car to see Radom and I wanted to see my mother\u2019s hometown of Plutz. We\nwent to Plutz and we have seen what there was to see. The synagogue was destroyed but the\nbuildings were still there. I seen my grandparents\u2019 home, apartment, which was very, very\nsmall and --.",
        "Q: The opposite of luxurious?",
        "A: Of what we were used to in Warsaw. After seeing all these places and the Vistula River and\nwhatever I could associate with the past, we went to see.. Then we had a very intelligent driver\nand driving back to Warsaw I realized that in spite of our frugality in using time economically,\nin disposing of time, we were coming early. I said to myself, I looked at my watch and I think it\nwas something like 4:30 p.m. and the days in late August were very long. I said to the driver, I\nsaid, do we have time to see another place in the vicinity of Warsaw? Which really was not on\nschedule. But it suddenly occurred to me that the last three summers, we did not go to our villa\nin Shorboruf, but we went to Oralie a village called Oralie which was kind of a summer resort\nand also a farming community. I was there in the summer of \u201937 and \u201938 and my family was\nthere also in the summer of \u201939. Because in \u201938 in the middle of the summer, I was sent to the\nagricultural school as you recall. I said, it would be interesting to see because I would be able\nto see the very cottage where we stayed in. I asked my wife and she consented and the driver\nsaid, by all means, he was gung-ho. We directed because it was in the vicinity of Warsaw, it\nwould not take us more than maybe half an hour out of the way, counting both ways. We had\nsome difficulty finding our way to the place, to recognize and so forth. Finally, some people\ntold me which building it is that I probably was in that summer. I came by that building with\nthe car and I look at that building and I say, no this is not the building, it doesn\u2019t have veranda.\nWe turn around and went back to the beginning of the street of the village when one of the\nproperties -- a woman, elderly lady told us that this is the building. I say this is not the building.\nShe says this is the building. I spoke to her in Polish. She says this is the building, she insisted,\npersisted rather. I said, where\u2019s the veranda? She says it was removed. That can confuse you.",
        "Q: So you were both right?",
        "A: I asked her and she took us there. It turned out to be she was a sister-in-law of the landlady of\nthe building named Levandofska. Mr. Levandofsky was, of course, the landlord. When I was\nthere, she was a woman in her twenties. Now she was nearly 80 years old. She was sitting\nthere; 1t looked like a rocking chair in the house. The lady that brought us in said you have\nguests in here. The guests being my wife, the driver and myself. We came in, we looked at her,\nand I began to orient myself there that this is the building in which we stayed. This was a\nbuilding that -- there were three families in the summer that shared that building. I\u2019m repeating\nsomething that you can find in my book but I can probably tell you this in a greater detail than\nyou will find in my book. I say Mrs. Levandofska; she didn\u2019t know who I was but they knew\nthat we are tourists and that we were probably from America and I spoke Polish. Many Poles\nreturned back to Poland. I said to her, do you remember who lived in this -- who was\nvacationing here in the summer, who occupied this building in the summer of 1938, \u201939? She\nlooked and just stared at me without saying anything like gathering her thoughts. Of course, I\ncouldn\u2019t figure what were her thoughts. I went one step further and I said, do you remember\nwho was in this apartment? Pointing to one of the doors. She said Lasolta. I said it was a\nPolish pilot, the family who lived there. So she says Lasolta. She remembered that name. I\npointed to another door and she mentioned the other family. Then I didn\u2019t say anything for a\nmoment. Then I said, wasn\u2019t a Jewish family here also in this apartment here? Pointing to the\nlast one. She says, yes, Topas. She said, Mr. Topas, very sympathetic man, and Mrs. Topas,\nvery nice lady. And they had two children. The oldest was Yurik and the younger was Szymon,\nanother baby too? Oh yeah, Meirick. That\u2019s Meir. She told them that my father was very good\nto them. He brought gifts, shoes for the family in addition to whatever they paid for the rent.\nShe volunteered a few things. I said to her I was very pleased. We took some photographs. I\nthought the audience was over and I already exchanged some dollars for Polish money which\npower of dollars was tremendous. I was going to give her a few thousand of the Polish zloty\nwhich were not very much in American money but I felt that I took her time and so forth. I felt\nthat I would do it just as a friendly gesture. But just about when I thought that the whole\ninterview was over, she began to shake in her chair. She says, Szymonik, such a well-built boy,\na pleasant boy, didn\u2019t look Jewish. He came here from the Warsaw Ghetto in the summer of\n1942, I think. He asked me to save him, to shelter him, to hide him. I wanted to do it, I really\nwanted to do it. But we were afraid because the trains were going from Warsaw to Treblinka on\nthe track that was stopping in our Ourland during the normal rides and the Jews were jumping\noff the trains. There was a gendarme named Stein who was looking for them here. I was afraid\nthat if I\u2019m going to hide him, the neighbors will snitch on me and then we\u2019re all going to be\nkilled. So I said to Szymonik, let my husband take you to the next village. Maybe you can be a\nshepherd there to cows, that sort of thing. Szymon, my brother, at that time was about fourteen\nyears old. But he didn\u2019t want to go. He says he doesn\u2019t know there anybody. But, and she\nrepeated it again. He told me that his grandmother lives in America, is in America. I\nimmediately presumed that he said that to make her understand that if she does this, if she takes\nthe risk, that she would be rewarded for it, after the war. I ask her, Mrs. Levandoska, then what\nhappened? Did he leave? She said, well maybe he stayed here a day or two, a few days and\nthen he left. I said did you hear anything about him? She said no. I had right away a\npremonition that he must have perished not far from this point because he came in and although\nhe didn\u2019t look Jewish, but he was a kid and he was scared. You realize that every Jew just by\nvirtue of being Jewish, had a price tag on his life.",
        "Q: And he was in an area where they were hunting for Jews?",
        "A: And a Polish peasant who turned in a Jew could get a bottle of vodka and two pounds of sugar\nand maybe a hundred zlotys. So there was a reward, just as there was punishment for hiding the\nJews, there was a reward for turning them in. He might have been turned in by Polish people;\nhe might have made it back to the ghetto. I really don\u2019t know. When she came to the end, she\nwas very sad. She realized that I\u2019m a relative but she didn\u2019t know who I was.",
        "Q: She still didn\u2019t know who you are?",
        "A: I told her that I\u2019m Yurik, that I survived the war. I joined the American army, fought to the\nwar\u2019s end, and came to America. My grandmother lived in America at the time, until 1969,\nwhen she died here in Lakewood. She\u2019s buried in Lakewood. But I still gave her the money.\nShe didn\u2019t want to accept the money. Why are you giving money? I didn\u2019t save your brother,\nshe said. Oh well, you wanted to save him. Then it seemed like there was nothing more. I was\npretty -- right now I can speak about it without being as shaken up as I was at the time when it\nhappened and when I repeated it the first time or two, but now it\u2019s in the book. Then I said -- I\njust thought for a moment -- I said do you have any photographs of before the war? So they\nbrought in an album of photographs before the war. I scanned through the photographs and\nseen the building, I seen Mr. Landofsky who, incidentally, was laying paralyzed from the waist\ndown in bed next door in the room where we were talking. I didn\u2019t see anything. I was hoping\nthat maybe they photographed our family, which for me, would have been priceless but they\ndidn\u2019t have any. There were some loose photographs that were just bunched up in the bottom of\n-- the end of the album. I went through these photographs. I found a photograph of Adolph\nHitler..",
        "Q: That tells you something?",
        "A: It was really confusing.",
        "Q: Was there any writing on it?",
        "A: No writing. It was just like a post card, a picture of Adolph Hitler. The driver had seen this\nwith me and I just didn\u2019t say anything about it. I just shut and closed the album and we left.\nWhen we get in the car, I was confused but I realized that her husband must have been a Hitler\nsympathizer. That she might have, I feel that she was an earnest person, an earnest woman\nbecause she didn\u2019t have to tell me anything. She didn\u2019t have to tell me that he came back there\nto save her, that he came from the Warsaw Ghetto, had to risk his life and get out. Came to her\nand asked her to be kept in there . She didn\u2019t have to volunteer any of that; I didn\u2019t ask her. She\ndid tell me this so she -- maybe she had good intentions. She wanted to save him but maybe her\nhusband was opposed to it. He might have been an admirer of Hitler.",
        "Q: Or even if he weren\u2019t, he could have opposed it for other reasons.",
        "A: They had reasons but what shall I say?",
        "Q: It\u2019s hard to imagine a real Pole being an admirer of Hitler.",
        "A: Well there was admiration for ---. Until Hitler turning on to Poland. There was a tremendous\nadmiration for Germany because of their policy towards the Jews.",
        "Q: Considering what they were doing to Poland, that would not have been very patriotic.",
        "A: Yes, it would not be patriotic and perhaps it is to their credit, of the Poles, that they didn\u2019t have\nmany collaborators against their own people that we know of. They didn\u2019t have many\ncollaborators towards their own people. But many among them were very vicious anti-Semites\nand we were talking about all these people. I didn\u2019t mention to you, the Rosenbaums who are in\nmy book, a beautiful girl -- and her mother were hidden. They were in Lublin. I met them -- I\ngot to know them during the war in Lublin when I was staying there. My father was there. You\nremember when I told you we met. Later on I got a post card that she is hiding. I told you I\nwas still in Warsaw Ghetto when they went into hiding on a farm by a fellow named\nSty in Sm , Ko in Poland. It was not until maybe five years ago\nthat a widow of the son of the owner, who told me that both women were killed by people other\nthan the Germans. She didn\u2019t say so but she says they were killed because of their possessions.\nThey went out in the middle of the night with valises having their valuables with them, no\ndoubt, and he says, you know that there was no shortage of vile people during the war and they\nwere shot and buried in the woods nearby. This is something I have to return to because I didn\u2019t\nhave a chance to visit Sm where possibly the burial ground is. I don\u2019t think that\nthe grave was marked. But this is where they were shot and they were shot by Poles. My\nbrother Szymon, is still an enigma even in spite of any premonition I have. There was an\ninteresting development that is almost anti-climatic to everything we are talking about. My\nwife, first, and then my son visiting Israel went to a cavern which is on the border of Lebanon\nand Israel. The cavern is a tourist attraction and they seen on the wall, the name of Simon\nTopas. It\u2019s a Simon Topas spelled exactly, not with a \u201cz\u201d but with an \u201cs\u201d\u2019, Topas. Silemonca\nSpain, familia Topas, familia Simon Topas Silemonca Spain. I have -- just as I talk to you I\njust thought -- why I\u2019m not able to find anything about this family. Because I\u2019m asking for the\ntelephone number of Simon Topas at the Silemonca operator in Spain. I wrote to the Red Cross\nand to the post office. He said the family of Simon Topas which means, if it were my brother,\nin the unlikely event, it is not he who wrote this --scribbled that name-- but maybe his son or his\ndaughter who marked this in order to look for someone. The name could be -- the first name\ncould be different. And if it was a daughter who was married and took another family name. I\nthink, in Spain, it works in reverse, the men assume the wife\u2019s -- the family assumes the wife\u2019s\nlast name",
        "Q: Yes, they use both.",
        "A: They use both. So this is still an unresolved kink but it\u2019s very unlikely. Once I got excited, I\nfound in Israel, Szymon Topas, in a missing persons bureau in Jerusalem. I immediately sent a\ntelegram there and the guy was nice enough to send me a telegram back that he assumed the\nname Topas after coming from Russia to Israel.",
        "Q: Plus it would be inconceivable that he wouldn\u2019t be looking for you, for others?",
        "A: That id true. I am still going to check out the Silemonca, Spain \u2014",
        "Q: You have to ?",
        "A: Yeah, I have to. This is because we are -- we have so little and we are hanging on to a straw.\nThis is very, very weak indication but I\u2019m saying to myself, who would come, who would be\ninterested in coming to Israel? Although non-Jews come to Israel and all the tourists, Jewish\nand non-Jewish like to see all the tourist attractions. Besides the religious aspect, there are non-\nsectarians so to speak. Certainly a cavern is something that interests everybody. Could be a\nMorano",
        "Q: No, I wouldn\u2019t have expected you to be descendants of Sephardim from ---.",
        "A: But we are.",
        "Q: You are? From 1492?",
        "A: Yes. According to a distant relative who married my grandmother and comes from Warsaw, a\nfellow named Max Muskowitz, told me that our family originates in Spain.",
        "Q: Were they expelled in 1492 or?",
        "A: Right. There was a choice then, to convert or be expelled.",
        "Q: In fact the anniversary was just celebrated.",
        "A: Yes, 500\" anniversary. I was in Spain but this was before I knew about the ---. I was with my\nwife in Spain but this was before I know about the sign in the cavern. I have a photograph.",
        "Q: How did the family get to Poland from Spain?",
        "A: I think that the Spanish Jews, when they moved out of Spain, there was such a tremendous\nflood, that it was exile, that they were moving westward. Some of them wound up in France,\nsome went as far as Germany, Italy. Italy already had some Jews from before that existed from\nthe destruction of, even before the destruction of the Temple, was a very old community there.\nThen in the 1500\u2019s, the Polish king, Kazmir the Great, thought that the Jews would be good for\nthe development of the country which was backward and invited the Jews to come. Gave them\ntheir \u2014 they became King\u2019s subjects living under his protection. So the beginning was very, you\nmight say, idyllic but it didn\u2019t continue very long.",
        "Q: We have any further reflections on this experience? Your family was in the middle of the worst\npart of the Holocaust, Warsaw in Poland. Some survived, beginning with your grandmother,\nothers --?",
        "A: She was lucky that she was sent -- in that sense she was lucky that she was sent to America. My\nuncle owes his survival in a very plain sense to my aunt, to his wife Rose, who hid him.",
        "Q: All of you who survived, to some extent, were helped by your grandmother?",
        "A: Yes, to a very great extent, because we couldn\u2019t get as far as we did if it were not for her help.",
        "Q: You had the foresight, for whatever reasons, to send to your new career, temporary career to be\nsure, as a farmer?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: I also noticed in your story, that it seemed that at several junctures your path took you to\nLublin? Not voluntarily every time but ---?",
        "A: Yes. Lublin figures very prominently in my memory, First of all, if this is not apparent in my\nbook, I want you to know that Lublin Jewry was one of the most hospitable communities I have\nknown. They took such great care of the refugees and they were inundated with people during\nthe blitz of 1939. When we came there from this agricultural school, we went to the synagogue\nand we were living there. People were bringing us meals like regular meals. They took it as a\nresponsibility on themselves. They did it with a very pleasant demeanor and very graciously.\nMy father, when I met with my father, one of the family offered us a place to stay. So I didn\u2019t\nhave to sleep in the synagogue anymore on the hard bench. I went and stayed with my father.\nOf course, the Rosenbaum family became like a family away from the family. I did have a\nromantic notion about the girl that figures in the book, Gina, although prematurely probably, but\ndefinitely ---. I idealized her because she was such a pretty and smart girl and talented too. She\ncould play piano. I taught her how to play chess and she right away, beat me. We were there\nduring the war. I was there probably from -- I knew her from September 12\", I think, the day\nthat I came to Lublin until we left for Warsaw. Then, of course, I was drawn back there under\nthe pretext that I want to go to the Russian zone and my parents didn\u2019t object. I came back to\nLublin already under German occupation and I was again welcomed and hospitality was\nextended to me by the Rosenbaums. Then, the next time was when I was being taken to this\nfarm work. You remember, when I was a volunteer, for the harvest, I also got to see Gina.\nLater on when I got fever, I got sick, and came back to Lublin, I was shown again hospitality.\nThey brought me, they really cared for me and nursed me there when I was very sick. I got\nmeasles at seventeen, 1s no fun. It\u2019s not fun at any time but not then. But being a contagious\nsickness, they were very kind that they wanted to do this. At one time, my brother, when he\ncame out to see me in those estates, he also stopped over there in Lublin and was shown\nhospitality there. Very kind people and they all perished. The father died during the Lublin\noccupation days, probably from ill health but the mother and daughter, Gina, the girl that I\nknew, they were shot 1n cold blood.",
        "Q: An aisle of beauty in a harsh world.",
        "A: She was very remarkable. I had to really condense in the book, I couldn\u2019t express all my\nsentiment and the feeling for them that was much greater. I felt that sometimes you say more\nby understating it than if you were to try and pour it all out.",
        "Q: Believe me, it shows.",
        "A: It shows. Because I felt that the intelligent reader will see; this will be like a soldier who goes\ninto battle what great things he did there. It is not so much that it would reflect on\nme but it is not necessary to emphasize the qualities because they are -- you can easily conclude\nthat these were fine people and very dear to me. As a matter of fact, I had a photograph of Gina\nand I think I had a photograph of her mother too, that I carried with me all through my\ninternment in Pilani and Ocencia and Budzyn. But when we came to Majdanek, they took\neverything away from me. They took every vestige of your personal life so that when they\ndress you up in those striped uniforms and the wooden shoes, you didn\u2019t have anything tangible\nwhich would connect you with the past except your memory.",
        "Q: I knew you didn\u2019t have a photo of her because I knew that if you did, she would be in the ID\nproject.",
        "A: She would be a very good candidate. I think that perhaps this is just my suspicious mind\nperhaps but I think that her beauty had something to do with her undoing. Because I know\nsomething of the man who was the son of the owner who was already a married man only he\nstayed there; that something like this, especially a vulgar individual, that this would not escape\nhis attention, that this might have been the reason they were forced to run away from the farm.\nWhoever killed them were either the people that had something to do with the farm or someone\ntipped them off.",
        "Q: Poles in any case?",
        "A: Yes, in that case, Poles. You know Poles were capable of many admirable things on individual\nbasis. There were some exceptional cases like this salesgirl in Sevek\u2019s store, this Loja. Her\nname is Loja and she did a remarkable service to them because she, when they were already in\nhiding in this place called Tr and I hope I got that right, she had to bring, every\nmonth money for ---. They couldn\u2019t pay in advance because then they would take the money\nand their life would not be -- the life would not be safe. I mean you cannot say in every case,\nbut it happened many times when the Jews came in and gave everything to the owners and then\nthe owners gave them away anyway after they kept the money. So here she was coming in\nevery month to bring the money. She was also going and buying produce for the family, for the\nwhole family, vegetables because they did not want to arouse suspicion in the local store. They\nsuddenly buy so much when they were buying much less without these people. So they had to\ngo some distance away to another town, to a big town to buy the produce and food for the\nhousehold. Hi story is a book in itself. How they made the hiding place; he told me, for\ninstance, that they had to saw the boards off the floor. They were on the ground floor and there\nwas just a dugout beneath. It was not deep enough to really live there so they had to do two\nthings. They had to saw and sawing makes noise. There were people living directly above\nthem. How would they do it? The daughter of this woman where they stayed played piano,\nperhaps the mother. She played piano very loud piece while he was sawing the boards, loud\npiece. Then they had to find out how they were going to get rid of the sand that they dig up.\nThis is always shown in those escape pictures when they fantasize about it or they take it in\ntheir pants. It had to go out with the garbage pail, had to go to the garbage. I think they also --\nhe told me something about coal being there where they used some of that sand. They had a\ncoal bin someplace that was accessible to them. At one time, the Germans came in to this\napartment, officers and they requisitioned one room. The room was next room where they were\ndown in the bottom. They, my cousin Sevek, he regarded this as an insurance that the Germans\nlived there. No other German detachment will come and search the place.",
        "Q: They would be above suspicion?",
        "A: They would be above suspicion and they stayed there. But it put great restraint on them\nbecause usually --. He told me that during the wintertime, they would be sitting in a dugout but\nat night, they went to bed. In other words, there was like one spare bed. The only people that\nknew that they existed there was the mother, the wife of the guy that arranged this, this is the\nfellow that was from the Polish underground with the Socialist party and he was working in a\ntransportation department in Warsaw. His wife, the housekeeper and the daughter and the son.\nThe son worked for the Germans in one of the warehouses and he was stealing. At one time\nthey came and arrested him and he disappeared without a trace, took him to Auschwitz, maybe\nthey killed him.",
        "Q: If they knew he was stealing certainly they would ---?",
        "A: It was very stupid of him especially if since they had someone there. What if they started\nsearching the house for stolen goods and they would find the place? Because they had it cut out\nand it was covered with a little carpet rug and this is how they lived. Very interesting the way\nthey had to arrange; everything had to be thought out. All the time, during the daytime, he\nwould standing by the window and looking out who is coming through the gate. Whenever he\nseen \u2014 because this was not a single family dwelling, it was like a quadruplex and there were\nothers living on the second floor, but he had to see who comes to the main entrance of the\napartment. Always watching, if it was a stranger right away he and his wife had to go, get the\nunderneath. My uncle lived the same way because he was in my aunt\u2019s apartment but she had a\ndormer apartment so there was a false, there was a wall, and between the wall and a pitched\nroof. There was airspace. What they do, they cut out an opening and there was a mirror that had\nfour special attachment points. Every time that he suspected, heard steps on the stairway or\nsomething, he had to jump into that -- behind that mirror where they had a chair to sit on and\njust secure the mirror and hope that nobody gets wise to it.",
        "Q: But in Warsaw, this was not possible. Warsaw was infinitely more dangerous. Apparently the\nonly time it was possible to hide was after the destruction of the ghetto and after the defeat of\nthe Polish rebellion, talking about your uncle.",
        "A: Yes, he was involved in the revolution. He came out of hiding and he fought with them. But\nafter it was crushed and all the Polish people were shipped to concentration camps or labor\ncamps, Warsaw was virtually emptied of people, there were people like my uncle who lived like\nscavengers on the ruins of the --. Because after emptying Warsaw, Hitler gave orders to destroy\nWarsaw.",
        "Q: Raze the quarter?",
        "A: Right. So Warsaw was a --they claimed it was something like 65%, all the buildings were then\ndestroyed, or 60%.",
        "Q: No matter how resourceful a person had been, they had hidden, they still would not have\nsurvived, given that type of ---?",
        "A: As long as they were deep underground, literally underground.",
        "Q: There would be a food problem?",
        "A: A food problem. This 1s why -- he had to out --they were going usually at night because the\nplace was completely abandoned. Occasionally a patrol would pass by, then they would hide.\nBut he lived there from the end of the uprising which was probably, the uprising was in August-",
        "Q: Beginning of October, it was over.",
        "A: It was over so from the beginning of October until January when the Russians crossed the\nVistula River onto the west bank to Warsaw, he led this kind of existence. This apparently\ncaused his premature death because he died being about 65 in California and he died of some\nkind of liver ailment which might have been caused by the garbage that he had to eat at one\ntime.",
        "Q: If you had to tell of the worst memory that you have, the worst experience that you had, what\nwould it be? In Warsaw, in camps and so forth?",
        "A: My God, there were so many. Of course, I was flogged but this was not the worst. The worst\nexperience happened in Majdanek, I think. When we arrived there, we were shipped from the\nLuftwaffe camp, Canjan were taken to Majdanek and on this train ride we were debating what\nto do. Most of us were young men; there were a few fathers among the young men that were\nwith their sons in that group. We were fortunate that we were only 88 to a boxcar, where else\nthere were about twice that number that they packed in others. Many people perished just from\nsuffocation when they --. We were debating what we should do, whether we should break out.\nThe train left about, with our contingent, about noontime, perhaps shortly before noon and was\njust meandering through the various places as it was going. We said like this, that if it is going\nto go in Treblinka, we have nothing to lose. We are just going to have to escape. I know that\nthere were people there already working on the floorOboards, trying to see if we could -- a novel\nway of escape trying to get out from the floor boards rather than the windows that were\nnormally used. They worked at it. I don\u2019t think that they did get very far with this operation\nbecause within 15 or 20 minutes we found out that we are on a line to Lublin, not Treblinka.\nWe felt that perhaps we are being taken to another labor camp. We didn\u2019t know that besides\nAuschwitz and Treblinka that there are so many death camps, we didn\u2019t know. We didn\u2019t know,\nmaybe we didn\u2019t want to know. We heard about the camps, like Sobibor. Once this was found\nout, so the attitude changed and the despair that dominated the mood in the boxcar subsided and\nthey say maybe we are going to the camp. People sort of tried to slide down because we\ncouldn\u2019t -- there was not enough room for everyone to sit or lie down but if everybody lean\nagainst everyone, somehow, the body sort of, like sardines, we were able to manage to be down\nwhere we could get some rest. Everybody got very thirsty because the boxcars, the sun beat on\nthem and it was hot. There was a fellow there with a bottle of water, He took out the bottle of\nwater that he had the presence of mind to take with him. We had bread that we took with us,\nour rations, but we didn\u2019t think of water, we did not think of that -- we didn\u2019t think of it, we\ndidn\u2019t anticipate that 1t would be needed here, a big bottle of water. He was going to have some\nof the water with his son. But when he looked at the faces of us all, he says, no, no, my son,\nwe'll have to share this water. Somehow a spoon was produced and everybody got a tablespoon\nof water. This is the way it went all around. But the moment, I think my moment of greater\ndespair came at the end of the journey because I could say when I stood in Lublin before a\nfiring squad, was this the worst moment? No, because it happened so quickly and it came as a\nsurprise. Before we got scared enough, become numb. It was all over. I was also, a gun was\npointed at me in Lublin on a railroad station by a drunk, an SS officer. This ended up without\nme being shot. But here we\u2019re traveling on this train and there\u2019s time on our hands and we were\nable to think. Then it got dark and darker. Finally the train slowed down and it was already\nbeyond, not quite so dark that you couldn\u2019t see but it was already further along than the dust,\nthe hour of twilight when you can still see things relatively well. The train -- there was also\nanother incident. During the ride on the train, a Polish peasant stood when the train was very\nslowly moving after many stops that it made to give priority to other trains. He seen our train\nand he crossed himself. So I said why would he do this unless we are a cargo assigned to\nextermination. I say after all, going to a labor camp still leaves -- there is room for hope.\n(End of Tape 11.)\nThe movement of the train, very slow movement, when the train is --when they are moving\nsections of the train on the final terminal; there\u2019s more literally, this is literally what terminal is\nthe right word to use, the train was moving very slowly. You have the descending darkness, you\nsee that we are being pushed through a tall masonry wall. It suddenly, it gave me the\nforeboding that we are being brought into the extermination point, because we were not given\nany rations for the trip; people were packed like sardines. If you want to get work out of slaves,\nyou have to give them living room, you have to treat them with a modicum of satisfying the\nbasic needs of subsistence to live on. No water, nothing given for us to urinate or to tend to all\nother needs that are basic needs and suddenly this descending darkness and the train slowly --\nthe train -- like we were going through the gates of hell.",
        "Q: That\u2019s exactly what I was imagining.",
        "A: And the train came to a stop. When the train was traveling, we couldn\u2019t hear nothing because\nyou just hear the noise of the railroad tracks and the rails and the wind and so forth. But when\nthe train stopped, you could hear the screams of the women and children in other boxcars where\nthey had women and children, where they were packed very heavily. Because the heat was\nunbearable and they had no room to urinate, they had no room for anything. There was crying\nand lamenting and it all suggested a premonition of impending death by some means that we\ndon\u2019t know yet; whether it will be gas chambers or they have something else in store for us.\nThen on the platforms, which on the right and a platform on the left which separated us from\nthe other section of the train, there were big floodlights and there were guards that were\nstanding on both sides. Were just maybe two or three guards. All of a sudden you hear the\nsound of a rolling door open and a man, stripped down to his trunks, runs out of this heat. He\njust runs and the Germans, the German guards, they begin to hunt him like a rabbit. He says,\nIch , Lhave him! He says , halt. This and so forth, then you hear two shots\nand you see this guy collapsing underneath one of those floodlights. By that time the\ntemperature must have dropped, this was in May, and you could see like a steam coming out\nfrom his mouth, the blood was running out of his neck. He was laying there, a human being.\nAll he wanted was a little air and he was shot for that. When I seen this, this scene itself was a -\n-I seen people killed before by the Germans. I have seen them in the Warsaw Ghetto but I have\nnever seen this, when you put all these elements together, under such circumstances. Then the\nimmediate logical conclusion is that we are not coming into any labor camp. If you begin to\nadd all these things and as the morning began to dawn, there was a rabbi in our boxcar. We\nhave a prayer that is said before death; it 1s called confession before death, people say it. He\nbegan to say the confession and he had a younger brother, Hanok was his name. That guy\nbegan to cry that he is only twenty years old. This crying and praying became very unnerving\nto us although a man has a right to say what he wants before he dies. We were still not\nconvinced that this is the end of the line. Nevertheless somebody asked them that they should\nstop this sobbing business and all this, wait to see what happens in the morning. In the\nmorning, when they open the boxcars, there came a Jewish crew that was working and the\nGermans and the dogs, the whole circus. They began to open the doors of the car and they\nbegin to pile out the dead bodies from the boxcars. Ours was the only boxcar that didn\u2019t have\nany dead bodies but from all other cars, they were putting the bodies. The Jewish crew went in\nand they were putting the bodies by stacking them in pyres, one on top of the other in squares. I\nseen young women, young men, it was just a frightening sight when you see so much death\naround you. We were bewildered -- there were two hand grenades laying on the bottom of our\nfloor. In other words, one of the -- some of our men had hand grenades and they were prepared\nto make a fight for it, if we escaped. If we escaped and went to the woods, we would have\nsomething; I mean that was the intention. I remember when we empty the car, the SS men take\na look in the car; they seen the hand grenades and they ignored it. This was the final indication\nthat we are slated for death because if we are not, they would certainly not allow something like\nthis to go unpunished. They would want a guilty party and they would make an execution; they\nwould try to show how they deal with something like this.",
        "Q: You\u2019re all guilty already?",
        "A: It doesn\u2019t matter because we---. Then we were put in a, those that survived the trip were put in\na column five abreast. The column was standing there and forming. While they were forming\nand we seen that the crew---. Another thing 1s the cleaning crew that was working there, the\nJews who were part of the crew of this camp, they wouldn\u2019t speak to us. If we ask them, where\nare we? What is awaiting us? They didn\u2019t say anything. So you got the impression like you\nwere on an operating table; you are in a hospital and you see the nurses in white aprons looking\nat you as though you were dead already. We didn\u2019t know that they were not allowed to speak to\nus, we didn\u2019t know that. Then the column began to form and there were about a dozen of SS\nmen on each side of the column, guards with rifles. They were going to escort us wherever we\nwere going to go. We begin the procession, slowly. When I was walking, I was bewildered,\nwhat was happening there? My thoughts were very incoherent, in a situation like this. The SS\nman that was on my left, that was next to me, I record this in the book, he said to me, Veir albist\ndu?, how old are you? I said, Ich bin I told him I was 18 years old. He answered me\nI , 1m nineteen.. He says , It\u2019s a pity that you have to die. He said it to\nme, he meant it; he had no---. That was \u2014 this is the way he felt apparently. We were\neventually separated from those that went to the gas chambers; but this moment, these moments\nin my life, including this question and answer and the pile-up of bodies in the morning and a\nbeautiful morning to be surrounded by death, this arrival; this 1s probably the worst that I had to\nface. Because after that I became already immune to these -- not immune but I began to realize\nthat sooner or later they\u2019re going to get us. That there\u2019s a very slim chance of survival. So I\nwas not going to get again -- I would not panic anymore in a situation that was awaiting.",
        "Q: You think the worst and then you survive, then it\u2019s almost a bonus?",
        "A: Well, for some people who survived that particular moment was not the best thing because they\nperished later and they just suffered more. But this was such a terrifying thing, this whole\nthing, the arrival, the descending darkness, the crying of the women, the pitiful crying of the\nchildren, and then the killing of that man who just run for a breath of fresh air, the prayers of the\nrabbi who survived, he lives in Pittsburgh. I met him in Israel one time unexpectedly, and his\nbrother survived. All these things are just terrifying more than anything else that I have\nexperienced before or since. Although I had many close calls after, I was with a flogged person;\nit didn\u2019t affect me as badly as this. I\u2019m not going to tell you how we got out of this situation\nbecause then nobody\u2019s going to buy my book.",
        "Q: We won\u2019t go into that. I was going to recall from another interview that I had, that there was an\norchestra at Majdanek, perhaps not at this point. But it seems that was all that is lacking---.",
        "A: I thought Auschwitz had the orchestra.",
        "Q: An orchestra was at Auschwitz but apparently there was one also at Majdanek, perhaps at the\nlabor camp. But you\u2019re talking about 1942.",
        "A: Forty-three.",
        "Q: Forty-three but early---?",
        "A: May 12\" or May 13\".",
        "Q: But you don\u2019t recall any orchestra at the camp?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: I don\u2019t think 1t would have been at this point in the camp. It would have been somewhere else,\nlike a work area at the labor section.",
        "A: Could be because we were not, unbeknown to us, we were not in the camp proper. We were in\nthe entrance camp and the reason they had the guards because they had to march us yet through\na street which I think is called Helmska B because it leads to hell. That would take us\nto Majdanek and to the gas chambers. This was our fate. I studied the records of it from a book\nthat was written of Majdanek, by a Polish writer. It\u2019s not translated into English yet. I bought it\nin Poland when I was there. It said in that period of time, there were no registrations,\neverybody was going -- especially from the Warsaw Ghetto -- everybody was going straight\ninto the gas chambers. Actually I was twice in Majdanek. At this time when we were sent to\nBudzyn and when we were shipped to Budzyn en route to Plaszow, we detoured in Majdanek so\nI was their guest again. I omitted telling you -- it occurred to me that I omitted telling you --\nsomething about my uncle Meynek. As you know, we came to Budzyn from this transport in\nsecond week of May. That would put it about May 13 or thereabout. When we arrived there,\nwe found out that there was already one group of Warsaw survivors, Warsaw Ghetto uprising\nsurvivors who arrived there a week earlier. One of the survivors, I believe his name was\nKaufmann, a young fellow my age, recognized me and he said I got something to tell you about\nyour Uncle Meynek. He was in our transport with his wife, that would be Irka on the\numschlagplatz after the crushing of the Warsaw Ghetto uprising, they were herded on the\numschlagplatz into boxcars. While he was in the boxcar with his wife, he was trying to bribe a\nUkrainian guard, either to let him go which seems very unlikely; it seemed very unlikely that he\nwould have asked him for it. Or he might have asked him for water because they were selling\nwater for something like 500 zlotys a glass if they got the money. However, the Ukrainian\nguard after taking the money, shot my uncle and his wife, Irka, pulled off his riding boots from\nhis legs, feet, and this is how my uncle came to an end. I believe he was born 1907, he would\nhave -- this was in May of 1943, he would have been 36 years old. This is the story of our\nfamily. We had very few survivors. That would be my Uncle Ben survived, my Aunt Rose\nsurvived because she was on Aryan papers and she was able to hide her identity and the only\nother survivor was myself and my grandmother who left Poland on the last ship that reached the\nUnited States. My father died in Majdanek, now we know, my mother and my youngest\nbrother, Meir at Treblinka. Szymon still remains as enigma, as to what happened to him.",
        "Q: Still waiting or hoping for a miracle?",
        "A: Yes, it\u2019s hard to imagine that this late, we would not have been able to establish contact. Since\neven if he lived in Spain, he would know that most survivors went either to Israel or the United\nStates or Canada and he would have tried to exhaust these things. There were no enquiries for\nme.",
        "Q: And then there\u2019s your book, too.",
        "A: Yes.",

        "A: But you know what? All this brings me to this understanding --that we, the Jewish people, are\nvery old people. We have survived rising and falling civilizations. The Germans were trying to\nput an end to the Jewish people in a most barbaric way in the annals of mankind. They didn\u2019t\nsucceed and I don\u2019t think that any ruthless dictatorship would, in the future, succeed. But they\nnever stop trying. Okay, I think that we had enough.",

    "answers": [
        "A: Good afternoon.",
        "A: Well, I was born in Warsaw to a well- to- do family on November 3, 1924 and I was brought up\nat home. We had a villa in Shaborov which was about 20 minutes train ride from Warsaw in the\ncountry where I would spend the summers. Later on I went to a Hebrew academy in Warsaw\nand went through my grade school there, and had my Bar Mitzvah in Warsaw in the great\nsynagogue and remember playing in the parks and doing the things that kids do. I had two\nbrothers. My younger brother was named Syzmon. He was born in 1928, 27, excuse me, and\nwas roughly three years younger than me and I had another brother Meir who was born when I\nwas already nine years old, in 1934. I remember his birthday in particular because it just so\nhappens that my grandmother's sister and her husband and their young daughter, about my age,\ncame for a visit to Warsaw from America and it was a big event in our lives to see the\nAmericans visiting us. So despite the language barrier between us kids; because they could\nspeak Yiddish, you know, the grandparents could speak Yiddish and my parents could speak, it\nwas something of a sensation in our home to see, you know we were not used yet to see kids\nthat were not disciplined, sort of dominate the attention of the whole household. And after\ngraduating what you would call elementary school in Warsaw, I was admitted to gymnasium,\nwhich is high school and went there for one year. But about that time, the clouds of war began\nto gather and my father thought of sending me to agricultural school. I guess the reasoning\nbehind that decision was the fact, well there were several considerations. One, that I was not\ndoing so greatly in gymnasium.",
        "A: Except for history which I took genuine interest. I didn't show great promise at that time. I\ndon't know in what order of urgency these considerations came but there was the consideration\nthat Poland, they came and for the Jews and my father already at that time, I think\nAustria was already next to Germany, and Czechoslovakia was next in the frying pan and\nblackmailed by Hitler at the time, you know the whole incident with Sudetenland and so forth,\nthat served as a pretext for German aggression there. At any rate, my father felt that\nimmigration became imperative for us and he felt that someone with a farming background\nwould have a greater chance of being admitted to a foreign country than a merchant or\nprofessional. I don't know just how true that was but farmers were always readily admitted to\ncountries like South America and Canada. Canada was then considered unpopulated and my\nfather mentioned Canada as one of the possibilities of our immigration. So the decision was\nmade that I should become a farmer or at least I should learn farming and I was sent to that\nschool in a place called Wajenuswolinsky {ph 55} about 350 kilometers southeast of Warsaw\nand I began my education in farming there.",
        "A: This was the summer of 1938 because I arrived there just in time for harvest which was the\nworst period from the standpoint of work, the fact that we had to work nothing like we consider\nwork today, from sunrise to sunset. But once the harvest was over, then we began class work.\nAs the season neared winter, work was progressively reduced and class work increased. And\nthat\u2019s the way it went. But of course, I never graduated from school because the war broke out.",
        "A: Well, I was not too much enamored by the work in the field but I did like work with the\nanimals, with horses and cows and other animals we had there on the farm. I found it very\ninteresting and I became a very good student there, too, so that school had from a standpoint of\nmy upbringing and maturing, had a very favorable effect on my attitude towards learning and\nmany other things. So much so far that I surprised my parents when they saw my school report.",
        "A: There were only Jewish students at this school. This school was under the auspices of an\norganization called Tarbot which I think is Hebrew name for culture and the principle objective\nthere was to train Jews in agriculture so they can immigrate to Palestine and become farmers.\nThis was also a consideration even though my father when he mentioned Canada as a possible\nplace for our immigration, he considered Palestine as well but unfortunately, the British then\nhad a policy of, a restricted policy of immigration to Palestine and it is a strange thing that when\nwe mention today Palestine, today Palestine has a completely different connotation. In WW II.\nThe Palestine brigade that fought with the British 8\" Army, consisted of Jews alone from\nPalestine, from Israel as it became. Now the connotation conjures visions of intifada and\nmayhem and gang of cutthroats, you know that are",
        "A: Anti-Jewish. Right.",
        "A: Zionist orientated. It was, you might say it was soft on religion, aspect of it, but the religious\nlife in the school was accented to a certain degree and all the holidays were observed and so\nforth. I remember that we did not work in the fields on a Sunday, besides Saturday, also not on\nSunday in order not to offend the Christian peasants 1n the area, to respect because it was their\nday of rest. So we were only working internally on the grounds, on the grounds proper.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: It was mainly Zionist oriented and graduate students went to Palestine after finishing this\nschool. In fact, there was a reunion of survivors of that school in Israel in 1966, 1967 I think\nand I happened to be there for the Bar Mitzvah of my second son, Matthew and we found out\nthat there were about half a dozen survivors, all of them living in Israel except me, so they made\nit. They joked around and they said \u201c Topas remained the only Zionist among us\u201d. Because I\nwas living in America and they were there and they served in the Israeli army, one of them\nachieved a very high rank in the army. And only one of the fellows that graduated the farming\nschool remained a farmer.",
        "A: Yes. I had my sites set for Palestine. It was something very attractive to us, to be in a land that\nhistorically we take our roots from and for a couple of millennium there was a continuous\nhistory of the Jewish people and since we are persona non grata in Poland, in most of the\ncountries of the world in general, then Palestine loomed very largely in our consideration.",
        "A: I have never been exposed to, I have been only once in public school for a very brief period,\none year that my mother sent me to public school. I don\u2019t remember the circumstances. But\nother than that, I was always going, for instance, the primary school that I went to, the prep\nschool so to speak was a Hebrew academy, one of the most modern of it\u2019s kind and had a\nreligious orientation. Modern. Then I went to gymnasium henu which the Hebrew word\ndenotes upbringing, you know. Then I went to this Tarbot School and I think the reason they\nsent me there was they wanted me to be in a traditionally Jewish environment.",
        "A: Well the religious life with the family is really interesting in itself. To that extent that my\ngrandparents were assimilated on my father\u2019s side, not my mother\u2019s side. But since the\ngrandparents on my mother\u2019s side lived in a distance away from us in Forst we didn\u2019t have\nmuch contact with them. But in Warsaw, we virtually lived with our grandparents. We were\nliving in the same apartment building. My grandparents were assimilated; they did not observe\nthe Jewish holidays according to the law, meaning our stores were open on Saturday; although\nholidays like Passover and others were observed, they were observed to the extent they didn\u2019t\ninterfere with business. And my father was a very strong opponent of assimilation himself and\nhe sort of fashioned himself or fancied himself as a Polish patriot. So in 1920 during the\nBolshevik invasion, he joined the Polish militia at the age of 16, probably not telling exactly the\ntruth about his age. He was so bent to have a part of it you know in defense of Warsaw. But as\nhe matured, he was exposed to the anti-Semitism that the assimilation did not make a damn bit\nof difference to the anti-Semites. All the Jews are the same. So he was a thinking individual.\nOne of his pastimes, his contemporaries told me was going to courts and listening to trials\nbecause he liked the idea of logic expressed and the questions of law, questions of morality,\nquestions of right and wrong, very interested, good and evil. So eventually, eventually, he\nbecame aware that, or he came to the conclusion, that assimilation for the Jews as a means of\nacceptance in a non-Jewish society was a failure and he felt 1t was a bankrupt. Although many\npeople at the time majority disagreed with him and he was a maverick in his belief. So at time\nalready when I had reached the age of 7, he became religious.",
        "A: He might have concluded earlier but this was when he had made the move. And our house\nbecame kosher and so forth. Because in my childhood we had a Christmas tree and we were\nwell-to-do so it was fashionable at that time to hire German governesses because they were so\nclean and disciplined and so forth and I remember kneeling and clasping my hands to say a\nprayer in German. This was in Warsaw. But this radically has changed. For my father became\nreligious and began to realize that the values that are contained in our tradition now, Torah and\nour bible, are the values that are endurable, they are tested and that society, it is to benefit not\nonly to the Jews but to mankind to live by a law when morality is supreme, not other things.",
        "A: It was a major change. In fact, I remember exactly the time when my father made me aware\nthat Iam a Jew. Because I was sheltered you know in my life in Warsaw and in schools and I\nwas not exposed to the, I never found myself in a situation where I was exposed to anti-\nSemitism nor did I understand what it really meant. We lived in Poland so I was Polish. That\u2019s\nthe way I understood it. But one time when we were in our country in the summer, I might\nhave been then seven, that I recall that towards evening my father called me to the bedroom and\nhe told me to sit down. I want to talk to you and he told me very briefly that we are Jewish and\nthat we were enslaved in Egypt because this is the core of our belief and of the historical,\nfactual tenets of our belief and that we were taken out of Egypt to become a free people., to\nbecome a people to be a light to the nations. He said a few things that were just beyond me\nperhaps but then I came to learn this and I was taken out of the school I was going to and I was\nsent to a more religious oriented school. And we underwent a revolution and somewhere we\nwere alienated from our larger family circle because of my father\u2019s change.",
        "A: You are very observant. That is exactly what happened. When I gave you the names, I told you\nthat my name was Yusick because I was born in the era when my father was in the mood of\ngiving Polish names and my brother\u2019s name was given originally in Stanislav although his\nHebrew name that was given at his circumcision was Szymon just as mine was Benjamin Josef\nfor Joseph Benjamin. But when my third brother was born, it was already in the era when my\nfather\u2019s orientation was completely changed, the name that was given to him was Meir, after my\ngrandfather\u2019s father. He was brought in completely different atmosphere from birth.",
        "A: I think that I would have to say yes, as a strict father. Although he could have been quite\nrelaxed, you know, and forgiving on occasions, but he was strict. He believed that the key word\nwe have to focus our attention is righteousness. To him, this is all and all -- to be right, to be\nmoral, to be truthful. He felt that our civilization as we know it stands or falls with our ability\nto comprehend that. That this is significant. Of course, today, this is all turned upside down by\nthe new social science engineering which says everything goes and everybody can have his own\nstyle and so forth.",
        "A: My mother came from a religious home but she was somewhat of a rebel. Perhaps not\nconsciously so but it was simply a question of economics. She was born as one of four sisters\nto a family where the head of the household, meaning her father, my grandfather, Hersh Aram,\nwas a hat maker. And he was a working person and he was also Talmudist, studist. When he\nwas not working he was spending his time in a house of study, in a religious house of study.\nNow, she did not see any, this is by conjecture, she didn\u2019t see future in following this tradition.\nBecause they didn\u2019t have big dowries. At that time, dowries had to be given with daughters to\nanybody who was worth his weight in salt.",
        "A: Yeah, four daughters and she was the second in lineage. Three of the four daughters went into\nthe professions because they have seen they have to establish some economic independence.\nThere was just no future for them in the town. Excuse me, in the town. It is still a town. It is\nnow even more significant. I guess Poland calls it the capital of petro chemicals in Poland.\nAnd I revisited the town when I was there in 1989 and I found the apartment where my\ngrandparents lived and possibly where they brought up these four daughters. Now, this, in the\nUnited States would be way below poverty level because the whole apartment consisted of one\nroom and a kitchen and six people lived there. It is just hard to believe. And I remember\nvisiting there on Passover and my father would take us there and they were always\nimmaculately clean. Everything was so perfect -- they didn\u2019t have running water. They didn\u2019t\nhave a bathroom, no plumbing there. It was just a bewilderment when we first came to visit.\nMy father already became religious at that time because before, we didn\u2019t go there. And it was\ncontrast of two worlds that were completely, you know, there was the cosmopolitan Warsaw\nwith floors that were polished to a mirror shine with two maids in my grandma\u2019s home and\nplumbing and a bidet in the bathroom and all the conveniences and amenities of modern living.\nWhereas in Proust, it was backwards, only by contrast and they had to live there very frugally.\nSo my mother must have realized early in her life that her future lie with her ability to support\nherself and to make something of herself, other than just being a woman and going through the\nbiological process. Her older sister Franya, you\u2019 ll find out in my book, they\u2019re in furniture,\nyou'll find out that she had two boys and she was married to a painting contractor but she\nherself was a teacher. My mother was going for law but she married a wealthy husband, a well-\nto-do husband, a merchant, a businessman and Idacha the younger sister became a CPA, you\nknow a public accountant. I don\u2019t know if she was certified, 1f such a thing.",
        "A: She was definitely a notary and she was also a bookkeeper. And the youngest one was with the\nfamily. I don\u2019t think she went in to a profession; she remained at home and never married.\nThey all perished in the Holocaust, except my grandfather who died a few years before the war.\nThe youngest daughter\u2019s name was Razel. So this was the background. When my mother came\nto Warsaw, she in the university in the school of law. In other words, you must\nrealize that I believe that only 5 or 3% of the Jews could be admitted to any state institution.\nShe had first to get through high school, an eight year course. As she said in her own\napplication here the document that I obtained from the archives, she says on her basis of her\nentry examination she was admitted to the state\u2019s gymnasium. She covered a course of 8+\ncourse in 7 or 8 years, perhaps in 7 years. And then she was admitted to University of Warsaw.\nBefore, they had this clause about bench clause and father restrictions but there were still\nrestrictions about how many Jews could be admitted. And she had two handicaps -- being\nJewish and being a woman.",
        "A: By Warsaw standards. So in order to support herself, one of the jobs she had was a tutor to the\nTopas boys. So she was a tutor to my father and his brother Itzak and his youngest brother\nwhich was my uncle Ben. And this is how people fell in love with the tutor.\nA; Well, the results were predictable.",
        "A: He must have been. And he married very young. My mother at the time was 23 and he was 19\nwhen they married.",
        "A: Indeed, it was not. As I understand it in retrospect, they were very much opposed to it, because\nin Europe it was not like in the United States where you have misalliances between rich and\npoor and between professional and non-professional. There was a class-consciousness, even\namong Jews so that it was unlikely that a person from a well-to-do family would marry\nsomeone from a very poor family by contrast. And my grandparents were opposing too on the\nground that the fact that they wanted someone from a more prestigious family than some\nobscure town in Poland and they didn\u2019t like the idea that my mother was older than he. Four\nyears older. They didn\u2019t like that. But apparently they were overruled.",
        "A: Probably by my father. He wanted to have his way. My mother was never very happy living in\nsuch close proximity to my father\u2019s family because she realized the objection and she realized\nshe was married over these objections.",
        "A: My father\u2019s brothers were not affected by this religious revolution and my uncle Neteck which\nwas the second in line was a very handsome bachelor as you can see from the existing\nphotographs, who was a bachelor for a long time and didn\u2019t get married until probably maybe a\nyear or two before the outbreak of WWII and his position in the company was that he had the\njob of administrator of the properties that my grandparents possessed, owned, and he was also\nthe head bookkeeper in the company that fabricated shoes, Topaz Shoe Company. But I have\nvery fond memories of my uncle the bachelor. Bachelors have money. Married people have\nresponsibilities and bills. And he lived with the grandparents. So my brother Szymon and I and\nmy cousin Lela, which was the daughter of my father\u2019s sister Bella Necovyak who lived with\nthem there, we would come on Sunday morning when my dear uncle Neteck was still sleeping\nin his room from the Saturday night outing trying to recover, we would be waiting for him to\nwake up sort of helping the process and then we would mooch from him movie money for the\nmatinee to go and see the movie. And we would scan the daily paper to tell him what are the\nchoices and he would open one eye and say are you here already. And he knew to buy his peace\nhe had top give us some movie money and then we would ask him for transportation for the\nstreetcars. Sometimes he would say, \u201cIt\u2019s such a beautiful day, why don\u2019t you go to the park?\u2019\n\u201cWhy do you always have to go to the movie?\u201d That is one of my fond memories that he was\nvery generous that way. I also remember that he bought me my first two -wheeler. My parents\nprobably couldn\u2019t afford it, even though they were well off but they had expenses.",
        "A: And kids. That means the same.",
        "A: Who is that?",
        "A: Neteck? I don\u2019t think that he distinguished himself particularly. He graduated high school. He\nmight have taken a course in bookkeeping and administration, I don\u2019t know exactly. But the\none who distinguished himself scholastically was the youngest son, Benack. He was\ndistinguished in many sports too, that\u2019s why we remember him. The newspaper clippings\nwould tell us about his prowess as a soccer player on a team called Hapoyal which was one of\nthe first line teams in Warsaw. It was a Jewish team. Hapoyal means the worker. That didn\u2019t\nsit well with my grandparents who first of all were opposed to any socialist ideas and my\ngrandmother thought it was a sheer waste of time to be engaged in sports of any kind and incur\nan injury or something like this and I understand he incurred an injury and he had blood\ninfection. But I remember that when he graduated high school and I was still then very young,\nhe didn\u2019t want to go or perhaps he couldn\u2019t get admission although he was a very good student,\nto the University of Warsaw and he wanted to go for chemical engineering. So he went to the\nPolytechnic in Prague in Czechoslovakia, and became an excellent chemist in his field. He\nsurvived the war and when he came to America he couldn\u2019t get any employment. But\neventually he got a job with Dutch copper and later on with Merck Pharmaceuticals when he\ndistinguished himself in silicone research and made some pittance for them and later on became\na director of research and went to Marshall Rectify in Los Angeles and he told me one time that\nthe rectifier that weighs about a ton made by General Electric was made by him that weighs as\nmuch as a book of matches.",
        "A: In the German Polytechnic there.",
        "A: In the 1930\u2019s, yes.",
        "\\A: He graduated before the Sudenland, before the occupation. He must have graduated around\ncirca 1937.",
        "A: Well, in fact he did graduate and he got a job with a sub clinical lab in Poland so he was\ngainfully employed as a chemical engineer.",
        "A: In Warsaw.\nQ; And what were you hoping to become: I remember you were interested in history and also you\nhad an inclination toward animal husbandry after that first experience at the college in\nsoutheastern Poland. What was on your mind to be?",
        "A: Well, once I got my feet wet in this agricultural school that my parents sent me, I really became\nfired with enthusiasm for being a farmer. I thought it was a great life, I thought it was a\nmeaningful life because being close to the soil, you are close to nature and it 1s a very healthy\nlife and since there is some ideological being associated with it because of Jews, basically we\nare a nation of farmers and freeholders. If you study ancient history, you\u2019ll find out that in it\u2019s\nclassical period, the kingdom of David and the kingdom of Solomon when the fortunes of the\nJews were at it\u2019s highest peak, most people were farmers. There were some , but\nthey didn\u2019t have a class of merchants. In fact in Israel, when they spoke of merchants, they\nspoke of Canaanites. The Canaanite merchants, they used to come to temple grounds and sell\ntrinkets or whatever it was. I am told there was a slogan, a motto that was displayed at the main\nroad leading to the school buildings as you would approach the field because we had a 50 acre\nfarm there and the name was, said in Hebrew . That means for us to return to the\nplow as we have moved from the plow to the scale, meaning to merchants. Because the Jews\nwere forced in medieval times and even in earlier times in exile, they forced out of so many\navenues of life, they couldn\u2019t own land, so they wound up as businessmen. So the stereotype of\na Jew as a businessman which emerged in Europe was not the true echoes of the Jewish people\nas it was then. At the time of Moses, that came not out of propensity of the people for that\nparticular subject but because of necessity. So I felt that we are going to turn the clock of\nhistory and we will straighten this out and we will become farmers again. Idealistic I was fired\nwith enthusiasm, not on a single argument, but on all these that I have mentioned by others but\nthat I cannot think of now.",
        "A: Yeah, medieval, social engineering.",
        "A: Well, my grandparents spoke to them in Yiddish because this was the language that was always\nused as a back up language. Also used so that we wouldn\u2019t understand it -- they wanted to say\nsomething to each other. My parents were also fluent in Yiddish so that I think this 1s the\nlanguage they used. They might have reverted to Polish because, still, my grandmother\u2019s sister\nand her husband came from Poland. They emigrated only after World War I there. They still\nremembered the language so they could speak Polish but their daughter, Jean, was a very\nbeautiful girl -- she was actually my brother\u2019s age. I remember they went for a walk in Warsaw.\nThey got lost and finally we got a call from the police station that they found them in the park.\nThey were lost and they came to the police station. Someone from the adults took a taxi and\nbrought them back. She couldn\u2019t speak Polish but she knew a little Yiddish that she picked up\nfrom her parents and we just didn\u2019t know -- we communicated by body language.",
        "A: Polish.",
        "A: Hebrew, yes, yes.",
        "A: I took German as my -- there was a choice given in gymnasium, usually in Poland. It was either\nFrench or German. There was a choice. That\u2019s besides Hebrew and, of course, besides Polish.\nSometimes they would give you an option of English. We didn\u2019t have this option. But I learned\nEnglish anyway through a tutor.",
        "A: Basically it was a Polish- speaking household.\nA; This didn\u2019t change.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Right.\nwhom? I know the name of the store was The I. Jacob Topas Store.",
        "A: Right. But I think the founders of the whole Topas Enterprises were actually my grandfather,\nJacob Topas and my grandmother Etta Sara Topas. It\u2019s hard for me to determine after such a\nlong time something that I was not private to, just exactly who had greater share in the\ndynamics of the expansion of this. But it started from a very modest beginning. Because after\nmarriage, my grandmother tried to develop the talent that my grandfather possessed. He was a\nperson who modeled ladies\u2019 shoes. He had a flair for this so she exploited him to the extent that\nshe wanted to set up a store that would manufacture handmade, custom-made shoes that would\nhave his imprint on it, his model. I think this is the way it originated. First, I think that they\nhad a place on Pyskas Street but by the time I was born they already had a flourishing store in\nWarsaw, in the same building where we had also an apartment. Later on they opened two more\nstores in Warsaw, one on Noves and one on Mar which was the main\nthoroughfare of Warsaw. But eventually, towards the time close before the outbreak of war,\nonly the main store remained functional. Because they found out that they don\u2019t need three\nstores in Warsaw, that people will come to this store. Because it was unique, because of the\nhand-made shoes. This shoe store catered to the intelligentsia and to the theater circles; people\nwho could pay a good price for a good pair of shoes. They were not inexpensive. Then we also\nopened a store in Katovitz before the outbreak of the war. My father ran that for a while but the\nPolish government forced him out by saying that they are not going to allow anybody to set up a\nstore who was not a citizen as of 1920 or something like this. Some restrictive measure that\nwere calculated against Jews, So we had to liquidate that store also about six months before the\noutbreak of the war.",
        "A: Was also economic.",
        "A: I really don\u2019t know what they used as a cutoff date as to who 1s allowed to have a store or not to\nhave a store. Because initially we had representation there, someone that had stores of shoes\nalready and was just buying our shoes because there was a demand for them. The demand was\nso great that we decided, I mean my parents and grandparents, decided that perhaps they should\nopen a store there where they can also benefit from these sales to a greater extent than\nwholesaling it. So they went ahead and did it. But this didn\u2019t sit well probably with the\nmerchants -- shoe merchants in the city and they put pressure on the officialdom to out stop us.",
        "A: There is one event in the history of our business that I only know second hand from my uncle.\nHe was closer to the center of action there than to know it. He claimed that the Polish\ngovernment had a war debt. I think probably 1920\u20141919, 1920, war with Russian Soviet\nUnion. That the Jews were disproportionately, very heavily assessed to pay this. He told me\nthat my grandfather, in the course of several years, had to pay something which would be in\nAmerican pre-dollar value, a quarter of a million dollars but in Polish currency was close to a\nmillion zlotys which was a unit of Polish currency was defined. The ratio between one was like\nfive zloty to a dollar.",
        "A: This is quite conceivable. It might have been because I know that some real estate was sold in\norder to meet that --- those demands. Because my grandparents owned land in the country\nwhere we had our villa. (End of Side A, Tape 1)\nI was mentioning the properties which my grandparents owned. They also, as I understand, had\na building in Berlin. This dates to the time that Poland was occupied; the occupation of Poland.\nThey also had an apartment house in Danzig. But by the time I was born, all these properties\nwere liquidated or sold, possibly to meet the demands of the Polish government. You know, the\nassessment as to how much of the debt is taxable to us. Poland had a peculiar labor law. It\npermitted occupation strike which meant -- in actual experience this is what happened. Our\nshoes were hand made. Most of the shoemakers which were employees were kind of the\ncottage-industry type meaning one who was the master craftsman employed journeymen and\nhelpers, apprentices in his own household. He would come to our office and get the materials\nand the models and so forth and he would bring the ready-made products and was paid for it.\nHe was paid in advance and he was paid when he finished it. If there were some corrections to\nbe made, he would have to do that too. So they were individual shoemakers, perhaps a hundred\nor so that were making the shoes for our company. Now they became members of a union. I\nremember distinctly that a few years before the war, there was a strike but they called it in\nPoland an occupation strike, which meant that they were permitted to come into the stores and\noccupy the seats that normally are reserved for the customers. Bur the strike provided that they\nhad to leave enough seats so that business can continue. Because I cannot conceive of a\ncustomer feeling comfortable in a store where there is a hostile strike.",
        "A: Conflict, right. So I recall that strike and I remember an incident there that was largely\ndiscussed and talked about later. That one of the strikers, a heavy big guy, not only did he sit on\nthe chairs but he stretched himself across several chairs to occupy. My father took him and\nforcibly threw him out the store. But the thing that struck me later is that I don\u2019t recall that any\nof the non-Jewish firms were ever affected by such a strike. This strike was eventually resolved\nand everything then returned to normal, but it was one of those things that the Jews were not the\nfirst-class citizens in Poland.",
        "A: Even if they were well off, I would imagine. Because a Jew always has to prove himself as a\ncitizen. For instance, when the threat of war loomed against Poland and the Jews wanted to\nshow their loyalty, especially against Germany so there is in a book called Image Before My\nEyes by Lucien Dobritsky, there is a photograph of a Jew donating actually a military aircraft to\nthe Polish air force as a show of patriotism. But it didn\u2019t help.",
        "A: But they said -- the Polish parliament, which was only debating since the death of Puchentsky,\nwas only debating I should say since 1935, was only debating the Jewish problem and attributed\nall the economic reverses or problems to the Jewish question of being a large majority there.\nAlthough the largest majority were really Ukrainians, minority I mean.",
        "A: Were Ukrainians. But this was most of -- the Jews disturbed them.",
        "A: Because they made it so. This was what was debated. When a Jewish member of their\nparliament, their Same as they called it, came out and he said that we should confront; we\nshould unite and should confront a common enemy; so the response was that these are two\nseparate questions. That the Jewish question and the German question have nothing to do with\nthe Jewish problem. That\u2019s the way -- that was the answer",
        "A: Non-Jewish. In that -- shoemakers were all non-Jews. Now there are people which are doing\nthe tops and they were mostly Jewish because this is something that trade that falls within the\nsphere of Jewish interest for some reason or another.",
        "A: Yes, very heavily Christian. Because the product was known and you still can find people\ntoday that are of my age who live in Warsaw; they all remember the shoe store in Warsaw.\nBecause it was a known firm, it was a known name.",
        "A: Yes, we seen people with bundles that were sometimes seen on the street. My father would\npoint out to me and say these are refugees from Germany. Also we seen photographs in the\nnewspaper, pictures in the newspaper of the rioting. The stories that were behind them; where\nthey were stripped of German citizenship and the Polish government declared quickly that they\nstripped them also of the Polish citizenship. So they were people without citizenship; it was\nvery sad; it was a foretaste of things to come to an unimaginable proportion and degree.",
        "A: Yes. Poland, as you know, was occupied and didn\u2019t regain its independence until 1918 and\nprior to this, it was partitioned and occupied by three major powers which was Germany,\nAustrian-Hungarian empire and Russia. Warsaw was mainly under the Russian influence and\nRussian zone, so to speak. The Russian government tried to -- they had a very strong intensive\nprogram of reciprocation, so the language in high schools was Russian and Russian was the\nlanguage that you had to do business in Poland, in official Poland. Also when people were\ndrafted into the army, they went to the Imperial Russian army. Now my grandfather, probably\nstill a bachelor, was drafted into the Czar\u2019s army and was sent to Manchuria during the Russo-\nJapanese war. I remember him telling me stories of how cheap life was, of how many times\nthey executed Chinese. The Russians were executing Chinese and they were frightened of the\nRussians. The Russians might have cast the fear among the Chinese; they didn\u2019t do so well\nwith the Japanese because we know that the outcome of the war was not favorable to Russia.\nBut he served with them. I don\u2019t know, I couldn\u2019t tell you just how long. I know he was with\nhis friend who became his brother-in-law later because they married two sisters when they came\nback from the war, back to Warsaw. My future grandfather, Jacob Topas married my\ngrandmother Esther Topas. So this was one experience of the military. I don\u2019t think my\ngrandfather volunteered but my father did volunteer to the militia as I mentioned before, during\nthe Bolshevik invasion and was very patriotic that way. In fact my father served in the Polish\narmy later on already because there was a conscription, also Metek served in the Polish army\nfor a short period of time. My father was a non-commissioned officer in the Polish army and\nafter serving it, probably at a time when I was born, he also had to go periodically. He was\nrecalled for maneuvers and for a few weeks of what they called exercises, military exercises.\nMy father believed that we, the Jewish people, should be loyal regardless of anti-Semitism\nregardless of the inequities that existed in the social sphere of life, the economic discrimination\n--that we still owe allegiance to the country that we live in. In that respect, there was no\nquestion about it. He was also a realist and he knew that we have to get out of Poland because\nwe are an endangered species there.",
        "A: Yes. That document showed that after graduating high school in 1918, 1919, she, during\nvacation time, did volunteer work in what they called Polish soldier home, which is apparently,\nI would imagine it\u2019s a convalescent home for soldiers that were injured in that 1919-1920 war.\nSo she was briefly employed there or volunteered her services. She introduced that certificate\nand other certificates similar where she worked as a teacher in a school sort of to support her\napplication for law school in the Warsaw University.",
        "A: Soldiers, I think so.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: All right. This was not a citizen of Poland but a citizen of the city. This is kind of a\ndiscrimination, sort of compartment -- put in different compartments. You can be in this\ncompartment but you cannot be in the other compartment. What it meant is that our family\nopened a branch of our store -- I think they opened it probably in 1938 ---. After six months of\nexistence, the Polish government of the city of Kapolt ordered them out because they\nclaimed that they were not citizens of the city, or dwellers or residents of the city at some\nundetermined time which would otherwise by implication permit it. Justify them being there,\nprusterick.",
        "A: I think that basically they couldn\u2019t possibly -- they couldn\u2019t question my father\u2019s credentials\nsince he was a reserve non-commissioned officer, volunteer in a war against Russia. It was\nsimply a question of economic discrimination.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: You\u2019re going to make me say things which are in my book, really. I am firm about that but you\nare very perceptive in understanding that someone who came from a big city suddenly changes\nhis environment to a very raw surroundings 1n a sense -- that we had to haul our own water,\neven in our dormitory and we were always exposed to the elements. The creature comforts that\nour home provided were very remote there. It was not easy to get assimilated there. I\nremember from the first class -- there were maybe thirty students that started the course. By the\ntime of the fall harvest, of the potato harvest, 1t was reduced to about twenty. Because the\nothers quit, just packed up and went home because it was just too tough for them. But with me,\nit was very tough and I was always on the verge of quitting during the harvest. But I said -- I\nfelt that it was an embarrassment to come home and say that I failed. So I said, let me see if I\ncan hold out at least another week because it doesn\u2019t look good to come after the first week. So\nby several such resolutions, I extended my stay beyond the harvest time. Eventually I got to\nlike the school and I took pride in being able to work there and being knowledgeable about\ncrops and about animals and animal life. Anything that relates to this type of life interested me.\nI had a genuine interest 1n it that was developed by a very dynamic teacher and director of the\nschool, a fellow named Yachim Scholinsky who still lives in Israel. A very dynamic person\nwho made study an excitement. He put excitement in it which you don\u2019t normally find in\nclassrooms.",
        "A: When the war broke out, I was in that school.",
        "A: Well, it was past the harvest time because the war broke out on September 1, as you know, and\nthe harvest usually starts in the middle of June and continues up to this point. Hitler did very\nwell by waiting for the Poles to gather for him, all the harvest and put them in barns where they\ncan easily have it picked up for their own use and for the army\u2019s use, there was feeding off\nPoland,",
        "A: Yes, I was surprised by the reality of 1t not about what you read in the papers. Because the\nmovies and the papers, they create a different image and illusion of what things really are until\nyou are really directly affected by them. The outbreak of the war was excitement and sort of\nloss of interest for school subjects. The school authorities suspended classes and they had\ndismissed all the students to go to their respective hometowns except for the contingent from\nWarsaw. Because they said Warsaw is under bombardment and for our own safety, we will\nremain in school. Because our school, I think the war broke out on Friday morning, I think on\nSunday our buildings were already occupied by the Polish army because they were quartered\nthere.",
        "A: Not yet, at the very beginning, but it was under heavy pressure and bombardment because\nWarsaw -- there was a mass bombing raid on Warsaw before the war was declared. This was\ndone on September 1\u201c",
        "A: Yes. Sometimes I think, I don\u2019t know if the war was declared, maybe at night or at 10 a.m. but\nit was already much later, hours already into the race where most of the Polish air force already\nwas wiped out on the airfields before they got up in the air. So they definitely were taken by\nsurprise -- those that shouldn\u2019t have been taken by surprise. We heard on the radio Friday\nmorning at breakfast time, we heard about the attack on Warsaw and about the war. Of course,\nthere were mixed emotions. There was a lot of excitement but there was also great concern.\nWhat does it mean? What does it portend? But the authorities were very reassuring. They said\nthe war will soon be over and everybody will go home. I don\u2019t know whether by this they\nmeant that Poland will win the war or there would be an armistice and the newscasters were\nvery bombastic and enthusiastic in their reports. Of course, we didn\u2019t know, we didn\u2019t have the\nidea, the ability to be critical. We had no critical ability to be able to sort of digest the essence\nand what truth is in it. You would hear -- a broadcaster would say like this : The Polish cavalry\nis fighting in East Prussia like wild lions.",
        "A: But that was a kind of metaphor meaning that they are fierce fighters and also that they are --\nthe Polish army is advancing on Berlin. I mean this was like on the first or second day of the\nwar. When England and France joined the war on the third day and we could hear the English\nnational anthem and the Marseilles played over the radio, there was literally -- the newspapers\nwere hysterical. They felt that the war is going to be finished in a matter of -- 1n a short time.\nNobody really predicted any specific time but the feeling was that it was just a question of time.",
        "A: That Poland, together with England and France would win.",
        "A: When they told me that -- and I was in the city of Lublin -- that the Germans would be here in\none hour. In a city and Lublin was under bombardment.",
        "A: It\u2019s past Warsaw, right.",
        "A: It was anti-climatic but 1t came also as a surprise. Perhaps to many people it was a welcome\nsurprise because out of the two evils, many people thought that if they went to the Russian zone\n-- in the beginning it was very easy when they divide because the border was not firm -- there\nwas an influx of people both ways and they were not yet -- they didn\u2019t have yet a strict\ninstruction, how to handle the border movement across the border. So that anybody that\nthought, believed that he was better off being on the Russian occupation than German -- a lot of\npeople made that choice and then they went. They made a wise choice because they had a\ngreater chance of survival in Russia even those who were sent to Siberia. They were displaced,\nthey still had a better chance of survival because there was no deliberate effort by Stalin to\ndestroy the people, no matter what nationality.",
        "A: Or Polish officers in Katin. That\u2019s an interesting aspect of the Polish officers in Katin that many\npeople don\u2019t know about it. A lot of Jewish officers were among these Polish officers and they\nwere killed including the chief chaplain of the Polish army. The Jewish chaplain of the Polish\narmy.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t really know what was happening to my family. I could not establish contact. I don\u2019t\nknow whether the telephone lines were still functioning in the few days of the war but I know\nthat I managed to send a telegram to my mother asking her to send me money for a ticket to go\nback to Warsaw. I don\u2019t know whether she send me the money in time or whether the\nauthorities gave us the money to buy the tickets because eventually they relented and they told\nus that we can return to Warsaw. I think there were about five or six of us that immediately\nbegan to pack and go. I remember a very interesting incident. When I was in the post office\nstanding in line to send a telegram, there was a line -- the post office also had the national\nsavings bank of Poland which was called PKO, -- that means Polish Fund\nof, Saving Fund, which was government fund and people were using savings books. So there\nwere two Polish women standing in line talking to each other and very patriotically that they\nstill have confidence in the Polish government and that they are depositing. They were\ndepositing,",
        "A: I didn\u2019t make it to Warsaw. I never made it to Warsaw. The irony of it is and you can find it in\nmy book that when I came to the cashier\u2019s window in with other students, I said\nWarsaw. So she said the eastern railroad station or the main? The eastern being on the east\nbank of the river, the main being in the center of the city of Warsaw. I said, main. She said that\nwill be 50 cents more or something like that.",
        "A: I gladly paid for it because I had sufficient funds to pay for it. The irony of it was that we never\ngot near Warsaw.",
        "A: Of course. Not only was it surrounded because the train traveled for about 40 or 50 kilometers\nand the railroad tracks were going skyward.",
        "A: Right. There was no further railroad transportation --from there on, we were on foot. We never\ngot any further than Lublin, the city of Lublin.",
        "A: You mean, actually weeks of the war?",
        "A: What was not known to me and I found out later by miraculously meeting with my father in\nLublin is that the Polish government -- there is a controversy about it by historians. Some claim\nthat the Germans, on Polish language gave the order in Polish to the Warsaw population that all\nable bodied men of military age should march east for mobilization where they going to make a\ndefense deeper in Poland, in the country. This was given on the night, I think, of the sixth or\nseventh of September. Then my father and his two brothers were of military age and the\nfollowed these orders. They marched east of the Vistula River and they marched east without\nany specific destination but they continued to march east where they were being strafed by the\nStuka planes. But this order, a few hours later was countermanded. I think the name of the\nofficer that gave the order, countermanded it, was Romanowski. By that time, it was already\ntoo late. Because I think the afterthought was they wanted to defend Warsaw and all the\nmanpower that would have done the defense left Warsaw. So my father and his two brothers\nwere actually on the road with thousands upon thousands of men and easy targets for the\nGerman Luftwaffe to strafe and to kill. The casualties were tremendous. Eventually my father\nlost contact with his two brothers in the confusion that ensued and he got as far as Lublin. I\nfound him on the evening of Rosh Hashanah, New Year\u2019s, in the synagogue where I went to\npray. I lived there too and I seen my father there.",
        "A: Yes, it was unbelievable because there were thousands upon thousands of refugees that\nconverged on Lublin and flooded the town way beyond its normal population.",
        "A: Yes, the building that we lived in, the artillery destroyed part of the roof of the building. One of\nthe bombs struck the courtyard and killed a couple of people who were in a doorway, didn\u2019t go\nto the shelter. I was also told that there was a maid in our building, in one of the store that were\nin the building -- there was a drugstore by the name of Prusak. Prusak was a very nice man. I\nthink it was a family store. He was the son of the owners and used to give candles and other\nthings to kids when they came in with parents. He, somehow, got set on fire by a firebomb and\nbecame like a human torch and was burned alive during the bombardment. They had no water\nbecause all the facilities were disrupted so people literally had to travel to the Vistula River with\nbuckets to bring water. The utilities were not restored until the Germans took the city at the end\nof September.",
        "A: My grandfather, not grandparents because grandma left for United States on the last ship before\nthe outbreak of the war.",
        "A: The plan was that she is able to help us in some way. Possibly to see if she can send us\naffidavits so we all can go. Because she went on a tourist visa and ostensibly to see the World\u2019s\nFair. But in reality, she had a sister living there that visited us a few years earlier. They were\nbakers here. So she went to see this sister. My father and the family here hoped that she would\nbe able to help because by that time it was already too late. My grandmother was granted a visa\nand, of course, after obtaining the visa, she had to buy the ticket. The name of the shipping\ncompany in Poland is called Orbees to this day.",
        "A: My father later told me that there was such a melee in the office of wives of important Polish\ndiplomats and government officials, they were asking to get a ticket. They had no problems\nwith visas and so forth but they were sold out. They would say that they would sleep on the\ndeck of a ship if there were no more cabins. You know, they couldn\u2019t get it; they knew already\nwhat was coming.",
        "A: Yes, Puzutsk1.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Yes, well this happened sometimes later. It was not-- after the order was restored in the\noccupied Poland and they allowed return to Warsaw; we left probably already in October\nsometime, in later part of October; by horse and wagon rather than by train to come back to\noccupied Warsaw. My father immediately proceeded, engaged people to repair the building, the\nroof in the building and to restore 1t because otherwise we wouldn\u2019t have shelter. And it was\nactually in the later fall, perhaps in November of that year, we didn\u2019t get packages. We got\naffidavits for the whole family to go to the United States. My father studied these affidavits and\ndebated whether he should go to German authorities to obtain permission to leave. I don\u2019t\nknow what specific reasons were given but he never made use of these affidavits because the\nfear was that there were already some other people that have American relatives reported and\nthey were imprisoned. This was very strange because American was not at war with Germany\nat the time. So we never made use --\u2014there was great excitement and expectation, the great\nexpectation -- but it sort of was left in abeyance. Bur later on, of course, we didn\u2019t feel it so\nbadly at that time but soon famine came and Russian and all this. And things got progressively\nwell. Then the packages began to come from America, from my grandmother. She used to send\nan average of six packages a day. In the course of two days every member of the family would\nget a package.",
        "A: We could correspond with her. The mail was going, it was censored, we had to be careful what\nwe are saying. We couldn\u2019t make any complaints. We understood this, that we have to be brief\nin expressing. We had to sort of let her read between the lines.",
        "A: The packages came until the breakdown of the postal system in the Warsaw Ghetto, meaning\nuntil the Germans put an end to it which was a few months before the deportation to Treblinka,\nthe big action as they call it, the Grossactuen which would put it in May of 1942. The packages\nbecame sporadic, eventually there was a cut off point but they were our lifesavers because the\nfamine in 1941 became very severe. If you read the notes, the Ringlem notes of the Warsaw\nGhetto, you'll find out that people were dying at the rate of 400, 500 a day. It was twice as\nmuch already in \u201942. These packages were a thing that made a difference between us living or\ndying of hunger. Because we had no other resources that I knew of at the time. We had some\nhidden shoes but it was very dangerous to sell them even in a clandestine fashion. The rations\nwere not enough to sustain life. I remember during the time of famine in the Warsaw Ghetto in\n1941 that the children would just go in groups on the streets, after the curfew; I think the curfew\nwas 8 p.m. But it was not dark yet during the summer months so they would walk on the streets\nbarefoot with the swollen legs and beg for alms and beg for food. One of the standard lines\nthey would say, Yan which means I don\u2019t want to surrender my ration card.\nSurrender meaning dying, so they were begging for bread. My parents would always do\nsomething, however inconsequential this would have been to withstand this.",
        "A: The packages that we would get, I have a feeling, were not something that she, herself,\nprepared. There must have been an agency that handled and she just paid them for it. But it\nhad canned goods like sardines, it had coconut butter, a can of coconut butter which was very\nuseful because my brother, my youngest brother Meir, had a touch of tuberculosis and he was\nspitting with blood so he needed that. They would send us Salem Lipton Tea, I remember.\nLipton Tea was worth its weight in gold because you could get -- coffee and tea was at a\npremium, above other commodities except maybe for bread. So some of these things we used\nand some of them were sold in order to buy bread.",
        "A: She gave us a lease on life.",
        "A: Well, everyone received a package by families.",
        "A: Different names of our family members. But we understood who was -- it was for Shimatopas,\nit meant it was for our family.",
        "A: Well, in 1939 I believe, in November, late October or November, the Germans had arrived and\nconfiscated all the shoes. It was quite -- the shoe store was closed already and they came in. I\nremember when they were standing; they rang the bell in my grandfather\u2019s apartment which\nwas one flight above the shoe store in the same apartment building. It was a four-story\napartment building with a courtyard in the center and apartments surrounding it. I remember\nthe chief gendarme said, Is das de grochen ? , Isaac Yacob Topas? So when it\nwas answered in the affirmative, then they graciously told him that he could keep something\nlike 20 or 30 pair of shoes, or whatever. They gave him a receipt for it and they said the rest\nwill be confiscated and he will have to help to load up the trucks, himself. He and my father\nand people that were caught on the street to help out with this, so there was kind of a, like a\nbucket brigade carrying the shoes to those trucks that were being loaded.",
        "A: I would have to look in my book for exact date but it was either in -- the closest I can think,\nNovember, more likely November 1939.",
        "A: Well, they had information about shoe stores and businesses and so forth.",
        "A: Well, I have a feeling, because this happened later, even more so. That anyone, this was\nprobably among the Jews more prevailing this, that reported to the German authorities and\nshowed they had affidavits and wanted to leave for America, the Germans could let them go,\nthey could tell them to go home, or they could put them in prison. We knew in Poviac which\nwas the most wholesome prison in Warsaw that they had some Jewish families that had\nAmerican --. We didn\u2019t even want to let them know that we had American relationships\nalthough the packages would have indicated this. But they didn\u2019t care. Food packages 1s this\nkind of thing, that it doesn\u2019t have any political significance.",
        "A: Absolutely. Because it was a drop in the bucket. Maybe they would feel differently if it was a\nreal organized Jewish effort in America to send packages by the thousands to cover most of the\npeople in the city. Then they would say that it would be counter to their policy of starvation. In\nfact, my grandmother\u2019s sister with whom she lodged at the beginning after she arrived in\nAmerica, there was a limit on what she could take. She couldn\u2019t take currency, just a few\nhundred dollars, from Poland when she came over to visit. But she had some jewelry and she\nwas using that to cash in the jewelry to send us these packages. But that was not enough and\nshe had to go and sought a job and found -- became a nurse, kind of a live-in nurse with a\nparalyzed woman so the income from this, from working as a nurse, she would use to send us\nthese packages. She is a big heroine in our family. She did this and her sister, I found out when\nI came to the United States, was trying to dissuade her and would say, Itala, that was her name\nshe was called by. What are you doing? What are you knocking yourself out? They are not\ngoing to get these packages. The Germans are going to confiscate all these packages.\nTherefore you are doing it in vain. My grandmother, and this was a very persuasive argument\nbecause it is always easier not to do something than to do something, kind of a law of gravity, if\nshe listened to her, we would have perished sooner. I probably wouldn\u2019t get the point where I\ncan start my concentration camp career.",
        "A: I wouldn\u2019t get that far.",
        "A: Absolutely.",
        "A: Well, the training of the farming stood me well in several ways. First of all in that school, it\nwas a bodybuilding process. The hard work. I became, I was what you call a strong fellow, a\nyoung man. Secondly, it gave me the knowledge of agriculture and ability to work on a farm.\nIn the Warsaw Ghetto there was an organization called Toporol, T-o-p-o-r-o-l, which stood for\n, Means a society supporting agricultural work. That opened courses in the\nWarsaw Ghetto for people interested in this and I took those courses. This way I became\naffiliated with this organization.\n(End of Tape 1.)\nIn the summer of 1941, perhaps even in the late spring of 1941, the Toporol organization, that\norganization that was dedicated to the agricultural work, sees an opportunity of utilizing all\nempty and vacant lots of buildings or just squares -- to utilize them in growing vegetables for\nthe starving ghetto. Of course, it was a puny effort in comparison to the need where you have\nhalf a million people, nearly half a million people, starving in the walls of the ghetto. But\nnevertheless, the effort was necessary even if the produce that came from all this work was\ndistributed to the students that were working on it. Because it was not that much that they could\n-- it would be very difficult for them anyhow to get it past that point. I was at a time, already\nsixteen years old and I was made, appointed, one of the instructors. I remember there was a\nlarge plot, yard in the street, Leshner Street, not far from where we lived where I had two\ngroups of students that were coming. One for two hours and then the next one for two hours\nand I was showing them how -- we were working those lots and I was showing them how to do\nit. They were very eager kids, even some of them were, of course, undernourished. They were\nvery enthusiastically interested in the work and doing this work. In fact, one of the girls that\nwas in the group, not in my group but in the group of another instructor who was sick and I was\nsent there as a replacement one time to fill in, remembered me long after the war and sent me a\nletter to this effect, which became an appendix to my book. She is trying to find out whether I\nam the same person who acted as an instructor at the time. These kids were very eager and we\nwere planting lettuce, radishes, tomatoes, I remember, cabbage, very basic things in a kind of\ngarden farming or tract farming as they call it. I was also assigned on a Gensha Street prison\nand I also remember working at a cemetery on Gensha Street and there was a very stark contrast\nbetween what we were doing. We were pruning tomato plants for the living, while perhaps a\n100 feet from us or less, there were people being buried in mass graves. Usually the method\nthat was used, they were using a chute from the back of a wagon into those graves. The work\nwas going on all day. Those people were being -- the dead were being collected. By that time\nthe famine was very severe. I was occupied with this job, which sometimes the reward was to\nthe students and the instructors that they could pick up some of the crops of their own\nhandiwork, own labor and I think that the instructors were also getting, weekly, a loaf of bread.",
        "A: Yeah, I was an instructor. That was what we were getting above the students, the people that\nwere coming in these groups. In the end of June of the same summer, a call went out from this\norganization for able bodied men, whom they have on their roster already, to report for\nvolunteer work in the states around the Lublin district to help with the harvest. My parents very\nquickly consented to me to go. They would have one less mouth to feed and the conditions in\nghettos were very bad. By that time, my brother Szymon also already had a touch of\ntuberculosis. He was spitting blood. This is even with the help of the packages we were getting\nfrom America. It was just not enough. We were shipped to the district of Lublin and we\nworked there. We were quartered there and worked there. Even after the harvest I managed to\nstay there until February of the following year. This was a very significant factor in my own\npersonal survival from the standpoint that I was able to eat normally during that period of time\nand live in a healthy environment of the country, quite a contrast. In fact after I had been a\nmonth on those estates, I thought to bring my brother Szymon there, somehow. There was a\nsmall post office and I managed to make a phone call to a store that was opposite to our\napartment building. My father came to the phone and I told him about this. He said that my\nbrother Szymon didn\u2019t look like a Jew and he could pass for an Aryan easily -- that he should\ncome and join me, that he should send him out of Warsaw. He came and he stayed for a few\nmonths. Of course there was a problem there. He got homesick and eventually he left and went\nback home to the ghetto.",
        "A: Yes, because he was homesick. But I did not go until it was absolutely -- I found out that it was\ndangerous to live there because we no longer, we were no longer needed there for the harvest in\nFebruary, right? So in February, I returned. We were almost shot in Denblin en route by the\nGerman authorities who did not recognize our pass or came within seconds of not telling you\nthis whole story. There were many such incidents because I was also involved in smuggling\nand I cannot go into this. There was just too many schemes and escapes and whatnot. I\nreturned to the ghetto in February, found out that my grandfather, Jacob Topas, the founder died\na few months earlier.",
        "A: From typhus epidemic that was raging in the Warsaw Ghetto from famine because the sanitary\nconditions were very poor at the time and the overcrowding brought in lice and lice begot\ntyphus. So you had everything together. But apparently all these things that the Germans put in\noperation to strangulate the economic life of the Warsaw Ghetto and to bring the demise of the\nJews, didn\u2019t happen for them fast enough. So the inevitable thing is that they had to resort to a\nmore drastic method of bringing about the end of the Jewish community in Warsaw and in\nPoland. In April of 1942, a reign of terror started in the Warsaw Ghetto. We began to talk about\nbuilding shelters; something was impending, we didn\u2019t know exactly what. The packages from\nAmerica stopped coming. I forgot to mention that when America entered the war, my\ngrandmother resorted to ---. She was very resourceful, she contacted someone in the\nPortuguese embassy or consulate and the packages were coming -- the point of origin was\nPortugal. Portugal was neutral so we were getting packages probably until spring of 1942.\nThen the whole postal system, the whole ghetto system began to break down. The Germans, as\nI mentioned to you, launched a reign of terror in April of 1942. They kept it up. Later on I\nlearned that this reign of terror was to paralyze the will of the people to resist for what was\ncoming., for what they had in store for them. That was the \u201cresettlement\u201d action. Resettlement\nmeant shipment to Treblinka. It started by them posting the declarations or the ordinance that\nthe Jews should report voluntarily to the umschlagplatz, the umschlagplatz being the depot from\nwhich the trains were leaving for Treblinka.. They would go east, they would obtain shelter.\nThose who report voluntarily would receive jam and bread and surprisingly enough, the first\nday, which was July 22\" and this happened to be Tish a\u2019Bov, the day of mourning for the Jews\nfor the two destructions of the First and Second Temple in 586 B.C. and 70 A.D. by\nBabylonians and Romans, respectively; so the Germans launched this action. The key\ningredient in carrying it out was deception. Deception being that the Jews were promised to go\nto the east where there\u2019s work, shelter for them and they imagined that nothing could be worse\nthan the ghetto so the poorest of the poor began to report to the umschlagplatz with their\nluggage,. The Germans tolerated it. The first shipment, the people received the bread, they\nreceived the jam, they were able to take their luggage and they were put in the box cats and\nshipped away. But within 24 hours, rumors spread as a wildfire, that someone escaped from\nthis transport and that Treblinka is really an extermination camp. I remember that evening\nwhen we heard it in our homes ---.",
        "A: Yes, I think within a day or two we already knew what Treblinka meant. Many people didn\u2019t\nwant to believe it, we believed it. In these circumstances-- by that time my brother and I were\nalready in a Luftwaffe camp, my brother Szymon. In other words, he -- we both report as\nvolunteers to go to Luftwaffe camp yet before this action was launched. This was kind if a\ntransition from the agricultural work into the Luftwaffe camp and this was a forced labor\ncolumn. We were not quartered there; we were still living with our family and were just\ncoming to a point at the Warsaw Ghetto gate where two Luftwaffe guards would take us to our\njob. Sometimes they used streetcars for part of the trip. There was a place called Bilanie; there\nwas a big storage of Luftwaffe equipment, paints, and maintenance things for aircraft when we\nwere supposed to work. But initially they got us cleaning bricks in bombed-out houses. I don\u2019t\nknow why but I said to myself, we are back in the brickfields, we are back in the brickfields.\nSymbolically we were reduced to the status of our ancestors in Egypt. But this still was,\ncomparatively, benign to what was in store for us in this forced labor column. When the action\nwas launched, as I mentioned before, on the second and third day, there were no volunteers to\ngo to the umschlagplatz. So the Germans began isolating and putting a dragnet on certain\nsections of -- block by block of the city and emptied the houses. They also would come in,\nwhen the Germans came to conduct this with their trucks and wagons, sometimes, they usually\nmarched people, those that could march. Those who were already immobile, they were\nhandicapped or they were so starved that they couldn\u2019t walk, they threw them in the wagons\nand they took them that way. They could come in and announce that they would respect all the\npasses because the people were working for German industry; they were working maybe for the\nghetto government, like the Judenrat; they were working for the city ornundines which was the\npolice; maybe they were working for the hospital; they would be all exempt. So they were ---.",
        "A: They had an assorted degree of authority that in the beginning, they respected them all. As the\ntime went on, they were less and less respected. I didn\u2019t have any pass so that if I was caught, I\nprobably would have been shipped out to Treblinka too because we were simply assembling\nevery morning before the action started, however, early in the morning to go out and were\nbrought at the end of the day, to the point, to the gate and then we were on our own to get\nhome.. But after this action went into effect and was already in effect for a week or two, once\nwe came to work, the captain said when you come tomorrow to work, bring your things with\nyou because you\u2019re going to be here, interned for your own protection. Then he looked at the\nfaces; he passed all of us in review. The whole group of about two hundred people. He looked\nat my brother and he said he cannot come tomorrow, he\u2019s too young. He also, maybe, exempted\nanother kid and that was the end of it. When we came home, the ghetto was in such a state of\nterror besides this, that the German SS men were riding in rickshaws. You know what the\nrickshaws were? They were those bicycle-pedaled three-wheelers where the passengers are\nsitting in the front and the bicycle-peddler in the back. They would ride in the bicycle-pedaled\nrickshaw and they would be firing at the windows at the people and the crowds wherever they\nsee them.. So we were literally dodging bullets when we were coming back from our work. Of\ncourse, after that incident, after we were told that we\u2019re going to be interned there, I realized\nthat I\u2019m going to have to part from my family. The morning after this, when I got up in the\nmorning, my father was still praying. I said goodbye to my mother and she was packing some\nof my things that I was going to take with me. I said goodbye to my sweet brother Meir, my\nyoungest brother, Meir, and to Szymon. Then my father gave me a blessing; it was the first\ntime I\u2019d seen him cry in my life because he was a very steady influence. He was a very self-\npossessed individual and confident that somehow we\u2019re going to get through this whole ordeal\nand so forth. I don\u2019t know what was going on in his mind but if I did not realize it, he must\nhave realized that we are parting for good.",
        "A: No. I was too much of an optimist. I was too young. I\u2019m sort of a romantic in a sense that I\nthink that hope can overcome reason.",
        "A: Correct. I also had faith that evil cannot vanquish good. So in the long run, I don\u2019t think that\nthere was any doubt even by those who perished that Germany will be defeated and that they\u2019re\ngoing to win the war. The question is when. But there was no doubt that Hitler will lose that\nwar and that the Allies will prevail and win. But meanwhile, we were in their grasp so such\noptimism has a limited value and effect on your well-being. Of course when I took my last\nglance at my father, that was it. I haven\u2019t seen him again nor my parents. I went to this camp.\nWe learned that in October, Yom Kippur, the Day of Judgment, was the last day of the\nshipments to Treblinka. In fact, the Jewish police had the honor of being put in the last\ntransport to Treblinka because they were promised that if they cooperate in the round-up of the\nJews in the Warsaw Ghetto, that they and their families would be spared. So they and their\nfamilies on the Judgment Day were spared until that point but then they were also shipped. I\nguess there was some poetic justice in that.",
        "A: Right. I began to realize that if I wanted to know what happened to my parents and to my\nfamily, I would have to return t the ghetto. But you just simply cannot say I am leaving. We\nwere by that time already interned, we were prisoners, we were not free people. Although there\nwas such a nebulous air about it as to exactly what is our status there. We worked there; they\nintern us for our own protection. That means if we leave, we are just taking risk with the\nprotection. But, in reality, you could be shot for leaving without permission. I began to plan an\nescape. The way I went about it, I reported that I am a shoemaker by trade and that we have\npeople here whose shoes need repair. If they are going to continue to work, someone has to\nrepair their shoes, that I should be given the opportunity to do this. In order to do this, I need\ntools and equipment and I can get these in the ghetto. So they send me with a guard to the\nghetto. On the second such trip, I escaped. I left the cart waiting. Then I began to -- I had to\ngo where our home was. By that time, the ghetto was reduced in size. There was what they call\nNiemand\u2019s Land that means Nobody\u2019s Land and it was not permitted to be there but there was a\ngroup that the SS employed in the Warsaw Ghetto of Jews which was called Vertafastak.\nVertafastak was sort of a clean up group that was confiscating all the -- collecting all the goods\nof the people that were no longer there. Furniture, books, belongings, clothes, whatever else\nthose that were deported to Treblinka left behind. It was a big operation and a large contingent\nof these who were working. They would be doing it by streets.. I reported to work with such a\ngroup and when they went there, I separated myself from them by just ---. There were so many\npeople walking upstairs and downstairs and there were only a couple of guards usually at the\ngate. I went on the roof and through the roof I walked to the roof of the adjacent building, came\ndown and eventually got to the area of my own building which, of course was deserted. But I\nfound out that behind iron doors, back doors of one of the delicatessen stores, which really\ndelicatessen in Poland means something else, means like a grocery store. I found out that the\nsurvivors there who knew me and who were tenants in our building, that my mother perished,\nthat she was one of the first -- in one of the early raids -- and they told me that my father might\nstill be around but they don\u2019t know. Eventually I met in this Niemand\u2019s Land another person\nwho had a store also in the building. His name was Bart and he told me to look; he told me that\nthere is reason my father and my brother survived in there someplace, perhaps in the camp.\nWithout going into much detail, I never found out anything more beyond that except returning\nonce with the group I found that my Uncle Melek survived and he\u2019s now in the small ghetto. I\nwent to him. He, in turn, told me that my grandmother, my maternal grandmother survived by\nhiding herself in a clothes chest and her sisters, three sisters.",
        "A: Right. They survived and they were on U Sreet, not exactly where my uncle was. I\nwent and found them and I lived there because there were also two kids in there, while I was\nworking for this Vertafastak operation. This I did this until January, In January, I heard a rumor\nabout cleaning up the umschlagplatz again so I went to the arbeizen which 1s the work office. I\nwas sort of casing the joint as the word goes and I found out that another Luftwaffe guard came\nin with a Jewish foreman or leader and they were looking for volunteers. When I ascertained\nthat they are not from Bilanie but from another place, from Orcencia which was the airport, the\nlargest airfield to this day in Warsaw, I volunteered for this group. Also forced labor column\nand I was able to stay with my aunts and just go every morning to work. But when the action\nstarted and the Germans surrounded the ghetto on January 18\" or 19\", 1943, I found myself ina\ndilemma-- \u2014 how to get -- the problem how to get out and rejoin the group and not get caught in\nthe net, in the dragnet. Eventually through Visu who is a friend of Mead who was an\nartist in the process of painting the picture of the commanding officer of the airport, he and his\nbrother, and a few other fellows gathered that morning and a call was made to the Luftwaffe\ncamp from the Polish precinct. Polish police and they sent guards and brought us there. There\nwe were for a while until the Warsaw Ghetto uprising. In the interim, I made another foray to\nthe Warsaw Ghetto with another guard to obtain some things from my uncle, some clothes he\ngave me.",
        "A: Uncle Melek. The book tells you about the details because I had a fight with him there. But\nthis I felt that he was hoarding some stuff that he got from the shoe store and that he was not\nsharing it with me. Anyway, by that time, the Warsaw Ghetto was already in its residual stage,\nwas in the final days of its existence. By that time, we didn\u2019t know about it, but the resistance\norganization already was functioning. One of the things was when I visited my uncle under\nguard, from this Orcencia Luftwaffe camp, there was a shot fired. We run to the window and\nwe found out that there were just two Jewish civilians that fired and killed one of the informers,\nGestapo Jewish informer. You could see that the Germans didn\u2019t interfere with it, they didn\u2019t\ncare. In April 18\" or 19\", I think, the Passover marked the Warsaw Ghetto revolt which was a\nreaction to the German entry to the ghetto to start to \u201cresettle\u2019\u2019, to liquidate the ghetto. Also\nfrom Orcencia, some weapons were smuggled to the fighters in the Warsaw Ghetto. I didn\u2019t\nknow it, exactly how they did it and who was ---. I was not among the insiders. From our\nairfield, planes took off to bomb, firebomb the Warsaw Ghetto by the Luftwaffe and we knew\nabout it. As the Warsaw Ghetto was going up in flames, rumors spread that they\u2019re going to\nliquidate all the camps around Warsaw including the one where I was interned. It was a small\ncamp, a little over 100 prisoners.",
        "A: By the Luftwaffe. We were working at the airfield. There was a Yunkirst enterprise, a\ndismantling division of aircraft, shot down fighter planes over Germany that was brought in\nthere. This is how the weapons got sometimes in the hands of the fighters. They were found in\nthese planes. I think on May 12\", we were being, we were sent to the Warsaw Ghetto under\nguard. At that time, the Warsaw Ghetto was already in ruins but the fight was still going on.\nWe were taken to the umschlagplatz and shipped to Majdanek. I didn\u2019t know about it but we\nfound out we were shipped to Majdanek, we decided not to jump the train, not to make any\nefforts, because we knew we were on a line that was not going to Treblinka; we established that\npoint. But it turned out to be that we were slated to go to gas chambers anyway. In Majdanek,\nalso there were gas chambers.",
        "A: We didn\u2019t know that then. My father perished in Majdanek; I didn\u2019t know that then either.\nBecause this was posthumously and after the war. Anyway I cannot tell you all the details\nbecause I would be getting too emotional as to what has happened on this trip but we were\nlucky that we were only -- by that time -- since what was coming was anticipated, about\nfourteen guys escaped from our camp. What was left was about 88 men because I remember\nwhen the Luftwaffe turned us over to the SS at the umschlagplatz, they said, they\nyelled. So they said . There was 88, this is how I remember there were 88. We lost one\nguy in the melee in Majdanek but we saved some other people that were behind us and were\nsent to a camp named Budzyn. There was a miraculous saving, something happened in there\nthat was just unbelievable. I describe it in detail in my book and we were sent to Budzyn where\nthere was an aircraft Heinkil Aircraft plant, probably the worst camp in the penal system as far\nas treatment went by one named Fikes. Reinhold Fikes was the commanding officer in the rank\nof a sergeant and he was an incarnation of cruelty and bestiality in what he dd. In that camp, I\nstayed about eleven months. This camp eventually became -- was an SS labor camp \u2014became a\nconcentration camp. The difference being that they put us in striped uniforms. Before we were\nwearing our civilian clothes. This was a time where I registered as a chemist, as an inventor\nand later on this resulted me working on this super-weapon development which didn\u2019t turn out\nanything but it was a good vehicle to ride out the remaining months of the war. From that\ncamp, we were sent to a camp called Plaszow near Cracow. From Plaszow, we were shipped to\nFlossenburg. In Flossenburg, this group was really commissioned so to speak, really put to\nwork in what was reputed to be a super weapon.",
        "A: No, no. The 88 had nothing to do with it. There was a registry because we were sent to Budzyn",
        "A: There was another group because the camp had over 2,000 people in Budzyn. This group was\nonly maybe 50, 60 people large and it was an aggregate of people from different camps.\nBudzyn had a contingent in it; Plaszow picked up a few people. But eventually we were being\nset up in a sort of lab to work in, in Flossenburg. That\u2019s where the real work went in. It was an\nunbelievable experience because I learned English working in this lab. There was nothing\nreally for me to do. I found an English textbook and David Copperfield and I learned English,\nfound a tutor as well, among the prisoners.",
        "A: Yes, named Goldfarb who was teaching me grammar. But there was a group of prisoners who\nwas actually working on plans for this device, as the Germans called apparatus. There were\nsome rumors as to what it could do if it were successful in doing it. It fell into the realm of the\nsemi-fantastic. I spoke once to my uncle who was a chemist, about it, and he says that what\nthey propose to do could not be achieved. It was unobtainable but they thought it was. The\nGermans were not fools; they apparently were convinced that something could be done. This\nproject was not such a local thing. We didn\u2019t know about it at the time but it claimed the\ninterest of the highest echelon of Nazi power. I have a telegram that came after my book went\nto print, which is addressed to Himmler to grant permission to move this group, which 1s\nessential to the war effort, this is German\u2019s writing, a Jewish group essential to the war effort .\nDo you see the paradox in this? If we help them win the war, they\u2019re going to exterminate all\nthe Jews. To the war effort and I have a reply from Himmler\u2019s office, from Himmler\u2019s\nheadquarters, that he grants permission and that the matter should be taken up with so-and-so to\ntransfer the Jews, the scientists. So we\u2019re working there. Eventually, when this project did not\nproduce a mousetrap, it was disbanded and it was just a few weeks later that the Allies armies\nwere already close to Flossenburg. I don\u2019t know how close they were because I was on a death\nmarch for about three, close to four days. We were liberated in April by the 11 Armored\nDivision and of course, then I realized what happened to the other members of my family. I\nknew already in the Warsaw Ghetto, from my Uncle Melek, whom I found after I came from\nThe Orcencia; I met him after the Orcencia place, I was in his apartment. He told me that Uncle\nBen is hiding on the Aryan side of the Warsaw Ghetto and that Rose, his wife, has Aryan\npapers, works for German industry. She hides him in her apartment. I found out that possibly\nthat my Uncle Sevek, the orphan --cousin who lived -- one of the three orphans brought up in\nmy grandparents\u2019 home, is also some place in hiding but he didn\u2019t know where. He didn\u2019t know\nwhether he is still in hiding or whether he perished. But beyond that all contact was lost and I\nhave not learned of any details of any of my relatives except that I found out that my father,\nthrough Tracing Bureau, they send me this document that I showed you just when you\nfirst came in -- that attested to the fact that my father lost his life in Majdanek on September 23,\n1942. So my mother died in Treblinka in the first action, 1942, probably in August with my\nbrother Meir. Now the only person that I don\u2019t have a definite proof that was killed is my\nbrother Szymon, to this day. Because all other perished. My grandmother, who saved herself\nfrom the first round-up in 1942, was probably shipped out in 1943 if she didn\u2019t perish sooner,\nwith her daughters, my aunts and with these two boys of the eldest daughter, Frania.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: With the family, at home. Now --.",
        "A: No, he didn\u2019t go with my mother. This much I have learned. Also I have learned -- of course\nafter liberation I have received, I have overheard conversation between liberated prisoners like\nmyself, that there was a Topas in Prague, in Czechoslovakia, in Roxy Hotel where refugees\nconverged. I immediately -- I was at that time with the United States Army; I was in the CIC\ncorp, Counter intelligence Corp. I was one of the most fortunate of prisoners that I was allowed\nstill to fight. I was with the 104th regiment of the 26\" division with the Third Army. After the\nwar, I was attached to a CIC unit in Nuremberg, in the town that you mentioned before,\nstationed in Nuremberg. I found out that my uncle survived; Uncle Ben survived and I also\nlater on found out that he fought in the Polish uprising of 1944. But Andros was shipped with\nthe Polish people to Germany because all Warsaw was emptied out of people. They were sent\neither to concentration camps or forced labor. He was sent to farm work. He remained on the\nruins of Warsaw and lived from what he -- like a scavenger. I sent somebody, a friend of mine\nwho also figures prominently in my book, to bring him. He brought him -- he went to the\nRussian zone and brought my Uncle Ben and we had a reunion and we met. Then I sent another\nprisoner to bring his wife from the British zone. I found out that she was in Castle because my\ngrandmother\u2019s letter told me this after I resumed contact with her. She sent me food packages\nand money and so forth",
        "A: He went to Czechoslovakia.",
        "A: Right. He was searching relatives. He wanted to get possible --. I don\u2019t know what he\nintended to do but he found out ---. Then he told me about Sevek, that he also survived and that\nhe went to Israel, he and his wife, Rita. They were childless and he was already by that time, in\nhis forties. Sevek, the cousin.",
        "A: No. He went into hiding. There\u2019s an interesting story. He used to work for our company. All\nthe orphans, the three orphans worked for our company but he married one of the pretty\nsalesgirls from our company. He separated himself from us and he opened his own store of\ncustom made shoes, a smaller --.",
        "A: No, no, a Jewish wife, a salesgirl, right. Her name was Rita, a very attractive girl. They\nestablished themselves a few streets away from us, with a shoe store. When the war broke out,\nhe gave all of the goods to one of the Polish-- his Polish salesgirls. That Polish salesgirl took it\nto her own home and she would be selling, periodically, some of the leather or leather goods\nand bringing them money to live on, to the ghetto. She would be going back and forth. But\nlater on, established through her contact, they established a liaison with one of the Polish\nunderground operators from the Socialist Party who were more friendly towards \u2014 well--\ndisposed to the Jews --.",
        "A: Whatever. But it was not so altruistic. What happened is this; that he had in a place called\nRamburtoof, I believe. I\u2019m not absolutely certain because it had two names in Polish names of\nthe town that sound the same. When I went to visit Poland I was searching for the people that\nhid him in the wrong town because of the similarity of names. He had his wife living there -- it\nwas like a suburban town of Warsaw and a daughter and son which were already in their late\nteens. But he also had a lover in Warsaw where he worked so he couldn\u2019t support two of them.\nBy getting my uncle Sevek, my cousin Sevek and his wife to hide, he got income for them so\nthey didn\u2019t have to depend on my pay. He could live with his lover and they supplied the\nincome for his wife and kids, for the two children. He was in hiding there until liberated by the\nRussians. He was there for seventeen months living mainly under the floorboards of their\nbedroom or whatever.",
        "A: Even earlier.",
        "A: Right, he was on the east side of the river.",
        "A: Right. And something about Sevek. He was a very friendly guy. When I was growing up, I\nwas a kid., he was already almost 20 years old. He had a way with the kids, always a smile on\nhis face. You were never told that he had a hard life, that he was an orphan; he was not\nembittered by it and he didn\u2019t have any chip on his shoulder. He would spend a lot of time with\nthe kids and play around, clown to entertain us, and so forth. I was very happy to hear that he\nsurvived. Then, of course, I visited him to find out how he survived. That\u2019s why I\u2019m able to\ntell you that. He went to Israel; now he\u2019s in Germany, really. Because his wife couldn\u2019t find\nwork in Israel and there were hardships at the beginning. They went to Israel when it was still\nPalestine, before Independence.",
        "A: He was settled there; he was there maybe for two or three years. Then his wife wanted to go to\nFrance to find a job for him and for her and she couldn\u2019t. She couldn\u2019t get permission to reside\nthere so she went to Germany, unfortunate. This is where he is today. He is already 83 years\nold. Now about my brother Szymon. In 1989, my wife, in company of my wife, my friend\nMark, his wife, Bea, and their two sons, we embark on a trip of memory lane. To go back to\nPoland after 50 years absence and to Israel on our way back and Germany. I also stop in\nGermany.",
        "A: To see Flossenburg -- and Sevek. We went together to visit Flossenburg. Now when we visit\nPoland, we realize that we are going to be there only six days or seven days. Our time was of\nessence there, so we preplanned exactly what we are going to ---.\n(End of Side A, Tape 11)\nWe arranged for two chauffeurs and two limos, two cars to take us around so we don\u2019t depend\non the regular tourist conveyance top see the places. Because there were specific places that the\nitinerary for our visit to Poland was planned in advance and it was very compact. We had to\ncrowd many things into a very short space -- so that when we arrived in Warsaw, we had two\nlimos already when we arrived at the airport to pick us up, to take us to the hotel and the\nfollowing morning, we started our visit. Of course my visit included first of all the city of\nWarsaw itself, the ghetto monument, the site of our apartment building in the Warsaw Ghetto,\nwhich building had been erased, had been destroyed during the uprising or possibly after the\nuprising, perhaps in the Polish revolt which was in 1944. It included visits to my childhood\nplace of Shaboruf where I -- to remember the villa that belonged to my grandparents, perhaps\nstill does, where we spent summers in my childhood days. Then we went to Majdanek, we visit\nin the Lublin district. I see also the city of Lublin which I had memory because I knew a family\nthere and a girl that perished in Poland. Then we went to places of that was of\ninterest to my friend Mark. We went, I think that this 1s what we did in the course of time. We\nstill had Warsaw, increments of Warsaw that were to be seen, for instance, the Warsaw cemetery\nthat we didn\u2018t have time. I don\u2019t know on which day but I think on one day, perhaps it was\nSunday, the following Sunday of our arrival, that we decided to split because Mark had his own\nitinerary with his car to see Radom and I wanted to see my mother\u2019s hometown of Plutz. We\nwent to Plutz and we have seen what there was to see. The synagogue was destroyed but the\nbuildings were still there. I seen my grandparents\u2019 home, apartment, which was very, very\nsmall and --.",
        "A: Of what we were used to in Warsaw. After seeing all these places and the Vistula River and\nwhatever I could associate with the past, we went to see.. Then we had a very intelligent driver\nand driving back to Warsaw I realized that in spite of our frugality in using time economically,\nin disposing of time, we were coming early. I said to myself, I looked at my watch and I think it\nwas something like 4:30 p.m. and the days in late August were very long. I said to the driver, I\nsaid, do we have time to see another place in the vicinity of Warsaw? Which really was not on\nschedule. But it suddenly occurred to me that the last three summers, we did not go to our villa\nin Shorboruf, but we went to Oralie a village called Oralie which was kind of a summer resort\nand also a farming community. I was there in the summer of \u201937 and \u201938 and my family was\nthere also in the summer of \u201939. Because in \u201938 in the middle of the summer, I was sent to the\nagricultural school as you recall. I said, it would be interesting to see because I would be able\nto see the very cottage where we stayed in. I asked my wife and she consented and the driver\nsaid, by all means, he was gung-ho. We directed because it was in the vicinity of Warsaw, it\nwould not take us more than maybe half an hour out of the way, counting both ways. We had\nsome difficulty finding our way to the place, to recognize and so forth. Finally, some people\ntold me which building it is that I probably was in that summer. I came by that building with\nthe car and I look at that building and I say, no this is not the building, it doesn\u2019t have veranda.\nWe turn around and went back to the beginning of the street of the village when one of the\nproperties -- a woman, elderly lady told us that this is the building. I say this is not the building.\nShe says this is the building. I spoke to her in Polish. She says this is the building, she insisted,\npersisted rather. I said, where\u2019s the veranda? She says it was removed. That can confuse you.",
        "A: I asked her and she took us there. It turned out to be she was a sister-in-law of the landlady of\nthe building named Levandofska. Mr. Levandofsky was, of course, the landlord. When I was\nthere, she was a woman in her twenties. Now she was nearly 80 years old. She was sitting\nthere; 1t looked like a rocking chair in the house. The lady that brought us in said you have\nguests in here. The guests being my wife, the driver and myself. We came in, we looked at her,\nand I began to orient myself there that this is the building in which we stayed. This was a\nbuilding that -- there were three families in the summer that shared that building. I\u2019m repeating\nsomething that you can find in my book but I can probably tell you this in a greater detail than\nyou will find in my book. I say Mrs. Levandofska; she didn\u2019t know who I was but they knew\nthat we are tourists and that we were probably from America and I spoke Polish. Many Poles\nreturned back to Poland. I said to her, do you remember who lived in this -- who was\nvacationing here in the summer, who occupied this building in the summer of 1938, \u201939? She\nlooked and just stared at me without saying anything like gathering her thoughts. Of course, I\ncouldn\u2019t figure what were her thoughts. I went one step further and I said, do you remember\nwho was in this apartment? Pointing to one of the doors. She said Lasolta. I said it was a\nPolish pilot, the family who lived there. So she says Lasolta. She remembered that name. I\npointed to another door and she mentioned the other family. Then I didn\u2019t say anything for a\nmoment. Then I said, wasn\u2019t a Jewish family here also in this apartment here? Pointing to the\nlast one. She says, yes, Topas. She said, Mr. Topas, very sympathetic man, and Mrs. Topas,\nvery nice lady. And they had two children. The oldest was Yurik and the younger was Szymon,\nanother baby too? Oh yeah, Meirick. That\u2019s Meir. She told them that my father was very good\nto them. He brought gifts, shoes for the family in addition to whatever they paid for the rent.\nShe volunteered a few things. I said to her I was very pleased. We took some photographs. I\nthought the audience was over and I already exchanged some dollars for Polish money which\npower of dollars was tremendous. I was going to give her a few thousand of the Polish zloty\nwhich were not very much in American money but I felt that I took her time and so forth. I felt\nthat I would do it just as a friendly gesture. But just about when I thought that the whole\ninterview was over, she began to shake in her chair. She says, Szymonik, such a well-built boy,\na pleasant boy, didn\u2019t look Jewish. He came here from the Warsaw Ghetto in the summer of\n1942, I think. He asked me to save him, to shelter him, to hide him. I wanted to do it, I really\nwanted to do it. But we were afraid because the trains were going from Warsaw to Treblinka on\nthe track that was stopping in our Ourland during the normal rides and the Jews were jumping\noff the trains. There was a gendarme named Stein who was looking for them here. I was afraid\nthat if I\u2019m going to hide him, the neighbors will snitch on me and then we\u2019re all going to be\nkilled. So I said to Szymonik, let my husband take you to the next village. Maybe you can be a\nshepherd there to cows, that sort of thing. Szymon, my brother, at that time was about fourteen\nyears old. But he didn\u2019t want to go. He says he doesn\u2019t know there anybody. But, and she\nrepeated it again. He told me that his grandmother lives in America, is in America. I\nimmediately presumed that he said that to make her understand that if she does this, if she takes\nthe risk, that she would be rewarded for it, after the war. I ask her, Mrs. Levandoska, then what\nhappened? Did he leave? She said, well maybe he stayed here a day or two, a few days and\nthen he left. I said did you hear anything about him? She said no. I had right away a\npremonition that he must have perished not far from this point because he came in and although\nhe didn\u2019t look Jewish, but he was a kid and he was scared. You realize that every Jew just by\nvirtue of being Jewish, had a price tag on his life.",
        "A: And a Polish peasant who turned in a Jew could get a bottle of vodka and two pounds of sugar\nand maybe a hundred zlotys. So there was a reward, just as there was punishment for hiding the\nJews, there was a reward for turning them in. He might have been turned in by Polish people;\nhe might have made it back to the ghetto. I really don\u2019t know. When she came to the end, she\nwas very sad. She realized that I\u2019m a relative but she didn\u2019t know who I was.",
        "A: I told her that I\u2019m Yurik, that I survived the war. I joined the American army, fought to the\nwar\u2019s end, and came to America. My grandmother lived in America at the time, until 1969,\nwhen she died here in Lakewood. She\u2019s buried in Lakewood. But I still gave her the money.\nShe didn\u2019t want to accept the money. Why are you giving money? I didn\u2019t save your brother,\nshe said. Oh well, you wanted to save him. Then it seemed like there was nothing more. I was\npretty -- right now I can speak about it without being as shaken up as I was at the time when it\nhappened and when I repeated it the first time or two, but now it\u2019s in the book. Then I said -- I\njust thought for a moment -- I said do you have any photographs of before the war? So they\nbrought in an album of photographs before the war. I scanned through the photographs and\nseen the building, I seen Mr. Landofsky who, incidentally, was laying paralyzed from the waist\ndown in bed next door in the room where we were talking. I didn\u2019t see anything. I was hoping\nthat maybe they photographed our family, which for me, would have been priceless but they\ndidn\u2019t have any. There were some loose photographs that were just bunched up in the bottom of\n-- the end of the album. I went through these photographs. I found a photograph of Adolph\nHitler..",
        "A: It was really confusing.",
        "A: No writing. It was just like a post card, a picture of Adolph Hitler. The driver had seen this\nwith me and I just didn\u2019t say anything about it. I just shut and closed the album and we left.\nWhen we get in the car, I was confused but I realized that her husband must have been a Hitler\nsympathizer. That she might have, I feel that she was an earnest person, an earnest woman\nbecause she didn\u2019t have to tell me anything. She didn\u2019t have to tell me that he came back there\nto save her, that he came from the Warsaw Ghetto, had to risk his life and get out. Came to her\nand asked her to be kept in there . She didn\u2019t have to volunteer any of that; I didn\u2019t ask her. She\ndid tell me this so she -- maybe she had good intentions. She wanted to save him but maybe her\nhusband was opposed to it. He might have been an admirer of Hitler.",
        "A: They had reasons but what shall I say?",
        "A: Well there was admiration for ---. Until Hitler turning on to Poland. There was a tremendous\nadmiration for Germany because of their policy towards the Jews.",
        "A: Yes, it would not be patriotic and perhaps it is to their credit, of the Poles, that they didn\u2019t have\nmany collaborators against their own people that we know of. They didn\u2019t have many\ncollaborators towards their own people. But many among them were very vicious anti-Semites\nand we were talking about all these people. I didn\u2019t mention to you, the Rosenbaums who are in\nmy book, a beautiful girl -- and her mother were hidden. They were in Lublin. I met them -- I\ngot to know them during the war in Lublin when I was staying there. My father was there. You\nremember when I told you we met. Later on I got a post card that she is hiding. I told you I\nwas still in Warsaw Ghetto when they went into hiding on a farm by a fellow named\nSty in Sm , Ko in Poland. It was not until maybe five years ago\nthat a widow of the son of the owner, who told me that both women were killed by people other\nthan the Germans. She didn\u2019t say so but she says they were killed because of their possessions.\nThey went out in the middle of the night with valises having their valuables with them, no\ndoubt, and he says, you know that there was no shortage of vile people during the war and they\nwere shot and buried in the woods nearby. This is something I have to return to because I didn\u2019t\nhave a chance to visit Sm where possibly the burial ground is. I don\u2019t think that\nthe grave was marked. But this is where they were shot and they were shot by Poles. My\nbrother Szymon, is still an enigma even in spite of any premonition I have. There was an\ninteresting development that is almost anti-climatic to everything we are talking about. My\nwife, first, and then my son visiting Israel went to a cavern which is on the border of Lebanon\nand Israel. The cavern is a tourist attraction and they seen on the wall, the name of Simon\nTopas. It\u2019s a Simon Topas spelled exactly, not with a \u201cz\u201d but with an \u201cs\u201d\u2019, Topas. Silemonca\nSpain, familia Topas, familia Simon Topas Silemonca Spain. I have -- just as I talk to you I\njust thought -- why I\u2019m not able to find anything about this family. Because I\u2019m asking for the\ntelephone number of Simon Topas at the Silemonca operator in Spain. I wrote to the Red Cross\nand to the post office. He said the family of Simon Topas which means, if it were my brother,\nin the unlikely event, it is not he who wrote this --scribbled that name-- but maybe his son or his\ndaughter who marked this in order to look for someone. The name could be -- the first name\ncould be different. And if it was a daughter who was married and took another family name. I\nthink, in Spain, it works in reverse, the men assume the wife\u2019s -- the family assumes the wife\u2019s\nlast name",
        "A: They use both. So this is still an unresolved kink but it\u2019s very unlikely. Once I got excited, I\nfound in Israel, Szymon Topas, in a missing persons bureau in Jerusalem. I immediately sent a\ntelegram there and the guy was nice enough to send me a telegram back that he assumed the\nname Topas after coming from Russia to Israel.",
        "A: That id true. I am still going to check out the Silemonca, Spain \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, I have to. This is because we are -- we have so little and we are hanging on to a straw.\nThis is very, very weak indication but I\u2019m saying to myself, who would come, who would be\ninterested in coming to Israel? Although non-Jews come to Israel and all the tourists, Jewish\nand non-Jewish like to see all the tourist attractions. Besides the religious aspect, there are non-\nsectarians so to speak. Certainly a cavern is something that interests everybody. Could be a\nMorano",
        "A: But we are.",
        "A: Yes. According to a distant relative who married my grandmother and comes from Warsaw, a\nfellow named Max Muskowitz, told me that our family originates in Spain.",
        "A: Right. There was a choice then, to convert or be expelled.",
        "A: Yes, 500\" anniversary. I was in Spain but this was before I knew about the ---. I was with my\nwife in Spain but this was before I know about the sign in the cavern. I have a photograph.",
        "A: I think that the Spanish Jews, when they moved out of Spain, there was such a tremendous\nflood, that it was exile, that they were moving westward. Some of them wound up in France,\nsome went as far as Germany, Italy. Italy already had some Jews from before that existed from\nthe destruction of, even before the destruction of the Temple, was a very old community there.\nThen in the 1500\u2019s, the Polish king, Kazmir the Great, thought that the Jews would be good for\nthe development of the country which was backward and invited the Jews to come. Gave them\ntheir \u2014 they became King\u2019s subjects living under his protection. So the beginning was very, you\nmight say, idyllic but it didn\u2019t continue very long.",
        "A: She was lucky that she was sent -- in that sense she was lucky that she was sent to America. My\nuncle owes his survival in a very plain sense to my aunt, to his wife Rose, who hid him.",
        "A: Yes, to a very great extent, because we couldn\u2019t get as far as we did if it were not for her help.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes. Lublin figures very prominently in my memory, First of all, if this is not apparent in my\nbook, I want you to know that Lublin Jewry was one of the most hospitable communities I have\nknown. They took such great care of the refugees and they were inundated with people during\nthe blitz of 1939. When we came there from this agricultural school, we went to the synagogue\nand we were living there. People were bringing us meals like regular meals. They took it as a\nresponsibility on themselves. They did it with a very pleasant demeanor and very graciously.\nMy father, when I met with my father, one of the family offered us a place to stay. So I didn\u2019t\nhave to sleep in the synagogue anymore on the hard bench. I went and stayed with my father.\nOf course, the Rosenbaum family became like a family away from the family. I did have a\nromantic notion about the girl that figures in the book, Gina, although prematurely probably, but\ndefinitely ---. I idealized her because she was such a pretty and smart girl and talented too. She\ncould play piano. I taught her how to play chess and she right away, beat me. We were there\nduring the war. I was there probably from -- I knew her from September 12\", I think, the day\nthat I came to Lublin until we left for Warsaw. Then, of course, I was drawn back there under\nthe pretext that I want to go to the Russian zone and my parents didn\u2019t object. I came back to\nLublin already under German occupation and I was again welcomed and hospitality was\nextended to me by the Rosenbaums. Then, the next time was when I was being taken to this\nfarm work. You remember, when I was a volunteer, for the harvest, I also got to see Gina.\nLater on when I got fever, I got sick, and came back to Lublin, I was shown again hospitality.\nThey brought me, they really cared for me and nursed me there when I was very sick. I got\nmeasles at seventeen, 1s no fun. It\u2019s not fun at any time but not then. But being a contagious\nsickness, they were very kind that they wanted to do this. At one time, my brother, when he\ncame out to see me in those estates, he also stopped over there in Lublin and was shown\nhospitality there. Very kind people and they all perished. The father died during the Lublin\noccupation days, probably from ill health but the mother and daughter, Gina, the girl that I\nknew, they were shot 1n cold blood.",
        "A: She was very remarkable. I had to really condense in the book, I couldn\u2019t express all my\nsentiment and the feeling for them that was much greater. I felt that sometimes you say more\nby understating it than if you were to try and pour it all out.",
        "A: It shows. Because I felt that the intelligent reader will see; this will be like a soldier who goes\ninto battle what great things he did there. It is not so much that it would reflect on\nme but it is not necessary to emphasize the qualities because they are -- you can easily conclude\nthat these were fine people and very dear to me. As a matter of fact, I had a photograph of Gina\nand I think I had a photograph of her mother too, that I carried with me all through my\ninternment in Pilani and Ocencia and Budzyn. But when we came to Majdanek, they took\neverything away from me. They took every vestige of your personal life so that when they\ndress you up in those striped uniforms and the wooden shoes, you didn\u2019t have anything tangible\nwhich would connect you with the past except your memory.",
        "A: She would be a very good candidate. I think that perhaps this is just my suspicious mind\nperhaps but I think that her beauty had something to do with her undoing. Because I know\nsomething of the man who was the son of the owner who was already a married man only he\nstayed there; that something like this, especially a vulgar individual, that this would not escape\nhis attention, that this might have been the reason they were forced to run away from the farm.\nWhoever killed them were either the people that had something to do with the farm or someone\ntipped them off.",
        "A: Yes, in that case, Poles. You know Poles were capable of many admirable things on individual\nbasis. There were some exceptional cases like this salesgirl in Sevek\u2019s store, this Loja. Her\nname is Loja and she did a remarkable service to them because she, when they were already in\nhiding in this place called Tr and I hope I got that right, she had to bring, every\nmonth money for ---. They couldn\u2019t pay in advance because then they would take the money\nand their life would not be -- the life would not be safe. I mean you cannot say in every case,\nbut it happened many times when the Jews came in and gave everything to the owners and then\nthe owners gave them away anyway after they kept the money. So here she was coming in\nevery month to bring the money. She was also going and buying produce for the family, for the\nwhole family, vegetables because they did not want to arouse suspicion in the local store. They\nsuddenly buy so much when they were buying much less without these people. So they had to\ngo some distance away to another town, to a big town to buy the produce and food for the\nhousehold. Hi story is a book in itself. How they made the hiding place; he told me, for\ninstance, that they had to saw the boards off the floor. They were on the ground floor and there\nwas just a dugout beneath. It was not deep enough to really live there so they had to do two\nthings. They had to saw and sawing makes noise. There were people living directly above\nthem. How would they do it? The daughter of this woman where they stayed played piano,\nperhaps the mother. She played piano very loud piece while he was sawing the boards, loud\npiece. Then they had to find out how they were going to get rid of the sand that they dig up.\nThis is always shown in those escape pictures when they fantasize about it or they take it in\ntheir pants. It had to go out with the garbage pail, had to go to the garbage. I think they also --\nhe told me something about coal being there where they used some of that sand. They had a\ncoal bin someplace that was accessible to them. At one time, the Germans came in to this\napartment, officers and they requisitioned one room. The room was next room where they were\ndown in the bottom. They, my cousin Sevek, he regarded this as an insurance that the Germans\nlived there. No other German detachment will come and search the place.",
        "A: They would be above suspicion and they stayed there. But it put great restraint on them\nbecause usually --. He told me that during the wintertime, they would be sitting in a dugout but\nat night, they went to bed. In other words, there was like one spare bed. The only people that\nknew that they existed there was the mother, the wife of the guy that arranged this, this is the\nfellow that was from the Polish underground with the Socialist party and he was working in a\ntransportation department in Warsaw. His wife, the housekeeper and the daughter and the son.\nThe son worked for the Germans in one of the warehouses and he was stealing. At one time\nthey came and arrested him and he disappeared without a trace, took him to Auschwitz, maybe\nthey killed him.",
        "A: It was very stupid of him especially if since they had someone there. What if they started\nsearching the house for stolen goods and they would find the place? Because they had it cut out\nand it was covered with a little carpet rug and this is how they lived. Very interesting the way\nthey had to arrange; everything had to be thought out. All the time, during the daytime, he\nwould standing by the window and looking out who is coming through the gate. Whenever he\nseen \u2014 because this was not a single family dwelling, it was like a quadruplex and there were\nothers living on the second floor, but he had to see who comes to the main entrance of the\napartment. Always watching, if it was a stranger right away he and his wife had to go, get the\nunderneath. My uncle lived the same way because he was in my aunt\u2019s apartment but she had a\ndormer apartment so there was a false, there was a wall, and between the wall and a pitched\nroof. There was airspace. What they do, they cut out an opening and there was a mirror that had\nfour special attachment points. Every time that he suspected, heard steps on the stairway or\nsomething, he had to jump into that -- behind that mirror where they had a chair to sit on and\njust secure the mirror and hope that nobody gets wise to it.",
        "A: Yes, he was involved in the revolution. He came out of hiding and he fought with them. But\nafter it was crushed and all the Polish people were shipped to concentration camps or labor\ncamps, Warsaw was virtually emptied of people, there were people like my uncle who lived like\nscavengers on the ruins of the --. Because after emptying Warsaw, Hitler gave orders to destroy\nWarsaw.",
        "A: Right. So Warsaw was a --they claimed it was something like 65%, all the buildings were then\ndestroyed, or 60%.",
        "A: As long as they were deep underground, literally underground.",
        "A: A food problem. This 1s why -- he had to out --they were going usually at night because the\nplace was completely abandoned. Occasionally a patrol would pass by, then they would hide.\nBut he lived there from the end of the uprising which was probably, the uprising was in August-",
        "A: It was over so from the beginning of October until January when the Russians crossed the\nVistula River onto the west bank to Warsaw, he led this kind of existence. This apparently\ncaused his premature death because he died being about 65 in California and he died of some\nkind of liver ailment which might have been caused by the garbage that he had to eat at one\ntime.",
        "A: My God, there were so many. Of course, I was flogged but this was not the worst. The worst\nexperience happened in Majdanek, I think. When we arrived there, we were shipped from the\nLuftwaffe camp, Canjan were taken to Majdanek and on this train ride we were debating what\nto do. Most of us were young men; there were a few fathers among the young men that were\nwith their sons in that group. We were fortunate that we were only 88 to a boxcar, where else\nthere were about twice that number that they packed in others. Many people perished just from\nsuffocation when they --. We were debating what we should do, whether we should break out.\nThe train left about, with our contingent, about noontime, perhaps shortly before noon and was\njust meandering through the various places as it was going. We said like this, that if it is going\nto go in Treblinka, we have nothing to lose. We are just going to have to escape. I know that\nthere were people there already working on the floorOboards, trying to see if we could -- a novel\nway of escape trying to get out from the floor boards rather than the windows that were\nnormally used. They worked at it. I don\u2019t think that they did get very far with this operation\nbecause within 15 or 20 minutes we found out that we are on a line to Lublin, not Treblinka.\nWe felt that perhaps we are being taken to another labor camp. We didn\u2019t know that besides\nAuschwitz and Treblinka that there are so many death camps, we didn\u2019t know. We didn\u2019t know,\nmaybe we didn\u2019t want to know. We heard about the camps, like Sobibor. Once this was found\nout, so the attitude changed and the despair that dominated the mood in the boxcar subsided and\nthey say maybe we are going to the camp. People sort of tried to slide down because we\ncouldn\u2019t -- there was not enough room for everyone to sit or lie down but if everybody lean\nagainst everyone, somehow, the body sort of, like sardines, we were able to manage to be down\nwhere we could get some rest. Everybody got very thirsty because the boxcars, the sun beat on\nthem and it was hot. There was a fellow there with a bottle of water, He took out the bottle of\nwater that he had the presence of mind to take with him. We had bread that we took with us,\nour rations, but we didn\u2019t think of water, we did not think of that -- we didn\u2019t think of it, we\ndidn\u2019t anticipate that 1t would be needed here, a big bottle of water. He was going to have some\nof the water with his son. But when he looked at the faces of us all, he says, no, no, my son,\nwe'll have to share this water. Somehow a spoon was produced and everybody got a tablespoon\nof water. This is the way it went all around. But the moment, I think my moment of greater\ndespair came at the end of the journey because I could say when I stood in Lublin before a\nfiring squad, was this the worst moment? No, because it happened so quickly and it came as a\nsurprise. Before we got scared enough, become numb. It was all over. I was also, a gun was\npointed at me in Lublin on a railroad station by a drunk, an SS officer. This ended up without\nme being shot. But here we\u2019re traveling on this train and there\u2019s time on our hands and we were\nable to think. Then it got dark and darker. Finally the train slowed down and it was already\nbeyond, not quite so dark that you couldn\u2019t see but it was already further along than the dust,\nthe hour of twilight when you can still see things relatively well. The train -- there was also\nanother incident. During the ride on the train, a Polish peasant stood when the train was very\nslowly moving after many stops that it made to give priority to other trains. He seen our train\nand he crossed himself. So I said why would he do this unless we are a cargo assigned to\nextermination. I say after all, going to a labor camp still leaves -- there is room for hope.\n(End of Tape 11.)\nThe movement of the train, very slow movement, when the train is --when they are moving\nsections of the train on the final terminal; there\u2019s more literally, this is literally what terminal is\nthe right word to use, the train was moving very slowly. You have the descending darkness, you\nsee that we are being pushed through a tall masonry wall. It suddenly, it gave me the\nforeboding that we are being brought into the extermination point, because we were not given\nany rations for the trip; people were packed like sardines. If you want to get work out of slaves,\nyou have to give them living room, you have to treat them with a modicum of satisfying the\nbasic needs of subsistence to live on. No water, nothing given for us to urinate or to tend to all\nother needs that are basic needs and suddenly this descending darkness and the train slowly --\nthe train -- like we were going through the gates of hell.",
        "A: And the train came to a stop. When the train was traveling, we couldn\u2019t hear nothing because\nyou just hear the noise of the railroad tracks and the rails and the wind and so forth. But when\nthe train stopped, you could hear the screams of the women and children in other boxcars where\nthey had women and children, where they were packed very heavily. Because the heat was\nunbearable and they had no room to urinate, they had no room for anything. There was crying\nand lamenting and it all suggested a premonition of impending death by some means that we\ndon\u2019t know yet; whether it will be gas chambers or they have something else in store for us.\nThen on the platforms, which on the right and a platform on the left which separated us from\nthe other section of the train, there were big floodlights and there were guards that were\nstanding on both sides. Were just maybe two or three guards. All of a sudden you hear the\nsound of a rolling door open and a man, stripped down to his trunks, runs out of this heat. He\njust runs and the Germans, the German guards, they begin to hunt him like a rabbit. He says,\nIch , Lhave him! He says , halt. This and so forth, then you hear two shots\nand you see this guy collapsing underneath one of those floodlights. By that time the\ntemperature must have dropped, this was in May, and you could see like a steam coming out\nfrom his mouth, the blood was running out of his neck. He was laying there, a human being.\nAll he wanted was a little air and he was shot for that. When I seen this, this scene itself was a -\n-I seen people killed before by the Germans. I have seen them in the Warsaw Ghetto but I have\nnever seen this, when you put all these elements together, under such circumstances. Then the\nimmediate logical conclusion is that we are not coming into any labor camp. If you begin to\nadd all these things and as the morning began to dawn, there was a rabbi in our boxcar. We\nhave a prayer that is said before death; it 1s called confession before death, people say it. He\nbegan to say the confession and he had a younger brother, Hanok was his name. That guy\nbegan to cry that he is only twenty years old. This crying and praying became very unnerving\nto us although a man has a right to say what he wants before he dies. We were still not\nconvinced that this is the end of the line. Nevertheless somebody asked them that they should\nstop this sobbing business and all this, wait to see what happens in the morning. In the\nmorning, when they open the boxcars, there came a Jewish crew that was working and the\nGermans and the dogs, the whole circus. They began to open the doors of the car and they\nbegin to pile out the dead bodies from the boxcars. Ours was the only boxcar that didn\u2019t have\nany dead bodies but from all other cars, they were putting the bodies. The Jewish crew went in\nand they were putting the bodies by stacking them in pyres, one on top of the other in squares. I\nseen young women, young men, it was just a frightening sight when you see so much death\naround you. We were bewildered -- there were two hand grenades laying on the bottom of our\nfloor. In other words, one of the -- some of our men had hand grenades and they were prepared\nto make a fight for it, if we escaped. If we escaped and went to the woods, we would have\nsomething; I mean that was the intention. I remember when we empty the car, the SS men take\na look in the car; they seen the hand grenades and they ignored it. This was the final indication\nthat we are slated for death because if we are not, they would certainly not allow something like\nthis to go unpunished. They would want a guilty party and they would make an execution; they\nwould try to show how they deal with something like this.",
        "A: It doesn\u2019t matter because we---. Then we were put in a, those that survived the trip were put in\na column five abreast. The column was standing there and forming. While they were forming\nand we seen that the crew---. Another thing 1s the cleaning crew that was working there, the\nJews who were part of the crew of this camp, they wouldn\u2019t speak to us. If we ask them, where\nare we? What is awaiting us? They didn\u2019t say anything. So you got the impression like you\nwere on an operating table; you are in a hospital and you see the nurses in white aprons looking\nat you as though you were dead already. We didn\u2019t know that they were not allowed to speak to\nus, we didn\u2019t know that. Then the column began to form and there were about a dozen of SS\nmen on each side of the column, guards with rifles. They were going to escort us wherever we\nwere going to go. We begin the procession, slowly. When I was walking, I was bewildered,\nwhat was happening there? My thoughts were very incoherent, in a situation like this. The SS\nman that was on my left, that was next to me, I record this in the book, he said to me, Veir albist\ndu?, how old are you? I said, Ich bin I told him I was 18 years old. He answered me\nI , 1m nineteen.. He says , It\u2019s a pity that you have to die. He said it to\nme, he meant it; he had no---. That was \u2014 this is the way he felt apparently. We were\neventually separated from those that went to the gas chambers; but this moment, these moments\nin my life, including this question and answer and the pile-up of bodies in the morning and a\nbeautiful morning to be surrounded by death, this arrival; this 1s probably the worst that I had to\nface. Because after that I became already immune to these -- not immune but I began to realize\nthat sooner or later they\u2019re going to get us. That there\u2019s a very slim chance of survival. So I\nwas not going to get again -- I would not panic anymore in a situation that was awaiting.",
        "A: Well, for some people who survived that particular moment was not the best thing because they\nperished later and they just suffered more. But this was such a terrifying thing, this whole\nthing, the arrival, the descending darkness, the crying of the women, the pitiful crying of the\nchildren, and then the killing of that man who just run for a breath of fresh air, the prayers of the\nrabbi who survived, he lives in Pittsburgh. I met him in Israel one time unexpectedly, and his\nbrother survived. All these things are just terrifying more than anything else that I have\nexperienced before or since. Although I had many close calls after, I was with a flogged person;\nit didn\u2019t affect me as badly as this. I\u2019m not going to tell you how we got out of this situation\nbecause then nobody\u2019s going to buy my book.",
        "A: I thought Auschwitz had the orchestra.",
        "A: Forty-three.",
        "A: May 12\" or May 13\".",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Could be because we were not, unbeknown to us, we were not in the camp proper. We were in\nthe entrance camp and the reason they had the guards because they had to march us yet through\na street which I think is called Helmska B because it leads to hell. That would take us\nto Majdanek and to the gas chambers. This was our fate. I studied the records of it from a book\nthat was written of Majdanek, by a Polish writer. It\u2019s not translated into English yet. I bought it\nin Poland when I was there. It said in that period of time, there were no registrations,\neverybody was going -- especially from the Warsaw Ghetto -- everybody was going straight\ninto the gas chambers. Actually I was twice in Majdanek. At this time when we were sent to\nBudzyn and when we were shipped to Budzyn en route to Plaszow, we detoured in Majdanek so\nI was their guest again. I omitted telling you -- it occurred to me that I omitted telling you --\nsomething about my uncle Meynek. As you know, we came to Budzyn from this transport in\nsecond week of May. That would put it about May 13 or thereabout. When we arrived there,\nwe found out that there was already one group of Warsaw survivors, Warsaw Ghetto uprising\nsurvivors who arrived there a week earlier. One of the survivors, I believe his name was\nKaufmann, a young fellow my age, recognized me and he said I got something to tell you about\nyour Uncle Meynek. He was in our transport with his wife, that would be Irka on the\numschlagplatz after the crushing of the Warsaw Ghetto uprising, they were herded on the\numschlagplatz into boxcars. While he was in the boxcar with his wife, he was trying to bribe a\nUkrainian guard, either to let him go which seems very unlikely; it seemed very unlikely that he\nwould have asked him for it. Or he might have asked him for water because they were selling\nwater for something like 500 zlotys a glass if they got the money. However, the Ukrainian\nguard after taking the money, shot my uncle and his wife, Irka, pulled off his riding boots from\nhis legs, feet, and this is how my uncle came to an end. I believe he was born 1907, he would\nhave -- this was in May of 1943, he would have been 36 years old. This is the story of our\nfamily. We had very few survivors. That would be my Uncle Ben survived, my Aunt Rose\nsurvived because she was on Aryan papers and she was able to hide her identity and the only\nother survivor was myself and my grandmother who left Poland on the last ship that reached the\nUnited States. My father died in Majdanek, now we know, my mother and my youngest\nbrother, Meir at Treblinka. Szymon still remains as enigma, as to what happened to him.",
        "A: Yes, it\u2019s hard to imagine that this late, we would not have been able to establish contact. Since\neven if he lived in Spain, he would know that most survivors went either to Israel or the United\nStates or Canada and he would have tried to exhaust these things. There were no enquiries for\nme.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: But you know what? All this brings me to this understanding --that we, the Jewish people, are\nvery old people. We have survived rising and falling civilizations. The Germans were trying to\nput an end to the Jewish people in a most barbaric way in the annals of mankind. They didn\u2019t\nsucceed and I don\u2019t think that any ruthless dictatorship would, in the future, succeed. But they\nnever stop trying. Okay, I think that we had enough.\n"
