I don\u2019t remember what we were eating. It\u2019s like breaking out.\nAnyways, but each train oh and the worst thing I meant to tell you. How we survived going to\nRussia.\nDuring the bombing, my father and my brother went to look for food. Because everything was\nopen. The stores, nobody was there to take care of there, they were afraid of the bombs. So they\nbrought back a sack of tobacco and one sack of rice. They carried on their shoulders. And that\nkept us going to go to Russia. Can you imagine. And each, every time that we needed some\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 12, 2013\nbread a little tobacco we were able to get in Russia, a piece of bread. So this was very important\nthings that my father and brother did.\nAnyways, it\u2019s nice to talk about it and it\u2019s nice to forget a lot.",

We end up ourselves straight to Germany. To the\nDP camp. Because you know DP camp we didn\u2019t know where we want to go. We were not\nZionistically minded. We didn\u2019t want to go to Israel because my mother\u2019s logic, we had enough\nwar. We don\u2019t want to be in a war zone. That made sense to me too. Anyway, that\u2019s I\u2019m sure\nmany people feel that way. But they were mostly young people were very patriotic singing all\nthe Hebrew songs which I didn\u2019t ever learn. Would be nice to know.",

Some\ntook engineering just to start with but we didn\u2019t have time to finish, because we had to get, plan\nthe future. Where to go. They had a theater organizer with a lot of actors.

Sections.\nSo I resent that about Israel but they are apologizing now. They keep saying they\u2019re teaching the\nchildren Yiddish now. I said no you\u2019re teaching the children Yiddish now but you neglected it\nso many years. It\u2019s going to disappear with us.\nBut Herman told things it\u2019s growing better, the Yiddish. I don\u2019t know if maybe he\u2019s right. The\nuniversity they teach and Yiddish 1s only strictly for the European Jews.",

        "Q: Today do you think people have learned the lessons?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so. Because if you see around the world it\u2019s happening different nations. There\nis so much discrimination even now.

        "A: Not necessarily because I don\u2019t, I\u2019m more comfortable with the survivors than the born\nCanadians that don\u2019t know anything what\u2019s happening. But are ignorant at the, and I find that\nthey don\u2019t know. Only my friends that lived in Montreal that belonged to Jewish communities,\nthey know a little bit. But they don\u2019t know the history of Europe. She tells me, one of my friends,\nI don\u2019t want to know about it. So it means you cannot communicate. You communicate better\nwith the survivors. You have a better conversation, understanding I would say.",

So I said to her\nit doesn\u2019t make sense. You want to take me on a trip, we\u2019ll go somewhere else. That\u2019s it. Maybe\nI made a mistake. At 80, was the right time. Now I\u2019m 85. No, most of my friends went back.",
        "Q: Did go back?",
        "A: And they are disappointed. Some of the Polish people feel why are you coming back to get\nback your houses. It\u2019s horrible. Horrible. Yeah you must have read about Felix Zeidman. His\nstory 1s unbelievable. And he was full of hate all those years. Until at the end he forgive the\nPolish family helped him to survive. He made honors, he honored them, took them to Israel. So\nyou read the whole story?",
        "Q: Iam familiar with his story.",
        "A: It\u2019s an unbelievable story. Listen the stories of life are beautiful but you don\u2019t have to live\nwith it. To live with it, you get depressed. You know you get down. And I am a very easy\nperson to get depressed. So I have to be careful. I am going very often into a depression.",

        "A: No, no, no.",
        "Q: You just handle it yourself",
        "A: Ihave to pull it out myself. I look around. I see other people have worse and I am still the\nlucky one so that\u2019s why I figure it out. So when I told my daughter, you are depressed. No, no,\nno you don\u2019t tranquilizer for that. No, no, no. you have to do it yourself. Physical exercise. I do\na lot of yoga. I\u2019m a physical person. Maybe that\u2019s why I survived.",
        "Q: Where is your brother?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 12, 2013",
        "A: Oh he died. Five years ago. My best picture is with him. Such a strong life, a love for me,\nunbelievable.",
        "Q: Did he come to Canada too?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah he was living in Canada but he was living in Montreal for a while. And he never\nsucceeded here because he didn\u2019t have a diploma from here. So he had to work as a draughtsman\ninstead of engineer. And but in Poland, we were supporting him. I was supporting him for 15,\n20 dollars a month. That was enough for him to survive. But then when he came to Canada he\nhad a struggle. Because she was not able to help. I can get any type of job, whatever I wanted. I\nwas able to get. And some people cannot help. So I am too helpful sometimes. And then I go\ninto this depression. Not long. Anyways. I hope you are not tired of talking to me.",

        "Q: The knowledge about life.",

You make the best of every situation\nbut you\u2019re not a happy person. But you have to analyze that you could be worse. And you\u2019re\nlucky what you have. Anyways, I always feel I didn\u2019t do enough for other people.",
        "Q: You\u2019re talking about during the war or \u2014",
        "A: No, no, no after the war. After the war. I could have done much more but my late husband\nwould stop me all the time. If I wanted to go to university, he did not approve of it. You\u2019re going\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 12, 2013\nto be away too much. But when he died, I did go. I took five courses in one year and I got so sick\nand tired physically. I overdid it. So I took two years at university and I didn\u2019t continue. I put\ntoo much pressure on myself. That\u2019s a pressure person. And that\u2019s enough. Now I have to make\nthe best of everything. To see anybody that survived like me because most of the people I see\ndepressed and going into dementia and it\u2019s frightening. I still drive.",
        "Q: Do you?",
        "A: Oh yes, to me the best pleasure is when I drive on my own and I listen to classical music, yes.\nThis is very important. That\u2019s why I came to Washington by car.",
        "Q: What are your thoughts about the Holocaust Museum in Washington?",
        "A: It\u2019s absolutely beautiful. Except til I saw the fire in Poland. I cannot look at them you know.\nActually the tragedy, the uniforms the shoes. I had to avoid looking at that. Because that\u2019s like a\npain in the chest. How people survived many of them. But Hitler it\u2019s a shock how people could\nbe cruel, but it\u2019s happening all over again in different countries. So how can we change the\nworld? I like to see it change. Like the orthodox do believe the messiah. Where is he? I like to\nbelieve in it. Anyways, theater would be good for you to relax your brain. They\u2019re playing a lot\nof plays here, Yiddish plays in my area. And the reading a lot, that helps.",
        "Q: How old are your grandchildren?",
        "A: My granddaughter, the older one is 28, going to be and the younger one 22. The 22 is not\nsettled. She\u2019s finishing her last year university. She doesn\u2019t taking psychology. She 1s taking\nphilosophy. I says where you going to go with that. She would like to get the same degree that\nher mother has but it\u2019s not necessary. Not everybody has the same capability. So she has to\ndecide this year. She\u2019s undecided girl, but the most adorable person. The older one is graduated\nfrom university in social work. Actually she\u2019s working for the government for seeing the\nmistakes university are doing. If they need help they call the office where she works to\nreorganize it. That\u2019s a good job for her. But not, she went to private school so she has an easier\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 12, 2013\ntime to face life than the younger one. So my daughter made a mistake with the younger one,\nnot sending her to private school for four years. Because the preparation 1s easier. You are\nprepared for university pressure. And when you don\u2019t have the push you cannot take the\npressure. The younger one couldn\u2019t take the pressure so she had to stretch from four years to five\nwhich is ok. But still they are wonderful children. Can\u2019t complain.",

        "A: That you have only good children.",
        "Q: Anything else you wanted to add before we close.",
        "A: No. No, because you know there are so many things on the mind that come and go. And you\ncannot remember everything, but whatever I remember it\u2019s very hard to face for other people.\nWhen I hear somebody say starving, I\u2019m starving. I say please don\u2019t use that word starving.\nBecause they don\u2019t know the meaning of it. Starving, not to see a piece of bread for four years,\nnot to see a tomato. Not to see altogether, I didn\u2019t have anything. For four years. How I\nsurvived, I\u2019m still here, I must have been very, very strong person, even being a celiac. Anyway,\nbecause people think they don\u2019t eat on time. I\u2019m starving, I have to go to a restaurant to eat.\nAbsolutely not. Control your brain. Take a glass of water before you starve so you don\u2019t starve.\nI don\u2019t like that word starving. Because nobody knows the meaning unless you do it. Anyways I\ntalk too much. That\u2019s my problem. I do, I do. I\u2019m very outspoken and one of my friends, I just\nhad a Canadian girl with a pace maker, she gets depressed because she is doing a lot of work,\namazing woman. But she is absent minded person. And she calls me up to relax. So she said\nafter I talk to you we, cause she cannot get used to the pace maker. And she not a week, not a\nday it\u2019s going to take months. And she wants to go back to dancing now. I said you can do it but\nbe careful. So she fell and I\u2019m trying to help her but there 1s a limit how much I can do. You\nhave to do it yourself. Right. Maybe I am too logical. Really. Nobody can analyze me. Only\nyourself, you have to analyze. We have to just try and make the best and not to be depressed. I\ndo go into the depression. I can cry easy. Is that better? I am just listening if I cry easy. Very\neasy. Something on television that reminds me of Europe, I can cry.

We\nhad no money.\nSo he said I\u2019m going to tell the farmer that takes me across, that you have no money but he\nshould take whatever you have in the house. And you know my mother didn\u2019t believe it\u2019s going\nto happen. And next morning 6:00 the farmer did call on the door and he told me that Doctor\nDolinsky sent me. I took him on the other side of the border. Was a neutral border between\nPoland and Russia that was open, supposed to be open 12 or 14 days. So she, the farmer\nknocked on the door and he says yes, I know you have no money. So he took what we had, a\nsewing machine and a customer\u2019s fur coat that was hanging behind a screen.

I don\u2019t remember what we were eating. It\u2019s like breaking out.\nAnyways, but each train oh and the worst thing I meant to tell you. How we survived going to\nRussia.\nDuring the bombing, my father and my brother went to look for food. Because everything was\nopen. The stores, nobody was there to take care of there, they were afraid of the bombs. So they\nbrought back a sack of tobacco and one sack of rice. They carried on their shoulders. And that\nkept us going to go to Russia. Can you imagine. And each, every time that we needed some\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 12, 2013\nbread a little tobacco we were able to get in Russia, a piece of bread. So this was very important\nthings that my father and brother did.\nAnyways, it\u2019s nice to talk about it and it\u2019s nice to forget a lot.",

We end up ourselves straight to Germany. To the\nDP camp. Because you know DP camp we didn\u2019t know where we want to go. We were not\nZionistically minded. We didn\u2019t want to go to Israel because my mother\u2019s logic, we had enough\nwar. We don\u2019t want to be in a war zone. That made sense to me too.

        "A: No, no. Only the pictures if I see the bombing of Poland and fire all over cause my father\ntook me by the hand to see it, to run from one uncle to another to see who is alive. If nobody\nwas hurt. During the bombing before Hitler walked in. The bombing was more frightening for\nme with the fire all around.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 12, 2013\nRunning from one place to another, nowhere to hide. And then visiting his sister with seven\nchildren hiding in a little place. And the orthodox brother refused to see a doctor and the little\nboy of 14 had to have an appendicitis. He said no god would help. No, he died at home because I\ndidn\u2019t know if this was money problem or because he was ultra-orthodox. It could be both.\nNow this horror story from that family.",
        "A: I try not to but it comes back. Whenever a situation if I talk to other people, I see oh I realize\nsimilar situation to what I had. I know some of my people went to concentration camp, and they\ndon\u2019t talk about it. They don\u2019t want to talk about it.",
        "A: No. I feel Jewish.",
        "A: Yeah I am born Jewish and I respect that and I honor it, but I am not a traditional person, not\nreligious. Because of the upbringing.",
        "A: Canadian yeah right away. I am proud of being Canadian. My best time in my life I had in\nMontreal because I met nice people that helped me even without the language. She introduced\nme to swimming and skiing and that was 40 years of her life. She was doing for me.",
        "A: Yeah I skied with her and I, you see a met a new world. I never had a chance.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 12, 2013",
        "A: Yes, I play the piano.",
        "A: Yeah, the piano classical but now I\u2019m taking a senior group. They are teaching a little more\nthan classical because we want to play pieces without being so serious. So it\u2019s a nice group,\nYamaha school of music and they have a senior group.",
        "A: A little jazz yes. It\u2019s beautiful. The relationship for the piano if I can hold it. If my back\ndoesn\u2019t go for two hours.",
        "A: You know she has a little biography from me and she knows a lot but she doesn\u2019t want to talk\nabout it. Like today yesterday I was visiting my niece. That was my, from my brother, from the\nPolish wife. And she is more interested in my daughter in that. No, because she doesn\u2019t know\nthat much.",
        "A: Oh yeah she has two daughters.",
        "A: No, they\u2019re children. They are not interested at all. I don\u2019t talk about it. I think Hannah the\nyounger one would be. I think my daughter is too hard person to discuss it. Leave it alone she\nsays. And I don\u2019t think she\u2019s right.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 12, 2013",
        "A: I didn\u2019t get til now. I was applying and they sent a horrible letter I got from Germany. There\nwas no reason for me to leave from Poland. Can you imagine a letter like that. When I showed\nit to the lawyer here, but now they asking we should reapply. So I reapplied and they sent from\nAustralia 5000 dollars. Ok the lawyer took up 3200. Can you imagine? Then actually this layer\nthat I have now, Mr. Shapiro was very upset. He sent another letter to them. How dare you\ncharge for that, for the compensation. So they sent me another 3000 dollars. That was the whole\ncompensation. No I didn\u2019t got monthly like other people did because many people, I know some\npeople that didn\u2019t tell the truth. And I am a straightforward person. I don\u2019t want to, I never lied in\nmy life.",
        "A: The country 1s ok if you\u2019re very patriotic, Zionistic. They are harsh people. They destroyed\nthe Jewish language. Because they feel we are beneath them and this I resent about Israel.",
        "A: Yiddish yeah. They built it up, they built up their own language to this and I have a big\narticle. I wish, maybe I still have it. That was a mistake. Right when the country became a\ncountry, should have been taught equal Yiddish and Hebrew, but no to them Yiddish is only\nEuropean Jews are speaking Yiddish. And Hasidim, some of them. Sections.\nSo I resent that about Israel but they are apologizing now. They keep saying they\u2019re teaching the\nchildren Yiddish now. I said no you\u2019re teaching the children Yiddish now but you neglected it\nso many years. It\u2019s going to disappear with us.\nBut Herman told things it\u2019s growing better, the Yiddish. I don\u2019t know if maybe he\u2019s right. The\nuniversity they teach and Yiddish 1s only strictly for the European Jews.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 12, 2013",
        "A: Never, they never learned the lessons. Because there, everybody was closed for us. The\nworst thing that England didn\u2019t do anything. Canada didn\u2019t do anything. The boats were sent\nback. It was shocking, absolutely shocking.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so. Because if you see around the world it\u2019s happening different nations. There\nis so much discrimination even now. Jewish or other nationalities and I don\u2019t know if you knew\nin the states about this artist\u2019s reminder of the ugly times. He built a lot of buildings all over\nCanada. Lieber, I can see it, I can see his name. I have it right in front of me, Liberhart,\nLiberstrom. And he\u2019s an art. Daniel.",
        "A: You heard about him. Reminder of ugly times. But he made a lot of, he 1s very much against\nEnglish politics way back. England and Roosevelt they didn\u2019t do anything. It\u2019s absolutely\nhorrible.",
        "A: Not necessarily because I don\u2019t, I\u2019m more comfortable with the survivors than the born\nCanadians that don\u2019t know anything what\u2019s happening. But are ignorant at the, and I find that\nthey don\u2019t know. Only my friends that lived in Montreal that belonged to Jewish communities,\nthey know a little bit. But they don\u2019t know the history of Europe. She tells me, one of my friends,\nI don\u2019t want to know about it. So it means you cannot communicate. You communicate better\nwith the survivors. You have a better conversation, understanding I would say.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 12, 2013",
        "A: No. it\u2019s amazing. My daughter wants to go to see where I went to school, the park. If the\nstreet doesn\u2019t exist. And I really felt that why should we waste money in Poland. So I said to her\nit doesn\u2019t make sense. You want to take me on a trip, we\u2019ll go somewhere else. That\u2019s it. Maybe\nI made a mistake. At 80, was the right time. Now I\u2019m 85. No, most of my friends went back.",
        "A: And they are disappointed. Some of the Polish people feel why are you coming back to get\nback your houses. It\u2019s horrible. Horrible. Yeah you must have read about Felix Zeidman. His\nstory 1s unbelievable. And he was full of hate all those years. Until at the end he forgive the\nPolish family helped him to survive. He made honors, he honored them, took them to Israel. So\nyou read the whole story?",
        "A: It\u2019s an unbelievable story. Listen the stories of life are beautiful but you don\u2019t have to live\nwith it. To live with it, you get depressed. You know you get down. And I am a very easy\nperson to get depressed. So I have to be careful. I am going very often into a depression.",
        "A: No, no, no.",
        "A: Ihave to pull it out myself. I look around. I see other people have worse and I am still the\nlucky one so that\u2019s why I figure it out. So when I told my daughter, you are depressed. No, no,\nno you don\u2019t tranquilizer for that. No, no, no. you have to do it yourself. Physical exercise. I do\na lot of yoga. I\u2019m a physical person. Maybe that\u2019s why I survived.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 12, 2013",
        "A: Oh he died. Five years ago. My best picture is with him. Such a strong life, a love for me,\nunbelievable.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah he was living in Canada but he was living in Montreal for a while. And he never\nsucceeded here because he didn\u2019t have a diploma from here. So he had to work as a draughtsman\ninstead of engineer. And but in Poland, we were supporting him. I was supporting him for 15,\n20 dollars a month. That was enough for him to survive. But then when he came to Canada he\nhad a struggle. Because she was not able to help. I can get any type of job, whatever I wanted. I\nwas able to get. And some people cannot help. So I am too helpful sometimes. And then I go\ninto this depression. Not long. Anyways. I hope you are not tired of talking to me.",
        "A: They think I succeeded in life more than other people with education. So at my 80\" birthday\nthat\u2019s what they told me. Even my daughter said. What you have I don\u2019t have with a PhD.",
        "A: The knowledge about life. Yeah but you know you\u2019re never happy with anything when you\ngo through this war. You\u2019re really not happy person, no. You make the best of every situation\nbut you\u2019re not a happy person. But you have to analyze that you could be worse. And you\u2019re\nlucky what you have. Anyways, I always feel I didn\u2019t do enough for other people.",
        "A: No, no, no after the war. After the war. I could have done much more but my late husband\nwould stop me all the time. If I wanted to go to university, he did not approve of it. You\u2019re going\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 12, 2013\nto be away too much. But when he died, I did go. I took five courses in one year and I got so sick\nand tired physically. I overdid it. So I took two years at university and I didn\u2019t continue. I put\ntoo much pressure on myself. That\u2019s a pressure person. And that\u2019s enough. Now I have to make\nthe best of everything. To see anybody that survived like me because most of the people I see\ndepressed and going into dementia and it\u2019s frightening. I still drive.",
        "A: Oh yes, to me the best pleasure is when I drive on my own and I listen to classical music, yes.\nThis is very important. That\u2019s why I came to Washington by car.",
        "A: It\u2019s absolutely beautiful. Except til I saw the fire in Poland. I cannot look at them you know.\nActually the tragedy, the uniforms the shoes. I had to avoid looking at that. Because that\u2019s like a\npain in the chest. How people survived many of them. But Hitler it\u2019s a shock how people could\nbe cruel, but it\u2019s happening all over again in different countries. So how can we change the\nworld? I like to see it change. Like the orthodox do believe the messiah. Where is he? I like to\nbelieve in it. Anyways, theater would be good for you to relax your brain. They\u2019re playing a lot\nof plays here, Yiddish plays in my area. And the reading a lot, that helps.",
        "A: My granddaughter, the older one is 28, going to be and the younger one 22. The 22 is not\nsettled. She\u2019s finishing her last year university. She doesn\u2019t taking psychology. She 1s taking\nphilosophy. I says where you going to go with that. She would like to get the same degree that\nher mother has but it\u2019s not necessary. Not everybody has the same capability. So she has to\ndecide this year. She\u2019s undecided girl, but the most adorable person. The older one is graduated\nfrom university in social work. Actually she\u2019s working for the government for seeing the\nmistakes university are doing. If they need help they call the office where she works to\nreorganize it. That\u2019s a good job for her. But not, she went to private school so she has an easier\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 12, 2013\ntime to face life than the younger one. So my daughter made a mistake with the younger one,\nnot sending her to private school for four years. Because the preparation 1s easier. You are\nprepared for university pressure. And when you don\u2019t have the push you cannot take the\npressure. The younger one couldn\u2019t take the pressure so she had to stretch from four years to five\nwhich is ok. But still they are wonderful children. Can\u2019t complain.",
        "A: That you have only good children.",
        "A: No. No, because you know there are so many things on the mind that come and go. And you\ncannot remember everything, but whatever I remember it\u2019s very hard to face for other people.\nWhen I hear somebody say starving, I\u2019m starving. I say please don\u2019t use that word starving.\nBecause they don\u2019t know the meaning of it. Starving, not to see a piece of bread for four years,\nnot to see a tomato. Not to see altogether, I didn\u2019t have anything. For four years. How I\nsurvived, I\u2019m still here, I must have been very, very strong person, even being a celiac. Anyway,\nbecause people think they don\u2019t eat on time. I\u2019m starving, I have to go to a restaurant to eat.\nAbsolutely not. Control your brain. Take a glass of water before you starve so you don\u2019t starve.\nI don\u2019t like that word starving. Because nobody knows the meaning unless you do it. Anyways I\ntalk too much. That\u2019s my problem. I do, I do. I\u2019m very outspoken and one of my friends, I just\nhad a Canadian girl with a pace maker, she gets depressed because she is doing a lot of work,\namazing woman. But she is absent minded person. And she calls me up to relax. So she said\nafter I talk to you we, cause she cannot get used to the pace maker. And she not a week, not a\nday it\u2019s going to take months. And she wants to go back to dancing now. I said you can do it but\nbe careful. So she fell and I\u2019m trying to help her but there 1s a limit how much I can do. You\nhave to do it yourself. Right. Maybe I am too logical. Really. Nobody can analyze me. Only\nyourself, you have to analyze. We have to just try and make the best and not to be depressed. I\ndo go into the depression. I can cry easy. Is that better? I am just listening if I cry easy. Very\neasy. Something on television that reminds me of Europe, I can cry. Yeah, of course.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAugust 12, 2013",
        "A: Of course.",
        "A: I think you have enough of me.",
