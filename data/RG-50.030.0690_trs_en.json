        "Answer: My name is Samuel Marein-Efron, spelled \u2014 hyphenated last name, and I\nwas born in Budapest, Hungary on May 5\", 1933. And my parents\u2019 names were\nDavid and Dwojra, d-w-o-j-r-a, which is basically Polish for Deborah. My father\nwas born in a little town near Bialystok, called Krynki, k-r-y-n-k-i. And my\nmother was actually born in Kiev, in the Ukraine. And in order to \u2014 to get back in \u2014\ninto Poland after the we \u2014 welma \u2014 when the Russian revolution started, they had to\nf \u2014 get her a false Polish birth certificate. And theoretically, on official papers, it\nappears that she was born in Bialystok.",
        "Q: Your parents moved to Budapest. When did they move to Budapest, and why?\nWhat was the \u2014",
        "A: Well, it \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 it has the \u2014 it has a history. My father was doing quite well in\nPoland, until Pilsudski came in. Then there was something which 1s referred to\nhistorically as the Ugannah(ph). And basically what that was, it was a tax system\nwhich taxed artisans and industrialists, and didn\u2019t do very much for landowners, or\nothers. So my father was pressed financially, and he gave up \u2014 basically they soldMay 8, 2013\ntheir factories in Poland, and the \u2014 they \u2014 my uncles remained, and they used to\nrent space in \u2014 in other factories, but my father, at first, moved to Finland. And that\nwas a little bit too far from \u2014 from Poland. So he moved again to Zemun in \u2014 well,\ntoday it is Serbia. And in Serbia he had a bad experience, he ran in with a cousin of\nthe king, who liked his business, so they gave him 72 hours to leave the country.\nAnd he had a \u2014 a number of jobs, until finally he \u2014 he found a job with a very big\nHungarian complex called Csepel, that was run by a \u2014 a Jewish entrepreneur,\nManfred George \u2014 actually, George Manfred. Hungarians, they do it the other\nway around. And he was head of \u2014 he first became the head of the factory that they\nhad in Slovakia, in Zylina, z-y-l-i-n-a. And first my mother wouldn\u2019t \u2014 wouldn\u2019t\nthink of \u2014 of living there, and nunb \u2014 it was the center of \u2014 basically, of Slovakian\nnationalism. This man Klinker(ph) and \u2014 and Tiso(ph), this was their main \u2014 main\ncenter of operations. And so my mother was very unhappy there, so she said \u2014 she s\n\u2014 when she found out that she was pregnant, she decided that she \u2014 this was not the\nplace to deliver a child. So, we moved to the headquarters of the conglomerate,\nwhich was Budapest.",
        "Q: Could you say the name of the company again, and spell it?",
        "A: It was called Csepel, c-s-e-p-e-l.",
        "Q: And what \u2014 what did it do? What kind of company was it?\nMay 8, 2013",
        "A: It was a huge complex, basically. It\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s biggest income came from food,\nfrom importing and export \u2014 basically exporting Hungarian agricultural products,\nbut he was also the main producer of aluminum in Hungary. He \u2014 they had a\ngenerators sunk into the Danube. And not only did they produce aluminum, they \u2014\nthey actually gave el-electricity to \u2014 to Budapest. And another thing which they\nused to do were \u2014 was airplane parts. They used to manufacture airplane parts, and\nthey had a big, big textile complex on the island. It \u2014 Csepel is really the name of an\nisland in the Danube, but it was called Csepel, the complex itself. It\u2019s \u2014 it \u2014 it\nbasically \u2014 he \u2014 he was pro \u2014 th-the owner was probably the second or third we-\nwealthiest person in \u2014 in \u2014 in Hungary. And he \u2014 he \u2014 he was basically very, very\nfriendly with the government. In \u2014 and \u2014 any time they were short 10 \u2014 10 or 15\nmillion dollars, he would lend it to them, in lieu of taxes, so you know, the \u2014 the \u2014\nthere was a very good relationship between him and the Hungarian government.",
        "Q: And you were born in Budapest, after your parents had moved to Hungary?",
        "A: I was born in Budapest, yes.",
        "Q: When were you born?",
        "A: May 5\", 1933.",
        "Q: 1933. Can you describe your early life; what it was like as an immigrant in\nHungary, or your parents\u2019 lives as immigrants; school, religion?\nMay 8, 2013",
        "A: Well, I\u2014 I\u2014I was literally considered a Hungarian, even though by law, I wasn\u2019t\none. In Hungary, to be Hungarian citizen, you had to have your father to be a\nHungarian citizen, which my father was not. He was a \u2014 a Polish citizenship. He \u2014\nhe \u2014 he was born actually in the Russian part of Poland, but after Versailles, that\nbecame again, it was recu \u2014 constituted as Poland, so he re \u2014 he became a Polish\ncitizen. But I \u2014 I was considered a Hungarian in school and elsewhere. My parents \u2014\nHungarian is a very difficult language, and my mother spoke it passably, my father\nvery, very little, and my sister learned to speak Hungarian quite \u2014 quite well, I\nmean. My sibling is seven and a half years older than I was, and she was actually\nborn in Bialystok, and she \u2014 she did learn Hungarian quite well, yes. But we were\nboth considered really Hungarians, even though nobody asked for our passports,\nwhich was a1 -\u2014a lucky thing.",
        "Q: So at home did you speak, Russian, Polish, Yiddish?",
        "A: Well, this 1 \u2014 this is very complicated, actually, th-the \u2014 the home language used\nto be Russian. When I was born, I \u2014 I was not taught Russian. So basically, it\nbecame a mix \u2014 mixture of German of Yiddish. My sister spoke \u2014 didn\u2019t speak very\ngood Yiddish, she talked mostly German, because she went to German schools. My\nfather spoke Yiddish, my mother spoke very, very bad Yiddish. She spoke a very\ncomplex mixture of Yiddish and German. It \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 it was a complicated affair. In\nMay 8, 2013\nother words, no \u2014 no two people had a common language, you know, three people\nhad a common language.",
        "Q: And you also \u2014 since you grew up in Budapest, you also spoke Hungarian?",
        "A: I spoke \u2014 I spoke at first only Hungarian.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And then I \u2014 I learned German.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And I went for a while to a German school, and then I \u2014 somebody heard a \u2014 a\nheart murmur in \u2014 in me, and so they put me to bed for six months. And after I \u2014 I\ngot out of bed, the German school wouldn\u2019t have me there. So I had to go toa\u2014a\nHungarian public school, which was perfectly adequate and nice.",
        "Q: How old were you when this happened, when you got taken out of school for a\nheart murmur? Do you remember\u2019?",
        "A: I was taken out of school at about age five.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Five, five and a half. And I was put back 1n school around age six. And we left\nwhen I was age seven.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: We \u2014 we \u2014 I have [indecipherable] my eighth birthday was in Mexico City.May 8, 2013",
        "Q: Oh. All right. We\u2019ll get there.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Can you tell me a little bit about the religious life of your family? Were they\nvery religious, not religious?",
        "A: Well, my father and mother came from very, very religious families, especially\nmy father. My \u2014 my grandfather had been a melamed, a teacher. And he \u2014 he was\nconsidered a rabbi. I\u2019m not sure whether he had the smichas, whether he had the \u2014\nhe could really be called a rabbi, but he was certainly \u2014 it \u2014 1t seems, because I\nnever met him, that he was considered to be an extremely knowledgeable person,\nand \u2014 and people used to come to him for advice. But my mother came from a reli \u2014\nreligious family, but \u2014 an-and we were relatively religious. My mother kept a\nkosher home to \u2014 to her dying day. And we \u2014 we used to go to holidays, to \u2014 to the\nsynagogue, and my father worked on Saturday, so that didn\u2019t make him a very\nreligious person. And when he was traveling, he \u2014 he ate whatever he could get, not\n\u2014 not basically very \u2014 he \u2014 he did not think of keeping dietary laws, and things like\nthat. I would say we were \u2014 we were traditional.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Not \u2014 not religious, but traditional.\nMay 8, 2013",
        "Q: Okay. And your father traveled a lot for work. He \u2014 what \u2014 and he worked for an\n[indecipherable] company. What, exactly, was his role in \u2014 do you know?",
        "A: Well, hi-his main \u2014 first of all, he \u2014 he was a specialist in \u2014 in \u2014 in producing a\nfabric which was made of [indecipherable] coat \u2014 coating fabric which \u2014 the word\nthat has come to \u2014 to us, is loden. And the reason it\u2019s called loden is that the fa \u2014\nthe main factory producing it, which was not from this complex, but from\nsomebody else, a man by name of Weingarten(ph), was in a section of Budapest\ncalled Loden. So they used to say yes, we want the fabric from Loden, and the\nname stuck. But he used to be a specialist, and one of the biggest problems that he\nhad was raw material. He had to find [indecipherable] and th-the \u2014 the \u2014 the two or\nthree plants where he was working consumed a huge amount of this, and specially\nthese are the years where armies in \u2014 in Europe had to be dressed, and this was the\nbasic coating material practically for everybody; for the German army, for the\nPolish army, for the \u2014 you name it. Practically the whole western European armies\nused to consume this heavy, loden fabric. But the problem was to find raw material,\nwhich is why he ended up in the United States, as a matter of fact.",
        "Q: Okay. We\u2019ll get there, too.",
        "A: Yeah.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 8, 2013",
        "Q: Before I want to \u2014 di\u2014 you were quite young when you left, but can you tell me\na little bit about what your life was like in Hungary? Do you remember when the\nJewish laws were passed in 1938, how that affected your family? Do you remember\nthose sorts of things?",
        "A: Well, Pll \u2014 Ill tell you very truthfully, in Hungary there was so much latent\nanti-Semitism that with laws and without laws, it \u2014 it \u2014 it didn\u2019t change the situation\nvery much. I was a little bit surprised at the question that I was asked, because\ncuriously enough \u2014 and I spoke to my sister about this, it would seem that th-there\nwas less talk of Hitler in Hungary, as there was more talk of Mussolini. So, some\nreason another, it was only in this corporate state was much more popular as a\u2014 as a\npiece of conversation, than Hitler. And anti-Semitism was latent. In \u2014 in \u2014 in the\nyears before we left, where we didn\u2019t know where the outcome was, there was, you\nknow, they were pe \u2014 recruiting Jewish young men, but some were sent to the army,\nsome were sent to work camps. The work camps turned out to be pretty much\nextermination camps. I mean, they \u2014 they worked you to \u2014 to \u2014 to the bone, I think.\nThere was a\u2014a movie called rou \u2014 Rosenschein(ph), or something like that, which\ndescribed one of these work camps in \u2014 in Hungary. But basically, no-nobody\nheard anything. At least w-we \u2014 we weren\u2019t aware of it. And going to a German\nschool, we were not very aware of it. I mean, we were aware of it in that for\nMay 8, 2013\nexample, the \u2014 the Nazi clubs in which the youth \u2014 youth clubs, wouldn\u2019t have us.\nAnd that \u2014 certainly my sister was absolutely livid, because you know, uniforms\nand parties, and \u2014 and excursions, and whatever it is. But even the school, there was\nno \u2014 no \u2014 no latent anti-Semitism. There were quite a few Jewish students in \u2014 in\nthe \u2014 in the German school.",
        "Q: And when you went to a Hungarian school, was it any different, or \u2014",
        "A: No, no \u2014",
        "Q: The same?",
        "A: \u2014 because we were all \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: \u2014I mean, since I \u2014 the \u2014 the language, my \u2014 should be saying my mother tongue\nwas Hungarian.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: I certainly was not \u2014 not looked upon very differently as any \u2014 as anywhere else.",
        "Q: I feel like you kind of touched on this, but did your family live in a Jewish\nneighborhood, interact mostly with Jewish people, or mixed Hungarian \u2014",
        "A: Well, basically, there was such a huge Jewish population in Budapest, that you\ncan hardly pinpoint a \u2014 a Jewish neighborhood. I mean \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.\nMay 8, 2013",
        "A: \u2014 all \u2014 all neighborhoods had Jews. We were living basically, in the area which \u2014\nright \u2014 right on the Danube where \u2014 where actually, where the Swedish embassy\nbought most of those buildings, later on, I mean, we \u2014 were not there anymore. But\nthat \u2014 that is where \u2014 where the Swedish embassy bought all those buildings. It was\nright on the \u2014 on the shore of the Danube, right in front of Saint Margaret\u2019s island,\nMargitteet(ph). And it was really \u2014 it was a wealthy community, it was \u2014 you had\nto have a certain \u2014 certain economic status to be able to live there.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And \u2014 but then there were Jewish synagogues, Jewish [indecipherable]. There\nwere \u2014 there \u2014 there wi \u2014 there was even a synagogue three or four blocks down, on\nthe street. But you couldn\u2019t pinpoint it as really \u2014 as a Jewish section. There were a\nlot of Jews in there, but not \u2014 not necessarily Jewish.",
        "Q: Okay. So let\u2019s move forward a little bit, and talk about your father\u2019s travels, and\nhow it brought him to New York, and \u2014 and the dates when that happened.",
        "A: Well, my father, around 19 \u2014 well, he \u2014 he \u2014 he had constantly \u2014 was constantly\non the move, trying to locate raw materials, he \u2014 he went to places, you know,\nwhich we thought were absolutely the end of the world, like Greece or Turkey or\nnorth Africa. But there were \u2014 there was considerable wool merch \u2014 wool \u2014 wool\nproducts, used wool products there. He had the brother, for example that he set upMay 8, 2013\nin business in Paris, collecting for him. But no ma \u2014 he had \u2014 they had a\nrelationship with the English company called John Crowther and Sons, in\nMilnsbridge, which supplied a lot of raw material too, but th-they were always\nstarved for raw material. So my father decided that the only sizable place that he\ncould think of that would have raw material was the United States. And basically,\nhe also had there two brothers and a sister, which he hadn\u2019t seen in some 30 years.\nSo he, you know, he figured all of these things together, my mother wouldn\u2019t go,\nbecause we had to go to school, and so forth, and so on. Those trips were long. And\nhe \u2014 he planned to be away for a long, long, long period of time, because he had to\nset up this business. So he actually came to New York, and he \u2014 he set up a\nbusiness in Passaic, New Jersey, and he spent here well over six months, I think\nabout nine months, or something like that. And then he decided to go back to \u2014 to\nEurope, and he got as far as Belgium, and took the train to \u2014 to Berlin, but he was\nturned back, because the Germans had invaded Belgium. So, he basically got onto\nthe same boat that he took to New York, and came back to New York. He made a\nsecond attempt to return to southern Europe, but he only got as far as France, and\nhe had to turn back. And then, of course, the United States was very, very \u2014 should\nwe Say, not receptive to \u2014 to \u2014 to refugees from an \u2014 anybody from Europe, as they\nhad this quota system, which I understand 90 percent of the quota were never filled.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 8, 2013\nBut anyways, he \u2014 he applied to stay in the United States, and he was hoping to\nbring us all there, at least to sit out the \u2014 the \u2014 the war, because he knew that if he\ncouldn\u2019t get back two ways, I mean there was no reason for us to \u2014 to stay there. So\nhe applied here f\u2014 as a matter of fact, there\u2019s a man by the name of Yrin, who does\ngenealogy in this country, y-r-i-n. And one day, from the blue, he contact me,\nbecause this \u2014 a second name in my last name is Efron, and he was making a\nhistory of the Efrons. And he asked me about it, and \u2014 and he seems to have found,\nin the Springfield repository of the national archives, actually first papers from my\nmother, myself and \u2014 and my sister. But first papers, we never got the visa.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So the problem was that he was about to \u2014 to be deported. And somebody told\nhim that in Mexico, if he showed a certain amount of money, you could get an\ninvestors visa. So, since he had a \u2014 he came with a considerable amount of money\nto set up this business, there was no problem with that. He \u2014 he \u2014 he sira \u2014 he \u2014 he\npresented his papers, he \u2014 he \u2014 he put in \u2014 he \u2014 he showed them the deposit in the\nbank and so forth, and so on. And I understand there was a \u2014 a\u2014 a problem with \u2014\nwith telegrams and God knows what, but basically he got the \u2014 the visa about two\ndays before he was going to be deported from the United States. So he traveled by\ntrain to the border, to Laredo. And this was June.\nMay 8, 2013",
        "Q: June of?",
        "A: For \u2014 1940.",
        "Q: 1940, okay.",
        "A: And Laredo in June is the \u2014 I think hell 1s cooler than \u2014 than Laredo. It\u2019s abou \u2014\nabout 105 \u2014 110 in the shade, and no shade. And this was before air conditioning.\nThe only relief was a movie theater, because the \u2014 they had these huge ice blocks,\nwhich somebody was \u2014 they had ventilators blowing on them there; called ice\ncooled, or whatever it was. So somebody told him that Mexico City was somewhat\nmore pleasant, 1t a \u2014 the weather was \u2014 was more pleasant. So he took the train to\nMexico City, he had a Mexican visa. So he took the train to Mexico City and \u2014 and\ntrue in \u2014 the temperature was like \u2014 like the Balkans and \u2014 and th \u2014 in the middle of\nsummer, Mexico City runs around 22 to 26 degrees centigrade. Around 80, at \u2014 at\nbest. So he found very pleasant. And by \u2014 by accident, he met some people that he\nknew from \u2014 from Europe. He was sitting in the park, and suddenly he saw people\nthat he remembered in Paris. You know, the \u2014 the \u2014 you had to \u2014 you had to know\nsomebody to get money out of Europe at that time. Everybody had a \u2014 a currency\ncontrol system. So he had \u2014 he knew these two people, one from Geneva, one from\nParis, who had been doing this for Jews, all over central Europe. They were\nmoving money in and out of central Europe, and moving it to the United States, toMay 8, 2013\nthe Chase Manhattan bank, through Chase Manhattan in \u2014 in Paris. So he saw\nthese two people in the park, and says, what are you doing here? They says, the\nsame thing that you are. We are waiting for an American immigration visa. So my\nfather said, you know what, we don\u2019t know how long we\u2019re going to have to wait,\nwhether it\u2019s a week, a month, or \u2014 or \u2014 or years. And we\u2019re eating up our capital,\nyou know, maybe we should start doing something. So they \u2014 they got together, and\nthey started a business, which lasted 50 \u2014 54 years, 55 years, and by the time when\nmy father got his American immigration visa, he wasn\u2019t interested. He had already\nmade a \u2014 quite a commitment to \u2014 to Mexico. So we \u2014 we \u2014 we remained in\nMexico.",
        "Q: While your father was in \u2014 well, when your father left, what was your family in\nHungary doing? I assume \u2014 did he leave \u2014 do you know if he left for New York\nbefore or after Germany invaded Poland, in 1939?",

        "A: Well, my father, since he was still working through the company, we \u2014 we were\ndrawing his salary, and my father was probably drawing one of his biggest salaries\nin Hungary, if not the biggest salary. So we were living quite \u2014 quite \u2014 quite\ncomfortably, we \u2014 we had our apartment on Santish(ph) Venut(ph), which is a po \u2014\na \u2014a very \u2014 was a very stylish, very, very well-to-do neighborhood, and we kept\nliving normally, the way we had tha \u2014 lived before.",
        "Q: Where \u2014 do you know if your parents started to become concerned when\nGermany invaded Poland? Were there ideas on getting out then, or \u2014",
        "A: Well, w-we were concerned, we were very concerned, because two things\nhappened. The first thing was I had a cousin who was the daughter of my aunt in\nPoland. And she had \u2014 sh-she had not been able to get into an \u2014 a Polish university,\nbecause of the numerous clauses, because of the Jewish exclusion rule. So she had\ntaken on \u2014 she had gone to the Charles University in Prague, and she was studying\nmedicine there, and we kept very close contact with her. She \u2014 she used to come\nseveral times a month to Budapest to see m \u2014 to see \u2014 see our family. And\nbasically, my father was supporting her. And she basically told us that, you know,\nthey \u2014 she had been able to speak to her parents up to probably November of \u2014 of\n1939. And the way she mi \u2014 she was able to speak to them is that basically she\nfound a \u2014 a farmer \u2014 they found a farmer whose telephone was still working forMay 8, 2013\nlong distance calls. And every weekend they used to be in touch with her. And then\nsuddenly, at the end of November, they \u2014 no more was heard from them. She tried \u2014\nmy cousin tried to go back into Poland, she was sent back from the border, she was\nnot allowed in. And so, you know, we \u2014 we were extremely worried, because we \u2014\nwe heard nothing. That was the last thing we ever heard of my aunt and uncle. But\nmy \u2014 my cousin was in constant touch with us. And as a matter of fact, even\nthrough the war, she was in touch with us. She \u2014 she was \u2014 again, she was being\nfinanced both economically, and false papers, by the management of the company\nwith \u2014 which my father had a partnership in Zylina. So she basically \u2014 I\u2014 I don\u2019t\nknow how this man did it, but he \u2014 he \u2014 through the red cro \u2014 we were getting Red\nCross letters almost every two or \u2014 two or three months. Heavily censored, but at\nleast we got news, and said that, you know, she was all right, and this and that, and\nthe other thing, but w-we kept pretty \u2014 pretty \u2014 pretty much in touch with her til \u2014 til\nearly 1944.",
        "Q: Okay. And I definitely want to hear more about your father\u2019s involvement in\nfinan \u2014 in, I guess supplying false papers to people in places. Is that \u2014",
        "A: Well, it \u2014 it is \u2014 the \u2014 the company, which was \u2014 my father originally got into the\ncompany by managing the \u2014 the \u2014 this huge plant that they had Zylina, in Slovakia.\nAnd the plant was managed by man called Mousekopf(ph). This man Mousekopf\nMay 8, 2013\nwas Jewish, and he \u2014 he managed to \u2014 to \u2014 since he \u2014 it was important for the\nGerman war effort \u2014 I mean, he was producing coating and fabrics for \u2014 for the\nGerman army. He was what they call a protected Jew. So basically he \u2014 he was able\nto move around and \u2014 and he was able to \u2014 to employ a lo \u2014 there was a very big ge\n\u2014 pop \u2014 Jewish population in Zylina. Zylina is very close to the Polish border, it\u2019s a\nPolish German border. So, he was able to \u2014 to \u2014 to supply jobs to a lot of the Jews in\nthe \u2014 in the city, and many of these people were not supposed to be there. In other\nwords, they \u2014 they had been refugees from Poland. So they \u2014 Mr. Mousekopf(ph)\nmanaged to get residence papers for them. And they didn\u2019t get residence papers, he\ndid exactly what he did for my cousin, which 1s picked up papers of people that had\ndied, or something like that. Which was very dangerous and not \u2014 not \u2014 it \u2014 it \u2014 you\nknow, it\u2019s something that may have worked for a month or two, and then they had\nto fire them, a-and give them a new set of papers, and rehire them, because the\nGermans \u2014 not the Germans, but the \u2014 the USB, the Slovakian secret service\nsuddenly got the list of people which had died, and this man \u2014 these peop \u2014 1-1t was\na\u2014a very complicated undertaking, but he \u2014 he managed to \u2014 to save, I would say\nseveral hundred, if not \u2014 not \u2014 not a thousand, or more people in the Zylina area for\n\u2014 from the Germans, until 1944, when the Germans came in, got rid of the\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 8, 2013\nSlovakian puppet government, and that was the \u2014 then there they took Jews, no\nmatter whether protected or unprotected, or whatever they were.",
        "Q: And is that the last you heard from your cousin?",
        "A: And the \u2014",
        "Q: The last you heard from your cousin in \u2014 at that time?",
        "A: Well, my cousin \u2014 my cousin is a\u2014 was a strange person. She was a strange\nperson to the day that she died. She was a rebel, of the worst sort. I mean, as a child\nshe had joined Hashomer Hatzair in Bialystok, which was not considered very \u2014\nvery Jewish, among the better \u2014 better members of the community, because they\nwere the poorest of the poor, and the \u2014 the \u2014 they were definitely communistic. So,\nshe had joined the Hashomer Hatzair, and of course, she in see \u2014 she was the only\none that was living in the \u2014 1-in a decent housing area, all the meetings were held in\nher apartment, and my uncle used to absolutely blow his top. But it passed. And she\nwas like that, too. She went to \u2014 to Czechoslovakia, and when the Germans\ninvaded, she \u2014 she \u2014 she was part of the Czech underground. She basically spoke\nvery good German, and she looked German. She \u2014 she was blonde, blue eyed. Blue\neyed to the point of gray eye. So she made friends in the German occupation forces,\nand she got herself a job as the doctor. She \u2014 she was still a medical student, but she\nwas in her process of getting her internship, whatever it is. So she was able to get\nMay 8, 2013\nherself a job at the Gestapo jail in \u2014 in \u2014 in \u2014 in Prague, and she became the conduit\nbetween the people which were being held at the jail, and the underground and their\nfamilies. And she did this til 1941, the Germans invaded Czechoslovakia in 1938.\nThe university was closed, I think in November of 1938, because of strikes, student\nstrikes. But she \u2014 she remained there, and she became an important cog 1n the\ncommunications system of the underground, with these people, until \u2014 until the end\nof 1941, when she suspected that she was compromised. In fact, we\u2019ve gone to the\nHolocaust Museum facilities, German files, and it\u2019s a fact. I mean, the Germans had\nher take \u2014 they had picked her up several times and let her go. But there was a\u2014a\nrecord that she had been caught at \u2014 as a Jewess not wearing a Jewish yellow Star of\nDavid. There were several reasons that she had been picked up, because she had\nmanaged to \u2014 she \u2014 she was extremely adroit at getting herself out of trouble. As a\nmatter of fact, she got, at one point, papers, which Mr. Mousekopf(ph) didn\u2019t know\nit, but they were of a communist girl. And guess what? The Germans had her on the\nlist of \u2014 of people that they \u2014 they had to \u2014 so she came \u2014 she was taken to Gestapo\nheadquarters, she was taken to the Gestapo head. And she walks into her office \u2014\ninto his office, and she sees a picture behind his desk of Bialystok. So he \u2014 she\ndidn\u2019t let him say hello, it\u2019s just \u2014 she says, you know, ho-how did you ever have\nthis picture of Bialystok? So he says, well, you know, I was stationed there, I wasMay 8, 2013\nthe head of the Gestapo in Bialystok. So how \u2014 how were you related to Bialystok?\nShe says, well, I\u2014 I belong to the German population of Bialystok, which \u2014 which\nwere factory owners, and my father was a factory owner. And this is how I know\nBialystok very well. My \u2014 my \u2014 my parents were still there for a while, I don\u2019t\nknow where they are now, because the general \u2014 Generalgouvernement is not very\ninformative as to where people are. So, you know, he made \u2014 she made a friendship,\nand when she walked in, she was about to be sent to wherever \u2014 God knows\n[indecipherable] was sent. She managed to walk out four hours later. And she\nmanaged also to \u2014 this false paper that she had, she managed to give it a certain aura\nof credibility. In other words, you know, he asked her, well, how come you are a\ncommunist? She says, you know, these were things of when you are a young ma \u2014\nperson, you \u2014 you think of other people, and this and that, and not of yourself. But\nthis is something which is \u2014 which is gone past. So she managed to \u2014 to survive this\nway, on this set of papers, for close to three \u2014 three \u2014 well, more than that, she \u2014 she\n\u2014 she crossed the \u2014 the \u2014 she\u2019s crossed into Slovakia from \u2014 from the Czech\nRepublic, from the other half, the night of Christmas of 1942. They figured that,\nand figured correctly that the German guards would be all drunk, having a\nChristmas party, and there was a huge snowstorm that night, but they managed to\ncross into Slovakia. Into Slovakia, they already had Mr. Mousekopf(ph) to help\nMay 8, 2013\nher, and she lived in Nitra from late 1941 to early 1944, til practically August,\nSeptember of 1944. She \u2014 she had joined also, the Slovakian underground. There\nwas a Slovakian uprising, I think in August \u2014 July or August of 1944, which was the\nreason that the Germans came in. They felt that the Slovakians couldn\u2019t handle this,\nso they came in, and they cleaned out the place, to their liking. My cousin, curiously\nenough, could have survived, but again, she \u2014 principle was \u2014 used to get her, and\nthis time it got her, too. Was basically she \u2014 she \u2014 she tells that she was picked up\nby the Germans, taken to the Gestapo headquarters, and sat down with a group of\nJews. And this man that she knew in the Gestapo walked in, and says, what are you\ndoing sitting there? You\u2019re not Jewish. Go home. So she got up and went home, and\nshe describes it as having had a terrible night. I mean, considering that the rest of\nthe Jewish population was being done to something, and deported, or whatever it is.\nSo she basically walked in the next morning, into Gestapo headquarters and said,\nyou know, you\u2019re looking for Jews, I\u2019m Jewish. The man was floored. He never in\nhis wildest dream imagined her to be Jewish. She was about as far physically from\nbeing a Jew as \u2014 as \u2014 as you can imagine. Of course, didn\u2019t \u2014 this didn\u2019t help her.\nBut she helped other people. She took Mr. Mousekopf\u2019s(ph) wife and daughter.\nShe \u2014 she \u2014 she was able to \u2014 she went to Birkenau, and in the same transport, Mr.\nMousekopf\u2019s(ph) wife and daughter were \u2014 were in that same transport. Mr.May 8, 2013\nMousekopf(ph) had been actually \u2014 was able to hide with some \u2014 some Catholic\npriest. And she \u2014 she told the people at Birkenau that she was a surgeon, she was a\n\u2014a doctor. So there was a shortage of doctors, not only for \u2014 for the inmates, but for\nactually the general population outside of the camps. So she was transported to\nGross-Rosen, which was a satellite camp. And she said that she needed assistants.\nShe was put in charge of a group of 200 agriculture workers, that were working in\nthe fields around Gross-Rosen. So she said that, you know, she needed assistants.\nSo she got the wife and daughter of \u2014 of this man Mousekopf(ph) to be her\nassistants, and all \u2014 all three survived the war. And she \u2014 she not only \u2014 she was\nactually taken by the camp commandant to his town in northern Germany, to see\nhis mother, who was sick. And she says she could have stayed there. I mean, they\nliked her, they \u2014 they fed her, they \u2014 they clothed her, they \u2014 and \u2014 and they were\nvery interested for her to stay around, because the mother seemed to be better with\nher being around. But she felt a responsibility, curiously enough, for those 200\npeople in Gross-Rosen, so she went back to the camps, and she stayed there til\nliberation, til \u2014 til May \u2014 May of 1945. Of course, we \u2014 we \u2014 we found out about her\nalmost immediately. As liberation occurred, she was able to communicate with us,\nand we asked what happened to Mother and Father, and she says, we don\u2019t know. I\nlost total communications with her. I spoke to Vera(ph) the last time, which was\nMay 8, 2013\nend of 19 \u2014 1939, early 1940. And she \u2014 you know, she told us the whole story, but\nwe were \u2014 and my father actually came back, and believe it or not, paid \u2014 returned\nthe money to the company that had been given out for my cousin, not for the other \u2014\nwell, the others worked at the company. But he felt that, you know, property pro \u2014\npropriety was important.",
        "Q: Well, what was your cousin\u2019s name?",
        "A: How?",
        "Q: Your cousin\u2019s name?",
        "A: Her name is Shula(ph) Lozowska. Her married name was Graf(ph).",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: As \u2014 as a matter of fact, it\u2019s very funny, but we were in Prague about two years\nago, and one of the synagogues has all 50,000 deportees name on it. So my wife\nsays, you know, do we know anybody here? So curiously enough, you know,\n50,000 names, coincidence is un \u2014 unbelievable. Right in front of my face was\nShula(ph) Lozowska.",
        "Q: Wow, my gosh.",
        "A: 1913, it didn\u2019t have a second date for her, because they knew that she was\ndeported to Birkenau. Very, very few people came back from the \u2014 Birkenau.",
        "Q: Wow. How do you spell her name?May 8, 2013",
        "A: Lozowska is spelled I-o-z-o-w-s-k-a. I will \u2014 I will send you \u2014 I\u2014 I\u2019m collecting\na lot of copies of papers that I have \u2014 I \u2014 I have her \u2014 her German I.D. documents, I\nhave \u2014 I still have some \u2014 some things left over, and PII let you have it.",
        "Q: Yeah, we can put you in contact with the \u2014 the people who take care of that,\ndefinitely.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: That would be excellent.",
        "A: Cause, you know, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s worth it.",
        "Q: Yeah, no, that\u2019s a very incredible story.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And this was all going on, your mother and you and your sister are still in\nBudapest until 1940, right?",
        "A: No, we \u2014 we \u2014 we\u2019re \u2014 we\u2019re there til early ni \u2014 19 \u2014",
        "Q: Forty-one?",
        "A: \u2014 well, th-that was also a confusing issue. First, my father kept writing sa \u2014\nhorrible letters about Mexico, you know, poverty, dirt, this and that. My father \u2014 my\nmother said, you know, what are you trying to do to me? I mean, I\u2019m perfectly\nhappy here. Budapest is a nice, clean city, with no problems of any \u2014 any sort. So,\nbasically, I actually think that somebody \u2014 a \u2014 a general, or maybe even a field\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 8, 2013\nmarshal \u2014 I mean, the German army, who was the buyer for the cloth for the\nGerman army, came to talk to my mother, and he told her, look, this is no \u2014 no time\nfor a Jew to be in \u2014 in \u2014 in Europe, and you know the \u2014 this will take a year, two\nyears, and everything will be settled again, everything will come into its normal\ncourse, and you\u2019ll come back. But at this point, this is no point \u2014 no time to \u2014 for a\nJew to be in \u2014 in \u2014 1n Europe. Convinced her. The next problem was how to \u2014 how\nto travel. My father had arranged for her to \u2014 to take Verlichs(ph) out of Trieste \u2014\nth-the ship out of Trieste to New York, there were two problems. First of all, she c-\ncouldn\u2019t \u2014 she \u2014 she \u2014 it was very difficult to get a transit visa to the United States,\nwhich I think she finally got. But before she could leave, Mussolini got into the\nwar, so that cut it off. Next thing is how to go when there \u2014 there were a lot of\nJewish refugees who went to Russia. In other words, they \u2014 they took the Trans-\nSiberian to Vladivostok, from Vladivostok to \u2014 to San Francisco, or if not, from\nVladivostok to Osaka, or Shanghai, and from there to \u2014 to San Francisco. So she\nfigured that that made sense. I mean, Hungary has a border with \u2014 with Russia, and\nshe hadn\u2019t seen her mother for, I don\u2019t know, 30 years, or 25 years, 30 years, so she\nwould do both things. So she started to get a\u2014 a \u2014 a Russian visa. She actually went\nto the Russian consul, and she applied, and she left, and \u2014 and obviously the consul\nwas Jewish. And he came running after her, and he told her, look, I can give you a\nMay 8, 2013\nvisa, I can guarantee that you can get into the country. I cannot guarantee that you\nwill be allowed to leave. So my mother, you know, advice to the wise \u2014 wise, you\nonly give once. So she tried then, going out through \u2014 through Spain, through \u2014\nwell, there were several problems in there. First of all, the Mexicans did not wish to\ngive her the visa on anything but the Polish passport. And the Cubans wouldn\u2019t give\nher a transit visa either on \u2014 except on the Polish passport. She still had the valid\nPolish passport. I mean, Poland didn\u2019t exist, but she still had a valish por \u2014 Polish\npa \u2014 of course, here the problem came to the rest of Europe. I mean, place like\nSwitzerland, a place like Austria, a place like unoccupied France. To them\nPoland doesn\u2019t \u2014 did not exist anymore.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So, you couldn\u2019t \u2014 you know, you can\u2019t travel through us with that Polish\npassport. So my father\u2019s company, since they had such good relationship with the \u2014\nwith the Hungarian government, managed to get, for my mother, a\n[indecipherable] passport, a League of Nations passport. So, well she \u2014 she got\nherself into, you know, this is a complication. First you couldn\u2019t \u2014 at that time you\ncouldn\u2019t travel with two passports. So one had to be very well hidden. So basically,\nshe was \u2014 1-1t took her a good six months, or seven months, to get all the transit\nvisas there. The German transit visa through all \u2014 through then Germany, German\nMay 8, 2013\nAustria, and you had to go through southern Germany, through Miinsing to\nMunich, to the Swiss border. And then you went across Switzerland to Geneva,\nand then you took a \u2014 a train across Vichy, France to [indecipherable] in Spain.\nThe \u2014 the most difficult visa of them all was the \u2014 was the French, the\n[indecipherable] government visa. She managed to \u2014 to get it. She \u2014 she was a very\nstrong woman, and she wouldn\u2019t take no for an answer, so she managed to get\neverything together by about February of 1941. And we left for \u2014 for Spain, and\ntraveled through Germany. We managed to \u2014 to be in men \u2014 min \u2014 Miinsing, in\nMunich the night of the \u2014 of the speech of Hitler in the \u2014 in the beer \u2014 beer\nstuben(ph), in the beer \u2014 beer hall. And the British were bombing, and you know,\nbeing in the railroad station during a bombing 1s the wrong place to be. Anyways,\nnoth \u2014 they did not bomb there. They were trying to get Hitler, so they bombed all\nof Munich, except for the railroad station. We got out of there, we got into\nSwitzerland, we had to stay in Switzerland almost two weeks, I think. And then\nwe went to Spain, and Spain was another problem, because Spain \u2014 this was the\nend of the civil war, and th-there was no food in Spain. So we were given the\nprivilege to live in \u2014 in the hotel, which the Spanish government had for foreign\ndignitaries, which was not far from the Prado. So we stayed there til \u2014 til the boat\nthat we were supposed to take, arrived in Vigo. We went to Vigo, we had a \u2014 a bad\nMay 8, 2013\nexperience there, too. My mother was a type which when she traveled, took\neverything with her. And imagine traveling to war torn Europe with 22 pieces of\nluggage, including two steamer trunks. She managed it. I mean no ha \u2014 anyways, in\nSpain, she made a \u2014 a terrible mistake. She met a Hungarian, and she said, you\nknow, I worry about this and that and the other thing, because I took everything. I\ntook my silver, I took my jewels, I took this, I took that, and everything is packed\naway in these 22 bags. So sure enough, it was a terrible mistake, because the guy\nwent and spoke to the \u2014 to the Spanish customs. And we were already on the boat,\nand suddenly Spanish customs come up on the boat, and hold the boat, and they\nwant to see my mother\u2019s bags. So they started opening bags, and my sister, in all\ninnocence, she had a bar of chocolate, that we brought from Switzerland, and she\noffered it to the \u2014 to the inspector, to the Spanish customs inspector, you know, as a\ncourtesy. Here, would you like to have this? Obviously the man hadn\u2019t seen a bar of\nchocolate in God knows when. He said, close up everything, we have nothing to do,\nwe\u2019re just holding up the boat. Get out. So, you see, we were \u2014 we were saved by a\nbar of chocolate. But my mother was, in that sense, you know, very strange. She \u2014\nshe used to \u2014 people used to tell her, don\u2019t do this. She said, Pll do it, and PI- Vl\ncarry it through, and she \u2014 she was able to carry through almost anything that she\nundertook. She \u2014 very \u2014 very strong personality.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 8, 2013",

        "Q: An immigration visa?",
        "A: Yes. A-Actually, that was very lucky, because the Mexican insis \u2014 wanted to\nhave a Polish passport, but they didn\u2019t trust passports in general.

So what\nwe did is we took the boat from Vigo, and the boat made a two day stop in Lisbon.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 8, 2013\nAnd in those two days that we stopped in Lisbon, my mother was able to pick up\nthe Mexican visa, and she \u2014 we\u2019re also able to pick up matzos, because this was \u2014\nthis was Passover time. My mother had gotten from the Jewish community there,\nkosher [indecipherable] of food. I have no idea how she carried it though all of\nEurope, especially through Switzerland, because Switzerland forbade you \u2014 one\nof their \u2014 the only th-thing which was forbidden was to take food out of\nSwitzerland. There was plenty of food in Switzerland, but you couldn\u2019t \u2014 you\ncouldn\u2019t export any of it.

        "Q: Do you know if you went to Mexico \u2014 if the Mexican government knew that you\nwere Jewish when you were getting your visas, or if you were just traveling at \u2014",
        "A: The Mexican \u2014 the Mexican government at the time was fairly liberal, and it was\nfairly liberal \u2014 this was the time of Lazaro Cardenas. Lazaro Cardenas was\nprobably the only world leader which was supporting the republic in Spain. And he\nhad given instructions to all of his consulates, to give a-anybody that walked in, you\ngive him a visa. So, first of all, my father had the la \u2014 legal base to request a visa,\nbut otherwise, you would have gotten a visa as well. They \u2014 they were extraordinary\nliberal. Unfortunately, very few people knew about this, so very few people availed\nthemself of this situation.\nMay 8, 2013",

        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: They \u2014 they \u2014 there were refugees. We \u2014 we traveled with a very religious man\nfrom [indecipherable] through all of Europe. And there were sort of hair-raising\nexperiences, I mean, we were crossing Austria, and this was right before the\ninvasion of Yugoslavia, and there were a huge amount of German troops moving\nthrough Austria. The train was full of German \u2014 of Germans. And he, though, had\nto pray, I mean \u2014",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: It\u2019s more, I mean [indecipherable] and my mother was, you know, not very\nhappy. I mean, not that she knew that \u2014 what was going on, but she \u2014 she knew\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 8, 2013\nGermans, and Germans were anti-Semites to start with, and here you have a very\nreligious Jew. Luckily there, I \u2014 I saved them, because the German officers were\noccupied with me, because basically, I spoke very good German, and \u2014 and they\nwere fascinated with me. My sister helped me along, but basically it was I who \u2014\nwho they were talking to. A-Again, you know, the \u2014 an unusual situation wa \u2014 since\nthe \u2014 since there \u2014 there was five of us, three a \u2014 three in our family, and this man\nfrom [indecipherable] had somebody else with him. Not a wife, but somebody \u2014\nand not even a woman, but another man with him, which wasn\u2019t as religious as he\nwas. But we were five in \u2014 in \u2014 1n that compartment, so basically the compartment\nwas for six, but we managed to keep the compartment for us five. So, basically,\ncuriously enough, also the \u2014 the transit visa for Germany was given to us the same\nday. The transit visa from Switzerland wasn\u2019t. The transit visa from southern\nSpain wasn\u2019t. The transit visa to Spain took some time to \u2014 no-no-not as much as\nthe French one, but it took \u2014 and of course, you know, there were things which I\nnoticed. For example, when we were traveling to southern Spain \u2014 southern\nFrance, they came \u2014 people came with paint in Geneva, and they painted over the\nwindows, which we are not supposed to look outside the \u2014 the \u2014 the windows. We \u2014\nwe \u2014 we \u2014 it \u2014 it was a long trip. Today \u2014 today it\u2019s also an overnight trip. We \u2014 we\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 8, 2013\nmade it, I think, in a day and a night, or something like that.

        "A: I really don\u2019t know, I \u2014 I tell you very truthfully, I \u2014 I guess there must have\nbeen people to help you with bags, or something like that, because at that time,\nevery time you got to a border, you know, the inspection wasn\u2019t on the train. You\nhad to get off the train, take off your bags, take \u2014 take it to the customs house, get\nyour document stamped at the customs house, have your baggage inspected, and get\nonto the train again. I don\u2019t know how she managed, but she did manage. I \u2014 I do\nremember some passengers being very unhappy of the train being held up because\nof my mother, but somehow she managed to do it, she \u2014 she \u2014 she \u2014 she got us\nthrough all of these country \u2014 all of these borders, into Spain. And she had a lot of\nvaluables, because one of the things that we were not allowed to \u2014 to take out of\nHungary was money. So we got valuables, so my mother had gold this, and gold\nthat. My sister had gold. And my mother made a mistake, she \u2014 she put the gold\nwatch on me. And the Germans looked at my mother, and let her pass. Looked at\nmy sister, 14 year old with gold necklace, and some gold armbands, and God\nknows, and they had a few thoughts about that one. But when they saw a gold watch\non me, then when they decided that they weren\u2019t going through, and a lot of this\nwas confiscated at the German border. Not confiscated, because Germans are \u2014\nwere [indecipherable] very honest, so they \u2014 we gave them an address in Budapest\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 8, 2013\nto send to somebody that we knew. There was a battle for this after the war, too,\nbecause after the war, he still had all of this, but he wouldn\u2019t give it back. So \u2014",

        "Q: Okay. Okay. Okay. So, can you tell me a little bit about the boat ride? How long\ndid it take to get to Mexico?",
        "A: Well, we left Vigo, between a two day stop in Vigo, it too-took the better part of\nthree weeks. It took 17 days, I think to \u2014 to get to Havana. In Havana we \u2014 in\nHavana we \u2014 we were taken off the boat and \u2014 and also there was all kinds of\npapers, and this and that and the other. And they sent you to an island in the Bay of\nHavana, called Trisko(ph) Onus(ph). It took me a year \u2014 several years, 20, to find\nout that the place was called Trisko(ph) Onus(ph). My mother kept refori \u2014\nreferring to it as Triskonia(ph). We \u2014 we spent, I think two nights on \u2014 on this\nisland, til they processed our papers. And then we were sent to Havana, where we\nstayed for about probably 10 days, because you know, th-the \u2014 the boats were not\nall at the same time, so you had to wait for the arrival of the boat. And this was a lib\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 8, 2013\n\u2014 and the \u2014 and the boat which we had come to Havana with [indecipherable] is\nthe Comillas, The Compania Transatlantica Espanola. It\u2019s a boat which survived\nthe war, and was still in service after the war, and the trip from \u2014 from Havana to\nVera Cruz was on a boat \u2014 boat called the Monterey(ph), which was quite\nluxurious. Even I could tell that 1t was not \u2014 not th \u2014 the regular \u2014 regular boat, there\nwere \u2014 there \u2014 we had the very \u2014 very ample cabin, very nicely furnished one.\nEverything was screwed down, but very nice cabin. And when we got to Mexico,\nthere was again the problem of processing all of this, and \u2014 and processing the\nfurniture, pro-processing the 22 bags, and the papers, and Mexican customs were\nnot exactly the fastest in the world. So, actually, we arrived on the 21% of April, and\nI think by the fifth of May, we were still in \u2014 in Vera Cruz. And I wasn\u2019t very sure\nabout Mexico. But then, the fifth of ma \u2014 May was my birthday, so I suddenly see\nfireworks, and parties, and whatever it is, so you know, I figured it wasn\u2019t such a\nbad country, if they celebrated my birthday. It was very kind of them to do so. But\nno, we were \u2014 in \u2014 in Mexico we were definitely known as Jews, we were \u2014 in \u2014 as\na matter of fact, one of the problems was that the Mexican immigration square, that\npiece of paper with a picture, said very clearly that we were Jewish. It had a\nreligion. Except, you know, we got it in \u2014 in Lisbon, so there was no \u2014 I re \u2014 I really\nwonder, I'll t\u2014 Ill take a look.

In fact, even after \u2014 after she wi \u2014 she \u2014 she got \u2014 she and her husband\ngot into trouble with the communists, despite the fact that, you know, they had \u2014\ncalled heroes of the \u2014 whatever it is. My cousin\u2019s husband was \u2014 became the head\nof the biggest pediatric hospital in \u2014 in Prague. And there were other people who\nwanted the job, so he \u2014 he \u2014 he got himself into trouble with the communist\nauthorities. My cousin as \u2014 as rebel as she has been always, she went to get her\nlicen \u2014 re \u2014 to be relicensed as a doctor, so they told her, well, to be relicensed, you\nMay 8, 2013\nhave to take a course in \u2014 in Marxism, Leninism. My cousin said Marxism,\nLeninism, what part of medicine do they \u2014 do they specialize in? Of course, this\ndidn\u2019t go over very well, and they were also \u2014 they had to leave in a hurry,\nCzechoslovakia \u2014 except they had a lot of friends there. You know, they were in\nthe underground, so people in the underground told her, you \u2014 that the \u2014 that the\nsecret service was \u2014 was being \u2014 looking for them, so they \u2014 they left with a small\nbag in the middle of the night.

And \u2014 and you know, when these people in the\nunderground became minister of defense, minister of this, minister of that, they \u2014\nthey actually sent a letter, says why don\u2019t you come back, at \u2014 at least to visit us.\nAnd they came for a couple of months, and \u2014 but they were already well established\nin Israel, and \u2014",
        "Q: Oh wow.",
        "A: \u2014 they \u2014 they wouldn\u2019t go \u2014 they wouldn\u2019t stay. They \u2014 they had a great time,\nthey had good parties, whatever it is, and then they said goodbye.",
        "Q: You said \u2014 you mentioned that your family had trouble because your \u2014 your\nvisas, your Mexican visa said that you were Jewish. What sorts of problems did you\nhave?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 8, 2013",
        "A: Well, Ill tell you very truthfully, Mexico was a strange place at that time of \u2014\neven though they \u2014 the government itself was very friendly, and didn\u2019t care whether\nyou were Jewish, or not Jewish, or whatever you were. The question is, were you a\nrefugee, or weren\u2019t you a refugee? And even though we had come in not as a\nrefugee, the Mexican government was, very, very friendly, and very open. There\nwas a movement in Mexico at that time called the \u2014 the Mexican traditionalist\nmovement. And this was heavily anti-Semitic. Basically their \u2014 the people who had\nbeen there earlier, had \u2014 had an awful lot of trouble, because Jews began\nmonopolizing some of the downtown markets in Mexico City, and the Mexican \u2014\nth-the people who had been in these stores, in \u2014 before, even though they sold out,\nthey \u2014 it\u2019s not that they were pushed out, they were sold out, they \u2014 they started\nbearing a resentment, and this traditionalist movement was very unpleasant. In other\nwords, they \u2014 they used to come to the boats, and used to have placards, and Jews\ngo home, and don\u2019t \u2014 we don\u2019t need you, and this and that and the other thing. Not\nonly Jews, but the refugiados, which mean refugees in generals, and this was\nSpaniards, and \u2014 basically Spaniards. But Jews were also included in the \u2014 there \u2014\nthere \u2014 there \u2014 there are some books about it. There\u2019s actually a very interesting\nbook written by a friend of ours. I can \u2014 I can let you have that too, eventually. It \u2014\nit was called \u201cMomiento Traditionaliste Mexicano,\u201d and it had two generals as\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 8, 2013\nhead of it. And they were very, very, very unpleasant. Instead of Brownshirts, they\nhad Camisas Parvilas(ph), which is sort of a gray, like a mousy gray, but you\nknow, it wa \u2014 they were inspired on the \u2014 on the Brownshirts. But th-there was\nalways, you know, in \u2014 in \u2014 in [indecipherable] Catholic countries, Mexico was \u2014\nit was always a lay \u2014 latent anti-Semitism. But for all its latency, never \u2014 never \u2014\nnever got over the age of the [indecipherable] it stayed relatively in its place. And\nit \u2014 it \u2014 you know, my father start in a place called Pueblo, which was basically an\nextraordinarily Catholic city. Su-Super Catholic city. The reason for it, of course, 1s\nthat there was not \u2014 there were a lot of old Spanish residents there. Not \u2014 the new\nSpanish were communists and Socialists, and whatever it is. But the old Spanish\nresidents were \u2014 were very traditional. As a matter of fact, the Spanish club in\nMexico had \u2014 that time had a throne waiting for the king and queen to come, when\nthere was no queen and queen \u2014 king and queen any more. And, strangely enough,\nthey did get to use it when this man became \u2014 when Franco made this man king of\n\u2014 but curiously enough, the \u2014 the \u2014 there was \u2014 we \u2014 we \u2014 we never met up with too\nmuch anti-Semitism.",

We \u2014 we \u2014 we lived in Pueblo for a while, because my father, you know,\nfelt that somebody should be there. But they finally dis \u2014 th-there were several\npartners, there were three po \u2014 three or four partners. So, what happened is that each\npartner used to spend a week there. So basically they had one week in \u2014 in the\nmonth to spend there. Ma \u2014 my mother tried at first, but Pueblo was a miserable\ntown, it wa \u2014 it \u2014 it was very close. It was \u2014 you know, it was still old Mexico, it\nwas the \u2014 the place where \u2014 where women knew two \u2014 two \u2014 two roads in the city,\none from \u2014 from their house to their mother-in-law\u2019s, and from their mother-in-\nlaw\u2019s to \u2014 to the market. That was \u2014 that was the extent of their \u2014 their travels. It\nwas very traditionalist place. But th \u2014 th \u2014 you know, it was basically like Hungary.\nThere was \u2014 there was \u2014 you could sense in the air, the anti-Semitism. But you \u2014\nreal \u2014 really, expression of it by violence, you didn\u2019t \u2014 you didn\u2019t see. Well, except\nfor \u2014 for these Camisas Parvilas(ph). But these were also \u2014 they were not \u2014 they\nwere not constant, they were intermittent. There was a man who was called the\nMexican Hitler, Abascal \u2014 actually he\u2019s \u2014 he\u2019s \u2014 one of his sons became labor\nminister in the Fox administration.",

        "A: And, a very unpleasant person. I \u2014 I \u2014 I happened to know him and his brother-\nin-law. His brother-in-law used to run a \u2014 a textile complex, like we \u2014 we used to\ndo. But the brother-in-law was not that unpleasant. I-It \u2014 it \u2014 what \u2014 I'll tell you, the\nonly violence that I had was, I was playing in the park in Budapest. By chance, you\nknow, in Budapest you left your child, and you told him not to \u2014 not to go too far,\nand just left him. So I was playing around, and two \u2014 two obviously hoodlums, or\nwhatever it is, caught me and I don\u2019t know why, you know, they did say you Jew,\nyou\u2019re a Jew, this zsid6, whatever it is.

        "A: Overt anti-Semitism, no.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: No. There was, but 1-1-1f 1t was, it was among the \u2014 the wealthy there. It \u2014 it was\nagain \u2014 again, a strange place. If you went to the real high, conservative, old\nMexicans, they \u2014 they fell in love with Adolf Hitler. They \u2014 in fact, they used to\nhave oil paintings, and \u2014 of Adolf Hitler in their homes, and oil paintings, which\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 8, 2013\nonce in a while show up in antique shows \u2014 shops today in Mexico. And it was\nstrange, because you know, at \u2014 it \u2014 Hitler used to occupy the place of the Virgin of\nGuadalupe in the home. In other words, the \u2014 his place was above the mantle, and\nwhatever it is. Fortunately, Germans were not \u2014 you know, didn\u2019t think very much\nabout Mexicans, you know, they were just one chain below \u2014 below whatever they\n\u2014 they liked. So, I happen to know a lot of people, and especially in the German\nschool system, at th-that time, before they closed it down. The man who had\nactually run the German school in Budapest was running the German school in \u2014 in\nMexico, and \u2014 and he had been very friendly. As a matter of fact, there was another\ncouple of Jewish boys which had been in Budapest as well, which lived in Mexico,\nand this man wanted us to go \u2014 go \u2014 all go into the German school, because he\nneeded the native German speakers, and couldn\u2019t find them in Mexico. So, my\nmother didn\u2019t want to, and the Mexican government was helpful enough in closing\ndown the \u2014 the German school, because the embassy was \u2014 was playing games. But\nit was amazing to me, because th-the Mexican kids were handled very badly by the\nGermans, you know, with \u2014 no matter what their social condition was, they were\nreally treated like second class citizens. Curiously, we were not. I mean, we were\nthere maybe for a week, or two weeks, or whatever it 1s, but we were not \u2014 not\ntreated like \u2014 like second class citizens at all.May 8, 2013",

And he didn\u2019t seem to bother us, but he \u2014 he\nbothered the Mexicans, and the mother \u2014 the mothers used to come crying to the \u2014\nto the director, saying why do you treat my child like that?

That, you know, I shouldn\u2019t do this, and I was\ntaken out, and I was put into a\u2014 a\u2014a military school, Mexican Spanish, ru-run by a\nformer Jesuit. And I stayed there til about the sixth grade, seventh grade, and then\nmy sister convinced my mother that I \u2014 I should be educated in the United States,\nso I, in junior \u2014 in junior high school I started going to \u2014 to the American school\nmyself.",
        "Q: Okay. Were you or \u2014 did your family learn Spanish while you were \u2014 when you\nwere in school? Did you learn Spanish? I guess you had to?",
        "A: Well, I'll tell you very truthfully, I \u2014 I-\u2014I didn\u2019t speak for about three or four\nmonths, and then suddenly I broke out spe-speaking Spanish; my sister likewise.\nMy mother, she didn\u2019t speak good Spanish, but she managed. My father was not a\nlinguist. He never quite spoke Spanish, but I was always surprised that the workers\nknew exactly what he wanted. And you know, this was mechanics, too, I mean, he\nexplained to them, you know, a complex piece of equipment, that \u2014 what he wanted\nto do with it. I didn\u2019t understand a word of what he said, but the mechanic knew\nexactly what he \u2014 in other words, everybody seemed to meet halfway. In other\nwords, my father\u2019s Spanish was understood by the \u2014 the Mexicans he was dealing\nwith, but it was \u2014 he \u2014 he managed quite well, actually. He traveled all over the\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 8, 2013\ncountry, and you had to \u2014 you know, you had to buy again, raw material. Wool was\ndifficult to get from Australia, you could get it, but it was the \u2014 difficult those war\nyears.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: So he \u2014 he used to travel all over Mexico, buying up wool locally, which was\nalso in competition with various existing \u2014 existing companies. It\u2019s \u2014 actually, that\nwas the only \u2014 the only anti-Semitic problem that they had. They had \u2014 there was an\n\u2014 an established Spanish company called Espana Industrial. And they were\nmaking money head over foot, and I mean, they were sending, for about nine\ndollars, something which cost them a dollar to make, or a dollar-fifty to make. And\nmy father, since he knew the trick of using waste, was undercutting them,\nunderselling them, so one day he was called into this Spanish company\u2019s whatever\n\u2014 offices, and was told that either he sold at their same price, or they will put him\nout of business. So my father said, you know what, I\u2019ve \u2014 I\u2019ve just escaped from \u2014\nfrom worse than that, and you know, try, and see who \u2014 who \u2014 who is out of\nbusiness first. They were out of business before we were. I-It\u2019s \u2014 th-th-there was\nlatent anti-Semitism in Latin America. In \u2014 in \u2014 in Argentina, it\u2019s bad. In Mexico\nit was latent. There \u2014 there were some fantastic stories. For example, in Pueblo,\nthere were a lot of Germans. And there was a hotel of all things, called the Ritz, in\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 8, 2013\ndowntown Pueblo. And on Friday nights, the German colony used to close down\nthe \u2014 the hotel\u2019s dining halls, lock the doors. They used to dress themselves up in \u2014\nin Nazi uniforms, and used to sing the Horst Wessel song, and things like that. Real\n\u2014 real Nazi. There was never in \u2014 in Mexico, despite some people who were try to\nmake \u2014 make it up, there was never a \u2014 a real Nazi movement in Mexico, look like\n\u2014 like Argentina, Bolivia, and other places. Th-There \u2014 there was a lot of Nazi\nsympathy, but very, very, very little \u2014 curiously, the Japanese were more active in \u2014\nin \u2014 in\u20141n Mexico. They \u2014 they destroyed several bridges on the western part of\nMexico. They \u2014 our competitor, one of the reasons we were able also to slow him\ndown a little bit is that he had no compunctions of selling to the Japanese, and there\nwere several Japanese submarines that \u2014 that came out to \u2014 to buy his merchandise.\nHe had na \u2014 Americans wouldn\u2019t let him into the United States after the war. And\nbasically, where you used to get machinery, and raw material was the United\nStates, so \u2014 so he had a very serious problem. That helps him \u2014 put him 1\u2014 put him\nout of business. Overt anti-Semitism, you know, actual violence, no.",
        "Q: So would you say that your immigrant experience in Mexico was defined more\nby being a European, or more by being Jewish? Were you able to find a Jewish\ncommunity, a European community, or \u2014\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 8, 2013",
        "A: Well, I\u2014 I1\u2014 we were a little bit lost in the Jewish community, too, because there\nwas a very big German community, it was called Evuno(ph). And there were a lot\nof people who \u2014 who had had troubles with Nazis, especially socialists. The \u2014 the\nformer head of the socialist party in Germany was \u2014 was in Mexico, he \u2014 he\nbecame a photographer, and that\u2019s what he made a living on.

        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: My father had learned Polish late \u2014 late in life, and so had my mother. And the\nfew Jews who \u2014 all the \u2014 the Jews that came from Poland were very Poland\noriented, which my father and mother \u2014 they used to go because, you know, it was\none way of socializing. And the Poles had an own \u2014 their own club, and they used\nto get together once a week just to speak Polish. So my mother used to go, my\nfather used to go. But they were uncomfortable there too, because they \u2014 they were\nMay 8, 2013\nnot Poles, they were \u2014 they \u2014 they \u2014 their allegiance was closer to Russian Jewry\nthan they were to Polish Jewry. They were closer to Bialystok Jewry, which was\nnot Polish, but rather Russian. But we \u2014 we mingled with them all. We used to go to\nthe \u2014 to the Ashkenazi shul, the Ashkenazi synagogue in downtown Mexico. Then,\nsince all the Jews left downtown Mexico, they installed themselves not far from\nwhere we lived, maybe 10 or 15 minute walk. And that\u2019s \u2014 we went there for a\nwhile. My father didn\u2019t like it, and curiously, one thing that he \u2014 he didn\u2019t like also,\nwere these Hassidic Jews. But he \u2014 he and the Hassidic Jew bought a property, and\nmade a synagogue for themselves. But it was basically \u2014 you know, my father was a\ntraditionalist. He did beli \u2014 not believe in Orthodoxy, but traditional Orthodoxy.\nThe \u2014 the Hassidim were rather southern \u2014 southern Polish. They came \u2014 most of\nthem came from around Krakow. This man was \u2014 I don\u2019t remember which ra \u2014\nrabbi he was the [indecipherable] of, but the rabbi\u2019s center was Krakow. And\nsouthern Poland and northern Poland at that time, were different worlds. One was\n\u2014had been Austro-Hungary, the other had been Russia, so, you know, they \u2014 they\n\u2014 there was nothing to speak about, but they got along quite well there. And th-they\n\u2014 he liked traditional things, and th \u2014 the Mexican community was \u2014 was torn, it\nwas either Sephardim, or Ashkenazim, and Ashkenazim so often were very\nreligious, some of them were not religious at all.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 8, 2013",

        "A: Well, my \u2014 my \u2014 I had an uncle. His name was Louie, and he was recruited into\nthe Russian army, a-and the Russians, you know, wanted to convert, and my \u2014 my \u2014\nMay 8, 2013\nmy uncle was not very religious, but he wouldn\u2019t convert. So they \u2014 the tsarist\nofficer gave him every dirty job in \u2014 imaginable, and he took it very kindly, until\nthe day that the officer got really mad, and he horsewhipped him. I mean, there was\nprobably a foot and a half difference between he and the officer, but he grabbed the\nhorsewhip, and started horsewhipping the \u2014 the Russian. Of course, he didn\u2019t even\nstop for a clean shirt at home, he got the \u2014 he went to Konigsburg, from\nKonigsburg he went to London. He lived in England for four or five years, and\nthen he moved to the United States. But the \u2014 the memory stayed with the Russian\narmy, and \u2014 and you had to conscript yourself into the army. The only way that you\ncould get yourself out of the army is if you were an only son, or there were no \u2014 no\n\u2014no other \u2014 well, only son, meaning that if \u2014 if there were no other children, or the\nother siblings were women, you could be exempt from military service. So my\nfather did this, he had a \u2014 a cousin by the name of Efron, who had two daughters.\nSo when he had to go into the army, and he figured that he wasn\u2019t going to be\ntreated very well, and he didn\u2019t want to go \u2014 I mean, let\u2019s be honest about it, he had\nhimself apar \u2014 adopted by this Efron.",

        "A: So, since he was already in business, you know, it\u2019s like my daughter. My\ndaughter is a doctor, so she keeps her maiden name professionally, and so the same\nthing happened here, except you had to merge the two.",
        "Q: That\u2019s a very interesting story.",
        "A: Anyways, if you can later give me a card, I'll try to send you at least first of all,\ncopies of papers, and all kind of \u2014",

        "Q: \u2014 the information in it. I had another question for you. When did your family\nfind out what had happened to the Jewish community in Europe, and what was that\nlike?",
        "A: Well, we all \u2014 we all basically found out about 1944, when I think the \u201cNew\nYork Times\u201d published a whole story. But it wasn\u2019t only that, but you know, there\nhad been an awful lot of deportations, and these deported people never showed up\nagain. Of course, after the war, everybody started looking for \u2014 for everybody, and\nthey found that there was nobody left, practically. We know that my aunt, uncle and\ncousin, were deported to Treblinka. It sounds like my cousin was killed before he\never got to Treblinka, because there was a \u2014 there \u2014 the people who \u2014 who took the\n\u2014 who were put on the train from Bialystok to Treblinka, were \u2014 there was a\nMay 8, 2013\nrebellion, and I think my cousin was involved in that. After the rebellion, they were\nmade to walk to the \u2014 the rest of the distance, which was not \u2014 not \u2014 not a \u2014 in the\n[indecipherable] considerable amount of \u2014 and a lot of people didn\u2019t make it. But it\nseems my cousin was \u2014 was \u2014 was killed before \u2014 before. But my aunt and uncle\nwere \u2014 the rest of my family managed to survive, because they were in Russia.",
        "Q: Mm-hm, okay.",
        "A: Or, they had left Poland. I mean, basically, my father was the sole support of his\nfather, and the sister, who was the mother of my cousin, and a brother who didn\u2019t\nstay very long, he \u2014 he helped my father for about 10 years, and then he went to the\nUnited States about 1912 or \u201913, or something like that. So basically we have no f\n\u2014no\u2014no\u2014 no immediate family in Europe at that time.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: They were either in Israel, or the United States, or \u2014 or Russia. And the ones in\nRussia didn\u2019t \u2014 they didn\u2019t all survive. You had two uncles in Leningrad who died\nin the \u2014 in the siege.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: But I don\u2019t know, we \u2014 we \u2014 we were very adventurous sor-sorts. I think one of\nmy aunts had a child, and she decided that, you know, the child should be a rabbi.\nBut how can he be a rabbi in \u2014 in the [indecipherable]? He had to be a rabbi in\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 8, 2013\nIsrael. So she \u2014 one day, she disappeared. Her husband didn\u2019t know where she\nwent, nobody knew where she went. Years later, somebody said that they had seen\nher in Jerusalem. And as a\u2014 we \u2014 we have \u2014 we have some very, very \u2014 well, you\nknow, the \u2014 it was an adventure to be a Jew, and people were very adventurous.",
        "Q: Excellent.",
        "A: We had \u2014 even my father\u2019s oldest brother, who was a rabbi, first went to\nSweden. Couldn\u2019t make a living being a rabbi. Put up a hat factory, and I think\nwouldn\u2019t make a \u2014 a living with that either, so he went to the United States, and the\nUnited States, his wife didn\u2019t like it. So he went to \u2014 to \u2014 to Israel. And he lived\nquite well there. He \u2014 he \u2014 he \u2014 he was one of the founders of the Bezalel\nmovement, of the art movement, and he was the \u2014 he became an antiquarian.",

But she left me some of the stuff that she had in \u2014 in\n\u2014 in the store, and she \u2014 she had a lot of stuff, she \u2014 she ha \u2014 she was a specialist in\nreal Ottoman art, and she was considered one of the top specialists in Ottoman art.\nShe was also slightly nuts.\nMay 8, 2013",

My father, later on helped some of the technicians that he had at the\nfactory move to Canada in 1956. And you know, it became \u2014 after \u2014 after \u2014 after\nthe war, everybody was helping everybody. For example, my father sis \u2014 this rule\nthat you had to have 20,000 dollars for a family, or 10,000 for an individual, people\nthat had it, th-they recycled this money. In other words, there were \u2014 there were,\nyou know, they were presenting as if this man had 20,000 dollars, you see. Only\nwanted to see the deposit, and that was it, it was \u2014 they showed the deposit, the \u2014\nthe money went to somebody else, or \u2014 so, you know, the \u2014 the \u2014 there was a\u2014a\nreally \u2014 I wouldn\u2019t call it an underground movement, but an over-ground movement\nto \u2014 to meet the legal \u2014 the legal restrictions. Because the United States really\ndidn\u2019t open up til about 1944. My father eventually got his immigration papers, but\nas I said \u2014",

        "Answer: My name is Samuel Marein-Efron, spelled \u2014 hyphenated last name, and I\nwas born in Budapest, Hungary on May 5\", 1933. And my parents\u2019 names were\nDavid and Dwojra, d-w-o-j-r-a, which is basically Polish for Deborah. My father\nwas born in a little town near Bialystok, called Krynki, k-r-y-n-k-i. And my\nmother was actually born in Kiev, in the Ukraine. And in order to \u2014 to get back in \u2014\ninto Poland after the we \u2014 welma \u2014 when the Russian revolution started, they had to\nf \u2014 get her a false Polish birth certificate. And theoretically, on official papers, it\nappears that she was born in Bialystok.",
        "A: Well, it \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 it has the \u2014 it has a history. My father was doing quite well in\nPoland, until Pilsudski came in. Then there was something which 1s referred to\nhistorically as the Ugannah(ph). And basically what that was, it was a tax system\nwhich taxed artisans and industrialists, and didn\u2019t do very much for landowners, or\nothers. So my father was pressed financially, and he gave up \u2014 basically they soldMay 8, 2013\ntheir factories in Poland, and the \u2014 they \u2014 my uncles remained, and they used to\nrent space in \u2014 in other factories, but my father, at first, moved to Finland. And that\nwas a little bit too far from \u2014 from Poland. So he moved again to Zemun in \u2014 well,\ntoday it is Serbia. And in Serbia he had a bad experience, he ran in with a cousin of\nthe king, who liked his business, so they gave him 72 hours to leave the country.\nAnd he had a \u2014 a number of jobs, until finally he \u2014 he found a job with a very big\nHungarian complex called Csepel, that was run by a \u2014 a Jewish entrepreneur,\nManfred George \u2014 actually, George Manfred. Hungarians, they do it the other\nway around. And he was head of \u2014 he first became the head of the factory that they\nhad in Slovakia, in Zylina, z-y-l-i-n-a. And first my mother wouldn\u2019t \u2014 wouldn\u2019t\nthink of \u2014 of living there, and nunb \u2014 it was the center of \u2014 basically, of Slovakian\nnationalism. This man Klinker(ph) and \u2014 and Tiso(ph), this was their main \u2014 main\ncenter of operations. And so my mother was very unhappy there, so she said \u2014 she s\n\u2014 when she found out that she was pregnant, she decided that she \u2014 this was not the\nplace to deliver a child. So, we moved to the headquarters of the conglomerate,\nwhich was Budapest.",
        "A: It was called Csepel, c-s-e-p-e-l.\nMay 8, 2013",
        "A: It was a huge complex, basically. It\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s biggest income came from food,\nfrom importing and export \u2014 basically exporting Hungarian agricultural products,\nbut he was also the main producer of aluminum in Hungary. He \u2014 they had a\ngenerators sunk into the Danube. And not only did they produce aluminum, they \u2014\nthey actually gave el-electricity to \u2014 to Budapest. And another thing which they\nused to do were \u2014 was airplane parts. They used to manufacture airplane parts, and\nthey had a big, big textile complex on the island. It \u2014 Csepel is really the name of an\nisland in the Danube, but it was called Csepel, the complex itself. It\u2019s \u2014 it \u2014 it\nbasically \u2014 he \u2014 he was pro \u2014 th-the owner was probably the second or third we-\nwealthiest person in \u2014 in \u2014 in Hungary. And he \u2014 he \u2014 he was basically very, very\nfriendly with the government. In \u2014 and \u2014 any time they were short 10 \u2014 10 or 15\nmillion dollars, he would lend it to them, in lieu of taxes, so you know, the \u2014 the \u2014\nthere was a very good relationship between him and the Hungarian government.",
        "A: I was born in Budapest, yes.",
        "A: May 5\", 1933.\nMay 8, 2013",
        "A: Well, I\u2014 I\u2014I was literally considered a Hungarian, even though by law, I wasn\u2019t\none. In Hungary, to be Hungarian citizen, you had to have your father to be a\nHungarian citizen, which my father was not. He was a \u2014 a Polish citizenship. He \u2014\nhe \u2014 he was born actually in the Russian part of Poland, but after Versailles, that\nbecame again, it was recu \u2014 constituted as Poland, so he re \u2014 he became a Polish\ncitizen. But I \u2014 I was considered a Hungarian in school and elsewhere. My parents \u2014\nHungarian is a very difficult language, and my mother spoke it passably, my father\nvery, very little, and my sister learned to speak Hungarian quite \u2014 quite well, I\nmean. My sibling is seven and a half years older than I was, and she was actually\nborn in Bialystok, and she \u2014 she did learn Hungarian quite well, yes. But we were\nboth considered really Hungarians, even though nobody asked for our passports,\nwhich was a1 -\u2014a lucky thing.",
        "A: Well, this 1 \u2014 this is very complicated, actually, th-the \u2014 the home language used\nto be Russian. When I was born, I \u2014 I was not taught Russian. So basically, it\nbecame a mix \u2014 mixture of German of Yiddish. My sister spoke \u2014 didn\u2019t speak very\ngood Yiddish, she talked mostly German, because she went to German schools. My\nfather spoke Yiddish, my mother spoke very, very bad Yiddish. She spoke a very\ncomplex mixture of Yiddish and German. It \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 it was a complicated affair. In\nMay 8, 2013\nother words, no \u2014 no two people had a common language, you know, three people\nhad a common language.",

And after I \u2014 I\ngot out of bed, the German school wouldn\u2019t have me there. So I had to go toa\u2014a\nHungarian public school, which was perfectly adequate and nice.",

        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Well, my father and mother came from very, very religious families, especially\nmy father. My \u2014 my grandfather had been a melamed, a teacher. And he \u2014 he was\nconsidered a rabbi. I\u2019m not sure whether he had the smichas, whether he had the \u2014\nhe could really be called a rabbi, but he was certainly \u2014 it \u2014 1t seems, because I\nnever met him, that he was considered to be an extremely knowledgeable person,\nand \u2014 and people used to come to him for advice. But my mother came from a reli \u2014\nreligious family, but \u2014 an-and we were relatively religious. My mother kept a\nkosher home to \u2014 to her dying day. And we \u2014 we used to go to holidays, to \u2014 to the\nsynagogue, and my father worked on Saturday, so that didn\u2019t make him a very\nreligious person. And when he was traveling, he \u2014 he ate whatever he could get, not\n\u2014 not basically very \u2014 he \u2014 he did not think of keeping dietary laws, and things like\nthat. I would say we were \u2014 we were traditional.",

        "A: Well, hi-his main \u2014 first of all, he \u2014 he was a specialist in \u2014 in \u2014 in producing a\nfabric which was made of [indecipherable] coat \u2014 coating fabric which \u2014 the word\nthat has come to \u2014 to us, is loden. And the reason it\u2019s called loden is that the fa \u2014\nthe main factory producing it, which was not from this complex, but from\nsomebody else, a man by name of Weingarten(ph), was in a section of Budapest\ncalled Loden. So they used to say yes, we want the fabric from Loden, and the\nname stuck. But he used to be a specialist, and one of the biggest problems that he\nhad was raw material. He had to find [indecipherable] and th-the \u2014 the \u2014 the two or\nthree plants where he was working consumed a huge amount of this, and specially\nthese are the years where armies in \u2014 in Europe had to be dressed, and this was the\nbasic coating material practically for everybody; for the German army, for the\nPolish army, for the \u2014 you name it. Practically the whole western European armies\nused to consume this heavy, loden fabric. But the problem was to find raw material,\nwhich is why he ended up in the United States, as a matter of fact.",
        "A: Yeah.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 8, 2013",
        "A: Well, Pll \u2014 Ill tell you very truthfully, in Hungary there was so much latent\nanti-Semitism that with laws and without laws, it \u2014 it \u2014 it didn\u2019t change the situation\nvery much. I was a little bit surprised at the question that I was asked, because\ncuriously enough \u2014 and I spoke to my sister about this, it would seem that th-there\nwas less talk of Hitler in Hungary, as there was more talk of Mussolini. So, some\nreason another, it was only in this corporate state was much more popular as a\u2014 as a\npiece of conversation, than Hitler. And anti-Semitism was latent. In \u2014 in \u2014 in the\nyears before we left, where we didn\u2019t know where the outcome was, there was, you\nknow, they were pe \u2014 recruiting Jewish young men, but some were sent to the army,\nsome were sent to work camps. The work camps turned out to be pretty much\nextermination camps. I mean, they \u2014 they worked you to \u2014 to \u2014 to the bone, I think.\nThere was a\u2014a movie called rou \u2014 Rosenschein(ph), or something like that, which\ndescribed one of these work camps in \u2014 in Hungary. But basically, no-nobody\nheard anything. At least w-we \u2014 we weren\u2019t aware of it. And going to a German\nschool, we were not very aware of it. I mean, we were aware of it in that for\nMay 8, 2013\nexample, the \u2014 the Nazi clubs in which the youth \u2014 youth clubs, wouldn\u2019t have us.\nAnd that \u2014 certainly my sister was absolutely livid, because you know, uniforms\nand parties, and \u2014 and excursions, and whatever it is. But even the school, there was\nno \u2014 no \u2014 no latent anti-Semitism. There were quite a few Jewish students in \u2014 in\nthe \u2014 in the German school.",
        "A: No, no \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 because we were all \u2014",
        "A: \u2014I mean, since I \u2014 the \u2014 the language, my \u2014 should be saying my mother tongue\nwas Hungarian.",
        "A: I certainly was not \u2014 not looked upon very differently as any \u2014 as anywhere else.",
        "A: Well, basically, there was such a huge Jewish population in Budapest, that you\ncan hardly pinpoint a \u2014 a Jewish neighborhood. I mean \u2014\nMay 8, 2013",
        "A: \u2014 all \u2014 all neighborhoods had Jews. We were living basically, in the area which \u2014\nright \u2014 right on the Danube where \u2014 where actually, where the Swedish embassy\nbought most of those buildings, later on, I mean, we \u2014 were not there anymore. But\nthat \u2014 that is where \u2014 where the Swedish embassy bought all those buildings. It was\nright on the \u2014 on the shore of the Danube, right in front of Saint Margaret\u2019s island,\nMargitteet(ph). And it was really \u2014 it was a wealthy community, it was \u2014 you had\nto have a certain \u2014 certain economic status to be able to live there.",
        "A: And \u2014 but then there were Jewish synagogues, Jewish [indecipherable]. There\nwere \u2014 there \u2014 there wi \u2014 there was even a synagogue three or four blocks down, on\nthe street. But you couldn\u2019t pinpoint it as really \u2014 as a Jewish section. There were a\nlot of Jews in there, but not \u2014 not necessarily Jewish.",
        "A: Well, my father, around 19 \u2014 well, he \u2014 he \u2014 he had constantly \u2014 was constantly\non the move, trying to locate raw materials, he \u2014 he went to places, you know,\nwhich we thought were absolutely the end of the world, like Greece or Turkey or\nnorth Africa. But there were \u2014 there was considerable wool merch \u2014 wool \u2014 wool\nproducts, used wool products there. He had the brother, for example that he set upMay 8, 2013\nin business in Paris, collecting for him. But no ma \u2014 he had \u2014 they had a\nrelationship with the English company called John Crowther and Sons, in\nMilnsbridge, which supplied a lot of raw material too, but th-they were always\nstarved for raw material. So my father decided that the only sizable place that he\ncould think of that would have raw material was the United States. And basically,\nhe also had there two brothers and a sister, which he hadn\u2019t seen in some 30 years.\nSo he, you know, he figured all of these things together, my mother wouldn\u2019t go,\nbecause we had to go to school, and so forth, and so on. Those trips were long. And\nhe \u2014 he planned to be away for a long, long, long period of time, because he had to\nset up this business. So he actually came to New York, and he \u2014 he set up a\nbusiness in Passaic, New Jersey, and he spent here well over six months, I think\nabout nine months, or something like that. And then he decided to go back to \u2014 to\nEurope, and he got as far as Belgium, and took the train to \u2014 to Berlin, but he was\nturned back, because the Germans had invaded Belgium. So, he basically got onto\nthe same boat that he took to New York, and came back to New York. He made a\nsecond attempt to return to southern Europe, but he only got as far as France, and\nhe had to turn back. And then, of course, the United States was very, very \u2014 should\nwe Say, not receptive to \u2014 to \u2014 to refugees from an \u2014 anybody from Europe, as they\nhad this quota system, which I understand 90 percent of the quota were never filled.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 8, 2013\nBut anyways, he \u2014 he applied to stay in the United States, and he was hoping to\nbring us all there, at least to sit out the \u2014 the \u2014 the war, because he knew that if he\ncouldn\u2019t get back two ways, I mean there was no reason for us to \u2014 to stay there. So\nhe applied here f\u2014 as a matter of fact, there\u2019s a man by the name of Yrin, who does\ngenealogy in this country, y-r-i-n. And one day, from the blue, he contact me,\nbecause this \u2014 a second name in my last name is Efron, and he was making a\nhistory of the Efrons. And he asked me about it, and \u2014 and he seems to have found,\nin the Springfield repository of the national archives, actually first papers from my\nmother, myself and \u2014 and my sister. But first papers, we never got the visa.",
        "A: So the problem was that he was about to \u2014 to be deported. And somebody told\nhim that in Mexico, if he showed a certain amount of money, you could get an\ninvestors visa. So, since he had a \u2014 he came with a considerable amount of money\nto set up this business, there was no problem with that. He \u2014 he \u2014 he sira \u2014 he \u2014 he\npresented his papers, he \u2014 he \u2014 he put in \u2014 he \u2014 he showed them the deposit in the\nbank and so forth, and so on. And I understand there was a \u2014 a\u2014 a problem with \u2014\nwith telegrams and God knows what, but basically he got the \u2014 the visa about two\ndays before he was going to be deported from the United States. So he traveled by\ntrain to the border, to Laredo. And this was June.\nMay 8, 2013",
        "A: For \u2014 1940.",
        "A: And Laredo in June is the \u2014 I think hell 1s cooler than \u2014 than Laredo. It\u2019s abou \u2014\nabout 105 \u2014 110 in the shade, and no shade. And this was before air conditioning.\nThe only relief was a movie theater, because the \u2014 they had these huge ice blocks,\nwhich somebody was \u2014 they had ventilators blowing on them there; called ice\ncooled, or whatever it was. So somebody told him that Mexico City was somewhat\nmore pleasant, 1t a \u2014 the weather was \u2014 was more pleasant. So he took the train to\nMexico City, he had a Mexican visa. So he took the train to Mexico City and \u2014 and\ntrue in \u2014 the temperature was like \u2014 like the Balkans and \u2014 and th \u2014 in the middle of\nsummer, Mexico City runs around 22 to 26 degrees centigrade. Around 80, at \u2014 at\nbest. So he found very pleasant. And by \u2014 by accident, he met some people that he\nknew from \u2014 from Europe. He was sitting in the park, and suddenly he saw people\nthat he remembered in Paris. You know, the \u2014 the \u2014 you had to \u2014 you had to know\nsomebody to get money out of Europe at that time. Everybody had a \u2014 a currency\ncontrol system. So he had \u2014 he knew these two people, one from Geneva, one from\nParis, who had been doing this for Jews, all over central Europe. They were\nmoving money in and out of central Europe, and moving it to the United States, toMay 8, 2013\nthe Chase Manhattan bank, through Chase Manhattan in \u2014 in Paris. So he saw\nthese two people in the park, and says, what are you doing here? They says, the\nsame thing that you are. We are waiting for an American immigration visa. So my\nfather said, you know what, we don\u2019t know how long we\u2019re going to have to wait,\nwhether it\u2019s a week, a month, or \u2014 or \u2014 or years. And we\u2019re eating up our capital,\nyou know, maybe we should start doing something. So they \u2014 they got together, and\nthey started a business, which lasted 50 \u2014 54 years, 55 years, and by the time when\nmy father got his American immigration visa, he wasn\u2019t interested. He had already\nmade a \u2014 quite a commitment to \u2014 to Mexico. So we \u2014 we \u2014 we remained in\nMexico.",
        "A: He left \u2014 he \u2014 he must have left before the invasion of Poland.",

        "A: \u2014 to New York.",
        "A: Because my mother and I went to see my aunt and uncle in Bialystok, and this\nwas \u2014 it was not spring yet, in \u2014 in 1931 \u2014 1939. It was late winter \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 1939 that we went to visit them. We stayed there for a month. And we \u2014 we\ncame back to \u2014 to Budapest. I think the invasion was September, so \u2014",

        "A: Well, my father, since he was still working through the company, we \u2014 we were\ndrawing his salary, and my father was probably drawing one of his biggest salaries\nin Hungary, if not the biggest salary. So we were living quite \u2014 quite \u2014 quite\ncomfortably, we \u2014 we had our apartment on Santish(ph) Venut(ph), which is a po \u2014\na \u2014a very \u2014 was a very stylish, very, very well-to-do neighborhood, and we kept\nliving normally, the way we had tha \u2014 lived before.",
        "A: Well, w-we were concerned, we were very concerned, because two things\nhappened. The first thing was I had a cousin who was the daughter of my aunt in\nPoland. And she had \u2014 sh-she had not been able to get into an \u2014 a Polish university,\nbecause of the numerous clauses, because of the Jewish exclusion rule. So she had\ntaken on \u2014 she had gone to the Charles University in Prague, and she was studying\nmedicine there, and we kept very close contact with her. She \u2014 she used to come\nseveral times a month to Budapest to see m \u2014 to see \u2014 see our family. And\nbasically, my father was supporting her. And she basically told us that, you know,\nthey \u2014 she had been able to speak to her parents up to probably November of \u2014 of\n1939. And the way she mi \u2014 she was able to speak to them is that basically she\nfound a \u2014 a farmer \u2014 they found a farmer whose telephone was still working forMay 8, 2013\nlong distance calls. And every weekend they used to be in touch with her. And then\nsuddenly, at the end of November, they \u2014 no more was heard from them. She tried \u2014\nmy cousin tried to go back into Poland, she was sent back from the border, she was\nnot allowed in. And so, you know, we \u2014 we were extremely worried, because we \u2014\nwe heard nothing. That was the last thing we ever heard of my aunt and uncle. But\nmy \u2014 my cousin was in constant touch with us. And as a matter of fact, even\nthrough the war, she was in touch with us. She \u2014 she was \u2014 again, she was being\nfinanced both economically, and false papers, by the management of the company\nwith \u2014 which my father had a partnership in Zylina. So she basically \u2014 I\u2014 I don\u2019t\nknow how this man did it, but he \u2014 he \u2014 through the red cro \u2014 we were getting Red\nCross letters almost every two or \u2014 two or three months. Heavily censored, but at\nleast we got news, and said that, you know, she was all right, and this and that, and\nthe other thing, but w-we kept pretty \u2014 pretty \u2014 pretty much in touch with her til \u2014 til\nearly 1944.",
        "A: Well, it \u2014 it is \u2014 the \u2014 the company, which was \u2014 my father originally got into the\ncompany by managing the \u2014 the \u2014 this huge plant that they had Zylina, in Slovakia.\nAnd the plant was managed by man called Mousekopf(ph). This man Mousekopf\nMay 8, 2013\nwas Jewish, and he \u2014 he managed to \u2014 to \u2014 since he \u2014 it was important for the\nGerman war effort \u2014 I mean, he was producing coating and fabrics for \u2014 for the\nGerman army. He was what they call a protected Jew. So basically he \u2014 he was able\nto move around and \u2014 and he was able to \u2014 to employ a lo \u2014 there was a very big ge\n\u2014 pop \u2014 Jewish population in Zylina. Zylina is very close to the Polish border, it\u2019s a\nPolish German border. So, he was able to \u2014 to \u2014 to supply jobs to a lot of the Jews in\nthe \u2014 in the city, and many of these people were not supposed to be there. In other\nwords, they \u2014 they had been refugees from Poland. So they \u2014 Mr. Mousekopf(ph)\nmanaged to get residence papers for them. And they didn\u2019t get residence papers, he\ndid exactly what he did for my cousin, which 1s picked up papers of people that had\ndied, or something like that. Which was very dangerous and not \u2014 not \u2014 it \u2014 it \u2014 you\nknow, it\u2019s something that may have worked for a month or two, and then they had\nto fire them, a-and give them a new set of papers, and rehire them, because the\nGermans \u2014 not the Germans, but the \u2014 the USB, the Slovakian secret service\nsuddenly got the list of people which had died, and this man \u2014 these peop \u2014 1-1t was\na\u2014a very complicated undertaking, but he \u2014 he managed to \u2014 to save, I would say\nseveral hundred, if not \u2014 not \u2014 not a thousand, or more people in the Zylina area for\n\u2014 from the Germans, until 1944, when the Germans came in, got rid of the\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 8, 2013\nSlovakian puppet government, and that was the \u2014 then there they took Jews, no\nmatter whether protected or unprotected, or whatever they were.",
        "A: And the \u2014",
        "A: Well, my cousin \u2014 my cousin is a\u2014 was a strange person. She was a strange\nperson to the day that she died. She was a rebel, of the worst sort. I mean, as a child\nshe had joined Hashomer Hatzair in Bialystok, which was not considered very \u2014\nvery Jewish, among the better \u2014 better members of the community, because they\nwere the poorest of the poor, and the \u2014 the \u2014 they were definitely communistic. So,\nshe had joined the Hashomer Hatzair, and of course, she in see \u2014 she was the only\none that was living in the \u2014 1-in a decent housing area, all the meetings were held in\nher apartment, and my uncle used to absolutely blow his top. But it passed. And she\nwas like that, too. She went to \u2014 to Czechoslovakia, and when the Germans\ninvaded, she \u2014 she \u2014 she was part of the Czech underground. She basically spoke\nvery good German, and she looked German. She \u2014 she was blonde, blue eyed. Blue\neyed to the point of gray eye. So she made friends in the German occupation forces,\nand she got herself a job as the doctor. She \u2014 she was still a medical student, but she\nwas in her process of getting her internship, whatever it is. So she was able to get\nMay 8, 2013\nherself a job at the Gestapo jail in \u2014 in \u2014 in \u2014 in Prague, and she became the conduit\nbetween the people which were being held at the jail, and the underground and their\nfamilies. And she did this til 1941, the Germans invaded Czechoslovakia in 1938.\nThe university was closed, I think in November of 1938, because of strikes, student\nstrikes. But she \u2014 she remained there, and she became an important cog 1n the\ncommunications system of the underground, with these people, until \u2014 until the end\nof 1941, when she suspected that she was compromised. In fact, we\u2019ve gone to the\nHolocaust Museum facilities, German files, and it\u2019s a fact. I mean, the Germans had\nher take \u2014 they had picked her up several times and let her go. But there was a\u2014a\nrecord that she had been caught at \u2014 as a Jewess not wearing a Jewish yellow Star of\nDavid. There were several reasons that she had been picked up, because she had\nmanaged to \u2014 she \u2014 she was extremely adroit at getting herself out of trouble. As a\nmatter of fact, she got, at one point, papers, which Mr. Mousekopf(ph) didn\u2019t know\nit, but they were of a communist girl. And guess what? The Germans had her on the\nlist of \u2014 of people that they \u2014 they had to \u2014 so she came \u2014 she was taken to Gestapo\nheadquarters, she was taken to the Gestapo head. And she walks into her office \u2014\ninto his office, and she sees a picture behind his desk of Bialystok. So he \u2014 she\ndidn\u2019t let him say hello, it\u2019s just \u2014 she says, you know, ho-how did you ever have\nthis picture of Bialystok? So he says, well, you know, I was stationed there, I wasMay 8, 2013\nthe head of the Gestapo in Bialystok. So how \u2014 how were you related to Bialystok?\nShe says, well, I\u2014 I belong to the German population of Bialystok, which \u2014 which\nwere factory owners, and my father was a factory owner. And this is how I know\nBialystok very well. My \u2014 my \u2014 my parents were still there for a while, I don\u2019t\nknow where they are now, because the general \u2014 Generalgouvernement is not very\ninformative as to where people are. So, you know, he made \u2014 she made a friendship,\nand when she walked in, she was about to be sent to wherever \u2014 God knows\n[indecipherable] was sent. She managed to walk out four hours later. And she\nmanaged also to \u2014 this false paper that she had, she managed to give it a certain aura\nof credibility. In other words, you know, he asked her, well, how come you are a\ncommunist? She says, you know, these were things of when you are a young ma \u2014\nperson, you \u2014 you think of other people, and this and that, and not of yourself. But\nthis is something which is \u2014 which is gone past. So she managed to \u2014 to survive this\nway, on this set of papers, for close to three \u2014 three \u2014 well, more than that, she \u2014 she\n\u2014 she crossed the \u2014 the \u2014 she\u2019s crossed into Slovakia from \u2014 from the Czech\nRepublic, from the other half, the night of Christmas of 1942. They figured that,\nand figured correctly that the German guards would be all drunk, having a\nChristmas party, and there was a huge snowstorm that night, but they managed to\ncross into Slovakia. Into Slovakia, they already had Mr. Mousekopf(ph) to help\nMay 8, 2013\nher, and she lived in Nitra from late 1941 to early 1944, til practically August,\nSeptember of 1944. She \u2014 she had joined also, the Slovakian underground. There\nwas a Slovakian uprising, I think in August \u2014 July or August of 1944, which was the\nreason that the Germans came in. They felt that the Slovakians couldn\u2019t handle this,\nso they came in, and they cleaned out the place, to their liking. My cousin, curiously\nenough, could have survived, but again, she \u2014 principle was \u2014 used to get her, and\nthis time it got her, too. Was basically she \u2014 she \u2014 she tells that she was picked up\nby the Germans, taken to the Gestapo headquarters, and sat down with a group of\nJews. And this man that she knew in the Gestapo walked in, and says, what are you\ndoing sitting there? You\u2019re not Jewish. Go home. So she got up and went home, and\nshe describes it as having had a terrible night. I mean, considering that the rest of\nthe Jewish population was being done to something, and deported, or whatever it is.\nSo she basically walked in the next morning, into Gestapo headquarters and said,\nyou know, you\u2019re looking for Jews, I\u2019m Jewish. The man was floored. He never in\nhis wildest dream imagined her to be Jewish. She was about as far physically from\nbeing a Jew as \u2014 as \u2014 as you can imagine. Of course, didn\u2019t \u2014 this didn\u2019t help her.\nBut she helped other people. She took Mr. Mousekopf\u2019s(ph) wife and daughter.\nShe \u2014 she \u2014 she was able to \u2014 she went to Birkenau, and in the same transport, Mr.\nMousekopf\u2019s(ph) wife and daughter were \u2014 were in that same transport. Mr.May 8, 2013\nMousekopf(ph) had been actually \u2014 was able to hide with some \u2014 some Catholic\npriest. And she \u2014 she told the people at Birkenau that she was a surgeon, she was a\n\u2014a doctor. So there was a shortage of doctors, not only for \u2014 for the inmates, but for\nactually the general population outside of the camps. So she was transported to\nGross-Rosen, which was a satellite camp. And she said that she needed assistants.\nShe was put in charge of a group of 200 agriculture workers, that were working in\nthe fields around Gross-Rosen. So she said that, you know, she needed assistants.\nSo she got the wife and daughter of \u2014 of this man Mousekopf(ph) to be her\nassistants, and all \u2014 all three survived the war. And she \u2014 she not only \u2014 she was\nactually taken by the camp commandant to his town in northern Germany, to see\nhis mother, who was sick. And she says she could have stayed there. I mean, they\nliked her, they \u2014 they fed her, they \u2014 they clothed her, they \u2014 and \u2014 and they were\nvery interested for her to stay around, because the mother seemed to be better with\nher being around. But she felt a responsibility, curiously enough, for those 200\npeople in Gross-Rosen, so she went back to the camps, and she stayed there til\nliberation, til \u2014 til May \u2014 May of 1945. Of course, we \u2014 we \u2014 we found out about her\nalmost immediately. As liberation occurred, she was able to communicate with us,\nand we asked what happened to Mother and Father, and she says, we don\u2019t know. I\nlost total communications with her. I spoke to Vera(ph) the last time, which was\nMay 8, 2013\nend of 19 \u2014 1939, early 1940. And she \u2014 you know, she told us the whole story, but\nwe were \u2014 and my father actually came back, and believe it or not, paid \u2014 returned\nthe money to the company that had been given out for my cousin, not for the other \u2014\nwell, the others worked at the company. But he felt that, you know, property pro \u2014\npropriety was important.",
        "A: How?",
        "A: Her name is Shula(ph) Lozowska. Her married name was Graf(ph).",
        "A: As \u2014 as a matter of fact, it\u2019s very funny, but we were in Prague about two years\nago, and one of the synagogues has all 50,000 deportees name on it. So my wife\nsays, you know, do we know anybody here? So curiously enough, you know,\n50,000 names, coincidence is un \u2014 unbelievable. Right in front of my face was\nShula(ph) Lozowska.",
        "A: 1913, it didn\u2019t have a second date for her, because they knew that she was\ndeported to Birkenau. Very, very few people came back from the \u2014 Birkenau.",
        "A: Lozowska is spelled I-o-z-o-w-s-k-a. I will \u2014 I will send you \u2014 I\u2014 I\u2019m collecting\na lot of copies of papers that I have \u2014 I \u2014 I have her \u2014 her German I.D. documents, I\nhave \u2014 I still have some \u2014 some things left over, and PII let you have it.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: Cause, you know, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s worth it.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: No, we \u2014 we \u2014 we\u2019re \u2014 we\u2019re there til early ni \u2014 19 \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 well, th-that was also a confusing issue. First, my father kept writing sa \u2014\nhorrible letters about Mexico, you know, poverty, dirt, this and that. My father \u2014 my\nmother said, you know, what are you trying to do to me? I mean, I\u2019m perfectly\nhappy here. Budapest is a nice, clean city, with no problems of any \u2014 any sort. So,\nbasically, I actually think that somebody \u2014 a \u2014 a general, or maybe even a field\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 8, 2013\nmarshal \u2014 I mean, the German army, who was the buyer for the cloth for the\nGerman army, came to talk to my mother, and he told her, look, this is no \u2014 no time\nfor a Jew to be in \u2014 in \u2014 in Europe, and you know the \u2014 this will take a year, two\nyears, and everything will be settled again, everything will come into its normal\ncourse, and you\u2019ll come back. But at this point, this is no point \u2014 no time to \u2014 for a\nJew to be in \u2014 in \u2014 1n Europe. Convinced her. The next problem was how to \u2014 how\nto travel. My father had arranged for her to \u2014 to take Verlichs(ph) out of Trieste \u2014\nth-the ship out of Trieste to New York, there were two problems. First of all, she c-\ncouldn\u2019t \u2014 she \u2014 she \u2014 it was very difficult to get a transit visa to the United States,\nwhich I think she finally got. But before she could leave, Mussolini got into the\nwar, so that cut it off. Next thing is how to go when there \u2014 there were a lot of\nJewish refugees who went to Russia. In other words, they \u2014 they took the Trans-\nSiberian to Vladivostok, from Vladivostok to \u2014 to San Francisco, or if not, from\nVladivostok to Osaka, or Shanghai, and from there to \u2014 to San Francisco. So she\nfigured that that made sense. I mean, Hungary has a border with \u2014 with Russia, and\nshe hadn\u2019t seen her mother for, I don\u2019t know, 30 years, or 25 years, 30 years, so she\nwould do both things. So she started to get a\u2014 a \u2014 a Russian visa. She actually went\nto the Russian consul, and she applied, and she left, and \u2014 and obviously the consul\nwas Jewish. And he came running after her, and he told her, look, I can give you a\nMay 8, 2013\nvisa, I can guarantee that you can get into the country. I cannot guarantee that you\nwill be allowed to leave. So my mother, you know, advice to the wise \u2014 wise, you\nonly give once. So she tried then, going out through \u2014 through Spain, through \u2014\nwell, there were several problems in there. First of all, the Mexicans did not wish to\ngive her the visa on anything but the Polish passport. And the Cubans wouldn\u2019t give\nher a transit visa either on \u2014 except on the Polish passport. She still had the valid\nPolish passport. I mean, Poland didn\u2019t exist, but she still had a valish por \u2014 Polish\npa \u2014 of course, here the problem came to the rest of Europe. I mean, place like\nSwitzerland, a place like Austria, a place like unoccupied France. To them\nPoland doesn\u2019t \u2014 did not exist anymore.",
        "A: So, you couldn\u2019t \u2014 you know, you can\u2019t travel through us with that Polish\npassport. So my father\u2019s company, since they had such good relationship with the \u2014\nwith the Hungarian government, managed to get, for my mother, a\n[indecipherable] passport, a League of Nations passport. So, well she \u2014 she got\nherself into, you know, this is a complication. First you couldn\u2019t \u2014 at that time you\ncouldn\u2019t travel with two passports. So one had to be very well hidden. So basically,\nshe was \u2014 1-1t took her a good six months, or seven months, to get all the transit\nvisas there. The German transit visa through all \u2014 through then Germany, German\nMay 8, 2013\nAustria, and you had to go through southern Germany, through Miinsing to\nMunich, to the Swiss border. And then you went across Switzerland to Geneva,\nand then you took a \u2014 a train across Vichy, France to [indecipherable] in Spain.\nThe \u2014 the most difficult visa of them all was the \u2014 was the French, the\n[indecipherable] government visa. She managed to \u2014 to get it. She \u2014 she was a very\nstrong woman, and she wouldn\u2019t take no for an answer, so she managed to get\neverything together by about February of 1941. And we left for \u2014 for Spain, and\ntraveled through Germany. We managed to \u2014 to be in men \u2014 min \u2014 Miinsing, in\nMunich the night of the \u2014 of the speech of Hitler in the \u2014 in the beer \u2014 beer\nstuben(ph), in the beer \u2014 beer hall. And the British were bombing, and you know,\nbeing in the railroad station during a bombing 1s the wrong place to be. Anyways,\nnoth \u2014 they did not bomb there. They were trying to get Hitler, so they bombed all\nof Munich, except for the railroad station. We got out of there, we got into\nSwitzerland, we had to stay in Switzerland almost two weeks, I think. And then\nwe went to Spain, and Spain was another problem, because Spain \u2014 this was the\nend of the civil war, and th-there was no food in Spain. So we were given the\nprivilege to live in \u2014 in the hotel, which the Spanish government had for foreign\ndignitaries, which was not far from the Prado. So we stayed there til \u2014 til the boat\nthat we were supposed to take, arrived in Vigo. We went to Vigo, we had a \u2014 a bad\nMay 8, 2013\nexperience there, too. My mother was a type which when she traveled, took\neverything with her. And imagine traveling to war torn Europe with 22 pieces of\nluggage, including two steamer trunks. She managed it. I mean no ha \u2014 anyways, in\nSpain, she made a \u2014 a terrible mistake. She met a Hungarian, and she said, you\nknow, I worry about this and that and the other thing, because I took everything. I\ntook my silver, I took my jewels, I took this, I took that, and everything is packed\naway in these 22 bags. So sure enough, it was a terrible mistake, because the guy\nwent and spoke to the \u2014 to the Spanish customs. And we were already on the boat,\nand suddenly Spanish customs come up on the boat, and hold the boat, and they\nwant to see my mother\u2019s bags. So they started opening bags, and my sister, in all\ninnocence, she had a bar of chocolate, that we brought from Switzerland, and she\noffered it to the \u2014 to the inspector, to the Spanish customs inspector, you know, as a\ncourtesy. Here, would you like to have this? Obviously the man hadn\u2019t seen a bar of\nchocolate in God knows when. He said, close up everything, we have nothing to do,\nwe\u2019re just holding up the boat. Get out. So, you see, we were \u2014 we were saved by a\nbar of chocolate. But my mother was, in that sense, you know, very strange. She \u2014\nshe used to \u2014 people used to tell her, don\u2019t do this. She said, Pll do it, and PI- Vl\ncarry it through, and she \u2014 she was able to carry through almost anything that she\nundertook. She \u2014 very \u2014 very strong personality.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 8, 2013",
        "A: No, we had \u2014 we had an immigration visa.",
        "A: Yes. A-Actually, that was very lucky, because the Mexican insis \u2014 wanted to\nhave a Polish passport, but they didn\u2019t trust passports in general. So basically, what\nthey used to do 1s, an \u2014 and I'll try to get you a copy of that, too, they used to give\nyou a\u2014a\u2014a-\u2014apiece of cardboard, with your picture on it, with a authorization to\nenter Mexico. So basically, you didn\u2019t have to have a passport. I-It \u2014 it was just\nshown that the \u2014 at the consulate, or whatever it is, and the consulate, put all the\ndetails of the passport in this piece of paper, and Mexican immigration didn\u2019t \u2014 the\n\u2014 the problem was, I understand, was Portugal, because in Portugal they wouldn\u2019t\ngive her a transit visa, unless she had \u2014 showed a \u2014 a Polish passport, and she didn\u2019t\nwant to show it. So, finally, after a long argument, saying look, Poland doesn\u2019t\nexist. Poland is now Germany.",
        "A: And we have no way of getting a\u2014 a German passport. So with that, and a little\nconsideration, I think helped \u2014 helped us get a transit visa to \u2014 to Portugal. So what\nwe did is we took the boat from Vigo, and the boat made a two day stop in Lisbon.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 8, 2013\nAnd in those two days that we stopped in Lisbon, my mother was able to pick up\nthe Mexican visa, and she \u2014 we\u2019re also able to pick up matzos, because this was \u2014\nthis was Passover time. My mother had gotten from the Jewish community there,\nkosher [indecipherable] of food. I have no idea how she carried it though all of\nEurope, especially through Switzerland, because Switzerland forbade you \u2014 one\nof their \u2014 the only th-thing which was forbidden was to take food out of\nSwitzerland. There was plenty of food in Switzerland, but you couldn\u2019t \u2014 you\ncouldn\u2019t export any of it. My mother was able to pull that through, and quite a few\nchocolate bars, which were our salvation, sooner or later.",

Lazaro Cardenas was\nprobably the only world leader which was supporting the republic in Spain. And he\nhad given instructions to all of his consulates, to give a-anybody that walked in, you\ngive him a visa. So, first of all, my father had the la \u2014 legal base to request a visa,\nbut otherwise, you would have gotten a visa as well. They \u2014 they were extraordinary\nliberal.

Luckily there, I \u2014 I saved them, because the German officers were\noccupied with me, because basically, I spoke very good German, and \u2014 and they\nwere fascinated with me. My sister helped me along, but basically it was I who \u2014\nwho they were talking to. A-Again, you know, the \u2014 an unusual situation wa \u2014 since\nthe \u2014 since there \u2014 there was five of us, three a \u2014 three in our family, and this man\nfrom [indecipherable] had somebody else with him.

But we were five in \u2014 in \u2014 1n that compartment, so basically the compartment\nwas for six, but we managed to keep the compartment for us five. So, basically,\ncuriously enough, also the \u2014 the transit visa for Germany was given to us the same\nday. The transit visa from Switzerland wasn\u2019t. The transit visa from southern\nSpain wasn\u2019t. The transit visa to Spain took some time to \u2014 no-no-not as much as\nthe French one, but it took \u2014 and of course, you know, there were things which I\nnoticed. For example, when we were traveling to southern Spain \u2014 southern\nFrance, they came \u2014 people came with paint in Geneva, and they painted over the\nwindows, which we are not supposed to look outside the \u2014 the \u2014 the windows.

Looked at\nmy sister, 14 year old with gold necklace, and some gold armbands, and God\nknows, and they had a few thoughts about that one. But when they saw a gold watch\non me, then when they decided that they weren\u2019t going through, and a lot of this\nwas confiscated at the German border.

And they sent you to an island in the Bay of\nHavana, called Trisko(ph) Onus(ph). It took me a year \u2014 several years, 20, to find\nout that the place was called Trisko(ph) Onus(ph). My mother kept refori \u2014\nreferring to it as Triskonia(ph). We \u2014 we spent, I think two nights on \u2014 on this\nisland, til they processed our papers. And then we were sent to Havana, where we\nstayed for about probably 10 days, because you know, th-the \u2014 the boats were not\nall at the same time, so you had to wait for the arrival of the boat.

        "A: No. There was, but 1-1-1f 1t was, it was among the \u2014 the wealthy there. It \u2014 it was\nagain \u2014 again, a strange place. If you went to the real high, conservative, old\nMexicans, they \u2014 they fell in love with Adolf Hitler. They \u2014 in fact, they used to\nhave oil paintings, and \u2014 of Adolf Hitler in their homes, and oil paintings, which\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 8, 2013\nonce in a while show up in antique shows \u2014 shops today in Mexico. And it was\nstrange, because you know, at \u2014 it \u2014 Hitler used to occupy the place of the Virgin of\nGuadalupe in the home. In other words, the \u2014 his place was above the mantle, and\nwhatever it is. Fortunately, Germans were not \u2014 you know, didn\u2019t think very much\nabout Mexicans, you know, they were just one chain below \u2014 below whatever they\n\u2014 they liked. So, I happen to know a lot of people, and especially in the German\nschool system, at th-that time, before they closed it down. The man who had\nactually run the German school in Budapest was running the German school in \u2014 in\nMexico, and \u2014 and he had been very friendly. As a matter of fact, there was another\ncouple of Jewish boys which had been in Budapest as well, which lived in Mexico,\nand this man wanted us to go \u2014 go \u2014 all go into the German school, because he\nneeded the native German speakers, and couldn\u2019t find them in Mexico. So, my\nmother didn\u2019t want to, and the Mexican government was helpful enough in closing\ndown the \u2014 the German school, because the embassy was \u2014 was playing games. But\nit was amazing to me, because th-the Mexican kids were handled very badly by the\nGermans, you know, with \u2014 no matter what their social condition was, they were\nreally treated like second class citizens. Curiously, we were not. I mean, we were\nthere maybe for a week, or two weeks, or whatever it 1s, but we were not \u2014 not\ntreated like \u2014 like second class citizens at all.May 8, 2013",

        "A: \u2014 which, you know, if you look at it in the \u2014 in \u2014 in the distance, it was strange,\nbecause the \u2014 the man in Mexico City, the ambassador, was a out and out Nazi.\nAnd th-the person in charge of the embassy, who had been somebody living in\nMexico was an out and out Nazi. And he didn\u2019t seem to bother us, but he \u2014 he\nbothered the Mexicans, and the mother \u2014 the mothers used to come crying to the \u2014\nto the director, saying why do you treat my child like that? And they kept sending\nthe children back, instead of taking them out, until the government finally closed\ndown the school, and there was no \u2014 but it was, you know, like the American school\nlater became the place to send your child, the German school were \u2014 for example,\nOctavio Paz, the \u2014 the Mexican diplomat and author went to a ger \u2014 to the German\nschool, to the Alexander von Humboldt school, and so did a lot of intellectuals,\nalong \u2014 in the 1940s, a lot of intellectuals went to the German school.",

        "A: And then there \u2014 there was a que \u2014 a question of whether we would live in\nPueblo, or live in Mexico City, and my mother did the same way. She wouldn\u2019t\nlive in Zylina, and then to live in Budapest, she decided she wasn\u2019t going to live in\nPueblo, and live in Mexico City. So, w-we basically lived in \u2014",

        "A: Well, my sister, first of all, she \u2014 she had only two years to go. And she had \u2014\nshe \u2014 she \u2014 she knew some English. In other words, my \u2014 my mother had \u2014 had\ngotten somebody to try to teach at least my sister English. I was just listening. And\nmy sister spoke reasonably good English, and she wa \u2014 went almost immediately to\nthe American school.\nMay 8, 2013",
        "A: I went to a public school for a while, until my mother was told by everybody that\nshe was getting me just \u2014 lice on me. That, you know, I shouldn\u2019t do this, and I was\ntaken out, and I was put into a\u2014 a\u2014a military school, Mexican Spanish, ru-run by a\nformer Jesuit. And I stayed there til about the sixth grade, seventh grade, and then\nmy sister convinced my mother that I \u2014 I should be educated in the United States,\nso I, in junior \u2014 in junior high school I started going to \u2014 to the American school\nmyself.",
        "A: Well, I'll tell you very truthfully, I \u2014 I-\u2014I didn\u2019t speak for about three or four\nmonths, and then suddenly I broke out spe-speaking Spanish; my sister likewise.\nMy mother, she didn\u2019t speak good Spanish, but she managed. My father was not a\nlinguist. He never quite spoke Spanish, but I was always surprised that the workers\nknew exactly what he wanted. And you know, this was mechanics, too, I mean, he\nexplained to them, you know, a complex piece of equipment, that \u2014 what he wanted\nto do with it. I didn\u2019t understand a word of what he said, but the mechanic knew\nexactly what he \u2014 in other words, everybody seemed to meet halfway. In other\nwords, my father\u2019s Spanish was understood by the \u2014 the Mexicans he was dealing\nwith, but it was \u2014 he \u2014 he managed quite well, actually. He traveled all over the\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 8, 2013\ncountry, and you had to \u2014 you know, you had to buy again, raw material. Wool was\ndifficult to get from Australia, you could get it, but it was the \u2014 difficult those war\nyears.",
        "A: So he \u2014 he used to travel all over Mexico, buying up wool locally, which was\nalso in competition with various existing \u2014 existing companies. It\u2019s \u2014 actually, that\nwas the only \u2014 the only anti-Semitic problem that they had. They had \u2014 there was an\n\u2014 an established Spanish company called Espana Industrial. And they were\nmaking money head over foot, and I mean, they were sending, for about nine\ndollars, something which cost them a dollar to make, or a dollar-fifty to make. And\nmy father, since he knew the trick of using waste, was undercutting them,\nunderselling them, so one day he was called into this Spanish company\u2019s whatever\n\u2014 offices, and was told that either he sold at their same price, or they will put him\nout of business. So my father said, you know what, I\u2019ve \u2014 I\u2019ve just escaped from \u2014\nfrom worse than that, and you know, try, and see who \u2014 who \u2014 who is out of\nbusiness first. They were out of business before we were. I-It\u2019s \u2014 th-th-there was\nlatent anti-Semitism in Latin America. In \u2014 in \u2014 in Argentina, it\u2019s bad. In Mexico\nit was latent. There \u2014 there were some fantastic stories. For example, in Pueblo,\nthere were a lot of Germans. And there was a hotel of all things, called the Ritz, in\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 8, 2013\ndowntown Pueblo. And on Friday nights, the German colony used to close down\nthe \u2014 the hotel\u2019s dining halls, lock the doors. They used to dress themselves up in \u2014\nin Nazi uniforms, and used to sing the Horst Wessel song, and things like that. Real\n\u2014 real Nazi. There was never in \u2014 in Mexico, despite some people who were try to\nmake \u2014 make it up, there was never a \u2014 a real Nazi movement in Mexico, look like\n\u2014 like Argentina, Bolivia, and other places. Th-There \u2014 there was a lot of Nazi\nsympathy, but very, very, very little \u2014 curiously, the Japanese were more active in \u2014\nin \u2014 in\u20141n Mexico. They \u2014 they destroyed several bridges on the western part of\nMexico. They \u2014 our competitor, one of the reasons we were able also to slow him\ndown a little bit is that he had no compunctions of selling to the Japanese, and there\nwere several Japanese submarines that \u2014 that came out to \u2014 to buy his merchandise.\nHe had na \u2014 Americans wouldn\u2019t let him into the United States after the war. And\nbasically, where you used to get machinery, and raw material was the United\nStates, so \u2014 so he had a very serious problem. That helps him \u2014 put him 1\u2014 put him\nout of business. Overt anti-Semitism, you know, actual violence, no.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 8, 2013",
        "A: Well, I\u2014 I1\u2014 we were a little bit lost in the Jewish community, too, because there\nwas a very big German community, it was called Evuno(ph). And there were a lot\nof people who \u2014 who had had troubles with Nazis, especially socialists. The \u2014 the\nformer head of the socialist party in Germany was \u2014 was in Mexico, he \u2014 he\nbecame a photographer, and that\u2019s what he made a living on. But for a while, he\nwas working with the Mexican government, especially with the socialists in\nMexico. But there were a lot of Germans. There was Frank, and the \u2014 Dr. Frank,\nthere was his \u2014 his grandson became health minister in Mexico, and there \u2014 there \u2014\nthere were a lot of \u2014 there \u2014 there were a lot of German Jews there.

And 1-in \u2014 je \u2014 we \u2014 we \u2014 we were \u2014 we were more at ease with the\nGermans than we were with the Poles.",
        "A: My father had learned Polish late \u2014 late in life, and so had my mother. And the\nfew Jews who \u2014 all the \u2014 the Jews that came from Poland were very Poland\noriented, which my father and mother \u2014 they used to go because, you know, it was\none way of socializing. And the Poles had an own \u2014 their own club, and they used\nto get together once a week just to speak Polish. So my mother used to go, my\nfather used to go. But they were uncomfortable there too, because they \u2014 they were\nMay 8, 2013\nnot Poles, they were \u2014 they \u2014 they \u2014 their allegiance was closer to Russian Jewry\nthan they were to Polish Jewry. They were closer to Bialystok Jewry, which was\nnot Polish, but rather Russian. But we \u2014 we mingled with them all. We used to go to\nthe \u2014 to the Ashkenazi shul, the Ashkenazi synagogue in downtown Mexico. Then,\nsince all the Jews left downtown Mexico, they installed themselves not far from\nwhere we lived, maybe 10 or 15 minute walk. And that\u2019s \u2014 we went there for a\nwhile. My father didn\u2019t like it, and curiously, one thing that he \u2014 he didn\u2019t like also,\nwere these Hassidic Jews. But he \u2014 he and the Hassidic Jew bought a property, and\nmade a synagogue for themselves. But it was basically \u2014 you know, my father was a\ntraditionalist. He did beli \u2014 not believe in Orthodoxy, but traditional Orthodoxy.\nThe \u2014 the Hassidim were rather southern \u2014 southern Polish. They came \u2014 most of\nthem came from around Krakow. This man was \u2014 I don\u2019t remember which ra \u2014\nrabbi he was the [indecipherable] of, but the rabbi\u2019s center was Krakow. And\nsouthern Poland and northern Poland at that time, were different worlds. One was\n\u2014had been Austro-Hungary, the other had been Russia, so, you know, they \u2014 they\n\u2014 there was nothing to speak about, but they got along quite well there. And th-they\n\u2014 he liked traditional things, and th \u2014 the Mexican community was \u2014 was torn, it\nwas either Sephardim, or Ashkenazim, and Ashkenazim so often were very\nreligious, some of them were not religious at all.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 8, 2013",

My mother wouldn\u2019t send me to a Jewish school in Mexico\nbecause it was run by Hashomer Hatzair. And you know, as they say, you know,\ntwo Jews make three political parties, and this is a \u2014 this is basically what was\nhappening, it was \u2014 but it was an interesting life, 1t was \u2014 you know, the \u2014 some\npeople were traditional, they \u2014 they \u2014 for example, the park close to the synagogues\nwhere we were, on Saturday morning there were circles of, you know, whatever it\nis, socialists, communists, or \u2014 and they were having all kinds of discussions there,\nit was \u2014 it was \u2014 it was an interesting time to be there.

        "A: Well, my \u2014 my \u2014 I had an uncle. His name was Louie, and he was recruited into\nthe Russian army, a-and the Russians, you know, wanted to convert, and my \u2014 my \u2014\nMay 8, 2013\nmy uncle was not very religious, but he wouldn\u2019t convert. So they \u2014 the tsarist\nofficer gave him every dirty job in \u2014 imaginable, and he took it very kindly, until\nthe day that the officer got really mad, and he horsewhipped him. I mean, there was\nprobably a foot and a half difference between he and the officer, but he grabbed the\nhorsewhip, and started horsewhipping the \u2014 the Russian. Of course, he didn\u2019t even\nstop for a clean shirt at home, he got the \u2014 he went to Konigsburg, from\nKonigsburg he went to London. He lived in England for four or five years, and\nthen he moved to the United States. But the \u2014 the memory stayed with the Russian\narmy, and \u2014 and you had to conscript yourself into the army. The only way that you\ncould get yourself out of the army is if you were an only son, or there were no \u2014 no\n\u2014no other \u2014 well, only son, meaning that if \u2014 if there were no other children, or the\nother siblings were women, you could be exempt from military service. So my\nfather did this, he had a \u2014 a cousin by the name of Efron, who had two daughters.\nSo when he had to go into the army, and he figured that he wasn\u2019t going to be\ntreated very well, and he didn\u2019t want to go \u2014 I mean, let\u2019s be honest about it, he had\nhimself apar \u2014 adopted by this Efron.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 8, 2013",

        "A: Well, we all \u2014 we all basically found out about 1944, when I think the \u201cNew\nYork Times\u201d published a whole story. But it wasn\u2019t only that, but you know, there\nhad been an awful lot of deportations, and these deported people never showed up\nagain. Of course, after the war, everybody started looking for \u2014 for everybody, and\nthey found that there was nobody left, practically. We know that my aunt, uncle and\ncousin, were deported to Treblinka. It sounds like my cousin was killed before he\never got to Treblinka, because there was a \u2014 there \u2014 the people who \u2014 who took the\n\u2014 who were put on the train from Bialystok to Treblinka, were \u2014 there was a\nMay 8, 2013\nrebellion, and I think my cousin was involved in that. After the rebellion, they were\nmade to walk to the \u2014 the rest of the distance, which was not \u2014 not \u2014 not a \u2014 in the\n[indecipherable] considerable amount of \u2014 and a lot of people didn\u2019t make it. But it\nseems my cousin was \u2014 was \u2014 was killed before \u2014 before. But my aunt and uncle\nwere \u2014 the rest of my family managed to survive, because they were in Russia.",
        "A: Or, they had left Poland. I mean, basically, my father was the sole support of his\nfather, and the sister, who was the mother of my cousin, and a brother who didn\u2019t\nstay very long, he \u2014 he helped my father for about 10 years, and then he went to the\nUnited States about 1912 or \u201913, or something like that.

        "A: But I don\u2019t know, we \u2014 we \u2014 we were very adventurous sor-sorts. I think one of\nmy aunts had a child, and she decided that, you know, the child should be a rabbi.\nBut how can he be a rabbi in \u2014 in the [indecipherable]? He had to be a rabbi in\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMay 8, 2013\nIsrael. So she \u2014 one day, she disappeared. Her husband didn\u2019t know where she\nwent, nobody knew where she went. Years later, somebody said that they had seen\nher in Jerusalem. And as a\u2014 we \u2014 we have \u2014 we have some very, very \u2014 well, you\nknow, the \u2014 it was an adventure to be a Jew, and people were very adventurous.",
        "A: We had \u2014 even my father\u2019s oldest brother, who was a rabbi, first went to\nSweden. Couldn\u2019t make a living being a rabbi. Put up a hat factory, and I think\nwouldn\u2019t make a \u2014 a living with that either, so he went to the United States, and the\nUnited States, his wife didn\u2019t like it. So he went to \u2014 to \u2014 to Israel. And he lived\nquite well there. He \u2014 he \u2014 he \u2014 he was one of the founders of the Bezalel\nmovement, of the art movement, and he was the \u2014 he became an antiquarian.",

And my \u2014 my \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the last one, the cousin, anyway, she \u2014 she \u2014\nshe had also a very strange life. But she left me some of the stuff that she had in \u2014 in\n\u2014 in the store, and she \u2014 she had a lot of stuff, she \u2014 she ha \u2014 she was a specialist in\nreal Ottoman art, and she was considered one of the top specialists in Ottoman art.\nShe was also slightly nuts.\nMay 8, 2013",

My father, later on helped some of the technicians that he had at the\nfactory move to Canada in 1956. And you know, it became \u2014 after \u2014 after \u2014 after\nthe war, everybody was helping everybody. For example, my father sis \u2014 this rule\nthat you had to have 20,000 dollars for a family, or 10,000 for an individual, people\nthat had it, th-they recycled this money. In other words, there were \u2014 there were,\nyou know, they were presenting as if this man had 20,000 dollars, you see. Only\nwanted to see the deposit, and that was it, it was \u2014 they showed the deposit, the \u2014\nthe money went to somebody else, or \u2014 so, you know, the \u2014 the \u2014 there was a\u2014a\nreally \u2014 I wouldn\u2019t call it an underground movement, but an over-ground movement\nto \u2014 to meet the legal \u2014 the legal restrictions.
