        "Question: This is the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with\nGeorge Pick, conducted by Gail Schwartz on November 13\", 1997 in Arlington,\nVirginia. This interview is part of the museum\u2019s project to interview Holocaust\nsurvivors and witnesses who are also volunteers with the museum. This is tape\nnumber one, side A. Could you give us your full name?",
        "Answer: My name is George Steven Pick, p-i-c-k.",
        "Q: Is that the name you were born with?",
        "A: The first name 1s Anglicized. The original name was Gyorgy, but I changed it\nwhen I became a citizen because nobody could spell it and pronounce it. George is\nan equivalent English version of Gyorgy, which was my name.",
        "Q: And your family name was Pick?",
        "A: My family name was Pick, correct.",
        "Q: And where were you born, and when were you born?",
        "A: Yes, I was born in Budapest, Hungary, in March 28, 1934.",
        "Q: Now let\u2019s talk a little bit about your family. How long had they been in that\narea?",
        "A: My family\u2019s history had been quite intertwined with the Austro-Hungarian\nempire\u2019s history. I have records which shows that my family was in Hungary for at\nleast 250 years. I have actual birth certificates and \u2014 and other do \u2014 documents\nNovember 13, 1997\nwhich document this. And I had a very large family. I did a little bit of genealogical\nresearch. It showed that I had roughly 250 family members in the empire. And I am\nsaying this because when the empire broke up after this first World War, my family\nsort of stayed to \u2014 stayed in the geographical locations they were, but all of a\nsudden they were citizens of three different countries, Czechoslovakia, Hungary\nand Austria. And some of my relatives also lived in Transylvania, so they became\nRomanian. And this was the situation between the two wars. We were a fairly\nclosely knit family. People were keeping in touch with each other. And I know, for\nexample, of what my great-grandparents did. One was on my father\u2019s side, a\nphysician. And the other one on my father\u2019s side was a merchant, an importer, who\nimported mostly fruits and spices. My grand \u2014 great-grandparents on my mother\u2019s\nside, one owned a lumberyard, and the second one was a lawyer. And so I have\nquite a bit of \u2014 of information about them. My grandparents of \u2014 my maternal\ngrandfather was an engineer, a mechanical engineer. Worked as chief engineer of a\n\u2014 of a factory in Hungary, and my grandmother was a housewife. My other\ngrandfather was a director of a lumber company. My father was a \u2014 an engineer and\nmy mother was a paralegal secretary. So that\u2019s the background. I am an only child, I\nhad no brothers or sisters. I have a number of cousins, I have a \u2014",
        "Q: What are your parents\u2019 names?\nNovember 13, 1997",
        "A: My father\u2019s original name was Istvan, which is translated roughly to Steven,\nand my mother\u2019s name was Margit, which is Margaret; that\u2019s what she Anglicized\nher name to when she came to this country.",
        "Q: And her maiden name?",
        "A: Her maiden name was Kornhauser, and that\u2019s her father\u2019s name. Her mother\u2019s\nmaiden name was Spitzer(ph). And my grandmother on my father\u2019s side, her\nmaiden name was Augenfeld(ph).",
        "Q: And you said your father was an engineer, what kind of engineer?",
        "A: He was a\u2014a mechanical engineer, and he worked for a short time as such.\nBecause of some of the Jewish laws, which came into effect in the late 30s, early\n40s, he lost his job in January of 1939.",
        "Q: Yeah, we-we\u2019ll get to that in a moment, yeah. All right, you are born, you said,\nin 1934. Did \u2014 was your family living in the center of the city, or whereabouts?",
        "A: Well, my family lived in Buda, which is the other side of the \u2014 the Danube\nriver, and we lived there until I think I was about six or seven, and then we moved\nto Pest, my father, mother and I.",
        "Q: Do you have any memories of Buda, living in Buda?",
        "A: Yes, Buda is a very \u2014 very nice hilly section of the city. We lived near a\u2014a\nlarge square, where \u2014 and a \u2014 and a hill, Gell\u00e9rt hill. And my mother took me, when\nNovember 13, 1997\nI was a child, walking there to both the \u2014 the hill and the square. And I \u2014 I do\nremember very well the \u2014 th-the area.",
        "Q: Was this a Jewish neighborhood?",
        "A: No, it was not. There was a Jewish neighborhood in Pest, but not in Buda. And\nwe did \u2014 we were very \u2014 we were not very religious. We were fairly \u2014 we \u2014 we were\nreally \u2014",
        "Q: Assimilated?",
        "A: Yeah, assimilated, I could say. And were not very conscious of \u2014 of living in a\nJewish neighborhood, although we \u2014 we know that we are Jews, of course.",
        "Q: Did your family have any kind of religious observance?",
        "A: I th \u2014 we \u2014 we observed the high holidays, but that was about it. My father\u2019s side\nof the family had a number of people who were \u2014 who married non-Jews, and they\nwere, I would say, completely non-observant of any religion. A few of them had\nconverted before the war, but most of them stayed Jewish, but were \u2014 were\ncompletely secular, I would say.",
        "Q: Do you think you knew you were Jewish by the time you were six \u2014 up to the\ntime you were six?",
        "A: It\u2019s an interesting story. When I was about four or five years old, my mother\ntook me to a little gymnasium. The gymnasium, in an English sense, was in a\nNovember 13, 1997\nJewish high school, and we went there once a week. And the teacher was Jewish,\nand it was a little bit of a physical education type thing. And on the corner, just\nacross the street from this high school, there was a \u2014 a Catholic church. And I\nalways insisted that we should go into this church, because I liked the way people\nwere \u2014 were praying there. My mother didn\u2019t say anything, and we went there.\nHowever, on \u2014 by age six, my mother enrolled me into a Jewish elementary school,\nand by then I knew very well that I was Jewish. I was also sort of forced into the\nreality of being Jewish after my father lost his job and he told me that he lost it\nbecause we were Jews.",
        "Q: What language did you speak at home?",
        "A: Well, we spoke German, mostly my mother and father and grandparents. I would\nsay they did, I didn\u2019t. And they spoke it because they didn\u2019t want me to understand\ncertain things. I was taught German when I was in kindergarten, and I spoke fairly\nwell for a few years, but then I\u2019ve completely forgotten it. Hungarian was the main\nlanguage, essentially.",
        "Q: Was your father, or your parents in any way Zionists?",
        "A: They were not. They were not Zionists at all. There was a \u2014I had an uncle who\ncame to the United States in the late 30s and he first wanted us to come, and sent\npapers. This was in 1940. Hungary was a neutral country until June of \u201941, so\nNovember 13, 1997\npeople could theoretically at least, leave the country. My uncle, who was a\nphysician when he emigrated, brought \u2014 took our papers and sent us some\naffidavits, but my father was very reluctant. He \u2014 he didn\u2019t want to start again, and\nthe un \u2014 my uncle was fairly discouraging as far as the possibilities of employment,\nbecause on \u2014 he was telling my father that he would be sort of a tradesman, maybe a\nmechanic. Well, my father was an engineer and a businessman and he didn\u2019t want\nto step down the ladder, so we didn\u2019t do anything. Then in 1940, he offered my\nmother that he would adopt me, and that he would take me, but my mother declined\nthat offer. So, because of that, I got stuck in Hungary with my parents, of course.",
        "Q: When was the first time that you remember hearing the name Hitler? Granted,\nyou were very young in the 30s. Do you have any memories up til 1939 of your\nparents talking about this man, or what was happening, how conditions were\nchanging?",
        "A: I have very vivid memories in 1938 of Hitler, because Hitler speeches were\nbroadcast in the radio, and I remember this frightening voice, and \u2014 and his yelling\nand screaming, and \u2014",
        "Q: And you were only four and a half.",
        "A: Correct, but I remember it very vividly because it was frightening me. I mean, I\ndidn\u2019t understand the language, but the way he spoke was \u2014 was very frightening.\nNovember 13, 1997",
        "Q: Did you say anything to your parents, or do you remember them comforting\nyou?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember them comforting me, I think I \u2014 I said to my parents that \u2014 that\nthis man was a very frightening person, the way he spoke. And we had [coughing]\nexcuse me \u2014 we had a prime minister at the time who was also a great anti-Semite,\nand I remember \u2014 well, I don\u2019t remember the \u2014 the speeches, but I do remember the\nkinds of \u2014 of expressions he \u2014 he \u2014 he used, which again, were \u2014 were frightening to\nme, although I was only a youngster. I was a fairly precocious child and I was well\naware of some of the politic \u2014 political figures, Churchill, Roosevelt, Hitler and all\nthis. And in fact, it was a sort of a joke in the family that people always ask me, you\nknow, who was the Prime Minister of England, or who was the president of\nAmerica, or whatever else, and I always knew the answer, even when I was in\nkindergarten. So I was sort of regarded as a smart kid, and I \u2014 I was more aware,\nprobably, than an average four or five years old, about what was happening.",
        "Q: Okay, let\u2019s move now to 1939. Is that the year you said your father lost his job?",
        "A: Yeah. In main of \u2014 May of \u201939, when the second Jewish law came into effect,\nmy father lost his job, but 1t was more than that, because that particular law, also\nallowed what they called people who were not trustworthy for the government.\nThey allowed the government to induct them into labor brigades. And of course,\nNovember 13, 1997\nthese groups included communists and Jews. And because of that, a number of my\nuncles, and among them, my father as well, was impacted very shortly. Actually,\n1940, my father was inducted into a labor brigade. And they took him to\nCarpathia-Ruthenia, which at that time was already occupied by Hungary. And\nthey sent him to build roads, strategic roads in that area.",
        "Q: When did you say he was taken away\u201d",
        "A: This \u2014 this was in \u2014 in September of 1940, 1940. And \u2014",
        "Q: What did he do between the time he lost his job, and being taken away?",
        "A: Okay, between the time he lost his job and being taken away, many Jews figured\na way to go around the \u2014 the laws. According to the laws, which were designed to\nsqueeze the Jews out of the economic life of Hungary, a Jew could not practice\nbusiness. But what they did, what the Jews did is they hired a Christian person who\nwould then take out the business license, and they would work under him. And in\nour building where we lived, there was a super by name of George Dudek(ph) who\nwas a very kind man. He was a friend of my f-father\u2019s, and he volunteer \u2014 he \u2014 he\nessentially agreed with my father that he would take out the license, and of course\nmy father paid him a stipend, and under this \u2014 with this arrangement, my father was\nable to \u2014 to do that \u2014 some business. Now, when I talk about business, it was not a f\n\u2014 it was not a formal store. What \u2014 what they have done, and this is a fairly\nNovember 13, 1997\ninteresting story, is they \u2014 they went to coffeehouses, and they met there Jews and\nnon-Jews and they made business essentially on a handshake [indecipherable] and\nthey sold them both things. My father, being an engineer was more familiar with\nengineering materials, so he \u2014 he sold scrap iron, scrap materials and bought \u2014\nbought them as well. And he had some partners who were \u2014 and business partners\nwho were both Christian and Jew, and that\u2019s how he essentially made a living. And\nbet \u2014 and after \u00b039, he has done that for \u2014 for quite awhile. As you see, he came\nback after the 1940 induction, and then he was inducted another time. But between\n1939 and 1944, he was home most of the time, and when he was home, he was\ndoing this, he was practicing business.",
        "Q: When you were very young, did you have non-Jewish friends?",
        "A: I did. I remember one, I don\u2019t remember his name. My grandparents had a little\nhome \u2014 a little home, a little yard and a \u2014 a small bungalow, about 20 miles from\nBudapest, which we used, as well as some of my other relatives for summer \u2014 a\nsummer cottage. And I remember in 1940 particularly in the summer of \u201940, we\nwent there. My mother and I stayed there for maybe a month, and my father came\nout on the weekends and we had some \u2014 I had some next door neighbors, little mini-\nfarms, and kids came over, peasant children, and the \u2014 we played. And there was\nabsolutely no talk about whether you were Jewish or you were not, they were just\nNovember 13, 1997\nfriends. And \u2014 and as I said, I had a number of them from that \u2014 it was a little\nvillage called Gerdaler(ph) and we had a next door neighbor, was a Serbian couple,\nand we were very friendly with them, and some others, also. The building we lived\nin in Pest had a few children. In fact, our next door neighbor had two girls, and the\nnext door neighbor was a professional soldier. He was a \u2014 a \u2014 an officer in the army.\nAnd I was extremely friendly with their kids. I was \u20141f I wasn\u2019t home, I was there,\nand they sort of regarded me as \u2014 as a family member. When there was Christmas,\nthey had a little gift for me under the Christmas tree. And I have a number of\npictures with the \u2014 with the two girls. One was my age, and the other was a couple\nof years younger. The next neighbor next door was also very friendly. They \u2014 they\nhad a \u2014 a girl who was my age as well. And the three girls and myself, we were\nalmost inseparable friends in the age four to seven or eight, even up to 10. And\nagain, there was very little, to me, was very little awareness of \u2014 of what\u2019s the\ndifference between a Jew and a non-Jew.",
        "Q: So you\u2019re saying you didn\u2019t experience any anti-Semitic remarks at that time,\nduring that interval?",
        "A: I\u2014I wouldn\u2019t say that. What I was saying 1s that I did have non-Jewish friends.\nWe had a number of anti-Semites in the building. And there was one incident which\nI remember very vividly. There was a teacher, who was a \u2014 quite an anti-Semite and\nNovember 13, 1997\nhe disliked me and I disliked him also, and once he asked me something, and I sort\nof a smart-alecky answer and he gave me a big slap on the face. And I \u2014 that was\nthe first time I have ever ha-had \u2014 even my parents didn\u2019t do things like that to me,\nand I was very upset. And the interesting end of this story was that a couple of years\n\u2014 couple of days later, this fellow came over and apologized to me that he did this,\nthat he shouldn\u2019t have. But I know that his feelings were not very friendly. But he \u2014",
        "Q: Do you think that\u2019s because you were Jewish?",
        "A: I am almost positive that that was the case, that because I was Jewish.",
        "Q: How do you know that?",
        "A: Well, I think he was a member of some sort of a Hungarian Nazi party. And he\nwas certainly \u2014 he was the warden, the air raid warden there, and he was very gung-\nho on \u2014 on the war. This was the first year of the war, when this whole thing\nhappened, in 1941, and I know that he was \u2014 he was nationalist at least. But I\u2014I-I\nalways had the feeling that he was also an anti-Semite.",
        "Q: What was it like for you as a young child to have your father tell you that he lost\nhis job, his work, because he was Jewish? Do you remember what your reaction\nwas at the time?",
        "A: Well, I \u2014 I don\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t remember what my reaction was, but I remember\nwhen he lost his job. I do not recall whether it was a panic time or not. But he has\nNovember 13, 1997\nlost his job many times during the \u2014 the depression, and he always found something\nto do, and somehow to make a living. He was a man who could make a living on a \u2014\nin Antarctica probably as well. He was a very ingenious person.",
        "Q: So you don\u2019t remember feeling particularly threatened in 1939 because you were\nJewish?",
        "A: I did not feel threatened economically, but as I said, I had this \u2014 I mean, I heard\nHitler and I heard the prime minister of Hungary speak and yell. I certainly was\nfrightened by this. Maybe I was not completely conscious as to what could happen.\nBut just the \u2014 the voices were disturbing.",
        "Q: What kind of relationship did you have with your parents? Was it a very close\none, did you feel you could talk to them?",
        "A: My relationship with my parents at this time was close to my mother and not\nvery close to my father. My father was a fairly cold person. He was not a kind of a\nperson who would \u2014 would color, or who would tell me that he loves me, or\nsomething. And he was not a kind of a person who would want to take me to places.\nThere was always a great disagreement between my mother and father as to how to\nbra \u2014 how to bring me up. My father felt that my mother was coddling me too\nmuch. He called it a monkey love, and he wanted to make a man out of me, and he\nfelt that I was just too soft. And over the years, this \u2014 this translated into a \u2014 a fairly\nNovember 13, 1997\ndistant relationship between myself and my father. Even later in my years, I \u2014 he\nfelt that I\u2014I just did not meet his expectations in terms of physical prowess. My\nfamily, particularly my father\u2019s family had a number of gymnastic champions and \u2014\nand great sportsmen. My uncle was an Olympic \u2014 he was a European champion of\ngymnastics and seven times Hungarian champion. And both my aunt and my uncle\non my father\u2019s side were attending the Los Angeles Olympics. My uncle also went\nto the Amsterdam Olympics and Stockholm Olympics as a \u2014 as a part of the\nOlympic team of Hungary. And with that, of course, with that kind of competition,\nno, I was \u2014 was not able to compete. My father was, in his younger days, pretty\nphysically active. In his 40s he was not as active as he was earlier. But he expected\nme to follow his footsteps and his brother\u2019s footstep, who was a \u2014 a great skier and\nmountain climber, and I was never able to fulfill these kind of things, so he sort of\ngave up on me on that.",
        "Q: Now you said that your family moved away. Was it in 1939, from Buda to Pest.\nWhy did they move?",
        "A: If Iremember correctly, in Buda they lived with my mother \u2014 maternal\ngrandparents. This was right after they got married, and they really could not afford\nto live apart. In the late 30s, they had improved the financial conditions where my\nfather beg \u2014 was working for a couple of years there, and I guess they were able to\nNovember 13, 1997\nafford to move away. They didn\u2019t want to move into a very expensive\nneighborhood, first they moved into a \u2014 a fairly low \u2014 middle class neighborhood.\nBut then later, in 1940, me \u2014 we moved into an upper class place in \u2014 in Buda \u2014 in\nPest, in \u2014 which at that point was sort of considered a suburbs.",
        "Q: And when did you start school?",
        "A: I started school in September of 1940, and I went to a Jewish elementary school.\nIt\u2019s called the Jewish Boys\u2019 Orphanage, but it was not just an orphanage, it was an\nelementary school for other children. And it wasn\u2019t even for boys only, it was a\ncoed school. So we had about 30 students, I guess 20 boys and 10 girls.",
        "Q: Why did you go to a Jewish school?",
        "A: Well, there were several reasons for that. One of it is that school was considered\nvery good, and at that point I think my parents became aware that I should be more\naware of my \u2014 my Jewishness. And so they decided that this was a\u2014 a good school\nfor me. And indeed it was. I had met children, both girls and boys, who were \u2014\nessentially who became lifelong friends. In fact, I still have a number of them here\nin this country, whom I known since age six from first elementary school. And so it\nwas a\u2014a-\u2014a great bond, as it turned out. We had a great teacher Arn(ph)\nMagda(ph) who was a\u2014 a young woman at the time. And I remember the school as\na very friendly school, and as a very friendly place to \u2014 to go to. I also remember\nNovember 13, 1997\nthat my mother took me every ni \u2014 every day. The school was about a half an hour\nwalking distance from where li \u2014 where we lived. And I always woke up late.\nActually, my mother didn\u2019t have the heart to wake me up early enough, so that we\nended up running all the time. And \u2014 and she \u2014 I remember very well that she\nalways had my \u2014 hand my \u2014 held my hand, and we ran through this city park to get\nto the school. And I also remember the other teachers, other than just Arn(ph)\nMagda(ph).",
        "Q: In the early 40s, did you \u2014 or even in late 30s, did you notice any refugees from\nother countries coming to Budapest? Jews from Germany, Poland, Austria?",
        "A: Yes. Actually, they were some of my relatives who were able \u2014 there was one\nuncle, his name was Gustie \u2014 Gustav. He lived in Vienna, and after the anschluss\nhe was arrested, and they took him to Dachau. And for \u2014 and I am not sure and I\ndon\u2019t remember how, but after about a year and a half in Dachau, he was let go,\nand he managed to slip over the border to Hungary, and became an illegal alien.\nAnd I remember him very well. He \u2014 we used to have a family gathering in my\nmatern \u2014 paternal grandmother\u2019s and grandfather\u2019s house. They had a little house,\nand it was a family tradition that we got together every Sunday afternoon. My\ncousins, my aunts, uncles and ourselves. And I remember Uncle Gustie came at that\ntime and he was telling us stories about the camp, and his life. And we sort of didn\u2019t\nNovember 13, 1997\nbelieve him very much. He was a very nice man. I didn\u2019t realize it until after the\nwar that he was a multimillionaire who at the end did not survive, and who left all\nhis houses for nobody. Ma \u2014 on my mother\u2019s side, there were several great-aunts\nand children and \u2014 who lived in Bratislava. And I remember Ileanor(ph) and her \u2014\nher 16 year old boy Garbore(ph) and her husband, they were able to slip across the\nDanube in 1942. And they lived again as illegal refugees in Hungary. We, between\n1942 and 1944 were able to hide them. It will \u2014 this follows, we had a fairly large\nfamily in Budapest. They \u2014 every night they slept somewhere else. And so every\nweek or week and a half, we were the ones who were hiding them, and my mother\nand grandmother were particularly fairly nervous when they slept in our house. Had\n\u2014 they had some papers, but they were not very good.",
        "Q: Was this nervousness conta-contagious? You were eight and nine years old when\nthis was going on, and if so, how did it manifest itself?",
        "A: Nervousness was contagious in a sense that I was aware that these people were \u2014\nwere illegals, that they came out of horrible things. We knew about the ghetto.",
        "Q: How did you know?",
        "A: Well, they were telling us about the ghetto, they were there, and the \u2014 and that\npeople went into hiding, into forests, and also the \u2014 that they were di \u2014 taken away.",
        "Q: All this was believed?\nNovember 13, 1997",
        "A: All this was not believed very much. We \u2014 we didn\u2019t think they were lying, but\nwe certainly didn\u2019t think that it could happen to us. And so, although we were\nnervous about their status, and we obviously were family, and we helped them as\nmuch. There was, for example, one uncle who \u2014 who was a very nice guy. He was \u2014\nhis name was Louie, and he was a very religious Catholic al \u2014 although he was not\nborn Catholic, he was a Jew who converted. And he was a great family man, and he\nwas the one who got false papers to these people. Somebody \u2014 and I do not know\nwho and why and how, betrayed him, and he went to jail for six months, because he\nnot only helped the relatives, he helped other people in getting false papers. At that\ntime, there were approximately 10,000 Polish and che \u2014 Czechoslovakian Jews\nliving illegally in ha \u2014- in Hungary. Hungary at that time was regarded as some sort\nof a haven, a safe haven for \u2014 for Jews. Again, the Hungarian government sort of\nknew about their existence and tolerated them, but that they were still illegal and\nthey had very little possibilities of \u2014 of doing anything. They couldn\u2019t work, they\nwere essentially charity cases for the \u2014 for their families.",
        "Q: In 1942 and 1943, did you notice any rise 1n anti-Semitic incidents on the street,\nor to you personally?",
        "A: Yes. The \u2014 in 1943, there was an interesting incident, which really brought home\nthe frightening reality. My father was \u2014 as I mentioned, my father was inducted in\nNovember 13, 1997\n1940 to Carpathia-Ruthenia working on strategic roads. He was let go three\nmonths later, and in 1943, he was inducted again. This time he was taken to Kluge,\nTransylvania. Koloszvar, which is a \u2014 was again, part of the occupied territories\nby Hungary. He was doing some roadwork there as well. We visited him, because\nwe had some relatives who lived there, in Kluge, and we the \u2014 I remember very\nwell that he was quite lucky, because his commander was a decent man. His name\nwas Andoor(ph) Altoi(ph), and he was a very humane person. He recognized this\nwhole thing as being really ludicrous. And they \u2014 the \u2014 the men were able to, for\nexample, organize groups. Some of them we \u2014 more well-to-do men paid money\ninto a fund to get furloughs, and that money went to the families of the destitute.\nAnd the \u2014 the man who ran, Altoi(ph) who ran this \u2014 this brigade, this labor brigade\nallowed this to happen, and he did not allow the lower, non-com officers to \u2014 to hit\nthe Jews or \u2014 or \u2014 or do any kind of inhumane things. So in that respect, my father\nwas quite lucky in that. After he was deactivated, which was in the summer of 1942\n\u2014 three \u2014",
        "Q: Let\u2019s back up. What\u2019s it like for a nine year old to see his father in a \u2014 you know,\ntaken away and having to do this kind of work?",
        "A: Well, we had a family tradition, we never went to \u2014 to the railroad station. We\nalways said goodbye at home. And it was a very traumatic experience, of course, he\nNovember 13, 1997\n\u2014 I remember his rucksack, his \u2014 his thing, he carried his things with him and he\nbought good shoes and things. And it was \u2014 we were always terribly distraught,\nbecause of course, we never knew how long my father would be taken, or if we\nwould ever see him again. It never \u2014 1t\u2019s sad, you know, you are inducted, and you\nhave to go to such and such a place within 48 hours. But we never knew what his\ndestination was. And then, of course, when we heard from him, when he was taken\nto a\u2014to Transylvania, it took roughly a month before we knew where he was.\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\ninterview of George Pick. This is tape number one, side B, and you were talking\nabout when you would say goodbye to your father at the railroad station. And then\nyou had also mentioned \u2014 when he was taken away \u2014 and then you had also\nmentioned that you and your mother came to visit him one time, and I was just\nasking what it was like for a young boy to see his father in that position.",
        "A: Yes, as I mentioned to you, our \u2014 our family tradition was that we were not \u2014 we\n\u2014 we never went to the railroad station, we said goodbye at home and then he went\nto the railroad station himself. I \u2014 I like to step back in time, in 1942, because it was\nvery important and a very traumatic one. In April of \u201942, when 50,000 Hungarian\nNovember 13, 1997\nJewish slave laborer servicemen were inducted, men between the ages of 18 and 40\nwere inducted and they were taken to Ukraine. Among these were three of my\nuncles. My moth \u2014 my father was lucky because he was one year too old to be\ninducted, but my three uncles weren\u2019t. And I want to mention that there was a very\nlarge catastrophe which happened to them as well as to the 50,000, as well as\n200,000 Hungarian army personnel in January of 1943. There was an offensive in\nthe middle of the f \u2014 winter in the Don \u2014 bend of the Don river in the Ukraine,\nwhere the Soviet army had a counteroffensive and they \u2014 in six days they wiped out\n200,000 Hungarian army men, and 50,000 Jewish slave laborers; among them, two\nof my uncles died.",
        "Q: What were their names?",
        "A: Their name was \u2014 one was Bondi(ph) Kornhauser, and the other one was\nYanu(ph) Pick. And two of my other uncles, Lazlo Kornhauser and Lazlo Pick\nsurvived. We did not know that they did, but \u2014 but in fact, they did. And they came\nhome about a year and a half later, but the other ones died. And many friends whom\nwe knew who went, did not come back at that point. So I wanted to mention that. I\nalso wanted to mention that we found out late in 1942 that the German government\nasked the Hungarian government to implement the Final Solution in budap \u2014 in\nHungary, and the Hungarian government refused at that point. And this, of course,\nNovember 13, 1997\nwas a\u2014 was a great relief for us, and we really believed that the Hungarian\ngovernment is \u2014 is not going to let us go. We did not know what happened to the\nrest of \u2014 of European Jews. We were completely ignorant. And it is interesting\nbecause my father and I and my mother listened to the BBC every day, and there\nwas very \u2014 there was a lot of news about the war, how the war went, and I\nremember very well that we had a big map at home, and my father had pins, red\npins and white pins and we always looked at the \u2014 th-the map, and they were telling\nus where the \u2014 the offensives were, or what kind of battles, and my father was a\u2014 a\nvivid follower of all this. And there was a Hungarian speaking colonel on BBC,\nwho spoke not very good Hungarian, very accented Hungarian, but he was the \u2014 the\nwar correspondent, and he was the one who talked about all this, and we were very\n\u2014 very much listening to what was happening. There was no word, to my\nknowledge, which said anything about camps, or labor camps or deportation, or\nwhat happened to the Jews. Was very little, or nothing, nothing to my recollection.\nAnd in 1943 when \u2014 when this [indecipherable] breakthrough occurred, was a\ngreat sadness in Hungary. And I think that even the Jews, of course, felt sad\nbecause they knew how many Jews were killed. And as I mentioned, my next door\nneighbor was a \u2014 was an army officer, and my father and they \u2014 and he very often\nspoke about the \u2014 how the war was going. Now Hungary, of course, was a Nazi\nNovember 13, 1997\nally, and I \u2014 today I \u2014 I \u2014 to-today I\u2014 I\u2014I wonder, you know, this man, he really\nhad a great amount of goodwill, because he could denounce my father. I mean, my\nfather was trying to convince him that the Germans lost the war in 1943, and in the\nbeginning of \u00b044. And this man, of course he di \u2014 he \u2014 he \u2014 he talked to my father,\nbut I mean, this was a very dangerous thing my father was doing, and this man was\nreally decent enough not to \u2014 not to do anything. On the other hand, I remember\nanother man who lived in our building, who was a commander of a Jewish brigade,\nwho took this Jewish brigade to the Ukraine. And when he came home on furlough,\nhe was very proud of the fact that among his Jewish slave laborers, there were a\nnumber of extremely Orthodox Hassidim whose beard he personally cut and shaved\nand taught them the delights of eating pork. And this man, by name of Drexell(ph),\nhe was \u2014 Drexler(ph) rather, he was very proud of this.",
        "Q: What was his first name?",
        "A: I\u2014I do not remember his first name, but I remember his last name. and he was\nmuch frightened after the war, because he knew that he made all these statements,\nand he was particularly frightened when he \u2014 when we returned, and he thought we\nwould denounce him; we did not. Going back to 1943, my father was deactivated,\nand after that we went to a \u2014 take a \u2014 a week \u2014 one week vacation to the mountains.\nAnd it was a \u2014a luxury hotel, and Jews were allowed to go there. There was only\nNovember 13, 1997\none hotel, which was not open to Jews, which was open to army personnel, army\nofficers actually. And it was a beautiful summer and we enjoyed ourselves very\nmuch. One afternoon, my mother and I took a walk in the woods. And there, in the\nwoods, we saw a large group of men in Nazi uniforms. They were the Hungarian\nNazis, called the Nyilas, and they had the rally there. And that was the first time we\nreally saw these people, and they were yelling and screaming and we were really\nfrightened. And we sort of managed to slip away, but \u2014 but this really sort of banged\nreality to our consciousness in terms of \u2014 well, here these people, we \u2014 we thought\nthese people were underground wi \u2014 they were e \u2014 theoretically illegal, they were\nnot allowed. Their leader was in jail, but yet they were organizing and they were\nmeeting in these places out in the mountains, in faraway places from Budapest, and\n\u2014 and we became more aware that these people were real. I mean, we \u2014 we \u2014 we\nknew the propaganda, we knew that these people existed, but this was my firsthand\nencounter with them.",
        "Q: What\u2019s it like to see someone in a uniform like that when you\u2019re nine years old?",
        "A: Well, it was quite frightening. We \u2014 we understood, and I understood what the\nuniform stood for, and \u2014",
        "Q: How did you understand? You\u2019re nine years old.\nNovember 13, 1997",
        "A: Well, I have seen a lot of propaganda leaflets, and they have, all over the city\nthey had these \u2014 these big propaganda photographs and \u2014 about the war effort and\nhow the \u2014 these people look in SS uniform, how did the Hungarian uniform look\nand how did this Hungarian Nazi uniform look. Particularly the one which we were\nwell aware is the armband which they wore, which were red and white stripes with\na \u2014a large Arrow Cross in the middle, green Arrow Cross. And we \u2014 we were \u2014 we\nrecognized that. And as I said, it\u2019s just the way they behaved was frightening\nenough and what they were yelling, slogans, all this kind of things. They were\nmostly nationalistic and racial slogans, and they were yelling slogans, you know,\ndeath to the Jews and all that. And of course that was quite, even at age nine, it was\nquite clear to me that these people were not our friends.",
        "Q: And how did your parents interpret this to you?",
        "A: Well, we didn\u2019t talk very much about it. I knew that my mother was very\nfrightened, and we sort of left, and we tried to sort of not to speak about this. We\nthought \u2014 we didn\u2019t ignore it, because I remember it, but we did not want to \u2014 she\ndidn\u2019t want to emphasize that, look, these people are terrible, and we are going to\nhave terrible times. We really hoped at that point that the war is turning, that we\nwill be able to survive. That before anything would happen, the war would be over.",
        "Q: So it\u2019s 1942 - \u201943, and you are still going to this Jewish school?\nNovember 13, 1997",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And then what is the next big change that you remember?",
        "A: Well, the \u2014 the \u2014 the next big change, what I remember was that in 19 \u2014 end of\n1943, beginning of 1944, my mother decided that I am now old enough to learn a\nlittle bit about music and culture. And next door we had a lady who happens to be\nJewish \u2014 happened to be Jewish, and who was a violin teacher. And we went there \u2014\nactually it was maybe 1943 when I started violin lessons. And I never got too far,\nbut what I did get out of it was a love of music. And I remember that in 1943, my\nmother decided that we were going to buy some season\u2019s tickets for a musical and\nopera performances. All the Jewish performers were thrown out from their jobs in\n1940 - \u00b041. And in Budapest, in the Jewish community center, there was a cult \u2014\nthere was a -\u2014 like a hall, culture hall. Small hall.",
        "Q: This is in Pest?",
        "A: In Pest. In [indecipherable] 12, and it\u2019s called the Goldmark Hall in memory\nof Karl Goldmark, who was a Jewish composer. And curiously and \u2014 and\nironically enough, the people who were thrown out for the first class, the best\nsingers, the best musicians. And so what they did, in order to make a living, they\nessentially organized their orchestra, and organized their \u2014 an opera company. And\nalmost daily they had concerts and opera performances, and it was a very vibrant\nNovember 13, 1997\nand I would \u2014 should say a better quality of performance than in the opera house. So\nmy mother bought tickets, and I remember that my first opera, which I saw, was\nRossini\u2019s \u201cMoses.\u201d And I saw a number of operas, Faust. And we had opera tickets\nlike once e-every two weeks, on Sundays. And we had opera tickets for \u201cThe\nQueen of Sheba,\u201d which was a Karl Goldmark opera for the \u2014 on the 20 \u2014 on the\n19\" of March, for the 19\" of March. And it was a sort of a birthday present for me\nbecause my birthday\u2019s the 28\" of March. So, we never went. Why didn\u2019t we?\nBecause on the morning of the 19\", the Germans came in, and the performance was\npostponed indefinitely. The school went on for a couple of more \u2014 I think maybe a\nweek or So.",
        "Q: The Germans came in, what do you remember about that day? Can you talk\nabout March 19\"?",
        "A: Yes, I remember the Germans came in, the tanks came in and it was very\nfrightening.",
        "Q: What do tanks look like to a 10 year old?",
        "A: Huge. I remember the Tigers, they were \u2014 they were unbelievably big. The\nTiger tanks were the \u2014 the largest German tanks. And I remember, as they rumbled\nthrough the city, and the street \u2014 we lived in a s \u2014 on a street which sort of led into\nthe center of the city. It was a wide street, and it was very much \u2014 it had streetcars,\nNovember 13, 1997\nbut it ha \u2014 it had enough room for tanks. I remember also 12 years later in 1956,\nwhen the Russian tanks rumbled on the same street, toward the center of the city.\nBut on that 19\" of March, it was absolutely frightening because we did not know\nwhat was going to happen. We knew that something terrible had happened. We\nheard the radio, and it was, you know, every hour on the hour there were more\nthings, saying, you know, orders given to various units. Hungarian units do this, you\nknow, fari \u2014 code words or code numbers, you know, 12th Hungarian division, be\nalert, or bring \u2014 bring yourselves to whatever city, and so forth. And what I\nremember is the confusion, and the \u2014 the disbelief that this could happen to us, and\nthe \u2014 an-and the belief that \u2014 that now, something which we didn\u2019t think would\nhappen, will. And of course, the optimist would say well, you know, what can the\nGermans do\u2019? The Germans came in because \u2014 we know why they came in, because\nthe Russians are pushing the German army toward the west and the Germans want\nto make sure that the \u2014 the German army has a retreat, you know, it wants to make\nsure that \u2014 that \u2014 that it could retreat. We also knew somewhat earlier that the\nHungarian government was already discussing peace feelers with \u2014 with the Brits,\nand that that government was quite liberal and looked the other way. Well, that all\nchanged on that day. In three days a new government was sworn in, Dome Sztojay,\nwho was a-\u2014 p-prior to this was the \u2014 the ambassador of Hungary to Berlin. And he\nNovember 13, 1997\nwas essentially a \u2014 an \u2014 he \u2014 he didn\u2019t speak very good Hungarian, he was a\nGerman himself. There were these Germans in the west side of Hungary, groups of\nGermans living there, we called them Schwabs. They were the \u2014 th-the ethnic\nGermans, and Szt\u00e9jay was one of them. And his government was containing the\nextreme Nazi elements. The only thing which was relatively heartening to us is that\nthe \u2014 that Horthy, who was the head of the government, stayed. Now, we found out\nthat Horthy was out of the country, and \u2014 but he came back later that afternoon. He\nwas with Hitler, and of course that was the trick Hitler used; while Horthy was\nout, that\u2019s when the \u2014 they came. We also found out that a couple of days later, that\nEichmann and company also showed up in Budapest. The reason why I know this\nis that my mother had an uncle who was a very prominent lawyer, and who was still\npracticing law in 1943. And the reason why he was \u2014 were two reasons. One is that\nhe was a World War I hero, a very decorated captain of the Austro-Hungarian army,\nand he was exempt from Jewish law. And secondly, he was a good friend of the\nGerman ambassador, Jakov. Well, Jakov left, Veesenmeyer came in. And va \u2014\nbefore Jakov left, he told my Grand-uncle Paul, Paul Kornhauser, whose son was\nlost in Voronezh, that Paul, things are changing. But Paul was a Germanophile all\nhis life, a-an admirer of Germany. Never really believed that anything could\nhappen to him. He was a prominent Jew. He was not very religious, but he was very\nNovember 13, 1997\nactive in the Jewish community. Many of the Jewish leaders told him that he\u2019s on a\nlist, that he should go into hiding. Well, he didn\u2019t. In fact, when he got his\nsummons, the first one ha \u2014 Eichmann did the same thing as he did everywhere\nelse, he\u2019s \u2014 he summoned the prominent Jewish leaders the first three days or four\ndays after this occupation, to a \u2014 a interim camp, and my uncle, my great-uncle took\nhis dress uniform, his Hungarian dress uniform with all his medals and went in and\ndemanded to be exempted from all these things. Well, they didn\u2019t exempt him at all.\nIn fact, they \u2014 they captured him and in a week, he and a hundred prominent Jewish\nleaders were sent to Auschwitz and he died there. So we knew that things are\nhappening. We also knew that by the fifth of April \u2014 on the 28\" of March, my 10\"\nbirthday came out a \u2014 the law that we must wear the yellow stars in a week. So by\nthe fifth of April we all wore the yellow stars. That was sort of my 10\" birthday\npresent.",
        "Q: How does it feel to wear a yellow star?",
        "A: Well, it \u2014 it certainly was \u2014 was something different. I was not very easy to\naccept that now everybody knows that I am different. I mean, up until now I \u2014\npeople the \u2014 we \u2014 we lived in a house where \u2014 in a building where two or three\nJewish families lived, the rest of them were not. This was not a \u2014 an issue, I mean,\nalthough anti-Semitism we knew about, but as I said, there were a number of\nNovember 13, 1997\nChristians who were friends, and sympathetic. But now, this was a \u2014 a \u2014a huge sign\non one\u2019s coat. It was easy to see who was. And of course, we did not know who the\n\u2014 the \u2014 the enemies were. Whom, we didn\u2019t know. And it was \u2014",
        "Q: Were you \u2014 were you unhappy about being Jewish?",
        "A: No, I was not unhappy being \u2014 being Jewish. No, at that part \u2014 time, I was\nalready very consciously Jewish. We had the Bible studies and Hebrew in \u2014 in\nelementary school, and I was much more conscious about being Jewish.",
        "Q: Would you have preferred to be something else? I\u2019m talking as a 10 year old.",
        "A: Oh I cert \u2014 I would have preferred to be not there, so \u2014 for sure, but I don\u2019t\nknow. I\u2014 I would say that I was \u2014 I was a proud Jew. I w \u2014 I was \u2014 probably\nwouldn\u2019t prefer to be anything but a Jew, but I certainly would have preferred to be\nnot a Jew who is \u2014 who is going to be sent to the slaughterhouse. And what \u2014 what\nhappened there in the \u2014 on the same day when we started to have to wear this\nJewish star, my father and other Jewish men from 18 to 60 were inducted again. So\nessentially, my mother, my grandmother and I stayed behind, and my grandparents.",
        "Q: Did your mother sew on the Jewish star on your clothes?",
        "A: Yes, and I remember that \u2014 that it was in the newspapers, you know, they were \u2014\nthey were telling us exactly how big is has to be, and how yellow and y-you \u2014 you\ncould buy this material, but 1t cannot be orange, it has to be very lemon yellow, and\nNovember 13, 1997\nit has to be this big and this wide and all these things. And I remember how we \u2014 we\nwere cutting it on the \u2014 on the table, on the dining room table, these things and we\nwere counting how many we need for the outer garments and inner garments, and it\nwas a\u2014 and then my mother and grandmother were sewing it. And we had to wear it\non the \u2014 right above our hearts on the left side. But what was really traumatic was \u2014\nis as I said, is my father had to leave again, and this time, of course, what do we do?\nAnd we didn\u2019t hear from him for a long while, and about a month or so later, we\nheard rumors that the \u2014 that the Jews in the countryside \u2014 and I had 150 relatives \u2014\nare starting to be gathered into ghettos. And there was an interesting things which\nhappened, which was another lost opportunity. My mother\u2019s family had a friend,\nand his \u2014 he was a \u2014 a romane \u2014 he was \u2014 he was a Romanian, or he lived in\nRomania, but he was Hungarian. And he came to Budapest in April, middle of\nApril, and came to my mother and said \u2014",
        "Q: 1944.",
        "A: Ninte \u2014 1944, correct. And he said to her, he said, look, things in Romania are\ncome and gone. I\u2019ll take George with me, and he\u2019ll be safe with me. My mother\nrefused. So this was another missed opportunity. And then he went and we never\nheard of him afterwards. We n\u2014 we don\u2019t know what happened to him and his\nfamily. But he is a\u2014 he was an old friend, and he was a trustworthy friend. But,\nNovember 13, 1997\nwhether it would have been better for me to go with him, or not, who knows?\nObviously, in the final [indecipherable] I was okay at the end. That happened in\nApril. We didn\u2019t hear about my relatives except these rumors, and these rumors\nwere getting more and more disturbing. Then we had a lot of different rules and\nregulations. We had to submit our radio, our bicycles, our telephone. And we were\ncut off from the world, because we had no radio, for example. So we didn\u2019t know\nwhat was going on.",
        "Q: You had to give up your own bicycle?",
        "A: I\u2014I-\u2014TIhad to give up my bicycle, I had to give up my \u2014 our radios, jewelry.",
        "Q: What that difficult for you as a 10 year old, to give up your bicycle?",
        "A: Yes, I did. I would say yes. I \u2014 I \u2014 it was difficult, and probably more difficult\nwas the radio, because it was a lifeline for us. And \u2014",
        "Q: What were you and your other 10 year old friends talking about? Did you used to\ntalk about the war, or did you just talk about typical children\u2019s things?",
        "A: Oh, we would \u2014 we talk more \u2014 more about typical children\u2019s thing, in the\nschool. The school was abruptly ending. By the middle of April, we had no school,\nit was all finished. It was the \u2014 I completed the fourth grade, I got my paper saying\nthat I completed the fourth grade and \u2014 and the Jewish kids no longer were allowed\nto go to school. I remember the fi \u2014 about two weeks after we had the \u2014 the red \u2014 the\nNovember 13, 1997\nyellow star on us, we still went to school, but then it was over and they told us that\nwe should come in October to rigi \u2014 to register for the gymnasium, for high school.\nOctober was not a good time to register that year, unfortunately. At home, there\nwere just too many things happening. We were listening \u2014 the radio we couldn\u2019t\nlisten to, but they had these \u2014 these announcements which they mounted on the\nwalls. And every day there was 20 - 30 different things, you know. We were\nrushing around and we were trying to make sure that we have food at home, we\nwere \u2014",
        "Q: These are loudspeakers on the street, or in the buildings?",
        "A: They were \u2014 they were newspaper, mostly the newspaper was used. There was\none thing which I remember in April; my father was still there, before they took\nhim. It was the first raid on Budapest, bombing \u2014 bombing raid. And my\ngrandfather, as I mentioned, on my father\u2019s side, who lived with my aunt, whose\nhusband was also inducted into the Ukraine, they lived in a small house, not too far\nfrom where we lived. And in this particular raid, their house was hit. We didn\u2019t\nknow this, but my father, after the raid was over, went \u2014 was worried and went over\nto see what happened. And it turned out that they were in the basement, and except\nfor my aunt, who got hit by something 1n the face, and bleeding, the grandparents\nwere Okay, and there was also a cousin. So all \u2014 all of them were brought, my\nNovember 13, 1997\nmother, my father brought them over. And my aunt was bleeding. Her name was\nElizabeth. And in our building, there was a doctor. And he was visiting \u2014 actually\nwas not living there, but he visited his sister and his mother, who lived there. They\nwere ethnic Germans, and he was an \u2014 an SS officer. And I don\u2019t know how and\nwhy so naively my father and mother went over to him, and asked him to help, give\nfirst aid help to my \u2014 to my aunt. So, rather naively my father went down to ask this\nSS doctor to help my aunt. I was there with him, and \u2014 with my aunt. And this man\n\u2014 I never forget his expression, he had very light blue eyes, and the amount of\nhatred which \u2014 which came out, was incredible and indescribable. What he said, I\u2019d\nnever forget, he says, you dirty Jews, you think I will help you? He says, you will \u2014\nyou will die just your brothers and sisters did, very soon. And then took and\nslammed the door in front of our faces. And I was completely flabbergasted, and I\nwas surprised and shocked by this. We knew his mother and his sister for years.\nThey lived \u2014 they were just a couple of \u2014 lived a \u2014 lived just a couple of doors away\nfrom where we were. They were never very friendly people, but I \u2014 we never\nrealized that, you know, how much of a Nazi they were and he was. In fact, one of\nthe interesting side \u2014 not interesting, tragic, I should say, was that he also at that\ntime \u2014 I found out later on that he was bragging that he himself killed 20 Jews. He\nwas one of the Nazi doctors who did experiments apparently, in the camps. I don\u2019t\nNovember 13, 1997\nknow what happened to him after the war. I know that his mother and his sister\nsurvived and stayed there.",
        "Q: Their names?",
        "A: I\u2014I wish I could tell you the names. I \u2014 I \u2014 I\u2014 I wrote down the names, but I\ndon\u2019t have it in my head. It starts with an H. A-As \u2014 if I remember, I \u2014 PII \u2014 I'll let\nyou know later. But that was right before my father was taken away in \u2014 in the\nmiddle of April. Once my father was taken, and as I mentioned, we were in a\u2014 ina\npanic every day because they had pages and pages of new regulations and orders,\nwhich in \u2014 which affected us. What we have to \u2014 what we cannot use, what we have\nto give in, and then finally, when we heard these rumors about what happened to the\n\u2014 the Jews in the provinces \u2014 you know, these were just slight rumors, and then we\ngot \u2014 but we were very busy then, because we \u2014 we got the order that we have to\nvacate our apartment, and we have to move into these special Jewish houses.",
        "Q: Can we just back up a little bit? Do you think your parents ever considered\ngetting, as some people tried to do, getting a baptismal certificate? Do you think\nthey ever thought about that?",
        "A: Well, I know that my father never thought of it. My mother, in April heard that if\nyou get a baptismal certificate, you may be exempt from something, and she talked\nto my father about it, and my father said, well, go ahead if you want to do it; [am\nNovember 13, 1997\nnot going to do it. And I remember that she and I went a couple of times, maybe\ntwice, to a convent not too far from where we lived, where we had these \u2014 they call\nthem white sisters. White sisters\u2019 convent. And they were giving a group of Jews\nlessons about the catechism. And we went, I think, maybe twice, and then my\nmother saw the futility of it, and she said no, forget it. So \u2014",
        "Q: Did it bother you to do that?",
        "A: It \u20141t didn\u2019t bother me to do it. I didn\u2019t understand the catechism at all. I\ncouldn\u2019t understand what \u2014 it was like Chinese to me. But \u2014 but the \u2014 the sisters\nwere kind, and it was \u2014 if it were something which would really help, I would say\nwhy \u2014 why not to do it? I mean, a lot of people did it. It turned out that \u2014 that\nconversions did not help at all. My \u2014 my uncle, who was converted because he\nbelieved in Catholicism, by the Primate of Hungary in the early 30s, and who went\nto church every Sunday, was inducted as a Jew, because both his parents were\nJewish and he was Jewish and his conversion was too late, and the only difference\nbetween him and my father was that he wore a white armband while my father wore\na yellow armband. And \u2014 but he got the same treatment, in fact worse, and he ended\nup in Auschwitz and he was gassed. So we knew that \u2014 that conversions were, at\nthat point, ineffective, but when in \u2014 when you are in a situation like this, you try\nanything and everything you can. But it always struck me and it always stayed with\nNovember 13, 1997\nme, that despite of the fact that my father was \u2014 I don\u2019t think he had gone into a\nsynagogue a half a dozen times in his last 20 years of his life, he still would refuse\nto do this, and that he was very much of a \u2014 a-\u2014a Jew. But he allowed us to, if he\nwanted to, they gave us this \u2014 this \u2014 this choice. So, what happened to us then, May\ncame, and we got the \u2014 the order that we have to move. And we moved in June,\ntoward the end of June. We were not allowed to take any furniture with us, only\nbeds, and only the most crucial clothing.\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nNovember 13, 1997\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\ninterview with George Pick. This is tape two, side A.",
        "A: It was June 17 when \u2014",
        "Q: 1944.",
        "A: \u2014 1944 when we had the, essentially the deadline to move. And my grandmother,\nmyself and my mother moved in \u2014 in with my grandmother\u2019s younger sister, who\nlived about two or three blocks away.",
        "Q: How did you get the order? How did they notify you?",
        "A: Well, they \u2014 they \u2014 they notified by \u2014 via newspaper, essentially everybody \u2014 the\nnewspapers came out, as I mentioned, with many, many orders every day. And\nrepeated deadlines, you know, when you have to move out and what houses are\navailable and so forth. So it was av \u2014 a lot of bureaucratic \u2014 but very fast. I mean,\nthe time the deadlines were days instead of weeks or months. And it was quite lucky\nfor us that we had, in this apartment house where we moved to, we had several\nrelatives living there, on Columbus Street. We lived in Elizabeth Street, which was\na main street. Columbus Street was like a side street.",
        "Q: Did you take anything special with you from your own apartment?\nNovember 13, 1997",
        "A: Yes, I\u2014I took some toys; not very many, because there was just no room for\nthat, because we moved into a two room place. The si \u2014 the three of us occupied one\nroom, and my grandmother\u2019s sister, her daughter, and the \u2014 and her daughter\u2019s\nbrother occupied another room. And then we had a meet \u2014 or ev \u2014 or almost every\napartment had a maid room \u2014 maid\u2019s room over the kitchen. And they took a single\nwoman there, so she was the seventh person living in a two room place. And the\nonly thing we could take 1s a \u2014 1s essentially our beds. And I remember, the room\nwas not that ver \u2014 large, and it was wall to wall beds. We had nowhere to eat, or we\nhad to sit on a sofa bed to eat, essentially. And this was the \u2014 as I said, the 17\" of\nJune, and we heard rumors that things are happening in the countryside. We did not\nknow precisely what.",
        "Q: Were these houses marked in any way?",
        "A: They were \u2014 they had the large yellow star, as if to tell people that this \u2014 this is a\nbuilding where, you know, Jews live, or lepers live, whatever you want. There was\none apartment which was occupied by a Christian family. The man was the super of\nthe apartment, his name was Mr. Vargo(ph), Janus(ph) Vargo(ph). He was a\ndecent fellow, and as you will hear, the \u2014 his actions were quite crucial in saving\nour lives; both my grandmothers and the relatives there, and my mother\u2019s and mine.\nWe settled in, essentially in the last week of June. There were a few young people, I\nNovember 13, 1997\nwas the youngest kid, there were no kids. There were a few teenagers, mostly older\npeople. And almost daily, toward the end of June, we started to have to go down to\nthe air raid shelter, because of air raids. I remember one particular day very vividly,\nand that was July the second, 1944; it was a Sunday. And even before, I was always\nworried about air raids, because evas \u2014 ever since the April air raid, ever since my\naunt was hurt, I was afraid. And I remember once Mr. Vargo(ph) [indecipherable]\nwas on the second of July, he \u2014 after everybody was ordered to the air raid shelter,\nhe took me upstairs to the \u2014 just to the street level, to show me how beautiful those\nairplanes are. And they were, I mean, indeed, huge airplanes coming in, hundreds of\nthem. And I \u2014 I can never forget the \u2014 the tremendous number. I mean, they almost\ncovered the sky. And we were out there maybe one or two minutes, and then I said\nno, I don\u2019t want to stay there, I want to go downstairs. So we did. And we sat there\nvery quietly for about 10 minutes and then all of a sudden we heard this tremendous\ncrash. At first is a whistling sound, a crash and the whole building shook up. And I\nstarted to scream and everybody else did too, and my mother sort of put my \u2014 my\nhead against her \u2014 her bosom and trying to put her hands again \u2014 in my \u2014 on my\nears so that I wouldn\u2019t hear this. And a few minutes later another, even larger\nsound, and it was like an earthquake. And we saw \u2014 we had these blast do \u2014 doors\nleading to the outside, and \u2014 and it\u2019s \u2014 this \u2014 this is a very heavy steel door. And\nNovember 13, 1997\nalong the door you see this brilliant light coming in. Of course, by then the\nelectricity was gone, and we were sitting in the pitch dark. And \u2014 and this \u2014 this was\nlike \u2014 like hell. And it went on for three hours, and we had four more very close\nhits, and we didn\u2019t think that we were going to survive, and then we did. And after\nthree hours we came up, and what we saw was incredible. We had \u2014 this building\nwas a three story apartment building. It was sort of stood by itself. About a hundred\nyards behind it, there was a six story apartment building, which was hit. And the\nonly thing \u2014 and it was a Jewish house, with the same yellow star like we did. The\nonly thing which stayed up there was one fire wall, and everything was down on \u2014\nin a big heap, and people were dead. Across the street there was a villa, a private\nhome, before the raid. Afterwards, there was just a huge crater in the \u2014 crater in the\n\u2014 on the \u2014 on the \u2014 on the earth, and you could see body parts. You could see hands\nand legs and [indecipherable]. And this \u2014 the right side had four tennis courts,\nnothing but a big crater. And the left side was a \u2014 just a vacant lot, and a crater. So\nessentially, within a hundred yards of the building, we had four huge bombs hit.\nAnd I could almost feel even today this \u2014 this smell of \u2014 of \u2014 of death there and \u2014\nand \u2014 and everything was smoking, and it was blackened, and purple, the sky was\npurple. And some people were optimists. I \u2014 I just can\u2019t believe that people said\nwell, maybe this is the end. Maybe \u2014 maybe this was used as a \u2014 as a camouflage to\nNovember 13, 1997\n\u2014 to drop paratroopers here, and maybe the Brits and the Americans are here, and\nwe will be coming \u2014 we\u2019ll be freed. And of course, that was not the case at all.\nWhat was the real story was that it was the first carpet bombing of Budapest, and\n30 percent of the city went \u2014 was in ruins, and the Jews were blamed for it. And \u2014",
        "Q: How are the Jews blamed for it?",
        "A: Well, the propaganda, I mean, the \u2014 the radios were blaring that it was a Jewish\nconspiracy, that Jews left their lights on their buildings to show where the \u2014 where\nthe city was, because of course we had blackouts at \u2014 at night. Well, blackou \u2014 and\n\u2014 and of course, if you were caught with any kind of light seeping through, that was\na punishable \u2014 death punishable offense. And when \u2014 we were very careful looking\naround all the time, to make sure that there is no light, because we were accused of\n\u2014 of spying, too.",
        "Q: Was this the first time you had seen dead bodies?",
        "A: It was. Actually, these kind of dead bodies. There was one dead body I saw a\nfew days before this. And this happened because there was a pharmacist who lived\nin our building and who poisoned himself, he committed suicide, and I saw him.",
        "Q: This was a Jewish pharmacist?",
        "A: Jewish pharmacist who lived there, and I saw him being taken away ina\nstretcher and he was \u2014 his hands were \u2014 I didn\u2019t see his face because it was turned,\nNovember 13, 1997\nbut his hands were yellow and were sort of hanging down from the stretcher. And\nthat was the first dead body. But the number of dead bodies after this raid, they\nwere \u2014 they were really huge. And the first time that I saw this kind of \u2014 it\u2019s not just\ndead, I mean, they were bloody. It was \u2014 was \u2014 was \u2014 was like hell.",
        "Q: How does a 10 year old process something like that?",
        "A: Well, I was absolutely frightened. After this, every t-two \u2014 twice a day, all\nregular like clockwork, at 11 0\u2019clock in the morning, the \u2014 the westerns allies came,\nand then nine o\u2019clock at night the Russians came in bombing raids. And every time\nthis happened, my mother had a huge pillow, which she put on my head. And to\nshow you how traumatic it was, it took 30 years for me to be able to sleep without a\npillow over my head. And \u2014 and it was \u2014 it was an absolute trauma. I mean, I \u2014 I \u2014\neven today, if I hear some unexpected large noise, loud noise, I would jump. We did\nnot know it at the time, that besides the air raid, we had an even deadlier situation\ndeveloping in Budapest. What had happened is 3,000 gendarmes came out \u2014 came\nup to Budapest two days before, in process, or in \u2014 in the process of wanting us to\nbe deported. In other words, by this \u2014 by the first of July, most of the Hungarian\nJews from the countryside were deported. The only community alive was\nBudapest. My 150 relatives were largely dead by then. We did not know this, but\nwhat had happened is the extreme Nazis wanted to commit a coup, and get rid of\nNovember 13, 1997\nHorthy. And they got these 3,000 gendarmes for two reasons; one is to prepare for\ndeportation of the Jews, and number two is to get rid of Horthy. And there was\nonly just a few, the courage of a few army officers who were available and who\nwere ready to follow orders. And one single army unit, a Panzer division was\nwilling to come to Budapest to counteract this \u2014 not necessarily the deportation of\nthe Jews, but the \u2014 the coup against the region. And by the second of July, they\nwere around Budapest, taking up positions. By the seventh of July, they forced\nthese gendarmes to leave. And Horthy declared that that day, that they deportations\nwould stop. And that, of course, saved our lives, because with 3,000 gendarmes, we\nwould be deported in probably a week, or two weeks. I mean, in six weeks, almost\n500,000 Hungarian Jews were deported from the countryside. You can imagine that\n160 to 180,000 Jews in \u2014 in Budapest, were concentrated, could be deported in a\nmatter of days. But we were not. And that saved our lives. What happened after this\nwas a\u2014a little miracle. Eichmann left. He was frustrated by this inaction by the\nHungarian government. And he also knew that things were not going well in the\nfront. What we didn\u2019t know, but he did, and many of the Nazis did, 1s that the\nHungarian government started again some negotiations with the western allies and\neven with the Russians. And these negotiations, essentially, they wanted to manifest\nthis \u2014 their good will. So the way they did it 1s they essentially replaced the\nNovember 13, 1997\ngovernment with a \u2014 a government of army officers, who were not as extreme. And",
        "Q: Did you ever see Eichmann?",
        "A: I did not personally see Eichmann, no.",
        "Q: Did you ever see Horthy?",
        "A: I have seen Horthy, yes, when I was a kid, yes.",
        "Q: What did he appear to you to be like?",
        "A: Well, he was a handsome old man. He was \u2014 he was an [indecipherable] but he\nwas a\u2014a horseman, and he \u2014 he rode the white horse. And we had a national\nholiday on the 20\" of August, which was a holiday for the first king of Hungary,\nSaint Steven. And what I remember about \u2014 maybe I was six or seven when my\nfather took me to this day \u2014 the \u2014 the Saint Steven\u2019s day on the 20\" of August was a\ngreat holiday, because his right hand was, as a miracle, was preserved. Now, this\nman died a thousand years ago, and his right hand was the icon of Hungary, and\nthey took this right hand and \u2014 and they took it all around the city, you know,\nthere\u2019s a whole procession. And Horthy used to ride the horse, also. And I\nremember this procession in the late 30s, when this had happened. And I saw him\nonce after that. In 1938, if I remember, there was a huge, Catholic congress in\nBudapest, where the pope came, and \u2014 or at least the man who became pope later,\nNovember 13, 1997\nPius the 12\". And he spoke and Horthy was with him and I saw \u2014 I remember that\nI saw \u2014 this was a huge thing. He was not just a Catholic thing, he was everybody\u2019s\nthing, and I saw Horthy that time again, the second time.",
        "Q: Was he a hero to you?",
        "A: He was not a hero to me, but he was not a villain, either. We knew that he had\nJewish friends. We knew that his best poker partner was a Jewish industrialist my \u2014\nby name of Goldberger(ph) and Weiss(ph). And his wife was connected to \u2014 there\nwas a rumor that his wife had Jewish blood in her. And that \u2014 we knew that his\nolder son, married to a\u2014 a countess who was very much pro-Jew. In fact, it turned\nout that \u2014 that she was working for the \u2014 the \u2014 the anti-Nazi resistance. And she\u2019s\nstill alive. She\u2019s a very old lady now. And we knew that \u2014 that Horthy, if he was\nnot pro-Jewish, he had friends, and he was not the worst. He was not a hero, but he\n\u2014as I said, he was not a villain either. So going back to my story, we did not know,\nbut we were saved. After Horthy changed the government, things started to be a\nlittle easier. Up until then, we only had like one or two hours where we could go out\nto the street. We were \u2014 we had a \u2014 given a couple of more hours of freedom, free\ntime to go to the street, to shop, for example.",
        "Q: What did you do inside the apartment when you couldn\u2019t go out?\nNovember 13, 1997",
        "A: Well, I was a lonely child, I \u2014 I didn\u2019t have people to play with, so I played with\nmy toys, and I was with the relatives. They played cards, and I sort of sat next to my\nmother, and they had a\u2014 a game which they played every \u2014 a day, which was a sort\nof a superstition. I \u2014 I don\u2019t know if this game exists here, I guess it does. There is a\n[indecipherable] like a \u2014 a [indecipherable] with alphabets, with \u2014 with various\nABC and so forth. And what they do is they put a \u2014 an upside-down \u2014 a turned\nwater glass, and they put their hands on and then supposedly a ghost comes and\nthen pushes the glass and then spells out things and tells you your answers, you\nknow, and most of the questions were, are we going to have an air raid tonight, you\nknow, and of course we didn\u2019t need to know the answer, we knew that it was\ncoming. But, you know, some people believed this, and we played that every day.\nThat was a\u2014a-\u2014a game we played. And we also, as I said, we played various \u2014\nvarious games, word games, and I was sort of tolerated by the adults. And I was\ntrying to be a fly on the wall most of the time, and didn\u2019t do too much. Wasn\u2019t very\nhappy and wasn\u2019t very active. I was reading a lot actually, I had a few books and I\nwas reading. I \u2014 I was \u2014 my favorite author was Jules Verne, and since I was all\n[indecipherable] up, I was reading about \u201c20,000 Leagues Under the Sea,\u201d and\nFive Weeks in the A-Air \u2014 Air Balloon, and things like that. I \u2014 I was always\ninterested in \u2014 in adventures, and it was certainly an ironic time to read about those\nNovember 13, 1997\nadventures. And that\u2019s what I did. And the summer went relatively fast, and \u2014 and it\nwas lucky, because my father\u2019s unit was brought back from the western parts of\nHungary, where they built fortifications to Budapest. And my father was lucky\nbecause his commander was a decent man again. Turned out that his \u2014 the\ncommander\u2019s fianc\u00e9e was Jewish, and she lived in our building. And the\ncommander sort of looked the other way when half of his brigade sort of\ndisappeared every evening, and reappeared every early morning. This was strictly\nillegal. If a man was caught, he \u2014 under the circumstances, he would be subject to\nimmediate execution. Nevertheless, my father, about two, three times a week, took\nthis chance and came home late at night, after curfew, and Mr. Vargo(ph) let him\nin. Mr. Vargo(ph) got a few hundred peng\u00e9s for this act, but nevertheless, he took a\nchance too. My father came in for a few hours, and then he went back early in the\nmorning. So it was happiness that we have seen him at that time. And again, the\neternal optimist said well, 1t couldn\u2019t last long. The Russians were already fighting.\nWe knew the Romanians were out of the war already, and \u2014 and they know \u2014 we\nalso knew that, you know, the war couldn\u2019t last for more than a week or two. I\nmean, the Russians were less than a hundred kilometers from Budapest at this\npoint. So the October 15 rolled around, and October 15 was a very tumultuous and\nvery important day. That was the day when Horthy declared that Hungary was\nNovember 13, 1997\nbecoming a neutral country, and that Hungary essentially threw in the towel. Well,\nI can tell you that 1t was unreal for us. We heard this on loudspeakers, and we went\nout, and we ra \u2014 ripped al \u2014 our yellow stars off, and we were absolutely hysterical.\nBut the people around us were yelling down from their windows that we are just a\nlittle bit too premature, we are a little bit too happy. And they said, well, you dirty\nJews, don\u2019t think that you will survive. And indeed, they were more prophetic that\nwe realized, because in a couple of hours, the \u2014 this \u2014 this coup was over. In fact,\nwith German help, the most extreme Nazis, Hungarian Nazis took over. The ar \u2014 the\nArrow Cross. And we heard Mr. Vargo\u2019s(ph) radio, he was nice enough to open his\ndoors so people could hear through the radio, when they were looking for\nBarakti(ph) Burger(ph), who was the extreme Nazi general to come to Budapest\nimmediately to assume the \u2014 the \u2014 the command of the \u2014 the troops. And we heard\nby the end of the day that Horthy was arrested and then that Szalasi became the\nhead of the state and a new government was sworn in. And this was the 15\". Ten\ndays later, all the women between the ages of \u2014 Jewish women, ages of 18 and 40\nwere ordered to come to a soccer field, which was the Kishauk(ph) soccer field.\nAnd this impacted my aunts, Elizabeth, who was 29, with a baby of three years old,\nand Yoli(ph), who was 38, with a cousin of mine, who was my age, 11 \u2014 10 \u2014 10\nand a half. And my mother was 43, so she was too old to go, but they did. And\nNovember 13, 1997\n10,000 young women went. The women who had children were excused, and\nYoli(ph) left, but Elizabeth didn\u2019t. She was too tired, she was just \u2014 she said, I \u2014 I \u2014\nI just give up. And the \u2014 she was one of the ones who were deported. At that time\nthey had no transportation except to walk. They had these death marches. And she\nmade the death march, we knew that she did, because her friends who survived told\nus. She got to Ravensbrick, and she died a few days before liberation. She was 29.\nHer baby daughter, Susan, was hidden by an aunt who was not Jewish, who was a\nwife of my uncle, Lazlo Pick. Now Lazlo Pick was one of the uncles who went to\nthe Ukraine in 1941. He was a thin, skinny man, but he was a tenacious sports\nperson. And he walked the 800 miles. He just got back in March of 1944, just in\ntime for the next round. And he was to be deported in September, but he didn\u2019t wait\nfor that, he took his rucksack, left it and went home, where his wife, in an efficiency\napartment not very much bigger than this one, hid him in a closet for three months.\nAnd she also hid the baby, my cousin Susan, and they survived. My father came\nhome in the beginning of November, with the news that he got the 24 hours\nfurlough, and that he is going \u2014 he wa \u2014 if he 1s going back next mon \u2014 next day in\nthe morning, he 1s to go to the railroad station, and he knows that he was going to be\ntaken to Germany, and he was not about to go back. He had a friend, and they had\na plan. The plan was that they were going to my grandfather\u2019s abandoned building,\nNovember 13, 1997\nwhich was in ruins, but the basement was in fairly good shape. And they knew the\nwar was going to be over in a week, so they would go there and they would just\nstick it out there. And my father left, and we didn\u2019t know what happened. This was\nthe sixth of November. We didn\u2019t know anything. On the 22\"4 of November, a \u2014 an\narmy man came over and we were very surprised, I mean, you don\u2019t see an army\nsoldier coming to a Jewish house. And he came in and he wanted to talk to my\nmother and he handed her a note. And the note said that \u2014 was a one sentence that\nsaid, you and George follow this soldier and come immediately where he will take\nyou. Well, my mother was unhappy about this, because she didn\u2019t want to leave my\ngrandmother and everybody. And \u2014 and \u2014 or the \u2014 the message was not to tell\nanybody anything. And so we went, but my mother didn\u2019t take anything except me\nwith her. And we went to this place, which was a factory building on the other side\nof town, in a blue collar neighborhood, called Chango(ph) Street. And it was a\nfactory, a textile factory. And the soldier took us there and we met my father. It\nturned out that this factory was a camouflage place, where they had a bunch of\nJews, Jewish men, hidden. The outs \u2014 for the outside world this factory was a\nfactory for army uniforms, Hungarian army uniforms. My father was quite mad at\nus when he saw that we just came with nothing, and told us to go back immediately,\nand come the very same evening, come hell or high water. So my mother saw when\nNovember 13, 1997\n\u2014 when \u2014 when she saw \u2014 when she saw that he was mad, we went home. We got\nback and we were terribly rushed, because we had maybe a half an hour before\ncurfew. And she threw in a couple of \u2014 she \u2014 the thing which she was most worried\nabout were the family photos. And she threw in a f\u2014 the family photos in a small\nbag, which I still have. And she also put a little food in, and nothing else. While we\nwere in the midst of this desperate packing, the house was raided by two teenage\nNazis. And they came in, one must not been \u2014 I don\u2019t think one was more than 13\nand the other one maybe 16 - 17. They had submachine guns with them. And they\nwent and they rampaged the whole place. They \u2014 they broke things, they stole\nthings, they made a mess. They saw these little thing which my mother put together,\nthis little bag, and threw it on the floor and stomped on it, and they terrorized\neverybody for a couple of hours. And then they finally left. And this was after the\ncurfew. So my mother put everything back and begged Mr. Vargo(ph) to let us out.\nAgain, little money changed hands and Vargo(ph) let us out and we went. And we\ngot there \u2014 this was end of November, toward the end of November, so it was a\nshort day, just like today. And by six o\u2019clock or so, it was quite late la \u2014 quite dark.\nWe got there and my father was really relieved to see us, and told us how he got\nthere, because we didn\u2019t know what was going on. So he told us that he went to this\nrendezvous place with his friend, his name was Gargutzi(ph). And Gargutzi(ph)\nNovember 13, 1997\nnever showed up. He was caught in a raid, and he was killed. So my father was in a\npanic, and went to a friend of his, by the name of Gaykis(ph), who was a Christian\nbusiness associate, and told him that he needs to hide somewhere. Well Gaykis(ph)\ntold him that he would be happy to help. He gave him this address, it\u2019s\nChangutca(ph) 6B address, and gave him a note. Told him to \u2014 not to talk to\nanybody, just go there, hand the note to the commanding officer of this army \u2014\nfactory. My father did just that, and he handed the note to the soldier and \u2014 and the\nsoldier took back the note to the army commander and then the door opened and he\nwas let in, and the army commander went to see him. The army commander turned\nout to be a Jew who was a friend of my father\u2019s, and who was playing this role. He\nwas a spit and polished army \u2014 army commander uniform. And he told my father\nthat 65 people who escaped from deportation are also there. They are all men, and\nhe is welcome. And this was in the beginning of November. Toward the middle of\nNovember, the man who heard the news \u2014 they were much better informed, of\ncourse, than us, that things are happening throughout town, they knew about the\ndeportation of the women. They started to bring their families in. So my father also\ntook this \u2014 sent a soldier who was a deserter \u2014 a real, bona fide soldier, but a\ndeserter, to the note \u2014 with the note to my mother, and that\u2019s how we got there.\nWell, my mother didn\u2019t bring anything and so my father\u2019s overcoat served for the\nNovember 13, 1997\nnext three months as our blanket. We did not know what had happened, but this is\nwhat happened, the very next day: the Arrow Cross raiders came back, and took\neverybody from the building where we lived, to the brickyards. And at that point,\nMr. Vargo(ph), who knew of a brother, my grandmothers had a \u2014 two sisters and a\nbrother in Budapest. And a brother lived in a Swedish house, Swedish \u2014",
        "Q: Safe house.",
        "A: A safe house, correct, safe house, which was a \u2014 was saved by Wallenberg. And\nMr. Vargo(ph) ran to this man, by the name of Beyla(ph) Kornhaus \u2014 Beyla\nSpitzer(ph), and tell him that \u2014 told him that his three sisters were in the brick\nfactories. And Spitzer was able to get in touch with Wallenberg, who went and\ntook the three ladies, and one lady\u2019s daughter with her \u2014 with him, and took \u2014 took\n\u2014 took these four people to the safe house. The other ones were deported, and \u2014 by\nfoot, and none of them came back. We would be among those who were deported,\nand who would have been, of course, the victims. This we found out later, after the\nwar. In the place where we now were in the factory, we had about 120 - 130 people.\nThey had a bunch of kids, young women and 1n a few days we found out that there\nwas a group of young people who were running around in Nazi uniforms, but they\nwere Jews. And they had a \u2014 a group of five or six people who went to the\ndeportation trains and to the roads, to snatch some people back. They had papers, wi\nNovember 13, 1997\n\u2014 which were forgeries, which said that such and such people would have to be\nbrought back to headquarters because they wanted to interrogate them. And this\nway they brought in more than 50 people back from the road, who were already to\ncertain death, mostly \u2014 mostly young women, and some young men, but mostly\nwomen. And so in the next week or so, the number of people went to about 170. We\nhad about 22 kids, some of them were younger than I, and it was a \u2014 a great\ncamaraderie. I mean, since \u2014 since the early spring that year, in 1944, I haven\u2019t been\nwith kids. And it was a lot of fun, and what was fun about it is that this \u2014 this\nfactory had a bunch of machines, big textile machines and we were av \u2014 able to\nexplore these, and a few of us were curious, particularly one fellow. His name was\nFoti(ph). Foti(ph) Yonchee(ph) and John Foti(ph). And he was my age, and he \u2014\nwe went on, and we played with these machines and it was just a lot of adventure.\nWe also found that there was a garage, or sort of a shed, which had a \u2014 a lot of hay.\nAnd the hay was important because attached to the factory, there was a horse, and a\n\u2014and a lorry. Horse and a lorry. And the hay was, of course, his food, horse\u2019s food.\nBut what we found out, which was very interesting and uk \u2014 unexpected 1s that one\nof the young men who was in this resistance told us that under the hay there was a\ncar, a personnel motorcar, which they use to rescue people.\nEnd of Tape Two, Side A\nNovember 13, 1997\nBeginning Tape Two, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\nvolunteer collection interview with George Pick. This is tape number two, side B.",
        "A: Okay, so what we found out is that under the hay was this car, and they gave us\nthe permission to go into the car, and it was, of course, very exciting. This \u2014 this car\nwas an early Skoda, model 1930s. And at that time, in order to start the car, you\nhad a piece of \u2014 a steel rod you had to put in in the front and make it, you know,\nmove it around. But these people told us, and I am sure this was a fib, that in fact \u2014\nin fact that\u2019s thing was not a part of the starter, but it was a machine gun built into\nthe car, and that this would be used in case something happens here. And we\nbelieved that, it was a good \u2014 good fib, and it was certainly an interesting story.\nUnfortunately the reality was a little less interesting. What had happened is that on\nthe second of December, we heard a \u2014 a very powerful knock on the door, and there\nwere only f\u2014 a few seconds before we heard running steps. We \u2014 our \u2014 our rooms\nwere on the second floor, second story of this place. It was really camouflaged as\nwork rooms, but by the time we reached this number of people, there was not\nenough room to sleep on the floor, so they build these multiple \u2014 actually three story",
        "Q: Bunks?\nNovember 13, 1997",
        "A: Bunks, I guess you can call them. And they brought the hay from downstairs and\nwe \u2014 we Slept on the hay and we used the army uniforms, we had several hundred of\nthose, as blankets and pillows, whatever. And we were in a middle bunk, and I\nremember the [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Did you ba \u2014 did you stay with the children, or did you sleep with the children,\nor with your mother?",
        "A: No, I slept with my mother and my father. The families stayed together.\nUnderneath there was another family with a little girl I remember, her name was\nOnchee(ph). She was about two or three years old and she made a racket and she\nmade her grandpa \u2014 Papa, very, very mad all the time, and she knew how to push\nhis buttons. And it was hilarious, I mean, it was really funny. Very close by, there\nwas a young lady, young woman. Her name was Cotto(ph) Ferhier(ph). And she\nwas a \u2014 she was married, she was 22 years old, and we got very good friends. She \u2014\nshe was patient enough with me and I talked to her about my stories I read and all\nthese things, and I was 10 going on 30, and we really became very good friends and\nmy mother and father didn\u2019t mind that at all, because of course, they didn\u2019t have to\nbabysit me. And that was another friendship, but she was more interested in another\nfellow, who was a young man by the name of Bondi(ph). And Bondi(ph) was one\nof the \u2014 the refugees there, the \u2014 the one who was able to escape from deportation.\nNovember 13, 1997\nAnd Bondi(ph) one day, and this was the very end of November, I think the 30\",\ngot very, very sick. And he got high fever and he was delirious. And the committee\nwho ran this place had a real dilemma, they didn\u2019t know what to do. If they bring in\nsomebody from the outside, you know, they may jeopardize 129 \u2014 69 people, and if\nthey don\u2019t, they may have Bondi(ph) dead within a day or two. Well, they decided\nthe next day, when Bondi\u2019s(ph) condition became worse, that they were going to\nbring somebody in. And \u2014 and they brought a Christian doctor in late at night, and\nhe gave him sulfur drugs, it turned out that it was an infection. And in a day or so,\nhe got better. The date is very important, this was the first of December. In the\nmorning of the second, we heard the running steps, and as we were trying to\nscramble for some shelter, we saw five men running in with submachine guns and\nyelling and screaming us and saying that we know who you are, you are just a\nbunch of dirty Jews who are trying to \u2014 to hide here, and we are the police, the Nazi\nstate police. This was the gest \u2014 the Hungarian Gestapo. And they sorted out the\nmen to one side of the room, and women and children to the other and we thought\nthat this was the end. I mean, there was just no way. Within the few seconds of\nconfusion, one man, John dove out the window and into another building. It was\nlike six or seven feet, and he really jumped, and he crashed through a \u2014 a \u2014 a glass\ndoor \u2014 glass enclosure. And his luck was that it was a haystack underneath, so he\nNovember 13, 1997\ngot into the haystack. And they ran after him, they tried to push the haystack, they\ncouldn\u2019t find him. But we were captured, and we thought that this was going to be\nthe end. But for a while nothing happened, and about 20 or 30 minutes later, the\ndetectives, one of the leaders of the detectives came out of the office, and made the\nfollowing startling statement, that henceforth we are under their protection. And we\njust couldn\u2019t figure out what happened. There was only one arrest which they made,\nand that was a na\u2014 aman by the name of Kormus(ph). Kormus(ph) was the \u2014 the\nleader of the group. Not the commander, but the real leader, the organizer. I didn\u2019t\nknow much about Kormus(ph), but I found out later what \u2014 who he was. They took\nhim and they took us, oh, 10,000 dollars in cash, which by sheer luck was there,\nbecause there were a number of extremely rich people in hiding. So in other words,\nthey bribed these detectives. And they left with Kormus(ph) and the money, but\nthey left us behind. After the war I found out that they took Kormus(ph) and they \u2014\nthey tortured him for two days because they knew that this, our place, was not the\nonly one. In fact, it was a network of four places, all of which Kormus(ph) ran.\nThey knew of three, our place, and another two. And what happened is Kormus(ph)\nwas betrayed. We thought that the doctor did \u2014 betrayed us, it was not the doctor. It\nwas aman by name of Althurdi(ph), who hid Kormus(ph) and his family for\nmonths. And the speculation was that he was either blackmailed, or he didn\u2019t get\nNovember 13, 1997\nenough money, but he betrayed Kormus(ph). He knew of three places Kormus(ph)\ncould have been, and he knew of a fourth place, but he did not know the address of\nthe fourth place. So when he \u2014 when Kormus(ph) was betrayed, they raided three\nof the four places, Kormus(ph) happened to be in our place. But the fourth place\nthey didn\u2019t know. The fourth place was a factory in another part of Budapest with\n350 Jewish slave laborers who were essentially also hiding there. But they, the slave\nlaborers were armed, and they had a mission there. They were armed, and their\nmission was that they would save the utility companies of Budapest. The paper said\n\u2014 they were all in army uniforms \u2014 their paper said that they would be the last one to\nstay, to blow up these utilities, the gas \u2014 gas company, the \u2014 the wa \u2014 the\nwaterworks and so forth, and the electric company. That was the paper which said,\nbut the real mission was to, in fact, save these utilities. And every day they were\ntrained like soldiers. Every night on the other hand, they we \u2014 they had a little\nfactory underneath and they forged papers. And they worked with the Zionists and\nthey worked with our little group, and they were part of the Hungarian Jewish\nresistance, and Kormus(ph) was the head. So Kormus(ph) \u2014 they \u2014 they knew\nKormus(ph) knew about this and they tortured him. He did not speak, and because\nhe didn\u2019t show up for two days, they knew in the fourth place, that things were bad,\nso they left. They \u2014 they \u2014 they \u2014 they couldn\u2019t accomplish their mission, but they\nNovember 13, 1997\nwere all safe, they were able to escape. And then Kormus(ph) was sentenced to\ndeath, and they took him to the Danube, but he was able to escape. He was very\nsick because of the fact that he \u2014 they tortured him, but he escaped. He was able to\nhide, and he survived the war. The other two places which were raided, were not as\nlucky as we were. They had not many rich people there and they were deported.\nOne was deported on foot to \u2014 to Germany, and they all died. And the second part\nwas taken to political headquarters, and they \u2014 they were among the ones who were\nsentenced and 70 of them were taken to the Danube, and only Kormus(ph) was\nable to escape. The rest of them were shot into the Danube. So our group was\nessentially the \u2014 out of the three groups, our group was the only one who survived.\nAfter this happened, the committee who ran the building decided that the 22\nchildren were not safe, so they decided to take us from \u2014 ranging from age of six\nmonths to 11 years, I was among the oldest. And one lady who \u2014 who had the six\nmonths old son, I think, they took us to a\u2014 a Red Cross building which was in the\nmiddle of the city. We took the lorry and the soldier brought us to the Red Cross\nbuilding. And the idea was that this was a protected building, we would be fed there\nand we would be okay. That was the theory. The practice was that when we got\nthere, there were about three or 400 children, crying, hungry, dirty and maybe a half\na dozen adults. I didn\u2019t like the place at all.\nNovember 13, 1997",
        "Q: When you said this was a \u2014 another protected building, protected by whom?",
        "A: By the Red Cross, Swiss Red Cross building, okay? They were the \u2014 they had\nabout 30 buildings throughout town, which were run by the Swiss Red Cross, like\nthe Swedish buildings, this \u2014 but this was not within that enclosure, you know.\nThere was a\u2014 what they called an international ghetto, where the Swiss, the\nSwedes, the [indecipherable] and the Spanish had rented buildings, about 32\nbuildings. This was 1n a part of town, and they were all concentrated. That\u2019s where\nmy grandmother and my grand-aunts and uncle were. The Red Cross buildings were\nthroughout the city, they were essentially Swiss protected. Not very well, as you\nwill hear in a minute. But at the time that I got there they were protected, and they\nwere concentrating children there. Now, the idea was that there were adults who\nwould supervise these children, they would bring hoo \u2014 food and everything. Well,\nthe \u2014 that was the theory. The practice was that the building was almost empty. I\nwas put in with a friend of mine, into a room where we had about 35 children of my\nage. No furniture, we were sleeping on the floor and we were told that there is no\nfood for the day. Well, I wandered around and I was crying, and I met a friend of\nmine from school there, who was there with his sister. I knew him, his name is\nMike Vairmas(ph). He now lives here in this country. And he was telling me that\nhe wa \u2014 he just came in a few days earlier and they are thinking about leaving the\nNovember 13, 1997\nbuilding, escaping, because they haven\u2019t gotten any food there since they came. So,\na young girl saw me there crying, and asked me why I was crying, and I was saying\nI was hungry and I was lonely for my mother. This young girl has a boyfre \u2014 had a\nboyfriend who was in a Nazi uniform, and who told me that he would be more than\nhappy to take me back. Well, I knew that that was not the right answer, and I knew\nthat I had to escape now, cause I knew that if this man would take a \u2014 take me back\nto where we are hiding, you know, he would betray us. So John Foti(ph) and I\ndecided that in the very next morning, we are going to take off. And the building\nwas locked from the inside, so we couldn\u2019t just walk out. And the next morning\nwhen the employees came, there was a kindly lady who came and we asked her to\ntake us out so that we could buy some food. And as she took us out, we ran away\nfrom her.",
        "Q: Wasn\u2019t that a very brave decision? You\u2019re 11 years \u2014 10 years old, to do that?",
        "A: It was a brave decision, but it \u2014 we had no choice, because if we went back, the\nNazi would recognize us, would take us to where my father and mother and the\nother people were hiding. I didn\u2019t want to take that chance. The chance was that\nthey would catch us somewhere, because they were looking for kids too, and of\ncourse we didn\u2019t wear our \u2014 our yellow star. That was the chance I had to take. It\ntook us a couple of hours to \u2014 to get back. We were sort of ducking various little\nNovember 13, 1997\ngroups of Nazis who were patrolling the streets. We bought a newspaper, which we\npretended to read. We took a number of streetcars to go, and we knew where \u2014\nwhere the place was, so we had to change like three times, and we got back there.\nMy mother couldn\u2019t believe that I did come back and we came back. We were the\nonly two kids who \u2014 who did come back. After the war I found out that about three\ndays later, the Nazis raided the building and they took the children to the Danube\nand they shot them. And my friend Mike and his sister escaped just a day or so\nearlier, but not the rest of them; the rest of them all died. So here we were, this was,\nI think maybe the 10\" of December. A few days after this, two policemen showed\nup in our building and told us that the detectives sent out \u2014 sent them to let us know\nthat we are under suspicion by some of the Nazis, who live in the area, and they are\nabout to report this suspicious building and people. And that they da \u2014 they\nsuggested that we should follow them, they would take us to the ghetto. The ghetto\nin Budapest was established at the very end of November. And the people who\nwere still in the \u2014 the yellow stone \u2014 yellow starred houses were taken to the \u2014 to the\nplaces. Now, many of the yellow starred houses were raided, and many of the\npeople already were deported, but in the middle of December, which is what \u2014 what\nwas, there were \u2014 Budapest was almost completely surrounded by Russian troops.\nAnd so the Nazis decided that they would concentrate the Jews who are left in\nNovember 13, 1997\nBudapest into a small ghetto in the middle of town, which was the \u2014 used to be the\nJewish quarters. And then they would do something. And so, on the 14\" of\nDecember, the ghetto was already established and these policemen told us that they\nwould go ahead, we would be behind them, they would not look back, and nothing\nelse was said. Well, of the 150 people roughly, only 65 arrived in the ghetto. The\nrest sort of evaporated along the way. My father decided that we have nowhere to\nhide, so we went back to the ghetto. The ghetto, as I mentioned, was in a very poor\nsection of town, the Jewish quarters. The center of it was a square, Klauzal square,\nand in that square, or one part of the square was a market. They took us to the\nmarket, where the Nazis \u2014 a number of Nazis were there, Hungarian Nazis, told us\nthat, if you have any jewelry, money, they are going to do a body search, and if they\nfind anything, they\u2019Il shoot us. There was a dead body to sh \u2014 to prove the point.\nAnd we didn\u2019t have anything, but a couple of people did, and they would throw the\n\u2014 the jewelry into the sewer rather than giving it to these people. Of the 63 of us\nwho got there, we were separated into several groups. The group which my father\nand I \u2014 my mother and I stayed with were about 20 people. We were just taken to\nthe other side of the square, is Klauzal square seven, a three story old building.\nTurned out that this building housed a \u2014 the remnants of a old age home, old age\nJewish home, brought in, and the first two stories \u2014 floors, were quite chock full of\nNovember 13, 1997\npeople, but the third story was empty. So they gave us two rooms there, and it was\ndirty and no food. And I remember that after \u2014 the day after we arrived, my father,\nwho was always enterprising, he was looking around and he found a piece of bread,\nwhich must have been six months old. And bugs were jumping all over the place\nout of it, but he said, that\u2019s okay, because we\u2019ll toast it and then we can eat it.\nThat\u2019s precisely what we did, somehow we toasted it, bugs all got fried and then we\nate a piece of it. That was the food for that particular day. People were not very\nchoosy at that point. My father also went around to see what \u2014 what was the\nsituation in the ghetto. The ghetto was \u2014 th-the area originally was an area for about\n12,000 people. By the time we got there, they had about 40,000 people living there,\nand at its peak they had 70,000 people. So you can imagine that there were not \u2014\nthere was not much room around.",
        "Q: Did you feel older than your age by that time, because of what you had been\ngoing through?",
        "A: Absolutely yeah. I didn\u2019t feel like a kid at all. I mean, all these things age \u2014 age\npeople pretty rapidly, and \u2014 and I remember that, you know, walking around with\nmy mother on the \u2014 on the streets and seeing people in \u2014 in terrible physical and\nmental condition, and dirty and broken down, and it was \u2014 it was very depressive.\nNovember 13, 1997",
        "Q: Did you feel any responsibility for your mother or your father, or did you feel\nthat they were still taking care of you? Had the \u2014 was it still a parent-child\nrelationship?",
        "A: It was still a parent-child relationship, essentially, yes. And my father was not a\npart of \u2014 you know, he was a take charge person, he was not a person who would \u2014\nwho would break down. In \u2014 in fact, you know, he was my hero, because he was\nvery brave man, as you will hear what happened there. What he did is he looked\naround for possibilities, and one possibility was to join the ghetto police. Now, the\nghetto police in Budapest was a very different from the ghetto police in Warsaw or\nLodz or any of these other places. This is now the middle of December in 1944.\nThe Russians are completely surrounding this place. The ghetto police\u2019s mission 1s\ndifferent. The ghetto police\u2019s mission, ridiculous as it may sound, was a defensive\nmission. They\u2019re supposed to persuade or \u2014 or \u2014 or fight off the Nazis coming into\nthe ghetto. And the means for that was a nightstick and a \u2014 and a Swiss beret and a\n\u2014 a armband, a white armband which says ghetto police in three different languages;\nHungarian, German and Russian [indecipherable] languages. And he had an I.D.\ncard saying he was ghetto police. Well, one of his lucky strokes was that he found,\nin the basement of the building where we stayed, a hardhat. These \u2014 you know,\nwhat \u2014 what the \u2014\nNovember 13, 1997",
        "Q: Construction workers?",
        "A: Construction workers wear. Actually, the firefighters. And he always wo-wore\nthat. That saved his life more than once. And the reason why he want to \u2014 or wanted\nto join the ghetto police force was that the ghetto police had double rations, and he\nwanted to bring the ration home. The policeman\u2019s life were very difficult. They\nwere on patrol 12 - 14 hours a day. And as I said, their mission was \u2014 their main\nmission was to try to fight off the Nazis. Well, you don\u2019t fight off people with\nmachine guns when they come in, and of course, they couldn\u2019t. Many of them died\nbecause of that. They tried to be polite to the Nazis, who simply let a\u2014a slug of \u2014a\nslug into them. There \u2014 a few days after we moved in, at night, we heard this\ntremendous noise and a huge crash. We found out that the shell, an artillery shell\nwas shot into the ghetto. We don\u2019t know who shot it, but it landed in the next room\nfrom where we were, and the people who were there, died. And it was a wall away\nfrom where we were, where my father, mother and I were. I got hysterical and I\nsaid, I\u2019m not staying up here, and my mother and I and Cotto(ph), who was with us,\nthe \u2014 the young lady who we met in Chango(ph), the three of us moved down to the\nbasement. The basement was very deep. It used to be the shop of wood maker and it\nwas covered with wood saw, and we just slept there. They had a couple of\nworkbenches there and I never moved out of that place after that happened. I never\nNovember 13, 1997\nneeded to move out because in about two days, the \u2014 which was Christmas day, the\nsiege of Budapest began, and everybody moved on. The food supply was\ncatastrophic. We had people who were old \u2014 and I mean old \u2014 battle hardened\nHungarian Jewish slave laborers, the remnants of the people who were taken out in\n1941. About a half a dozen of them ended up in our building. A number of them\nwere very religious Jews, and they were Hassids and they were praying all day long.\nA number of them were not too religious, but none of them were willing to risk\ntheir lives at that point to bring food. There were food available about a block or a\nblock and a half from where we lived, but somebody had to go there and get it. My\nfather always volunteered, but he was not enough just by himself, and a few people\nwent and some got hurt. And so our food supply, because of this, was very\nprecarious. People knew that the war couldn\u2019t la \u2014 end up \u2014 I mean, how long could\nyou live like this? There was no water, there was no electricity, gas, nothing. What\nwe had was about 200 people in a small basement, which had no electricity, with a\ncouple of slit windows eight feet high or nine feet high, and a couple of cans of\nfloor wax. I remember that I contributed one of my shoelaces as wicks and we put \u2014\nput it in the can and that was the \u2014 the light which 200 people had. My father \u2014 I\nhaven\u2019t s \u2014 you know, I \u2014 after the siege begun, my father was mostly out, he \u2014 he\ndidn\u2019t come home very often. One time I remember when he came in, he came in\nNovember 13, 1997\nonly for \u2014 for a few minutes. He came in with the good news that he found his own\nparents in the ghetto, and his parents were in reasonably good shape.",
        "Q: What were the sanitary conditions like in the basement in the ghetto?",
        "A: Well, the sanitary conditions were \u2014 were horrible. What they had to do was to\ndig a \u2014 a latrine in the middle of the room. And they had some old bed sheets, and\nthey got a couple of pieces of wood and you know, you sort of leaned against it\nwhen you had to do your thing. But the stench was unbearable. And then, because\nwe were very close together, people started to have lice, and because we were close\nproximity, everybody got it. And the way we \u2014 we lived there, we \u2014 we raided the\nbil \u2014 the upper part of the building and got the \u2014 the doors out and put the doors\ndown and the people essentially slept on the doors. We still had my father\u2019s\novercoat, who would have really needed it in his forays in \u2014 outside, but he didn\u2019t\nhave it because we were using it.",
        "Q: How did you keep yourself clean?",
        "A: We didn\u2019t, we couldn\u2019t. There was some little water, but 1t was negligible, and\nmost people just gave up on it. And you know, for the last two weeks, two or three\nweeks, it was just nominal washing. Some people tried to do it. Interestingly\nenough, the \u2014 the more well educated were the ones who sort of gave up; the least\nwell educated ones, who tried to keep their \u2014 their cleanliness. And it was a \u2014 1t was\nNovember 13, 1997\nan interesting Darwinian selection. One of the things which happened is that old\npeople died. They starved to death and we found them in the morning. And 1n a lull\nof fighting, a few men volunteered to bring them out of the building, and threw\nthem on a pile of dead bodies which were piling up in the middle of the square. I\nwent \u2014",
        "Q: Was it \u2014 was it easier for you by then to see dead bodies, since you had seen so\nmuch?",
        "A: No, it wasn\u2019t easier. I think it \u2014 it \u2014 it \u2014 1t never was \u2014 was easier for me. I \u2014 I\nknew that those people were alive a day before, and I knew them, I spoke to them,\nsome of them. I could never take this for granted. And I remember once when I \u2014\nwhen the lull in the fighting sort of persisted for an hour, I came out and I looked\nout and I saw this \u2014 this hill of bodies. And I knew that if something will not happen\nvery soon, we would all e-end up there. I did not \u2014 did not think that any one of us\nwould survive. And then January came, and we were all lethargic, we were sort of\nsitting there, weak. And tha \u2014 at that point there was very few who had any spark\nleft. And on the fourth of January, a group of about 30 or 35 young ladies, young\nwomen were brought in. Turned out that they were from Wallenberg\u2019s houses.\nWallenberg was very concerned that he could not really protect people any more at\nNovember 13, 1997\nthat point, and he decided that many of the people who were still alive there \u2014 his\nhouses were raided by the Nazis \u2014 he decided \u2014",
        "Q: What di \u2014 what did you \u2014 what had you heard about Raoul Wallenberg previous\nto this date?",
        "A: Very little. This was the first time that I heard of his name, from these people\nwho came from his house. I-I \u2014 most of the things which I knew about him, I\nlearned after the World War. I knew that Raoul Wallenberg was trying to save\npeople, and it wasn\u2019t just Wallenberg incidentally, but other people in\norganizations. We knew about the Swedes, we knew about the Swiss. We had, for\nexample what they call schutz passes, safe passages. The \u2014 they had forgeries by\nthe hundreds of thousands. Everybody had a couple of them in the pockets. We\ndidn\u2019t know whether they were real or forged. At that point, sometimes it helped,\nsometimes it didn\u2019t.",
        "Q: Did your family have any schutz passes?",
        "A: Yeah, we had \u2014 we had schutz passes. My mother had them, I had, my father\nhad.",
        "Q: How \u2014 how did they get them?",
        "A: I\u2014I guess at that point, they were given. They were given away by Jewish\norganizations. I sa\u2014 I\u2019m sad to say that some of the \u2014 the Jews did not give them\nNovember 13, 1997\naway for nothing, they \u2014 they made money on it. We were \u2014 we didn\u2019t have very\nmuch money, we never had Swedish passports, which was expensive. So we had the\nSwiss, which was cheap, or nothing. But it wasn\u2019t \u2014 it really didn\u2019t matter most of\nthe time. I mean, most of the Nazis really didn\u2019t look at the paper, they \u2014 they threw\naway. But sometimes you never knew whether it had or not. So \u2014 for some people it\nhad sometimes.",
        "Q: Did you ever have to show yours?",
        "A: We never had to show ours. We had it in our pocket, but we never had to show\nours.",
        "Q: Did your parents try to get into one of those safe houses?",
        "A: No. As I mentioned to you, our \u2014 our \u2014 our story was that my f\u2014 my mother and\nI stayed in the \u2014 in the re \u2014 in the yellow star house until we went into hiding. And\nthe only people who went into the safe houses were my grandparents \u2014 my \u2014 my\ngrandmother actually, and my grandmother\u2019s sisters who, through the good offices\nof Raoul Wallenberg were able to \u2014",
        "Q: I meant, did they try to get into any of the safe houses.",
        "A: No, they did not, no. Not that I know of. Remember, there was very little\ncommunication between people at this point, there were no telephones. Each house,\neach yellow star house was sort of an island. We did not know what happened to\nNovember 13, 1997\nfair \u2014 friends, relatives, anybody. And we did not know what was going on in the\noutside world. So at this point, this was the first time we knew about, or I f-found\nout about safe houses. I found out that these safe houses were no longer safe, and\nthese people were brought in. They were better fed than we were, but they were\nvery frightened. And we squeezed them in as everybody \u2014 at that point it was not\nthat much of a squeeze because most of the older people died already. So this was\nthe case. Tenth of January rolled around, and we were even weaker. A young SS\nsoldier came down. He was surveying the building. He told us that the whole ghetto\nis mined, that we will not survive, and just forget it. They will not allow the Jews to\nsurvive. The Russians were very close, but before the Russians would get there,\nthey would blow them up \u2014 blow the ghetto up. Turns out that \u2014 that the real plan\nwas even more sinister. I do not know whether the \u2014 this \u2014 this was really a fake\nStory or not.\nEnd of Tape Two, Side B\nNovember 13, 1997\nBeginning Tape Three, Side A",
        "Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\nvolunteer collection interview with George Pick. This is tape number three, side A.",
        "A: The \u2014 the real plan was more sinister than the one which the soldier disclosed to\nus, namely that they would blow up the ghetto. The real plan was to massacre us on\n\u2014 for the 16\" of January, there was a massacre in plan, 500 SS, a couple of hundred\nHungarian police. The number of Hungarian Nazis would come in with submachine\nguns, and would line us up essentially, and \u2014 and mow us down. It turned \u2014 turned\nout that fortunately, Wallenberg found out about it on the 15\", and he sent a\nmessage to the SS general. His name was Schmidhuber, that if this happens, he\nwould personally guarantee that Schmidhuber would be hung. Apparently\nSchmidhuber was a middle-aged man and he was now concerned about his own\nwelfare. And he called \u2014 called this action off. That obviously saved the people, my\nlife, my father\u2019s, mother\u2019s, my relatives and the 7,000 people who were still alive in\nthe ghetto. This was on the 15\" - 16\". There was one little girl in our building, her\nname was Alice. She was about eight years old, and she was a weak little kid. She\nwas not very alive. She had a mother, and a grandmother. The mother was diabetic,\nand the grandmother was also. And she came sometimes to play with me, but I\ndidn\u2019t like her that much. This day, on the 17\", she came not just to my mother, but\nNovember 13, 1997\nto everybody to beg for some food for her mother, who \u2014 who was in a diabetic\nshock. We had very little, namely and specifically, we had about a quarter of a\npound of sugar. As I mentioned earlier, when we left our house, our home, the\nJewish re \u2014 yellow star home to go into hiding, my mother took very little food with\nus. This food was shepherded along since November, now it\u2019s January. The la \u2014 the\n\u2014 the \u2014 a month of food which is left in that little bag 1s fa \u2014 is a half a pound of\nsugar. My mother kept it for me because she felt that maybe a few sugar cubes\nwould save my life if \u2014 if it all comes down to that. So my mother refused to give\nAlice any food. This was the 17\". On the 18\" of January in the morning \u2014 on the\nevening of the 17, my father came home and he decided to stay home. On the 18\"\nthere was a strange quiet. We didn\u2019t know what happened. It wasn\u2019t as quiet for \u2014\nfor weeks. I mean, this was a 24 hour a day artillery duel and bombing raid and we\ndidn\u2019t know how much was left over of that city. And all of a sudden it was \u2014 was\nstrange. So somebody climbed up to that slit window, about nine feet about the \u2014\nthe floor of the basement and saw some strange boots. They were not Nazi boots,\nthey were Russian boots, and we were liberated. There was no elation. We vid \u2014 we\nreally even didn\u2019t say anything to each other. It was fear that the Nazis would come\nback. Was indecision what to do next. The one thing we found out is that Alice\u2019s\nmother and grandmother were both dead, and my mother felt terribly guilty for the\nNovember 13, 1997\nnext 47 years of her life. Nobody could tell her that she was saving the food to her\nson, that was a choice between somebody whom she didn\u2019t know, and her own son,\nand there was really no choice in the matter. She felt still guilty til the day \u2014 day of\nher death. I remember that some of the younger people evaporated first. They didn\u2019t\nask, they didn\u2019t say anything. We didn\u2019t know what happened to the people whom\nwe knew. My father and mother decided that, around noontime, that it\u2019s time for us\nto leave. Both my mother and father were so weak that the little suitcase which we\nhad, which contained a half a pound of sugar and the family\u2019s pictures, they\ncouldn\u2019t carry. I was the one who carried them, I was the \u2014 the strongest one. My\nfather, who was 43 years old, looked like 70. And in his two or three weeks of\npatrol, he lost three of his partners, and he was more dead than alive. And then he \u2014\nwe Started to walk out of the ghetto, that was not \u2014 not an easy walk. There were\nvery few walkways there, half of the buildings were on the street. We heard the\nshrapnel zipping and making this awful noise above our heads. The artillery fire\nwas going on, the \u2014 the siege of Budapest was still going on. It took us three hours\nto get home, and we decided, like homing pigeons, to go back to our home from\nwhich we were thrown out by the Nazis in June of 1944. We went back, it took us\nthree hours, two and a half miles. We saw, in that journey, many dead bodies, many\ndead horses, and one live Russian. Which was almost ludicrous because this man\nNovember 13, 1997\nwas singing. He was singing, he wa \u2014 must have been drunk, but he \u2014 he had a\nhappy face, he was smiling and singing. And we looked at him as if he were crazy,\ninstead of the world. Maybe he was the ones \u2014 the only sane people in that \u2014 person\nin that whole \u2014 whole mad, maddening scene. And as we were walking, these\nshrapnels were hitting buildings, and whole walls came down, tumbling in front of\nus. I mean, we were in mortal danger, we \u2014 we were crazy to walk there, but we did.\nAnd we walked through the city park, and we were held up by a small group of\nRussians, who wanted us to, for all other things, break up the ice on the sidewalk. I\nmean, breaking up the ice, and he gave us these ice picks to do it. My father\ncouldn\u2019t lift it, you know, and he finally said well, forget it, and they gave us a loaf\nof bread. That was the first loaf of bread we have seen for more than a month. It\nwas \u2014 was a square loaf of bread, I remember. And they just let us go. And we\nstumbled home, and it was maybe four, five in the afternoon by the time we got\nthere. And the man whom we met first was Mr. Dudek(ph). Mr. Dudek(ph) was the\nman who was giving my father the paper under which he was able to work for\nyears, and who also hid a large suitcase full of food, which we left with him in June,\nand which he gave back to us. I remember the suitcase was a green suitcase, 1t was a\ncanvas, but it was full of canned food. He didn\u2019t take any. But the rest of the people\nwho lived there were rather frightened. They looked at us as if we were ghosts. Not\nNovember 13, 1997\njust because of our physical appearance, but because of their bad conscious. Here\nthese Jews came back. Now what will happen? There were \u2014 we knew about those\nextreme Nazis, Mr. Drexler(ph), who was \u2014 who was boasting about his adventures\nwith the Hassidic Jews whose \u2014 whose beard he cut off and whose stomach he filled\nwith \u2014 with pork. And some others, who were no less guilty. They thought they will\n\u2014 that we were going to denounce them to the Russians. We were too tired, too sick\nto \u2014 too nothing to \u2014 to do anything. The miracle which happened to us was that a\nfew hours later my \u2014 my maternal grandmother came home. Turned out that she\nwas in the ghetto. And revenge was the furthest from our minds. My grandmother\nwas born in what is now Slovakia, so she spoke the language. Russian troops came\ndown, everybody was frightened of them. We found out that they came a few days\nearlier, raped a few women. But my grandmother spoke their language and they\nwere very, very friendly. And I remember that Mr. Dudek(ph) made room for us,\nand on the evening of the 18\" of January, we s \u2014 we went to sleep in another\nbasement, in another part of town, and the siege of Budapest was still on. In fact, it\nwas still on for more than a month, because Buda was still defended by the Nazis\nfor a month after Pest was liberated. The life came back slowly. The first thing we\ntried to do is to get some food somewhere. My father found a rucksack somewhere\nand went out and scrounged for frozen potatoes, whatever. We had this suitcase full\nNovember 13, 1997\nof food, which helped a great deal for the next few weeks. But of course it doesn\u2019t \u2014\nyou know, I mean, we were \u2014 my father was like 90 pounds, my mother was like\nthat too and my grandmother too, and so we really needed to eat something. There\nwas very little food. There were no utilities. Water came about because we were the\nfru \u2014 we had the ice, you know, in the \u2014 in the yard and we cut it up and boiled it \u2014\nboiled it with water, or whatever.",
        "Q: What was your physical condition like?",
        "A: My physical condition was the best of the three of us, cause if there was food, I\nate it. | was weak, but maybe not as weak as my mother and father. And I probably\nbounced back in a couple of weeks. We lived in the basement there, and we were\ntrying to find some other arrangements. As the end of February rolled around and\nBuda was liberated, people were free to move back up. Our old apartment was\noccupied; they gave it to another family. But the apartment next door, which was\nthe apartment of the Surka\u2019s(ph), the man who was a professional soldier and\nwhose two daughters I used to play with, they went to the west, they left, and their\napartment was empty. So Mr. Dudek(ph), the super, suggested that we would go\nand occupy that place. At that point it was like catcher\u2019s catch can. A number of\napartments were also burned out by shells. That particular apartment was in fairly\ngood shape, so we went up and we occupied it. Many months later, the Surkas\nNovember 13, 1997\ncame back. There was a law by that time that if somebody occupied an apartment\nfor more than a certain number of months, they were the owners of it. So the\nSurkas(ph) couldn\u2019t have a claim. They were a sad lot when they came back and I\nfelt very sorry. The yo \u2014 the older daughter died. They went to the west. The father\nwas a Soldier, they got liberated and they came back, and then they disappeared. I\ndon\u2019t know whether they left Hungary or not, but at that time \u2014 this was in May or\nJune of 1945, and that was the last time I saw them. Our next door neighbors who\nlived in number five, they stayed and \u2014 and most of the neighbors who \u2014 who \u2014\nwhom we knew before the war, stayed there. There were some new neighbors, some\npeople left, but all in all, we had about 20 apartments in this apartment house, about\n15 of them were familiar faces. So what happened next? In March, the schools\nopened, and my mother and father and I decided that I\u2019m going to go to the Jewish\nhigh school. It opened in the \u2014 what used to be the rabbinic seminary, the old\nbuilding which was in Aboni(ph) Street was not given back at that point. And\npeople somehow, and I don\u2019t know how, they got the news that it \u2014 school\u2019s garin \u2014\ngoing to be open, life is going to start again. In the beginning, in March, there were\nno streetcars, so it was like an hour and a half walk each way. My mother \u2014",
        "Q: Was the school in \u2014 in Pest?\nNovember 13, 1997",
        "A: In Pest. In the middle of Pest. We lived in Zuglo, which is sort of outside. Say\nwas about a good three miles, three and a half miles from where the school was. So\nevery morning we got up fairly early, and my mother and I \u2014 my mother took my\nhand and we walked to the school. And every \u2014 and then she waited for me in front,\nand then when it \u2014 school was ended, she took me back, we had the same walk. And\nmy mother became such a familiar face that the \u2014 the teachers all knew her and they\ninvited her and then sort of she said \u2014 there were some mothers, not all of them\nwere like that. But some of the mothers whose sons were all \u2014 whose \u2014 this was a\nJewish gymnasium for boys, boys\u2019 gymnasium. We had a girls\u2019 gymnasium also,\nbut this was the boys\u2019 gymnasium. And so we started out fairly large, we had about\n72 students in my class, two [indecipherable] classes. I was happy to see some\nfriendly fa \u2014 and \u2014 faces from the elementary school. But we found out, very sadly,\nthat the \u2014 the orphans did not survive. What happened to the orphans, one day they\n\u2014 they raided this orphanage and took out those orphans who were my classmates,\n10 of them, with the teacher and took them to the Danube and they shot them. So\nthey didn\u2019t \u2014 they didn\u2019t survive. But many of our classmates who were in\nelementary school did, and \u2014 and we saw them \u2014 I saw them in the gymnasium. It\nwas very primitive in the beginning, we didn\u2019t have anything, it was just an empty\nschool building. And the educ \u2014 and th \u2014 and many of the teachers didn\u2019t come back\nNovember 13, 1997\nfrom deportation, or from school yet. They sort of trickled back throughout that \u2014\nfrom March to June. That was a very truncated year. It was supposed to start, of\ncourse, 1n September of \u201944, end in June of \u201945. Well, it never started, but it ended\nin June of \u00b045 anyway. And by then, the streetcars started to run, and by then life\nstarted to trickle back. We got a telegram in early June, I believe, from America,\nfrom the United States, from my uncle, the one who wanted to adopt me, telling us\nthat they found us through the Red Cross somehow, and that they\u2019ll happy that we\nare survive \u2014 that we survived, and th-that he and his wife had a son who was born\nin 1944, and they are fine and happy and we should write to them, and we did. And\nwe started corresponding and this \u2014 they sen \u2014 they said they would send us papers.\nBut my father decided against it. He felt that Hungary is going to be a good\ncountry now. And indeed, after the war there were some possibilities. My father\nrestarted his business. It looked like there was going to be a democracy. People\nwere \u2014 were having some hope. Many of the surviving Jews decided to join the\ncommunist party, my father and mother joined the social democrats. And some of\nthe people were out for revenge. Many of them decided to join the political police\nand they were after the Nazis. Kormus(ph), for example survived, became a head\nof a people\u2019s court, and as such, his mission was to put away as many Nazis as\npossible. And he accomplished it. My father was not that kind, and my mother was\nNovember 13, 1997\nneither, and we sort of tried to reconstruct whatever we could. We looked around\nthe neighborhood, we found that some of our furniture was not do \u2014 too far from\nwhere it originated from, and we got it back from the neighbors. And we just tried\nto rebuild our lives, somehow.",
        "Q: By that time, when you had gotten your strength back and had food and so forth\nand school had started, by then did you feel free, and feel liberated?",
        "A: Ina sense, yes. I think it took me a long time to really feel liberated. Probably\n1946. I remember 1945, and I remember the first of May of 1945, which was a huge\ndemonstration by the social democrats and the communists. And I remember the\nstruggle, the political struggles.",
        "Q: You \u2014 you mean a May Day celebration?",
        "A: May Day celebration and the political struggles for power. I now also knew that\nmost of the communist leaders who came back from Moscow were Jewish. Rocco\nShagerra(ph), Farkosh(ph). And most of the Jews were not unsympathetic. Some\nof them were. Obviously the \u2014 the ones who were rich before, saw that the\ncommunists are not going to retain them as \u2014 as capitalists again. But my family\nwas never really rich. My father was a \u2014 an engineer, he figured he would be able to\ndo business, he would be able to find a job, and we were not very worried. In fact,\nin 1945, Dudek(ph) \u2014 my father was able to reward Dudek(ph) and Dudek(ph) not\nNovember 13, 1997\nonly saved some of our food, but he also saved some of my father\u2019s material, you\nknow, ma \u2014 business, and so my father gave him half of it, and they started out a\nbusiness, a little business right in the building. Dudek(ph) was not a good\nbusinessman, so he \u2014 he didn\u2019t do very well, but my father was, and \u2014 and he started\nto deal with the same people he dealt with du \u2014 before the war. And it was a good\ntime. I mean, inflation was there for sure, but there were possibilities. And these\npossibilities ended in 1947. What were the possibilities? Well, one was, you know,\nwe were Jewish and the Joint from the United States had sent food and things,\nclothing. I remember in 19 \u2014 I believe it was the summer of \u201946, and I went to a\ncamp which was run by the Joint and Zionists. And I was not a Zionist myself. We\nhad a lot of Zionists in our \u2014 in our school, and many of the teachers were Zionists,\nand they had socialist Zionists, such as the Hashomer Hatzair, and then they had\nOrthodox. And one of the things which bothered me is that there was some\nanimosity and definite animosity between both the teachers and the students who\nwere of various persuasions. I remember a particular teacher who didn\u2019t like\nOrthodox Jews and who hit them, hit their heads, to hit their hats off and \u2014 and\nthings like that, and I could never understand it. After \u00b044, how could a Jew hit\nanother Jew because the Jew wears a hat? And there were some very passionate\ndiscussions about, you know, Hashomer Hatzair and Irgun and all these others.\nNovember 13, 1997\nAnd Betar and \u2014 and whoever else. And some people who were orphans \u2014 many of\nmy students \u2014 fellow students were orphans, moved into these Zionist camps, these\nlittle \u2014 they had houses. And they lived like \u2014 like \u2014 they were told that they were\nlike adults, I mean, 13 - 14 year old kids, they were adults, they could do anything\nthey wanted to. And I was fortunate enough to have my parents, and in a sense I\nwas a little bit jealous that they could do anything and I wasn\u2019t. I was still a son, and\nI was still a child. And despite \u201944, you know, I \u2014 in a sense I reverted back to\nchildhood. I couldn\u2019t accompli \u2014 completely in a hundred percent, but \u2014 but largely,\nand I was expected to. And I was expected to forget about all those things. And it\nbeen \u2014 and it had been bothering me for a long time, you know, what do you\nremember, how could you remember, you were too young. And the authenticity of\nthese remembrances were always questioned, not by me, but by others. But life\nwent on and we were told, you know, that we shouldn\u2019t dwell on the Holocaust, we\nshouldn\u2019t dwell on this. We shouldn\u2019t \u2014",
        "Q: When you say we were told, you mean your parents told you that, or other\npeople told you?",
        "A: My parents told me, but mostly other people, and the \u2014 and th \u2014 and the\nnewspapers, and the \u2014 an-and the school, you know, now you have to learn, now\nyou are back to school. Now you worry about your homework, now you worry\nNovember 13, 1997\nabout your exams. Now you do things. You know, we joined first the Boy Scouts,\nand then when the Boy Scouts were disbanded, the Young Pioneers. And there was\nalways something to do. There was some excitement too, I mean, how did we \u2014 how\ndid we build \u2014 rebuild our lives? What do we \u2014 what did we do? How did we do it?\nAnd as I mentioned, I was taken to one of these camps, Zionist camps, I was \u2014 we\nhad four languages in the same time, and I was never a good linguistic expert. We\nhad Hebrew, Latin, English, and for a while German, but then that was dropped.\nBut three languages were more than enough for me, and I was not very good in\neither of those. And the only way I could not flunk Hebrew is that the \u2014 I promised\nmy Hebrew teacher that I was going to go to a Zionist camp. And they took me and\nI was unhappy and I s \u2014 I escaped. I escaped after about a week. Went home, my\nfather was very upset with me. He felt that I was just a coward, that I just couldn\u2019t\ndo it. I disagreed with him. But these things were not for me, I was \u2014 I was too\nmuch of a mother\u2019s boy still, and I was still with my mother. I was only 12 years\nold, I mean, it\u2019s not that I was \u2014 and this camp was not exactly what you would call\na camp here, it was hard. And we didn\u2019t get that much food, and the food was\nmostly split pea soup, which reminded me of the ghetto, which was the only food\nthere. But I had friends, and I started to \u2014 to form relationships. But I didn\u2019t have\ntoo many friends of my own age. The building we le \u2014 lived in had a \u2014 a number of\nNovember 13, 1997\nyoung girls who were older than I was. I was always attracted to young girls, and I\nwas \u2014 these young girls were 16 - 17 - 18. And I was more mature than my age and\nI started to have \u2014 sort of strike up conversations with them. And I thought that I\nwas enough of an intellectual challenge to \u2014 to talk to, to be talked to. And our next\ndoor neighbor was a \u2014 her name was Miriam. She was not Jewish, she was 16 and\nshe was telling me about the facts of life, and there was another girl downstairs who\nwas \u2014 she was \u2014 her \u2014 her name was Maurika(ph) and she was 18 and she was a\nvery studious girl and we had nice, interesting conversation about \u2014 conversations\nabout literature and art and music and things like that. Of course, they all had their\nboyfriends, but I sort of fancied myself as being somehow a sutroga \u2014 surrogate\nboyfriend and \u2014 and was there. And so my \u2014 my \u2014 my life, my social life sort of\nstarted to evolve among these people, my neighbors. And many of my friends, too.\nAnd then I got involved in the Young Pioneers, and some other various\norganizations. There was one organization, Young Workers. They were usually\nthree, four years older than I was, and they were not Jewish. And once I got into a \u2014\na real fight with them, and they told me that I was just a dirty little Jew, and they\nchased me out and chased me to \u2014 through the streets. And I \u2014 sort of 1t occurred to\nme that, my God, you know, these people are the same. They are not \u2014 they are not\ndifferent any more. They are just the same. They are still calling me dirty Jew two\nNovember 13, 1997\nyears after the war, and they are still chasing me down the street. And then I had\nsome doubts whether it was a good idea to stay in \u2014 in Hungary. But these doubts\nwere not, at this point were not very bad and very pronounced. This was 1947. We\nhad a\u2014 an election and the communists came in distant fourth. We still had a\ndemocratic government.",
        "Q: Did you have a Bar Mitzvah?",
        "A: [had a Bar Mitzvah. My Bar Mitzvah was an interesting one. It \u2014 in Budapest\nthere were two orphanages, a girl orphanage and a boy orphanage. The girl or-\norphanage was very close to where we lived, so \u2014 and they had, of course, a shul.\nAnd Rabbi Schwartz was the rabbi there, and he instructed me. In 1947, I had the\nBar Mitzvah there. And my mother decided that I would have a Bar Mitzvah lunch,\nand well, what can you do with a lu \u2014 for a lunch, you know? I invited the following\npeople; there were a couple of communist kids in school, they were about three\nyears older than I was, but they were friends. And there was a fellow who was a\nfriend of mine who was sort of a literary guy. And then a few friends,\ncontemporaries. And I borrowed two girls from the orphanage, they came also. And\nwe had a very nice lunch, and the adults were in the other room. That was my Bar\nMitzvah. And I remember, I got a book, which I still have. It\u2019s in Hungarian, of\ncourse. It\u2019s about Jewish Middle Ages. It\u2019s about Spain, the Spanish Jewish Middle\nNovember 13, 1997\nAges. And it was by Roth, Sir ce \u2014 Sir Cecile Roth, famous historian. I didn\u2019t read\nthe book, 1t was way above my head at that time, but for some reason or another, I \u2014\nI got it\u2014 my mother got it out of Hungary, and I found it many years later and I\nread it with much interest, and I still have it. My Bar Mitzvah present. And then a\nstupid thing happened. A friend of mine was tackling me in school, right after my\nBar Mitzvah and pushing me back and my shin broke. And so, I missed about two\nweeks or three weeks of class. I was in a cast for six weeks. And after the cast my\nfather and mother decided that I should go to a camp, a real camp. And they send\nme to this camp, which was run by Jews. Was run by a Olympic \u2014 Jewish Olympic\nwrestling champion by the name of Karpathi(ph), and it was called a Karpathi(ph)\ncamp, it was a sports camp. And most of the kids were Jewish and I had a great time\nthere. And it was three weeks. I didn\u2019t escape there \u2014 from there. I learned how to\nbike again, because for some reason I forgot, and how to swim and how to do all\nthose things; how to dance. There was a girl there who was 18 years old and who\nwas really the owner. Karpathi(ph) was sort of the manager. Kerienyi(ph), who\nwas another wrestler, was the owner. And Judith was her \u2014 his daughter, and she\nwas up there, sort of helping out with the kids. And I got very, very friendly with\nher, and we talked, and she was engaged to another wrestler, to be married. And she\nfigures in my later life, that\u2019s why I\u2019m telling you this. Anyway, Judith and I\nNovember 13, 1997\nbecame friends and even after the camp I saw her many times and then we lost in\ntouch maybe a half a year or so later. Five years passed by, and I met her again.\nAnd I\u2019m going to cut this story, because there will be some significance at that\npoint. But now we are still in 1947 \u2014 1947 and 1948. I had a happy education,\nparticularly in one particular subject, which was history. My homeroom teacher and\nmy history teacher was one and the same, he was a young ma-man named Paul\nPoch(ph). He turned out to be one of the great historians of Hungary, and he was\nvery young man and he \u2014 one of his claim to fame was that he was also the director\nof the statistical survey run by the Joint, of the [indecipherable] remnants. And you\nfind a copy of the book in our library. What they did is 400 people, in 1945, in\nAugust of \u201945, went through every building of Budapest and found the\n[indecipherable] remnants of \u2014 of Jews in Budapest. Found 68,000 of them. There\nwere \u2014 there were probably more, but many of them did not want to be registered.\nMy family and I were \u2014 my family\u2019s name and my name were \u2014 are in the book.\nPoch(ph) was the one who did it. Besides that, he was a brilliant teacher and he was\nmy homeroom teacher for four years, and I wanted to be a historian. Poch(ph) left\nthe school because he became a professor, a full professor at age 28 in the\nUniversity of Budapest in the \u2014 the economic university of Budapest. A few years\nlater he became the \u2014 the dean, and a few years after that he became director. Then\nNovember 13, 1997\nhe became a absolute world class historian. The one thing which he did however, is\nthat he completely changed his point of view, he became a Marxist economic\nhistorian. And he wa \u2014 he became one of their authority. And \u2014 but he was a\nhumane person, and one of the interesting part was that one of the classes he taught\nin the Jewish high school, who graduated in 1948 - \u201949, of that class, three men\nwent to his \u2014 his faculty. They became very famous historians. One of them became\nthe president of the Academy of Sciences, his name is Ivan Berendt. He came to\nthis country, he\u2019s now a professor of history in UCLA, and Poch(ph) helped him\nand helped others. Helped one man by the name of Rankey(ph), who became a \u2014 a\n\u2014 an authority on Hungarian Holocaust.\nEnd of Tape Three, Side A\nBeginning Tape Three, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\nvolunteer collection interview with George Pick. This is tape number three, side B.",
        "A: I was saying that Rankey(ph) was not a communist. He was \u2014 he became a\nHolocaust expert, historian. And because of that his \u2014 his career during the\ncommunist ye-years was really jeopardized. Poch(ph) helped him a great deal, and\nhe helped others. So although Poch became a communist, he was still a \u2014 a great\nhuman being and helped a great deal of \u2014 great many men and people in their \u2014 in\nNovember 13, 1997\ntheir career. So I must say that I am personally very thankful to him and grateful,\nbecause for one, he taught me the love of history, which 1s \u2014 which I wanted to\nbecome my \u2014 my profession. Thankfully which did not become my profession, but\na lifetime hobby. 1948, Poch(ph) leaves and a number of other teachers leave the\nschool. Passover, Pesach, nine four \u2014 1948. We say goodbye to many of our friends\nwho went to a camp, Zionist camp. After Pesach, our s \u2014 our class of 38 became\nclass of 13. The rest of the people left. We found that they went through the Bricha\nlea(ph) to Israel. Many of them are still there. And we stayed \u2014 I wasn\u2019t a Zionist \u2014\nwith this small, shrinking class. They combined the other class with us, which also\nshrunk, and of the 72 people, we had now a class of roughly 30, a combined class of\n30. We had other teachers. Some teachers left with the Bricha, some teachers\nstayed. I became very interested in acting. We had a little acting group in our\nschool. I became interested. We had put on full three act plays. My father became\ninterested in this school. He wanted to help the school. He found out that the school,\nof course, lost most of its labs, and he wanted to raise money, so he figured a \u2014a\nway to ask famous performers to come to the school for nothing, and have\nfundraisings. And he became involved in many of these kinds of fundraisings. And\nyou would not believe the most famous singers came to sing; Jews and non-Jews\nalike, and they are always sold out performances, and my father was really a great\nNovember 13, 1997\nenterprise [indecipherable] and \u2014 and got enough money to rebuild the physics and\nbiological libr \u2014 labs. And in 1950 or \u201951, they dedicated a greenhouse on the top of\nthe building which my father raised money for. And so my father became the\npresident, or the P.T. and then my mother was very involved and I became involved\nwith the \u2014 on a student level. And it was from \u00b048 to \u201950 - \u00b052. They were \u2014 despite\nof the fact that \u2014 that there were \u2014 th-there were terrors, and \u2014 and \u2014 and worsening\npolitical situation and crisis, there was an island there. The school became a \u2014a\nseparate island, where we had a dicono \u2014 dichotomy where we shared both what we\nneeded to share, such as you know, what you needed to talk about, you know, the\ngreat communist camp, and the [indecipherable] the imperialist camp and all this\nphraseology, which we had to also say, but then we talked about what was the\nVoice of America saying, you know? So it was a really funny, ironic situation. The\nsame people who were parroting the phraseology were talking about the Voice of\nAmerica. And the teachers who had to parrot the phraseology also, Marxist\nphraseology, which they didn\u2019t believe in, who were Hebrew teachers before he\nbeca \u2014 they became Marxist, quote unquote, teachers, who were teaching Yiddish\ninstead of Russian, which they ended up teaching for a while, you know? These\nteachers knew that this is a big joke, that nobody believes in this, but we pretended\nthat something had to be done, and \u2014 and we did. Except for \u2014\nNovember 13, 1997",
        "Q: Di-Did the tightening of the government, or what you had to do, did that bring\nback any memories of the war?",
        "A: Well, it certainly did. Of course, the \u2014 the tightening of the government, and the\n\u2014 the loss of rights brought back a lot of memories. And people who were deported\nduring the Holocaust, were deported again. This time not because they were Jewish,\nbut because they were capitalists, and capitalists couldn\u2019t live in Budapest, so they\ntook the \u2014 took away their \u2014 their homes and they deported them to the countryside.",
        "Q: Did that make you more nervous?",
        "A: It absolutely did, but there was no choice in the matter now, of course, that the\nIron Curtain was shut. In 1948, after the Bricha, and very shortly thereafter when\nthe communists took power, things were over. And by then, of course, those of us\nwho recognized too late, and too belatedly that we were pretty stupid again, we\nwere there. So what could you do, you know? Well, what you could do was what\nwe did, which is to go along outwardly, and go to the May celebrations and the\nNovember celebrations, and at the same time talk about BBC and Radio Free\nEurope and trying to keep each other in \u2014 in a Jewish era. We were \u2014 we were still\nstudying \u2014 not legally at this point \u2014 Jewish things, Jewish history.",
        "Q: Did you feel more Jewish now than you had many years ago?\nNovember 13, 1997",
        "A: Absolutely. In the next \u2014 in the first two years after the war, Jewish gymnasium\nmeant that we were not studying, we were \u2014 we do not have Saturday classes, but\ninstead we had to go to the synagogue. So we did. That wasn\u2019t a pleasant thing for\nme, I was never a synagogue goer. But it made me want to know more Jewish\nhistory. It made me much more of a conscious Jew. And after the communist\ntakeover, the synagogue was closed, we couldn\u2019t \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the synagogue of the\n\u2014 the gymnasium was closed, it was no longer there. So \u2014 but \u2014 but we still had\nsome spark, and \u2014 and many times the spark was nothing more than, I know you are\nJewish and you know that I am Jewish, and you can trust me. And that was not\nalways the case, unfortunately, although I think we always knew whom we could\ntrust, within the school. We knew that there were a few people who \u2014 who we could\nnot, including teachers. And this came to a head in 1950. In 1950, there was a letter,\nwhich was drafted by a teacher and a student, which was circulated in the school,\ndemanding of the government of nationalizing our school. And they tried to\nintimidate the students and the teachers. And it came to a head because there was a\nconference, a te \u2014 a teacher-student-parent conference. And it was supposed to be a\nsecret letter, but somebody told that \u2014 the principal of what was going on. And this\n\u2014all hell broke loose. And I was there and I remember. There was a parent of a\nclassmate of mine whose \u2014 who told the students and the teacher, who did not want\nNovember 13, 1997\nto identify himself, that they are cowards, they are damn cowards, and they are\ntraitors. And it was really embarrassing because this was a communist inspired\nthing, you know. And this was toward the end of the school year, and in the next\nschool year, we had from 200 students, to 45, including the teacher who was \u2014 who\n\u2014 whom we found out was a\u2014 was a defector. And he left, he became a principal\nsomewhere else, and all these students. But I stayed, and 45 of us stayed. Our class\nof 30 became a class of 13. This was our sixth grade, 1t was junior high school. And\nwe stayed, and we became more Jewish, although outwardly we could do less. We\ncouldn\u2019t talk about Jewish history. We couldn\u2019t talk about Jewish things. But we\ncould talk about books written by Stefan Zweig and Berfer(ph). And we could\nsabotage learning Russian, for example. An ex-rabbi was teaching us Russian, who\ndid not know from Russian from a hole in the head. I mean, he was always a \u2014a\nlesson ahead of us, but that was it. And \u2014 and we took this as a joke, inside. But we\nrealized more and more, and more and more keenly that this island for us, is going\nto come to an end. And then what? And that end came in 1952, when I graduated.\nNow one of the motivations of the \u2014 all of my classmates who left, was that\nnobody\u2019s going to be accepted in a university from a parochial school such as the\nJewish gymnasium. That was the motivation why they left. It turned out very\nironically, that out of the two \u2014 four \u2014 13 of us who graduated, 11 of us were\n100November 13, 1997\naccepted. Because the regime in 1952 wanted to show the world that there was such\na thing as religious freedom. Much less of the people who left were accepted,\npercentage-wise. The only two who were not, were bad students, period, who didn\u2019t\neven want to go to school. I was accepted. And here came the big shock. The big\nculture shock, because I was trusting to the university, the technical university,\nBudapest, where we had a class of 1200 people, from 13 to 1200. And we had this\nhuge theater and we were sitting there, you know, men and women. And I found\nmyself in \u2014 very much in a minority. This was the year where it made a difference\nwho\u2019s \u2014 who your parents were; if your parents were peasants or workers, you got\naccepted regardless of your qualifications. If your parents were businessmen, you\nwat \u2014 you were rejected. My father was in-between, and I sort of, because he was a\n\u2014 what they call an intellectual, or a professional, that was not well thought of, but it\nwas better than a businessman for sure. My father wasn\u2019t a businessman by then, he\nworked for another company. And so in \u2014 I was able to slip in on this, but I found\nmy colleagues to be very different from me. The chemistry worked there. Very\nquickly we found from each other \u2014 0-of each other, who were Jewish. Of the f\u2014 of\nthe 1200, roughly about 150 of us were Jewish, which was a large percentage. And\nas I says, the magic of chemistry, I mean, we didn\u2019t know from Adam. We found\nus, each other and we drifted toward each other. The way the school were \u2014 was\n101November 13, 1997\ndivided up, we had subspecialties within mechanical engineering \u2014 this was only\nmechanical engineering. We had specialties on textile engineering, shipbuilding,\nwhatever else. And in my subspecialty, which was naval archy \u2014 naval architecture,\nwe had 30 people, I was the only Jew, and the rest of them were not. And we were\nsort of drifting in and out. I was \u2014 I was never really very friendly with these people\nbecause their culture, their \u2014 their interests were very different from me. I felt sorry\nfor them because they were not really qualified and they were really struggling with\nthe material. They didn\u2019t know elementary algebra when they had to learn calculus,\nand they really had a heck of a hard time, although the regime gave them all sorts of\nscholarships and stuff. I have to step back now because there is a \u2014 an important\nthing which happened in my life, right before graduation, personally. And that \u2014\nwhat happened was that I fell in love, 18 years old. This was right before graduation\nin February of 1952. Fell in love with a young girl who didn\u2019t understand my \u2014 my\nfeelings, and I was very brokenhearted when my feelings were not reciprocated.\nAnd I was so brokenhearted that I fell sick. They thought I had mononucleosis and\nother diseases and I was in the hospital for a month. And this was in February -\nMarch of *52, just before graduation. And my wa \u2014 mother and father were worried\nthat I was going to se \u2014 lose that year. But my colleagues were very nice and they\nbrought me up to date very f\u2014 very fast. Then April roll \u2014 rolled along, and walking\n102November 13, 1997\non the street, in a nice, bright, April afternoon, I met this girl who was very familiar.\nMade a long story short, it was the girl, Judith Kerienyi(ph), whom I met five\nyears earlier in a camp. Then we started to talk, she was, at this point, just\ngraduating from college. She became a singer, she never married. Didn\u2019t marry the\n\u2014 broke off with the fianc\u00e9, and she was single. I was 18, she was 22 - 23. And it\nwas a romance, and it was maybe an antidote to the love, the unrequited love I had\nbefore. It became a very hot romance, not to my mother\u2019s liking and my father\u2019s\nliking, who felt that I should really learn and study. The way it went in our school\nsystem is that we finished the school early, in May, and then we had six weeks of\nreal study, after which we had a five hour oral exam. And it was almost like a PhD\nthing. And the six weeks we supposed to cram in everything we need to know about\nthe oral. And we had these little [indecipherable] things, they had hundreds of\nquestions. We knew the questions, we just needed to learn the answers. Of course,\nthat was the trick, you know, you can\u2019t learn eight years of answers in two months.\nYou really had to learn some other things. But at that point, you know, the \u2014 the\nsummer was full blown and \u2014 and I was too interested in \u2014 in \u2014 in everything,\nmostly Judith, and less interested in the study. But I studied a little. And \u2014 and it\nwas just the hottest romance we had. It was sort of crazy. The \u2014 her parents worked,\nmy parents worked, so both of our apartments were vacant during the day and we\n103November 13, 1997\ntook advantage of it. And it was my real \u2014 first real romance. I mean, I had some\nsex before, but they were occasional type things, mostly prostitutes. This was really\na woman. I didn\u2019t know what \u2014 and she didn\u2019t know how to handle it either. Which\nwas too bad because she was 22, I was 18. If I didn\u2019t know how to handle it, well,\nthat was something, but she \u2014 she should have known better. Made a longer story\nshort, she became pregnant, and of course, my father and I didn\u2019t see eye to eye\nthrough this. I wanted to marry her, of course, it was moral obligation. My fa \u2014 my\nmother told me the same. My father said absolutely not, I am \u2014 you are a minor. In\n\u2014in Hungary you were a minor until 21, and I\u2019m not giving your permission and\nthat\u2019s that. Make the long story short, we didn\u2019t marry and she had an abortion. And\nthere is a letter which I still possess, which my mother wrote to Judith, where it\nwas a woman to woman letter; a very sad one, in fact. And saying that, you know,\nshe understands the \u2014 the pain and the sorrow. But she has to understand that I am\ntoo young and I am just starting my \u2014 my schooling, and she should have known\nbetter. And that romance stayed with me for a long time. That was really a very\npotent one in many different respects, and I never forgot it. It was a happy ending, if\nyou want, because she had an abortion, and then she got married and she has\nchildren. Nothing bad happened to her. But perhaps I am kidding myself, I don\u2019t\nknow. And I went on to school, and I had this \u2014 and I had another girlfriend about a\n104November 13, 1997\nyear later, who was more to my level of interest maybe, and same age as I was. And\nthe shock went on for four years, from 1952 to \u201956. I had the same girlfriend this\ntime, Erica was her name. And we had a tempestuous relationship. But there was a\n\u2014 there was something important which happened, not just with her but with my\ncircle of \u2014 small circle of friends. We still kept going to \u2014 to \u2014 to operas. We went to\ntheater. We kept a cultural core, which the country in itself did not, you know, they\n\u2014 they sort of sank into this Bolshevik slide. But we kept a western level of culture,\nand I think that kept our humanity, too, in a \u2014 1n a great degree. Between 1952 and\n\u201956, times were hard, and I was working very hard in \u2014 in school, trying to earn my\ncollege tuition, which I did. We were not rich, and I really needed to work. In the\nsummertime, I did. I went to \u2014 this was not my choice, I had to do work once \u2014 one\nmonth every summer, work \u2014 we got paid \u2014 in industry. And one month every\nsummer, we had to go to the \u2014 to the army. And I had a hard time in the army, I\nmust tell you. Both \u2014 I had three summers which I had to go to the army, and all\nthose three summers were very, very hard for me, I was not cut out to be a soldier.\nAnd that in is \u2014 in itself a story of itself, but I\u2019m not going to go in there. Fifty-six\ncame around. The winds of change started to be felt, and then tragedy struck. My\nfather all of a sudden got sick and died. He got celebra \u2014 cerebral hemorrhage. He\nwas a chain smoker, and finally got to him. This was at the end of March, right\n105November 13, 1997\nduring my period of exams, final exams. And I was very scared, and I didn\u2019t know\nhow to handle it. I was 22. I had a ver \u2014 a very good friend, his name was\nDionege(ph) Brock(ph), he was stud \u2014 he was studying to be a rabbi; in fact, he was\nalready a \u2014 an ordained rabbi and I asked him what he thinks, what he thought. He\nknew Erica very well, he knew me very well. He was a very, very close friend. He\nsort of said look, I think you should pull together. You should have a better \u2014 a\nbigger family. You should really be not one \u2014 I mean you \u2014 my family, my real\nfamily was not very close knit, particularly after my father died. In fact, even in the\nlast few years before my father died, my mother and father sort of drifted apart, and\nI drifted apart from my father. And I drifted \u2014 the only person I had close was my\nmother. I had a couple of cousins I wasn\u2019t that friendly with. My maternal\ngrandmother died. My paternal grandparents still had this family gathering every\nSunday, but after 18 I didn\u2019t want to go. I found them strange, I had nothing to say\nto them. So here, after my father died, I had literally very few people to go to. And I\nwas scared, so Erica\u2019s family, she had a sister and mother, father; they were very\nnice people, I liked them, and I liked Erica. And \u2014 and essentially I felt that maybe\nthis 1s the time when \u2014 when I should have my own, and then I engaged \u2014 I became\nengaged to her. And we had an engagement in August. And we were planning to get\nmarried after I graduated from school, which was at the fall of 1956. It was going to\n106November 13, 1997\nbe in October of \u201956. And in fact, in October of \u201956 \u2014 I just completed my last exam\non the 22\u2122 of October. The 23\" of October became a notable day, but for me the\n224 was the \u2014 the real clincher. There was a meeting late in the afternoon, right\nafter my exam, where I went to, student meeting, which lasted until three o\u2019clock in\nthe morning, and which, at the end, we declared that Hungary must be an\nindependent state and should declare neutrally \u2014 neutrality and the Russians, we\ndemanded the Russians get out. And we agreed that on the 23\" in the morning, we\nwould all come back to the university and we would have a \u2014 a demonstration.\nCame October 23\", I went to the university, we waited until late afternoon, we\nfinally got permission for the demonstration. I was there in Parliament Square, and\nthen I went home and then the shooting war started. I went back to the university\nabout a week later, and I participated in some of the \u2014 the skirmishes which had\nhappened there. November second, the Russian tanks rumbled through our\nneighborhood.",
        "Q: Wh-When you say you participated, what did that mean, in the skirmishes?",
        "A: Meaning I was shooting guns at whoever was shooting guns at us. This was a\nshoot \u2014",
        "Q: And you \u2014 you \u2014 you \u2014 you were shooting guns after seeing \u2014 being much\nyounger in a war where you saw other people being shot?\n107November 13, 1997",
        "A: Remember, this is a revolution against the Russians now. I am now with the\ngood guys. I am \u2014 I am fighting for Hungarian independence. I am just a graduate of\na university. I feel that maybe we have a chance, although some people think it\u2019s\nridiculous, and I find out a few days later that it 1s ridiculous, the world 1s not going\nto help us. Second of November came. The Russians came in. I felt that 1t was\nfutile, and at that point I wanted to stay alive, I d\u2014I didn\u2019t go out to shoot any\nmore.",
        "Q: Ho \u2014 and seeing the Russians coming in 1n their tanks, did that trigger any\nmemories for you?",
        "A: It did, it certainly did, th-the memory of that March Sunday, when the Germans\n\u2014 German tanks came in the very same route, toward the \u2014 the center of the city, and\nthat \u2014 that memory also triggered that, you know, what is happening here is \u2014 1s\nhistory repeating itself, or not. But there was not very much time for thinking here,\nbecause there was a war going on and for two weeks there was a \u2014 a real fighting. I\nmean, at that point we went \u2014 everybody from the building where we lived when\ndown to the basement, just like we had in 1944, and \u00b045. It was artillery duels. And\nby November, by the 20\" of November, the inside of the downtown was completely\ndemolished again. I mean, 10 years after the war, the downtown area looked just\nlike it did in 1945. Twenty-second of November \u2014 oh, during this period of time, we\n108November 13, 1997\nare listening to radio free Europe and a voice of America. And I was particularly\nappalled by the fact that I was sitting in Elizabeth Street, in a basement, while a\nbunch of people are already sending messages from Austria to their relatives,\nsaying that they are already in Austria and they don\u2019t know whether they are going\nto Australia or Canada yet. And I\u2019m sitting as \u2014 like a rat in a basement in\nBudapest. And I, just to mys \u2014 I am saying to myself, I mean, how many mistakes\ncan I make? I mean, my mother and father made enough mistakes. I\u2019m not going to\nmake the same. So, on the spur of the moment, I called my fianc\u00e9e and a friend, that\nin the next morning we are going to meet in [indecipherable] railroad station and\nthen we\u2019ll see what happens. And I bicycled there, because there was nothing else.\nSaid goodbye to my mother. The decision took all of a half an hour, and in the next\nmorning we met at the railroad station. We had a vague plan, which 1s to go to a\nborder town and then feel our way around. We never got there. After the \u2014 the \u2014 this\nis chaos now, there is no central government. The Russians are occupying part of\nthe country, not all of it. There 1s still fighting going on in the countryside.\nRailroads have no schedule, government is nonexistent. People are doing their\nthing. Obviously a lot of them are already outside of the country. The train was\ncompletely packed, maybe a thousand people. And shortly after we started, we\nfound out that most of the thousand people had the same idea, to go to the western\n109November 13, 1997\nborder and get out. We were told that it\u2019s dangerous to keep maps, so we throwed\nthe maps away. I had a couple of things in my pocket, two overcoats and a few\nother things. Couple of pieces of jewelry sewn into my pocket and who knows who\nto bribe, how to do whatever is going to happen. We had no idea.",
        "Q: What\u2019s it like to make decisions yourself? Previously, in the war, it was your\nparents who made the decisions.",
        "A: Well, it \u2014 I was 22 years old and I felt that in the war I made a few decisions\nwhich saved my life, and I am not going to stay around. I knew that some people\nknew that I was participating 1n the fighting. I knew that the Russians are not going\nto be very merciful for those who were participating. I could end up in jail, or\nworse. So I didn\u2019t have much of a choice and I really wanted to leave. I \u2014 I thought\nthis was the most psychologically opportune moment in the world for me. I had\ncompleted my undergraduate education, and here is an opportunity I would \u2014 would\npay, you know, I would take whatever chances there was. To make the long story\nshort, the train never reached the town where we went to. It stopped in a smaller\ntown, some 20 \u2014 25 miles from the border. We slept there, and the very next\nmorning went to the station, we got into a cattle train. The cattle train stopped in the\nmiddle of the day, in the middle of nowhere, and then we walked for two days, and\nended up at the border. And I didn\u2019t like the situation very much, because in the\n110November 13, 1997\nborder there was some fighting at night. So I told my fianc\u00e9e and our \u2014 our friend to\n\u2014 we are moving back. We moved back to a small village. I met a\u2014 we met a fellow\nwho told us that he would help us the very next morning, because he knew a way.\nAnd we also told him to go back to our parents and see if they would be able to\ncome out. The next morning we went out bright, early morning, and he told us that\nbetween those two haystacks, if we stay between them it\u2019s okay. That haystack \u2014\nbeyond that haystack are the Russian, beyond that haystack are the Hungarian\ncommunists, but in-between is okay. And that\u2019s what we did, we went in between.\nThe only problem was that right before no man\u2019s land, there was a quarter of a mile\nof completely cleared land, and behind that there were towers, watch towers.",
        "Q: Do you think your experience during the war helped you get through this?",
        "A: Probably. I do not know. At that point I was only thinking about the now and the\nthen. Th-The moment. We knew that we had to go \u2014 go through. We knew that we\nalso had an excellent chance of being shot in the back from the watchtowers. We\nalso knew that in front of us, which used to be a minefield, the mines were removed\na few months before, and we have no other barrier. And this was the chance. And I\nthink there are some points in life when one does not think too much, and hesitate\ntoo much, because if one does, one gets paralyzed. So what I just did, I started to\ncurse in Hungarian, started to yank my fianc\u00e9e as fast as I could. We ran though this\n111November 13, 1997\npart, and it took us probably all of two minutes, but it 11 \u2014 seemed like an hour. And\nthen we were there, we were \u2014 we were in no-man\u2019s land, we saw the Austrian\nflags, and we were on the other side, and then in about five minutes later, the\nAustrian border patrol intercepted us. We didn\u2019t speak the language, but they didn\u2019t\nwant. Turned out, when we ww-went to Lutzmannsdorf, which was the first little\ntown, is that the night before, the border police all defected, and so nobody was up\nthere, but I didn\u2019t know that. So my \u2014 my luck was still \u2014 still with me. And then the\nvery next day, the Joint came to Eisenstaedt, which was the next largest city. They\ntook us to Linz. It was already organized, all the hotels in Linz, which was Hitler\u2019s\nhometown, were reserved for the Jews, and that was an ironic twist of fate. It was\nWiesenthal \u2014 I don\u2019t know if you know the name Wiesenthal, Simon Wiesenthal,\nwho was in charge of that operation. We had hundreds of Hungarian Jews there.\nThe non-Hungarian \u2014 Hungarian non-Jews were thrown into a camp, and we were\nthere for three weeks. Meanwhile, the Joint fed us and paid our hotel room. There\ncame recruiters from Canada and from the United States. When they found out\nthat I was an engineer, young engineer, they said absolutely, you should come.\nWhen they found out that I had an uncle here, they said no problem at all. And three\nweeks later, on the 19\" of December of 1956, our plane touched down in Newark,\nand we went to Camp Kilmer, and a day later I was in New York City.\nNovember 13, 1997",
        "Q: How did you feel putting your foot down on American soil?",
        "A: Well, it was unreal. We had a 30 hour flight. We stopped in Reykjavik \u2014 in\nReykjavik, Iceland, we were in Scotland, we were in Labrador. Not the jet\nplanes, th-they \u2014 they had no jet planes in \u201956. It was a \u2014 it was an exhaustive \u2014\nexhausting trip because the night before we started, we already were going \u2014 we\noriginally were going from Linz to Salzburg, and in Salzburg we didn\u2019t have a\nplace, so they sent us back to Linz, and from Linz to Muenchen(ph). And so we\nwere on a bus for 14 or 15 hours before we had the 30 hour flight. So I was sort of\nin no-man\u2019s land. There was one thing which happened a day before we left, which\nwas very important. We visited Mauthausen. This was an inoculation against\nEurope and against any kind of \u2014 of \u2014 of wanting to go back to the old \u2014 to the old\n\u2014 to the old country.\nEnd of Tape Three, Side B\n113\nNovember 13, 1997\nBeginning Tape Four, Side A",
        "Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\nvolunteer collection interview with George Pick. This is tape number four, side A.",
        "A: Prior to leaving Austria, my mother and I were in almost daily telephone\ncontact.",
        "Q: Le \u2014 you were talking about maut \u2014 going to Mauthausen though.",
        "A: I\u2019m sorry. The day before we left for the United States, we decided my \u2014 my\nfianc\u00e9e and my friend and I decided to inoculate ourselves against any kind of\nhomesickness, so visited mau \u2014 we visited Mauthausen. Mauthausen is ina\nfantastic place, it\u2019s on the top of a hill. Beautiful view, and unspeakable horrors. In\n\u00b056, Mauthausen was very different, I am sure, than what it is now. It was much\ncloser to what it was in 1944, and we had a vivid sense of what had \u2014 what must\nhave been. And \u2014 and it certainly recalled all the horrors which we read about and\nwhich we heard about from the surviving friends and relatives who came back and\nwho \u2014 some of whom came back from Mauthausen. I have a number of uncles who\nwere in Mauthausen and who came back. And so I could now put together the \u2014\nthe name and the place, and it certainly cured me for \u2014 for many, many years, for 38\nyears from \u2014 from any kind of homesickness. And then the next morning, as I\nmentioned, we were bound to go to \u2014 to Salzburg and then back and forth until we\n114\nNovember 13, 1997\ngot to the plane. Prior to leaving, finding ou \u2014 we only found out that we were\ncoming to the United States about a week before we left. We did not know\nprecisely what was going to happen, how long things would take. And shortly after\nwe left Hungary, my mother and I, and my fianc\u00e9e\u2019s parents were in daily\ntelephone contact. The original plan was that her \u2014 her parents and my mother\nwould essentially come to Austria and then we would meet there. The peasant who\nhelped us over, indeed went to \u2014 to Budapest and he on \u2014 he also told them that\nthey could come with him and he would help them. But they didn\u2019t want to take the\nchance. It started to be fairly late in December. My mother and a cousin of mine\nwent down to Szeged, which is close to the Yugoslavian border. They tried it there,\nthey couldn\u2019t do it, they were turned back. And I told my mother not to go\nanywhere, just stay in Budapest and see what happens and leave the country\nlegally. I didn\u2019t want to wait for her because by then we had the papers and I didn\u2019t\nwant to miss the opportunity to come to the United States. So, late at night on the\n19\" of December we touched down. On the 20\", I met my uncle, who was very\nstrange, or somewhat strange, told me that you don\u2019t need those Jews. You come\nwith me, I live in New Jersey, and Ill take care of you. I told him that, that\u2019s nice,\nbut I came with my fianc\u00e9e and I\u2019m not going to let her just drift away. He\nreluctantly took her also with him, and us. We went to this New Jersey place, it\u2019s\n115November 13, 1997\nWharton, New Jersey, it\u2019s a small town, small Hungarian town, sort of. Most of\nthe Hungarians who live there, lived there since either the 20s or 30s, or after the\nwar, which meant that most of them were Nazis. Now my uncle 1s a fisi\u2014 was a\nphysician. I didn\u2019t know it then, but I found out very soon that he converted, and he\nwanted to keep his Jewish origins a deep, dark secret. This led to a fallout, and a\nvery irreconcilable difference between him and me. Until I left Hungary, I went to\nsay Kaddish for my father every day. When I came to this country, I couldn\u2019t. There\nwas no Jewish synagogue in Wharton. My uncle arranged for me to have a job,\nmean \u2014 two \u2014 two weeks after I came, as well as my fianc\u00e9e. She was a chemist, she\nspoke English, she got a fairly good job. I got a general helper\u2019s job in a small\nfactory, not a very satisfactory job for an engineer, but that was what I cou-could\nhave. What \u2014 and it went on for a couple of months, but what really broke things 1s\nthat in March was my Yahrzeit, and my fianc\u00e9e and I had decided to go to the next\ntown, which had a little, small synagogue. And we \u2014 to say Kaddish. So I went to\nsay Kaddish, and there we met a friend of my uncle\u2019s whom we \u2014 knew we were\nJewish. And that friend told my uncle a couple days later that we saw George and\nhis fianc\u00e9e in a synagogue. You know, ho \u2014 what \u2014 what\u2019s going on? Well, my\nuncle was quite furious about this and told me that \u2014 why didn\u2019t I tell him this, he\nwould have taken me a hundred miles somewhere, where nobody knew him. So it\n116November 13, 1997\nwas a big fallout. I wrote to my mother very angrily, and so angry that I forgot to\nput the address. And it \u2014 the letter was intercepted by the mailman, who was a\nHungarian, who gave it to the Hungarian priest of the town, who opened the letter\nand in short order found out who the letter came from, and with e \u2014 much glee I am\nsure, gave it to my uncle, who almost killed me. And wrote a letter to my mother\nthat I will end up in a gallows in this country and I will \u2014 and I am just a terrible\nperson. My mother, who was absolutely petrified as to what will happen to me.\nAnyway, make the long story short on that, I was able to get a scholarship at\nTemple University to learn English, and in March of 1958, which was \u2014 \u00b057 rather,\nsorry, three and a half months after I went to live with my uncle, I left. My fianc\u00e9e\nstayed there. I went to vi \u2014 to Philadelphia, I stayed there for over a year. My\nfianc\u00e9e and I sort of broke up at this point. She moved to New York, and later on\nshe got married. My uncle and I broke up quite a bit, quite severely, and my mother\nleft Budapest in August of 1957, with a visa to Israel. She never went to Israel,\nshe stayed in Italy. My uncle, who was her brother, helped him \u2014 her a bit,\nhowever, in reality what he did 1s he told me that I have to help my mother. And I\nsent my uncle a certain amount of money every month so that he would send it to\nmy mother. After Temple, I got a job as an engi \u2014 junior engineer at Westinghouse,\nand I was there for about four months, after which I got a scholarship at Drexel and\nNovember 13, 1997\nI started to study engineering. And I did that until March of \u201958, at which time I\nfound out that my mother was going to come to the United States and she will be\ncoming in the next six months. And my uncle very specifically told me that he was\nnot going to help my mother come to the United States, or help her when she\u2019s\nhere. So I had no choice in the matter, I quit school. I went to New York. I was\nunemployed there for a little while, and then my friends have it \u2014 my friend\u2019s help, I\ngot a job. And with another interesting story, I met a Russian princess who helped\nme to get the job here in Washington. This Russian princess happened to be the\ncousin of the Lazar(ph). Her name was Princess Trumbetskoy(ph), and for some\nreason and another, hil \u2014 she liked me. And she called Cardinal O\u2019 Boyle, who was\nthe chancellor of the Catholic University of America and told him that, here is this\nrefugee boy, and that she would like to help him. And I got a interview, and I got a\njob as an instructor there. I also enrolled in graduate school there, I stayed there for\nseven years. I taught there mechanical engineering, a-and endi \u2014 ending up as an as-\nassistant professor and receiving my Master\u2019s degree in mechanical engineering in\n1962. In 1960, I met a young, Jewish girl, and we got married that summer. That\nmarriage was a disaster and we divorced nine months later. Two months after I\ncame to Washington in \u201958, my mother arrived here. And I live with my mother\nfrom \u00b058 until 64. And I worked in the university and my mother \u2014 most of the\n118November 13, 1997\ntime my mother didn\u2019t work, essentially. She found a little job to get a social\nsecurity, finally. And the university was \u2014 the university experience was \u2014 was not\nas rewarding as I was hoping for, it \u2014 it\u2019s a small school. At that time Catholic\nUniversity was a rather backwards school in terms of theology. They still didn\u2019t\nstep out to the 15\" century, and although they tolerated me as a Jew, they didn\u2019t\ntolerate me as a divorced Jew, and I got some flack and by the time I realized that\nthat\u2019s not much of a future for me, I got another job, and I left. Well, actually,\ndivorce wasn\u2019t as bad as my remarriage in 1964. I met another Jewish girl here, and\nwe married. And that \u2014 after that, things became very intolerable. By then I only\nworked part-time at school. I got a job in a research inst \u2014 a research in \u2014 firm, a\nsmall firm, and it was very interesting. One thing which happened after I got my\ncitizenship in 1962, shortly after I got my degree, 1s I got my passport, and I took\nadvantage of still working in a university and I went to Europe for two months,\nwhich was the first time since \u201956, and the first time I really had a chance to travel.\nAnd it was a fabulous two months of \u2014 of \u2014 of not just vacationing, but \u2014 but\ndiscovering western Europe. It was very interesting, because I sailed on a ship,\nwhich was called the USS France. On the manifesto of that ship, there was a girl,\nher name was Toby Yaspar(ph). She became my wife a year later. We didn\u2019t know\nthat we were sailing on the same ship, or if we were traveling together. We met in a\n119November 13, 1997\n\u2014in a Jewish get together, about a half a year later. In 1966, I went to join the \u2014\nwork for the navy. At that time I already finished all the courses which I needed for\nmy PhD, and I needed a thesis. And the university had no laboratory which was\nreally capable of doing anything. So one of the lecturers there, who worked for the\nDavid Taylor Model Basin, told me to come to work for him, and then I can work\non my thesis there, which is what I did. I worked there 11 years. I worked there in\nhigh energy gas dynamics, and I wrote my thesis. I never got my degree, because by\nthe time I wrote my thesis, I lost my minors, which was nuclear engineering, and I\njust didn\u2019t \u2014 I was in \u2014 1n school studying 12 years at that point, and I had enough of\nit. And I really didn\u2019t think that I needed it. So I had all the PhD courses finished,\nand I \u2014 the thesis finished, the comprehensive was the only thing I didn\u2019t. It was 11\nyears of research; nice years, interesting research. I wrote more than 50 papers. I\nwas involved in the professional development there. And then in 1977, I had an\nopportunity to get a promotion somewhere else, which I did. I moved from 19 \u2014\nfrom Maryland where | lived, to Virginia. Unfortunately, my family life did not\nturn out as well as my career. After six years, my wife and I, with mutual consent\ngot divorced. Reason why we did \u2014 and this was a \u2014 again a fairly long story, is I\nhad a problem having children, wanting children, and she wanted children. We went\nthrough three years of therapy and the therapy resolved nothing except that her\n120November 13, 1997\nbiological clock was running and that the only way that she could have a child is if\nshe will marry somebody else.",
        "Q: Did you not want children because what of \u2014 you went through when you were a\nchild?",
        "A: Precisely. I didn\u2019t think that I would be a very competent father after which I\nwent through, and the father which I \u2014 whom I had, whom I adored in one sense and\nin another sense I was very ambivalent about, and I was afraid that I would be just\nlike him and I would be incompetent and I didn\u2019t want anybody to have that kind of\na life. I went through three more years of therapy after this, because I wasn\u2019t sure\nthat \u2014 1f it was the final decision, but it was. Then we divorced in \u201973 - \u201974. And it\nwas during our separation when I went to Israel the first time. It was a fantastic\nexperience in 1970. It was a real revelation, and the first time in my life, perhaps, I\nfelt home. And I didn\u2019t feel home in a sense that I wanted to live there, but I felt a\nreal close kinship. I had many friends there, and \u2014 and the land was just\nindescribable. I went back two more times in the next 15 years after that. I traveled\na great deal, I was single for 20 years. I traveled every year abroad, from the Far\nEast to the Middle East to Europe many times. My career went fine. I worked for\nthe navy two more jobs. From 1977 to \u201988, I worked for a high energy laser project,\nwhere I became a project manager, and it was a very exciting, new edge, high \u2014\n121\nNovember 13, 1997\nhigh tech e \u2014 envelope program, edge of the envelope program. And the next one is\n\u2014ha-happened from 1988 to 1994, where I worked for a multi-national project\noffice, which was the NATO [indecipherable] office, where I very \u2014 where I\njokingly said I wanted this job because I \u2014 al-always in my job I was the only one\nwith an accent, and this \u2014 in this office, I would be in the majority, having 13\ndifferent nations, and people from 13 different nations work there, although I was\nthe only Hungarian. And we had a lot of fun, it was a very interesting project,\ndeveloping a \u2014 a vertical missile. And I was very instrumental in that. After the\nproject was over, which was in 1993, unfortunately things for the navy became a\nlittle bleak, and the technical challenges \u2014 whereas the money sort of went away.\nAnd at the end of 1994, I decided to \u2014 to retire. There were two things which\nhappened in the early 90s. One is that my mother got sick at age 89. We lived apart,\nbut very close for 20 years. Now, we moved back together, she moved back. She\nwas an invalid and I took care of her for 18 months. And the last 18 months of her\nlife perhaps was the happiest for many years for her, in spite of her sickness. She\nfelt that we were again together. In her 90\" birthday she beca \u2014 she got the heart\nfailure. They pulled her out for some reason, she lived six more weeks. And then in\nMay of 1991, she died of heart failure, her fourth. In 1990, after some unsuccessful\nrelationships, some long term, some short term, I met a woman who was as far\n122November 13, 1997\naway from my culture as anybody could be. She wa \u2014 she\u2019s Mexican, her name is\nLetitia. And what I found out, actually it was in 1991, and I found out that when\nmy mother got sick, that my American girlfriend didn\u2019t stick out with me, but this\nwoman, whom I met only two or three weeks earlier, did. And she stuck with me\nfor a year and a half almost, with \u2014 under these conditions and \u2014 and I found not\nonly a kinship, but also love. We got married in 1992, and we are still married. She\nworks in the Mexican embassy and we are pretty happy now. So I think that\u2019s the\nend of the story.",
        "Q: Well, there are just a few more things I want to ask you now about working at\nthe museum as a volunteer. What was your first encounter with the museum before\nyou went to work there? How did you learn about the museum?",
        "A: I learned about the museum probably 10 years before it was built, through some\nsolicitations and through friends whose \u2014 who provided some funds to the museum.\nI did not know very much about the museum until I saw an ad, I think in the\n\u201cWashington Jewish Week,\u201d where the museum advertised for volunteers. This\nwas in 1992. And I went to the L Street, where the museum headquarters were at\nthe time, and I didn\u2019t know what was going on, and I volunteered and I said I could\nhelp in the library, could do some translations from Hungarian to English. And I got\n\u2014I\u2014I worked a little bit with \u2014 with a car \u2014 with Sheri(ph) Shebo(ph) \u2014 you know\n123November 13, 1997\n\u2014I don\u2019t know if you know Sheri(ph). She \u2014 I think she still works up in the library.\nAnd I worked there for a couple of months until the first course started for the\nvolunteers for the visitors\u2019 services. And I was in \u2014 in that group.",
        "Q: Why \u2014 why did you start working for the museum?",
        "A: I felt that the museum fulfills a mission for me. I am a survivor and I had a\nresponsibility and a mission until I can, and I\u2019m capable of, to associate myself with\nprojects which have something to do with the Holocaust. My awareness started\nbefore the museum, in the mid \u2014 mid-80s, when Holocaust became a subject, which\nthey spoke again about. As you know, the Holocaust was a taboo subject, even in\nthis country, for many years. Although I read a n\u2014 a number of books, it\u2019s\nastonishing how little came up between say 1956 and 1986. There were a few books\nonly, and not very much of the Holocaust. I think where I became more aware is the\ngathering. I was a volunteer there, because I felt that I was really not a survivor, that\n\u2014 that, you know, this was for the older survivors, and the concept of child survivor\ndid not hit me at that point. It hit me a couple of years later, when I started to read\nabout child survivor groups. And in 1991 I got associated with a group here in\nWashington, called the Washington-Baltimore area child survivors, and I became\nvery active. We had a conference in 1991, and at that time I knew about the\nmuseum, and I became very interested in that, as well as the child survivor group. I\n124\nNovember 13, 1997\nstarted to write, I started to read more, I started to speak to groups. And by 1992 -\n1993, I was a \u2014a full-fledged volunteer who is \u2014 was more than eager to do\nsomething, and I liked the idea of wanting to educate the public, as well as others,\nabout the Holocaust. I felt that the people, even the Jewish people, were ignorant\nand that they really need education, and I felt that the museum was a \u2014 was the\nvehicle for that. And so when we finished, I was more than eager to start working\nthere. The first thing I did is I, when the opportunity arose, I \u2014 I completed the\nlearning center specialist course, and I finished another cor \u2014 specialized course for\n\u2014 for student, and then for teacher guides in the permanent exhibition, which I still\ncan do, and do occasionally. And then I got associated with the speakers\u2019 bureau in\n1980 \u2014 in 1995. And in 795 - \u201996, I\u2014 I spoke to a number of outside groups: among\nthem Pentagon, a number of army establishments, schools, synagogues and\nchurches. And I feel that \u2014 that that aspect of \u2014 of my work, in conjunction with the\nmuseum is very appropriate for me as a \u2014 as a survivor.",
        "Q: Are the talks that you give to these groups different?",
        "A: Some of them are different. Most of them center about my own story, you know,\nsurvi \u2014 as a survivor. But I have spoken to high schools, such as the Lee High\nSchool in Silver Spring about other things, such as the relevance of \u2014 of the\nHolocaust in today\u2019s world. It\u2019s a \u20141t\u2019s amazing how many people think that the\n125November 13, 1997\nHolocaust is really not relevant, and how I feel that that\u2019s wrong, and that there is\ntremendous relevance even today and will for the future. In a sense, I am very\ndesperate to \u2014 to \u2014 to preserve the memory, which whatever means that takes. I\nwrote up my story, which was published, incidentally, in 1993 also, asa\u2014asa\ncollection of stories with 11 other Hungarians and \u2014 and it\u2019s published in a book.\nAnd I \u2014 I am writing now a \u2014 a lo \u2014 long \u2014 longer autobiography which will be\nprobably a full-length book. Not just my Holocaust, but my post-Holocaust\nexperience in life in general.",
        "Q: How has working at the museum affected your life? Has it affected your\nmemories of the Holocaust?",
        "A: It certainly has. It induced me to \u2014 to learn a lot more. I thought I knew the\nHolocaust fairly well, through roughly 10 - 15 years of reading, but I found out that\nI needed to learn a great deal too. And in the last five years, oh, I read maybe a\ncouple of hundred books on the Holocaust and I took a number of courses, mostly\nin the museum. There are tremendous courses in the museum, for learning center\nspecialists and research department. I try to go to every course and every lecture\nand every one or two day cour \u2014 one or two day \u2014",
        "Q: Seminars, conference?\n126November 13, 1997",
        "A: \u2014 sem-seminars, wherever it\u2019s offered, then wherever I have time. I \u2014 I went\nmaybe 50 of them already. So I am \u2014 I\u2019m really immersed, and it made me very\nconscious about a lot of things. A lot of things which a lot of people just sort of\ndon\u2019t care about or \u2014 or feel that it\u2019s not \u2014 not relevant any more, and I think it 1s.",
        "Q: Why do you think it\u2019s relevant?",
        "A: Why 1s it relevant? I think that it\u2019s relevant because people are \u2014 most people in\nthis country and everywhere else in the world are still as disinterested in what\nhappens to other groups who are discriminated against, or who are being killed, as\nthey were 53 years ago when the Jews were killed, and I think the message 1s still\nfresh. You cannot be disinterested, you must be involved, because involvement is\nthe only insurance for the world to prevent mass genocides.",
        "Q: Do you think, as a staff member at the museum, you bring special insights\nbecause you are a survivor?",
        "A: I do believe that that\u2019s the case. I believe that every time that I say to a group\nwho comes, and whose \u2014 and I give group \u2014 little \u2014 little group orientations when I\nsay that my name is George Pick and I am a survivor and all of a sudden everybody\nlooks at me. And it \u2014 it \u2014 I think a survivor is a \u2014 1s the only direct link people have\nto the Holocaust, and I believe that that is a unique thing I bring to the museum, and\n127November 13, 1997\nall the survivors who are there, bring to the museum. And I think the museum\nshould take maximum advantage of that.",
        "Q: With your survivor friends, have you ever tried to encourage them to volunteer\nat the museum, and if so what \u2014 what did they respond to you?",
        "A: Yes, I do, I\u2014 the \u2014 I have two sets of survivor friends. The \u2014 some of them are\nolder than I am. The ones who are Hungarian, and who are in their 70s, and some of\nwho gave considerable amount of money to \u2014 to the museum. Who can afford to,\nbut they do. And who are \u2014 some who are not as wealthy, myself included, who\nwould give our time. I know that a number of us are volunteering in the museum\nwho are Hungarians and who are survivors. Same thing from the survivor \u2014 child\nsurvivor group. And I am \u2014",
        "Q: So the \u2014 so the response to \u2014 when you ask people to volunteer has been good?",
        "A: Not as good as I would like it. I would like to have more of them volunteer and\nmore of them go out, but each year I can \u2014 I can persuade a few more people to \u2014 to\nget involved. And as \u2014 that\u2019s always pleasing to me, and I\u2019m always gratified if that\nhappens \u2014 if \u2014 when that happens. And I\u2019m trying to keep people\u2019s minds out \u2014\ninterestingly enough, few \u2014 few of my friends who really suffered a great deal\nthrough the camps, are not willing to speak out and not willing to face, maybe never\nwill face the horrors they \u2014 they had gone through. And \u2014 and I sympathize and I\n128November 13, 1997\nunderstand that. But I encourage everybody else, who are capable of talking, to \u2014 to\ntalk to the museum, talk to the foundation, the Shoah Foundation, and give\ntestimony.",
        "Q: Can you describe your relationships with the other volunteers at the museum,\nwho are survivors or witnesses to the Holocaust?",
        "A: We have a very close-knit relationship. We know, of course who the survivors\nare, and we speak perhaps more among ourselves. We have now a group who meet\nabout twice a \u2014 about once every two months. We have now the \u2014 the director of\nsurvivor affairs, and Martin Goldman, who is encouraging us to interact with him\nand with each other. We are very concerned about the museum and we are\nconcerned about the direction the museum takes. We want to make sure that the \u2014\nthe Jewish aspect of the Holocaust is emphasized and that the Jewish aspects of the\nHolocaust are not going to fall by the wayside. We understand it\u2019s a \u2014it\u2019s a\ngovernment institution, but we still believe that the main event of the Holocaust was\nstill the \u2014 the Holocaust against the Jewish people. And we emphasize that among\nourselves, and among the \u2014 the visitors. We do not think this is in contradiction with\nany kind of museum policy, should not be, and must not be. And so we are \u2014 we\nfeel that we want to preserve the museum\u2019s main mission, which is to explain the\nHolocaust and show what \u2014 what had happened during that period.\n129November 13, 1997",
        "Q: Do the \u2014 you think the emphasis is becoming less Jewish?",
        "A: I do.",
        "Q: In what way?",
        "A: Well, I think we have now, this year particularly, succeeded in steering the \u2014 the\nmuseum back a little bit. I was unhappy about the \u2014 the Nazi Olympics. I think it\nwas \u2014 it make \u2014 it first of all, cost a lot of money and a lot of resources, and I don\u2019t\nthink it has a direct relationship to the Holocaust. I mean, 1t was a \u2014 an event, a Nazi\nevent, but there were many, many, many other events, which had direct relations. I\nam very happy now that the Kovno ghetto exhibit will come. I was happy with the\nFry exhibit. But the \u2014 but I thought that going \u2014 going with that Nazi exhibit \u2014 Nazi\nOlympic exhibit was essentially going away from that. I was also unhappy for the\nsame reason of that little exhibit we had, which was the faces of Bosnia, or\nwhatever they called. Which I sympathize again, I felt that it was a terrible\ngenocide, and you know, I sympathize with all this, but again, that served to \u2014 to\nsteer away the muse \u2014 from the museum\u2019s main mission. And I don\u2019t think we can\nafford that, we have too many other \u2014 too \u2014 too many things which is not in the\nmain exhibit, which should be said in the various other exhibits.",
        "Q: Such as?\n130November 13, 1997",
        "A: Well, such as \u2014 what, for example was the \u2014 you know, the Jews, as victims are\nshown pretty well in the main exhibit. But what about the Jews as contributors of\nEuropean culture and science? We were not victims before Hitler came; we were\ngreat contributors. There is \u2014 I think the museum has that part \u2014 the museum\u2019s\nmission is very integrated with that, to show that \u2014 that our contribution, our 1,000\nyear old contribution to European culture and civilization and technology is more\nthan just six million deaths. And I think the museum should have an exhibit for that\n\u2014 pretty soon, as a matter of fact. That\u2019s one idea, and I had about 20 or 30 other\nideas which I wrote up as a\u2014 in a memo to the management, and which I submitted\nto the ma \u2014 high management in January of this year. I really believe that they are\nlooking at some of it, and some of these ideas are already bearing some fruition. But\nI think they have a long way to go, and many years to do it. And I think that \u2014 that \u2014\nthat management should not forget these aspects of the Holocaust.\nEnd of Tape Four, Side A\nBeginning Tape Four, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\nvolunteer collection interview with George Pick. This is tape number four, side B.\nDescribe your impressions of the museum\u2019s non-survivors volunteer and staff, both\nJewish and non-Jewish.\n131November 13, 1997",
        "A: My impression of the non-survivor volunteers?",
        "Q: And staff.",
        "A: And staff.",
        "Q: Those who are Jewish, and non-Jewish.",
        "A: Okay, yes, of course. I think that it 1s not a coincidence that in the volunteer\ncorps, probably 95 percent are Jewish, whether they are survivors or non-survivors.\nI feel that, and I very much encourage anybody who volunteers to volunteer for the\nmuseum whether Jewish or non-Jewish. But there 1s, I think, a reason why Jews feel\nmore of a mission there than a non-mission. And I feel the same thing about the\nstaff. I am sorry to say that one of the concerns I have, and not only I, but many\nothers, is that many of the staff, the Jewish staff, 1s leaving the museum, and many\nof them already have left.",
        "Q: Why is that?",
        "A: Well, that\u2019s a good question, I don\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t know what the answer is, but I\nhave a feeling that the answer is very complex. One aspect of that answer is that the\nmuseum, in some respects become a bureau \u2014 bi \u2014 be \u2014 is becoming a bureaucracy,\njust like any other bureaucracy and it kills initiative. And there are some \u2014 there\nwere some very bright people there, with ideas and initiatives, who were stifled and\nwho were frustrated and who find \u2014 found a dead end situation there, and left. They\n132November 13, 1997\nwere not just a bunch of young people who left, whom I knew and sympathized\nwith, and who would have loved to stay in a museum if they have seen for\nthemselves some \u2014 some way up and some way to develop. But some senior man \u2014\nsenior people, senior historians, who had a reputation, and whose reputation\nenhanced the reputation of the museum, such as the research center. I was very\nsorry to see Baron(ph) Vaughn(ph) first of all leaving. I was very sorry to see\nwhen Sylvia Milton left. And my fear 1s that, with these kind of people leaving the\nmuseum, the research institute is not going to be able to attract the type of reputable\nscientists, such as Browning and others. It is not just a matter of money, I think it\u2019s\na matter of reputation, and I think the \u2014 the institute started out as a world class \u2014\nworld class institution, and I am not positive that it still maintains that status today,\nand I think it should. And if it doesn\u2019t now, it should certainly strive to do it again.\nThat is an awful lot that institution needs to do, and had the potential to doing it. I\nthink the museum management should definitely strive to \u2014 to nurture that\ninstitution, and my impression is that it is not doing that.",
        "Q: What would you like to see them do?",
        "A: What I like to see them do is to first of all encourage and hire world class\nhistorians to work there. As I said, some of them already left, and I\u2019m not positive\nthat too many of them wants \u2014 wants to work there under the circumstances. I think\n133November 13, 1997\nsome enticement, grants, sut \u2014 etcetera, probably will bring some of them back. But\nI think that there is a \u2014 a limitation there. There are other institutions who are\ncompeting for these same people, and I think if \u2014 1f the research institute is not\ngoing to compete successfully in the next few years, they may lose that kind of\nbrainpower, and I think that would be a great loss.",
        "Q: You had mentioned that you had many other ideas for other exhibits. Can you\njust name a few?",
        "A: Yes, well I\u2014 I believe that some of the exhibits, some of various ghetto exhibits\n\u2014 I think Kovno is \u2014 1s a good \u2014 good \u2014 I\u2019m sure it will be a good exhibit, but there\nare other ghettos and life in \u2014 in ghettos which were very different from Kovno and\nwhich is portrayed in the main exhibits, which should be shown. For example, in \u2014\nin west Europe, the ghettos were very different. I think that there should be exhibits\nabout the Hungarian Jews, and this is not because I am a Hungarian Jew, but\nbecause the Hungarian Jewish story is very different from the story of the Polish\nJews or the Lithuanian Jews, and it \u2014 in my estimation it\u2019s underrepresented in the \u2014\nin the main exhibit, anyway. So it should \u2014 it should find someplace else. The\nFrench Jews same thing, and \u2014 and the west European Jews, in a general sense, are\nalso underrepresented, and they should be given at least temporary space.\n134November 13, 1997",
        "Q: Are there any powerful experiences, or memorable experiences you\u2019ve had while\nyou\u2019ve been working at the museum?",
        "A: Yes. These memorable experiences had been very asso \u2014 very much associated\nwith teachers training there. I was fortunate to be invited a couple of times to speak\nto them, in a Belfer conference. I was very sorry to see Marshall Sabol(ph) leave,\nwho recognized very early on the potential of the survivor contributions to teachers\u2019\neducation. After Marshall left, he took some time in doing, and I must say to myse\n\u2014 to \u2014 must say that I was the one who forced the issue also there, until the a \u2014 the\neducation department recognized the contribution with the educ \u2014 which the\nsurvivors could make to education. But I had some memorable instances this year,\nwhen I participated in a Belfer conference, not as a speaker, but as just sitting\naround and listening to others, and having teachers come to me with questions and\nwanting me to show them the main exhibit and comment on them. And one \u2014 and\ntelling me \u2014 and I have go-gotten letters from them, several, not just this year, but\nother years, is that their me \u2014 most meaningful experience was to meet survivors.\nThat many things they could learn from books and from exhibits, but the person to\nperson touch was \u2014 was most meaningful for them, and which they hope to transmit\nto their students. And I really believe that. That was certainly most memorable for\nme there.\n135November 13, 1997",
        "Q: Are there any particular parts of the museum with which you identify with?\nAnything special there?",
        "A: Of course, I \u2014 I under \u2014 I identify with everything. It would be saying, you know,\nif you have many children, who do you love more? But despite of that, there are\ncertain things obviously, which \u2014 which were closer \u2014 or which are closer to me\nthan other pieces are. For example, the portrait of Raoul Wallenberg. Obviously,\nthe man who saved my life, directly and indirectly and who saved my immediate\nfamily\u2019s life, makes a difference to me. But \u2014 but everything is meaningful. And of\ncourse th-the-the large pictures which \u2014 which show the Hungarian Jews on the\nramp of Auschwitz in the selection process, the two little boys whose bewildered\nfaces remind me of my own, and whose uniform they wear, I had as six years old. I\nhave a picture of it, and I provided that to the museum to show that this was a\nuniform which little Hungarian boys, whether they were Jewish or not, wore. And\nso I am always very moved by their faces, and think of me, that I could be one of\nthem. They of course, not survived and I did. And that is a very emotional thing, but\nfor me \u2014 and a lot of people always wonder, how could I be a survivor and \u2014 and go\nthrough that \u2014 that exhibit so many times, isn\u2019t that stressful? The answer is,\nabsolutely. It\u2019s a gut-wrenching experience, and I \u2014 I feel that I owe that to \u2014 to the\n136November 13, 1997\ndead, and I owe that to myself and I owe that to the people whom I try to educate,\nof what it was, not just to look from the outside in, but what it was to be in, in hell.",
        "Q: Be-Because of the very difficult experiences you had during the war, was there\never a time when you resisted remembering what you experienced?",
        "A: I\u2014I do not remember consciously resisting. After the war, particularly after the\ncommunists took over in Hungary, this was a taboo subject. We did not focus at\nthis, we had day \u2014 daily problems and concerns. The memory, as fresh as it 1s 53\nyears later, was somehow buried for many, many decades, without losing its\nvividity, its \u2014 its vividness, its \u2014 its \u2014 its relevance. And it stayed there. I mean, it\nobviously this kind of things don\u2019t go away forever, but I never resisted it\nconsciously, I si \u2014 I simply just went somewhere else. I \u2014 I did \u2014 and I \u2014 I must say\nalso that my life is not defined by the Holocaust. Maybe in the later, last few years\nit\u2019s focusing \u2014 the Holocaust is more of a focus. But as you heard it from my post-\nHolocaust experiences and my \u2014 my professional life, I was not \u2014 the fofo \u2014 the\nHolocaust did not deter me in what I was doing. I was among the probably few who\nended up not in a helping profession. You would be a-amazed how many of the\nsurvivors ended up in a helping profession, or ha \u2014 how many ended up in\nbecoming a\u2014 more lawyers and doctors, and how few are engineers. But I was\namong the ones who became the hard scientist and I felt that my real calling and\n137November 13, 1997\nprofession was engineering and science, although I am trying to catch up now, and I\nam very much like \u2014 I would like to learn as much as I can about the Holocaust. I\nstill do not regard myself as, you know, as a survivor only. But I f\u2014 want to use my\nsurvivor status to speak, and my \u2014 my privileged voice to speak and to teach as long\nas I can.",
        "Q: Do you think you\u2019d be a different person today if you hadn't gone through the\nwartime experience that you did?",
        "A: Iam sure I would be. I think the wartime experiences has \u2014 had taught me a\ngreat deal. Many things which I probably wouldn\u2019t be. Persistence. Not be cowed\nby \u2014 by intimidations. Sometimes recognize when a crucial decision have to be\nmade, and I learned that heroes are not born, but made. Not un \u2014 I\u2019m not com \u2014\nsaying that I\u2019m a hero, but at least I have seen heroes who became heroes, who were\nplain folk, and \u2014 and I brushed with death very many times. So many times that\nsometimes I worry that I run out of luck eventually.",
        "Q: Do you feel Hungarian or American or Jewish?",
        "A: I have to tell you the \u2014 I have to tell you a little story about this. You know\nEinstein was asked the same question. The \u2014 does he feel American, German or\nJewish, and he says \u2014 do you know what his answer was? His answer was, well, as\nlong as my theory of relativity holds up, the Germans will say I\u2019m German, the\n138November 13, 1997\nAmericans will say I\u2014 I am American, and of course the Jews will say \u2019'm Jewish.\nBut if my theory turns out to be incorrect, the Americans will say I\u2019m German and\nthe Germans will say I\u2019m Jewish. So the same way with me, it\u2019s \u2014 I feel that the\ncomponents are there. I am a part \u2014 I have 22 years of me with Hungarian. I have 40\nyears of me with American and I have 63 years of me with Jewish, and they\nsomehow counteract and interact. I \u2014 I think it is \u2014 is sort of a very simp-simplified\nquestion when one asks, who, what is, in what component. I \u2014 I must say, I love\nHungarian literature, and I like Hungarian art and music. I love American literature,\nbut I love a lot of \u2014 lot of other things. And my hobbies, for example are more\nuniversalist than either Hungarian, American or Jewish. But I lo \u2014 but there are\ncomponents of all three, which I love, and then there are things which are associated\nwith neither. For example, I \u2014 I love photography, which is neither Jewish \u2014\nalthough there were many Jewish photographers. Neither Jewish nor Hungarian\nwere \u2014 there were a lot of good Hungarian photographers. Nor American, where\nagain, same \u2014 same thing happens. My interest and philosophy of life, I hope\ntranscends somehow, this compartmentalization.",
        "Q: Is there anything you\u2019d like to add that you haven\u2019t said, before we finish?",
        "A: Yeah, I1\u2014I like to go back to the museum, and I like to go back to a\u2014 a concern\nI \u2014 I had and raised and shall raise in the future, and that is about teachers\u2019\n139November 13, 1997\neducation. I believe that the vast majority of the teachers and certainly the students,\nwho will be teaching Holocaust studies and who will be learning Holocaust studies\nwould be Christian. I had had very uneasy few hours, few days in the museum\nabout anti-Semitism. And this is specifically in the Belfer conference this year,\nwhere I was \u2014 where I am \u2014 was looking at the struggle of non-Jewish teachers,\ntrying to teach non-Jewish teachers about the central \u2014 centrality of anti-Semitism\nand church anti-Semitism in the Holocaust. And the difficulties which these\nteachers had with the acceptance of this idea. And I was very concerned because I\nfeel that if these teachers would simply ignore this, you know, wa \u2014 one of the \u2014 one\nof the teachers said well, what happens if e \u2014 we teach it different? And he says,\nwell, you have a moral obligation to teach it this way. Well, that\u2019s nice. I always\nbelieve in moral obligations, but I heard of very spec \u2014 spe-specific and fairly\npractical objections. For example one black teacher got up \u2014 very few black\nteachers participated in this, said hey, I came from Tennessee from the Bible Belt. I\ncannot teach the Baptists that their belt \u2014 their \u2014 their New Testament is wrong. I\ncan\u2019t teach that, you know, I mean if the Jews are right, then they are wrong. How\ndo I do this? And I was really concerned and I am \u2014 [| think that this 1s a great\ncentral concern and should be of the education department to \u2014 to teach the\nHolocaust and the centrality of the a \u2014 of \u2014 of the anti-Semitism in such a way that\n140November 13, 1997\nthe teachers can accept it. I\u2019m not talking sugarcoating. I am talking truth, or I am\ntalking about acceptable ways, so they can teach it. If you teach it without\nacceptable ways, then it won\u2019t be taught. And if it is not taught, then the great point\nof the Holocaust, the great cause of the Holocaust is going to be lost. It\u2019s not\nenough to teach what happened, they must teach why it happened. And they cannot\nshirk from the fact that it largely happened because of the centuries of art \u2014 of anti-\nSemitism. But how do you package it, how do you do this so that the teachers can\nteach it and can accept it themselves? I talked to teachers afterwards, they really are\nstruggling. I mean, they \u2014 they hear their own priests, they have their own beliefs,\nand then they hear this, and they don\u2019t know how to resolve it. I think this needs to\nbe really considered and reconsidered in the museum, and that\u2019s not a small amount\nof work either. That\u2019s my parting shot for this.",
        "Q: Well, thank you very much for doing the interview.",
        "A: Thank you for \u2014 for letting me do it. I-I really hope that I have pointed out some\n\u2014 some thoughts here.",

        "Answer: My name is George Steven Pick, p-i-c-k.",
        "A: The first name 1s Anglicized. The original name was Gyorgy, but I changed it\nwhen I became a citizen because nobody could spell it and pronounce it. George is\nan equivalent English version of Gyorgy, which was my name.",
        "A: My family name was Pick, correct.",
        "A: Yes, I was born in Budapest, Hungary, in March 28, 1934.",
        "A: My family\u2019s history had been quite intertwined with the Austro-Hungarian\nempire\u2019s history. I have records which shows that my family was in Hungary for at\nleast 250 years. I have actual birth certificates and \u2014 and other do \u2014 documents\nNovember 13, 1997\nwhich document this. And I had a very large family. I did a little bit of genealogical\nresearch. It showed that I had roughly 250 family members in the empire. And I am\nsaying this because when the empire broke up after this first World War, my family\nsort of stayed to \u2014 stayed in the geographical locations they were, but all of a\nsudden they were citizens of three different countries, Czechoslovakia, Hungary\nand Austria. And some of my relatives also lived in Transylvania, so they became\nRomanian. And this was the situation between the two wars. We were a fairly\nclosely knit family. People were keeping in touch with each other. And I know, for\nexample, of what my great-grandparents did. One was on my father\u2019s side, a\nphysician. And the other one on my father\u2019s side was a merchant, an importer, who\nimported mostly fruits and spices. My grand \u2014 great-grandparents on my mother\u2019s\nside, one owned a lumberyard, and the second one was a lawyer. And so I have\nquite a bit of \u2014 of information about them. My grandparents of \u2014 my maternal\ngrandfather was an engineer, a mechanical engineer. Worked as chief engineer of a\n\u2014 of a factory in Hungary, and my grandmother was a housewife. My other\ngrandfather was a director of a lumber company. My father was a \u2014 an engineer and\nmy mother was a paralegal secretary. So that\u2019s the background. I am an only child, I\nhad no brothers or sisters. I have a number of cousins, I have a \u2014\nNovember 13, 1997",
        "A: My father\u2019s original name was Istvan, which is translated roughly to Steven,\nand my mother\u2019s name was Margit, which is Margaret; that\u2019s what she Anglicized\nher name to when she came to this country.",
        "A: Her maiden name was Kornhauser, and that\u2019s her father\u2019s name. Her mother\u2019s\nmaiden name was Spitzer(ph). And my grandmother on my father\u2019s side, her\nmaiden name was Augenfeld(ph).",
        "A: He was a\u2014a mechanical engineer, and he worked for a short time as such.\nBecause of some of the Jewish laws, which came into effect in the late 30s, early\n40s, he lost his job in January of 1939.",
        "A: Well, my family lived in Buda, which is the other side of the \u2014 the Danube\nriver, and we lived there until I think I was about six or seven, and then we moved\nto Pest, my father, mother and I.",
        "A: Yes, Buda is a very \u2014 very nice hilly section of the city. We lived near a\u2014a\nlarge square, where \u2014 and a \u2014 and a hill, Gell\u00e9rt hill. And my mother took me, when\nNovember 13, 1997\nI was a child, walking there to both the \u2014 the hill and the square. And I \u2014 I do\nremember very well the \u2014 th-the area.",
        "A: No, it was not. There was a Jewish neighborhood in Pest, but not in Buda. And\nwe did \u2014 we were very \u2014 we were not very religious. We were fairly \u2014 we \u2014 we were\nreally \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, assimilated, I could say. And were not very conscious of \u2014 of living in a\nJewish neighborhood, although we \u2014 we know that we are Jews, of course.",
        "A: I th \u2014 we \u2014 we observed the high holidays, but that was about it. My father\u2019s side\nof the family had a number of people who were \u2014 who married non-Jews, and they\nwere, I would say, completely non-observant of any religion. A few of them had\nconverted before the war, but most of them stayed Jewish, but were \u2014 were\ncompletely secular, I would say.",
        "A: It\u2019s an interesting story. When I was about four or five years old, my mother\ntook me to a little gymnasium. The gymnasium, in an English sense, was in a\nNovember 13, 1997\nJewish high school, and we went there once a week. And the teacher was Jewish,\nand it was a little bit of a physical education type thing. And on the corner, just\nacross the street from this high school, there was a \u2014 a Catholic church. And I\nalways insisted that we should go into this church, because I liked the way people\nwere \u2014 were praying there. My mother didn\u2019t say anything, and we went there.\nHowever, on \u2014 by age six, my mother enrolled me into a Jewish elementary school,\nand by then I knew very well that I was Jewish. I was also sort of forced into the\nreality of being Jewish after my father lost his job and he told me that he lost it\nbecause we were Jews.",
        "A: Well, we spoke German, mostly my mother and father and grandparents. I would\nsay they did, I didn\u2019t. And they spoke it because they didn\u2019t want me to understand\ncertain things. I was taught German when I was in kindergarten, and I spoke fairly\nwell for a few years, but then I\u2019ve completely forgotten it. Hungarian was the main\nlanguage, essentially.",
        "A: They were not. They were not Zionists at all. There was a \u2014I had an uncle who\ncame to the United States in the late 30s and he first wanted us to come, and sent\npapers. This was in 1940. Hungary was a neutral country until June of \u201941, so\nNovember 13, 1997\npeople could theoretically at least, leave the country. My uncle, who was a\nphysician when he emigrated, brought \u2014 took our papers and sent us some\naffidavits, but my father was very reluctant. He \u2014 he didn\u2019t want to start again, and\nthe un \u2014 my uncle was fairly discouraging as far as the possibilities of employment,\nbecause on \u2014 he was telling my father that he would be sort of a tradesman, maybe a\nmechanic. Well, my father was an engineer and a businessman and he didn\u2019t want\nto step down the ladder, so we didn\u2019t do anything. Then in 1940, he offered my\nmother that he would adopt me, and that he would take me, but my mother declined\nthat offer. So, because of that, I got stuck in Hungary with my parents, of course.",
        "A: I have very vivid memories in 1938 of Hitler, because Hitler speeches were\nbroadcast in the radio, and I remember this frightening voice, and \u2014 and his yelling\nand screaming, and \u2014",
        "A: Correct, but I remember it very vividly because it was frightening me. I mean, I\ndidn\u2019t understand the language, but the way he spoke was \u2014 was very frightening.\nNovember 13, 1997",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember them comforting me, I think I \u2014 I said to my parents that \u2014 that\nthis man was a very frightening person, the way he spoke. And we had [coughing]\nexcuse me \u2014 we had a prime minister at the time who was also a great anti-Semite,\nand I remember \u2014 well, I don\u2019t remember the \u2014 the speeches, but I do remember the\nkinds of \u2014 of expressions he \u2014 he \u2014 he used, which again, were \u2014 were frightening to\nme, although I was only a youngster. I was a fairly precocious child and I was well\naware of some of the politic \u2014 political figures, Churchill, Roosevelt, Hitler and all\nthis. And in fact, it was a sort of a joke in the family that people always ask me, you\nknow, who was the Prime Minister of England, or who was the president of\nAmerica, or whatever else, and I always knew the answer, even when I was in\nkindergarten. So I was sort of regarded as a smart kid, and I \u2014 I was more aware,\nprobably, than an average four or five years old, about what was happening.",
        "A: Yeah. In main of \u2014 May of \u201939, when the second Jewish law came into effect,\nmy father lost his job, but 1t was more than that, because that particular law, also\nallowed what they called people who were not trustworthy for the government.\nThey allowed the government to induct them into labor brigades. And of course,\nNovember 13, 1997\nthese groups included communists and Jews. And because of that, a number of my\nuncles, and among them, my father as well, was impacted very shortly. Actually,\n1940, my father was inducted into a labor brigade. And they took him to\nCarpathia-Ruthenia, which at that time was already occupied by Hungary. And\nthey sent him to build roads, strategic roads in that area.",
        "A: This \u2014 this was in \u2014 in September of 1940, 1940. And \u2014",
        "A: Okay, between the time he lost his job and being taken away, many Jews figured\na way to go around the \u2014 the laws. According to the laws, which were designed to\nsqueeze the Jews out of the economic life of Hungary, a Jew could not practice\nbusiness. But what they did, what the Jews did is they hired a Christian person who\nwould then take out the business license, and they would work under him. And in\nour building where we lived, there was a super by name of George Dudek(ph) who\nwas a very kind man. He was a friend of my f-father\u2019s, and he volunteer \u2014 he \u2014 he\nessentially agreed with my father that he would take out the license, and of course\nmy father paid him a stipend, and under this \u2014 with this arrangement, my father was\nable to \u2014 to do that \u2014 some business. Now, when I talk about business, it was not a f\n\u2014 it was not a formal store. What \u2014 what they have done, and this is a fairly\nNovember 13, 1997\ninteresting story, is they \u2014 they went to coffeehouses, and they met there Jews and\nnon-Jews and they made business essentially on a handshake [indecipherable] and\nthey sold them both things. My father, being an engineer was more familiar with\nengineering materials, so he \u2014 he sold scrap iron, scrap materials and bought \u2014\nbought them as well. And he had some partners who were \u2014 and business partners\nwho were both Christian and Jew, and that\u2019s how he essentially made a living. And\nbet \u2014 and after \u00b039, he has done that for \u2014 for quite awhile. As you see, he came\nback after the 1940 induction, and then he was inducted another time. But between\n1939 and 1944, he was home most of the time, and when he was home, he was\ndoing this, he was practicing business.",
        "A: I did. I remember one, I don\u2019t remember his name. My grandparents had a little\nhome \u2014 a little home, a little yard and a \u2014 a small bungalow, about 20 miles from\nBudapest, which we used, as well as some of my other relatives for summer \u2014 a\nsummer cottage. And I remember in 1940 particularly in the summer of \u201940, we\nwent there. My mother and I stayed there for maybe a month, and my father came\nout on the weekends and we had some \u2014 I had some next door neighbors, little mini-\nfarms, and kids came over, peasant children, and the \u2014 we played. And there was\nabsolutely no talk about whether you were Jewish or you were not, they were just\nNovember 13, 1997\nfriends. And \u2014 and as I said, I had a number of them from that \u2014 it was a little\nvillage called Gerdaler(ph) and we had a next door neighbor, was a Serbian couple,\nand we were very friendly with them, and some others, also. The building we lived\nin in Pest had a few children. In fact, our next door neighbor had two girls, and the\nnext door neighbor was a professional soldier. He was a \u2014 a \u2014 an officer in the army.\nAnd I was extremely friendly with their kids. I was \u20141f I wasn\u2019t home, I was there,\nand they sort of regarded me as \u2014 as a family member. When there was Christmas,\nthey had a little gift for me under the Christmas tree. And I have a number of\npictures with the \u2014 with the two girls. One was my age, and the other was a couple\nof years younger. The next neighbor next door was also very friendly. They \u2014 they\nhad a \u2014 a girl who was my age as well. And the three girls and myself, we were\nalmost inseparable friends in the age four to seven or eight, even up to 10. And\nagain, there was very little, to me, was very little awareness of \u2014 of what\u2019s the\ndifference between a Jew and a non-Jew.",
        "A: I\u2014I wouldn\u2019t say that. What I was saying 1s that I did have non-Jewish friends.\nWe had a number of anti-Semites in the building. And there was one incident which\nI remember very vividly. There was a teacher, who was a \u2014 quite an anti-Semite and\nNovember 13, 1997\nhe disliked me and I disliked him also, and once he asked me something, and I sort\nof a smart-alecky answer and he gave me a big slap on the face. And I \u2014 that was\nthe first time I have ever ha-had \u2014 even my parents didn\u2019t do things like that to me,\nand I was very upset. And the interesting end of this story was that a couple of years\n\u2014 couple of days later, this fellow came over and apologized to me that he did this,\nthat he shouldn\u2019t have. But I know that his feelings were not very friendly. But he \u2014",
        "A: I am almost positive that that was the case, that because I was Jewish.",
        "A: Well, I think he was a member of some sort of a Hungarian Nazi party. And he\nwas certainly \u2014 he was the warden, the air raid warden there, and he was very gung-\nho on \u2014 on the war. This was the first year of the war, when this whole thing\nhappened, in 1941, and I know that he was \u2014 he was nationalist at least. But I\u2014I-I\nalways had the feeling that he was also an anti-Semite.",
        "A: Well, I \u2014 I don\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t remember what my reaction was, but I remember\nwhen he lost his job. I do not recall whether it was a panic time or not. But he has\nNovember 13, 1997\nlost his job many times during the \u2014 the depression, and he always found something\nto do, and somehow to make a living. He was a man who could make a living on a \u2014\nin Antarctica probably as well. He was a very ingenious person.",
        "A: I did not feel threatened economically, but as I said, I had this \u2014 I mean, I heard\nHitler and I heard the prime minister of Hungary speak and yell. I certainly was\nfrightened by this. Maybe I was not completely conscious as to what could happen.\nBut just the \u2014 the voices were disturbing.",
        "A: My relationship with my parents at this time was close to my mother and not\nvery close to my father. My father was a fairly cold person. He was not a kind of a\nperson who would \u2014 would color, or who would tell me that he loves me, or\nsomething. And he was not a kind of a person who would want to take me to places.\nThere was always a great disagreement between my mother and father as to how to\nbra \u2014 how to bring me up. My father felt that my mother was coddling me too\nmuch. He called it a monkey love, and he wanted to make a man out of me, and he\nfelt that I was just too soft. And over the years, this \u2014 this translated into a \u2014 a fairly\nNovember 13, 1997\ndistant relationship between myself and my father. Even later in my years, I \u2014 he\nfelt that I\u2014I just did not meet his expectations in terms of physical prowess. My\nfamily, particularly my father\u2019s family had a number of gymnastic champions and \u2014\nand great sportsmen. My uncle was an Olympic \u2014 he was a European champion of\ngymnastics and seven times Hungarian champion. And both my aunt and my uncle\non my father\u2019s side were attending the Los Angeles Olympics. My uncle also went\nto the Amsterdam Olympics and Stockholm Olympics as a \u2014 as a part of the\nOlympic team of Hungary. And with that, of course, with that kind of competition,\nno, I was \u2014 was not able to compete. My father was, in his younger days, pretty\nphysically active. In his 40s he was not as active as he was earlier. But he expected\nme to follow his footsteps and his brother\u2019s footstep, who was a \u2014 a great skier and\nmountain climber, and I was never able to fulfill these kind of things, so he sort of\ngave up on me on that.",
        "A: If Iremember correctly, in Buda they lived with my mother \u2014 maternal\ngrandparents. This was right after they got married, and they really could not afford\nto live apart. In the late 30s, they had improved the financial conditions where my\nfather beg \u2014 was working for a couple of years there, and I guess they were able to\nNovember 13, 1997\nafford to move away. They didn\u2019t want to move into a very expensive\nneighborhood, first they moved into a \u2014 a fairly low \u2014 middle class neighborhood.\nBut then later, in 1940, me \u2014 we moved into an upper class place in \u2014 in Buda \u2014 in\nPest, in \u2014 which at that point was sort of considered a suburbs.",
        "A: I started school in September of 1940, and I went to a Jewish elementary school.\nIt\u2019s called the Jewish Boys\u2019 Orphanage, but it was not just an orphanage, it was an\nelementary school for other children. And it wasn\u2019t even for boys only, it was a\ncoed school. So we had about 30 students, I guess 20 boys and 10 girls.",
        "A: Well, there were several reasons for that. One of it is that school was considered\nvery good, and at that point I think my parents became aware that I should be more\naware of my \u2014 my Jewishness. And so they decided that this was a\u2014 a good school\nfor me. And indeed it was. I had met children, both girls and boys, who were \u2014\nessentially who became lifelong friends. In fact, I still have a number of them here\nin this country, whom I known since age six from first elementary school. And so it\nwas a\u2014a-\u2014a great bond, as it turned out. We had a great teacher Arn(ph)\nMagda(ph) who was a\u2014 a young woman at the time. And I remember the school as\na very friendly school, and as a very friendly place to \u2014 to go to. I also remember\nNovember 13, 1997\nthat my mother took me every ni \u2014 every day. The school was about a half an hour\nwalking distance from where li \u2014 where we lived. And I always woke up late.\nActually, my mother didn\u2019t have the heart to wake me up early enough, so that we\nended up running all the time. And \u2014 and she \u2014 I remember very well that she\nalways had my \u2014 hand my \u2014 held my hand, and we ran through this city park to get\nto the school. And I also remember the other teachers, other than just Arn(ph)\nMagda(ph).",
        "A: Yes. Actually, they were some of my relatives who were able \u2014 there was one\nuncle, his name was Gustie \u2014 Gustav. He lived in Vienna, and after the anschluss\nhe was arrested, and they took him to Dachau. And for \u2014 and I am not sure and I\ndon\u2019t remember how, but after about a year and a half in Dachau, he was let go,\nand he managed to slip over the border to Hungary, and became an illegal alien.\nAnd I remember him very well. He \u2014 we used to have a family gathering in my\nmatern \u2014 paternal grandmother\u2019s and grandfather\u2019s house. They had a little house,\nand it was a family tradition that we got together every Sunday afternoon. My\ncousins, my aunts, uncles and ourselves. And I remember Uncle Gustie came at that\ntime and he was telling us stories about the camp, and his life. And we sort of didn\u2019t\nNovember 13, 1997\nbelieve him very much. He was a very nice man. I didn\u2019t realize it until after the\nwar that he was a multimillionaire who at the end did not survive, and who left all\nhis houses for nobody. Ma \u2014 on my mother\u2019s side, there were several great-aunts\nand children and \u2014 who lived in Bratislava. And I remember Ileanor(ph) and her \u2014\nher 16 year old boy Garbore(ph) and her husband, they were able to slip across the\nDanube in 1942. And they lived again as illegal refugees in Hungary. We, between\n1942 and 1944 were able to hide them. It will \u2014 this follows, we had a fairly large\nfamily in Budapest. They \u2014 every night they slept somewhere else. And so every\nweek or week and a half, we were the ones who were hiding them, and my mother\nand grandmother were particularly fairly nervous when they slept in our house. Had\n\u2014 they had some papers, but they were not very good.",
        "A: Nervousness was contagious in a sense that I was aware that these people were \u2014\nwere illegals, that they came out of horrible things. We knew about the ghetto.",
        "A: Well, they were telling us about the ghetto, they were there, and the \u2014 and that\npeople went into hiding, into forests, and also the \u2014 that they were di \u2014 taken away.",
        "A: All this was not believed very much. We \u2014 we didn\u2019t think they were lying, but\nwe certainly didn\u2019t think that it could happen to us. And so, although we were\nnervous about their status, and we obviously were family, and we helped them as\nmuch. There was, for example, one uncle who \u2014 who was a very nice guy. He was \u2014\nhis name was Louie, and he was a very religious Catholic al \u2014 although he was not\nborn Catholic, he was a Jew who converted. And he was a great family man, and he\nwas the one who got false papers to these people. Somebody \u2014 and I do not know\nwho and why and how, betrayed him, and he went to jail for six months, because he\nnot only helped the relatives, he helped other people in getting false papers. At that\ntime, there were approximately 10,000 Polish and che \u2014 Czechoslovakian Jews\nliving illegally in ha \u2014- in Hungary. Hungary at that time was regarded as some sort\nof a haven, a safe haven for \u2014 for Jews. Again, the Hungarian government sort of\nknew about their existence and tolerated them, but that they were still illegal and\nthey had very little possibilities of \u2014 of doing anything. They couldn\u2019t work, they\nwere essentially charity cases for the \u2014 for their families.",
        "A: Yes. The \u2014 in 1943, there was an interesting incident, which really brought home\nthe frightening reality. My father was \u2014 as I mentioned, my father was inducted in\nNovember 13, 1997\n1940 to Carpathia-Ruthenia working on strategic roads. He was let go three\nmonths later, and in 1943, he was inducted again. This time he was taken to Kluge,\nTransylvania. Koloszvar, which is a \u2014 was again, part of the occupied territories\nby Hungary. He was doing some roadwork there as well. We visited him, because\nwe had some relatives who lived there, in Kluge, and we the \u2014 I remember very\nwell that he was quite lucky, because his commander was a decent man. His name\nwas Andoor(ph) Altoi(ph), and he was a very humane person. He recognized this\nwhole thing as being really ludicrous. And they \u2014 the \u2014 the men were able to, for\nexample, organize groups. Some of them we \u2014 more well-to-do men paid money\ninto a fund to get furloughs, and that money went to the families of the destitute.\nAnd the \u2014 the man who ran, Altoi(ph) who ran this \u2014 this brigade, this labor brigade\nallowed this to happen, and he did not allow the lower, non-com officers to \u2014 to hit\nthe Jews or \u2014 or \u2014 or do any kind of inhumane things. So in that respect, my father\nwas quite lucky in that. After he was deactivated, which was in the summer of 1942\n\u2014 three \u2014",
        "A: Well, we had a family tradition, we never went to \u2014 to the railroad station. We\nalways said goodbye at home. And it was a very traumatic experience, of course, he\nNovember 13, 1997\n\u2014 I remember his rucksack, his \u2014 his thing, he carried his things with him and he\nbought good shoes and things. And it was \u2014 we were always terribly distraught,\nbecause of course, we never knew how long my father would be taken, or if we\nwould ever see him again. It never \u2014 1t\u2019s sad, you know, you are inducted, and you\nhave to go to such and such a place within 48 hours. But we never knew what his\ndestination was. And then, of course, when we heard from him, when he was taken\nto a\u2014to Transylvania, it took roughly a month before we knew where he was.\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "A: Yes, as I mentioned to you, our \u2014 our family tradition was that we were not \u2014 we\n\u2014 we never went to the railroad station, we said goodbye at home and then he went\nto the railroad station himself. I \u2014 I like to step back in time, in 1942, because it was\nvery important and a very traumatic one. In April of \u201942, when 50,000 Hungarian\nNovember 13, 1997\nJewish slave laborer servicemen were inducted, men between the ages of 18 and 40\nwere inducted and they were taken to Ukraine. Among these were three of my\nuncles. My moth \u2014 my father was lucky because he was one year too old to be\ninducted, but my three uncles weren\u2019t. And I want to mention that there was a very\nlarge catastrophe which happened to them as well as to the 50,000, as well as\n200,000 Hungarian army personnel in January of 1943. There was an offensive in\nthe middle of the f \u2014 winter in the Don \u2014 bend of the Don river in the Ukraine,\nwhere the Soviet army had a counteroffensive and they \u2014 in six days they wiped out\n200,000 Hungarian army men, and 50,000 Jewish slave laborers; among them, two\nof my uncles died.",
        "A: Their name was \u2014 one was Bondi(ph) Kornhauser, and the other one was\nYanu(ph) Pick. And two of my other uncles, Lazlo Kornhauser and Lazlo Pick\nsurvived. We did not know that they did, but \u2014 but in fact, they did. And they came\nhome about a year and a half later, but the other ones died. And many friends whom\nwe knew who went, did not come back at that point. So I wanted to mention that. I\nalso wanted to mention that we found out late in 1942 that the German government\nasked the Hungarian government to implement the Final Solution in budap \u2014 in\nHungary, and the Hungarian government refused at that point. And this, of course,\nNovember 13, 1997\nwas a\u2014 was a great relief for us, and we really believed that the Hungarian\ngovernment is \u2014 is not going to let us go. We did not know what happened to the\nrest of \u2014 of European Jews. We were completely ignorant. And it is interesting\nbecause my father and I and my mother listened to the BBC every day, and there\nwas very \u2014 there was a lot of news about the war, how the war went, and I\nremember very well that we had a big map at home, and my father had pins, red\npins and white pins and we always looked at the \u2014 th-the map, and they were telling\nus where the \u2014 the offensives were, or what kind of battles, and my father was a\u2014 a\nvivid follower of all this. And there was a Hungarian speaking colonel on BBC,\nwho spoke not very good Hungarian, very accented Hungarian, but he was the \u2014 the\nwar correspondent, and he was the one who talked about all this, and we were very\n\u2014 very much listening to what was happening. There was no word, to my\nknowledge, which said anything about camps, or labor camps or deportation, or\nwhat happened to the Jews. Was very little, or nothing, nothing to my recollection.\nAnd in 1943 when \u2014 when this [indecipherable] breakthrough occurred, was a\ngreat sadness in Hungary. And I think that even the Jews, of course, felt sad\nbecause they knew how many Jews were killed. And as I mentioned, my next door\nneighbor was a \u2014 was an army officer, and my father and they \u2014 and he very often\nspoke about the \u2014 how the war was going. Now Hungary, of course, was a Nazi\nNovember 13, 1997\nally, and I \u2014 today I \u2014 I \u2014 to-today I\u2014 I\u2014I wonder, you know, this man, he really\nhad a great amount of goodwill, because he could denounce my father. I mean, my\nfather was trying to convince him that the Germans lost the war in 1943, and in the\nbeginning of \u00b044. And this man, of course he di \u2014 he \u2014 he \u2014 he talked to my father,\nbut I mean, this was a very dangerous thing my father was doing, and this man was\nreally decent enough not to \u2014 not to do anything. On the other hand, I remember\nanother man who lived in our building, who was a commander of a Jewish brigade,\nwho took this Jewish brigade to the Ukraine. And when he came home on furlough,\nhe was very proud of the fact that among his Jewish slave laborers, there were a\nnumber of extremely Orthodox Hassidim whose beard he personally cut and shaved\nand taught them the delights of eating pork. And this man, by name of Drexell(ph),\nhe was \u2014 Drexler(ph) rather, he was very proud of this.",
        "A: I\u2014I do not remember his first name, but I remember his last name. and he was\nmuch frightened after the war, because he knew that he made all these statements,\nand he was particularly frightened when he \u2014 when we returned, and he thought we\nwould denounce him; we did not. Going back to 1943, my father was deactivated,\nand after that we went to a \u2014 take a \u2014 a week \u2014 one week vacation to the mountains.\nAnd it was a \u2014a luxury hotel, and Jews were allowed to go there. There was only\nNovember 13, 1997\none hotel, which was not open to Jews, which was open to army personnel, army\nofficers actually. And it was a beautiful summer and we enjoyed ourselves very\nmuch. One afternoon, my mother and I took a walk in the woods. And there, in the\nwoods, we saw a large group of men in Nazi uniforms. They were the Hungarian\nNazis, called the Nyilas, and they had the rally there. And that was the first time we\nreally saw these people, and they were yelling and screaming and we were really\nfrightened. And we sort of managed to slip away, but \u2014 but this really sort of banged\nreality to our consciousness in terms of \u2014 well, here these people, we \u2014 we thought\nthese people were underground wi \u2014 they were e \u2014 theoretically illegal, they were\nnot allowed. Their leader was in jail, but yet they were organizing and they were\nmeeting in these places out in the mountains, in faraway places from Budapest, and\n\u2014 and we became more aware that these people were real. I mean, we \u2014 we \u2014 we\nknew the propaganda, we knew that these people existed, but this was my firsthand\nencounter with them.",
        "A: Well, it was quite frightening. We \u2014 we understood, and I understood what the\nuniform stood for, and \u2014\nNovember 13, 1997",
        "A: Well, I have seen a lot of propaganda leaflets, and they have, all over the city\nthey had these \u2014 these big propaganda photographs and \u2014 about the war effort and\nhow the \u2014 these people look in SS uniform, how did the Hungarian uniform look\nand how did this Hungarian Nazi uniform look. Particularly the one which we were\nwell aware is the armband which they wore, which were red and white stripes with\na \u2014a large Arrow Cross in the middle, green Arrow Cross. And we \u2014 we were \u2014 we\nrecognized that. And as I said, it\u2019s just the way they behaved was frightening\nenough and what they were yelling, slogans, all this kind of things. They were\nmostly nationalistic and racial slogans, and they were yelling slogans, you know,\ndeath to the Jews and all that. And of course that was quite, even at age nine, it was\nquite clear to me that these people were not our friends.",
        "A: Well, we didn\u2019t talk very much about it. I knew that my mother was very\nfrightened, and we sort of left, and we tried to sort of not to speak about this. We\nthought \u2014 we didn\u2019t ignore it, because I remember it, but we did not want to \u2014 she\ndidn\u2019t want to emphasize that, look, these people are terrible, and we are going to\nhave terrible times. We really hoped at that point that the war is turning, that we\nwill be able to survive. That before anything would happen, the war would be over.\nNovember 13, 1997",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Well, the \u2014 the \u2014 the next big change, what I remember was that in 19 \u2014 end of\n1943, beginning of 1944, my mother decided that I am now old enough to learn a\nlittle bit about music and culture. And next door we had a lady who happens to be\nJewish \u2014 happened to be Jewish, and who was a violin teacher. And we went there \u2014\nactually it was maybe 1943 when I started violin lessons. And I never got too far,\nbut what I did get out of it was a love of music. And I remember that in 1943, my\nmother decided that we were going to buy some season\u2019s tickets for a musical and\nopera performances. All the Jewish performers were thrown out from their jobs in\n1940 - \u00b041. And in Budapest, in the Jewish community center, there was a cult \u2014\nthere was a -\u2014 like a hall, culture hall. Small hall.",
        "A: In Pest. In [indecipherable] 12, and it\u2019s called the Goldmark Hall in memory\nof Karl Goldmark, who was a Jewish composer. And curiously and \u2014 and\nironically enough, the people who were thrown out for the first class, the best\nsingers, the best musicians. And so what they did, in order to make a living, they\nessentially organized their orchestra, and organized their \u2014 an opera company. And\nalmost daily they had concerts and opera performances, and it was a very vibrant\nNovember 13, 1997\nand I would \u2014 should say a better quality of performance than in the opera house. So\nmy mother bought tickets, and I remember that my first opera, which I saw, was\nRossini\u2019s \u201cMoses.\u201d And I saw a number of operas, Faust. And we had opera tickets\nlike once e-every two weeks, on Sundays. And we had opera tickets for \u201cThe\nQueen of Sheba,\u201d which was a Karl Goldmark opera for the \u2014 on the 20 \u2014 on the\n19\" of March, for the 19\" of March. And it was a sort of a birthday present for me\nbecause my birthday\u2019s the 28\" of March. So, we never went. Why didn\u2019t we?\nBecause on the morning of the 19\", the Germans came in, and the performance was\npostponed indefinitely. The school went on for a couple of more \u2014 I think maybe a\nweek or So.",
        "A: Yes, I remember the Germans came in, the tanks came in and it was very\nfrightening.",
        "A: Huge. I remember the Tigers, they were \u2014 they were unbelievably big. The\nTiger tanks were the \u2014 the largest German tanks. And I remember, as they rumbled\nthrough the city, and the street \u2014 we lived in a s \u2014 on a street which sort of led into\nthe center of the city. It was a wide street, and it was very much \u2014 it had streetcars,\nNovember 13, 1997\nbut it ha \u2014 it had enough room for tanks. I remember also 12 years later in 1956,\nwhen the Russian tanks rumbled on the same street, toward the center of the city.\nBut on that 19\" of March, it was absolutely frightening because we did not know\nwhat was going to happen. We knew that something terrible had happened. We\nheard the radio, and it was, you know, every hour on the hour there were more\nthings, saying, you know, orders given to various units. Hungarian units do this, you\nknow, fari \u2014 code words or code numbers, you know, 12th Hungarian division, be\nalert, or bring \u2014 bring yourselves to whatever city, and so forth. And what I\nremember is the confusion, and the \u2014 the disbelief that this could happen to us, and\nthe \u2014 an-and the belief that \u2014 that now, something which we didn\u2019t think would\nhappen, will. And of course, the optimist would say well, you know, what can the\nGermans do\u2019? The Germans came in because \u2014 we know why they came in, because\nthe Russians are pushing the German army toward the west and the Germans want\nto make sure that the \u2014 the German army has a retreat, you know, it wants to make\nsure that \u2014 that \u2014 that it could retreat. We also knew somewhat earlier that the\nHungarian government was already discussing peace feelers with \u2014 with the Brits,\nand that that government was quite liberal and looked the other way. Well, that all\nchanged on that day. In three days a new government was sworn in, Dome Sztojay,\nwho was a-\u2014 p-prior to this was the \u2014 the ambassador of Hungary to Berlin. And he\nNovember 13, 1997\nwas essentially a \u2014 an \u2014 he \u2014 he didn\u2019t speak very good Hungarian, he was a\nGerman himself. There were these Germans in the west side of Hungary, groups of\nGermans living there, we called them Schwabs. They were the \u2014 th-the ethnic\nGermans, and Szt\u00e9jay was one of them. And his government was containing the\nextreme Nazi elements. The only thing which was relatively heartening to us is that\nthe \u2014 that Horthy, who was the head of the government, stayed. Now, we found out\nthat Horthy was out of the country, and \u2014 but he came back later that afternoon. He\nwas with Hitler, and of course that was the trick Hitler used; while Horthy was\nout, that\u2019s when the \u2014 they came. We also found out that a couple of days later, that\nEichmann and company also showed up in Budapest. The reason why I know this\nis that my mother had an uncle who was a very prominent lawyer, and who was still\npracticing law in 1943. And the reason why he was \u2014 were two reasons. One is that\nhe was a World War I hero, a very decorated captain of the Austro-Hungarian army,\nand he was exempt from Jewish law. And secondly, he was a good friend of the\nGerman ambassador, Jakov. Well, Jakov left, Veesenmeyer came in. And va \u2014\nbefore Jakov left, he told my Grand-uncle Paul, Paul Kornhauser, whose son was\nlost in Voronezh, that Paul, things are changing. But Paul was a Germanophile all\nhis life, a-an admirer of Germany. Never really believed that anything could\nhappen to him. He was a prominent Jew. He was not very religious, but he was very\nNovember 13, 1997\nactive in the Jewish community. Many of the Jewish leaders told him that he\u2019s on a\nlist, that he should go into hiding. Well, he didn\u2019t. In fact, when he got his\nsummons, the first one ha \u2014 Eichmann did the same thing as he did everywhere\nelse, he\u2019s \u2014 he summoned the prominent Jewish leaders the first three days or four\ndays after this occupation, to a \u2014 a interim camp, and my uncle, my great-uncle took\nhis dress uniform, his Hungarian dress uniform with all his medals and went in and\ndemanded to be exempted from all these things. Well, they didn\u2019t exempt him at all.\nIn fact, they \u2014 they captured him and in a week, he and a hundred prominent Jewish\nleaders were sent to Auschwitz and he died there. So we knew that things are\nhappening. We also knew that by the fifth of April \u2014 on the 28\" of March, my 10\"\nbirthday came out a \u2014 the law that we must wear the yellow stars in a week. So by\nthe fifth of April we all wore the yellow stars. That was sort of my 10\" birthday\npresent.",
        "A: Well, it \u2014 it certainly was \u2014 was something different. I was not very easy to\naccept that now everybody knows that I am different. I mean, up until now I \u2014\npeople the \u2014 we \u2014 we lived in a house where \u2014 in a building where two or three\nJewish families lived, the rest of them were not. This was not a \u2014 an issue, I mean,\nalthough anti-Semitism we knew about, but as I said, there were a number of\nNovember 13, 1997\nChristians who were friends, and sympathetic. But now, this was a \u2014 a \u2014a huge sign\non one\u2019s coat. It was easy to see who was. And of course, we did not know who the\n\u2014 the \u2014 the enemies were. Whom, we didn\u2019t know. And it was \u2014",
        "A: No, I was not unhappy being \u2014 being Jewish. No, at that part \u2014 time, I was\nalready very consciously Jewish. We had the Bible studies and Hebrew in \u2014 in\nelementary school, and I was much more conscious about being Jewish.",
        "A: Oh I cert \u2014 I would have preferred to be not there, so \u2014 for sure, but I don\u2019t\nknow. I\u2014 I would say that I was \u2014 I was a proud Jew. I w \u2014 I was \u2014 probably\nwouldn\u2019t prefer to be anything but a Jew, but I certainly would have preferred to be\nnot a Jew who is \u2014 who is going to be sent to the slaughterhouse. And what \u2014 what\nhappened there in the \u2014 on the same day when we started to have to wear this\nJewish star, my father and other Jewish men from 18 to 60 were inducted again. So\nessentially, my mother, my grandmother and I stayed behind, and my grandparents.",
        "A: Yes, and I remember that \u2014 that it was in the newspapers, you know, they were \u2014\nthey were telling us exactly how big is has to be, and how yellow and y-you \u2014 you\ncould buy this material, but 1t cannot be orange, it has to be very lemon yellow, and\nNovember 13, 1997\nit has to be this big and this wide and all these things. And I remember how we \u2014 we\nwere cutting it on the \u2014 on the table, on the dining room table, these things and we\nwere counting how many we need for the outer garments and inner garments, and it\nwas a\u2014 and then my mother and grandmother were sewing it. And we had to wear it\non the \u2014 right above our hearts on the left side. But what was really traumatic was \u2014\nis as I said, is my father had to leave again, and this time, of course, what do we do?\nAnd we didn\u2019t hear from him for a long while, and about a month or so later, we\nheard rumors that the \u2014 that the Jews in the countryside \u2014 and I had 150 relatives \u2014\nare starting to be gathered into ghettos. And there was an interesting things which\nhappened, which was another lost opportunity. My mother\u2019s family had a friend,\nand his \u2014 he was a \u2014 a romane \u2014 he was \u2014 he was a Romanian, or he lived in\nRomania, but he was Hungarian. And he came to Budapest in April, middle of\nApril, and came to my mother and said \u2014",
        "A: Ninte \u2014 1944, correct. And he said to her, he said, look, things in Romania are\ncome and gone. I\u2019ll take George with me, and he\u2019ll be safe with me. My mother\nrefused. So this was another missed opportunity. And then he went and we never\nheard of him afterwards. We n\u2014 we don\u2019t know what happened to him and his\nfamily. But he is a\u2014 he was an old friend, and he was a trustworthy friend. But,\nNovember 13, 1997\nwhether it would have been better for me to go with him, or not, who knows?\nObviously, in the final [indecipherable] I was okay at the end. That happened in\nApril. We didn\u2019t hear about my relatives except these rumors, and these rumors\nwere getting more and more disturbing. Then we had a lot of different rules and\nregulations. We had to submit our radio, our bicycles, our telephone. And we were\ncut off from the world, because we had no radio, for example. So we didn\u2019t know\nwhat was going on.",
        "A: I\u2014I-\u2014TIhad to give up my bicycle, I had to give up my \u2014 our radios, jewelry.",
        "A: Yes, I did. I would say yes. I \u2014 I \u2014 it was difficult, and probably more difficult\nwas the radio, because it was a lifeline for us. And \u2014",
        "A: Oh, we would \u2014 we talk more \u2014 more about typical children\u2019s thing, in the\nschool. The school was abruptly ending. By the middle of April, we had no school,\nit was all finished. It was the \u2014 I completed the fourth grade, I got my paper saying\nthat I completed the fourth grade and \u2014 and the Jewish kids no longer were allowed\nto go to school. I remember the fi \u2014 about two weeks after we had the \u2014 the red \u2014 the\nNovember 13, 1997\nyellow star on us, we still went to school, but then it was over and they told us that\nwe should come in October to rigi \u2014 to register for the gymnasium, for high school.\nOctober was not a good time to register that year, unfortunately. At home, there\nwere just too many things happening. We were listening \u2014 the radio we couldn\u2019t\nlisten to, but they had these \u2014 these announcements which they mounted on the\nwalls. And every day there was 20 - 30 different things, you know. We were\nrushing around and we were trying to make sure that we have food at home, we\nwere \u2014",
        "A: They were \u2014 they were newspaper, mostly the newspaper was used. There was\none thing which I remember in April; my father was still there, before they took\nhim. It was the first raid on Budapest, bombing \u2014 bombing raid. And my\ngrandfather, as I mentioned, on my father\u2019s side, who lived with my aunt, whose\nhusband was also inducted into the Ukraine, they lived in a small house, not too far\nfrom where we lived. And in this particular raid, their house was hit. We didn\u2019t\nknow this, but my father, after the raid was over, went \u2014 was worried and went over\nto see what happened. And it turned out that they were in the basement, and except\nfor my aunt, who got hit by something 1n the face, and bleeding, the grandparents\nwere Okay, and there was also a cousin. So all \u2014 all of them were brought, my\nNovember 13, 1997\nmother, my father brought them over. And my aunt was bleeding. Her name was\nElizabeth. And in our building, there was a doctor. And he was visiting \u2014 actually\nwas not living there, but he visited his sister and his mother, who lived there. They\nwere ethnic Germans, and he was an \u2014 an SS officer. And I don\u2019t know how and\nwhy so naively my father and mother went over to him, and asked him to help, give\nfirst aid help to my \u2014 to my aunt. So, rather naively my father went down to ask this\nSS doctor to help my aunt. I was there with him, and \u2014 with my aunt. And this man\n\u2014 I never forget his expression, he had very light blue eyes, and the amount of\nhatred which \u2014 which came out, was incredible and indescribable. What he said, I\u2019d\nnever forget, he says, you dirty Jews, you think I will help you? He says, you will \u2014\nyou will die just your brothers and sisters did, very soon. And then took and\nslammed the door in front of our faces. And I was completely flabbergasted, and I\nwas surprised and shocked by this. We knew his mother and his sister for years.\nThey lived \u2014 they were just a couple of \u2014 lived a \u2014 lived just a couple of doors away\nfrom where we were. They were never very friendly people, but I \u2014 we never\nrealized that, you know, how much of a Nazi they were and he was. In fact, one of\nthe interesting side \u2014 not interesting, tragic, I should say, was that he also at that\ntime \u2014 I found out later on that he was bragging that he himself killed 20 Jews. He\nwas one of the Nazi doctors who did experiments apparently, in the camps. I don\u2019t\nNovember 13, 1997\nknow what happened to him after the war. I know that his mother and his sister\nsurvived and stayed there.",
        "A: I\u2014I wish I could tell you the names. I \u2014 I \u2014 I\u2014 I wrote down the names, but I\ndon\u2019t have it in my head. It starts with an H. A-As \u2014 if I remember, I \u2014 PII \u2014 I'll let\nyou know later. But that was right before my father was taken away in \u2014 in the\nmiddle of April. Once my father was taken, and as I mentioned, we were in a\u2014 ina\npanic every day because they had pages and pages of new regulations and orders,\nwhich in \u2014 which affected us. What we have to \u2014 what we cannot use, what we have\nto give in, and then finally, when we heard these rumors about what happened to the\n\u2014 the Jews in the provinces \u2014 you know, these were just slight rumors, and then we\ngot \u2014 but we were very busy then, because we \u2014 we got the order that we have to\nvacate our apartment, and we have to move into these special Jewish houses.",
        "A: Well, I know that my father never thought of it. My mother, in April heard that if\nyou get a baptismal certificate, you may be exempt from something, and she talked\nto my father about it, and my father said, well, go ahead if you want to do it; [am\nNovember 13, 1997\nnot going to do it. And I remember that she and I went a couple of times, maybe\ntwice, to a convent not too far from where we lived, where we had these \u2014 they call\nthem white sisters. White sisters\u2019 convent. And they were giving a group of Jews\nlessons about the catechism. And we went, I think, maybe twice, and then my\nmother saw the futility of it, and she said no, forget it. So \u2014",
        "A: It \u20141t didn\u2019t bother me to do it. I didn\u2019t understand the catechism at all. I\ncouldn\u2019t understand what \u2014 it was like Chinese to me. But \u2014 but the \u2014 the sisters\nwere kind, and it was \u2014 if it were something which would really help, I would say\nwhy \u2014 why not to do it? I mean, a lot of people did it. It turned out that \u2014 that\nconversions did not help at all. My \u2014 my uncle, who was converted because he\nbelieved in Catholicism, by the Primate of Hungary in the early 30s, and who went\nto church every Sunday, was inducted as a Jew, because both his parents were\nJewish and he was Jewish and his conversion was too late, and the only difference\nbetween him and my father was that he wore a white armband while my father wore\na yellow armband. And \u2014 but he got the same treatment, in fact worse, and he ended\nup in Auschwitz and he was gassed. So we knew that \u2014 that conversions were, at\nthat point, ineffective, but when in \u2014 when you are in a situation like this, you try\nanything and everything you can. But it always struck me and it always stayed with\nNovember 13, 1997\nme, that despite of the fact that my father was \u2014 I don\u2019t think he had gone into a\nsynagogue a half a dozen times in his last 20 years of his life, he still would refuse\nto do this, and that he was very much of a \u2014 a-\u2014a Jew. But he allowed us to, if he\nwanted to, they gave us this \u2014 this \u2014 this choice. So, what happened to us then, May\ncame, and we got the \u2014 the order that we have to move. And we moved in June,\ntoward the end of June. We were not allowed to take any furniture with us, only\nbeds, and only the most crucial clothing.\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nNovember 13, 1997\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "A: It was June 17 when \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 1944 when we had the, essentially the deadline to move. And my grandmother,\nmyself and my mother moved in \u2014 in with my grandmother\u2019s younger sister, who\nlived about two or three blocks away.",
        "A: Well, they \u2014 they \u2014 they notified by \u2014 via newspaper, essentially everybody \u2014 the\nnewspapers came out, as I mentioned, with many, many orders every day. And\nrepeated deadlines, you know, when you have to move out and what houses are\navailable and so forth. So it was av \u2014 a lot of bureaucratic \u2014 but very fast. I mean,\nthe time the deadlines were days instead of weeks or months. And it was quite lucky\nfor us that we had, in this apartment house where we moved to, we had several\nrelatives living there, on Columbus Street. We lived in Elizabeth Street, which was\na main street. Columbus Street was like a side street.\nNovember 13, 1997",
        "A: Yes, I\u2014I took some toys; not very many, because there was just no room for\nthat, because we moved into a two room place. The si \u2014 the three of us occupied one\nroom, and my grandmother\u2019s sister, her daughter, and the \u2014 and her daughter\u2019s\nbrother occupied another room. And then we had a meet \u2014 or ev \u2014 or almost every\napartment had a maid room \u2014 maid\u2019s room over the kitchen. And they took a single\nwoman there, so she was the seventh person living in a two room place. And the\nonly thing we could take 1s a \u2014 1s essentially our beds. And I remember, the room\nwas not that ver \u2014 large, and it was wall to wall beds. We had nowhere to eat, or we\nhad to sit on a sofa bed to eat, essentially. And this was the \u2014 as I said, the 17\" of\nJune, and we heard rumors that things are happening in the countryside. We did not\nknow precisely what.",
        "A: They were \u2014 they had the large yellow star, as if to tell people that this \u2014 this is a\nbuilding where, you know, Jews live, or lepers live, whatever you want. There was\none apartment which was occupied by a Christian family. The man was the super of\nthe apartment, his name was Mr. Vargo(ph), Janus(ph) Vargo(ph). He was a\ndecent fellow, and as you will hear, the \u2014 his actions were quite crucial in saving\nour lives; both my grandmothers and the relatives there, and my mother\u2019s and mine.\nWe settled in, essentially in the last week of June. There were a few young people, I\nNovember 13, 1997\nwas the youngest kid, there were no kids. There were a few teenagers, mostly older\npeople. And almost daily, toward the end of June, we started to have to go down to\nthe air raid shelter, because of air raids. I remember one particular day very vividly,\nand that was July the second, 1944; it was a Sunday. And even before, I was always\nworried about air raids, because evas \u2014 ever since the April air raid, ever since my\naunt was hurt, I was afraid. And I remember once Mr. Vargo(ph) [indecipherable]\nwas on the second of July, he \u2014 after everybody was ordered to the air raid shelter,\nhe took me upstairs to the \u2014 just to the street level, to show me how beautiful those\nairplanes are. And they were, I mean, indeed, huge airplanes coming in, hundreds of\nthem. And I \u2014 I can never forget the \u2014 the tremendous number. I mean, they almost\ncovered the sky. And we were out there maybe one or two minutes, and then I said\nno, I don\u2019t want to stay there, I want to go downstairs. So we did. And we sat there\nvery quietly for about 10 minutes and then all of a sudden we heard this tremendous\ncrash. At first is a whistling sound, a crash and the whole building shook up. And I\nstarted to scream and everybody else did too, and my mother sort of put my \u2014 my\nhead against her \u2014 her bosom and trying to put her hands again \u2014 in my \u2014 on my\nears so that I wouldn\u2019t hear this. And a few minutes later another, even larger\nsound, and it was like an earthquake. And we saw \u2014 we had these blast do \u2014 doors\nleading to the outside, and \u2014 and it\u2019s \u2014 this \u2014 this is a very heavy steel door. And\nNovember 13, 1997\nalong the door you see this brilliant light coming in. Of course, by then the\nelectricity was gone, and we were sitting in the pitch dark. And \u2014 and this \u2014 this was\nlike \u2014 like hell. And it went on for three hours, and we had four more very close\nhits, and we didn\u2019t think that we were going to survive, and then we did. And after\nthree hours we came up, and what we saw was incredible. We had \u2014 this building\nwas a three story apartment building. It was sort of stood by itself. About a hundred\nyards behind it, there was a six story apartment building, which was hit. And the\nonly thing \u2014 and it was a Jewish house, with the same yellow star like we did. The\nonly thing which stayed up there was one fire wall, and everything was down on \u2014\nin a big heap, and people were dead. Across the street there was a villa, a private\nhome, before the raid. Afterwards, there was just a huge crater in the \u2014 crater in the\n\u2014 on the \u2014 on the \u2014 on the earth, and you could see body parts. You could see hands\nand legs and [indecipherable]. And this \u2014 the right side had four tennis courts,\nnothing but a big crater. And the left side was a \u2014 just a vacant lot, and a crater. So\nessentially, within a hundred yards of the building, we had four huge bombs hit.\nAnd I could almost feel even today this \u2014 this smell of \u2014 of \u2014 of death there and \u2014\nand \u2014 and everything was smoking, and it was blackened, and purple, the sky was\npurple. And some people were optimists. I \u2014 I just can\u2019t believe that people said\nwell, maybe this is the end. Maybe \u2014 maybe this was used as a \u2014 as a camouflage to\nNovember 13, 1997\n\u2014 to drop paratroopers here, and maybe the Brits and the Americans are here, and\nwe will be coming \u2014 we\u2019ll be freed. And of course, that was not the case at all.\nWhat was the real story was that it was the first carpet bombing of Budapest, and\n30 percent of the city went \u2014 was in ruins, and the Jews were blamed for it. And \u2014",
        "A: Well, the propaganda, I mean, the \u2014 the radios were blaring that it was a Jewish\nconspiracy, that Jews left their lights on their buildings to show where the \u2014 where\nthe city was, because of course we had blackouts at \u2014 at night. Well, blackou \u2014 and\n\u2014 and of course, if you were caught with any kind of light seeping through, that was\na punishable \u2014 death punishable offense. And when \u2014 we were very careful looking\naround all the time, to make sure that there is no light, because we were accused of\n\u2014 of spying, too.",
        "A: It was. Actually, these kind of dead bodies. There was one dead body I saw a\nfew days before this. And this happened because there was a pharmacist who lived\nin our building and who poisoned himself, he committed suicide, and I saw him.",
        "A: Jewish pharmacist who lived there, and I saw him being taken away ina\nstretcher and he was \u2014 his hands were \u2014 I didn\u2019t see his face because it was turned,\nNovember 13, 1997\nbut his hands were yellow and were sort of hanging down from the stretcher. And\nthat was the first dead body. But the number of dead bodies after this raid, they\nwere \u2014 they were really huge. And the first time that I saw this kind of \u2014 it\u2019s not just\ndead, I mean, they were bloody. It was \u2014 was \u2014 was \u2014 was like hell.",
        "A: Well, I was absolutely frightened. After this, every t-two \u2014 twice a day, all\nregular like clockwork, at 11 0\u2019clock in the morning, the \u2014 the westerns allies came,\nand then nine o\u2019clock at night the Russians came in bombing raids. And every time\nthis happened, my mother had a huge pillow, which she put on my head. And to\nshow you how traumatic it was, it took 30 years for me to be able to sleep without a\npillow over my head. And \u2014 and it was \u2014 it was an absolute trauma. I mean, I \u2014 I \u2014\neven today, if I hear some unexpected large noise, loud noise, I would jump. We did\nnot know it at the time, that besides the air raid, we had an even deadlier situation\ndeveloping in Budapest. What had happened is 3,000 gendarmes came out \u2014 came\nup to Budapest two days before, in process, or in \u2014 in the process of wanting us to\nbe deported. In other words, by this \u2014 by the first of July, most of the Hungarian\nJews from the countryside were deported. The only community alive was\nBudapest. My 150 relatives were largely dead by then. We did not know this, but\nwhat had happened is the extreme Nazis wanted to commit a coup, and get rid of\nNovember 13, 1997\nHorthy. And they got these 3,000 gendarmes for two reasons; one is to prepare for\ndeportation of the Jews, and number two is to get rid of Horthy. And there was\nonly just a few, the courage of a few army officers who were available and who\nwere ready to follow orders. And one single army unit, a Panzer division was\nwilling to come to Budapest to counteract this \u2014 not necessarily the deportation of\nthe Jews, but the \u2014 the coup against the region. And by the second of July, they\nwere around Budapest, taking up positions. By the seventh of July, they forced\nthese gendarmes to leave. And Horthy declared that that day, that they deportations\nwould stop. And that, of course, saved our lives, because with 3,000 gendarmes, we\nwould be deported in probably a week, or two weeks. I mean, in six weeks, almost\n500,000 Hungarian Jews were deported from the countryside. You can imagine that\n160 to 180,000 Jews in \u2014 in Budapest, were concentrated, could be deported in a\nmatter of days. But we were not. And that saved our lives. What happened after this\nwas a\u2014a little miracle. Eichmann left. He was frustrated by this inaction by the\nHungarian government. And he also knew that things were not going well in the\nfront. What we didn\u2019t know, but he did, and many of the Nazis did, 1s that the\nHungarian government started again some negotiations with the western allies and\neven with the Russians. And these negotiations, essentially, they wanted to manifest\nthis \u2014 their good will. So the way they did it 1s they essentially replaced the\nNovember 13, 1997\ngovernment with a \u2014 a government of army officers, who were not as extreme. And",
        "A: I did not personally see Eichmann, no.",
        "A: I have seen Horthy, yes, when I was a kid, yes.",
        "A: Well, he was a handsome old man. He was \u2014 he was an [indecipherable] but he\nwas a\u2014a horseman, and he \u2014 he rode the white horse. And we had a national\nholiday on the 20\" of August, which was a holiday for the first king of Hungary,\nSaint Steven. And what I remember about \u2014 maybe I was six or seven when my\nfather took me to this day \u2014 the \u2014 the Saint Steven\u2019s day on the 20\" of August was a\ngreat holiday, because his right hand was, as a miracle, was preserved. Now, this\nman died a thousand years ago, and his right hand was the icon of Hungary, and\nthey took this right hand and \u2014 and they took it all around the city, you know,\nthere\u2019s a whole procession. And Horthy used to ride the horse, also. And I\nremember this procession in the late 30s, when this had happened. And I saw him\nonce after that. In 1938, if I remember, there was a huge, Catholic congress in\nBudapest, where the pope came, and \u2014 or at least the man who became pope later,\nNovember 13, 1997\nPius the 12\". And he spoke and Horthy was with him and I saw \u2014 I remember that\nI saw \u2014 this was a huge thing. He was not just a Catholic thing, he was everybody\u2019s\nthing, and I saw Horthy that time again, the second time.",
        "A: He was not a hero to me, but he was not a villain, either. We knew that he had\nJewish friends. We knew that his best poker partner was a Jewish industrialist my \u2014\nby name of Goldberger(ph) and Weiss(ph). And his wife was connected to \u2014 there\nwas a rumor that his wife had Jewish blood in her. And that \u2014 we knew that his\nolder son, married to a\u2014 a countess who was very much pro-Jew. In fact, it turned\nout that \u2014 that she was working for the \u2014 the \u2014 the anti-Nazi resistance. And she\u2019s\nstill alive. She\u2019s a very old lady now. And we knew that \u2014 that Horthy, if he was\nnot pro-Jewish, he had friends, and he was not the worst. He was not a hero, but he\n\u2014as I said, he was not a villain either. So going back to my story, we did not know,\nbut we were saved. After Horthy changed the government, things started to be a\nlittle easier. Up until then, we only had like one or two hours where we could go out\nto the street. We were \u2014 we had a \u2014 given a couple of more hours of freedom, free\ntime to go to the street, to shop, for example.",
        "A: Well, I was a lonely child, I \u2014 I didn\u2019t have people to play with, so I played with\nmy toys, and I was with the relatives. They played cards, and I sort of sat next to my\nmother, and they had a\u2014 a game which they played every \u2014 a day, which was a sort\nof a superstition. I \u2014 I don\u2019t know if this game exists here, I guess it does. There is a\n[indecipherable] like a \u2014 a [indecipherable] with alphabets, with \u2014 with various\nABC and so forth. And what they do is they put a \u2014 an upside-down \u2014 a turned\nwater glass, and they put their hands on and then supposedly a ghost comes and\nthen pushes the glass and then spells out things and tells you your answers, you\nknow, and most of the questions were, are we going to have an air raid tonight, you\nknow, and of course we didn\u2019t need to know the answer, we knew that it was\ncoming. But, you know, some people believed this, and we played that every day.\nThat was a\u2014a-\u2014a game we played. And we also, as I said, we played various \u2014\nvarious games, word games, and I was sort of tolerated by the adults. And I was\ntrying to be a fly on the wall most of the time, and didn\u2019t do too much. Wasn\u2019t very\nhappy and wasn\u2019t very active. I was reading a lot actually, I had a few books and I\nwas reading. I \u2014 I was \u2014 my favorite author was Jules Verne, and since I was all\n[indecipherable] up, I was reading about \u201c20,000 Leagues Under the Sea,\u201d and\nFive Weeks in the A-Air \u2014 Air Balloon, and things like that. I \u2014 I was always\ninterested in \u2014 in adventures, and it was certainly an ironic time to read about those\nNovember 13, 1997\nadventures. And that\u2019s what I did. And the summer went relatively fast, and \u2014 and it\nwas lucky, because my father\u2019s unit was brought back from the western parts of\nHungary, where they built fortifications to Budapest. And my father was lucky\nbecause his commander was a decent man again. Turned out that his \u2014 the\ncommander\u2019s fianc\u00e9e was Jewish, and she lived in our building. And the\ncommander sort of looked the other way when half of his brigade sort of\ndisappeared every evening, and reappeared every early morning. This was strictly\nillegal. If a man was caught, he \u2014 under the circumstances, he would be subject to\nimmediate execution. Nevertheless, my father, about two, three times a week, took\nthis chance and came home late at night, after curfew, and Mr. Vargo(ph) let him\nin. Mr. Vargo(ph) got a few hundred peng\u00e9s for this act, but nevertheless, he took a\nchance too. My father came in for a few hours, and then he went back early in the\nmorning. So it was happiness that we have seen him at that time. And again, the\neternal optimist said well, 1t couldn\u2019t last long. The Russians were already fighting.\nWe knew the Romanians were out of the war already, and \u2014 and they know \u2014 we\nalso knew that, you know, the war couldn\u2019t last for more than a week or two. I\nmean, the Russians were less than a hundred kilometers from Budapest at this\npoint. So the October 15 rolled around, and October 15 was a very tumultuous and\nvery important day. That was the day when Horthy declared that Hungary was\nNovember 13, 1997\nbecoming a neutral country, and that Hungary essentially threw in the towel. Well,\nI can tell you that 1t was unreal for us. We heard this on loudspeakers, and we went\nout, and we ra \u2014 ripped al \u2014 our yellow stars off, and we were absolutely hysterical.\nBut the people around us were yelling down from their windows that we are just a\nlittle bit too premature, we are a little bit too happy. And they said, well, you dirty\nJews, don\u2019t think that you will survive. And indeed, they were more prophetic that\nwe realized, because in a couple of hours, the \u2014 this \u2014 this coup was over. In fact,\nwith German help, the most extreme Nazis, Hungarian Nazis took over. The ar \u2014 the\nArrow Cross. And we heard Mr. Vargo\u2019s(ph) radio, he was nice enough to open his\ndoors so people could hear through the radio, when they were looking for\nBarakti(ph) Burger(ph), who was the extreme Nazi general to come to Budapest\nimmediately to assume the \u2014 the \u2014 the command of the \u2014 the troops. And we heard\nby the end of the day that Horthy was arrested and then that Szalasi became the\nhead of the state and a new government was sworn in. And this was the 15\". Ten\ndays later, all the women between the ages of \u2014 Jewish women, ages of 18 and 40\nwere ordered to come to a soccer field, which was the Kishauk(ph) soccer field.\nAnd this impacted my aunts, Elizabeth, who was 29, with a baby of three years old,\nand Yoli(ph), who was 38, with a cousin of mine, who was my age, 11 \u2014 10 \u2014 10\nand a half. And my mother was 43, so she was too old to go, but they did. And\nNovember 13, 1997\n10,000 young women went. The women who had children were excused, and\nYoli(ph) left, but Elizabeth didn\u2019t. She was too tired, she was just \u2014 she said, I \u2014 I \u2014\nI just give up. And the \u2014 she was one of the ones who were deported. At that time\nthey had no transportation except to walk. They had these death marches. And she\nmade the death march, we knew that she did, because her friends who survived told\nus. She got to Ravensbrick, and she died a few days before liberation. She was 29.\nHer baby daughter, Susan, was hidden by an aunt who was not Jewish, who was a\nwife of my uncle, Lazlo Pick. Now Lazlo Pick was one of the uncles who went to\nthe Ukraine in 1941. He was a thin, skinny man, but he was a tenacious sports\nperson. And he walked the 800 miles. He just got back in March of 1944, just in\ntime for the next round. And he was to be deported in September, but he didn\u2019t wait\nfor that, he took his rucksack, left it and went home, where his wife, in an efficiency\napartment not very much bigger than this one, hid him in a closet for three months.\nAnd she also hid the baby, my cousin Susan, and they survived. My father came\nhome in the beginning of November, with the news that he got the 24 hours\nfurlough, and that he is going \u2014 he wa \u2014 if he 1s going back next mon \u2014 next day in\nthe morning, he 1s to go to the railroad station, and he knows that he was going to be\ntaken to Germany, and he was not about to go back. He had a friend, and they had\na plan. The plan was that they were going to my grandfather\u2019s abandoned building,\nNovember 13, 1997\nwhich was in ruins, but the basement was in fairly good shape. And they knew the\nwar was going to be over in a week, so they would go there and they would just\nstick it out there. And my father left, and we didn\u2019t know what happened. This was\nthe sixth of November. We didn\u2019t know anything. On the 22\"4 of November, a \u2014 an\narmy man came over and we were very surprised, I mean, you don\u2019t see an army\nsoldier coming to a Jewish house. And he came in and he wanted to talk to my\nmother and he handed her a note. And the note said that \u2014 was a one sentence that\nsaid, you and George follow this soldier and come immediately where he will take\nyou. Well, my mother was unhappy about this, because she didn\u2019t want to leave my\ngrandmother and everybody. And \u2014 and \u2014 or the \u2014 the message was not to tell\nanybody anything. And so we went, but my mother didn\u2019t take anything except me\nwith her. And we went to this place, which was a factory building on the other side\nof town, in a blue collar neighborhood, called Chango(ph) Street. And it was a\nfactory, a textile factory. And the soldier took us there and we met my father. It\nturned out that this factory was a camouflage place, where they had a bunch of\nJews, Jewish men, hidden. The outs \u2014 for the outside world this factory was a\nfactory for army uniforms, Hungarian army uniforms. My father was quite mad at\nus when he saw that we just came with nothing, and told us to go back immediately,\nand come the very same evening, come hell or high water. So my mother saw when\nNovember 13, 1997\n\u2014 when \u2014 when she saw \u2014 when she saw that he was mad, we went home. We got\nback and we were terribly rushed, because we had maybe a half an hour before\ncurfew. And she threw in a couple of \u2014 she \u2014 the thing which she was most worried\nabout were the family photos. And she threw in a f\u2014 the family photos in a small\nbag, which I still have. And she also put a little food in, and nothing else. While we\nwere in the midst of this desperate packing, the house was raided by two teenage\nNazis. And they came in, one must not been \u2014 I don\u2019t think one was more than 13\nand the other one maybe 16 - 17. They had submachine guns with them. And they\nwent and they rampaged the whole place. They \u2014 they broke things, they stole\nthings, they made a mess. They saw these little thing which my mother put together,\nthis little bag, and threw it on the floor and stomped on it, and they terrorized\neverybody for a couple of hours. And then they finally left. And this was after the\ncurfew. So my mother put everything back and begged Mr. Vargo(ph) to let us out.\nAgain, little money changed hands and Vargo(ph) let us out and we went. And we\ngot there \u2014 this was end of November, toward the end of November, so it was a\nshort day, just like today. And by six o\u2019clock or so, it was quite late la \u2014 quite dark.\nWe got there and my father was really relieved to see us, and told us how he got\nthere, because we didn\u2019t know what was going on. So he told us that he went to this\nrendezvous place with his friend, his name was Gargutzi(ph). And Gargutzi(ph)\nNovember 13, 1997\nnever showed up. He was caught in a raid, and he was killed. So my father was in a\npanic, and went to a friend of his, by the name of Gaykis(ph), who was a Christian\nbusiness associate, and told him that he needs to hide somewhere. Well Gaykis(ph)\ntold him that he would be happy to help. He gave him this address, it\u2019s\nChangutca(ph) 6B address, and gave him a note. Told him to \u2014 not to talk to\nanybody, just go there, hand the note to the commanding officer of this army \u2014\nfactory. My father did just that, and he handed the note to the soldier and \u2014 and the\nsoldier took back the note to the army commander and then the door opened and he\nwas let in, and the army commander went to see him. The army commander turned\nout to be a Jew who was a friend of my father\u2019s, and who was playing this role. He\nwas a spit and polished army \u2014 army commander uniform. And he told my father\nthat 65 people who escaped from deportation are also there. They are all men, and\nhe is welcome. And this was in the beginning of November. Toward the middle of\nNovember, the man who heard the news \u2014 they were much better informed, of\ncourse, than us, that things are happening throughout town, they knew about the\ndeportation of the women. They started to bring their families in. So my father also\ntook this \u2014 sent a soldier who was a deserter \u2014 a real, bona fide soldier, but a\ndeserter, to the note \u2014 with the note to my mother, and that\u2019s how we got there.\nWell, my mother didn\u2019t bring anything and so my father\u2019s overcoat served for the\nNovember 13, 1997\nnext three months as our blanket. We did not know what had happened, but this is\nwhat happened, the very next day: the Arrow Cross raiders came back, and took\neverybody from the building where we lived, to the brickyards. And at that point,\nMr. Vargo(ph), who knew of a brother, my grandmothers had a \u2014 two sisters and a\nbrother in Budapest. And a brother lived in a Swedish house, Swedish \u2014",
        "A: A safe house, correct, safe house, which was a \u2014 was saved by Wallenberg. And\nMr. Vargo(ph) ran to this man, by the name of Beyla(ph) Kornhaus \u2014 Beyla\nSpitzer(ph), and tell him that \u2014 told him that his three sisters were in the brick\nfactories. And Spitzer was able to get in touch with Wallenberg, who went and\ntook the three ladies, and one lady\u2019s daughter with her \u2014 with him, and took \u2014 took\n\u2014 took these four people to the safe house. The other ones were deported, and \u2014 by\nfoot, and none of them came back. We would be among those who were deported,\nand who would have been, of course, the victims. This we found out later, after the\nwar. In the place where we now were in the factory, we had about 120 - 130 people.\nThey had a bunch of kids, young women and 1n a few days we found out that there\nwas a group of young people who were running around in Nazi uniforms, but they\nwere Jews. And they had a \u2014 a group of five or six people who went to the\ndeportation trains and to the roads, to snatch some people back. They had papers, wi\nNovember 13, 1997\n\u2014 which were forgeries, which said that such and such people would have to be\nbrought back to headquarters because they wanted to interrogate them. And this\nway they brought in more than 50 people back from the road, who were already to\ncertain death, mostly \u2014 mostly young women, and some young men, but mostly\nwomen. And so in the next week or so, the number of people went to about 170. We\nhad about 22 kids, some of them were younger than I, and it was a \u2014 a great\ncamaraderie. I mean, since \u2014 since the early spring that year, in 1944, I haven\u2019t been\nwith kids. And it was a lot of fun, and what was fun about it is that this \u2014 this\nfactory had a bunch of machines, big textile machines and we were av \u2014 able to\nexplore these, and a few of us were curious, particularly one fellow. His name was\nFoti(ph). Foti(ph) Yonchee(ph) and John Foti(ph). And he was my age, and he \u2014\nwe went on, and we played with these machines and it was just a lot of adventure.\nWe also found that there was a garage, or sort of a shed, which had a \u2014 a lot of hay.\nAnd the hay was important because attached to the factory, there was a horse, and a\n\u2014and a lorry. Horse and a lorry. And the hay was, of course, his food, horse\u2019s food.\nBut what we found out, which was very interesting and uk \u2014 unexpected 1s that one\nof the young men who was in this resistance told us that under the hay there was a\ncar, a personnel motorcar, which they use to rescue people.\nEnd of Tape Two, Side A\nNovember 13, 1997\nBeginning Tape Two, Side B",
        "A: Okay, so what we found out is that under the hay was this car, and they gave us\nthe permission to go into the car, and it was, of course, very exciting. This \u2014 this car\nwas an early Skoda, model 1930s. And at that time, in order to start the car, you\nhad a piece of \u2014 a steel rod you had to put in in the front and make it, you know,\nmove it around. But these people told us, and I am sure this was a fib, that in fact \u2014\nin fact that\u2019s thing was not a part of the starter, but it was a machine gun built into\nthe car, and that this would be used in case something happens here. And we\nbelieved that, it was a good \u2014 good fib, and it was certainly an interesting story.\nUnfortunately the reality was a little less interesting. What had happened is that on\nthe second of December, we heard a \u2014 a very powerful knock on the door, and there\nwere only f\u2014 a few seconds before we heard running steps. We \u2014 our \u2014 our rooms\nwere on the second floor, second story of this place. It was really camouflaged as\nwork rooms, but by the time we reached this number of people, there was not\nenough room to sleep on the floor, so they build these multiple \u2014 actually three story",
        "A: Bunks, I guess you can call them. And they brought the hay from downstairs and\nwe \u2014 we Slept on the hay and we used the army uniforms, we had several hundred of\nthose, as blankets and pillows, whatever. And we were in a middle bunk, and I\nremember the [indecipherable]",
        "A: No, I slept with my mother and my father. The families stayed together.\nUnderneath there was another family with a little girl I remember, her name was\nOnchee(ph). She was about two or three years old and she made a racket and she\nmade her grandpa \u2014 Papa, very, very mad all the time, and she knew how to push\nhis buttons. And it was hilarious, I mean, it was really funny. Very close by, there\nwas a young lady, young woman. Her name was Cotto(ph) Ferhier(ph). And she\nwas a \u2014 she was married, she was 22 years old, and we got very good friends. She \u2014\nshe was patient enough with me and I talked to her about my stories I read and all\nthese things, and I was 10 going on 30, and we really became very good friends and\nmy mother and father didn\u2019t mind that at all, because of course, they didn\u2019t have to\nbabysit me. And that was another friendship, but she was more interested in another\nfellow, who was a young man by the name of Bondi(ph). And Bondi(ph) was one\nof the \u2014 the refugees there, the \u2014 the one who was able to escape from deportation.\nNovember 13, 1997\nAnd Bondi(ph) one day, and this was the very end of November, I think the 30\",\ngot very, very sick. And he got high fever and he was delirious. And the committee\nwho ran this place had a real dilemma, they didn\u2019t know what to do. If they bring in\nsomebody from the outside, you know, they may jeopardize 129 \u2014 69 people, and if\nthey don\u2019t, they may have Bondi(ph) dead within a day or two. Well, they decided\nthe next day, when Bondi\u2019s(ph) condition became worse, that they were going to\nbring somebody in. And \u2014 and they brought a Christian doctor in late at night, and\nhe gave him sulfur drugs, it turned out that it was an infection. And in a day or so,\nhe got better. The date is very important, this was the first of December. In the\nmorning of the second, we heard the running steps, and as we were trying to\nscramble for some shelter, we saw five men running in with submachine guns and\nyelling and screaming us and saying that we know who you are, you are just a\nbunch of dirty Jews who are trying to \u2014 to hide here, and we are the police, the Nazi\nstate police. This was the gest \u2014 the Hungarian Gestapo. And they sorted out the\nmen to one side of the room, and women and children to the other and we thought\nthat this was the end. I mean, there was just no way. Within the few seconds of\nconfusion, one man, John dove out the window and into another building. It was\nlike six or seven feet, and he really jumped, and he crashed through a \u2014 a \u2014 a glass\ndoor \u2014 glass enclosure. And his luck was that it was a haystack underneath, so he\nNovember 13, 1997\ngot into the haystack. And they ran after him, they tried to push the haystack, they\ncouldn\u2019t find him. But we were captured, and we thought that this was going to be\nthe end. But for a while nothing happened, and about 20 or 30 minutes later, the\ndetectives, one of the leaders of the detectives came out of the office, and made the\nfollowing startling statement, that henceforth we are under their protection. And we\njust couldn\u2019t figure out what happened. There was only one arrest which they made,\nand that was a na\u2014 aman by the name of Kormus(ph). Kormus(ph) was the \u2014 the\nleader of the group. Not the commander, but the real leader, the organizer. I didn\u2019t\nknow much about Kormus(ph), but I found out later what \u2014 who he was. They took\nhim and they took us, oh, 10,000 dollars in cash, which by sheer luck was there,\nbecause there were a number of extremely rich people in hiding. So in other words,\nthey bribed these detectives. And they left with Kormus(ph) and the money, but\nthey left us behind. After the war I found out that they took Kormus(ph) and they \u2014\nthey tortured him for two days because they knew that this, our place, was not the\nonly one. In fact, it was a network of four places, all of which Kormus(ph) ran.\nThey knew of three, our place, and another two. And what happened is Kormus(ph)\nwas betrayed. We thought that the doctor did \u2014 betrayed us, it was not the doctor. It\nwas aman by name of Althurdi(ph), who hid Kormus(ph) and his family for\nmonths. And the speculation was that he was either blackmailed, or he didn\u2019t get\nNovember 13, 1997\nenough money, but he betrayed Kormus(ph). He knew of three places Kormus(ph)\ncould have been, and he knew of a fourth place, but he did not know the address of\nthe fourth place. So when he \u2014 when Kormus(ph) was betrayed, they raided three\nof the four places, Kormus(ph) happened to be in our place. But the fourth place\nthey didn\u2019t know. The fourth place was a factory in another part of Budapest with\n350 Jewish slave laborers who were essentially also hiding there. But they, the slave\nlaborers were armed, and they had a mission there. They were armed, and their\nmission was that they would save the utility companies of Budapest. The paper said\n\u2014 they were all in army uniforms \u2014 their paper said that they would be the last one to\nstay, to blow up these utilities, the gas \u2014 gas company, the \u2014 the wa \u2014 the\nwaterworks and so forth, and the electric company. That was the paper which said,\nbut the real mission was to, in fact, save these utilities. And every day they were\ntrained like soldiers. Every night on the other hand, they we \u2014 they had a little\nfactory underneath and they forged papers. And they worked with the Zionists and\nthey worked with our little group, and they were part of the Hungarian Jewish\nresistance, and Kormus(ph) was the head. So Kormus(ph) \u2014 they \u2014 they knew\nKormus(ph) knew about this and they tortured him. He did not speak, and because\nhe didn\u2019t show up for two days, they knew in the fourth place, that things were bad,\nso they left. They \u2014 they \u2014 they \u2014 they couldn\u2019t accomplish their mission, but they\nNovember 13, 1997\nwere all safe, they were able to escape. And then Kormus(ph) was sentenced to\ndeath, and they took him to the Danube, but he was able to escape. He was very\nsick because of the fact that he \u2014 they tortured him, but he escaped. He was able to\nhide, and he survived the war. The other two places which were raided, were not as\nlucky as we were. They had not many rich people there and they were deported.\nOne was deported on foot to \u2014 to Germany, and they all died. And the second part\nwas taken to political headquarters, and they \u2014 they were among the ones who were\nsentenced and 70 of them were taken to the Danube, and only Kormus(ph) was\nable to escape. The rest of them were shot into the Danube. So our group was\nessentially the \u2014 out of the three groups, our group was the only one who survived.\nAfter this happened, the committee who ran the building decided that the 22\nchildren were not safe, so they decided to take us from \u2014 ranging from age of six\nmonths to 11 years, I was among the oldest. And one lady who \u2014 who had the six\nmonths old son, I think, they took us to a\u2014 a Red Cross building which was in the\nmiddle of the city. We took the lorry and the soldier brought us to the Red Cross\nbuilding. And the idea was that this was a protected building, we would be fed there\nand we would be okay. That was the theory. The practice was that when we got\nthere, there were about three or 400 children, crying, hungry, dirty and maybe a half\na dozen adults. I didn\u2019t like the place at all.\nNovember 13, 1997",
        "A: By the Red Cross, Swiss Red Cross building, okay? They were the \u2014 they had\nabout 30 buildings throughout town, which were run by the Swiss Red Cross, like\nthe Swedish buildings, this \u2014 but this was not within that enclosure, you know.\nThere was a\u2014 what they called an international ghetto, where the Swiss, the\nSwedes, the [indecipherable] and the Spanish had rented buildings, about 32\nbuildings. This was 1n a part of town, and they were all concentrated. That\u2019s where\nmy grandmother and my grand-aunts and uncle were. The Red Cross buildings were\nthroughout the city, they were essentially Swiss protected. Not very well, as you\nwill hear in a minute. But at the time that I got there they were protected, and they\nwere concentrating children there. Now, the idea was that there were adults who\nwould supervise these children, they would bring hoo \u2014 food and everything. Well,\nthe \u2014 that was the theory. The practice was that the building was almost empty. I\nwas put in with a friend of mine, into a room where we had about 35 children of my\nage. No furniture, we were sleeping on the floor and we were told that there is no\nfood for the day. Well, I wandered around and I was crying, and I met a friend of\nmine from school there, who was there with his sister. I knew him, his name is\nMike Vairmas(ph). He now lives here in this country. And he was telling me that\nhe wa \u2014 he just came in a few days earlier and they are thinking about leaving the\nNovember 13, 1997\nbuilding, escaping, because they haven\u2019t gotten any food there since they came. So,\na young girl saw me there crying, and asked me why I was crying, and I was saying\nI was hungry and I was lonely for my mother. This young girl has a boyfre \u2014 had a\nboyfriend who was in a Nazi uniform, and who told me that he would be more than\nhappy to take me back. Well, I knew that that was not the right answer, and I knew\nthat I had to escape now, cause I knew that if this man would take a \u2014 take me back\nto where we are hiding, you know, he would betray us. So John Foti(ph) and I\ndecided that in the very next morning, we are going to take off. And the building\nwas locked from the inside, so we couldn\u2019t just walk out. And the next morning\nwhen the employees came, there was a kindly lady who came and we asked her to\ntake us out so that we could buy some food. And as she took us out, we ran away\nfrom her.",
        "A: It was a brave decision, but it \u2014 we had no choice, because if we went back, the\nNazi would recognize us, would take us to where my father and mother and the\nother people were hiding. I didn\u2019t want to take that chance. The chance was that\nthey would catch us somewhere, because they were looking for kids too, and of\ncourse we didn\u2019t wear our \u2014 our yellow star. That was the chance I had to take. It\ntook us a couple of hours to \u2014 to get back. We were sort of ducking various little\nNovember 13, 1997\ngroups of Nazis who were patrolling the streets. We bought a newspaper, which we\npretended to read. We took a number of streetcars to go, and we knew where \u2014\nwhere the place was, so we had to change like three times, and we got back there.\nMy mother couldn\u2019t believe that I did come back and we came back. We were the\nonly two kids who \u2014 who did come back. After the war I found out that about three\ndays later, the Nazis raided the building and they took the children to the Danube\nand they shot them. And my friend Mike and his sister escaped just a day or so\nearlier, but not the rest of them; the rest of them all died. So here we were, this was,\nI think maybe the 10\" of December. A few days after this, two policemen showed\nup in our building and told us that the detectives sent out \u2014 sent them to let us know\nthat we are under suspicion by some of the Nazis, who live in the area, and they are\nabout to report this suspicious building and people. And that they da \u2014 they\nsuggested that we should follow them, they would take us to the ghetto. The ghetto\nin Budapest was established at the very end of November. And the people who\nwere still in the \u2014 the yellow stone \u2014 yellow starred houses were taken to the \u2014 to the\nplaces. Now, many of the yellow starred houses were raided, and many of the\npeople already were deported, but in the middle of December, which is what \u2014 what\nwas, there were \u2014 Budapest was almost completely surrounded by Russian troops.\nAnd so the Nazis decided that they would concentrate the Jews who are left in\nNovember 13, 1997\nBudapest into a small ghetto in the middle of town, which was the \u2014 used to be the\nJewish quarters. And then they would do something. And so, on the 14\" of\nDecember, the ghetto was already established and these policemen told us that they\nwould go ahead, we would be behind them, they would not look back, and nothing\nelse was said. Well, of the 150 people roughly, only 65 arrived in the ghetto. The\nrest sort of evaporated along the way. My father decided that we have nowhere to\nhide, so we went back to the ghetto. The ghetto, as I mentioned, was in a very poor\nsection of town, the Jewish quarters. The center of it was a square, Klauzal square,\nand in that square, or one part of the square was a market. They took us to the\nmarket, where the Nazis \u2014 a number of Nazis were there, Hungarian Nazis, told us\nthat, if you have any jewelry, money, they are going to do a body search, and if they\nfind anything, they\u2019Il shoot us. There was a dead body to sh \u2014 to prove the point.\nAnd we didn\u2019t have anything, but a couple of people did, and they would throw the\n\u2014 the jewelry into the sewer rather than giving it to these people. Of the 63 of us\nwho got there, we were separated into several groups. The group which my father\nand I \u2014 my mother and I stayed with were about 20 people. We were just taken to\nthe other side of the square, is Klauzal square seven, a three story old building.\nTurned out that this building housed a \u2014 the remnants of a old age home, old age\nJewish home, brought in, and the first two stories \u2014 floors, were quite chock full of\nNovember 13, 1997\npeople, but the third story was empty. So they gave us two rooms there, and it was\ndirty and no food. And I remember that after \u2014 the day after we arrived, my father,\nwho was always enterprising, he was looking around and he found a piece of bread,\nwhich must have been six months old. And bugs were jumping all over the place\nout of it, but he said, that\u2019s okay, because we\u2019ll toast it and then we can eat it.\nThat\u2019s precisely what we did, somehow we toasted it, bugs all got fried and then we\nate a piece of it. That was the food for that particular day. People were not very\nchoosy at that point. My father also went around to see what \u2014 what was the\nsituation in the ghetto. The ghetto was \u2014 th-the area originally was an area for about\n12,000 people. By the time we got there, they had about 40,000 people living there,\nand at its peak they had 70,000 people. So you can imagine that there were not \u2014\nthere was not much room around.",
        "A: Absolutely yeah. I didn\u2019t feel like a kid at all. I mean, all these things age \u2014 age\npeople pretty rapidly, and \u2014 and I remember that, you know, walking around with\nmy mother on the \u2014 on the streets and seeing people in \u2014 in terrible physical and\nmental condition, and dirty and broken down, and it was \u2014 it was very depressive.\nNovember 13, 1997",
        "A: It was still a parent-child relationship, essentially, yes. And my father was not a\npart of \u2014 you know, he was a take charge person, he was not a person who would \u2014\nwho would break down. In \u2014 in fact, you know, he was my hero, because he was\nvery brave man, as you will hear what happened there. What he did is he looked\naround for possibilities, and one possibility was to join the ghetto police. Now, the\nghetto police in Budapest was a very different from the ghetto police in Warsaw or\nLodz or any of these other places. This is now the middle of December in 1944.\nThe Russians are completely surrounding this place. The ghetto police\u2019s mission 1s\ndifferent. The ghetto police\u2019s mission, ridiculous as it may sound, was a defensive\nmission. They\u2019re supposed to persuade or \u2014 or \u2014 or fight off the Nazis coming into\nthe ghetto. And the means for that was a nightstick and a \u2014 and a Swiss beret and a\n\u2014 a armband, a white armband which says ghetto police in three different languages;\nHungarian, German and Russian [indecipherable] languages. And he had an I.D.\ncard saying he was ghetto police. Well, one of his lucky strokes was that he found,\nin the basement of the building where we stayed, a hardhat. These \u2014 you know,\nwhat \u2014 what the \u2014\nNovember 13, 1997",
        "A: Construction workers wear. Actually, the firefighters. And he always wo-wore\nthat. That saved his life more than once. And the reason why he want to \u2014 or wanted\nto join the ghetto police force was that the ghetto police had double rations, and he\nwanted to bring the ration home. The policeman\u2019s life were very difficult. They\nwere on patrol 12 - 14 hours a day. And as I said, their mission was \u2014 their main\nmission was to try to fight off the Nazis. Well, you don\u2019t fight off people with\nmachine guns when they come in, and of course, they couldn\u2019t. Many of them died\nbecause of that. They tried to be polite to the Nazis, who simply let a\u2014a slug of \u2014a\nslug into them. There \u2014 a few days after we moved in, at night, we heard this\ntremendous noise and a huge crash. We found out that the shell, an artillery shell\nwas shot into the ghetto. We don\u2019t know who shot it, but it landed in the next room\nfrom where we were, and the people who were there, died. And it was a wall away\nfrom where we were, where my father, mother and I were. I got hysterical and I\nsaid, I\u2019m not staying up here, and my mother and I and Cotto(ph), who was with us,\nthe \u2014 the young lady who we met in Chango(ph), the three of us moved down to the\nbasement. The basement was very deep. It used to be the shop of wood maker and it\nwas covered with wood saw, and we just slept there. They had a couple of\nworkbenches there and I never moved out of that place after that happened. I never\nNovember 13, 1997\nneeded to move out because in about two days, the \u2014 which was Christmas day, the\nsiege of Budapest began, and everybody moved on. The food supply was\ncatastrophic. We had people who were old \u2014 and I mean old \u2014 battle hardened\nHungarian Jewish slave laborers, the remnants of the people who were taken out in\n1941. About a half a dozen of them ended up in our building. A number of them\nwere very religious Jews, and they were Hassids and they were praying all day long.\nA number of them were not too religious, but none of them were willing to risk\ntheir lives at that point to bring food. There were food available about a block or a\nblock and a half from where we lived, but somebody had to go there and get it. My\nfather always volunteered, but he was not enough just by himself, and a few people\nwent and some got hurt. And so our food supply, because of this, was very\nprecarious. People knew that the war couldn\u2019t la \u2014 end up \u2014 I mean, how long could\nyou live like this? There was no water, there was no electricity, gas, nothing. What\nwe had was about 200 people in a small basement, which had no electricity, with a\ncouple of slit windows eight feet high or nine feet high, and a couple of cans of\nfloor wax. I remember that I contributed one of my shoelaces as wicks and we put \u2014\nput it in the can and that was the \u2014 the light which 200 people had. My father \u2014 I\nhaven\u2019t s \u2014 you know, I \u2014 after the siege begun, my father was mostly out, he \u2014 he\ndidn\u2019t come home very often. One time I remember when he came in, he came in\nNovember 13, 1997\nonly for \u2014 for a few minutes. He came in with the good news that he found his own\nparents in the ghetto, and his parents were in reasonably good shape.",
        "A: Well, the sanitary conditions were \u2014 were horrible. What they had to do was to\ndig a \u2014 a latrine in the middle of the room. And they had some old bed sheets, and\nthey got a couple of pieces of wood and you know, you sort of leaned against it\nwhen you had to do your thing. But the stench was unbearable. And then, because\nwe were very close together, people started to have lice, and because we were close\nproximity, everybody got it. And the way we \u2014 we lived there, we \u2014 we raided the\nbil \u2014 the upper part of the building and got the \u2014 the doors out and put the doors\ndown and the people essentially slept on the doors. We still had my father\u2019s\novercoat, who would have really needed it in his forays in \u2014 outside, but he didn\u2019t\nhave it because we were using it.",
        "A: We didn\u2019t, we couldn\u2019t. There was some little water, but 1t was negligible, and\nmost people just gave up on it. And you know, for the last two weeks, two or three\nweeks, it was just nominal washing. Some people tried to do it. Interestingly\nenough, the \u2014 the more well educated were the ones who sort of gave up; the least\nwell educated ones, who tried to keep their \u2014 their cleanliness. And it was a \u2014 1t was\nNovember 13, 1997\nan interesting Darwinian selection. One of the things which happened is that old\npeople died. They starved to death and we found them in the morning. And 1n a lull\nof fighting, a few men volunteered to bring them out of the building, and threw\nthem on a pile of dead bodies which were piling up in the middle of the square. I\nwent \u2014",
        "A: No, it wasn\u2019t easier. I think it \u2014 it \u2014 it \u2014 1t never was \u2014 was easier for me. I \u2014 I\nknew that those people were alive a day before, and I knew them, I spoke to them,\nsome of them. I could never take this for granted. And I remember once when I \u2014\nwhen the lull in the fighting sort of persisted for an hour, I came out and I looked\nout and I saw this \u2014 this hill of bodies. And I knew that if something will not happen\nvery soon, we would all e-end up there. I did not \u2014 did not think that any one of us\nwould survive. And then January came, and we were all lethargic, we were sort of\nsitting there, weak. And tha \u2014 at that point there was very few who had any spark\nleft. And on the fourth of January, a group of about 30 or 35 young ladies, young\nwomen were brought in. Turned out that they were from Wallenberg\u2019s houses.\nWallenberg was very concerned that he could not really protect people any more at\nNovember 13, 1997\nthat point, and he decided that many of the people who were still alive there \u2014 his\nhouses were raided by the Nazis \u2014 he decided \u2014",
        "A: Very little. This was the first time that I heard of his name, from these people\nwho came from his house. I-I \u2014 most of the things which I knew about him, I\nlearned after the World War. I knew that Raoul Wallenberg was trying to save\npeople, and it wasn\u2019t just Wallenberg incidentally, but other people in\norganizations. We knew about the Swedes, we knew about the Swiss. We had, for\nexample what they call schutz passes, safe passages. The \u2014 they had forgeries by\nthe hundreds of thousands. Everybody had a couple of them in the pockets. We\ndidn\u2019t know whether they were real or forged. At that point, sometimes it helped,\nsometimes it didn\u2019t.",
        "A: Yeah, we had \u2014 we had schutz passes. My mother had them, I had, my father\nhad.",
        "A: I\u2014I guess at that point, they were given. They were given away by Jewish\norganizations. I sa\u2014 I\u2019m sad to say that some of the \u2014 the Jews did not give them\nNovember 13, 1997\naway for nothing, they \u2014 they made money on it. We were \u2014 we didn\u2019t have very\nmuch money, we never had Swedish passports, which was expensive. So we had the\nSwiss, which was cheap, or nothing. But it wasn\u2019t \u2014 it really didn\u2019t matter most of\nthe time. I mean, most of the Nazis really didn\u2019t look at the paper, they \u2014 they threw\naway. But sometimes you never knew whether it had or not. So \u2014 for some people it\nhad sometimes.",
        "A: We never had to show ours. We had it in our pocket, but we never had to show\nours.",
        "A: No. As I mentioned to you, our \u2014 our \u2014 our story was that my f\u2014 my mother and\nI stayed in the \u2014 in the re \u2014 in the yellow star house until we went into hiding. And\nthe only people who went into the safe houses were my grandparents \u2014 my \u2014 my\ngrandmother actually, and my grandmother\u2019s sisters who, through the good offices\nof Raoul Wallenberg were able to \u2014",
        "A: No, they did not, no. Not that I know of. Remember, there was very little\ncommunication between people at this point, there were no telephones. Each house,\neach yellow star house was sort of an island. We did not know what happened to\nNovember 13, 1997\nfair \u2014 friends, relatives, anybody. And we did not know what was going on in the\noutside world. So at this point, this was the first time we knew about, or I f-found\nout about safe houses. I found out that these safe houses were no longer safe, and\nthese people were brought in. They were better fed than we were, but they were\nvery frightened. And we squeezed them in as everybody \u2014 at that point it was not\nthat much of a squeeze because most of the older people died already. So this was\nthe case. Tenth of January rolled around, and we were even weaker. A young SS\nsoldier came down. He was surveying the building. He told us that the whole ghetto\nis mined, that we will not survive, and just forget it. They will not allow the Jews to\nsurvive. The Russians were very close, but before the Russians would get there,\nthey would blow them up \u2014 blow the ghetto up. Turns out that \u2014 that the real plan\nwas even more sinister. I do not know whether the \u2014 this \u2014 this was really a fake\nStory or not.\nEnd of Tape Two, Side B\nNovember 13, 1997\nBeginning Tape Three, Side A",
        "A: The \u2014 the real plan was more sinister than the one which the soldier disclosed to\nus, namely that they would blow up the ghetto. The real plan was to massacre us on\n\u2014 for the 16\" of January, there was a massacre in plan, 500 SS, a couple of hundred\nHungarian police. The number of Hungarian Nazis would come in with submachine\nguns, and would line us up essentially, and \u2014 and mow us down. It turned \u2014 turned\nout that fortunately, Wallenberg found out about it on the 15\", and he sent a\nmessage to the SS general. His name was Schmidhuber, that if this happens, he\nwould personally guarantee that Schmidhuber would be hung. Apparently\nSchmidhuber was a middle-aged man and he was now concerned about his own\nwelfare. And he called \u2014 called this action off. That obviously saved the people, my\nlife, my father\u2019s, mother\u2019s, my relatives and the 7,000 people who were still alive in\nthe ghetto. This was on the 15\" - 16\". There was one little girl in our building, her\nname was Alice. She was about eight years old, and she was a weak little kid. She\nwas not very alive. She had a mother, and a grandmother. The mother was diabetic,\nand the grandmother was also. And she came sometimes to play with me, but I\ndidn\u2019t like her that much. This day, on the 17\", she came not just to my mother, but\nNovember 13, 1997\nto everybody to beg for some food for her mother, who \u2014 who was in a diabetic\nshock. We had very little, namely and specifically, we had about a quarter of a\npound of sugar. As I mentioned earlier, when we left our house, our home, the\nJewish re \u2014 yellow star home to go into hiding, my mother took very little food with\nus. This food was shepherded along since November, now it\u2019s January. The la \u2014 the\n\u2014 the \u2014 a month of food which is left in that little bag 1s fa \u2014 is a half a pound of\nsugar. My mother kept it for me because she felt that maybe a few sugar cubes\nwould save my life if \u2014 if it all comes down to that. So my mother refused to give\nAlice any food. This was the 17\". On the 18\" of January in the morning \u2014 on the\nevening of the 17, my father came home and he decided to stay home. On the 18\"\nthere was a strange quiet. We didn\u2019t know what happened. It wasn\u2019t as quiet for \u2014\nfor weeks. I mean, this was a 24 hour a day artillery duel and bombing raid and we\ndidn\u2019t know how much was left over of that city. And all of a sudden it was \u2014 was\nstrange. So somebody climbed up to that slit window, about nine feet about the \u2014\nthe floor of the basement and saw some strange boots. They were not Nazi boots,\nthey were Russian boots, and we were liberated. There was no elation. We vid \u2014 we\nreally even didn\u2019t say anything to each other. It was fear that the Nazis would come\nback. Was indecision what to do next. The one thing we found out is that Alice\u2019s\nmother and grandmother were both dead, and my mother felt terribly guilty for the\nNovember 13, 1997\nnext 47 years of her life. Nobody could tell her that she was saving the food to her\nson, that was a choice between somebody whom she didn\u2019t know, and her own son,\nand there was really no choice in the matter. She felt still guilty til the day \u2014 day of\nher death. I remember that some of the younger people evaporated first. They didn\u2019t\nask, they didn\u2019t say anything. We didn\u2019t know what happened to the people whom\nwe knew. My father and mother decided that, around noontime, that it\u2019s time for us\nto leave. Both my mother and father were so weak that the little suitcase which we\nhad, which contained a half a pound of sugar and the family\u2019s pictures, they\ncouldn\u2019t carry. I was the one who carried them, I was the \u2014 the strongest one. My\nfather, who was 43 years old, looked like 70. And in his two or three weeks of\npatrol, he lost three of his partners, and he was more dead than alive. And then he \u2014\nwe Started to walk out of the ghetto, that was not \u2014 not an easy walk. There were\nvery few walkways there, half of the buildings were on the street. We heard the\nshrapnel zipping and making this awful noise above our heads. The artillery fire\nwas going on, the \u2014 the siege of Budapest was still going on. It took us three hours\nto get home, and we decided, like homing pigeons, to go back to our home from\nwhich we were thrown out by the Nazis in June of 1944. We went back, it took us\nthree hours, two and a half miles. We saw, in that journey, many dead bodies, many\ndead horses, and one live Russian. Which was almost ludicrous because this man\nNovember 13, 1997\nwas singing. He was singing, he wa \u2014 must have been drunk, but he \u2014 he had a\nhappy face, he was smiling and singing. And we looked at him as if he were crazy,\ninstead of the world. Maybe he was the ones \u2014 the only sane people in that \u2014 person\nin that whole \u2014 whole mad, maddening scene. And as we were walking, these\nshrapnels were hitting buildings, and whole walls came down, tumbling in front of\nus. I mean, we were in mortal danger, we \u2014 we were crazy to walk there, but we did.\nAnd we walked through the city park, and we were held up by a small group of\nRussians, who wanted us to, for all other things, break up the ice on the sidewalk. I\nmean, breaking up the ice, and he gave us these ice picks to do it. My father\ncouldn\u2019t lift it, you know, and he finally said well, forget it, and they gave us a loaf\nof bread. That was the first loaf of bread we have seen for more than a month. It\nwas \u2014 was a square loaf of bread, I remember. And they just let us go. And we\nstumbled home, and it was maybe four, five in the afternoon by the time we got\nthere. And the man whom we met first was Mr. Dudek(ph). Mr. Dudek(ph) was the\nman who was giving my father the paper under which he was able to work for\nyears, and who also hid a large suitcase full of food, which we left with him in June,\nand which he gave back to us. I remember the suitcase was a green suitcase, 1t was a\ncanvas, but it was full of canned food. He didn\u2019t take any. But the rest of the people\nwho lived there were rather frightened. They looked at us as if we were ghosts. Not\nNovember 13, 1997\njust because of our physical appearance, but because of their bad conscious. Here\nthese Jews came back. Now what will happen? There were \u2014 we knew about those\nextreme Nazis, Mr. Drexler(ph), who was \u2014 who was boasting about his adventures\nwith the Hassidic Jews whose \u2014 whose beard he cut off and whose stomach he filled\nwith \u2014 with pork. And some others, who were no less guilty. They thought they will\n\u2014 that we were going to denounce them to the Russians. We were too tired, too sick\nto \u2014 too nothing to \u2014 to do anything. The miracle which happened to us was that a\nfew hours later my \u2014 my maternal grandmother came home. Turned out that she\nwas in the ghetto. And revenge was the furthest from our minds. My grandmother\nwas born in what is now Slovakia, so she spoke the language. Russian troops came\ndown, everybody was frightened of them. We found out that they came a few days\nearlier, raped a few women. But my grandmother spoke their language and they\nwere very, very friendly. And I remember that Mr. Dudek(ph) made room for us,\nand on the evening of the 18\" of January, we s \u2014 we went to sleep in another\nbasement, in another part of town, and the siege of Budapest was still on. In fact, it\nwas still on for more than a month, because Buda was still defended by the Nazis\nfor a month after Pest was liberated. The life came back slowly. The first thing we\ntried to do is to get some food somewhere. My father found a rucksack somewhere\nand went out and scrounged for frozen potatoes, whatever. We had this suitcase full\nNovember 13, 1997\nof food, which helped a great deal for the next few weeks. But of course it doesn\u2019t \u2014\nyou know, I mean, we were \u2014 my father was like 90 pounds, my mother was like\nthat too and my grandmother too, and so we really needed to eat something. There\nwas very little food. There were no utilities. Water came about because we were the\nfru \u2014 we had the ice, you know, in the \u2014 in the yard and we cut it up and boiled it \u2014\nboiled it with water, or whatever.",
        "A: My physical condition was the best of the three of us, cause if there was food, I\nate it. | was weak, but maybe not as weak as my mother and father. And I probably\nbounced back in a couple of weeks. We lived in the basement there, and we were\ntrying to find some other arrangements. As the end of February rolled around and\nBuda was liberated, people were free to move back up. Our old apartment was\noccupied; they gave it to another family. But the apartment next door, which was\nthe apartment of the Surka\u2019s(ph), the man who was a professional soldier and\nwhose two daughters I used to play with, they went to the west, they left, and their\napartment was empty. So Mr. Dudek(ph), the super, suggested that we would go\nand occupy that place. At that point it was like catcher\u2019s catch can. A number of\napartments were also burned out by shells. That particular apartment was in fairly\ngood shape, so we went up and we occupied it. Many months later, the Surkas\nNovember 13, 1997\ncame back. There was a law by that time that if somebody occupied an apartment\nfor more than a certain number of months, they were the owners of it. So the\nSurkas(ph) couldn\u2019t have a claim. They were a sad lot when they came back and I\nfelt very sorry. The yo \u2014 the older daughter died. They went to the west. The father\nwas a Soldier, they got liberated and they came back, and then they disappeared. I\ndon\u2019t know whether they left Hungary or not, but at that time \u2014 this was in May or\nJune of 1945, and that was the last time I saw them. Our next door neighbors who\nlived in number five, they stayed and \u2014 and most of the neighbors who \u2014 who \u2014\nwhom we knew before the war, stayed there. There were some new neighbors, some\npeople left, but all in all, we had about 20 apartments in this apartment house, about\n15 of them were familiar faces. So what happened next? In March, the schools\nopened, and my mother and father and I decided that I\u2019m going to go to the Jewish\nhigh school. It opened in the \u2014 what used to be the rabbinic seminary, the old\nbuilding which was in Aboni(ph) Street was not given back at that point. And\npeople somehow, and I don\u2019t know how, they got the news that it \u2014 school\u2019s garin \u2014\ngoing to be open, life is going to start again. In the beginning, in March, there were\nno streetcars, so it was like an hour and a half walk each way. My mother \u2014\nNovember 13, 1997",
        "A: In Pest. In the middle of Pest. We lived in Zuglo, which is sort of outside. Say\nwas about a good three miles, three and a half miles from where the school was. So\nevery morning we got up fairly early, and my mother and I \u2014 my mother took my\nhand and we walked to the school. And every \u2014 and then she waited for me in front,\nand then when it \u2014 school was ended, she took me back, we had the same walk. And\nmy mother became such a familiar face that the \u2014 the teachers all knew her and they\ninvited her and then sort of she said \u2014 there were some mothers, not all of them\nwere like that. But some of the mothers whose sons were all \u2014 whose \u2014 this was a\nJewish gymnasium for boys, boys\u2019 gymnasium. We had a girls\u2019 gymnasium also,\nbut this was the boys\u2019 gymnasium. And so we started out fairly large, we had about\n72 students in my class, two [indecipherable] classes. I was happy to see some\nfriendly fa \u2014 and \u2014 faces from the elementary school. But we found out, very sadly,\nthat the \u2014 the orphans did not survive. What happened to the orphans, one day they\n\u2014 they raided this orphanage and took out those orphans who were my classmates,\n10 of them, with the teacher and took them to the Danube and they shot them. So\nthey didn\u2019t \u2014 they didn\u2019t survive. But many of our classmates who were in\nelementary school did, and \u2014 and we saw them \u2014 I saw them in the gymnasium. It\nwas very primitive in the beginning, we didn\u2019t have anything, it was just an empty\nschool building. And the educ \u2014 and th \u2014 and many of the teachers didn\u2019t come back\nNovember 13, 1997\nfrom deportation, or from school yet. They sort of trickled back throughout that \u2014\nfrom March to June. That was a very truncated year. It was supposed to start, of\ncourse, 1n September of \u201944, end in June of \u201945. Well, it never started, but it ended\nin June of \u00b045 anyway. And by then, the streetcars started to run, and by then life\nstarted to trickle back. We got a telegram in early June, I believe, from America,\nfrom the United States, from my uncle, the one who wanted to adopt me, telling us\nthat they found us through the Red Cross somehow, and that they\u2019ll happy that we\nare survive \u2014 that we survived, and th-that he and his wife had a son who was born\nin 1944, and they are fine and happy and we should write to them, and we did. And\nwe started corresponding and this \u2014 they sen \u2014 they said they would send us papers.\nBut my father decided against it. He felt that Hungary is going to be a good\ncountry now. And indeed, after the war there were some possibilities. My father\nrestarted his business. It looked like there was going to be a democracy. People\nwere \u2014 were having some hope. Many of the surviving Jews decided to join the\ncommunist party, my father and mother joined the social democrats. And some of\nthe people were out for revenge. Many of them decided to join the political police\nand they were after the Nazis. Kormus(ph), for example survived, became a head\nof a people\u2019s court, and as such, his mission was to put away as many Nazis as\npossible. And he accomplished it. My father was not that kind, and my mother was\nNovember 13, 1997\nneither, and we sort of tried to reconstruct whatever we could. We looked around\nthe neighborhood, we found that some of our furniture was not do \u2014 too far from\nwhere it originated from, and we got it back from the neighbors. And we just tried\nto rebuild our lives, somehow.",
        "A: Ina sense, yes. I think it took me a long time to really feel liberated. Probably\n1946. I remember 1945, and I remember the first of May of 1945, which was a huge\ndemonstration by the social democrats and the communists. And I remember the\nstruggle, the political struggles.",
        "A: May Day celebration and the political struggles for power. I now also knew that\nmost of the communist leaders who came back from Moscow were Jewish. Rocco\nShagerra(ph), Farkosh(ph). And most of the Jews were not unsympathetic. Some\nof them were. Obviously the \u2014 the ones who were rich before, saw that the\ncommunists are not going to retain them as \u2014 as capitalists again. But my family\nwas never really rich. My father was a \u2014 an engineer, he figured he would be able to\ndo business, he would be able to find a job, and we were not very worried. In fact,\nin 1945, Dudek(ph) \u2014 my father was able to reward Dudek(ph) and Dudek(ph) not\nNovember 13, 1997\nonly saved some of our food, but he also saved some of my father\u2019s material, you\nknow, ma \u2014 business, and so my father gave him half of it, and they started out a\nbusiness, a little business right in the building. Dudek(ph) was not a good\nbusinessman, so he \u2014 he didn\u2019t do very well, but my father was, and \u2014 and he started\nto deal with the same people he dealt with du \u2014 before the war. And it was a good\ntime. I mean, inflation was there for sure, but there were possibilities. And these\npossibilities ended in 1947. What were the possibilities? Well, one was, you know,\nwe were Jewish and the Joint from the United States had sent food and things,\nclothing. I remember in 19 \u2014 I believe it was the summer of \u201946, and I went to a\ncamp which was run by the Joint and Zionists. And I was not a Zionist myself. We\nhad a lot of Zionists in our \u2014 in our school, and many of the teachers were Zionists,\nand they had socialist Zionists, such as the Hashomer Hatzair, and then they had\nOrthodox. And one of the things which bothered me is that there was some\nanimosity and definite animosity between both the teachers and the students who\nwere of various persuasions. I remember a particular teacher who didn\u2019t like\nOrthodox Jews and who hit them, hit their heads, to hit their hats off and \u2014 and\nthings like that, and I could never understand it. After \u00b044, how could a Jew hit\nanother Jew because the Jew wears a hat? And there were some very passionate\ndiscussions about, you know, Hashomer Hatzair and Irgun and all these others.\nNovember 13, 1997\nAnd Betar and \u2014 and whoever else. And some people who were orphans \u2014 many of\nmy students \u2014 fellow students were orphans, moved into these Zionist camps, these\nlittle \u2014 they had houses. And they lived like \u2014 like \u2014 they were told that they were\nlike adults, I mean, 13 - 14 year old kids, they were adults, they could do anything\nthey wanted to. And I was fortunate enough to have my parents, and in a sense I\nwas a little bit jealous that they could do anything and I wasn\u2019t. I was still a son, and\nI was still a child. And despite \u201944, you know, I \u2014 in a sense I reverted back to\nchildhood. I couldn\u2019t accompli \u2014 completely in a hundred percent, but \u2014 but largely,\nand I was expected to. And I was expected to forget about all those things. And it\nbeen \u2014 and it had been bothering me for a long time, you know, what do you\nremember, how could you remember, you were too young. And the authenticity of\nthese remembrances were always questioned, not by me, but by others. But life\nwent on and we were told, you know, that we shouldn\u2019t dwell on the Holocaust, we\nshouldn\u2019t dwell on this. We shouldn\u2019t \u2014",
        "A: My parents told me, but mostly other people, and the \u2014 and th \u2014 and the\nnewspapers, and the \u2014 an-and the school, you know, now you have to learn, now\nyou are back to school. Now you worry about your homework, now you worry\nNovember 13, 1997\nabout your exams. Now you do things. You know, we joined first the Boy Scouts,\nand then when the Boy Scouts were disbanded, the Young Pioneers. And there was\nalways something to do. There was some excitement too, I mean, how did we \u2014 how\ndid we build \u2014 rebuild our lives? What do we \u2014 what did we do? How did we do it?\nAnd as I mentioned, I was taken to one of these camps, Zionist camps, I was \u2014 we\nhad four languages in the same time, and I was never a good linguistic expert. We\nhad Hebrew, Latin, English, and for a while German, but then that was dropped.\nBut three languages were more than enough for me, and I was not very good in\neither of those. And the only way I could not flunk Hebrew is that the \u2014 I promised\nmy Hebrew teacher that I was going to go to a Zionist camp. And they took me and\nI was unhappy and I s \u2014 I escaped. I escaped after about a week. Went home, my\nfather was very upset with me. He felt that I was just a coward, that I just couldn\u2019t\ndo it. I disagreed with him. But these things were not for me, I was \u2014 I was too\nmuch of a mother\u2019s boy still, and I was still with my mother. I was only 12 years\nold, I mean, it\u2019s not that I was \u2014 and this camp was not exactly what you would call\na camp here, it was hard. And we didn\u2019t get that much food, and the food was\nmostly split pea soup, which reminded me of the ghetto, which was the only food\nthere. But I had friends, and I started to \u2014 to form relationships. But I didn\u2019t have\ntoo many friends of my own age. The building we le \u2014 lived in had a \u2014 a number of\nNovember 13, 1997\nyoung girls who were older than I was. I was always attracted to young girls, and I\nwas \u2014 these young girls were 16 - 17 - 18. And I was more mature than my age and\nI started to have \u2014 sort of strike up conversations with them. And I thought that I\nwas enough of an intellectual challenge to \u2014 to talk to, to be talked to. And our next\ndoor neighbor was a \u2014 her name was Miriam. She was not Jewish, she was 16 and\nshe was telling me about the facts of life, and there was another girl downstairs who\nwas \u2014 she was \u2014 her \u2014 her name was Maurika(ph) and she was 18 and she was a\nvery studious girl and we had nice, interesting conversation about \u2014 conversations\nabout literature and art and music and things like that. Of course, they all had their\nboyfriends, but I sort of fancied myself as being somehow a sutroga \u2014 surrogate\nboyfriend and \u2014 and was there. And so my \u2014 my \u2014 my life, my social life sort of\nstarted to evolve among these people, my neighbors. And many of my friends, too.\nAnd then I got involved in the Young Pioneers, and some other various\norganizations. There was one organization, Young Workers. They were usually\nthree, four years older than I was, and they were not Jewish. And once I got into a \u2014\na real fight with them, and they told me that I was just a dirty little Jew, and they\nchased me out and chased me to \u2014 through the streets. And I \u2014 sort of 1t occurred to\nme that, my God, you know, these people are the same. They are not \u2014 they are not\ndifferent any more. They are just the same. They are still calling me dirty Jew two\nNovember 13, 1997\nyears after the war, and they are still chasing me down the street. And then I had\nsome doubts whether it was a good idea to stay in \u2014 in Hungary. But these doubts\nwere not, at this point were not very bad and very pronounced. This was 1947. We\nhad a\u2014 an election and the communists came in distant fourth. We still had a\ndemocratic government.",
        "A: [had a Bar Mitzvah. My Bar Mitzvah was an interesting one. It \u2014 in Budapest\nthere were two orphanages, a girl orphanage and a boy orphanage. The girl or-\norphanage was very close to where we lived, so \u2014 and they had, of course, a shul.\nAnd Rabbi Schwartz was the rabbi there, and he instructed me. In 1947, I had the\nBar Mitzvah there. And my mother decided that I would have a Bar Mitzvah lunch,\nand well, what can you do with a lu \u2014 for a lunch, you know? I invited the following\npeople; there were a couple of communist kids in school, they were about three\nyears older than I was, but they were friends. And there was a fellow who was a\nfriend of mine who was sort of a literary guy. And then a few friends,\ncontemporaries. And I borrowed two girls from the orphanage, they came also. And\nwe had a very nice lunch, and the adults were in the other room. That was my Bar\nMitzvah. And I remember, I got a book, which I still have. It\u2019s in Hungarian, of\ncourse. It\u2019s about Jewish Middle Ages. It\u2019s about Spain, the Spanish Jewish Middle\nNovember 13, 1997\nAges. And it was by Roth, Sir ce \u2014 Sir Cecile Roth, famous historian. I didn\u2019t read\nthe book, 1t was way above my head at that time, but for some reason or another, I \u2014\nI got it\u2014 my mother got it out of Hungary, and I found it many years later and I\nread it with much interest, and I still have it. My Bar Mitzvah present. And then a\nstupid thing happened. A friend of mine was tackling me in school, right after my\nBar Mitzvah and pushing me back and my shin broke. And so, I missed about two\nweeks or three weeks of class. I was in a cast for six weeks. And after the cast my\nfather and mother decided that I should go to a camp, a real camp. And they send\nme to this camp, which was run by Jews. Was run by a Olympic \u2014 Jewish Olympic\nwrestling champion by the name of Karpathi(ph), and it was called a Karpathi(ph)\ncamp, it was a sports camp. And most of the kids were Jewish and I had a great time\nthere. And it was three weeks. I didn\u2019t escape there \u2014 from there. I learned how to\nbike again, because for some reason I forgot, and how to swim and how to do all\nthose things; how to dance. There was a girl there who was 18 years old and who\nwas really the owner. Karpathi(ph) was sort of the manager. Kerienyi(ph), who\nwas another wrestler, was the owner. And Judith was her \u2014 his daughter, and she\nwas up there, sort of helping out with the kids. And I got very, very friendly with\nher, and we talked, and she was engaged to another wrestler, to be married. And she\nfigures in my later life, that\u2019s why I\u2019m telling you this. Anyway, Judith and I\nNovember 13, 1997\nbecame friends and even after the camp I saw her many times and then we lost in\ntouch maybe a half a year or so later. Five years passed by, and I met her again.\nAnd I\u2019m going to cut this story, because there will be some significance at that\npoint. But now we are still in 1947 \u2014 1947 and 1948. I had a happy education,\nparticularly in one particular subject, which was history. My homeroom teacher and\nmy history teacher was one and the same, he was a young ma-man named Paul\nPoch(ph). He turned out to be one of the great historians of Hungary, and he was\nvery young man and he \u2014 one of his claim to fame was that he was also the director\nof the statistical survey run by the Joint, of the [indecipherable] remnants. And you\nfind a copy of the book in our library. What they did is 400 people, in 1945, in\nAugust of \u201945, went through every building of Budapest and found the\n[indecipherable] remnants of \u2014 of Jews in Budapest. Found 68,000 of them. There\nwere \u2014 there were probably more, but many of them did not want to be registered.\nMy family and I were \u2014 my family\u2019s name and my name were \u2014 are in the book.\nPoch(ph) was the one who did it. Besides that, he was a brilliant teacher and he was\nmy homeroom teacher for four years, and I wanted to be a historian. Poch(ph) left\nthe school because he became a professor, a full professor at age 28 in the\nUniversity of Budapest in the \u2014 the economic university of Budapest. A few years\nlater he became the \u2014 the dean, and a few years after that he became director. Then\nNovember 13, 1997\nhe became a absolute world class historian. The one thing which he did however, is\nthat he completely changed his point of view, he became a Marxist economic\nhistorian. And he wa \u2014 he became one of their authority. And \u2014 but he was a\nhumane person, and one of the interesting part was that one of the classes he taught\nin the Jewish high school, who graduated in 1948 - \u201949, of that class, three men\nwent to his \u2014 his faculty. They became very famous historians. One of them became\nthe president of the Academy of Sciences, his name is Ivan Berendt. He came to\nthis country, he\u2019s now a professor of history in UCLA, and Poch(ph) helped him\nand helped others. Helped one man by the name of Rankey(ph), who became a \u2014 a\n\u2014 an authority on Hungarian Holocaust.\nEnd of Tape Three, Side A\nBeginning Tape Three, Side B",
        "A: I was saying that Rankey(ph) was not a communist. He was \u2014 he became a\nHolocaust expert, historian. And because of that his \u2014 his career during the\ncommunist ye-years was really jeopardized. Poch(ph) helped him a great deal, and\nhe helped others. So although Poch became a communist, he was still a \u2014 a great\nhuman being and helped a great deal of \u2014 great many men and people in their \u2014 in\nNovember 13, 1997\ntheir career. So I must say that I am personally very thankful to him and grateful,\nbecause for one, he taught me the love of history, which 1s \u2014 which I wanted to\nbecome my \u2014 my profession. Thankfully which did not become my profession, but\na lifetime hobby. 1948, Poch(ph) leaves and a number of other teachers leave the\nschool. Passover, Pesach, nine four \u2014 1948. We say goodbye to many of our friends\nwho went to a camp, Zionist camp. After Pesach, our s \u2014 our class of 38 became\nclass of 13. The rest of the people left. We found that they went through the Bricha\nlea(ph) to Israel. Many of them are still there. And we stayed \u2014 I wasn\u2019t a Zionist \u2014\nwith this small, shrinking class. They combined the other class with us, which also\nshrunk, and of the 72 people, we had now a class of roughly 30, a combined class of\n30. We had other teachers. Some teachers left with the Bricha, some teachers\nstayed. I became very interested in acting. We had a little acting group in our\nschool. I became interested. We had put on full three act plays. My father became\ninterested in this school. He wanted to help the school. He found out that the school,\nof course, lost most of its labs, and he wanted to raise money, so he figured a \u2014a\nway to ask famous performers to come to the school for nothing, and have\nfundraisings. And he became involved in many of these kinds of fundraisings. And\nyou would not believe the most famous singers came to sing; Jews and non-Jews\nalike, and they are always sold out performances, and my father was really a great\nNovember 13, 1997\nenterprise [indecipherable] and \u2014 and got enough money to rebuild the physics and\nbiological libr \u2014 labs. And in 1950 or \u201951, they dedicated a greenhouse on the top of\nthe building which my father raised money for. And so my father became the\npresident, or the P.T. and then my mother was very involved and I became involved\nwith the \u2014 on a student level. And it was from \u00b048 to \u201950 - \u00b052. They were \u2014 despite\nof the fact that \u2014 that there were \u2014 th-there were terrors, and \u2014 and \u2014 and worsening\npolitical situation and crisis, there was an island there. The school became a \u2014a\nseparate island, where we had a dicono \u2014 dichotomy where we shared both what we\nneeded to share, such as you know, what you needed to talk about, you know, the\ngreat communist camp, and the [indecipherable] the imperialist camp and all this\nphraseology, which we had to also say, but then we talked about what was the\nVoice of America saying, you know? So it was a really funny, ironic situation. The\nsame people who were parroting the phraseology were talking about the Voice of\nAmerica. And the teachers who had to parrot the phraseology also, Marxist\nphraseology, which they didn\u2019t believe in, who were Hebrew teachers before he\nbeca \u2014 they became Marxist, quote unquote, teachers, who were teaching Yiddish\ninstead of Russian, which they ended up teaching for a while, you know? These\nteachers knew that this is a big joke, that nobody believes in this, but we pretended\nthat something had to be done, and \u2014 and we did. Except for \u2014\nNovember 13, 1997",
        "A: Well, it certainly did. Of course, the \u2014 the tightening of the government, and the\n\u2014 the loss of rights brought back a lot of memories. And people who were deported\nduring the Holocaust, were deported again. This time not because they were Jewish,\nbut because they were capitalists, and capitalists couldn\u2019t live in Budapest, so they\ntook the \u2014 took away their \u2014 their homes and they deported them to the countryside.",
        "A: It absolutely did, but there was no choice in the matter now, of course, that the\nIron Curtain was shut. In 1948, after the Bricha, and very shortly thereafter when\nthe communists took power, things were over. And by then, of course, those of us\nwho recognized too late, and too belatedly that we were pretty stupid again, we\nwere there. So what could you do, you know? Well, what you could do was what\nwe did, which is to go along outwardly, and go to the May celebrations and the\nNovember celebrations, and at the same time talk about BBC and Radio Free\nEurope and trying to keep each other in \u2014 in a Jewish era. We were \u2014 we were still\nstudying \u2014 not legally at this point \u2014 Jewish things, Jewish history.\nNovember 13, 1997",
        "A: Absolutely. In the next \u2014 in the first two years after the war, Jewish gymnasium\nmeant that we were not studying, we were \u2014 we do not have Saturday classes, but\ninstead we had to go to the synagogue. So we did. That wasn\u2019t a pleasant thing for\nme, I was never a synagogue goer. But it made me want to know more Jewish\nhistory. It made me much more of a conscious Jew. And after the communist\ntakeover, the synagogue was closed, we couldn\u2019t \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the synagogue of the\n\u2014 the gymnasium was closed, it was no longer there. So \u2014 but \u2014 but we still had\nsome spark, and \u2014 and many times the spark was nothing more than, I know you are\nJewish and you know that I am Jewish, and you can trust me. And that was not\nalways the case, unfortunately, although I think we always knew whom we could\ntrust, within the school. We knew that there were a few people who \u2014 who we could\nnot, including teachers. And this came to a head in 1950. In 1950, there was a letter,\nwhich was drafted by a teacher and a student, which was circulated in the school,\ndemanding of the government of nationalizing our school. And they tried to\nintimidate the students and the teachers. And it came to a head because there was a\nconference, a te \u2014 a teacher-student-parent conference. And it was supposed to be a\nsecret letter, but somebody told that \u2014 the principal of what was going on. And this\n\u2014all hell broke loose. And I was there and I remember. There was a parent of a\nclassmate of mine whose \u2014 who told the students and the teacher, who did not want\nNovember 13, 1997\nto identify himself, that they are cowards, they are damn cowards, and they are\ntraitors. And it was really embarrassing because this was a communist inspired\nthing, you know. And this was toward the end of the school year, and in the next\nschool year, we had from 200 students, to 45, including the teacher who was \u2014 who\n\u2014 whom we found out was a\u2014 was a defector. And he left, he became a principal\nsomewhere else, and all these students. But I stayed, and 45 of us stayed. Our class\nof 30 became a class of 13. This was our sixth grade, 1t was junior high school. And\nwe stayed, and we became more Jewish, although outwardly we could do less. We\ncouldn\u2019t talk about Jewish history. We couldn\u2019t talk about Jewish things. But we\ncould talk about books written by Stefan Zweig and Berfer(ph). And we could\nsabotage learning Russian, for example. An ex-rabbi was teaching us Russian, who\ndid not know from Russian from a hole in the head. I mean, he was always a \u2014a\nlesson ahead of us, but that was it. And \u2014 and we took this as a joke, inside. But we\nrealized more and more, and more and more keenly that this island for us, is going\nto come to an end. And then what? And that end came in 1952, when I graduated.\nNow one of the motivations of the \u2014 all of my classmates who left, was that\nnobody\u2019s going to be accepted in a university from a parochial school such as the\nJewish gymnasium. That was the motivation why they left. It turned out very\nironically, that out of the two \u2014 four \u2014 13 of us who graduated, 11 of us were\n100November 13, 1997\naccepted. Because the regime in 1952 wanted to show the world that there was such\na thing as religious freedom. Much less of the people who left were accepted,\npercentage-wise. The only two who were not, were bad students, period, who didn\u2019t\neven want to go to school. I was accepted. And here came the big shock. The big\nculture shock, because I was trusting to the university, the technical university,\nBudapest, where we had a class of 1200 people, from 13 to 1200. And we had this\nhuge theater and we were sitting there, you know, men and women. And I found\nmyself in \u2014 very much in a minority. This was the year where it made a difference\nwho\u2019s \u2014 who your parents were; if your parents were peasants or workers, you got\naccepted regardless of your qualifications. If your parents were businessmen, you\nwat \u2014 you were rejected. My father was in-between, and I sort of, because he was a\n\u2014 what they call an intellectual, or a professional, that was not well thought of, but it\nwas better than a businessman for sure. My father wasn\u2019t a businessman by then, he\nworked for another company. And so in \u2014 I was able to slip in on this, but I found\nmy colleagues to be very different from me. The chemistry worked there. Very\nquickly we found from each other \u2014 0-of each other, who were Jewish. Of the f\u2014 of\nthe 1200, roughly about 150 of us were Jewish, which was a large percentage. And\nas I says, the magic of chemistry, I mean, we didn\u2019t know from Adam. We found\nus, each other and we drifted toward each other. The way the school were \u2014 was\n101November 13, 1997\ndivided up, we had subspecialties within mechanical engineering \u2014 this was only\nmechanical engineering. We had specialties on textile engineering, shipbuilding,\nwhatever else. And in my subspecialty, which was naval archy \u2014 naval architecture,\nwe had 30 people, I was the only Jew, and the rest of them were not. And we were\nsort of drifting in and out. I was \u2014 I was never really very friendly with these people\nbecause their culture, their \u2014 their interests were very different from me. I felt sorry\nfor them because they were not really qualified and they were really struggling with\nthe material. They didn\u2019t know elementary algebra when they had to learn calculus,\nand they really had a heck of a hard time, although the regime gave them all sorts of\nscholarships and stuff. I have to step back now because there is a \u2014 an important\nthing which happened in my life, right before graduation, personally. And that \u2014\nwhat happened was that I fell in love, 18 years old. This was right before graduation\nin February of 1952. Fell in love with a young girl who didn\u2019t understand my \u2014 my\nfeelings, and I was very brokenhearted when my feelings were not reciprocated.\nAnd I was so brokenhearted that I fell sick. They thought I had mononucleosis and\nother diseases and I was in the hospital for a month. And this was in February -\nMarch of *52, just before graduation. And my wa \u2014 mother and father were worried\nthat I was going to se \u2014 lose that year. But my colleagues were very nice and they\nbrought me up to date very f\u2014 very fast. Then April roll \u2014 rolled along, and walking\n102November 13, 1997\non the street, in a nice, bright, April afternoon, I met this girl who was very familiar.\nMade a long story short, it was the girl, Judith Kerienyi(ph), whom I met five\nyears earlier in a camp. Then we started to talk, she was, at this point, just\ngraduating from college. She became a singer, she never married. Didn\u2019t marry the\n\u2014 broke off with the fianc\u00e9, and she was single. I was 18, she was 22 - 23. And it\nwas a romance, and it was maybe an antidote to the love, the unrequited love I had\nbefore. It became a very hot romance, not to my mother\u2019s liking and my father\u2019s\nliking, who felt that I should really learn and study. The way it went in our school\nsystem is that we finished the school early, in May, and then we had six weeks of\nreal study, after which we had a five hour oral exam. And it was almost like a PhD\nthing. And the six weeks we supposed to cram in everything we need to know about\nthe oral. And we had these little [indecipherable] things, they had hundreds of\nquestions. We knew the questions, we just needed to learn the answers. Of course,\nthat was the trick, you know, you can\u2019t learn eight years of answers in two months.\nYou really had to learn some other things. But at that point, you know, the \u2014 the\nsummer was full blown and \u2014 and I was too interested in \u2014 in \u2014 in everything,\nmostly Judith, and less interested in the study. But I studied a little. And \u2014 and it\nwas just the hottest romance we had. It was sort of crazy. The \u2014 her parents worked,\nmy parents worked, so both of our apartments were vacant during the day and we\n103November 13, 1997\ntook advantage of it. And it was my real \u2014 first real romance. I mean, I had some\nsex before, but they were occasional type things, mostly prostitutes. This was really\na woman. I didn\u2019t know what \u2014 and she didn\u2019t know how to handle it either. Which\nwas too bad because she was 22, I was 18. If I didn\u2019t know how to handle it, well,\nthat was something, but she \u2014 she should have known better. Made a longer story\nshort, she became pregnant, and of course, my father and I didn\u2019t see eye to eye\nthrough this. I wanted to marry her, of course, it was moral obligation. My fa \u2014 my\nmother told me the same. My father said absolutely not, I am \u2014 you are a minor. In\n\u2014in Hungary you were a minor until 21, and I\u2019m not giving your permission and\nthat\u2019s that. Make the long story short, we didn\u2019t marry and she had an abortion. And\nthere is a letter which I still possess, which my mother wrote to Judith, where it\nwas a woman to woman letter; a very sad one, in fact. And saying that, you know,\nshe understands the \u2014 the pain and the sorrow. But she has to understand that I am\ntoo young and I am just starting my \u2014 my schooling, and she should have known\nbetter. And that romance stayed with me for a long time. That was really a very\npotent one in many different respects, and I never forgot it. It was a happy ending, if\nyou want, because she had an abortion, and then she got married and she has\nchildren. Nothing bad happened to her. But perhaps I am kidding myself, I don\u2019t\nknow. And I went on to school, and I had this \u2014 and I had another girlfriend about a\n104November 13, 1997\nyear later, who was more to my level of interest maybe, and same age as I was. And\nthe shock went on for four years, from 1952 to \u201956. I had the same girlfriend this\ntime, Erica was her name. And we had a tempestuous relationship. But there was a\n\u2014 there was something important which happened, not just with her but with my\ncircle of \u2014 small circle of friends. We still kept going to \u2014 to \u2014 to operas. We went to\ntheater. We kept a cultural core, which the country in itself did not, you know, they\n\u2014 they sort of sank into this Bolshevik slide. But we kept a western level of culture,\nand I think that kept our humanity, too, in a \u2014 1n a great degree. Between 1952 and\n\u201956, times were hard, and I was working very hard in \u2014 in school, trying to earn my\ncollege tuition, which I did. We were not rich, and I really needed to work. In the\nsummertime, I did. I went to \u2014 this was not my choice, I had to do work once \u2014 one\nmonth every summer, work \u2014 we got paid \u2014 in industry. And one month every\nsummer, we had to go to the \u2014 to the army. And I had a hard time in the army, I\nmust tell you. Both \u2014 I had three summers which I had to go to the army, and all\nthose three summers were very, very hard for me, I was not cut out to be a soldier.\nAnd that in is \u2014 in itself a story of itself, but I\u2019m not going to go in there. Fifty-six\ncame around. The winds of change started to be felt, and then tragedy struck. My\nfather all of a sudden got sick and died. He got celebra \u2014 cerebral hemorrhage. He\nwas a chain smoker, and finally got to him. This was at the end of March, right\n105November 13, 1997\nduring my period of exams, final exams. And I was very scared, and I didn\u2019t know\nhow to handle it. I was 22. I had a ver \u2014 a very good friend, his name was\nDionege(ph) Brock(ph), he was stud \u2014 he was studying to be a rabbi; in fact, he was\nalready a \u2014 an ordained rabbi and I asked him what he thinks, what he thought. He\nknew Erica very well, he knew me very well. He was a very, very close friend. He\nsort of said look, I think you should pull together. You should have a better \u2014 a\nbigger family. You should really be not one \u2014 I mean you \u2014 my family, my real\nfamily was not very close knit, particularly after my father died. In fact, even in the\nlast few years before my father died, my mother and father sort of drifted apart, and\nI drifted apart from my father. And I drifted \u2014 the only person I had close was my\nmother. I had a couple of cousins I wasn\u2019t that friendly with. My maternal\ngrandmother died. My paternal grandparents still had this family gathering every\nSunday, but after 18 I didn\u2019t want to go. I found them strange, I had nothing to say\nto them. So here, after my father died, I had literally very few people to go to. And I\nwas scared, so Erica\u2019s family, she had a sister and mother, father; they were very\nnice people, I liked them, and I liked Erica. And \u2014 and essentially I felt that maybe\nthis 1s the time when \u2014 when I should have my own, and then I engaged \u2014 I became\nengaged to her. And we had an engagement in August. And we were planning to get\nmarried after I graduated from school, which was at the fall of 1956. It was going to\n106November 13, 1997\nbe in October of \u201956. And in fact, in October of \u201956 \u2014 I just completed my last exam\non the 22\u2122 of October. The 23\" of October became a notable day, but for me the\n224 was the \u2014 the real clincher. There was a meeting late in the afternoon, right\nafter my exam, where I went to, student meeting, which lasted until three o\u2019clock in\nthe morning, and which, at the end, we declared that Hungary must be an\nindependent state and should declare neutrally \u2014 neutrality and the Russians, we\ndemanded the Russians get out. And we agreed that on the 23\" in the morning, we\nwould all come back to the university and we would have a \u2014 a demonstration.\nCame October 23\", I went to the university, we waited until late afternoon, we\nfinally got permission for the demonstration. I was there in Parliament Square, and\nthen I went home and then the shooting war started. I went back to the university\nabout a week later, and I participated in some of the \u2014 the skirmishes which had\nhappened there. November second, the Russian tanks rumbled through our\nneighborhood.",
        "A: Meaning I was shooting guns at whoever was shooting guns at us. This was a\nshoot \u2014\n107November 13, 1997",
        "A: Remember, this is a revolution against the Russians now. I am now with the\ngood guys. I am \u2014 I am fighting for Hungarian independence. I am just a graduate of\na university. I feel that maybe we have a chance, although some people think it\u2019s\nridiculous, and I find out a few days later that it 1s ridiculous, the world 1s not going\nto help us. Second of November came. The Russians came in. I felt that 1t was\nfutile, and at that point I wanted to stay alive, I d\u2014I didn\u2019t go out to shoot any\nmore.",
        "A: It did, it certainly did, th-the memory of that March Sunday, when the Germans\n\u2014 German tanks came in the very same route, toward the \u2014 the center of the city, and\nthat \u2014 that memory also triggered that, you know, what is happening here is \u2014 1s\nhistory repeating itself, or not. But there was not very much time for thinking here,\nbecause there was a war going on and for two weeks there was a \u2014 a real fighting. I\nmean, at that point we went \u2014 everybody from the building where we lived when\ndown to the basement, just like we had in 1944, and \u00b045. It was artillery duels. And\nby November, by the 20\" of November, the inside of the downtown was completely\ndemolished again. I mean, 10 years after the war, the downtown area looked just\nlike it did in 1945. Twenty-second of November \u2014 oh, during this period of time, we\n108November 13, 1997\nare listening to radio free Europe and a voice of America. And I was particularly\nappalled by the fact that I was sitting in Elizabeth Street, in a basement, while a\nbunch of people are already sending messages from Austria to their relatives,\nsaying that they are already in Austria and they don\u2019t know whether they are going\nto Australia or Canada yet. And I\u2019m sitting as \u2014 like a rat in a basement in\nBudapest. And I, just to mys \u2014 I am saying to myself, I mean, how many mistakes\ncan I make? I mean, my mother and father made enough mistakes. I\u2019m not going to\nmake the same. So, on the spur of the moment, I called my fianc\u00e9e and a friend, that\nin the next morning we are going to meet in [indecipherable] railroad station and\nthen we\u2019ll see what happens. And I bicycled there, because there was nothing else.\nSaid goodbye to my mother. The decision took all of a half an hour, and in the next\nmorning we met at the railroad station. We had a vague plan, which 1s to go to a\nborder town and then feel our way around. We never got there. After the \u2014 the \u2014 this\nis chaos now, there is no central government. The Russians are occupying part of\nthe country, not all of it. There 1s still fighting going on in the countryside.\nRailroads have no schedule, government is nonexistent. People are doing their\nthing. Obviously a lot of them are already outside of the country. The train was\ncompletely packed, maybe a thousand people. And shortly after we started, we\nfound out that most of the thousand people had the same idea, to go to the western\n109November 13, 1997\nborder and get out. We were told that it\u2019s dangerous to keep maps, so we throwed\nthe maps away. I had a couple of things in my pocket, two overcoats and a few\nother things. Couple of pieces of jewelry sewn into my pocket and who knows who\nto bribe, how to do whatever is going to happen. We had no idea.",
        "A: Well, it \u2014 I was 22 years old and I felt that in the war I made a few decisions\nwhich saved my life, and I am not going to stay around. I knew that some people\nknew that I was participating 1n the fighting. I knew that the Russians are not going\nto be very merciful for those who were participating. I could end up in jail, or\nworse. So I didn\u2019t have much of a choice and I really wanted to leave. I \u2014 I thought\nthis was the most psychologically opportune moment in the world for me. I had\ncompleted my undergraduate education, and here is an opportunity I would \u2014 would\npay, you know, I would take whatever chances there was. To make the long story\nshort, the train never reached the town where we went to. It stopped in a smaller\ntown, some 20 \u2014 25 miles from the border. We slept there, and the very next\nmorning went to the station, we got into a cattle train. The cattle train stopped in the\nmiddle of the day, in the middle of nowhere, and then we walked for two days, and\nended up at the border. And I didn\u2019t like the situation very much, because in the\n110November 13, 1997\nborder there was some fighting at night. So I told my fianc\u00e9e and our \u2014 our friend to\n\u2014 we are moving back. We moved back to a small village. I met a\u2014 we met a fellow\nwho told us that he would help us the very next morning, because he knew a way.\nAnd we also told him to go back to our parents and see if they would be able to\ncome out. The next morning we went out bright, early morning, and he told us that\nbetween those two haystacks, if we stay between them it\u2019s okay. That haystack \u2014\nbeyond that haystack are the Russian, beyond that haystack are the Hungarian\ncommunists, but in-between is okay. And that\u2019s what we did, we went in between.\nThe only problem was that right before no man\u2019s land, there was a quarter of a mile\nof completely cleared land, and behind that there were towers, watch towers.",
        "A: Probably. I do not know. At that point I was only thinking about the now and the\nthen. Th-The moment. We knew that we had to go \u2014 go through. We knew that we\nalso had an excellent chance of being shot in the back from the watchtowers. We\nalso knew that in front of us, which used to be a minefield, the mines were removed\na few months before, and we have no other barrier. And this was the chance. And I\nthink there are some points in life when one does not think too much, and hesitate\ntoo much, because if one does, one gets paralyzed. So what I just did, I started to\ncurse in Hungarian, started to yank my fianc\u00e9e as fast as I could. We ran though this\n111November 13, 1997\npart, and it took us probably all of two minutes, but it 11 \u2014 seemed like an hour. And\nthen we were there, we were \u2014 we were in no-man\u2019s land, we saw the Austrian\nflags, and we were on the other side, and then in about five minutes later, the\nAustrian border patrol intercepted us. We didn\u2019t speak the language, but they didn\u2019t\nwant. Turned out, when we ww-went to Lutzmannsdorf, which was the first little\ntown, is that the night before, the border police all defected, and so nobody was up\nthere, but I didn\u2019t know that. So my \u2014 my luck was still \u2014 still with me. And then the\nvery next day, the Joint came to Eisenstaedt, which was the next largest city. They\ntook us to Linz. It was already organized, all the hotels in Linz, which was Hitler\u2019s\nhometown, were reserved for the Jews, and that was an ironic twist of fate. It was\nWiesenthal \u2014 I don\u2019t know if you know the name Wiesenthal, Simon Wiesenthal,\nwho was in charge of that operation. We had hundreds of Hungarian Jews there.\nThe non-Hungarian \u2014 Hungarian non-Jews were thrown into a camp, and we were\nthere for three weeks. Meanwhile, the Joint fed us and paid our hotel room. There\ncame recruiters from Canada and from the United States. When they found out\nthat I was an engineer, young engineer, they said absolutely, you should come.\nWhen they found out that I had an uncle here, they said no problem at all. And three\nweeks later, on the 19\" of December of 1956, our plane touched down in Newark,\nand we went to Camp Kilmer, and a day later I was in New York City.\nNovember 13, 1997",
        "A: Well, it was unreal. We had a 30 hour flight. We stopped in Reykjavik \u2014 in\nReykjavik, Iceland, we were in Scotland, we were in Labrador. Not the jet\nplanes, th-they \u2014 they had no jet planes in \u201956. It was a \u2014 it was an exhaustive \u2014\nexhausting trip because the night before we started, we already were going \u2014 we\noriginally were going from Linz to Salzburg, and in Salzburg we didn\u2019t have a\nplace, so they sent us back to Linz, and from Linz to Muenchen(ph). And so we\nwere on a bus for 14 or 15 hours before we had the 30 hour flight. So I was sort of\nin no-man\u2019s land. There was one thing which happened a day before we left, which\nwas very important. We visited Mauthausen. This was an inoculation against\nEurope and against any kind of \u2014 of \u2014 of wanting to go back to the old \u2014 to the old\n\u2014 to the old country.\nEnd of Tape Three, Side B\n113\nNovember 13, 1997\nBeginning Tape Four, Side A",
        "A: Prior to leaving Austria, my mother and I were in almost daily telephone\ncontact.",
        "A: I\u2019m sorry. The day before we left for the United States, we decided my \u2014 my\nfianc\u00e9e and my friend and I decided to inoculate ourselves against any kind of\nhomesickness, so visited mau \u2014 we visited Mauthausen. Mauthausen is ina\nfantastic place, it\u2019s on the top of a hill. Beautiful view, and unspeakable horrors. In\n\u00b056, Mauthausen was very different, I am sure, than what it is now. It was much\ncloser to what it was in 1944, and we had a vivid sense of what had \u2014 what must\nhave been. And \u2014 and it certainly recalled all the horrors which we read about and\nwhich we heard about from the surviving friends and relatives who came back and\nwho \u2014 some of whom came back from Mauthausen. I have a number of uncles who\nwere in Mauthausen and who came back. And so I could now put together the \u2014\nthe name and the place, and it certainly cured me for \u2014 for many, many years, for 38\nyears from \u2014 from any kind of homesickness. And then the next morning, as I\nmentioned, we were bound to go to \u2014 to Salzburg and then back and forth until we\n114\nNovember 13, 1997\ngot to the plane. Prior to leaving, finding ou \u2014 we only found out that we were\ncoming to the United States about a week before we left. We did not know\nprecisely what was going to happen, how long things would take. And shortly after\nwe left Hungary, my mother and I, and my fianc\u00e9e\u2019s parents were in daily\ntelephone contact. The original plan was that her \u2014 her parents and my mother\nwould essentially come to Austria and then we would meet there. The peasant who\nhelped us over, indeed went to \u2014 to Budapest and he on \u2014 he also told them that\nthey could come with him and he would help them. But they didn\u2019t want to take the\nchance. It started to be fairly late in December. My mother and a cousin of mine\nwent down to Szeged, which is close to the Yugoslavian border. They tried it there,\nthey couldn\u2019t do it, they were turned back. And I told my mother not to go\nanywhere, just stay in Budapest and see what happens and leave the country\nlegally. I didn\u2019t want to wait for her because by then we had the papers and I didn\u2019t\nwant to miss the opportunity to come to the United States. So, late at night on the\n19\" of December we touched down. On the 20\", I met my uncle, who was very\nstrange, or somewhat strange, told me that you don\u2019t need those Jews. You come\nwith me, I live in New Jersey, and Ill take care of you. I told him that, that\u2019s nice,\nbut I came with my fianc\u00e9e and I\u2019m not going to let her just drift away. He\nreluctantly took her also with him, and us. We went to this New Jersey place, it\u2019s\n115November 13, 1997\nWharton, New Jersey, it\u2019s a small town, small Hungarian town, sort of. Most of\nthe Hungarians who live there, lived there since either the 20s or 30s, or after the\nwar, which meant that most of them were Nazis. Now my uncle 1s a fisi\u2014 was a\nphysician. I didn\u2019t know it then, but I found out very soon that he converted, and he\nwanted to keep his Jewish origins a deep, dark secret. This led to a fallout, and a\nvery irreconcilable difference between him and me. Until I left Hungary, I went to\nsay Kaddish for my father every day. When I came to this country, I couldn\u2019t. There\nwas no Jewish synagogue in Wharton. My uncle arranged for me to have a job,\nmean \u2014 two \u2014 two weeks after I came, as well as my fianc\u00e9e. She was a chemist, she\nspoke English, she got a fairly good job. I got a general helper\u2019s job in a small\nfactory, not a very satisfactory job for an engineer, but that was what I cou-could\nhave. What \u2014 and it went on for a couple of months, but what really broke things 1s\nthat in March was my Yahrzeit, and my fianc\u00e9e and I had decided to go to the next\ntown, which had a little, small synagogue. And we \u2014 to say Kaddish. So I went to\nsay Kaddish, and there we met a friend of my uncle\u2019s whom we \u2014 knew we were\nJewish. And that friend told my uncle a couple days later that we saw George and\nhis fianc\u00e9e in a synagogue. You know, ho \u2014 what \u2014 what\u2019s going on? Well, my\nuncle was quite furious about this and told me that \u2014 why didn\u2019t I tell him this, he\nwould have taken me a hundred miles somewhere, where nobody knew him. So it\n116November 13, 1997\nwas a big fallout. I wrote to my mother very angrily, and so angry that I forgot to\nput the address. And it \u2014 the letter was intercepted by the mailman, who was a\nHungarian, who gave it to the Hungarian priest of the town, who opened the letter\nand in short order found out who the letter came from, and with e \u2014 much glee I am\nsure, gave it to my uncle, who almost killed me. And wrote a letter to my mother\nthat I will end up in a gallows in this country and I will \u2014 and I am just a terrible\nperson. My mother, who was absolutely petrified as to what will happen to me.\nAnyway, make the long story short on that, I was able to get a scholarship at\nTemple University to learn English, and in March of 1958, which was \u2014 \u00b057 rather,\nsorry, three and a half months after I went to live with my uncle, I left. My fianc\u00e9e\nstayed there. I went to vi \u2014 to Philadelphia, I stayed there for over a year. My\nfianc\u00e9e and I sort of broke up at this point. She moved to New York, and later on\nshe got married. My uncle and I broke up quite a bit, quite severely, and my mother\nleft Budapest in August of 1957, with a visa to Israel. She never went to Israel,\nshe stayed in Italy. My uncle, who was her brother, helped him \u2014 her a bit,\nhowever, in reality what he did 1s he told me that I have to help my mother. And I\nsent my uncle a certain amount of money every month so that he would send it to\nmy mother. After Temple, I got a job as an engi \u2014 junior engineer at Westinghouse,\nand I was there for about four months, after which I got a scholarship at Drexel and\nNovember 13, 1997\nI started to study engineering. And I did that until March of \u201958, at which time I\nfound out that my mother was going to come to the United States and she will be\ncoming in the next six months. And my uncle very specifically told me that he was\nnot going to help my mother come to the United States, or help her when she\u2019s\nhere. So I had no choice in the matter, I quit school. I went to New York. I was\nunemployed there for a little while, and then my friends have it \u2014 my friend\u2019s help, I\ngot a job. And with another interesting story, I met a Russian princess who helped\nme to get the job here in Washington. This Russian princess happened to be the\ncousin of the Lazar(ph). Her name was Princess Trumbetskoy(ph), and for some\nreason and another, hil \u2014 she liked me. And she called Cardinal O\u2019 Boyle, who was\nthe chancellor of the Catholic University of America and told him that, here is this\nrefugee boy, and that she would like to help him. And I got a interview, and I got a\njob as an instructor there. I also enrolled in graduate school there, I stayed there for\nseven years. I taught there mechanical engineering, a-and endi \u2014 ending up as an as-\nassistant professor and receiving my Master\u2019s degree in mechanical engineering in\n1962. In 1960, I met a young, Jewish girl, and we got married that summer. That\nmarriage was a disaster and we divorced nine months later. Two months after I\ncame to Washington in \u201958, my mother arrived here. And I live with my mother\nfrom \u00b058 until 64. And I worked in the university and my mother \u2014 most of the\n118November 13, 1997\ntime my mother didn\u2019t work, essentially. She found a little job to get a social\nsecurity, finally. And the university was \u2014 the university experience was \u2014 was not\nas rewarding as I was hoping for, it \u2014 it\u2019s a small school. At that time Catholic\nUniversity was a rather backwards school in terms of theology. They still didn\u2019t\nstep out to the 15\" century, and although they tolerated me as a Jew, they didn\u2019t\ntolerate me as a divorced Jew, and I got some flack and by the time I realized that\nthat\u2019s not much of a future for me, I got another job, and I left. Well, actually,\ndivorce wasn\u2019t as bad as my remarriage in 1964. I met another Jewish girl here, and\nwe married. And that \u2014 after that, things became very intolerable. By then I only\nworked part-time at school. I got a job in a research inst \u2014 a research in \u2014 firm, a\nsmall firm, and it was very interesting. One thing which happened after I got my\ncitizenship in 1962, shortly after I got my degree, 1s I got my passport, and I took\nadvantage of still working in a university and I went to Europe for two months,\nwhich was the first time since \u201956, and the first time I really had a chance to travel.\nAnd it was a fabulous two months of \u2014 of \u2014 of not just vacationing, but \u2014 but\ndiscovering western Europe. It was very interesting, because I sailed on a ship,\nwhich was called the USS France. On the manifesto of that ship, there was a girl,\nher name was Toby Yaspar(ph). She became my wife a year later. We didn\u2019t know\nthat we were sailing on the same ship, or if we were traveling together. We met in a\n119November 13, 1997\n\u2014in a Jewish get together, about a half a year later. In 1966, I went to join the \u2014\nwork for the navy. At that time I already finished all the courses which I needed for\nmy PhD, and I needed a thesis. And the university had no laboratory which was\nreally capable of doing anything. So one of the lecturers there, who worked for the\nDavid Taylor Model Basin, told me to come to work for him, and then I can work\non my thesis there, which is what I did. I worked there 11 years. I worked there in\nhigh energy gas dynamics, and I wrote my thesis. I never got my degree, because by\nthe time I wrote my thesis, I lost my minors, which was nuclear engineering, and I\njust didn\u2019t \u2014 I was in \u2014 1n school studying 12 years at that point, and I had enough of\nit. And I really didn\u2019t think that I needed it. So I had all the PhD courses finished,\nand I \u2014 the thesis finished, the comprehensive was the only thing I didn\u2019t. It was 11\nyears of research; nice years, interesting research. I wrote more than 50 papers. I\nwas involved in the professional development there. And then in 1977, I had an\nopportunity to get a promotion somewhere else, which I did. I moved from 19 \u2014\nfrom Maryland where | lived, to Virginia. Unfortunately, my family life did not\nturn out as well as my career. After six years, my wife and I, with mutual consent\ngot divorced. Reason why we did \u2014 and this was a \u2014 again a fairly long story, is I\nhad a problem having children, wanting children, and she wanted children. We went\nthrough three years of therapy and the therapy resolved nothing except that her\n120November 13, 1997\nbiological clock was running and that the only way that she could have a child is if\nshe will marry somebody else.",
        "A: Precisely. I didn\u2019t think that I would be a very competent father after which I\nwent through, and the father which I \u2014 whom I had, whom I adored in one sense and\nin another sense I was very ambivalent about, and I was afraid that I would be just\nlike him and I would be incompetent and I didn\u2019t want anybody to have that kind of\na life. I went through three more years of therapy after this, because I wasn\u2019t sure\nthat \u2014 1f it was the final decision, but it was. Then we divorced in \u201973 - \u201974. And it\nwas during our separation when I went to Israel the first time. It was a fantastic\nexperience in 1970. It was a real revelation, and the first time in my life, perhaps, I\nfelt home. And I didn\u2019t feel home in a sense that I wanted to live there, but I felt a\nreal close kinship. I had many friends there, and \u2014 and the land was just\nindescribable. I went back two more times in the next 15 years after that. I traveled\na great deal, I was single for 20 years. I traveled every year abroad, from the Far\nEast to the Middle East to Europe many times. My career went fine. I worked for\nthe navy two more jobs. From 1977 to \u201988, I worked for a high energy laser project,\nwhere I became a project manager, and it was a very exciting, new edge, high \u2014\n121\nNovember 13, 1997\nhigh tech e \u2014 envelope program, edge of the envelope program. And the next one is\n\u2014ha-happened from 1988 to 1994, where I worked for a multi-national project\noffice, which was the NATO [indecipherable] office, where I very \u2014 where I\njokingly said I wanted this job because I \u2014 al-always in my job I was the only one\nwith an accent, and this \u2014 in this office, I would be in the majority, having 13\ndifferent nations, and people from 13 different nations work there, although I was\nthe only Hungarian. And we had a lot of fun, it was a very interesting project,\ndeveloping a \u2014 a vertical missile. And I was very instrumental in that. After the\nproject was over, which was in 1993, unfortunately things for the navy became a\nlittle bleak, and the technical challenges \u2014 whereas the money sort of went away.\nAnd at the end of 1994, I decided to \u2014 to retire. There were two things which\nhappened in the early 90s. One is that my mother got sick at age 89. We lived apart,\nbut very close for 20 years. Now, we moved back together, she moved back. She\nwas an invalid and I took care of her for 18 months. And the last 18 months of her\nlife perhaps was the happiest for many years for her, in spite of her sickness. She\nfelt that we were again together. In her 90\" birthday she beca \u2014 she got the heart\nfailure. They pulled her out for some reason, she lived six more weeks. And then in\nMay of 1991, she died of heart failure, her fourth. In 1990, after some unsuccessful\nrelationships, some long term, some short term, I met a woman who was as far\n122November 13, 1997\naway from my culture as anybody could be. She wa \u2014 she\u2019s Mexican, her name is\nLetitia. And what I found out, actually it was in 1991, and I found out that when\nmy mother got sick, that my American girlfriend didn\u2019t stick out with me, but this\nwoman, whom I met only two or three weeks earlier, did. And she stuck with me\nfor a year and a half almost, with \u2014 under these conditions and \u2014 and I found not\nonly a kinship, but also love. We got married in 1992, and we are still married. She\nworks in the Mexican embassy and we are pretty happy now. So I think that\u2019s the\nend of the story.",
        "A: I learned about the museum probably 10 years before it was built, through some\nsolicitations and through friends whose \u2014 who provided some funds to the museum.\nI did not know very much about the museum until I saw an ad, I think in the\n\u201cWashington Jewish Week,\u201d where the museum advertised for volunteers. This\nwas in 1992. And I went to the L Street, where the museum headquarters were at\nthe time, and I didn\u2019t know what was going on, and I volunteered and I said I could\nhelp in the library, could do some translations from Hungarian to English. And I got\n\u2014I\u2014I worked a little bit with \u2014 with a car \u2014 with Sheri(ph) Shebo(ph) \u2014 you know\n123November 13, 1997\n\u2014I don\u2019t know if you know Sheri(ph). She \u2014 I think she still works up in the library.\nAnd I worked there for a couple of months until the first course started for the\nvolunteers for the visitors\u2019 services. And I was in \u2014 in that group.",
        "A: I felt that the museum fulfills a mission for me. I am a survivor and I had a\nresponsibility and a mission until I can, and I\u2019m capable of, to associate myself with\nprojects which have something to do with the Holocaust. My awareness started\nbefore the museum, in the mid \u2014 mid-80s, when Holocaust became a subject, which\nthey spoke again about. As you know, the Holocaust was a taboo subject, even in\nthis country, for many years. Although I read a n\u2014 a number of books, it\u2019s\nastonishing how little came up between say 1956 and 1986. There were a few books\nonly, and not very much of the Holocaust. I think where I became more aware is the\ngathering. I was a volunteer there, because I felt that I was really not a survivor, that\n\u2014 that, you know, this was for the older survivors, and the concept of child survivor\ndid not hit me at that point. It hit me a couple of years later, when I started to read\nabout child survivor groups. And in 1991 I got associated with a group here in\nWashington, called the Washington-Baltimore area child survivors, and I became\nvery active. We had a conference in 1991, and at that time I knew about the\nmuseum, and I became very interested in that, as well as the child survivor group. I\n124\nNovember 13, 1997\nstarted to write, I started to read more, I started to speak to groups. And by 1992 -\n1993, I was a \u2014a full-fledged volunteer who is \u2014 was more than eager to do\nsomething, and I liked the idea of wanting to educate the public, as well as others,\nabout the Holocaust. I felt that the people, even the Jewish people, were ignorant\nand that they really need education, and I felt that the museum was a \u2014 was the\nvehicle for that. And so when we finished, I was more than eager to start working\nthere. The first thing I did is I, when the opportunity arose, I \u2014 I completed the\nlearning center specialist course, and I finished another cor \u2014 specialized course for\n\u2014 for student, and then for teacher guides in the permanent exhibition, which I still\ncan do, and do occasionally. And then I got associated with the speakers\u2019 bureau in\n1980 \u2014 in 1995. And in 795 - \u201996, I\u2014 I spoke to a number of outside groups: among\nthem Pentagon, a number of army establishments, schools, synagogues and\nchurches. And I feel that \u2014 that that aspect of \u2014 of my work, in conjunction with the\nmuseum is very appropriate for me as a \u2014 as a survivor.",
        "A: Some of them are different. Most of them center about my own story, you know,\nsurvi \u2014 as a survivor. But I have spoken to high schools, such as the Lee High\nSchool in Silver Spring about other things, such as the relevance of \u2014 of the\nHolocaust in today\u2019s world. It\u2019s a \u20141t\u2019s amazing how many people think that the\n125November 13, 1997\nHolocaust is really not relevant, and how I feel that that\u2019s wrong, and that there is\ntremendous relevance even today and will for the future. In a sense, I am very\ndesperate to \u2014 to \u2014 to preserve the memory, which whatever means that takes. I\nwrote up my story, which was published, incidentally, in 1993 also, asa\u2014asa\ncollection of stories with 11 other Hungarians and \u2014 and it\u2019s published in a book.\nAnd I \u2014 I am writing now a \u2014 a lo \u2014 long \u2014 longer autobiography which will be\nprobably a full-length book. Not just my Holocaust, but my post-Holocaust\nexperience in life in general.",
        "A: It certainly has. It induced me to \u2014 to learn a lot more. I thought I knew the\nHolocaust fairly well, through roughly 10 - 15 years of reading, but I found out that\nI needed to learn a great deal too. And in the last five years, oh, I read maybe a\ncouple of hundred books on the Holocaust and I took a number of courses, mostly\nin the museum. There are tremendous courses in the museum, for learning center\nspecialists and research department. I try to go to every course and every lecture\nand every one or two day cour \u2014 one or two day \u2014\n126November 13, 1997",
        "A: \u2014 sem-seminars, wherever it\u2019s offered, then wherever I have time. I \u2014 I went\nmaybe 50 of them already. So I am \u2014 I\u2019m really immersed, and it made me very\nconscious about a lot of things. A lot of things which a lot of people just sort of\ndon\u2019t care about or \u2014 or feel that it\u2019s not \u2014 not relevant any more, and I think it 1s.",
        "A: Why 1s it relevant? I think that it\u2019s relevant because people are \u2014 most people in\nthis country and everywhere else in the world are still as disinterested in what\nhappens to other groups who are discriminated against, or who are being killed, as\nthey were 53 years ago when the Jews were killed, and I think the message 1s still\nfresh. You cannot be disinterested, you must be involved, because involvement is\nthe only insurance for the world to prevent mass genocides.",
        "A: I do believe that that\u2019s the case. I believe that every time that I say to a group\nwho comes, and whose \u2014 and I give group \u2014 little \u2014 little group orientations when I\nsay that my name is George Pick and I am a survivor and all of a sudden everybody\nlooks at me. And it \u2014 it \u2014 I think a survivor is a \u2014 1s the only direct link people have\nto the Holocaust, and I believe that that is a unique thing I bring to the museum, and\n127November 13, 1997\nall the survivors who are there, bring to the museum. And I think the museum\nshould take maximum advantage of that.",
        "A: Yes, I do, I\u2014 the \u2014 I have two sets of survivor friends. The \u2014 some of them are\nolder than I am. The ones who are Hungarian, and who are in their 70s, and some of\nwho gave considerable amount of money to \u2014 to the museum. Who can afford to,\nbut they do. And who are \u2014 some who are not as wealthy, myself included, who\nwould give our time. I know that a number of us are volunteering in the museum\nwho are Hungarians and who are survivors. Same thing from the survivor \u2014 child\nsurvivor group. And I am \u2014",
        "A: Not as good as I would like it. I would like to have more of them volunteer and\nmore of them go out, but each year I can \u2014 I can persuade a few more people to \u2014 to\nget involved. And as \u2014 that\u2019s always pleasing to me, and I\u2019m always gratified if that\nhappens \u2014 if \u2014 when that happens. And I\u2019m trying to keep people\u2019s minds out \u2014\ninterestingly enough, few \u2014 few of my friends who really suffered a great deal\nthrough the camps, are not willing to speak out and not willing to face, maybe never\nwill face the horrors they \u2014 they had gone through. And \u2014 and I sympathize and I\n128November 13, 1997\nunderstand that. But I encourage everybody else, who are capable of talking, to \u2014 to\ntalk to the museum, talk to the foundation, the Shoah Foundation, and give\ntestimony.",
        "A: We have a very close-knit relationship. We know, of course who the survivors\nare, and we speak perhaps more among ourselves. We have now a group who meet\nabout twice a \u2014 about once every two months. We have now the \u2014 the director of\nsurvivor affairs, and Martin Goldman, who is encouraging us to interact with him\nand with each other. We are very concerned about the museum and we are\nconcerned about the direction the museum takes. We want to make sure that the \u2014\nthe Jewish aspect of the Holocaust is emphasized and that the Jewish aspects of the\nHolocaust are not going to fall by the wayside. We understand it\u2019s a \u2014it\u2019s a\ngovernment institution, but we still believe that the main event of the Holocaust was\nstill the \u2014 the Holocaust against the Jewish people. And we emphasize that among\nourselves, and among the \u2014 the visitors. We do not think this is in contradiction with\nany kind of museum policy, should not be, and must not be. And so we are \u2014 we\nfeel that we want to preserve the museum\u2019s main mission, which is to explain the\nHolocaust and show what \u2014 what had happened during that period.\n129November 13, 1997",
        "A: I do.",
        "A: Well, I think we have now, this year particularly, succeeded in steering the \u2014 the\nmuseum back a little bit. I was unhappy about the \u2014 the Nazi Olympics. I think it\nwas \u2014 it make \u2014 it first of all, cost a lot of money and a lot of resources, and I don\u2019t\nthink it has a direct relationship to the Holocaust. I mean, 1t was a \u2014 an event, a Nazi\nevent, but there were many, many, many other events, which had direct relations. I\nam very happy now that the Kovno ghetto exhibit will come. I was happy with the\nFry exhibit. But the \u2014 but I thought that going \u2014 going with that Nazi exhibit \u2014 Nazi\nOlympic exhibit was essentially going away from that. I was also unhappy for the\nsame reason of that little exhibit we had, which was the faces of Bosnia, or\nwhatever they called. Which I sympathize again, I felt that it was a terrible\ngenocide, and you know, I sympathize with all this, but again, that served to \u2014 to\nsteer away the muse \u2014 from the museum\u2019s main mission. And I don\u2019t think we can\nafford that, we have too many other \u2014 too \u2014 too many things which is not in the\nmain exhibit, which should be said in the various other exhibits.\n130November 13, 1997",
        "A: Well, such as \u2014 what, for example was the \u2014 you know, the Jews, as victims are\nshown pretty well in the main exhibit. But what about the Jews as contributors of\nEuropean culture and science? We were not victims before Hitler came; we were\ngreat contributors. There is \u2014 I think the museum has that part \u2014 the museum\u2019s\nmission is very integrated with that, to show that \u2014 that our contribution, our 1,000\nyear old contribution to European culture and civilization and technology is more\nthan just six million deaths. And I think the museum should have an exhibit for that\n\u2014 pretty soon, as a matter of fact. That\u2019s one idea, and I had about 20 or 30 other\nideas which I wrote up as a\u2014 in a memo to the management, and which I submitted\nto the ma \u2014 high management in January of this year. I really believe that they are\nlooking at some of it, and some of these ideas are already bearing some fruition. But\nI think they have a long way to go, and many years to do it. And I think that \u2014 that \u2014\nthat management should not forget these aspects of the Holocaust.\nEnd of Tape Four, Side A\nBeginning Tape Four, Side B\n131November 13, 1997",
        "A: My impression of the non-survivor volunteers?",
        "A: And staff.",
        "A: Okay, yes, of course. I think that it 1s not a coincidence that in the volunteer\ncorps, probably 95 percent are Jewish, whether they are survivors or non-survivors.\nI feel that, and I very much encourage anybody who volunteers to volunteer for the\nmuseum whether Jewish or non-Jewish. But there 1s, I think, a reason why Jews feel\nmore of a mission there than a non-mission. And I feel the same thing about the\nstaff. I am sorry to say that one of the concerns I have, and not only I, but many\nothers, is that many of the staff, the Jewish staff, 1s leaving the museum, and many\nof them already have left.",
        "A: Well, that\u2019s a good question, I don\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t know what the answer is, but I\nhave a feeling that the answer is very complex. One aspect of that answer is that the\nmuseum, in some respects become a bureau \u2014 bi \u2014 be \u2014 is becoming a bureaucracy,\njust like any other bureaucracy and it kills initiative. And there are some \u2014 there\nwere some very bright people there, with ideas and initiatives, who were stifled and\nwho were frustrated and who find \u2014 found a dead end situation there, and left. They\n132November 13, 1997\nwere not just a bunch of young people who left, whom I knew and sympathized\nwith, and who would have loved to stay in a museum if they have seen for\nthemselves some \u2014 some way up and some way to develop. But some senior man \u2014\nsenior people, senior historians, who had a reputation, and whose reputation\nenhanced the reputation of the museum, such as the research center. I was very\nsorry to see Baron(ph) Vaughn(ph) first of all leaving. I was very sorry to see\nwhen Sylvia Milton left. And my fear 1s that, with these kind of people leaving the\nmuseum, the research institute is not going to be able to attract the type of reputable\nscientists, such as Browning and others. It is not just a matter of money, I think it\u2019s\na matter of reputation, and I think the \u2014 the institute started out as a world class \u2014\nworld class institution, and I am not positive that it still maintains that status today,\nand I think it should. And if it doesn\u2019t now, it should certainly strive to do it again.\nThat is an awful lot that institution needs to do, and had the potential to doing it. I\nthink the museum management should definitely strive to \u2014 to nurture that\ninstitution, and my impression is that it is not doing that.",
        "A: What I like to see them do is to first of all encourage and hire world class\nhistorians to work there. As I said, some of them already left, and I\u2019m not positive\nthat too many of them wants \u2014 wants to work there under the circumstances. I think\n133November 13, 1997\nsome enticement, grants, sut \u2014 etcetera, probably will bring some of them back. But\nI think that there is a \u2014 a limitation there. There are other institutions who are\ncompeting for these same people, and I think if \u2014 1f the research institute is not\ngoing to compete successfully in the next few years, they may lose that kind of\nbrainpower, and I think that would be a great loss.",
        "A: Yes, well I\u2014 I believe that some of the exhibits, some of various ghetto exhibits\n\u2014 I think Kovno is \u2014 1s a good \u2014 good \u2014 I\u2019m sure it will be a good exhibit, but there\nare other ghettos and life in \u2014 in ghettos which were very different from Kovno and\nwhich is portrayed in the main exhibits, which should be shown. For example, in \u2014\nin west Europe, the ghettos were very different. I think that there should be exhibits\nabout the Hungarian Jews, and this is not because I am a Hungarian Jew, but\nbecause the Hungarian Jewish story is very different from the story of the Polish\nJews or the Lithuanian Jews, and it \u2014 in my estimation it\u2019s underrepresented in the \u2014\nin the main exhibit, anyway. So it should \u2014 it should find someplace else. The\nFrench Jews same thing, and \u2014 and the west European Jews, in a general sense, are\nalso underrepresented, and they should be given at least temporary space.\n134November 13, 1997",
        "A: Yes. These memorable experiences had been very asso \u2014 very much associated\nwith teachers training there. I was fortunate to be invited a couple of times to speak\nto them, in a Belfer conference. I was very sorry to see Marshall Sabol(ph) leave,\nwho recognized very early on the potential of the survivor contributions to teachers\u2019\neducation. After Marshall left, he took some time in doing, and I must say to myse\n\u2014 to \u2014 must say that I was the one who forced the issue also there, until the a \u2014 the\neducation department recognized the contribution with the educ \u2014 which the\nsurvivors could make to education. But I had some memorable instances this year,\nwhen I participated in a Belfer conference, not as a speaker, but as just sitting\naround and listening to others, and having teachers come to me with questions and\nwanting me to show them the main exhibit and comment on them. And one \u2014 and\ntelling me \u2014 and I have go-gotten letters from them, several, not just this year, but\nother years, is that their me \u2014 most meaningful experience was to meet survivors.\nThat many things they could learn from books and from exhibits, but the person to\nperson touch was \u2014 was most meaningful for them, and which they hope to transmit\nto their students. And I really believe that. That was certainly most memorable for\nme there.\n135November 13, 1997",
        "A: Of course, I \u2014 I under \u2014 I identify with everything. It would be saying, you know,\nif you have many children, who do you love more? But despite of that, there are\ncertain things obviously, which \u2014 which were closer \u2014 or which are closer to me\nthan other pieces are. For example, the portrait of Raoul Wallenberg. Obviously,\nthe man who saved my life, directly and indirectly and who saved my immediate\nfamily\u2019s life, makes a difference to me. But \u2014 but everything is meaningful. And of\ncourse th-the-the large pictures which \u2014 which show the Hungarian Jews on the\nramp of Auschwitz in the selection process, the two little boys whose bewildered\nfaces remind me of my own, and whose uniform they wear, I had as six years old. I\nhave a picture of it, and I provided that to the museum to show that this was a\nuniform which little Hungarian boys, whether they were Jewish or not, wore. And\nso I am always very moved by their faces, and think of me, that I could be one of\nthem. They of course, not survived and I did. And that is a very emotional thing, but\nfor me \u2014 and a lot of people always wonder, how could I be a survivor and \u2014 and go\nthrough that \u2014 that exhibit so many times, isn\u2019t that stressful? The answer is,\nabsolutely. It\u2019s a gut-wrenching experience, and I \u2014 I feel that I owe that to \u2014 to the\n136November 13, 1997\ndead, and I owe that to myself and I owe that to the people whom I try to educate,\nof what it was, not just to look from the outside in, but what it was to be in, in hell.",
        "A: I\u2014I do not remember consciously resisting. After the war, particularly after the\ncommunists took over in Hungary, this was a taboo subject. We did not focus at\nthis, we had day \u2014 daily problems and concerns. The memory, as fresh as it 1s 53\nyears later, was somehow buried for many, many decades, without losing its\nvividity, its \u2014 its vividness, its \u2014 its \u2014 its relevance. And it stayed there. I mean, it\nobviously this kind of things don\u2019t go away forever, but I never resisted it\nconsciously, I si \u2014 I simply just went somewhere else. I \u2014 I did \u2014 and I \u2014 I must say\nalso that my life is not defined by the Holocaust. Maybe in the later, last few years\nit\u2019s focusing \u2014 the Holocaust is more of a focus. But as you heard it from my post-\nHolocaust experiences and my \u2014 my professional life, I was not \u2014 the fofo \u2014 the\nHolocaust did not deter me in what I was doing. I was among the probably few who\nended up not in a helping profession. You would be a-amazed how many of the\nsurvivors ended up in a helping profession, or ha \u2014 how many ended up in\nbecoming a\u2014 more lawyers and doctors, and how few are engineers. But I was\namong the ones who became the hard scientist and I felt that my real calling and\n137November 13, 1997\nprofession was engineering and science, although I am trying to catch up now, and I\nam very much like \u2014 I would like to learn as much as I can about the Holocaust. I\nstill do not regard myself as, you know, as a survivor only. But I f\u2014 want to use my\nsurvivor status to speak, and my \u2014 my privileged voice to speak and to teach as long\nas I can.",
        "A: Iam sure I would be. I think the wartime experiences has \u2014 had taught me a\ngreat deal. Many things which I probably wouldn\u2019t be. Persistence. Not be cowed\nby \u2014 by intimidations. Sometimes recognize when a crucial decision have to be\nmade, and I learned that heroes are not born, but made. Not un \u2014 I\u2019m not com \u2014\nsaying that I\u2019m a hero, but at least I have seen heroes who became heroes, who were\nplain folk, and \u2014 and I brushed with death very many times. So many times that\nsometimes I worry that I run out of luck eventually.",
        "A: I have to tell you the \u2014 I have to tell you a little story about this. You know\nEinstein was asked the same question. The \u2014 does he feel American, German or\nJewish, and he says \u2014 do you know what his answer was? His answer was, well, as\nlong as my theory of relativity holds up, the Germans will say I\u2019m German, the\n138November 13, 1997\nAmericans will say I\u2014 I am American, and of course the Jews will say \u2019'm Jewish.\nBut if my theory turns out to be incorrect, the Americans will say I\u2019m German and\nthe Germans will say I\u2019m Jewish. So the same way with me, it\u2019s \u2014 I feel that the\ncomponents are there. I am a part \u2014 I have 22 years of me with Hungarian. I have 40\nyears of me with American and I have 63 years of me with Jewish, and they\nsomehow counteract and interact. I \u2014 I think it is \u2014 is sort of a very simp-simplified\nquestion when one asks, who, what is, in what component. I \u2014 I must say, I love\nHungarian literature, and I like Hungarian art and music. I love American literature,\nbut I love a lot of \u2014 lot of other things. And my hobbies, for example are more\nuniversalist than either Hungarian, American or Jewish. But I lo \u2014 but there are\ncomponents of all three, which I love, and then there are things which are associated\nwith neither. For example, I \u2014 I love photography, which is neither Jewish \u2014\nalthough there were many Jewish photographers. Neither Jewish nor Hungarian\nwere \u2014 there were a lot of good Hungarian photographers. Nor American, where\nagain, same \u2014 same thing happens. My interest and philosophy of life, I hope\ntranscends somehow, this compartmentalization.",
        "A: Yeah, I1\u2014I like to go back to the museum, and I like to go back to a\u2014 a concern\nI \u2014 I had and raised and shall raise in the future, and that is about teachers\u2019\n139November 13, 1997\neducation. I believe that the vast majority of the teachers and certainly the students,\nwho will be teaching Holocaust studies and who will be learning Holocaust studies\nwould be Christian. I had had very uneasy few hours, few days in the museum\nabout anti-Semitism. And this is specifically in the Belfer conference this year,\nwhere I was \u2014 where I am \u2014 was looking at the struggle of non-Jewish teachers,\ntrying to teach non-Jewish teachers about the central \u2014 centrality of anti-Semitism\nand church anti-Semitism in the Holocaust. And the difficulties which these\nteachers had with the acceptance of this idea. And I was very concerned because I\nfeel that if these teachers would simply ignore this, you know, wa \u2014 one of the \u2014 one\nof the teachers said well, what happens if e \u2014 we teach it different? And he says,\nwell, you have a moral obligation to teach it this way. Well, that\u2019s nice. I always\nbelieve in moral obligations, but I heard of very spec \u2014 spe-specific and fairly\npractical objections. For example one black teacher got up \u2014 very few black\nteachers participated in this, said hey, I came from Tennessee from the Bible Belt. I\ncannot teach the Baptists that their belt \u2014 their \u2014 their New Testament is wrong. I\ncan\u2019t teach that, you know, I mean if the Jews are right, then they are wrong. How\ndo I do this? And I was really concerned and I am \u2014 [| think that this 1s a great\ncentral concern and should be of the education department to \u2014 to teach the\nHolocaust and the centrality of the a \u2014 of \u2014 of the anti-Semitism in such a way that\n140November 13, 1997\nthe teachers can accept it. I\u2019m not talking sugarcoating. I am talking truth, or I am\ntalking about acceptable ways, so they can teach it. If you teach it without\nacceptable ways, then it won\u2019t be taught. And if it is not taught, then the great point\nof the Holocaust, the great cause of the Holocaust is going to be lost. It\u2019s not\nenough to teach what happened, they must teach why it happened. And they cannot\nshirk from the fact that it largely happened because of the centuries of art \u2014 of anti-\nSemitism. But how do you package it, how do you do this so that the teachers can\nteach it and can accept it themselves? I talked to teachers afterwards, they really are\nstruggling. I mean, they \u2014 they hear their own priests, they have their own beliefs,\nand then they hear this, and they don\u2019t know how to resolve it. I think this needs to\nbe really considered and reconsidered in the museum, and that\u2019s not a small amount\nof work either. That\u2019s my parting shot for this.",
