        "Q: Ok, now we\u2019re starting. Would you tell me your full name please?",
        "A: My full name is Doris Greenberg, and I was born Fuchs.!",
        "Q: What, what year were you born and where?",
        "A: I was born in 19- 1930, in Warsaw, Poland.",
        "Q: Doris, would you tell me about your family and your childhood before the Nazis -- your\nparents, your grandparents? What was life like for a little girl?",
        "A: For me, I thought it was heaven. And we had a large family. My grandparents have -- had\nsix children: three boys and three girls. My mother was the oldest of the children. So, I\nhad five uncles and aunts, and some of them were married. And since my mother was the\noldest, I was treated like the baby, very well. The, the first, the second grandchild in the\nfamily. And, and life was for me marvelous. Summers we spent in a place outside of\nWarsaw. It was called the Line of Otvosk train. On that line were a few villages and\nsometimes my parents would rent a house in one village or another and we would spend\nsummers there so that my parents could come out for the Sabbath for the weekend and\nstay with us, with my sister and I. And, of course, I just recently started school and\neverything was new and everything was rosy. I didn't know there was a worry in the\nworld. Loved school, then went to, to learn how to dance and rhythm in Maccabee.\nEnjoyed life. Wintertime, skating; summertime, bicycle riding -- and that's how I\nremember home. The holidays were spent in my grandparents' house with all the children\naround and, and favorite dishes and favorite cups and very traditional, very traditional,\nand it was just great. It was just great.",
        "Q: Lovely. What happened when the war broke out?",
        "A: Well, when the war broke out -- this was almost the beginning of a school year when the\nwar broke out, and there was approximately three weeks of bombardment before the\nGermans entered Warsaw, and from the rubble I got injured but didn't feel bad. I was\nwith my family and I didn't understand what was happening until, until I heard that\nJewish males are, are running away towards the eastern border and two of my uncles and\nmy father got ready to leave. My father then changed his mind and he stayed to take care\nof the family. They were going to leave, going towards the east, away from the Germans\n' The interviewee notes that this name is spelled \u201cFox\u201d by her relatives living in England.\nand that's when it dawned on me that something is wrong. But the Germans came in and\nimmediate- immediately did not happen anything, like the same week, did not. But in a\nvery short time, things started happening -- for the whole population and not only for\nJews. It was very bad. Orders came out almost daily: \u201cYou mustn't do this, you mustn't\ndo that. You have to give up your radios, your gold, your things. You're not allowed to go\nhere or there.\u201d Everyday something new, for the whole population, and it began being\nreally bad for the Jews. They were singled out. We had to wear armbands, white\narmbands with a blue Star of David to identify ourselves. Jewish stores had to be\nidentified. People who lived in Poland used to use their Jewish name in a, in a Polish\nversion, and this was forbidden. You had to show your real Jewish name for easy\nidentification and, therefore, persecution, beatings, and, and sending -- being sent out to,\n\u201cTo work,\u201d so they said, and just beatings. And then Jews were not allowed to walk on\nthe on the sidewalk, only in the middle of the streets. It became worse and worse daily.",
        "Q: How did it affect you as a little girl?",
        "A: I was...I was all right as long as I was with my family because during this time my\nparents got in touch with a former teacher and they -- the teacher organized a little class\nof children to come to his house and study in exchange for almost anything like some\nfood or clothing for his family. Of course, it was forbidden, and I enjoyed going there.\nWe started off with 10 children, and little by little, the group got smaller as the children\ndied from hunger or were caught and killed. I never knew what happened, just that they\ndidn't show. But this happened: One day when I was on my way to, to the teacher,\nProfessor Rozycki -- oh, we used to come separately so that the Germans or nobody\nwould see that we're forming a group, so each one came within a few minutes of each\nother, and one day I was on my way and a few blocks away somebody stopped me and\nsaid, \u201cAre you going to Professor Rozycki?\u201d and I didn't answer. And they said, \u201cDon't\ngo there.\u201d So I didn't go there, and I waited and it became clear that that very morning the\nGermans came, raided his house, killed all the males in the family. Even his father-in-\nlaw, who was in a wheelchair, was thrown out of the window. I don't remember how I got\nhome, but I think that this was the, the time when my life, when I started realizing as a\nyoung girl what -- that something is happening. I looked around and people were on the\nstreet covered with papers, bodies, near bodies, were crying for bread. I was always fed,\nso I don't remember crying for food, although hunger was a constant companion. But the,\nthe view of the bodies covered with paper, the swollen bodies, was bad. I had more time\nto look around and see it. When I was busy in school, I was busy.\nWe had classes the whole day and then homework, and it kept us busy. But then when\nthis was gone, I could see -- look around me, and I could see everything. I lost my friends\nto hunger. I, I saw people -- bodies -- being taken away in a little carriage, hand carriage,\nand there was nothing that I could do for anybody, nothing. There was a former teacher,\nPani? Kaminska, who was our music teacher in school and she tried to form a, a choir\nunder those circumstances. It was unbelievable how our people tried to keep up the spirit,\nand how people know that when you're learning, when you're \u201cdoing,\u201d you can, you can\nwithstand hardship. May be easier or may be, may be harder, but it enables you to\ncontinue. You don't get necessarily wrapped up in yourself, in your hunger, in you- your\nbeing cold, or whatever. And we tried very hard, but it became impossible. It became\nimpossible. Very soon thereafter we got orders to move: all Jews have to move into\ncertain streets or rather remove themselves from certain streets in, in Warsaw, and there\nwere some streets that were we were allowed to move to and we had to move. We were\nallowed to -- my parents had a store right across the street from our apartment, so in order\nto move fast like we were ordered many -- much of our belongings were put in the store\nand little by little we would carry to the new so-called apartment.\nAnd one day before we knew it, we woke up and the gates of the ghetto were closed,\neverybody trapped. And I didn't realize it then but I did realize that there were so many\npeople walking in. Now I know that it was because we were squeezed into a smaller area\nand also there were people brought in from other places into Warsaw ghetto, and\ntherefore there were so many people and so many hungry and dead and cold people and\nthere was nothing that anybody can do. Now the Germans daily would go out and catch\npeople in the street, take them to what they called the Umschlagplatz\u00b0, put them in trains\nand send them out. As a matter of fact, at the beginning, one of my aunts who had a\nhusband and a son a year older than I was when they saw the advertising that the, the\nGermans put out that anybody who comes on his own to that Umschlagplatz will be\ntreated well and sent to a camp for the duration of the war. My aunt packed for them their\nbelongings and -- like bags -- and she got them there without knowing where they were\ngoing. Never saw them again and after a while we started hearing that that those people\nare not being sent to work. And you know, nobody wanted to believe. People\nwere...started jumping off trains if they could. Whether they get shot or not, they tried.\nAnd more and more we started hearing that that people are being brought to camps and\nnever heard from afterwards. To me, it was unbelievable. Nobody told me anything, but I\ncould hear the adults talking among themselves. So it became worse and worse and then\nafter they caught everybody in the streets, they started clearing out building by building.\nThey made unannounced visits and called everybody to come down and be marched\naway. They also organized some factories. I remember I -- I was in one. I always looked\nolder than I was and somehow my aunt, my aunt, my uncle, they took me along and I\nworked. This was after they took my parents away.\n* Mrs. (Polish).\n> The deportation area that separated the ghetto from surrounding Poland (German).",
        "Q: Back up a little bit and tell us what happened to your parents.",
        "A: Well, my parents...my parents perished separately. They -- when the Germans organized\nfactories, everybody had to register and go to work, which they did, but then one day they\nmarched off everybody from the factory and that's how my father got caught. He went to\nwork, never came back. The whole group was marched to Umschlagplatz and sent away.\nMy mom, she went out one morning to see if she could exchange some clothes for some\nfood for the family and she got caught on the street and sent to Umschlagplatz. Never\nsaw her again. Now, my older sister -- we, we then had to move again twice after, after\nthat. And at that time, my older sister and I, we went with, with my grandmother, my\naunt, and my aunt's little boy. We were living in Muranowska, and one day when the\nGermans came in to look for us, we had, we had hiding places. We had -- well, I have to\ngo back and describe the hiding place. In this building, like in many buildings in Warsaw,\nthe outside walls are very thick and there was no refrigeration at that time, so usually\nunderneath a window there would be a little cabinet that served as a refrigerator. The\nbuildings were made of stone and therefore keeping things cool and the walls are very\nwide. We were, we were in such a building and at the time my grandmother, my aunt and\nher little boy would sit right underneath in the, in the little cabinet underneath the\nwindow, and I put a chair in front of it so nobody notices there is a door. Then there was\na folding bed that folded up to look like a table with a mattress inside and my sister went\ninside, and I folded the bed and I threw something over it so that she cannot be noticed.\nAnd I went -- I was supposed to go upstairs to the attic and hide in the attic, but by the\ntime all that was done there was no time to go to the attic, so I went to the little bathroom\nwhich had a shelf. Where I sit now across was a shelf, up high, and on the wall that they\nhad a ladder standing there for whatever reason. I jumped on top of the shelf in the\nbathroom and there was the bulb, the light. I quietly unscrewed the bulb and I made sure\nthat my clothes don't show down and I sat there quietly. Well, the Germans came in and\nthey found my sister....So that's how I lost my parents and my sister.",
        "Q: What did you do when the Germans left? They had taken your sister?",
        "A: Yes. We, we heard some shots and, and, see, my aunt and my grandmother could see\nthrough a little ventilator that was in the wall, but they didn't tell me anything, but I heard\nfrom neighbors that they have shot my sister, but I don't know for sure. Over the years\nI've been trying to find her. You know, just, just the possibility...right? Nobody told me\nfor sure. So that's how I lost them.",
        "Q: What happened after that incident? Where did you go? What did you do?",
        "A: Well, I had, I had, I have an uncle who was married and -- to a Polish lady, and she was\nwith him in the ghetto all the time. They lost a son to, to illness and my other uncle\ntogether with his brother decided -- and my aunt -- they decided that something has to be\ndone and we have to leave, so they went out and they found an apartment somewhere,\nvery inexpensive with one bedroom and, first, her husband, my aunt's husband, my uncle,\ncame out to live in that apartment.",
        "Q: Excuse me -- you're saying they found an apartment outside the ghetto.",
        "A: Outside of the ghetto, oh, yes.",
        "Q: How -- can you explain how did they find it? They were not allowed to go out.",
        "A: Well, they smuggled themselves out with a group of people that was going to work, to\nlabor. There were factories -- there were places where, outside of the ghetto, where Jews\nwere marched to every morning and brought back to the ghetto every night, and they\nworked there, and you could apparently -- I wouldn't know how, but apparently you\ncould. I heard that you could sometimes find either a nice or a greedy soldier who was\nwatching and for some money would let somebody out. I haven't witnessed it that but just\nheard. I know that my uncle would go out with a group of people. They were going to, to\na factory that used to belong to a family person like a cousin or of, of the family's who\nhad a factory of, of electric chandeliers, and the Germans took it over, and I think that\nthey kept him as a manager or something, or as a foreman, and groups were coming in to\nwork. They probably switched their chandeliers. They didn't do chandeliers, only did\nother things in there, but it was still something. So the groups were coming 1n and out and\nhe could go out, smuggle himself out and then two brothers and one brother's wife. My\nuncle Janek with his wife Zosia; my uncle Mietek, who was single, and my Aunt Zosia\nhad brothers there who apparently helped them find an apartment and it was all in Aunt\nZosia's name. That's why it was a small apartment, and they made a double wall over\nthere. In the little bedroom they made a double wall and that's where later on my\ngrandmother went out this way into that apartment. My uncle came to pick them up, and\nthen my aunt went, and...with a baby, little Jakov, who was born in May of '39 just before\nthe war started. And little by little, whoever was left -- my grandmother, my aunt, my\nother aunt, two uncles, and I was left and my Aunt Tecia, the one who sent her husband\nand son on the on the trip, well, she was a nurse and a very good nurse, and my uncle\ncame to take her out, and she refused to go. Apparently, she knew there were rumors,\nmust have been rumors about the, the revol- the revolt, and as a nurse she wanted to be\nthere and besides by that time she realized that her husband and son are dead, so she did\nnot want to leave. Anyway, it was decided that I go out, so my uncle took me out.",
        "Q: Can you describe to me what Warsaw was like at that point?",
        "A: Oh, when, when I left the Warsaw ghetto, there were still some buildings there staying,\nstanding. The, the ghetto was, was -- there was very few people -- not, not more people.\nMost people were either in the factories or gone from the factories, and on the street you\ndidn't see anybody. You couldn't. When, when I left Warsaw a year later to go to camp,\nthat's when Warsaw looked terrible, all burned out. But when I left ghetto it was still\nstanding and the revolt started and after it was finished, I took a -- when I was outside I\nwas able to, to ride in a tram, tramway around the walls and I saw it burning, and I saw\nthe airplane coming and bombing it, and I saw it all burning, and I couldn't even shed a\ntear. You become so strong. I never thought about it, but you become so strong. The, the\nsurvival \u2014 the urge to survive becomes number one priority, and I just looked at it and my\nthought was that I mustn't cry because other people will see me. Unreal, but true.",
        "Q: Let us go back. Now you're still in the Warsaw ghetto.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Tell us about when you were smuggled out and describe it, please.",
        "A: Oh...",
        "Q: What year and months are we in, about?",
        "A: Ok, the approximate time I can know, because my birthday was in March and I remember\nwhen my uncle told me the story how it was decided that I come out of the ghetto. It\nseems my uncle spoke to his wife, Zosia, and he told her that it's my birthday and I'm a\nyoung child and so on, and an invitation was issued for me to come out. So my other\nuncle, his brother, Uncle Mietek, he came back into the ghetto and he is the one who took\nme out. We went with a group of workers, night shift. And we marched, marched\ntogether and we were marched through the streets to that factory on....I think 1t was on\nGrzybowska Street...that factory that belonged to, to this relative of ours. I even\nremembered his name but I can't recall it on the spot -- Gruszkiewicz, Gruszkiewicz.\nWell, we -- finally, the whole group went in into the big door or gate and in front 1t was\nempty only you had to go through a -- well, it is like, like the building is all around and,\nand is...in the center is empty. So they had to go to the other side and the workers walked\nthrough this gate into the factory. My uncle and I went into the staircase on the side of the\nfront which was empty, and I remember we sat there quietly the whole night. It was very\ncold. It was sometime in March. It was very cold.\nWe sat there the whole night because of the curfew and in the morning we carefully, very\ncarefully made our way to the apartment of my aunt and uncle. We were stopped on the\nway by somebody who wanted money who felt he recognized us. My uncle took care of\nit. | was just numb. I was just numb. But we finally reached the, the apartment there and I\nsaw my grandmother and my aunt and at that time my little cousin was not there anymore\nbecause they found a place for him with a Polish woman whom, whom -- who was paid,\nand she was also very, very good. She took care of him. He was like three years old, three\nand a half. And it was quite, quite a risk to take a little boy of three and a half. And she\ntook the risk so she, she took care of the little boy in her room. She only lived in one\nroom. Everything together -- the kitchen, and was, was a little stove there. That's all. And\nshe took care of him. And she was not rich. She was something. So when I got to that\napartment, I saw my uncle, my two aunts, my grandmother, and I must say that that I felt\nkind of safe. Little did I know that...that we weren't safe at all, but that's how I felt.",
        "Q: How did you live in that apartment for the next two weeks?",
        "A: Oh, we didn't, we didn't stay there too long. As I said I felt safe but it was not very safe\nbecause in a very little time, soon after we got there, after the curfew there was a knock\non the door and some agents came in. They spoke Polish. They must have been German\nagents that knew Polish. You know, there were some people there they call themselves\nVolksdeutche,* but they, they spoke Polish very well. I don't know who they were. They\nwere civilians, but I remember they wore boots, high boots. They came in and they\nlooked and they found a little trap door and they got us all out. Oh, yeah. So, it wasn't that\nsafe as I thought.",
        "Q: What did they do with you?",
        "A: Well, they wanted to take us to, to the authorities. My Aunt Zosia, she begged them and,\nand she did everything she could and they would talk only to her. They wouldn't talk to\nanybody else, and whatever possessions there were, they took it all in exchange for an\nagreement that in the morning right after curfew lets off, we'll all disperse, and they don't\nwant to see us anymore. So that's what happened. We just had to leave. And from that\ntime, each, each of us had a different story to tell. Well, Adolph (ph), my Aunt Zosia, and\nUncle Janek -- they both survived. My uncle Janek lives in Warsaw. He\u2019s marvelous,\nhe\u2019s marvelous. Aunt Zosia died two years ago, I think. I went to visit when she was still\nalive. My grandmother didn't survive. She committed suicide in a bathtub, in a public, in\na public bath- bath house, after she heard that her son, Uncle Mietek was killed and that\nhappened while I was watching. So --",
        "Q: You -- excuse me. You were watching? Tell me what happened.\n* Ethnic Germans (German).",
        "A: Well, after we were all dispersed, we had some, we had to find some place to stay and\nAunt Zosia took care of Aunt -- Janek, her husband. Uncle Mietek, he tried to take care\nof, of his sister Esther and the little boy who was with this lady, Olga, Olga her name, and\n-- and there was another young fellow whom my Uncle Mietek rescued. I forgot his name\nbut he was 17 years old\u00b0. And at that time he found through, through some acquaintances\nfrom before the war. They\u2019re were some people that that knew us. Through them he\nfound a lady with two daughters, grown daughters, and she \u2014 for, for payment, she\ndecided to take us in. Her name was Jadwiga Rzempoluch. Can't remember the address,\nand she took me in. I was, I was there doing practically nothing, but one of the daughters\nhad a baby, so I would play with the baby and the whole family smoked so I was making\nthe, the cigarettes with the machine -- papierosnica\u00ae -- they used to have. And then one\nday, then one day when it became a little warmer, they decided that it's going to be very\ngood and safe to go to their summer place. They had a summer place in Struga which was\non another narrow train line. There were regular trains and the ones, the short distance\nones, and this was on the line of Radzymin, and there was a little place Struga where they\nhad a, a place and they decided to go there and we went there. There was, besides Mrs.\nRzempoluch and her two daughters, one of whom was blond and one of whom was dark\nhaired and brown eyed. The blond young lady had a baby. The, the other one was single.\nThen my Uncle Mietek, the young 17 year old boy and I, we all went out to Struga for\nsummer to enjoy the summer vacation.\nAnd it was beautiful. We had a nice evening, and we went to bed and early in the\nmorning we were surrounded by Germans who knocked on the doors, woke us up and\nthey demanded two Jew -- two Jewish men and a Jewish woman. Somebody must have\ntold them, and at that time they took out the young fellow, the 17 year old boy...18. They\nbeat him, they beat him. They, they broke all his limbs before they shot him dead. My\nUncle Mietek, he had, he had some good documents, probably false, I don't know;\nsomething that was called good documents. They didn't beat him. They just told him to\ntake a handkerchief and put in front of his face and walk away. And the Germans were\ntarget shooting to shoot out his brains through the handkerchief and they did. They did.\nSo they couldn't find the woman because I was there. They thought, they thought it was\nthe dark haired daughter of Pani Rzempoluch, but she worked for, for the chocolate firm\nWedl and had very good documents and they checked on it and it wasn't her. They didn't\nknow, they didn't question me. Finally they took me as a hostage to Radzymin to the\npolice station to find out what happened to the Jewish woman or Jewish female or\nwhatever. That's how my uncle died.\n> The interviewee later noted that the man\u2019s name was Kutner.\n\u00b0 Cigarette case (Polish).",
        "Q: What happened to you then? They...did the police let you go?",
        "A: Well, I was there I think two days and they kept questioning me. I was, what, about 14?\nThey kept questioning me, and I told them that I was from, from the eastern Poland\nwhere the Russians are so that nobody can check and then they came, came out with a\nmap to show where, where it is. I said I don't know how to read a map. See --",
        "Q: You had false papers?",
        "A: I originally had but they were stolen out of my pocket one day and I didn't have -- so told\nthem I don't know how to read a map. On the third day they took me across the street\nfrom the police station to a bar, two of them, Polish policemen, and they ordered vodka\nand I thought that -- I, I didn't tell them anything. Whatever they ask me, I said, \u201cI don't\nknow.\u201d I didn't know anything. I was just there as a maid and I'm from the eastern part. I,\nI had a name for this little town, and that's all I know. Well, they ordered vodka. I, I had\nonly one shot with them, and then afterwards when they drank and I tried to -- I spilled it\nall. I, I didn't know what to do. They asked again, but then I heard this little whistle of the\ntrain and Radzymin was the last stop of the train so 1t would only go back to Warsaw. It\nwas running between Warsaw and Radzymin. I heard the whistle and I got up to see at\nthe door of the bar, the was door, and the two policemen looked. I didn't say anything. I\nopened the door and I ran as quickly as I could and, and I jumped in into the train as it\nstarted moving, yeah. I don't know if I could have any guts to do that nowadays. I\nprobably couldn't run either, but that's what happened and, and I had to hide out from the\nconductor because I had no money for ticket and the train arrived to Warsaw. Was close\nto curfew time, and I had no place to go, but, I got into a, a house and into a staircase and\nspent the night there, yeah.",
        "Q: What happened the next morning?",
        "A: Oh, the time -- the days were like nights and nights like days. It's really hard to, to say,\n\u201cThe next morning...\u201d or \u201cThe next day...\u201d or whatever, but what happened 1s that I went\nback to the area where my parents and I used to live and I tried to find some friends. My\nparents had a lot of friends and my grandparents, my grandmother, my uncles, aunts --\nthey were living there all their lives. They had a lot of friends. I went to a lady who was,\nwho used to come and talk to my mother for hours and hours and I thought they were\nvery good friends. Pani Adamowska, I went to her and she, she was afraid. She was glad\nto see me and she told me that she's happy that I'm alive, but she was really afraid. And I\nwent to other places but couldn't find a place. Spent a couple of nights on, on staircases\nand, and I went to visit Pani Ola who had little Jakov, and she treated me so well. She\ndid. What a person. I would feel that Pani Adamowska, who was educated and friend,\nthat she would be the one. Instead Pani Ola who was really plain nice, nice person -- she\ndid. She let me spend the night on the floor, she gave me something to eat, and she told\nme that there was a job open on this same line Otvosk, which I mentioned at the\nbeginning that our family used to spend summers between Warsaw and Otvosk.\nOn this same line in a little village somebody was looking for a maid and I went there and\nI got hired. Yeah. That that solved a lot of problems. And I worked there for a while and I\nwas able to once a week bring some potatoes or bread to Pani Ola who had little Jakov,\nwho, who was named then Jacek. Jacek is now an engineer at a doctorate from, from\nHaifa Technion. He's also -- how do you say? He teaches, let's put it this way.\nOccasionally gives lectures, that's what I wanted to say. He lectures occasionally and he\nhas three beautiful daughters and one granddaughter, and that was my, that's my little\ncousin. So he spent the war with Pani Ola. His mother also had a story. My Aunt Esther,\na story all by its --everybody has a story.",
        "Q: What happened to you though? You were now working, staying with Pani Ola and\nworking as a maid.",
        "A: I was working as a maid. I was on the horse (ph). I was able to, to bring somethings to\nPani Ola, food. I would -- when I peeled potatoes, I was allowed to take the peels and I\nwould go to Warsaw to a German kitchen, give them the peels and they would give me\nbread. And then I think that they fed the peels to, to some animals. So anyway I was\nbringing some potatoes, bread, milk, I was looking after the, the goats. I was able to do\nthat, and then while be -- while I was with, with, at Ola's, spending a few nights, I met a\nperson who from that day on played a big role in my life. She came from, from Lvov. She\nlost a husband and a child. Actually she lost a child. She didn't know where her husband\nwas. And she came to Warsaw and somebody told her to go to Pani Ola. I don't know\nhow she got there, but I met her there.",
        "Q: What was her name?",
        "A: Pepi. Her name was Pepi. But I didn't know that because at the time she had false papers\nand her name was Emilia Boszko. I met her at Ola's, and I had a job. And then in, in that\nsmall village near Miedzeszyn there was a nursery school, kindergarten and somebody\ntold me that there was an opening there. And I told Pepi that there's an opening and she\nwent and she got the job. It was very, very hard. She did everything but she had a place\nto, to sleep and she got the job. And then she read in the paper or she found out that in\nWarsaw, in a suburb of Warsaw, Zoliborz, was an opening for a cook in a restaurant and\nshe went and she got the job as a cook. Meanwhile, where I was, was getting a little\nuncomfortable because when I went to the priest on Sunday, he, he looked at me funny.\nHe gave me a, a pocketful of nuts and candy and he told me that there was one God for\neverybody. He was fantastic.",
        "Q: All right. I'm going to go ahead.",
        "A: And one day he sent a message to me that I should go to another town for a couple of\nhours, and there was a raid, so I knew he was a friend. Well, I probably will tell you just\nthat I became a cook's helper in Warsaw in Zoliborz.",
        "Q: Ok, I want to pause, stop. We need to change tapes at this point and then we'll go back,\nEnd of Tape #1\nTape #2\n[Technical Conversation]",
        "Q: All right. We, you had mentioned a priest. Can you tell us how you came to know a\npriest? You were in Pruszkow still, right?",
        "A: No, Pruszkow --",
        "Q: Where are you now?",
        "A: In Warsaw and around Warsaw, in Michalen, in Miedzeszyn, in Zoliborz. We were\ntalking about that. When I first got to got to know and went to church, was there in\nWarsaw.",
        "Q: This is before you were smuggled out?",
        "A: No, no. After.",
        "Q: This is after?",
        "A: After, right. I, I had originally -- my Uncle Mietek had arranged for false identification\npapers which I think I mentioned before they were stolen out of my pocket together with\nthe r\u00e9zaniec,\u2019 which are the pray, the beads that you pray. And it was stolen out of my\npocket in a tramway in Warsaw, and I had no documentation. I couldn't get a job\nanywhere because wherever I went they wanted documents and -- or my original false\ndocuments said that I came from a little village near the Russian border and I kept up\nwith it, and my name was Krystyna Maria Kalnowska. And it continued to be that way,\nbut when my documents were stolen and I couldn't get a job, I went to the authorities --\noh, yes. I went to the authorities and they were in front. There were Polish policemen and\nthere were Germans all over the place and although I studied German I did not tell\nanybody I knew, but I came up to a Polish policeman and I told him that I don't have any\ndocuments. I can't get a job because everybody thinks I'm Jewish without papers. I need\nsome documents, at which point the policeman brought me to an office and they asked\nme for a few zloty to pay for the document, and I said I had no money. A few policemen\ngot them together and paid I think six zloty or whatever.\n\u2019 Rosary (Polish).\nI didn't have any money and I needed the documents and, and I got a real good document\nso I could get a job with it and that's how I got it. Oh, I met a lot of good people. I have\ntrust in people. You see, when we're talking about the Nazi era, that's one thing. But\nwhen we're talking about people, now that's another thing. People are good. And I found\nlots of goodness in people, everywhere I went. It doesn't \u2014 it, it made no difference\nwhether they were, what their religion was, their nationality, I find good people. Maybe\nI'm lucky but that's what I see. Like the documents. And I felt that at one point that\nreligion is religion, and we play pray to God and at the same time it's also safe to go\nSunday to church, and I thought to myself that I'm gonna to pray to God. I don't have to\nname God. Whatever it 1s, I'm gonna to pray, and I went to church. This was -- the only\nthing I had were churches. I went to church and I prayed. I didn't know how. I picked up\na book and I read and I did what other people did, and pretty soon I was pretty good. And\nthis priest I mentioned before in that little town, as I said, I used to go Sunday to church\nand then in a little town you stop and talk and he talked to me, and I was not very\nconvincing. I didn't try to be convincing. I was talking to a priest. I was more open than,\nthan with anybody on the street except I didn't give myself away willingly. I didn't state\nwho I was, but he figured out and he also put some nuts in my pocket for Sunday, and\ncandy. But he told me that I could get a better job or whatever and I didn't pay attention. I\nneeded that one. But one day I got really sick, very sick. I broke out in, 1n skin rashes and\nthat's because I was taking care of a pig and of a goat, billy goat, and cleaning out all that.\nI only owned one flannel yellow shirt which at daytime I put a piece of string around, was\na dress, and at night it was a nightgown. And once when I wanted to wash it, I froze. I\ndidn't have it. And my bed was in the kitchen and, on this side of the wall. The other side\nof the wall was the pig sty. And from this I got all kinds of rashes. I didn't go to the\ndoctor of course, but I told the priest. I think that gave me away. He said, \u201cDid you grow\nup on a farm?\u201d And I said [nodding head \u201cyes\u2019\u2019]. \u201cWell,\u201d he says, \u201cyou belong -- you,\nyou don't belong on a farm.\u201d And, and he told me to go to the pharmacy and buy\ncalamine lotion or whatever it was, and I did. And this is the same priest who one day\nsent word that I ought to go to another town for a while. And I knew that he, he knows\nthat somebody must have said something or suspect and if there was a suspicion they\nwould come and check it out. So I walked to Warsaw, stayed at Ola's for the night and\neverything went ok, but I couldn't stay there much longer. Also my friend Pepi was in\nWarsaw, in Zoliborz, and -- where I went to visit with her, she told me there is an\nopening for an assistant cook, but there was no place to, to stay. She had a bed in the in\nthe room behind the kitchen. She's willing to share it with me, and I did that. I went to, to\nher in Zoliborz and helped her in the kitchen of a restaurant. We were there, oh, couple of\nmonths when the Polish revolt started in '44, and I remember that day. That was a tough\nday.\nIt is all, it is all together, comes together with my aunt and her son Jacek, who was with\nOla. It happened to be my day off, and I went to my aunt and she was at that time on the\nother side of River Vistula. They call it now Vistula but it's Wisla, really, on -- in Praga.\nIt's not Prague, Czechoslovakia. It's the part of Warsaw that's called Praga. She was there\nas a maid and I helped her arrange it. And another good soul, another gorgeous person\ndid it for me. It cost money, yes. Whatever I earned in the restaurant as that helper's cook\nand Pepi's salary went for it be --",
        "Q: Went for what?",
        "A: He, a friend of my parents' who was working as a tram driver, conductor on the tram. I\nmet him on the street one day and he wanted to help me. And I told him that I need a\nplace for my aunt to stay, and some documents, and he arranged it. His name I never\nforget because I was looking for him for many years. I wanted to thank him. I don't know\nif he's alive. Stefan Mningoc, Stefan Mningoc. I get goose bumps when I think about it.\nHe had a sister who lived in Praga with a husband and some children, I don't remember\nhow many. And the husband declared himself Volksdeutche. Means that he gets all the\nprivileges, and of course with the privileges becomes the possibility to hire a maid. Now\nthis Stefan went to his sister after he arranged for my aunt a document saying that she's\nNatalia, forgot the last name. I'll remember it probably. Natalia, he arranged for her the\ndocuments. He went to his sister and he told her a story. He told her that Natalia is a\nwidow of a fellow officer in the Polish army and she willing to be the governess for the\nchildren and whatever because she is now a widow. He told his own sister that and he\nknew that people were, were, were killed if they tried to help Jews and yet he did that for\nmy aunt. He told me it was for my parents and for my sister that he's doing that.\nAnd she wo- she worked there as a maid and on that day when, when the Polish revolt\nstarted. I had a day off, and I went to visit her across, walked across the bridge and she\nhad given me a sweater which she knitted for her son, little Jakov -- little Jacek -- and she\n-- and IJ -- said \u201cYes, I'm going there.\u201d She says, \u201cWould you take it to my son?\u201d And I\ntook the sweater and I visited with her first and I took the sweater, and I went back to the\nbridge to visit Ola with my little cousin and brought the sweater. And then I went back to\nZoliborz to the restaurant where I was, and as I came back the shots started. And the, the\nPolish revolt started. It was '44. I think October 1, if I'm not mistaken. I hadn't seen them\nuntil after the war because --",
        "Q: By \u201cthem,\u201d you mean your aunt --",
        "A: My aunt or my cousin, her son. You wanted to know how about my grandmother, I think\nyou asked. Oh, no. I did say -- I did tell you that she committed suicide when she found\nout that my Uncle Miatek was killed.",
        "Q: I'd like to go back now. You're talking about the beginning of the Polish revolt in 1944.\nCan you tell me what that day was like?",
        "A: Well, I can tell you what it was for me.",
        "Q: Of course.",
        "A: It was a day that I had the time off and I went to visit my aunt and my cousin and came\nback in quite a good mood because I saw them. They were safe. They were alive. I gave\nthem, each one of them, regards so I was kind of a contact. They were not seeing each\nother. So the mood was elated and I came back to Zoliborz, to the restaurant and I told\nPepi all about it. Of course, we had to communicate very discreetly because the owners\nof the restaurant couldn't find out that we know each other from before or who we are. So\nthe -- that day was good. When the shots started, I didn't know what it was all about but\nthis Stefan who arranged for my aunt to stay with his sister, he came in that day to the\nrestaurant, and he said that there 1s a revolt going and he's 1n it and he won't see me for a\nwhile. I never saw him since. Never again. And the first day was, was pretty good for me.\nBut then of course the shooting started. I have to explain that when you are with other\npeople and they are shooting buildings with the Krajowa\u00ae from across the river, you're\nscared, but you feel that you're in the same co-- position with all other people and that\nthere is a war going on. One never suggests that that when there is a political war that\nsomebody wants to hurt civilians. But, sure, civilians do get hurt, so it was not bad --\nespecially when we heard after a while that the Russians are in Praga, across the river,\nand we thought any minute they'll come in. Somebody will come in to stop the shooting.\nSomebody would free so that we don't have the shooting and, and nobody dies.\nWell, it didn't happen that way because the Russians stopped there. They didn't cross the\nriver. The, the revolt took two months and then we were all captured and led through the\ncity of Warsaw to the train that took us to Pruszkow, and at the time the city of Warsaw\nwas very, very bad. We could smell the smoldering the, the, the fires but they were\nalmost burned out. Mainly, we saw skeletons of homes, of houses. We walked in the\nmiddle of the road because there was a lot of debris and we were walked to the train and\nat that time from Warsaw to Pruszkow. We went in cattle trains, but locked not closed.\nThey were halfway open. Nobody thought of jumping or, or running away. Pepi and I, we\nlooked at each other: \u201cAre we going or are we not?\u201d I -- she said, \u201cLet's wait a while and\nsee what happens.\u201d Little did I know that she had, she had poison that she carried with\nher and she kept it for the last minute, if necessary. I found that out when we got to\nRavensbruek and we stayed in line to go into the bath house and she asked me while we\n\u00ae Armia Krajowa [Home Army] (Polish).\nwere staying in line if, if I think that, is it time or not yet? And I said, \u201cOh, let's wait and\nsee,\u2019 and by the time we got in and we were ordered to strip and give everything away,\nshe didn't have it anymore.",
        "Q: Could you tell me about the arrival in Ravensbruek, please?",
        "A: Oh, yes.",
        "Q: And could you repeat the word \u201cRavensbruek\u201d so it\u2019s on the tape?",
        "A: Yeah, well, in Pruszkow we were put on trains, and these were cattle trains, all closed,\nlocked with tiny little window and we were taken -- I don't know if it was 10 days, two\nweeks, 12 days -- it was day after day after day and night after night. We were taken and\nwe stopped on the railroad, on side roads. Many times there was an air attack and the\ntrain had to stop. We had reached one camp near, near Berlin. I forgot the name of the\ncamp. that rumors were we were going to stay there and then we didn't stay there and\nagain with the train until we reached Ravensbruek, yeah. Of course, the conditions were\nterrible, you know. Hardly anything, but we made it, and in Ravensbruek we stayed in\nline. We were political prisoners. We were not Jews. We were political prisoners and we\nwere standing in line registering our names and given out numbers. We were asked age\nand, of course, they looked us over and I said that I was 18. I was lying about my name\nso I was also lying about my age. I wanted to be with Pepi. Pepi I think was in her 30s.\nSo I got a number and there was a red triangle made of cloth with the letter \u201cP\u201d on it for\npolitical prisoner. The red was for political prisoner and on a white cloth was my number,\n74073. And she was 704 -- 4074. I don't remember whether it was, she was first or I was\nfirst. I think I was first, and we got consecutive numbers and from then on we had no\nnames, just numbers, and then we went to the bath house. We -- as I said they took away\nour clothes.\nWe had to strip. Everybody was shaved. I don't know by what miracle Pepi and I were\nnot shaved. Until today I have no answer. Somebody told me that the majority of people\nhad lice. I don't believe it because this is not why you were shaved but they did not shave\nher. They did not shave me. They left my long hair and when we went to the baths, we\nreally expected to die. We really did, and we said, \u201cWell, we could have taken the poison\nbut it's gone and it probably won't take longer with being gassed.\u201d Well, we were very\nsurprised when water came. And we, we really got a shower. There was even this gray\nsoap that looked like pumice stone but a little softer. But 1t was not gas, so we took the\nshowers and we went out on the other end of the building and we were given the striped\nuniforms and then I understood why we wanted to take the poison before we went in\nbecause each group that went in ahead of us, we never saw them coming out. We didn't\nrecognize them. They were shaved and wearing stripes. So then when we got stripes and\nwere getting sizes that are impossible, a big person would get a tiny dress, a tiny, tiny\nperson would get a big dress, but we came out alive and we had our numbers and a\ntriangle and we were assigned to barracks. When we came into the barracks, we saw on\nthe wall Jewish writing, names, messages, many of it in Yiddish which I couldn't read,\nbut Pepi could and she told me they were names. She read them to me and I, I could\nunderstand. I just couldn't read or write, and she told me there were messages, very, very\nheartbreaking messages and names of the people: \u201cWe...we were here. We\u2019re the last.\nTell others to remember us.\u201d It, it was very sad, but we were ushered to those barracks\nand we were not killed. We, we had these straw mattresses, three in a row high and we\nstayed there until they sent us to another camp.",
        "Q: Ravens- how long were you in Ravensbruek?",
        "A: Well, I have to figure 1t out. We went to Ravensbruek at the last day of the Polish revolt\nwhich was October, November, and in Ravensbruek we must have been, December,\nDecember, January, and then we were, we were sent to a camp in a forest Wildbou near\nBrandenburg.",
        "Q: Let's stay in, in Ravensbruek. You were there for more than a few days, which is the only\nthing --",
        "A: Yes, but a short time and then I was staying longer in the other camp, in the in the forest.",
        "Q: Can you tell me a little more about what Ravensbruek was like?",
        "A: Ravensbruek was a very huge camp and there were inmates from many, many nations. In\nthe short stay I could notice truck-fulls of bodies -- how skinny, just bones and skin,\nbodies, dead bodies. They had, they had a place where they hung people. I did not\nwitness any, any hangings but they, they had a place and I could see the trucks going\nback and forth with bodies here and bodies there. We did not do much over there. We\nwere then transported to another camp. And that was in a forest and it was a smaller\ncamp, and we were building this railroad tracks for, for a narrow or a short distance train.\nIt was very cold. We were marched every morning, after what we call Apell\u2019 time. We\nwere marched to work. Were putting the, the railroad tracks and the ties and while we\nwere doing that, while we were marching, we were guarded by SS people, men and\nwomen with dogs and when we got there they would, we would make a fire so they could\nstay and keep warm while we were working and worked. Towards the evenings, we were\ncoming back and we would get watery soup, or water, whatever. In that camp was really\nbad.\n? Roll call (German).\nThe, the, the SS men and the SS women, they were beating everybody they could see and\nthe, the terrain was wet. They would put people face down and, and just stomp on them\nand beat them. I saw once thing like that. After this railroad thing, one day I was\ntransferred to another barr- to a barrack where they had a factory and they told me they\nare parts for airplanes, but all I saw was little screws or little small items that you had to\npunch holes in and they told us how to do it, so I immediately asked if my mother could\ncome, too. It was really not safe to do that, but I did and they said, \u201cYes,\u201d so Pepi and I\nwere brought, worked in that factory and she was working there testing. You have to test\nif they are good or bad, and most of them were bad, really, but we had to, we had to\nproduce something because the foreman tried to be nice to, to us, not to beat us or\nanything, and we all tried to back him up and he had some quota to fulfill. If there is so\nand so much bad output, then he would be punished, so I remember Pepi was telling me\nthat she was checking and she was saying, \u201cMake good ones, make bad ones, whatever.\u201d\nAnd we worked there 12 hours a day.",
        "Q: You said you had convinced the guards to let you bring your mother. You were\npretending --",
        "A: Not the guards, the, the, the managers of it, yeah.",
        "Q: You pretended that Pepi was your mother?",
        "A: Yes, yes. It so happened that during all this time that I met Pepi, she tried to protect me\nand I tried to protect her. She lost her own child and apparently she felt she wanted to\nhelp. She, she was an outstanding person. To describe her, I probably couldn't. That's\nhow good she was, and for everybody to everybody -- to humanity. On my side, she, she\nhad dark hair, brown eyes, and she looked Jewish. I don't know what it means to look\nJewish but that's what the stereotype is, look Jewish. On the other hand, I didn't very\nmuch. And I felt that in this respect if I say she's my mother, she will gain from it. I could\nhave made a mistake. I don't know. I think this was behind my thinking and it worked\nsomehow. So we were there, and, and being together with somebody you care for was\nexcellent. At the evening, Pepi would teach me history, math, and she would talk to me\nabout her husband, who might be alive. By the way, she found him after the war. He\nsurvived, yes. And Pepi was teaching me a lot. We, we didn't have a piece of paper or a\npencil, but she would teach me a French song or geography, explaining things. It helped a\nlot. It helped a lot. I, I felt real good, and when you when you feel good, you're with\nsomebody, you care for somebody, it makes you feel good; and Pepi cared for everybody,\nPepi cared for everybody. One day I saw Pepi doesn't eat her portion of bread and I said,\n\u201cWhat you -- ?\u201d She says, \u201cI was hungry. I ate already.\u201d No she didn't. There was a Pani\nArova who was very, very sick. A wife of a Polish major who we knew from Zoliborz,\nwhere we worked in the restaurant. I think she lived in the same apart- building. Pepi\nfound her and since she was elderly, Pepi gave her her portion of bread, but she wouldn't\ntell me about it, and sure enough when I found out I said, \u201cThen we'll share mine,\u201d and\nshe said \u201cNo, you're a young child. You have to survive.\u201d I mean, I had problems with,\nwith this that she would give away everything to everybody.\nShe was just fantastic. What a human being. I'm not the only one who, who gained by her\nbeing around, who gained so much of everything, of understanding, of love, of helping\nothers. She was just fantastic. So then we were in the camp and we heard some rumors\nthat the war is coming closer. But we didn't know anything. This foreman apparently he\nalso felt that Pepi was a nice and a good person, a worthwhile. He somehow let her know\nthat things are going better for us. In other words, things are not going so good for the\nGermans, and at one time he gave her a piece of paper and a pencil so that she could\nteach me something. She wanted to teach me something to write and, and he, he did that,\nbut we had to give it back right away, so we knew that something is, 1s happening, but we\ndidn't know what. And, and the hope was really making us imagine better things, so one\nday -- it must have been again in March or April, in March, I think, March of '45 -- they\nput us in trains and they sent us to so-called \u201cFree work.\u201d Each one was assigned to some\ndeserving German family or on a farm to work and this, Pepi and I we were assigned to\ntwo villages not far from each other in the northern part of Germany near Rostock. I was\nin Kulingsborn, and she was in Bornhagen. And we were there until May, I think, 5. We\nwere liberated by the Russians, who didn't believe that we did not cooperate with the\nGermans. It, it was hard for them to understand because we were working here on, for a\nfamily or for a farmer so they, they just didn't believe that about a month or six weeks\nago we were taken out of, of concentration camps and, and put there for whatever reason,\nI don't know. And that's where we, we were liberated.",
        "Q: What did you do? What happened to you?",
        "A: Well, Pepi made out. Pepi made out little, called a little -- a travel document, in Russian,\nand she put some stamps, different colors rubber stamps that mean nothing in German or\nwhatever, whatever she could find in the farmer's, in the farmer's place and the, the\nRussian that occupied the farm that she was, they stayed there. They made it a\nheadquarters, and in a couple of days I came running to her because where I was, was\nterrible, so I stayed with her and she made out those papers and she told the Russians that\nwe want to go back home. One of them, quite an intelligent fellow, he says, \u201cWell, why\ndon't you go to Russia. Your daughter will go to school and, and you'll be fine and I'll\nwrite to my commandant to, to arrange for you.\u201d So Pepi asked me, \u201cDo you want to go\nto Russia?\u201d I said, \u201cNo. I, I want to go home and see if I can find somebody alive.\u201d So\nshe, she said, \u201cWe'll have to think about it, want to see who 1s alive.\u201d And they said \u201cOh,\nyou can find out from there, too. Just go to Russia.\u201d Anyway, Pepi got some kind of a\ncarriage that took us, horse and buggy, that took us out and with those papers that she\nprepared, we got ourselves to Berlin. And when we got to Berlin there was a a Jewish\noffice on Rikostrasse (ph), a Jewish office where there were DPs, and we went there to\nregister to, to say that, \u201cWe're alive, we're here, and what next?\u201d And the funniest thing\nhappened: when I when I was interviewed by the interviewer on Rikostrasse in Berlin, he\ndidn't want to believe that that I was Jewish.\nI had problems convincing him, but I could prove it. I could prove it with the names and,\nand what little I knew. It was, the names of my family and, and we had a conversa- a\nlengthy conversation \u2018til, \u2018til he believed me. And we stayed in Berlin for a while. That\nwas another chapter that was very heartbreaking, however, nobody was getting killed and\nthat was the good part. And the Allies brought some food and some clothing and people\nwere looking for each other. It was just like drunk with freedom. Everybody was drunk\nwith freedom but looking, \u201cWho...who 1s alive? What do we do?\u201d But this was the good\npart of it. The bad part of it is that I didn't find anybody when I tried to go back. Tried to\ngo back and, and didn't find anybody. That was bad. Later on I found my father's brother\nin England with his family. I found my youngest uncle in Israel who went there before\nthe war as a khalutz,'\u00b0 and then I found that my Aunt Esther and her husband who was in\nRussia survived, and then they found little Jacek, and they came to Israel as a family.\nAnd that was something out of this world.",
        "Q: So when you -- can we come back to you now? What did you do? Where did you go?",
        "A: I, I was 1n Berlin, as I said, with Pepi, and we met there. Actually Pepi, she saw all kinds\nof people from, from the Jewish community and they were also American Jews, English\nJews, French and Russian -- in all the armies. That was before Berlin was, was divided by\na wall; it was all open. And Pepi, as usual, decided to, to help out others, so she had me\ndo things to help out others and people who came let's say from Russia or from a camp,\nneeded to stay over or go somewhere or get some clothes, being sent being sent wherever\nthey wanted to. So the majority wanted to go to, to the west. Pepi was there to help. Oh,\nyeah, Pepi was there to help, and being with her you couldn't help but help others. It was\ngreat to be able to do something that you wanted to do, to be able to say, \u201cYes, you can\ngo. You're free. Where do you want to go? You can go. You're hungry, here\u2019s food,\u201d you\nknow? There was a Jewish holiday where they had in Berlin. I'll never forget that. Pepi\ninvited all the Jewish people from all the armies. She says, \u201cI don't care if they are the\nFrench Army, the Russian Army, the American -- it's a Jewish holiday.\u201d\n'\u00a9 Pioneer (Hebrew).\nThey all came together and what a meal. I think each one brought something with them\nbecause we didn't have much and we had candles and they prayed, and it was a holiday. I\nmean, that was after all the, the things that we went through, there was a real Jewish\nholiday which was celebrated. I couldn't communicate with most of them. Learned a little\nRussian in concentration camp, but Pepi knew languages, but it didn't matter. You could\ncommunicate. And you could help. And that was great. It was great. It was like ecstasy.\nIt's just later on that everything comes out, when you find out that you don't have\nanybody anymore and it settles in. I find that we all carry with us, the survivors I mean,\nwe carry with us a certain something. I can't put my finger on a certain part in our brain\nthat is different from everybody else in the world who did not go through what we did. I\nthink that I can recognize a survivor probably from across the street, or at least when we\nexchange a few words. There is something about us that I don't find in any other people;\nmaybe the, the sad look in their eyes or maybe some expressions. I don't know what it 1s.\nAnd we all carry that and many times our children do that, too. they, although they didn't\ngo through the things we did, they're a part of it. They suffer from not having uncles and\naunts and cousins. They suffer because their parents are overly protective. They suffer\nfrom it. They do it. I get a phone call from my kids every week, whether I need it or not,\nbecause I can't live otherwise. This is, this is the leftover from, from knowing where they\nare, knowing that they are all right. I wish I could change, but I can't. They have to\nunderstand that that's what I need. They do understand it but it's, it's an imposition on\npeople. People shouldn't have to do that. So, my generation and our children, they carry\nthe burden. Hopefully, we won\u2019t have that thing happen again and, and the grandchildren\nwill not need to, to carry the burden. They, they can learn from history what happened so,\nso they can prevent it in the future, but they shouldn't need to carry a burden. Nobody\nshould.",
        "Q: Id like -- indeed -- I'd like to come back to know how you got to Bergen-Belsen?",
        "A: Oh, well, I got to Bergen-Belsen after the war finished. We start off in Berlin where Pepi\nand I stayed and helped. And, of course, there were for Pepi, helped in a in a orphanage\nand tried, at that time there were, the British wanted to take the orphans out to the British\nzone. They started making the zones, French zone, British zone, you know, and Pepi\nregistered me in the orphanage, and I went to the orphanage so that one day the British\ncame with a truck and they told us to sit down in the truck and they took us out. What I\ndidn't know then which I found out later was that some authority got -- found out that\nPepi's helping many DPs and even some soldiers from, from a different army who did not\nallow their people to, to move, but they wanted to, to go. And she was helping and\nsomehow they found out and they came looking for her at night and she ran away. She\nknew that she was being hunted at that time, so she sent me away.",
        "Q: Ok, Let\u2019s take -- I need to go back in the truck, you are now loaded into a truck. Where\nare you taken?",
        "A: Oh, we were taken first, first we were taken, I think we stopped at Hanover. We stopped\nat Hanover, and then we were taken to Bergen-Belsen, or was it the other way around? I\ncan't remember.",
        "Q: Can you tell us what was Bergen-Belsen like at that time?",
        "A: Bergen-Belsen was another orphanage, and I was just talking to -- it was Block RB-6 was\nthe orphanage where there were some orphans and they brought us in to together so that\nthey could care for us. And, of course, many people were ecstatic, they found each other\nbut I couldn't find anybody I knew. I didn't know too many people before the war started\nand so I couldn't find many people and they cared for us very well in Bergen-Belsen, but\nit was all after the war. It, 1t was -- the burden was already there.",
        "Q: Is this where you met Hadassah?",
        "A: Yes, yes. That's where I met Hadassah, right.",
        "Q: Can you tell me what she was doing? Could you repeat her name?",
        "A: Hadassah Rosensaft. Well, at that time, when I was in Bergen-Belsen, her name was Dr.\nBimko, and there was a gentleman by the name of Yasala (ph) Rosensaft, and they were\ncaring for the DPs, the displaced persons. I know that much, and I remember they got\nmarried. However, I did not -- I wasn't there apparently when their son was born. I found\nthat out much later. And we kept in touch throughout the years but not very close and not\nvery often. Her ways were, were different from mine although we lived also in Manhattan\nafterwards. I had two children to raise. I had a job and our ways are not the same but\nwhenever there was something going on where survivors meet, she was there and I was\nthere and somehow, even if we didn't talk or we just acknowledged, we were there. It's\nfunny. We were there --",
        "Q: I'm sorry. I'm going to have to interrupt you because of time. Can you tell me when you\ncame to the United States?",
        "A: I came to the United States in November of 1955.",
        "Q: Who came with you?",
        "A: My dear husband, Ike.",
        "Q: Oh, wait, wait, wait. Back up. Where did you meet Ike at?",
        "A: Oh.",
        "Q: We have to be short here.",
        "A: Ok, well, from Bergen-Belsen a short, short trip, we\u2019re sent to Blankenese, which 1s\nanother place for the orphans. From Blankenese, we went to Marseilles where we\nboarded a ship, Champolion, that brought us to Egypt. Now Hadassah was on it. I didn't\nknow that because my Pepi was putting in on Champoulyan. Pepi was adding people who\ndidn't have any papers. Approximately 10 before us went up, went on board before I was\nallowed to board it, so many, many illegal -- but we, we got there, and it was impossible\nto see each other on the, on the ship. Many people and overloaded and all that, but we\nmade the trip and we got there. And as Hadassah explained, we were divided into three\ngroups. Each one went to a different kibbutz. We were studying. We were working and\nwe were also semi-drafted, ala cub scouts, except we were trained with rifles and, and\ngrenades and night, night exercise, combat exercise. then of course we had the War of\nIndependence. After the War of Independence, I went to England to see my uncle, my\nfather's brother, and he wanted to adopt me but I wanted to go back to Israel. And when I\ncame back from Israel, I met Ike whom I married two years later.",
        "Q: Then you came to the United States?",
        "A: We came to the United States with Ike and with a little 18-month old son, and Ike's\nparents were here in New York. We lived with them and then with another little boy born\nin New York City in Mt. Sinai Hospital, right. And that's the story.",
        "Q: Quite a story. Doris, can you tell me what you think the effect of the Holocaust has been\non you, of going through all that?",
        "A: Never thought about it, what the effect is on me. My children and my husband, they tell\nme that I'm a strong lady and I think that if it is true, then this would be one result. The\neffect is that I am probably overly sensitive to people's opinions, to people's behavior,\nand I'm constantly on the watch about safety, about wars, about slanderous talking. I'm\nmore sensitive to that, I think, as a result. I also find that telling your story and telling\nwhat you feel towards people, which is mainly good stuff, love, people are good if they\nknow it but if they are fed different information and they don't know any better, they can't\nbehave any better. I, I feel that that I can, that I can explain or like people more than I\ncould before the war. I'm closer to, to everybody, to the whole world because of it. I'm\nalso watchful. I think all this 1s, is the result from, from what I went through my life.\nWe're all, we're all products of our past, and I think that's what the past did to me. Good,\nbad, indifferent, I don't know. That\u2019s just me.",
        "Q: I thank you, Doris.",
        "A: I wish I didn\u2019t have to \u2014",

        "A: My full name is Doris Greenberg, and I was born Fuchs.!",
        "A: I was born in 19- 1930, in Warsaw, Poland.",
        "A: For me, I thought it was heaven. And we had a large family. My grandparents have -- had\nsix children: three boys and three girls. My mother was the oldest of the children. So, I\nhad five uncles and aunts, and some of them were married. And since my mother was the\noldest, I was treated like the baby, very well. The, the first, the second grandchild in the\nfamily. And, and life was for me marvelous. Summers we spent in a place outside of\nWarsaw. It was called the Line of Otvosk train. On that line were a few villages and\nsometimes my parents would rent a house in one village or another and we would spend\nsummers there so that my parents could come out for the Sabbath for the weekend and\nstay with us, with my sister and I. And, of course, I just recently started school and\neverything was new and everything was rosy. I didn't know there was a worry in the\nworld. Loved school, then went to, to learn how to dance and rhythm in Maccabee.\nEnjoyed life. Wintertime, skating; summertime, bicycle riding -- and that's how I\nremember home. The holidays were spent in my grandparents' house with all the children\naround and, and favorite dishes and favorite cups and very traditional, very traditional,\nand it was just great. It was just great.",
        "A: Well, when the war broke out -- this was almost the beginning of a school year when the\nwar broke out, and there was approximately three weeks of bombardment before the\nGermans entered Warsaw, and from the rubble I got injured but didn't feel bad. I was\nwith my family and I didn't understand what was happening until, until I heard that\nJewish males are, are running away towards the eastern border and two of my uncles and\nmy father got ready to leave. My father then changed his mind and he stayed to take care\nof the family. They were going to leave, going towards the east, away from the Germans\n' The interviewee notes that this name is spelled \u201cFox\u201d by her relatives living in England.\nand that's when it dawned on me that something is wrong. But the Germans came in and\nimmediate- immediately did not happen anything, like the same week, did not. But in a\nvery short time, things started happening -- for the whole population and not only for\nJews. It was very bad. Orders came out almost daily: \u201cYou mustn't do this, you mustn't\ndo that. You have to give up your radios, your gold, your things. You're not allowed to go\nhere or there.\u201d Everyday something new, for the whole population, and it began being\nreally bad for the Jews. They were singled out. We had to wear armbands, white\narmbands with a blue Star of David to identify ourselves. Jewish stores had to be\nidentified. People who lived in Poland used to use their Jewish name in a, in a Polish\nversion, and this was forbidden. You had to show your real Jewish name for easy\nidentification and, therefore, persecution, beatings, and, and sending -- being sent out to,\n\u201cTo work,\u201d so they said, and just beatings. And then Jews were not allowed to walk on\nthe on the sidewalk, only in the middle of the streets. It became worse and worse daily.",
        "A: I was...I was all right as long as I was with my family because during this time my\nparents got in touch with a former teacher and they -- the teacher organized a little class\nof children to come to his house and study in exchange for almost anything like some\nfood or clothing for his family. Of course, it was forbidden, and I enjoyed going there.\nWe started off with 10 children, and little by little, the group got smaller as the children\ndied from hunger or were caught and killed. I never knew what happened, just that they\ndidn't show. But this happened: One day when I was on my way to, to the teacher,\nProfessor Rozycki -- oh, we used to come separately so that the Germans or nobody\nwould see that we're forming a group, so each one came within a few minutes of each\nother, and one day I was on my way and a few blocks away somebody stopped me and\nsaid, \u201cAre you going to Professor Rozycki?\u201d and I didn't answer. And they said, \u201cDon't\ngo there.\u201d So I didn't go there, and I waited and it became clear that that very morning the\nGermans came, raided his house, killed all the males in the family. Even his father-in-\nlaw, who was in a wheelchair, was thrown out of the window. I don't remember how I got\nhome, but I think that this was the, the time when my life, when I started realizing as a\nyoung girl what -- that something is happening. I looked around and people were on the\nstreet covered with papers, bodies, near bodies, were crying for bread. I was always fed,\nso I don't remember crying for food, although hunger was a constant companion. But the,\nthe view of the bodies covered with paper, the swollen bodies, was bad. I had more time\nto look around and see it. When I was busy in school, I was busy.\nWe had classes the whole day and then homework, and it kept us busy. But then when\nthis was gone, I could see -- look around me, and I could see everything. I lost my friends\nto hunger. I, I saw people -- bodies -- being taken away in a little carriage, hand carriage,\nand there was nothing that I could do for anybody, nothing. There was a former teacher,\nPani? Kaminska, who was our music teacher in school and she tried to form a, a choir\nunder those circumstances. It was unbelievable how our people tried to keep up the spirit,\nand how people know that when you're learning, when you're \u201cdoing,\u201d you can, you can\nwithstand hardship. May be easier or may be, may be harder, but it enables you to\ncontinue. You don't get necessarily wrapped up in yourself, in your hunger, in you- your\nbeing cold, or whatever. And we tried very hard, but it became impossible. It became\nimpossible. Very soon thereafter we got orders to move: all Jews have to move into\ncertain streets or rather remove themselves from certain streets in, in Warsaw, and there\nwere some streets that were we were allowed to move to and we had to move. We were\nallowed to -- my parents had a store right across the street from our apartment, so in order\nto move fast like we were ordered many -- much of our belongings were put in the store\nand little by little we would carry to the new so-called apartment.\nAnd one day before we knew it, we woke up and the gates of the ghetto were closed,\neverybody trapped. And I didn't realize it then but I did realize that there were so many\npeople walking in. Now I know that it was because we were squeezed into a smaller area\nand also there were people brought in from other places into Warsaw ghetto, and\ntherefore there were so many people and so many hungry and dead and cold people and\nthere was nothing that anybody can do. Now the Germans daily would go out and catch\npeople in the street, take them to what they called the Umschlagplatz\u00b0, put them in trains\nand send them out. As a matter of fact, at the beginning, one of my aunts who had a\nhusband and a son a year older than I was when they saw the advertising that the, the\nGermans put out that anybody who comes on his own to that Umschlagplatz will be\ntreated well and sent to a camp for the duration of the war. My aunt packed for them their\nbelongings and -- like bags -- and she got them there without knowing where they were\ngoing. Never saw them again and after a while we started hearing that that those people\nare not being sent to work. And you know, nobody wanted to believe. People\nwere...started jumping off trains if they could. Whether they get shot or not, they tried.\nAnd more and more we started hearing that that people are being brought to camps and\nnever heard from afterwards. To me, it was unbelievable. Nobody told me anything, but I\ncould hear the adults talking among themselves. So it became worse and worse and then\nafter they caught everybody in the streets, they started clearing out building by building.\nThey made unannounced visits and called everybody to come down and be marched\naway. They also organized some factories. I remember I -- I was in one. I always looked\nolder than I was and somehow my aunt, my aunt, my uncle, they took me along and I\nworked. This was after they took my parents away.\n* Mrs. (Polish).\n> The deportation area that separated the ghetto from surrounding Poland (German).",
        "A: Well, my parents...my parents perished separately. They -- when the Germans organized\nfactories, everybody had to register and go to work, which they did, but then one day they\nmarched off everybody from the factory and that's how my father got caught. He went to\nwork, never came back. The whole group was marched to Umschlagplatz and sent away.\nMy mom, she went out one morning to see if she could exchange some clothes for some\nfood for the family and she got caught on the street and sent to Umschlagplatz. Never\nsaw her again. Now, my older sister -- we, we then had to move again twice after, after\nthat. And at that time, my older sister and I, we went with, with my grandmother, my\naunt, and my aunt's little boy. We were living in Muranowska, and one day when the\nGermans came in to look for us, we had, we had hiding places. We had -- well, I have to\ngo back and describe the hiding place. In this building, like in many buildings in Warsaw,\nthe outside walls are very thick and there was no refrigeration at that time, so usually\nunderneath a window there would be a little cabinet that served as a refrigerator. The\nbuildings were made of stone and therefore keeping things cool and the walls are very\nwide. We were, we were in such a building and at the time my grandmother, my aunt and\nher little boy would sit right underneath in the, in the little cabinet underneath the\nwindow, and I put a chair in front of it so nobody notices there is a door. Then there was\na folding bed that folded up to look like a table with a mattress inside and my sister went\ninside, and I folded the bed and I threw something over it so that she cannot be noticed.\nAnd I went -- I was supposed to go upstairs to the attic and hide in the attic, but by the\ntime all that was done there was no time to go to the attic, so I went to the little bathroom\nwhich had a shelf. Where I sit now across was a shelf, up high, and on the wall that they\nhad a ladder standing there for whatever reason. I jumped on top of the shelf in the\nbathroom and there was the bulb, the light. I quietly unscrewed the bulb and I made sure\nthat my clothes don't show down and I sat there quietly. Well, the Germans came in and\nthey found my sister....So that's how I lost my parents and my sister.",
        "A: Yes. We, we heard some shots and, and, see, my aunt and my grandmother could see\nthrough a little ventilator that was in the wall, but they didn't tell me anything, but I heard\nfrom neighbors that they have shot my sister, but I don't know for sure. Over the years\nI've been trying to find her. You know, just, just the possibility...right? Nobody told me\nfor sure. So that's how I lost them.",
        "A: Well, I had, I had, I have an uncle who was married and -- to a Polish lady, and she was\nwith him in the ghetto all the time. They lost a son to, to illness and my other uncle\ntogether with his brother decided -- and my aunt -- they decided that something has to be\ndone and we have to leave, so they went out and they found an apartment somewhere,\nvery inexpensive with one bedroom and, first, her husband, my aunt's husband, my uncle,\ncame out to live in that apartment.",
        "A: Outside of the ghetto, oh, yes.",
        "A: Well, they smuggled themselves out with a group of people that was going to work, to\nlabor. There were factories -- there were places where, outside of the ghetto, where Jews\nwere marched to every morning and brought back to the ghetto every night, and they\nworked there, and you could apparently -- I wouldn't know how, but apparently you\ncould. I heard that you could sometimes find either a nice or a greedy soldier who was\nwatching and for some money would let somebody out. I haven't witnessed it that but just\nheard. I know that my uncle would go out with a group of people. They were going to, to\na factory that used to belong to a family person like a cousin or of, of the family's who\nhad a factory of, of electric chandeliers, and the Germans took it over, and I think that\nthey kept him as a manager or something, or as a foreman, and groups were coming in to\nwork. They probably switched their chandeliers. They didn't do chandeliers, only did\nother things in there, but it was still something. So the groups were coming 1n and out and\nhe could go out, smuggle himself out and then two brothers and one brother's wife. My\nuncle Janek with his wife Zosia; my uncle Mietek, who was single, and my Aunt Zosia\nhad brothers there who apparently helped them find an apartment and it was all in Aunt\nZosia's name. That's why it was a small apartment, and they made a double wall over\nthere. In the little bedroom they made a double wall and that's where later on my\ngrandmother went out this way into that apartment. My uncle came to pick them up, and\nthen my aunt went, and...with a baby, little Jakov, who was born in May of '39 just before\nthe war started. And little by little, whoever was left -- my grandmother, my aunt, my\nother aunt, two uncles, and I was left and my Aunt Tecia, the one who sent her husband\nand son on the on the trip, well, she was a nurse and a very good nurse, and my uncle\ncame to take her out, and she refused to go. Apparently, she knew there were rumors,\nmust have been rumors about the, the revol- the revolt, and as a nurse she wanted to be\nthere and besides by that time she realized that her husband and son are dead, so she did\nnot want to leave. Anyway, it was decided that I go out, so my uncle took me out.",
        "A: Oh, when, when I left the Warsaw ghetto, there were still some buildings there staying,\nstanding. The, the ghetto was, was -- there was very few people -- not, not more people.\nMost people were either in the factories or gone from the factories, and on the street you\ndidn't see anybody. You couldn't. When, when I left Warsaw a year later to go to camp,\nthat's when Warsaw looked terrible, all burned out. But when I left ghetto it was still\nstanding and the revolt started and after it was finished, I took a -- when I was outside I\nwas able to, to ride in a tram, tramway around the walls and I saw it burning, and I saw\nthe airplane coming and bombing it, and I saw it all burning, and I couldn't even shed a\ntear. You become so strong. I never thought about it, but you become so strong. The, the\nsurvival \u2014 the urge to survive becomes number one priority, and I just looked at it and my\nthought was that I mustn't cry because other people will see me. Unreal, but true.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Oh...",
        "A: Ok, the approximate time I can know, because my birthday was in March and I remember\nwhen my uncle told me the story how it was decided that I come out of the ghetto. It\nseems my uncle spoke to his wife, Zosia, and he told her that it's my birthday and I'm a\nyoung child and so on, and an invitation was issued for me to come out. So my other\nuncle, his brother, Uncle Mietek, he came back into the ghetto and he is the one who took\nme out. We went with a group of workers, night shift. And we marched, marched\ntogether and we were marched through the streets to that factory on....I think 1t was on\nGrzybowska Street...that factory that belonged to, to this relative of ours. I even\nremembered his name but I can't recall it on the spot -- Gruszkiewicz, Gruszkiewicz.\nWell, we -- finally, the whole group went in into the big door or gate and in front 1t was\nempty only you had to go through a -- well, it is like, like the building is all around and,\nand is...in the center is empty. So they had to go to the other side and the workers walked\nthrough this gate into the factory. My uncle and I went into the staircase on the side of the\nfront which was empty, and I remember we sat there quietly the whole night. It was very\ncold. It was sometime in March. It was very cold.\nWe sat there the whole night because of the curfew and in the morning we carefully, very\ncarefully made our way to the apartment of my aunt and uncle. We were stopped on the\nway by somebody who wanted money who felt he recognized us. My uncle took care of\nit. | was just numb. I was just numb. But we finally reached the, the apartment there and I\nsaw my grandmother and my aunt and at that time my little cousin was not there anymore\nbecause they found a place for him with a Polish woman whom, whom -- who was paid,\nand she was also very, very good. She took care of him. He was like three years old, three\nand a half. And it was quite, quite a risk to take a little boy of three and a half. And she\ntook the risk so she, she took care of the little boy in her room. She only lived in one\nroom. Everything together -- the kitchen, and was, was a little stove there. That's all. And\nshe took care of him. And she was not rich. She was something. So when I got to that\napartment, I saw my uncle, my two aunts, my grandmother, and I must say that that I felt\nkind of safe. Little did I know that...that we weren't safe at all, but that's how I felt.",
        "A: Oh, we didn't, we didn't stay there too long. As I said I felt safe but it was not very safe\nbecause in a very little time, soon after we got there, after the curfew there was a knock\non the door and some agents came in. They spoke Polish. They must have been German\nagents that knew Polish. You know, there were some people there they call themselves\nVolksdeutche,* but they, they spoke Polish very well. I don't know who they were. They\nwere civilians, but I remember they wore boots, high boots. They came in and they\nlooked and they found a little trap door and they got us all out. Oh, yeah. So, it wasn't that\nsafe as I thought.",
        "A: Well, they wanted to take us to, to the authorities. My Aunt Zosia, she begged them and,\nand she did everything she could and they would talk only to her. They wouldn't talk to\nanybody else, and whatever possessions there were, they took it all in exchange for an\nagreement that in the morning right after curfew lets off, we'll all disperse, and they don't\nwant to see us anymore. So that's what happened. We just had to leave. And from that\ntime, each, each of us had a different story to tell. Well, Adolph (ph), my Aunt Zosia, and\nUncle Janek -- they both survived. My uncle Janek lives in Warsaw. He\u2019s marvelous,\nhe\u2019s marvelous. Aunt Zosia died two years ago, I think. I went to visit when she was still\nalive. My grandmother didn't survive. She committed suicide in a bathtub, in a public, in\na public bath- bath house, after she heard that her son, Uncle Mietek was killed and that\nhappened while I was watching. So --\n* Ethnic Germans (German).",
        "A: Well, after we were all dispersed, we had some, we had to find some place to stay and\nAunt Zosia took care of Aunt -- Janek, her husband. Uncle Mietek, he tried to take care\nof, of his sister Esther and the little boy who was with this lady, Olga, Olga her name, and\n-- and there was another young fellow whom my Uncle Mietek rescued. I forgot his name\nbut he was 17 years old\u00b0. And at that time he found through, through some acquaintances\nfrom before the war. They\u2019re were some people that that knew us. Through them he\nfound a lady with two daughters, grown daughters, and she \u2014 for, for payment, she\ndecided to take us in. Her name was Jadwiga Rzempoluch. Can't remember the address,\nand she took me in. I was, I was there doing practically nothing, but one of the daughters\nhad a baby, so I would play with the baby and the whole family smoked so I was making\nthe, the cigarettes with the machine -- papierosnica\u00ae -- they used to have. And then one\nday, then one day when it became a little warmer, they decided that it's going to be very\ngood and safe to go to their summer place. They had a summer place in Struga which was\non another narrow train line. There were regular trains and the ones, the short distance\nones, and this was on the line of Radzymin, and there was a little place Struga where they\nhad a, a place and they decided to go there and we went there. There was, besides Mrs.\nRzempoluch and her two daughters, one of whom was blond and one of whom was dark\nhaired and brown eyed. The blond young lady had a baby. The, the other one was single.\nThen my Uncle Mietek, the young 17 year old boy and I, we all went out to Struga for\nsummer to enjoy the summer vacation.\nAnd it was beautiful. We had a nice evening, and we went to bed and early in the\nmorning we were surrounded by Germans who knocked on the doors, woke us up and\nthey demanded two Jew -- two Jewish men and a Jewish woman. Somebody must have\ntold them, and at that time they took out the young fellow, the 17 year old boy...18. They\nbeat him, they beat him. They, they broke all his limbs before they shot him dead. My\nUncle Mietek, he had, he had some good documents, probably false, I don't know;\nsomething that was called good documents. They didn't beat him. They just told him to\ntake a handkerchief and put in front of his face and walk away. And the Germans were\ntarget shooting to shoot out his brains through the handkerchief and they did. They did.\nSo they couldn't find the woman because I was there. They thought, they thought it was\nthe dark haired daughter of Pani Rzempoluch, but she worked for, for the chocolate firm\nWedl and had very good documents and they checked on it and it wasn't her. They didn't\nknow, they didn't question me. Finally they took me as a hostage to Radzymin to the\npolice station to find out what happened to the Jewish woman or Jewish female or\nwhatever. That's how my uncle died.\n> The interviewee later noted that the man\u2019s name was Kutner.\n\u00b0 Cigarette case (Polish).",
        "A: Well, I was there I think two days and they kept questioning me. I was, what, about 14?\nThey kept questioning me, and I told them that I was from, from the eastern Poland\nwhere the Russians are so that nobody can check and then they came, came out with a\nmap to show where, where it is. I said I don't know how to read a map. See --",
        "A: I originally had but they were stolen out of my pocket one day and I didn't have -- so told\nthem I don't know how to read a map. On the third day they took me across the street\nfrom the police station to a bar, two of them, Polish policemen, and they ordered vodka\nand I thought that -- I, I didn't tell them anything. Whatever they ask me, I said, \u201cI don't\nknow.\u201d I didn't know anything. I was just there as a maid and I'm from the eastern part. I,\nI had a name for this little town, and that's all I know. Well, they ordered vodka. I, I had\nonly one shot with them, and then afterwards when they drank and I tried to -- I spilled it\nall. I, I didn't know what to do. They asked again, but then I heard this little whistle of the\ntrain and Radzymin was the last stop of the train so 1t would only go back to Warsaw. It\nwas running between Warsaw and Radzymin. I heard the whistle and I got up to see at\nthe door of the bar, the was door, and the two policemen looked. I didn't say anything. I\nopened the door and I ran as quickly as I could and, and I jumped in into the train as it\nstarted moving, yeah. I don't know if I could have any guts to do that nowadays. I\nprobably couldn't run either, but that's what happened and, and I had to hide out from the\nconductor because I had no money for ticket and the train arrived to Warsaw. Was close\nto curfew time, and I had no place to go, but, I got into a, a house and into a staircase and\nspent the night there, yeah.",
        "A: Oh, the time -- the days were like nights and nights like days. It's really hard to, to say,\n\u201cThe next morning...\u201d or \u201cThe next day...\u201d or whatever, but what happened 1s that I went\nback to the area where my parents and I used to live and I tried to find some friends. My\nparents had a lot of friends and my grandparents, my grandmother, my uncles, aunts --\nthey were living there all their lives. They had a lot of friends. I went to a lady who was,\nwho used to come and talk to my mother for hours and hours and I thought they were\nvery good friends. Pani Adamowska, I went to her and she, she was afraid. She was glad\nto see me and she told me that she's happy that I'm alive, but she was really afraid. And I\nwent to other places but couldn't find a place. Spent a couple of nights on, on staircases\nand, and I went to visit Pani Ola who had little Jakov, and she treated me so well. She\ndid. What a person. I would feel that Pani Adamowska, who was educated and friend,\nthat she would be the one. Instead Pani Ola who was really plain nice, nice person -- she\ndid. She let me spend the night on the floor, she gave me something to eat, and she told\nme that there was a job open on this same line Otvosk, which I mentioned at the\nbeginning that our family used to spend summers between Warsaw and Otvosk.\nOn this same line in a little village somebody was looking for a maid and I went there and\nI got hired. Yeah. That that solved a lot of problems. And I worked there for a while and I\nwas able to once a week bring some potatoes or bread to Pani Ola who had little Jakov,\nwho, who was named then Jacek. Jacek is now an engineer at a doctorate from, from\nHaifa Technion. He's also -- how do you say? He teaches, let's put it this way.\nOccasionally gives lectures, that's what I wanted to say. He lectures occasionally and he\nhas three beautiful daughters and one granddaughter, and that was my, that's my little\ncousin. So he spent the war with Pani Ola. His mother also had a story. My Aunt Esther,\na story all by its --everybody has a story.",
        "A: I was working as a maid. I was on the horse (ph). I was able to, to bring somethings to\nPani Ola, food. I would -- when I peeled potatoes, I was allowed to take the peels and I\nwould go to Warsaw to a German kitchen, give them the peels and they would give me\nbread. And then I think that they fed the peels to, to some animals. So anyway I was\nbringing some potatoes, bread, milk, I was looking after the, the goats. I was able to do\nthat, and then while be -- while I was with, with, at Ola's, spending a few nights, I met a\nperson who from that day on played a big role in my life. She came from, from Lvov. She\nlost a husband and a child. Actually she lost a child. She didn't know where her husband\nwas. And she came to Warsaw and somebody told her to go to Pani Ola. I don't know\nhow she got there, but I met her there.",
        "A: Pepi. Her name was Pepi. But I didn't know that because at the time she had false papers\nand her name was Emilia Boszko. I met her at Ola's, and I had a job. And then in, in that\nsmall village near Miedzeszyn there was a nursery school, kindergarten and somebody\ntold me that there was an opening there. And I told Pepi that there's an opening and she\nwent and she got the job. It was very, very hard. She did everything but she had a place\nto, to sleep and she got the job. And then she read in the paper or she found out that in\nWarsaw, in a suburb of Warsaw, Zoliborz, was an opening for a cook in a restaurant and\nshe went and she got the job as a cook. Meanwhile, where I was, was getting a little\nuncomfortable because when I went to the priest on Sunday, he, he looked at me funny.\nHe gave me a, a pocketful of nuts and candy and he told me that there was one God for\neverybody. He was fantastic.",
        "A: And one day he sent a message to me that I should go to another town for a couple of\nhours, and there was a raid, so I knew he was a friend. Well, I probably will tell you just\nthat I became a cook's helper in Warsaw in Zoliborz.\nEnd of Tape #1\nTape #2\n[Technical Conversation]",
        "A: No, Pruszkow --",
        "A: In Warsaw and around Warsaw, in Michalen, in Miedzeszyn, in Zoliborz. We were\ntalking about that. When I first got to got to know and went to church, was there in\nWarsaw.",
        "A: No, no. After.",
        "A: After, right. I, I had originally -- my Uncle Mietek had arranged for false identification\npapers which I think I mentioned before they were stolen out of my pocket together with\nthe r\u00e9zaniec,\u2019 which are the pray, the beads that you pray. And it was stolen out of my\npocket in a tramway in Warsaw, and I had no documentation. I couldn't get a job\nanywhere because wherever I went they wanted documents and -- or my original false\ndocuments said that I came from a little village near the Russian border and I kept up\nwith it, and my name was Krystyna Maria Kalnowska. And it continued to be that way,\nbut when my documents were stolen and I couldn't get a job, I went to the authorities --\noh, yes. I went to the authorities and they were in front. There were Polish policemen and\nthere were Germans all over the place and although I studied German I did not tell\nanybody I knew, but I came up to a Polish policeman and I told him that I don't have any\ndocuments. I can't get a job because everybody thinks I'm Jewish without papers. I need\nsome documents, at which point the policeman brought me to an office and they asked\nme for a few zloty to pay for the document, and I said I had no money. A few policemen\ngot them together and paid I think six zloty or whatever.\n\u2019 Rosary (Polish).\nI didn't have any money and I needed the documents and, and I got a real good document\nso I could get a job with it and that's how I got it. Oh, I met a lot of good people. I have\ntrust in people. You see, when we're talking about the Nazi era, that's one thing. But\nwhen we're talking about people, now that's another thing. People are good. And I found\nlots of goodness in people, everywhere I went. It doesn't \u2014 it, it made no difference\nwhether they were, what their religion was, their nationality, I find good people. Maybe\nI'm lucky but that's what I see. Like the documents. And I felt that at one point that\nreligion is religion, and we play pray to God and at the same time it's also safe to go\nSunday to church, and I thought to myself that I'm gonna to pray to God. I don't have to\nname God. Whatever it 1s, I'm gonna to pray, and I went to church. This was -- the only\nthing I had were churches. I went to church and I prayed. I didn't know how. I picked up\na book and I read and I did what other people did, and pretty soon I was pretty good. And\nthis priest I mentioned before in that little town, as I said, I used to go Sunday to church\nand then in a little town you stop and talk and he talked to me, and I was not very\nconvincing. I didn't try to be convincing. I was talking to a priest. I was more open than,\nthan with anybody on the street except I didn't give myself away willingly. I didn't state\nwho I was, but he figured out and he also put some nuts in my pocket for Sunday, and\ncandy. But he told me that I could get a better job or whatever and I didn't pay attention. I\nneeded that one. But one day I got really sick, very sick. I broke out in, 1n skin rashes and\nthat's because I was taking care of a pig and of a goat, billy goat, and cleaning out all that.\nI only owned one flannel yellow shirt which at daytime I put a piece of string around, was\na dress, and at night it was a nightgown. And once when I wanted to wash it, I froze. I\ndidn't have it. And my bed was in the kitchen and, on this side of the wall. The other side\nof the wall was the pig sty. And from this I got all kinds of rashes. I didn't go to the\ndoctor of course, but I told the priest. I think that gave me away. He said, \u201cDid you grow\nup on a farm?\u201d And I said [nodding head \u201cyes\u2019\u2019]. \u201cWell,\u201d he says, \u201cyou belong -- you,\nyou don't belong on a farm.\u201d And, and he told me to go to the pharmacy and buy\ncalamine lotion or whatever it was, and I did. And this is the same priest who one day\nsent word that I ought to go to another town for a while. And I knew that he, he knows\nthat somebody must have said something or suspect and if there was a suspicion they\nwould come and check it out. So I walked to Warsaw, stayed at Ola's for the night and\neverything went ok, but I couldn't stay there much longer. Also my friend Pepi was in\nWarsaw, in Zoliborz, and -- where I went to visit with her, she told me there is an\nopening for an assistant cook, but there was no place to, to stay. She had a bed in the in\nthe room behind the kitchen. She's willing to share it with me, and I did that. I went to, to\nher in Zoliborz and helped her in the kitchen of a restaurant. We were there, oh, couple of\nmonths when the Polish revolt started in '44, and I remember that day. That was a tough\nday.\nIt is all, it is all together, comes together with my aunt and her son Jacek, who was with\nOla. It happened to be my day off, and I went to my aunt and she was at that time on the\nother side of River Vistula. They call it now Vistula but it's Wisla, really, on -- in Praga.\nIt's not Prague, Czechoslovakia. It's the part of Warsaw that's called Praga. She was there\nas a maid and I helped her arrange it. And another good soul, another gorgeous person\ndid it for me. It cost money, yes. Whatever I earned in the restaurant as that helper's cook\nand Pepi's salary went for it be --",
        "A: He, a friend of my parents' who was working as a tram driver, conductor on the tram. I\nmet him on the street one day and he wanted to help me. And I told him that I need a\nplace for my aunt to stay, and some documents, and he arranged it. His name I never\nforget because I was looking for him for many years. I wanted to thank him. I don't know\nif he's alive. Stefan Mningoc, Stefan Mningoc. I get goose bumps when I think about it.\nHe had a sister who lived in Praga with a husband and some children, I don't remember\nhow many. And the husband declared himself Volksdeutche. Means that he gets all the\nprivileges, and of course with the privileges becomes the possibility to hire a maid. Now\nthis Stefan went to his sister after he arranged for my aunt a document saying that she's\nNatalia, forgot the last name. I'll remember it probably. Natalia, he arranged for her the\ndocuments. He went to his sister and he told her a story. He told her that Natalia is a\nwidow of a fellow officer in the Polish army and she willing to be the governess for the\nchildren and whatever because she is now a widow. He told his own sister that and he\nknew that people were, were, were killed if they tried to help Jews and yet he did that for\nmy aunt. He told me it was for my parents and for my sister that he's doing that.\nAnd she wo- she worked there as a maid and on that day when, when the Polish revolt\nstarted. I had a day off, and I went to visit her across, walked across the bridge and she\nhad given me a sweater which she knitted for her son, little Jakov -- little Jacek -- and she\n-- and IJ -- said \u201cYes, I'm going there.\u201d She says, \u201cWould you take it to my son?\u201d And I\ntook the sweater and I visited with her first and I took the sweater, and I went back to the\nbridge to visit Ola with my little cousin and brought the sweater. And then I went back to\nZoliborz to the restaurant where I was, and as I came back the shots started. And the, the\nPolish revolt started. It was '44. I think October 1, if I'm not mistaken. I hadn't seen them\nuntil after the war because --",
        "A: My aunt or my cousin, her son. You wanted to know how about my grandmother, I think\nyou asked. Oh, no. I did say -- I did tell you that she committed suicide when she found\nout that my Uncle Miatek was killed.",
        "A: Well, I can tell you what it was for me.",
        "A: It was a day that I had the time off and I went to visit my aunt and my cousin and came\nback in quite a good mood because I saw them. They were safe. They were alive. I gave\nthem, each one of them, regards so I was kind of a contact. They were not seeing each\nother. So the mood was elated and I came back to Zoliborz, to the restaurant and I told\nPepi all about it. Of course, we had to communicate very discreetly because the owners\nof the restaurant couldn't find out that we know each other from before or who we are. So\nthe -- that day was good. When the shots started, I didn't know what it was all about but\nthis Stefan who arranged for my aunt to stay with his sister, he came in that day to the\nrestaurant, and he said that there 1s a revolt going and he's 1n it and he won't see me for a\nwhile. I never saw him since. Never again. And the first day was, was pretty good for me.\nBut then of course the shooting started. I have to explain that when you are with other\npeople and they are shooting buildings with the Krajowa\u00ae from across the river, you're\nscared, but you feel that you're in the same co-- position with all other people and that\nthere is a war going on. One never suggests that that when there is a political war that\nsomebody wants to hurt civilians. But, sure, civilians do get hurt, so it was not bad --\nespecially when we heard after a while that the Russians are in Praga, across the river,\nand we thought any minute they'll come in. Somebody will come in to stop the shooting.\nSomebody would free so that we don't have the shooting and, and nobody dies.\nWell, it didn't happen that way because the Russians stopped there. They didn't cross the\nriver. The, the revolt took two months and then we were all captured and led through the\ncity of Warsaw to the train that took us to Pruszkow, and at the time the city of Warsaw\nwas very, very bad. We could smell the smoldering the, the, the fires but they were\nalmost burned out. Mainly, we saw skeletons of homes, of houses. We walked in the\nmiddle of the road because there was a lot of debris and we were walked to the train and\nat that time from Warsaw to Pruszkow. We went in cattle trains, but locked not closed.\nThey were halfway open. Nobody thought of jumping or, or running away. Pepi and I, we\nlooked at each other: \u201cAre we going or are we not?\u201d I -- she said, \u201cLet's wait a while and\nsee what happens.\u201d Little did I know that she had, she had poison that she carried with\nher and she kept it for the last minute, if necessary. I found that out when we got to\nRavensbruek and we stayed in line to go into the bath house and she asked me while we\n\u00ae Armia Krajowa [Home Army] (Polish).\nwere staying in line if, if I think that, is it time or not yet? And I said, \u201cOh, let's wait and\nsee,\u2019 and by the time we got in and we were ordered to strip and give everything away,\nshe didn't have it anymore.",
        "A: Oh, yes.",
        "A: Yeah, well, in Pruszkow we were put on trains, and these were cattle trains, all closed,\nlocked with tiny little window and we were taken -- I don't know if it was 10 days, two\nweeks, 12 days -- it was day after day after day and night after night. We were taken and\nwe stopped on the railroad, on side roads. Many times there was an air attack and the\ntrain had to stop. We had reached one camp near, near Berlin. I forgot the name of the\ncamp. that rumors were we were going to stay there and then we didn't stay there and\nagain with the train until we reached Ravensbruek, yeah. Of course, the conditions were\nterrible, you know. Hardly anything, but we made it, and in Ravensbruek we stayed in\nline. We were political prisoners. We were not Jews. We were political prisoners and we\nwere standing in line registering our names and given out numbers. We were asked age\nand, of course, they looked us over and I said that I was 18. I was lying about my name\nso I was also lying about my age. I wanted to be with Pepi. Pepi I think was in her 30s.\nSo I got a number and there was a red triangle made of cloth with the letter \u201cP\u201d on it for\npolitical prisoner. The red was for political prisoner and on a white cloth was my number,\n74073. And she was 704 -- 4074. I don't remember whether it was, she was first or I was\nfirst. I think I was first, and we got consecutive numbers and from then on we had no\nnames, just numbers, and then we went to the bath house. We -- as I said they took away\nour clothes.\nWe had to strip. Everybody was shaved. I don't know by what miracle Pepi and I were\nnot shaved. Until today I have no answer. Somebody told me that the majority of people\nhad lice. I don't believe it because this is not why you were shaved but they did not shave\nher. They did not shave me. They left my long hair and when we went to the baths, we\nreally expected to die. We really did, and we said, \u201cWell, we could have taken the poison\nbut it's gone and it probably won't take longer with being gassed.\u201d Well, we were very\nsurprised when water came. And we, we really got a shower. There was even this gray\nsoap that looked like pumice stone but a little softer. But 1t was not gas, so we took the\nshowers and we went out on the other end of the building and we were given the striped\nuniforms and then I understood why we wanted to take the poison before we went in\nbecause each group that went in ahead of us, we never saw them coming out. We didn't\nrecognize them. They were shaved and wearing stripes. So then when we got stripes and\nwere getting sizes that are impossible, a big person would get a tiny dress, a tiny, tiny\nperson would get a big dress, but we came out alive and we had our numbers and a\ntriangle and we were assigned to barracks. When we came into the barracks, we saw on\nthe wall Jewish writing, names, messages, many of it in Yiddish which I couldn't read,\nbut Pepi could and she told me they were names. She read them to me and I, I could\nunderstand. I just couldn't read or write, and she told me there were messages, very, very\nheartbreaking messages and names of the people: \u201cWe...we were here. We\u2019re the last.\nTell others to remember us.\u201d It, it was very sad, but we were ushered to those barracks\nand we were not killed. We, we had these straw mattresses, three in a row high and we\nstayed there until they sent us to another camp.",
        "A: Well, I have to figure 1t out. We went to Ravensbruek at the last day of the Polish revolt\nwhich was October, November, and in Ravensbruek we must have been, December,\nDecember, January, and then we were, we were sent to a camp in a forest Wildbou near\nBrandenburg.",
        "A: Yes, but a short time and then I was staying longer in the other camp, in the in the forest.",
        "A: Ravensbruek was a very huge camp and there were inmates from many, many nations. In\nthe short stay I could notice truck-fulls of bodies -- how skinny, just bones and skin,\nbodies, dead bodies. They had, they had a place where they hung people. I did not\nwitness any, any hangings but they, they had a place and I could see the trucks going\nback and forth with bodies here and bodies there. We did not do much over there. We\nwere then transported to another camp. And that was in a forest and it was a smaller\ncamp, and we were building this railroad tracks for, for a narrow or a short distance train.\nIt was very cold. We were marched every morning, after what we call Apell\u2019 time. We\nwere marched to work. Were putting the, the railroad tracks and the ties and while we\nwere doing that, while we were marching, we were guarded by SS people, men and\nwomen with dogs and when we got there they would, we would make a fire so they could\nstay and keep warm while we were working and worked. Towards the evenings, we were\ncoming back and we would get watery soup, or water, whatever. In that camp was really\nbad.\n? Roll call (German).\nThe, the, the SS men and the SS women, they were beating everybody they could see and\nthe, the terrain was wet. They would put people face down and, and just stomp on them\nand beat them. I saw once thing like that. After this railroad thing, one day I was\ntransferred to another barr- to a barrack where they had a factory and they told me they\nare parts for airplanes, but all I saw was little screws or little small items that you had to\npunch holes in and they told us how to do it, so I immediately asked if my mother could\ncome, too. It was really not safe to do that, but I did and they said, \u201cYes,\u201d so Pepi and I\nwere brought, worked in that factory and she was working there testing. You have to test\nif they are good or bad, and most of them were bad, really, but we had to, we had to\nproduce something because the foreman tried to be nice to, to us, not to beat us or\nanything, and we all tried to back him up and he had some quota to fulfill. If there is so\nand so much bad output, then he would be punished, so I remember Pepi was telling me\nthat she was checking and she was saying, \u201cMake good ones, make bad ones, whatever.\u201d\nAnd we worked there 12 hours a day.",
        "A: Not the guards, the, the, the managers of it, yeah.",
        "A: Yes, yes. It so happened that during all this time that I met Pepi, she tried to protect me\nand I tried to protect her. She lost her own child and apparently she felt she wanted to\nhelp. She, she was an outstanding person. To describe her, I probably couldn't. That's\nhow good she was, and for everybody to everybody -- to humanity. On my side, she, she\nhad dark hair, brown eyes, and she looked Jewish. I don't know what it means to look\nJewish but that's what the stereotype is, look Jewish. On the other hand, I didn't very\nmuch. And I felt that in this respect if I say she's my mother, she will gain from it. I could\nhave made a mistake. I don't know. I think this was behind my thinking and it worked\nsomehow. So we were there, and, and being together with somebody you care for was\nexcellent. At the evening, Pepi would teach me history, math, and she would talk to me\nabout her husband, who might be alive. By the way, she found him after the war. He\nsurvived, yes. And Pepi was teaching me a lot. We, we didn't have a piece of paper or a\npencil, but she would teach me a French song or geography, explaining things. It helped a\nlot. It helped a lot. I, I felt real good, and when you when you feel good, you're with\nsomebody, you care for somebody, it makes you feel good; and Pepi cared for everybody,\nPepi cared for everybody. One day I saw Pepi doesn't eat her portion of bread and I said,\n\u201cWhat you -- ?\u201d She says, \u201cI was hungry. I ate already.\u201d No she didn't. There was a Pani\nArova who was very, very sick. A wife of a Polish major who we knew from Zoliborz,\nwhere we worked in the restaurant. I think she lived in the same apart- building. Pepi\nfound her and since she was elderly, Pepi gave her her portion of bread, but she wouldn't\ntell me about it, and sure enough when I found out I said, \u201cThen we'll share mine,\u201d and\nshe said \u201cNo, you're a young child. You have to survive.\u201d I mean, I had problems with,\nwith this that she would give away everything to everybody.\nShe was just fantastic. What a human being. I'm not the only one who, who gained by her\nbeing around, who gained so much of everything, of understanding, of love, of helping\nothers. She was just fantastic. So then we were in the camp and we heard some rumors\nthat the war is coming closer. But we didn't know anything. This foreman apparently he\nalso felt that Pepi was a nice and a good person, a worthwhile. He somehow let her know\nthat things are going better for us. In other words, things are not going so good for the\nGermans, and at one time he gave her a piece of paper and a pencil so that she could\nteach me something. She wanted to teach me something to write and, and he, he did that,\nbut we had to give it back right away, so we knew that something is, 1s happening, but we\ndidn't know what. And, and the hope was really making us imagine better things, so one\nday -- it must have been again in March or April, in March, I think, March of '45 -- they\nput us in trains and they sent us to so-called \u201cFree work.\u201d Each one was assigned to some\ndeserving German family or on a farm to work and this, Pepi and I we were assigned to\ntwo villages not far from each other in the northern part of Germany near Rostock. I was\nin Kulingsborn, and she was in Bornhagen. And we were there until May, I think, 5. We\nwere liberated by the Russians, who didn't believe that we did not cooperate with the\nGermans. It, it was hard for them to understand because we were working here on, for a\nfamily or for a farmer so they, they just didn't believe that about a month or six weeks\nago we were taken out of, of concentration camps and, and put there for whatever reason,\nI don't know. And that's where we, we were liberated.",
        "A: Well, Pepi made out. Pepi made out little, called a little -- a travel document, in Russian,\nand she put some stamps, different colors rubber stamps that mean nothing in German or\nwhatever, whatever she could find in the farmer's, in the farmer's place and the, the\nRussian that occupied the farm that she was, they stayed there. They made it a\nheadquarters, and in a couple of days I came running to her because where I was, was\nterrible, so I stayed with her and she made out those papers and she told the Russians that\nwe want to go back home. One of them, quite an intelligent fellow, he says, \u201cWell, why\ndon't you go to Russia. Your daughter will go to school and, and you'll be fine and I'll\nwrite to my commandant to, to arrange for you.\u201d So Pepi asked me, \u201cDo you want to go\nto Russia?\u201d I said, \u201cNo. I, I want to go home and see if I can find somebody alive.\u201d So\nshe, she said, \u201cWe'll have to think about it, want to see who 1s alive.\u201d And they said \u201cOh,\nyou can find out from there, too. Just go to Russia.\u201d Anyway, Pepi got some kind of a\ncarriage that took us, horse and buggy, that took us out and with those papers that she\nprepared, we got ourselves to Berlin. And when we got to Berlin there was a a Jewish\noffice on Rikostrasse (ph), a Jewish office where there were DPs, and we went there to\nregister to, to say that, \u201cWe're alive, we're here, and what next?\u201d And the funniest thing\nhappened: when I when I was interviewed by the interviewer on Rikostrasse in Berlin, he\ndidn't want to believe that that I was Jewish.\nI had problems convincing him, but I could prove it. I could prove it with the names and,\nand what little I knew. It was, the names of my family and, and we had a conversa- a\nlengthy conversation \u2018til, \u2018til he believed me. And we stayed in Berlin for a while. That\nwas another chapter that was very heartbreaking, however, nobody was getting killed and\nthat was the good part. And the Allies brought some food and some clothing and people\nwere looking for each other. It was just like drunk with freedom. Everybody was drunk\nwith freedom but looking, \u201cWho...who 1s alive? What do we do?\u201d But this was the good\npart of it. The bad part of it is that I didn't find anybody when I tried to go back. Tried to\ngo back and, and didn't find anybody. That was bad. Later on I found my father's brother\nin England with his family. I found my youngest uncle in Israel who went there before\nthe war as a khalutz,'\u00b0 and then I found that my Aunt Esther and her husband who was in\nRussia survived, and then they found little Jacek, and they came to Israel as a family.\nAnd that was something out of this world.",
        "A: I, I was 1n Berlin, as I said, with Pepi, and we met there. Actually Pepi, she saw all kinds\nof people from, from the Jewish community and they were also American Jews, English\nJews, French and Russian -- in all the armies. That was before Berlin was, was divided by\na wall; it was all open. And Pepi, as usual, decided to, to help out others, so she had me\ndo things to help out others and people who came let's say from Russia or from a camp,\nneeded to stay over or go somewhere or get some clothes, being sent being sent wherever\nthey wanted to. So the majority wanted to go to, to the west. Pepi was there to help. Oh,\nyeah, Pepi was there to help, and being with her you couldn't help but help others. It was\ngreat to be able to do something that you wanted to do, to be able to say, \u201cYes, you can\ngo. You're free. Where do you want to go? You can go. You're hungry, here\u2019s food,\u201d you\nknow? There was a Jewish holiday where they had in Berlin. I'll never forget that. Pepi\ninvited all the Jewish people from all the armies. She says, \u201cI don't care if they are the\nFrench Army, the Russian Army, the American -- it's a Jewish holiday.\u201d\n'\u00a9 Pioneer (Hebrew).\nThey all came together and what a meal. I think each one brought something with them\nbecause we didn't have much and we had candles and they prayed, and it was a holiday. I\nmean, that was after all the, the things that we went through, there was a real Jewish\nholiday which was celebrated. I couldn't communicate with most of them. Learned a little\nRussian in concentration camp, but Pepi knew languages, but it didn't matter. You could\ncommunicate. And you could help. And that was great. It was great. It was like ecstasy.\nIt's just later on that everything comes out, when you find out that you don't have\nanybody anymore and it settles in. I find that we all carry with us, the survivors I mean,\nwe carry with us a certain something. I can't put my finger on a certain part in our brain\nthat is different from everybody else in the world who did not go through what we did. I\nthink that I can recognize a survivor probably from across the street, or at least when we\nexchange a few words. There is something about us that I don't find in any other people;\nmaybe the, the sad look in their eyes or maybe some expressions. I don't know what it 1s.\nAnd we all carry that and many times our children do that, too. they, although they didn't\ngo through the things we did, they're a part of it. They suffer from not having uncles and\naunts and cousins. They suffer because their parents are overly protective. They suffer\nfrom it. They do it. I get a phone call from my kids every week, whether I need it or not,\nbecause I can't live otherwise. This is, this is the leftover from, from knowing where they\nare, knowing that they are all right. I wish I could change, but I can't. They have to\nunderstand that that's what I need. They do understand it but it's, it's an imposition on\npeople. People shouldn't have to do that. So, my generation and our children, they carry\nthe burden. Hopefully, we won\u2019t have that thing happen again and, and the grandchildren\nwill not need to, to carry the burden. They, they can learn from history what happened so,\nso they can prevent it in the future, but they shouldn't need to carry a burden. Nobody\nshould.",
        "A: Oh, well, I got to Bergen-Belsen after the war finished. We start off in Berlin where Pepi\nand I stayed and helped. And, of course, there were for Pepi, helped in a in a orphanage\nand tried, at that time there were, the British wanted to take the orphans out to the British\nzone. They started making the zones, French zone, British zone, you know, and Pepi\nregistered me in the orphanage, and I went to the orphanage so that one day the British\ncame with a truck and they told us to sit down in the truck and they took us out. What I\ndidn't know then which I found out later was that some authority got -- found out that\nPepi's helping many DPs and even some soldiers from, from a different army who did not\nallow their people to, to move, but they wanted to, to go. And she was helping and\nsomehow they found out and they came looking for her at night and she ran away. She\nknew that she was being hunted at that time, so she sent me away.",
        "A: Oh, we were taken first, first we were taken, I think we stopped at Hanover. We stopped\nat Hanover, and then we were taken to Bergen-Belsen, or was it the other way around? I\ncan't remember.",
        "A: Bergen-Belsen was another orphanage, and I was just talking to -- it was Block RB-6 was\nthe orphanage where there were some orphans and they brought us in to together so that\nthey could care for us. And, of course, many people were ecstatic, they found each other\nbut I couldn't find anybody I knew. I didn't know too many people before the war started\nand so I couldn't find many people and they cared for us very well in Bergen-Belsen, but\nit was all after the war. It, 1t was -- the burden was already there.",
        "A: Yes, yes. That's where I met Hadassah, right.",
        "A: Hadassah Rosensaft. Well, at that time, when I was in Bergen-Belsen, her name was Dr.\nBimko, and there was a gentleman by the name of Yasala (ph) Rosensaft, and they were\ncaring for the DPs, the displaced persons. I know that much, and I remember they got\nmarried. However, I did not -- I wasn't there apparently when their son was born. I found\nthat out much later. And we kept in touch throughout the years but not very close and not\nvery often. Her ways were, were different from mine although we lived also in Manhattan\nafterwards. I had two children to raise. I had a job and our ways are not the same but\nwhenever there was something going on where survivors meet, she was there and I was\nthere and somehow, even if we didn't talk or we just acknowledged, we were there. It's\nfunny. We were there --",
        "A: I came to the United States in November of 1955.",
        "A: My dear husband, Ike.",
        "A: Oh.",
        "A: Ok, well, from Bergen-Belsen a short, short trip, we\u2019re sent to Blankenese, which 1s\nanother place for the orphans. From Blankenese, we went to Marseilles where we\nboarded a ship, Champolion, that brought us to Egypt. Now Hadassah was on it. I didn't\nknow that because my Pepi was putting in on Champoulyan. Pepi was adding people who\ndidn't have any papers. Approximately 10 before us went up, went on board before I was\nallowed to board it, so many, many illegal -- but we, we got there, and it was impossible\nto see each other on the, on the ship. Many people and overloaded and all that, but we\nmade the trip and we got there. And as Hadassah explained, we were divided into three\ngroups. Each one went to a different kibbutz. We were studying. We were working and\nwe were also semi-drafted, ala cub scouts, except we were trained with rifles and, and\ngrenades and night, night exercise, combat exercise. then of course we had the War of\nIndependence. After the War of Independence, I went to England to see my uncle, my\nfather's brother, and he wanted to adopt me but I wanted to go back to Israel. And when I\ncame back from Israel, I met Ike whom I married two years later.",
        "A: We came to the United States with Ike and with a little 18-month old son, and Ike's\nparents were here in New York. We lived with them and then with another little boy born\nin New York City in Mt. Sinai Hospital, right. And that's the story.",
        "A: Never thought about it, what the effect is on me. My children and my husband, they tell\nme that I'm a strong lady and I think that if it is true, then this would be one result. The\neffect is that I am probably overly sensitive to people's opinions, to people's behavior,\nand I'm constantly on the watch about safety, about wars, about slanderous talking. I'm\nmore sensitive to that, I think, as a result. I also find that telling your story and telling\nwhat you feel towards people, which is mainly good stuff, love, people are good if they\nknow it but if they are fed different information and they don't know any better, they can't\nbehave any better. I, I feel that that I can, that I can explain or like people more than I\ncould before the war. I'm closer to, to everybody, to the whole world because of it. I'm\nalso watchful. I think all this 1s, is the result from, from what I went through my life.\nWe're all, we're all products of our past, and I think that's what the past did to me. Good,\nbad, indifferent, I don't know. That\u2019s just me.",
