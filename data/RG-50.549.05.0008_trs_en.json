        "Q: ...and we\u2019re with Emilie Szekely in her home in Lexington, Kentucky. And my name is Arwen\nDonahue and we\u2019re going to be conducting an interview today about... well, we\u2019ll see how far\nwe get. We\u2019re going to start with the birth and move on from there. And I just wanted to note\nfor those who are listening to this tape, that there was an interview done with Mrs. Szekely by\nthe Survivors of the Shoah Foundation in 1996 and we may be repeating some things that were\ndiscussed in that interview, but there may be some things that were discussed in that interview\nthat we won\u2019t talk about today. So, Mrs. Szekely, why don\u2019t we start with you telling me your\nname at birth and your date of birth and where you were born?",
        "A: I was born in Hungary, Budapest, in 1920, 16th of February, in Budapest.",
        "Q: And your name at birth?",
        "A: Klugman.",
        "Q: Klugman.",
        "A: Klugman.",
        "Q: KLUGMAN?",
        "A: Yeah, and in Russia they are writing, my cousin is Klegman, because \u201cu\u201d in Russia is \u201ce\u201d. So\nhe\u2019s writing a \u201cu\u2019, but he\u2019s calling himself Klegman. But it is Klugman. Klugman, you know\nwhat this means in German?",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: German, Klug is \u201csmart\u201d, man. [Laughing] That\u2019s the name. He was a smart man. I showed\nyou their pictures. No?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: My parents\u2019 pictures.",
        "Q: Now was your father, you mentioned in the other interview that your father was Russian. Did he\nhave... of German extraction? Or, what was his...",
        "A: The name is Klugman from Russia and there are a lot of Klugmans there. So I don\u2019t know how\nit came, where it, how, but he was born in Kiev. And his family was in Kiev until the First\nWorld War... Second World War. I\u2019m sorry. Then they had to run, because the Germans were\nthere. Whoever was left from the family. He had two sisters and a brother there. The other\nbrother was already on the front. And they had to run. So I never knew about it. A cousin who\ncame five years ago to America, the painter, he was telling me the whole story. Why and how\nthey had to run. And they went past Odessa and they lived in a small village in a house, he said,\nwhat didn\u2019t have floor. It was nothing, just dust on the floor. And they managed to escape, but\nthey had very, very hard times. His parents were alive that time, but the father and the mother,\nthey all died. Actually they say that it was from hunger they died, but I don\u2019t know actually\nwhat was the reason they died, because they had very, very hard times. And after that my\ncousin, who had his mother... no, I\u2019m sorry. The cousin, he has a sister, who is very, very sick.\nShe\u2019s here too, in Boston. And him and the sister and the husband, and she had a daughter the\nsame age as George is and a son, they settled down in Odessa. So, when the doors were opening\nhere that the Russians can come, he didn\u2019t think about it. He was just writing me, \u201cSave my\ndaughter,\u201d who lived in Moscow and had two little children. I told you that story. No?",
        "Q: I don\u2019t think so.",
        "A: She had two little, beautiful daughters and her husband was Jewish. And she was a half-Jew,\nbecause her mother wasn\u2019t Jewish. And the mother was a practicing Russian Orthodox, so she, I\nthink she brainwashed her. But she\u2019s supposed to come to America, too. She was on the quota,\ntoo. In fact, they are still bothering me that, \u201cWhere is she?\u201d I says, \u201cMany times, I\u2019ve told you\nthat she won\u2019t come, never. Please cross her off because she is taking somebody\u2019s place.\u201d They\nlived with the husband\u2019s mother, whose husband died, he was injured in the war. I don\u2019t know, I\nthink he lost his leg. He went underground with the Russians. I don\u2019t know that whole story, but\nI know that they had an apartment in Moscow and the son lived with the mother. He went to\nschool in Moscow and he 1s an engineer. She, he met my cousin in school, who went for\nengineering, too. Civil engineers. They met there and he knew that she\u2019s half-Jew, but she\npromised him everything, everything what you want. If they are going to have children they are\ngoing to be brought up as Jews. And then she hated Communism, she just couldn\u2019t stand it. I\ndidn\u2019t know why, but when I found out it was too late already. Because she couldn\u2019t go to\nchurch. So they came to America. The first Hanukkah, the television came here to our house\nand took pictures from them, because they were here for the first Hanukkah. So they are here,\nthey were here for six years. Now it was my husband\u2019s, my son\u2019s birthday, November 20\", they\ncame Six years ago.",
        "Q: So they came to Lexington? Or...?",
        "A: They came to Lexington. I was fighting for them that they should come here, because I didn\u2019t\nhave... only parents should bring children. But the mother had a brother in Brooklyn and the\nbrother wanted them to go to Brooklyn. And I got his name and I spoke to him and I said,\n\u201cLook, I know that you love your sister, but the children, they would be much, much better off\nhere in Lexington to bring up children.\u201d Finally he gave in and the Federation did it for me.\nThey brought them here. They were waiting for them with a three-bedroom apartment, because\nthe two mothers should come after them. So, they had a three-bedroom apartment. And the\ntelevision was on the airport, when the first families came. It was a big deal. And Ana was out\nof her mind that she will have some relatives...",
        "Q: Ana is your granddaughter?",
        "A: Ana is the youngest. And there were two, young children, beautiful two children.",
        "Q: Can you say... before you go on, just, can you say how they\u2019re related to you? And what their\nnames are?",
        "A: My cousins...",
        "Q: Uh huh.",
        "A: My cousin\u2019s daughter, my first cousin, my father\u2019s brother\u2019s daughter.",
        "Q: Okay. And what was her name?",
        "A: Galina.",
        "Q: Galina...?",
        "A: Galina Bashikis (ph). Bashikis. My son, by coincidence got him a job with the Gray\nConstruction Company, because she had a student, he had a student in one of the schools, who\nwas his student and then she became a teacher. And he went back with his children there. He\ngoes always, one semester he takes his class to schools and they are... Adopt a School, that\u2019s the\nname of it. And they are teaching there, but they are just students, not graduate students and he\u2019s\nobserving them before they make their lesson plans and they have to show it to him. And he\u2019s\nrunning from class to class. And one day, she came to that school and she said, \u201cDoes anybody\nknow somebody who has connections to a construction company?\u201d And that teacher, he says,\n\u201cMy fiance,\u201d one of the Grays\u2019 son. He says, \u201cMy fianc\u00e9.\u201d So, from that time on they hired\nhim, and he\u2019s a person who, he didn\u2019t mind what kind of job they gave him. He did very hard\njob. And he loves the construction. He loves to see. He was in, I don\u2019t know how many\nbuildings he builded. He was already a big shot there. When they got their visa to come to\nAmerica. And he work day and night for an apartment in Moscow. In the middle of Moscow\nthe apartment was ready and they would be separated from the mother-in-law. And they would\nhave a beautiful apartment there. And the visa was starting to expire, so my cousin said, \u201cIt 1s\nnot worth, what is thousands of thousands dollars that apartment. It doesn\u2019t worth, you have to\ngo.\u201d He was in Odessa, but he helped them. He came to Moscow and helped them to pack and\nthey came. And she was very happy. And when she got to the apartment she couldn\u2019t believe it.\nYou know, they lived in two small rooms there, so many people, four. I mean two children and\nthe couple and the grandmother. And she was very happy. One day... she sent, before she\ncame, she sent a hundred and twenty packages to my name, because she didn\u2019t know where to\nsend it and they were all Russian books. And I said, \u201c\u201cThat woman is crazy. She needs American\nbooks. Why is she sending the Russian books?\u201d But all, you know, Dostoevsky, whatever. The\nchildren, the big one... the little one didn\u2019t go to school yet, but the big one went to school, to\nthe same school where my husband got the job from the teacher. It was in their neighborhood.\nAnd she spoke beautiful English already and she had... when the grandmother came the\nfollowing year in January, his mother came. She didn\u2019t come, the other one. And she was\nhelping her and she was translating and answering the telephone. And then I started to see it. I\nstarted to invite them for holidays, and she came. She sat at the table five minutes and after five\nminutes she excused herself and went to the porch to play with the children. I didn\u2019t think about\nnothing, about it. I says, \u201cIt\u2019s a little strange, but okay if she wants it.\u201d When it come the second\nyear, she said, \u201cI love you, but please don\u2019t invite us for the holidays.\u201d Still I didn\u2019t think it was\nsomething wrong there. Then she met a couple, I still don\u2019t know who they are, a Christian\ncouple, who went every week to Cincinnati. And she got very friendly with them. And she went\nwith the two children and the reason was, because she went for his American degree, what he\ngot, no problem. He got his American degree, but when the children are home, he cannot study.\nAnd we go there. It\u2019s more things to do there. We take them to the zoo and blah, blah, blah.\nOne day they come home, it was probably a year later and the father is asking them, \u201cHow was\nthe zoo?\u201d And the big one said, \u201cWhat kind of zoo?\u201d He says, \u201cYou didn\u2019t go to the zoo?\u201d She\nsays. \u201cNo, we went to the church.\u201d So he got very upset that she does it behind his back. Very,\nvery upset. And I don\u2019t know whether they knew it... he was married eleven years, but they\nknew each other five years already from the school. And I don\u2019t know the situation, because the\ngrandmother was there with them. But he was traveling a lot. The company was sending him\nconstantly, because they mostly work outside from Lexington. They build big, big factories, not\nhousing. And he was always sent out. One, two years after they were here, she says, \u201cI want to\ngo home for the summer, to visit my mother.\u201d I says, \u201cIsn\u2019t 1t easier to bring your mother here?\u201d\nShe says, \u201cNo, my mother wouldn\u2019t like it here.\u201d She packed. And she liked me. She was\nworking in the St. Joseph Hospital, though she was an engineer and she went for courses to...\ncomputer courses to the community college. But that job, cleaning job, she took at night, that\nshe should be with the children during the day. What was the job? She was calling me on the\nphone constantly for hours. She says, \u201cI am cleaning the clean stuff, the offices...\u201d and she says,\n\u201cIt\u2019s... in an hour I am ready.\u201d Perfect. Salary was perfect, everything was perfect. Two years,\nright two years after in the summer, 1t was August. And sometimes I was taking her, I was\ndriving her to work. They didn\u2019t live close here, but I picked her up. They lived in, it\u2019s Heritage\nVillage, near Henry Clay High School. That\u2019s where all the Russians lived at that time. I\u2019m\nsorry. I picked her up and I took her to work. And she says, \u201cI want to tell you something,\nbecause I love you. But you must swear that you won\u2019t tell it to Mischa.\u201d Mischa, Michael is\nher husband. I thought, \u201cMy God what it could be that I cannot tell it to him?\u201d So, I says,\n\u201cOkay, I swear.\u201d And I am driving. I almost made an accident what I heard. She says, \u201cI\u2019m not\ncoming back. I took a ticket, round trip, but I\u2019m not coming back. I don\u2019t want my children to\nbe brought up here. I want them to be brought up as Russians,\u201d and it meant... because she\nnever mentioned Jew. She mentioned Americans and Russians. I says, \u201cYou are talking about\nAmericans as Jews and Russians,\u201d right away I knew, \u201c...as the Russian Orthodox Church?\u201d\nShe says, \u201cNo, no. I don\u2019t mean that.\u201d I says, \u201cYes you mean it. You mean it.\u201d The husband\nwas... I don\u2019t know where. And he came home, and it was the little one\u2019s birthday. And she\nmade a birthday party and I was there. And they\u2019re supposed to leave the following day to New\nYork. And the father, who lived in Boston, was visiting... we have a summer home in the\ncountry, in the Catskills and he was with my son there. And he\u2019s supposed to go to the airport,\nhelp her to go to the airport in New York. So, I said to myself, I just couldn\u2019t believe it. I says,\n\u201cWhy are you doing it? How can you look in your husband\u2019s eye and pack?\u201d I don\u2019t know,\neverything she took, what she could. Six packages, because they took two, two, two, everyone\nof them and they were little kids. She says, \u201cIf he would be better to me...\u201d I says, \u201cBetter? He\nlives for you. He\u2019s such a father and working like unbelievable that you should have everything.\nAnd you say better?\u201d Better was that he didn\u2019t let them go to church. That was the worst. And\nshe told it in the hospital that if I don\u2019t come back, because my husband is bad to me. So, what\nshall Ido? I swore. I cannot tell it to Mischa. I called my cousin in the country. I says, \u201cLook,\nI swore that I don\u2019t tell 1t to Mischa, but I didn\u2019t swear that I\u2019m not telling it to you. Your\ndaughter won\u2019t come back. Please don\u2019t help her to go on that plane. At least the children\nshould be saved and taken away, because she kidnapped them.\u201d She said, \u201cThat\u2019s... it\u2019s\nimpossible. It\u2019s impossible.\u201d And when she didn\u2019t come back after a month, she went for a\nmonth, and I said, I told it to Mischa. She says, \u201cI don\u2019t believe you. She\u2019s the most honest\nwoman in the world. If you would tell it to me right at that time, I wouldn\u2019t believe you, that she\nis doing it to me.\u201d And she did it. She kidnapped the two kids.",
        "Q: Tell me, Mischa was the one who\u2019s actually related to you?",
        "A: No. She.",
        "Q: She\u2019s the one who\u2019s actually related to you.",
        "A: She is my cousin\u2019s. But I am... they have no one here. He has a brother, he\u2019s in Australia. And\nhe is here now with his mother. He doesn\u2019t want to hear about it, to get married, because he\nlives for his children. I says, \u201cMischa, you are a smart man. You lost your children.\u201d Every\nweek, he is calling them on the phone. And two years ago, she let them come here for a month.\nThey came alone by plane. And she came the last two weeks, because my cousin was begging\nher from Boston, that \u201cMaybe I see you the last time. I am in not a good condition and please\ncome.\u201d She came. Before they came, he bought a house. They lived in an apartment. They\nbought the house, that the children should have separated rooms. It\u2019s a three-bedroom house\nnear Man O\u2019War. A new house. He makes nice money, so he could, he got the mortgage. And\nthe children they have their rooms and they have their beds there what I bought them that time.\nThe mattresses were brand new. And they have their... and even today, it\u2019s they name on the\ndoor. They put they name on the door. What... where do they have it in Moscow? They have\ntwo bathrooms. They give one to the children. And they live like princesses here. They loved\nit.",
        "Q: Let me ask you a couple of questions, so I can make sure I\u2019m understanding. She converted...\ndid she convert from Judaism to Russian Orthodoxy?",
        "A: She wasn\u2019t.",
        "Q: She was raised as a Russian...",
        "A: She was raised nothing, because it was Communism. She couldn\u2019t be raised with religion. But\nwhen Gorbachev took over they were allowed to go to the church. And when she saw it, she\nalready didn\u2019t want to come to America. She was the one who broke, broke, completely broke\noff the family. She wanted to come. She was the one. And she was telling me that she thought\nthat she wouldn\u2019t come anymore, but she said, \u201cThat\u2019s not the right thing to do. That\u2019s not an\nhonest thing to do, that I started it and I should let them go.\u201d But that was an honest thing what\nshe did. You know? She wanted it. She wanted to come because of the church, because she\ncouldn\u2019t go to church there. They have here a Greek Orthodox, but that\u2019s not good for her.\nAnyway.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s rewind a little bit. We started getting onto this because you were talking about your family\nthat was in Russia. And you didn\u2019t know any of that family other than your father\u2019s brother?\nDuring the war or before?",
        "A: No, I knew before the war about the whole family, because when my father was alive they\ncorresponded constantly. And we, from Czechoslovakia, because I was brought up in\nCzechoslovakia, we sent them food. So, I knew they exist. And I remember when my\ngrandmother died, my father\u2019s mother, because I remember how he was crying. I was about, I\ndon\u2019t know, eight years old. And I remember when she died. I don\u2019t remember when the father\ndied. And I knew about him very well, because he speaks... no. Then my uncle was writing him\nconstantly...",
        "Q: Your uncle was writing who?",
        "A: Writing to him. My uncle was my father\u2019s brother, to whom I wanted to come to America. He\nwas a pharmacist. And he came with the last ship in 1940 to America. And then he was writing\nhim. And after 50 years, 50 years, he went back to visit. And he was telling me about...",
        "Q: I\u2019m sorry, but you\u2019re talking about... he was writing to whom? To his father? When you said\nyour uncle was writing to him, who was he writing to?",
        "A: To Izzy, his name is Izzy, my cousin who is the painter. He was writing to him and then he went\nto visit. And he had two sisters, two sisters alive at the time and him, who was the nephew. He\nwas alive. So, after 50 years. He went back twice, because he went alone and then he took his\nwife one year. And so, I knew everything about him. And I knew that he was a big artist there,\nbut he worked for the state, Communism. They always had work, but they had to do what they\ntold them to do. So, he was a real artist and then he had a little studio separate from the house.\nAnd he painted what he wanted, because his dream... he loves Odessa and he wanted to paint\nOdessa as he knew it once. And he did it. They didn\u2019t know about it, because he did the\ncommercials for everything, for the ships and for operas and everything. His name was\neverywhere because he did the commercials. So, I knew about him. Now, when my uncle died\nin 1973, I took over the writing because it was no one else. And I started to write Russian, but it\nwas very hard for me, because I never spoke Russian. But I wrote Russian and I understood\nRussian. So, with the dictionary, I wrote him Russian. And one day, he said, \u201cDon\u2019t struggle, I\nspeak English.\u201d And from then on, I was sending him English letters. And then he had an\nexhibition in Moscow and he was narrating it in English. And he sent us the tape. And we\ncouldn\u2019t use the tape here. I had to take it to downtown. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s the name of the\nplace. Anyway, where they re-did it. It was a beautiful... I gave it to him when he came. I gave\nit back to him. I says, \u201cI have you, and I have your paintings, and you should have that tape.\u201d\nAnd I read in the Hadassah paper, last month, that his paintings are still... somebody, you know\nthey have articles about the world, travelers and it was from Odessa and they mentioned his\nname, that his paintings are still there, but he\u2019s not there anymore. So, that was my Russian\nfamily.",
        "Q: Okay, tell me your father\u2019s full name and...",
        "A: Mikhail, he was Michael, Mikhail Klugman, because we never knew Klegman. Klugman.\nMikhail Klugman.",
        "Q: And tell how he came to leave Russia.",
        "A: He was from First World War... it is not on the tape? No.",
        "Q: It is, but I have more questions.",
        "A: In First World War there were two brothers. The older brother was already in the war in 1914,\nbefore....1914, yeah. And he was a pharmacist, too. Both of them were pharmacists. And he\nwas captured and they didn\u2019t know about him, where is he. And one day, when my father was\ncalled in and he was captured in Prague and they took him behind the frontier to a pharmacy and\nthere he meets his brother. And he met his brother and they never separated. They didn\u2019t want\nto go back after the war because there were the biggest pogroms in Kiev and they didn\u2019t want to\ngo back there. And it was an international agreement that they can stay in the countries where\nthey were captured. Hungary, Austria, Czechoslovakia was one, Austro-Hungarian empire. So,\nafter a while when they were there, they took them to Hungary to a chemical factory, both of\nthem, together. I have, I think there\u2019s a picture there, too, about them in Russia uniforms. They\ntook them to Hungary and under the war my mother was working there in the office, in that\nplace. And that\u2019s how they met and fell in love. And my mother\u2019s family was very, very upset.\nNothing against him, it was nothing against him, but they were very worried that he\u2019s a Russian\ncitizen, what\u2019s going to be? From then on, I think it\u2019s there. No?\nEnd of Tape 1, Side A\nTape 1, Side B",
        "Q: First actually, can you say what your father\u2019s brother\u2019s name was?",
        "A: Jacob Klugman.",
        "Q: And so they are living nearby one another and they ended up in Czechoslovakia.",
        "A: Yes, because they had to, because it was Communism in 1919 in Hungary for a little while only\nand they said that no matter what, every Russian is a Communist, Jew or non-Jew. And they put\n\u2014 oh I have a picture here. It\u2019s very interesting. They made a concentration camp. They builded\nnear Russia... near Budapest and they put all the Russians there. My mother was married in\n1919, the beginning of 1919. And they put them there. They didn\u2019t know what\u2019s going to\nhappen to them. My uncle was there. He wasn\u2019t married. My mother had a cousin, who was a\nlawyer and he came there one day. It was already May, middle of 1919, because she was\npregnant with me. By the way, she got pregnant. She was pregnant with me. And she said, he\nsaid, \u201cYou can go out from here only one way, if you sign that you never come back to\nHungary.\u201d So, my mother, who was Hungarian, she had to sign that she never comes back to\nHungary. It was easy to sign it for my father and my uncle, but they had to sign it. So, where\nshould they go? In 1920, Czechoslovakia it was, the Czech map 1s Czech, Moravia, Slovakia,\nCarpathan. The Carpathan part, what was Hungary, after the war, the Czechs got it. My mother\nhad a second cousin there and when she heard about it, what happened, she says, \u201cCome to us.\u201d\nThey were well-to-do people. \u201cCome to us.\u201d So, they went there to Czechoslovakia. It was at\nthat time Czechoslovakia in 1920. When it came to me, to give birth, my mother got permission\nthrough that lawyer to go home and I was born in my grandmother\u2019s house, but they didn\u2019t have\nan apartment. They did have... they lived with those relatives, so they left me there with my\ngrandmother and my mother\u2019s sisters. She had three sisters. One of them was married, two were\nnot married and a brother, who was never married. He was a bachelor. Because my\ngrandmother was a widow when she was 34 years old, and she had five children. The son took\nover and he was working for the family. And that\u2019s why he never got married, until the sisters\ngot married and whatever. He was already 50 years old and he didn\u2019t get married. So we lived\nthere and 22 months after I was born, my mother was again \u2014 she was pregnant. She gave birth\nto my sister. The same thing happened. She went home with special papers and she was born\nthere in my grandmother\u2019s house. By that time they had already an apartment and they took me\ntogether with my little sister back to Czechoslovakia. So.",
        "Q: Okay. What was your sister\u2019s name?",
        "A: Anna. But she was two \u201cn\u2019s\u201d and she didn\u2019t want two \u201cn\u2019\u201d. My daughter-in-law, she didn\u2019t want\ntwo \u201cn\u2019\u201d. Not because of my sister, but she had a grandmother, whom she didn\u2019t like, and she\nwas Anna. So, that\u2019s why she\u2019s with one \u201cn\u2019\u2019, Ana, but she\u2019s named after my sister. And the big\none, Ilona. That\u2019s a real Hungarian name. She\u2019s named after my mother\u2019s youngest sister, who\nsaved my life. That\u2019s in there, I think. So, Ilona is named after her. And Jacob, the boy is\nnamed after my uncle, who was in America. But she has an uncle, too, my daughter-in-law.\nAnd she didn\u2019t want him to be named Jacob, because she didn\u2019t like \u2014 she doesn\u2019t like her\nfamily. That\u2019s the trouble here. She doesn\u2019t like her mother. She never got along with the\nmother. That\u2019s the big trouble and that\u2019s why she cannot get along with me because she doesn\u2019t\nwant to hear mother. Only she\u2019s the mother. And that\u2019s the problem. So. But we manage to\ngive his, the name Jacob, because she liked my uncle. She knew him and she liked him.",
        "Q: Tell me about your early childhood, and your earliest memories.",
        "A: I remember from kindergarten on. I went right away to Czech school. Kindergarten, elementary\nschool, gymnasium. I wanted to be a pharmacist. And they had two kind of... my father wanted\none of us, at least, to be a pharmacist. And we had two kinds of gymnasiums, very strict schools\nin Czechoslovakia. All the professors were from Prague. And there were two kinds, one where\nyou had to learn Latin, because every prescription was Latin and if you wanted to be a doctor or\npharmacist you had to go to that gymnasium. So I went to... both of us went. I don\u2019t even know\nwhat she wanted to be, because she was unbelievable smart, much smarter than I was. She was\nalways worried about me, my sister, because it was only 22 months between us. And when I\nwent to first class, I got whooping cough for six months. So I had to repeat the first class, so we\nwere always together. We sat together. Here they don\u2019t let you do it. We were always together\nand everybody thought that we were... I don\u2019t know. Because we were dressed the same and\nthey thought that we are twins, but we weren\u2019t because it was 22 months between us. But we\nwere together always in school. But she was a worrier always about me. I remember when she\nwoke me up in the morning and let me repeat the lesson plan, lesson, what we had to do, you\nknow. She was always worried about me. I was a good student, but to her it came very easy. To\nme, I had to work for it. And it was a very, very close family. I just, I cannot, cannot tell you.\nWhen they met, my father and mother on the street it was always like, you know, they were\nmarried yesterday. Very, very close. My mother was like a friend to us. With everything you\ncould go to my mother and ask everything what you wanted and you got the right answer. I was\na very, very naive girl, very naive. And one girl was once telling me that if you kiss somebody\nyou can get pregnant, that kind of a business. So I always went to my mother. I says, \u201cIs it\ntrue?\u201d I don\u2019t know what grade was it. But with everything...when I went on a date and I came\nhome, I went to their bedroom, I sat on the bed and I told them everything what happened. That\nkind of a close family we were. And that\u2019s why I cannot understand today\u2019s generation, because\nit was so different. When I said to my granddaughter that I went for, for four years I had a\nboyfriend, a boy friend, friend, nothing happened between us. And for one year, for one year, he\ndidn\u2019t even kiss me, because he said he\u2019s very afraid that if he\u2019s going to kiss me, I\u2019m going to\nleave him, because of my personality. He was an unbelievable, very, very beautiful boy and he\nleft a very wealthy girl because of me. He loved me very much, but I was so naive that I didn\u2019t\nthink that I love him. But it was a beautiful, wonderful feeling that every week he came. We\nmet twice a week, Saturday and Sunday. Every week he came and his hands were behind his\nback and he brought me \u2014 because he knew I loved the... what are the little blue flowers?",
        "Q: Forget-me-nots?",
        "A: Very, very little.",
        "Q: Forget-me-nots?",
        "A: They are not forget me... anyway...",
        "Q: Violets?",
        "A: Violets. Winter, summer, always, always when he came, he had the violets. And it was a\nwonderful feeling to know that you have someone to go out with to the movies. We had five\no\u2019clock teas there. It was a very nice place where young people got together. And then he\nstarted to be called to the Army. And when he was called to the Army he was somewhere\nalways close, so he eloped. He came home to see me on the weekends. And everybody was\ntelling me that he\u2019s looking at me like he loves me. And I was just laughing. I didn\u2019t realize it.\nI didn\u2019t realize it. After four years when I met my husband and he was already somewhere in\nRussia, somewhere in labor camp, him. And he wrote me and I wrote him. And I wrote him that\nwhat happened with my family and I\u2019m going to get married, because I need to change my name.\nAnd when I wrote that letter I thought I'd die. Then I knew that I loved him. That feeling, I\nnever, never forget. Such a naivete. Can you imagine that? Then I really...",
        "Q: What was his name?",
        "A: And he died. He died in Russia. He was Nicholas. He was Nicholas, actually it was Nicolash\n(ph) in Hungary. So it\u2019s Nicholas. They were a very wealthy family. His father had a pawn\nshop. And he had a sister, who was teaching piano. And we never spoke about marriage\nbecause he always said, he spoke already English at that time. And one day, in 1938, the\nHungarians took back that part of Czechoslovakia. So we were in trouble, but we children didn\u2019t\nrealize it that we are in trouble, only my parents. And it was terrible. And then he said to me,\none day when he came home, he says, \u201cCome with me to Israel.\u201d I looked at him. I says,\n\u201cWithout my parents?\u201d And it was no Israel, young people went to Palestine. Maybe he would\nbe alive, if he would gone. He wouldn\u2019t go without me. And I says, \u201cI cannot go without my\nparents.\u201d And he came back from some place. And we were always discussing other girls, and\nwho is the cute girl, who is the nice girl. And one day, I was already married, when I heard that\nhe engaged, a year later, he engaged a girl, whom we were discussing, that she is a nice girl. But\nthey never got married, because he died in... they took him to Russia, that transport labor camp.\nAnd he died. And he was the only one who died from his family, because he had a brother who\nsurvived in England and his parents and sisters survived there in Uzhgorod where we lived.\nPeople were hiding them. He was the only one who died from the family.",
        "Q: What was his last name?",
        "A: Gosh, I cannot believe it, that I don\u2019t remember.",
        "Q: That\u2019s okay, that\u2019s okay. How old were you when you started dating him?",
        "A: 18.",
        "Q: So, you started dating him in 1938?",
        "A: Yes, when the Hungarians came in, yes. And 1941, until 1941. In 1941, I met my husband in\nBudapest and he was already... I don\u2019t know which /agers. He was in labor camps, but they\ntook them out from that part of Czechoslovakia. They took them out to Russia. In Hungary,\nthey kept them in Hungary in labor camp. But that was part of, you know, that was\nthat time, they took, like over the border and they took them to camps. And when I wrote them\nthat what happened, that I need another name. And he wrote me back a letter and he said, \u201cIf\nyou would have told me, I would right away marry you.\u201d And his friend was alive, very good\nfriend and I met him once. And he said that for one day he disappeared in the woods and they\nthought he is committing suicide because of me. But then he came and they took him and all of\nthem died. So, it was a terrible thing, terrible that I was so naive, that I didn\u2019t realize it that Iam\nin love. Because I don\u2019t even know. I, I... we just kissed, that\u2019s it. And we wouldn\u2019t, he\nwouldn\u2019t dare to do nothing, because he said that, \u201cYour personality is requiring such a...\u201d \u2014I\ncannot say it in English, that word. Respect. That he was afraid to kiss me for a year, because\nhe thought that I am going to leave him if he 1s going to kiss me. I don\u2019t know whether I would\nleave him, because I was very naive, after. So it was like Plato... nobody believed us. Because\nthey said when we went to the movies and we were like four couples together and they said, \u201cHe\ndoesn\u2019t look at the movies, he\u2019s just looking at you.\u201d It\u2019s an unbelievable thing, and when I am\ntelling it to my grand-daughter, she\u2019s laughing, \u201cGrandma, those are the nineties.\u201d You know?\nIt took me a long, long time to realize that my granddaughter were not seven years with his\nboyfriend and nothing happened between them. I just... I couldn\u2019t imagine that something could\nhappen... you know\u201d? I trusted her, because I was that way, so I thought, always I thought that\nIlona is ours, from our family. And my husband always said to me, \u201cNo matter what, you always\ncan count on Ilona.\u201d He was always telling me that. And if you leave something for the\nchildren, he said, \u201cJacob is a boy, he will always make it. Leave more for Ilona.\u201d That\u2019s what\nhe always said. He was mistaken, too.",
        "Q: Tell me, let\u2019s go back a little bit again. You mentioned that you had wanted to be a pharmacist.\nDid your parents support that? Were they supportive of that?",
        "A: Yes, but I couldn\u2019t, in \u201838 it was finished. I couldn\u2019t go anymore to school.",
        "Q: Was it unusual at the time, for a girl?",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t think so. It was unusual, I knew one only, in the city, who was a pharmacist. But the\nCzech girls, I don\u2019t know what for, they took Latin. We had all the Czech girls in the\ngymnasium. And that was only... why would they take Latin? Only if they wanted to be\ndoctors or pharmacists. But we didn\u2019t get so far, that\u2019s it. And I never knew what my sister, she\nstill went one year to school when I was already in Budapest. Your back hurt you?",
        "Q: I\u2019m okay.",
        "A: So, I just really don\u2019t know. I never, I don\u2019t know what she wanted to be. It\u2019s so interesting. I\nknow she was 22 years younger, 22 months, and it was very hard to me, like, to go for my first\nball. It was the medical students\u2019 ball. And at that time he was already in the Army and one\nmedical student, who went in Prague to school, to medical school. They didn\u2019t have medical\nschool there, now they have medical school there. And he was a short fellow and he knew that I\nam going out with that boy, but he was in the Army, so he took me. He came home for vacation\nand he took me to the Medical Ball. I would never forget that occasion, because it was\nchaperoned. My mother was there and it was winter and we went on the sled with horses, you\nknow, that kind of it. I would never forget it. And my aunt from Budapest... every year, every\nsummer we went to Budapest, my mother\u2019s family, and they always dressed us up, the children.\nI remember that she gave me-- it was hers, but it fit me beautifully-- a light blue, long, velvet\nevening gown. And it was open, but it has a pearlerie (ph) what I could take off. I will never\nforget that day. And he never, he didn\u2019t let me dance with no one else. Other boys wanted to...\nno. The whole night he was dancing with me. It\u2019s a very interesting story. He became a\npediatrician in Prague. And he went, I think that he went to German college. They had two\ncolleges, Czech and German, he or the other one, the dermatologist went... one of them. The\ndermatologist, I had nothing to do with, because just my friend was marrying him and I know\nthat he went to German college. But he went, I didn\u2019t know whether he is alive or not. And\nwhen we came to Brooklyn, because that\u2019s where we came, to my uncle. And one day I am\nwalking on a street and I see a millinery shop, we had it in Hungary and I see the name. And I\nwent in, and it was, because she had one in Uzhgorod in Czechoslovakia. Can I hold it for you?",
        "Q: No, that\u2019s okay.",
        "A: And she, that was his sister. And she says, \u201cMy God, you are alive. He\u2019s not married. You are\nmarried?\u201d I said, \u201cYes, I am married.\u201d And he came to visit his sister from Prague and he\nwasn\u2019t married. And he called me on the phone one day and I didn\u2019t see him. My husband was\nvery jealous and I wouldn\u2019t even dare to invite him. But my husband was working and I spoke\nabout an hour on the phone with him. And he was asking me, how I am doing and what I am\ndoing and so on and so on. And then he went back and he married a German woman. I heard\nthat he stayed in Germany, but he got divorced, too from that. First time he got married. But he\nwas in love with me. And I knew that, that he was in love with me, but I would never like kiss\nhim or something. No way. [Phone rings.] Doesn\u2019t matter. If somebody knows me, they call\nme on my phone. Ana should be coming home. Maybe she is going, calling me. I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: We have a little more time left on the tape.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: So, can you tell me a little bit more about your early childhood? First of all, were you attending,\nwas this a public school you were attending?",
        "A: Yes, public. We didn\u2019t have private schools. It was very interesting under the Czechs. We had\nreligion in the school. Every religion had their own religion. We had the rabbi coming in once\nor twice a week and the Christians had they priest. And the girls were sitting on his lap, the\nCzech girls, you know? On the priest\u2019s lap. [Laughter.] Now, I know what it meant, but just\nunbelievable. After school we went to a German-speaking religious school and we learned more\nabout religion. But it\u2019s funny that I know my teacher\u2019s name and I forgot what was, gosh, what\nwas my boyfriend\u2019s name?",
        "Q: You mean Nicholas?",
        "A: I will remember it. No. The interesting thing is it was, what we learned, like praying, prayer, it\nwas from my mother. My mother, she was forcing us, like every Friday night we had to pray and\nalways even if we were crying that it\u2019s too much, too much. It was hard. Every week, one more\npage. And actually we learned to pray from my mother, not in school. We learned about\nreligion from that rabbi. We didn\u2019t learn... we learned how to write, but that wasn\u2019t Hebrew,\nthat was like Yiddish. But the alphabet was the same and it was a time that they had there a\npaper, newspaper, a Jewish paper. And I could read it without punctuation. I have no idea about\nnothing, that\u2019s why I never could go up to the Torah and read the Torah, because I have no idea.\nI have to learn, if I would want to read something, I would break my neck to learn it. You know?\nBecause that\u2019s without punctuation, the Torah. But otherwise I read fluently, but I don\u2019t know\nwhat I\u2019m reading.",
        "Q: What language did you speak at home?",
        "A: We spoke, first of all when they met, it was... my mother didn\u2019t speak Russian, he didn\u2019t speak\nHungarian. Both of them spoke German, so it was German. The starting was German, until my\nfather learned Hungarian. And it was German for a long, long time, because we had two hours\nof gymnasium, every day two hours German. And the Czechs hated the Hungarians. My mother\nnever learned Czech. She just spoke German and Hungarian, because my grandmother spoke\nGerman. When she was a little girl, she came from Slovakia where the part, where German lived\nand she spoke German. Not the Jewish, German. And when we went on the street and we were\nwalking and we saw a professor coming from the school, because those are professors in\ngymnasium. It was like, what should I tell you? It was eight gymnasium, so it\u2019s equal like four\nyears college. Because after eight, elementary school and then it was a... plipravka (ph),\nbetween gymnasium and a year where we were preparing to go to gymnasium. It was a year.\nSo, and we saw some professor coming, so we right away started to pull my mother\u2019s skirt.\nGerman, speaking German, that they shouldn\u2019t know that we speak Hungarian. Because they...\nwe spoke so well Czech, that they didn\u2019t believe that we are not Czechs. But then when they\nfound out that we are not Czechs, but they didn\u2019t know that we speak Hungarian. [Laughing. ]\nSo, we had to speak German on the streets.",
        "Q: This must have gotten very confusing, just trying to...",
        "A: No, it wasn\u2019t, when you are a child... and then when we were preparing to come to America.\nWe were preparing after we heard what\u2019s happening. My parents are telling us that we are in\ntrouble. And my uncle managed to come to America, so we started to learn English, private.",
        "Q: When was this? What year?",
        "A: It was in 1940. We were preparing. And it was a teacher, who learned in England. He studied\nin England. He wasn\u2019t a young man. And he was so proud of us, me and my sister, that we are\nso good, that when we went... small town, bigger than here, but it was still... 1t was the capital\nof Carpathan. It was a promenade. They builded it up beautifully, the Czechs, that time, near\nthe water. We had a bridge dividing the city, so it was a very nice city. And it was a promenade,\nbanks, sitting people, and he started to speak loud to us, English, that was, you know, his\ncommercial. We had had English, Anna Karenina and everything already. We were very good.\nSo Czech school. Czech I spoke perfect, German I spoke that time perfect, Hungarian and\nEnglish.",
        "Q: Were you citizens of any...?",
        "A: Czech.",
        "Q: You became Czech citizens.",
        "A: We were Czech citizens. After five years we were, or even earlier, we were Czech citizens. But\nwhen the Hungarians came in, we were no citizens, because the Czechs run away. They went to\nCzechoslovakia. But we couldn\u2019t go because we weren\u2019t born there. And naturalized citizens\ncouldn\u2019t go with them and we were stuck there. And that\u2019s how my parents were killed. The\nvery first, because of that. But the other Russians, probably whoever ts alive, oh, they are not\nalive anymore, because they were like my father\u2019s age. But they were 46 years old when they\nkilled them. They was the same age, my father and my mother. And my sister was 19. And my\nsister could escape, but he says, \u201cNo way, I go where my mother goes.\u201d And I had that guilt\nfeeling that I wanted to commit suicide because of that, too. Because we were so close. And he\nsaid, \u201cI go where my mother.\u201d And we had no idea, where she went or what happened or where\nshe going. It was terrible, terrible. And that aunt, my mother\u2019s youngest sister, who was very\nwell-to-do when she got married, she was... they were very wealthy people. And she had one\nson. And he\u2019s on the picture that I think. His name was George. My George is named after\nhim, because then he became the child of the family who... the two brothers, my uncle, my\nmother\u2019s sister\u2019s husband, he was alive and his brother was alive. Because they were in a labor\ncamp in Hungary. And when George was born, then George got his name then, he had a little\nboy...\nEnd of Tape 1, Side B\nTape 2, Side A",
        "Q: This is tape number two, side A of an interview with Emilie Szekely. I don\u2019t think I actually\nasked for your mother\u2019s full name?",
        "A: Maiden name?",
        "Q: Uh huh.",
        "A: Marvina Eichler.",
        "Q: How do you spell her last name?",
        "A: EICHLER, that was her name, maiden name.",
        "Q: And her family was from the Budapest area? Or what was their history?",
        "A: The whole family, my grandmother\u2019s children, they were born all there, but my grandmother was\nactually from a place, Zam Plain (ph), it\u2019s called, from Slovakia. I told you that there were\nGermans there. My Grandmother, but all the childrens were born there. And all my\ngrandmother\u2019s sisters, who were living there too when she was a child, all their children were all\nborn in Budapest. Everybody was, you know, the cousins and everybody was born in Budapest.\nAnd there were plenty of them. All of them, the least, had three children, my grandmother\u2019s\nsisters, and more. And she had, herself, she had five sisters and a brother, but they were all born\nin Hungary, in Budapest, as far as I know, in Budapest. I don\u2019t know no one who was born\noutside of Budapest. Except for my husband. He was... they were farmers, big farmers, in... I\ncan\u2019t even describe you where is it, outside, not in Budapest, of course. It was close to Eger,\nEger is a big city. But they lived on a farm when he was a young boy and they were very\nwealthy people. And the first, I don\u2019t know what year was it, when the Romanians came in and\nthey took away the farm. Second time the Russians took away the farm and the Germans, they\ntook away. Three times, everything was taken away and then their lives were taken away from\nthem, too.",
        "Q: When you... when your mother, after your mother and father got married and you were living in\nUzhorod (ph).",
        "A: Uzhorod (ph).",
        "Q: Uzhorod. Uzhgorod is another name for it, right?",
        "A: Uzhgorod is Ungbar in Hungarian and the Czech. And that was Uzhorod. U Z and then accent\nover the Z and then horod. Uzhorod 1s, it was in the Carpathian Mountains. It was in a very nice\nplace and a very beautiful city. And to me, every city what is divided with a river, the city itself,\nit\u2019s a beautiful city. [Phone rings.] And that was divided.",
        "Q: Did your mother work, continue to work after she got married?",
        "A: No, she never worked. She was just a hausfrau, house mother, but we were struggling. My\nfather was... they were struggling until they... something happened with them. My mother, I\nremember she made our clothes, everything, she sewed alone by hand. We didn\u2019t have even a\nmachine, a sewing machine. But she tried the best and she tried to brought us up that we were\nreally, everybody who spoke about us... and there are only two people in Brooklyn, who knew\nmy parents from my childhood, only two people, two friends I have, who knew them and how\nthey are talking about them. It\u2019s terrible. One lived in Prague, she got married and then they\ncame to America and her husband was a dermatologist and then he got Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\nAnyway. So, she, we became, we are still friends, but now telephone friends. We are talking.\nAnd she has two very successful children, unbelievable. He\u2019s a dentist. Middle of New York,\nhe has an office. But they came after the Czech revolution that was in the sixties. They came\nwith everything, with furniture, with Steinway piano. They brought everything with them.\nOriental carpets. Not as we came, because they didn\u2019t let us take nothing with us when we came.\nBut only two people. And it\u2019s so sad that only two people knew my parents. You know? It\u2019s\nunbelievable. Of course... no, my cousin, he doesn\u2019t... in Canada, he doesn\u2019t remember. My\ncousin in Budapest, she remembers my parents. She was younger than my sister. She\u2019s younger\nthan my sister was, but she is remembering my parents. But otherwise, no one remembers my\nparents. It\u2019s very sad. And I don\u2019t know about my grandchildren. I wrote down everything.\nThey have it on tape and still they are very mixed up when I speak about an aunt, you see, we\nhave somebody by the name of Ilou (ph), what was a sister-in-law of my aunt, but they have the\nsame name. Because that was a second marriage to my uncle\u2019s brother. And the name was the\nsame Ilou and Ilia (ph). But the other one, the older one, she is not mixing it up. She knows the\ndifference, who was Ilika (ph) to us and who is Ilou, she knows. Ilou she knows, she was here\ntoo. She\u2019s alive. That was my uncle\u2019s sister-in-law by second marriage, because the first wife\ndied with the four year old little boy. And he always wanted children, so he married a younger\nwoman than him and she couldn\u2019t have never children. But she has a big family in Israel. She\nhas a brother and she has a sister-in-law in Montreal, because her brother died when they came to\nCanada. When we came here, they went to Canada. And he was a paper (ph) engineer. He\nwasn\u2019t used to Canadian winter, slippery. And he made a car accident and he got a stroke from\nit. And he didn\u2019t die, but he got a second stroke and he died. And he was a young man. He was\n42, something like that and he left his wife and his young eight years old son in Canada. And the\nwife had a German nana. She was a real German, wonderful, wonderful person, from her\nchildhood. Because she had very, very wealthy parents, and she had a sister, she died, too. And\nher parents died, but that woman, she stayed with her all through her life. And she was bringing\nup her son, too. And then she died in Canada. She never went back. She was from Vienna.\nVery nice person. I remember her so well. I met her many times when we went to Canada. First\nthey lived in Montreal and they moved to Toronto when the French started that you had to speak\nFrench. He\u2019s an engineer, too, my cousin.",
        "Q: Can you say something more... let\u2019s talk more about your childhood. Did you have any non-\nJewish friends who you played with?",
        "A: I had Czech friends, non-Jewish Czech friends, yes. They were very good friends. They had,\nthey were entirely different... their thinking was different from ours. First of all they were very\nloose, the Czech girls, it was unbelievable. There were many, many, even in my class, there\nwere three twins. Can you imagine? There were many twins, girls. And, but they were good\nfriends. And then we had Hungarian friends, Jewish girls friends. We had. We had quite a lot.\nAnd we got together, before I went out with the boy. We got together always, every week at\nsomebody\u2019s house. During the week it was strictly studying. And we went to movies and as I\nsaid... then we belonged to a Jewish organization, Kadima (ph), that\u2019s actually, they have it in\nIsrael now, too, Kadima.",
        "Q: Is that a Zionist organization?",
        "A: It is a Zionist organization, yes, and it was a youth organization. And in the summer we made\nexcursions, but only for one day, in the mountains together. It was a very nice life in\nCzechoslovakia. The Czech people are wonderful people and that was the real democracy.\nWhat I lived under, Masaryk and Benes (ph), that was a real democracy. And I am laughing\nwhen I am talking here about democracy. I says, \u201cDo those people know what\u2019s democracy?\u201d\nYou know, there are castes here and everywhere. And even in the hospital... I worked 27 years\nin Brooklyn Jewish Hospital. And there were very few people who were really, as you say,\nmensch people. Like it was a old doctor, he was the head of the Pediatrics. He was the only one\nwho went there in the morning and he shook hands with the elevator guy and something like that.\nYou know? It was... it was entirely different. They speak here about democracy, but they don\u2019t\nknow what it is. I remember that once before, my husband... my father had many jobs before\nthey had, they bought a... I don\u2019t know what year was it. They bought together a drugstore. But\ndrugstore, it means, because they didn\u2019t have their diploma or certificate. And I have my own\ndiploma, Russian diploma. So when he came to America, he worked in New York in a\npharmacy, in a German pharmacy, and he was the head of the Herbs department. They sell\nmany, many. But he couldn\u2019t do a prescription. And that was the situation with my father, too,\nwhen they went to Czechoslovakia. So they bought a drugstore, but they had everything but\nprescription drugs. But they didn\u2019t have luncheonettes like here. It was no such a thing. But the\ntrouble was, then they separated and a pharmacist died. And it was a beautiful new pharmacy.\nAnd his wife wanted my father to work for her. Okay. He took over and he was substituting\noutside. He knew pharmacists and when they were for vacation, he was substituting in the\npharmacy. He knows, he did everything. And then when he took over that pharmacy and my\nuncle had the drugstore. And it was a big place and a small place, because everybody knew\neverybody. So if somebody went to my uncle, they were... they felt bad that they don\u2019t go to my\nfather. That kind of a situation, you know? It was very bad. So on the end, he had to leave that\npharmacy and he went back with my uncle, together, because, you know, there were lot of\nRussian people. They were non-Jews, lots. And they knew all each other. And one, oh,\nespecially one, who let me go to the office. He had a very big position and he let me go to the\noffice and learn the Russian typewriter. That\u2019s how I knew how to type Russian. But it came\nvery, very good after the war, when I worked for the dictionaries. I was the only one who typed\nRussian in Hungary. So they were all friends, non-Jews and Jews, the Russians. Of course, they\nwere all educated people. I\u2019m not saying that the others were because probably they were anti-\nSemitic, like, you know. Like it always was anti-Semitism in Russia. But they were very good\nfriends. I never forget it, that one Christmas night, she said, \u201c\u201cYou must come to our church.\u201d\nIt\u2019s very interesting, the Russian Orthodox church.\u201d There, it was interesting. No, I don\u2019t want\nto hear about it, what happened with her. And it\u2019s different, I see it on the television. That it is\nentirely different in Moscow what it was there. It was a church where you didn\u2019t have seats, you\nknow? You were all standing and he was like the leader there or whatever. And everybody who\ncame in got three kisses, you know. Three times you kiss. Very friendly, very, very friendly.\nThey were very, very nice people. And then I remember it was a photographer, Kantor (ph) was\nhis name. And I don\u2019t know how he survived, because he was Jewish. And he survived, I don\u2019t\nknow how. They sent him back with the non-Jews. And then my friends from Brooklyn, who\nknew them too, and they were in California and they met him. He was alive for a long time and\nhe met their sons. So that kind of, you know, friends we had there, in Uzhorod.",
        "Q: How did that, how did that begin to change after the Hungarian takeover of Uzhorod in 1938?",
        "A: It was terrible. 1938. It was terrible because... I don\u2019t know whether I say somewhere that my\ncousin came and wanted to adopt us? Okay. My cousin, who was in Siberia for many years. He\nlived in Budapest, and one day he came to Uzhorod and he knew about the situation, that they\nwere worried what is going to happen, because they were thrown out from Hungary. He came\nand he said, \u201cI am going to adopt the children.\u201d\u201d Under eighteen he could have done it. \u201cAnd\njust the name will change. They can\u2019t stay with you. Just God forbid something happens that\nthe children should be safe.\u201d\u201d And I remember the day that they called us and they called us in\nthe bedroom, my father and my mother and him. And they explained it to us and we started to\ncry. We thought that we are going to be taken away from them. And we couldn\u2019t understand it.\nWhy? Why? Why? Though I was 18 years old in 1938. But I just, we just... to take another\nname, and... they didn\u2019t explain it to us, that what can happen. You know? Though we knew\nthe story. We knew the story, but we didn\u2019t think about it, that my father was never led back to\nHungary. Only my mother and us, every summer. He never was let back to Hungary to go back.\nAnd suddenly he\u2019s traveling to Hungary, because Hungary is, we are Hungary. And so after big,\nbig discussions, we decided that we won\u2019t do it. We children didn\u2019t want to do it. And that\ncosted my sister\u2019s life. But my sister could be saved, and he didn\u2019t want because... originally\nwhen they went to that cousin, she wanted to take my sister away, right away when she saw\nwhat\u2019s going to happen, what\u2019s happening. I didn\u2019t know. I wasn\u2019t there in \u201841. And my sister\ndidn\u2019t want to go. She could have been saved. And then she came, and she came... it was\nactually my grandmother\u2019s side. Somebody I don\u2019t know how they were cousins. I don\u2019t know.\nUp to today I don\u2019t know. But she wanted, she told me that she wanted to take her, but she is\ndead, too. She went to the camps, too. So probably my sister, if she would take my sister, she\nwouldn\u2019t be alive anyway. But she says \u201cNo. Whatever is going to happen, it\u2019s going to\nhappen.\u201d But nobody knew, nobody believed it that some thing is going to happen. So, that\u2019s it.",
        "Q: You were in Uzhorod in 1938 and then it became...",
        "A: In 1941...",
        "Q: Did you stay there until 1941?",
        "A: My parents, yeah, I went in 1941, the first time, alone, in May to... no. In 1940, Christmastime,\nI went with my sister, alone, Christmas vacation to my grandmother. And one day, the boy with\nwhom I went out and his friend, they came by car in Hungarian uniforms to see us. And I just, I\ncouldn\u2019t believe it. It was very far away. And he was begging me that I should go home. He\nfelt something. I didn\u2019t. I didn\u2019t know nothing that time, because I didn\u2019t know my husband.\nBut he says, \u201c\u201cCome home and come home, and go home.\u201d I says, \u201cOkay, we are going to go\nhome.\u201d But we had a good time. They took us, I don\u2019t know where we went. Don\u2019t remember.\nThey stayed there two days they had to go back because they were in the army. And we went\nback...",
        "Q: To Uzhorod?",
        "A: In 1940 to Uzhorod. We went back home. And in 1941, in 1941, yes, in January, about in\nJanuary, I had trouble with my rheumatic fever, because I had rheumatic fever when I was\nyoung, very bad. I almost died from it. Six months I was in bed, high fever. That\u2019s why I have\nheart trouble. And I went back and my mother said that \u201cYour sister is still in school. Go alone.\nYou are now 21 years old, 1941. You can travel alone,\u201d because it was about a day by train from\nUzhgorod to Budapest. \u201cAnd take the cure.\u201d I had a doctor there, who every year prescribed me\na cure, what I had to take in a bath. And he said that was a precaution. It shouldn\u2019t be trouble.\n\u2018And take your cure.\u201d Three weeks it took. \u201cAnd by the time you finished, we come after you.\nYour sister will be finished.\u201d And that was in May and I went. And I went, and I met my\nhusband, who we met Christmas together when we were with my sister. We went. We saw him\nonce. He was introduced to us once. His aunt and my aunt were very good friends. But he\ndidn\u2019t live in Budapest. He didn\u2019t live in Budapest.",
        "Q: Where did he live?",
        "A: My husband? Outside in Eger. It\u2019s a smaller town. His sister lived there. And he came to his\naunt. And I went there with my aunt. They played cards together. And suddenly somebody\u2019s\nopened the gates, I never... and it was him. He had a cousin, who was older than him. And I\nwas expecting that he is going to open the door, but my husband, he opened the door. And I just\nlooked at him. Who is he? I never heard from him. And they introduced us to him, so my sister\nknew him, only my sister. And he was talking to me. And he was a very good looking guy.\nAnd he was seven years older than I was. And he, the next few days we supposed to go back\nhome to Budapest, to Uzhorod. And his aunt, in the morning comes to my grandma\u2019s house, I\nwas in bed still. And he says, \u201cEmilie,\u201d my nickname was Millie. The whole family knows me,\nMillie. My name is Emilie, officially. And I didn\u2019t know that Millie is in America a name and I\njust continue being Emilie like in school, when I went to school. But my friends and my family,\neverybody called me Millie. He says, \u201cMillie.\u201d She had a big voice, she says, \u201cFrank fell in love\nwith you and he wants to marry you.\u201d I say, \u201cOh please, don\u2019t say me this nonsense, somebody\nsees somebody and right away they want to marry?\u201d I was not a bad looking girl, that\u2019s true, I\nmust tell you. [Laughing.] But still it was very funny to me. And he said, \u201cI know that you are\ngoing, you are going out with somebody, but how is it? Is it serious?\u201d I says, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\nWe never spoke about marriage.\u201d We spoke about marriage, but he always told me that he\ncannot get married until he is not on his own. He is in his father\u2019s business and until then, he\ncannot get married. He spoke a few languages. He spoke already then very well English. We\nnever spoke about marriage, never. I says, \u201cWe never spoke about marriage. I don\u2019t know how I\nstand and whatever. We are friends, we are very good friends.\u201d So he says, \u201cNo, he\u2019s serious.\u201d\nI says, \u201cOkay.\u201d Next day we went back to Uzhorod. And I didn\u2019t hear from him. Only my aunt,\nthat was my middle sister of my mother and she was a widow at that time.",
        "Q: What was her name?",
        "A: Serena. And she said, \u201cI met Frank\u201d \u2014Ferenz (ph), actually, Feri\u2014 \u201cI met him and he\u2019s\nconstantly asking me when are you coming back, when are you coming back?\u201d So, one day I\nwrote to her, to my aunt, that I\u2019m coming back to the bath. Next day he was there, because that\ntime he already lived in Budapest. He had a business in Budapest.",
        "Q: What did he do?",
        "A: He was actually, he will finish business college. He had a business, here they don\u2019t have those\nbusinesses, because that time was everything, the transportation with horse and carriage. And he\nwas in business, I am always saying we are eating his horse food, because, oat, oat. That\u2019s in\nHungary horse food. So, he had a business with oat. But through the... it was a big business\nbecause he was connected to... I\u2019m sorry, to... Wall Street, what is it? Wall Street business.",
        "Q: Wall Street?",
        "A: It wasn\u2019t Wall Street there, but every business, big businesses were... so it was a big business,\nand he made a lot of money. And he lived there. But I knew about him. They told me, he did\ntell me that time, that he just left his girlfriend, whom he went out for four years, because... his\nmother was against it because the girlfriend wasn\u2019t Jewish. And his sister already was married to\na Catholic. So she said, \u201cIt\u2019s enough, one person.\u201d She was converted, she was married in a\nChristian church with popes, papers that she can get married. Her daughter was born already as\nChristian. And he loved his parents and he loved his mother and after four years he left the girl.\nThe girl wanted to commit suicide. It was a country girl. They had a restaurant there. Because\nwhen he was living there with the same business in smaller... it was small town and he had his\nlittle farm alone and horse and everything. And he lived alone there. And then he wanted to get\nrid of her because of his mother and he came to Budapest. And once he came, she came after\nhim, but I never met her. But he was telling me that she came after him because she was so in\nlove with him. So anyway, so that was the story that he fell in love with me. You know? She\nleft... so, then I found out the story I says, \u201cOh, how do I trust him, if that\u2019s the story?\u201d Because\nhe left one, then he wants to marry me. Well, anyway. So we went out and it was already, I\nfinished my cure and it was already war. My uncle was already in America with the last ship and\nin \u201841 it was already bad. And we went out for a dinner and he brought his friend with him, who\nwas in the same business. And we went to a restaurant and people are looking in the papers for\nthe news. It was no television, radios were, but no televisions. And he took a paper and he\u2019s\nlooking in a paper and I am asking him something and he didn\u2019t hear me. And this way I did\nwith my hand and I turned to his friend. That he saw, that I waved and he took me home that\nnight and I didn\u2019t see him for three weeks. He thought that I did it, that I don\u2019t care about him.\nHe was so sensitive, but I didn\u2019t know that. For three weeks I didn\u2019t see him. The third week, I\nsaid, \u201cI\u2019m going home.\u201d I said to his aunt, because we were very close, even we lived very\nclose. And I said it to his cousin that I\u2019m going home. And he says, \u201cWhy, what happened?\u201d I\nsays, \u201cI don\u2019t know what happened. I didn\u2019t hear from him and that\u2019s it.\u201d He went home to his\nmother, then his mother was telling me... I met his mother, very nice lady, she was very nice. I\nmet his parents. I went to Eger. He took me once. And she was telling me that he came home\nnext morning and he was crying. He was seven years older than me, that she finally found\nsomebody whom he loves, and she doesn\u2019t want me. He was... you know, it was a\nmisunderstanding, the whole thing, but I didn\u2019t know that he is such a sensitive guy, that he\nthinks... so it was a misunderstanding. But he find out that Iam going home. Next day, it came\na big rose, you know, flowers, and \u201cPlease don\u2019t go.\u201d\nEnd of Tape 2, Side A\nTape 2, Side B",
        "A: ...the marriage certificate and then I don\u2019t know. I can\u2019t remember what happened. Probably...\nI don\u2019t know. Because I remember what my father wrote, that he\u2019s giving his crown of his life to\nhim and he should take care of her, that kind of a style, you know. And we agreed that my\nengagement will be third of July in my grandmother\u2019s house. Because we don\u2019t have my uncle\nanymore there and that those relatives were not so close relatives that we should make an\nengagement. Our family was always, my family, my mother\u2019s family was always the family. It\nwas arranged everything, it was a Sunday and the whole family was together, the sisters and\neverything. I remember a beautiful table was made and my parents, my sister should come up to\nthe engagement and they never came. That story you know. That they were called to the police\nand I got a telegram from our friends that they called them to the police and they never let them\nout and \u201cYou disappear. Go in hiding.\u201d",
        "Q: Who told you to go in hiding?",
        "A: My friends who lived near us in Uzhorod, they were our friends and they lived near us. And\nthey saw when they, they knew that they went to the police and they never came out. And they\nsaid, \u201cProbably they are looking for you,\u201d because they knew everything, everything who was\nnot a citizen. Because we weren\u2019t Hungarian citizens. The papers were at the police. That was\nthe police. And they knew that you were four people and they got only three people, so you\nbetter go to hiding. So, I couldn\u2019t get married, because he was already in labor camp, too, from\n1941 on. But that time he was home still. With the... he was in the Hungarian uniform, he was\nso gorgeous. He was an officer. And he... we couldn\u2019t get married, because in Hungary we\ncouldn\u2019t get married. Only when we were 24 years old without the father\u2019s consent, at that time.\nCan you imagine? Today you can get married if you are ten years old, I think. So, he went,\nshort, right after, they stripped him of his uniform and he went to labor camp. And I stayed there\nwith my grandmother and every night, I slept somewhere else. Some other relatives and by his\nfriends, because everything happened during the night, that they were looking for people.",
        "Q: Before we go on, you said something in the other tape I wanted to see if you could tell us more\ndetail about, which was that your father came, was released from jail to come and see you. Can\nyou describe that?",
        "A: Yes, yes. So, we didn\u2019t know what happened to them or where they are. And my, the youngest\nsister of my mother, IIllie, ona, they found out that they brought up a lot of, a transport from\nUzhorod to Budapest and they put them like in a jail. But they were there for two weeks, and\nthey went to visit them. They talked to them and they went to visit them. And my mother told\nthem that I shouldn\u2019t come there, because I look like her and it has no sense that I should be\nthere, because they are going to get out from there. And one day they let out my father with a\npoliceman for money to my cousin\u2019s house, who was in Siberia. He lived very close to that\nplace and he wasn\u2019t home already, just his wife. And nobody was in the apartment and the\npolice brought my father there and he left, the police. And he says, \u201cI come back...\u201d this and\nthat time. I don\u2019t know, it was an hour and a half. And I met my father. And first we just\ncouldn\u2019t talk, we were just crying and crying and we didn\u2019t know what to say to each other. And\nhe was just constantly questioning me. \u201cAre you sure that that\u2019s whom you want to marry?\u201d\nBecause he knew about that I went out with that boy for four years. And he said, \u201cAre you sure,\nare you sure?\u201d And worried about me. I says, \u201cI am not sure of nothing, but I hope it will be all\nright.\u201d And he said, I said, \u201cLook, my aunt knows his aunt and they know the family, so I hope\nit will be all right.\u201d And he called up from Uzhorod, he called Uzhorod and he called up the\nsenators. They were all Russians. There were many Russians, they were non-Jews in Uzhorod.\nAnd he knew everybody. And they told him, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, tomorrow you\u2019ll be out.\u201d And we\nparted and he says, \u201cI hope we see each other tomorrow.\u201d And tomorrow came and my aunt and\neven my husband, he wasn\u2019t my husband at that time, my aunt and her husband, they all went to\nthe train station, because they said the people are going to go home by train to Uzhorod.\nEverybody went back, who was non-Jew. The Jews went in separate cars to Kamana Spodovski\n(ph), where they killed them. And my husband, he had a very, very soft heart, like him. And he\ncouldn\u2019t even, he couldn\u2019t see the scene. Though they went with regular cars, not like with cattle\ncars, but with police and whatever, soldiers, Hungarian soldiers. He run away. He couldn\u2019t see\nit. He just saw them from a distance. And I think my sister recognized him. I don\u2019t know. That\nwas that. And then a few weeks, about two weeks later, I got a card from my sister, in my\nsister\u2019s handwriting, that \u201c\u201cWe are in Kamana Spodovski (ph). We don\u2019t know what are we\ngoing to do here. We don\u2019t know if we are going to have where to stay, but we are here.\u201d And it\nwas a Hungarian stamp on it, so it means that a Hungarian soldier brought it back. And what I\nknow from the museum, that\u2019s why I went this Spring to the museum, I told you that. To find\nout the truth. Because she went first, my daughter-in-law, and asked about it, and met there\nsomebody in the library, who was very nice. And she, he showed her the book and he took out a\nfew pages from the book and he made copies for me. And he sent it to me. He even spoke to me\nover the phone when my sister, when my daughter-in-law was there. And he said, it wasn\u2019t that\ntime that they killed them. I always thought that they killed them when they left in July. When I\nwas there, I looked at the book, but I couldn\u2019t buy it. It\u2019s such a big book. It was not only about\nthem, because, he said, they said, and it\u2019s here and it\u2019s terrible, that 38 thousand people were\nkilled in one day, because they didn\u2019t know what to do with them. Because they took them to\nPoland and the Polish people were already in ghettos that time. So they couldn\u2019t help them.\nNobody could help them. And the Germans didn\u2019t know what to do with them, so they let them\nmade their own grave, naked, like us in Auschwitz. They took the clothes away, they put them\non one line and on the orders. They made a big, big grave and they had to make the grave. And\nfrom the other side, the German soldiers were shooting them in the graves and right away, the\ntanks were running over them. So I wanted that book, but it was no sense, because it was\nfrom... I have the pages what I needed. And I see the pictures how they sit there on the end of\nthe, the forest. And the people... and I saw the... I told you about that 12 series what was on\ntelevision, The Winds of War? You never heard about The Winds of War? Mitchum played in\nit. It started only four series. It was a beautiful movie. It was a French-Jewish writer, who was\nin France and his niece was with him. You don\u2019t know that story? It\u2019s Winds of War, is the\nname. It\u2019s in the public library. After that they made a 12 series, 12 two hours, 12 times, the\nwhole summer and I saw all of it. It was a Hungarian, originally he was Hungarian, an actor.\nAnd his father was amongst those people who were taken and that was his idea to make that\nmovie. You see original pictures what the Germans took. Because it starts out like a colored\nmovie and suddenly it\u2019s black and white pictures. And you see the trains what we went in and I\ncouldn\u2019t look. I said, \u201cI see myself somewhere there.\u201d But when I saw, I saw the whole thing,\nhow they killed them. And then I really couldn\u2019t look, because I said, \u201cMy God, I am going to\nrecognize either my sister or somebody I\u2019m going recognize.\u201d I couldn\u2019t look at it. Everything\nis in it, from the beginning to the end, with Auschwitz, everything. Twelve series and it is in the\npublic library, everybody can borrow it.",
        "Q: Going back to that time, to 1941. What did you, did you have any idea of what they were doing?",
        "A: Absolutely no idea. No idea what they were doing, what is going to happen. We heard from\nSlovakia, what was near us, Slovakia, they are taking young girls somewhere, only young girls.\nAnd where they are taking them and what they are doing with them, we didn\u2019t know. And they\nwere taking them to Auschwitz, because I recognized one of them. Four years later, I recognized\none of them. They were taking them there. They were building Auschwitz actually. And many\nof them they made their lovers, the Germans, because they were all pretty girls they took. And\nthen I knew, that they took them to Auschwitz. And when it was starting to happen, already it\nstarted near the, where Elie Wiesel is from... near Romania it started. They started to take\npeople. And they were always saying \u201cIt cannot happen in Budapest, it cannot happen.\u201d And\nwhen I said that it can happen, they always said \u201cYou are a pessimist.\u201d It cannot happen in\nBudapest, that was the story.",
        "Q: So at the time, you are a young girl, you\u2019re 21 years old. Did you have any sense of the danger?",
        "A: I wanted to commit suicide, I wanted to commit suicide, first of all, because I didn\u2019t know\nwhether he will stay with me, my fianc\u00e9. He was away. I didn\u2019t know what I am waiting for. I\nknew my parents are somewhere. I don\u2019t know where. It cannot be... I even went, it\u2019s\nunbelievable, I even went to a fortune teller. And I let him, show my palm and tell me about my\nparents. And they said that \u201cThey are very far away, don\u2019t wait for them.\u201d That\u2019s what she was\ntelling me. \u201cThey are in big danger.\u201d I just couldn\u2019t understand it. But I had a feeling, that it\u2019s\nsomething terrible happening, but I never had any idea. No, never. And when we were going to\nAuschwitz, I didn\u2019t know where we are going, but I said, \u201cAh, maybe we go somewhere, where I\ncan see or meet my parents.\u201d IfI don\u2019t, I didn\u2019t know where we are going. Nobody knew where\nwe are going. It was just unbelievable. So when I wanted to commit suicide, my aunt saved me,\nmy mother\u2019s younger sister, Illie, Iona. And she had a 13-year-old boy. And three years, I was,\nit was terrible. Every night I slept somewhere else. And the third year, that before the Nazis\ncame, she says, \u201cYou are not going nowhere. Up to now they did look for you, you are our\nchild, and you stay with us.\u201d And I stayed with them. I was like their child, they said. They had\na doctor who was, you know, house doctor, and he treated me like they child, and I was with\nthem.",
        "Q: So, you went into hiding in 1941. Who was helping you?",
        "A: Until 1944. Nobody was helping you, that was all family. I went to my grandmothers, sisters,\ndaughters, cousins. And my husband had friends, they knew about it. And I slept every night\nsomewhere else. During the day I stayed with my grandmother. And when I stayed with my\ngrandmother, and I stayed there overnight, we were always in the basement, because they were\nbombing us. Terrible bombing, the Americans. They were going after the Germans, so they\nwere bombing us. In the morning we got up and we didn\u2019t see nothing. It\u2019s very interesting that\nin that neighborhood it was nothing bombed, but my grandmother\u2019s sister\u2019s house. Only one\nhouse was completely bombed and that\u2019s... and everybody is gone from that family. Only there\nis the girl, who is in Hungary. That was that grandmother, that was that... her grandmother.\nOnly that house was bombed, to the ground, nothing else. And she was the only one survivor\nfrom the whole family. And she was holding onto me, me, me, me. She wasn\u2019t married. And\nshe survived, because her parents, when they saw what\u2019s happening, they put her in a factory,\nlike GE. They made electric, but they worked for the army, and people who worked for the\narmy, they didn\u2019t take them to the camps. They kept them in the factory until they finished the\nwork. In six months they were finished, then they throw them out to the streets. So then she\nstanding there, nobody, no parents and nobody, so what is she going to do? So she met her\naunt\u2019s maid. She was a very nice person and she knew somebody, a lady, whose husband was\nin... she was not Jewish and her husband was Jewish and he was in labor camp. He died, he\nnever came back. And that lady lived in a separate home. She had a house and she took in a few\nJewish people who didn\u2019t have where to go, who came out from the factory. And it was a doctor\namongst them. And my niece, my cousin was amongst them, whom she took in. And she was\nhiding them. And then the neighbors went and told on her, that she is buying too much food and\nshe\u2019s alone, that it\u2019s something going on there. And that was found, that she pulled away the\nbeds and all of them who were there, about eight people, they made a big, big hole in the ground\nand they slept every night, under the bed, in the ground. And that\u2019s how they were saved.",
        "Q: Do you remember her name?",
        "A: No, I never knew her. I never even knew her, no.",
        "Q: What was your, what was your daily life like, during that time? Those years that you were in\nhiding.",
        "A: Hiding? It was terrible, because I was... where we were hiding... no, the Germans weren\u2019t in\nthere, only in 1944... it was terrible. It was frightening, because I never knew that somebody\ncan grab me. And I was afraid to go during the day through the streets, and it was a terrible life,\nterrible. And I was very, very depressed. And they worked on me very hard, really, that I\nshouldn\u2019t commit suicide, because it was terrible. Then he didn\u2019t write to me, I don\u2019t know for\nhow long. My fianc\u00e9. So I didn\u2019t know what was going to happen. His parents were alive still\nand they lived in Eger, because they took away already the farm. So they lived with the\ndaughter. She had a very big house. A part of the house belonged to my husband, because that\nwas an inherited house. She inherited it. She went, can you imagine that she went to a convent\nto school, because that was the best school there. And she was the only Jewish girl. At that time\nshe was Jewish. And when she was 18 years old and she came out, she met that guy. She had a\nlot of Jewish doctors, who wanted to marry her. She met that guy, who was a gorgeous guy and\nhe had three kinds of doctorate, and he had a big, big job with the states. And he fell in love with\nher. And they were the biggest anti-Semites. His father... I told you that? His father left a will,\nthough his granddaughter was born already Christian, that his granddaughter cannot come to his\nfuneral. That kind of a man she married. And she was going to the Catholic Church and\neverything. And they lived together there. The parents had a separate part of the house and they\nlived together. But when everything was happening, he didn\u2019t save the parents. He saved his\nwife and the daughter, but he didn\u2019t save the parents, because he, himself, was an anti-Semite. I\nknow. I know, because he made once a remark, that I couldn\u2019t believe it. They had my stuff,\nbecause I left it by Christian friends. A lot of personal things. And when my husband was\ntransferred to Budapest, I told him where the stuff is and he took it away and sent it to the sister.\nSo whatever is saved, first they saved it, our friends, but then my sister-in-law saved it. So she\nhad everything what was my dowry, my jewelry and everything. So, he didn\u2019t want it, you\nknow, it was his. He didn\u2019t want to give it back to me. And they said they don\u2019t have it. And\none day they weren\u2019t home and I go to the closet and I pulled out everything what was mine.\nThat was the story. So it was terrible, terrible, really terrible. And I know that he made anti-\nSemitic remarks in front of me. And I know that he was an anti-Semite.",
        "Q: What did he say?",
        "A: No, he made remarks about my aunt, who was the loveliest, the best, best person in the world,\nmy aunt. And he said, \u201cThat Jewish woman,\u201d this way, about my aunt. I don\u2019t know what he\nsaid. Said this and that. This way to me, he is saying it about my aunt. And I always had a\nfeeling, because he was mad that my husband married me and not a Christian. He was, you\nknow? Until he met me, it took him I don\u2019t know how long, when I was once there for a\nweek...he took me a week. He took a chance, because he met my train and at that time already\nthey were looking for, not passports, but identifications. And he took a chance and he took me to\nmeet his parents. And him I met, I don\u2019t know. He lived in the same house. And it was a\nSunday when we went there and they came home from church, both of them. And he just, he\ncame to the window I remember. And he says, \u201cHello,\u201d through the window, you know? I know\nthat he was mad that he wants to marry me.",
        "Q: When you were in hiding, what did... how did you occupy your time? Did you read books?\nWhat did you do?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember. I went to my aunt many times, who had the 13-year-old boy, during the day.\nBecause they lived in an other borough. New Pest, and it was Rakospolota (ph), that was an\nother borough, they were, you know? And I walked. I remember I walked. I was afraid to go\nby the street cars that they ask for identification or something. And I walked. I walked a lot.\nAnd I walked to her house and I tried to spend with my cousin... he was a lovely, lovely boy.\nAnd I really don\u2019t know what I did the whole day. I know when I was away my grandmother\nwas very, very upset because she loved me and they were bombing during the day. And once I\nwasn\u2019t there during the bombing and I had to run to a pharmacy to... that was our friends. The\nwoman was my friend and the husband was a gynecologist. And I ran to the pharmacy and I got\nto their basement. When it was over I went home and my grandmother was out of her mind. She\nwas so upset. She wanted always hold my hands, always. And she almost died in my hands,\nbecause she lost her mind in the wagon, that\u2019s for sure. Because to say something like that, that\n\u201cWould you please comb my hair?\u201d She didn\u2019t know what\u2019s happening. And I didn\u2019t know\nwhat\u2019s happening, but I was very glad that she doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s happening. Such a smart\nwoman what she was. She didn\u2019t even wear glasses and was reading the paper every day. She\nknew about everything was going on in the world.",
        "Q: Were you following what was going on with the war at that time?",
        "A: Whatever they printed in Hungarian papers, but nothing else. And we knew. We didn\u2019t have\ncorrespondence with America. It stopped, so I couldn\u2019t even write to my uncle. Nothing. I\ndidn\u2019t know nothing about him. How is he doing? What is he...\u201d We knew in the beginning.\nWe got a few letters from America. And he said, \u201cI\u2019m trying to get your affidavit, that you\nshould be able to come.\u201d And I even have those letters. And we knew that he find a job in that\npharmacy, the German pharmacy. And they lived in the Bronx. I know that. And his address\nwas always in my head, that I know, too. All the time. I wrote it in the dirt in Auschwitz, his\naddress, that I shouldn\u2019t forget it. In case, sometimes I can write to him. Because it was, it was\nan unbelievable thing in Auschwitz, that you knew that you cannot get out from here, never.\nAnd still something was dictating to you, don\u2019t forget that address. It was such a mixture, you\nknow? You knew that you are in a prison. That you cannot get out from here. And never, we\nnever see the end, never saw the end of it, that we can get out from there. And that woman, that\nRomanian woman, maybe she was a Gypsy, I don\u2019t know. She was dark complexion, who was\nreading there, too. They were reading palms. And I says, \u201cOkay, read my palms.\u201d One, it was\nbefore that, it was a private person when I went to. But that one, I went and says, \u201cDo it.\u201d And\nshe said, \u201cYou are going to get out from here, and when you are going to get out from here, you\nwill go for a very long trip overseas. Your husband is alive, but he is in a hospital now. He\u2019s\nsick.\u201d And it was everything true what she was telling me. And she said, it was just\nunbelievable. And she said, \u201cYou will have three children.\u201d And it was everything true. And\nyou shouldn\u2019t believe those things. And it was everything true, because I asked him, \u201cWere you\nin the hospital?\u201d And he says, \u201cYes, with terrible tonsillitis.\u201d In, near... no, it was already\nHungary at that time, 1n Romania, it was Hungary and there he was near Bucharest. They took it\nover, too. And he was in the hospital from the labor camp, because he had very high fever and\nthey put him in the hospital. So it was true.",
        "Q: You described earlier on how you had been dating this other young man and then you just met\nyour husband and that it was very quick. And that you realized you were in love with the other\nyoung man. Did you at some point realize that you were in love with this man that you were\nengaged to? And when did that happen?",
        "A: No. I didn\u2019t... I, well I saw him, I liked him, because he was very good looking and very\nlovable. But I was... until he threw it out, I was keeping the other guy\u2019s picture always in my\npocketbook. That was an interesting thing. Then when I found out that he is gone, then... but\nstill I had it. And once he found it and he was very jealous. And I says, \u201cDon\u2019t be jealous, he\u2019s\nnot alive anymore.\u201d But I don\u2019t know. You see, when I came back and I met him, and I knew\nthat he knew that I am alive. Because they knew I am alive. I told them, that they send to\neverywhere names from Bergen-Belsen. Eisenhower, the United States. So, he knew that I am\nalive. I didn\u2019t know he was alive. And it was a very, to me it was like a very strange thing, that I\nhave a husband, you know? I have to now get to know him. I was two weeks with him. He got\ntwo weeks furlough and he had to go back when we got married in 1944. February, when I was\n24 years old. We got married and after two weeks... everybody said to him, \u201cYou are absolutely\nout of your mind to get married in those times.\u201d But he didn\u2019t want to tell the whole story, that I\nneed another name. So he came from Romania and we got married, but the day when I was 24\nyears old, and...\nEnd of Tape 2, Side B\nTape 3, Side A",
        "Q: This is tape number three, side A of an interview with Emilie Szekely. So, let\u2019s backtrack a little\nbit, you, you needed to get, you wanted to get... was your main motivation to get married\nbecause you needed another name?",
        "A: ....a different name.",
        "Q: So it wasn\u2019t necessarily that you were in love with your husband at that point?",
        "A: I didn\u2019t know him. He was in labor camp and I was with my grandmother. I absolutely didn\u2019t\nknow him. I went with him about three weeks, when we got engaged and then they took him\naway. And he was madly in love with me. And I then I said, God, who knows whether he will\nstay with me? He will go through that. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen with me. He had\nhis parents still then. For three more years he had his parents, because they were killed in 1944.\nI says what are his parents going to say to it and that kind of a business, you know? I didn\u2019t\nknow.",
        "Q: Did you have any kind of false papers at all before you got married?",
        "A: False papers? No. I got the papers late. I have it here, Christian birth certificate. Because when\nhe came to the ghetto, I think somewhere it\u2019s there that a day before, when we were in the ghetto,\nand one day he comes to the ghetto and I almost fainted. I says, \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d He\nsaid, \u201cWe were just transferred to Budapest. The company was transferred to Budapest and I am\nnot with them because I am driving a horse and carriage. I am in a private house with the horse\nand you come right away with me and my sister is going to send you a Christian birth certificate\nand until then you are going to stay with me there. You stay where I stay with the horse. And\nduring the day, I don\u2019t know.\u201d And I said, \u201cWhere is it?\u201d He says, \u201cNot far away from here,\u201d\nhe said. I said, \u201cWell if it\u2019s not far away from here, why can\u2019t you come tomorrow, that I should\nput something together, some clothes?\u201d And he just didn\u2019t want to leave, and he says, \u201cOkay,\u201d\nhe said, \u201cbut I must tell you something. If somebody wants to get... put you in a train, don\u2019t let\nyou do it.\u201d They saw it, when they came already, what\u2019s happening in the country. I didn\u2019t\nknow what he meant. When I learned what he meant, we were pushed by the Nazis with the\nmachine guns, so how can you not let yourself, you know? So he didn\u2019t know either how is it,\nhow they do it. But he said, \u201cDon\u2019t,\u201d anyway. So he left.",
        "Q: Well, let\u2019s get to that story a little later, and go chronologically and stay back at the time and tell\nme about the time, how it happened that you and Ferenz got married.",
        "A: When we got married?",
        "Q: Uh huh.",
        "A: He came home for two weeks...",
        "Q: You were telling it off the tape, but tell 1t on the tape.",
        "A: Oh, oh, oh. So he came home, he got two weeks furlough and everybody was telling him that he\nwas crazy to get married in those times. But he didn\u2019t want to tell the whole story to everybody,\nthat I need another name to survive. We thought that I need another name to survive. And we\nfound a Justice of Peace, who, when I was 24 years old, that day, we got married, because before\nthen I couldn\u2019t get married. Only when you are 24 years old without father\u2019s consent. And they\nchanged my father\u2019s birth certificate to Romania, instead of Russia. And so he was covered.\nAnd he married us. And my aunt, we had two witnesses, one was a distant relative and I don\u2019t\neven know who was the other witness. I have to read it from the certificate. I don\u2019t know. And\nwe got married. And my aunt made a big dinner for the family. And they send us to the city, to\na very nice hotel. And we went to the hotel and I was just very, very afraid because they\nconstantly were checking on people and asking for their identifications. And especially at night\nwhen we went down to eat. And I says, \u201cI cannot swallow, I can\u2019t. I\u2019m so afraid here,\u201d so, but\nwe stayed there overnight. And next day we left and it wasn\u2019t too far away from my cousin\nwhere I met my father. That hotel wasn\u2019t too far away. And I remember that we went to that\ncousin, to his wife. He didn\u2019t know my husband. And they didn\u2019t come even to the wedding\nbecause it was in Budapest, that was in outskirts and they were already very bad times, so it was\nno traveling. So I introduced him. I spend there about, we spent a day there. And then we went\nback to my grandmother\u2019s house and we stayed there for two weeks, until he stayed there. And\nthen he left. And I stayed with my grandmother, later, not with my grandmother, but with my\naunt, because she had the much bigger house. So, we stayed with my aunt, not with my\ngrandmother when we stayed. It was with my aunt. And I stayed with my aunt, too.",
        "Q: With your aunt Ilona?",
        "A: Ilona, with her. The other one, the other aunt, she was a widow and I don\u2019t know. We didn\u2019t\neven go on one train with her. Somehow she went with his aunt, with my husband\u2019s aunt,\ntogether on a train. She wasn\u2019t with us. Only Ilona, my grandmother, my uncle\u2019s sister, my\nuncle\u2019s sister\u2019s husband, they 13-year-old, two 13-year-old boys, then the four years old boy and\nmy uncle\u2019s brother\u2019s wife with the four-years-old boy. We were together in one train. That part\nof the family, but the rest of the family, they were in another wagon, not in that, you know? My\ngrandmother\u2019s sisters, because they were all there, but not in the same wagon. We were 80\npeople in one. So.",
        "Q: But before that you started living, you described how you were moving from house to house and\nthen you started living with your aunt full time?",
        "A: With my aunt.",
        "Q: Can you say something about that?",
        "A: Full time, the third year, my aunt said, \u201cIt\u2019s enough. It seems they are not looking for you. It\nwas enough, you are our child. You will stay with us.\u201d And I stayed with them. Once I was\nvery, very sick, my pulse went up to 160. And they called their doctor. And the treatment was\nso different that time. I remember that I was in bed and they rented from a medical supply store\na big, big bottle what was full with ice-cold water and it had tubes in it. And that tube was put\non my chest, on my heart and the water was circulating in it. That was the treatment. And that\nwas... I thought it was a heart attack, because it didn\u2019t want to go out. For three weeks it didn\u2019t\ngo down, the pulse. And then I had another thing in 1942, that was terrible too. I had the\nappendix taken out and I couldn\u2019t have it done under my name. I didn\u2019t go to the hospital. And\nI went with my mother\u2019s, with my mother\u2019s oldest sister, whose son was in Siberia. And I went\nunder her name to the hospital. It was a private hospital. And the doctor was a private doctor,\nwho, he was a gynecologist. Because I was constantly complaining about pain and pain and pain\nand pain and he just couldn\u2019t find out what is it. And one day my husband was there visiting. It\nwasn\u2019t my husband at that time. And I just was like in two, I had such a pain. And his office\nwas in my, my grandmother, where my grandmother lived, in that house was his office. And I\nwent to him and I said, \u201cI tell you the diagnosis. I tell you what I have.\u201d He says, \u201cWhat, what\nare you talking about?\u201d I said, \u201cThat must be appendix.\u201d And he says, \u201cGod, you are right.\u201d\nAnd he took me to a private hospital to Budapest and they started to operate on me. And it was\nunder my aunt\u2019s name. I was Halas (ph). That\u2019s his grandson is Halas, who is in Canada. And I\nwent under that name. And the operation was so long, they didn\u2019t know what happened there,\nthat the doctors are running for more anesthesia. And my aunt is standing there and didn\u2019t know\nwhat happened. My appendix was completely, completely curled up with my colons and it was a\nvery, very long operation. And my heart, it was weak. They took me home by ambulance after.\nBut next morning, six o\u2019clock in the morning, the doctor is there. And he lived, that was in\nBudapest, in the city, the hospital. And we lived in New Pest, so it was a big distant. I says, \u201cI\nam so sick that you are here?\u201d He says, \u201cNo, no, don\u2019t worry. I just wanted to know how you\nfeel.\u201d Then I found out what was happening and they had to take me home by ambulance. And\nit was in \u201842. And in \u201844 I have an unusual big cut and that\u2019s how I went to Mengele. So I\nthought that that will matter when he sees that. But you know what was interesting? That I had\na friend, she was a woman, who had a mastectomy and she survived. And Mengele saw it and\nshe survived. So they were very odd things. And she came to Canada and she died in Canada.\nIt was a terrible thing. Her son is an engineer. He and my cousin, in Hungary, they went\ntogether to the... they started the engineering college together. Her son and my cousin, who is in\nCanada, that lady\u2019s son. And they lived in Montreal. And my cousin lived in Montreal at the\nbeginning. He went to McGill (ph) to finish his degree. And we went to visit her, the lady, and\nshe was alive for a few years. And once her son had to go to Paris, to France for business. I\ndon\u2019t know what kind of engineer is he, because mine is a chemical engineer. I don\u2019t know what\nkind of engineer he... and while he was away, she got the pneumonia and she died. They had to\ncall him home. She lived together with the son and with daughter-in-law. She married a\nHungarian girl. He wasn\u2019t Jewish. She was Jewish, the woman. Her husband wasn\u2019t Jewish, so\nthe son wasn\u2019t Jewish. So she married a Hungarian, non-Jewish girl, who was already in Canada\nat that ttme. And she spoke perfect French and she worked for the telephone company. Very\nnice person. We went there three times to visit her. And for longest time, they couldn\u2019t... he\nretired. They couldn\u2019t sell their house. And two years ago they wrote me a letter, \u201cFinally we\nsold the house and we moved to Kingston.\u201d It\u2019s Canada, but it\u2019s very close to the border. And\nit\u2019s a beautiful place. And they live there. They have two children. And he said, \u201cMy son\nmarried a French woman with a daughter.\u201d The son. A French woman, who has a daughter.\nAnd the girl, she was a, they wanted a child very badly and finally she became pregnant and she\nwas a premature baby. And she was very small, so they didn\u2019t know that she survive. She\nsurvived and she went to college and then she became the hostess on the Canadian Cruise Line,\nfor... I don\u2019t know how long she did it. They were always... every Christmas they write me and\nI write them. That\u2019s how I know about them. But when they lived in Montreal, they went, many\ntimes, my cousin and they were friends. But since that time, I know only from Christmas cards\nwhat is happening to them. And what\u2019s interesting, my cousin\u2019s son went to McGill, too. And\nthey live in Toronto. But they stayed there and he went to McGill. And he finished psychiatry.\nAnd he wants to... I don\u2019t know how they are doing it, it\u2019s not a bad idea... be a lawyer and a\npsych, psychologist, psychologist and a lawyer. So, he\u2019s going to law school in Kingston, where\nthey live now. You know. The father\u2019s friends. He\u2019s going to Kingston, to law school. It\u2019s\ninteresting. I don\u2019t know whether they see each other. I don\u2019t know what he was writing me\nabout it. I have to call them Sunday, I don\u2019t know. I call Sundays only because it is cheaper.",
        "Q: Tell me, going back to wartime, where were you on the day, or do you remember the day that the\nGermans invaded Budapest in March of 1944?",
        "A: Yes, of course, of course.",
        "Q: Can you describe that day?",
        "A: Oh, that was horrible. I was in my grandmother\u2019s house and we... we didn\u2019t have televisions\nthat time. We just had radios. We didn\u2019t have televisions. We just heard it on the radio, and\nhow do we see it? Because we saw them marching in. And I don\u2019t remember how did we see it,\nbecause we didn\u2019t have televisions. But I know and I see with my eyes how they marched into\nBudapest and where they stopped in the middle where it is divided, the Danube divides the city,\nyou know? Into two parts. And they stop there, and right a way the Hungarian Army, right\naway, they went to greet them, and cater them, and did whatever they want even more. Because\nthey would never find out nothing if those countries wouldn\u2019t help them, what they occupied.\nBecause they, who, which German knew for instance, that my sister-in-law was married, that she\nwas once Jewish? Who knew it? Only the Hungarians who live there and they went and told on\nthem. That here is a couple who was married, converted and who was married to... and then\nthey came, the Germans and the Hungarians together to look for her. They did it themselves, the\nHungarians, and they did it, I\u2019m sure, in every country. Otherwise how would the Germans\nknow whom to take, who was the rich man, whom to call to the department, to their offices,\nwhatever, and torture them? How would they know? Because they help them. Because they\nwere anti-Semites. We didn\u2019t know.",
        "Q: Let me ask you something kind of funny, question. How did you feel about being Jewish?",
        "A: Klingel (ph).",
        "Q: Oh, the last name?",
        "A: You know, I\u2019m constantly thinking about it, since I\u2019m talking to you. You know the boy\u2019s name.",
        "Q: What was it again?",
        "A: Klingel.",
        "Q: And his first name was Nicholas.",
        "A: And he had a nickname, Mitza (ph). Was very, very good looking. I think he was the best-\nlooking Jewish boy in the city. Very nice boy. Very nice, respectful, very, very nice. And the\nparents, that\u2019s interesting, too. That they moved then, after the war they moved to Prague, the\nparents and the sister. And my friend, who is now in Brooklyn, whose husband was a\ndermatologist, her children went, she gave them lessons, piano lessons. His sister gave them\npiano lessons. And they were saying it, I should have known that he would marry me. Can you\nimagine? That\u2019s what they were saying, the parents. And he was telling me, that he cannot talk\nabout marriage, because he is working for his father. He is not on his own. And then they blame\nme, that I should have known. We never spoke about marriage, only that one time he said that\n\u201cT\u2019m not talking about marriage, because, until I am not on my own.\u201d You know? Probably they\nwere against me. I wasn\u2019t a wealthy girl. And she went with a... she left a girl for me, who was\na bank director\u2019s daughter, very wealthy daughter, very wealthy girl. And he went with her and\nshe left her because of me. And then the parents were saying, my friend was telling me, that they\nwere... the sister was telling it, that I should have known. What did they know what went on? I\nwas introduced to his sister once. I didn\u2019t want it. I was, I didn\u2019t want... I don\u2019t know. And\nonce he went to swim in the summer and there is his sister. And he did it by purpose, that she\nshould know me, the sister. And one day then, before he went away to, I don\u2019t know where, the\narmy. And he left a book with me and I didn\u2019t finish it. And he said, \u201cYou bring it back to my\nmother.\u201d I was shaking, you know? I was never in their house and I was shaking. And I was so\nclumsy that I went upstairs, and she was very nice to me. And in the hallway and I gave her the\nbook. And she was very nice and I was so nervous that I... she had some kind of a flower pot\nand I pushed it with my hand. [Laughing.] It broke. It was terrible. It was very uncomfortable\nto meet them, because I had always a feeling that they are against me. You know? He would\nnever, never say to me that, but I had a feeling that the parents were against me, because I wasn\u2019t\nin their category. And she left that girl, who was wealthy, because of me and that was my\nfeeling about them.",
        "Q: Did you think about him a lot? Afterwards when you were in hiding, for example?",
        "A: When I was hiding? About him? I already knew that he\u2019s dead.",
        "Q: When did you find out?",
        "A: 1942. In 1942 I found out through friends from Uzhorod, that all that, I don\u2019t know how many\nfriends together there went. They took them to Russia. And that maybe they killed them the\nsame way as my parents. I don\u2019t know. They put them on the trains and they were in labor\ncamp and that they were killed in 1942. I really didn\u2019t know about to whom first, you know? To\nthink about my parents, to think about him, to think about my husband, my future husband. I\nreally didn\u2019t know. I was terribly mixed up, terribly. And always worried, terribly worried.\nThat fear was unbelievable, that now they are going to get me, now they are going to... because I\nsaw what they are doing. If you didn\u2019t wear the star, for instance, the Hungarian knew you. And\nthat was only in \u201844, when we had to start to wear the star, when the Germans came in. But still,\nif you, I didn\u2019t look Jewish, I could have gone wherever, but they knew me and they could tell it\nto please the Germans.",
        "Q: Did you think about being Jewish?",
        "A: That time? I knew I was Jewish. I couldn\u2019t think different way. I knew that I was Jewish. I\nknew that I am in trouble with all other Jews.",
        "Q: Did you...?",
        "A: I never thought about converting. It wouldn\u2019t help me. Conversion. It wouldn\u2019t help me. But I\nfound lately, I found that Christian... I don\u2019t even know whether I told George, because the last\ntime when my husband went to Hungary\u2014he went many times when he was retired\u2014he went to\nHungary because his sister was very sick for years and he said, \u201cI want to see my sister.\u201d But his\nexcuse was, because we had two little children buried there, he went to the grave. And I was\nsaying always, \u201cFrank, they are in our hearts, those are only stones.\u201d I couldn\u2019t say he wants to\nsee the grave. He wants to have it redone, the letters if they were in bad shape or whatever. But\nhis sister, he had that only sister and she was very, very sick, but her son-in-law was a doctor and\nhe kept him alive, her alive. And he was telling me, \u201cIf not me, she would be dead ten years\nago.\u201d I think she had cancer of the liver, because on the end they had to operate on her. And I\nsaw her, the last time I saw her, that summer in \u201989, and January she died. And we came back in\n1990, January. They had to... she became yellow and he couldn\u2019t help her anymore. But he was\ntelling me himself, if not me... because my niece was unbelievable. She called him from every\nmeeting and everywhere, \u201cCome right away because mother has fever,\u201d and right away the\ninjection. Unbelievable. She was a very good daughter. And I was surprised how he was\ntalking to him over the phone. I says, \u201cMarie,\u201d her name is Anna Maria, \u201ceverybody can hear\nyou.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t care. My mother comes first,\u201d and that kind of a thing. So, he kept her alive,\nreally. My husband went to see her every year, and that year when he went, in \u201882, in \u201881,\nFebruary, he had a heart attack, and he lived 17 months. And in \u201882, June, he says, \u201cI\u2019m going to\nsee my sister.\u201d And I spoke, I knew that three-quarter of his heart was gone. And I spoke to his\ndoctor, I says, \u201cWhat should I do? How shall I tell him that he cannot go?\u201d He says, \u201cYou know\nwhat, he can go. He has a doctor there. He will be safe. But he cannot go rowing around\nnowhere in Europe. He goes to one place and he can go. And June 13\" is his birthday, but I\ncalled him many times. But I called him on his birthday. I\u2019m sorry, June 17. He was born,\n1913, 17. And I called him and he says, \u201cI feel wonderful. I feel very good,\u201d and I always gave\nthe report to the doctor, because he was from the same hospital were I worked, the doctor. And\nhe says, \u201cYes, he has around him more sick people than he is, so he\u2019s feeling fine.\u201d\u2019 And he\ncame home and every first of July, we went out to the country house. They were there already,\nhere in 1979. And we met there and I spend one week vacation there, because Ilona was born\nthird of July. And we spend her birthday. And my husband came back end of June to spend the\nweek in the country for her birthday. And after that, we supposed to go to Canada, all of us by\ncar. And he said, \u201cYou know what? I came from a big trip. You go with them to Canada.\u201d And\nshe was pregnant with Anna that time. She was pregnant with Anna, Ilona. She knew that he\nwanted, because he always wanted children and the two died. He always wanted children, so at\nleast George should have more children. So she was pregnant with her, and we went to Canada.\nHe said, \u201cYou go to Canada and I go home.\u201d And he was alone, traveling home. And then I got\na call from him in Canada that please bring a present to one of my co-workers. I says, \u201cWhy to\nher?\u201d She says, \u201cBecause I was sick and she took me to the hospital.\u201d So we packed and we\ncame right back. He was a few days in Intensive Care or in Coronary Care, I don\u2019t know what\nhappened. He didn\u2019t feel well. And August 12, August 12\", he died. And I wasn\u2019t home. I\nwas working and after work I went to the dentist and I had to have a tooth pulled. And he was\nvery upset about that and he came with me. I went by bus. They had private buses, because I\nwent to the city periodontist. And he came to the door and he looked so beautiful. He had\nbrown pants and a yellow shirt on. And he said, \u201cNothing, nothing hurts me,\u201d because he had\nback trouble, too. He had a spine operation. He said, \u201cNothing, nothing hurts me.\u201d And you\nknow, you don\u2019t think if it\u2019s about your own, that the last day when you live, nothing will hurt\nyou. And that\u2019s true. But you just don\u2019t think. And I\u2019m so happy that he said it...\nEnd of Tape 3, Side A\nTape 3, Side B",
        "Q: ...9zekely, took a little break for a few weeks there. And now I wanted to just ask you, because\nI was reviewing the interview that we did last time and going over it, I had a couple of questions.\nAnd one of them was, right at the beginning you were talking about the cousin of yours, who was\nthe painter, who lived in Odessa. And I wanted to make clear, was it his daughter that came over\nand stayed with you? It was his daughter? Okay.",
        "A: It was his daughter that came over and stayed with us. We had an apartment here.",
        "Q: You told the whole story, so I don\u2019t want you to go through that again. But I just wanted to\nclarify...",
        "A: It was my cousin\u2019s, my father\u2019s brother\u2019s daughter and her family. And he, himself, lives in\nBoston.",
        "Q: Okay. Did he come over at the same time as her?",
        "A: No, no. He came over five years ago, six years ago because he is a citizen already, so it has to be\nfive years ago. He became citizen last year, \u201899. So, five years ago, because he came with his\nsister and sister\u2019s family. Husband only, sister\u2019s daughter and husband, because the husband had\nthe parents there. And they always, he and his sister lived always together and a niece and a\nhusband. So he belonged with them. I couldn\u2019t bring him, because only you could bring parents\nor sisters or brothers. So, he went with them because he lived with them and he had his son...\nit\u2019s not brother-in-law actually, because his husband... they had the parents there already, and\nthrough them. That\u2019s why he didn\u2019t come here. But his aim was if his daughter is here and their\nfamily is there, everybody to be in Kentucky together. That\u2019s what he wanted.",
        "Q: And tell me what his full name 1s.",
        "A: He is, Isislav (ph) Klugman. That was my maiden name.",
        "Q: I see, so he was your father\u2019s brother.",
        "A: My father\u2019s brother\u2019s son.",
        "Q: Okay, and we, last time we were going over mostly some questions about your childhood and\nsome things that weren\u2019t covered in the interview that the Shoah Foundation did. And what I\nwanted to do mostly today is to talk about your experiences after the war, after the war ended.\nBut one of the things that wasn\u2019t clear to me from the Shoah Foundation interview was, tell me if\nI have this right, when you were on the transports from Hungary to Auschwitz, you were with\nyour grandmother and your Aunt Ilona.",
        "A: With my Aunt Ilona and other aunts, too and her son. My mother had four sisters, so I was with\nthree of them. But the closest was to me always Ilona, because when they took my mother and\nthey killed them in, my parents in 1941. So, she was the one who was unbelievably helping me.\nAnd then the last year, before the Nazis came in, she didn\u2019t let me go to hiding and she said,\n\u201cYou are our child, no matter what. You stay with us.\u201d And so for one year I was with them\nuntil they took us all. And after, when she survived and I survived and her husband survived, but\nnot her son. And my son was born. To my son she was like a grandmother. So when we left,\nwe left to Vienna and we left them in Hungary, but we knew that they are coming after us, three\nweeks. Because they had, they were elderly people already and they had visa to Israel and\nEngland and we knew that they are going to come. And the time came then we came to America\nand we left them there. And my son, he was so blaming me and he was so crying. How can I do\nit, to leave them there? He was nine years old. He was the only relative whom he knew. Like,\nshe took care of him when I had to go to work. Because under the communism we had to work.\nAnd she was everything to him. And my heart was going out and I was explaining to him,\n\u201cWhen we get to America and we become citizens we are going to bring...\u201d and that was the\nplan, that we are going to bring them over. But she died, unfortunately, from a gall bladder\noperation. But I think that she had already liver cancer, but they don\u2019t tell me, because nobody\ndies from a gall bladder operation. It must have gone to the liver and the operation was okay.\nShe was alive for a few days. And one day my uncle and his brother went to visit her. They\nwent every day, but one day when they went, she was dead. I didn\u2019t go, to the funeral. Because\nwe were here in \u201858 and that was in \u00b063 and in \u201859 I got a job in the hospital when I was working\nand I says, \u201cWe don\u2019t have either the money for the three of us to go,\u201d so we couldn\u2019t go. But it\nwas in the summertime and George was with some of our friends in the country. They were\nhaving a bungalow they rented and we went over on the weekends. We went to Poughkeepsie.\nAnd he was there and I was afraid to tell him. I was afraid to tell him. And he wrote to his\npediatrician in New York, who was the head of the Pediatrics in the hospital where I worked, and\nasked him to find out from me the truth, because he thinks that something is very wrong. And he\nshowed me the letter and he said, \u201cYou have to tell him.\u201d So, I was very, very upset to tell him.\nAnd I found it out, my husband did, he got the letter and he didn\u2019t want to tell me. And we are\ndriving out to the country and when he told me, we made an accident with the car. I was, you\nknow, so upset, we made... and it was an old car and we had the first car. It was a big Pontiac.\nBut somebody ran into us. It wasn\u2019t our fault, and he ran away. The guy ran away. But I was so\nupset that how I am going to tell him, because it was like the end of the world. He didn\u2019t know\nno one from the family and he was the kid of the family, because his brother, my uncle\u2019s brother\nlost his four-years-old child and the second wife never could have children. So he\u2019s named after\nmy, Ilika\u2019s son, he was George, too. And he was everybody\u2019s child, only child. And when I had\nthe other little boy, he was five months old when he died. I named him after the four-years-old,\nwho died. He was Paul, he was Paul, my little one, who died in one day from the croup.",
        "Q: At one point in Auschwitz, you told in your interview with the Shoah Foundation about how you\narrived in Auschwitz and how you were there for, I think two weeks before you were given your\ntattoo and before you started working. When were you separated from Ilona?",
        "A: Three weeks later. She was, when we went to the barracks, she was put in the next barracks.\nBecause they put 60 people in one and she would be the 61. So she was put in the next barrack.\nBut when I came back from work, they didn\u2019t get food, those people who didn\u2019t work and I gave\nthem my half of the bread and I dressed them up. I\u2019m saying \u201cthem,\u201d she was there with one of\nher friends, who had two twin sons and they are alive. They went through all the... I told you\nthat, no?",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: No? She had two twin sons, her friend and they went through all, all the experiments with\nMengele. They are alive. They are in Israel. One is in high... he has, I don\u2019t know what kind of\nposition, but they are not men. They cannot get married, that\u2019s what they did to them. And I met\nthem when I was in 1976, I was in Israel. And that was one... we went to restaurant and my\nuncle\u2019s brother was there with his second wife, who is alive and she is in Vienna. She married\nhim when George was born, the second wife. And she was much younger than he was. He\nwanted children and she couldn\u2019t have children. When we went to the restaurant then, I didn\u2019t\nknow what\u2019s the surprise. My aunt\u2019s friend was there with her husband and she said she would\nnever forget it, what I did for them. Because they were naked. I was, but my aufseren (ph) and\nthe forewoman, she let me take out clothes, because I told her that my aunt is in the next camp.\nAnd she let me take out clothes. And I dressed them and I gave them food. And one day when\nMengele came to the camp and he was sorting out, because he came every week and sorting out\npeople. We had to get undressed and walk around him. He had a stick in his hand and he\u2019s\npointing one here, one there and I was one here. I knew I go back. And she was on the other\nside and I didn\u2019t know what happened to her. I thought she goes to gas. I didn\u2019t know about\nnothing else. And I knew that that\u2019s gas there. It turned out that they took her to Theresienstadt\nwith her friend. And they were working at an ammunitions factory and at night they stayed at\nTheresienstadt. And only when I went back, I knew that she is alive. And she was everything to\nme.",

        "A: I came, I think that\u2019s in it, when I came to our station, people were standing there and waiting for\npeople to come, because in whole Europe they were waiting for people to come because they\nknew who is alive, because Eisenhower... that I said, that he made a list from everybody and\nsend it to the places where they came from. So, they knew I am alive after liberation, but I didn\u2019t\nknow about no one. And when we got to our station, I saw there are many people and I didn\u2019t\nknow no one. I was shaking and I went to one of them and I says, \u201cExcuse me, do you know\nsomeone by the name of Eugene Schwartz?\u201d And he started to scream and he says, \u201cYou are\nEmilie?\u201d I says, \u201cHow do you know it?\u201d He says, \u201cYour uncle is waiting for you every day.

And I knew that he doesn\u2019t drive. He had a chauffeur. They were very\nwealthy people before the war. And they started to pull themselves together. And he came and\nwe were just, we couldn\u2019t talk. We were crying and crying and crying. He loved me very much\nand he was just crying. And finally when we stopped crying, didn\u2019t stop, but we could talk, he\nsaid, \u201cYour aunt is alive, but not my son.\u201d But I knew that 13 years old wouldn\u2019t be alive.

And they lived... that was an older\nhouse, and they lived in that apartment in his parent\u2019s apartment, my uncle\u2019s. And then we\ncame, I came back, and my husband. I think it is there how I met my husband when I came\nback. Okay, so we stayed there, but only for a few days because it was no room for us. So we\nwent to Eger, to his sister, what is another city. It 1s about, I don\u2019t know how many miles away.\nIt was a very nice town. I knew that town before the war, because I went to visit his mother\nthere, his family, his mother and father, who lived already with his sister, who was converted.\nThat story is in there, no?",
        "Q: You mentioned, you talked about the sister last time, last time we were here, his sister.",
        "A: Okay. His parents lived there. And part of the house was my husband\u2019s house, because that\nhouse was inherited. And there were other relatives there from that part of the family and they\nwanted the part of the house. And they shouldn\u2019t get it. My husband paid it out. So a part, it\nwas a very big house, it was his. So we had like a separate apartment, but together with them.\nThe kitchen was together, but we had two rooms and after the two rooms was the big dining\nroom what separated us. And in that apartment his parents lived, because they took away their\nfarms. They were big farmers, not in Eger, it was in another city, I mean village. And they took\naway everything from them. They took away, it\u2019s interesting, first the Romanians before, after\nthe first war, they took away, then the Russians took away. The Germans took away. So, they\nwent back and forth and on the end, the Germans. When the Germans took away, they had to\nleave. And they let them leave and they left to their sister and their daughter. And their son-in-\nlaw couldn\u2019t save them, but he saved his family, my sister-in-law and his daughter.",
        "Q: I have a few questions about that time. One, did you have any hope at all that your parents and\nyour sister were alive?",
        "A: Hope? No. After Auschwitz, no, but before Auschwitz, I thought that they must be somewhere\nalive. And when we went to Auschwitz I thought we go somewhere, where I\u2019m going to meet\nthem. I had no idea. I think I said it then, that once I went to a fortune teller, I said it, and they\nsaid that my parents are alive, but they are very far away. And it turned out that they were really\nalive when I found it out from the Museum. Because I thought after I came back that they were\nkilled right away in June, July, when they took them. August 24\" they were killed, according to\nthe Museum. And they showed me pictures and where they took them. And they knew about it.\n30, what did they say, 130? I don\u2019t know how many. How many people, one day they were\nkilled, because they were not only from Czechoslovakia, that part where we lived, but they were\nfrom Romania, what belonged once to Hungary, where Elie Wiesel comes from. They were\npeople from there, too. And they were there, too. So they were, I think, 38,000 in one day they\nkilled. Because they took them to Poland first, no, I know from them. And they didn\u2019t know\nwhat to do with them because all the Polish people were in the ghettos and they didn\u2019t know\nwhat to do with them. That\u2019s why they were killed.",
        "Q: Can you tell me when and how you found out what had actually happened to your parents?",
        "A: Actually I found out in 1948, because one of my first cousins was taken in 1941 to... we didn\u2019t\nknow where. They took him from the street in 1941. He was an engineer. And he just\ndisappeared. And in 1948, he came back from Siberia. And when he came back and we met,\nthat was my first cousin, my mother\u2019s sister\u2019s son, and when he came back, he asked me, \u201cWhere\nare your parents? What happened to your parents?\u201d And I was telling him that I have no idea. I\ngot a card from my sister from Kamenetz Podolski (ph) and she\u2019s writing, \u201cWe are here. We\ndon\u2019t know what are we going to do. When do we get an apartment or something to eat. We\nhave no idea.\u201d And the card had a Hungarian stamp on it, so I assume that she sent it with a\nsoldier, a Hungarian soldier, back. And from then on I didn\u2019t know nothing. And then my\ncousin was telling me, \u201cMy God, I was there when those people were killed. I was on a horse\nand carriage.\u201d He was in... he went to underground with the Russians. And how, I don\u2019t know\nup to today, how he was riding a horse and carriage, and he was there, he said. He saved a lot of\npeople. He put them under the hay. He had no idea that my parents were there. That was the\nfirst when I knew how they were killed, in 1948. And I was back 1945 already from\nconcentration camp. And I still didn\u2019t know what was happening.",
        "Q: During those three years then, before you found out and after you got back did you make any\neffort to find out what had happened to them?",
        "A: I didn\u2019t know where. We became right away communists. In 1948 we were communists. I\ndidn\u2019t know where to ask, no idea. And George was born in 1946 and my mind was... I am not\nsaying that I was happy, but you know, I was happy that I have a family. I always wanted a\nfamily and I never knew that I can have a family. I never knew that I can have a child anymore,\nso I was very happy that I had a child. And I never knew. Never, and I didn\u2019t come with no one.\nBecause a lot of people I met from my, from the place where they were home when they took my\nparents. I have in Brooklyn two friends, only two, who knew my parents, in this whole world,\nonly two. Those people knew my parents and my sister. And they knew what was happening to\nthe non-citizens. Because we were not citizens that time. We were Czech citizens, but the\nHungarians took it over, so We were now citizens. And those people were Hungarians. I don\u2019t\nknow, yes, they were Hungarians. Hungarians. They weren\u2019t Russians. They took only the\nRussians, no other citizens. And so they knew that they took them somewhere, but they didn\u2019t\nknow why, because I was questioning them in Brooklyn. I said, \u201cDid you know what happened\nto them?\u201d They said they never knew what happened to them, they just knew that the transport\nwent and never came back.",
        "Q: And I wanted to go back again and ask you a little bit more about the time right after the war had\nended and you returned to Hungary. You talked about how you wanted to have a family. What\nelse, what were your hopes at that point? Were you thinking about the future? Did you want to\nstay in Hungary? Did you and your husband talk...?",
        "A: We couldn\u2019t go, we couldn\u2019t go, we couldn\u2019t go nowhere. We had to stay in Hungary. It was no\nway under the Russians, that we could get... I got in touch with my uncle, here in America. And\nhe wanted us very badly, but it was no way that we... maybe old people got visas already at that\ntime to Israel, but young people didn\u2019t. And we were young people, so it was impossible. And\nthen in \u201849, I had the other boy, so I didn\u2019t even think about it that we should go anyplace, to try.\nAnd we didn\u2019t have a bad life until it was really communism. Because I had a maid, sleep-in\nmaid. I didn\u2019t have to work. And in 1948 when it was really communism, I had to let her go, the\ngirl, and I had to go to work. Because everybody had to show what they are living from, because\nmy husband was in private business and he couldn\u2019t show how much he is making. And he\nmade nice money. But I had to go to work.",
        "Q: Did your husband lose his business at that time?",
        "A: No, well he lost it after, yes. After he lost it. And he couldn\u2019t get a job, because they said he 1s a\nCapitalist. It was very hard for him to get a job on his profession, but then later on he got a job.\nHe got a job later on, but it was not a state job. It was again private. He went together with\nsomebody and they had... he was actually, he finished business college, but actually what was\nhis business before the war, he was [laughing], I have to always laugh that we eat the oats,\nbecause that they gave to horses in Hungary. And he was in that business, feeding, oat feeding,\nbecause everything was horses, not cars. The transportation was horses and it was a big\nbusiness, the animal food for the horses. And they connected with the, with the... gosh, with the\nmarket.",
        "Q: Stock?",
        "A: Stock Market. So he had a big business and he made a lot of money, but whenever he made the\nmoney, we bought a Persian rug or we bought silver. I have 40 kilo silver stuff. I had a beautiful\ncase and it was everything silver in it, because we couldn\u2019t show the money. We couldn\u2019t put it\nin the bank or something. And then they didn\u2019t bother us. They bother us in one way: that we\nhad a big apartment. Because when my aunt\u2019s apartment was ready, they renovated it, we\nmoved in, in the old apartment and it was a very big one. I mean large rooms, there were three\nlarge rooms. And actually the fourth one was a room, too, the foyer, because we had furniture in\nthere. And we had a kitchen and bathroom and we had a room for the maid from the kitchen.\nAnd the third room was a very big, it was so big that George when he was little, he could bicycle\ninit. That was his room. And they took away from us that room. You know? And they made\nan apartment from it, a one-bedroom apartment. And they put in a family, only with one son. A\nfamily with one son. It was so big that they made kitchen, bedroom, bathroom... I don\u2019t know, I\nnever went in, what is it. They were our neighbors. But otherwise, we didn\u2019t have trouble.\nThey took away the business of my uncle. He had 40 pairs of horses and two big trucks. They\nwere the first ones, because they were in... in... how do you call it, that business, when people\nmoved. It\u2019s a moving, not moving, actually it\u2019s not moving. But with the horses, too, they were\nrenting it or whatever, to companies. And very, very big business. 40 pairs. And when it\nhappened, they took my husband and he worked for them. He loved horses, that was his life, the\nhorses, horseback riding actually. He loved it. And so he worked for them. But then they took\naway the business from them, from my uncle, so he had to... they didn\u2019t work anymore because\nthey were elderly people. And when the opportunity came after the Hungarian Revolution, my\nuncle\u2019s brother escaped to Vienna with his wife. And family is supposed to go after them, but\nwe didn\u2019t succeed.",
        "Q: You did tell that story. So your husband, what was the name of your uncle, who your husband\nworked for?",
        "A: That was my uncle Eugene.",
        "Q: Okay, Ilona\u2019s husband.",
        "A: Ilona\u2019s husband and his brother, they were together. And that was the business what they\ninherited from their parents. It was a very old business.",
        "Q: And 1s that the same uncle, your uncle\u2019s brother, who got out after the Revolution? Is that the\nsame one?",
        "A: Okay, no. He started to work with them too. He was in an entirely...\nEnd of Tape 3, Side B\nTape 4, Side A",
        "Q: This is tape number four, side A of an interview with Emilie Szekely.",
        "A: My uncle, my mother\u2019s brother was in labor camp in Hungary and when the Germans were\nleaving, they managed to take him to Germany and he was in Buchenwald. And one day I was\nprescribing, I got always the Smithsonian magazine and it was a picture there, a nice article\nabout the Holocaust. And the picture showed Buchenwald and a part of the bunk beds, a part of\nthe, it was the...",
        "Q: Barracks?",
        "A: Ya, and on the end of one of the beds, on the end was, the picture, they were all looking in the\ncamera because it was after the war, and it was marked, Elie Wiesel. And on the other side there\nwere three men, between them, it was my uncle. I recognized him. It was my mother\u2019s brother.",
        "Q: And his name was...?",
        "A: Joseph. And when Elie Wiesel was here about, that\u2019s now four, five... Ilona was a senior, that\u2019s\nfour years ago. Four years ago, he was here in Lexington and he had a wonderful, wonderful\nspeech. It was the Jewish Federation and the UK, they did it together. And it was in UK, in the\nMemorial Hall. Before that, they had a dinner in the club, but it was 150 dollars a plate, and I\ndidn\u2019t have 150 dollars for a dinner. And people were coming out and they were telling him\nwhat a wonderful thing it was just to shake hands with him. And I was very upset that I know\nthat man from my co-worker, who was a very good friend, her father was very good friend, her\nhusband, of Elie Wiesel and I couldn\u2019t see him. I couldn\u2019t talk to him. So when it was\neverything over, Ana was telling me, \u201cWait, wait, maybe you can see it, go to his dressing\nroom.\u201d So, a gentleman was standing there from UK, they didn\u2019t let nobody to see him. And I\nwent there. It was the rabbi\u2019s wife, that time, Rabbi Slaten\u2019s (ph) wife, and she was talking for\nme. And she says, \u201cWould you let that lady in only for a few minutes? She is the only survivor\nhere in Lexington and she would like to talk to him, only for a few minutes.\u201d So he says, \u201cYes, I\nwill do it, but she has to wait until the hall is empty, because if people see somebody\u2019s going,\nthey want to go, too.\u201d So, I was waiting, I says, \u201cI gladly wait.\u201d So, I was waiting and he helped\nme down the steps, because they were wooden steps in the basement. It was the... I couldn\u2019t\nbelieve it. He says, \u201cYes, we are hiding people.\u201d [Laughing.] And it was nothing to hold onto\nand they were wooden steps and he was helping me to go down. And suddenly I came and the\ndoor is open and he\u2019s standing there. He was a very, very attractive man. And my heart was\nbeating, that I couldn\u2019t say nothing, so I says, \u201cHello.\u201d He was very friendly. I says, \u201cHello.\u201d\nHe says, \u201cWho are you?\u201d I didn\u2019t say even my name, I was so excited. I says, \u201cI am a Holocaust\nsurvivor and I am the only one here.\u201d He says, \u201cIf you are a Holocaust survivor, you must be\nfrom Europe.\u201d I says, \u201cYes.\u201d He says, \u201cWhere are you from?\u201d I says, \u201cBudapest.\u201d He says,\n\u201cBudapest?\u201d And he starts to talk to me, Hungarian. I couldn\u2019t believe it. I said, \u201cYou speak\nstill Hungarian?\u201d Because he didn\u2019t, I mean, I don\u2019t know where he learned, because where he\nwas, they were very religious people, his parents. And I think they spoke Yiddish and not\nHungarian, but he spoke Hungarian. And he was 15 years old, maybe in school, correct, in\nschool, probably he learned. He spoke wonderful. And he says, \u201cNo, I can, because I have no\none to talk to.\u201d His wife is French. I says, \u201cDon\u2019t tell me, you speak Hungarian.\u201d And from\nthen on he spoke Hungarian to me. And he asked me where I know him from. And I mentioned\nhis friend\u2019s name. And he says, \u201cKorman! (ph)\u201d He says, \u201cI saw him last week!\u201d That\u2019s what\nhe\u2019s telling me. I says, \u201cYes, because of you he didn\u2019t want to retire to Florida, because he was\noften...\u201d he lives in New York, actually, and teaches in Boston. And they had from that part of\nthe town, Sighet (ph), they had an organization. And that my friend\u2019s husband went always there\nbecause he loved him. And she then was telling me what went on in that organization and what\nhappened at that organization [laughing] when they were together, so I knew a lot about him.\nAnd I was telling it to him. He says, \u201cBecause of you, he didn\u2019t want to move to Florida.\u201d He\nsays, \u201cYou know what? I saw him in Florida.\u201d When he was down in Florida, he saw him. So\nhe was very nice, and then he says, what I am doing, and I told him that I am talking in schools,\nand he says, \u201cWonderful.\u201d He says, \u201cWhat grade are you starting?\u201d I says, \u201cSixth.\u201d He says,\n\u201cThat\u2019s the right grade to start, don\u2019t do younger ones.\u201d But I did, because they were begging\nme. Lexington School for five graders. Ana went to SCAPA, they were four graders. They\nwere begging me, especially in SCAPA, they were very smart kids. And here too, in Lexington\nSchool, they are very, very... I spoke twice already there. And now I, the teacher was always\nasking me whether I know a book for children. I am reading now in a magazine that he, Elie\nWiesel, wrote his first children\u2019s book about the Holocaust with pictures. So, I try to get that\nbook and I try to call that teacher in Lexington School, because she 1s very intelligent. She is\nteaching fifth graders. And they understood it. What kind of letters I got from them, from the\nfifth... I just cannot believe it, how they understood it and how sorry they are for me. And they\ncannot believe it, that I lived through that. Fifth graders. So I tell you the truth, that I spoke\nabout 150, 160 times since Iam here. That if I cannot do it, because I will be the most\nunhappiest person in the world, because I feel the commitment that I have to do it. I still have to\ndo it, because there are many, many people, who don\u2019t know it still and those are adults, mostly\nadults. The children are starting to know me in schools, because I go back always, because they\nare different classes, and most of them they know. In the colleges, too. I was all over in every\ncollege, Berea, Midway, and the private college, Transylvania, twice, UK three times.\nCommunity college. So, they know all ready. But the adults, lot of adults, in churches, they\ndon\u2019t know. So, I will be really... and even if they call me to schools, next graders who didn\u2019t\nhear me and I cannot do it, I am depressed and I always think about it. That it give me... I\ncannot explain it, when I talk, I am very enthusiastic and I live it through again. That\u2019s true.\nAnd I have to take a tranquilizer, I must take before I go. And I never spoke about my parents,\nbecause I couldn\u2019t. I was always crying. And lately I am even showing the pictures of my\nparents. And if they give me enough time to tell them that story on the end, I am including it,\nwhat happened to them and I am showing their pictures. And I was so relieved that I did it.\nOkay, I didn\u2019t sleep at night, but I was relieved that I did something good for them who died.\nYou know? I took it in my head that they died and they won\u2019t be at peace until the last survivor\nis going to tell their story. It\u2019s... I cannot explain it, what happened to me, because I never\nspoke. I never spoke.",
        "Q: So, in those years immediately after the war that you were in Hungary, you didn\u2019t speak about\nyour experiences at all?",
        "A: I didn\u2019t speak, even in New York, never. New York, I didn\u2019t have to, because there were so\nmany, I never heard denial. And here I started only because I heard denial. In Hungary I never\nspoke about it because the Hungarians are very anti-Semitic. And they told you that \u201cToo many\nof you came back.\u201d It\u2019s a Catholic country. I am not saying that the intelligent people, but I\nheard it from people saying it. So, in Hungary, I even went to a doctor, I wanted to take off my\nnumber because it was so uncomfortable when I was holding onto the train. I went to the city. I\nworked for the book publishers, you know, the dictionaries. And that\u2019s where they were telling,\nthey were looking at those numbers like, \u201cI would kill you,\u201d you know? Maybe it was in me that\nI thought it, but no. Even today, even I told you, I was in 1978, in Hungary with Ilona... 1978?\nWhat am I talking about? She was born in 1970. 1989 I was with her. I told you that story, no?\nAnd we lived there for months?",
        "Q: You mentioned it.",
        "A: We lived, my sister-in-law was still alive at that time, my husband\u2019s sister and she took an\napartment for us, because they had only a one bedroom apartment. A very beautiful place. And\nhe took us for an apartment, a rental, close to them. And it was a woman, whose husband was a\nschool principal, but they were divorced. And she had a son, an engineer and he didn\u2019t live\nhome and she had three rooms, two bedrooms and a living room. One bedroom was separate and\nthen she had a room in Bolotow (ph), near Lake Bolotow (ph), that she went there. If she rented\nthe apartment she went there, that she shouldn\u2019t be home. But we were always begging her, that\nit doesn\u2019t bother us, she should stay home. Because she was the only person who spoke English\nand Ilona could spoke to her English. She was the only person. And she worked for the... she\nwas babysitting in the Canadian Embassy for somebody. So, she spoke English well. We were\nglad when she stayed home and when she stayed home she went down and she brought us\nalways fresh bread and milk, and she was very nice to us. We didn\u2019t speak about religion,\nabsolutely. And the last day, the last day before we left, she came to me and she said, \u201cI didn\u2019t\nsleep the whole night.\u201d I says, \u201cWhy?\u201d She says, \u201cBecause I just find out, I just notice your\nnumber that you are Jewish and I am Jewish, too. Nobody knows it in the house.\u201d In 1989,\nnobody knows it in the house. \u201cThey are suspicious,\u201d she said. But her husband, I don\u2019t know.\nI don\u2019t remember already her name. But it was a Hungarian name. But he changed his name\nbecause it was a Jewish name. He changed it when he was a school principal. And once, she\nwas telling that she was here in America in Los Angeles for a month and she\u2019s mentioning a\nname, who invited her. And I knew them, those people, that they were Jewish people. In New\nPest, you know? But still I just didn\u2019t realize it that she\u2019s Jewish. And she wouldn\u2019t ask me and\nI wouldn\u2019t ask her. But one day, she wasn\u2019t home and I see... I took the mail, and a letter came\nfrom Israel. And when I gave it to her, she right away put it in her pocket. Because she knew\nthat my sister-in-law was converted and married to a non-Jew and she got that apartment and she\nthought we are not Jewish. She was afraid to say that she is Jewish. So then... it was\nunbelievable. And when we came home, I sent her some nylon panty hose because she couldn\u2019t\nget it. And for two or three years I was writing her. And I didn\u2019t realize it, she said, \u201cI\nmentioned to you so many times who took me, who took me, who invited me...\u201d and her son\nwas there too. I don\u2019t know how long he was in Los Angeles, in California. And I didn\u2019t realize\nit, he went out once with that man, but he was married. And both of them, he and the wife,\ninvited her, but I didn\u2019t... you know? [Laughing.] I didn\u2019t know him personally. But I knew,\nand I knew his name, those people who were in Los Angeles.",
        "Q: Did you...",
        "A: So that\u2019s the situation, and even today, they are hiding people, they are Jews. They are... it\u2019s no\ngood, it\u2019s still no good in Hungary. Under the communism, it was no Jew, we couldn\u2019t say, no\nreligion. They were forcing us to work. A Jewish boss, he was forcing us to work on the Jewish\nholidays and he was a lawyer. And one day, I thought it? I said it? --One day... his secretary\nwas a very nice person. She was Jewish, too. But many people worked there, they were all\nintellectuals, because they were... whatever we had intellectually, if it\u2019s something medical, the\ndoctors that were there and engineers or whatever. It\u2019s very interesting. And he, on the biggest\nholiday, Yom Kippur, he called us to his office, me and his secretary and he made us eat. He\nwas in the Party, the Communist Party because of his job. But who saw it? Why did he have to\ndo it? I couldn\u2019t go to the synagogue, so I went home by bus, I remember. Because it was, we\nlived in New Pest and that was in mid-town. We were passing the street where the synagogue 1s,\nI jumped off the bus at that station and after work I went to the synagogue. And in the\nconcentration camp I didn\u2019t know that it\u2019s holiday or not holiday, but the Polish people knew it.\nAnd they were telling us when it\u2019s Yom Kippur. They knew it from outside the world. Because\npeople who went to work outside, they somehow got in touch with Polish people. And then they\nsaid that tomorrow is like Yom Kippur, so I didn\u2019t eat. I was used not to eat, because eat, the\nfood was only bread when we got off from the work, you know? I was fasting there and I go\nback and I have to eat.",
        "Q: Did you have a sense of faith at the time?",
        "A: At the camp? I lost my faith.",
        "Q: After...",
        "A: In camp, I was always saying, \u201cWhere is God? Where is God,\u201d when I found out what is going\non in camp, that they killed all the little kids. And I says, \u201cWhere is God that he let, that he let it\ndo those people? Where is God? Is ita God?\u201d I absolutely didn\u2019t believe it. I just... I was\nsaying that too, always, that I was, at night when we couldn\u2019t go out after work, when we were\nalready inside, but if we had the chairs just to look outside and look at the stars. And I was\nunbelievable homesick, unbelievable. And I was just always saying, I says, \u201cMy God,\u201d \u2014\u2018my\nGod\u2019 I didn\u2019t say. I just said, \u201cDoes Frank,\u201d Frank was my husband, \u201csee the same stars what\nI\u2019m seeing?\u201d Terrible homesick, and never, never thought that I can survive from there. Never.\nIt was so impossible, you know? It was impossible. First of all, I didn\u2019t know where is\nAuschwitz. I didn\u2019t know that we are close to Krakow, we are in Poland. I knew that we were in\nPoland, but I had no idea where we were. And I never thought that 1t can happen, that the\nRussians are going to liberate it and we have to go.",
        "Q: So after the war when you went to synagogue, did you just go because of tradition?",
        "A: Oh, no. After the war, no, after the war, we lived under communism and we went to synagogue\nsecretly. And it was a, a nursery, a preschool in the synagogue, and George went there. But it\nwas everything secretly. When he went to school he had no religion. He wasn\u2019t allowed to say\nthat he has religion. No religion. When we went to Vienna, for 17 months we lived there. He\nwas the only Jewish kid there. And they were suspicious because they were praying every\nmorning. And once the teacher called me, \u201cWhy does he doesn\u2019t pray?\u201d I said, \u201cBecause he has\nno religion. We lived under communism, that\u2019s why he doesn\u2019t pray.\u201d And every day I was\ndying until he came home from school. I was so afraid what\u2019s going to happen, that they find\nout that he\u2019s Jewish. It was terrible, terrible. Hitler came from Vienna. I told you that. That\neven in 1957, when we went to Vienna, the workers, when they worked, they started with a\nbottle of beer and \u201cHeil Hitler.\u201d",
        "Q: So, when you went, but did you go, you didn\u2019t go to synagogue because you had religious faith?",
        "A: No. When I went back and I found IIlie, Ilona, when I find her and I find her husband, her\nhusband, they weren\u2019t, they weren\u2019t religious. They were religious and not religious. We didn\u2019t\nhave nothing to eat. So my sister-in-law managed to buy every year a... she was close to the\ncountryside and everybody knew them there where they lived. Her husband had a very big\nposition with the state. And he, himself, was an anti-Semite, my sister-in-law\u2019s husband. It\u2019s\nunbelievable. I was telling you about it. Okay. But they managed, somehow, I don\u2019t know\nhow... we got every year a pig. Pig! So, and it was a butcher, who came to the house, and they\nmade for us and for Ilona, for them... my uncle wasn\u2019t alive at that time, Joseph. Because he\nwas very religious, you wouldn\u2019t believe it that he went with a little prayer book to Buchenwald\nand he managed to bring it back with him. Because that time already, they weren\u2019t killing there,\nin Buchenwald, when he got there. And he brought it back. He was very religious. That\u2019s why\nhe stayed with us, and not with Illie, Ilona, because of the pork. But we ate the pork, too. We\nhad it, too. Especially when he died, it was... we ate it because there was nothing else, and we\nhad food for the whole year. George doesn\u2019t know it. He doesn\u2019t remember it, so I am not\ntelling it to him. And I am not telling it even to the grandchildren. Ana is crazy when she would\nhear it. She\u2019s watching always what you are ordering. She is... yeah. But he was the president\nof the synagogue, my uncle, and he was helping many, many Jewish, young boys to go to Israel.\nThat time it was secret. Secretly, they went through Czechoslovakia. So, that way he was\nreligious, but, you know? But we couldn\u2019t show it that we were religious or not religious. But\nwe ate pork. But I got back my religion. I got my belief. I got it back slowly, slowly I got it\nback. I was always thinking about my mother, how he taught us, she taught us to pray in\nCzechoslovakia. And when we went to the synagogue like Friday night or something, I was\nalways thinking about it, how we were crying, but every week we had to read one more page.\nAnd it was so hard for us, myself and my sister. And I was thinking about them. And as I was\nthinking about them always, you know, I got back my religion. And especially when I came to\nAmerica. When I came to America and my uncle was... he wasn\u2019t, he ate everything. I\u2019m not\nsaying that they didn\u2019t cook pork, but he was religious. And I remember him and my father\nwhen they were together and Passover, when they were together. And every Saturday they went\nto the synagogue and then they came to us and they were singing after lunch those songs that you\nare supposed to. And when I thought about those things it came back to me, you know? It\u2019s\nvery interesting. And now I love to go to the synagogue, and I am so heartbroken. I wasn\u2019t there\nnow three weeks, I think. I am missing it. And I\u2019m missing it. We don\u2019t have a rabbi now. He\nleft. I loved him. It\u2019s interesting that he\u2019s near Cincinnati and Ilona was teaching here Sunday\nschool art for four years. And now he\u2019s teaching in his new... she goes down to the new\ncongregation and she\u2019s teaching, but only twice a month because it\u2019s 40 miles away. So, and\nit\u2019s, but... she sees him. And I cannot see them. I was very good friends with... she\u2019s a very\nyoung woman. His wife is from Cincinnati. He\u2019s from Minnesota, the rabbi. And his parents\nwere Czechoslovakians, Czechs. His father, I met his father many times, he\u2019s an optometrist.\nWhen he came visit he still speak Czech.",
        "Q: What was his name? The Rabbi.",
        "A: The Rabbi? Slaten (ph).",
        "Q: And he was at the Orthodox, no it\u2019s ...",
        "A: Conservative.",
        "Q: Conservative.",
        "A: Conservative. Slaten. He has three sons and he was here 11 years. My grandson was the first\nBar Mitzvah with him.",
        "Q: About the question where was God, did you just stop asking it or did you come up with some\nkind of answer?",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t get no answer because I knew what was happening. I didn\u2019t get no answer. But I\nwas just always questioning, \u201cWhere is God? Is there a God,\u201d that\u2019s what I was saying. \u201cIs\nthere a God, does he see what\u2019s happening? Why, why is it happening?\u201d",
        "Q: Do you ask yourself those questions anymore?",
        "A: Yes lam. Why did it happen, actually? Why did it happen? For those innocent little kids, what\ncould they do? What kind of sins they had? Babies. What kind of sins they had that it\nhappened? And then I am going back to Spanish Inquisition. [Laughing.] So what was there?\nThey killed the Jews all over. Always. The Jews are always the [laughing]... for everywhere\nand everything they are blaming the Jews. So, it\u2019s no answer. It\u2019s no answer. First the Blacks\ncame and after that the Jews. Some places they... when they are no Blacks, there are no Blacks,\nthen there are the Jews the first who are blamed for everything. Why? Does anybody knows\nwhy\u201d? I lived under democracy in Czechoslovakia. It was a real, real democracy. Nobody\nknows what\u2019s democracy. Only if somebody lived under that time Masaryk and Benes. They\nalways said, \u201cWe cannot be anti-Semitic, never. Because we have the brain, and we are\nbusinessmen and we are everything what the Jews are.\u201d So I was thinking about it, that it\u2019s\njealousy. It was jealousy from Hitler that they, he took it from... they were supporting him, the\nJews in Germany. They made him big. And then when he knew what they are doing and why,\nthen they killed them and he wanted to have it. Why are they anti, I don\u2019t know, anti-Semitic\nhere, I don\u2019t know. I never heard it from no one, but I can imagine that the Southern Baptist are\nanti-Semitic. I am thinking it only because I was invited [laughing] to every church, every\ndenomination, but never to a Baptist church. So it must be something against the Jews. They\nwon\u2019t say it to your face, but it must be. They know it. They saw me in the paper. They know\nit. And I was never, never, and I was on every Christian church. What is that? How do you call\nit? What is it? And I\u2019m telling it to the children. I\u2019m finishing my speech, and I\u2019m saying it to\nthem that why I am doing it, I\u2019m doing it that you should learn not to hate and you should teach\nyour parents not to hate, because I don\u2019t think so that a little kid knows what is to hate. It\u2019s\ncoming from somewhere, from the adults. Correct?",
        "Q: Can you remember and describe the events of the 1956 Uprising?",
        "A: Yes. In 1956...",
        "Q: From your perspective.",
        "A: ...Nixon was in Hungary at that time. And the students from university, they got in touch with\nhim. And what was discussed, what wasn\u2019t discussed, I don\u2019t know between them, but when\nNixon left, next day, it was the Uprising. The students, the college students, they took over the\nradio station. That was the first. We didn\u2019t have televisions. That was the first. And the\nRussians actually never left Hungary and they were all over scattered in the woods and around.\nBut we didn\u2019t see them in the cities, but they were there. And it was communism. And Nixon\nwas telling them, \u201cDo it.\u201d\u201d How do we know that? Because the last Prime minister, Nagy, Imre\nNagy, who was killed by the Russians. He was on the radio and he was begging, he was begging\nAmerica and he was begging Nixon, he was telling him, \u201cOkay, do it.\u201d He thought that we get\nsome help. So they came in with their tanks and with their soldiers. It was a war. They\nbombed...\nEnd of Tape 4, Side A\nTape 4, Side B",
        "A: ...the apartment that we lived in Budapest, yes. We lived there. And so when they came in in\n19... no that was 1956, the uprising. Up to that point it was all right. We worked and we were\ncommunist, but we worked. I mean, the wealthy people were very afraid and we were very\nafraid with my uncle, that they are going to take them. Because they came at night. They\nknocked on the doors, and taked people on they, on their cars, on their... the Russians, with\nmachine guns. And they took them to villages, and they took them to villages and they left them.\nThere were certain villages where they were designated where they took the wealthy people.\nAnd they couldn\u2019t come back to Budapest. But thank God, thank God it never happened.\nBecause that was against... again, it was somebody had to tell them who are the wealthy people.\nAnd they were in very good friendship with everybody from the higher-ups there. Because that\nwas a borough, New Pest, where we lived. And like New York has five boroughs, the same\nthing Budapest has. And so they knew everybody, and they were friends with everybody, and so\nnobody told on them, so they weren\u2019t taken away. Their business was taken away, but they\ndidn\u2019t. They weren\u2019t taken away. What was done to them, they had to move together, the two\nfamilies, in one apartment, because it was too big for two people. Gorgeous apartment. House.\nAnd they took away they apartment and they had to live together, the sister-in-laws and brother-\nin-law, two brothers. And they had to rent the upstairs apartment. They decided that they\u2019d take\nthe first floor and the second floor, it was a doctor, a gynecologist with his family. But they\ndidn\u2019t take them out. And from that, that they take out many wealthy people, many wealthy\npeople married non-Jews, but not that non-Jews, but it wasn\u2019t a match. Just only because those\npeople were giving them stay, somewhere to stay. Because it is an example, my cousin, I have a\nsecond cousin in Budapest, my mother and her mother were sisters, cousins. I\u2019m sorry, first\ncousins. And she is the only one who survived from that family, nobody. She had two uncles\nand the grandmothers were sisters, my grandmother and her grandmother were sisters and that\u2019s\nhow the mothers were first cousins, my mother and her mother. And she was an only child and\nthe only survivor. She survived. Her parents put her in a factory. I didn\u2019t tell you all that? I\ndon\u2019t know. To a factory where they were making like General Electric. They were making\nlight bulbs. It was Tungsraum (ph), it was a very well known company. I think, in fact, now\nafter the war, they are together, Tungsraum and General Electric. Something, I don\u2019t know. But\nyoung girls, they worked there. And when they took her parents, she was working there and they\nslept there and everything. So they worked for the army and when they finished with the work,\nwhen the work was finished, they let them go. But they didn\u2019t have where to go, because they\nwere, nobody was there already, we were all gone. And that\u2019s... I think I, somewhere I said that\nstory, that she was hiding. One of her aunts had a maid and she recommended where to go, to a\nwoman, who was non-Jewish and her husband was Jewish and he was in labor camp. And she\nhad a house. And she took in about eight people, Jewish people. It was a doctor, it was my\ncousins and her boyfriend and I don\u2019t know, about eight people. And she was hiding them. I\ntold that story?",
        "A: You did mention that story.",
        "Q: Okay. So why did we say that?",
        "Q: So, going back to the 1956 uprising... remembering the events of the uprising.",
        "A: ... 1956, okay. They came in with their tanks and they were horrible. They were raping girls, the\nsoldiers, the Russian soldiers.",
        "Q: Did you see that happening?",
        "A: No, no, but we were very worried, because we had a maid at that time. We were very close to\nher. And it was terrible. I remember that it was George\u2019s birthday and he wanted a car. Before\nthat he knew what he wants in the toy store and we went, we went there and stood on line to get\nhim the car. And the tanks were turned towards us. The end was so close to us. Every minute,\nor when we are standing for bread, the tanks were turned always to shoot us. It was terrible.\nThen, one day, I don\u2019t know what happened... not one day, they did it many times. But they\nwere very close to us and they were shooting during the night. And we were in the apartment\nand basements were on the other side of the building, the basements, and we had to run to the\nother side with the children. I had at that time my cousin\u2019s, who was in Russia, his two\ndaughters. They were with us because they went somewhere for vacation and it happened under\nthe vacation. And they lived far, very far from us. They lived in Buda, what was very far from\nus and they couldn\u2019t pick up the children. And they stayed with us, two little girls. We had to go\nto the basement because they were shelling in the backyard. Terrible. I don\u2019t know how many\nnights we spent in the basement. When it stopped, when they already were in control, I don\u2019t\nknow how long it took them. It took them a long time, and they were in control. Then Austria\nopened the borders, their borders and people who lived close, they could just walk over to\nAustria. And thousands and thousands, and mostly the peasants, because they were all farmlands\naround the border, you know? They went all over to Austria and in Austria they put up camps\nfor them and America was sending money for it. We were far away, we couldn\u2019t go, because we\nwere 400 miles away from the border, in Budapest. So we couldn\u2019t go. That story is in. How\ndid I get out, and the Russians. That\u2019s in.",
        "Q: I wanted to ask you... we\u2019ll go on to Vienna and then talk about your journey to the United\nStates. But I wanted to ask you whether you wanted to say anything about your husband and\nyour relationship with him, because last time we talked you said he was a stranger to you and\nthen all of sudden you met him after the war.",
        "A: He was a stranger to me 1n that way, that I knew him for three weeks, when he wanted to marry\nme. And then he couldn\u2019t marry me because I was underage. And then they took him in labor\ncamp. He was away, and I don\u2019t know, a few times he wrote me cards. But I didn\u2019t know\nwhat\u2019s going to happen, whether he stays with me whether he will wait for me. And he was four\nyears in labor camps, so I didn\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen. But I really... that\u2019s why I say\nthat I really didn\u2019t know him. I told you about the other boy, whom I went with somebody for\nfour years. So, I was very mixed up. I was very mixed up. I don\u2019t know whether I fell in love\nwith my husband right away. But my heart was broken when the other one find out and then\nwrote me a letter, \u201cWhy did I do it?\u201d If he would know that I need a name, he would marry me\nright away. And... but it was late already, everything was arranged that he fell in love with me,\nmy husband. So... he was seven years older, and I knew he was very good looking. And I knew\nwho was the family, first of all, because my aunt and his aunt were very good friends. So, I\nknew the family from my own... and I didn\u2019t know what\u2019s going to be, and when I met him, you\nknow, when we came back, I was terribly crying and he was crying, too. But he knew I\u2019m alive.\nHe knew, because he knew months ago already when they got the notice. But he was waiting for\nme. But I wasn\u2019t sure whether he has somebody in between or not, though we got married. We\nwere married in 1944, in February, when we got married. For two weeks we were together and\nthat was that. And I was always, you know, afraid that they are going to take me still. I am\nmarried, but we went to a hotel, I remember on the marriage night. It was unbelievable. We\nwent down to eat. It was in the city, a beautiful hotel. And everybody constantly was afraid that\nthey are coming and asking for identification and that kind of a thing. It was horrible. So I said,\n\u201cLet\u2019s check out. I don\u2019t want to stay here.\u201d We went back. We went back, and we stayed with\nmy grandmother, and then we stayed with Ilika, too, with Ilona. I[lika is a, in Hungarian, I don\u2019t\nknow what it is in any language. If somebody has a name, they make it like softer. Ilika is softer\nthan Ilona. You know? But that\u2019s from Ilona, so we called her Ilika. And I was Milika, my\nname was Millie, I mean my nickname is Millie. Nobody knew me as Emilie, only in school,\nand at work. But otherwise, the whole family and my friends... and then we came to America, I\ndidn\u2019t know that it\u2019s an American name, too. And I never mentioned it. It was always Emilie\nand that was it. But my friends are still calling me Millie on the phone and my cousin and\neverybody is calling me. I have a cousin in Canada. My cousin who was eight years in Siberia,\nseven years, from \u201841 to \u201848. He hasason. And he escaped after \u201856, they sent him, the parents.\nHe went to University at that time already, two years as an engineer. And he was, when he came\nback he was a communist. He wasn\u2019t a communist, he was in the party and because of that, that\nhe was in Russia and spoke already Russian, he got a very big job in the Ministry. He was... as\nan engineer. He knew that he never can come to America, because he was in the Communist\nParty. So when it was finished, the communism, when the... I mean, when they opened the\nborders, he sent his son alone to Vienna. But he had to go to Israel, because the plan was that the\nparents are going to come after him to Israel. They knew that he cannot come to America. We\nweren\u2019t here. And so he went alone to Israel, but the mother had there a lot of friends, his\nmother, and he stayed with the friends. And he went to the Israeli Army and he was an officer,\ntoo. And the parents went after him, they got passport. Parents and two sisters, who were born\nafter he came home, the two sisters. But he escaped with his mother\u2019s mother\u2014grandmother,\ngrandfather and he\u2014they escaped the middle of Budapest. I don\u2019t know whether you heard\nabout Wallenberg, that Swedish man? He was hiding them. He was from that group and his\nmother, and his grandmother and grandfather. Grandmother. Grandfather died before they went\nto Israel. The grandmother went with them to Israel and she died in Israel. My cousin went with\nthem. I mean of course he went with them. He died in Israel. And it is very interesting that his\nfather was in the First World War and he got... he was in Siberia, too, his father. And he got a\nnerve disease, nerves. It was terrible. I remember him very well. That was my mother\u2019s sister\u2019s\nhusband. And he got the same disease in Israel. He was a young man. He was 60, 62 when he\ndied. And he got a job as an engineer, but in a different field. It was a margarine factory where\nhe was in engineering, like making colognes and that kind of, you know? Entirely different. But\nthey were okay. Her father gave a lot of money to Israel, so they were okay in Israel. The two\nsisters, my cousin\u2019s two sisters were in Israel, the two sisters. And the mother, she was here.\nWhen she was 75 years old, she came to Canada and she came to me here and it was winter and\nshe says, \u201cGod, I love to see the snow. I never snow since I am in Israel.\u201d It was a big snow\nwhen she was here. And she spent her 75\" birthday here. And two years later she died. She had\ndiabetes and she didn\u2019t take care of herself. She ate everything in the world, but she lived well.\nI spoke to her daughter and she said, \u201c\u201cThat\u2019s the only thing, we are happy that she lived well.\u201d",
        "Q: Let\u2019s go back, because we got off the subject, you were talking about your relationship with your\nhusband.",
        "A: So again. So, I wasn\u2019t, when I came back. So I said, this was a long, long time. I don\u2019t know,\nmaybe he find somebody. I don\u2019t know. I was two weeks his wife, that\u2019s it. I got back. I met\nhim before they came, before they took us, he came to the ghetto. I told you that. But it was just\nthat, nothing, no relationship, we just met. [Laughing.] And then he left the ghetto and five\nminutes later we were surrounded. But he was telling me that, \u201cDon\u2019t let you take them to the\nwagons.\u201d I didn\u2019t know what he\u2019s talking about. He saw it on the way from Romania, of course,\nRomania, it was near the border there where they were. What they are doing, they\u2019re putting\npeople... and when the wagons came, I remembered his words, I says, \u201cDon\u2019t let you put\nyourself ...\u201d\u00bb Does he know that there are guns involved here? He didn\u2019t know that it was done\nwith machine guns. But he told me that \u201cYou are going to get a Christian birth certificate and\nyou come with me.\u201d It was true, everything. I told you that I find the birth certificate here. I\ndidn\u2019t know about it. Last time when he was in Hungary he brought everything. His sister was\nvery sick for ten years, but her son-in-law is a doctor and he kept her alive. Because he was\ntelling me when we were there, if not me, she wouldn\u2019t be alive anymore. Because the daughter\nwas always hysterical and even from meetings she called him. He was in a hospital like here,\nWalter Reed. He was there, a pathologist, under the Communism. So, he had a big job. And\nshe called him, \u201cRight away come and give mother injections,\u201d she yelled. And I was there\nwhen she did it. And he right away left everything, came and gave her injections. I think that\nshe had liver cancer, that\u2019s what I think. Because she had diabetes, diabetes, I don\u2019t know\nwhether it counts for me, that that family had diabetes, but my father\u2019s sister had diabetes in\nRussia. So it was in the family. I always forgot about it and when they were asking me, \u201cDid\nanybody have it in the family?\u201d And I always say, \u201cI don\u2019t know, they were killed when they\nwere 45 years old.\u201d And I know my grandmother didn\u2019t have it. I know the other sister didn\u2019t\nhave it. At that time I probably... I didn\u2019t know even that his sister had it, because she was\nwriting, my father, always to his sister. And he translated the letters to us, but I didn\u2019t think\nabout it, you know, that she had it. And now he was telling me, my cousin, that she had even a\nleg amputated because of diabetes. So it is in my family. But I don\u2019t know whether I got it. I\ndon\u2019t know. Because it was really, I had such a good doctor for 27 years and he never said that\u2019s\ndiabetes. Only my periodontist always said that I have diabetes because of my gums. It was\nalways, he said, \u201cWhat are they talking about, you have diabetes?\u201d And he always said, \u201cNo,\nyou don\u2019t have diabetes, it\u2019s just elevated because of the medications what you are taking.\u201d Here\nthe urologist was arguing with me, that I don\u2019t have... I had urinary tract infection. And he said,\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have diabetes. What are they talking about? Because it\u2019s not in your urine.\u201d Would\nyou believe that? Well, anyway. So then, when we lived in Eger, and we started to know each\nother. And right away, I got pregnant, a month later I got pregnant. We got very close and he\nwas a very, very good man. Very good. He had such a heart. He was so good. He never said,\nlike George, he never said nothing bad about nobody. And he tried to help people and he was a\nperson like, he worked in a hospital, and he... like nobody, you know... even in New York they\ndon\u2019t care about the Blacks. He shook hands with the elevator man or whatever. You know?\nHe was unbelievable good. Unbelievable. And when he retired, even before he retired, he went\nwithout me to Hungary, because I right away had four weeks vacation with the hospital. And\nwhen he retired, he went every year back to Hungary to see his sister. But the main thing to see\nthe children\u2019s grave. And one day I told him, \u201cListen Frank, you see I am the mother. You think\nthat I don\u2019t think about them?\u201d I says, \u201cYou go only to the stones. You must realize it, that you\ngo only to the stones.\u201d He says, \u201cYes, but at least I can fix up the letters if they are, you know,\nnot in shape.\u201d They are not buried separate. They are buried with my Uncle Joseph, in the same\ngrave, the two little kids. And then that was that reason, that he has an only sister and she\u2019s very\nsick. And then when he was very sick, he had a terrible heart attack in \u201881 and in \u201882, 17 months\nhe lived. And in between that he went to Hungary. I said to the doctor, \u201cWhat shall I tell him,\nthat he cannot go?\u201d He says, \u201cNo, he can go, but he cannot go around nowhere else, just to\nHungary. And he\u2019ll be all right there because his nephew is a doctor and he will be very safe\nthere.\u201d And I called him every week on the phone. And he said, \u201cI\u2019m fine, I\u2019m fine.\u201d Three-\nquarters of his heart was gone. \u201cI am fine,\u201d he said. And I always gave the report to the doctor.\nAnd he says, \u201cHe\u2019s fine because probably he sees sicker people around him, and then he has the\nnephew there\u2019. And that was the reason, because when he came back in July, end of June...\nevery July we were in the country for Ilona\u2019s, Ilona was born July 3\u2122 and I left a week vacation\nfor that, and we went to the country house, and he came back before that and he came with us\nand he was fine. We wanted to go, all of us, to Canada after. It\u2019s not close, but it\u2019s on the same\nhighway to go to Toronto, where it\u2019s close, like a country house. It was a long ride, but still it\nwas... I don\u2019t know about four, 500 hundred miles, through Niagara Falls. We wanted to all of\nus go, and he said, \u201cYou know what? I came from a long trip now, I go home myself. I drive\nhome myself. And you go with them.\u201d Laura was pregnant with Ana. And he was so happy,\nbecause he always wanted a lot of children. He was crazy for children. And George was an only\nchild, because the two others died. And he always, he was very happy. He loved them so much.\nThat\u2019s the last picture from them before he left. That was only Jacob and Ilona. And he... 1t was\nin April. No. No, because George took him to the airport. It was before he left. He died in \u201882.\nWhile we were in Canada, he got sick and he went himself to the hospital. They took him in\nIntensive Care, Coronary Care, I don\u2019t even know. But I called him when he was already home.\nAnd he said, \u201cBring a present to so and so.\u201d I says, \u201cWhy?\u201d He said, \u201cBecause he helped me. I\nwas in the hospital.\u201d So right away I packed and I went back. And in August he died. I wasn\u2019t\neven around. You know that story? It was terrible. He was so good. And he was so worried\nabout me, because when I was sick, he didn\u2019t get undressed. He was... the whole... because I\nhad two heart attacks, in \u201867 and in \u201870. So, it was always me they were worried about. So, he\nwas always, he didn\u2019t get undressed and he was... unbelievable nurse, you know? He was very,\nvery good. And with the children, everything they... what we had, and every vacation they were\nalways for those two children, because they lived upstairs. They lived in the same house. He\nloved them. He loved George. He loved them. He was very upset that he\u2019s an artist, because he\nthought that, he always of the Hungarian artist, and he was always telling them, \u201cYou know how\nthe artists are living? They are going barefoot because they don\u2019t have money for they...\u201d\n[Laughing.] You know, he was always worried. But when he said that \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I am going\nto teach.\u201d Then he was very happy, and he was always the first one whom George called. That\n\u201cT got tenure, I got even...\u201d no, he wasn\u2019t alive when he got full professor, only when he got\ntenure. He was alive. And he was very happy, and with every exhibition, though he didn\u2019t like\nhis paintings. But he said he loves it, because he went from that kind of a, ultra-modern. But he\nwas supporting him. And that was everything for him, George was everything. That\u2019s why we\nbought the house there, that he should have a studio. But he always said to him, \u201cIf you want to\nbe a real artist, don\u2019t get married.\u201d But he wanted to be an artist, but he... I mean, he didn\u2019t have\nno one else but us, that was a family, so he wanted a family. So he got married. And he loves\nhis children. He\u2019s a very good father, and he\u2019s very good to me, unbelievable good to me. And\nnobody can understand it.",
        "Q: Why is that?",
        "A: His wife cannot understand it. And I, I... because they don\u2019t know what 1s it... we went once to\na psychiatrist, because she was very jealous of his love towards me. She cannot, she cannot\nunderstand it that somebody can love two people different way. And the psychiatrist explained it\nto me. She would never understand it, because she never got along with her mother. She loved\nher father, and the minute her father died, she left home. So, she would never understand it. So,\nI said to him, \u201cSo Iam here, why I am here? You won\u2019t understand me either.\u201d It was an Italian\nguy. I said, \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t understand me. What is it to be in the world alone? Two of us,\nnobody, no family, just two of us. Would you understand that?\u201d So he says, \u201cI didn\u2019t know that,\nshe didn\u2019t tell that.\u201d\u2019 The trouble was, I walked in, he said... walked in. I was in wheelchair,\nbecause I fell on the steps here. 18 steps, and in the wheelchair I was forced to go to the\npsychiatrist. And he said to me, when I walked in, he says... Laura wasn\u2019t there, we went\ntogether and separate. And he says, \u201cHow many times your son called you when you were in\nNew York?\u201d I says, \u201cThat\u2019s the complaint?\u201d I says, \u201cIf you are a good son...\u201d You. That\u2019s how\nI talked to him, \u201c\u2018and your father would die, and your mother is alone in the world, you wouldn\u2019t\ncall her every night? And I paid the telephone bills.\u201d So, that she was complaining that he\u2019s\ncalling me every night when the father died. And sometimes saying, and it was something, no,\nbetween us and Ilona, which I thank God, Iona... he always told me, \u201cYou can always count on\nIlona.\u201d He loved Ilona. Jacob was very little. He loved Jacob, but Ilona was six... \u201882 and she\nwas born \u201976, six years old. So Ilona was already a bigger girl. And she always said, \u201cYou\nalways can count on Iona.\u201d And I must tell you, he was always teaching me if he dies, what 1s\ngoing to happen and how much I should divulge. I says, \u201cFrank, please don\u2019t talk about that.\u201d\nHe says, \u201cI know I am going to die when I am 69.\u201d I says, \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d He\nsays, \u201cBecause my uncle came home from hunting, he was fine, too. And he dropped dead when\nhe was 69. And he had a heart attack,\u201d so every night\u2014I didn\u2019t sleep many nights with him\u2014\nevery night he got shaved, he got dressed, and he was sleeping in that chair. He was always\nprepared that he has to go to the hospital or something, after the heart attack. It was terrible.\nAnd he was always teaching me what to do and how to do it. \u201cAnd I leave you enough,\u201d he said,\n\u201cthat you can live like a princess if you want to, but if you want to live with your daughter-in-\nlaw...\u201d\nEnd of Tape 4, Side B\nTape 5, Side A",
        "Q: Okay, tape number five, side A of an interview with Emilie Szekely. And you told on the other\ntape about your... how you got out of Hungary. And then you went to Vienna? Can you talk\nabout what you did in Vienna?",
        "A: You know how we got out from Hungary? That you know? Okay. In Vienna I worked for\nInternational Rescue Committee. Their office was in New York, and it was there a boarding\nschool in the Vienna woods. A Hungarian teacher was in Vienna from New York, who came\nthere, he had his mother and sister in Hungary, and he wanted to help them to come over. And\nhis idea was to make a boarding school for the Hungarian refugee children. Those were all\npeasants\u2019 children. The parents got... is 1t on the tape once already? No. The peasants who\ncame over and they got a contract in Santo Domingo, I don\u2019t know how many hundreds, that\nthey get land there and they can work there and they get everything. Food and everything. And\nsomehow, somehow, they couldn\u2019t get in touch with nobody, but somehow the International\nRescue Committee find out that they didn\u2019t get nothing. They put them on the fields and they\ndidn\u2019t give them nothing. So they managed to bring them back. So, they brought them back to\nVienna and the parents, they put to the two camps. And the children, for the children, who were\nyoung, school kids, young, elementary school kids, and there were some bigger ones, they made\nthat boarding school. It was a beautiful, beautiful place and it was like a palace in the woods.\nAnd he talked them into it, that he will be head of the school. And because they helped them\nanyway, the International Rescue Committee. This way they can go to school. So we had seven\nHungarian teachers there. And the young ones had school there. And the older ones he took to\nthe village, the first time I saw the... the Volkswagen bus. He had a Volkswagen bus. He took\nthem by bus to German schools. And they were looking for a person for the office, one person\ndoes everything. And my... Ilona\u2019s sister-in-law, who was already in Vienna\u2014she\u2019s Ilona, too,\nboth of them\u2014she spoke and was always corresponding, that\u2019s what she did, in German, French,\nEnglish, Hungarian. And she worked for his very, very... her very, very, very, very rich cousin,\nwho... he was so rich that he lived in an apartment in the middle of Vienna with his wife and two\nchildren near the opera house where Franz Josef, Franz Josef\u2019s girl friend lived. And\nunbelievable, unbelievable, the whole first floor with the same furniture. And he was ina\nbusiness that time that started, I don\u2019t know what kind of electronics they started to make. And\nhe was a big businessman. He was in Hungary, too, but in time he went to Vienna. And he\nworked in his office, she worked in his office. And she didn\u2019t get enough, she thought that she\ndidn\u2019t get enough pay, then she went to American Embassy, asked for a job. Because she has\nthose, wonderful, wonderful really, she was wonderful typist, too. And they recommended her\nto that job for International Rescue Committee. Because the International Rescue Committee\nwas in connection with the... they were connected to the embassy, American Embassy. And she\ngot that job. And when she said it to the cousin that she\u2019s leaving because she can get more\nmoney, the cousin said, \u201cI give you the same money.\u201d So then she wanted to stay, because she\ndidn\u2019t have to travel. I had to travel by bus out of Vienna and then from the bus I had to walk in\nthe woods. And in the winter it was terrible, big snow and I had to walk to work. But anyway.\nSo, she said, \u201cLook, go there and tell him that you are my relative, and I have to give two weeks\nnotice. I cannot leave right away, I have to give note and I can fill it in for her.\u201d So right away\nhe says, \u201cOkay.\u201d He gives me a petty cash box with money. That was so funny because I wasn\u2019t\nused to that kind of a thing. And he told me what 1s the job, that I have to do the payroll. I have\nto pay the people. I have to, I don\u2019t know. I had to do the bookkeeping, but I never did. I took it\nhome for my husband, because that was his job. I hated bookkeeping. And I never knew how to\ndo it, but he graduated business school. He was a wonderful bookkeeper, so he did the\nbookkeeping. He didn\u2019t know. But when it came... he didn\u2019t know that I am taking it home.\nBut when it came that I had to go with the German... not accountant, who was he? Gosh... he\nwas an accountant, yes he was an accountant. And I had to give, where, what office, somewhere\nI had to go at the end of the year. Because it\u2019s the same thing, taxes. He says, \u201cWhat about?\u201d I\ncouldn\u2019t answer and I told him, \u201cI am not doing it, my husband is doing it.\u201d [Laughing] I told\nhim. He didn\u2019t care about it. But anyway two weeks later when it was two weeks, he says,\n\u201cWhere is Mrs. Schwartz?\u201d Her name... I says, \u201cShe decided to stay. If you want to keep me,\nokay. If not, thank you that you kept me.\u201d She says, \u201cYes, I want to keep you.\u201d That\u2019s how I\ngot the job and they paid me in American money. I got the... oh, the Germans didn\u2019t want me.\nThey didn\u2019t want to give me the... you had to have a certification that you can work there. I was\nno citizen. And they wanted the job. So in the kitchen it was a German woman, who was the\neverything, you know, she was overlooking and buying and everything. She was a German\nwoman, but I was in the office. And then he got it. He got in touch with the Embassy and\nwhatever and I got it. I still have it, the okay that I can work. And I got paid in American\nmoney. It was... I don\u2019t know, to me it seemed very much, because it was... I don\u2019t remember\nhow much I got. But we didn\u2019t live in a camp, we didn\u2019t. We lived in an apartment, we lived\ntogether with Ilona and her husband. We had together an apartment. And George went to school\nand she took care of George. And she took back and forth him to school. And then in summer,\nGeorge came with me there, when it was summer vacation. And they brought out there... they\ndid everything for those kids. Unbelievable. And they brought a German artist there to teach\nthem art in the summer. And George was, my George was in the group. And the first time he\npainted a head on a piece of wood. A piece of wood what was cut out from a tree. And he\npainted it, oil painting. And the guy came to me and he says, \u201cDo you know whom you have\nhere?\u201d I says, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d He said, \u201cHe\u2019ll be a great artist.\u201d Can you imagine that?\nAnd then in New York, too, in elementary... he came to middle school. He didn\u2019t lose nothing.\nHe was in middle school, and there too the teacher came to the house. And he said, \u201cDo you\nknow...\u201d the same words. I said, \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d He says, \u201cYou must come to\nthe principal with me.\u201d I went to the principal, and they showed me his work, what is he doing.\nSo, he wanted him to go to an art school in Manhattan, a high school. I don\u2019t know what was the\nname of it. And we misunderstood it. We thought it was music and art high school. And we\ntook him to music and art high school. And it was, oh God, he was traveling on the subways,\nand that was, you know, it was so far away. Were you in New York? Yeah? It was near the\nCity University, behind City University, behind Columbia University. And he was traveling for\nfour years, because he had a portfolio and they took him. So he went already to music and art\nhigh school. And he was really good. And after that he went to Cooper Union, where they take\nonly 50 kids from 500, he was amongst them. And Cooper Union 1s free, you know, that\u2019s a\nFoundation. And we just had to pay for the materials, but we didn\u2019t have to pay for his college.\n50 took, about 50 from 500 applicants. He was amongst them. So we finished that. He never\nwanted to go out-of-town college. He was accepted to Penn State University, and I don\u2019t know\nwhere else he applied in case he cannot get to Cooper. But he never wanted to leave us. He said,\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t come to America to be separated.\u201d We were three of us, that\u2019s it. My uncle was still\nalive, but we were three of us.",
        "Q: Tell me something, did you talk to George about your family history, and what had happened to\nyour family during the Holocaust, and what had happened to you, from the time he was a child?",
        "A: He knows. Everything. First of all he knows, he listened to the tape. I always talked about it.\nAnd he... sometimes I am mixing it up, that 1t was my husband to whom I talked or to him. But\nhe knows it. He knows it. And I have written down everything, but unfortunately I wrote it\nHungarian and he cannot read it anymore, Hungarian. And I really have to write it over in\nEnglish, though I have tapes and for every kids. I think my whole lifetime is in the tapes, so I\ndon\u2019t know whether it\u2019s important to write it down. But no, Ana gave me a batch that I have to\nput down the whole family history because they are making family trees, and for me, for my\nhusband, for my husband\u2019s sisters and everything, in the school. She\u2019s asking. They are not\naware of it, the grandchildren, just about the Holocaust. He knew my husband, they knew, all of\nthem knew my husband. Not all of them. Ana didn\u2019t know. Anna just always saying that \u201cThat\nchair was grandpa\u2019s and I want to save it.\u201d They didn\u2019t have really... they don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: When you were in Vienna were you waiting for a visa?",
        "A: Okay, that we didn\u2019t know. It was a quota was over. Closed. They let in so many people\neverywhere, that 1t was no open quota. That\u2019s why we had to stay in Vienna. And we stayed 17\nmonths. After 17 months they give for 1,000 people, and we were amongst the first ones\nbecause the International Rescue Committee took us. I had my uncle and he sent an affidavit,\nbut we didn\u2019t need it because they paid for us and they took us, the International Rescue\nCommittee. And we were the very first ones. The interesting thing was that by that time, maybe\nhalf a year before, we had a Baroness, a real Baroness Reitzes (ph) was her name, working as\na... over the housekeeping. She didn\u2019t do nothing actually. She lived in the middle of Vienna\nand she had a beautiful apartment, because we were there. She invited us. And she had a car,\nshe came every, she wanted a job. Her husband was Jewish, and he was killed somewhere in\nlabor camp. And she lived alone. She was a fat woman. And she had... her mother lived here,\nin New York. But she stayed in Vienna and she lived a big life. She had a big dog, I remember.\nAnd she had a housekeeper, but she wanted a job. She wanted a job. And she had a car and\nwhen she came, she picked me up every day by car and took me home by car, so it was much\neasier on me. But the interesting thing was that I never told her that I was in concentration camp.\nI never told her. I somehow, I don\u2019t know, they didn\u2019t see the number and... I don\u2019t know. I\nnever say, never told even that I was Jewish, to her. He knew probably, he knew, of course he\nknew. Haber was his name. He was a school teacher in New York. That was his idea. And I\ndon\u2019t know what happened to him, and to the school, too. Of course it\u2019s not there anymore.\nHabdersdorf (ph) was the name of the village. And she, when we got the okay to come, we had\nto go to Salzburg, to the Embassy. There was the American Embassy was in Salzburg, yes. And\nso she took us by car, three of us, to Salzburg. It was a beautiful, beautiful road. Unbelievable\nscenery. And then when we parted, I told her that Iam Jewish. [Laughing.|] She knew that I\nwas in concentration camp. She didn\u2019t know up to that point and she was very upset that I didn\u2019t\ntell her before that I was in concentration camp. I never told anybody.",
        "Q: Did you not tell anybody because you were afraid or...?",
        "A: I never... I was very uncomfortable in Vienna. When we first, it was May when we got there\nand beautiful and we had... already it was arranged for us an apartment when we came. My\nuncle\u2019s brother arranged. And he was a Jewish man, who was saved in Singapore. He went with\nhis son to Singapore. A very interesting man and he lived alone, an elderly man. And he had a\npretty nice big apartment. And he had only one room for himself, and he gave two rooms and\nthe kitchen to us. And so we were there and the windows were open. And when I got up in the\nmorning and I heard the German language under the window, I got so crazy. I went crazy. My\nhusband couldn\u2019t get a job. He didn\u2019t speak German. He couldn\u2019t get a job, but they gave him\nsome kind of a... oh, no. When we left I got a letter from the International Rescue Committee\nthat when we arrive we should go to New York, to their main office and show them the letter that\nI work for them. And we got a counselor there, and we went in and I give him the letter. I didn\u2019t\nsay nowhere, it doesn\u2019t say nowhere that story? I gave him the letter, and he looks at me and\nsays, \u201cI don\u2019t believe it that you don\u2019t remember me.\u201d I says, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, how do you know\nme?\u2019 She says, \u201cI was in the school there. They came some, observe the school from New\nYork, the International Rescue Committee. Don\u2019t you remember I was there with my wife and I\nwas in one car with you going back to Vienna?\u201d Then I remembered. I didn\u2019t even think about\nit, you know, that is somebody. So, he was very nice. He said, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to show me the\nletter, I know what you did there, but I must tell you, you did there everything. But in America\nyou have to do one thing, and good, not so many things what you did there in the office. I\u2019m\ngoing to send you to NCR school.\u201d When I heard bookkeeping, I just didn\u2019t... you know? I\ndidn\u2019t say no, but I didn\u2019t go, when he told me to go to. What happened, I didn\u2019t know that, I got\npregnant. And I know it\u2019s that I got pregnant in Salzburg. I remember it, but I didn\u2019t know that I\ngot pregnant. I didn\u2019t know. I had my period every month and I didn\u2019t know that I\u2019m pregnant.\nAnd three months later I started to bleed like terribly and I didn\u2019t know that I\u2019m pregnant. And I\nwent to the doctor and he said you are pregnant, but you are going to have a miscarriage, because\nyou have fibroids. So, I didn\u2019t go to International School. And he called me on the phone and\nhe called me when I came back from the hospital. And I says, \u201cI was sick, and that\u2019s what\nhappened. I had a miscarriage,\u201d I told him. \u201cAnd I couldn\u2019t go.\u201d But when I was better, they\nkept me, I was in the fourth month, and they kept me there five days. They thought every day\nthe babies, four months. I was dying there. I lost so much blood. But then finally they did it.\nAnd they said that \u201cYou have to come back in six weeks and you have to have a hysterectomy.\u201d\nAnd six weeks later I went back and they said, \u201cNo you don\u2019t need it. It was so big, everything\nbecause you were pregnant. You don\u2019t need a hysterectomy.\u201d So then I went back. When he\ncalled me, I said, \u201cNo, I can\u2019t go now.\u201d So he sent me to NCR school. NCR was not the cashier\nmachines, they were NCR machines, the cashier, you know. They had big, big bookkeeping\nmachines, before the computers. Big bars, rechangeable that you could do everything. You\ncould go, big papers with monthly statements and you could go checks. Other side I could put\nthe vendor\u2019s card and put down to whom I am paying. And I went there and I learned it in one\nweek. Oh, he asked whether I can type, I says, \u201cYes, I can type.\u201d So they taught me for the\nmachine in one week and they gave me a job after one week. I didn\u2019t have any experience, but I\nknew how to do the machine. And they gave me a job in a publishing company in Manhattan,\nColumbus Square or Circle or what was it. And I had to travel from Brooklyn. I was so sick on\nthe subways that I was more in the doctor\u2019s office than at home. It was terrible. I cannot, even\nin Hungary what is above the ground I was always standing outside on the air. I couldn\u2019t travel.\nAnd that was underground and was going on in New York subways. It was terrible. And that\nwas a publisher, who made some kind of a... I don\u2019t know whether it was comic books or what it\nwas, Ihave no... Publishing company. And they were two machines, it was a receivable and a\npayable. And I was the payable and the other guy, a guy, a young guy, who was very helpful.\nAnd he tried to teach me, because I knew the machine, but I didn\u2019t have experience. I didn\u2019t\nhave the speed, first of all, and if I made a mistake, I didn\u2019t know how to correct it. And he was\nvery, very helpful. But the comptroller... not comptroller, liked me very much, the comptroller,\nbut the bookkeeper, who was from Massachusetts, I didn\u2019t know from my life. I didn\u2019t know\nwhere is Massachusetts [laughing], and he was so proud of it, that he 1s from Massachusetts. He\nwas amisery. And he was a Jew. And he made my life, he got back the checks from the bank,\nwhat I was typing. And he found mistakes. He was so miserable and he said to me, \u201cYou just\ncame. You are a refugee, and you right away have to sit in an office?\u201d Can you imagine? A\nJew. I was very miserable. It was 60 dollars a week, what was a nice pay at that time. And they\ngave me even commissions. I don\u2019t know what was it, from sale or something. I was there for\nthree months and I was constantly looking for another job. And one day from New York Times,\nI see a job, Brooklyn Jewish Hospital is looking for an NCR operator. They were on strike\nbecause they were already... the half, not the office, but the kitchen and the... I don\u2019t know,\ncleaning people, they were in the Union. And they had a strike. The office, too, because nobody\ncould, they had a black man working years on that machine, and he left because he got a better\njob under the strike. And they didn\u2019t have no one for three months. They had young girls, but\nthey left. Young people don\u2019t want to sit and work. You had to sit at the machine. So, when I\nsaw that, it was in walking distance from us, the hospital, and I had to pass by, every morning,\nmy uncle\u2019s pharmacy. So he came always earlier to open that he should see me in the morning\nwhen I go to work or when I go home, because it was in a walking distance. And I never thought\nthat I stay there. And the comptroller wasn\u2019t... was out of town or I don\u2019t know where. He\nwasn\u2019t there when I got the job. So the personnel, she gave me the job. And I was working, it\nwas a big office and we had two machines like there, accounts payable and receivable. The\nreceivable was another woman working. And the comptroller came back and he called me to the\noffice and he greeted me and he was very, very nice to me. And he said, \u201cI must tell you one\nthing, if you do the job by Christmas...\u201d they were behind three months with bills. Well I saw\nthose bins with bills. \u201cIf you do it by Christmas, the job is yours.\u201d So I started to do it and I\nstarted to be very fast on the machine, very fast. And I did it day before Christmas. So, but\nwomen there, they were Jewish women, they were very jealous. One of them, first of all I never\nspoke about concentration camp. Never. It was mixed, they were non-Jews and Jews there, and\nI never spoke to them about it. And one woman, a Jewish woman, she said to me, \u201cWhy did you\ncome to America?\u201d This way. I says, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d He says, \u201cWhy, the communism is\nnot enough good?\u201d I says, \u201cMaybe it is good for you because you have a house, every child of\nyou has a car and you have a nice job. You could change place with me,\u201d I said. [Laughing]\nCan you imagine that? She was a Leftist. And she didn\u2019t work on a machine, but she worked in\nthe office. That time it was everything together, the billing. We had a big, big office and\nmachine and no machine. The machines were in the back. And then there was another woman,\nwho was like that man there, who was controlling me and she was miserable, too. If I made a\nmistake, she was miserable. And I was crying, and I went to the Comptroller and I says, \u201cI just\ndon\u2019t know what to do.\u201d She says, \u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d And I told him what\u2019s happening. He\nsays, \u201cYou come to me, you don\u2019t go to them. If you don\u2019t know something you come to me.\u201d\nIt was aman. And from then on, I was all right. I had trouble because I had to answer the\ntelephone. I was payable and the vendors were calling me. So, in the beginning I had big\ntrouble. I spoke English, but I spoke English, not Yankee. Because I learned English from an\nEnglish teacher in Czechoslovakia when it was Hungary already and we thought that we come to\nAmerica. We had private lessons. And my sister was very, very smart. And we were reading\nAnna Karenina in English and... I told you, no? That story. So we learned English. And we\ndidn\u2019t understand each other on the phone, you know? [Laughing.] So in the beginning I had\nproblems, but then it was okay. Even the Americans came to me, how do you spell that, how do\nyou spell this? You know? That was the end. But I never thought that I stay there 27 years. I\nstayed there 27 years. I went through many comptrollers. [Laughing.| He left, but he was a\nlong time there. But he left. And then one day the Personnel Director comes in, closes the door\nand he says, \u201cAttention, please.\u201d Everybody looks up, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d He says, \u201cI must announce\nit, that from yesterday on, everybody is in the Union.\u201d So I didn\u2019t know what does it mean and\nwhy is it good or bad, just in the Union. Fine. I don\u2019t care where we are. And it was an\nunbelievable advantage. I was the highest paid because of the machines. So, if somebody got\nthree dollars pay and raise, I got five dollars raise. From 60 dollars in one year, because I started\nwith 60 back there in the other place, I went up to 125 dollars because of the Union. And thank\nGod, because of the Union, I have a pension today from the Union, and I have free medication.\nMy medication bills are 4,000 dollars a year, because they are sending me the company\u2019s and\nthat\u2019s another pension, 4,000 dollars. And I am getting pension. And because... oh, that\u2019s the\nstory. Before I... a year before I left, it was another strike. And I didn\u2019t go to work, because I\nwas afraid. You know? Crossing the picket lines. But I never picketed, never. I was in the\ncountry for a month, it was a month strike. And I was in touch with them. I called always\nPersonnel. Personnel was begging me, \u201cPlease come back.\u201d Because by that time we had only\none machine, it was no more receivable because they gave it out to computers. So, I was the\nonly machine and the only person who knew the machine. They were typing checks, the people\nwho were non-Union. And it was horrible, horrible, they were behind, and terrible. And he was\nbegging me, \u201cPlease come back. Come back, don\u2019t worry, nobody is picketing anymore.\u201d And\nthey were in the country and one day he calls me and he says, \u201cCome back. We are going to\nsend you a Black girl down for you if you are afraid. We are watching you when you when you\nare coming. And please come back.\u201d And they went to the country and they dropped me off and\nthey are watching it whether I go in. It was no picketing. It was no picket line anymore. And I\nwent in and then everybody was shocked, because nobody knew that I am not in the Union. I\ncouldn\u2019t have, I couldn\u2019t, I don\u2019t know. It was... they just didn\u2019t believe it that I am, you know,\nin the Union, in the Union, the people. Because that was a job what was a confidential job, with\nthe payroll and everything. So they didn\u2019t believe it that I am in the Union. So, what happened,\nthe person...\nEnd of Tape 5, Side A\nTape 5, Side B",
        "A: ... you get out from the Union. They didn\u2019t know that I am close to retirement. That I wanted to\nretire. I didn\u2019t know either. If you get out from a union and you get the hospital pension and\nyou get medication from the hospital, doctors from the hospital and they give you 25,000 a year.\nI said, \u201cHow do I do that?\u201d He says, \u201cI\u2019m going to send a telegram,\u201d because the Union was\nthreatening us, that if we are still on strike they are not going to cover us medically. Because\nthey had very good medical coverage. Every doctor wanted you if you were in the Union. I\nsays, \u201cI cannot live without medical coverage.\u201d She says, \u201cOkay so I\u2019m going to tell them that\nyou cannot be without coverage and you are out from the Union.\u201d So, for one year, I went out\nfrom the Union. Then after a year, I wanted to retire. I worked one year more than 65, 66 I was\nwhen I left. And I says, \u201cCan you put me back to the Union?\u201d Because they would have to give\nme a pension from the hospital if I am not in the Union. So the personnel, the secretary, his\nsecretary, arranged it that they paid me for one year dues, for one year everything, because they\npaid for medical for us, the Union. And they paid for pension. I paid the bills, hundreds of\nthousands of dollars to the Union. I was paying them. And they said that it was a mistake and\nthey got me back to the Union. Can you imagine? It was such a luck because I wouldn\u2019t have\nthe Union. I wouldn\u2019t have the pension because they say to me... I\u2019m talking to some people\nfrom the hospital, \u201cIt\u2019s terrible, it\u2019s almost bankrupt.\u201d We were bankrupt after ten years, we\nwent to Chapter 11. I went to, through with them, voided thousands and thousands of checks and\neverything after ten years. And they had to merge with another hospital. It was St. Joseph... St.\nJohn\u2019s. Here is St. Joseph\u2019s. St. John\u2019s Hospital. And then we got more, we were the main\nhospital. We got more employees. It was 3,000 people. And we paid everything. We paid they\nbills, too, for medication, for the pharmacy tech, everything. It was everything through us. So it\nwas a very big job. But I had a separate room because the machine was very noisy. And I was\nalone in the room, so that was very good. And they always wanted me to be a manager and I\ndidn\u2019t want to because I knew that I am out of the Union if I am a manager. I says, \u201cI do the job.\nI am not a manager.\u201d So, I was lucky.",
        "Q: Let me ask you a couple of questions before we go on because we skipped your journey to the\nUnited States.",
        "A: My journey to the United States? We came in 1958. The International Rescue Committee from\nSalzburg brought us... Oh. That was a very terrible thing, too. They send us for x-rays, chest x-\nrays before you come. And they didn\u2019t want me let through. I\u2019m sorry, stomach. They didn\u2019t\nlet me go through because they said that I have something on my lungs. It turned out that I had\npneumonia in the camp and I didn\u2019t know about it and it showed. And they said, \u201cThey can go,\nyour husband and your son, but you have to go on another plane, because it\u2019s something.\u201d I\nwent crazy. They didn\u2019t want to go without me, but luckily they called me for a second x-ray\nand that was all well. That was okay, so we came together. But we came on a military plane. I\ndon\u2019t know how many hundreds of people, and so uncomfortable, and we were sitting in the last\nrow, near the toilet. And they were only two seats, so we always changed. One sits with George\nand then the other one was sitting alone, you know? But we were sitting in the same row, but\nbetween us the aisle. Very uncomfortable, very. I think we were 24 hours in the air. It was just\nterrible. And we stopped at Newfoundland, Newfoundland. And then they give us there the first\nmeal, a dinner. And from that I got so sick, that the whole journey to New York, it was just\nunbelievable. I was so sick. But I was pregnant and I didn\u2019t know, maybe that\u2019s why I was sick\nfrom the food. So when we arrived, it was that time Kennedy Airport... no, La Guardia, \u2019m\nsorry. La Guardia, not Kennedy Airport. And we saw my uncle and my aunt up there waiting\nfor us and waving. And we saw the first Black man in our lives. They had a postman, who\ndelivered the mail and he had a car. And my uncle, he came always... he had like here in\npharmacies they have a counter where you have food, too. It was so strange to me, because there\nis no such a thing in Europe in pharmacies. Pharmacy is pharmacy. And he was telling him that\nif he has a free day, that he is going to pay him take him to the airport and wait for us. So he was\na fat man and it was the first time in my life that I saw a black man. And he was taking us home\nto my uncle. They lived not very far from the pharmacy. Though the house was theirs, the\npharmacy was one day apartments. They lived in a separate apartment. And he had a partner\nbecause his diploma... I have still his Russian diploma, was not certificated, so he had an\nAmerican partner. Very nice people. They lived in the house, in the upstairs in the house. They\nwere very good friends. They didn\u2019t have children, and they didn\u2019t have children. They were\nvery good friends. He was a very nice man. And so we were three days in our uncle\u2019s house. It\nwas only, what they had, the living room is a big, big. Bedroom they had, and a living room, a\nkitchen. It was a private, private house. I don\u2019t know, bathroom, nothing else. They had two in\nthe house, two apartments in the house, the landlord and them. And they rented for us, in that\nkind of a house, but in another street, an apartment, upstairs. But it was small. It was just a\nbedroom and a little living room and at the end of the living room was the kitchen, a small\nkitchen with a small frigidaire. So, that was our first apartment. And that was our street where\nGeorge went to middle school.",
        "Q: What were your first impressions of the United States, and what did you expect?",
        "A: I was very upset when they showed us pictures from New York at the Embassy. I says, \u201cMy\nGod, stones and stones and stones. It\u2019s no green nowhere.\u201d They showed us New York in the\nembassy. It was very frightening. When I went very, very first time to Manhattan, I couldn\u2019t\nbelieve it. I couldn\u2019t look up because I was dizzy from the tall houses, but I loved it. I love New\nYork and that\u2019s the place where I lived most of my life. When I added up one day where I lived\nthe longest, 1t was New York. And I love New York. I loved it. We lived in Brooklyn, near the\nocean. I love the ocean. I love the ocean in the Spring and in the Fall. I don\u2019t like to go in\nbecause the mob was there, it\u2019s unbelievable. But to walk on the Boardwalk, the sundown, the\nsunset, it was so relaxing. It was wonderful. And they were benches, you know, and we were\nsitting on it. It was unbelievable, and I missed it here very, very much when I came here. When\nI came here I knew Lexington, because he\u2019s here for \u201879, 1979. And three times a year I was\nhere. I had four weeks vacation, three weeks here and one week in the country house, that\ncountry house in the Catskills. My husband loved it because he loved the country. He loved it.\nHe loved it here. When he saw the horses, and we wanted to retire here. We came here and\nalways looking for places where... we wanted a duplex. We always thought it\u2019s enough, we are\ntogether and separate. But for them it was never enough, the duplex. For us it would be, they\nare small apartments. But anyway it didn\u2019t come to it, because he died. But he wanted to live\nhere. I loved the big cities. I never lived in a small town, because where we lived in\nCzechoslovakia, that was the capital of that part. And Budapest is beautiful. So I couldn\u2019t\nimagine to live... and they was always questioning where is the city here? Where is the city?\n[Laughing |",
        "Q: You mean in Lexington?",
        "A: Here, yeah, but you go to... then they showed me downtown. I says, \u201cOh my God.\u201d [Laughing. ]\nOkay. But I knew where I\u2019m coming. But still when I came here really, that this is now real, I\nthought I go to the nuthouse.",
        "Q: When you came to Lexington?",
        "A: When I moved here. When I moved here in November of \u201886. And I was very upset. I was\nhomesick. So the first year, they went every year back to the summer house. Every year they\nspent there and I went with them. It\u2019s half of mine, from the summer house. My husband\nbought it for me and them, half. But we paid their half with cash because they didn\u2019t have\nmoney at that time, they just started teaching and they gave us the credit. So we paid they half\ncash and they paid the other half out in ten years. And it\u2019s in the Catskills. It\u2019s a beautiful place.\nIt\u2019s a small house, but it was very nice. We have two bedrooms and in between us was the\nbathroom and the living room and upstairs it was a big, big attic and it was made up for a\nbedroom, but we didn\u2019t need it. Because we were four only. They didn\u2019t have even children at\nthat time, \u201873. And even in the winter we went up. It was beautiful. It was very close to all the\nskiing place, all the people. It\u2019s very nice. And he wouldn\u2019t sell it, because he\u2019s very\nsentimental, because Daddy loved it. He would never sell it, and he loves it because he is away\nfrom here and he is going up four or five, it\u2019s three acres, hill. And underneath there is a big, big\nlibrary, that\u2019s our neighbor. It\u2019s a library for four, five towns, five little towns. A big library.\nAnd...",
        "Q: Let me ask you something before we go on. You described how when you arrived in New York\nand there were some people who, some even Jewish people who were not very respectful of you.\nDid you find that to be common? That American Jews did not treat you respectfully because you\nwere a refugee and because you were a survivor?",
        "A: Yes, correct.",
        "Q: Can you say more about that?",
        "A: Especially here, here never were refugees in Lexington. Not Jewish, or Jewish or not Jewish.\nThey never were refugees here in Lexington. And then up to today, I must tell you. You are\nfriends with the people in the synagogue. They are not real friends. You are friends in the\nsynagogue. There we socialize, but they wouldn\u2019t invite you to their houses, even here. Yes.\nAnd what I found out, I found out that almost everybody\u2019s fathers came from Europe. Those\npeople who are here 30 years or whatever... everybody\u2019s, but still they are Lexingtonians. And\nit\u2019s very interesting. I don\u2019t care, because just now I have only two friends, a lawyer and his\nwife, and from Winchester, Sylvia. But she is again from the synagogue, because I don\u2019t go to\nWinchester. And I went when her husband died, I went to see her a few times, but otherwise I\u2019m\nnot driving outside of Lexington. I\u2019m glad I find my way here. And so, she calls when they\nknow that I\u2019m sick. But I really don\u2019t have friends here. And another couple, who is a Polish\ncouple, the Habers. You\u2019ve were there? No.",
        "Q: I\u2019ve spoken with them.",
        "A: But they are very nice. Last week she made a party, it was her birthday. And I couldn\u2019t make it,\nI was so sick. Because in the beginning we made, we went to each other\u2019s houses and we had a\nbook club. Everybody read the same book and we discussed it, book discussion club. That\nwoman died. That was a pharmacologist\u2019s wife. And since she died, I am not going. I am not\ngoing. I could. It\u2019s the Haddassah. You know what\u2019s the Haddassah? They have it, but I don\u2019t\nlike those people because they... I don\u2019t like them because they went away from the synagogue\nand they have their own congregation, the Havarah. And I cannot see that. And in the\nbeginning, when George moved here, they were so friendly to him. They wanted to get him\nthere. And he would never go. Because they have here a rabbi, who was blind. He was a very\nnice man. He died from diabetes, fairly young. And he... I don\u2019t like those people, because\nwhen they found out that George doesn\u2019t want to belong there, it was finished with the\nfriendship. You know? But when they come sometimes to the synagogue or whatever, they are\nnice to you. You know? But they have their own clique, only Havarah, but they are none of\nthem from Lexington. They are everybody from somewheres else. And they feel that they are\ntogether and they help each other. And it\u2019s a bigger, there are 80 families now there. They are\nalways bigger and bigger. They don\u2019t have a place where to pray. They pray, I think, once a\nmonth or twice a month, I don\u2019t know and always someplace else. In the Christian church\nbasement or someplace. They don\u2019t have a steady place. Sometimes they pray here, too. Pray\nhere in the club. But I really don\u2019t have no friends. Besides the three people and the librarian\nfrom the synagogue, she\u2019s very nice. But we don\u2019t go to each other\u2019s houses.",
        "Q: So, you think that people are prejudiced?",
        "A: Yes, they are, they are, definitely they are. They are very nice to you in the synagogue, you\nknow. But nobody would say, \u201cCome.\u201d And the rabbi was different. We were always over. I\nwas always invited, because they used to go too, and I didn\u2019t want to go with them, like for\nPassover, to Indiana. His best friend is there, from New York, best friend. And I didn\u2019t want to\ngo, so I was always invited to Rabbi. Sometimes with Ilona when she was here for Passover, but\nnot to other people\u2019s. So itis. They are. I think they are. It\u2019s unbelievable. In the beginning\nwe had here big parties, because they came here, like guest speakers and they wanted to take\nthem to homes. I don\u2019t know why they choosed us about two or three times and they met here.\nAnd we contributed. We made the cookies and cakes and everything. And one couple came, he\nis very wealthy. And he\u2019s a nice guy. He\u2019s nice to me, very nice, in the synagogue, but they\ncame and they looked around. And I see that they are looking around themselves, you know?\nThey were away from the other people. And I said, \u201cDo you want to see the house?\u201d And she\nsays, \u201cOh, you are acting like it would be your house,\u201d she said, he said. I says, \u201cYes, my\nmoney\u2019s in that house.\u201d They thought that it\u2019s... because it\u2019s on their name. Me idiot.\n[Laughing] My friend, I have a pediatrician friend, a woman. She doesn\u2019t know up to today,\nthat it\u2019s . She said to me, \u201cDon\u2019t you dare to do it, that it\u2019s not only your name and\nGeorge\u2019s. You made the money for it.\u201d That I put it on their name. I trusted them.",
        "Q: Tell me something else, have you...",
        "A: And that\u2019s what I think, you know? That\u2019s how they are. That\u2019s the first and last time they were\nhere, because it was a party for somebody. And on the rabbi\u2019s wife\u2019s birthday, not this rabbi.\nAnother. We had a rabbi who 1s from England. Rabbi Smith (ph), he\u2019s still here. He works for\nthe State Department now. Because they... he was three years rabbi. He couldn\u2019t handle\nchildren. He doesn\u2019t have children. And he is so smart that he is too smart for them. Very, very\nsmart man. So...",
        "Q: Coming back to when you first arrived in America and you\u2019re getting settled, did you consider\nyourself...what did it take to become an American for you?",
        "A: No, no, no, no. I right away, when we were, right away, five years later, we were citizens,\nbecause you have to be five years. No, I felt at home. I felt at home, and we had our friends.\nWe had our friends. We had a lot of friends. We had friends, Hungarian friends, of course, they\nwere Hungarians. Some of them came here from, from Australia and then we met here. And\nthen we an association, Budapest. Every city had an association and we got once a month\ntogether in Manhattan. They had five o\u2019clock teas. And of course, the end was always the\nHolocaust, talking about the Holocaust, because almost all of them were in Holocaust, you know,\nthere. So, I felt very well. I felt... yeah. The last six months when I left, when I was alone\nthere, my husband died, I was there four more years alone and then they... ... \u201cGeorge,\nwhen are you coming?\u201d I met a woman, who was my age exactly and he worked... I told you\nthat too? He worked, she worked in Manhattan in the jewelry section. She was an American.\nAnd she didn\u2019t live very far from us. And I went every week, I went to the theater. I said it? I\ntold that story? But we had private buses and they went certain hours, because I didn\u2019t want to\ngo by train. And I didn\u2019t drive to Manhattan. She was going to the same beauty parlor as me\nand she was sitting near me. And one day I hear that she\u2019s talking about it that she was in Alaska\nand whatever, but still I didn\u2019t talk to her. Maybe I am not friendly. I am not talking to people\nwhom I don\u2019t know, but I overheard everything. But she noticed... yeah, I go to the bus and I\nam waiting on the bus. And she lived in that street where the bus stop was and she went to\nManhattan, too. And she said to me, \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d It\u2019s first time she spoke to me. I\nsaid, \u201cI am going to the theater.\u201d She says, \u201cAlone?\u201d I says, \u201cYes, my husband died and I\u2019m\ngoing alone.\u201d She said, \u201cMy God, would you get me a ticket, too? For next performance?\u201d I\nsays, \u201cWhy not?\u201d She said, \u201cBecause I am alone, too. My husband died.\u201d And I said, \u201cWhere\ndo I leave the ticket?\u201d She said, leave it with my beautician when you go the beauty parlor. And\nI left the ticket, and from then on we became good friends. And every week we went together,\nbut not by bus. I was driving. I know how to drive, but she didn\u2019t have a car. She knew where\nto go, but I knew how. And we went by car. And there was the parking under the theater and it\npaid. Because it was $3.50 a trip, you know, it\u2019s seven dollars, fourteen from ten dollars,\nparking under the theater. And after that we went always to Marriott Hotel, up, they had a\nwonderful, wonderful, like Viennese Bakery, a garden restaurant, where they had coffee and\ncake. After that we went up, and we were very good friends, but it was only six months because\nsix months later I came. And her son was a manager of the Days Inn Hotel in Manhattan. And\nwhen we went, first time when we went to the country, first year, and I was very, very homesick\nfor New York and I was depressed and I was crying in the country. And George said, \u201cDo you\nwant to go to the city?\u201d I says \u201cYes.\u201d So, I called her up and her son gave us a suite for 25\ndollars and we stayed there for three days. And he went to the museum right away. And I went,\nI think, with Laura to Fifth Avenue. I don\u2019t know. And I think that Ilona went with him, yes, to\nthe museum. And we stayed there three days. And then again, one time I went only with Ilona.\nI stayed there a week. And I included her always, the woman for the theater, and they gave us a\ndinner there, for the... I remember before we left and she was there too, you know, in the hotel.\nAnd we had a very good time, but it was only for six months. I met her late. I mean I saw her,\nbut I didn\u2019t know who she was and because I was there four years alone. And she was alone four\nyears, too. And she was retiring, too, the same time. She worked 20, 27 years, too. Can you\nimagine that? So it was late.",
        "Q: Tell me something else, you mentioned early on that soon after you arrived you saw your first\nblack man. And that was near the time, just around the time when the Civil Rights movement\nwas starting. But tell me, were you surprised about the way that blacks were treated in this\ncountry?",
        "A: In New York weren\u2019t treated bad, but here, when he came here, the blacks were sitting in the\nback of the bus. That I couldn\u2019t imagine. It was no sales ladies black, no one. I didn\u2019t see no\none black, they were all separate. It was unbelievable. And what was the most unbelievable\nthing, everybody wore sneakers. In the subways, too. And we said, \u201cThey don\u2019t have shoes\nhere? Everybody\u2019s wearing sneakers.\u201d We couldn\u2019t understand that. Everybody in the\nmorning. And then we saw people who went to bigger offices to work. They had they shoes in\nthey bags, because if you have to wait for a bus and, many times I was waiting with high heels\nand I said, \u201cMy God, I wish I would wear sneakers,\u201d you know? When I went to the city I was\nwearing always high heels. Because in the office I was wearing always high heels. And that was\nthe custom. We couldn\u2019t understand. That was the most unbelievable thing when we went on\nthe subway that everybody is in white sneakers. We didn\u2019t know about the segregation. We\ndidn\u2019t know in Hungary about it. We didn\u2019t, we didn\u2019t have blacks. We didn\u2019t. Oh, I\u2019m sorry.\nI saw the first black man in the English Army. I saw a soldier. And it wasn\u2019t even... I don\u2019t\nknow whether he was in the English army. It\u2019s interesting, they were taking us by jeep to\nNuremberg from Bergen-Belsen. And another jeep came and they were throwing to us from\ntheir jeep, oranges. And it was a black soldier. That was the first one. Not the first one. Yes,\nthat was the first one. But I just didn\u2019t notice it, color, color... it was no difference to me.",
        "Q: I just wondered if, because you had come from a situation where the discrimination was, was,\nhad such an effect. Whether you expected something different in this country?",
        "A: I didn\u2019t know what to expect here. I knew just I have an uncle here. I didn\u2019t know what to\nexpect. I didn\u2019t. The very, very bad experience was the very, very first time when we had a\nbigger apartment and George with the school was supposed to go to the Shakespearean play with\nthe school to Connecticut. And he comes home and he had a friend, who was a very tough guy.\nHe was Hungarian. And he was with him, probably, I don\u2019t know. And a black boy started to\nhit George. And he hit him in his mouth. He lost a tooth and he was bleeding and he couldn\u2019t go\nto the show. That was the very, very first time when I said, \u201cOh my God, what 1s going on\nhere?\u201d In Brooklyn. It was on the corner where we lived. So then I said, \u201cOh my God.\u201d You\nknow? I didn\u2019t know nothing about it. It was a very strange thing.",
        "Q: Did you understand the reason why it had happened?",
        "A: I think that they wanted the other boy, because he was a very tough guy. He was wearing always\nboots and he had a knife in his boot. So, he was his bodyguard. [Laughing.] After that when it\nhappened, he was always with him. Because I didn\u2019t know why it happened, because he is\nwhite. I didn\u2019t know. But then I knew, you know, when it happened then I knew that maybe...\nbut maybe they knew the other guy and they wanted him and they... he was weak. I don\u2019t know.\nI don\u2019t know, but I felt terrible. I felt terrible.",
        "Q: Did you feel a little bit, was it, did you feel a little bit of prejudice after that?",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t. I tell you why, because I worked with blacks in the hospital. My best friends were\nblacks, who are still calling me. But not New Yorkers. They were from Barbados, from Jamaica\nand they are different. They are entirely different. New York blacks are no good. They are no\ngood. They are. They are no good. But those people, I don\u2019t know whether they are more\neducated or why, but they were entirely different. And we had... oh, that story is interesting,\ntoo. We had New Yorkers, too, there and they hated each other. The Jamaicans and the\nBarbadians, they hated the New York blacks in the office. In the big accounting office. So it\nwas a big hatred between them. And oh gosh, one had two daughters and one daughter married a\nNew Yorker. She is divorced. She divorced him. But they were very against him. They feel\nthat they are more. They are. They are more educated. And one of them was going to school in\nEngland and her husband was an engineer. And unfortunately they are different. I didn\u2019t come\nacross a New Yorker black who was so nice as those. You know what I mean? I\u2019m not talking\nabout Harlem. I don\u2019t know. But what was around me, that was my opinion and that\u2019s how I\nfelt, that they were different.\nEnd of Tape 5, Side B\nTape 6, Side A",
        "Q: This is tape number six, side A of an interview with Emilie Szekely. When did you start\nspeaking about your Holocaust experiences?",
        "A: In 1986, when I came here, and I went to the beauty parlor and I had a short sleeve shirt on and\nthe beautician said, \u201cWhat is that?\u201d I said, \u201cThis is the Holocaust.\u201d \u201cThe Holocaust? My\ndaughter was just taught in Tates Creek High that she shouldn\u2019t believe it. That they shouldn\u2019t\nbelieve it, it was a Holocaust. It was made up by the Jews.\u201d I thought I faint. I says, \u201cWhat?\u201d\nShe says, \u201cYes, she was just taught. And I very surprised to see you. I never saw a survivor.\u201d\nThen a woman came here\u2014I came here the first time alone when we didn\u2019t move in yet and they\nhad blinds made in the family room\u2014and she was from McAlpins. And I\u2019m sitting in the chair\nand she sits near me, this way, and she noticed the number. And she jumps up and she starts to\nscream. I says, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d She says, \u201cI never saw somebody, I never saw nobody, who\ncame back from there. Let me have a, let me, can I make a prayer for you?\u201d And she kneels\ndown and she starts to pray like I would come, you know, from somewhere, an alien. It was\nunbelievable experience. But after that when it happened, that she said they were teaching it.\nShe was teaching in Nicholasville, Laura, at that time. And I told her, I says, \u201cWhere did you\nbring me? That\u2019s what they teach here? I never heard it in my life.\u201d And she was very upset,\nand she spoke to the high school teacher there and she said, \u201cHow about if she would come to\nschool?\u201d I says, \u201cI cannot talk. I never spoke in my life.\u201d She says, \u201cHow about if I come to\nyour house?\u201d She said. So she came, and I spoke to the microphone for two hours. And from\nthat moment on, she [phone rings] ...She came from the high school. I spoke two hours in the\nmicrophone. And it was no stop. They came to the house and they were begging me to come to\nspeak in the high school there. And it was a pretty bad experience, the very first one. That was\nthe first ttme when I spoke.",
        "Q: What was the high school where you spoke? Which one?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know whether, yeah, they have more. I spoke at other high schools, too. It was a regular\nhigh school, but I spoke at the high school there, when there were women who were pregnant\nand they were going to school. That was another high school, but that was regular high school.\nI don\u2019t know what was the name, in Nicholasville, Jessamine County. And they were, it was a\nman teacher, who was very, very nice. He was a history teacher. But it was a... they sat like\naround the wall in circle they put the chairs. And on that side, on the left side, 1t was a circle\nwith about ten boys, who were shaved, their heads and they didn\u2019t look at me. Because at that\ntime I was beginner speaker and I started to speak and I asked them who believes in the\nHolocaust, that the Holocaust is true, they should put their hands up. They didn\u2019t. And the\nwhole time I was talking and they didn\u2019t look at me. So when I finished, and I was pretty\nnervous, that was my first speech. But it was good because the teacher was absolutely\nwonderful. And he was embracing me and \u201cThank God for you, that you are here,\u201d and that kind\nof a thing. And I says, \u201cAnd do you know whom you have here?\u201d He says, \u201cUnfortunately,\nyes.\u201d So, that was a bad experience for me, you know, that there are skinheads there. It was in\nNicholasville. But then I spoke many, many times in Nicholasville middle school, and when\nLaura was teaching, that was middle school. And that high school. I don\u2019t know what was the\nname of that high school. They were all girls, women, I mean, and one of them came to me.\nThey came after me and she said that, \u201cI thank you very much for coming because my father is\nGerman and he is telling an entirely different story and I knew that it\u2019s something wrong how he\nis telling it to us.\u201d So I had that kind of an experiences. Then it was non-stop, one school after\nthe other. Then it was in Paris, Kentucky. In Paris, Kentucky it was a professor in education.\nThat was George\u2019s department, education, I mean he was in Art and Education, two\nappointments. A very nice, very nice professor. And he had student teachers in Paris, Kentucky,\nand he took me to Paris, Kentucky. And some, they took videos there that day, but it was a very\nbig wind and the windows were open. They didn\u2019t have air conditioners. And the videos didn\u2019t\ncame out. Well, so he took me the second time and he took with him a professional videotaper\nfrom U.K. And I didn\u2019t know nothing, who else is there, but I saw that they are women there\nand they are taking pictures, too, from me. And they are writing. I had no idea that the paper is\nthere. He called The Herald. And that was the first time when I was in The Herald-Leader. And\nwhen I was in The Herald Leader, it was no stop. People were calling me. Schools were calling\nme, and I can tell you that I spoke in every school in Lexington, not once, because I spoke 160\ntimes already. Because usually I, they put together six, seven, eight grades usually in the\nauditort1um. And if the next bunch of kids comes, they call me back again. And in every high\nschool I spoke, too. In every high school. I spoke twice in Dunbar. In... what is that station?\nBryan Station, Bryan Station, they were very nice there. I spoke in Lafayette. Now I have to go\nagain. Because I spoke when Ilona was there and still the teacher is there and now Anna has the\nteacher. And she, he was asking whether your grandmother still does it. And Henry Clay, I\nspoke at Henry Clay. Twice I spoke already at the Community College. Three times at U.K. I\nspoke in the nurse\u2019s department, Psychiatric Nurses\u2019 department. And then the other was the\nMiddle Eastern studies, both of them twice. And...",
        "Q: Have people been receptive mostly?",
        "A: Very nice. Very, very nice. Very nice. Very, very nice. I cannot tell you, I have a whole\ndrawer, from letters, what they are doing, Montessori school. All the Montessori schools I\nspoke. There are three of them here. I spoke in Scapa, I don\u2019t know how many times. And what\nthey do, the Scapa... oh, I spoke, lately I spoke in the Adult Education at night. That\u2019s education\nat U.K. I have a series for the concerts, five tickets for the U.K... not U.K., concerts what they\nare doing, gosh, five a year. Five concerts, from all over the world they are coming. And the\nteacher, the professor that sits in front of me, she is a woman, but is George\u2019s colleague actually.\nSo, she never... I don\u2019t know, she was always afraid to ask me and we always talk to her. And a\nfew weeks ago, it was a concert and she turns around and she says, \u201cAre you alright?\u201d And I\nsays, \u201cYes, why?\u201d I wasn\u2019t all right the week before and George was there with Ana. And she\nsays, \u201cOh, can I ask you to talk?\u201d I says, \u201cOf course.\u201d And one of her students, they are all for\nMasters, teachers who are going for Masters. And one of her students is from Scapa. And she\u2019s\nher best friend. And that woman, she is a pastor\u2019s wife from the Lutheran church, Mrs. Gross.\nWonderful, wonderful person. I don\u2019t know how many times I spoke. And what she is doing,\nshe binds the books what the children are writing. The letters, and it\u2019s unbelievable what they\nare doing. And flowers they are giving me. And that professor, Dr. Backner, I don\u2019t know how\nmany times he took me. He was, unfortunately he didn\u2019t get tenure at U.K. because he wasn\u2019t\nwriting. But he said he didn\u2019t want the tenure. He was there six years. And then he was\nprincipal in Georgetown. And he called me there, too. I spoke in Georgetown for him, and he\npicks me up, and he takes me home, and in-between he takes me to a restaurant when he takes\nme home, to the nicest restaurants to eat. And it was an opening here in Lexington, what\u2019s it,\nLexington Traditional. It\u2019s on Nicholasville Road. And I asked him when he was in... because I\nspoke there two or three times and I knew it was an opening there for principal. And I ask him in\nGeorgetown whether he wants to come to Lexington. He lives here. And he says, \u201cWhy?\u201d I\nsays, \u201cBecause I know it\u2019s, I don\u2019t know the principal who is there, just in between.\u201d He lives,\nshe was, he was Laura\u2019s principal in Jesse Clark. He lives in our corner. And I said, \u201cIs Mr.\nMossgrave there?\u201d And he says, \u201cOh, not a bad idea.\u201d And then I spoke to Mossgrave. I says,\n\u201cWould you please call him because you are here only for a few months.\u201d [Laughing] Because\nhe is retired, and he works a few months only because of the Social Security probably. And he\ngot the job. He got the job. So I already spoke twice to him here, in . And last time his\nwife picked me up, and we met in the restaurant, Chaise (ph). And he came there from school\nand his daughter came, too. It\u2019s very interesting. His daughter was for a whole year in Belarus.\nVery interesting. She said, she loves the people there and she wants to learn the language. Very\nnice person. And both of them came to listen to me, too. The wife and the daughter, last time\nthat I spoke. It was the end of the year.",
        "Q: When you started speaking about your experiences, did you find that memories were coming up\nthat you hadn\u2019t thought of?",
        "A: Everything is coming up. I don\u2019t... if they give me enough time, I am telling them from\nbeginning to the end, everything. Memories are always with me, not coming up, they are always\nwith me. And I don\u2019t try to forget it. Sylvia tries to forget it. That\u2019s the difference between me\nand Sylvia. And it\u2019s a big difference, because she married an American man and she never had\nto talk about it. So it\u2019s a big difference. But she doesn\u2019t want to talk about it with me either.\nAnd she was in the same place. She was in Bergen-Belsen. And she doesn\u2019t want, she says what\nshe has left over, life, she wants to make it happy. I cannot forget it. I cannot erase it that they\nkilled my parents. I can\u2019t. And the six million people and everybody and big, big family from\nmy grandmother\u2019s side. I can\u2019t. I can\u2019t forget it, no one day. And I am dreaming about it,\nespecially when I\u2019m talking, I\u2019m dreaming. I said once to my heart doctor, I says, \u201cI just don\u2019t\nknow, I cannot sleep. Maybe I shouldn\u2019t talk anymore.\u201d He said, \u201cYou just take your pill and\ntalk.\u201d [Laughing] That\u2019s what he said. They are so funny the doctors. They have my pictures,\nwhen I am in the newspaper, they put it in they files. So, when they bring the files, here you are.\nIt\u2019s interesting. Yeah, lot of them.",
        "Q: You talked earlier, I guess it was the last time, about how you had such guilt feelings after your\nparents and your sister were killed. And I wondered if you ever got over guilt feelings? If you\never got over that?",
        "A: I, look, I have a guilt feeling always about my sister, yes. How 1s it that she said... it\u2019s fate. I\ndon\u2019t know. I have to come... I have to forget that guilt feeling, because I wasn\u2019t there. I wasn\u2019t\nthere. And I am sure that if I would be there, I would do the same thing. Because she had an\nopportunity to escape and she says, \u201cI go where my mother goes.\u201d And if I would be there, I\nwould do the same thing. I wasn\u2019t there. It was a coincidence. I had problem with my\nrheumatic fever that year and I had to go... my mother send me first. Every summer we spent\nthere in Budapest at my grandmother\u2019s house. And I took every year a cure for my rheumatic\nfever. When it was nothing wrong with me. The doctor said we should do it that it shouldn\u2019t\ncome back. And I had a doctor there, in one of those baths that they have. It\u2019s wonderful waters\nthey have. And he gave me a cure for three weeks. And it wasn\u2019t my fault that I wasn\u2019t there. I\nwas thinking about it many times. That I should make, I shouldn\u2019t be so guilty because it wasn\u2019t\nmy fault. First time in my life, I was 21, and first time in my life I was traveling alone. It was\n400 miles on the train to my grandmother. Because I finished school and my sister was still in\nschool, otherwise we would go together. The year before, Christmas, we went together with my\nsister. So it wasn\u2019t my fault. It was fate. It was fate. And when I was telling it in some schools\nand I says... children were asking me, how come that you survive? I says, \u201cThat\u2019s the only\nquestion I cannot answer you.\u201d And the principal, not principal, the Superintendent, I didn\u2019t\nknow that he was there. He said... he was sitting in the corner. \u201cI tell you why,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\nshe should spread it to the people.\u201d I says, \u201cThank you very much for helping me out, but I think\nmy sister could have spread it, too. So, it is nice that you think about it this way.\u201d",
        "Q: Do you feel safe and at home in this country, and in Lexington?",
        "A: I\u2019m every year alone in this house, now I don\u2019t go with them in the country. And this year I am\nthinking about it. That they really shouldn\u2019t do it, that they leave me alone here. I went with\nthem every year, but I don\u2019t know how many years now, about four years, I don\u2019t go because\nLaura wants to be alone with George. And he says we are here together the whole year, we are\ntogether. Though it\u2019s my house, I cannot go there. So, I went there three years ago. She went to\nHungary with Ana, because she was never in Hungary, Ana. She was never in Hungary. Ilona\nwas with me. I took Ilona. \u201989, after her, that was my Bat Mitzvah present to her in \u201889. I took\nher to Hungary for three weeks and one week in Vienna we were. And so, she went with Ana. I\ngave Ana her Bat Mitzvah present, the ticket, to go to Hungary. So Laura had a free ticket that\nshe\u2019s collecting, you know, the free flights. So they went to Hungary. And then I went for three\nweeks to the country and stayed with George. I had a great time. I had a great time. What\nshould I tell you. So, that\u2019s the situation. I won\u2019t go there now, sick as Iam. See we have\nalways only one car there, and I am depending on them. And it\u2019s not comfortable anymore. I\ntook now, when the children are there, upstairs the bedroom, because it\u2019s a... they made a\nwindow, you know, the skylight there. And they have air conditioner up there. I cannot go steps\nup again, and up and down. And they made a half bathroom there, I made. I had to pay half for\nit, the time that I am up there. And that\u2019s only half bathroom. If I want to take a bath, I have to\ngo downstairs. It\u2019s no more comfortable for me. It came to a point that it\u2019s no more\ncomfortable.",
        "Q: I just was wondering if you felt that America had become home to you and that you, also\nwhether you felt like...",
        "A: It was my home. New York was my home. It was my home. I never, when I went even to\nHungary, I never said I\u2019m going home. That I can erase because of what they did to us. You\nknow? I was born there. And all the relatives there. But I never, never said \u201cI am going home.\nI am going to Hungary.\u201d New York was my home. I felt at home.",
        "Q: Do you think that people in this country and in this day and age are, are paying attention enough\nto the dangers of what happened during the Holocaust and making sure that it couldn\u2019t happen\nagain?",
        "A: No, no. The people are so far away from it. Even then, when it happened, I think, they were so\nfar away from it, that it\u2019s only me that I am afraid that 1t can happen and what can happen. It\u2019s\nonly me who went through. They are laughing when I am saying it, that I am afraid from\neverything. I am afraid of my shadow, you know, that kind of a situation. But no. When we\nwent to Hungary and they were asking us, \u201cHow could you live there? This is a jungle there, in\nNew York.\u201d You know? They have a very bad opinion of what\u2019s happening in New York. It\u2019s\nhappening here, too. This is much smaller and what\u2019s happening here, when you open the\ntelevision, they start the killing. Okay, it\u2019s a family killing or whatever but it\u2019s happening. It\u2019s\nhappening here, too. And it\u2019s always worse for the people who don\u2019t live in a place. You know,\nit seems much worse. I don\u2019t know. I wasn\u2019t afraid in New York where I lived. Once I was\nvery afraid, when I sold my house and I sold it to a Chinese guy, who, they knew that they have\nto give back Hong Kong, and they were coming. And he said that he wants it for his family.\nBaloney. He made a business from it. He made from a two-family house, four families. For\nmoney, he\u2019s getting rent. Unbelievable. From the basement he made two apartments and two\napartments what we had upstairs. I went to see it when... there\u2019s no garage. From the garage he\nmade an apartment. It\u2019s unbelievable. And he wanted to get out from it, the last minute. But he\nhad 25 thousand dollar, 25 put down? How much? I don\u2019t know how many thousands he had to\nput down when we made the agreement. It was in the lawyers, collateral, you know. And he\nwanted to, if he doesn\u2019t get the mortgage what he wants, that he can get out from it, but he got\nthe mortgage what he wanted. The lawyer find out he got the mortgage what he wanted. But he\nwanted a cheaper mortgage and he wanted to get out. But then he would lose that money. I\nthink it was 25. I don\u2019t remember. Anyway. And I was getting phone calls and it was a strange,\nstrange accent, that I am going to come and kill you. So then I said, \u201cMy God, I want to get out\nas early as can from here.\u201d You know? I think they were those people, those Chinese, I don\u2019t\nknow. Then I was very afraid. Though in the beginning I was very afraid, we were robbed. So I\nslept, not in our house, we lived in an apartment and we were one apartment, second apartment,\nwe were robbed. But that\u2019s why we bought the house, we went out from that neighborhood. But\notherwise, otherwise I didn\u2019t have that fear. I didn\u2019t go on the subways, I was driving. And it\nwas very dangerous already, in the hospital, too. So it was a parking lot across the street where I\npaid parking. And I just ran to the building. It was very dangerous. I got out at the last minute\nreally, because if you walked in the hospital itself, in the lobby, and you had a necklace on or\nsomething, people from outside came and they took it off. So it was a very dangerous place.\nAnd it is very interesting that every hospital in New York, it is in a bad place now. It is very\ninteresting. Even Flowers (ph), Fifth Avenue, my God, my husband was operated, spine\noperation and I went to visit him with George. Behind it there were big buildings and we had to\nget off the subway. And they were throwing bottles against us. That was the best hospital, the\nname Flower, Fifth Avenue. Can you imagine? That was years ago. Stay in Harlem, or no. So,\nwe came here. What I was seeing today on the television show, it\u2019s really scary, about five black\nguys, who are thieves. And that show is from New York, and how they are stealing cars and\nhow they are just bumping into people\u2019s cars. And then innocent women, they get out, what\nhappened. And they get out too, behind them and they grab their necks, put them in the other car\nbehind them and they take that car because it\u2019s a better car than theirs. There were five of them.\nCan you imagine that? I don\u2019t know how they can say it on the television this way. And there\nwas a detective there, too. And they were saying it, how they are show it how they are doing it\nand they are selling it. And she said, \u201cHow much you get for that car?\u201d She says, \u201cWe sell it for\nparts, 500 dollars. And if it\u2019s a Mercedes, a nice, new one, sometimes 5,000 dollars.\u201d This is,\nthis is, now again a more dangerous life since I came. They were stealing cars, of course they\nwere stealing cars, but that way I didn\u2019t hear it, never, when I was living there. So it\u2019s now 13\nyears.",
        "Q: What about anti-Semitism?",
        "A: In New York?",
        "Q: Living in Lexington, have you experienced anti-Semitism?",
        "A: Actually no, because I am not... I think in this neighborhood, yes. I didn\u2019t experience it, but I\nhave a friend, who is married to a Chinese man. She\u2019s from Canada. And she, nobody was her\nfriend, only I. [Laughing.] But she lives here a long, long time, and her mother was Russian.\nAnd she was born in Canada. And she\u2019s telling me that this neighborhood, when she... they\nbuilded the house. They didn\u2019t allow Jews in this neighborhood. That was what she was telling\nme. And then I had a remark. Somebody came, I don\u2019t know who was it, those guys who are,\nyou know, trying to convert you. I don\u2019t know which religion was it. And I said, \u201cI am not\ninterested. I am Jewish.\u201d And he said, \u201cWhat is it, everybody is Jewish in this neighborhood?\u201d\nI says, \u201cNo, minority.\u201d They are all Baptist here, in this neighborhood. But now there are a few\nJewish families. But she said that they weren\u2019t allowed here in this neighborhood, Jews. I\ndidn\u2019t, as I said, I don\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t know about it. And she, she was unbelievable, they\ndidn\u2019t want to take her nowhere between them, because she was marrying to a Chinese. He is a\ngenius. He is now 70, I don\u2019t know, something. He got tenure. He was with IBM originally.\nAnd then he was teaching at UK. And now he is teaching in Frankfort in state university. And\nat age 70 they gave him tenure. He is such a genius. But he is Chinese. And she has two\nChinese, he has two daughters, a daughter and a son, both of them are doctors. And they were\nreally suffering in this neighborhood, she said, because they were Chinese kids. She was always\ntelling me what they went through. So, it\u2019s any difference, Chinese or Jew? If they don\u2019t, if it\u2019s\nnot their own, then they don\u2019t like you. I don\u2019t know. We are friends. With this building now.\nThose people lived before them a very long time here, 20 years. He was a pathologist and she\nwas Head of Pathology at UK. And we didn\u2019t go to each other\u2019s houses, but when we spoke we\nwere very nice. And her daughter, Jenna\u2019s daughter, when she got married in Louisville all the\nneighbors got together, five of us and we went all to the wedding, to her daughter\u2019s wedding,\nbecause she didn\u2019t have any family here. She doesn\u2019t have any family here. And because I am\nJewish and she is married to a Chinese [laughing] so we are very good friends. We are going\ntogether, she helps me enormously. She is a very good person. Now she was, she was nurse,\nactually. She went for nursing in Case Western, in Cleveland. She met him there somewhere, I\ndon\u2019t know, in Ohio. She... really, she felt it at UK. She was in the Nursing department and she\nwas the head of the private nurses at that time they had. And she had to give the patients the\nnurses. And she is absolutely, you know, she didn\u2019t know about discrimination. And she gave\nonce a black nurse to a white person. She was fired. And then when she was fired from there\nshe started to tutor. She is very good in math. And she tutored all the kids from this\nneighborhood. She knows everybody because she was a tutor. And from that, because it was not\nenough what her husband made, they send the two children to medical school. The daughter is a\npsychiatrist and she is having now the first baby, she is waiting every minute, though she is 35\nyears old. Yeah, she is. And she lives in Louisville. And the son is in Louisville, too. He is a\ngeneral practitioner, but he wanted to be a surgeon.\nEnd of Tape 6, Side A\nTape 6, Side B",
        "A: ...here that Iam accepted. I think because of the speeches, that\u2019s why. Many people know me,\nand many people want me, and many people are very grateful that I am teaching and I am\nteaching the children about history, what is not, unfortunately, not in history books. It\u2019s only a\nfew words about the Second World War, the Holocaust. And I don\u2019t know whether it ever will\nbe. And they are very grateful and gracious. And really they do everything for me. They pick\nme up, they take me home, they take me to eat. They give me presents. It\u2019s unbelievable what\nthey are doing, those people. And I think that it\u2019s sincere. Those people who, you know, who\nare calling me and I am talking... so it\u2019s many people. 150 times I talk, it\u2019s many people. They\nare sincere. And they are not anti-Semitic. They are not.

And I wanted to make clear, was it his daughter that came over\nand stayed with you? It was his daughter? Okay.",

        "Q: Okay, and we, last time we were going over mostly some questions about your childhood and\nsome things that weren\u2019t covered in the interview that the Shoah Foundation did. And what I\nwanted to do mostly today is to talk about your experiences after the war, after the war ended.\nBut one of the things that wasn\u2019t clear to me from the Shoah Foundation interview was, tell me if\nI have this right, when you were on the transports from Hungary to Auschwitz, you were with\nyour grandmother and your Aunt Ilona.",
        "Q: At one point in Auschwitz, you told in your interview with the Shoah Foundation about how you\narrived in Auschwitz and how you were there for, I think two weeks before you were given your\ntattoo and before you started working. When were you separated from Ilona?",
        "Q: No.",
        "Q: Why don\u2019t we jump forward to that time, because you described the rest of that experience in\nyour Shoah Interview. And then you, so after the war eventually you returned to Budapest and\nyou were reunited with your, with your Aunt Ilona and your husband.

        "Q: During those three years then, before you found out and after you got back did you make any\neffort to find out what had happened to them?",
        "Q: And I wanted to go back again and ask you a little bit more about the time right after the war had\nended and you returned to Hungary. You talked about how you wanted to have a family. What\nelse, what were your hopes at that point? Were you thinking about the future? Did you want to\nstay in Hungary? Did you and your husband talk...?",
        "Q: Did your husband lose his business at that time?",
        "Q: Stock?",
        "Q: You did tell that story. So your husband, what was the name of your uncle, who your husband\nworked for?",

        "Q: Did you have a sense of faith at the time?",
        "Q: After...",
        "Q: So after the war when you went to synagogue, did you just go because of tradition?",
        "Q: So, when you went, but did you go, you didn\u2019t go to synagogue because you had religious faith?",
        "Q: What was his name? The Rabbi.",
        "Q: And he was at the Orthodox, no it\u2019s ...",
        "Q: Conservative.",
        "Q: About the question where was God, did you just stop asking it or did you come up with some\nkind of answer?",
        "Q: Do you ask yourself those questions anymore?",
        "Q: Can you remember and describe the events of the 1956 Uprising?",
        "Q: From your perspective.",
        "Q: Okay. So why did we say that?",
        "Q: So, going back to the 1956 uprising... remembering the events of the uprising.",
        "Q: Did you see that happening?",
        "Q: I wanted to ask you... we\u2019ll go on to Vienna and then talk about your journey to the United\nStates. But I wanted to ask you whether you wanted to say anything about your husband and\nyour relationship with him, because last time we talked you said he was a stranger to you and\nthen all of sudden you met him after the war.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s go back, because we got off the subject, you were talking about your relationship with your\nhusband.",
        "Q: Why is that?",
        "Q: Okay, tape number five, side A of an interview with Emilie Szekely. And you told on the other\ntape about your... how you got out of Hungary. And then you went to Vienna? Can you talk\nabout what you did in Vienna?",
        "Q: Tell me something, did you talk to George about your family history, and what had happened to\nyour family during the Holocaust, and what had happened to you, from the time he was a child?",
        "Q: When you were in Vienna were you waiting for a visa?",
        "Q: Did you not tell anybody because you were afraid or...?",

        "Q: What were your first impressions of the United States, and what did you expect?",
        "Q: You mean in Lexington?",
        "Q: When you came to Lexington?",
        "Q: Let me ask you something before we go on. You described how when you arrived in New York\nand there were some people who, some even Jewish people who were not very respectful of you.\nDid you find that to be common? That American Jews did not treat you respectfully because you\nwere a refugee and because you were a survivor?",
        "Q: Can you say more about that?",
        "Q: I\u2019ve spoken with them.",
        "Q: So, you think that people are prejudiced?",
        "Q: Tell me something else, have you...",
        "Q: Coming back to when you first arrived in America and you\u2019re getting settled, did you consider\nyourself...what did it take to become an American for you?",
        "Q: Tell me something else, you mentioned early on that soon after you arrived you saw your first\nblack man. And that was near the time, just around the time when the Civil Rights movement\nwas starting. But tell me, were you surprised about the way that blacks were treated in this\ncountry?",
        "Q: I just wondered if, because you had come from a situation where the discrimination was, was,\nhad such an effect. Whether you expected something different in this country?",
        "Q: Did you understand the reason why it had happened?",
        "Q: Did you feel a little bit, was it, did you feel a little bit of prejudice after that?",
        "Q: This is tape number six, side A of an interview with Emilie Szekely. When did you start\nspeaking about your Holocaust experiences?",
        "Q: What was the high school where you spoke? Which one?",
        "Q: Have people been receptive mostly?",
        "Q: When you started speaking about your experiences, did you find that memories were coming up\nthat you hadn\u2019t thought of?",
        "Q: You talked earlier, I guess it was the last time, about how you had such guilt feelings after your\nparents and your sister were killed. And I wondered if you ever got over guilt feelings? If you\never got over that?",

        "A: The name is Klugman from Russia and there are a lot of Klugmans there. So I don\u2019t know how\nit came, where it, how, but he was born in Kiev. And his family was in Kiev until the First\nWorld War... Second World War. I\u2019m sorry. Then they had to run, because the Germans were\nthere. Whoever was left from the family. He had two sisters and a brother there. The other\nbrother was already on the front. And they had to run. So I never knew about it. A cousin who\ncame five years ago to America, the painter, he was telling me the whole story. Why and how\nthey had to run. And they went past Odessa and they lived in a small village in a house, he said,\nwhat didn\u2019t have floor. It was nothing, just dust on the floor. And they managed to escape, but\nthey had very, very hard times. His parents were alive that time, but the father and the mother,\nthey all died. Actually they say that it was from hunger they died, but I don\u2019t know actually\nwhat was the reason they died, because they had very, very hard times. And after that my\ncousin, who had his mother... no, I\u2019m sorry. The cousin, he has a sister, who is very, very sick.\nShe\u2019s here too, in Boston. And him and the sister and the husband, and she had a daughter the\nsame age as George is and a son, they settled down in Odessa. So, when the doors were opening\nhere that the Russians can come, he didn\u2019t think about it. He was just writing me, \u201cSave my\ndaughter,\u201d who lived in Moscow and had two little children. I told you that story. No?",
        "A: She had two little, beautiful daughters and her husband was Jewish. And she was a half-Jew,\nbecause her mother wasn\u2019t Jewish. And the mother was a practicing Russian Orthodox, so she, I\nthink she brainwashed her. But she\u2019s supposed to come to America, too. She was on the quota,\ntoo. In fact, they are still bothering me that, \u201cWhere is she?\u201d I says, \u201cMany times, I\u2019ve told you\nthat she won\u2019t come, never. Please cross her off because she is taking somebody\u2019s place.\u201d They\nlived with the husband\u2019s mother, whose husband died, he was injured in the war. I don\u2019t know, I\nthink he lost his leg. He went underground with the Russians. I don\u2019t know that whole story, but\nI know that they had an apartment in Moscow and the son lived with the mother. He went to\nschool in Moscow and he 1s an engineer. She, he met my cousin in school, who went for\nengineering, too. Civil engineers. They met there and he knew that she\u2019s half-Jew, but she\npromised him everything, everything what you want. If they are going to have children they are\ngoing to be brought up as Jews. And then she hated Communism, she just couldn\u2019t stand it. I\ndidn\u2019t know why, but when I found out it was too late already. Because she couldn\u2019t go to\nchurch. So they came to America. The first Hanukkah, the television came here to our house\nand took pictures from them, because they were here for the first Hanukkah. So they are here,\nthey were here for six years.

My son, by coincidence got him a job with the Gray\nConstruction Company, because she had a student, he had a student in one of the schools, who\nwas his student and then she became a teacher. And he went back with his children there. He\ngoes always, one semester he takes his class to schools and they are... Adopt a School, that\u2019s the\nname of it. And they are teaching there, but they are just students, not graduate students and he\u2019s\nobserving them before they make their lesson plans and they have to show it to him. And he\u2019s\nrunning from class to class. And one day, she came to that school and she said, \u201cDoes anybody\nknow somebody who has connections to a construction company?\u201d And that teacher, he says,\n\u201cMy fiance,\u201d one of the Grays\u2019 son. He says, \u201cMy fianc\u00e9.\u201d So, from that time on they hired\nhim, and he\u2019s a person who, he didn\u2019t mind what kind of job they gave him. He did very hard\njob. And he loves the construction. He loves to see. He was in, I don\u2019t know how many\nbuildings he builded. He was already a big shot there. When they got their visa to come to\nAmerica. And he work day and night for an apartment in Moscow. In the middle of Moscow\nthe apartment was ready and they would be separated from the mother-in-law. And they would\nhave a beautiful apartment there. And the visa was starting to expire, so my cousin said, \u201cIt 1s\nnot worth, what is thousands of thousands dollars that apartment. It doesn\u2019t worth, you have to\ngo.\u201d He was in Odessa, but he helped them. He came to Moscow and helped them to pack and\nthey came. And she was very happy. And when she got to the apartment she couldn\u2019t believe it.\nYou know, they lived in two small rooms there, so many people, four. I mean two children and\nthe couple and the grandmother. And she was very happy. One day... she sent, before she\ncame, she sent a hundred and twenty packages to my name, because she didn\u2019t know where to\nsend it and they were all Russian books. And I said, \u201c\u201cThat woman is crazy. She needs American\nbooks. Why is she sending the Russian books?\u201d But all, you know, Dostoevsky, whatever. The\nchildren, the big one... the little one didn\u2019t go to school yet, but the big one went to school, to\nthe same school where my husband got the job from the teacher. It was in their neighborhood.\nAnd she spoke beautiful English already and she had... when the grandmother came the\nfollowing year in January, his mother came. She didn\u2019t come, the other one. And she was\nhelping her and she was translating and answering the telephone. And then I started to see it. I\nstarted to invite them for holidays, and she came. She sat at the table five minutes and after five\nminutes she excused herself and went to the porch to play with the children. I didn\u2019t think about\nnothing, about it. I says, \u201cIt\u2019s a little strange, but okay if she wants it.\u201d When it come the second\nyear, she said, \u201cI love you, but please don\u2019t invite us for the holidays.\u201d Still I didn\u2019t think it was\nsomething wrong there. Then she met a couple, I still don\u2019t know who they are, a Christian\ncouple, who went every week to Cincinnati. And she got very friendly with them. And she went\nwith the two children and the reason was, because she went for his American degree, what he\ngot, no problem. He got his American degree, but when the children are home, he cannot study.\nAnd we go there. It\u2019s more things to do there. We take them to the zoo and blah, blah, blah.\nOne day they come home, it was probably a year later and the father is asking them, \u201cHow was\nthe zoo?\u201d And the big one said, \u201cWhat kind of zoo?\u201d He says, \u201cYou didn\u2019t go to the zoo?\u201d She\nsays. \u201cNo, we went to the church.\u201d So he got very upset that she does it behind his back. Very,\nvery upset. And I don\u2019t know whether they knew it... he was married eleven years, but they\nknew each other five years already from the school. And I don\u2019t know the situation, because the\ngrandmother was there with them. But he was traveling a lot. The company was sending him\nconstantly, because they mostly work outside from Lexington. They build big, big factories, not\nhousing. And he was always sent out. One, two years after they were here, she says, \u201cI want to\ngo home for the summer, to visit my mother.\u201d I says, \u201cIsn\u2019t 1t easier to bring your mother here?\u201d\nShe says, \u201cNo, my mother wouldn\u2019t like it here.\u201d She packed. And she liked me. She was\nworking in the St. Joseph Hospital, though she was an engineer and she went for courses to...\ncomputer courses to the community college. But that job, cleaning job, she took at night, that\nshe should be with the children during the day. What was the job? She was calling me on the\nphone constantly for hours. She says, \u201cI am cleaning the clean stuff, the offices...\u201d and she says,\n\u201cIt\u2019s... in an hour I am ready.\u201d Perfect. Salary was perfect, everything was perfect. Two years,\nright two years after in the summer, 1t was August. And sometimes I was taking her, I was\ndriving her to work. They didn\u2019t live close here, but I picked her up. They lived in, it\u2019s Heritage\nVillage, near Henry Clay High School. That\u2019s where all the Russians lived at that time. I\u2019m\nsorry. I picked her up and I took her to work. And she says, \u201cI want to tell you something,\nbecause I love you. But you must swear that you won\u2019t tell it to Mischa.\u201d Mischa, Michael is\nher husband. I thought, \u201cMy God what it could be that I cannot tell it to him?\u201d So, I says,\n\u201cOkay, I swear.\u201d And I am driving. I almost made an accident what I heard. She says, \u201cI\u2019m not\ncoming back. I took a ticket, round trip, but I\u2019m not coming back. I don\u2019t want my children to\nbe brought up here. I want them to be brought up as Russians,\u201d and it meant... because she\nnever mentioned Jew. She mentioned Americans and Russians. I says, \u201cYou are talking about\nAmericans as Jews and Russians,\u201d right away I knew, \u201c...as the Russian Orthodox Church?\u201d\nShe says, \u201cNo, no. I don\u2019t mean that.\u201d I says, \u201cYes you mean it. You mean it.\u201d The husband\nwas... I don\u2019t know where. And he came home, and it was the little one\u2019s birthday. And she\nmade a birthday party and I was there. And they\u2019re supposed to leave the following day to New\nYork. And the father, who lived in Boston, was visiting... we have a summer home in the\ncountry, in the Catskills and he was with my son there. And he\u2019s supposed to go to the airport,\nhelp her to go to the airport in New York. So, I said to myself, I just couldn\u2019t believe it. I says,\n\u201cWhy are you doing it? How can you look in your husband\u2019s eye and pack?\u201d I don\u2019t know,\neverything she took, what she could. Six packages, because they took two, two, two, everyone\nof them and they were little kids. She says, \u201cIf he would be better to me...\u201d I says, \u201cBetter? He\nlives for you. He\u2019s such a father and working like unbelievable that you should have everything.\nAnd you say better?\u201d Better was that he didn\u2019t let them go to church. That was the worst. And\nshe told it in the hospital that if I don\u2019t come back, because my husband is bad to me. So, what\nshall Ido? I swore. I cannot tell it to Mischa. I called my cousin in the country. I says, \u201cLook,\nI swore that I don\u2019t tell 1t to Mischa, but I didn\u2019t swear that I\u2019m not telling it to you. Your\ndaughter won\u2019t come back. Please don\u2019t help her to go on that plane. At least the children\nshould be saved and taken away, because she kidnapped them.\u201d She said, \u201cThat\u2019s... it\u2019s\nimpossible. It\u2019s impossible.\u201d And when she didn\u2019t come back after a month, she went for a\nmonth, and I said, I told it to Mischa. She says, \u201cI don\u2019t believe you. She\u2019s the most honest\nwoman in the world. If you would tell it to me right at that time, I wouldn\u2019t believe you, that she\nis doing it to me.\u201d And she did it. She kidnapped the two kids.",

You lost your children.\u201d Every\nweek, he is calling them on the phone. And two years ago, she let them come here for a month.\nThey came alone by plane. And she came the last two weeks, because my cousin was begging\nher from Boston, that \u201cMaybe I see you the last time. I am in not a good condition and please\ncome.\u201d She came. Before they came, he bought a house. They lived in an apartment. They\nbought the house, that the children should have separated rooms. It\u2019s a three-bedroom house\nnear Man O\u2019War. A new house. He makes nice money, so he could, he got the mortgage.

And she was telling me that she thought\nthat she wouldn\u2019t come anymore, but she said, \u201cThat\u2019s not the right thing to do. That\u2019s not an\nhonest thing to do, that I started it and I should let them go.\u201d But that was an honest thing what\nshe did. You know? She wanted it.

And he had two sisters, two sisters alive at the time and him, who was the nephew. He\nwas alive. So, after 50 years. He went back twice, because he went alone and then he took his\nwife one year. And so, I knew everything about him. And I knew that he was a big artist there,\nbut he worked for the state, Communism. They always had work, but they had to do what they\ntold them to do. So, he was a real artist and then he had a little studio separate from the house.\nAnd he painted what he wanted, because his dream... he loves Odessa and he wanted to paint\nOdessa as he knew it once. And he did it. They didn\u2019t know about it, because he did the\ncommercials for everything, for the ships and for operas and everything. His name was\neverywhere because he did the commercials. So, I knew about him. Now, when my uncle died\nin 1973, I took over the writing because it was no one else. And I started to write Russian, but it\nwas very hard for me, because I never spoke Russian. But I wrote Russian and I understood\nRussian. So, with the dictionary, I wrote him Russian.

And one day, when my father was\ncalled in and he was captured in Prague and they took him behind the frontier to a pharmacy and\nthere he meets his brother.

And it was an international agreement that they can stay in the countries where\nthey were captured. Hungary, Austria, Czechoslovakia was one, Austro-Hungarian empire. So,\nafter a while when they were there, they took them to Hungary to a chemical factory, both of\nthem, together. I have, I think there\u2019s a picture there, too, about them in Russia uniforms.

My mother was married in\n1919, the beginning of 1919. And they put them there. They didn\u2019t know what\u2019s going to\nhappen to them. My uncle was there. He wasn\u2019t married. My mother had a cousin, who was a\nlawyer and he came there one day. It was already May, middle of 1919, because she was\npregnant with me. By the way, she got pregnant. She was pregnant with me. And she said, he\nsaid, \u201cYou can go out from here only one way, if you sign that you never come back to\nHungary.\u201d So, my mother, who was Hungarian, she had to sign that she never comes back to\nHungary. It was easy to sign it for my father and my uncle, but they had to sign it. So, where\nshould they go? In 1920, Czechoslovakia it was, the Czech map 1s Czech, Moravia, Slovakia,\nCarpathan. The Carpathan part, what was Hungary, after the war, the Czechs got it. My mother\nhad a second cousin there and when she heard about it, what happened, she says, \u201cCome to us.\u201d\nThey were well-to-do people. \u201cCome to us.\u201d So, they went there to Czechoslovakia. It was at\nthat time Czechoslovakia in 1920. When it came to me, to give birth, my mother got permission\nthrough that lawyer to go home and I was born in my grandmother\u2019s house, but they didn\u2019t have\nan apartment. They did have... they lived with those relatives, so they left me there with my\ngrandmother and my mother\u2019s sisters. She had three sisters. One of them was married, two were\nnot married and a brother, who was never married. He was a bachelor. Because my\ngrandmother was a widow when she was 34 years old, and she had five children. The son took\nover and he was working for the family. And that\u2019s why he never got married, until the sisters\ngot married and whatever. He was already 50 years old and he didn\u2019t get married. So we lived\nthere and 22 months after I was born, my mother was again \u2014 she was pregnant. She gave birth\nto my sister. The same thing happened. She went home with special papers and she was born\nthere in my grandmother\u2019s house.

She was\nalways worried about me, my sister, because it was only 22 months between us. And when I\nwent to first class, I got whooping cough for six months. So I had to repeat the first class, so we\nwere always together. We sat together. Here they don\u2019t let you do it. We were always together\nand everybody thought that we were... I don\u2019t know. Because we were dressed the same and\nthey thought that we are twins, but we weren\u2019t because it was 22 months between us. But we\nwere together always in school. But she was a worrier always about me. I remember when she\nwoke me up in the morning and let me repeat the lesson plan, lesson, what we had to do, you\nknow. She was always worried about me. I was a good student, but to her it came very easy. To\nme, I had to work for it. And it was a very, very close family. I just, I cannot, cannot tell you.\nWhen they met, my father and mother on the street it was always like, you know, they were\nmarried yesterday. Very, very close. My mother was like a friend to us. With everything you\ncould go to my mother and ask everything what you wanted and you got the right answer. I was\na very, very naive girl, very naive. And one girl was once telling me that if you kiss somebody\nyou can get pregnant, that kind of a business. So I always went to my mother. I says, \u201cIs it\ntrue?\u201d I don\u2019t know what grade was it. But with everything...when I went on a date and I came\nhome, I went to their bedroom, I sat on the bed and I told them everything what happened. That\nkind of a close family we were. And that\u2019s why I cannot understand today\u2019s generation, because\nit was so different. When I said to my granddaughter that I went for, for four years I had a\nboyfriend, a boy friend, friend, nothing happened between us. And for one year, for one year, he\ndidn\u2019t even kiss me, because he said he\u2019s very afraid that if he\u2019s going to kiss me, I\u2019m going to\nleave him, because of my personality. He was an unbelievable, very, very beautiful boy and he\nleft a very wealthy girl because of me. He loved me very much, but I was so naive that I didn\u2019t\nthink that I love him. But it was a beautiful, wonderful feeling that every week he came. We\nmet twice a week, Saturday and Sunday. Every week he came and his hands were behind his\nback and he brought me \u2014 because he knew I loved the... what are the little blue flowers?",
        "A: Very, very little.",
        "A: They are not forget me... anyway...",
        "A: Violets. Winter, summer, always, always when he came, he had the violets. And it was a\nwonderful feeling to know that you have someone to go out with to the movies. We had five\no\u2019clock teas there. It was a very nice place where young people got together. And then he\nstarted to be called to the Army. And when he was called to the Army he was somewhere\nalways close, so he eloped. He came home to see me on the weekends. And everybody was\ntelling me that he\u2019s looking at me like he loves me. And I was just laughing. I didn\u2019t realize it.\nI didn\u2019t realize it. After four years when I met my husband and he was already somewhere in\nRussia, somewhere in labor camp, him. And he wrote me and I wrote him. And I wrote him that\nwhat happened with my family and I\u2019m going to get married, because I need to change my name.\nAnd when I wrote that letter I thought I'd die. Then I knew that I loved him. That feeling, I\nnever, never forget. Such a naivete. Can you imagine that? Then I really...",
        "A: And he died. He died in Russia. He was Nicholas. He was Nicholas, actually it was Nicolash\n(ph) in Hungary. So it\u2019s Nicholas. They were a very wealthy family. His father had a pawn\nshop. And he had a sister, who was teaching piano. And we never spoke about marriage\nbecause he always said, he spoke already English at that time. And one day, in 1938, the\nHungarians took back that part of Czechoslovakia. So we were in trouble, but we children didn\u2019t\nrealize it that we are in trouble, only my parents. And it was terrible. And then he said to me,\none day when he came home, he says, \u201cCome with me to Israel.\u201d I looked at him. I says,\n\u201cWithout my parents?\u201d And it was no Israel, young people went to Palestine. Maybe he would\nbe alive, if he would gone. He wouldn\u2019t go without me. And I says, \u201cI cannot go without my\nparents.\u201d And he came back from some place. And we were always discussing other girls, and\nwho is the cute girl, who is the nice girl. And one day, I was already married, when I heard that\nhe engaged, a year later, he engaged a girl, whom we were discussing, that she is a nice girl. But\nthey never got married, because he died in... they took him to Russia, that transport labor camp.\nAnd he died. And he was the only one who died from his family, because he had a brother who\nsurvived in England and his parents and sisters survived there in Uzhgorod where we lived.\nPeople were hiding them. He was the only one who died from the family.",
        "A: Gosh, I cannot believe it, that I don\u2019t remember.",
        "A: 18.",
        "A: Yes, when the Hungarians came in, yes. And 1941, until 1941. In 1941, I met my husband in\nBudapest and he was already... I don\u2019t know which /agers. He was in labor camps, but they\ntook them out from that part of Czechoslovakia. They took them out to Russia. In Hungary,\nthey kept them in Hungary in labor camp. But that was part of, you know, that was\nthat time, they took, like over the border and they took them to camps. And when I wrote them\nthat what happened, that I need another name. And he wrote me back a letter and he said, \u201cIf\nyou would have told me, I would right away marry you.\u201d And his friend was alive, very good\nfriend and I met him once. And he said that for one day he disappeared in the woods and they\nthought he is committing suicide because of me. But then he came and they took him and all of\nthem died. So, it was a terrible thing, terrible that I was so naive, that I didn\u2019t realize it that Iam\nin love. Because I don\u2019t even know. I, I... we just kissed, that\u2019s it. And we wouldn\u2019t, he\nwouldn\u2019t dare to do nothing, because he said that, \u201cYour personality is requiring such a...\u201d \u2014I\ncannot say it in English, that word. Respect. That he was afraid to kiss me for a year, because\nhe thought that I am going to leave him if he 1s going to kiss me. I don\u2019t know whether I would\nleave him, because I was very naive, after. So it was like Plato... nobody believed us. Because\nthey said when we went to the movies and we were like four couples together and they said, \u201cHe\ndoesn\u2019t look at the movies, he\u2019s just looking at you.\u201d It\u2019s an unbelievable thing, and when I am\ntelling it to my grand-daughter, she\u2019s laughing, \u201cGrandma, those are the nineties.\u201d You know?\nIt took me a long, long time to realize that my granddaughter were not seven years with his\nboyfriend and nothing happened between them. I just... I couldn\u2019t imagine that something could\nhappen... you know\u201d? I trusted her, because I was that way, so I thought, always I thought that\nIlona is ours, from our family. And my husband always said to me, \u201cNo matter what, you always\ncan count on Ilona.\u201d He was always telling me that. And if you leave something for the\nchildren, he said, \u201cJacob is a boy, he will always make it. Leave more for Ilona.\u201d That\u2019s what\nhe always said. He was mistaken, too.",
        "A: Yes, but I couldn\u2019t, in \u201838 it was finished. I couldn\u2019t go anymore to school.",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t think so. It was unusual, I knew one only, in the city, who was a pharmacist. But the\nCzech girls, I don\u2019t know what for, they took Latin. We had all the Czech girls in the\ngymnasium. And that was only... why would they take Latin? Only if they wanted to be\ndoctors or pharmacists. But we didn\u2019t get so far, that\u2019s it. And I never knew what my sister, she\nstill went one year to school when I was already in Budapest. Your back hurt you?",
        "A: So, I just really don\u2019t know. I never, I don\u2019t know what she wanted to be. It\u2019s so interesting. I\nknow she was 22 years younger, 22 months, and it was very hard to me, like, to go for my first\nball. It was the medical students\u2019 ball. And at that time he was already in the Army and one\nmedical student, who went in Prague to school, to medical school. They didn\u2019t have medical\nschool there, now they have medical school there. And he was a short fellow and he knew that I\nam going out with that boy, but he was in the Army, so he took me. He came home for vacation\nand he took me to the Medical Ball. I would never forget that occasion, because it was\nchaperoned. My mother was there and it was winter and we went on the sled with horses, you\nknow, that kind of it. I would never forget it. And my aunt from Budapest... every year, every\nsummer we went to Budapest, my mother\u2019s family, and they always dressed us up, the children.\nI remember that she gave me-- it was hers, but it fit me beautifully-- a light blue, long, velvet\nevening gown. And it was open, but it has a pearlerie (ph) what I could take off. I will never\nforget that day. And he never, he didn\u2019t let me dance with no one else. Other boys wanted to...\nno. The whole night he was dancing with me. It\u2019s a very interesting story. He became a\npediatrician in Prague. And he went, I think that he went to German college. They had two\ncolleges, Czech and German, he or the other one, the dermatologist went... one of them. The\ndermatologist, I had nothing to do with, because just my friend was marrying him and I know\nthat he went to German college. But he went, I didn\u2019t know whether he is alive or not. And\nwhen we came to Brooklyn, because that\u2019s where we came, to my uncle. And one day I am\nwalking on a street and I see a millinery shop, we had it in Hungary and I see the name. And I\nwent in, and it was, because she had one in Uzhgorod in Czechoslovakia. Can I hold it for you?",
        "A: And she, that was his sister. And she says, \u201cMy God, you are alive. He\u2019s not married. You are\nmarried?\u201d I said, \u201cYes, I am married.\u201d And he came to visit his sister from Prague and he\nwasn\u2019t married. And he called me on the phone one day and I didn\u2019t see him. My husband was\nvery jealous and I wouldn\u2019t even dare to invite him. But my husband was working and I spoke\nabout an hour on the phone with him. And he was asking me, how I am doing and what I am\ndoing and so on and so on. And then he went back and he married a German woman. I heard\nthat he stayed in Germany, but he got divorced, too from that. First time he got married. But he\nwas in love with me. And I knew that, that he was in love with me, but I would never like kiss\nhim or something. No way. [Phone rings.] Doesn\u2019t matter. If somebody knows me, they call\nme on my phone. Ana should be coming home. Maybe she is going, calling me. I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: Yes, public. We didn\u2019t have private schools. It was very interesting under the Czechs. We had\nreligion in the school. Every religion had their own religion. We had the rabbi coming in once\nor twice a week and the Christians had they priest. And the girls were sitting on his lap, the\nCzech girls, you know? On the priest\u2019s lap. [Laughter.] Now, I know what it meant, but just\nunbelievable. After school we went to a German-speaking religious school and we learned more\nabout religion. But it\u2019s funny that I know my teacher\u2019s name and I forgot what was, gosh, what\nwas my boyfriend\u2019s name?",
        "A: I will remember it. No. The interesting thing is it was, what we learned, like praying, prayer, it\nwas from my mother. My mother, she was forcing us, like every Friday night we had to pray and\nalways even if we were crying that it\u2019s too much, too much. It was hard. Every week, one more\npage. And actually we learned to pray from my mother, not in school. We learned about\nreligion from that rabbi. We didn\u2019t learn... we learned how to write, but that wasn\u2019t Hebrew,\nthat was like Yiddish. But the alphabet was the same and it was a time that they had there a\npaper, newspaper, a Jewish paper. And I could read it without punctuation. I have no idea about\nnothing, that\u2019s why I never could go up to the Torah and read the Torah, because I have no idea.\nI have to learn, if I would want to read something, I would break my neck to learn it. You know?\nBecause that\u2019s without punctuation, the Torah. But otherwise I read fluently, but I don\u2019t know\nwhat I\u2019m reading.",
        "A: We spoke, first of all when they met, it was... my mother didn\u2019t speak Russian, he didn\u2019t speak\nHungarian. Both of them spoke German, so it was German. The starting was German, until my\nfather learned Hungarian. And it was German for a long, long time, because we had two hours\nof gymnasium, every day two hours German. And the Czechs hated the Hungarians. My mother\nnever learned Czech. She just spoke German and Hungarian, because my grandmother spoke\nGerman. When she was a little girl, she came from Slovakia where the part, where German lived\nand she spoke German. Not the Jewish, German. And when we went on the street and we were\nwalking and we saw a professor coming from the school, because those are professors in\ngymnasium. It was like, what should I tell you? It was eight gymnasium, so it\u2019s equal like four\nyears college. Because after eight, elementary school and then it was a... plipravka (ph),\nbetween gymnasium and a year where we were preparing to go to gymnasium. It was a year.\nSo, and we saw some professor coming, so we right away started to pull my mother\u2019s skirt.\nGerman, speaking German, that they shouldn\u2019t know that we speak Hungarian. Because they...\nwe spoke so well Czech, that they didn\u2019t believe that we are not Czechs. But then when they\nfound out that we are not Czechs, but they didn\u2019t know that we speak Hungarian. [Laughing. ]\nSo, we had to speak German on the streets.",
        "A: No, it wasn\u2019t, when you are a child... and then when we were preparing to come to America.\nWe were preparing after we heard what\u2019s happening. My parents are telling us that we are in\ntrouble. And my uncle managed to come to America, so we started to learn English, private.",
        "A: It was in 1940. We were preparing. And it was a teacher, who learned in England. He studied\nin England. He wasn\u2019t a young man. And he was so proud of us, me and my sister, that we are\nso good, that when we went... small town, bigger than here, but it was still... 1t was the capital\nof Carpathan. It was a promenade. They builded it up beautifully, the Czechs, that time, near\nthe water. We had a bridge dividing the city, so it was a very nice city. And it was a promenade,\nbanks, sitting people, and he started to speak loud to us, English, that was, you know, his\ncommercial. We had had English, Anna Karenina and everything already. We were very good.\nSo Czech school. Czech I spoke perfect, German I spoke that time perfect, Hungarian and\nEnglish.",
        "A: Czech.",
        "A: We were Czech citizens. After five years we were, or even earlier, we were Czech citizens. But\nwhen the Hungarians came in, we were no citizens, because the Czechs run away. They went to\nCzechoslovakia. But we couldn\u2019t go because we weren\u2019t born there. And naturalized citizens\ncouldn\u2019t go with them and we were stuck there. And that\u2019s how my parents were killed. The\nvery first, because of that. But the other Russians, probably whoever ts alive, oh, they are not\nalive anymore, because they were like my father\u2019s age. But they were 46 years old when they\nkilled them. They was the same age, my father and my mother. And my sister was 19. And my\nsister could escape, but he says, \u201cNo way, I go where my mother goes.\u201d And I had that guilt\nfeeling that I wanted to commit suicide because of that, too. Because we were so close. And he\nsaid, \u201cI go where my mother.\u201d And we had no idea, where she went or what happened or where\nshe going. It was terrible, terrible. And that aunt, my mother\u2019s youngest sister, who was very\nwell-to-do when she got married, she was... they were very wealthy people. And she had one\nson. And he\u2019s on the picture that I think. His name was George. My George is named after\nhim, because then he became the child of the family who... the two brothers, my uncle, my\nmother\u2019s sister\u2019s husband, he was alive and his brother was alive. Because they were in a labor\ncamp in Hungary. And when George was born, then George got his name then, he had a little\nboy...\nEnd of Tape 1, Side B\nTape 2, Side A",

        "A: The whole family, my grandmother\u2019s children, they were born all there, but my grandmother was\nactually from a place, Zam Plain (ph), it\u2019s called, from Slovakia. I told you that there were\nGermans there. My Grandmother, but all the childrens were born there. And all my\ngrandmother\u2019s sisters, who were living there too when she was a child, all their children were all\nborn in Budapest. Everybody was, you know, the cousins and everybody was born in Budapest.\nAnd there were plenty of them. All of them, the least, had three children, my grandmother\u2019s\nsisters, and more. And she had, herself, she had five sisters and a brother, but they were all born\nin Hungary, in Budapest, as far as I know, in Budapest. I don\u2019t know no one who was born\noutside of Budapest. Except for my husband. He was... they were farmers, big farmers, in... I\ncan\u2019t even describe you where is it, outside, not in Budapest, of course. It was close to Eger,\nEger is a big city. But they lived on a farm when he was a young boy and they were very\nwealthy people. And the first, I don\u2019t know what year was it, when the Romanians came in and\nthey took away the farm. Second time the Russians took away the farm and the Germans, they\ntook away. Three times, everything was taken away and then their lives were taken away from\nthem, too.",

It was in a very nice\nplace and a very beautiful city. And to me, every city what is divided with a river, the city itself,\nit\u2019s a beautiful city. [Phone rings.] And that was divided.",
        "A: No, she never worked. She was just a hausfrau, house mother, but we were struggling. My\nfather was... they were struggling until they... something happened with them. My mother, I\nremember she made our clothes, everything, she sewed alone by hand. We didn\u2019t have even a\nmachine, a sewing machine. But she tried the best and she tried to brought us up that we were\nreally, everybody who spoke about us... and there are only two people in Brooklyn, who knew\nmy parents from my childhood, only two people, two friends I have, who knew them and how\nthey are talking about them. It\u2019s terrible. One lived in Prague, she got married and then they\ncame to America and her husband was a dermatologist and then he got Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\nAnyway. So, she, we became, we are still friends, but now telephone friends. We are talking.\nAnd she has two very successful children, unbelievable. He\u2019s a dentist. Middle of New York,\nhe has an office. But they came after the Czech revolution that was in the sixties. They came\nwith everything, with furniture, with Steinway piano. They brought everything with them.\nOriental carpets. Not as we came, because they didn\u2019t let us take nothing with us when we came.\nBut only two people. And it\u2019s so sad that only two people knew my parents. You know? It\u2019s\nunbelievable. Of course... no, my cousin, he doesn\u2019t... in Canada, he doesn\u2019t remember. My\ncousin in Budapest, she remembers my parents. She was younger than my sister. She\u2019s younger\nthan my sister was, but she is remembering my parents. But otherwise, no one remembers my\nparents. It\u2019s very sad. And I don\u2019t know about my grandchildren. I wrote down everything.\nThey have it on tape and still they are very mixed up when I speak about an aunt, you see, we\nhave somebody by the name of Ilou (ph), what was a sister-in-law of my aunt, but they have the\nsame name. Because that was a second marriage to my uncle\u2019s brother. And the name was the\nsame Ilou and Ilia (ph). But the other one, the older one, she is not mixing it up. She knows the\ndifference, who was Ilika (ph) to us and who is Ilou, she knows. Ilou she knows, she was here\ntoo. She\u2019s alive. That was my uncle\u2019s sister-in-law by second marriage, because the first wife\ndied with the four year old little boy. And he always wanted children, so he married a younger\nwoman than him and she couldn\u2019t have never children. But she has a big family in Israel. She\nhas a brother and she has a sister-in-law in Montreal, because her brother died when they came to\nCanada. When we came here, they went to Canada. And he was a paper (ph) engineer. He\nwasn\u2019t used to Canadian winter, slippery. And he made a car accident and he got a stroke from\nit. And he didn\u2019t die, but he got a second stroke and he died. And he was a young man. He was\n42, something like that and he left his wife and his young eight years old son in Canada. And the\nwife had a German nana. She was a real German, wonderful, wonderful person, from her\nchildhood. Because she had very, very wealthy parents, and she had a sister, she died, too. And\nher parents died, but that woman, she stayed with her all through her life. And she was bringing\nup her son, too. And then she died in Canada. She never went back. She was from Vienna.\nVery nice person. I remember her so well. I met her many times when we went to Canada. First\nthey lived in Montreal and they moved to Toronto when the French started that you had to speak\nFrench. He\u2019s an engineer, too, my cousin.",
        "A: I had Czech friends, non-Jewish Czech friends, yes. They were very good friends. They had,\nthey were entirely different... their thinking was different from ours. First of all they were very\nloose, the Czech girls, it was unbelievable. There were many, many, even in my class, there\nwere three twins. Can you imagine? There were many twins, girls. And, but they were good\nfriends. And then we had Hungarian friends, Jewish girls friends. We had. We had quite a lot.\nAnd we got together, before I went out with the boy. We got together always, every week at\nsomebody\u2019s house. During the week it was strictly studying. And we went to movies and as I\nsaid... then we belonged to a Jewish organization, Kadima (ph), that\u2019s actually, they have it in\nIsrael now, too, Kadima.",
        "A: It is a Zionist organization, yes, and it was a youth organization. And in the summer we made\nexcursions, but only for one day, in the mountains together. It was a very nice life in\nCzechoslovakia. The Czech people are wonderful people and that was the real democracy.\nWhat I lived under, Masaryk and Benes (ph), that was a real democracy. And I am laughing\nwhen I am talking here about democracy. I says, \u201cDo those people know what\u2019s democracy?\u201d\nYou know, there are castes here and everywhere. And even in the hospital... I worked 27 years\nin Brooklyn Jewish Hospital. And there were very few people who were really, as you say,\nmensch people. Like it was a old doctor, he was the head of the Pediatrics. He was the only one\nwho went there in the morning and he shook hands with the elevator guy and something like that.\nYou know? It was... it was entirely different. They speak here about democracy, but they don\u2019t\nknow what it is. I remember that once before, my husband... my father had many jobs before\nthey had, they bought a... I don\u2019t know what year was it. They bought together a drugstore. But\ndrugstore, it means, because they didn\u2019t have their diploma or certificate. And I have my own\ndiploma, Russian diploma. So when he came to America, he worked in New York in a\npharmacy, in a German pharmacy, and he was the head of the Herbs department. They sell\nmany, many. But he couldn\u2019t do a prescription. And that was the situation with my father, too,\nwhen they went to Czechoslovakia. So they bought a drugstore, but they had everything but\nprescription drugs. But they didn\u2019t have luncheonettes like here. It was no such a thing. But the\ntrouble was, then they separated and a pharmacist died. And it was a beautiful new pharmacy.\nAnd his wife wanted my father to work for her. Okay. He took over and he was substituting\noutside. He knew pharmacists and when they were for vacation, he was substituting in the\npharmacy. He knows, he did everything. And then when he took over that pharmacy and my\nuncle had the drugstore. And it was a big place and a small place, because everybody knew\neverybody. So if somebody went to my uncle, they were... they felt bad that they don\u2019t go to my\nfather. That kind of a situation, you know? It was very bad. So on the end, he had to leave that\npharmacy and he went back with my uncle, together, because, you know, there were lot of\nRussian people. They were non-Jews, lots. And they knew all each other. And one, oh,\nespecially one, who let me go to the office. He had a very big position and he let me go to the\noffice and learn the Russian typewriter. That\u2019s how I knew how to type Russian. But it came\nvery, very good after the war, when I worked for the dictionaries. I was the only one who typed\nRussian in Hungary. So they were all friends, non-Jews and Jews, the Russians. Of course, they\nwere all educated people. I\u2019m not saying that the others were because probably they were anti-\nSemitic, like, you know. Like it always was anti-Semitism in Russia. But they were very good\nfriends. I never forget it, that one Christmas night, she said, \u201c\u201cYou must come to our church.\u201d\nIt\u2019s very interesting, the Russian Orthodox church.\u201d There, it was interesting. No, I don\u2019t want\nto hear about it, what happened with her. And it\u2019s different, I see it on the television. That it is\nentirely different in Moscow what it was there. It was a church where you didn\u2019t have seats, you\nknow? You were all standing and he was like the leader there or whatever. And everybody who\ncame in got three kisses, you know. Three times you kiss. Very friendly, very, very friendly.\nThey were very, very nice people. And then I remember it was a photographer, Kantor (ph) was\nhis name. And I don\u2019t know how he survived, because he was Jewish. And he survived, I don\u2019t\nknow how. They sent him back with the non-Jews. And then my friends from Brooklyn, who\nknew them too, and they were in California and they met him. He was alive for a long time and\nhe met their sons. So that kind of, you know, friends we had there, in Uzhorod.",
        "A: It was terrible. 1938. It was terrible because... I don\u2019t know whether I say somewhere that my\ncousin came and wanted to adopt us? Okay. My cousin, who was in Siberia for many years. He\nlived in Budapest, and one day he came to Uzhorod and he knew about the situation, that they\nwere worried what is going to happen, because they were thrown out from Hungary. He came\nand he said, \u201cI am going to adopt the children.\u201d\u201d Under eighteen he could have done it. \u201cAnd\njust the name will change. They can\u2019t stay with you. Just God forbid something happens that\nthe children should be safe.\u201d\u201d And I remember the day that they called us and they called us in\nthe bedroom, my father and my mother and him. And they explained it to us and we started to\ncry. We thought that we are going to be taken away from them. And we couldn\u2019t understand it.\nWhy? Why? Why? Though I was 18 years old in 1938. But I just, we just... to take another\nname, and... they didn\u2019t explain it to us, that what can happen. You know? Though we knew\nthe story. We knew the story, but we didn\u2019t think about it, that my father was never led back to\nHungary. Only my mother and us, every summer. He never was let back to Hungary to go back.\nAnd suddenly he\u2019s traveling to Hungary, because Hungary is, we are Hungary. And so after big,\nbig discussions, we decided that we won\u2019t do it. We children didn\u2019t want to do it. And that\ncosted my sister\u2019s life. But my sister could be saved, and he didn\u2019t want because... originally\nwhen they went to that cousin, she wanted to take my sister away, right away when she saw\nwhat\u2019s going to happen, what\u2019s happening. I didn\u2019t know. I wasn\u2019t there in \u201841. And my sister\ndidn\u2019t want to go. She could have been saved. And then she came, and she came... it was\nactually my grandmother\u2019s side. Somebody I don\u2019t know how they were cousins. I don\u2019t know.\nUp to today I don\u2019t know. But she wanted, she told me that she wanted to take her, but she is\ndead, too. She went to the camps, too. So probably my sister, if she would take my sister, she\nwouldn\u2019t be alive anyway. But she says \u201cNo. Whatever is going to happen, it\u2019s going to\nhappen.\u201d But nobody knew, nobody believed it that some thing is going to happen. So, that\u2019s it.",

And one day, the boy with\nwhom I went out and his friend, they came by car in Hungarian uniforms to see us. And I just, I\ncouldn\u2019t believe it. It was very far away. And he was begging me that I should go home. He\nfelt something. I didn\u2019t. I didn\u2019t know nothing that time, because I didn\u2019t know my husband.\nBut he says, \u201c\u201cCome home and come home, and go home.\u201d I says, \u201cOkay, we are going to go\nhome.\u201d But we had a good time.

        "A: In 1940 to Uzhorod. We went back home. And in 1941, in 1941, yes, in January, about in\nJanuary, I had trouble with my rheumatic fever, because I had rheumatic fever when I was\nyoung, very bad. I almost died from it. Six months I was in bed, high fever. That\u2019s why I have\nheart trouble. And I went back and my mother said that \u201cYour sister is still in school. Go alone.\nYou are now 21 years old, 1941. You can travel alone,\u201d because it was about a day by train from\nUzhgorod to Budapest. \u201cAnd take the cure.\u201d I had a doctor there, who every year prescribed me\na cure, what I had to take in a bath.

And I\nwas expecting that he is going to open the door, but my husband, he opened the door. And I just\nlooked at him. Who is he? I never heard from him. And they introduced us to him, so my sister\nknew him, only my sister. And he was talking to me. And he was a very good looking guy.\nAnd he was seven years older than I was. And he, the next few days we supposed to go back\nhome to Budapest, to Uzhorod. And his aunt, in the morning comes to my grandma\u2019s house, I\nwas in bed still. And he says, \u201cEmilie,\u201d my nickname was Millie. The whole family knows me,\nMillie. My name is Emilie, officially.

[Laughing.] But still it was very funny to me. And he said, \u201cI know that you are\ngoing, you are going out with somebody, but how is it? Is it serious?\u201d I says, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\nWe never spoke about marriage.\u201d We spoke about marriage, but he always told me that he\ncannot get married until he is not on his own. He is in his father\u2019s business and until then, he\ncannot get married. He spoke a few languages. He spoke already then very well English. We\nnever spoke about marriage, never. I says, \u201cWe never spoke about marriage. I don\u2019t know how I\nstand and whatever. We are friends, we are very good friends.\u201d So he says, \u201cNo, he\u2019s serious.\u201d\nI says, \u201cOkay.\u201d Next day we went back to Uzhorod. And I didn\u2019t hear from him.

        "A: He was actually, he will finish business college. He had a business, here they don\u2019t have those\nbusinesses, because that time was everything, the transportation with horse and carriage. And he\nwas in business, I am always saying we are eating his horse food, because, oat, oat. That\u2019s in\nHungary horse food. So, he had a business with oat. But through the... it was a big business\nbecause he was connected to... I\u2019m sorry, to... Wall Street, what is it? Wall Street business.",
        "A: It wasn\u2019t Wall Street there, but every business, big businesses were... so it was a big business,\nand he made a lot of money. And he lived there. But I knew about him. They told me, he did\ntell me that time, that he just left his girlfriend, whom he went out for four years, because... his\nmother was against it because the girlfriend wasn\u2019t Jewish. And his sister already was married to\na Catholic. So she said, \u201cIt\u2019s enough, one person.\u201d She was converted, she was married in a\nChristian church with popes, papers that she can get married. Her daughter was born already as\nChristian. And he loved his parents and he loved his mother and after four years he left the girl.\nThe girl wanted to commit suicide. It was a country girl. They had a restaurant there. Because\nwhen he was living there with the same business in smaller... it was small town and he had his\nlittle farm alone and horse and everything. And he lived alone there. And then he wanted to get\nrid of her because of his mother and he came to Budapest. And once he came, she came after\nhim, but I never met her. But he was telling me that she came after him because she was so in\nlove with him. So anyway, so that was the story that he fell in love with me. You know? She\nleft... so, then I found out the story I says, \u201cOh, how do I trust him, if that\u2019s the story?\u201d Because\nhe left one, then he wants to marry me. Well, anyway. So we went out and it was already, I\nfinished my cure and it was already war. My uncle was already in America with the last ship and\nin \u201841 it was already bad. And we went out for a dinner and he brought his friend with him, who\nwas in the same business. And we went to a restaurant and people are looking in the papers for\nthe news. It was no television, radios were, but no televisions. And he took a paper and he\u2019s\nlooking in a paper and I am asking him something and he didn\u2019t hear me. And this way I did\nwith my hand and I turned to his friend. That he saw, that I waved and he took me home that\nnight and I didn\u2019t see him for three weeks. He thought that I did it, that I don\u2019t care about him.\nHe was so sensitive, but I didn\u2019t know that. For three weeks I didn\u2019t see him. The third week, I\nsaid, \u201cI\u2019m going home.\u201d I said to his aunt, because we were very close, even we lived very\nclose. And I said it to his cousin that I\u2019m going home. And he says, \u201cWhy, what happened?\u201d I\nsays, \u201cI don\u2019t know what happened. I didn\u2019t hear from him and that\u2019s it.\u201d He went home to his\nmother, then his mother was telling me... I met his mother, very nice lady, she was very nice. I\nmet his parents. I went to Eger. He took me once. And she was telling me that he came home\nnext morning and he was crying. He was seven years older than me, that she finally found\nsomebody whom he loves, and she doesn\u2019t want me. He was... you know, it was a\nmisunderstanding, the whole thing, but I didn\u2019t know that he is such a sensitive guy, that he\nthinks... so it was a misunderstanding. But he find out that Iam going home. Next day, it came\na big rose, you know, flowers, and \u201cPlease don\u2019t go.\u201d\nEnd of Tape 2, Side A\nTape 2, Side B",
        "A: ...the marriage certificate and then I don\u2019t know. I can\u2019t remember what happened. Probably...\nI don\u2019t know. Because I remember what my father wrote, that he\u2019s giving his crown of his life to\nhim and he should take care of her, that kind of a style, you know. And we agreed that my\nengagement will be third of July in my grandmother\u2019s house. Because we don\u2019t have my uncle\nanymore there and that those relatives were not so close relatives that we should make an\nengagement. Our family was always, my family, my mother\u2019s family was always the family. It\nwas arranged everything, it was a Sunday and the whole family was together, the sisters and\neverything. I remember a beautiful table was made and my parents, my sister should come up to\nthe engagement and they never came. That story you know. That they were called to the police\nand I got a telegram from our friends that they called them to the police and they never let them\nout and \u201cYou disappear. Go in hiding.\u201d",
        "A: My friends who lived near us in Uzhorod, they were our friends and they lived near us. And\nthey saw when they, they knew that they went to the police and they never came out. And they\nsaid, \u201cProbably they are looking for you,\u201d because they knew everything, everything who was\nnot a citizen. Because we weren\u2019t Hungarian citizens. The papers were at the police. That was\nthe police. And they knew that you were four people and they got only three people, so you\nbetter go to hiding. So, I couldn\u2019t get married, because he was already in labor camp, too, from\n1941 on. But that time he was home still. With the... he was in the Hungarian uniform, he was\nso gorgeous. He was an officer. And he... we couldn\u2019t get married, because in Hungary we\ncouldn\u2019t get married. Only when we were 24 years old without the father\u2019s consent, at that time.\nCan you imagine? Today you can get married if you are ten years old, I think. So, he went,\nshort, right after, they stripped him of his uniform and he went to labor camp. And I stayed there\nwith my grandmother and every night, I slept somewhere else. Some other relatives and by his\nfriends, because everything happened during the night, that they were looking for people.",
        "A: Yes, yes. So, we didn\u2019t know what happened to them or where they are. And my, the youngest\nsister of my mother, IIllie, ona, they found out that they brought up a lot of, a transport from\nUzhorod to Budapest and they put them like in a jail. But they were there for two weeks, and\nthey went to visit them. They talked to them and they went to visit them. And my mother told\nthem that I shouldn\u2019t come there, because I look like her and it has no sense that I should be\nthere, because they are going to get out from there. And one day they let out my father with a\npoliceman for money to my cousin\u2019s house, who was in Siberia. He lived very close to that\nplace and he wasn\u2019t home already, just his wife. And nobody was in the apartment and the\npolice brought my father there and he left, the police. And he says, \u201cI come back...\u201d this and\nthat time. I don\u2019t know, it was an hour and a half. And I met my father. And first we just\ncouldn\u2019t talk, we were just crying and crying and we didn\u2019t know what to say to each other. And\nhe was just constantly questioning me. \u201cAre you sure that that\u2019s whom you want to marry?\u201d\nBecause he knew about that I went out with that boy for four years. And he said, \u201cAre you sure,\nare you sure?\u201d And worried about me. I says, \u201cI am not sure of nothing, but I hope it will be all\nright.\u201d And he said, I said, \u201cLook, my aunt knows his aunt and they know the family, so I hope\nit will be all right.\u201d And he called up from Uzhorod, he called Uzhorod and he called up the\nsenators. They were all Russians. There were many Russians, they were non-Jews in Uzhorod.\nAnd he knew everybody. And they told him, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, tomorrow you\u2019ll be out.\u201d And we\nparted and he says, \u201cI hope we see each other tomorrow.\u201d And tomorrow came and my aunt and\neven my husband, he wasn\u2019t my husband at that time, my aunt and her husband, they all went to\nthe train station, because they said the people are going to go home by train to Uzhorod.\nEverybody went back, who was non-Jew. The Jews went in separate cars to Kamana Spodovski\n(ph), where they killed them. And my husband, he had a very, very soft heart, like him. And he\ncouldn\u2019t even, he couldn\u2019t see the scene. Though they went with regular cars, not like with cattle\ncars, but with police and whatever, soldiers, Hungarian soldiers. He run away. He couldn\u2019t see\nit. He just saw them from a distance. And I think my sister recognized him. I don\u2019t know. That\nwas that. And then a few weeks, about two weeks later, I got a card from my sister, in my\nsister\u2019s handwriting, that \u201c\u201cWe are in Kamana Spodovski (ph). We don\u2019t know what are we\ngoing to do here. We don\u2019t know if we are going to have where to stay, but we are here.\u201d And it\nwas a Hungarian stamp on it, so it means that a Hungarian soldier brought it back. And what I\nknow from the museum, that\u2019s why I went this Spring to the museum, I told you that. To find\nout the truth. Because she went first, my daughter-in-law, and asked about it, and met there\nsomebody in the library, who was very nice. And she, he showed her the book and he took out a\nfew pages from the book and he made copies for me. And he sent it to me. He even spoke to me\nover the phone when my sister, when my daughter-in-law was there. And he said, it wasn\u2019t that\ntime that they killed them. I always thought that they killed them when they left in July. When I\nwas there, I looked at the book, but I couldn\u2019t buy it. It\u2019s such a big book. It was not only about\nthem, because, he said, they said, and it\u2019s here and it\u2019s terrible, that 38 thousand people were\nkilled in one day, because they didn\u2019t know what to do with them. Because they took them to\nPoland and the Polish people were already in ghettos that time. So they couldn\u2019t help them.\nNobody could help them. And the Germans didn\u2019t know what to do with them, so they let them\nmade their own grave, naked, like us in Auschwitz. They took the clothes away, they put them\non one line and on the orders. They made a big, big grave and they had to make the grave. And\nfrom the other side, the German soldiers were shooting them in the graves and right away, the\ntanks were running over them. So I wanted that book, but it was no sense, because it was\nfrom... I have the pages what I needed. And I see the pictures how they sit there on the end of\nthe, the forest. And the people... and I saw the... I told you about that 12 series what was on\ntelevision, The Winds of War? You never heard about The Winds of War? Mitchum played in\nit. It started only four series. It was a beautiful movie. It was a French-Jewish writer, who was\nin France and his niece was with him. You don\u2019t know that story? It\u2019s Winds of War, is the\nname. It\u2019s in the public library. After that they made a 12 series, 12 two hours, 12 times, the\nwhole summer and I saw all of it. It was a Hungarian, originally he was Hungarian, an actor.\nAnd his father was amongst those people who were taken and that was his idea to make that\nmovie. You see original pictures what the Germans took. Because it starts out like a colored\nmovie and suddenly it\u2019s black and white pictures. And you see the trains what we went in and I\ncouldn\u2019t look. I said, \u201cI see myself somewhere there.\u201d But when I saw, I saw the whole thing,\nhow they killed them. And then I really couldn\u2019t look, because I said, \u201cMy God, I am going to\nrecognize either my sister or somebody I\u2019m going recognize.\u201d I couldn\u2019t look at it. Everything\nis in it, from the beginning to the end, with Auschwitz, everything. Twelve series and it is in the\npublic library, everybody can borrow it.",
        "A: Absolutely no idea. No idea what they were doing, what is going to happen. We heard from\nSlovakia, what was near us, Slovakia, they are taking young girls somewhere, only young girls.\nAnd where they are taking them and what they are doing with them, we didn\u2019t know. And they\nwere taking them to Auschwitz, because I recognized one of them. Four years later, I recognized\none of them. They were taking them there. They were building Auschwitz actually. And many\nof them they made their lovers, the Germans, because they were all pretty girls they took. And\nthen I knew, that they took them to Auschwitz. And when it was starting to happen, already it\nstarted near the, where Elie Wiesel is from... near Romania it started. They started to take\npeople. And they were always saying \u201cIt cannot happen in Budapest, it cannot happen.\u201d And\nwhen I said that it can happen, they always said \u201cYou are a pessimist.\u201d It cannot happen in\nBudapest, that was the story.",

And I let him, show my palm and tell me about my\nparents. And they said that \u201cThey are very far away, don\u2019t wait for them.\u201d That\u2019s what she was\ntelling me. \u201cThey are in big danger.\u201d I just couldn\u2019t understand it. But I had a feeling, that it\u2019s\nsomething terrible happening, but I never had any idea. No, never. And when we were going to\nAuschwitz, I didn\u2019t know where we are going, but I said, \u201cAh, maybe we go somewhere, where I\ncan see or meet my parents.\u201d IfI don\u2019t, I didn\u2019t know where we are going. Nobody knew where\nwe are going. It was just unbelievable. So when I wanted to commit suicide, my aunt saved me,\nmy mother\u2019s younger sister, Illie, Iona. And she had a 13-year-old boy. And three years, I was,\nit was terrible. Every night I slept somewhere else. And the third year, that before the Nazis\ncame, she says, \u201cYou are not going nowhere. Up to now they did look for you, you are our\nchild, and you stay with us.\u201d And I stayed with them. I was like their child, they said. They had\na doctor who was, you know, house doctor, and he treated me like they child, and I was with\nthem.",
        "A: Until 1944. Nobody was helping you, that was all family. I went to my grandmothers, sisters,\ndaughters, cousins. And my husband had friends, they knew about it. And I slept every night\nsomewhere else. During the day I stayed with my grandmother. And when I stayed with my\ngrandmother, and I stayed there overnight, we were always in the basement, because they were\nbombing us. Terrible bombing, the Americans. They were going after the Germans, so they\nwere bombing us. In the morning we got up and we didn\u2019t see nothing. It\u2019s very interesting that\nin that neighborhood it was nothing bombed, but my grandmother\u2019s sister\u2019s house. Only one\nhouse was completely bombed and that\u2019s... and everybody is gone from that family. Only there\nis the girl, who is in Hungary. That was that grandmother, that was that... her grandmother.\nOnly that house was bombed, to the ground, nothing else. And she was the only one survivor\nfrom the whole family. And she was holding onto me, me, me, me. She wasn\u2019t married. And\nshe survived, because her parents, when they saw what\u2019s happening, they put her in a factory,\nlike GE. They made electric, but they worked for the army, and people who worked for the\narmy, they didn\u2019t take them to the camps. They kept them in the factory until they finished the\nwork. In six months they were finished, then they throw them out to the streets. So then she\nstanding there, nobody, no parents and nobody, so what is she going to do? So she met her\naunt\u2019s maid. She was a very nice person and she knew somebody, a lady, whose husband was\nin... she was not Jewish and her husband was Jewish and he was in labor camp. He died, he\nnever came back. And that lady lived in a separate home. She had a house and she took in a few\nJewish people who didn\u2019t have where to go, who came out from the factory. And it was a doctor\namongst them. And my niece, my cousin was amongst them, whom she took in. And she was\nhiding them. And then the neighbors went and told on her, that she is buying too much food and\nshe\u2019s alone, that it\u2019s something going on there. And that was found, that she pulled away the\nbeds and all of them who were there, about eight people, they made a big, big hole in the ground\nand they slept every night, under the bed, in the ground.

        "A: Hiding? It was terrible, because I was... where we were hiding... no, the Germans weren\u2019t in\nthere, only in 1944... it was terrible. It was frightening, because I never knew that somebody\ncan grab me. And I was afraid to go during the day through the streets, and it was a terrible life,\nterrible. And I was very, very depressed. And they worked on me very hard, really, that I\nshouldn\u2019t commit suicide, because it was terrible. Then he didn\u2019t write to me, I don\u2019t know for\nhow long. My fianc\u00e9. So I didn\u2019t know what was going to happen. His parents were alive still\nand they lived in Eger, because they took away already the farm. So they lived with the\ndaughter. She had a very big house. A part of the house belonged to my husband, because that\nwas an inherited house. She inherited it. She went, can you imagine that she went to a convent\nto school, because that was the best school there. And she was the only Jewish girl. At that time\nshe was Jewish. And when she was 18 years old and she came out, she met that guy. She had a\nlot of Jewish doctors, who wanted to marry her. She met that guy, who was a gorgeous guy and\nhe had three kinds of doctorate, and he had a big, big job with the states. And he fell in love with\nher. And they were the biggest anti-Semites. His father... I told you that? His father left a will,\nthough his granddaughter was born already Christian, that his granddaughter cannot come to his\nfuneral. That kind of a man she married. And she was going to the Catholic Church and\neverything. And they lived together there. The parents had a separate part of the house and they\nlived together. But when everything was happening, he didn\u2019t save the parents. He saved his\nwife and the daughter, but he didn\u2019t save the parents, because he, himself, was an anti-Semite. I\nknow. I know, because he made once a remark, that I couldn\u2019t believe it. They had my stuff,\nbecause I left it by Christian friends. A lot of personal things. And when my husband was\ntransferred to Budapest, I told him where the stuff is and he took it away and sent it to the sister.\nSo whatever is saved, first they saved it, our friends, but then my sister-in-law saved it. So she\nhad everything what was my dowry, my jewelry and everything. So, he didn\u2019t want it, you\nknow, it was his. He didn\u2019t want to give it back to me. And they said they don\u2019t have it. And\none day they weren\u2019t home and I go to the closet and I pulled out everything what was mine.\nThat was the story. So it was terrible, terrible, really terrible. And I know that he made anti-\nSemitic remarks in front of me. And I know that he was an anti-Semite.",
        "A: No, he made remarks about my aunt, who was the loveliest, the best, best person in the world,\nmy aunt. And he said, \u201cThat Jewish woman,\u201d this way, about my aunt. I don\u2019t know what he\nsaid. Said this and that. This way to me, he is saying it about my aunt. And I always had a\nfeeling, because he was mad that my husband married me and not a Christian. He was, you\nknow? Until he met me, it took him I don\u2019t know how long, when I was once there for a\nweek...he took me a week. He took a chance, because he met my train and at that time already\nthey were looking for, not passports, but identifications. And he took a chance and he took me to\nmeet his parents. And him I met, I don\u2019t know. He lived in the same house. And it was a\nSunday when we went there and they came home from church, both of them. And he just, he\ncame to the window I remember. And he says, \u201cHello,\u201d through the window, you know? I know\nthat he was mad that he wants to marry me.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember. I went to my aunt many times, who had the 13-year-old boy, during the day.\nBecause they lived in an other borough. New Pest, and it was Rakospolota (ph), that was an\nother borough, they were, you know? And I walked. I remember I walked. I was afraid to go\nby the street cars that they ask for identification or something. And I walked. I walked a lot.\nAnd I walked to her house and I tried to spend with my cousin... he was a lovely, lovely boy.\nAnd I really don\u2019t know what I did the whole day. I know when I was away my grandmother\nwas very, very upset because she loved me and they were bombing during the day. And once I\nwasn\u2019t there during the bombing and I had to run to a pharmacy to... that was our friends. The\nwoman was my friend and the husband was a gynecologist. And I ran to the pharmacy and I got\nto their basement. When it was over I went home and my grandmother was out of her mind. She\nwas so upset. She wanted always hold my hands, always. And she almost died in my hands,\nbecause she lost her mind in the wagon, that\u2019s for sure. Because to say something like that, that\n\u201cWould you please comb my hair?\u201d She didn\u2019t know what\u2019s happening. And I didn\u2019t know\nwhat\u2019s happening, but I was very glad that she doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s happening. Such a smart\nwoman what she was. She didn\u2019t even wear glasses and was reading the paper every day. She\nknew about everything was going on in the world.",
        "A: Whatever they printed in Hungarian papers, but nothing else. And we knew. We didn\u2019t have\ncorrespondence with America. It stopped, so I couldn\u2019t even write to my uncle. Nothing.

And they lived in the Bronx. I know that. And his address\nwas always in my head, that I know, too. All the time. I wrote it in the dirt in Auschwitz, his\naddress, that I shouldn\u2019t forget it. In case, sometimes I can write to him. Because it was, it was\nan unbelievable thing in Auschwitz, that you knew that you cannot get out from here, never.\nAnd still something was dictating to you, don\u2019t forget that address. It was such a mixture, you\nknow? You knew that you are in a prison. That you cannot get out from here. And never, we\nnever see the end, never saw the end of it, that we can get out from there. And that woman, that\nRomanian woman, maybe she was a Gypsy, I don\u2019t know. She was dark complexion, who was\nreading there, too. They were reading palms. And I says, \u201cOkay, read my palms.\u201d One, it was\nbefore that, it was a private person when I went to. But that one, I went and says, \u201cDo it.\u201d And\nshe said, \u201cYou are going to get out from here, and when you are going to get out from here, you\nwill go for a very long trip overseas.

And she said, \u201cYou will have three children.\u201d And it was everything true. And\nyou shouldn\u2019t believe those things. And it was everything true, because I asked him, \u201cWere you\nin the hospital?\u201d And he says, \u201cYes, with terrible tonsillitis.\u201d In, near... no, it was already\nHungary at that time, 1n Romania, it was Hungary and there he was near Bucharest. They took it\nover, too. And he was in the hospital from the labor camp, because he had very high fever and\nthey put him in the hospital. So it was true.",
        "A: No. I didn\u2019t... I, well I saw him, I liked him, because he was very good looking and very\nlovable. But I was... until he threw it out, I was keeping the other guy\u2019s picture always in my\npocketbook. That was an interesting thing. Then when I found out that he is gone, then... but\nstill I had it. And once he found it and he was very jealous. And I says, \u201cDon\u2019t be jealous, he\u2019s\nnot alive anymore.\u201d But I don\u2019t know. You see, when I came back and I met him, and I knew\nthat he knew that I am alive. Because they knew I am alive. I told them, that they send to\neverywhere names from Bergen-Belsen. Eisenhower, the United States. So, he knew that I am\nalive. I didn\u2019t know he was alive. And it was a very, to me it was like a very strange thing, that I\nhave a husband, you know? I have to now get to know him. I was two weeks with him. He got\ntwo weeks furlough and he had to go back when we got married in 1944. February, when I was\n24 years old. We got married and after two weeks... everybody said to him, \u201cYou are absolutely\nout of your mind to get married in those times.\u201d But he didn\u2019t want to tell the whole story, that I\nneed another name.

I went with him about three weeks, when we got engaged and then they took him\naway. And he was madly in love with me. And I then I said, God, who knows whether he will\nstay with me? He will go through that. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen with me. He had\nhis parents still then.

        "A: False papers? No. I got the papers late. I have it here, Christian birth certificate. Because when\nhe came to the ghetto, I think somewhere it\u2019s there that a day before, when we were in the ghetto,\nand one day he comes to the ghetto and I almost fainted. I says, \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d He\nsaid, \u201cWe were just transferred to Budapest. The company was transferred to Budapest and I am\nnot with them because I am driving a horse and carriage. I am in a private house with the horse\nand you come right away with me and my sister is going to send you a Christian birth certificate\nand until then you are going to stay with me there.

But he didn\u2019t want to tell the whole story to everybody,\nthat I need another name to survive. We thought that I need another name to survive. And we\nfound a Justice of Peace, who, when I was 24 years old, that day, we got married, because before\nthen I couldn\u2019t get married. Only when you are 24 years old without father\u2019s consent. And they\nchanged my father\u2019s birth certificate to Romania, instead of Russia. And so he was covered.\nAnd he married us. And my aunt, we had two witnesses, one was a distant relative and I don\u2019t\neven know who was the other witness. I have to read it from the certificate. I don\u2019t know. And\nwe got married. And my aunt made a big dinner for the family. And they send us to the city, to\na very nice hotel. And we went to the hotel and I was just very, very afraid because they\nconstantly were checking on people and asking for their identifications. And especially at night\nwhen we went down to eat. And I says, \u201cI cannot swallow, I can\u2019t. I\u2019m so afraid here,\u201d so, but\nwe stayed there overnight. And next day we left and it wasn\u2019t too far away from my cousin\nwhere I met my father. That hotel wasn\u2019t too far away. And I remember that we went to that\ncousin, to his wife. He didn\u2019t know my husband. And they didn\u2019t come even to the wedding\nbecause it was in Budapest, that was in outskirts and they were already very bad times, so it was\nno traveling. So I introduced him. I spend there about, we spent a day there. And then we went\nback to my grandmother\u2019s house and we stayed there for two weeks, until he stayed there. And\nthen he left. And I stayed with my grandmother, later, not with my grandmother, but with my\naunt, because she had the much bigger house. So, we stayed with my aunt, not with my\ngrandmother when we stayed. It was with my aunt. And I stayed with my aunt, too.",

You will stay with us.\u201d And I stayed with them. Once I was\nvery, very sick, my pulse went up to 160. And they called their doctor. And the treatment was\nso different that time. I remember that I was in bed and they rented from a medical supply store\na big, big bottle what was full with ice-cold water and it had tubes in it. And that tube was put\non my chest, on my heart and the water was circulating in it. That was the treatment. And that\nwas... I thought it was a heart attack, because it didn\u2019t want to go out. For three weeks it didn\u2019t\ngo down, the pulse. And then I had another thing in 1942, that was terrible too. I had the\nappendix taken out and I couldn\u2019t have it done under my name. I didn\u2019t go to the hospital. And\nI went with my mother\u2019s, with my mother\u2019s oldest sister, whose son was in Siberia. And I went\nunder her name to the hospital. It was a private hospital. And the doctor was a private doctor,\nwho, he was a gynecologist. Because I was constantly complaining about pain and pain and pain\nand pain and he just couldn\u2019t find out what is it. And one day my husband was there visiting. It\nwasn\u2019t my husband at that time. And I just was like in two, I had such a pain. And his office\nwas in my, my grandmother, where my grandmother lived, in that house was his office. And I\nwent to him and I said, \u201cI tell you the diagnosis. I tell you what I have.\u201d He says, \u201cWhat, what\nare you talking about?\u201d I said, \u201cThat must be appendix.\u201d And he says, \u201cGod, you are right.\u201d\nAnd he took me to a private hospital to Budapest and they started to operate on me. And it was\nunder my aunt\u2019s name. I was Halas (ph). That\u2019s his grandson is Halas, who is in Canada. And I\nwent under that name. And the operation was so long, they didn\u2019t know what happened there,\nthat the doctors are running for more anesthesia. And my aunt is standing there and didn\u2019t know\nwhat happened. My appendix was completely, completely curled up with my colons and it was a\nvery, very long operation. And my heart, it was weak. They took me home by ambulance after.\nBut next morning, six o\u2019clock in the morning, the doctor is there. And he lived, that was in\nBudapest, in the city, the hospital. And we lived in New Pest, so it was a big distant. I says, \u201cI\nam so sick that you are here?\u201d He says, \u201cNo, no, don\u2019t worry. I just wanted to know how you\nfeel.\u201d Then I found out what was happening and they had to take me home by ambulance. And\nit was in \u201842. And in \u201844 I have an unusual big cut and that\u2019s how I went to Mengele. So I\nthought that that will matter when he sees that. But you know what was interesting? That I had\na friend, she was a woman, who had a mastectomy and she survived. And Mengele saw it and\nshe survived. So they were very odd things. And she came to Canada and she died in Canada.\nIt was a terrible thing. Her son is an engineer. He and my cousin, in Hungary, they went\ntogether to the... they started the engineering college together. Her son and my cousin, who is in\nCanada, that lady\u2019s son. And they lived in Montreal. And my cousin lived in Montreal at the\nbeginning. He went to McGill (ph) to finish his degree. And we went to visit her, the lady, and\nshe was alive for a few years. And once her son had to go to Paris, to France for business. I\ndon\u2019t know what kind of engineer is he, because mine is a chemical engineer. I don\u2019t know what\nkind of engineer he... and while he was away, she got the pneumonia and she died. They had to\ncall him home. She lived together with the son and with daughter-in-law. She married a\nHungarian girl. He wasn\u2019t Jewish. She was Jewish, the woman. Her husband wasn\u2019t Jewish, so\nthe son wasn\u2019t Jewish. So she married a Hungarian, non-Jewish girl, who was already in Canada\nat that ttme. And she spoke perfect French and she worked for the telephone company. Very\nnice person. We went there three times to visit her. And for longest time, they couldn\u2019t... he\nretired. They couldn\u2019t sell their house. And two years ago they wrote me a letter, \u201cFinally we\nsold the house and we moved to Kingston.\u201d It\u2019s Canada, but it\u2019s very close to the border. And\nit\u2019s a beautiful place. And they live there. They have two children. And he said, \u201cMy son\nmarried a French woman with a daughter.\u201d The son. A French woman, who has a daughter.\nAnd the girl, she was a, they wanted a child very badly and finally she became pregnant and she\nwas a premature baby. And she was very small, so they didn\u2019t know that she survive. She\nsurvived and she went to college and then she became the hostess on the Canadian Cruise Line,\nfor... I don\u2019t know how long she did it. They were always... every Christmas they write me and\nI write them. That\u2019s how I know about them. But when they lived in Montreal, they went, many\ntimes, my cousin and they were friends. But since that time, I know only from Christmas cards\nwhat is happening to them. And what\u2019s interesting, my cousin\u2019s son went to McGill, too. And\nthey live in Toronto. But they stayed there and he went to McGill. And he finished psychiatry.\nAnd he wants to... I don\u2019t know how they are doing it, it\u2019s not a bad idea... be a lawyer and a\npsych, psychologist, psychologist and a lawyer. So, he\u2019s going to law school in Kingston, where\nthey live now. You know. The father\u2019s friends. He\u2019s going to Kingston, to law school. It\u2019s\ninteresting.

But I know and I see with my eyes how they marched into\nBudapest and where they stopped in the middle where it is divided, the Danube divides the city,\nyou know? Into two parts. And they stop there, and right a way the Hungarian Army, right\naway, they went to greet them, and cater them, and did whatever they want even more. Because\nthey would never find out nothing if those countries wouldn\u2019t help them, what they occupied.\nBecause they, who, which German knew for instance, that my sister-in-law was married, that she\nwas once Jewish? Who knew it? Only the Hungarians who live there and they went and told on\nthem.

Otherwise how would the Germans\nknow whom to take, who was the rich man, whom to call to the department, to their offices,\nwhatever, and torture them? How would they know? Because they help them.

I don\u2019t even know whether I told George, because the last\ntime when my husband went to Hungary\u2014he went many times when he was retired\u2014he went to\nHungary because his sister was very sick for years and he said, \u201cI want to see my sister.\u201d But his\nexcuse was, because we had two little children buried there, he went to the grave. And I was\nsaying always, \u201cFrank, they are in our hearts, those are only stones.\u201d I couldn\u2019t say he wants to\nsee the grave. He wants to have it redone, the letters if they were in bad shape or whatever. But\nhis sister, he had that only sister and she was very, very sick, but her son-in-law was a doctor and\nhe kept him alive, her alive. And he was telling me, \u201cIf not me, she would be dead ten years\nago.\u201d I think she had cancer of the liver, because on the end they had to operate on her. And I\nsaw her, the last time I saw her, that summer in \u201989, and January she died. And we came back in\n1990, January. They had to... she became yellow and he couldn\u2019t help her anymore. But he was\ntelling me himself, if not me... because my niece was unbelievable. She called him from every\nmeeting and everywhere, \u201cCome right away because mother has fever,\u201d and right away the\ninjection. Unbelievable. She was a very good daughter. And I was surprised how he was\ntalking to him over the phone. I says, \u201cMarie,\u201d her name is Anna Maria, \u201ceverybody can hear\nyou.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t care. My mother comes first,\u201d and that kind of a thing. So, he kept her alive,\nreally. My husband went to see her every year, and that year when he went, in \u201882, in \u201881,\nFebruary, he had a heart attack, and he lived 17 months. And in \u201882, June, he says, \u201cI\u2019m going to\nsee my sister.\u201d And I spoke, I knew that three-quarter of his heart was gone. And I spoke to his\ndoctor, I says, \u201cWhat should I do? How shall I tell him that he cannot go?\u201d He says, \u201cYou know\nwhat, he can go. He has a doctor there. He will be safe. But he cannot go rowing around\nnowhere in Europe. He goes to one place and he can go. And June 13\" is his birthday, but I\ncalled him many times. But I called him on his birthday. I\u2019m sorry, June 17. He was born,\n1913, 17. And I called him and he says, \u201cI feel wonderful. I feel very good,\u201d and I always gave\nthe report to the doctor, because he was from the same hospital were I worked, the doctor. And\nhe says, \u201cYes, he has around him more sick people than he is, so he\u2019s feeling fine.\u201d\u2019 And he\ncame home and every first of July, we went out to the country house. They were there already,\nhere in 1979. And we met there and I spend one week vacation there, because Ilona was born\nthird of July. And we spend her birthday. And my husband came back end of June to spend the\nweek in the country for her birthday. And after that, we supposed to go to Canada, all of us by\ncar. And he said, \u201cYou know what? I came from a big trip. You go with them to Canada.\u201d And\nshe was pregnant with Anna that time. She was pregnant with Anna, Ilona. She knew that he\nwanted, because he always wanted children and the two died. He always wanted children, so at\nleast George should have more children. So she was pregnant with her, and we went to Canada.\nHe said, \u201cYou go to Canada and I go home.\u201d And he was alone, traveling home. And then I got\na call from him in Canada that please bring a present to one of my co-workers. I says, \u201cWhy to\nher?\u201d She says, \u201cBecause I was sick and she took me to the hospital.\u201d So we packed and we\ncame right back. He was a few days in Intensive Care or in Coronary Care, I don\u2019t know what\nhappened. He didn\u2019t feel well. And August 12, August 12\", he died. And I wasn\u2019t home. I\nwas working and after work I went to the dentist and I had to have a tooth pulled. And he was\nvery upset about that and he came with me. I went by bus. They had private buses, because I\nwent to the city periodontist. And he came to the door and he looked so beautiful. He had\nbrown pants and a yellow shirt on. And he said, \u201cNothing, nothing hurts me,\u201d because he had\nback trouble, too. He had a spine operation. He said, \u201cNothing, nothing hurts me.\u201d And you\nknow, you don\u2019t think if it\u2019s about your own, that the last day when you live, nothing will hurt\nyou. And that\u2019s true. But you just don\u2019t think. And I\u2019m so happy that he said it...\nEnd of Tape 3, Side A\nTape 3, Side B",

And they always, he and his sister lived always together and a niece and a\nhusband. So he belonged with them. I couldn\u2019t bring him, because only you could bring parents\nor sisters or brothers. So, he went with them because he lived with them and he had his son...\nit\u2019s not brother-in-law actually, because his husband... they had the parents there already, and\nthrough them.

But the closest was to me always Ilona, because when they took my mother and\nthey killed them in, my parents in 1941. So, she was the one who was unbelievably helping me.\nAnd then the last year, before the Nazis came in, she didn\u2019t let me go to hiding and she said,\n\u201cYou are our child, no matter what. You stay with us.\u201d And so for one year I was with them\nuntil they took us all. And after, when she survived and I survived and her husband survived, but\nnot her son. And my son was born. To my son she was like a grandmother. So when we left,\nwe left to Vienna and we left them in Hungary, but we knew that they are coming after us, three\nweeks. Because they had, they were elderly people already and they had visa to Israel and\nEngland and we knew that they are going to come. And the time came then we came to America\nand we left them there. And my son, he was so blaming me and he was so crying. How can I do\nit, to leave them there? He was nine years old. He was the only relative whom he knew. Like,\nshe took care of him when I had to go to work. Because under the communism we had to work.\nAnd she was everything to him. And my heart was going out and I was explaining to him,\n\u201cWhen we get to America and we become citizens we are going to bring...\u201d and that was the\nplan, that we are going to bring them over. But she died, unfortunately, from a gall bladder\noperation. But I think that she had already liver cancer, but they don\u2019t tell me, because nobody\ndies from a gall bladder operation. It must have gone to the liver and the operation was okay.\nShe was alive for a few days. And one day my uncle and his brother went to visit her. They\nwent every day, but one day when they went, she was dead. I didn\u2019t go, to the funeral. Because\nwe were here in \u201858 and that was in \u00b063 and in \u201859 I got a job in the hospital when I was working\nand I says, \u201cWe don\u2019t have either the money for the three of us to go,\u201d so we couldn\u2019t go. But it\nwas in the summertime and George was with some of our friends in the country. They were\nhaving a bungalow they rented and we went over on the weekends. We went to Poughkeepsie.\nAnd he was there and I was afraid to tell him. I was afraid to tell him. And he wrote to his\npediatrician in New York, who was the head of the Pediatrics in the hospital where I worked, and\nasked him to find out from me the truth, because he thinks that something is very wrong. And he\nshowed me the letter and he said, \u201cYou have to tell him.\u201d So, I was very, very upset to tell him.\nAnd I found it out, my husband did, he got the letter and he didn\u2019t want to tell me. And we are\ndriving out to the country and when he told me, we made an accident with the car. I was, you\nknow, so upset, we made... and it was an old car and we had the first car. It was a big Pontiac.\nBut somebody ran into us. It wasn\u2019t our fault, and he ran away. The guy ran away. But I was so\nupset that how I am going to tell him, because it was like the end of the world. He didn\u2019t know\nno one from the family and he was the kid of the family, because his brother, my uncle\u2019s brother\nlost his four-years-old child and the second wife never could have children. So he\u2019s named after\nmy, Ilika\u2019s son, he was George, too. And he was everybody\u2019s child, only child. And when I had\nthe other little boy, he was five months old when he died. I named him after the four-years-old,\nwho died. He was Paul, he was Paul, my little one, who died in one day from the croup.",
        "A: Three weeks later. She was, when we went to the barracks, she was put in the next barracks.\nBecause they put 60 people in one and she would be the 61. So she was put in the next barrack.\nBut when I came back from work, they didn\u2019t get food, those people who didn\u2019t work and I gave\nthem my half of the bread and I dressed them up. I\u2019m saying \u201cthem,\u201d she was there with one of\nher friends, who had two twin sons and they are alive. They went through all the... I told you\nthat, no?",

One is in high... he has, I don\u2019t know what kind of\nposition, but they are not men. They cannot get married, that\u2019s what they did to them. And I met\nthem when I was in 1976, I was in Israel. And that was one... we went to restaurant and my\nuncle\u2019s brother was there with his second wife, who is alive and she is in Vienna. She married\nhim when George was born, the second wife. And she was much younger than he was. He\nwanted children and she couldn\u2019t have children. When we went to the restaurant then, I didn\u2019t\nknow what\u2019s the surprise. My aunt\u2019s friend was there with her husband and she said she would\nnever forget it, what I did for them. Because they were naked. I was, but my aufseren (ph) and\nthe forewoman, she let me take out clothes, because I told her that my aunt is in the next camp.\nAnd she let me take out clothes. And I dressed them and I gave them food. And one day when\nMengele came to the camp and he was sorting out, because he came every week and sorting out\npeople. We had to get undressed and walk around him. He had a stick in his hand and he\u2019s\npointing one here, one there and I was one here. I knew I go back. And she was on the other\nside and I didn\u2019t know what happened to her. I thought she goes to gas. I didn\u2019t know about\nnothing else. And I knew that that\u2019s gas there. It turned out that they took her to Theresienstadt\nwith her friend. And they were working at an ammunitions factory and at night they stayed at\nTheresienstadt. And only when I went back, I knew that she is alive. And she was everything to\nme.",
        "A: I came, I think that\u2019s in it, when I came to our station, people were standing there and waiting for\npeople to come, because in whole Europe they were waiting for people to come because they\nknew who is alive, because Eisenhower... that I said, that he made a list from everybody and\nsend it to the places where they came from. So, they knew I am alive after liberation, but I didn\u2019t\nknow about no one. And when we got to our station, I saw there are many people and I didn\u2019t\nknow no one. I was shaking and I went to one of them and I says, \u201cExcuse me, do you know\nsomeone by the name of Eugene Schwartz?\u201d And he started to scream and he says, \u201cYou are\nEmilie?\u201d I says, \u201cHow do you know it?\u201d He says, \u201cYour uncle is waiting for you every day. He\nwas here today, too, but he had to go for some kind of a business.\u201d I says, \u201cBusiness?\u201d It was\nOctober fifth, \u00b045, and they were liberated in April already. And he says, \u201cI\u2019m going to phone\nhim.\u201d And I says, \u201cTelephones?\u201d You know. So, he came in ten minutes. \u201cHe has even a car,\u201d\nshe said, he said. And I knew that he doesn\u2019t drive. He had a chauffeur. They were very\nwealthy people before the war. And they started to pull themselves together. And he came and\nwe were just, we couldn\u2019t talk. We were crying and crying and crying. He loved me very much\nand he was just crying. And finally when we stopped crying, didn\u2019t stop, but we could talk, he\nsaid, \u201cYour aunt is alive, but not my son.\u201d But I knew that 13 years old wouldn\u2019t be alive. I had\none of my uncles, my mother\u2019s brother, that was the only man in the family, who was never\nmarried because my grandmother was 35 years old when she was a widow and left with five\nchildren.

My uncle\u2019s brother wasn\u2019t married. And they live,\nthey lived, before the war, it was a beautiful new house. And the two families, my uncle and his\nbrother lived in one house, two exact, the same apartments, the most modern. And the German\nsoldiers were in it when they came back and they ruined the whole house. So they had to re-do\nit. So, they lived next door, was my uncle\u2019s parents\u2019 house. And they lived... that was an older\nhouse, and they lived in that apartment in his parent\u2019s apartment, my uncle\u2019s. And then we\ncame, I came back, and my husband. I think it is there how I met my husband when I came\nback. Okay, so we stayed there, but only for a few days because it was no room for us. So we\nwent to Eger, to his sister, what is another city. It 1s about, I don\u2019t know how many miles away.\nIt was a very nice town. I knew that town before the war, because I went to visit his mother\nthere, his family, his mother and father, who lived already with his sister, who was converted.\nThat story is in there, no?",
        "A: Okay. His parents lived there. And part of the house was my husband\u2019s house, because that\nhouse was inherited. And there were other relatives there from that part of the family and they\nwanted the part of the house. And they shouldn\u2019t get it. My husband paid it out. So a part, it\nwas a very big house, it was his. So we had like a separate apartment, but together with them.\nThe kitchen was together, but we had two rooms and after the two rooms was the big dining\nroom what separated us. And in that apartment his parents lived, because they took away their\nfarms. They were big farmers, not in Eger, it was in another city, I mean village. And they took\naway everything from them. They took away, it\u2019s interesting, first the Romanians before, after\nthe first war, they took away, then the Russians took away. The Germans took away. So, they\nwent back and forth and on the end, the Germans. When the Germans took away, they had to\nleave. And they let them leave and they left to their sister and their daughter. And their son-in-\nlaw couldn\u2019t save them, but he saved his family, my sister-in-law and his daughter.",
        "A: Hope? No. After Auschwitz, no, but before Auschwitz, I thought that they must be somewhere\nalive. And when we went to Auschwitz I thought we go somewhere, where I\u2019m going to meet\nthem. I had no idea. I think I said it then, that once I went to a fortune teller, I said it, and they\nsaid that my parents are alive, but they are very far away. And it turned out that they were really\nalive when I found it out from the Museum. Because I thought after I came back that they were\nkilled right away in June, July, when they took them. August 24\" they were killed, according to\nthe Museum. And they showed me pictures and where they took them. And they knew about it.\n30, what did they say, 130? I don\u2019t know how many. How many people, one day they were\nkilled, because they were not only from Czechoslovakia, that part where we lived, but they were\nfrom Romania, what belonged once to Hungary, where Elie Wiesel comes from. They were\npeople from there, too. And they were there, too. So they were, I think, 38,000 in one day they\nkilled. Because they took them to Poland first, no, I know from them. And they didn\u2019t know\nwhat to do with them because all the Polish people were in the ghettos and they didn\u2019t know\nwhat to do with them. That\u2019s why they were killed.",

And he just\ndisappeared. And in 1948, he came back from Siberia. And when he came back and we met,\nthat was my first cousin, my mother\u2019s sister\u2019s son, and when he came back, he asked me, \u201cWhere\nare your parents? What happened to your parents?\u201d And I was telling him that I have no idea. I\ngot a card from my sister from Kamenetz Podolski (ph) and she\u2019s writing, \u201cWe are here.

And how, I don\u2019t know\nup to today, how he was riding a horse and carriage, and he was there, he said. He saved a lot of\npeople. He put them under the hay. He had no idea that my parents were there. That was the\nfirst when I knew how they were killed, in 1948. And I was back 1945 already from\nconcentration camp. And I still didn\u2019t know what was happening.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t know where. We became right away communists. In 1948 we were communists. I\ndidn\u2019t know where to ask, no idea. And George was born in 1946 and my mind was... I am not\nsaying that I was happy, but you know, I was happy that I have a family. I always wanted a\nfamily and I never knew that I can have a family. I never knew that I can have a child anymore,\nso I was very happy that I had a child. And I never knew. Never, and I didn\u2019t come with no one.\nBecause a lot of people I met from my, from the place where they were home when they took my\nparents. I have in Brooklyn two friends, only two, who knew my parents, in this whole world,\nonly two. Those people knew my parents and my sister. And they knew what was happening to\nthe non-citizens. Because we were not citizens that time. We were Czech citizens, but the\nHungarians took it over, so We were now citizens. And those people were Hungarians. I don\u2019t\nknow, yes, they were Hungarians. Hungarians. They weren\u2019t Russians. They took only the\nRussians, no other citizens. And so they knew that they took them somewhere, but they didn\u2019t\nknow why, because I was questioning them in Brooklyn. I said, \u201cDid you know what happened\nto them?\u201d They said they never knew what happened to them, they just knew that the transport\nwent and never came back.",

And we were young people, so it was impossible. And\nthen in \u201849, I had the other boy, so I didn\u2019t even think about it that we should go anyplace, to try.\nAnd we didn\u2019t have a bad life until it was really communism. Because I had a maid, sleep-in\nmaid. I didn\u2019t have to work. And in 1948 when it was really communism, I had to let her go, the\ngirl, and I had to go to work. Because everybody had to show what they are living from, because\nmy husband was in private business and he couldn\u2019t show how much he is making. And he\nmade nice money.

They bother us in one way: that we\nhad a big apartment. Because when my aunt\u2019s apartment was ready, they renovated it, we\nmoved in, in the old apartment and it was a very big one. I mean large rooms, there were three\nlarge rooms. And actually the fourth one was a room, too, the foyer, because we had furniture in\nthere. And we had a kitchen and bathroom and we had a room for the maid from the kitchen.\nAnd the third room was a very big, it was so big that George when he was little, he could bicycle\ninit. That was his room. And they took away from us that room. You know? And they made\nan apartment from it, a one-bedroom apartment. And they put in a family, only with one son. A\nfamily with one son. It was so big that they made kitchen, bedroom, bathroom... I don\u2019t know, I\nnever went in, what is it. They were our neighbors. But otherwise, we didn\u2019t have trouble.\nThey took away the business of my uncle. He had 40 pairs of horses and two big trucks.

But with the horses, too, they were\nrenting it or whatever, to companies. And very, very big business. 40 pairs. And when it\nhappened, they took my husband and he worked for them. He loved horses, that was his life, the\nhorses, horseback riding actually. He loved it. And so he worked for them. But then they took\naway the business from them, from my uncle, so he had to... they didn\u2019t work anymore because\nthey were elderly people.

        "A: Ya, and on the end of one of the beds, on the end was, the picture, they were all looking in the\ncamera because it was after the war, and it was marked, Elie Wiesel. And on the other side there\nwere three men, between them, it was my uncle. I recognized him. It was my mother\u2019s brother.",
        "A: Joseph. And when Elie Wiesel was here about, that\u2019s now four, five... Ilona was a senior, that\u2019s\nfour years ago. Four years ago, he was here in Lexington and he had a wonderful, wonderful\nspeech. It was the Jewish Federation and the UK, they did it together. And it was in UK, in the\nMemorial Hall. Before that, they had a dinner in the club, but it was 150 dollars a plate, and I\ndidn\u2019t have 150 dollars for a dinner. And people were coming out and they were telling him\nwhat a wonderful thing it was just to shake hands with him. And I was very upset that I know\nthat man from my co-worker, who was a very good friend, her father was very good friend, her\nhusband, of Elie Wiesel and I couldn\u2019t see him. I couldn\u2019t talk to him. So when it was\neverything over, Ana was telling me, \u201cWait, wait, maybe you can see it, go to his dressing\nroom.\u201d So, a gentleman was standing there from UK, they didn\u2019t let nobody to see him. And I\nwent there. It was the rabbi\u2019s wife, that time, Rabbi Slaten\u2019s (ph) wife, and she was talking for\nme. And she says, \u201cWould you let that lady in only for a few minutes? She is the only survivor\nhere in Lexington and she would like to talk to him, only for a few minutes.\u201d So he says, \u201cYes, I\nwill do it, but she has to wait until the hall is empty, because if people see somebody\u2019s going,\nthey want to go, too.\u201d So, I was waiting, I says, \u201cI gladly wait.\u201d So, I was waiting and he helped\nme down the steps, because they were wooden steps in the basement. It was the... I couldn\u2019t\nbelieve it. He says, \u201cYes, we are hiding people.\u201d [Laughing.] And it was nothing to hold onto\nand they were wooden steps and he was helping me to go down. And suddenly I came and the\ndoor is open and he\u2019s standing there. He was a very, very attractive man. And my heart was\nbeating, that I couldn\u2019t say nothing, so I says, \u201cHello.\u201d He was very friendly. I says, \u201cHello.\u201d\nHe says, \u201cWho are you?\u201d I didn\u2019t say even my name, I was so excited. I says, \u201cI am a Holocaust\nsurvivor and I am the only one here.\u201d He says, \u201cIf you are a Holocaust survivor, you must be\nfrom Europe.\u201d I says, \u201cYes.\u201d He says, \u201cWhere are you from?\u201d I says, \u201cBudapest.\u201d He says,\n\u201cBudapest?\u201d And he starts to talk to me, Hungarian. I couldn\u2019t believe it. I said, \u201cYou speak\nstill Hungarian?\u201d Because he didn\u2019t, I mean, I don\u2019t know where he learned, because where he\nwas, they were very religious people, his parents. And I think they spoke Yiddish and not\nHungarian, but he spoke Hungarian. And he was 15 years old, maybe in school, correct, in\nschool, probably he learned. He spoke wonderful. And he says, \u201cNo, I can, because I have no\none to talk to.\u201d His wife is French. I says, \u201cDon\u2019t tell me, you speak Hungarian.\u201d And from\nthen on he spoke Hungarian to me. And he asked me where I know him from. And I mentioned\nhis friend\u2019s name. And he says, \u201cKorman! (ph)\u201d He says, \u201cI saw him last week!\u201d That\u2019s what\nhe\u2019s telling me. I says, \u201cYes, because of you he didn\u2019t want to retire to Florida, because he was\noften...\u201d he lives in New York, actually, and teaches in Boston. And they had from that part of\nthe town, Sighet (ph), they had an organization. And that my friend\u2019s husband went always there\nbecause he loved him. And she then was telling me what went on in that organization and what\nhappened at that organization [laughing] when they were together, so I knew a lot about him.\nAnd I was telling it to him. He says, \u201cBecause of you, he didn\u2019t want to move to Florida.\u201d He\nsays, \u201cYou know what? I saw him in Florida.\u201d When he was down in Florida, he saw him. So\nhe was very nice, and then he says, what I am doing, and I told him that I am talking in schools,\nand he says, \u201cWonderful.\u201d He says, \u201cWhat grade are you starting?\u201d I says, \u201cSixth.\u201d He says,\n\u201cThat\u2019s the right grade to start, don\u2019t do younger ones.\u201d But I did, because they were begging\nme. Lexington School for five graders. Ana went to SCAPA, they were four graders. They\nwere begging me, especially in SCAPA, they were very smart kids. And here too, in Lexington\nSchool, they are very, very... I spoke twice already there. And now I, the teacher was always\nasking me whether I know a book for children. I am reading now in a magazine that he, Elie\nWiesel, wrote his first children\u2019s book about the Holocaust with pictures. So, I try to get that\nbook and I try to call that teacher in Lexington School, because she 1s very intelligent. She is\nteaching fifth graders. And they understood it. What kind of letters I got from them, from the\nfifth... I just cannot believe it, how they understood it and how sorry they are for me. And they\ncannot believe it, that I lived through that. Fifth graders. So I tell you the truth, that I spoke\nabout 150, 160 times since Iam here. That if I cannot do it, because I will be the most\nunhappiest person in the world, because I feel the commitment that I have to do it. I still have to\ndo it, because there are many, many people, who don\u2019t know it still and those are adults, mostly\nadults. The children are starting to know me in schools, because I go back always, because they\nare different classes, and most of them they know. In the colleges, too. I was all over in every\ncollege, Berea, Midway, and the private college, Transylvania, twice, UK three times.\nCommunity college. So, they know all ready. But the adults, lot of adults, in churches, they\ndon\u2019t know. So, I will be really... and even if they call me to schools, next graders who didn\u2019t\nhear me and I cannot do it, I am depressed and I always think about it. That it give me... I\ncannot explain it, when I talk, I am very enthusiastic and I live it through again. That\u2019s true.\nAnd I have to take a tranquilizer, I must take before I go. And I never spoke about my parents,\nbecause I couldn\u2019t. I was always crying. And lately I am even showing the pictures of my\nparents. And if they give me enough time to tell them that story on the end, I am including it,\nwhat happened to them and I am showing their pictures. And I was so relieved that I did it.\nOkay, I didn\u2019t sleep at night, but I was relieved that I did something good for them who died.\nYou know? I took it in my head that they died and they won\u2019t be at peace until the last survivor\nis going to tell their story. It\u2019s... I cannot explain it, what happened to me, because I never\nspoke. I never spoke.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t speak, even in New York, never. New York, I didn\u2019t have to, because there were so\nmany, I never heard denial. And here I started only because I heard denial. In Hungary I never\nspoke about it because the Hungarians are very anti-Semitic. And they told you that \u201cToo many\nof you came back.\u201d It\u2019s a Catholic country. I am not saying that the intelligent people, but I\nheard it from people saying it. So, in Hungary, I even went to a doctor, I wanted to take off my\nnumber because it was so uncomfortable when I was holding onto the train. I went to the city. I\nworked for the book publishers, you know, the dictionaries. And that\u2019s where they were telling,\nthey were looking at those numbers like, \u201cI would kill you,\u201d you know? Maybe it was in me that\nI thought it, but no. Even today, even I told you, I was in 1978, in Hungary with Ilona... 1978?\nWhat am I talking about? She was born in 1970. 1989 I was with her. I told you that story, no?\nAnd we lived there for months?",
        "A: We lived, my sister-in-law was still alive at that time, my husband\u2019s sister and she took an\napartment for us, because they had only a one bedroom apartment. A very beautiful place. And\nhe took us for an apartment, a rental, close to them. And it was a woman, whose husband was a\nschool principal, but they were divorced. And she had a son, an engineer and he didn\u2019t live\nhome and she had three rooms, two bedrooms and a living room. One bedroom was separate and\nthen she had a room in Bolotow (ph), near Lake Bolotow (ph), that she went there. If she rented\nthe apartment she went there, that she shouldn\u2019t be home. But we were always begging her, that\nit doesn\u2019t bother us, she should stay home. Because she was the only person who spoke English\nand Ilona could spoke to her English. She was the only person. And she worked for the... she\nwas babysitting in the Canadian Embassy for somebody. So, she spoke English well. We were\nglad when she stayed home and when she stayed home she went down and she brought us\nalways fresh bread and milk, and she was very nice to us. We didn\u2019t speak about religion,\nabsolutely. And the last day, the last day before we left, she came to me and she said, \u201cI didn\u2019t\nsleep the whole night.\u201d I says, \u201cWhy?\u201d She says, \u201cBecause I just find out, I just notice your\nnumber that you are Jewish and I am Jewish, too. Nobody knows it in the house.\u201d In 1989,\nnobody knows it in the house. \u201cThey are suspicious,\u201d she said. But her husband, I don\u2019t know.\nI don\u2019t remember already her name. But it was a Hungarian name. But he changed his name\nbecause it was a Jewish name. He changed it when he was a school principal. And once, she\nwas telling that she was here in America in Los Angeles for a month and she\u2019s mentioning a\nname, who invited her. And I knew them, those people, that they were Jewish people. In New\nPest, you know? But still I just didn\u2019t realize it that she\u2019s Jewish. And she wouldn\u2019t ask me and\nI wouldn\u2019t ask her. But one day, she wasn\u2019t home and I see... I took the mail, and a letter came\nfrom Israel. And when I gave it to her, she right away put it in her pocket. Because she knew\nthat my sister-in-law was converted and married to a non-Jew and she got that apartment and she\nthought we are not Jewish. She was afraid to say that she is Jewish. So then... it was\nunbelievable. And when we came home, I sent her some nylon panty hose because she couldn\u2019t\nget it. And for two or three years I was writing her. And I didn\u2019t realize it, she said, \u201cI\nmentioned to you so many times who took me, who took me, who invited me...\u201d and her son\nwas there too. I don\u2019t know how long he was in Los Angeles, in California. And I didn\u2019t realize\nit, he went out once with that man, but he was married. And both of them, he and the wife,\ninvited her, but I didn\u2019t... you know? [Laughing.] I didn\u2019t know him personally. But I knew,\nand I knew his name, those people who were in Los Angeles.",
        "A: So that\u2019s the situation, and even today, they are hiding people, they are Jews. They are... it\u2019s no\ngood, it\u2019s still no good in Hungary. Under the communism, it was no Jew, we couldn\u2019t say, no\nreligion. They were forcing us to work. A Jewish boss, he was forcing us to work on the Jewish\nholidays and he was a lawyer. And one day, I thought it? I said it? --One day... his secretary\nwas a very nice person. She was Jewish, too. But many people worked there, they were all\nintellectuals, because they were... whatever we had intellectually, if it\u2019s something medical, the\ndoctors that were there and engineers or whatever. It\u2019s very interesting. And he, on the biggest\nholiday, Yom Kippur, he called us to his office, me and his secretary and he made us eat. He\nwas in the Party, the Communist Party because of his job. But who saw it? Why did he have to\ndo it? I couldn\u2019t go to the synagogue, so I went home by bus, I remember. Because it was, we\nlived in New Pest and that was in mid-town. We were passing the street where the synagogue 1s,\nI jumped off the bus at that station and after work I went to the synagogue. And in the\nconcentration camp I didn\u2019t know that it\u2019s holiday or not holiday, but the Polish people knew it.\nAnd they were telling us when it\u2019s Yom Kippur. They knew it from outside the world. Because\npeople who went to work outside, they somehow got in touch with Polish people. And then they\nsaid that tomorrow is like Yom Kippur, so I didn\u2019t eat. I was used not to eat, because eat, the\nfood was only bread when we got off from the work, you know? I was fasting there and I go\nback and I have to eat.",
        "A: At the camp? I lost my faith.",
        "A: In camp, I was always saying, \u201cWhere is God? Where is God,\u201d when I found out what is going\non in camp, that they killed all the little kids. And I says, \u201cWhere is God that he let, that he let it\ndo those people? Where is God? Is ita God?\u201d I absolutely didn\u2019t believe it. I just... I was\nsaying that too, always, that I was, at night when we couldn\u2019t go out after work, when we were\nalready inside, but if we had the chairs just to look outside and look at the stars. And I was\nunbelievable homesick, unbelievable. And I was just always saying, I says, \u201cMy God,\u201d \u2014\u2018my\nGod\u2019 I didn\u2019t say. I just said, \u201cDoes Frank,\u201d Frank was my husband, \u201csee the same stars what\nI\u2019m seeing?\u201d Terrible homesick, and never, never thought that I can survive from there. Never.\nIt was so impossible, you know? It was impossible. First of all, I didn\u2019t know where is\nAuschwitz. I didn\u2019t know that we are close to Krakow, we are in Poland. I knew that we were in\nPoland, but I had no idea where we were. And I never thought that 1t can happen, that the\nRussians are going to liberate it and we have to go.",
        "A: Oh, no. After the war, no, after the war, we lived under communism and we went to synagogue\nsecretly. And it was a, a nursery, a preschool in the synagogue, and George went there. But it\nwas everything secretly. When he went to school he had no religion. He wasn\u2019t allowed to say\nthat he has religion. No religion. When we went to Vienna, for 17 months we lived there. He\nwas the only Jewish kid there. And they were suspicious because they were praying every\nmorning. And once the teacher called me, \u201cWhy does he doesn\u2019t pray?\u201d I said, \u201cBecause he has\nno religion. We lived under communism, that\u2019s why he doesn\u2019t pray.\u201d And every day I was\ndying until he came home from school. I was so afraid what\u2019s going to happen, that they find\nout that he\u2019s Jewish. It was terrible, terrible. Hitler came from Vienna. I told you that. That\neven in 1957, when we went to Vienna, the workers, when they worked, they started with a\nbottle of beer and \u201cHeil Hitler.\u201d",
        "A: No. When I went back and I found IIlie, Ilona, when I find her and I find her husband, her\nhusband, they weren\u2019t, they weren\u2019t religious. They were religious and not religious. We didn\u2019t\nhave nothing to eat. So my sister-in-law managed to buy every year a... she was close to the\ncountryside and everybody knew them there where they lived. Her husband had a very big\nposition with the state. And he, himself, was an anti-Semite, my sister-in-law\u2019s husband. It\u2019s\nunbelievable. I was telling you about it. Okay. But they managed, somehow, I don\u2019t know\nhow... we got every year a pig. Pig! So, and it was a butcher, who came to the house, and they\nmade for us and for Ilona, for them... my uncle wasn\u2019t alive at that time, Joseph. Because he\nwas very religious, you wouldn\u2019t believe it that he went with a little prayer book to Buchenwald\nand he managed to bring it back with him. Because that time already, they weren\u2019t killing there,\nin Buchenwald, when he got there. And he brought it back. He was very religious. That\u2019s why\nhe stayed with us, and not with Illie, Ilona, because of the pork. But we ate the pork, too. We\nhad it, too. Especially when he died, it was... we ate it because there was nothing else, and we\nhad food for the whole year. George doesn\u2019t know it. He doesn\u2019t remember it, so I am not\ntelling it to him. And I am not telling it even to the grandchildren. Ana is crazy when she would\nhear it. She\u2019s watching always what you are ordering. She is... yeah. But he was the president\nof the synagogue, my uncle, and he was helping many, many Jewish, young boys to go to Israel.\nThat time it was secret. Secretly, they went through Czechoslovakia. So, that way he was\nreligious, but, you know? But we couldn\u2019t show it that we were religious or not religious. But\nwe ate pork. But I got back my religion. I got my belief. I got it back slowly, slowly I got it\nback. I was always thinking about my mother, how he taught us, she taught us to pray in\nCzechoslovakia. And when we went to the synagogue like Friday night or something, I was\nalways thinking about it, how we were crying, but every week we had to read one more page.\nAnd it was so hard for us, myself and my sister. And I was thinking about them. And as I was\nthinking about them always, you know, I got back my religion. And especially when I came to\nAmerica. When I came to America and my uncle was... he wasn\u2019t, he ate everything. I\u2019m not\nsaying that they didn\u2019t cook pork, but he was religious. And I remember him and my father\nwhen they were together and Passover, when they were together. And every Saturday they went\nto the synagogue and then they came to us and they were singing after lunch those songs that you\nare supposed to. And when I thought about those things it came back to me, you know? It\u2019s\nvery interesting. And now I love to go to the synagogue, and I am so heartbroken. I wasn\u2019t there\nnow three weeks, I think. I am missing it. And I\u2019m missing it. We don\u2019t have a rabbi now. He\nleft. I loved him. It\u2019s interesting that he\u2019s near Cincinnati and Ilona was teaching here Sunday\nschool art for four years. And now he\u2019s teaching in his new... she goes down to the new\ncongregation and she\u2019s teaching, but only twice a month because it\u2019s 40 miles away. So, and\nit\u2019s, but... she sees him. And I cannot see them. I was very good friends with... she\u2019s a very\nyoung woman. His wife is from Cincinnati. He\u2019s from Minnesota, the rabbi. And his parents\nwere Czechoslovakians, Czechs. His father, I met his father many times, he\u2019s an optometrist.\nWhen he came visit he still speak Czech.",

        "A: Conservative. Slaten. He has three sons and he was here 11 years. My grandson was the first\nBar Mitzvah with him.",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t get no answer because I knew what was happening. I didn\u2019t get no answer. But I\nwas just always questioning, \u201cWhere is God? Is there a God,\u201d that\u2019s what I was saying. \u201cIs\nthere a God, does he see what\u2019s happening? Why, why is it happening?\u201d",
        "A: Yes lam. Why did it happen, actually? Why did it happen? For those innocent little kids, what\ncould they do? What kind of sins they had? Babies. What kind of sins they had that it\nhappened? And then I am going back to Spanish Inquisition. [Laughing.] So what was there?\nThey killed the Jews all over. Always. The Jews are always the [laughing]... for everywhere\nand everything they are blaming the Jews. So, it\u2019s no answer. It\u2019s no answer. First the Blacks\ncame and after that the Jews. Some places they... when they are no Blacks, there are no Blacks,\nthen there are the Jews the first who are blamed for everything. Why? Does anybody knows\nwhy\u201d? I lived under democracy in Czechoslovakia. It was a real, real democracy. Nobody\nknows what\u2019s democracy. Only if somebody lived under that time Masaryk and Benes. They\nalways said, \u201cWe cannot be anti-Semitic, never. Because we have the brain, and we are\nbusinessmen and we are everything what the Jews are.\u201d So I was thinking about it, that it\u2019s\njealousy. It was jealousy from Hitler that they, he took it from... they were supporting him, the\nJews in Germany. They made him big. And then when he knew what they are doing and why,\nthen they killed them and he wanted to have it. Why are they anti, I don\u2019t know, anti-Semitic\nhere, I don\u2019t know. I never heard it from no one, but I can imagine that the Southern Baptist are\nanti-Semitic. I am thinking it only because I was invited [laughing] to every church, every\ndenomination, but never to a Baptist church. So it must be something against the Jews. They\nwon\u2019t say it to your face, but it must be. They know it. They saw me in the paper. They know\nit. And I was never, never, and I was on every Christian church. What is that? How do you call\nit? What is it? And I\u2019m telling it to the children. I\u2019m finishing my speech, and I\u2019m saying it to\nthem that why I am doing it, I\u2019m doing it that you should learn not to hate and you should teach\nyour parents not to hate, because I don\u2019t think so that a little kid knows what is to hate. It\u2019s\ncoming from somewhere, from the adults. Correct?",

And what was discussed, what wasn\u2019t discussed, I don\u2019t know between them, but when\nNixon left, next day, it was the Uprising. The students, the college students, they took over the\nradio station. That was the first. We didn\u2019t have televisions. That was the first. And the\nRussians actually never left Hungary and they were all over scattered in the woods and around.\nBut we didn\u2019t see them in the cities, but they were there. And it was communism. And Nixon\nwas telling them, \u201cDo it.\u201d\u201d How do we know that? Because the last Prime minister, Nagy, Imre\nNagy, who was killed by the Russians. He was on the radio and he was begging, he was begging\nAmerica and he was begging Nixon, he was telling him, \u201cOkay, do it.\u201d He thought that we get\nsome help.

        "A: ...the apartment that we lived in Budapest, yes. We lived there. And so when they came in in\n19... no that was 1956, the uprising. Up to that point it was all right. We worked and we were\ncommunist, but we worked. I mean, the wealthy people were very afraid and we were very\nafraid with my uncle, that they are going to take them. Because they came at night. They\nknocked on the doors, and taked people on they, on their cars, on their... the Russians, with\nmachine guns. And they took them to villages, and they took them to villages and they left them.\nThere were certain villages where they were designated where they took the wealthy people.\nAnd they couldn\u2019t come back to Budapest. But thank God, thank God it never happened.\nBecause that was against... again, it was somebody had to tell them who are the wealthy people.\nAnd they were in very good friendship with everybody from the higher-ups there. Because that\nwas a borough, New Pest, where we lived. And like New York has five boroughs, the same\nthing Budapest has. And so they knew everybody, and they were friends with everybody, and so\nnobody told on them, so they weren\u2019t taken away. Their business was taken away, but they\ndidn\u2019t. They weren\u2019t taken away. What was done to them, they had to move together, the two\nfamilies, in one apartment, because it was too big for two people. Gorgeous apartment. House.\nAnd they took away they apartment and they had to live together, the sister-in-laws and brother-\nin-law, two brothers. And they had to rent the upstairs apartment. They decided that they\u2019d take\nthe first floor and the second floor, it was a doctor, a gynecologist with his family. But they\ndidn\u2019t take them out. And from that, that they take out many wealthy people, many wealthy\npeople married non-Jews, but not that non-Jews, but it wasn\u2019t a match. Just only because those\npeople were giving them stay, somewhere to stay. Because it is an example, my cousin, I have a\nsecond cousin in Budapest, my mother and her mother were sisters, cousins. I\u2019m sorry, first\ncousins. And she is the only one who survived from that family, nobody. She had two uncles\nand the grandmothers were sisters, my grandmother and her grandmother were sisters and that\u2019s\nhow the mothers were first cousins, my mother and her mother. And she was an only child and\nthe only survivor. She survived. Her parents put her in a factory. I didn\u2019t tell you all that? I\ndon\u2019t know. To a factory where they were making like General Electric. They were making\nlight bulbs. It was Tungsraum (ph), it was a very well known company. I think, in fact, now\nafter the war, they are together, Tungsraum and General Electric. Something, I don\u2019t know. But\nyoung girls, they worked there. And when they took her parents, she was working there and they\nslept there and everything. So they worked for the army and when they finished with the work,\nwhen the work was finished, they let them go. But they didn\u2019t have where to go, because they\nwere, nobody was there already, we were all gone. And that\u2019s... I think I, somewhere I said that\nstory, that she was hiding. One of her aunts had a maid and she recommended where to go, to a\nwoman, who was non-Jewish and her husband was Jewish and he was in labor camp. And she\nhad a house. And she took in about eight people, Jewish people. It was a doctor, it was my\ncousins and her boyfriend and I don\u2019t know, about eight people. And she was hiding them. I\ntold that story?",
        "A: You did mention that story.",
        "A: ... 1956, okay. They came in with their tanks and they were horrible. They were raping girls, the\nsoldiers, the Russian soldiers.",
        "A: No, no, but we were very worried, because we had a maid at that time. We were very close to\nher. And it was terrible. I remember that it was George\u2019s birthday and he wanted a car. Before\nthat he knew what he wants in the toy store and we went, we went there and stood on line to get\nhim the car. And the tanks were turned towards us. The end was so close to us. Every minute,\nor when we are standing for bread, the tanks were turned always to shoot us. It was terrible.\nThen, one day, I don\u2019t know what happened... not one day, they did it many times. But they\nwere very close to us and they were shooting during the night. And we were in the apartment\nand basements were on the other side of the building, the basements, and we had to run to the\nother side with the children. I had at that time my cousin\u2019s, who was in Russia, his two\ndaughters. They were with us because they went somewhere for vacation and it happened under\nthe vacation. And they lived far, very far from us. They lived in Buda, what was very far from\nus and they couldn\u2019t pick up the children. And they stayed with us, two little girls. We had to go\nto the basement because they were shelling in the backyard. Terrible. I don\u2019t know how many\nnights we spent in the basement. When it stopped, when they already were in control, I don\u2019t\nknow how long it took them. It took them a long time, and they were in control. Then Austria\nopened the borders, their borders and people who lived close, they could just walk over to\nAustria. And thousands and thousands, and mostly the peasants, because they were all farmlands\naround the border, you know? They went all over to Austria and in Austria they put up camps\nfor them and America was sending money for it. We were far away, we couldn\u2019t go, because we\nwere 400 miles away from the border, in Budapest. So we couldn\u2019t go. That story is in. How\ndid I get out, and the Russians. That\u2019s in.",
        "A: He was a stranger to me 1n that way, that I knew him for three weeks, when he wanted to marry\nme. And then he couldn\u2019t marry me because I was underage. And then they took him in labor\ncamp. He was away, and I don\u2019t know, a few times he wrote me cards. But I didn\u2019t know\nwhat\u2019s going to happen, whether he stays with me whether he will wait for me. And he was four\nyears in labor camps, so I didn\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen. But I really... that\u2019s why I say\nthat I really didn\u2019t know him. I told you about the other boy, whom I went with somebody for\nfour years. So, I was very mixed up. I was very mixed up. I don\u2019t know whether I fell in love\nwith my husband right away. But my heart was broken when the other one find out and then\nwrote me a letter, \u201cWhy did I do it?\u201d If he would know that I need a name, he would marry me\nright away. And... but it was late already, everything was arranged that he fell in love with me,\nmy husband. So... he was seven years older, and I knew he was very good looking. And I knew\nwho was the family, first of all, because my aunt and his aunt were very good friends. So, I\nknew the family from my own... and I didn\u2019t know what\u2019s going to be, and when I met him, you\nknow, when we came back, I was terribly crying and he was crying, too. But he knew I\u2019m alive.\nHe knew, because he knew months ago already when they got the notice. But he was waiting for\nme. But I wasn\u2019t sure whether he has somebody in between or not, though we got married. We\nwere married in 1944, in February, when we got married. For two weeks we were together and\nthat was that. And I was always, you know, afraid that they are going to take me still. I am\nmarried, but we went to a hotel, I remember on the marriage night. It was unbelievable. We\nwent down to eat. It was in the city, a beautiful hotel. And everybody constantly was afraid that\nthey are coming and asking for identification and that kind of a thing. It was horrible. So I said,\n\u201cLet\u2019s check out. I don\u2019t want to stay here.\u201d We went back. We went back, and we stayed with\nmy grandmother, and then we stayed with Ilika, too, with Ilona. I[lika is a, in Hungarian, I don\u2019t\nknow what it is in any language. If somebody has a name, they make it like softer. Ilika is softer\nthan Ilona. You know? But that\u2019s from Ilona, so we called her Ilika. And I was Milika, my\nname was Millie, I mean my nickname is Millie. Nobody knew me as Emilie, only in school,\nand at work. But otherwise, the whole family and my friends... and then we came to America, I\ndidn\u2019t know that it\u2019s an American name, too. And I never mentioned it. It was always Emilie\nand that was it. But my friends are still calling me Millie on the phone and my cousin and\neverybody is calling me. I have a cousin in Canada. My cousin who was eight years in Siberia,\nseven years, from \u201841 to \u201848. He hasason. And he escaped after \u201856, they sent him, the parents.\nHe went to University at that time already, two years as an engineer. And he was, when he came\nback he was a communist. He wasn\u2019t a communist, he was in the party and because of that, that\nhe was in Russia and spoke already Russian, he got a very big job in the Ministry. He was... as\nan engineer. He knew that he never can come to America, because he was in the Communist\nParty. So when it was finished, the communism, when the... I mean, when they opened the\nborders, he sent his son alone to Vienna. But he had to go to Israel, because the plan was that the\nparents are going to come after him to Israel. They knew that he cannot come to America. We\nweren\u2019t here. And so he went alone to Israel, but the mother had there a lot of friends, his\nmother, and he stayed with the friends. And he went to the Israeli Army and he was an officer,\ntoo. And the parents went after him, they got passport. Parents and two sisters, who were born\nafter he came home, the two sisters. But he escaped with his mother\u2019s mother\u2014grandmother,\ngrandfather and he\u2014they escaped the middle of Budapest. I don\u2019t know whether you heard\nabout Wallenberg, that Swedish man? He was hiding them. He was from that group and his\nmother, and his grandmother and grandfather. Grandmother. Grandfather died before they went\nto Israel. The grandmother went with them to Israel and she died in Israel. My cousin went with\nthem. I mean of course he went with them. He died in Israel. And it is very interesting that his\nfather was in the First World War and he got... he was in Siberia, too, his father. And he got a\nnerve disease, nerves. It was terrible. I remember him very well. That was my mother\u2019s sister\u2019s\nhusband. And he got the same disease in Israel. He was a young man. He was 60, 62 when he\ndied. And he got a job as an engineer, but in a different field. It was a margarine factory where\nhe was in engineering, like making colognes and that kind of, you know? Entirely different. But\nthey were okay. Her father gave a lot of money to Israel, so they were okay in Israel. The two\nsisters, my cousin\u2019s two sisters were in Israel, the two sisters. And the mother, she was here.\nWhen she was 75 years old, she came to Canada and she came to me here and it was winter and\nshe says, \u201cGod, I love to see the snow. I never snow since I am in Israel.\u201d It was a big snow\nwhen she was here. And she spent her 75\" birthday here. And two years later she died. She had\ndiabetes and she didn\u2019t take care of herself. She ate everything in the world, but she lived well.\nI spoke to her daughter and she said, \u201c\u201cThat\u2019s the only thing, we are happy that she lived well.\u201d",
        "A: So again. So, I wasn\u2019t, when I came back. So I said, this was a long, long time. I don\u2019t know,\nmaybe he find somebody. I don\u2019t know. I was two weeks his wife, that\u2019s it. I got back. I met\nhim before they came, before they took us, he came to the ghetto. I told you that. But it was just\nthat, nothing, no relationship, we just met. [Laughing.] And then he left the ghetto and five\nminutes later we were surrounded. But he was telling me that, \u201cDon\u2019t let you take them to the\nwagons.\u201d I didn\u2019t know what he\u2019s talking about. He saw it on the way from Romania, of course,\nRomania, it was near the border there where they were. What they are doing, they\u2019re putting\npeople... and when the wagons came, I remembered his words, I says, \u201cDon\u2019t let you put\nyourself ...\u201d\u00bb Does he know that there are guns involved here? He didn\u2019t know that it was done\nwith machine guns. But he told me that \u201cYou are going to get a Christian birth certificate and\nyou come with me.\u201d It was true, everything. I told you that I find the birth certificate here. I\ndidn\u2019t know about it. Last time when he was in Hungary he brought everything. His sister was\nvery sick for ten years, but her son-in-law is a doctor and he kept her alive. Because he was\ntelling me when we were there, if not me, she wouldn\u2019t be alive anymore. Because the daughter\nwas always hysterical and even from meetings she called him. He was in a hospital like here,\nWalter Reed. He was there, a pathologist, under the Communism. So, he had a big job. And\nshe called him, \u201cRight away come and give mother injections,\u201d she yelled. And I was there\nwhen she did it. And he right away left everything, came and gave her injections. I think that\nshe had liver cancer, that\u2019s what I think. Because she had diabetes, diabetes, I don\u2019t know\nwhether it counts for me, that that family had diabetes, but my father\u2019s sister had diabetes in\nRussia. So it was in the family. I always forgot about it and when they were asking me, \u201cDid\nanybody have it in the family?\u201d And I always say, \u201cI don\u2019t know, they were killed when they\nwere 45 years old.\u201d And I know my grandmother didn\u2019t have it. I know the other sister didn\u2019t\nhave it. At that time I probably... I didn\u2019t know even that his sister had it, because she was\nwriting, my father, always to his sister. And he translated the letters to us, but I didn\u2019t think\nabout it, you know, that she had it. And now he was telling me, my cousin, that she had even a\nleg amputated because of diabetes. So it is in my family. But I don\u2019t know whether I got it. I\ndon\u2019t know. Because it was really, I had such a good doctor for 27 years and he never said that\u2019s\ndiabetes. Only my periodontist always said that I have diabetes because of my gums. It was\nalways, he said, \u201cWhat are they talking about, you have diabetes?\u201d And he always said, \u201cNo,\nyou don\u2019t have diabetes, it\u2019s just elevated because of the medications what you are taking.\u201d Here\nthe urologist was arguing with me, that I don\u2019t have... I had urinary tract infection. And he said,\n\u201cYou don\u2019t have diabetes. What are they talking about? Because it\u2019s not in your urine.\u201d Would\nyou believe that? Well, anyway. So then, when we lived in Eger, and we started to know each\nother. And right away, I got pregnant, a month later I got pregnant. We got very close and he\nwas a very, very good man. Very good. He had such a heart. He was so good. He never said,\nlike George, he never said nothing bad about nobody. And he tried to help people and he was a\nperson like, he worked in a hospital, and he... like nobody, you know... even in New York they\ndon\u2019t care about the Blacks. He shook hands with the elevator man or whatever. You know?\nHe was unbelievable good. Unbelievable. And when he retired, even before he retired, he went\nwithout me to Hungary, because I right away had four weeks vacation with the hospital. And\nwhen he retired, he went every year back to Hungary to see his sister. But the main thing to see\nthe children\u2019s grave. And one day I told him, \u201cListen Frank, you see I am the mother. You think\nthat I don\u2019t think about them?\u201d I says, \u201cYou go only to the stones. You must realize it, that you\ngo only to the stones.\u201d He says, \u201cYes, but at least I can fix up the letters if they are, you know,\nnot in shape.\u201d They are not buried separate. They are buried with my Uncle Joseph, in the same\ngrave, the two little kids. And then that was that reason, that he has an only sister and she\u2019s very\nsick. And then when he was very sick, he had a terrible heart attack in \u201881 and in \u201882, 17 months\nhe lived. And in between that he went to Hungary. I said to the doctor, \u201cWhat shall I tell him,\nthat he cannot go?\u201d He says, \u201cNo, he can go, but he cannot go around nowhere else, just to\nHungary. And he\u2019ll be all right there because his nephew is a doctor and he will be very safe\nthere.\u201d And I called him every week on the phone. And he said, \u201cI\u2019m fine, I\u2019m fine.\u201d Three-\nquarters of his heart was gone. \u201cI am fine,\u201d he said. And I always gave the report to the doctor.\nAnd he says, \u201cHe\u2019s fine because probably he sees sicker people around him, and then he has the\nnephew there\u2019. And that was the reason, because when he came back in July, end of June...\nevery July we were in the country for Ilona\u2019s, Ilona was born July 3\u2122 and I left a week vacation\nfor that, and we went to the country house, and he came back before that and he came with us\nand he was fine. We wanted to go, all of us, to Canada after. It\u2019s not close, but it\u2019s on the same\nhighway to go to Toronto, where it\u2019s close, like a country house. It was a long ride, but still it\nwas... I don\u2019t know about four, 500 hundred miles, through Niagara Falls. We wanted to all of\nus go, and he said, \u201cYou know what? I came from a long trip now, I go home myself. I drive\nhome myself. And you go with them.\u201d Laura was pregnant with Ana. And he was so happy,\nbecause he always wanted a lot of children. He was crazy for children. And George was an only\nchild, because the two others died. And he always, he was very happy. He loved them so much.\nThat\u2019s the last picture from them before he left. That was only Jacob and Ilona. And he... 1t was\nin April. No. No, because George took him to the airport. It was before he left. He died in \u201882.\nWhile we were in Canada, he got sick and he went himself to the hospital. They took him in\nIntensive Care, Coronary Care, I don\u2019t even know. But I called him when he was already home.\nAnd he said, \u201cBring a present to so and so.\u201d I says, \u201cWhy?\u201d He said, \u201cBecause he helped me. I\nwas in the hospital.\u201d So right away I packed and I went back. And in August he died. I wasn\u2019t\neven around. You know that story? It was terrible. He was so good. And he was so worried\nabout me, because when I was sick, he didn\u2019t get undressed. He was... the whole... because I\nhad two heart attacks, in \u201867 and in \u201870. So, it was always me they were worried about. So, he\nwas always, he didn\u2019t get undressed and he was... unbelievable nurse, you know? He was very,\nvery good. And with the children, everything they... what we had, and every vacation they were\nalways for those two children, because they lived upstairs. They lived in the same house. He\nloved them. He loved George. He loved them. He was very upset that he\u2019s an artist, because he\nthought that, he always of the Hungarian artist, and he was always telling them, \u201cYou know how\nthe artists are living? They are going barefoot because they don\u2019t have money for they...\u201d\n[Laughing.] You know, he was always worried. But when he said that \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I am going\nto teach.\u201d Then he was very happy, and he was always the first one whom George called. That\n\u201cT got tenure, I got even...\u201d no, he wasn\u2019t alive when he got full professor, only when he got\ntenure. He was alive. And he was very happy, and with every exhibition, though he didn\u2019t like\nhis paintings. But he said he loves it, because he went from that kind of a, ultra-modern. But he\nwas supporting him. And that was everything for him, George was everything. That\u2019s why we\nbought the house there, that he should have a studio. But he always said to him, \u201cIf you want to\nbe a real artist, don\u2019t get married.\u201d But he wanted to be an artist, but he... I mean, he didn\u2019t have\nno one else but us, that was a family, so he wanted a family. So he got married. And he loves\nhis children. He\u2019s a very good father, and he\u2019s very good to me, unbelievable good to me. And\nnobody can understand it.",
        "A: His wife cannot understand it. And I, I... because they don\u2019t know what 1s it... we went once to\na psychiatrist, because she was very jealous of his love towards me. She cannot, she cannot\nunderstand it that somebody can love two people different way. And the psychiatrist explained it\nto me. She would never understand it, because she never got along with her mother. She loved\nher father, and the minute her father died, she left home. So, she would never understand it. So,\nI said to him, \u201cSo Iam here, why I am here? You won\u2019t understand me either.\u201d It was an Italian\nguy. I said, \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t understand me. What is it to be in the world alone? Two of us,\nnobody, no family, just two of us. Would you understand that?\u201d So he says, \u201cI didn\u2019t know that,\nshe didn\u2019t tell that.\u201d\u2019 The trouble was, I walked in, he said... walked in. I was in wheelchair,\nbecause I fell on the steps here. 18 steps, and in the wheelchair I was forced to go to the\npsychiatrist. And he said to me, when I walked in, he says... Laura wasn\u2019t there, we went\ntogether and separate. And he says, \u201cHow many times your son called you when you were in\nNew York?\u201d I says, \u201cThat\u2019s the complaint?\u201d I says, \u201cIf you are a good son...\u201d You. That\u2019s how\nI talked to him, \u201c\u2018and your father would die, and your mother is alone in the world, you wouldn\u2019t\ncall her every night? And I paid the telephone bills.\u201d So, that she was complaining that he\u2019s\ncalling me every night when the father died. And sometimes saying, and it was something, no,\nbetween us and Ilona, which I thank God, Iona... he always told me, \u201cYou can always count on\nIlona.\u201d He loved Ilona. Jacob was very little. He loved Jacob, but Ilona was six... \u201882 and she\nwas born \u201976, six years old. So Ilona was already a bigger girl. And she always said, \u201cYou\nalways can count on Iona.\u201d And I must tell you, he was always teaching me if he dies, what 1s\ngoing to happen and how much I should divulge. I says, \u201cFrank, please don\u2019t talk about that.\u201d\nHe says, \u201cI know I am going to die when I am 69.\u201d I says, \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d He\nsays, \u201cBecause my uncle came home from hunting, he was fine, too. And he dropped dead when\nhe was 69. And he had a heart attack,\u201d so every night\u2014I didn\u2019t sleep many nights with him\u2014\nevery night he got shaved, he got dressed, and he was sleeping in that chair. He was always\nprepared that he has to go to the hospital or something, after the heart attack. It was terrible.\nAnd he was always teaching me what to do and how to do it. \u201cAnd I leave you enough,\u201d he said,\n\u201cthat you can live like a princess if you want to, but if you want to live with your daughter-in-\nlaw...\u201d\nEnd of Tape 4, Side B\nTape 5, Side A",
        "A: You know how we got out from Hungary? That you know? Okay. In Vienna I worked for\nInternational Rescue Committee. Their office was in New York, and it was there a boarding\nschool in the Vienna woods. A Hungarian teacher was in Vienna from New York, who came\nthere, he had his mother and sister in Hungary, and he wanted to help them to come over. And\nhis idea was to make a boarding school for the Hungarian refugee children. Those were all\npeasants\u2019 children. The parents got... is 1t on the tape once already? No. The peasants who\ncame over and they got a contract in Santo Domingo, I don\u2019t know how many hundreds, that\nthey get land there and they can work there and they get everything. Food and everything. And\nsomehow, somehow, they couldn\u2019t get in touch with nobody, but somehow the International\nRescue Committee find out that they didn\u2019t get nothing. They put them on the fields and they\ndidn\u2019t give them nothing. So they managed to bring them back. So, they brought them back to\nVienna and the parents, they put to the two camps. And the children, for the children, who were\nyoung, school kids, young, elementary school kids, and there were some bigger ones, they made\nthat boarding school. It was a beautiful, beautiful place and it was like a palace in the woods.\nAnd he talked them into it, that he will be head of the school. And because they helped them\nanyway, the International Rescue Committee. This way they can go to school. So we had seven\nHungarian teachers there. And the young ones had school there. And the older ones he took to\nthe village, the first time I saw the... the Volkswagen bus. He had a Volkswagen bus. He took\nthem by bus to German schools. And they were looking for a person for the office, one person\ndoes everything. And my... Ilona\u2019s sister-in-law, who was already in Vienna\u2014she\u2019s Ilona, too,\nboth of them\u2014she spoke and was always corresponding, that\u2019s what she did, in German, French,\nEnglish, Hungarian. And she worked for his very, very... her very, very, very, very rich cousin,\nwho... he was so rich that he lived in an apartment in the middle of Vienna with his wife and two\nchildren near the opera house where Franz Josef, Franz Josef\u2019s girl friend lived. And\nunbelievable, unbelievable, the whole first floor with the same furniture. And he was ina\nbusiness that time that started, I don\u2019t know what kind of electronics they started to make. And\nhe was a big businessman. He was in Hungary, too, but in time he went to Vienna. And he\nworked in his office, she worked in his office. And she didn\u2019t get enough, she thought that she\ndidn\u2019t get enough pay, then she went to American Embassy, asked for a job. Because she has\nthose, wonderful, wonderful really, she was wonderful typist, too. And they recommended her\nto that job for International Rescue Committee. Because the International Rescue Committee\nwas in connection with the... they were connected to the embassy, American Embassy. And she\ngot that job. And when she said it to the cousin that she\u2019s leaving because she can get more\nmoney, the cousin said, \u201cI give you the same money.\u201d So then she wanted to stay, because she\ndidn\u2019t have to travel. I had to travel by bus out of Vienna and then from the bus I had to walk in\nthe woods. And in the winter it was terrible, big snow and I had to walk to work. But anyway.\nSo, she said, \u201cLook, go there and tell him that you are my relative, and I have to give two weeks\nnotice. I cannot leave right away, I have to give note and I can fill it in for her.\u201d So right away\nhe says, \u201cOkay.\u201d He gives me a petty cash box with money. That was so funny because I wasn\u2019t\nused to that kind of a thing. And he told me what 1s the job, that I have to do the payroll. I have\nto pay the people. I have to, I don\u2019t know. I had to do the bookkeeping, but I never did. I took it\nhome for my husband, because that was his job. I hated bookkeeping. And I never knew how to\ndo it, but he graduated business school. He was a wonderful bookkeeper, so he did the\nbookkeeping. He didn\u2019t know. But when it came... he didn\u2019t know that I am taking it home.\nBut when it came that I had to go with the German... not accountant, who was he? Gosh... he\nwas an accountant, yes he was an accountant. And I had to give, where, what office, somewhere\nI had to go at the end of the year. Because it\u2019s the same thing, taxes. He says, \u201cWhat about?\u201d I\ncouldn\u2019t answer and I told him, \u201cI am not doing it, my husband is doing it.\u201d [Laughing] I told\nhim. He didn\u2019t care about it. But anyway two weeks later when it was two weeks, he says,\n\u201cWhere is Mrs. Schwartz?\u201d Her name... I says, \u201cShe decided to stay. If you want to keep me,\nokay. If not, thank you that you kept me.\u201d She says, \u201cYes, I want to keep you.\u201d That\u2019s how I\ngot the job and they paid me in American money. I got the... oh, the Germans didn\u2019t want me.\nThey didn\u2019t want to give me the... you had to have a certification that you can work there. I was\nno citizen. And they wanted the job. So in the kitchen it was a German woman, who was the\neverything, you know, she was overlooking and buying and everything. She was a German\nwoman, but I was in the office. And then he got it. He got in touch with the Embassy and\nwhatever and I got it. I still have it, the okay that I can work. And I got paid in American\nmoney. It was... I don\u2019t know, to me it seemed very much, because it was... I don\u2019t remember\nhow much I got. But we didn\u2019t live in a camp, we didn\u2019t. We lived in an apartment, we lived\ntogether with Ilona and her husband. We had together an apartment. And George went to school\nand she took care of George. And she took back and forth him to school. And then in summer,\nGeorge came with me there, when it was summer vacation. And they brought out there... they\ndid everything for those kids. Unbelievable. And they brought a German artist there to teach\nthem art in the summer. And George was, my George was in the group. And the first time he\npainted a head on a piece of wood. A piece of wood what was cut out from a tree. And he\npainted it, oil painting. And the guy came to me and he says, \u201cDo you know whom you have\nhere?\u201d I says, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d He said, \u201cHe\u2019ll be a great artist.\u201d Can you imagine that?\nAnd then in New York, too, in elementary... he came to middle school. He didn\u2019t lose nothing.\nHe was in middle school, and there too the teacher came to the house. And he said, \u201cDo you\nknow...\u201d the same words. I said, \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d He says, \u201cYou must come to\nthe principal with me.\u201d I went to the principal, and they showed me his work, what is he doing.\nSo, he wanted him to go to an art school in Manhattan, a high school. I don\u2019t know what was the\nname of it. And we misunderstood it. We thought it was music and art high school. And we\ntook him to music and art high school. And it was, oh God, he was traveling on the subways,\nand that was, you know, it was so far away. Were you in New York? Yeah? It was near the\nCity University, behind City University, behind Columbia University. And he was traveling for\nfour years, because he had a portfolio and they took him. So he went already to music and art\nhigh school. And he was really good. And after that he went to Cooper Union, where they take\nonly 50 kids from 500, he was amongst them. And Cooper Union 1s free, you know, that\u2019s a\nFoundation. And we just had to pay for the materials, but we didn\u2019t have to pay for his college.\n50 took, about 50 from 500 applicants. He was amongst them. So we finished that. He never\nwanted to go out-of-town college. He was accepted to Penn State University, and I don\u2019t know\nwhere else he applied in case he cannot get to Cooper. But he never wanted to leave us. He said,\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t come to America to be separated.\u201d We were three of us, that\u2019s it. My uncle was still\nalive, but we were three of us.",
        "A: He knows. Everything. First of all he knows, he listened to the tape. I always talked about it.\nAnd he... sometimes I am mixing it up, that 1t was my husband to whom I talked or to him. But\nhe knows it. He knows it. And I have written down everything, but unfortunately I wrote it\nHungarian and he cannot read it anymore, Hungarian. And I really have to write it over in\nEnglish, though I have tapes and for every kids. I think my whole lifetime is in the tapes, so I\ndon\u2019t know whether it\u2019s important to write it down. But no, Ana gave me a batch that I have to\nput down the whole family history because they are making family trees, and for me, for my\nhusband, for my husband\u2019s sisters and everything, in the school. She\u2019s asking. They are not\naware of it, the grandchildren, just about the Holocaust. He knew my husband, they knew, all of\nthem knew my husband. Not all of them. Ana didn\u2019t know. Anna just always saying that \u201cThat\nchair was grandpa\u2019s and I want to save it.\u201d They didn\u2019t have really... they don\u2019t know.",
        "A: Okay, that we didn\u2019t know. It was a quota was over. Closed. They let in so many people\neverywhere, that 1t was no open quota. That\u2019s why we had to stay in Vienna. And we stayed 17\nmonths. After 17 months they give for 1,000 people, and we were amongst the first ones\nbecause the International Rescue Committee took us. I had my uncle and he sent an affidavit,\nbut we didn\u2019t need it because they paid for us and they took us, the International Rescue\nCommittee. And we were the very first ones. The interesting thing was that by that time, maybe\nhalf a year before, we had a Baroness, a real Baroness Reitzes (ph) was her name, working as\na... over the housekeeping. She didn\u2019t do nothing actually. She lived in the middle of Vienna\nand she had a beautiful apartment, because we were there. She invited us. And she had a car,\nshe came every, she wanted a job. Her husband was Jewish, and he was killed somewhere in\nlabor camp. And she lived alone. She was a fat woman. And she had... her mother lived here,\nin New York. But she stayed in Vienna and she lived a big life. She had a big dog, I remember.\nAnd she had a housekeeper, but she wanted a job. She wanted a job. And she had a car and\nwhen she came, she picked me up every day by car and took me home by car, so it was much\neasier on me. But the interesting thing was that I never told her that I was in concentration camp.\nI never told her. I somehow, I don\u2019t know, they didn\u2019t see the number and... I don\u2019t know. I\nnever say, never told even that I was Jewish, to her. He knew probably, he knew, of course he\nknew. Haber was his name. He was a school teacher in New York. That was his idea. And I\ndon\u2019t know what happened to him, and to the school, too. Of course it\u2019s not there anymore.\nHabdersdorf (ph) was the name of the village. And she, when we got the okay to come, we had\nto go to Salzburg, to the Embassy. There was the American Embassy was in Salzburg, yes. And\nso she took us by car, three of us, to Salzburg. It was a beautiful, beautiful road. Unbelievable\nscenery. And then when we parted, I told her that Iam Jewish. [Laughing.|] She knew that I\nwas in concentration camp. She didn\u2019t know up to that point and she was very upset that I didn\u2019t\ntell her before that I was in concentration camp. I never told anybody.",
        "A: I never... I was very uncomfortable in Vienna. When we first, it was May when we got there\nand beautiful and we had... already it was arranged for us an apartment when we came. My\nuncle\u2019s brother arranged. And he was a Jewish man, who was saved in Singapore. He went with\nhis son to Singapore. A very interesting man and he lived alone, an elderly man. And he had a\npretty nice big apartment. And he had only one room for himself, and he gave two rooms and\nthe kitchen to us. And so we were there and the windows were open. And when I got up in the\nmorning and I heard the German language under the window, I got so crazy. I went crazy. My\nhusband couldn\u2019t get a job. He didn\u2019t speak German. He couldn\u2019t get a job, but they gave him\nsome kind of a... oh, no. When we left I got a letter from the International Rescue Committee\nthat when we arrive we should go to New York, to their main office and show them the letter that\nI work for them. And we got a counselor there, and we went in and I give him the letter. I didn\u2019t\nsay nowhere, it doesn\u2019t say nowhere that story? I gave him the letter, and he looks at me and\nsays, \u201cI don\u2019t believe it that you don\u2019t remember me.\u201d I says, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, how do you know\nme?\u2019 She says, \u201cI was in the school there. They came some, observe the school from New\nYork, the International Rescue Committee. Don\u2019t you remember I was there with my wife and I\nwas in one car with you going back to Vienna?\u201d Then I remembered. I didn\u2019t even think about\nit, you know, that is somebody. So, he was very nice. He said, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to show me the\nletter, I know what you did there, but I must tell you, you did there everything. But in America\nyou have to do one thing, and good, not so many things what you did there in the office. I\u2019m\ngoing to send you to NCR school.\u201d When I heard bookkeeping, I just didn\u2019t... you know? I\ndidn\u2019t say no, but I didn\u2019t go, when he told me to go to. What happened, I didn\u2019t know that, I got\npregnant. And I know it\u2019s that I got pregnant in Salzburg. I remember it, but I didn\u2019t know that I\ngot pregnant. I didn\u2019t know. I had my period every month and I didn\u2019t know that I\u2019m pregnant.\nAnd three months later I started to bleed like terribly and I didn\u2019t know that I\u2019m pregnant. And I\nwent to the doctor and he said you are pregnant, but you are going to have a miscarriage, because\nyou have fibroids. So, I didn\u2019t go to International School. And he called me on the phone and\nhe called me when I came back from the hospital. And I says, \u201cI was sick, and that\u2019s what\nhappened. I had a miscarriage,\u201d I told him. \u201cAnd I couldn\u2019t go.\u201d But when I was better, they\nkept me, I was in the fourth month, and they kept me there five days. They thought every day\nthe babies, four months. I was dying there. I lost so much blood. But then finally they did it.\nAnd they said that \u201cYou have to come back in six weeks and you have to have a hysterectomy.\u201d\nAnd six weeks later I went back and they said, \u201cNo you don\u2019t need it. It was so big, everything\nbecause you were pregnant. You don\u2019t need a hysterectomy.\u201d So then I went back. When he\ncalled me, I said, \u201cNo, I can\u2019t go now.\u201d So he sent me to NCR school. NCR was not the cashier\nmachines, they were NCR machines, the cashier, you know. They had big, big bookkeeping\nmachines, before the computers. Big bars, rechangeable that you could do everything. You\ncould go, big papers with monthly statements and you could go checks. Other side I could put\nthe vendor\u2019s card and put down to whom I am paying. And I went there and I learned it in one\nweek. Oh, he asked whether I can type, I says, \u201cYes, I can type.\u201d So they taught me for the\nmachine in one week and they gave me a job after one week. I didn\u2019t have any experience, but I\nknew how to do the machine. And they gave me a job in a publishing company in Manhattan,\nColumbus Square or Circle or what was it. And I had to travel from Brooklyn. I was so sick on\nthe subways that I was more in the doctor\u2019s office than at home. It was terrible. I cannot, even\nin Hungary what is above the ground I was always standing outside on the air. I couldn\u2019t travel.\nAnd that was underground and was going on in New York subways. It was terrible. And that\nwas a publisher, who made some kind of a... I don\u2019t know whether it was comic books or what it\nwas, Ihave no... Publishing company. And they were two machines, it was a receivable and a\npayable. And I was the payable and the other guy, a guy, a young guy, who was very helpful.\nAnd he tried to teach me, because I knew the machine, but I didn\u2019t have experience. I didn\u2019t\nhave the speed, first of all, and if I made a mistake, I didn\u2019t know how to correct it. And he was\nvery, very helpful. But the comptroller... not comptroller, liked me very much, the comptroller,\nbut the bookkeeper, who was from Massachusetts, I didn\u2019t know from my life. I didn\u2019t know\nwhere is Massachusetts [laughing], and he was so proud of it, that he 1s from Massachusetts. He\nwas amisery. And he was a Jew. And he made my life, he got back the checks from the bank,\nwhat I was typing. And he found mistakes. He was so miserable and he said to me, \u201cYou just\ncame. You are a refugee, and you right away have to sit in an office?\u201d Can you imagine? A\nJew. I was very miserable. It was 60 dollars a week, what was a nice pay at that time. And they\ngave me even commissions. I don\u2019t know what was it, from sale or something. I was there for\nthree months and I was constantly looking for another job. And one day from New York Times,\nI see a job, Brooklyn Jewish Hospital is looking for an NCR operator. They were on strike\nbecause they were already... the half, not the office, but the kitchen and the... I don\u2019t know,\ncleaning people, they were in the Union. And they had a strike. The office, too, because nobody\ncould, they had a black man working years on that machine, and he left because he got a better\njob under the strike. And they didn\u2019t have no one for three months. They had young girls, but\nthey left. Young people don\u2019t want to sit and work. You had to sit at the machine. So, when I\nsaw that, it was in walking distance from us, the hospital, and I had to pass by, every morning,\nmy uncle\u2019s pharmacy. So he came always earlier to open that he should see me in the morning\nwhen I go to work or when I go home, because it was in a walking distance. And I never thought\nthat I stay there. And the comptroller wasn\u2019t... was out of town or I don\u2019t know where. He\nwasn\u2019t there when I got the job. So the personnel, she gave me the job. And I was working, it\nwas a big office and we had two machines like there, accounts payable and receivable. The\nreceivable was another woman working. And the comptroller came back and he called me to the\noffice and he greeted me and he was very, very nice to me. And he said, \u201cI must tell you one\nthing, if you do the job by Christmas...\u201d they were behind three months with bills. Well I saw\nthose bins with bills. \u201cIf you do it by Christmas, the job is yours.\u201d So I started to do it and I\nstarted to be very fast on the machine, very fast. And I did it day before Christmas. So, but\nwomen there, they were Jewish women, they were very jealous. One of them, first of all I never\nspoke about concentration camp. Never. It was mixed, they were non-Jews and Jews there, and\nI never spoke to them about it. And one woman, a Jewish woman, she said to me, \u201cWhy did you\ncome to America?\u201d This way. I says, \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d He says, \u201cWhy, the communism is\nnot enough good?\u201d I says, \u201cMaybe it is good for you because you have a house, every child of\nyou has a car and you have a nice job. You could change place with me,\u201d I said. [Laughing]\nCan you imagine that? She was a Leftist. And she didn\u2019t work on a machine, but she worked in\nthe office. That time it was everything together, the billing. We had a big, big office and\nmachine and no machine. The machines were in the back. And then there was another woman,\nwho was like that man there, who was controlling me and she was miserable, too. If I made a\nmistake, she was miserable. And I was crying, and I went to the Comptroller and I says, \u201cI just\ndon\u2019t know what to do.\u201d She says, \u201cWhat\u2019s happening?\u201d And I told him what\u2019s happening. He\nsays, \u201cYou come to me, you don\u2019t go to them. If you don\u2019t know something you come to me.\u201d\nIt was aman. And from then on, I was all right. I had trouble because I had to answer the\ntelephone. I was payable and the vendors were calling me. So, in the beginning I had big\ntrouble. I spoke English, but I spoke English, not Yankee. Because I learned English from an\nEnglish teacher in Czechoslovakia when it was Hungary already and we thought that we come to\nAmerica. We had private lessons. And my sister was very, very smart. And we were reading\nAnna Karenina in English and... I told you, no? That story. So we learned English. And we\ndidn\u2019t understand each other on the phone, you know? [Laughing.] So in the beginning I had\nproblems, but then it was okay. Even the Americans came to me, how do you spell that, how do\nyou spell this? You know? That was the end. But I never thought that I stay there 27 years. I\nstayed there 27 years. I went through many comptrollers. [Laughing.| He left, but he was a\nlong time there. But he left. And then one day the Personnel Director comes in, closes the door\nand he says, \u201cAttention, please.\u201d Everybody looks up, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d He says, \u201cI must announce\nit, that from yesterday on, everybody is in the Union.\u201d So I didn\u2019t know what does it mean and\nwhy is it good or bad, just in the Union. Fine. I don\u2019t care where we are. And it was an\nunbelievable advantage. I was the highest paid because of the machines. So, if somebody got\nthree dollars pay and raise, I got five dollars raise. From 60 dollars in one year, because I started\nwith 60 back there in the other place, I went up to 125 dollars because of the Union. And thank\nGod, because of the Union, I have a pension today from the Union, and I have free medication.\nMy medication bills are 4,000 dollars a year, because they are sending me the company\u2019s and\nthat\u2019s another pension, 4,000 dollars. And I am getting pension. And because... oh, that\u2019s the\nstory. Before I... a year before I left, it was another strike. And I didn\u2019t go to work, because I\nwas afraid. You know? Crossing the picket lines. But I never picketed, never. I was in the\ncountry for a month, it was a month strike. And I was in touch with them. I called always\nPersonnel. Personnel was begging me, \u201cPlease come back.\u201d Because by that time we had only\none machine, it was no more receivable because they gave it out to computers. So, I was the\nonly machine and the only person who knew the machine. They were typing checks, the people\nwho were non-Union. And it was horrible, horrible, they were behind, and terrible. And he was\nbegging me, \u201cPlease come back. Come back, don\u2019t worry, nobody is picketing anymore.\u201d And\nthey were in the country and one day he calls me and he says, \u201cCome back. We are going to\nsend you a Black girl down for you if you are afraid. We are watching you when you when you\nare coming. And please come back.\u201d And they went to the country and they dropped me off and\nthey are watching it whether I go in. It was no picketing. It was no picket line anymore. And I\nwent in and then everybody was shocked, because nobody knew that I am not in the Union. I\ncouldn\u2019t have, I couldn\u2019t, I don\u2019t know. It was... they just didn\u2019t believe it that I am, you know,\nin the Union, in the Union, the people. Because that was a job what was a confidential job, with\nthe payroll and everything. So they didn\u2019t believe it that I am in the Union. So, what happened,\nthe person...\nEnd of Tape 5, Side A\nTape 5, Side B",
        "A: ... you get out from the Union. They didn\u2019t know that I am close to retirement. That I wanted to\nretire. I didn\u2019t know either. If you get out from a union and you get the hospital pension and\nyou get medication from the hospital, doctors from the hospital and they give you 25,000 a year.\nI said, \u201cHow do I do that?\u201d He says, \u201cI\u2019m going to send a telegram,\u201d because the Union was\nthreatening us, that if we are still on strike they are not going to cover us medically. Because\nthey had very good medical coverage. Every doctor wanted you if you were in the Union. I\nsays, \u201cI cannot live without medical coverage.\u201d She says, \u201cOkay so I\u2019m going to tell them that\nyou cannot be without coverage and you are out from the Union.\u201d So, for one year, I went out\nfrom the Union. Then after a year, I wanted to retire. I worked one year more than 65, 66 I was\nwhen I left. And I says, \u201cCan you put me back to the Union?\u201d Because they would have to give\nme a pension from the hospital if I am not in the Union. So the personnel, the secretary, his\nsecretary, arranged it that they paid me for one year dues, for one year everything, because they\npaid for medical for us, the Union. And they paid for pension. I paid the bills, hundreds of\nthousands of dollars to the Union. I was paying them. And they said that it was a mistake and\nthey got me back to the Union. Can you imagine? It was such a luck because I wouldn\u2019t have\nthe Union. I wouldn\u2019t have the pension because they say to me... I\u2019m talking to some people\nfrom the hospital, \u201cIt\u2019s terrible, it\u2019s almost bankrupt.\u201d We were bankrupt after ten years, we\nwent to Chapter 11. I went to, through with them, voided thousands and thousands of checks and\neverything after ten years. And they had to merge with another hospital. It was St. Joseph... St.\nJohn\u2019s. Here is St. Joseph\u2019s. St. John\u2019s Hospital. And then we got more, we were the main\nhospital. We got more employees. It was 3,000 people. And we paid everything. We paid they\nbills, too, for medication, for the pharmacy tech, everything. It was everything through us. So it\nwas a very big job. But I had a separate room because the machine was very noisy. And I was\nalone in the room, so that was very good. And they always wanted me to be a manager and I\ndidn\u2019t want to because I knew that I am out of the Union if I am a manager. I says, \u201cI do the job.\nI am not a manager.\u201d So, I was lucky.",
        "A: My journey to the United States? We came in 1958. The International Rescue Committee from\nSalzburg brought us... Oh. That was a very terrible thing, too. They send us for x-rays, chest x-\nrays before you come. And they didn\u2019t want me let through. I\u2019m sorry, stomach. They didn\u2019t\nlet me go through because they said that I have something on my lungs. It turned out that I had\npneumonia in the camp and I didn\u2019t know about it and it showed. And they said, \u201cThey can go,\nyour husband and your son, but you have to go on another plane, because it\u2019s something.\u201d I\nwent crazy. They didn\u2019t want to go without me, but luckily they called me for a second x-ray\nand that was all well. That was okay, so we came together. But we came on a military plane. I\ndon\u2019t know how many hundreds of people, and so uncomfortable, and we were sitting in the last\nrow, near the toilet. And they were only two seats, so we always changed. One sits with George\nand then the other one was sitting alone, you know? But we were sitting in the same row, but\nbetween us the aisle. Very uncomfortable, very. I think we were 24 hours in the air. It was just\nterrible. And we stopped at Newfoundland, Newfoundland. And then they give us there the first\nmeal, a dinner. And from that I got so sick, that the whole journey to New York, it was just\nunbelievable. I was so sick. But I was pregnant and I didn\u2019t know, maybe that\u2019s why I was sick\nfrom the food. So when we arrived, it was that time Kennedy Airport... no, La Guardia, \u2019m\nsorry. La Guardia, not Kennedy Airport. And we saw my uncle and my aunt up there waiting\nfor us and waving. And we saw the first Black man in our lives. They had a postman, who\ndelivered the mail and he had a car. And my uncle, he came always... he had like here in\npharmacies they have a counter where you have food, too. It was so strange to me, because there\nis no such a thing in Europe in pharmacies. Pharmacy is pharmacy. And he was telling him that\nif he has a free day, that he is going to pay him take him to the airport and wait for us. So he was\na fat man and it was the first time in my life that I saw a black man. And he was taking us home\nto my uncle. They lived not very far from the pharmacy. Though the house was theirs, the\npharmacy was one day apartments. They lived in a separate apartment. And he had a partner\nbecause his diploma... I have still his Russian diploma, was not certificated, so he had an\nAmerican partner. Very nice people. They lived in the house, in the upstairs in the house. They\nwere very good friends. They didn\u2019t have children, and they didn\u2019t have children. They were\nvery good friends. He was a very nice man. And so we were three days in our uncle\u2019s house. It\nwas only, what they had, the living room is a big, big. Bedroom they had, and a living room, a\nkitchen. It was a private, private house. I don\u2019t know, bathroom, nothing else. They had two in\nthe house, two apartments in the house, the landlord and them. And they rented for us, in that\nkind of a house, but in another street, an apartment, upstairs. But it was small. It was just a\nbedroom and a little living room and at the end of the living room was the kitchen, a small\nkitchen with a small frigidaire. So, that was our first apartment. And that was our street where\nGeorge went to middle school.",
        "A: I was very upset when they showed us pictures from New York at the Embassy. I says, \u201cMy\nGod, stones and stones and stones. It\u2019s no green nowhere.\u201d They showed us New York in the\nembassy. It was very frightening. When I went very, very first time to Manhattan, I couldn\u2019t\nbelieve it. I couldn\u2019t look up because I was dizzy from the tall houses, but I loved it. I love New\nYork and that\u2019s the place where I lived most of my life. When I added up one day where I lived\nthe longest, 1t was New York. And I love New York. I loved it. We lived in Brooklyn, near the\nocean. I love the ocean. I love the ocean in the Spring and in the Fall. I don\u2019t like to go in\nbecause the mob was there, it\u2019s unbelievable. But to walk on the Boardwalk, the sundown, the\nsunset, it was so relaxing. It was wonderful. And they were benches, you know, and we were\nsitting on it. It was unbelievable, and I missed it here very, very much when I came here. When\nI came here I knew Lexington, because he\u2019s here for \u201879, 1979. And three times a year I was\nhere. I had four weeks vacation, three weeks here and one week in the country house, that\ncountry house in the Catskills. My husband loved it because he loved the country. He loved it.\nHe loved it here. When he saw the horses, and we wanted to retire here. We came here and\nalways looking for places where... we wanted a duplex. We always thought it\u2019s enough, we are\ntogether and separate. But for them it was never enough, the duplex. For us it would be, they\nare small apartments. But anyway it didn\u2019t come to it, because he died. But he wanted to live\nhere. I loved the big cities. I never lived in a small town, because where we lived in\nCzechoslovakia, that was the capital of that part. And Budapest is beautiful. So I couldn\u2019t\nimagine to live... and they was always questioning where is the city here? Where is the city?\n[Laughing |",
        "A: Here, yeah, but you go to... then they showed me downtown. I says, \u201cOh my God.\u201d [Laughing. ]\nOkay. But I knew where I\u2019m coming. But still when I came here really, that this is now real, I\nthought I go to the nuthouse.",
        "A: When I moved here. When I moved here in November of \u201886. And I was very upset. I was\nhomesick. So the first year, they went every year back to the summer house. Every year they\nspent there and I went with them. It\u2019s half of mine, from the summer house. My husband\nbought it for me and them, half. But we paid their half with cash because they didn\u2019t have\nmoney at that time, they just started teaching and they gave us the credit. So we paid they half\ncash and they paid the other half out in ten years. And it\u2019s in the Catskills. It\u2019s a beautiful place.\nIt\u2019s a small house, but it was very nice. We have two bedrooms and in between us was the\nbathroom and the living room and upstairs it was a big, big attic and it was made up for a\nbedroom, but we didn\u2019t need it. Because we were four only. They didn\u2019t have even children at\nthat time, \u201873. And even in the winter we went up. It was beautiful. It was very close to all the\nskiing place, all the people. It\u2019s very nice. And he wouldn\u2019t sell it, because he\u2019s very\nsentimental, because Daddy loved it. He would never sell it, and he loves it because he is away\nfrom here and he is going up four or five, it\u2019s three acres, hill. And underneath there is a big, big\nlibrary, that\u2019s our neighbor. It\u2019s a library for four, five towns, five little towns. A big library.\nAnd...",
        "A: Yes, correct.",
        "A: Especially here, here never were refugees in Lexington. Not Jewish, or Jewish or not Jewish.\nThey never were refugees here in Lexington. And then up to today, I must tell you. You are\nfriends with the people in the synagogue. They are not real friends. You are friends in the\nsynagogue. There we socialize, but they wouldn\u2019t invite you to their houses, even here. Yes.\nAnd what I found out, I found out that almost everybody\u2019s fathers came from Europe. Those\npeople who are here 30 years or whatever... everybody\u2019s, but still they are Lexingtonians. And\nit\u2019s very interesting. I don\u2019t care, because just now I have only two friends, a lawyer and his\nwife, and from Winchester, Sylvia. But she is again from the synagogue, because I don\u2019t go to\nWinchester. And I went when her husband died, I went to see her a few times, but otherwise I\u2019m\nnot driving outside of Lexington. I\u2019m glad I find my way here. And so, she calls when they\nknow that I\u2019m sick. But I really don\u2019t have friends here. And another couple, who is a Polish\ncouple, the Habers. You\u2019ve were there? No.",
        "A: But they are very nice. Last week she made a party, it was her birthday. And I couldn\u2019t make it,\nI was so sick. Because in the beginning we made, we went to each other\u2019s houses and we had a\nbook club. Everybody read the same book and we discussed it, book discussion club. That\nwoman died. That was a pharmacologist\u2019s wife. And since she died, I am not going. I am not\ngoing. I could. It\u2019s the Haddassah. You know what\u2019s the Haddassah? They have it, but I don\u2019t\nlike those people because they... I don\u2019t like them because they went away from the synagogue\nand they have their own congregation, the Havarah. And I cannot see that. And in the\nbeginning, when George moved here, they were so friendly to him. They wanted to get him\nthere. And he would never go. Because they have here a rabbi, who was blind. He was a very\nnice man. He died from diabetes, fairly young. And he... I don\u2019t like those people, because\nwhen they found out that George doesn\u2019t want to belong there, it was finished with the\nfriendship. You know? But when they come sometimes to the synagogue or whatever, they are\nnice to you. You know? But they have their own clique, only Havarah, but they are none of\nthem from Lexington. They are everybody from somewheres else. And they feel that they are\ntogether and they help each other. And it\u2019s a bigger, there are 80 families now there. They are\nalways bigger and bigger. They don\u2019t have a place where to pray. They pray, I think, once a\nmonth or twice a month, I don\u2019t know and always someplace else. In the Christian church\nbasement or someplace. They don\u2019t have a steady place. Sometimes they pray here, too. Pray\nhere in the club. But I really don\u2019t have no friends. Besides the three people and the librarian\nfrom the synagogue, she\u2019s very nice. But we don\u2019t go to each other\u2019s houses.",
        "A: Yes, they are, they are, definitely they are. They are very nice to you in the synagogue, you\nknow. But nobody would say, \u201cCome.\u201d And the rabbi was different. We were always over. I\nwas always invited, because they used to go too, and I didn\u2019t want to go with them, like for\nPassover, to Indiana. His best friend is there, from New York, best friend. And I didn\u2019t want to\ngo, so I was always invited to Rabbi. Sometimes with Ilona when she was here for Passover, but\nnot to other people\u2019s. So itis. They are. I think they are. It\u2019s unbelievable. In the beginning\nwe had here big parties, because they came here, like guest speakers and they wanted to take\nthem to homes. I don\u2019t know why they choosed us about two or three times and they met here.\nAnd we contributed. We made the cookies and cakes and everything. And one couple came, he\nis very wealthy. And he\u2019s a nice guy. He\u2019s nice to me, very nice, in the synagogue, but they\ncame and they looked around. And I see that they are looking around themselves, you know?\nThey were away from the other people. And I said, \u201cDo you want to see the house?\u201d And she\nsays, \u201cOh, you are acting like it would be your house,\u201d she said, he said. I says, \u201cYes, my\nmoney\u2019s in that house.\u201d They thought that it\u2019s... because it\u2019s on their name. Me idiot.\n[Laughing] My friend, I have a pediatrician friend, a woman. She doesn\u2019t know up to today,\nthat it\u2019s . She said to me, \u201cDon\u2019t you dare to do it, that it\u2019s not only your name and\nGeorge\u2019s. You made the money for it.\u201d That I put it on their name. I trusted them.",
        "A: And that\u2019s what I think, you know? That\u2019s how they are. That\u2019s the first and last time they were\nhere, because it was a party for somebody. And on the rabbi\u2019s wife\u2019s birthday, not this rabbi.\nAnother. We had a rabbi who 1s from England. Rabbi Smith (ph), he\u2019s still here. He works for\nthe State Department now. Because they... he was three years rabbi. He couldn\u2019t handle\nchildren. He doesn\u2019t have children. And he is so smart that he is too smart for them. Very, very\nsmart man. So...",
        "A: No, no, no, no. I right away, when we were, right away, five years later, we were citizens,\nbecause you have to be five years. No, I felt at home. I felt at home, and we had our friends.\nWe had our friends. We had a lot of friends. We had friends, Hungarian friends, of course, they\nwere Hungarians. Some of them came here from, from Australia and then we met here. And\nthen we an association, Budapest. Every city had an association and we got once a month\ntogether in Manhattan. They had five o\u2019clock teas. And of course, the end was always the\nHolocaust, talking about the Holocaust, because almost all of them were in Holocaust, you know,\nthere. So, I felt very well. I felt... yeah. The last six months when I left, when I was alone\nthere, my husband died, I was there four more years alone and then they... ... \u201cGeorge,\nwhen are you coming?\u201d I met a woman, who was my age exactly and he worked... I told you\nthat too? He worked, she worked in Manhattan in the jewelry section. She was an American.\nAnd she didn\u2019t live very far from us. And I went every week, I went to the theater. I said it? I\ntold that story? But we had private buses and they went certain hours, because I didn\u2019t want to\ngo by train. And I didn\u2019t drive to Manhattan. She was going to the same beauty parlor as me\nand she was sitting near me. And one day I hear that she\u2019s talking about it that she was in Alaska\nand whatever, but still I didn\u2019t talk to her. Maybe I am not friendly. I am not talking to people\nwhom I don\u2019t know, but I overheard everything. But she noticed... yeah, I go to the bus and I\nam waiting on the bus. And she lived in that street where the bus stop was and she went to\nManhattan, too. And she said to me, \u201cWhere are you going?\u201d It\u2019s first time she spoke to me. I\nsaid, \u201cI am going to the theater.\u201d She says, \u201cAlone?\u201d I says, \u201cYes, my husband died and I\u2019m\ngoing alone.\u201d She said, \u201cMy God, would you get me a ticket, too? For next performance?\u201d I\nsays, \u201cWhy not?\u201d She said, \u201cBecause I am alone, too. My husband died.\u201d And I said, \u201cWhere\ndo I leave the ticket?\u201d She said, leave it with my beautician when you go the beauty parlor. And\nI left the ticket, and from then on we became good friends. And every week we went together,\nbut not by bus. I was driving. I know how to drive, but she didn\u2019t have a car. She knew where\nto go, but I knew how. And we went by car. And there was the parking under the theater and it\npaid. Because it was $3.50 a trip, you know, it\u2019s seven dollars, fourteen from ten dollars,\nparking under the theater. And after that we went always to Marriott Hotel, up, they had a\nwonderful, wonderful, like Viennese Bakery, a garden restaurant, where they had coffee and\ncake. After that we went up, and we were very good friends, but it was only six months because\nsix months later I came. And her son was a manager of the Days Inn Hotel in Manhattan. And\nwhen we went, first time when we went to the country, first year, and I was very, very homesick\nfor New York and I was depressed and I was crying in the country. And George said, \u201cDo you\nwant to go to the city?\u201d I says \u201cYes.\u201d So, I called her up and her son gave us a suite for 25\ndollars and we stayed there for three days. And he went to the museum right away. And I went,\nI think, with Laura to Fifth Avenue. I don\u2019t know. And I think that Ilona went with him, yes, to\nthe museum. And we stayed there three days. And then again, one time I went only with Ilona.\nI stayed there a week. And I included her always, the woman for the theater, and they gave us a\ndinner there, for the... I remember before we left and she was there too, you know, in the hotel.\nAnd we had a very good time, but it was only for six months. I met her late. I mean I saw her,\nbut I didn\u2019t know who she was and because I was there four years alone. And she was alone four\nyears, too. And she was retiring, too, the same time. She worked 20, 27 years, too. Can you\nimagine that? So it was late.",
        "A: In New York weren\u2019t treated bad, but here, when he came here, the blacks were sitting in the\nback of the bus. That I couldn\u2019t imagine. It was no sales ladies black, no one. I didn\u2019t see no\none black, they were all separate. It was unbelievable. And what was the most unbelievable\nthing, everybody wore sneakers. In the subways, too. And we said, \u201cThey don\u2019t have shoes\nhere? Everybody\u2019s wearing sneakers.\u201d We couldn\u2019t understand that. Everybody in the\nmorning. And then we saw people who went to bigger offices to work. They had they shoes in\nthey bags, because if you have to wait for a bus and, many times I was waiting with high heels\nand I said, \u201cMy God, I wish I would wear sneakers,\u201d you know? When I went to the city I was\nwearing always high heels. Because in the office I was wearing always high heels. And that was\nthe custom. We couldn\u2019t understand. That was the most unbelievable thing when we went on\nthe subway that everybody is in white sneakers. We didn\u2019t know about the segregation. We\ndidn\u2019t know in Hungary about it. We didn\u2019t, we didn\u2019t have blacks. We didn\u2019t. Oh, I\u2019m sorry.\nI saw the first black man in the English Army. I saw a soldier. And it wasn\u2019t even... I don\u2019t\nknow whether he was in the English army. It\u2019s interesting, they were taking us by jeep to\nNuremberg from Bergen-Belsen. And another jeep came and they were throwing to us from\ntheir jeep, oranges. And it was a black soldier. That was the first one. Not the first one. Yes,\nthat was the first one. But I just didn\u2019t notice it, color, color... it was no difference to me.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t know what to expect here. I knew just I have an uncle here. I didn\u2019t know what to\nexpect. I didn\u2019t. The very, very bad experience was the very, very first time when we had a\nbigger apartment and George with the school was supposed to go to the Shakespearean play with\nthe school to Connecticut. And he comes home and he had a friend, who was a very tough guy.\nHe was Hungarian. And he was with him, probably, I don\u2019t know. And a black boy started to\nhit George. And he hit him in his mouth. He lost a tooth and he was bleeding and he couldn\u2019t go\nto the show. That was the very, very first time when I said, \u201cOh my God, what 1s going on\nhere?\u201d In Brooklyn. It was on the corner where we lived. So then I said, \u201cOh my God.\u201d You\nknow? I didn\u2019t know nothing about it. It was a very strange thing.",
        "A: I think that they wanted the other boy, because he was a very tough guy. He was wearing always\nboots and he had a knife in his boot. So, he was his bodyguard. [Laughing.] After that when it\nhappened, he was always with him. Because I didn\u2019t know why it happened, because he is\nwhite. I didn\u2019t know. But then I knew, you know, when it happened then I knew that maybe...\nbut maybe they knew the other guy and they wanted him and they... he was weak. I don\u2019t know.\nI don\u2019t know, but I felt terrible. I felt terrible.",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t. I tell you why, because I worked with blacks in the hospital. My best friends were\nblacks, who are still calling me. But not New Yorkers. They were from Barbados, from Jamaica\nand they are different. They are entirely different. New York blacks are no good. They are no\ngood. They are. They are no good. But those people, I don\u2019t know whether they are more\neducated or why, but they were entirely different. And we had... oh, that story is interesting,\ntoo. We had New Yorkers, too, there and they hated each other. The Jamaicans and the\nBarbadians, they hated the New York blacks in the office. In the big accounting office. So it\nwas a big hatred between them. And oh gosh, one had two daughters and one daughter married a\nNew Yorker. She is divorced. She divorced him. But they were very against him. They feel\nthat they are more. They are. They are more educated. And one of them was going to school in\nEngland and her husband was an engineer. And unfortunately they are different. I didn\u2019t come\nacross a New Yorker black who was so nice as those. You know what I mean? I\u2019m not talking\nabout Harlem. I don\u2019t know. But what was around me, that was my opinion and that\u2019s how I\nfelt, that they were different.\nEnd of Tape 5, Side B\nTape 6, Side A",
        "A: In 1986, when I came here, and I went to the beauty parlor and I had a short sleeve shirt on and\nthe beautician said, \u201cWhat is that?\u201d I said, \u201cThis is the Holocaust.\u201d \u201cThe Holocaust? My\ndaughter was just taught in Tates Creek High that she shouldn\u2019t believe it. That they shouldn\u2019t\nbelieve it, it was a Holocaust. It was made up by the Jews.\u201d I thought I faint. I says, \u201cWhat?\u201d\nShe says, \u201cYes, she was just taught. And I very surprised to see you. I never saw a survivor.\u201d\nThen a woman came here\u2014I came here the first time alone when we didn\u2019t move in yet and they\nhad blinds made in the family room\u2014and she was from McAlpins. And I\u2019m sitting in the chair\nand she sits near me, this way, and she noticed the number. And she jumps up and she starts to\nscream. I says, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d She says, \u201cI never saw somebody, I never saw nobody, who\ncame back from there. Let me have a, let me, can I make a prayer for you?\u201d And she kneels\ndown and she starts to pray like I would come, you know, from somewhere, an alien. It was\nunbelievable experience. But after that when it happened, that she said they were teaching it.\nShe was teaching in Nicholasville, Laura, at that time. And I told her, I says, \u201cWhere did you\nbring me? That\u2019s what they teach here? I never heard it in my life.\u201d And she was very upset,\nand she spoke to the high school teacher there and she said, \u201cHow about if she would come to\nschool?\u201d I says, \u201cI cannot talk. I never spoke in my life.\u201d She says, \u201cHow about if I come to\nyour house?\u201d She said. So she came, and I spoke to the microphone for two hours. And from\nthat moment on, she [phone rings] ...She came from the high school. I spoke two hours in the\nmicrophone. And it was no stop. They came to the house and they were begging me to come to\nspeak in the high school there. And it was a pretty bad experience, the very first one. That was\nthe first ttme when I spoke.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know whether, yeah, they have more. I spoke at other high schools, too. It was a regular\nhigh school, but I spoke at the high school there, when there were women who were pregnant\nand they were going to school. That was another high school, but that was regular high school.\nI don\u2019t know what was the name, in Nicholasville, Jessamine County. And they were, it was a\nman teacher, who was very, very nice. He was a history teacher. But it was a... they sat like\naround the wall in circle they put the chairs. And on that side, on the left side, 1t was a circle\nwith about ten boys, who were shaved, their heads and they didn\u2019t look at me. Because at that\ntime I was beginner speaker and I started to speak and I asked them who believes in the\nHolocaust, that the Holocaust is true, they should put their hands up. They didn\u2019t. And the\nwhole time I was talking and they didn\u2019t look at me. So when I finished, and I was pretty\nnervous, that was my first speech. But it was good because the teacher was absolutely\nwonderful. And he was embracing me and \u201cThank God for you, that you are here,\u201d and that kind\nof a thing. And I says, \u201cAnd do you know whom you have here?\u201d He says, \u201cUnfortunately,\nyes.\u201d So, that was a bad experience for me, you know, that there are skinheads there. It was in\nNicholasville. But then I spoke many, many times in Nicholasville middle school, and when\nLaura was teaching, that was middle school. And that high school. I don\u2019t know what was the\nname of that high school. They were all girls, women, I mean, and one of them came to me.\nThey came after me and she said that, \u201cI thank you very much for coming because my father is\nGerman and he is telling an entirely different story and I knew that it\u2019s something wrong how he\nis telling it to us.\u201d So I had that kind of an experiences. Then it was non-stop, one school after\nthe other. Then it was in Paris, Kentucky. In Paris, Kentucky it was a professor in education.\nThat was George\u2019s department, education, I mean he was in Art and Education, two\nappointments. A very nice, very nice professor. And he had student teachers in Paris, Kentucky,\nand he took me to Paris, Kentucky. And some, they took videos there that day, but it was a very\nbig wind and the windows were open. They didn\u2019t have air conditioners. And the videos didn\u2019t\ncame out. Well, so he took me the second time and he took with him a professional videotaper\nfrom U.K. And I didn\u2019t know nothing, who else is there, but I saw that they are women there\nand they are taking pictures, too, from me. And they are writing. I had no idea that the paper is\nthere. He called The Herald. And that was the first time when I was in The Herald-Leader. And\nwhen I was in The Herald Leader, it was no stop. People were calling me. Schools were calling\nme, and I can tell you that I spoke in every school in Lexington, not once, because I spoke 160\ntimes already. Because usually I, they put together six, seven, eight grades usually in the\nauditort1um. And if the next bunch of kids comes, they call me back again. And in every high\nschool I spoke, too. In every high school. I spoke twice in Dunbar. In... what is that station?\nBryan Station, Bryan Station, they were very nice there. I spoke in Lafayette. Now I have to go\nagain. Because I spoke when Ilona was there and still the teacher is there and now Anna has the\nteacher. And she, he was asking whether your grandmother still does it. And Henry Clay, I\nspoke at Henry Clay. Twice I spoke already at the Community College. Three times at U.K. I\nspoke in the nurse\u2019s department, Psychiatric Nurses\u2019 department. And then the other was the\nMiddle Eastern studies, both of them twice. And...",
        "A: Very nice. Very, very nice. Very nice. Very, very nice. I cannot tell you, I have a whole\ndrawer, from letters, what they are doing, Montessori school. All the Montessori schools I\nspoke. There are three of them here. I spoke in Scapa, I don\u2019t know how many times. And what\nthey do, the Scapa... oh, I spoke, lately I spoke in the Adult Education at night. That\u2019s education\nat U.K. I have a series for the concerts, five tickets for the U.K... not U.K., concerts what they\nare doing, gosh, five a year. Five concerts, from all over the world they are coming. And the\nteacher, the professor that sits in front of me, she is a woman, but is George\u2019s colleague actually.\nSo, she never... I don\u2019t know, she was always afraid to ask me and we always talk to her. And a\nfew weeks ago, it was a concert and she turns around and she says, \u201cAre you alright?\u201d And I\nsays, \u201cYes, why?\u201d I wasn\u2019t all right the week before and George was there with Ana. And she\nsays, \u201cOh, can I ask you to talk?\u201d I says, \u201cOf course.\u201d And one of her students, they are all for\nMasters, teachers who are going for Masters. And one of her students is from Scapa. And she\u2019s\nher best friend. And that woman, she is a pastor\u2019s wife from the Lutheran church, Mrs. Gross.\nWonderful, wonderful person. I don\u2019t know how many times I spoke. And what she is doing,\nshe binds the books what the children are writing. The letters, and it\u2019s unbelievable what they\nare doing. And flowers they are giving me. And that professor, Dr. Backner, I don\u2019t know how\nmany times he took me. He was, unfortunately he didn\u2019t get tenure at U.K. because he wasn\u2019t\nwriting. But he said he didn\u2019t want the tenure. He was there six years. And then he was\nprincipal in Georgetown. And he called me there, too. I spoke in Georgetown for him, and he\npicks me up, and he takes me home, and in-between he takes me to a restaurant when he takes\nme home, to the nicest restaurants to eat. And it was an opening here in Lexington, what\u2019s it,\nLexington Traditional. It\u2019s on Nicholasville Road. And I asked him when he was in... because I\nspoke there two or three times and I knew it was an opening there for principal. And I ask him in\nGeorgetown whether he wants to come to Lexington. He lives here. And he says, \u201cWhy?\u201d I\nsays, \u201cBecause I know it\u2019s, I don\u2019t know the principal who is there, just in between.\u201d He lives,\nshe was, he was Laura\u2019s principal in Jesse Clark. He lives in our corner. And I said, \u201cIs Mr.\nMossgrave there?\u201d And he says, \u201cOh, not a bad idea.\u201d And then I spoke to Mossgrave. I says,\n\u201cWould you please call him because you are here only for a few months.\u201d [Laughing] Because\nhe is retired, and he works a few months only because of the Social Security probably. And he\ngot the job. He got the job. So I already spoke twice to him here, in . And last time his\nwife picked me up, and we met in the restaurant, Chaise (ph). And he came there from school\nand his daughter came, too. It\u2019s very interesting. His daughter was for a whole year in Belarus.\nVery interesting. She said, she loves the people there and she wants to learn the language. Very\nnice person. And both of them came to listen to me, too. The wife and the daughter, last time\nthat I spoke. It was the end of the year.",
        "A: Everything is coming up. I don\u2019t... if they give me enough time, I am telling them from\nbeginning to the end, everything. Memories are always with me, not coming up, they are always\nwith me. And I don\u2019t try to forget it. Sylvia tries to forget it. That\u2019s the difference between me\nand Sylvia. And it\u2019s a big difference, because she married an American man and she never had\nto talk about it. So it\u2019s a big difference. But she doesn\u2019t want to talk about it with me either.\nAnd she was in the same place. She was in Bergen-Belsen. And she doesn\u2019t want, she says what\nshe has left over, life, she wants to make it happy. I cannot forget it. I cannot erase it that they\nkilled my parents. I can\u2019t. And the six million people and everybody and big, big family from\nmy grandmother\u2019s side. I can\u2019t. I can\u2019t forget it, no one day. And I am dreaming about it,\nespecially when I\u2019m talking, I\u2019m dreaming. I said once to my heart doctor, I says, \u201cI just don\u2019t\nknow, I cannot sleep. Maybe I shouldn\u2019t talk anymore.\u201d He said, \u201cYou just take your pill and\ntalk.\u201d [Laughing] That\u2019s what he said. They are so funny the doctors. They have my pictures,\nwhen I am in the newspaper, they put it in they files. So, when they bring the files, here you are.\nIt\u2019s interesting. Yeah, lot of them.",
        "A: I, look, I have a guilt feeling always about my sister, yes. How 1s it that she said... it\u2019s fate. I\ndon\u2019t know. I have to come... I have to forget that guilt feeling, because I wasn\u2019t there. I wasn\u2019t\nthere. And I am sure that if I would be there, I would do the same thing. Because she had an\nopportunity to escape and she says, \u201cI go where my mother goes.\u201d And if I would be there, I\nwould do the same thing. I wasn\u2019t there. It was a coincidence. I had problem with my\nrheumatic fever that year and I had to go... my mother send me first. Every summer we spent\nthere in Budapest at my grandmother\u2019s house. And I took every year a cure for my rheumatic\nfever. When it was nothing wrong with me. The doctor said we should do it that it shouldn\u2019t\ncome back. And I had a doctor there, in one of those baths that they have. It\u2019s wonderful waters\nthey have. And he gave me a cure for three weeks. And it wasn\u2019t my fault that I wasn\u2019t there. I\nwas thinking about it many times. That I should make, I shouldn\u2019t be so guilty because it wasn\u2019t\nmy fault. First time in my life, I was 21, and first time in my life I was traveling alone. It was\n400 miles on the train to my grandmother. Because I finished school and my sister was still in\nschool, otherwise we would go together. The year before, Christmas, we went together with my\nsister. So it wasn\u2019t my fault. It was fate. It was fate. And when I was telling it in some schools\nand I says... children were asking me, how come that you survive? I says, \u201cThat\u2019s the only\nquestion I cannot answer you.\u201d And the principal, not principal, the Superintendent, I didn\u2019t\nknow that he was there. He said... he was sitting in the corner. \u201cI tell you why,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\nshe should spread it to the people.\u201d I says, \u201cThank you very much for helping me out, but I think\nmy sister could have spread it, too. So, it is nice that you think about it this way.\u201d",
        "A: I\u2019m every year alone in this house, now I don\u2019t go with them in the country. And this year I am\nthinking about it. That they really shouldn\u2019t do it, that they leave me alone here. I went with\nthem every year, but I don\u2019t know how many years now, about four years, I don\u2019t go because\nLaura wants to be alone with George. And he says we are here together the whole year, we are\ntogether. Though it\u2019s my house, I cannot go there. So, I went there three years ago. She went to\nHungary with Ana, because she was never in Hungary, Ana. She was never in Hungary. Ilona\nwas with me. I took Ilona. \u201989, after her, that was my Bat Mitzvah present to her in \u201889. I took\nher to Hungary for three weeks and one week in Vienna we were. And so, she went with Ana. I\ngave Ana her Bat Mitzvah present, the ticket, to go to Hungary. So Laura had a free ticket that\nshe\u2019s collecting, you know, the free flights. So they went to Hungary. And then I went for three\nweeks to the country and stayed with George. I had a great time. I had a great time. What\nshould I tell you. So, that\u2019s the situation. I won\u2019t go there now, sick as Iam. See we have\nalways only one car there, and I am depending on them. And it\u2019s not comfortable anymore. I\ntook now, when the children are there, upstairs the bedroom, because it\u2019s a... they made a\nwindow, you know, the skylight there. And they have air conditioner up there. I cannot go steps\nup again, and up and down. And they made a half bathroom there, I made. I had to pay half for\nit, the time that I am up there. And that\u2019s only half bathroom. If I want to take a bath, I have to\ngo downstairs. It\u2019s no more comfortable for me. It came to a point that it\u2019s no more\ncomfortable.",
        "A: It was my home. New York was my home. It was my home. I never, when I went even to\nHungary, I never said I\u2019m going home. That I can erase because of what they did to us. You\nknow? I was born there. And all the relatives there. But I never, never said \u201cI am going home.\nI am going to Hungary.\u201d New York was my home. I felt at home.",
        "A: No, no. The people are so far away from it. Even then, when it happened, I think, they were so\nfar away from it, that it\u2019s only me that I am afraid that 1t can happen and what can happen. It\u2019s\nonly me who went through. They are laughing when I am saying it, that I am afraid from\neverything. I am afraid of my shadow, you know, that kind of a situation. But no. When we\nwent to Hungary and they were asking us, \u201cHow could you live there? This is a jungle there, in\nNew York.\u201d You know? They have a very bad opinion of what\u2019s happening in New York. It\u2019s\nhappening here, too. This is much smaller and what\u2019s happening here, when you open the\ntelevision, they start the killing. Okay, it\u2019s a family killing or whatever but it\u2019s happening. It\u2019s\nhappening here, too. And it\u2019s always worse for the people who don\u2019t live in a place. You know,\nit seems much worse. I don\u2019t know. I wasn\u2019t afraid in New York where I lived. Once I was\nvery afraid, when I sold my house and I sold it to a Chinese guy, who, they knew that they have\nto give back Hong Kong, and they were coming. And he said that he wants it for his family.\nBaloney. He made a business from it. He made from a two-family house, four families. For\nmoney, he\u2019s getting rent. Unbelievable. From the basement he made two apartments and two\napartments what we had upstairs. I went to see it when... there\u2019s no garage. From the garage he\nmade an apartment. It\u2019s unbelievable. And he wanted to get out from it, the last minute. But he\nhad 25 thousand dollar, 25 put down? How much? I don\u2019t know how many thousands he had to\nput down when we made the agreement. It was in the lawyers, collateral, you know. And he\nwanted to, if he doesn\u2019t get the mortgage what he wants, that he can get out from it, but he got\nthe mortgage what he wanted. The lawyer find out he got the mortgage what he wanted. But he\nwanted a cheaper mortgage and he wanted to get out. But then he would lose that money. I\nthink it was 25. I don\u2019t remember. Anyway. And I was getting phone calls and it was a strange,\nstrange accent, that I am going to come and kill you. So then I said, \u201cMy God, I want to get out\nas early as can from here.\u201d You know? I think they were those people, those Chinese, I don\u2019t\nknow. Then I was very afraid. Though in the beginning I was very afraid, we were robbed. So I\nslept, not in our house, we lived in an apartment and we were one apartment, second apartment,\nwe were robbed. But that\u2019s why we bought the house, we went out from that neighborhood. But\notherwise, otherwise I didn\u2019t have that fear. I didn\u2019t go on the subways, I was driving. And it\nwas very dangerous already, in the hospital, too. So it was a parking lot across the street where I\npaid parking. And I just ran to the building. It was very dangerous. I got out at the last minute\nreally, because if you walked in the hospital itself, in the lobby, and you had a necklace on or\nsomething, people from outside came and they took it off. So it was a very dangerous place.\nAnd it is very interesting that every hospital in New York, it is in a bad place now. It is very\ninteresting. Even Flowers (ph), Fifth Avenue, my God, my husband was operated, spine\noperation and I went to visit him with George. Behind it there were big buildings and we had to\nget off the subway. And they were throwing bottles against us. That was the best hospital, the\nname Flower, Fifth Avenue. Can you imagine? That was years ago. Stay in Harlem, or no. So,\nwe came here. What I was seeing today on the television show, it\u2019s really scary, about five black\nguys, who are thieves. And that show is from New York, and how they are stealing cars and\nhow they are just bumping into people\u2019s cars. And then innocent women, they get out, what\nhappened. And they get out too, behind them and they grab their necks, put them in the other car\nbehind them and they take that car because it\u2019s a better car than theirs. There were five of them.\nCan you imagine that? I don\u2019t know how they can say it on the television this way. And there\nwas a detective there, too. And they were saying it, how they are show it how they are doing it\nand they are selling it. And she said, \u201cHow much you get for that car?\u201d She says, \u201cWe sell it for\nparts, 500 dollars. And if it\u2019s a Mercedes, a nice, new one, sometimes 5,000 dollars.\u201d This is,\nthis is, now again a more dangerous life since I came. They were stealing cars, of course they\nwere stealing cars, but that way I didn\u2019t hear it, never, when I was living there. So it\u2019s now 13\nyears.",
        "A: In New York?",
        "A: Actually no, because I am not... I think in this neighborhood, yes. I didn\u2019t experience it, but I\nhave a friend, who is married to a Chinese man. She\u2019s from Canada. And she, nobody was her\nfriend, only I. [Laughing.] But she lives here a long, long time, and her mother was Russian.\nAnd she was born in Canada. And she\u2019s telling me that this neighborhood, when she... they\nbuilded the house. They didn\u2019t allow Jews in this neighborhood. That was what she was telling\nme. And then I had a remark. Somebody came, I don\u2019t know who was it, those guys who are,\nyou know, trying to convert you. I don\u2019t know which religion was it. And I said, \u201cI am not\ninterested. I am Jewish.\u201d And he said, \u201cWhat is it, everybody is Jewish in this neighborhood?\u201d\nI says, \u201cNo, minority.\u201d They are all Baptist here, in this neighborhood. But now there are a few\nJewish families. But she said that they weren\u2019t allowed here in this neighborhood, Jews. I\ndidn\u2019t, as I said, I don\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t know about it. And she, she was unbelievable, they\ndidn\u2019t want to take her nowhere between them, because she was marrying to a Chinese. He is a\ngenius. He is now 70, I don\u2019t know, something. He got tenure. He was with IBM originally.\nAnd then he was teaching at UK. And now he is teaching in Frankfort in state university. And\nat age 70 they gave him tenure. He is such a genius. But he is Chinese. And she has two\nChinese, he has two daughters, a daughter and a son, both of them are doctors. And they were\nreally suffering in this neighborhood, she said, because they were Chinese kids. She was always\ntelling me what they went through. So, it\u2019s any difference, Chinese or Jew? If they don\u2019t, if it\u2019s\nnot their own, then they don\u2019t like you. I don\u2019t know. We are friends. With this building now.\nThose people lived before them a very long time here, 20 years. He was a pathologist and she\nwas Head of Pathology at UK. And we didn\u2019t go to each other\u2019s houses, but when we spoke we\nwere very nice. And her daughter, Jenna\u2019s daughter, when she got married in Louisville all the\nneighbors got together, five of us and we went all to the wedding, to her daughter\u2019s wedding,\nbecause she didn\u2019t have any family here. She doesn\u2019t have any family here. And because I am\nJewish and she is married to a Chinese [laughing] so we are very good friends. We are going\ntogether, she helps me enormously. She is a very good person. Now she was, she was nurse,\nactually. She went for nursing in Case Western, in Cleveland. She met him there somewhere, I\ndon\u2019t know, in Ohio. She... really, she felt it at UK. She was in the Nursing department and she\nwas the head of the private nurses at that time they had. And she had to give the patients the\nnurses. And she is absolutely, you know, she didn\u2019t know about discrimination. And she gave\nonce a black nurse to a white person. She was fired. And then when she was fired from there\nshe started to tutor. She is very good in math. And she tutored all the kids from this\nneighborhood. She knows everybody because she was a tutor. And from that, because it was not\nenough what her husband made, they send the two children to medical school. The daughter is a\npsychiatrist and she is having now the first baby, she is waiting every minute, though she is 35\nyears old. Yeah, she is. And she lives in Louisville. And the son is in Louisville, too. He is a\ngeneral practitioner, but he wanted to be a surgeon.\nEnd of Tape 6, Side A\nTape 6, Side B",
        "A: ...here that Iam accepted. I think because of the speeches, that\u2019s why. Many people know me,\nand many people want me, and many people are very grateful that I am teaching and I am\nteaching the children about history, what is not, unfortunately, not in history books. It\u2019s only a\nfew words about the Second World War, the Holocaust. And I don\u2019t know whether it ever will\nbe. And they are very grateful and gracious. And really they do everything for me. They pick\nme up, they take me home, they take me to eat. They give me presents. It\u2019s unbelievable what\nthey are doing, those people. And I think that it\u2019s sincere.
