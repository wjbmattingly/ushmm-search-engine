But I had been,\nI've been part of a displaced persons team. It was called\nDP 2, attached to first army. And we were the, I guess the\nshowplace team of our first army, whenever somebody wanted\nto see a displaced person program, they brought them around\nto where we were. I joined the team in nineteen, well I\nguess, forty-four, in the fall, and uh, apparently there\nwere some problems there, and the captain had done something\nhorrible and they threw him out, and I became temporarily in\ncharge of the camp until they found an American captain. At\nthat time the team was composed of both American allied\nofficers and American enlisted personnel. And uh, at that\ntime uh, they were in Vervier, Belgium, which was\u2019 probably\nseveral miles from the Malbadies, town of Malbadie, and uh\nwe had several French officers, Belgian, Dutch, I think,\nattached to us. And uh we operated a program up until the\ntime of the uh, so-called bulge. And uh we were ordered not\nto leave this displaced persons camp because it would have\nessentially started a riot in the town. And uh, we were\nlucky that the war, that not the war but the Malbadie pushed\nthe bulge uh, collapsed uh, after a week and a half, when",
        "the Americans were able to use their air power, but when the\nfog lifted from the Malbadie forest. And uh, then around\nthe first of the year, I came down with uh, and we _ had,\nprior to that time, we had, during the period of the bulge,\nwe either had air attacks or shelling because we had\nexplosions in the courtyard and, which knocked out our\nutilities there. We had about 500 displaced persons of\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ 2/10/95 Int MILTON SHURR\nPage 2\ndifferent nationalities. And uh so we had to dig = slit\ntrenches and so on. And bring in water, and so on, to keep\nthings going. So we had a lot of uh-g-good experience in\ndisaster in emergency problems. Then I came down with\nHepatitis, about the first of the year, and uh, was~ sent\nfirst to Paris, then England, for a period of treatment\nconvalescence. And I returned to the uh, to rejoin the\ngroup, in April. And uh, I learned that our particular\ndetachment was in Vetzlar, Germany, ina large uh barracks\narea, taking care of displaced persons. The time I arrived,\nwhich was probably the middle of the day, I had heard, when\nI got there, I had heard that they had left, for Buchenwald.\nSo I got transportation to Buchenwald, and arrived there,",
        "around dinnertime. And uh, I was made officer of a guard\nfor the evening, and estab- was established in uh, in one of\nleft side of that, uh, the typical concentration camp en\ntrance. You'd, you-you'd see a two story building with a\ntower and uh there were offices on each side and uh I was\nSitting in one of the offices of one of the SS personnel,\nand uh, there was a lot of coming and going of third army\npersonnel, and uh, I quickly learned that uh, a lot of the\nenlisted personell and others of third army were uh seizing\nall of the lampshades that were made out of uh = skin. Uh,\nthose, that was one of the hobbies of Ilsa Koch, who was the\nwife of the agita [?] in charge of the um concentration\ncamp. And uh, so I managed to save a few pieces, walked\nthem up at the desk, knowing that eventually there would\nhave to be some criminal investigation. And these were\nsaved and turned over later to uh the personnel. Uh there\nwas a lot of confusion, uh, the uh camp, like all big camps\nseems almost to run itself. Uh by decentralization, and uh,\nthe uh, each barracks had a nationality group. And they\nwere horrible places, as you've seen pictures, you know, you\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ 2/10/95 Int MILTON SHURR\nPage 3",
        "had two, uh, a two-story set of bunks in which they put\nabout six people ina little slot of maybe about eight feet,\nuh, wide. And almost if somebody turned I guess the whole\npeople would have go, you know, uh turn with them. Uh they\nwere horrible places and they smelt to high heaven. And uh,\nI don't know whether we had the same uh kapos as they were\ncalled as the Germans had, but obviously uh, many did pick\nnew-new people. And I used to meet with this group every\nmorning, and they'd tell me what the problems were in the\ncamp. About food, about clothing, and so forth and so on.\nAnd many of these ex-prisoners would grab ae bicycle,\nmotorcycle, or whatever, and they would, they were chasing\naround all over the area. And they would tell us about a\num, a barn full of shoes, auh, a uh warehouse full of flour\nor wheat or whatever. And then the seargant and I would go\ndown uh his pick up truck, look it over, if we thought it\nwas worthwhile, we then would have one of our trucks. Now,\nthe, our team uh had as its basic transportation, two jeeps,\nuh with two trailers. And uh, we'd had a lot of experience\nusing captured German equipment, French equipment, what not.\nAnd so uh, the uh, these fellows managed to get two diesel\nfive-ton trucks, and uh, stole or borrowed, uh, tires and\nwhat not. And we established our own, little uh garage.\nAnd uh, what we had really was kind of a hot car. racket.\nThey would spray the captured stolen German trucks and spray\nthem olive drab and we would then put some fake ordnance\nnumbers on and we were off and running. Uh, and uh, you\nknow... Actually it got so bad that I had civilian people",
        "coming in and saying they lost their car and uh more than\nonce I would discover a car had blue paint under the olive\ndrab and we would return it to the Germans. About, we would\ngo down and, and uh, to the various town, or village, and\ntake whatever we thought we could need. And we had _ the\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ 2/10/95 Int MILTON SHURR\nPage 4\nhighest priority after the United States army. The United\nStates army wasn't seizing any food or clothes, and so_ we\nliterally took everything we had. And in the period of\nabout, oh, two months or so, we pretty much cleaned up the\narea between Leipzig and way down into the forest area. Uh,\nand uh, you know, it was, and we had a lot of complaints.\nThe captain would come to me and, say well I shouldn't do\nthat, and so forth and so on, and uh, I would disregard him,\nI just felt so strongly that people who had suffered as much\nas these unfortunate uh people and just by luck survived,\nShouldn't, you know, have any more problems. And uh what\nhappened of course at Buchenwald, there were 15000 survi\nvors, over a period of the several years in the camp, which\nfirst took prisoners and uh were criminals, and then uh,\nvarious displaced persons, uh, for political reasons or",
        "others. And they were kept there. During that period, I\nthink about 50,000 had died according to the inmates. And\nuh they did have a, at one time, a little exhibition of uh\nfloats and other things that they'd put up and these\npictures are in the museum, Holocaust museum. When our,\nwhen we arrived, of course there was confusion. And uh my\nfirst, our first concern, perhaps the captain or somebody\nordered, a uh, field hospital, to come in and spray DDT\nwhich brought the typhus epidemic under control. People\nwere dying at the rate of 300 a day from malnutrition,\nStarvation, or disease as the case may be. Gradually the\nthing got under control. Now everybody's always excited\nabout the heaps of, dea-, of the dead that were seen in most\nof these camps, and uh they were horrible cause you say the\nevidence of starvation. Uh, people had about 600 calories a\nday which was enough to keep them alive for six months or\nless, depending on uh disease and other problems. Luck...\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ 2/10/95 Int MILTON SHURR\nPage 5\n[CAMERA RELOAD]",
        "[CR#2 ]\nSWB: Okay, you were talking about the piles of bodies.\nMILTON SHURR: Oh yes. Well uh-th-p-and in Buchenwald, at\nany rate, the pile of bodies was really occasioned by the\nfact they ran out of coal. And uh, so they couldn't have\nbeen consumed in a crematorium. And the captain apparently\ngot the burgermeister and uh some of the townspeople to come\nin and help bury the bodies, uh, if, they probably used\nbulldozers some other things. Uh, but it was ae horrible\nlooking thing and of course that, that caught all the\ninterest, pictures that saw it. It was uh, it was a\nterrible thing, the, you know, slow starvation, people\nworked in the quarries, and uh, they assembled uh, in\nBuchenwald uh, binoculars, small arms and things like that.\nThere was no factories there. Uh, so the, the people who\nhad tended to survive either had jobs peeling potatoes or\nsome access to the uh kitchen or whatever, so they, they got\nby. The uh, lot of very important personalities, and\npolitical scene like Leon Blum, and one of the royal family\nof Italy uh, were political prisoners there at one time.\nAnd it had some criminals there too, and, it wasn't a very\npleasant place. Um, I operated, I was able to survive\nreally. We worked, I w-, um, I worked, anyway, about\nSixteen hours a day trying to find food, and I probably made\na mistake, I should have relied more on the federal\ngovernment. But many of the other camps used to come to our\ncamp to get bread and other things because they just",
        "couldn't handle. Uh, I operated on the basis of, of really\nuh, decentralization of authority. Um, one of my colleagues\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ 2/10/95 Int MILTON SHURR\nPage 6\nwho was senior to me uh, spoke German, very fluent German,\nand he was listening to everybody's problems. And uh, as a\nresult uh, he became very much emotionally upset and became\ninsane, and uh, had to be taken away. He came back, but he\nnever made it, uh, he never recovered. And I refused to\ntalk to people. Everybody, each one had the most horrible\npersonal story, they, they were looking for loved ones,\nrelatives and so on, and uh, I, I would say, you're just\ngoing to have to wait until Red Cross or somebody else gets\nin the camp. And uh I just refused to get into individual\ncase work, uh services. You can't, you couldn't and do...\nwhat I had to do was just keep people alive till such a time\nas they can be repatriated. And of course, immediately, uh,\nthe Germans were released to go to their hospitals or\nwherever. All the allied personnel, there were French,\nGerman, English, a few American aviators who were caught out\nof uniform. All were returned to their respective, uh,\nforces. And we were left in a camp with Russians, Poles,",
        "EFastern Europeans of various descriptions, and at a later\nstage, those who wanted to go west, particularly the Poles\ncould elect to do so, or if they wanted to return to their\nown country. And it was, sort of all the educated, of\ncourse, wanted to go west, the less educated wanted to back\nto their land. And uh then we, later on, we had a new\ninfusion of people who were Russians and Poles and, and\nYugoslavs, Hungarians, who wanted to go back east. SO we\nhad a shifting population, but it was always about the same\nsize.\nSWB: Tell me, did you do something to replace the existing\nKapos.\nMILTON SHURR: As far as I know, I don't know whether we\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ 2/10/95 Int MILTON SHURR\nPage 7\nwere using the new or the old, but I was using people who\nwould tell me what the problems were, where there were\nsources of food that they had learned, and so forth and _ so\non. And this was my intelligence network. Uh, when the Red\nCross came in I said well, your job is to work with the",
        "people to answer their questions and problems concerning uh\nthe location of relatives. The joint distribution committee\ncame in and, I've hav- I having worked in Oklahoma City uh,\nas head up of the Jewish community council there, you know,\nI knew all about welfare and coordination planning and the\njoint distribution came in, I said great, I said, uh, we\nhave a uh large barracks full of almost 2000 Jewish\nchildren, and uh, I haven't even seen them. And this is\nyour job. And I fixed them up an office, and typewriters,\nso on, same thing with the Red Cross. So I attempt to\ndecentralize what went on, and the result is, I concentrated\non what I thought were the high priorities, of health and\nsafety and nutrition for the groups. And I probably made a\nmistake, I probably should have relied more on the uh army\nto supply us with supplies instead of knocking myself out,\nbut that's water over the dam. Finally, about, we were\nthere from April and the whole area of Thoringia, province\nof Thoringia, was turned over to the Russians according to\nagreement of uh July first. So that, oh, sometimes about,\nbe- sometimes in June, we were running out of food and uh I\nwent to the army headquarters which was right outside of\nWeimarr, and uh, talked to the colonel, in charge of supply\nand I said that we had exploited the area on our own for oh\nthree months, and we were running out of food and we needed\nsome help. Well, he said, I, we can't do anything for you.\nSo I said, well, I, the only thing I can do is open up the\ngates and let these people go out into the town of Weimarr\nand seek whatever they want and so on. And I said you will",
        "Working transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ 2/10/95 Int MILTON SHURR\nPage 8\nbe responsible for their public safety of the town. Now he\ngot the message and we got the food, but this was the, uh, I\nwas a, I was a second lieutenant then promoted to first\nlieutenant, but you know I, I had had my fill of all these\nuh, so-called lieutenant colonels and colonels uh, who uh,\nreally, hiding behind rules and so on, and uh I had _ other\nexperiences. But this one was the last major one I had, and\nI had no compunction about it. I said, if you, if you think\nyou want to send me home in irons I'd be glad to, I said, I\nworked like a dog, and I said, I'd be glad to get some rest.\nAnd so you know we prevailed and uh that's what happened and\nuh so, but it was a real problem, and uh, it was uh, and as\nI look back apparently I never realized that uh, this\nfamous, what's the name, uh, we spokesman for the\nconcentration camp, what was that Weisel, Wiesel, can't\npronounce the name... um, you know it was also one of my\nchildren, you know, I never even laid my hands and eyes\u2019 on\nhim, I just couldn't, didn't have the time, and uh, this is\npretty much how you could survive ina uh you know, running\na city of people, uh all injured by indirection. But we\nwere very experienced personnel, for example, uh, we had",
        "requisitioned a ton of captured German cigarettes, and we\nused that to pay the Polish displaced persons who would man\nour two uh diesel trucks that we carried food, and uh, we\nhad a young man who was the son of a Czech family promi\nnently in the steel business, uh who uh was edu-, who was\nbrought up with a Scotch nanny and he spoke impeccable\nEnglish, spoke uh Polish, Russian, German, whatever. And he\nwas our interpreter, and uh working with this Polish group.\nSo this is pretty much, you know, how we, how we got along,\nand uh...\nSWB: Tell me about the dogs. Did you see some, the dogs\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ 2/10/95 Int MILTON SHURR\nPage 9\nleft by the SS.\nMILTON SHURR: Uh no, I had heard that there were a few dogs\nleft by the SS, and the surviving prisoners who uh, were\nmore able, they just strangled the dogs. Uh, everybody\ntalks about liberating Buchenwald. Well, Buchenwald was\nlike the, like Rome, you know, during the days of the\nVandals. When the SS heard that the first or third army was",
        "coming down the road, they just took off. And uh, and the\nAmericans just walked in, and then they walked out again.\nSo even-he-so when people talk about Jliberators, uh you\nknow, it really is in this sense, for example, was I a\nliberator, I wasn't a liberator, I was a, one of the people\nassigned to create order and stability in a situation that\nwas very chaotic. And uh, we had so much good experience in\nthe previous year running camps and so on, that everybody\nknew their job and, you know, it was an efficient, small but\nefficient team. We had some Polish, we had some rather\nUkrainian hangers-on, we had about ten, uh, Dutch people,\nmostly young men, who, for the lock of it, worked with us,\nyou know, just to be with us. It was great fun for them.\nSo we had this informal group running the camp and everybody\nhad a good time doing a job. They worked hard and uh, this\nis how, how we operated. And uh, I don't\u2019 know, our team\ncould have handled a large camp like Dachau or _ something\nelse because uh Buchenwald was relatively a small camp,\nalthough had 15,000 survivors, but, you know, it was\u2019 small\nby comparison to these other camps in terms of physical\nproperties and so on. Uh I had a number of little things\nthat I had picked up which I turned over to the Holocaust\nMuseum.\n[END |\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.",
