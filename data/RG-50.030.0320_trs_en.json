        "Q: Let's start with where you were born and your names at birth and now. Let's start with\nyou Irene.\nI: I was born in Teplice Sanov in Czechoslovakia in the year 1937, and I was named Renate\nGuttmann, and I'm now Irene Hizme.",
        "Q: Now what was the date?\nI: 1937.",
        "Q: No, the month?\nI: Sorry, December 21.\nR: I was born at the same time, half hour later. My name then was Ren\u00e9 Guttmann and\ntoday is Ren\u00e9 Slotkin.",
        "Q: Now you were very young during these early years of the Nazi oppression and\npersecution, but I really would like to see what it is that you remember as far back as you can go.\nDo you remember those first few years where? You were born in Teplice Sanov, but you didn't\nlive there for very long?\nI: No. We moved to Prague and were there for a while.\nR: My earliest memories of being alive go to that apartment building in Prague. It was\nmaybe a like five or six story building brick with a yard and a fence. I remember a staircase\nleading up to our apartment so we had to be somewhere up.\nI: Yeah, I think we were on the upper floor.\nR: Upper floors, and I do remember falling once and I have an injury here, which I haven't\nthought about in a long time, but I must have stitches underneath my chin. I still remember the\nburning sensation of what I guess was iodine, was the first aid that I got for that. But I do\nremember that apartment building. Those are my earliest, very earliest memories, my first\nmemories.",
        "Q: You slept in the same crib?\nR: I don't remember doing that.\nI: Either in the same crib or right next or our cribs were like touching. My recollection\nreally is, and I know I've told you this once before, that our mother, when she would put us to\nsleep she played a game with us, there was a game. She would set our hands and we always\nwanted our bodies to be set a certain way to see if we could stay that way all night long and wake\nup in that same position. So I remember that.\nR: This is incredible. I'm learning this. I never heard this.\nI: I remember that, yes.",
        "Q: Did she make up this game or did you make it up?\nI: I'm not sure.\nR: I would think it had to be her, but that's interesting.",
        "Q: What other recollections? Do you remember playing outside? Do you remember the\npeople around you?\nI: I don't remember the people around us so much, but I know that once Ren\u00e9 \u2014 there was\na yard in front with grass and Ren\u00e9 was out there playing. I think he stepped on a bumblebee\nand he got bitten and I think that was \u2014\nR: That was a big impression made on me. As a matter fact, I had itches underneath on that\nfoot even when I came to the States, which was in 1950. I always get an itch on the one, but I\ncould never understand. But I do remember that incident. I put it together. I don't know\nwhether it's a real physiological phenomena or just my mind playing tricks on me. But, yeah. I\nremember the grass.\nI: You know, I also remember, do you remember that we had like conductor outfits and\npunching tickets to go on the train and we used to play train, train conductors?\nR: Well, that brings to mind, I think there was a tram or something that ran near us.\nI: In front of the house.\nR: Number 22.\nI: Twenty-two, right.\nR: I wouldn't know it was 22 until now, but it looked like two twos, so now we know it's a\n22.\nI: That was one of our favorite games. I think we also \u2014 I remember we had some kind of\ncar that we could sit in and drive. I don't \u2014 we used to race, but you used to beat me all the\ntime.\nR: See, she's older, obviously \u2014she remembers these things.\nI: I remember one particular time we used to go \u2014 our parents took us to the park. There\nwas a park nearby. And we used to go quite a bit, but the one time that I remember especially\nwas right after a major storm and a lot of trees had fallen and we were walking on the logs,\ntrying to balance, and I think\u2014\nR: That must be the same storm that I'm talking about except I saw it from upstairs. We\nmust have gone down.\nI: I think we went down. I remember that, there's something about the air. You know you\nhow sometimes that smell \u2014 it brings it back, even today, sometimes I'm out and I get a certain\nsmell and it says \u2014 that's the park. Also, I remember that we had \u2014 I'm not sure whether it was\ntrucks or what, but some kind of toys that we could pull, like little wooden something. And we\nalso had wooden little blocks, tiny little blocks, and you were very good at making.",
        "Q: Do you remember your parents?\nR: I don't, I really don't. I've tried and even I've had visual aids since, I've gotten some\npictures of them, but it still doesn't seem to help. I've tried to really. There's just one moment\nthat I remember that happened much later with my mom that I remember, but not at that point in\ntime.\nI: I think I'm pretty \u2014 I could not, if I didn't have photographs, I don't think I could recall\nwhat they looked like. The only thing I remember is my mom's presence at certain times. I\nrecall them vividly. And also, my dad in \u2014 one of the things that I vividly do remember 1s when\nhe was taken away, and I think it was at night and some men came in uniform and they just took\nhim away and, you know, we never saw him again after that, not to my recollection. Although,\nRen\u00e9, you've said you remember us visiting him in prison, but I don't remember.\nR: I don't know.\nI: No?\nR: We didn't see him then.\nI: I don't remember seeing him.\nR: I remember going to what I \u2014 assuming was some kind of \u2014 it was a huge building. To\nme, any building was \u2014 it was very powerful looking, as opposed to the other buildings and we\nwould bring \u2014 my mother and I would bring, we \u2014 we would bring packages there. So, maybe.\nI: So maybe \u2014but I don't...",
        "Q: Do you remember seeing soldiers in the street? Did you remember something that\nchanged in Prague prior to your dad being taken?\nI: I don't think I remember anything changing, but I think there was a feeling. I remember\nhaving to wait, standing on lines. I don't know whether this is a later occurrence or from that\ntime, but I just remember having to stand on lines. It could be, I don't know from where.",
        "Q: For food?\nI: Maybe, maybe, I'm not \u2014 yes, maybe that's what it was.",
        "Q: Do you remember any change? I know that you don't remember your mother in the\nvisual sense, but do you remember a change in the household somehow after your father was\ntaken or was it not that clear?\nI: I don't think it was that clear. I have a feeling my mom didn't say anything to us and I\nthink that we probably felt our dad was going to come back.\nR: Yeah. I don't think there was any change. The time just melted.",
        "Q: You were about what, four years old in here?\nI: Yes.\nR: Four.",
        "Q: So that's about 1941, maybe '42?\nR: No, no.",
        "Q: What is the next kinds of recollection that you have? Going to Theresienstadt?\nI: My next recollection 1s truthfully being on a train.\nR: Being there.\nI: No. I remember a train.\nR: You got an earlier \u2014. I just remember being there.\nI: And it seemed like a normal train. It was a train ride and then we were someplace else\nand I guess that was Theresienstadt.\nR: I just remember being there. I don't remember getting there. Maybe I slept.",
        "Q: And you lived with your mother?\nI: Yes, we were with our mom.",
        "Q: What do you remember about Theresienstadt? School, food? Was your mother\nworking?\nI: I really have very sketchy remembrances. I just \u2014 I remember cobblestone roads for\nsome reason. And I remember archways \u2014 like tunnel like \u2014 I have no idea, it could be\nsomeplace else. I have this flashing thing of bodies in an open cart.\nR: I was just going to get to that. I remember carts being drawn through the streets. I knew\nthey were bodies. I don't remember them being open, but I knew that they were \u2014 don't know\nhow, but that seems to be in the picture very, very often.\n* Danuta Czech, Auschwitz Chronicle, 1939-1945 (New York: H.\nHolt, 1990).",
        "Q: Why not?\nI: We were scared. We knew that crying was not something you did. You didn't cry.\nR: I don't think we wanted to add anything to that noise there already. It was a long train\nride.\nI: We had already learned the need to be silent to be quiet and well behaved.\nR: Probably.",
        "Q: Can I go back for just a minute?\nI: Sure.",
        "Q: Do you think you were afraid in Theresienstadt? Do you have any recollection of being\nafraid?\nR: For our personal safety?\nI: I don't think so, no.\nR: I mean, we saw these things going on and I think we just assumed that this is the way\nthings are. I think our mother must have provided, I'm not just guessing, must have provided us\nwith a real security type of blanket that we weren't, or it was our youth and we really didn't\nunderstand.",
        "Q: On the train, how were the adults \u2014 well, was anybody relating to anybody else? Were\nsome people talking or was there just a lot of noise people screaming? What other recollections\ndo you have? Was your mother holding you? You holding onto your mother's leg?\nR: We were very close to her at all times. I think everybody was into their own \u2014 I don't\nremember people mixing or doing for one another.",
        "Q: Do you remember smells?\nR: Oh yeah. It was strong.\nI: It was terrible.\nR: Every kind of smell, excretion, either from the bottom or from throw up or \u2014 there was\njust no sanitation, nothing. Wherever you were, that's where it happened.",
        "Q: So you also urinated or moved your bowels there or do you have a recollection?\nR: I don't remember.\nI: I don't remember that.\nR: My mother must have taken care of that. She always had, right?\nI: I would imagine.",
        "Q: Do you remember arriving at this strange place that now has a name?\nR: Uh-hum, yeah.\nI: Yep.",
        "Q: Describe it.\nR: It was night. I heard yelling \"Raus,*\" snowing a little bit too, I think.\nI: Yes.\nR: And it was refreshing at first, when they first opened the doors. I mean we had air for the\nfirst time, and it just hit you, it was good, but then the rest of it started happening.\nI: I remember just that we had to walk a little. I don't know if it was a long distance. It's\nhard to tell, but we walked and then I remember finding \u2014 we all, everybody off of that,",
        "Q: But the three of you were together?\nI: Yes.\nR: You say that with great certainty, so you remember? I mean, I think we were, too.\nI: Oh, yes I remember being together.\nR: I don't remember my mother. I'm trying so hard to do that.\nI: I remember being together and then at some point our mom even took us to the hospital\nto have a medical examination and this I remember because \u2014 sorry, Ren\u00e9 \u2014 you used to cry a\nlot. You didn't like doctors, and I was only worried that you were going to cry and something\nterrible was going to happen to you because I was a stoic.\nR: I cried?\nI: You didn't, not that time. But I remember that our mom took us. She was with us once.",
        "Q: This was at some point?\nI: At some point.",
        "Q: Do you remember being tattooed?\nR: Yes. I remember being tattooed. I remember the pain of the needle as they made the\ndots, and just surrounding it was this awful odor and I'm not sure what that odor was, but the\ntattooing comes together with an odor for me. So \u2014 but I don't remember anything else but just\nthat needle.",
        "Q: But your numbers are quite different, so you were not tattooed at the same time or you\ndon't know?\nR: I don't know.\nI: I think we were.\nR: I mean, we now know that the numbers that were given to girls and to boys were different\nso we know this for a fact now. So, the numbers wouldn't be sequential, but I don't remember\nanybody else being tattooed except myself. I mean, I don't remember Irene being tattooed or my\nmother being tattooed.\nI: I don't have much of a recollection of the tattooing.\nR: You don't remember the tattooing? Such a sharp \u2014.\nI: Yeah, but I don't know...\nR: We remember different things.",
        "Q: And your hair, were you shaved?\nI: No.\nR: I don't think so.\nI: No, absolutely not. I had long hair at the end of the war.",
        "Q: Were you with other families?\nI: In the beginning, when we were with my mom, it seemed like there were grown ups and\nyounger people and so I guess. I didn't really know. It seemed like a lot of different ages.",
        "Q: Was it possible that you were in the family camp, the Czech family camp?\nI: Very possible.",
        "Q: Do you remember food during this time when you were still with your mother?\nI: My only recollection of food is always the same. It's that black bread and something like\npotatoes or vegetable something, warm something.\nR: I don't have any recollection of food until later when I had to \u2014 when we were separated\nand I had to sift through garbage to get at potatoes. That seemed to have been my favorite thing.\nI would get a potato, make very thin slices and put it onto that stove. Most of the potatoes were",
        "Q: Do you remember when you were separated?\nR: Yes.",
        "Q: Could you describe it?\nR: Well, to me it wasn't our separation to me, it was a feeling, it was a separation from my\nmother. She was, like, \u2014 she was taken away from us. I'm not sure what I heard or what I felt,\nbut it was my mother and that was the only time that I felt that she was in real agony. It was a\nfeeling, maybe a cry out or something, but I knew something was terribly, terribly wrong and\nthat was the separation that I remember.\nI: I also remember it a little differently, but...\nR: Well, it's probably more accurate...\nI: No, no.",
        "Q: I think we should stop.\n(Pause on tape)",
        "Q: Since you were separated at this point, what I would like to do, is focus on each of your\nstories separately although, of course, you can talk or elaborate if someone forgets something.\nSo, let's focus on you, Irene, and where you remember you were and what happened?",
        "Q: Was anybody kind to you?\nI: I really, I can't remember. I felt no, it didn't seem to be \u2014 I always felt just outside\nsomehow. I remember being a little jealous because it seemed like there was, there were two\ngirls and it seemed like their mother \u2014 I don't know how they had a mother or somebody who\nwould bring them things.\nR: Little girls? They were little girls?\nI: No, bigger than me, but they had somebody who brought them things, who was very\nclose to them somehow and I remember, you know, kind of watching with great deal of envy.",
        "Q: Did you know you were twins?\nI: No, no, I don't think so. I knew I had a brother, but I had no idea of what twin even\nmeant. In all of this, everything that happened, I always just thought this was what life was. I\ncouldn't remember anything else anymore, and I used to think sometimes about our mother,\nfleetingly, like, \u201cWell, maybe I'm never supposed to see her again \u2014 this is how things are.\u201d\nAnd then just knowing that there was Ren\u00e9 over there. And then I remember one particular night\nthat I was especially concerned about Ren\u00e9, because there was like a big explosion, and there\nwas a fire and it was all off to that side, to the right. I remember lying on my bunk bed and there",
        "Q: Did you think about him a lot?\nI: In some way, I did. I kind of felt I had to stay in there because he was going to need me.\nThat's pretty egotistical. Well...",
        "Q: Do you remember other young girls in the same barrack? Were you with other people\nwho also had these funny things happening to them, these horrible medical experiments?\nI: I thought I was the only one. In fact, it's interesting, when in 1985, when we first found\nout there were other twins who survived Auschwitz, I said to Ren\u00e9, \u201cI thought we were the only\nkids who survived, how could there be anybody else, what you do mean there are twins?\u201d So,\nno, I had no idea that anybody else was having anything done to them.",
        "Q: Are there any other things you want to tell us about Auschwitz before the liberation?\nI: I remember once in the hospital there, I was there and something was going to happen. It\nseemed all the patients were being evacuated or cleared out or something and I remember\nsomebody who worked in the hospital grabbed me and hid me behind her and just said, \u201cbe very\nquiet.\u201d Of course I was. I mean, if I could have disappeared I would have, and that's all I know.\nI don't know who it was and I don't know what she might have saved me or not saved me from.\nAnd so that...",
        "Q: Were you ever beaten?\nI: No, no, not that I \u2014 no.",
        "Q: Do you remember getting weaker and weaker?\nI: Yes, Ido. I remember getting weaker and weaker because towards the end just before\nliberation, I was on the ground and I could not even get up. And there were other people also on\nthe ground to my recollection, and I didn't know if I was ever going to be able to get up off this\nfloor. But I don't think I understood what \u201cto be dead\u201d meant even then, because I just didn't\nknow what was going to be. I remember there were also, I remember sirens and bombings,\nnoise, gun fire or maybe bombs. I'm not sure. Do you remember that at all? Sirens?\nR: Yes, I remember sirens and then the hum of the airplanes and they would always get\neverybody in and they would stand a soldier outside our barrack, one soldier outside the barrack.\nDon't know why.",
        "Q: Were you liberated in Auschwitz by the Russians? You may not have known that...\nI: Yes. I might not have known that that's what it was. I was literally picked up by a Polish\nlady who just took me to her home. I remember she carried me on her shoulders the whole way,\nbecause I couldn't, couldn't walk.",
        "Q: You were eight?\nI: Yes. Going to be eight \u2014\nR: You were, you were \u2014 your seventh year is December. You turned seven in December.\nI: Oh, I had just turned seven.\nR: You were just a little bit over seven. Same as me \u2014 that's how I remember.\nI: Good point.",
        "Q: Rene, let's go to you and your months now in Auschwitz as you're alone.\nR: Well, I'm going to juxtaposition my things with hers. The long waits and roll calls,\nsomething that we mentioned before. The wires, yes, electric, every once in a while, somebody\nwould go against those wires and then be still, but the wires to me were always near my barrack\nfor some reason, were the backdrop of a hole, a long, deep ditch where I remember very often,\nvery, very often they would just line up people and shoot them, because I remember as me and\nsome other young youngsters, we went over to see what was happening to some of those people.\nI do remember one instance, where the person wasn't quite dead. He didn't stop moving. I do\nremember him having a big bump on his head and the people, there some of the people, actually",
        "Q: There were older men in your barrack?\nR: Yes.",
        "Q: Were there older women in your barrack, too?\nI: Yes.\nR: And I was very close to the crematoria, because there was a constant flow of people\ngoing into this and nobody every coming out. I was very close to that road. I was, like, very\nclose to the barracks. I always had a view of that.",
        "Q: Could you smell?\nR: Yes. The odor was just bad. It was just bad. Everything there was bad. Foul, all the\nodors were foul except for that wood.\n* x-ray (German)",
        "Q: Did you have showers with some regularity?\nI: Yes.\nR: I don't remember any showers at all, but that doesn't mean.... I do remember though, I\ndid see Irene once. I saw her once across \u2014 a wire fence. I don't know whether I was walking\nto the hospital myself, but I saw her somewhere in the middle and I recognized her. Nothing was\nsaid and I just looked at her and I knew she was there. I don't know if she remembers the\nmoment, but I always, from that point on, and I think maybe even before, I knew that she was\nalive. It was the inspiration, it was the motivation to keep me going. I knew I had to stay, stick\naround and do until I met her for her sake, or for whatever sake, but I knew that you were there\nsomewhere there and in a certain direction.\nI: I don't really recall the moment, though I'm really trying hard to see if I can, but I do, I\nmust in some ways recall it on a different level, because I knew that you were alive, so I must\nhave known because then later on, after liberation, I knew that you were alive, so perhaps I did\nsee you and I just don't recall it.\nEnd of Tape 1",
        "Q: Rene, you were describing \u2014 not individual people, but, in some way, the relationships\nthere. Did you feel less alone than, than Irene described herself? Or did you feel...\nR: I would have to think that I wasn't alone. I was with other people. I did not, however,\nthink of Irene or my mother. I just accepted what was there and went with it.",
        "Q: Did you ever cry?\nR: I don't remember. I'm sure I did, but I don't remember crying, no. Just to catch up to\nIrene's liberation, I was also liberated pretty much at the same time, but under totally different\ncircumstances. I remember before the end came, the end of Auschwitz, the liberation, there was\nan increased amount of noise, which I now know was gun fire around, and less of a German\npresence. We were marched somewhere from some point to somewhere and whoever couldn't\ndo this marching, if they stepped out of line or fell down, they were just eliminated, so I knew I\nhad to keep marching. Again, there was increased gun fire at this point, I'd have to say it was,\nand then all of a sudden the Germans were gone. They were just gone, and we were surrounded\nby these white uniformed \u2014 which I know were Russians now. That's how my liberation \u2014 I do\nhave to insert, that I do remember one Russian solider, officer on a horse, which to me looked\npink. It looked like a pink horse to me, but that's one of the memories, and the white uniforms.\nDefinitely white uniforms.",
        "Q: Was it night or day?\nR: Night.",
        "Q: What languages were you speaking in Auschwitz?\nR: That's a good question, because I just thought of it myself and I don't really remember\nwhether it was or what it was.\nI: Actually, we spoke German and Czech, because I did understand what \u2014 I understood\nwhat was going on around me.\nR: Well, I understood too, but I never put it together. If Germans were talking, I understood,\nI guess I did...\nI: That makes sense because our parents came from Germany, so we probably grew up\nspeaking German and Czech.",
        "Q: In the barrack, do you remember what the inmates were talking? Do you remember not\nunderstanding a lot of people?",
        "Q: Did you also get black bread?\nR: I don't remember black bread at all.",
        "Q: So, what you remember 1s stealing potatoes?\nR: Potatoes.",
        "Q: You don't remember being fed?\nR: No.",
        "Q: Do you remember drinking anything?\nR: No.",
        "Q: Irene, do you?\nI: Yes, something brown, but I don't know what it was.\nR: There was a liquid. There was a liquid served. I don't ever remember ever partaking of\nit, but there was a pot, yes. There was a pot and people would sort of line of for this thing. I\ndon't remember ever having any.",
        "Q: Do you remember the latrines?\nR: No.",
        "Q: You have no recollection of where you went to the bathroom?\nR: None, absolutely none.\nI: Now I do remember, I thought at one time that I actually saw like bones in the latrine. I\ndon't know.\nR: That's strange. It's really strange that I can't, I don't remember.",
        "Q: Do you ever remember washing your hands?",
        "Q: Do you remember what you were wearing?\nR: It didn't fit, whatever it was, and it was all over me. It was on my head, it was all over,\nbut I don't remember what it was.",
        "Q: What happened to you when you were liberated, when the Russian on the pink horse\ncame?\nR: Well, I remember being marched a little further with a throng of people into a warehouse\nof food, and I remember getting hold of a golden looking can and rolling it. I remember that was\nmy, that was my prize. And when they finally opened it, it turned out to be sauerkraut. That's\nwhat I remember about it.",
        "Q: Did you eat it?\nR: Yeah, tasted it.",
        "Q: Did you get sick?\nR: No, I don't remember getting sick. I understand that a lot of people did get very, very\nsick from eating.",
        "Q: Do, do you remember where they took you? Did they take you back to Auschwitz?\nR: I don't remember.",
        "Q: And then what happened? I mean, were you there for a very long time or did someone \u2014\n?\nR: Time is just totally meaningless at this point. My very next real memories \u2014 I know that\nI went to, to a hospital somewhere, but my next memories are in an orphanage in KosSice,\nCzechoslovakia.",
        "Q: What happened there?\nR: This was obviously after the war. It was a Catholic orphanage or hospital, because I\nremember being embraced by these nuns. In fact, I remember once being embraced by a very\nlarge nun to the point where I lost one of my teeth, which had to be loose, because it was\nobviously an embrace of love, not a hurting kind of thing. But those are just little things. And I\nwas with a lot of children, but there was an administrator in this hospital who took me into his",
        "Q: Did you know you were Jewish?\nR: I had the feeling. I had the feeling, which really came just out a little bit later when this\nDoctor Kalina had to leave his home, leave the country. Because somewhere \u2014 he had to leave,\nand I think it had to do with Communist takeover at that time in Czechoslovakia and I started to\ngo to school in KoSice, and he left me with his sister, Edith Mann, and her husband, Joseph\nMann. They had a boy, Otto, and a girl, Bibi (ph), Bibi, we lived very close to the school, and I\nknew I was Jewish then because, first of all, they were Jewish and I was called a Jew in the\nschool. Everyday when I, when school got out \u2014 there was one other Jew in the entire school.\nHis name was Sobol (ph). I'll never forget the name, Sobol.

The school\nadministration, now that I'm thinking about it, probably didn't do anything either, because I do\nremember being exposed to Catholic teachings 1n the classroom and we did go to church together\nfor whatever. I remember always trying to be at the back, so I wouldn't maybe not get in, not\nenough room for me to get in or something or to sneak away, but I knew I was Jewish, definitely\nfrom that. They reminded me that I was and I'm sure the number on my arm was some kind of a\nsignal. Though I know that not only Jews got numbers, but I think most Jews had that number. I\nthink it was an identifier and the number was there. And I was, I also knew that I was Jewish,\nbecause the Mann family did observe certain holidays. I do remember going to synagogue in\nKoSice.

She knew what a boy, a young boy was all about,\nand she let me do things that all boys, I think, should be doing at that point in life. They bought\nme \u2014 in Czechoslovak, it's kolobezka\u2019*, it's a scooter with just two wheels and a platform and a\nthing. It was one of the fanciest ones, and I loved that.\nI: It's funny.

She let me buy two Angora rabbits. I had two Angora,\nthey're white rabbits with red eyes, and they were babies. So they were very cute, when they\nwere little, but then after a while they got to be big and we had to get rid of them. So I'll never\nforget every weekend or every two weeks there was a market, a farmer's market would open up.\nAll the farmers would come into a big square in the town and they would sell their product,\nproduce, whatever.

Is this something special?\nR: I don't think so, because I'm not particularly crazy about animals, certainly not to live\nwith them, which is apparently what was going on.

But, I do remember having rosary beads\nand I became very devout, very devout. You know, I really didn't want to be Jewish. I mean, I\nwas glad, \u201cthis is great.\u201d But I also \u2014 maybe it wasn't totally great. In the summertime, she\nwould take me to visit. She had family in the countryside and it would be a long, hugely long\nwalk. It seemed like hours we'd walk with this wheelbarrow or something, because then we'd\nbring home produce from the farm. Now, on the farm, there were some other children, but I was\nreally devastated by them, because they made fun of my number. And I didn't know how to\nstand up for myself. I was very quiet and very shy and I was very obedient. I was a scared\nbunny. I was scared all the time. I remember one particular evening or day, I kind of got lost on\nthe farm. I don't know, it was getting dark and I didn't really know how to find my way back,\nand I guess I, they eventually found me, but I remember being pretty scared. I also, interesting\nenough, was put in charge of bunnies, of rabbits, I had to clean. She had rabbits. Not one, not\ntwo, rabbits, lots of rabbits, hutches, you know. I had to clean the rabbit cages, but I got very\nattached to the rabbits, but, you see, she used them for food, like on Sundays we would have\nrabbit. I couldn't eat. She got very mad at me and I got punished for that too, but I just couldn't\neat the rabbits. I couldn't. We had a, we didn't have a bathroom in the apartment. There was an\nouthouse. I remember on Christmas, she told me that if I was a very good child and if I watched\nthe sky, I would see Santa Claus come down in his coach and I would get a present, if I was very\ngood. I remember I fell for this, and I believed her and I stayed up the entire night looking at the\nsky, and I never saw. I thought I was good, but I guess I figured I wasn't good enough and I\nnever saw him. And I didn't even get a present.

        "Q: What do you mean it was dirty? What was it about that you can remember\u2019?\nI: They weren't dressed nicely, they were schlumpy and things were left on the table. It was\njust messy, I guess, maybe not dirty, but just messy, and it bothered us. We were neatniks in\nthose days. You should see my house now.",
        "Q: But you didn't escape?\nI: No, no we didn't. I got shipped to France and finally wound up in an orphanage in\nFublaines, which is on the outskirts of Paris. I was one of the youngest children there, and I\ndidn't speak to anybody, except Miriam, who was, I guess, about seven years older. She seemed\nlike almost a mother figure in a sense to me, because I had these long curls and she would fuss\nwith them and she just was very compassionate, and I, the other children \u2014 I was the only child\nthere with a number, so I also felt that there was something wrong with me. I felt that I had done\nsomething horrible that I had gotten the number and nobody else did. Most of these children had\nescaped somehow by hiding, or their parents had temporarily given them over and some were\nsubsequently reunited with parents and some just had family members and they were just waiting\nto be shipped to, and things like that. Even when I was in Fublaines, I tried extra hard to be\ngood. I was \u201cMiss Goody Two Shoes.\u201d I would help. Anybody needed help, I was there. And I\nalso was a stoic. There was time when we were getting some kind of \u2014 I really should go back\nand say I had all these horrible boils on my body at one point when I got to Fublaines. I don't\nknow if it was an infestation of lice, but all these huge scars on my legs. A lot of us had it, and I\nremember, we had to go \u2014 the couple that ran this home, the father was, I think, a doctor and we\nhad to go to him every day and he'd put this cream or something on it, and I remember always\ntrying to, like, be very brave and, you know, show that it didn't hurt because I thought then they'd\nlike me a little better than all the other children.\n\u00b0 Branch of the international religious Zionist organization,\nAgudath Israel.

        "Q: At that point did you decided you wanted to be Jewish?\nI: Well, it seemed like Miriam was, so it was okay, you know. We were going to be\ntogether so it didn't matter anymore what, yeah, we did \u2014 and I liked it, because we did have\nShabbats and I know we always got a special dress for Shabbat, which we then had to turn\nquickly in, because then we got whatever we wore for the whole week. I remember vanity gets\nin my way too, because we would get shipments of clothing items from the States or wherever\nand there was these red shoes. I had to have the red shoes. I remembered sandals. I remember\nthese were with little holes in them, like a shoe sandal. I had to have them. So, when the\nchildren tried on the shoes I said, \u201cI want those shoes.\u201d They were too small for me but I said,\n\u201cThey fit great. I like them, I love them, they're my shoes.\u201d And because of this, very shortly\nafter that, we took a long walk into Paris, or went for a really long walk, and of course, you can\nimagine what happened to my feet. I had blisters. My feet were bleeding. I was in so much pain\nthat the head mistress had to actually take me in Paris to buy me a pair of bigger shoes. I got\nwhite. I got white.

        "Q: When you were in Poland with this woman, Mrs. Mucha, you decided you didn't want to\nbe Jewish, what was going through your mind?\nI: What was going through my mind is that I felt to be Jewish was not a good thing.

I wanted to be part of what everybody was \u2014 and gee \u2014 it was pretty.\nR: I never knew that there was an option even for this.

        "Q: So, they never kept the boys and the girls together, the twins?\nI: I don't think so. I think maybe younger ones possibly, but\u2014\nR: I don't think there were any. I don't know.",
        "Q: Did you talk with your kids?\nI: No. I did make an attempt. At one time, I was actually at my mom's house and Lori was\nasking me about my number and I was trying to tell her that it was something horrible that\nhappened and that I'm adopted and my mother got very upset. She said, \u201cYou don't have to tell\nher these things.\u201d\nR: The Slotkins, in all their good qualities and beautiful intentions, they slipped up over here\na little bit. They were a little over protective, I think. They really tried to hide the truth, in a way\nof protecting us, really. I don't think they had anything else in mind.\nI: But it backfired, because the more they said don't talk about it, the more it was still\nalways there, because it's always with me and not being able to express it or tell or share any of it\nwas really hard.",
        "Q: Let me go back for a moment. When you saw each other for the first time, when you\nwere finally together, even though you didn't talk, did that stimulate nightmares or\nremembrances or bad dreams that you woke up from? I mean do you have any recollection\nwhether there was something that happened other than safety when you found each other?\nI: For me, I had some of the remembrances we spoke about when we were children. And\nso, when I saw him, \u201cNow I have finally have somebody I can check some of this stuff out with.\u201d\nI think we did check some of that pre stuff out that we never spoke about after Theresienstadt. It\nwas only what happened before. That's how we spoke about the doll and about the bee sting and\na couple of things like that. So, that was nice to confirm.",
        "Q: So, it didn't bring out \u2014?",
        "Q: Now, did you become a teacher when you studied biochemistry?\nI: No, I went into research, but I did teach for a while, too.",
        "Q: So what happens in the 80s?\nI: Well, in 1985, it was probably in December we got a call from Eva Kor!\u201d who was the\nfounder and remains the president of an organization called CANDLES, which stands for\nChildren of Auschwitz Nazi Deadly Lab Experiment Survivors, it's a mouthful, God!\nCANDLES. And she told us that they're going to have a reunion, a first time reunion of all\nsurviving twins in Israel, and that we were going to bring Joseph Mengele in absentia to a\ntribunal and Gideon Hausner!? was going to chair it and are you going to come? We were just\n\u2014as I said before, I said, \u201cYou mean we're not the only children to survive Auschwitz?\u201d But it\nwas a drawing card, I think, for Ren\u00e9 and myself. For me, I had a tremendous need to find\nsomebody who knew me. I wanted to be affirmed in some way. \u201cOh please, let me \u2014\nsomebody knows me, so they can tell me what exactly happened. And are my memories, they're\nso bizarre, can they be real?\u201d And so, we decided we'd do it. And, you know, it's in retrospect\nnow, because we did that and we started talking to each other and heard some of the other twins\nand some of their testimonies and it was like, \u201cAh-ha, that's what happened to me!\u201d You know,\nwe realized that our memories were true, as bizarre as they might be, they really happened, and\nsubsequently, we were able to research out a lot of our past, because we started looking into\nhistory books and original documentation from Auschwitz and Givat Chaim\" in Israel, we\nstarted piecing together dates and occurrences. We were also very fortunate to have a lot of\nphotographs that were saved by our aunt for us and letters and documentations, birth certificates\nand such. So, it's wonderful.\nR: It's like finding roots. Roots is very important in American history.",
        "Q: Were you as surprised as Irene that there were other children? Or did you know there\nwere?\n* Eva Kor (1935- ); Auschwitz survivor and author of Echoes from\nAuschwitz: Dr. Mengele\u2019s Twins, the story of Eva and Miriam\nMozes.

        "Q: What did that do? I mean, it's clear what it did for you probably together and for\nyourself, but when you came back to the United States in terms of your friends, in terms of your\nparents?\nI: Well, our dad was already dead, and my mom, we started \u2014 I started giving talks on\nYom Ha-Shoah!>. It's one of the things I still do. And we were in the news media a lot at that\ntime, and I think my mom was kind of proud, but she didn't want to hear it. She's never come to\nhear me talk. She never came. She's dead now, but she never came, and she never wanted to\nhear about it. I could not talk to her about it at all, absolutely not.",
        "Q: Did that hurt you?\nI: It's hard, yes.\nR: Yeah, it's hard, because here is somebody who certainly loves you and wants to do\nabsolutely the best, and yet somehow doesn't have enough strength or wisdom to be sensitive to\nunderstand that this other person has to express or wants to \u2014 I mean, we really didn't want to\ngo and spill our guts out, just a little bit. I think maybe part of it was that she really wanted to\nplay the mother role. She was the only mother. She was afraid of maybe losing that. I'm just\ntalking now. We don't know, we really don't know. But her motivation was pure, I know that,\nabsolutely pure.",
        "Q: Did it shock your friends?\nI: I had some friends who were totally taken aback, they said, \u201cBut you're so American.\nYou don't talk like a European. You don't look like, you know.\u201d And \u2014 but the truth of it is,\nthat even though I'm so \"American,\" because I knew how to fit in, the truth is that everything I\ndid and everything I excelled at, whether it was in school or being, I mean, I made my parents \u2014\nright, I was the salutatorian of the class, the editor of the newspaper, the yearbook, the \u2014 you\nname it, I did it \u2014 but always there was that feeling like I was apart. I never \u2014 never felt a part\nof anything. There was always a wall someplace. I said, \u201cYou guys don't know what I know.\u201d\nAnd I remember when I first even started school here. I remember the kids would talk out of turn\nin class or they didn't bring in the homework and I said, \u201cMy God, how can you do that?\u201d I said,\n\u201cHow can you do that?\u201d",
        "Q: You were a good girl?\nR: Just generally, I think the European school system is so different. I remember, I used to,\nother than the unpleasant things, I used to have to bring my own stick to school, in case I\nmisbehaved and get hit on my hands. So, there was this big theory to get a very thin stick, then it\nwill really sting, or get a fat stick, and it will really hurt. This was a big problem.",
        "Q: Were you in classes together through high school?\nR: Yes, through high school.\nI: In our English classes we were together, but in Hebrew we were separated.",
        "Q: Was that fun to be in school together?\nI: No.\nR: No.\nI: No, it wasn\u2019t.",
        "Q: Why?\nR: The class was really too small. I think there were only 11 of us, because this was the\nbeginning of a school there, we were always the eldest \u2014 we were senior class in yeshiva, right.\nEven if we were juniors or sophomores or freshmen, we were always the oldest. There were \u2014\nnobody older than us, so it was too close.\nI: It was too close. We weren't the same kind of student.\nR: She was a student, I was a playboy.",
        "Q: What did you end up doing \u2014 since we know what Irene ended up doing?\nR: I ended up getting married early and out of the house, making a mistake doing that, I\nthink, but as God's ways are so strange, everything I've done in my life has led up to what we're\non now. And I can see the whole picture now and it's not so bad. I paid my dues, but I have the\nmost wonderful wife in the world, the wonderful wife, the best, and I have the best kids and the\nbest grandchildren, so I'm happy.",
        "Q: What did you do for a living?\nI: I worked in the packaging field all my life. Packaging.",
        "Q: Do the two of you live near each other?\nI: Relatively, I live on Long Island, he lives in Manhattan. And I also have the best family,\nRen\u00e9. So, you know, I have the best kids too. I don't have any grandkids yet, but I definitely\nhave the best great-grand whatever they are to me.",
        "Q: Right, Ren\u00e9 was just made a grandfather twice?\nR: Last week, right.\nI: I also do calligraphy and write poetry.\nR: She's very talented.\nI: I don't know if I'm talented, but...\nR: What this '85 thing also did for us, 1t made the two of us talk. Not during any session at\nhome, we would not talk about it. Like in between sessions in the hotel room, we would talk\nabout it, and that's the only time we talk about it. We'll go home now and we're not going to talk\nabout this, but we talked about it a little bit this morning or last night on the way to the airport,\nand that's it. It's just something that is not really, I guess \u2014 it's not pleasant. It's unnerving. It\ntakes a lot out of, out of you, but we've done it now since '85. We've talked because we feel it's\nreally necessary, and the further we go away from it, the more necessary, I think, it becomes\nbecause we see a lot of funny things going on out there, in terms of did it really happen? Did it",
        "Q: Is there anything more you'd like to say?\nI: I'm going to say that this has been painful for me to do, even though Ren\u00e9 says we've\nbeen doing it now since '85. I, I'm always disturbed for days on end after I've done it, but I agree\nwith Ren\u00e9 that it's something that we need to do for our children, so that they can pass on the\nstory, because it must never be forgotten, and I guess that's why I do it.\nR: I have to say again that what's happening today, we are meeting up with people that are\nusing the story for their own purpose and, obviously, if they're using a story that's not true,\nthey're changing it. That is we can't stand by, as hurtful as it is to question a survivor, because I\nknow when somebody asks me a question, it's got to be done. It's got to be done to pollute the\nhistory of something like this, it\u2019Il lose any potential for learning something from it.\nI: Well, the historical integrity of the Holocaust must really be upheld and it's got to be\ndone with the truth.\nR: And I think more people when they put somebody in the front or recognize by whatever\nslight means, survivor, I think at this point have to question and document that person.",
        "Q: Well, I thank you very much. You showed your tattoo, would you be willing to\nphotograph your tattoo? What's the number?\nI: 70917.\nR: That's an old looking tattoo.\nI: It's 50 years old, baby.",
        "Q: Yours is much smaller?\nR: No, not really.",

        "Q: Now what was the date?\nI: 1937.",
        "Q: No, the month?\nI: Sorry, December 21.\nR: I was born at the same time, half hour later. My name then was Ren\u00e9 Guttmann and\ntoday is Ren\u00e9 Slotkin.",
        "Q: Now you were very young during these early years of the Nazi oppression and\npersecution, but I really would like to see what it is that you remember as far back as you can go.\nDo you remember those first few years where? You were born in Teplice Sanov, but you didn't\nlive there for very long?\nI: No. We moved to Prague and were there for a while.\nR: My earliest memories of being alive go to that apartment building in Prague. It was\nmaybe a like five or six story building brick with a yard and a fence. I remember a staircase\nleading up to our apartment so we had to be somewhere up.\nI: Yeah, I think we were on the upper floor.\nR: Upper floors, and I do remember falling once and I have an injury here, which I haven't\nthought about in a long time, but I must have stitches underneath my chin. I still remember the\nburning sensation of what I guess was iodine, was the first aid that I got for that. But I do\nremember that apartment building. Those are my earliest, very earliest memories, my first\nmemories.",
        "Q: You slept in the same crib?\nR: I don't remember doing that.\nI: Either in the same crib or right next or our cribs were like touching. My recollection\nreally is, and I know I've told you this once before, that our mother, when she would put us to\nsleep she played a game with us, there was a game. She would set our hands and we always\nwanted our bodies to be set a certain way to see if we could stay that way all night long and wake\nup in that same position. So I remember that.\nR: This is incredible. I'm learning this. I never heard this.\nI: I remember that, yes.",
        "Q: Did she make up this game or did you make it up?\nI: I'm not sure.\nR: I would think it had to be her, but that's interesting.",
        "Q: What other recollections? Do you remember playing outside? Do you remember the\npeople around you?\nI: I don't remember the people around us so much, but I know that once Ren\u00e9 \u2014 there was\na yard in front with grass and Ren\u00e9 was out there playing. I think he stepped on a bumblebee\nand he got bitten and I think that was \u2014\nR: That was a big impression made on me. As a matter fact, I had itches underneath on that\nfoot even when I came to the States, which was in 1950. I always get an itch on the one, but I\ncould never understand. But I do remember that incident. I put it together. I don't know\nwhether it's a real physiological phenomena or just my mind playing tricks on me. But, yeah. I\nremember the grass.\nI: You know, I also remember, do you remember that we had like conductor outfits and\npunching tickets to go on the train and we used to play train, train conductors?\nR: Well, that brings to mind, I think there was a tram or something that ran near us.\nI: In front of the house.\nR: Number 22.\nI: Twenty-two, right.\nR: I wouldn't know it was 22 until now, but it looked like two twos, so now we know it's a\n22.\nI: That was one of our favorite games. I think we also \u2014 I remember we had some kind of\ncar that we could sit in and drive. I don't \u2014 we used to race, but you used to beat me all the\ntime.\nR: See, she's older, obviously \u2014she remembers these things.\nI: I remember one particular time we used to go \u2014 our parents took us to the park. There\nwas a park nearby. And we used to go quite a bit, but the one time that I remember especially\nwas right after a major storm and a lot of trees had fallen and we were walking on the logs,\ntrying to balance, and I think\u2014\nR: That must be the same storm that I'm talking about except I saw it from upstairs. We\nmust have gone down.\nI: I think we went down. I remember that, there's something about the air. You know you\nhow sometimes that smell \u2014 it brings it back, even today, sometimes I'm out and I get a certain\nsmell and it says \u2014 that's the park. Also, I remember that we had \u2014 I'm not sure whether it was\ntrucks or what, but some kind of toys that we could pull, like little wooden something. And we\nalso had wooden little blocks, tiny little blocks, and you were very good at making.",
        "Q: Do you remember your parents?\nR: I don't, I really don't. I've tried and even I've had visual aids since, I've gotten some\npictures of them, but it still doesn't seem to help. I've tried to really. There's just one moment\nthat I remember that happened much later with my mom that I remember, but not at that point in\ntime.\nI: I think I'm pretty \u2014 I could not, if I didn't have photographs, I don't think I could recall\nwhat they looked like. The only thing I remember is my mom's presence at certain times. I\nrecall them vividly. And also, my dad in \u2014 one of the things that I vividly do remember 1s when\nhe was taken away, and I think it was at night and some men came in uniform and they just took\nhim away and, you know, we never saw him again after that, not to my recollection. Although,\nRen\u00e9, you've said you remember us visiting him in prison, but I don't remember.\nR: I don't know.\nI: No?\nR: We didn't see him then.\nI: I don't remember seeing him.\nR: I remember going to what I \u2014 assuming was some kind of \u2014 it was a huge building. To\nme, any building was \u2014 it was very powerful looking, as opposed to the other buildings and we\nwould bring \u2014 my mother and I would bring, we \u2014 we would bring packages there.

Did you remember something that\nchanged in Prague prior to your dad being taken?\nI: I don't think I remember anything changing, but I think there was a feeling.

I know that you don't remember your mother in the\nvisual sense, but do you remember a change in the household somehow after your father was\ntaken or was it not that clear?\nI: I don't think it was that clear. I have a feeling my mom didn't say anything to us and I\nthink that we probably felt our dad was going to come back.\nR: Yeah. I don't think there was any change. The time just melted.",

Going to Theresienstadt?\nI: My next recollection 1s truthfully being on a train.\nR: Being there.\nI: No. I remember a train.\nR: You got an earlier \u2014. I just remember being there.\nI: And it seemed like a normal train. It was a train ride and then we were someplace else\nand I guess that was Theresienstadt.\nR: I just remember being there.

I just \u2014 I remember cobblestone roads for\nsome reason. And I remember archways \u2014 like tunnel like \u2014 I have no idea, it could be\nsomeplace else. I have this flashing thing of bodies in an open cart.\nR: I was just going to get to that. I remember carts being drawn through the streets. I knew\nthey were bodies.

        "Q: Why not?\nI: We were scared. We knew that crying was not something you did. You didn't cry.\nR: I don't think we wanted to add anything to that noise there already. It was a long train\nride.\nI: We had already learned the need to be silent to be quiet and well behaved.\nR: Probably.",

Do you have any recollection of being\nafraid?\nR: For our personal safety?\nI: I don't think so, no.\nR: I mean, we saw these things going on and I think we just assumed that this is the way\nthings are. I think our mother must have provided, I'm not just guessing, must have provided us\nwith a real security type of blanket that we weren't, or it was our youth and we really didn't\nunderstand.",

What other recollections\ndo you have? Was your mother holding you? You holding onto your mother's leg?\nR: We were very close to her at all times.

        "Q: Describe it.\nR: It was night. I heard yelling \"Raus,*\" snowing a little bit too, I think.\nI: Yes.\nR: And it was refreshing at first, when they first opened the doors. I mean we had air for the\nfirst time, and it just hit you, it was good, but then the rest of it started happening.\nI: I remember just that we had to walk a little. I don't know if it was a long distance. It's\nhard to tell, but we walked and then I remember finding \u2014 we all, everybody off of that,",

I mean, I think we were, too.\nI: Oh, yes I remember being together.\nR: I don't remember my mother. I'm trying so hard to do that.\nI: I remember being together and then at some point our mom even took us to the hospital\nto have a medical examination and this I remember because \u2014 sorry, Ren\u00e9 \u2014 you used to cry a\nlot. You didn't like doctors, and I was only worried that you were going to cry and something\nterrible was going to happen to you because I was a stoic.\nR: I cried?\nI: You didn't, not that time.

I remember the pain of the needle as they made the\ndots, and just surrounding it was this awful odor and I'm not sure what that odor was, but the\ntattooing comes together with an odor for me. So \u2014 but I don't remember anything else but just\nthat needle.",
        "Q: But your numbers are quite different, so you were not tattooed at the same time or you\ndon't know?\nR: I don't know.\nI: I think we were.\nR: I mean, we now know that the numbers that were given to girls and to boys were different\nso we know this for a fact now. So, the numbers wouldn't be sequential, but I don't remember\nanybody else being tattooed except myself. I mean, I don't remember Irene being tattooed or my\nmother being tattooed.\nI: I don't have much of a recollection of the tattooing.\nR: You don't remember the tattooing?

It's that black bread and something like\npotatoes or vegetable something, warm something.\nR: I don't have any recollection of food until later when I had to \u2014 when we were separated\nand I had to sift through garbage to get at potatoes.

I'm not sure what I heard or what I felt,\nbut it was my mother and that was the only time that I felt that she was in real agony.

I remember being a little jealous because it seemed like there was, there were two\ngirls and it seemed like their mother \u2014 I don't know how they had a mother or somebody who\nwould bring them things.\nR: Little girls? They were little girls?\nI: No, bigger than me, but they had somebody who brought them things, who was very\nclose to them somehow and I remember, you know, kind of watching with great deal of envy.",
        "Q: Did you know you were twins?\nI: No, no, I don't think so. I knew I had a brother, but I had no idea of what twin even\nmeant. In all of this, everything that happened, I always just thought this was what life was. I\ncouldn't remember anything else anymore, and I used to think sometimes about our mother,\nfleetingly, like, \u201cWell, maybe I'm never supposed to see her again \u2014 this is how things are.\u201d\nAnd then just knowing that there was Ren\u00e9 over there. And then I remember one particular night\nthat I was especially concerned about Ren\u00e9, because there was like a big explosion, and there\nwas a fire and it was all off to that side, to the right. I remember lying on my bunk bed and there",
        "Q: Did you think about him a lot?\nI: In some way, I did. I kind of felt I had to stay in there because he was going to need me.\nThat's pretty egotistical. Well...",
        "Q: Do you remember other young girls in the same barrack? Were you with other people\nwho also had these funny things happening to them, these horrible medical experiments?\nI: I thought I was the only one. In fact, it's interesting, when in 1985, when we first found\nout there were other twins who survived Auschwitz, I said to Ren\u00e9, \u201cI thought we were the only\nkids who survived, how could there be anybody else, what you do mean there are twins?\u201d So,\nno, I had no idea that anybody else was having anything done to them.",
        "Q: Are there any other things you want to tell us about Auschwitz before the liberation?\nI: I remember once in the hospital there, I was there and something was going to happen. It\nseemed all the patients were being evacuated or cleared out or something and I remember\nsomebody who worked in the hospital grabbed me and hid me behind her and just said, \u201cbe very\nquiet.\u201d Of course I was. I mean, if I could have disappeared I would have, and that's all I know.\nI don't know who it was and I don't know what she might have saved me or not saved me from.\nAnd so that...",
        "Q: Were you ever beaten?\nI: No, no, not that I \u2014 no.",
        "Q: Do you remember getting weaker and weaker?\nI: Yes, Ido. I remember getting weaker and weaker because towards the end just before\nliberation, I was on the ground and I could not even get up. And there were other people also on\nthe ground to my recollection, and I didn't know if I was ever going to be able to get up off this\nfloor. But I don't think I understood what \u201cto be dead\u201d meant even then, because I just didn't\nknow what was going to be. I remember there were also, I remember sirens and bombings,\nnoise, gun fire or maybe bombs. I'm not sure. Do you remember that at all? Sirens?\nR: Yes, I remember sirens and then the hum of the airplanes and they would always get\neverybody in and they would stand a soldier outside our barrack, one soldier outside the barrack.\nDon't know why.",
        "Q: Were you liberated in Auschwitz by the Russians? You may not have known that...\nI: Yes. I might not have known that that's what it was. I was literally picked up by a Polish\nlady who just took me to her home. I remember she carried me on her shoulders the whole way,\nbecause I couldn't, couldn't walk.",
        "Q: You were eight?\nI: Yes. Going to be eight \u2014\nR: You were, you were \u2014 your seventh year is December. You turned seven in December.\nI: Oh, I had just turned seven.\nR: You were just a little bit over seven. Same as me \u2014 that's how I remember.\nI: Good point.",
        "Q: Rene, let's go to you and your months now in Auschwitz as you're alone.\nR: Well, I'm going to juxtaposition my things with hers. The long waits and roll calls,\nsomething that we mentioned before. The wires, yes, electric, every once in a while, somebody\nwould go against those wires and then be still, but the wires to me were always near my barrack\nfor some reason, were the backdrop of a hole, a long, deep ditch where I remember very often,\nvery, very often they would just line up people and shoot them, because I remember as me and\nsome other young youngsters, we went over to see what was happening to some of those people.\nI do remember one instance, where the person wasn't quite dead. He didn't stop moving. I do\nremember him having a big bump on his head and the people, there some of the people, actually",
        "Q: There were older men in your barrack?\nR: Yes.",
        "Q: Were there older women in your barrack, too?\nI: Yes.\nR: And I was very close to the crematoria, because there was a constant flow of people\ngoing into this and nobody every coming out. I was very close to that road. I was, like, very\nclose to the barracks. I always had a view of that.",
        "Q: Could you smell?\nR: Yes. The odor was just bad. It was just bad. Everything there was bad. Foul, all the\nodors were foul except for that wood.\n* x-ray (German)",
        "Q: Did you have showers with some regularity?\nI: Yes.\nR: I don't remember any showers at all, but that doesn't mean.... I do remember though, I\ndid see Irene once. I saw her once across \u2014 a wire fence. I don't know whether I was walking\nto the hospital myself, but I saw her somewhere in the middle and I recognized her. Nothing was\nsaid and I just looked at her and I knew she was there. I don't know if she remembers the\nmoment, but I always, from that point on, and I think maybe even before, I knew that she was\nalive. It was the inspiration, it was the motivation to keep me going. I knew I had to stay, stick\naround and do until I met her for her sake, or for whatever sake, but I knew that you were there\nsomewhere there and in a certain direction.\nI: I don't really recall the moment, though I'm really trying hard to see if I can, but I do, I\nmust in some ways recall it on a different level, because I knew that you were alive, so I must\nhave known because then later on, after liberation, I knew that you were alive, so perhaps I did\nsee you and I just don't recall it.\nEnd of Tape 1",
        "Q: Rene, you were describing \u2014 not individual people, but, in some way, the relationships\nthere. Did you feel less alone than, than Irene described herself? Or did you feel...\nR: I would have to think that I wasn't alone. I was with other people. I did not, however,\nthink of Irene or my mother. I just accepted what was there and went with it.",
        "Q: Did you ever cry?\nR: I don't remember. I'm sure I did, but I don't remember crying, no. Just to catch up to\nIrene's liberation, I was also liberated pretty much at the same time, but under totally different\ncircumstances. I remember before the end came, the end of Auschwitz, the liberation, there was\nan increased amount of noise, which I now know was gun fire around, and less of a German\npresence. We were marched somewhere from some point to somewhere and whoever couldn't\ndo this marching, if they stepped out of line or fell down, they were just eliminated, so I knew I\nhad to keep marching. Again, there was increased gun fire at this point, I'd have to say it was,\nand then all of a sudden the Germans were gone. They were just gone, and we were surrounded\nby these white uniformed \u2014 which I know were Russians now. That's how my liberation \u2014 I do\nhave to insert, that I do remember one Russian solider, officer on a horse, which to me looked\npink. It looked like a pink horse to me, but that's one of the memories, and the white uniforms.\nDefinitely white uniforms.",
        "Q: Was it night or day?\nR: Night.",
        "Q: What languages were you speaking in Auschwitz?\nR: That's a good question, because I just thought of it myself and I don't really remember\nwhether it was or what it was.\nI: Actually, we spoke German and Czech, because I did understand what \u2014 I understood\nwhat was going on around me.\nR: Well, I understood too, but I never put it together. If Germans were talking, I understood,\nI guess I did...\nI: That makes sense because our parents came from Germany, so we probably grew up\nspeaking German and Czech.",
        "Q: In the barrack, do you remember what the inmates were talking? Do you remember not\nunderstanding a lot of people?",
        "Q: Did you also get black bread?\nR: I don't remember black bread at all.",
        "Q: So, what you remember 1s stealing potatoes?\nR: Potatoes.",

        "Q: Do you remember drinking anything?\nR: No.",
        "Q: Irene, do you?\nI: Yes, something brown, but I don't know what it was.\nR: There was a liquid. There was a liquid served. I don't ever remember ever partaking of\nit, but there was a pot, yes. There was a pot and people would sort of line of for this thing. I\ndon't remember ever having any.",
        "Q: Do you remember the latrines?\nR: No.",
        "Q: You have no recollection of where you went to the bathroom?\nR: None, absolutely none.\nI: Now I do remember, I thought at one time that I actually saw like bones in the latrine. I\ndon't know.\nR: That's strange. It's really strange that I can't, I don't remember.",
        "Q: Do you ever remember washing your hands?",
        "Q: Do you remember what you were wearing?\nR: It didn't fit, whatever it was, and it was all over me. It was on my head, it was all over,\nbut I don't remember what it was.",
        "Q: What happened to you when you were liberated, when the Russian on the pink horse\ncame?\nR: Well, I remember being marched a little further with a throng of people into a warehouse\nof food, and I remember getting hold of a golden looking can and rolling it. I remember that was\nmy, that was my prize. And when they finally opened it, it turned out to be sauerkraut. That's\nwhat I remember about it.",
        "Q: Did you eat it?\nR: Yeah, tasted it.",
        "Q: Did you get sick?\nR: No, I don't remember getting sick. I understand that a lot of people did get very, very\nsick from eating.",
        "Q: Do, do you remember where they took you? Did they take you back to Auschwitz?\nR: I don't remember.",
        "Q: And then what happened? I mean, were you there for a very long time or did someone \u2014\n?\nR: Time is just totally meaningless at this point. My very next real memories \u2014 I know that\nI went to, to a hospital somewhere, but my next memories are in an orphanage in KosSice,\nCzechoslovakia.",
        "Q: What happened there?\nR: This was obviously after the war. It was a Catholic orphanage or hospital, because I\nremember being embraced by these nuns. In fact, I remember once being embraced by a very\nlarge nun to the point where I lost one of my teeth, which had to be loose, because it was\nobviously an embrace of love, not a hurting kind of thing. But those are just little things. And I\nwas with a lot of children, but there was an administrator in this hospital who took me into his",
        "Q: Did you know you were Jewish?\nR: I had the feeling. I had the feeling, which really came just out a little bit later when this\nDoctor Kalina had to leave his home, leave the country. Because somewhere \u2014 he had to leave,\nand I think it had to do with Communist takeover at that time in Czechoslovakia and I started to\ngo to school in KoSice, and he left me with his sister, Edith Mann, and her husband, Joseph\nMann. They had a boy, Otto, and a girl, Bibi (ph), Bibi, we lived very close to the school, and I\nknew I was Jewish then because, first of all, they were Jewish and I was called a Jew in the\nschool. Everyday when I, when school got out \u2014 there was one other Jew in the entire school.\nHis name was Sobol (ph). I'll never forget the name, Sobol. I don't know his first name, but the\nboys are waiting for us to beat us and stone us every single day. It was a hassle to get out of\nschool. I don't know why it wasn't a problem going to school, but leaving school every day was\na horror show.",
        "Q: Did the family know this? Did you tell them?\nR: I think they knew it, but maybe they \u2014 I don't think anything was done. The school\nadministration, now that I'm thinking about it, probably didn't do anything either, because I do\nremember being exposed to Catholic teachings 1n the classroom and we did go to church together\nfor whatever. I remember always trying to be at the back, so I wouldn't maybe not get in, not\nenough room for me to get in or something or to sneak away, but I knew I was Jewish, definitely\nfrom that. They reminded me that I was and I'm sure the number on my arm was some kind of a\nsignal. Though I know that not only Jews got numbers, but I think most Jews had that number. I\nthink it was an identifier and the number was there. And I was, I also knew that I was Jewish,\nbecause the Mann family did observe certain holidays. I do remember going to synagogue in\nKoSice. I don't remember ever praying, but I do remember having fights with boys \u2014 we'd sort\nof like divide the synagogue yard into two areas and chestnuts would fall and we'd throw these",
        "Q: How long did you stay with the Manns (ph)?\nR: Well, I know it was about two years. I think it was about two years, 'til just before I\ncame, started my trek here to the States.",
        "Q: Of course, you remembered Irene, because...? Did you tell people you had a sister?\n[Irene shakes his head] Why?\nR: I think I did tell them, after first contact was made, but it came from America. I think it\ncame from Irene's side. She's the one who somehow \u2014 well, she'll tell you how she let the\npeople know she that had a brother, but no I wasn't making it a \u2014.",
        "Q: But you don't know why?\nR: No, no, I knew. I mean, it kept me going, it kept me going. And I have to say that this\nMann family, they took me in and they treated me just like one of their children. Very\nunderstanding woman, this Edith Mann was. She knew what a boy, a young boy was all about,\nand she let me do things that all boys, I think, should be doing at that point in life. They bought\nme \u2014 in Czechoslovak, it's kolobezka\u2019*, it's a scooter with just two wheels and a platform and a\nthing. It was one of the fanciest ones, and I loved that.\nI: It's funny. You just reminded \u2014 we had those when we were little.\nR: Really?\nI: We had them.\nR: Maybe that's how I learned how to ride them, because I was an expert.\nI: We had them, I remember. You push off with one foot and you hold on. We had them,\nwe had them.\nR: Yes, that was one of them. They were a wonderful family but that was life in KoSice.\nOh, they let me do something else. She let me buy two Angora rabbits. I had two Angora,\nthey're white rabbits with red eyes, and they were babies. So they were very cute, when they\nwere little, but then after a while they got to be big and we had to get rid of them. So I'll never\nforget every weekend or every two weeks there was a market, a farmer's market would open up.\nAll the farmers would come into a big square in the town and they would sell their product,\nproduce, whatever. I was at one of those stands trying to sell \u2014 I don't know if I was trying to\nsell my two rabbits. I don't even remember if I ever sold them, but they disappeared.\n\u201c scooter (Czech)",
        "Q: This is the third animal that you've mentioned. You mentioned a goat, and the two\nrabbits. Is this something special?\nR: I don't think so, because I'm not particularly crazy about animals, certainly not to live\nwith them, which is apparently what was going on. There was a dog also in Kalina's. Somehow\nI remember a dog, also a puppy, didn't last very long.",
        "Q: Did Doctor Kalina have a son or a daughter?\nR: A daughter.",
        "Q: And the Manns?\nR: The Manns had a daughter and a boy, Otto.",
        "Q: Were you close with them? Were they nice to you?\nR: Yes.",
        "Q: So, they all were nice?\nR: Yes. I seem to be much luckier with my relationships with people after the war at least\nup to the Slotkins, then Irene appeared.",
        "Q: Was eating a problem, or did you, I mean...?\nR: For me, personally?",
        "Q: Yeah.\nR: No, I don't think so. I do remember doing all the normal things, you know, looking for\ntreats and I ate everything, kosher or unkosher, which obviously, I had no idea about. In fact, I\ndo remember now eating the unkosher things, like, whatever it is, it's called slanina>. I think it's\nfat, I think it's just lard or.... Shepherds used to eat this. I remember going into the fields and\nshepherds would have this shepherd's bag and they would pull out this big hunk loaf of bread and\nthen unwrap this smaller meaty white looking white, mostly white and take a knife and cut. It\nlooked so great and delicious that I had to partake.",
        "Q: Was it good?\n> bacon (Czech)",
        "Q: Did you feel lonely?\nR: Well, once I found out that Irene, in fact, was alive and we made some kind of\nconnection, I just wanted to go. I wanted to meet. I don't know what else I wanted, but I wanted\nto meet.",
        "Q: Irene, let's go back to you and take you up to the point \u2014 this point. So, this woman\ntakes you on her back, she carries...\nI: She carries me piggy back kind of fashion, and I'm holding on to her, and I don't have a\nclue to where we're going, but it didn't take too long. And I find myself in this apartment and it's\nfacing a square, and diagonally across to the right is where the Russian soldiers are housed in\nsome big huge building. It was like a square, there were, and her name was Mrs. Mucha.\nR: Yes, Mucha?\nI: Means fly in Polish, and I remember now always being embarrassed to say the name\nbecause I knew what it meant and \u2014 you know it's like...\nR: I've never heard this.\nI: I \u2014 when I first got there, I must have been pretty sick. And I remember that she had me\nin bed and she called, I guess, what was a doctor, and I remember having hot \u2014 this is going to\n\u2014 hot glasses \u2014 that were heated glasses that were like put on the body at different parts. Do\nyou know what I'm talking about even?",
        "Q: No.\nI: It's very, very weird. I don't know what it was for, but I guess I eventually got better,\nbecause I did finally get out of bed, and I got enrolled in Catholic school and actually I think I\nknew, because you asked Ren\u00e9 about being Jewish, but I think I didn't want to be Jewish and I\nthought this was neat. It was pretty \u2014 the only thing is Mrs. Mucha was very, very, very strict,\nso that if I came home two minutes later than she thought it should have taken me to walk home\nfrom school, we got punished.",
        "Q: How?\nI: We got hit.\nR: Who's \"we?\"",

        "Q: Sexually?\nI: I don't want to talk about that. I remember going to school and going to church and I\nremember, that I \u2014 when the priest called \u2014 there was a time when you could go down and they\nput something in your mouth, you know those white thin, looked so great, and I wanted to know\nif I was ever going to get a chance, but no such luck. But, I do remember having rosary beads\nand I became very devout, very devout. You know, I really didn't want to be Jewish. I mean, I\nwas glad, \u201cthis is great.\u201d But I also \u2014 maybe it wasn't totally great. In the summertime, she\nwould take me to visit. She had family in the countryside and it would be a long, hugely long\nwalk. It seemed like hours we'd walk with this wheelbarrow or something, because then we'd\nbring home produce from the farm. Now, on the farm, there were some other children, but I was\nreally devastated by them, because they made fun of my number. And I didn't know how to\nstand up for myself. I was very quiet and very shy and I was very obedient. I was a scared\nbunny. I was scared all the time. I remember one particular evening or day, I kind of got lost on\nthe farm. I don't know, it was getting dark and I didn't really know how to find my way back,\nand I guess I, they eventually found me, but I remember being pretty scared. I also, interesting\nenough, was put in charge of bunnies, of rabbits, I had to clean. She had rabbits. Not one, not\ntwo, rabbits, lots of rabbits, hutches, you know. I had to clean the rabbit cages, but I got very\nattached to the rabbits, but, you see, she used them for food, like on Sundays we would have\nrabbit. I couldn't eat. She got very mad at me and I got punished for that too, but I just couldn't\neat the rabbits. I couldn't. We had a, we didn't have a bathroom in the apartment. There was an\nouthouse. I remember on Christmas, she told me that if I was a very good child and if I watched\nthe sky, I would see Santa Claus come down in his coach and I would get a present, if I was very\ngood. I remember I fell for this, and I believed her and I stayed up the entire night looking at the\nsky, and I never saw. I thought I was good, but I guess I figured I wasn't good enough and I\nnever saw him. And I didn't even get a present. Well, I guess I got a present, 1t was a cookie\nmade in the shape of what do they call them like gingerbread \u2014\nR: A gingerbread house?\nI: No, like a person, like a little girl or something.",
        "Q: Was she ever nice?\nI: Well, she did care for me. She got me through being ill and, as long as I got home on\ntime and didn't, did everything right, she was okay.",
        "Q: Was she ever affectionate with you?\nI: No.\nR: It sounds pretty rough to me. I haven't really digested all of this ever.\nI: Well, you're saying it sounds pretty rough, but it was better than Auschwitz.\nR: Well, I'm comparing it to what I went through.",
        "Q: What do you mean it was dirty? What was it about that you can remember\u2019?\nI: They weren't dressed nicely, they were schlumpy and things were left on the table. It was\njust messy, I guess, maybe not dirty, but just messy, and it bothered us. We were neatniks in\nthose days. You should see my house now.",
        "Q: But you didn't escape?\nI: No, no we didn't. I got shipped to France and finally wound up in an orphanage in\nFublaines, which is on the outskirts of Paris. I was one of the youngest children there, and I\ndidn't speak to anybody, except Miriam, who was, I guess, about seven years older. She seemed\nlike almost a mother figure in a sense to me, because I had these long curls and she would fuss\nwith them and she just was very compassionate, and I, the other children \u2014 I was the only child\nthere with a number, so I also felt that there was something wrong with me. I felt that I had done\nsomething horrible that I had gotten the number and nobody else did. Most of these children had\nescaped somehow by hiding, or their parents had temporarily given them over and some were\nsubsequently reunited with parents and some just had family members and they were just waiting\nto be shipped to, and things like that. Even when I was in Fublaines, I tried extra hard to be\ngood. I was \u201cMiss Goody Two Shoes.\u201d I would help. Anybody needed help, I was there. And I\nalso was a stoic. There was time when we were getting some kind of \u2014 I really should go back\nand say I had all these horrible boils on my body at one point when I got to Fublaines. I don't\nknow if it was an infestation of lice, but all these huge scars on my legs. A lot of us had it, and I\nremember, we had to go \u2014 the couple that ran this home, the father was, I think, a doctor and we\nhad to go to him every day and he'd put this cream or something on it, and I remember always\ntrying to, like, be very brave and, you know, show that it didn't hurt because I thought then they'd\nlike me a little better than all the other children.\n\u00b0 Branch of the international religious Zionist organization,\nAgudath Israel.

        "Q: At that point did you decided you wanted to be Jewish?\nI: Well, it seemed like Miriam was, so it was okay, you know. We were going to be\ntogether so it didn't matter anymore what, yeah, we did \u2014 and I liked it, because we did have\nShabbats and I know we always got a special dress for Shabbat, which we then had to turn\nquickly in, because then we got whatever we wore for the whole week. I remember vanity gets\nin my way too, because we would get shipments of clothing items from the States or wherever\nand there was these red shoes. I had to have the red shoes. I remembered sandals. I remember\nthese were with little holes in them, like a shoe sandal. I had to have them. So, when the\nchildren tried on the shoes I said, \u201cI want those shoes.\u201d They were too small for me but I said,\n\u201cThey fit great. I like them, I love them, they're my shoes.\u201d And because of this, very shortly\nafter that, we took a long walk into Paris, or went for a really long walk, and of course, you can\nimagine what happened to my feet. I had blisters. My feet were bleeding. I was in so much pain\nthat the head mistress had to actually take me in Paris to buy me a pair of bigger shoes. I got\nwhite. I got white.

        "Q: When you were in Poland with this woman, Mrs. Mucha, you decided you didn't want to\nbe Jewish, what was going through your mind?\nI: What was going through my mind is that I felt to be Jewish was not a good thing. People\ndidn't like Jews and it was just much better to be Catholic because that was just what everybody\nwas. I wanted to be part of what everybody was \u2014 and gee \u2014 it was pretty.\nR: I never knew that there was an option even for this. I sort of was always reminded that I\nwas Jewish and I accepted that. And I knew I wasn't liked, but I accepted it. I did have though\none in the very early stages when I first started to go to school and they had these Catholic\npriests teach us the religion.

It was terrifying because nobody had actually prepared me for a\nplane ride, and we came \u2014 I came with Charlie and Miss Stutz (ph) or \u2014 don't remember.\nAnyway, a young woman who accompanied us and, we came \u2014 that's how we came to New\nYork. The plane ride was horrific. I remember getting sick. I remember throwing up. It was\njust \u2014 there was no preparation. I had no idea. It was long, it was very long.",
        "Q: How old were you at this time?\nI: So, I\u2019m now \u2014 it's 1947, I'm going to be 10.",
        "Q: So, you go to live with this Mr. Tenzer?\nI: I come to the States and I get wined and dined. We go to the White House. We visit\nPresident Truman and like, you got a celebrity sitting next to you.",
        "Q: You were kind of like a poster child in a way?\nI: Exactly right. I was poster child. I had these long curls. I'm convinced to this day that's\nwhy he chose me. He says he just fell in love with me, he says, but I was the only child with\nlong hair, that's the truth. And I was kind of the poster child. We were wined and dined. We\nwent to dinners. We were on TV, early TV We were on the radio, and Life magazine did a full\nspread and a cover story and yes, they did raise thousands of dollars.\nIn the meantime, I was staying at Mr. Tenzer's home. And well \u2014 no, at the beginning we\nstayed at a posh hotel. Wait a minute, we stayed at a hotel in New York City, and I remember\ngetting served white bread for the first time and corn flake cereal, which I detest to this day,\nbecause \u2014 what is this? White bread, I didn\u2019t \u2014 and the photographers were taking pictures, so\nthey wanted us to look all excited about this, so I looked excited \u2014 but I said \u201cI'm not eating\nthis.\u201d So, and we went shopping in this big department store. I think it was Bonwit Teller\u2019s, and\nI never seen anything like it in my whole life. We got clothes and we got \u2014 I got a stuffed\nanimal, a bear, pink, \u201cCeleste\u201d I called it.

        "Q: How did they find you?\nI: Well, Doctor Kalina knew where he was. So, Doctor Kalina told Rescue Children.\nR: Yes, I was with his sister.\nI: And that\u2019s when I told Mr. and Mrs. Slotkin \u2014 they were thrilled, they said \u201cgreat.\u201d\nNow they're really happy, because they really wanted a boy for so long. See, they just wanted\nyou, Ren\u00e9. But they really spared no expense and it was a trek to get him. I mean a lot of red\ntape. A lot of government officials had to be convinced the justice of this. Money changed\nhands often and it took two years.\nR: It took a long time.",
        "Q: So, how did each of you find out that you were in a particular place?",
        "Q: Were the Mann family upset in some way?\nI: They were in some ways \u2014 I think Mrs. Mann really liked me. I felt that. I never knew\nwhat it's like to love a mother or a father, not even the Slotkins, even though they're angels,\nbecause I realize now what they had done. It's only when you grow a lot older that you realize\nthat here was this family, the Slotkins, and they took an unknown 12 year old boy, I mean, think",
        "Q: Did you write to each other in Czech, German?\nR: I wrote in Czech and I think it was translated.\nI: Then, he started writing simple English.",
        "Q: Tell us about the day you met.\nR: It was March 29, 1950. I landed at Idlewild Airport with Mr. Enright'!. It was a misty\nnight. Did we...? It was my mother that came to pick us up, my father wasn't out there. I call\nthem mother and father, because they're the only ones that I knew. He was out of town\nsomewhere, but we came in, we came to the house. I think it was so late at night that we didn't\nsee. I don't remember seeing you that night. I think we just went to sleep. They gave us their\nbedroom, the master bedroom of the house, Mr. Enright and myself had that, and I don't know\nwhere the rest of them were. But I remember seeing you first in the morning on that path in the\nfront of the house. That's my first recollection of seeing you, meeting you.\nI: Yes, I remember it was the front.\nR: In the front of the house. And to me it was like when I saw her in Auschwitz, the look,\ndidn't say a word.\nI: Not a word. We didn't say anything, we just \u2014\nR: But okay, now it's all right.\nI: People are always surprised. They expect that fire works went off, but it was not like that\nat all. It was just...\nR: Very long trip.\nI: But we never spoke about anything that happened. We just became very American \u2014\nlike that.\nR: I was even in the American Army, would you believe. The National Guard, Fort Dix \u2014\nthat's where I had my basic training. People told me that I was really nuts, but \u2014\n\u201c Maurice Enright, member of the executive committee of Rescue\nChildren, Inc.

        "Q: Irene, if we can just go back for a moment, when you were with Mrs. Mucha, she did\nsomething very bizarre with you. Can you describe it?\nI: Yes. Every once in a while she would take me, I didn\u2019t really realize where at the time,\nbut we would sift through ashes looking for gold teeth, and I realized that the surroundings were\nkind of familiar when I got there. I guess she was taking me back to Auschwitz-Birkenau and\nwe were looking for gold teeth. And by this time, I understood that a lot of people had died here\nand had been set ablaze here. And it was a very difficult thing for me to do but \u2014 and I had \u2014\nshe insisted that I do this. I had to come up with some gold teeth.",
        "Q: So, she didn't shift through it?\nI: She also sifted. We both did.",
        "Q: And if you didn't come up with gold teeth?\nI: I had to come up with gold teeth.",
        "Q: And this was more than once?\nI: Yes.",
        "Q: You were talking, Ren\u00e9, about being in the National Guard?\nR: Yeah. I joined the National Guard in the early 60s, maybe even '59 it was. I don't\nremember exactly. I was an observant Jew and I saw nothing wrong with it. I saw nothing\nwrong with having my arm bared, which was many times. There I remember the showers very\nclearly. The army showers. I had my head shaved, it was really funny, now that I think about it.\nI was surprised that it was only like a decade or so after the war, the World War II and the\nignorance of the people when they saw my arm. They were like, \u201cIt's your phone number, it's\nyour social security number? Is it your...\u201d they really had no idea. And then, coupled with my\nwearing a hat or a yarmulke in the mess hall, and usually carrying my own food in or asking for\ncertain food to be prepared. I was surprised at the negative feelings that I got. Well, maybe it's\nthe wrong word, surprised. That's the way it's been all my life all over, but I thought, \u201cIn the\narmy \u2014 the American Army, we're sharing something.\u201d I was such a good soldier. A\nmarksman, my company commander was very proud of me. I was his only Jew, but I was the\nbest, so, but it was surprising, that so shortly after the war, there was still ignorance and these\nnegative feelings about Jews.",
        "Q: When they asked you, \u201cIs this your telephone number?\u201d I mean, clearly you said \u201cno,\u201d\nbut did you say \u2014?\nR: I told them what it was. I said \u2014 I explored it with them \u2014 \u201cYou really don't know what\nthis is?\u201d and they didn't. Then, I told them, and they still weren't quite sure what to make of that.\n\u201cWas it a Jewish symbol? Did it make you a Jew?\u201d I said, \u201cNo, this is man's symbol of\ninhumanity to another man. Tattooing instead of giving me a name, giving me a number.\u201d You\nknow, I tried to explain it. Some got it, some didn't.",
        "Q: Tell me something. At this point, in the 60s, what did you know about where you were at\nthat time in the 40s? Did you know it was Auschwitz?\nR: Yeah, but that's as much as I knew and that's as much as I care to know, and that's as\nmuch as I discussed with Irene. We never talked about it. We knew where we came from and\nthat was enough.",
        "Q: So, you went into the National Guard after high school?\nR: Pretty much, yeah. It was college really.",
        "Q: Was this like ROTC?\nR: No, it was not a continuous \u2014 I did go into ROTC, but I cut out of their program and that\nwould have led me into a two year stint and I wasn't ready for it. I went on to college, after I was\nmarried.",
        "Q: Did you go to school, Irene?\nI: Yes.",
        "Q: You studied biochemistry, you said?\nI: Right, right. Iam a biochemist. I never spoke about the Holocaust, because I \u2014 as I said\n\u2014 | had this feeling that nobody ever really wanted to hear about it. Also, our parents kind of\ntold us, you know, \u201cit\u2019s best,\u201d and what was everybody\u2019s feeling, \u201cYou were young, forget about\nit. You've got a new life, and just, you know, put the past out of your minds.\u201d In a way, I did\nthat. I listened. I said, \u201cOkay, great. I'm American. I'll put 1t out of my mind.\u201d But, in a way, I\nwas suffering twice. I had already suffered, and now I was suffering, because I couldn't even\ntalk about it. It made me feel like maybe there was something to really be ashamed about,\nbecause nobody wanted to know about it. And as I went through high school, I remember the\nHolocaust was not even mentioned. We learned the world history. We learned about World War\nII, but \u2014 and this was a yeshiva! So, it was pretty frightening to me, I \u2014 and then when I got to\ncollege, it was pretty much the same thing. I found that my friends knew very little about the\nHolocaust. Nobody spoke about it. There weren't any programs yet, and I really \u2014 it just\nreconfirmed for me that it was something that I need to be ashamed of and I don't want anybody\nto know that I am a survivor. But then, when I got a little braver, and they started having some",
        "Q: They didn't see your tattoo?\nI: Right, because I always hid it. I hid it. I wore long sleeves. I wore long sleeves, I wore\nBand-Aids. Ren\u00e9 never did. Ren\u00e9 always showed it clearly, and after a while, I also stopped\ncovering it up, but I remember in particular when I gave birth to my daughter Lori, a nurse came\ninto my room and she saw my number and she ran out terrified. She thought I was a prisoner, an\nescaped prisoner, 1965.",
        "Q: Did you folks read Diary of Anne Frank, when it came out?\nI: Yes, I did.\nR: I didn't.",
        "Q: That's in the 50s, right?\nI: Yes.",
        "Q: Did that provoke something in you?\nI: Yes. I was very moved and touched by it, but I couldn't quite \u2014 I'm searching for the\nright word. I didn't connect to it. Her story was so very different. And in some ways, I thought\nit was better, you know. At least she had her family and so they were in hiding and however\nhorrible that was, at least they had each other for a long time. So...",
        "Q: Do you know that she went to Auschwitz from that book?\nI: No.\nR: I found it yesterday in the Museum's archives, in the Auschwitz Chronicles.\nI: I found out sooner than that, but I didn't from that book realize that she had been.",
        "Q: So, they never kept the boys and the girls together, the twins?\nI: I don't think so. I think maybe younger ones possibly, but\u2014\nR: I don't think there were any. I don't know.",
        "Q: Did you talk with your kids?\nI: No. I did make an attempt. At one time, I was actually at my mom's house and Lori was\nasking me about my number and I was trying to tell her that it was something horrible that\nhappened and that I'm adopted and my mother got very upset. She said, \u201cYou don't have to tell\nher these things.\u201d\nR: The Slotkins, in all their good qualities and beautiful intentions, they slipped up over here\na little bit. They were a little over protective, I think. They really tried to hide the truth, in a way\nof protecting us, really. I don't think they had anything else in mind.\nI: But it backfired, because the more they said don't talk about it, the more it was still\nalways there, because it's always with me and not being able to express it or tell or share any of it\nwas really hard.",
        "Q: Let me go back for a moment. When you saw each other for the first time, when you\nwere finally together, even though you didn't talk, did that stimulate nightmares or\nremembrances or bad dreams that you woke up from? I mean do you have any recollection\nwhether there was something that happened other than safety when you found each other?\nI: For me, I had some of the remembrances we spoke about when we were children. And\nso, when I saw him, \u201cNow I have finally have somebody I can check some of this stuff out with.\u201d\nI think we did check some of that pre stuff out that we never spoke about after Theresienstadt. It\nwas only what happened before. That's how we spoke about the doll and about the bee sting and\na couple of things like that. So, that was nice to confirm.",
        "Q: So, it didn't bring out \u2014?",
        "Q: Now, did you become a teacher when you studied biochemistry?\nI: No, I went into research, but I did teach for a while, too.",
        "Q: So what happens in the 80s?\nI: Well, in 1985, it was probably in December we got a call from Eva Kor!\u201d who was the\nfounder and remains the president of an organization called CANDLES, which stands for\nChildren of Auschwitz Nazi Deadly Lab Experiment Survivors, it's a mouthful, God!\nCANDLES. And she told us that they're going to have a reunion, a first time reunion of all\nsurviving twins in Israel, and that we were going to bring Joseph Mengele in absentia to a\ntribunal and Gideon Hausner!? was going to chair it and are you going to come? We were just\n\u2014as I said before, I said, \u201cYou mean we're not the only children to survive Auschwitz?\u201d But it\nwas a drawing card, I think, for Ren\u00e9 and myself. For me, I had a tremendous need to find\nsomebody who knew me. I wanted to be affirmed in some way. \u201cOh please, let me \u2014\nsomebody knows me, so they can tell me what exactly happened. And are my memories, they're\nso bizarre, can they be real?\u201d And so, we decided we'd do it. And, you know, it's in retrospect\nnow, because we did that and we started talking to each other and heard some of the other twins\nand some of their testimonies and it was like, \u201cAh-ha, that's what happened to me!\u201d You know,\nwe realized that our memories were true, as bizarre as they might be, they really happened, and\nsubsequently, we were able to research out a lot of our past, because we started looking into\nhistory books and original documentation from Auschwitz and Givat Chaim\" in Israel, we\nstarted piecing together dates and occurrences. We were also very fortunate to have a lot of\nphotographs that were saved by our aunt for us and letters and documentations, birth certificates\nand such. So, it's wonderful.\nR: It's like finding roots. Roots is very important in American history.",
        "Q: Were you as surprised as Irene that there were other children? Or did you know there\nwere?\n* Eva Kor (1935- ); Auschwitz survivor and author of Echoes from\nAuschwitz: Dr. Mengele\u2019s Twins, the story of Eva and Miriam\nMozes. Eva Kor with Mary Wright, Echoes from Auschwitz: Dr.\nMengele\u2019s Twins, the story of Eva and Miriam Mozes (Haute Terre,\nInd.: Candles, Inc., 1995).\n* Gideon Hausner (1915- ); Israeli lawyer and statesman who\nserved as chief prosecutor in the Eichmann Trial.\n\u201c Kibbutz in central Israel, founded by Austrian and Czech Jews\nand named for Chaim Arlosoroff.",
        "Q: What did that do? I mean, it's clear what it did for you probably together and for\nyourself, but when you came back to the United States in terms of your friends, in terms of your\nparents?\nI: Well, our dad was already dead, and my mom, we started \u2014 I started giving talks on\nYom Ha-Shoah!>. It's one of the things I still do. And we were in the news media a lot at that\ntime, and I think my mom was kind of proud, but she didn't want to hear it. She's never come to\nhear me talk. She never came. She's dead now, but she never came, and she never wanted to\nhear about it. I could not talk to her about it at all, absolutely not.",
        "Q: Did that hurt you?\nI: It's hard, yes.\nR: Yeah, it's hard, because here is somebody who certainly loves you and wants to do\nabsolutely the best, and yet somehow doesn't have enough strength or wisdom to be sensitive to\nunderstand that this other person has to express or wants to \u2014 I mean, we really didn't want to\ngo and spill our guts out, just a little bit. I think maybe part of it was that she really wanted to\nplay the mother role. She was the only mother. She was afraid of maybe losing that. I'm just\ntalking now. We don't know, we really don't know. But her motivation was pure, I know that,\nabsolutely pure.",
        "Q: Did it shock your friends?\nI: I had some friends who were totally taken aback, they said, \u201cBut you're so American.\nYou don't talk like a European. You don't look like, you know.\u201d And \u2014 but the truth of it is,\nthat even though I'm so \"American,\" because I knew how to fit in, the truth is that everything I\ndid and everything I excelled at, whether it was in school or being, I mean, I made my parents \u2014\nright, I was the salutatorian of the class, the editor of the newspaper, the yearbook, the \u2014 you\nname it, I did it \u2014 but always there was that feeling like I was apart. I never \u2014 never felt a part\nof anything. There was always a wall someplace. I said, \u201cYou guys don't know what I know.\u201d\nAnd I remember when I first even started school here. I remember the kids would talk out of turn\nin class or they didn't bring in the homework and I said, \u201cMy God, how can you do that?\u201d I said,\n\u201cHow can you do that?\u201d",
        "Q: You were a good girl?\nR: Just generally, I think the European school system is so different. I remember, I used to,\nother than the unpleasant things, I used to have to bring my own stick to school, in case I\nmisbehaved and get hit on my hands. So, there was this big theory to get a very thin stick, then it\nwill really sting, or get a fat stick, and it will really hurt. This was a big problem.",
        "Q: Were you in classes together through high school?\nR: Yes, through high school.\nI: In our English classes we were together, but in Hebrew we were separated.",
        "Q: Was that fun to be in school together?\nI: No.\nR: No.\nI: No, it wasn\u2019t.",
        "Q: Why?\nR: The class was really too small. I think there were only 11 of us, because this was the\nbeginning of a school there, we were always the eldest \u2014 we were senior class in yeshiva, right.\nEven if we were juniors or sophomores or freshmen, we were always the oldest. There were \u2014\nnobody older than us, so it was too close.\nI: It was too close. We weren't the same kind of student.\nR: She was a student, I was a playboy.",
        "Q: What did you end up doing \u2014 since we know what Irene ended up doing?\nR: I ended up getting married early and out of the house, making a mistake doing that, I\nthink, but as God's ways are so strange, everything I've done in my life has led up to what we're\non now. And I can see the whole picture now and it's not so bad. I paid my dues, but I have the\nmost wonderful wife in the world, the wonderful wife, the best, and I have the best kids and the\nbest grandchildren, so I'm happy.",
        "Q: What did you do for a living?\nI: I worked in the packaging field all my life. Packaging.",
        "Q: Do the two of you live near each other?\nI: Relatively, I live on Long Island, he lives in Manhattan. And I also have the best family,\nRen\u00e9. So, you know, I have the best kids too. I don't have any grandkids yet, but I definitely\nhave the best great-grand whatever they are to me.",
        "Q: Right, Ren\u00e9 was just made a grandfather twice?\nR: Last week, right.\nI: I also do calligraphy and write poetry.\nR: She's very talented.\nI: I don't know if I'm talented, but...\nR: What this '85 thing also did for us, 1t made the two of us talk. Not during any session at\nhome, we would not talk about it. Like in between sessions in the hotel room, we would talk\nabout it, and that's the only time we talk about it. We'll go home now and we're not going to talk\nabout this, but we talked about it a little bit this morning or last night on the way to the airport,\nand that's it. It's just something that is not really, I guess \u2014 it's not pleasant. It's unnerving. It\ntakes a lot out of, out of you, but we've done it now since '85. We've talked because we feel it's\nreally necessary, and the further we go away from it, the more necessary, I think, it becomes\nbecause we see a lot of funny things going on out there, in terms of did it really happen? Did it",
        "Q: Is there anything more you'd like to say?\nI: I'm going to say that this has been painful for me to do, even though Ren\u00e9 says we've\nbeen doing it now since '85. I, I'm always disturbed for days on end after I've done it, but I agree\nwith Ren\u00e9 that it's something that we need to do for our children, so that they can pass on the\nstory, because it must never be forgotten, and I guess that's why I do it.\nR: I have to say again that what's happening today, we are meeting up with people that are\nusing the story for their own purpose and, obviously, if they're using a story that's not true,\nthey're changing it. That is we can't stand by, as hurtful as it is to question a survivor, because I\nknow when somebody asks me a question, it's got to be done. It's got to be done to pollute the\nhistory of something like this, it\u2019Il lose any potential for learning something from it.\nI: Well, the historical integrity of the Holocaust must really be upheld and it's got to be\ndone with the truth.\nR: And I think more people when they put somebody in the front or recognize by whatever\nslight means, survivor, I think at this point have to question and document that person.",
        "Q: Well, I thank you very much. You showed your tattoo, would you be willing to\nphotograph your tattoo? What's the number?\nI: 70917.\nR: That's an old looking tattoo.\nI: It's 50 years old, baby.",
        "Q: Yours is much smaller?\nR: No, not really.",
        "Q: Yours is 169061.\nI: We've been trying to find out what my mom's number might have been. We didn't find\nout yet.\nR: We suspect it was probably close to that number, but we don't know.",
        "Q: This was in 1942.\nI: It's April 1950 and this is where Ren\u00e9 and I saw each other for the first time since the\nwar. It's our home in America and the front walk is where we met.\nConclusion of Interview"

        "I: I remember the inside a little bit. I remember that our crib was kind of on a diagonal, it\nseemed to me, it was like one room. The kitchen was like down there, but we were like in the\nfront where we could look out the window. Do you remember that?\nR: No.\nI: And there was a bed for our parents also in that room. We were all in this one room kind\nof apartment.\nR: I do remember a terrace.\nI: And a terrace, yes.\nR: The terrace I remember because one stormy day there were like leaves, the wind, the\nleaves going by and I remember things falling down from that. As a matter of fact, your doll\nonce went over.\nI: Right. I had a doll and Ren\u00e9 threw her down off the terrace and smashed my doll. I\nremember that, too.\nR: Those are our first, I think, those are my first memories.\nI: Yes, pretty much.",
        "R: I was?\nI: Yeah, mine always fell, but yours were good.\nR: I don't remember this.\nI: Ido. I also remember some of our clothing. In the winter we had these nubby jackets\nlike maybe made from lambs' wool or something. They're like curly. I don't know what it was,\nand, then on top of that, we had these harnesses with bells so you could hear us jingle and I guess\nthat was a good way to keep track of us. Our Mom must have held on to us that way.\nR: Yes, that I remember, the bells.",
        "R: So maybe it was, now that I'm a few years older, it could have been a post office too, but\nthat's not the feeling I had. The feeling was that he was there, or this is where we made\nconnection with him.\nI: But you're right, it could have been a post office and perhaps she was sending things to\nGermany.\nR: Or wherever.\nI: Or wherever.\nR: Wherever he was.\nI: Right.",
        "I: Well, we know now, we just found out that he actually died.\nR: Three weeks ago.\nI: We just found out three weeks ago from the Chronicles of Auschwitz! that he actually\nwas executed December 18, 1941.\nR: It's in there. The name, a number.\nI: So \u2014 the soldiers must have come. I do remember it was winter, so it must have been\nabout a month or two before.",
        "I: And I also remember there, that \u2014 I think we used to wait on line there. I think we used\nto wait on lines. Or maybe that's earlier, I'm not sure. And then something strange. I remember\nmusic. I remember music. Music, so that later on when I heard certain things, they like sounded\nlike, \u201cOh, I know that,\u201d and I don't know it, and I shouldn't know it, because I've never heard it,\nlike, \u201cYes, I've heard this.\u201d So, I don't remember what our mom did or whether we actually \u2014 I\ncan't remember what we did during a day or \u2014. I really don't.\nR: No, I don't either. The only real strong memory I have 1s the picture taking session, and I\nthink we have that picture of my mom and us leaning on her shoulder. I can almost feel the\nmaterial on her dress. It was very coarse, rough, wool like and can almost smell it. That's my\nreal only recollection of feeling my mother. That's the only thing. That really was very\npowerful. That happened in Theresienstadt, I know now. Do you remember that picture taking?\nI: Vaguely, not as clear on detail as you.\nR: Well, it made an impression on me. I don't remember the circumstances, but I'll never\nforget that feel.\nI: The next memory I have shortly after that is us walking. It was night time, through the\nsnow and our mom had a suitcase that she was dragging along and I remember I didn't, I kind of\ndidn't want to go wherever it was that we were going. I remember she gave me a real yank, like\n\u201cyou just come!\u201d\u2019 That's when I remember her presence because I remember her actually pulling\nme.\nR: I guess I was going peacefully because I don't remember the pulling. I do remember that\nnight, though, and I remember dogs.\nI: Yes, yes, there were dogs barking. Then we got on a train.\nR: That train ride, I remember. This now we now know this was the train ride to Auschwitz.\nBut the combination of heat, odor, crammed quarters, the sighs, the agony of it in the car. You\nheard the people just die.\nI: There was moaning.\nR: It was horrible.\nI: And being little it was like hard to, you know, it was just \u2014 all these bodies kind of next\nto you and I remember I just wanted to, like, I wanted to lie down.\nR: Yes, right. We couldn't lie down for some reason.\nI: There was no place.",
        "R: There was no place or there wasn't room, or it was too dirty or it was like \u2014 nowhere to\nlie down.\nI: You couldn't. There was no place. You just kind of had to stay the way you got on. And\n\u2014 but we didn't cry.\nR: No.\nI: We didn't.",
        "I: I kind of remember a moan or a cry here and there. But no, I don't, I think everybody was\nscared. I think that was the first time that I felt like, \u201cOh my God, what is going to happen?\u201d\nR: I wasn't there yet with that sort of thinking.",
        "everybody went into the same place. We went into this big, like, barn or something. I don't\nknow. It had a thing down the center with stones. Do you remember that?\nR: No, it sounds more like a barrack that you describe.\nI: Maybe.\nR: That's what I was in later.\nI: Well, that's where we were with our mom also and there was just a lot of other people\nthere, as well, with families.\nR: It's possible.",
        "rotten, but still, put it on the stove, and then somehow whatever came out, you ate. That's the\nonly food I ever remember eating.\nI: I remember later on, after we were separated, I vaguely remember that \u2014 I guess\nsomebody gave the food out \u2014 and I remember I thought I was terribly clever at the time,\nbecause I would get this piece of bread and I wasn't that hungry and I figured I'd be so much\nhungrier in the morning, so I decided, \u201cI'll just have bite or two and I'll save this for the\nmorning.\u201d But, of course, when the morning came, the bread was gone. So, I think that the rats\nreally loved me.\nR: Rats? You don't think other people took it from you?\nI: No, I think it was the rats probably. I would like not to think that. I just thought the rats,\nbecause there were rats.\nR: This is very interesting, because this is the Passover season for us now and we break the\nmiddle matzo, we take a portion of it and hide it. That's why it's called poor man's bread and\nthat's exactly what she was doing. She would take a piece of it, eat it, and then hide the rest of it\nand she never got to eat the rest of it.\nI: The worst was that I was so stupid. I just kept doing it over and over again.\nR: You didn't learn a lesson.\nI: Didn't seem to learn.",
        "R: ..from your point of view.\nI: No, no. I remember knowing that something was changing and something horrible was\nabout to take place, and I do remember an SS hitting our mom. I remember she didn't \u2014\nR: You saw this?\nI: I just remember, yes, because we didn't want to let go of her and we were actually\nphysically separated, you know, like kind of torn apart from her, pulled away. I don't know\nwhat, maybe she screamed, but I remember a slap, she was hit. I kind of \u2014if I close my eyes, I\nthink she fell to the floor.\nR: It fits into my thinking. I don't remember it as vividly as you would. It fits.\nI: After that, I don't remember what happened immediately after that.\nR: Really we were hurting, I think I was. I know that was a very emotional time, very, very\nhurtful, and after that, we were, like, we were separated. I remember being separated from you\nbut we were just in different places. I was with the boys, young boys, older boys and men.\nI: I don't know where I was. I was just with other women. I just remember that your\nbarrack, for some strange reason, I always said was a little bit over the right. It was in that\ndirection.\nR: It's funny, I remember directions too, but I have no, I never studied the map of Auschwitz\nor anything. I remember where my barracks was, I remember where the gates were and I\nremember where the crematorium were with respect to my barrack. I remember people walking\ninto this crematorium day and night just about. I couldn't tell you just in my own circle I could\ntell you if you put me there again. Please don't.",
        "I: Well, again, like I said before, my memories aren't consecutive. They're kind of sporadic\nand, very often, things in my everyday life today kind of \u2014 when I'm doing certain things they\nstir and trigger a memory for me that's related to what happened to me in Auschwitz, and my\nmajor memories of Auschwitz are certainly being hungry and cold very often, and I remember\nwatching people running to the electric barbed wire and then they didn't move anymore. I\nremember having to stand outside for very long periods of time. I don't know exactly for what,\njust \u2014 and I always tried to hide. I thought if I wouldn't be seen then that would be good, so I\nalways tried to find somebody taller to stand behind. I remember the barrack. I remember there\nwas this oven or something warm running down the center that you could sit on, on it. I\nremember people sitting on there. I remember one night I was \u2014 I felt extremely alone. I had\ngone to the latrines that were in the back, and I became disoriented, so I forgot on which side of\nthis oven or whatever my bed was on, and I started groping to get into somebody's bunk, because\nI was scared that if they found me wandering around that I'd be beaten. What happened was so\nunexpected, because wherever I tried to get in, the hands were just pushing me away saying,\n\u201cthis 1s not your place, this is not your place.\u201d\nI: It was almost dawn before some kind person finally said, \u201cCome in and be with me.\u201d\nAnd it just stuck with me all the time. I can still feel so unwanted, you know, like nobody cared.\nR: I don't believe \u2014 that's so \u2014 I never really heard this. I remember you saying once that\nyou couldn't find your way back, but I never heard the explanation of it. If I may, I think just the\nstanding in line or standing outside for great periods, I remember that too, but I remember that as\nroll call. There were lines, we were made to stand in lines. They might not have been the same\nlines, but we had, we had to stand in lines and numbers and names were yelled and down and up\nand down the line and the soldiers, soldier, officer, whoever very often stopped at somebody and\njust hit them and knocked them down to the ground for apparently no reason, but this happened\nalmost all the time. I mean, I seen that many, many times happening over and over again.\nI: I kind of also remember people being beaten or punished for whatever. I'm not sure what\nit was that they had done, but I also remember seeing somebody hang. I don't know where, but I\nremember once, I don't know what was going on, but I felt I needed to hide. I don't know where\nthis was exactly, but there were, I actually found myself hiding with dead bodies. I don't know\nfrom what exactly either, but that's a memory. I, of course, have unfortunately a lot of memories\nof the hospital and the doctor's office.\nI: I seem to recall spending a great deal of time there, and also being in the hospital and\nbeing very sick, and I know one time, when I went to the doctor's office, that they took blood\nfrom me and it was extremely painful because it was from the left side of my neck. That's a\nstrange thing to remember. I also remember having blood taken out of my finger, but that wasn't\nquite so bad. I also remember having to sit very still for long periods to be measured or weighed\nor in x-rays. I remember x-rays, x-rays and injections. I remember injections, and then I'd be\nsick. Because then I'd be in this hospital, and I remember having a high fever, because I know",

I remember something with electric\nwires, but I just remember \u2014 because always after the war, you know me, I'm so crazy, I can't\nstand to touch an electric wire. I get, I actually have like an anxiety attack. For a long time, I\nused to have anxiety attacks when I would have to plug in an outlet and it was especially painful\nto me, because I went to school and I majored in biochemistry and I taught physics and biology\nand I would have to do these experiments with the class and I would have to plug these things in\nand I'd get these horrible anxiety attacks when it had to do with electrical things and magnets and\nthings like that in physics. I was a wreck.\nI: I remember some kind of shock, don't know. And the thing that you refer about being\ncut, again, it's just a vague thing of being on an icy cold table and I don't know why I keep seeing\neyes, and it just I know that there was a doctor there and he had an instrument. Like, it looked\nlike a knife, obviously, it wasn't a knife, but it was something, and I remember him just kind of\ntouching me with it and I, that's it. I don't remember anything else about that.

That was just about the experience with the hospital, very\nminimal compared to Irene's. My barrack was, I think, one of those long things with a stove in\nthe middle or whatever that brick structure was. I used that to bake rotten potatoes on and to sit\non and warm on. Sleeping in the bunks, I just remember that smell of that wood against my nose\nand splinters also, because that wasn't soft wood. It was raw wood, very raw because you could\nreally smell it. It was just about the only refreshing smell, fresh kind of an odor that you had\nthere. It was woodsy, it was wood. I remember very clearly going to sleep, because I was near\nthe wood. Cold always, hungry always. I remember asking who's the master of the world, who\nruns this, who's the master of the world. I was told Hitler \u2014 Hitler\u2014 but I didn't question\nanything. This was the norm. This was the way things were, but I did have friends, which Irene\ndidn't. I think the men, the older men, sort of took care of one another in some special way that\nthe women didn't. I don't know why. I do remember getting a pair of shoes once. I don't know\nwhy I know this. I got a pair of shoes which didn't quite fit. They were brown, tall, going over\nthe ankles, but they cost somebody a loaf of bread.

It was\nhorrible all the time, but what I remembered is waiting in line naked. Standing outside naked\nwaiting on line to get into the showers and sometimes we'd stand out there for many hours it\nseemed and somehow I remember that was scary, because I don't know now, but I knew that\nsometimes you didn't get your clothes at the end of this shower and you weren't going to be able\nto come back. But again, being probably silly child, at one time I had a locket from my mother\nthat I wore around my neck and I knew that when we undressed for the showers if anybody saw\nthis, it would be real trouble, but I was brazen enough to think that I could actually get away with\nhiding this in my hands, so I do remember taking it off my neck and holding it very tightly in my\nhand to get into the shower and I probably lost it then right in the shower because \u2014 didn't come\nout with it but I remember it was an act of defiance on my part.

        "I: So when finally \u2014 there, I, what I subsequently learned was when the Joint Distribution\nor Agudah\u00ae or somebody finally was sending people to take out the children from these Catholic\nhomes and they came to take me out, I did not want to leave and I was extremely upset at having\nto leave, to leave. We went to Bratislava and there it was some kind of a home where there were\nother people. It seemed to be a waiting place where you got then sent elsewhere. This was just a\nvery temporary place and that's where I met a very dear friend who then went to Israel and I'm\nfriends with her to this day, and we would sit there with our rosary beads talking about how we\nwere going to escape from this place because we'd said, \u201cThis is \u2014 look at them they're so dirty.\nThey don't prepare things.

I\nwent down and, believe me, I was in pain, my arm was blown up too. I bring breakfast to\neverybody. I took breakfast to everybody. Very strange child. Anything so that I could be a\nlittle special. That's really what it was. I wanted to be special. And I was also \u2014 a lot of the\nchildren from that \u2014 it was a period of time when a lot of children were being shipped to Israel.\nI remember, I don't know how the sequence of time, but I remember that our Aunt Paula \u2014 we\nfound out that our mom had a sister in England \u2014 and our Aunt Paula was contacted about us\nand I did know that I had Ren\u00e9. I didn't know where he was, but I knew that I had a brother, and\nbut I remember hearing through the grapevine that she really didn't want us. I guess she had her\nown, she had a child at that time. I think things were perhaps not so great in England at that\ntime, and I guess she just didn't have room for the two of us. That was, I sort of think I took it\nlightly then, but maybe I didn't, because it was just another reject. And I was trying so hard to be\ngood, all the time. And then it came time and my friend Miriam was going to be going to Israel\nand I wanted very much to go with her as well, but it was not my luck, because in the interim,\nthere was a Mr. Herbert Tenzer\u2019 who had formed an organization here called Rescue Children*\u00ae\nand he would visit, he also had connection with Barton's Candy, and we kids were crazy about\nhim because he would bring candy and \u2014 but the best thing was American gum. That was the\nbest. Forget the candy, American gum. That was it for me.\nI: But it seemed somehow he \u2014 of all the children, he decided to pick me to come to the\nUnited States to raise money for the other homes that Agudah or Po\u2019el ha-Mizrachi\u2019, or whoever\nwas running them. He picked me and another boy from another orphanage in France, by the\nname of Charles Karo, and I remember being extremely distraught about this, because I want to\ngo with my friend Miriam. I remember I was promised, \u201cjust for a little bit you'll go to\nAmerica.\u201d \u2014 like I knew what America was, who cared? I just knew I was being taken away \u2014\n\u2018and you know then you'll come back here and we'll send you to Israel and you'll be with\nMiriam.\u201d And of course, I believed them. And talking about candy just brought to mind a very\nearly time. It must have been someplace between Bratislava and Fublaines where I might have\nbeen at another orphanage. I was very little and there was a room, it must have been whoever\nwas running the orphanage and there was candy underneath this bed, hard candy and they all got\nme to crawl under and get the candy for them, and I was caught.

I never played, and they wanted me to play dolls and Monopoly. I\ndidn't know how to play anything, so I failed, and so after my visit with them, they decided that I\nwas not the right child, but that they would take Charlie instead, because Charlie was very\noutgoing and he was funny and he had an impish smile and he had the dimples.

He had a good time. He skied, he learned how\nto do all nice things.\nR: I really lucked out on this. I was in Paris, in the Grand Hotel. They would \u2014 I would go\nto see movies, English movies because in preparation getting the language.\nI: Not bad.\nR: It was very good.\nI: I was struggling with school and stuff.\nR: I saw Elizabeth Taylor in the original Black Beauty. I mean, I remember her blue eyes\nand dark skin. I thought she was magnificent. She was very young then \u2014 it was a real girl.\nSome of the cowboys, Tom Mix.\nI: Lone Ranger.\nR: That\u2019s much later \u2014 this is in Europe. The Abbot and Costello movies, these was what\nwas being shown then, and I was made to go and see these, so I would catch on to the English.\nI: Tough life he had.\nR: Then they sent me to school in Switzerland where I learned Hebrew and to ski. It wasn't\nthe purpose. The purpose was \u2014 They couldn't somehow get through the red tape to get me\nover.",
        "about it, with certainly not a great background. Certainly questionable, a little bit, to just bring\nhim and adopt him. It was like an unbelievable thing to do, but Irene paved the way.\nI: I paved the way. They loved me \u2014 they figured you had to be right.",
        "I: When I went to school here, I went to yeshiva and I also even here I was ashamed of\nwhat had happened to me, because they never taught anything about the Holocaust and I had the\nnumber and I always wanted to hide it, so my mom did get makeup and every\u2014 anytime in the\nsummer or spring when I was wearing short sleeves, we would doctor it up in the morning, take\nan extra ten minutes of my life in the morning to do, because I didn't want anybody to know that\nI had been in this, because I felt that 1t was something to be ashamed of. And I remember once a\nteacher asking me \u2014 and this was already I was in high school \u2014 and he asked me this question,\nhe said to me, \u201cIf everybody in this country were to vote that we should kill all the Jews would\nthat still be a democracy?\u201d He's asking me, me of all the children in that school, so I guess what\nI'm trying to say 1s there was very little sensitivity and, even among teachers or my classmates,\npeople just didn't know what to do with it. I was the only child survivor that they had ever seen\nthat was in that school and, of course until Ren\u00e9 came, and they just \u2014 I remember history and\nnothing. Never talked about this. So, I was ashamed to talk about it too, plus that our parents\nsaid, \u201cforget about it, this is a new life, be American,\u201d and I already had learned to fit in, so I\nknew how to do that. I became very American, right?\nR: So did I. It was time to be drafted or join, I chose to join, but they told me, \u201cYou'll get\noff, just tell them what you are. You can't be near guns, near war. You've had it. I didn't feel\nthat, I really had the fear.\u201d So I said, \u201cNo, I'll have to go through it,\u201d and I did. Of course, I took\nlot of abuse, again in the army, because of the number. Total ignorance. They people didn't\nknow and this I'm talking about 1960, about 1960. Not so far away from the war and you'd think\nthat people would know, but totally insensitive.\nEnd of Tape 2",

        "Holocaust reunions, I kind of would venture forth and say, \u201cI am a survivors.\u201d From the\nsurvivors I got, \u201cYou can't be, you're too young. Couldn't be. Children didn't survive. They said\nwhere were you?\u201d I said \u201cAuschwitz-Birkenau. Couldn't be. Children didn't survive.\u201d I said,\n\u201cBut I and my brother did. We did.\u201d \u201cNo, you have it mixed up.\u201d So, another negative. So, I\nstopped, I kind of stopped talking about it. I didn't say anything. I think my kids knew, my\nhusband knew that I was a survivor, but I think the floodgates broke loose in 1985 and friends\nwho had known me for years, who hadn't had a clue that I was a survivor, were shocked.",
        "R: Can I backtrack just once? It just came to mind that this loneliness that we talked about.\nWhen twins were in Auschwitz and they had their own sex partner with them, there \u2014 they had\nsomebody with them. We were separate because of our sex difference, so this made it \u2014\nI: It added to the isolation.\nR: Do you remember seeing girl twins together?\nI: Oh, sure. I was jealous. I was jealous of them because I felt they had somebody and I\nhad nobody. That's why I was always hiding and\u2014",
        "I: No.",
        "R: That didn't play such an important part because I didn't need \u2014 I didn't feel like I had to\nbe okay by anybody. I was okay. I was surprised though when I saw the numbers. And there\nmust have been about 100.\nI: Right, about 120.\nR: One hundred and twenty from all over the world, and some of the stories we've heard\nwere more bizarre than even ours, believe me. Some of the stories \u2014 because I think older\npeople \u2014 most of the people are older \u2014 one hundred percent of them were older than us, and\nthey were more caught up in this thing emotionally. That's my own private theory, that when\nyou're older, your emotions are hurt much more. You have more understanding of what's really\ngoing on, so you were hurt more. And the stories that they told with the emotions behind them\nwere really, really \u2014 but I don't know, Irene, you never find anybody who recognized you?\nI: No, I was the one who was looking for somebody to recognize me. But again\u2014\nR: I was recognized by people. I didn't recognize them, but they recognized me, so I must\nhave made an impression on somebody, which was okay with me.",

The photo on\nthe right is again Ren\u00e9 and myself with my dad, and it's about the same time. Ren\u00e9 is on the left\nand I'm on the right with my dad, because Ren\u00e9 has the droopy eyes.
