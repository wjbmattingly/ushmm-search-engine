        "A: My name is Samuel Spiegel. I was born in , Poland on August the 23rd,\n1922. I had three more sisters and a brother. I was the oldest one. We had a shoe factory\nat home, and my mother passed away in childbirth and I was four years old. Then my\nfather remarried a year later. We had a pretty normal living until the war broke out. I\nwouldn't say we were rich, but we were middle class. We lived pretty nicely. Then when\nthe war broke out in 1939 it was September Ist a bomb fell into the house. It was about\n7:00 in the morning and we were lucky to get out about five minutes before, and nobody\ngot hurt. But, this was only the beginning because the minute the Germans came in,\nthings started to get very bad for us. It was September when school starts again, and\nJewish kids were not allowed to go to school anymore. But, the Jewish community\nopened up some little Jewish schools that the kids went to so they can learn a little bit. In\n1940, the middle of 1940, the Germans gave an order that we have to give away all the\njewelry and all the furs that all the people had, and we gave everything away, but we\nthought it's a war, maybe they need it and things are going to get a little bit better. Things\nstarted getting worse and by the end of 1941 they made the Ghetto in our town.",
        "Q: Actually, I just want to go back a little bit before you describe the Ghetto. A little more\nbackground, was your family religious and also before the war did you mingle with\nPolish kids or did you feel any anti semitism?",
        "A: Before the war, I went to school, which was a public school, but there were very few\nJewish kids in our class of 55 kids, there were about six Jewish kids. They must sit on\none side, the left side of the class. Mostly it was a catholic school and prayers were said\nevery morning and every night before we went home from school. We just stood there,\nbut the Jewish kids didn't have to say the prayer. We mixed with the friends that I had in\nschool, but socially we hadn't mixed. Sometimes when they needed some help, some\nschool help, they used to come to my house, and I used to help them out a little bit, but\notherwise, they had different friends and we had different friends. Because I went to\nschool from early in the morning until about 2:00 in the afternoon. 2:00 we used to come\nhome and have our main meal. Then I used to go to a Jewish school to learn religion. I\nusually didn't come home until about 6:00 in the evening. Then, at night my father was\nvery active and designed this movement in those days, so I used to go to a Hebrew\nSchool which was called a Tabut, and that's usually how my schooling was, because\nwhen the war broke out, I was about 16 1/2 close to 17 years old.",
        "Q: So your family was religious and involved in Jewish activity?",
        "A: Very involved, but I wouldn't say very religious, more like conservative.",
        "Q: He was involved in political organizations?",
        "A: A little bit. I was younger. I don't remember exactly, but I know he was involved in\norganizations quite a lot.",
        "Q: Did you ever experience any attacks or any --?",
        "A: Usually around Easter or Christmas time, the Jewish people used to be a little bit afraid\nand they used to lock their doors because what they preached mostly in the churches.\nWhen they come home and they have a couple drinks or so, things were pretty rough, but\notherwise we didn't have any problems.",
        "Q: Were you aware of what was going on in Germany at this point?",
        "A: No, we were aware very little of what was going on in Germany. Even when the Germans\ncame in, we figured it's a war maybe things are going to change a little bit, but they\nclosed in every time, there came some new rules out and it got to be very bad for the\nJewish people.",
        "Q: How large was your town?",
        "A: Our town had about close to 10,000 population. 4,500 of it were Jews, close to 50\npercent.",
        "Q: Business and that was fairly integrated?",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Now, you told me when the Germans came into in your town and bomb fell on your\nhouse, what was going on?",
        "A: September the Ist?",
        "Q: Yes, what was happening?",
        "A: We ran out from the house, then we had to get another place to live. I think we moved in\nwith our grandmother for a little while in a room just to stay until things straightened a\nlittle bit out. Then when they moved us in and we stayed there for a while, and I got sick\nin 1940, I had the typhus, and I was lucky they put me away in a separate room and\nnobody found out about it, and I survived somehow the typhus. Then I worked for the\nJewish Community Center at home, because the Germans, when they made the Ghetto,\nmade like the Judenaut which was a self -- you know the Jews governed themselves and I\nworked in the office over there for them, until I sent away to , to the slave\nlabor camp. Things got very bad in the Ghetto. There was a lot of sickness, a lot of\npoverty. We didn't get enough food to eat to feed the people, but we helped each other as\nmuch as we could as a community. Because we still lived in our own homes, and we had\nsome little things we could trade for food with the farmers from the outside and I even\nhad a paper that I could go outside of the Ghetto, because I worked in the office and I\nworked in the labor department, in that section. I could see what started going on and I\nwas very, very upset with all those things, and I figured that I couldn't stay over there too\nlong, and I decided to get out and when I went to to the camp, this was\nbefore they took all the Jewish people out from our town. The fellow that took me out\nfrom there was an SS man by the name of . He said we have to go to\n, because there's a big ammunition factory and we'll have to send a lot\nof people over there to work. We have to go over and see how things are set up over\nthere. When I came over there, we went over there on a Thursday and he said Monday\nmaybe we'll come back and he said Sam there's nothing to go back anymore because all\nthe Jewish people from your town were taken away. That's how I stayed over there. All\nthe time I was in for about two years.",
        "Q: Can you tell me a little bit more about the Ghetto, what you all did? Was it closed in?",
        "A: It was closed in barbed wires. You couldn't go in, you couldn't get out unless you had a\nspecial paper from the German government. The SS used to come in every day to the\nGhetto, take people out to work, kill a lot of them while they were doing it, and we even\nhad a little hospital over there. A lot of people that got sick and had typhus, they took\nthem out and they shoot them, they killed them. Also, I remember when they came in one\nday and this was in 1942 in the beginning, and they said they need about 25 men and 25\nwomen because they had to take them away to a factory somewhere to work. They took\nthem into a public bath house. They gave them a bath and they shaved their hair and\neverything else and they send them away. We found out later that they took them away to\na concentration camp that they tried out the crematoriums on them. This was a try out.\nWe couldn't believe that those things are happening, but later on we found out that they\nwere true. There was gas put into the crematoriums. Life was very difficult in the Ghetto.\nYou couldn't do anything. There was no work. Nobody was working except when the\nGermans took you out to work somewhere on the outside, but you still used to come\nhome at night and be with your family. That was one good thing about it. You always had\nhope. You figured it's a war, maybe the war is going to finish tomorrow. Maybe things\nare going to change. We also felt that we have to stick together in order to keep each\nother alive and maybe things are going to change a little bit.",
        "Q: What about activities in the Ghetto, cultural activities, religion, your father's political --",
        "A: All cultural activities and everything stopped because the Germans were watching out\nthat you couldn't do, you couldn't do things, you know, you were lucky. You were afraid\neven to go out into the street during the day because they would catch you all the time\nand send you out to work and sometimes you didn't even know if you were going to come\nhome, so usually you were hidden all the time as much as you could. They used to come\nin every day to the Ghetto and do what they want to, and a lot of people got killed. If they\ndidn't like somebody, they just killed them 1n the middle of the street. It didn't make any\ndifference.",
        "Q: Did you see that?",
        "A: Oh, sure, absolutely. I remember the name. He was a Ukrainian, not really an SS, by the\nname of Schmitky, they used to call him. He was a very, very cruel man. He just came\nout. I remember right near our house there was a fellow, his name was Littman, Phil\nLittman was his name, and I remember he shot him right in front of our house. We were\nsitting inside. We were afraid even to go out. So those things were going on daily. It was\na daily occurrence. It wasn't new.",
        "Q: Did your father keep up any this organizing underground, the Zionism?",
        "A: I couldn't say because I don't remember and I don't think so. It's true that they got\ntogether and they talked about certain things, but very little could be done, because there\nwas no help from the outside. In the Ghetto without help from the outside, it was very\nhard to organize anything, especially in a small town like ours.",
        "Q: Did you observe shobot, holidays, anything?",
        "A: We used to observe it in the way we could. I remember my mother used to light candles\nevery Friday, but as far as the food was concerned, we didn't have the food that we had\nbefore the war. If you had a little piece of bread and some potatoes it was enough just to\nsurvive. I used to help a little bit because I worked in the Judenaut and I had maybe my\nportion a little bit more so I usually used to bring it home instead of eating so I can help\nout the family a little bit.",
        "Q: Tell me a little about the Judenaut, how you got that job?",
        "A: The way I got the job was the fellow who was running the Judenaut, was a very good\nfriend of my father's, and that's how I got the job. It wasn't easy to get a job like this,\nbecause usually when you work for the Judenaut and you're over there and all the food\nand everything came in, you always had a little bit more that you can have a little piece\nof bread more to eat, but I usually didn't eat it myself. I brought it home, because I knew\nthe rest of the family needed it more than I did, because they didn't have any other means\nto get their food from.",
        "Q: What other privileges did you get from working there?",
        "A: The privileges that I had was that I wasn't called to work every day, that I was at home,\nand I worked in the office, and I had special papers that even I could walk outside of the\nGhetto, if I had to go out for something. If you get out from the Ghetto, because you m1x\nwith the Gentile people outside, you could help yourself a little bit more.",
        "Q: Were you able to help your family by virtue of your position other than the food?",
        "A: No, not much. I had a younger brother, which I send him out to work one time, which\nthey worked at , and it was named , the firm. But\nwhat happened, the day before they took all the Jews from our town, he came home, the\nnight before. He was caught in the transport and he was taken away.",
        "Q: Was your Judenaut appointed by the local community or by the Germans?",
        "A: Mostly by the Germans. They picked one man, and then he picked everybody that he\nwanted to. Some people that he knew or were close friends of his.",
        "Q: You hear stories about Judenauts and various communities. Some of them were very\nhelpful to the community, some of them were trying to save their own lives. How do you\nkind of assess how your Judenaut operated?",
        "A: We knew it was a very difficult time. You have to understand what was going on in those\ndays. You had to do what the Germans wanted you to do. If they came in and saw the\nPresident of the Judenaut, I want 200 people tomorrow to work, you had to be the one to\nsupply those 200 people. So, you had a lot of people that didn't like you because, they\nsaid why take me? Why not take somebody else? You're put in the position that if you do\nright or you do wrong, you're not right. I'm sure that you heard that ;\nwhich was the President, committed suicide because he knew what was going on. Some\npeople were a little bit stronger and they didn't commit suicide. They did what they had\nto do and they made a lot of enemies. In my opinion they really helped a lot of people,\ntoo. But you don't remember the good things that people do, a lot of people you\nremember the bad things what a lot of people do. I couldn't say that I think most of them\ndidn't want to do what they did, but they had to do because they were forced to do,\nbecause if not, somebody else would do the thing, and they would lose their life.",
        "Q: Now, you worked in the labor department?",
        "A: Right. The labor department, for instance, the Germans came in. They said we want 200\npeople tomorrow to go to work tomorrow morning, and we had to get out the names from\nthe register that we had, which people are going to go tomorrow and which people are\ngoing the next day. I worked in the office, you know to go alphabetically, but I wasn't\nreally the one who went out and took the people out, who put them to work. I worked in\nthe office.",
        "Q: But how were those choices made, which 200?",
        "A: They usually were made according the list that we had. The way the President of the\nJudenaut decided or the people on top of them. I was young. I was 17 years old. I didn't\nmake the big decisions. They said, listen, those people we don't want to go, and those\npeople we want to go, because you know there is always somebody who 1s a little better\noff or have other people, and we were watching out that the people in the position to help\nother people they should stay in place to help them, instead of sending them out of town.",
        "Q: Can you give me any more ideas how they choose these 200 people versus another 200?",
        "A: Usually we try to take them according to alphabetical order, so we really, I don't think we\nmade choices you know this person is going to go and this person is not going to go. I\nmentioned that there were certain people who were privileged. If he had some in his\nfamily, you know, he didn't send them out to a certain job that was very hard. He picked\nthem out to go to a job that was a little easier. I imagine everybody did the same thing. If\nI could help some of my friends, I helped them. If I could help somebody else.",
        "Q: Were there women in the Judenaut?",
        "A: No, not too many that I can remember.",
        "Q: Were you aware of any sort of manipulation of the Judenaut toward other people because\nof their special power?",
        "A: I don't remember. There might have been in the higher echelon, but I wasn't in the higher\nechelon to be able to tell you.",
        "Q: The Judenaut also took care of food and everything else?",
        "A: That's right. They used to dispense the food. They used to get it, and then divide it. The\npeople used to have little carts that you used to come to collect your food, once a week or\ntwice a week. We also had soup kitchens that we set up in order to help the people that\ndidn't have a place to cook or couldn't help themselves.",
        "Q: Anything else about the Ghetto that you can think of?",
        "A: The Ghetto was very, very bad, and lot of people when they had people who hardly had\nanything, if they heard about a good job that was outside, that the Germans took you\naway, they wanted to go because the Germans never told you that they were going to take\nyou to a concentration camp or somewhere else. They said we have here, we need some\npeople to send out the job. We're going to take you and you're going to be living over\nthere and you're going to be all right. So, a lot of people even went by themselves\nbecause they figured they would be better off than being in the Ghetto because the Ghetto\nwas very bad. You didn't have enough to eat and there was a lot of starvation and\nsickness going on. We didn't know really until later on what was going on in the\nconcentration camps, because even I, myself, didn't believe until I got to Auschwitz that\nthey're really gassing and burning people until I saw it myself.",
        "Q: So, you were already in ?",
        "A: Yes, in 1942 I was in , and I worked over there in the building section.\nIt was a very, very big place. We lived right in the factory. It was like a whole city. It was\none of the largest ammunition factories in Poland. That's where I got to know my wife\nover there in 1942 because women and men were in the same camp. We lived in separate\nbarracks, but we were in the same camp. The camp was really watched by a Ukrainian.\nThe Germans were in charge, but Ukrainians were watching our camp. It was pretty\ntough over there, but we had a little bit more to eat. We worked but we mixed with other\nnationalities. The Polish people worked in the same factory. At night time we used to\ncome home and still see our friends and everybody else. We tried to help each other as\nmuch as we can. Let's say, if somebody could bring a little piece out from the outside and\nhe could share it somebody else, he usually shared it with somebody else. We found out\nafter the war that the fellow that was in charge of our camp over there, he was a German\nby the name of Brant, that thanks to him, that labor camp was a little bit better, that we\ndidn't suffer as much as in other camps. He was caught after the war in the\nand he was telling the things that he was doing for us. I know when they took us away to\nAuschwitz, he went to Auschwitz and told them that , We were very\ngood workers and we know the ammunition, that we worked in the ammunition factory,\nand they should send us to work in the factories. They did. Very few of our people,\nexcept the older ones were taken away to the crematorium. The rest of us we got numbers\nand we were sent away to work. I wasn't in Auschwitz really too long. I was over there\nmaybe three or four days. When we came to Auschwitz, by the old conductor trains, the\nwagon, the cattle trains, a lot of our people were dead, because we traveled -- I don't\nremember exactly if it took two days, or three days, or maybe four days, but we didn't\nhave any food. We didn't have any water. They didn't give us anything. We didn't have\nany facilities even in the wagons. When they opened up, a lot of people were dead, and\nbecause we were people that already came from another labor camp, we didn't have any\nluggage with us, or any valuables. They chased us out from there and we went through\nthe showers, and luckily it was showers and not gas. We came out from there and they\nnumbered us and they put us in barracks. Then, people came in from factories because\nthe Germans, this was in 1944, a lot of the Germans went up on the front lines and they\nneeded people to replace them at their factories, so they needed workers. So they came in\nfrom the factory, this is from the train factory and they said they need\nsheet metal men. I didn't have a trade, but I had a friend by the name of Coopersmith. He\npassed away, he survived and lived in California and they said Sam, when they ask for\nsheet metal men, why don't you pick up your hand and tell them you're sheet metal man.\nYou're very handy, you'll go with me. We'll see that you do something, but God's will\nthey picked him and sent him to a coal mine and they sent me into Germany to work in\nthe train factory. I came in over there, I didn't know the trade, I didn't know what to do,\nbut then I tried to take the broom and keep the shop very clean, which it was a very big\nfactory. There was about 6,000 people working over there, but our section had maybe 30\npeople working, 35, in the sheet metal section, and there were three Germans that were\nrunning it, so because I kept the place clean, so they figured everything is fine. They took\na liking to me. I learned a little bit of trade over there. By the end of 1944 I think it was in\nNovember, when the United States and the Russians started progressing more on\nGermany, and the Germans used to have their shops on the front lines 1n trains, and they\nbunked a lot of those trains, they brought a lot of our men to the train factory to be fixed.\nThe soldiers that were in those trains, came with them. They usually waited until the\ntrains were fixed, so they put on another shift. Before they put on another shift, the SS\nman came in. His name was Fox. He said, each one he assigned us a train, a pullman to\ngo out and check on those pullman. I went out to mine because I didn't know the train,\nbut I knew how to write and read and I made a plan of the train and I showed him where\nthe damage was and what we're going to fix. When he came on and asked everybody\nwhat to do, he came to me and after I showed him those, he says you're going to run the\nsecond shift. I couldn't tell the men. I took the bull by the horn. I figured listen I had to\ntake a chance because I had different nationals working under me in the second shift. We\nwent out to work, and we did the job so fast that we got a little bit tobacco extra and I\nnever smoked. Usually everything I got, I shared it with the people. They knew that I\ndidn't know the trade, but they couldn't tell the men that I don't know it either as long as I\nwas put in charge, I was put in charge over the train. That's where I learned my trade.\nWhen I came to the United States, that's the trade I went into, and I built up a shop in\nWashington DC and thank God I was very successful, and that's how I made a living in\nthe United States when I came over here.",
        "Q: I want to learn a little bit more detail about some of these camps, these labor camps. Your\ninteraction with the other people, with the guards, what your daily life was like?",
        "A: In concentration camp we didn't have any interaction with the guards. You're very, very\nscared of them. I'm going to tell you an incident which happened to me. I worked in the\nsheet metal shop, and I used to make things out of little pieces of copper that I used to\nfind, other things, some rings. I used to exchange them for little pieces of bread. I was\ncalled one day, and this was about the end of November 1944, and the men took my\nnumber and usually every Sunday the persecutions were going on, because we didn't\nwork. Anybody did something that they didn't like, they used to hang them and then send\nthem away to the crematoriums.",
        "Q: This 1s which camp?",
        "A: Auschwitz. And I already knew what was going to happen. I figured my gosh how can I\nget out of it. I knew what was going to happen to me on Sunday because I was caught\nwith materials that , which means they are materials they use during\nthe war for war materials, because I used copper. So, I made the decision that when the\nmain commandment came out, we had appeals every morning that we stayed out. I had to\ncome because the Germans were very how do you say it -- they counted us almost all the\ntime. I went out and I went down to the main man behind him and I told him that I was\nmaking something for him for Christmas and it was taken away from me in the shop. I\nsaid I don't mind that they took it away from me, but I said I worked for it for almost two\nweeks in order to have it for you as a present and I would like you to have it. It went\naway, I never heard any thing more about it. They never called me. The commander got\nto know me very well because we went out through the gate a lot of times. He used to\nknock me on the shoulders when we went out. That's how I survived from going to the\ncrematoriums one time. We had to think sometimes. When the Ghetto was liquidated, my\nwhole family went to Treblinka, and they all perished in the crematorium in Treblinka.\nThat's what I found out at , a couple weeks later after I was there.\nSo, I was the only one from the whole family left, from the immediate family, but I had\nsome friends that they brought in from my town to , too, and they worked\nover there. So, we used to meet every day. I think in there must have been\nabout 2,000 or a little bit over 2,000 people over there working. Things were tough. We\ndidn't have enough to eat. There was sicknesses. I had two friends by the name, one of\nthem, that he was sick one of them was and the other one was\n, and they took them all out one day and they shot them all. They\nliquidated the whole hospital in . They took everything out. So, you can\nimagine how we felt. Things were very bad. I had to get in to tell other monstrosities that\nwere going on over there, but that's what they did. They took them all out and shot them\nat one day. Plus the other things that were going on. We got beatings every day, coming\nin or going out. The food was very bad. We used to get a little piece of bread in the\nmorning and we used to get little bit of soup at night. But, like I told you, we tried to help\neach other in order to keep our things a little bit up. When we came to Auschwitz, it was\naltogether different. It was hard to believe what was going on over there. We could see\nthe chimneys. We could smell the smoke. We knew the people that were taken over there.\nWe were ones of the lucky ones. The minute we got out of the wagons and they started\nchasing us and they gave us the numbers on our arms, and they shaved us all together and\nthen they put us through a solution that we walked through. We didn't even know. We\nwere just like animals. You were chased and you didn't know what was going on to you\nat that time. Then they put us in line and they came out and the doctors mingle and the\nother ones were in white coats, and they look through and one of them goes to this side,\nand one of them goes to this side, and one to this side, and one to the other side. Now, I\nwas lucky that it was Birkenau, not really Auschwitz. This was part -- they called it\nAuschwitz II. Then them came to make the selections. When they made the selections\nand I was sent away in those first three days, that I was in Auschwitz three or four days. I\ndon't even remember. It's very hard for me to remember. We didn't do any work. We\nwere sitting outside. It was cold, it was wet and they wouldn't even let us get into\nbarracks until they came at night. Then we used to sleep with 15 people on one\n, with a little bit of snow. I was glad to get out from there. When they\nbrought us into , which was part of Auschwitz, it was the factory that we\nwent to, over there, because we worked with different nationalities and we worked in the\nfactory with a lot of Germans, everybody had a different . We had a\nstraw sack with a little blanket. That's all we had. We slept with about 200 people in one\nroom. But they kept us a little bit cleaner. We had the laundry and the clothes that we\nwere wearing the striped clothes. We had to change because in the factory it was grease\nworking around trains. We had to change. We used to come home, and used to change\nthe clothes and they gave us other clothes. But, we had selections every Sunday. They\nlooked us through, and if somebody didn't look so good, they took them out and they\nsend them away to the crematoriums. They brought in other people to replace them. The\nfood we got in the morning, you had to get up about 4:00 in the morning and we stayed\noutside. They called it Appeal, that they counted us, every morning, and if somebody was\nmissing, we had to stay outside, cold or rain didn't make any difference until the men\nwere found. Because sometimes somebody died during the night and never even came\nout, or something happened, but we had to wait. And if they didn't count us, we didn't\ncouldn't go to work until everything was counted. Then we had about five miles, maybe\nfour miles that we would have to walk from the camp to the factory. The music was\nplaying near the gate where we went out, and the music was playing at night when we\ncame home. We got a little piece of bread, about six of us got one pound of bread. The\nbread was made out, you could feel the straw inside that you could hardly eat it, but we\nhad to eat it because you had to survive on something. We got a little bit, 1t was like tea.\nThey said it was a special tea that was made that we drank a little bit. Then in the middle\nof the day you got a little bit of soup which was mostly water. Then at night, when we\ncame home, either we got another little piece of soup or we got another little piece of\nbread. This was our food for a whole day. Things were very, very bad, because a lot of\npeople, we didn't have enough food, they used to get diarrhea and they used to get sick.\nThe minute you got sick a little bit, you were taken out, and we alot of times when we\nwent out to work and maybe 2,000 people, and the men says I only want 1,800 back and\nby the time we got back, we had trucks behind us that they killed off the rest of them. We\njust loaded on the truck the ones that couldn't keep up with --you know, because we\nwalked from the factory to the thing. The ones that couldn't keep up with it, they killed\nthem on the road, and they put them on the trucks and then they took them away to the\ncrematoriums. But we couldn't help ourselves. We couldn't even escape because on the\noutside there was nobody to help us. I had a friend that escaped from the trains when they\ntook us on the trains and got into the woods, and when he came back, he was taken to\nTreblinka at that time. His name was . I'll never forget. He came back, he\nsaid listen don't go on those trains because they burn you over there and we thought that\nthe man was crazy. We didn't believe him. We said how can they tell living people and\nburn them especially you know in our days? And another thing that we couldn't\nunderstand it's as 1f the world would know that those things would go on, we are taught\nthat somebody outside must know because if they would know what was going on in\nhere, they couldn't sit outside and not do anything about it. But, we never got any help\nfrom the outside. When he was on the outside and was in the woods, he said he couldn't\nstay over there because they wanted to kill him because , SO he\ntried to get back and came back to our camp in . This was in\nbefore they took us on the trains. That man didn't live through. They\ntook us on the trains to go to Auschwitz, because he was already on those trains going to\nTreblinka one time, from , from our town. He jumped the train from\nAuschwitz, and he was shot before he got -- no, before we got on the train, he ran away,\nand he was shot. But, when we came to Auschwitz, we realized what the man told us was\ntrue, but we couldn't help ourselves. Auschwitz, we had a lot of hope. We could see that\nthis thing couldn't last on forever. But, it was very easy to commit suicide. All you had to\ndo was through yourself on the wires, because the wires were electric. They had 600\nvolts in them. And a lot of people did it. But, if we found out that somebody was very\ndespondent and we felt that he was going to do something, we tried to talk to him and tell\nhim listen, the outside world cannot sit like t his and watch what's going on here and not\ndo anything. It looks like the war is already coming to an end. We knew little things what\nwere going on because we didn't have any radios. We didn't have any papers, and nobody\nwas telling us anything because even the Germans that worked with us in the factory\nwere afraid to talk to us, because if they noticed that they talk to us too much, they took\nhim away. They took them away, too. So, we tried to help each other as much as we\ncould in order to survive. And thank God some of us survived. When they took us out on\nthe Death March --.",
        "Q: Wait a minute, we haven't talked about the Death March yet so we need to set that up.",
        "A: All right. One day, when we were , they came in and they said that they\nhave to take us all out. They didn't take us where we were going. We found out later that\nthis was the death march. We were only about 60 kilometers away from Auschwitz and\nall the people that were going met the same way. So, they took us out one morning. It\nwas snowing in January, January the 22nd. It was snowing and it was very cold outside\nbecause over there the temperature goes about 30 degrees below zero. We didn't have any\nclothes. We didn't have anything with us, and we marched because they didn't have any\ntrains to put us on, and anybody that couldn't keep up with the marchers were shot on the\nway. One night it was in January, I think it was the 25th of January, they brought us to a\ncamp in , which was a big factory. They brought us in all over there\nbecause the SS that were going with us, they had to rest a little bit too. So, we stayed over\nand in the middle of the night they started shelling the factory. They woke us up about\n12:00, 1:00 in the morning. There might have been about 60,000 of us over there because\nthey brought them from all over. They chased us out and I had a dream that night when I\nwas sleeping, my mother came to me and said Sam, don't leave this place and I had an\nargument with her. I told her listen, how can I not leave. You know we're almost\nliberated. You see what's going on, but when they started chasing us, I forgot the dream.\nWhen I was near the gate to go out, I had two friends with me, one was from my town,\nWeinberg was his name, and the other one was from . When we came to\nthe gate, my dream came back to me and I figured, no I'm not going to go. I'm not going.\nSo, the other one from my town, he didn't want to go with me. He said, Sam we're almost\nliberated I'm going out. I'm going where they chasing us to go. I said no, but the other\none, I took care of him. He was a little bit younger and I took care of him a lot in camp\nwhen I was there. So, I smacked him in his face and I took him with me and I ran back\ninto the camp to the other side and there was a big hole. It was a brick wall over there\nabout three foot thick, and there was a big hole in it that was made from one of the shells\nor something. I crawled out and there was a ravine and I rolled down into the snow with\nthem and we ran into the woods and we stayed over there for about eight days until the\nRussians came in. The Russians liberated us. If you asked me how I survived in those\nwoods for eight days in that cold weather and everything else, I can hardly remember. I\nknow we had frozen toes and at night time we used to go out from the woods. In Europe\nthey used to have to put away potatoes in the winter time outside and they used to cover\nthem with sawdust and then have a door on the southside that they used to take the\npotatoes out. The sun used to come out during the day, so we stole some of those potatoes\nand we ate those raw potatoes and we had snow as water. That's how we lived through\nuntil we survived from those eight days. If you ask me to tell you anything about those\nthings, I couldn't. But there were some other people in the woods too, when I was over\nthere. I met a friend of mine, from my town, that escaped too, at the same time, by the\nname of David Bay, and he lives now in Washington, D.C., and we're still very close. We\nused to crawl one into the other one in order to keep us warm during the night until we\ngot up the next morning. Then we used to run a little bit, you know, in order just to\nsurvive. Then from that time after, I walked home. It took me almost about two weeks to\nget home because there was no transportation. We could catch any transportation we\ncould, and when I came home, -- so I was one of the ones who was liberated early. Even\nwhen I came back to my town--the reason I went back was because I thought maybe\nsomebody from my family was alive still. I couldn't believe that everybody was gone that\nwas there. There was no work, and no way to make a living, and I told you before that\none of my father's friend's daughter was alive. She was on the Gentile side. She was not\nin a concentration camp. She was home already. I even got together with her I told her I\nsaid Tasha, we are only about seven Jewish people in the whole town that came back in\nthose days when I was over there. Some of them even came from the Russian side\nalready or there were Gentile papers. I said we have to do something 1n order to make a\nliving. I said I'm going to put that flour mill back in operation. I did. I got the Gentile\nfellow, the machine shop, and we put it back in operation. We started -- the farmers used\nto bring in their corn, and we used to keep 50 percent for the making the flour and they\nused to keep the other 50 percent. That's how me made a living in those days. We have a\nlittle house over there. We remodeled a little bit and we moved in. I didn't know that\nRegina was alive still --.",
        "Q: We need to stop here a moment. First of all, I want you to tell me what it was like when\nyou went back to your home town after you were liberated. I mean you didn't go there\nand five minutes later you were a business man. What did you do? What did you find?",
        "A: When I came back to town, the first thing, we left a lot of things with a lot of people, with\nour neighbors. I couldn't get anything back, and I was afraid to get back because I figure\nwhen asking to give back they might do something to me. So, all the Jewish people that\ncame back, we moved into one of our houses that my uncle used to have. And we stayed\nover there all together, and one of my cousin's survived too. She lives now in Belgium.\nSo, we all lived over there for quite a while, maybe for a couple, two or three months, but\nwe had to go and get something to eat, because nobody gave us. We used to go to the\ngovernment, but they themselves didn't have too much, but at least we had a little piece\nof bread to eat because we didn't need the things like you know like we live over here\nnow. If we had a piece of bread and a couple potatoes, this was enough for us to eat. But\nwe Started to build up ourselves a little bit. But, I got sick. I had to go to the hospital. I\nhad the infection. I was in the hospital for a little while, but when I came out and I got\ntogether with my father's friend's daughter, we decided that we had to do something. I\ndidn't want to put it up as a business. I wanted to put it up so that we can make a living\nand the farmers needed us too. The farmers were after us to put the flour mill back in\noperation because that was the only flour mill around, maybe 50 miles around our\ncommunity. The only one.",
        "Q: How did your Polish neighbors treat you? Did they welcome you back?",
        "A: Not really. I hate to say it, but even with the friends that I went to school and everything\nelse, I lived over there. I was born over there. My family lived over there for generations.\nI don't know how many generations, but the first question when they saw me \"You're still\nalive?\" But, things are different now. I always tell them that I wish you would ask me if I\nlived in Holland, not in Poland. From the whole town, from the 4,500 that we lived in, I\nthink maybe close to a 100 are alive and not all went to concentration camps. A lot of\nthem ran away to Russia and they came back from Russia after the war. We still get\ntogether even during the summer, we have sometimes a gathering from our town that we\nget together, all of them together, to see how everything goes.",
        "Q: So, they weren't very kind to you when you got back?",
        "A: No, not too kind. And we had --I had to escape from there, because they started pogroms\nagain. The pogroms started in and the day Regina came back she went to\nher town, and she went up to her apartment and knocked at the door to find out if some of\nher family may have come back. There was a fellow behind that said Regina run away\nbecause they just killed . was a fellow that came\nback too from concentration camp, and they just killed him. So, she went down from that\napartment and she didn't have time to get into her apartment house, then she came back to\nmy town.",
        "Q: Now, we haven't even discussed Regina, so people watching the tape won't know who\nRegina is. You need to back track a little bit.",
        "A: In the beginning, I think I said that I met Regina in in 1942, and\nthen when they took us on the train to Auschwitz before they took us off the trains we\ncould see what was going on. We made up that if we live through we're going to meet in\n, my little town, and get together over there. She was liberated in May, and\nwhen she came back to our town, was sometime June, but it's miraculous that she was\nliberated on the third day, she already knew that I was alive, because things were going\non, the communication. She knew, she met some people that says I already heard that\nSam is alive and I was glad to hear too, and I was waiting for her to come back because I\nwas the only one left from the whole family. She was the only one left from the hole\nfamily.",
        "Q: I was wondering when you were talking about your fiance coming to your town, did you\nthink you'd see her again?",
        "A: I was hoping that I would because I knew I lost everybody else, but I was very happy to\nhear that she was still alive because I found out. News traveled, and maybe I should get\nback for someplace for her to come to, but we couldn't get married. What happens in the\nJewish religion to get married you need ten people to have a witness to have a\n. There weren't ten Jews even there to get married, but we got together the\nones that were over there and we told them, that because she doesn't have a place where\nto live and I don't, we're going to move in together and we're going to get married the\nminute we can get married.",
        "Q: So, describe to me when she came, when you saw her?",
        "A: Oh, it's very I was one of the happiest people because I figured she was the closest one to\nme, because I was with her for almost two years in together, and in\nshe lived in a different barrack, and I lived in a different barrack and one\ntime I went over to visit her and one Ukrainian took me out from a room and I got 25\nlashes and I'll never forget it, but it was worth it to see her.",
        "Q: You went to her barrack?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: You went inside?",
        "A: Oh, sure. You could go in. We didn't live together in the same barracks, but we lived in\nthe same camp and the same camp you could go and visit them. But if the Ukrainian, if\nhe wasn't a very nice fellow, he took you out and most of them were not nice and they\njust gave me a beating one of those times. He said it's too late, you should already be in\nyour barrack not over here. Because I didn't have time to go when I got home from work\nanyhow. So, we knew in Poland that we couldn't stay over there no more. We'll have to\nleave this country. There's no place for Jews to live any more after what happened over\nthere. So, one day, when I found out what was going on and I had a threat that they're\ntrying to kill me so I went to the mayor of the town and I found out that he was one of the\nteachers that I used to go to school in my last years. His name was Peshko. He was in the\nunderground. He was in the underground during the war. I went over to him and I told\nhim Mr. Peshko, I have to leave. I lived through Hitler and I don't need this and I have to\nget a paper from you to get on the train because Russia was at that time in Poland and\nyou couldn't just go on a train any time you wanted to. So, he said, Sam I'm going to give\nyou a paper because we're trying to have a out on and\nmaybe you can get over there. But when I got the paper I was afraid to take the train in\nmy town because people knew me. So, Regina and I packed, just two sets of underwear\nin a little suitcase and I went out of town to another town to and took the\ntrain from over there. At that night we ended up on the Czechoslovakian border. They\nwent through and they checked your passports on the Polish side. We went out from the\ntrain. We crawled under the train on both sides. Went out to the Czechoslovakian train\nand so when the Asians went out from their trains we went upstairs and wind up in\nCzechoslovakia. When we came to Czechoslovakia we came to I think and\nthen we went to Prague. We got off the -- we took a street car to get into the town from\nthe train and Regina thought that I had the little suitcase and I thought she had the little\nsuitcase and we left it on the streetcar. So, we came to town to the main it was a station\nover there, a street car station, and I asked Regina do you have the suitcase? No, do you\nhave it? No. So, I asked the fellow, we spoke a little bit Czechoslovakian because it's the\nsame language a little bit similar to Polish, he said you wait here. It takes about three\nquarters of an hour for the street car to come back and I'm sure the little suitcase is going\nto be on it. We waited over there for three quarters and we had a little suitcase and we got\nit back, so we're lucky to get the two sets of underwear because we didn't have anything\nelse. But then they had the Jewish community over there already. We stayed over there,\nwe stayed in Czechoslovakia for maybe a month, and then I decided we can't stay here\neither and I went back with Regina to the American zone in Germany and I came to the\nD.P. camp in which was established at this time. We were one of almost\nthe first ones over there and I worked in that office too. I worked for the United Nations\nRelief Organization. I worked for the Joint Distribution Committee. And the Joint\nDistribution made our wedding over there. We got married over there. The wedding was\nin Munich, took us to Munich. Then Regina got sick. Something was wrong and they\ntook her to the hospital and they gave her some medicine which didn't agree with her and\nshe developed some kind of a blood -- something was wrong with her blood and a fellow\ncame in from the C.I.A, and American, by the name of Doctor Aaron Mayer, asked what\ncan I do for you. She said I don't need anything, the only thing she says I know I have an\nuncle in the United States that lived in New York, but I don't know where he lives but I\nknow his name was . So, what he did, Doctor Aaron Mayer, he put an ad\nin the Jewish papers but the uncle didn't read the Jewish newspapers. He read the New\nYork Times. A lady from Washington D.C. by the name o Mrs. Freedman, used to work\nwith her mother. Her mother used to have a dress shop in Poland, and she read the\nand she knew him from home and she called him up in New York and told\nhim that the niece of his is alive and was looking for him. The first thing we got from him\nwas papers to come to the United States and they were signed by J. Edgar Hoover,\nbecause J. Edgar Hoover was a friend of her uncle's. But we still couldn't come to the\nUnited States. It took us almost a year because in those days it was quarters and you just\ncouldn't leave. So, we waited over there but her uncle also at that time send us some\nmoney but we never got it because he said it's not allowed for you to have any American\nmoney in those days, so they sent it back to the uncle. We found this out after the war. I\nwas very friendly with that Doctor Aaron Mayer and the C.I.A. and we used to come\ntogether and meet each other while we were in Germany.\nEnd of Tape #1\nTape #2",
        "A: We got those papers from her uncle, and it took us almost a year before we could come\nover here, even with the papers being in order and everything else, but we moved from\nto because we found out one of the brothers was alive and he\nwas in the American Army. He escaped during the war. He went to England, then he got\non a ship and came to the United States and jumped ship. Then he joined the American\nArmy and became a citizen and that's how he came back to Europe. Then when we found\nout he was in Regina says we might as well move to SO we\ncan be closer to her brother. We stayed over there until we came over to the United\nStates. Let me tell you something about . When we came to\n, we were one of the first ones to come to the D.P. camp. There were\na lot of other nationalities over there, but they all had a home to go back to. They had\nrelatives, but the Jews didn't have any place to go back especially in Poland. There homes\nwere destroyed. No family left, and there was no place for them to go back and live. Even\nat the border, the ones that came back and started, they found out there's\nno place for them to live. They had to come back. They have to go back and it was a\nlucky thing that we have to thank President Eisenhower for opening up the borders and\nletting the Jews from Poland come back in to West Germany. Also, a lot of the people\nthat were in Russia somewhere else that they escaped didn't have any place to go and\nthey came to the D.P. camps in Germany. We stayed over there. In the beginning the\nplace was almost like a Ghetto too. We were closed in the camps. They had soldiers\noutside watching us. We couldn't go out. We didn't have freedom to move. So, finally,\nPresident Eisenhower gave an order to take the guards off that we can go free around and\nmove to the towns that we want to so we could walk a little bit more out and everybody\nstarted to find out. Most of us wanted to go to Palestine in those days, but Palestine was\nnot a state and they couldn't take us. So, they had the ax of the ship that they got, they\ntook some of them in, but the rest of them we had to stay over there, especially if you\nwere married and you already have somebody those were the worst ones that they wanted\nto take out in those days. They took out only the small children that were left. They\nfigured that's the most important to get them out from Europe. The food in the camps was\nnot too bad, but they gave us rations but you know they said we'll give you 1,300 calories\nbut it depends what kind of food they give us, the calories. It wasn't food that the people\nwere used to it. So, President Eisenhower changed those things too. Then we started\nhelping ourselves a little bit, and started working a little bit and people started to find out\nwhere there families are so they can leave because none of us wanted to stay in the D.P.\ncamps, but we didn't have a place where to go. The United States wouldn't let us in in\nthose days. Canada wouldn't let us in. Australia wouldn't let us in. Go back to Poland, the\nPolish Jewish couldn't go back to Poland any more. I was over there already back one\ntime and I had to escape. So, we had problems for quite a while. It's hard to understand\nwhat was going on over there. With all those things, unless you're over there yourself you\nwitness it, because it's impossible to tell what was going on in the concentration camps or\neven the slave labor camps or even the D.P. camps. We still didn't have enough freedom\nin the D.P. camps until the end because we were still controlled by the Americans what\nwe can do and what we cannot do. President Eisenhower was a big help, and he really did\na lot for the D.P. camps, quite a lot.",
        "Q: Was it your sense that was well organized and well run and that\npeople's needs were basically taken care of?",
        "A: Not in the beginning when I got in over the first time, but later on it improved, because I\nworked in the office. I worked for the and I was taking care of the\nregistration. People that came in over there and then the was getting\nsome food out already for the people and they found out exactly what they need and what\nthey want. We had a kitchen. At least we had enough to fill our stomachs. We didn't have\nto wait until -- you still had to have cards to go and get your food, like coupons. But we\nalready had enough. They set up a school. If there were any children that came in, they\ncould go to school, and we organized our own theaters and clubs so we can come\ntogether and we can talk about. If a family was left, they found out if you were in one\ncamp, they could transfer from one camp to another camp so they can be with the family\ntogether. It was a big improvement. We were free at least. We knew what was freedom.\nI'm going to tell you about the food incident so you'll know what the difference was when\nwe finally got our papers to go to and come to the United States. When\nwe came on the ship, the first thing we asked the fellows, the Americans, says when we\nget our coupons to get food, because we always used all those years to get coupons to get\nfood. He says, don't worry, you're going to get enough to eat, but we couldn't believe it. I\nremember the first dinner we had when the ship went out. We were all sitting around the\ntables, and we saw all the bread and all the stuff on the table, everybody filled their\npackets up because we couldn't believe that there's so much, that there's food enough, that\nyou can eat as much as your heart desires. We had even a couple, an elder couple that\npassed away on the ship because they ate too much of the food that they shouldn't have\neaten. Even I remember myself after the first meal I couldn't eat for maybe three days. I\ngot sick, because we couldn't understand that there's so much food and here we were\ngoing around hungry. Even the D.P. camps, we had enough food but we didn't have the\nfood just satisfy yourself what you wanted to eat. You eat what they give you. They gave\nyou some soup. You had to go to the kitchen. You didn't cook yourself. You didn't have\nany facilities to cook. But things were much better in the D.P. camps than in the camps --\nI'm not talking about Auschwitz. Auschwitz was just unbelievable. It's hard to describe. I\nremember when I lived through and I came home and I told some people what I went\nthrough. At first I couldn't talk about it. It took a long time until I could tell anybody\nwhat I went through, but the people couldn't believe this. They couldn't believe that\nsomething like this happened, which I and Regina were just invited to the British\nEmbassy to watch a film and also to the Canadian Embassy to watch a film about the\nsurvivors, the American and the Canadian, that were shot down over Germany. A lot of\nthem instead of putting them in P.O.W. camps, they put them in Buchenwald and other\ncamps. There were a couple of survivors, one American, one Canadian and one British\nand I talked to them and they told me they came home and they told their parents what\nthey went through in Buchenwald and their parents told them you're just telling stories.\nThat 1s impossible. This could not happen. Finally now, they tape them in order to have\ntheir stories what they went through and lot of them are already very old. One of them\ntold me that Walsh was his name he said his father couldn't even come because he had a\nstroke. He wanted to come to the gathering that they had about the film, but he couldn't\ncome to it any more. So, his son was over there representing him. Those other things that\nhappened, not only the Jews, even the other nationals, the Gentile people that were over\nthere, the Americans and the English, even when they told their stories nobody would\nbelieve them when they told them what was going on in those camps.",
        "Q: In the beginning when you were in and people from a lot of other countries,\ndid you mix with them or did the Jews kind of stick with themselves?",
        "A: A lot of Ukrainians over there and we didn't feel very comfortable with them because\nthey were in charge with our camps, of our labor camps and they all had to leave in order\nfor us to get over there. We couldn't stay with them together. Because people don't realize\nbut they were our enemies not our friends. They used to say they were in camps in\nGermany, but we know what kind of camps they went into.",
        "Q: So, how did all of that work out?",
        "A: It worked that they had to ship them somewhere else. They had a home to go back to but\nthey didn't want to go home. They were afraid to go home because they were\ncollaborators with the Germans.",
        "Q: But initially at , they put you all together?",
        "A: That's right.",
        "Q: What else can you tell me about . Did people work there? Did you\nlive in barracks? Did you live in apartments?",
        "A: In we had little houses like semi detached homes and usually you lived so\nmany people in a home. In one house, for instance we had a little house and most of our\nrelatives from out of town that came to our town lived with us in the same house, but we\nalready had for instance we had separate rooms. Two people slept in a room, or three\npeople slept in a room, because when we were in the Ghetto, we were a family of I had\nthree sisters, a brother, myself and my parents, we all had only one room, and the room\nwasn't too big. I don't know if the room was ten feet by fifteen feet. We all slept in one\nroom. Some people had it even worse. It was more crowded even. We already, we\nfigured we're lucky. The whole family stays together in one room. Some of them they put\ndifferent families together because it was very crowded. They didn't have any place for\nthem. The Germans didn't care. They brought them in, you find a place for them where to\ngo.",
        "Q: Did people work at the D.P camps? I know you did.",
        "A: Yes, a lot of them worked too. They worked for the Joint Distribution\nCommittee but as far as other jobs like working in trades or something, but the\ncame in and the put up some schools to teach the people\ntrades. That was a very, very big help because a lot of them don't like -- fix typewriters\nand other stuff and they came over here to the United States and somewhere else and\nthat's the business that they went into. That's what they started doing here.",
        "Q: What about religion? Did that start coming back to people? To you?",
        "A: To me it took a long time to come back, but to a lot of people that were very religious and\nthey had religion going on. They didn't have those big temples like they have here, but\nthey had little rooms that they got together, but they celebrated either Passover or Rosh\nHoshana, Yom Kippur. We celebrated those holidays. There were some that didn't want\nto celebrate and you had some that were very religious and some were not so religious.",
        "Q: What about you and religion?",
        "A: Myself? When I came back to Poland and I saw what was left from the whole family, for\na while I thought why be Jewish. If God could have been around to watch over us the\nthings that were going on and not say anything, maybe there's nobody around here.\nFinally you know I'll get away from it. I don't look so Jewish. I was born here. I'll get\naway from it. There's not too many Jews, but after the pogroms started again, I figured I\ncannot do those things, because if I'm going to marry somebody and my kids are grown\nup, they might do the same thing what the people are doing right now here. My religion\nis still better. I don't have to be very, very religious but it's still better than any other\nreligion that sided against it.",
        "Q: What do you think sustained you through all of these years? Why do you think you got\nthrough it?",
        "A: Not that I was smarter than anybody else. A lot had to do with luck where you were, and\nwhat you were doing at a certain time. A lot of times, even now, I think why me why\nnobody else from my family except me. I can't answer that question. What kept us\ntogether was because we were young, very, very young. The older people that had more\nexperiences and more knowledge about life, a lot of them committed suicide or they\ncouldn't put up with it. But we young ones, we kept each other going. Life was just\nstarting for us, and we figured that this has to come to an end. We knew that a war does\nnot go on forever. And we also promised each other that somebody has to stay alive to\ntell what was going on in that hell, what was really going on 1n those camps and every\nwhere else. Who else is going to tell them, because now the youngest one already is my\nage and in another short time, there's very few of us going to be left, especially witnesses\nthat were over there. It's going to be history and history doesn't change around. They\nalready deny it. You have a lot of revisionists that say that the Holocaust did not happen.\nSo, we feel, because we never talked about those things, but we feel that now that we\nhave to talk about them in order to make people and especially the kids that those are the\nthings that really happened. For instance last year I and Regina went with a group of kids,\nJewish kids from all over the world. We went on the March of . We went\nto Poland. We took them to the concentration camps. Then we went to Israel. It's amazing\nwhat that did to the kids. At least they know they talked to some of them that were really\nthere and showed them the places and what was going on in those concentration camps.\nBecause just talking to somebody about it, it doesn't bring out as much as you can really\ngo to the place and witness and see what has been going on over there. A lot of those\nkids, that knew very little about Judaism have changed quite a lot.",
        "Q: Over the last 50 years, I'm sure there are certain images that come back to you a lot. Can\nyou talk about any of them?",
        "A: Those images come back to me all the time. There's plenty of nights that I talk to people\nabout them. I usually don't talk about those things during the day, and I told I have to be\nbusy in order to forget those things, but I wake up in the middle of the night still seeing\nall those monstrosities and everything else. I can't talk about them a lot of times, but I can\nsee them and I feel them. I wake up 1n a sweat and it's very hard for me to get back to\nsleep. If we get together with our friends that went through, that's all we talk about. We\ncan't talk about anything else. Thank God we have three children. We have seven\ngrandchildren and I ask my kids, I said when you were younger when they were very\nlittle and they saw my number when they were two years, two and half, they asked me\nwhat is that number I used to tell them some bad people did it to me. But later on they\nnever asked us any questions because they realized they heard us talk to our friends all\nthe time, and they knew that something very bad happened to us during that time. Even\nnow, they tell us that's why we didn't want to ask you about it. We knew what you went\nthrough but we didn't want to ask you about it. Even now, after 50 years, it's very, very\nhard to talk about it. But then we figured we have to establish a new life when we came\nover here. We worked very hard. I worked seven days a week, 20 hours, as many hours\nas it took in order to build up what I did, and thank God it's a wonderful country. I\nwouldn't like to live anywhere else, and I appreciate everything that the United States did\nfor me. And I'm paying taxes every year too, and I don't mind. They've been very good to\nme here and since I came to the United States, I've worked mostly for the government. I\ndid a lot of work -- I have clearance with the F.B.I., with the C.I.A., and I never forget\nwhen I came over to this country and I worked at and I worked at the\nand in the middle of the day, one of the soldiers came over and took me\nup to and I got very scared. I thought I was in Germany again. They were\ngoing to send me away somewhere else, and I found out the reason I was taken off of the\njob was because I didn't have my citizenship papers. I was not a citizen and it was a job\nin those days was very secret and that I can't work over there\nbecause I wasn't a citizen, but the minute I got my citizen papers, I established back my\ncredentials and I did not have a problem. Work mostly on the ladder. I even did the\nin the White House when Nixon was making the tapes. We worked\naround the clock for 24 hours in order to get the air conditioning and ventilation in the\nbasement. I'm thankful for everything. I have a very nice family and I hope that we stay\nwell that I can do more what I want to do to help other people which is very, very\nimportant.",
        "Q: Is there anything else you want to add about those years?",
        "A: I don't want to go through the monstrosities to tell you what's going on too much. I get\nvery, you know, I'm but if you have any special questions you want to ask me that you\nwant me to say about I'll be glad to answer.",
        "Q: You have to appreciate that someone, sometime might look at this tape and say\nmonstrosities, maybe they're going to want to know more what that means?",
        "A: The only thing I can say that not all people are bad. They are some good people with the\nbad ones too. Even there were in concentration camps, and I worked with a German that\nwas running the factory. It's true that he lost three sons in the war and he didn't like Hitler\ntoo much either, but he always every day, he knew what was going on, brought\nsomething in, like an apple sometime, a little piece of bread, but he told me don't take it\nuntil I go out from here, because if they catch me I'll be in trouble, and he put it away at a\ncertain place and then I left, before I left I used to go out and get it and I used to come\nhome, you know, back to the barracks, I used to share it with my friends. The fellow\nwhen were in the fellow that was in charge of our barrack was a German\nby the name of Walter, and I found out that he killed his parents and they put him in jail\nand then they put him in charge of us. I also found out later that it was a homosexual\nwhich I didn't even know what a homosexual really was when I was in camp in those\ndays, but he also had a girlfriend in the factory and he spoke German and she spoke only\nPolish and when he found out he took me to carry the letters from the factory back to\ncamp from him to her because he couldn't go out from camp. We went to work, but he\nstayed over the whole day and took care of it, so usually when I came home at night he\nhad this special soup for me which I shared with my friends and this means almost\ndifference between life and death, this soup. And also, in the winter time it was very cold\nover there, but because we worked in the train factory an the trains were running on coal,\nSO we made up that each man that came back took a little piece of coal and put it in his\npocket, very little piece, maybe a centimeter and half by centimeter and half, and when\nwe came back to the barracks, we had a little bellie stove, a little iron stove and the\nfellow that was running, that Walter, the German that was running the camp didn't mind\nand everybody threw the little piece of coal in that little stove and we had it a little bit\nwarmer at night. We were one of the lucky ones maybe. You had to help yourself a little.\nYou couldn't take too much of that coal back, but a little piece, nobody noticed when you\nwent through the gate and coming in with it and that's how we kept warm at night in the\ncamp. I imagine that we're also lucky that they took us instead of\nbeing in Auschwitz, because in Auschwitz you couldn't survive. The people that maybe\nsurvived there because usually they came in they picked them to do certain jobs, to take\nthe clothes away when we came off they took the clothes away from the people then they\nsorted the clothes, then they took the people, you know. If you were picked to do a job\nyou couldn't help it. You took the people from the gas chambers and put them 1n the\ncrematoriums and it was people like us. You know, they picked them out and that's what\nyou did. So, they use you as long as you could do it and if you got tired of doing it, they\nput you in the crematorium and picked somebody else to do it. So, it wasn't something\nlike just -- in the camp that I was in they used to hang people every\nSunday and everybody that did something bad, they used to hang them on Sunday. They\nused to pick up people from the rolls after they stayed on that appeal in the morning and\nwe used to hang them. They didn't do it themselves. Used to go out and put the thing on\ntheir neck, but you couldn't help it. Luckily I wasn't picked, but maybe if I would be\npicked I would have to do the same thing. It was one of those things. Another thing in\nthose camps, in Auschwitz Sunday when we didn't go to work even if it was cold, we had\nto stay outside the hole day. They wouldn't let us go into the barracks and sit inside\nbecause we were going to make it dirty. The floors are going to be dirty. We had to make\nour bed as much as we could every morning and then you were sick you were afraid to go\nto the infirmary because you knew what was going to happen to you. I'll never forget I\ncut myself once in my arm here, right here, and I was afraid to go, and I don't know what\nI did but I put a piece of rope on one side and on the other side and it just healed up and I\nused to go to work, and I used to be sick. I used to get a sore throat and a fever. I used to\ngo to work. I never stayed in the barracks. I figured if I stay I know what's going to\nhappen to me, so this way I just went through and when we went home, walking, we used\nto hold tight, used to hold each other in to the ends and my friends if I couldn't go my\nfriends were dragging me in until we got in there. I used to take my friends until we got\nback to camp, and that's how I survived. We helped each other. If not we wouldn't be\nhere. Even when I escaped, I'll never forget I can't even remember they said I was in the\nwoods it was so bad, but we survived somehow. It's amazing what a human being can\nstand when it happens. There was no place for us to escape because there was no body\nthat helped a Jew on the outside. Maybe in another country. Maybe in Holland or\nBelgium or France but not in Poland because most of the crematoriums were built in\nPoland. Even from the countries, they brought them into Poland, like Birkenau,\nAuschwitz, Maidonek. Maidonek, is a camp that still the Germans didn't have time to\ndestroy it and it's still, they can start up a ration over there in two days if they had to. The\ncrematoriums and everything is over there. That's why I took the march of the living kids\nwho went to Maidonek. It's not only the Jews that got killed during the war. A lot of the\nRussian prisoners. When I was in there was a camp of Russian\nprisoners that they brought in. There was an American prison camp too. They put them\non the outside with a fence around it, didn't feed them. They used to eat the grass from\nthe ground. They never put them to work, and they all died out, then they took them to\nthe crematoriums. So with us with the Jews, he just wanted to get rid of\nall the Jews. You know in a war that you're going to have people that are going to get\nkilled, but the Jews were all together different. He just wanted to get rid of all of them.\nTake a whole nation and get rid of them. From what I understand in a lot of those camps,\nI have an American that was in the camp and I worked with him after\nthe war and he remembered me always used to have a lot of talks with me. He used to\ncome over to me and tell me what was going on. He said, Sam, there are a lot of people\nthat may not believe you, but I know what you went through, because he was there\nhimself.",

    "answers": [
        "A: My name is Samuel Spiegel. I was born in , Poland on August the 23rd,\n1922. I had three more sisters and a brother. I was the oldest one. We had a shoe factory\nat home, and my mother passed away in childbirth and I was four years old. Then my\nfather remarried a year later. We had a pretty normal living until the war broke out. I\nwouldn't say we were rich, but we were middle class. We lived pretty nicely. Then when\nthe war broke out in 1939 it was September Ist a bomb fell into the house. It was about\n7:00 in the morning and we were lucky to get out about five minutes before, and nobody\ngot hurt. But, this was only the beginning because the minute the Germans came in,\nthings started to get very bad for us. It was September when school starts again, and\nJewish kids were not allowed to go to school anymore. But, the Jewish community\nopened up some little Jewish schools that the kids went to so they can learn a little bit. In\n1940, the middle of 1940, the Germans gave an order that we have to give away all the\njewelry and all the furs that all the people had, and we gave everything away, but we\nthought it's a war, maybe they need it and things are going to get a little bit better. Things\nstarted getting worse and by the end of 1941 they made the Ghetto in our town.",
        "A: Before the war, I went to school, which was a public school, but there were very few\nJewish kids in our class of 55 kids, there were about six Jewish kids. They must sit on\none side, the left side of the class. Mostly it was a catholic school and prayers were said\nevery morning and every night before we went home from school. We just stood there,\nbut the Jewish kids didn't have to say the prayer. We mixed with the friends that I had in\nschool, but socially we hadn't mixed. Sometimes when they needed some help, some\nschool help, they used to come to my house, and I used to help them out a little bit, but\notherwise, they had different friends and we had different friends. Because I went to\nschool from early in the morning until about 2:00 in the afternoon. 2:00 we used to come\nhome and have our main meal. Then I used to go to a Jewish school to learn religion. I\nusually didn't come home until about 6:00 in the evening. Then, at night my father was\nvery active and designed this movement in those days, so I used to go to a Hebrew\nSchool which was called a Tabut, and that's usually how my schooling was, because\nwhen the war broke out, I was about 16 1/2 close to 17 years old.",
        "A: Very involved, but I wouldn't say very religious, more like conservative.",
        "A: A little bit. I was younger. I don't remember exactly, but I know he was involved in\norganizations quite a lot.",
        "A: Usually around Easter or Christmas time, the Jewish people used to be a little bit afraid\nand they used to lock their doors because what they preached mostly in the churches.\nWhen they come home and they have a couple drinks or so, things were pretty rough, but\notherwise we didn't have any problems.",
        "A: No, we were aware very little of what was going on in Germany. Even when the Germans\ncame in, we figured it's a war maybe things are going to change a little bit, but they\nclosed in every time, there came some new rules out and it got to be very bad for the\nJewish people.",
        "A: Our town had about close to 10,000 population. 4,500 of it were Jews, close to 50\npercent.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: September the Ist?",
        "A: We ran out from the house, then we had to get another place to live. I think we moved in\nwith our grandmother for a little while in a room just to stay until things straightened a\nlittle bit out. Then when they moved us in and we stayed there for a while, and I got sick\nin 1940, I had the typhus, and I was lucky they put me away in a separate room and\nnobody found out about it, and I survived somehow the typhus. Then I worked for the\nJewish Community Center at home, because the Germans, when they made the Ghetto,\nmade like the Judenaut which was a self -- you know the Jews governed themselves and I\nworked in the office over there for them, until I sent away to , to the slave\nlabor camp. Things got very bad in the Ghetto. There was a lot of sickness, a lot of\npoverty. We didn't get enough food to eat to feed the people, but we helped each other as\nmuch as we could as a community. Because we still lived in our own homes, and we had\nsome little things we could trade for food with the farmers from the outside and I even\nhad a paper that I could go outside of the Ghetto, because I worked in the office and I\nworked in the labor department, in that section. I could see what started going on and I\nwas very, very upset with all those things, and I figured that I couldn't stay over there too\nlong, and I decided to get out and when I went to to the camp, this was\nbefore they took all the Jewish people out from our town. The fellow that took me out\nfrom there was an SS man by the name of . He said we have to go to\n, because there's a big ammunition factory and we'll have to send a lot\nof people over there to work. We have to go over and see how things are set up over\nthere. When I came over there, we went over there on a Thursday and he said Monday\nmaybe we'll come back and he said Sam there's nothing to go back anymore because all\nthe Jewish people from your town were taken away. That's how I stayed over there. All\nthe time I was in for about two years.",
        "A: It was closed in barbed wires. You couldn't go in, you couldn't get out unless you had a\nspecial paper from the German government. The SS used to come in every day to the\nGhetto, take people out to work, kill a lot of them while they were doing it, and we even\nhad a little hospital over there. A lot of people that got sick and had typhus, they took\nthem out and they shoot them, they killed them. Also, I remember when they came in one\nday and this was in 1942 in the beginning, and they said they need about 25 men and 25\nwomen because they had to take them away to a factory somewhere to work. They took\nthem into a public bath house. They gave them a bath and they shaved their hair and\neverything else and they send them away. We found out later that they took them away to\na concentration camp that they tried out the crematoriums on them. This was a try out.\nWe couldn't believe that those things are happening, but later on we found out that they\nwere true. There was gas put into the crematoriums. Life was very difficult in the Ghetto.\nYou couldn't do anything. There was no work. Nobody was working except when the\nGermans took you out to work somewhere on the outside, but you still used to come\nhome at night and be with your family. That was one good thing about it. You always had\nhope. You figured it's a war, maybe the war is going to finish tomorrow. Maybe things\nare going to change. We also felt that we have to stick together in order to keep each\nother alive and maybe things are going to change a little bit.",
        "A: All cultural activities and everything stopped because the Germans were watching out\nthat you couldn't do, you couldn't do things, you know, you were lucky. You were afraid\neven to go out into the street during the day because they would catch you all the time\nand send you out to work and sometimes you didn't even know if you were going to come\nhome, so usually you were hidden all the time as much as you could. They used to come\nin every day to the Ghetto and do what they want to, and a lot of people got killed. If they\ndidn't like somebody, they just killed them 1n the middle of the street. It didn't make any\ndifference.",
        "A: Oh, sure, absolutely. I remember the name. He was a Ukrainian, not really an SS, by the\nname of Schmitky, they used to call him. He was a very, very cruel man. He just came\nout. I remember right near our house there was a fellow, his name was Littman, Phil\nLittman was his name, and I remember he shot him right in front of our house. We were\nsitting inside. We were afraid even to go out. So those things were going on daily. It was\na daily occurrence. It wasn't new.",
        "A: I couldn't say because I don't remember and I don't think so. It's true that they got\ntogether and they talked about certain things, but very little could be done, because there\nwas no help from the outside. In the Ghetto without help from the outside, it was very\nhard to organize anything, especially in a small town like ours.",
        "A: We used to observe it in the way we could. I remember my mother used to light candles\nevery Friday, but as far as the food was concerned, we didn't have the food that we had\nbefore the war. If you had a little piece of bread and some potatoes it was enough just to\nsurvive. I used to help a little bit because I worked in the Judenaut and I had maybe my\nportion a little bit more so I usually used to bring it home instead of eating so I can help\nout the family a little bit.",
        "A: The way I got the job was the fellow who was running the Judenaut, was a very good\nfriend of my father's, and that's how I got the job. It wasn't easy to get a job like this,\nbecause usually when you work for the Judenaut and you're over there and all the food\nand everything came in, you always had a little bit more that you can have a little piece\nof bread more to eat, but I usually didn't eat it myself. I brought it home, because I knew\nthe rest of the family needed it more than I did, because they didn't have any other means\nto get their food from.",
        "A: The privileges that I had was that I wasn't called to work every day, that I was at home,\nand I worked in the office, and I had special papers that even I could walk outside of the\nGhetto, if I had to go out for something. If you get out from the Ghetto, because you m1x\nwith the Gentile people outside, you could help yourself a little bit more.",
        "A: No, not much. I had a younger brother, which I send him out to work one time, which\nthey worked at , and it was named , the firm. But\nwhat happened, the day before they took all the Jews from our town, he came home, the\nnight before. He was caught in the transport and he was taken away.",
        "A: Mostly by the Germans. They picked one man, and then he picked everybody that he\nwanted to. Some people that he knew or were close friends of his.",
        "A: We knew it was a very difficult time. You have to understand what was going on in those\ndays. You had to do what the Germans wanted you to do. If they came in and saw the\nPresident of the Judenaut, I want 200 people tomorrow to work, you had to be the one to\nsupply those 200 people. So, you had a lot of people that didn't like you because, they\nsaid why take me? Why not take somebody else? You're put in the position that if you do\nright or you do wrong, you're not right. I'm sure that you heard that ;\nwhich was the President, committed suicide because he knew what was going on. Some\npeople were a little bit stronger and they didn't commit suicide. They did what they had\nto do and they made a lot of enemies. In my opinion they really helped a lot of people,\ntoo. But you don't remember the good things that people do, a lot of people you\nremember the bad things what a lot of people do. I couldn't say that I think most of them\ndidn't want to do what they did, but they had to do because they were forced to do,\nbecause if not, somebody else would do the thing, and they would lose their life.",
        "A: Right. The labor department, for instance, the Germans came in. They said we want 200\npeople tomorrow to go to work tomorrow morning, and we had to get out the names from\nthe register that we had, which people are going to go tomorrow and which people are\ngoing the next day. I worked in the office, you know to go alphabetically, but I wasn't\nreally the one who went out and took the people out, who put them to work. I worked in\nthe office.",
        "A: They usually were made according the list that we had. The way the President of the\nJudenaut decided or the people on top of them. I was young. I was 17 years old. I didn't\nmake the big decisions. They said, listen, those people we don't want to go, and those\npeople we want to go, because you know there is always somebody who 1s a little better\noff or have other people, and we were watching out that the people in the position to help\nother people they should stay in place to help them, instead of sending them out of town.",
        "A: Usually we try to take them according to alphabetical order, so we really, I don't think we\nmade choices you know this person is going to go and this person is not going to go. I\nmentioned that there were certain people who were privileged. If he had some in his\nfamily, you know, he didn't send them out to a certain job that was very hard. He picked\nthem out to go to a job that was a little easier. I imagine everybody did the same thing. If\nI could help some of my friends, I helped them. If I could help somebody else.",
        "A: No, not too many that I can remember.",
        "A: I don't remember. There might have been in the higher echelon, but I wasn't in the higher\nechelon to be able to tell you.",
        "A: That's right. They used to dispense the food. They used to get it, and then divide it. The\npeople used to have little carts that you used to come to collect your food, once a week or\ntwice a week. We also had soup kitchens that we set up in order to help the people that\ndidn't have a place to cook or couldn't help themselves.",
        "A: The Ghetto was very, very bad, and lot of people when they had people who hardly had\nanything, if they heard about a good job that was outside, that the Germans took you\naway, they wanted to go because the Germans never told you that they were going to take\nyou to a concentration camp or somewhere else. They said we have here, we need some\npeople to send out the job. We're going to take you and you're going to be living over\nthere and you're going to be all right. So, a lot of people even went by themselves\nbecause they figured they would be better off than being in the Ghetto because the Ghetto\nwas very bad. You didn't have enough to eat and there was a lot of starvation and\nsickness going on. We didn't know really until later on what was going on in the\nconcentration camps, because even I, myself, didn't believe until I got to Auschwitz that\nthey're really gassing and burning people until I saw it myself.",
        "A: Yes, in 1942 I was in , and I worked over there in the building section.\nIt was a very, very big place. We lived right in the factory. It was like a whole city. It was\none of the largest ammunition factories in Poland. That's where I got to know my wife\nover there in 1942 because women and men were in the same camp. We lived in separate\nbarracks, but we were in the same camp. The camp was really watched by a Ukrainian.\nThe Germans were in charge, but Ukrainians were watching our camp. It was pretty\ntough over there, but we had a little bit more to eat. We worked but we mixed with other\nnationalities. The Polish people worked in the same factory. At night time we used to\ncome home and still see our friends and everybody else. We tried to help each other as\nmuch as we can. Let's say, if somebody could bring a little piece out from the outside and\nhe could share it somebody else, he usually shared it with somebody else. We found out\nafter the war that the fellow that was in charge of our camp over there, he was a German\nby the name of Brant, that thanks to him, that labor camp was a little bit better, that we\ndidn't suffer as much as in other camps. He was caught after the war in the\nand he was telling the things that he was doing for us. I know when they took us away to\nAuschwitz, he went to Auschwitz and told them that , We were very\ngood workers and we know the ammunition, that we worked in the ammunition factory,\nand they should send us to work in the factories. They did. Very few of our people,\nexcept the older ones were taken away to the crematorium. The rest of us we got numbers\nand we were sent away to work. I wasn't in Auschwitz really too long. I was over there\nmaybe three or four days. When we came to Auschwitz, by the old conductor trains, the\nwagon, the cattle trains, a lot of our people were dead, because we traveled -- I don't\nremember exactly if it took two days, or three days, or maybe four days, but we didn't\nhave any food. We didn't have any water. They didn't give us anything. We didn't have\nany facilities even in the wagons. When they opened up, a lot of people were dead, and\nbecause we were people that already came from another labor camp, we didn't have any\nluggage with us, or any valuables. They chased us out from there and we went through\nthe showers, and luckily it was showers and not gas. We came out from there and they\nnumbered us and they put us in barracks. Then, people came in from factories because\nthe Germans, this was in 1944, a lot of the Germans went up on the front lines and they\nneeded people to replace them at their factories, so they needed workers. So they came in\nfrom the factory, this is from the train factory and they said they need\nsheet metal men. I didn't have a trade, but I had a friend by the name of Coopersmith. He\npassed away, he survived and lived in California and they said Sam, when they ask for\nsheet metal men, why don't you pick up your hand and tell them you're sheet metal man.\nYou're very handy, you'll go with me. We'll see that you do something, but God's will\nthey picked him and sent him to a coal mine and they sent me into Germany to work in\nthe train factory. I came in over there, I didn't know the trade, I didn't know what to do,\nbut then I tried to take the broom and keep the shop very clean, which it was a very big\nfactory. There was about 6,000 people working over there, but our section had maybe 30\npeople working, 35, in the sheet metal section, and there were three Germans that were\nrunning it, so because I kept the place clean, so they figured everything is fine. They took\na liking to me. I learned a little bit of trade over there. By the end of 1944 I think it was in\nNovember, when the United States and the Russians started progressing more on\nGermany, and the Germans used to have their shops on the front lines 1n trains, and they\nbunked a lot of those trains, they brought a lot of our men to the train factory to be fixed.\nThe soldiers that were in those trains, came with them. They usually waited until the\ntrains were fixed, so they put on another shift. Before they put on another shift, the SS\nman came in. His name was Fox. He said, each one he assigned us a train, a pullman to\ngo out and check on those pullman. I went out to mine because I didn't know the train,\nbut I knew how to write and read and I made a plan of the train and I showed him where\nthe damage was and what we're going to fix. When he came on and asked everybody\nwhat to do, he came to me and after I showed him those, he says you're going to run the\nsecond shift. I couldn't tell the men. I took the bull by the horn. I figured listen I had to\ntake a chance because I had different nationals working under me in the second shift. We\nwent out to work, and we did the job so fast that we got a little bit tobacco extra and I\nnever smoked. Usually everything I got, I shared it with the people. They knew that I\ndidn't know the trade, but they couldn't tell the men that I don't know it either as long as I\nwas put in charge, I was put in charge over the train. That's where I learned my trade.\nWhen I came to the United States, that's the trade I went into, and I built up a shop in\nWashington DC and thank God I was very successful, and that's how I made a living in\nthe United States when I came over here.",
        "A: In concentration camp we didn't have any interaction with the guards. You're very, very\nscared of them. I'm going to tell you an incident which happened to me. I worked in the\nsheet metal shop, and I used to make things out of little pieces of copper that I used to\nfind, other things, some rings. I used to exchange them for little pieces of bread. I was\ncalled one day, and this was about the end of November 1944, and the men took my\nnumber and usually every Sunday the persecutions were going on, because we didn't\nwork. Anybody did something that they didn't like, they used to hang them and then send\nthem away to the crematoriums.",
        "A: Auschwitz. And I already knew what was going to happen. I figured my gosh how can I\nget out of it. I knew what was going to happen to me on Sunday because I was caught\nwith materials that , which means they are materials they use during\nthe war for war materials, because I used copper. So, I made the decision that when the\nmain commandment came out, we had appeals every morning that we stayed out. I had to\ncome because the Germans were very how do you say it -- they counted us almost all the\ntime. I went out and I went down to the main man behind him and I told him that I was\nmaking something for him for Christmas and it was taken away from me in the shop. I\nsaid I don't mind that they took it away from me, but I said I worked for it for almost two\nweeks in order to have it for you as a present and I would like you to have it. It went\naway, I never heard any thing more about it. They never called me. The commander got\nto know me very well because we went out through the gate a lot of times. He used to\nknock me on the shoulders when we went out. That's how I survived from going to the\ncrematoriums one time. We had to think sometimes. When the Ghetto was liquidated, my\nwhole family went to Treblinka, and they all perished in the crematorium in Treblinka.\nThat's what I found out at , a couple weeks later after I was there.\nSo, I was the only one from the whole family left, from the immediate family, but I had\nsome friends that they brought in from my town to , too, and they worked\nover there. So, we used to meet every day. I think in there must have been\nabout 2,000 or a little bit over 2,000 people over there working. Things were tough. We\ndidn't have enough to eat. There was sicknesses. I had two friends by the name, one of\nthem, that he was sick one of them was and the other one was\n, and they took them all out one day and they shot them all. They\nliquidated the whole hospital in . They took everything out. So, you can\nimagine how we felt. Things were very bad. I had to get in to tell other monstrosities that\nwere going on over there, but that's what they did. They took them all out and shot them\nat one day. Plus the other things that were going on. We got beatings every day, coming\nin or going out. The food was very bad. We used to get a little piece of bread in the\nmorning and we used to get little bit of soup at night. But, like I told you, we tried to help\neach other in order to keep our things a little bit up. When we came to Auschwitz, it was\naltogether different. It was hard to believe what was going on over there. We could see\nthe chimneys. We could smell the smoke. We knew the people that were taken over there.\nWe were ones of the lucky ones. The minute we got out of the wagons and they started\nchasing us and they gave us the numbers on our arms, and they shaved us all together and\nthen they put us through a solution that we walked through. We didn't even know. We\nwere just like animals. You were chased and you didn't know what was going on to you\nat that time. Then they put us in line and they came out and the doctors mingle and the\nother ones were in white coats, and they look through and one of them goes to this side,\nand one of them goes to this side, and one to this side, and one to the other side. Now, I\nwas lucky that it was Birkenau, not really Auschwitz. This was part -- they called it\nAuschwitz II. Then them came to make the selections. When they made the selections\nand I was sent away in those first three days, that I was in Auschwitz three or four days. I\ndon't even remember. It's very hard for me to remember. We didn't do any work. We\nwere sitting outside. It was cold, it was wet and they wouldn't even let us get into\nbarracks until they came at night. Then we used to sleep with 15 people on one\n, with a little bit of snow. I was glad to get out from there. When they\nbrought us into , which was part of Auschwitz, it was the factory that we\nwent to, over there, because we worked with different nationalities and we worked in the\nfactory with a lot of Germans, everybody had a different . We had a\nstraw sack with a little blanket. That's all we had. We slept with about 200 people in one\nroom. But they kept us a little bit cleaner. We had the laundry and the clothes that we\nwere wearing the striped clothes. We had to change because in the factory it was grease\nworking around trains. We had to change. We used to come home, and used to change\nthe clothes and they gave us other clothes. But, we had selections every Sunday. They\nlooked us through, and if somebody didn't look so good, they took them out and they\nsend them away to the crematoriums. They brought in other people to replace them. The\nfood we got in the morning, you had to get up about 4:00 in the morning and we stayed\noutside. They called it Appeal, that they counted us, every morning, and if somebody was\nmissing, we had to stay outside, cold or rain didn't make any difference until the men\nwere found. Because sometimes somebody died during the night and never even came\nout, or something happened, but we had to wait. And if they didn't count us, we didn't\ncouldn't go to work until everything was counted. Then we had about five miles, maybe\nfour miles that we would have to walk from the camp to the factory. The music was\nplaying near the gate where we went out, and the music was playing at night when we\ncame home. We got a little piece of bread, about six of us got one pound of bread. The\nbread was made out, you could feel the straw inside that you could hardly eat it, but we\nhad to eat it because you had to survive on something. We got a little bit, 1t was like tea.\nThey said it was a special tea that was made that we drank a little bit. Then in the middle\nof the day you got a little bit of soup which was mostly water. Then at night, when we\ncame home, either we got another little piece of soup or we got another little piece of\nbread. This was our food for a whole day. Things were very, very bad, because a lot of\npeople, we didn't have enough food, they used to get diarrhea and they used to get sick.\nThe minute you got sick a little bit, you were taken out, and we alot of times when we\nwent out to work and maybe 2,000 people, and the men says I only want 1,800 back and\nby the time we got back, we had trucks behind us that they killed off the rest of them. We\njust loaded on the truck the ones that couldn't keep up with --you know, because we\nwalked from the factory to the thing. The ones that couldn't keep up with it, they killed\nthem on the road, and they put them on the trucks and then they took them away to the\ncrematoriums. But we couldn't help ourselves. We couldn't even escape because on the\noutside there was nobody to help us. I had a friend that escaped from the trains when they\ntook us on the trains and got into the woods, and when he came back, he was taken to\nTreblinka at that time. His name was . I'll never forget. He came back, he\nsaid listen don't go on those trains because they burn you over there and we thought that\nthe man was crazy. We didn't believe him. We said how can they tell living people and\nburn them especially you know in our days? And another thing that we couldn't\nunderstand it's as 1f the world would know that those things would go on, we are taught\nthat somebody outside must know because if they would know what was going on in\nhere, they couldn't sit outside and not do anything about it. But, we never got any help\nfrom the outside. When he was on the outside and was in the woods, he said he couldn't\nstay over there because they wanted to kill him because , SO he\ntried to get back and came back to our camp in . This was in\nbefore they took us on the trains. That man didn't live through. They\ntook us on the trains to go to Auschwitz, because he was already on those trains going to\nTreblinka one time, from , from our town. He jumped the train from\nAuschwitz, and he was shot before he got -- no, before we got on the train, he ran away,\nand he was shot. But, when we came to Auschwitz, we realized what the man told us was\ntrue, but we couldn't help ourselves. Auschwitz, we had a lot of hope. We could see that\nthis thing couldn't last on forever. But, it was very easy to commit suicide. All you had to\ndo was through yourself on the wires, because the wires were electric. They had 600\nvolts in them. And a lot of people did it. But, if we found out that somebody was very\ndespondent and we felt that he was going to do something, we tried to talk to him and tell\nhim listen, the outside world cannot sit like t his and watch what's going on here and not\ndo anything. It looks like the war is already coming to an end. We knew little things what\nwere going on because we didn't have any radios. We didn't have any papers, and nobody\nwas telling us anything because even the Germans that worked with us in the factory\nwere afraid to talk to us, because if they noticed that they talk to us too much, they took\nhim away. They took them away, too. So, we tried to help each other as much as we\ncould in order to survive. And thank God some of us survived. When they took us out on\nthe Death March --.",
        "A: All right. One day, when we were , they came in and they said that they\nhave to take us all out. They didn't take us where we were going. We found out later that\nthis was the death march. We were only about 60 kilometers away from Auschwitz and\nall the people that were going met the same way. So, they took us out one morning. It\nwas snowing in January, January the 22nd. It was snowing and it was very cold outside\nbecause over there the temperature goes about 30 degrees below zero. We didn't have any\nclothes. We didn't have anything with us, and we marched because they didn't have any\ntrains to put us on, and anybody that couldn't keep up with the marchers were shot on the\nway. One night it was in January, I think it was the 25th of January, they brought us to a\ncamp in , which was a big factory. They brought us in all over there\nbecause the SS that were going with us, they had to rest a little bit too. So, we stayed over\nand in the middle of the night they started shelling the factory. They woke us up about\n12:00, 1:00 in the morning. There might have been about 60,000 of us over there because\nthey brought them from all over. They chased us out and I had a dream that night when I\nwas sleeping, my mother came to me and said Sam, don't leave this place and I had an\nargument with her. I told her listen, how can I not leave. You know we're almost\nliberated. You see what's going on, but when they started chasing us, I forgot the dream.\nWhen I was near the gate to go out, I had two friends with me, one was from my town,\nWeinberg was his name, and the other one was from . When we came to\nthe gate, my dream came back to me and I figured, no I'm not going to go. I'm not going.\nSo, the other one from my town, he didn't want to go with me. He said, Sam we're almost\nliberated I'm going out. I'm going where they chasing us to go. I said no, but the other\none, I took care of him. He was a little bit younger and I took care of him a lot in camp\nwhen I was there. So, I smacked him in his face and I took him with me and I ran back\ninto the camp to the other side and there was a big hole. It was a brick wall over there\nabout three foot thick, and there was a big hole in it that was made from one of the shells\nor something. I crawled out and there was a ravine and I rolled down into the snow with\nthem and we ran into the woods and we stayed over there for about eight days until the\nRussians came in. The Russians liberated us. If you asked me how I survived in those\nwoods for eight days in that cold weather and everything else, I can hardly remember. I\nknow we had frozen toes and at night time we used to go out from the woods. In Europe\nthey used to have to put away potatoes in the winter time outside and they used to cover\nthem with sawdust and then have a door on the southside that they used to take the\npotatoes out. The sun used to come out during the day, so we stole some of those potatoes\nand we ate those raw potatoes and we had snow as water. That's how we lived through\nuntil we survived from those eight days. If you ask me to tell you anything about those\nthings, I couldn't. But there were some other people in the woods too, when I was over\nthere. I met a friend of mine, from my town, that escaped too, at the same time, by the\nname of David Bay, and he lives now in Washington, D.C., and we're still very close. We\nused to crawl one into the other one in order to keep us warm during the night until we\ngot up the next morning. Then we used to run a little bit, you know, in order just to\nsurvive. Then from that time after, I walked home. It took me almost about two weeks to\nget home because there was no transportation. We could catch any transportation we\ncould, and when I came home, -- so I was one of the ones who was liberated early. Even\nwhen I came back to my town--the reason I went back was because I thought maybe\nsomebody from my family was alive still. I couldn't believe that everybody was gone that\nwas there. There was no work, and no way to make a living, and I told you before that\none of my father's friend's daughter was alive. She was on the Gentile side. She was not\nin a concentration camp. She was home already. I even got together with her I told her I\nsaid Tasha, we are only about seven Jewish people in the whole town that came back in\nthose days when I was over there. Some of them even came from the Russian side\nalready or there were Gentile papers. I said we have to do something 1n order to make a\nliving. I said I'm going to put that flour mill back in operation. I did. I got the Gentile\nfellow, the machine shop, and we put it back in operation. We started -- the farmers used\nto bring in their corn, and we used to keep 50 percent for the making the flour and they\nused to keep the other 50 percent. That's how me made a living in those days. We have a\nlittle house over there. We remodeled a little bit and we moved in. I didn't know that\nRegina was alive still --.",
        "A: When I came back to town, the first thing, we left a lot of things with a lot of people, with\nour neighbors. I couldn't get anything back, and I was afraid to get back because I figure\nwhen asking to give back they might do something to me. So, all the Jewish people that\ncame back, we moved into one of our houses that my uncle used to have. And we stayed\nover there all together, and one of my cousin's survived too. She lives now in Belgium.\nSo, we all lived over there for quite a while, maybe for a couple, two or three months, but\nwe had to go and get something to eat, because nobody gave us. We used to go to the\ngovernment, but they themselves didn't have too much, but at least we had a little piece\nof bread to eat because we didn't need the things like you know like we live over here\nnow. If we had a piece of bread and a couple potatoes, this was enough for us to eat. But\nwe Started to build up ourselves a little bit. But, I got sick. I had to go to the hospital. I\nhad the infection. I was in the hospital for a little while, but when I came out and I got\ntogether with my father's friend's daughter, we decided that we had to do something. I\ndidn't want to put it up as a business. I wanted to put it up so that we can make a living\nand the farmers needed us too. The farmers were after us to put the flour mill back in\noperation because that was the only flour mill around, maybe 50 miles around our\ncommunity. The only one.",
        "A: Not really. I hate to say it, but even with the friends that I went to school and everything\nelse, I lived over there. I was born over there. My family lived over there for generations.\nI don't know how many generations, but the first question when they saw me \"You're still\nalive?\" But, things are different now. I always tell them that I wish you would ask me if I\nlived in Holland, not in Poland. From the whole town, from the 4,500 that we lived in, I\nthink maybe close to a 100 are alive and not all went to concentration camps. A lot of\nthem ran away to Russia and they came back from Russia after the war. We still get\ntogether even during the summer, we have sometimes a gathering from our town that we\nget together, all of them together, to see how everything goes.",
        "A: No, not too kind. And we had --I had to escape from there, because they started pogroms\nagain. The pogroms started in and the day Regina came back she went to\nher town, and she went up to her apartment and knocked at the door to find out if some of\nher family may have come back. There was a fellow behind that said Regina run away\nbecause they just killed . was a fellow that came\nback too from concentration camp, and they just killed him. So, she went down from that\napartment and she didn't have time to get into her apartment house, then she came back to\nmy town.",
        "A: In the beginning, I think I said that I met Regina in in 1942, and\nthen when they took us on the train to Auschwitz before they took us off the trains we\ncould see what was going on. We made up that if we live through we're going to meet in\n, my little town, and get together over there. She was liberated in May, and\nwhen she came back to our town, was sometime June, but it's miraculous that she was\nliberated on the third day, she already knew that I was alive, because things were going\non, the communication. She knew, she met some people that says I already heard that\nSam is alive and I was glad to hear too, and I was waiting for her to come back because I\nwas the only one left from the whole family. She was the only one left from the hole\nfamily.",
        "A: I was hoping that I would because I knew I lost everybody else, but I was very happy to\nhear that she was still alive because I found out. News traveled, and maybe I should get\nback for someplace for her to come to, but we couldn't get married. What happens in the\nJewish religion to get married you need ten people to have a witness to have a\n. There weren't ten Jews even there to get married, but we got together the\nones that were over there and we told them, that because she doesn't have a place where\nto live and I don't, we're going to move in together and we're going to get married the\nminute we can get married.",
        "A: Oh, it's very I was one of the happiest people because I figured she was the closest one to\nme, because I was with her for almost two years in together, and in\nshe lived in a different barrack, and I lived in a different barrack and one\ntime I went over to visit her and one Ukrainian took me out from a room and I got 25\nlashes and I'll never forget it, but it was worth it to see her.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Oh, sure. You could go in. We didn't live together in the same barracks, but we lived in\nthe same camp and the same camp you could go and visit them. But if the Ukrainian, if\nhe wasn't a very nice fellow, he took you out and most of them were not nice and they\njust gave me a beating one of those times. He said it's too late, you should already be in\nyour barrack not over here. Because I didn't have time to go when I got home from work\nanyhow. So, we knew in Poland that we couldn't stay over there no more. We'll have to\nleave this country. There's no place for Jews to live any more after what happened over\nthere. So, one day, when I found out what was going on and I had a threat that they're\ntrying to kill me so I went to the mayor of the town and I found out that he was one of the\nteachers that I used to go to school in my last years. His name was Peshko. He was in the\nunderground. He was in the underground during the war. I went over to him and I told\nhim Mr. Peshko, I have to leave. I lived through Hitler and I don't need this and I have to\nget a paper from you to get on the train because Russia was at that time in Poland and\nyou couldn't just go on a train any time you wanted to. So, he said, Sam I'm going to give\nyou a paper because we're trying to have a out on and\nmaybe you can get over there. But when I got the paper I was afraid to take the train in\nmy town because people knew me. So, Regina and I packed, just two sets of underwear\nin a little suitcase and I went out of town to another town to and took the\ntrain from over there. At that night we ended up on the Czechoslovakian border. They\nwent through and they checked your passports on the Polish side. We went out from the\ntrain. We crawled under the train on both sides. Went out to the Czechoslovakian train\nand so when the Asians went out from their trains we went upstairs and wind up in\nCzechoslovakia. When we came to Czechoslovakia we came to I think and\nthen we went to Prague. We got off the -- we took a street car to get into the town from\nthe train and Regina thought that I had the little suitcase and I thought she had the little\nsuitcase and we left it on the streetcar. So, we came to town to the main it was a station\nover there, a street car station, and I asked Regina do you have the suitcase? No, do you\nhave it? No. So, I asked the fellow, we spoke a little bit Czechoslovakian because it's the\nsame language a little bit similar to Polish, he said you wait here. It takes about three\nquarters of an hour for the street car to come back and I'm sure the little suitcase is going\nto be on it. We waited over there for three quarters and we had a little suitcase and we got\nit back, so we're lucky to get the two sets of underwear because we didn't have anything\nelse. But then they had the Jewish community over there already. We stayed over there,\nwe stayed in Czechoslovakia for maybe a month, and then I decided we can't stay here\neither and I went back with Regina to the American zone in Germany and I came to the\nD.P. camp in which was established at this time. We were one of almost\nthe first ones over there and I worked in that office too. I worked for the United Nations\nRelief Organization. I worked for the Joint Distribution Committee. And the Joint\nDistribution made our wedding over there. We got married over there. The wedding was\nin Munich, took us to Munich. Then Regina got sick. Something was wrong and they\ntook her to the hospital and they gave her some medicine which didn't agree with her and\nshe developed some kind of a blood -- something was wrong with her blood and a fellow\ncame in from the C.I.A, and American, by the name of Doctor Aaron Mayer, asked what\ncan I do for you. She said I don't need anything, the only thing she says I know I have an\nuncle in the United States that lived in New York, but I don't know where he lives but I\nknow his name was . So, what he did, Doctor Aaron Mayer, he put an ad\nin the Jewish papers but the uncle didn't read the Jewish newspapers. He read the New\nYork Times. A lady from Washington D.C. by the name o Mrs. Freedman, used to work\nwith her mother. Her mother used to have a dress shop in Poland, and she read the\nand she knew him from home and she called him up in New York and told\nhim that the niece of his is alive and was looking for him. The first thing we got from him\nwas papers to come to the United States and they were signed by J. Edgar Hoover,\nbecause J. Edgar Hoover was a friend of her uncle's. But we still couldn't come to the\nUnited States. It took us almost a year because in those days it was quarters and you just\ncouldn't leave. So, we waited over there but her uncle also at that time send us some\nmoney but we never got it because he said it's not allowed for you to have any American\nmoney in those days, so they sent it back to the uncle. We found this out after the war. I\nwas very friendly with that Doctor Aaron Mayer and the C.I.A. and we used to come\ntogether and meet each other while we were in Germany.\nEnd of Tape #1\nTape #2",
        "A: We got those papers from her uncle, and it took us almost a year before we could come\nover here, even with the papers being in order and everything else, but we moved from\nto because we found out one of the brothers was alive and he\nwas in the American Army. He escaped during the war. He went to England, then he got\non a ship and came to the United States and jumped ship. Then he joined the American\nArmy and became a citizen and that's how he came back to Europe. Then when we found\nout he was in Regina says we might as well move to SO we\ncan be closer to her brother. We stayed over there until we came over to the United\nStates. Let me tell you something about . When we came to\n, we were one of the first ones to come to the D.P. camp. There were\na lot of other nationalities over there, but they all had a home to go back to. They had\nrelatives, but the Jews didn't have any place to go back especially in Poland. There homes\nwere destroyed. No family left, and there was no place for them to go back and live. Even\nat the border, the ones that came back and started, they found out there's\nno place for them to live. They had to come back. They have to go back and it was a\nlucky thing that we have to thank President Eisenhower for opening up the borders and\nletting the Jews from Poland come back in to West Germany. Also, a lot of the people\nthat were in Russia somewhere else that they escaped didn't have any place to go and\nthey came to the D.P. camps in Germany. We stayed over there. In the beginning the\nplace was almost like a Ghetto too. We were closed in the camps. They had soldiers\noutside watching us. We couldn't go out. We didn't have freedom to move. So, finally,\nPresident Eisenhower gave an order to take the guards off that we can go free around and\nmove to the towns that we want to so we could walk a little bit more out and everybody\nstarted to find out. Most of us wanted to go to Palestine in those days, but Palestine was\nnot a state and they couldn't take us. So, they had the ax of the ship that they got, they\ntook some of them in, but the rest of them we had to stay over there, especially if you\nwere married and you already have somebody those were the worst ones that they wanted\nto take out in those days. They took out only the small children that were left. They\nfigured that's the most important to get them out from Europe. The food in the camps was\nnot too bad, but they gave us rations but you know they said we'll give you 1,300 calories\nbut it depends what kind of food they give us, the calories. It wasn't food that the people\nwere used to it. So, President Eisenhower changed those things too. Then we started\nhelping ourselves a little bit, and started working a little bit and people started to find out\nwhere there families are so they can leave because none of us wanted to stay in the D.P.\ncamps, but we didn't have a place where to go. The United States wouldn't let us in in\nthose days. Canada wouldn't let us in. Australia wouldn't let us in. Go back to Poland, the\nPolish Jewish couldn't go back to Poland any more. I was over there already back one\ntime and I had to escape. So, we had problems for quite a while. It's hard to understand\nwhat was going on over there. With all those things, unless you're over there yourself you\nwitness it, because it's impossible to tell what was going on in the concentration camps or\neven the slave labor camps or even the D.P. camps. We still didn't have enough freedom\nin the D.P. camps until the end because we were still controlled by the Americans what\nwe can do and what we cannot do. President Eisenhower was a big help, and he really did\na lot for the D.P. camps, quite a lot.",
        "A: Not in the beginning when I got in over the first time, but later on it improved, because I\nworked in the office. I worked for the and I was taking care of the\nregistration. People that came in over there and then the was getting\nsome food out already for the people and they found out exactly what they need and what\nthey want. We had a kitchen. At least we had enough to fill our stomachs. We didn't have\nto wait until -- you still had to have cards to go and get your food, like coupons. But we\nalready had enough. They set up a school. If there were any children that came in, they\ncould go to school, and we organized our own theaters and clubs so we can come\ntogether and we can talk about. If a family was left, they found out if you were in one\ncamp, they could transfer from one camp to another camp so they can be with the family\ntogether. It was a big improvement. We were free at least. We knew what was freedom.\nI'm going to tell you about the food incident so you'll know what the difference was when\nwe finally got our papers to go to and come to the United States. When\nwe came on the ship, the first thing we asked the fellows, the Americans, says when we\nget our coupons to get food, because we always used all those years to get coupons to get\nfood. He says, don't worry, you're going to get enough to eat, but we couldn't believe it. I\nremember the first dinner we had when the ship went out. We were all sitting around the\ntables, and we saw all the bread and all the stuff on the table, everybody filled their\npackets up because we couldn't believe that there's so much, that there's food enough, that\nyou can eat as much as your heart desires. We had even a couple, an elder couple that\npassed away on the ship because they ate too much of the food that they shouldn't have\neaten. Even I remember myself after the first meal I couldn't eat for maybe three days. I\ngot sick, because we couldn't understand that there's so much food and here we were\ngoing around hungry. Even the D.P. camps, we had enough food but we didn't have the\nfood just satisfy yourself what you wanted to eat. You eat what they give you. They gave\nyou some soup. You had to go to the kitchen. You didn't cook yourself. You didn't have\nany facilities to cook. But things were much better in the D.P. camps than in the camps --\nI'm not talking about Auschwitz. Auschwitz was just unbelievable. It's hard to describe. I\nremember when I lived through and I came home and I told some people what I went\nthrough. At first I couldn't talk about it. It took a long time until I could tell anybody\nwhat I went through, but the people couldn't believe this. They couldn't believe that\nsomething like this happened, which I and Regina were just invited to the British\nEmbassy to watch a film and also to the Canadian Embassy to watch a film about the\nsurvivors, the American and the Canadian, that were shot down over Germany. A lot of\nthem instead of putting them in P.O.W. camps, they put them in Buchenwald and other\ncamps. There were a couple of survivors, one American, one Canadian and one British\nand I talked to them and they told me they came home and they told their parents what\nthey went through in Buchenwald and their parents told them you're just telling stories.\nThat 1s impossible. This could not happen. Finally now, they tape them in order to have\ntheir stories what they went through and lot of them are already very old. One of them\ntold me that Walsh was his name he said his father couldn't even come because he had a\nstroke. He wanted to come to the gathering that they had about the film, but he couldn't\ncome to it any more. So, his son was over there representing him. Those other things that\nhappened, not only the Jews, even the other nationals, the Gentile people that were over\nthere, the Americans and the English, even when they told their stories nobody would\nbelieve them when they told them what was going on in those camps.",
        "A: A lot of Ukrainians over there and we didn't feel very comfortable with them because\nthey were in charge with our camps, of our labor camps and they all had to leave in order\nfor us to get over there. We couldn't stay with them together. Because people don't realize\nbut they were our enemies not our friends. They used to say they were in camps in\nGermany, but we know what kind of camps they went into.",
        "A: It worked that they had to ship them somewhere else. They had a home to go back to but\nthey didn't want to go home. They were afraid to go home because they were\ncollaborators with the Germans.",
        "A: That's right.",
        "A: In we had little houses like semi detached homes and usually you lived so\nmany people in a home. In one house, for instance we had a little house and most of our\nrelatives from out of town that came to our town lived with us in the same house, but we\nalready had for instance we had separate rooms. Two people slept in a room, or three\npeople slept in a room, because when we were in the Ghetto, we were a family of I had\nthree sisters, a brother, myself and my parents, we all had only one room, and the room\nwasn't too big. I don't know if the room was ten feet by fifteen feet. We all slept in one\nroom. Some people had it even worse. It was more crowded even. We already, we\nfigured we're lucky. The whole family stays together in one room. Some of them they put\ndifferent families together because it was very crowded. They didn't have any place for\nthem. The Germans didn't care. They brought them in, you find a place for them where to\ngo.",
        "A: Yes, a lot of them worked too. They worked for the Joint Distribution\nCommittee but as far as other jobs like working in trades or something, but the\ncame in and the put up some schools to teach the people\ntrades. That was a very, very big help because a lot of them don't like -- fix typewriters\nand other stuff and they came over here to the United States and somewhere else and\nthat's the business that they went into. That's what they started doing here.",
        "A: To me it took a long time to come back, but to a lot of people that were very religious and\nthey had religion going on. They didn't have those big temples like they have here, but\nthey had little rooms that they got together, but they celebrated either Passover or Rosh\nHoshana, Yom Kippur. We celebrated those holidays. There were some that didn't want\nto celebrate and you had some that were very religious and some were not so religious.",
        "A: Myself? When I came back to Poland and I saw what was left from the whole family, for\na while I thought why be Jewish. If God could have been around to watch over us the\nthings that were going on and not say anything, maybe there's nobody around here.\nFinally you know I'll get away from it. I don't look so Jewish. I was born here. I'll get\naway from it. There's not too many Jews, but after the pogroms started again, I figured I\ncannot do those things, because if I'm going to marry somebody and my kids are grown\nup, they might do the same thing what the people are doing right now here. My religion\nis still better. I don't have to be very, very religious but it's still better than any other\nreligion that sided against it.",
        "A: Not that I was smarter than anybody else. A lot had to do with luck where you were, and\nwhat you were doing at a certain time. A lot of times, even now, I think why me why\nnobody else from my family except me. I can't answer that question. What kept us\ntogether was because we were young, very, very young. The older people that had more\nexperiences and more knowledge about life, a lot of them committed suicide or they\ncouldn't put up with it. But we young ones, we kept each other going. Life was just\nstarting for us, and we figured that this has to come to an end. We knew that a war does\nnot go on forever. And we also promised each other that somebody has to stay alive to\ntell what was going on in that hell, what was really going on 1n those camps and every\nwhere else. Who else is going to tell them, because now the youngest one already is my\nage and in another short time, there's very few of us going to be left, especially witnesses\nthat were over there. It's going to be history and history doesn't change around. They\nalready deny it. You have a lot of revisionists that say that the Holocaust did not happen.\nSo, we feel, because we never talked about those things, but we feel that now that we\nhave to talk about them in order to make people and especially the kids that those are the\nthings that really happened. For instance last year I and Regina went with a group of kids,\nJewish kids from all over the world. We went on the March of . We went\nto Poland. We took them to the concentration camps. Then we went to Israel. It's amazing\nwhat that did to the kids. At least they know they talked to some of them that were really\nthere and showed them the places and what was going on in those concentration camps.\nBecause just talking to somebody about it, it doesn't bring out as much as you can really\ngo to the place and witness and see what has been going on over there. A lot of those\nkids, that knew very little about Judaism have changed quite a lot.",
        "A: Those images come back to me all the time. There's plenty of nights that I talk to people\nabout them. I usually don't talk about those things during the day, and I told I have to be\nbusy in order to forget those things, but I wake up in the middle of the night still seeing\nall those monstrosities and everything else. I can't talk about them a lot of times, but I can\nsee them and I feel them. I wake up 1n a sweat and it's very hard for me to get back to\nsleep. If we get together with our friends that went through, that's all we talk about. We\ncan't talk about anything else. Thank God we have three children. We have seven\ngrandchildren and I ask my kids, I said when you were younger when they were very\nlittle and they saw my number when they were two years, two and half, they asked me\nwhat is that number I used to tell them some bad people did it to me. But later on they\nnever asked us any questions because they realized they heard us talk to our friends all\nthe time, and they knew that something very bad happened to us during that time. Even\nnow, they tell us that's why we didn't want to ask you about it. We knew what you went\nthrough but we didn't want to ask you about it. Even now, after 50 years, it's very, very\nhard to talk about it. But then we figured we have to establish a new life when we came\nover here. We worked very hard. I worked seven days a week, 20 hours, as many hours\nas it took in order to build up what I did, and thank God it's a wonderful country. I\nwouldn't like to live anywhere else, and I appreciate everything that the United States did\nfor me. And I'm paying taxes every year too, and I don't mind. They've been very good to\nme here and since I came to the United States, I've worked mostly for the government. I\ndid a lot of work -- I have clearance with the F.B.I., with the C.I.A., and I never forget\nwhen I came over to this country and I worked at and I worked at the\nand in the middle of the day, one of the soldiers came over and took me\nup to and I got very scared. I thought I was in Germany again. They were\ngoing to send me away somewhere else, and I found out the reason I was taken off of the\njob was because I didn't have my citizenship papers. I was not a citizen and it was a job\nin those days was very secret and that I can't work over there\nbecause I wasn't a citizen, but the minute I got my citizen papers, I established back my\ncredentials and I did not have a problem. Work mostly on the ladder. I even did the\nin the White House when Nixon was making the tapes. We worked\naround the clock for 24 hours in order to get the air conditioning and ventilation in the\nbasement. I'm thankful for everything. I have a very nice family and I hope that we stay\nwell that I can do more what I want to do to help other people which is very, very\nimportant.",
        "A: I don't want to go through the monstrosities to tell you what's going on too much. I get\nvery, you know, I'm but if you have any special questions you want to ask me that you\nwant me to say about I'll be glad to answer.",
        "A: The only thing I can say that not all people are bad. They are some good people with the\nbad ones too. Even there were in concentration camps, and I worked with a German that\nwas running the factory. It's true that he lost three sons in the war and he didn't like Hitler\ntoo much either, but he always every day, he knew what was going on, brought\nsomething in, like an apple sometime, a little piece of bread, but he told me don't take it\nuntil I go out from here, because if they catch me I'll be in trouble, and he put it away at a\ncertain place and then I left, before I left I used to go out and get it and I used to come\nhome, you know, back to the barracks, I used to share it with my friends. The fellow\nwhen were in the fellow that was in charge of our barrack was a German\nby the name of Walter, and I found out that he killed his parents and they put him in jail\nand then they put him in charge of us. I also found out later that it was a homosexual\nwhich I didn't even know what a homosexual really was when I was in camp in those\ndays, but he also had a girlfriend in the factory and he spoke German and she spoke only\nPolish and when he found out he took me to carry the letters from the factory back to\ncamp from him to her because he couldn't go out from camp. We went to work, but he\nstayed over the whole day and took care of it, so usually when I came home at night he\nhad this special soup for me which I shared with my friends and this means almost\ndifference between life and death, this soup. And also, in the winter time it was very cold\nover there, but because we worked in the train factory an the trains were running on coal,\nSO we made up that each man that came back took a little piece of coal and put it in his\npocket, very little piece, maybe a centimeter and half by centimeter and half, and when\nwe came back to the barracks, we had a little bellie stove, a little iron stove and the\nfellow that was running, that Walter, the German that was running the camp didn't mind\nand everybody threw the little piece of coal in that little stove and we had it a little bit\nwarmer at night. We were one of the lucky ones maybe. You had to help yourself a little.\nYou couldn't take too much of that coal back, but a little piece, nobody noticed when you\nwent through the gate and coming in with it and that's how we kept warm at night in the\ncamp. I imagine that we're also lucky that they took us instead of\nbeing in Auschwitz, because in Auschwitz you couldn't survive. The people that maybe\nsurvived there because usually they came in they picked them to do certain jobs, to take\nthe clothes away when we came off they took the clothes away from the people then they\nsorted the clothes, then they took the people, you know. If you were picked to do a job\nyou couldn't help it. You took the people from the gas chambers and put them 1n the\ncrematoriums and it was people like us. You know, they picked them out and that's what\nyou did. So, they use you as long as you could do it and if you got tired of doing it, they\nput you in the crematorium and picked somebody else to do it. So, it wasn't something\nlike just -- in the camp that I was in they used to hang people every\nSunday and everybody that did something bad, they used to hang them on Sunday. They\nused to pick up people from the rolls after they stayed on that appeal in the morning and\nwe used to hang them. They didn't do it themselves. Used to go out and put the thing on\ntheir neck, but you couldn't help it. Luckily I wasn't picked, but maybe if I would be\npicked I would have to do the same thing. It was one of those things. Another thing in\nthose camps, in Auschwitz Sunday when we didn't go to work even if it was cold, we had\nto stay outside the hole day. They wouldn't let us go into the barracks and sit inside\nbecause we were going to make it dirty. The floors are going to be dirty. We had to make\nour bed as much as we could every morning and then you were sick you were afraid to go\nto the infirmary because you knew what was going to happen to you. I'll never forget I\ncut myself once in my arm here, right here, and I was afraid to go, and I don't know what\nI did but I put a piece of rope on one side and on the other side and it just healed up and I\nused to go to work, and I used to be sick. I used to get a sore throat and a fever. I used to\ngo to work. I never stayed in the barracks. I figured if I stay I know what's going to\nhappen to me, so this way I just went through and when we went home, walking, we used\nto hold tight, used to hold each other in to the ends and my friends if I couldn't go my\nfriends were dragging me in until we got in there. I used to take my friends until we got\nback to camp, and that's how I survived. We helped each other. If not we wouldn't be\nhere. Even when I escaped, I'll never forget I can't even remember they said I was in the\nwoods it was so bad, but we survived somehow. It's amazing what a human being can\nstand when it happens. There was no place for us to escape because there was no body\nthat helped a Jew on the outside. Maybe in another country. Maybe in Holland or\nBelgium or France but not in Poland because most of the crematoriums were built in\nPoland. Even from the countries, they brought them into Poland, like Birkenau,\nAuschwitz, Maidonek. Maidonek, is a camp that still the Germans didn't have time to\ndestroy it and it's still, they can start up a ration over there in two days if they had to. The\ncrematoriums and everything is over there. That's why I took the march of the living kids\nwho went to Maidonek. It's not only the Jews that got killed during the war. A lot of the\nRussian prisoners. When I was in there was a camp of Russian\nprisoners that they brought in. There was an American prison camp too. They put them\non the outside with a fence around it, didn't feed them. They used to eat the grass from\nthe ground. They never put them to work, and they all died out, then they took them to\nthe crematoriums. So with us with the Jews, he just wanted to get rid of\nall the Jews. You know in a war that you're going to have people that are going to get\nkilled, but the Jews were all together different. He just wanted to get rid of all of them.\nTake a whole nation and get rid of them. From what I understand in a lot of those camps,\nI have an American that was in the camp and I worked with him after\nthe war and he remembered me always used to have a lot of talks with me. He used to\ncome over to me and tell me what was going on. He said, Sam, there are a lot of people\nthat may not believe you, but I know what you went through, because he was there\nhimself.\nEnd of Tape #2\nConclusion of Interview\n"
