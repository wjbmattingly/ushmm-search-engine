There are people who find acceptance because they integrate and\nthey\u2019re not threatening, and they \u2014 they just don\u2019t develop friendships, they don\u2019t\neat at each other\u2019s houses and thing \u2014 they don\u2019t have coffee klatches, but they\nleave each other alone.

Because you\u2019d come\nfrom a different world.

        "Q: The strangest thing to me in Zarasai on my first experience was the lack of\nautomobiles. There was not a single automobile. In fact, when one would be coming\nin from Kovno, that we had heard about, all the kids would gather to run after the\ncar. And we used to stand behind the car to smell the gasoline from the exhaust,\nbecause it was such an unusual smell. And that struck me. The other thing was that\nyou could find food on trees everywhere. All you had to do was walk in a certain\narea where the apple tree was hanging over the street, and get a stick and hit it, and\nget an apple and eat it, or a pear, or a bunch of cherries.

You go to the local woods, and you find a sapling that\u2019s just the right\nlength and the right size, and you cut it down, and that\u2019s your fishing pole. Now you\nneed fishing line. Well, you can\u2019t use just anything.

So this 1s going to be an accretion to the\ninterview with Mr. Al Jaffee on May 21\", by the U.S. Holocaust Museum, and we\nwere talking about \u2014 about legacies in some ways, so if you could \u2014 if you could\ngive me a Sense of what is it that you got from having lived in Zarasai that you\ncouldn\u2019t have here, and what 1s it that you got from here that you couldn\u2019t have\nthere?",
        "A: Oh, what an interesting question. I can quickly tell you what I brought from here\nto Zarasai, and how \u2014 how it helped me integrate into s \u2014 z \u2014 the children\u2019s society\nof Zarasai. First of all, most of the little guys that I met in Zarasai had never seen a\ntrain, a plane. They have seen maybe one or two automobiles in their lifetime so far:\nthey were six or seven years old. But there\u2019s \u2014 there\u2019s so much that never arrived in\nZarasai for them. And I would regale them with stories about subway trains that\narrive every five minutes and 2,000 people shove their way in, and go to work.\n99\nMay 21, 2016",
        "A: Yes, the one that terrified me. And \u2014 but they \u2014 you know, their mouths would\nhang open, and they would ask questions: how fast does this train go, and 1s it above\nthe ground? And I said, well, some of them are above ground; they\u2019re known as the\nelevated tracks, and some are subways, they go underground. And there\u2019s a new\ntrain every 10 - 15 minutes. And the kids would say to me, how many trains are\nthere? And I would say oh, there are \u2014 they go around the whole city, and it\u2019s just a\ncontinuous train tr \u2014 bunch of trains every 10 - 15 minutes. And I would tell them\nabout trips I had taken in buses and cars and with my father. And air \u2014 airplanes that\nwe watched take off and land. And they \u2014 they were staggered with \u2014 with curiosity.\nAnd \u2014 but then, I learned a lot from them. I learned how to \u2014 I\u2014I didn\u2019t know how\nto swim, so I learned how to make swimming \u2014 what do you call a \u2014",
        "A: Thing that you lie down on that supports you in the water, and you \u2014 you\npractice swimming.",
        "A: Water wings, or something like that.\n100\nMay 21, 2016",
        "A: Anyway, I learned how to make so many things. We made our own toys, we\nmade our own wagons, we made our own sleds. We \u2014 we \u2014 [phone ringing]\n[break]",
        "A: The \u2014 I learned a lot of how you \u2014 in Zarasai you didn\u2019t have Woolworth\u2019s and\nother stores that you could go in and buy whatever device you needed. If you\nneeded a device, you either made it, or you went without. And the way to find out\nhow to make it was to consult the local people. My friend Karowlka(ph) taught me\na lot of things; how to \u2014 how \u2014 how to \u2014 [\u2019Il give you an example of something \u2014 to\ngo fishing was a\u2014 a very interesting occ \u2014 pri\u2014 you know, business for us, and \u2014\nbecause the town was surrounded by lakes. But you need a fishing pole. Well, that\u2019s\nvery easy. You go to the local woods, and you find a sapling that\u2019s just the right\nlength and the right size, and you cut it down, and that\u2019s your fishing pole. Now you\nneed fishing line. Well, you can\u2019t use just anything. But there are white horses, and\nwhite horses have long, white tails, and you just pull out a few strands here and\nthere, and you braid them, and it turns into the \u2014 a-and then you \u2014 you have like a \u2014\nmaybe a two or three foot length, and you get about six or seven of those, and now\nyou have a terrific fishing line.

Nobody\nknows how to make a fish hook. And the store always has fish hooks. So we went\nfishing all the time with these things, and we caught the fish, we fried the fish and\nwe ate the fish and we had a wonderful time. But we also \u2014 you could buy sleds in\nthe wintertime, but my brother Harry and I loved to play \u2014 play with wood, and we\nwould make our own sleds, they were simple things, but \u2014 but we di\u2014 we didn\u2019t\nbother wi \u2014 sl-sleds were really so cheap that we were able to get a few pennies to\nbuy sleds. But we made our ice skates.",
        "A: We made our own ice skates because all it took was le-leather straps, a piece of\nwood, and then you go to the local blacksmith and he puts a little strip of iron\nunderneath as \u2014 as arunner. And you put the straps \u2014 nail the straps to the piece of\nwood, and you put it on your feet. It worked. I mean, we went ice skating with these\nthings and had a wonderful time. So, we learned how \u2014 we learned how to swim, we\nlearned how to ice skate, we learned how \u2014 how to catch fish. In the wintertime we\ngot \u2014 we got sp \u2014 poles that were similar to our fishing poles, only heavier, and we\nput a \u2014a spear at the end of it, and you could spear fish through holes made in the\nice.

It just got dark, and the p \u2014 the parents of our friends said, you better go\nhome now. And now we got a couple of kilometers to walk in absolute pitch\ndarkness, imagining that there are wolves out there. So, you make a lantern. And\nit\u2019s very easy to make a lantern, Harry and I made so many lanterns, all made out\nof little pieces of wood, you \u2014 and you \u2014 you go to a glazier, they cut you a little \u2014 a\nlittle rectangle of glass, and you slip it in \u2014 on thr \u2014 three or four sides of this little\nthing.
