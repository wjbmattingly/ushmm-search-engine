        "Q: Will you tell me your full name please?",
        "A: My name is Agnes Grossman Aranyl.",
        "Q: Where and when were you born?",
        "A: I was born in Budapest, Hungary, May 2nd, 1936.",
        "Q: Will you tell us something about your family?",
        "A: I actually had a large extended family, but the nuclear family only con...consisted of my\nmother, my father and myself.",
        "Q: What did your father do?",
        "A: My father...I uh...he was in the textile business. He was a merchant of sorts. He really\ndidn't have a shop. He worked out of the house. I really never understood what he\nactually did, but he was selling uh cloth. He was...I guess in between a wholesaler and a\nretailer...a middle man, and he worked out of the home a lot. He was a salesman basically\nI think. And my mother, of course, those days she was a housewife when I was first born,\nbut of course when my father uh was drafted in the forced labor camp, she had to take\nover my father's business and then after the war subsequently she had a jewelry store and\nuh after the communists took over she went to work for the government.",
        "Q: What was your childhood, your early, very early childhood like before the Nazis?",
        "A: I have a very very few recollections of my early childhood. Actually I uh just remember\nflashbacks of my father who was...uh started to go away in 1939 and kept being drafted\nin forced labor camps and uh he begin...he began to disappear for three to six months and\nthen it became longer and longer. When they would draft him, it would take eight, nine\nmonths before he would return and then one time he was away for ten months, and finally\nin 1942, that was the last time he was drafted and he never came back. And uh\nremembering my mother who was a very bright woman and was able to take over and be\nthe head of the family...I don't mean just the nuclear family but head of the extended\nfamily. In fact she was instrumental saving my grandmother and myself and a lot of my\ncousins during uh the war and the Nazi occupation. I remember that the whole family\nused to gather at my house and we used to have Friday night and Saturday night dinners\nat my house and uh maybe because my grandmother was living with us, that so...we were\nthe gathering place for the whole family, and that's what happened. That's what I\nremember. I have pretty good memories of trips. We used to have a lake, Lake .\nWe used to go there in the summers and it was just a very...what I remember was a very\nuncomplicated, very nice life before my father left in 1942.",
        "Q: What do you remember about uh school, playmates, friends during that period?",
        "A: Actually I don't remember an awful lot. I remember that about 1940 we used to have\nquite an elegant apartment in the middle of the city and I remember that the Nazi party\ndecided to have their headquarters there, and uh we were evicted from the apartment and\nwe had a hard time finding another apartment being Jews and finally we found a less\nelegant but an OK apartment uh in a in another part of the city and I remember asking my\nmother to take the walls with us because I really was very happy in that particular\napartment, but we were evicted and we moved into a much smaller apartment and uh we\nwere there until uh the Nazis occupied Hungary.",
        "Q: OK. Tell us, if you would, you started talked about 1940. So let's go on. Let's...tell me, as\nthe war broke out indeed, uh in addition to the move, what happened to you, to your\nfamily?",
        "A: Well, in uh...as I remember and the dates may escape me...as I remember 1944 when all\nour troubles...",
        "Q: Let's let's back up a bit. Let's stick with, if we could...I don't want to jump to 1944 just\nyet. Let's let's talk a little about 1940, '41, and '42...the the early years. What, what was\nyour life like? What did you as a child do to ?",
        "A: I think the early years were comfortable years for me in spite of my father not being\nthere. I uh remember uh good times with my extended family. I remember vacations. I\nremember having a German governess whom I couldn't stand, whom I had to go out uh\nwalks with and the lady only spoke German to me and I had to answer her in German and\nI did not like her and I did not like the idea not being with my mother who had to work,\nbut having some other people taking care of me. But I don't remember anything\nhorrendous from these early years. I have to add that my mother had two brothers, and\nthey were also taken to forced labor camps and they never returned, but the early years\nwhen uh my father kept coming back and we had the extended family around, they were\nfairly happy times.",
        "Q: What did you for school? Let's talk a little about.....?",
        "A: In uh...I was four years old in 1940. I remember going to nursery school - '40, '41, and\nthen I started first grade in the Jewish school in Hungary in 1942 when I was six years\nold, and uh that was uh...I remember that being a good year. However the following year\nI remember in the second grade we only went to school for two, three months, and I\nthought that was terrific (laughter) because then the war broke out and we stopped going\nto school. But uh actually the early years in Hungary for the Hungarian Jews were fairly\npleasant, uh if I remember correctly as a child. I was also thinking being an only child\nand my cousins being only children, the families really could not, did not feel\ncomfortable having more children because they could see the handwriting on the wall,\nand my mother herself decided to have an abortion. She told me that later, because she\njust couldn't bring another Jewish child to this world, our crazy mixed-up world as it was.\nBut the early years as far as I was concerned were pleasant and they were alright. The\ndifficulties started when we had to start wearing the yellow star. That really, my self-\nesteem just plummeted and that was a very difficult period when a big yellow star was on\na young child with uh the inscription of Jude, which meant I guess in German, Jewish.\nAnd then that was already beginning of being marked as being different and less...oh\nwhat's the word I want to use...maybe not quite as competent as the other children were.",
        "Q: Go on and tell us about that. Tell us more about those years as things now began to be\nvery difficult.",
        "A: Yeah. Things are begi...began to unfold at this point. We started to wear the Jewish star\nand we also had to be at the apartment at a certain time. There was a curfew, but we still\nwere able to go out and go shopping and buy food with uh the Jewish star on. We had to\nwear the Jewish star all the time whenever we left the apartment. It was sewn on our\nclothing, and we were marked as being different from the mainstream and\npsychologically I'm sure I really suffered from this distinction. And then afterwards uh\nwe were told we had to leave our second apartment because we had to move to a house\nwhich was designated for Jews, and of course we left all our furniture at the apartment\nand just took a few belongings and moved over to a house which was designated to be a\nJewish house where Jews could live at that point. And uh we moved in with a sister of\nmy father's, my paternal aunt. There was my grandfather, my aunt and her two children in\none room, and my grandmother and my mother and I in another room. It was a two room\napartment, and we had to...we were there for a few months. I really can't remember how\nmany months it was, but we were there for a few months and that's when things were\nstarting to really get bad for us. First of all, we had very little food. When uh there were a\nlot of air raids we had to rush down to the cellar. At times we just didn't even bother to\ngo. My mother says if we have to go__, we'll just go, and that's when things really\nstarted to go downhill. I remember a couple of episodes which are quite painful while we\nwere living there. Well, my mother several times was rounded up and she had to march to\ndifferent factories where the Jewish women were collected and were sent to Auschwitz,\nand for one reason or another she was always able to come back, but as a child the fear\nwas just tremendous. If she's not going to come back, who's going to take care of me. I\nfelt very very very lonely at those days and very isolated, and I remember also the whole\nfamily once was rounded up uh downstairs and then we were...something happened. We\nwere able to go back to the apartment. Another painful episode was when my mother was\nrounded up and uh she decided that she's not going to go to the meeting place and she\nwas all dressed in heavy winter suits. In Hungary the winters were quite severe, and\nheavy boots and heavy winter clothes. She was all dressed up and she decided just to go\nbed with her clothing on, and uh uh she said whatever happens, happens. She's just not\ngoing to go and what happened, a German soldier came up to the apartment looking\naround, making sure that all the young women were downstairs and ready to go to camps,\nand my mother was covered up in the bed and I was with my mother and I lied to the\nsoldier. I told the soldier that my mother was sick and she could not go anywhere and she\ncouldn't move, and I told the soldier...as a child I learned survival skills very early on...I\ntold the soldier I have a doctor's certificate. If you just wait a minute I will get the\ndoctor's certificate for you. Six years old and uh...seven maybe. And uh what happened\nwas that uh...there was no doctor's certificate of course...I kept looking and looking and\nopening drawers and started to really search for the doctor's certificate and the German\nsoldier who could have been sixteen years as I was told, just left. He could have shot us.\nHe could have forced my mother to go, but by the stroke of luck he just left so I was told\nthat I saved my mother's life at that point, which was probably true. But I also lived with\nthat the rest of my life...that I am able to save people. And uh after that there were more\nroundups of Jews and the janitor one time who was a Christian woman my mother\nbefriended...befriended and of course she also kept happy with various pieces of jewelry,\ncame up to the apartment to tell us that now you just have to go. This 1s it. Everybody's\ngoing to be taken to the camps, and you just have to disappear. Well, we didn't know\nwhat to do at this point and somehow or other...this is where Wallenberg comes into the\npicture. Somehow or other we gota ___ they called. Somehow that afternoon my\nmother paid somebody off or somebody was willing to help. We got a to be able\nto go to a Swedish house, but of course by the time the arrived, mysteriously\narrived, we couldn't go out anymore with our Jewish stars because it was after the curfew\nand we knew the next morning everybody's going to be taken, rounded up and taken to\nthe camps from this particular Jewish house, so somehow they got this Christian woman\nwho after the war turned out to be Jewish herself, working at the underground...somehow\nthey got this Christian woman to come and take us to the Swedish house. We had the\nbut that of course didn't mean very much, but we were able to...this woman came\nand uh we took, we tore our yellow stars off and uh pretended we were Christians, and I\nremember to this day, I never forget that, that this young woman who came to get us and\nmy mother who was also fairly young at the time, and myself, without the Jewish star\nstarted walking. It seemed to me that we walked four or five hours. We we probably only\nwalked a half an hour to forty-five minutes, and I remember these two young women\nstarted, when the soldiers would come up, these two young women started flirting with\nthe German soldiers and I also remember them speaking German, not Hungarian, during\nthis journey. Of course we didn't have any belongings. My mother had a pocketbook. I\nhad nothing, and the trio was just walked while this the young women were flirt...flirting\nwith the soldiers and somehow we got to the Swedish house. We had a hard time getting\ninto the house, because the janitor did not want to get...let us in, but uh the women were\nable to convince the janitor in the Swedish house that we did have the documents and we\nbelonged to the Swedish house and we're going to be...we are entitled to go in. So what\nhappened they finally let us in. We arrived at the Swedish house and uh we went into an\napartment. It was full of people. I remember it was a two bedroom, two room or two\nbedroom apartment...I can't remember that...but we...people on all on people...1t was just\na horribly busy place. I...1f I remember correctly there were sixty people in this little\napartment with and of course they weren't very happy that three additional persons\narrived, but they did let us in and uh we made a little nitch in the corner somewhere and\nwe went to sleep at that point. It was a very...it...] remem...I can't remember whether we\nwere sleeping on mattresses or just on the floor but we were so tired and emotionally\nexhausted that it didn't matter. We had a safe, quote safe unquote place to put our heads\ndown. Somehow my mother...we stayed there for could be a month to six weeks in this\napartment, and it was pretty exciting because people were coming and going. We would\nlisten to...play wegie (ph) boards of what's coming. We would listen to the the American\nbroadcasts and uh somehow the rest of my family one by one found out that we were in\nthe Swedish house, my mother and I, and my cousins kept coming and since my mother\ntold them since she had the it belonged to the whole family, so she managed to\nhave all my cousins come and stay with us in the Swedish house and I think she paid\nsomebody off because my grandmother appeared on the scene who was at that time in her\nlate seventies, and somehow somebody brought my grandmother over. Since we had this\nuh __ she could come with us as well and uh she had the prime place in the apartment.\nShe would sleep in the bathtub because that was the only bed 1n this whole apartment,\nand since uh she was the oldest person, she was able to stay with us for a while. I need to\ntake a glass of water now.",
        "Q: We'll pause for a minute.\nPAUSE - TECHNICAL CONVERSATION",
        "Q: We're talking about your grandmother and the....",
        "A: Right. Right. We were in this...I was one of the Wallenberg kids. Because of Wallenberg,\nI was able to stay in this Swedish house. I was able to have the _\u2014__ as we all know\ntoday didn't mean anything, but in those days in Hungary it meant an awful lot because it\ndid get uh a person into a protected environment, a seemingly protected environment\nwhere people could just stay for a while and I...really and truly I know more about\nWallenberg since I've been in America. I had no idea who he was in Hungary, and uh but\nour happiness in the Swedish house did not last for an awful long time because uh finally\nthe Germans decided that they're going to invade the Swedish houses, so they came in\nafter a while and rounded us up and marched us to the ghetto. The march for me...",
        "Q: What was that...excuse me...what was it like? Can you tell us what that scene was like\nwhen the Nazis came?",
        "A: Very frightening, very...didn't understand what happened. Could not comprehend that we\nwere in a protected house...how can they round us up and invade us. It was a very very\nfrightening experience, but of course none of the Jews had any repence or probably even\nif they did have any they couldn't have fought off the German army, so we had to be\nobedient and do whatever we were told and survival depended on our obedience we felt\nat that point. So when they rounded us up to take us to the ghetto, they marched in and\nwe had to leave again all our belongings. We had ten minutes to pack our stuff and leave.\nI was uh...my mother and my grandmother, myself were getting ready to go on this march\nwhich again as a child it seemed to me was endless. I was in charge of the photo albums,\nto carry them to the ghetto and my mother carried of course whatever she could and my\ngrandmother could never carry anything. She had heart problems and she hardly could\nwalk. During this march they were shouting and shooting at Jews and we would just step\nover corpses like it was nothing. We just were psychologically numb and we were just\nwalking around, walking along and did what we were supposed to do and I I dropped a\nphoto albums and that's why I have very few photographs left before the war era and uh\nmy mother yelled at me not to stop and bend over and pick them up. I can, in my mind's\neye I can still see those pictures all over the street, and uh I just had to leave them and\nmarch on. We were marching on for a little while, and then my grandmother said during\nthe march...and this was really my most frightening experience in the war...my\ngrandmother said she couldn't walk anymore, so the whole transport, the whole group\nhad to stop. It was about two hundred people in this march, so everybody had to stop and\nthe German soldiers came and told us that they're going to shoot my grandmother. She's\ntoo old. She can't can't march. They're just going to shoot her to death, and we should all\ngo on, and my mother said she's not going to go. If they're going to shoot my\ngrandmother, let her let them shoot us all and we're just not going to leave an old lady.\nBut I remember the guns pointing at my grandmother and subsequently the guns pointing\nat me and my mother and they were ready to shoot us, but then my mother saw a child in\na stroller and we were so so...we we hardly have had any food at this point so we were all\nso thin that uh she picked up my grandmother and put her in the stroller and took the\nchild out of the stroller, put my grandmother in the stroller and we marched on. And we\ngot away with it. So what happened, when we had to go to the ghetto my grandmother\nwas wheeled in a stroller into the ghetto, and we all made it. But I I'll never forget that\nscene and I'm still very frightened of any kind of violence and any kinds of guns because\nof this experience. It's just...when a young child has a gun pointed at her...just something\nhappens and one never gets over this experience. But anyway, we were able to march into\nthe ghetto and everybody was able to...everybody survived at that point and uh we did\nmarch into the ghetto. Of course the circumstances were terrible. I had lice all over me,\nnot just in my hair. Body lice. We couldn't bathe. We couldn't eat and we were in the\nghetto for about two weeks before the Russians came in, and what I had heard about\nuh...the ghetto days are very hazy as far as I'm concerned because I kept fainting from the\nlack of food and my mother told me that I didn't have food for three, four days before the\nRussians came to liberate, so my recollection of the ghetto days are very hazy. I\nremember being in downstairs in a cellar sitting and not having any food and I remember\nother Jews eating chocolate while I was just starving and I had no food at all and nobody\never offered us some food, so it wasn't...1t was survival of the fittest. It wasn't really let's\nall survive, at that point and again I think because of Wallenberg...the ghetto was\nundermined and we were going to be blown up at any minute, but I think because of\nWallenberg we were saved and the Russians did...of course there were a lot of air raids\nand a lot of fighting, but we were so happy to hear the guns because we knew that\nliberation couldn't be too far off. And that's how I survived those years.",
        "Q: Tell us, tell us what happened at liberation...what was it like and what did you and your\nfamily do?",
        "A: What I remember of liberation...the Russian soldiers came into the bunker and uh\nsomehow a few hours later there was some muddied soup which they gave to all the\nsurvivors. We got some food at last and little by little we were able to...I mean after being\nreally singled out as Jews, able to be free and take our yellow stars off was just a very\nexhilarating, exciting and frightening moment at the same time. But little by little life got\nback. Of course we still didn't have food, but it was easier to obtain some foods later on\nand we were able to get back to our apartments and uh try to resume life, and life was\nvery difficult after...between 1948...'45 and 1956. I lived under the Russian oppression\nfor about ten years and again food was very scarce. It wasn't very fashionable to be Jews\nagain and in fact I had to change...in order to obtain a job...college was out of the\nquestion for me because I came from a capitalistic society and uh it was really out of the\nquestion for me. I had to change my name. I did attend a Jewish high school, Jewish\nschool and Jewish high school and uh I was singled out again as a Jew. I had to change\nmy name from Grossman to , which was a Hungarian name so I wouldn't be\nsingled out as a Jew and I remember having very little food in those years as well. Food\nwas always a problem. (Laughter) And the survival...we really didn't have the...what we\nreally needed. We had a very...we had an apartment. Sometimes we didn't have fuel. We\ndidn't have food. I remember it was sin to have any napoleons (ph), uh gold coins, so we\nwere so afraid of deportation that my mother flushed a couple gold coins down on the\ntoilet because we were so afraid that if they, if we're going to be found out we're going to\nhave to go outside of the city and...uh I'm struggling for the wor...word...I don't know\nwhat happened with capitalists during the communist uh regime. They were forced to\nleave their apartments and they got a sub-standard apartment in the country and they had\nto survive the best they could there. So we didn't want that to happen to us and that's why\nwe flushed those gold coins down the toilet. I'll never forget that. And uh again life was\nvery difficult, being singled out as Jews, so when the revolution came about in 1956, we\nwere very happy to be able to leave Hungary.\nPAUSE - TECHNICAL CONVERSATION",
        "Q: Tell us about that escape.",
        "A: Since I uh lived with the idea that my father would have been alive if my mother did not\nwant to stay with her family but left for America in 1938, I subconsciously knew that\nwhen the opportunity rises, I'd best leave Hungary. So in 1956 during the revolution, I\nwas then twenty years old and I had a Hungarian fiance who was also a survivor. He was\nhidden during uh the war years. I uh...it was really my decision to leave the country and\nescape. Of course 1956...I experienced another war during the revolution and again we\nwere sitting in the bunker. We were sitting in the cellar and uh the Russian tanks came in\nand there were a lot of shooting, a lot of killing. Again we would step over corpses. I\nmean it was psychologically numbing again. Survival was the main thing during those\nrevolutionary years. My husband then was a college student in Hungary so he partook in\nsome of the demonstrations and uh we decided after, when the Russians came back, we\nwere best to escape Hungary. Of course by then we both were survivors. We knew how\nto survive, so we took a train to as close to the border as possible when we decided to\nleave and uh we stayed with some peasants near the border until we found a guide who\ncould led us over the border. The borders were watched by Hungarian and Russian\nsoldiers and uh it was very difficult to escape. Again we had to...oh we found this...I'm\ngetting a little fuzzy here. The memories are just rushing back into my head. We escaped\nwith my cousin and her husband and two small children ages three and five. And uh what\nhappened was that the kids were scared and crying, so before when we paid off the\nguards in order to get across the border, we had to get some rum and had to give it to the\nkids so the kids were drunk and fell asleep and my husband carried uh one kid and uh the\nkid's father carried another kid. We had to walk in the snow. The winter's are very\ndifficult and heavy in Hungary and we dark winter clothing on and we had to walk in this\ndark clothing in the snow at night to be inconspicuous. When the Russian or the\nHungarian soldiers were shooting at us, we had to lie down in the snow with our dark\nwinter clothing in order not to be seen. We walked across...we had to walk a good twenty\nmiles until we got to the border and the walk again was very very frightening. It was like\ndeja vue. What happened as we were marching uh to escape...to go to the ghetto, because\nthey were shooting us at us from watch towers and we had to know where to walk, where\nthe border wasn't undermined. Finally we got to a creek which led us to Austria and this\nis where I just knew I'll never make it. I was just ready to give up and die. I was so tired\nafter...and scared...after walking for several hours at night in the snow that I was just\nready to give up. There was a log between uh Austria and Hungary and people walked\nacross the log but I wasn't coordinated enough and I wasn't...I was so tired I knew I'll\nnever make it. So finally people told me to sit on that log and I was able to just crawl\nover to Austria on that log, and I was very fortunate because we made it over. A lot of\npeople were taken back to Budapest. They could not escape, but we were again very\nfortunate to be able to manage to get out.",
        "Q: Indeed. What did you do when you got to Austria?",
        "A: Well, in Austria we stayed in uh...subsequently we went to Salzburg and a Jewish\norganization was very good. They put us 1n a hotel, the Pathenon really, and we stayed in\nthe Pathenon for two, three weeks, trying to come to America. We were planning to go to\nAustralia, but there was a real iron curtain in Hungary. We had no news from the west at\nall, and we thought Australia would be wonderful because we would be as far from\nEurope as we could be, so we decided to go to Australia. But my husband had a relative\nwho sent us a telegram from France...don't go to Australia. Go to America. Life is good\nthere. So OK. We decided to go to America. This is how the decision was made. And uh\nhowever we were applying to come to America but the American Jews, the HIAS\norganization didn't want us because they didn't want to be responsible for us and they\nturned us down. Finally we were able to find an organization which brought over three\nthousand refugees regardless of religion, and this was the Tolstoy (ph), the granddaughter\nof Leo Tolstoy had an organization bringing refugees over and uh by the Tolstoy\norganizations we were able to come to America. And again of course we felt very\nalienated and not belonging and it usually takes an immigrant five years to really get into\nthe mainstream, to learn the language, to learn the culture, to learn the customs, so again\nwe had to forget and relearn new ways of relating to people and new...uh how to live ina\nnew land.",
        "Q: What was your adjustment to America like?",
        "A: I had a very difficult time. I didn't expect all this difficulty, but I...thinking back I think I\nwas pretty depressed. I felt alienated. I didn't speak the language. I didn't have any skills\nthen. I didn't have any education then. I used to...uh the early years were very difficult.\n[...after arriving...upon arriving to America we were sent to Camp Kilmer (ph), and at\nCamp Kilmer they were sending uh people all over the country and we were told that we\nshould go to Norfolk, Virginia because they, the Jewish community wanted some\nrefugees there and we spoke some English. It will be a good place for us. So we moved to\nNo...so we said fine. We'll go anywhere. We didn't care. We didn't know anything about\nanything, so we went to Norfolk which is a southern town, not really wonderful for an\nimmigrant, but uh the reason we went there because they told my husband that he could\nfinish his schooling. He was an architectural student. We moved to Norfolk. There were\nno school of architecture. So we had to move on. We moved to Raleigh, North Carolina,\nwhere he did finally finish his schooling and I was working at Woolworth's in Raleigh,\nNorth Carolina, really not speaking English very well and not being able to...I really\nwasn't employable. And so the early years were very difficult for me, and uh learning a\nlanguage, learning a culture...it takes a good five years for a person to really feel at home\nin a new country.",
        "Q: Thank you. Is there anything you want to add?",
        "A: I don't know. I think when I go home I'll remember a thousand other things to add, but\nright now I think this is my story.",
        "Q: What do you think the effect of the Holocaust has been?",
        "A: This is a difficult question to answer. I've been struggling with it for fifty years.\n(Laughter) My self-esteem was non-existent. I had to really work on developing some\nsense of worth. I think that sense of worth...I think that's what's the...I felt less than equal\nfor years because of the Holocaust, because of escaping of Hungary. I had a very very...I\nthink the biggest problem is that you just don't feel quite as good as the other guy. I think\nthat was one of the major problems. Until you really feel good about yourself and who\nyou are and you can accept who you are, it's just very difficult. Self-esteem is the name of\nthe game I think. And that was really just can't and it just negated who I was, what I was\nall about. I was very ashamed of who I was. I didn't feel good about myself...for a long\ntime.",
        "Q: Tell us what you're doing now.",
        "A: Well, I became...in order to help myself to feel worthwhile I became a psycho-therapist\nand working with other people, helping them to realize who they are, what they are all\nabout and help them to develop a healthier self-esteem.",

I really never understood what he\nactually did, but he was selling uh cloth. He was...I guess in between a wholesaler and a\nretailer...a middle man, and he worked out of the home a lot. He was a salesman basically\nI think. And my mother, of course, those days she was a housewife when I was first born,\nbut of course when my father uh was drafted in the forced labor camp, she had to take\nover my father's business and then after the war subsequently she had a jewelry store and\nuh after the communists took over she went to work for the government.",
        "A: I have a very very few recollections of my early childhood. Actually I uh just remember\nflashbacks of my father who was...uh started to go away in 1939 and kept being drafted\nin forced labor camps and uh he begin...he began to disappear for three to six months and\nthen it became longer and longer. When they would draft him, it would take eight, nine\nmonths before he would return and then one time he was away for ten months, and finally\nin 1942, that was the last time he was drafted and he never came back. And uh\nremembering my mother who was a very bright woman and was able to take over and be\nthe head of the family...I don't mean just the nuclear family but head of the extended\nfamily. In fact she was instrumental saving my grandmother and myself and a lot of my\ncousins during uh the war and the Nazi occupation. I remember that the whole family\nused to gather at my house and we used to have Friday night and Saturday night dinners\nat my house and uh maybe because my grandmother was living with us, that so...we were\nthe gathering place for the whole family, and that's what happened. That's what I\nremember. I have pretty good memories of trips. We used to have a lake, Lake .\nWe used to go there in the summers and it was just a very...what I remember was a very\nuncomplicated, very nice life before my father left in 1942.",
        "A: Actually I don't remember an awful lot. I remember that about 1940 we used to have\nquite an elegant apartment in the middle of the city and I remember that the Nazi party\ndecided to have their headquarters there, and uh we were evicted from the apartment and\nwe had a hard time finding another apartment being Jews and finally we found a less\nelegant but an OK apartment uh in a in another part of the city and I remember asking my\nmother to take the walls with us because I really was very happy in that particular\napartment, but we were evicted and we moved into a much smaller apartment and uh we\nwere there until uh the Nazis occupied Hungary.",
        "A: Well, in uh...as I remember and the dates may escape me...as I remember 1944 when all\nour troubles...",
        "A: I think the early years were comfortable years for me in spite of my father not being\nthere. I uh remember uh good times with my extended family. I remember vacations. I\nremember having a German governess whom I couldn't stand, whom I had to go out uh\nwalks with and the lady only spoke German to me and I had to answer her in German and\nI did not like her and I did not like the idea not being with my mother who had to work,\nbut having some other people taking care of me. But I don't remember anything\nhorrendous from these early years. I have to add that my mother had two brothers, and\nthey were also taken to forced labor camps and they never returned, but the early years\nwhen uh my father kept coming back and we had the extended family around, they were\nfairly happy times.",
        "A: In uh...I was four years old in 1940. I remember going to nursery school - '40, '41, and\nthen I started first grade in the Jewish school in Hungary in 1942 when I was six years\nold, and uh that was uh...I remember that being a good year. However the following year\nI remember in the second grade we only went to school for two, three months, and I\nthought that was terrific (laughter) because then the war broke out and we stopped going\nto school. But uh actually the early years in Hungary for the Hungarian Jews were fairly\npleasant, uh if I remember correctly as a child. I was also thinking being an only child\nand my cousins being only children, the families really could not, did not feel\ncomfortable having more children because they could see the handwriting on the wall,\nand my mother herself decided to have an abortion. She told me that later, because she\njust couldn't bring another Jewish child to this world, our crazy mixed-up world as it was.\nBut the early years as far as I was concerned were pleasant and they were alright. The\ndifficulties started when we had to start wearing the yellow star. That really, my self-\nesteem just plummeted and that was a very difficult period when a big yellow star was on\na young child with uh the inscription of Jude, which meant I guess in German, Jewish.\nAnd then that was already beginning of being marked as being different and less...oh\nwhat's the word I want to use...maybe not quite as competent as the other children were.",
        "A: Yeah. Things are begi...began to unfold at this point. We started to wear the Jewish star\nand we also had to be at the apartment at a certain time. There was a curfew, but we still\nwere able to go out and go shopping and buy food with uh the Jewish star on. We had to\nwear the Jewish star all the time whenever we left the apartment. It was sewn on our\nclothing, and we were marked as being different from the mainstream and\npsychologically I'm sure I really suffered from this distinction. And then afterwards uh\nwe were told we had to leave our second apartment because we had to move to a house\nwhich was designated for Jews, and of course we left all our furniture at the apartment\nand just took a few belongings and moved over to a house which was designated to be a\nJewish house where Jews could live at that point. And uh we moved in with a sister of\nmy father's, my paternal aunt. There was my grandfather, my aunt and her two children in\none room, and my grandmother and my mother and I in another room. It was a two room\napartment, and we had to...we were there for a few months. I really can't remember how\nmany months it was, but we were there for a few months and that's when things were\nstarting to really get bad for us. First of all, we had very little food. When uh there were a\nlot of air raids we had to rush down to the cellar. At times we just didn't even bother to\ngo. My mother says if we have to go__, we'll just go, and that's when things really\nstarted to go downhill. I remember a couple of episodes which are quite painful while we\nwere living there. Well, my mother several times was rounded up and she had to march to\ndifferent factories where the Jewish women were collected and were sent to Auschwitz,\nand for one reason or another she was always able to come back, but as a child the fear\nwas just tremendous. If she's not going to come back, who's going to take care of me. I\nfelt very very very lonely at those days and very isolated, and I remember also the whole\nfamily once was rounded up uh downstairs and then we were...something happened. We\nwere able to go back to the apartment. Another painful episode was when my mother was\nrounded up and uh she decided that she's not going to go to the meeting place and she\nwas all dressed in heavy winter suits. In Hungary the winters were quite severe, and\nheavy boots and heavy winter clothes. She was all dressed up and she decided just to go\nbed with her clothing on, and uh uh she said whatever happens, happens. She's just not\ngoing to go and what happened, a German soldier came up to the apartment looking\naround, making sure that all the young women were downstairs and ready to go to camps,\nand my mother was covered up in the bed and I was with my mother and I lied to the\nsoldier. I told the soldier that my mother was sick and she could not go anywhere and she\ncouldn't move, and I told the soldier...as a child I learned survival skills very early on...I\ntold the soldier I have a doctor's certificate. If you just wait a minute I will get the\ndoctor's certificate for you. Six years old and uh...seven maybe. And uh what happened\nwas that uh...there was no doctor's certificate of course...I kept looking and looking and\nopening drawers and started to really search for the doctor's certificate and the German\nsoldier who could have been sixteen years as I was told, just left. He could have shot us.\nHe could have forced my mother to go, but by the stroke of luck he just left so I was told\nthat I saved my mother's life at that point, which was probably true. But I also lived with\nthat the rest of my life...that I am able to save people. And uh after that there were more\nroundups of Jews and the janitor one time who was a Christian woman my mother\nbefriended...befriended and of course she also kept happy with various pieces of jewelry,\ncame up to the apartment to tell us that now you just have to go. This 1s it. Everybody's\ngoing to be taken to the camps, and you just have to disappear. Well, we didn't know\nwhat to do at this point and somehow or other...this is where Wallenberg comes into the\npicture. Somehow or other we gota ___ they called. Somehow that afternoon my\nmother paid somebody off or somebody was willing to help. We got a to be able\nto go to a Swedish house, but of course by the time the arrived, mysteriously\narrived, we couldn't go out anymore with our Jewish stars because it was after the curfew\nand we knew the next morning everybody's going to be taken, rounded up and taken to\nthe camps from this particular Jewish house, so somehow they got this Christian woman\nwho after the war turned out to be Jewish herself, working at the underground...somehow\nthey got this Christian woman to come and take us to the Swedish house. We had the\nbut that of course didn't mean very much, but we were able to...this woman came\nand uh we took, we tore our yellow stars off and uh pretended we were Christians, and I\nremember to this day, I never forget that, that this young woman who came to get us and\nmy mother who was also fairly young at the time, and myself, without the Jewish star\nstarted walking. It seemed to me that we walked four or five hours. We we probably only\nwalked a half an hour to forty-five minutes, and I remember these two young women\nstarted, when the soldiers would come up, these two young women started flirting with\nthe German soldiers and I also remember them speaking German, not Hungarian, during\nthis journey. Of course we didn't have any belongings. My mother had a pocketbook. I\nhad nothing, and the trio was just walked while this the young women were flirt...flirting\nwith the soldiers and somehow we got to the Swedish house. We had a hard time getting\ninto the house, because the janitor did not want to get...let us in, but uh the women were\nable to convince the janitor in the Swedish house that we did have the documents and we\nbelonged to the Swedish house and we're going to be...we are entitled to go in. So what\nhappened they finally let us in. We arrived at the Swedish house and uh we went into an\napartment. It was full of people. I remember it was a two bedroom, two room or two\nbedroom apartment...I can't remember that...but we...people on all on people...1t was just\na horribly busy place. I...1f I remember correctly there were sixty people in this little\napartment with and of course they weren't very happy that three additional persons\narrived, but they did let us in and uh we made a little nitch in the corner somewhere and\nwe went to sleep at that point. It was a very...it...] remem...I can't remember whether we\nwere sleeping on mattresses or just on the floor but we were so tired and emotionally\nexhausted that it didn't matter. We had a safe, quote safe unquote place to put our heads\ndown. Somehow my mother...we stayed there for could be a month to six weeks in this\napartment, and it was pretty exciting because people were coming and going. We would\nlisten to...play wegie (ph) boards of what's coming. We would listen to the the American\nbroadcasts and uh somehow the rest of my family one by one found out that we were in\nthe Swedish house, my mother and I, and my cousins kept coming and since my mother\ntold them since she had the it belonged to the whole family, so she managed to\nhave all my cousins come and stay with us in the Swedish house and I think she paid\nsomebody off because my grandmother appeared on the scene who was at that time in her\nlate seventies, and somehow somebody brought my grandmother over. Since we had this\nuh __ she could come with us as well and uh she had the prime place in the apartment.\nShe would sleep in the bathtub because that was the only bed 1n this whole apartment,\nand since uh she was the oldest person, she was able to stay with us for a while. I need to\ntake a glass of water now.\nPAUSE - TECHNICAL CONVERSATION",
        "A: Right. Right. We were in this...I was one of the Wallenberg kids. Because of Wallenberg,\nI was able to stay in this Swedish house. I was able to have the _\u2014__ as we all know\ntoday didn't mean anything, but in those days in Hungary it meant an awful lot because it\ndid get uh a person into a protected environment, a seemingly protected environment\nwhere people could just stay for a while and I...really and truly I know more about\nWallenberg since I've been in America. I had no idea who he was in Hungary, and uh but\nour happiness in the Swedish house did not last for an awful long time because uh finally\nthe Germans decided that they're going to invade the Swedish houses, so they came in\nafter a while and rounded us up and marched us to the ghetto. The march for me...",
        "A: Very frightening, very...didn't understand what happened. Could not comprehend that we\nwere in a protected house...how can they round us up and invade us. It was a very very\nfrightening experience, but of course none of the Jews had any repence or probably even\nif they did have any they couldn't have fought off the German army, so we had to be\nobedient and do whatever we were told and survival depended on our obedience we felt\nat that point. So when they rounded us up to take us to the ghetto, they marched in and\nwe had to leave again all our belongings. We had ten minutes to pack our stuff and leave.\nI was uh...my mother and my grandmother, myself were getting ready to go on this march\nwhich again as a child it seemed to me was endless. I was in charge of the photo albums,\nto carry them to the ghetto and my mother carried of course whatever she could and my\ngrandmother could never carry anything. She had heart problems and she hardly could\nwalk. During this march they were shouting and shooting at Jews and we would just step\nover corpses like it was nothing. We just were psychologically numb and we were just\nwalking around, walking along and did what we were supposed to do and I I dropped a\nphoto albums and that's why I have very few photographs left before the war era and uh\nmy mother yelled at me not to stop and bend over and pick them up. I can, in my mind's\neye I can still see those pictures all over the street, and uh I just had to leave them and\nmarch on. We were marching on for a little while, and then my grandmother said during\nthe march...and this was really my most frightening experience in the war...my\ngrandmother said she couldn't walk anymore, so the whole transport, the whole group\nhad to stop. It was about two hundred people in this march, so everybody had to stop and\nthe German soldiers came and told us that they're going to shoot my grandmother. She's\ntoo old. She can't can't march. They're just going to shoot her to death, and we should all\ngo on, and my mother said she's not going to go. If they're going to shoot my\ngrandmother, let her let them shoot us all and we're just not going to leave an old lady.\nBut I remember the guns pointing at my grandmother and subsequently the guns pointing\nat me and my mother and they were ready to shoot us, but then my mother saw a child in\na stroller and we were so so...we we hardly have had any food at this point so we were all\nso thin that uh she picked up my grandmother and put her in the stroller and took the\nchild out of the stroller, put my grandmother in the stroller and we marched on. And we\ngot away with it. So what happened, when we had to go to the ghetto my grandmother\nwas wheeled in a stroller into the ghetto, and we all made it. But I I'll never forget that\nscene and I'm still very frightened of any kind of violence and any kinds of guns because\nof this experience. It's just...when a young child has a gun pointed at her...just something\nhappens and one never gets over this experience. But anyway, we were able to march into\nthe ghetto and everybody was able to...everybody survived at that point and uh we did\nmarch into the ghetto. Of course the circumstances were terrible. I had lice all over me,\nnot just in my hair. Body lice. We couldn't bathe. We couldn't eat and we were in the\nghetto for about two weeks before the Russians came in, and what I had heard about\nuh...the ghetto days are very hazy as far as I'm concerned because I kept fainting from the\nlack of food and my mother told me that I didn't have food for three, four days before the\nRussians came to liberate, so my recollection of the ghetto days are very hazy. I\nremember being in downstairs in a cellar sitting and not having any food and I remember\nother Jews eating chocolate while I was just starving and I had no food at all and nobody\never offered us some food, so it wasn't...1t was survival of the fittest. It wasn't really let's\nall survive, at that point and again I think because of Wallenberg...the ghetto was\nundermined and we were going to be blown up at any minute, but I think because of\nWallenberg we were saved and the Russians did...of course there were a lot of air raids\nand a lot of fighting, but we were so happy to hear the guns because we knew that\nliberation couldn't be too far off. And that's how I survived those years.",
        "A: What I remember of liberation...the Russian soldiers came into the bunker and uh\nsomehow a few hours later there was some muddied soup which they gave to all the\nsurvivors. We got some food at last and little by little we were able to...I mean after being\nreally singled out as Jews, able to be free and take our yellow stars off was just a very\nexhilarating, exciting and frightening moment at the same time. But little by little life got\nback. Of course we still didn't have food, but it was easier to obtain some foods later on\nand we were able to get back to our apartments and uh try to resume life, and life was\nvery difficult after...between 1948...'45 and 1956. I lived under the Russian oppression\nfor about ten years and again food was very scarce. It wasn't very fashionable to be Jews\nagain and in fact I had to change...in order to obtain a job...college was out of the\nquestion for me because I came from a capitalistic society and uh it was really out of the\nquestion for me. I had to change my name. I did attend a Jewish high school, Jewish\nschool and Jewish high school and uh I was singled out again as a Jew. I had to change\nmy name from Grossman to , which was a Hungarian name so I wouldn't be\nsingled out as a Jew and I remember having very little food in those years as well. Food\nwas always a problem. (Laughter) And the survival...we really didn't have the...what we\nreally needed. We had a very...we had an apartment. Sometimes we didn't have fuel. We\ndidn't have food. I remember it was sin to have any napoleons (ph), uh gold coins, so we\nwere so afraid of deportation that my mother flushed a couple gold coins down on the\ntoilet because we were so afraid that if they, if we're going to be found out we're going to\nhave to go outside of the city and...uh I'm struggling for the wor...word...I don't know\nwhat happened with capitalists during the communist uh regime. They were forced to\nleave their apartments and they got a sub-standard apartment in the country and they had\nto survive the best they could there. So we didn't want that to happen to us and that's why\nwe flushed those gold coins down the toilet. I'll never forget that. And uh again life was\nvery difficult, being singled out as Jews, so when the revolution came about in 1956, we\nwere very happy to be able to leave Hungary.\nPAUSE - TECHNICAL CONVERSATION",
        "A: Since I uh lived with the idea that my father would have been alive if my mother did not\nwant to stay with her family but left for America in 1938, I subconsciously knew that\nwhen the opportunity rises, I'd best leave Hungary. So in 1956 during the revolution, I\nwas then twenty years old and I had a Hungarian fiance who was also a survivor. He was\nhidden during uh the war years. I uh...it was really my decision to leave the country and\nescape. Of course 1956...I experienced another war during the revolution and again we\nwere sitting in the bunker. We were sitting in the cellar and uh the Russian tanks came in\nand there were a lot of shooting, a lot of killing. Again we would step over corpses. I\nmean it was psychologically numbing again. Survival was the main thing during those\nrevolutionary years. My husband then was a college student in Hungary so he partook in\nsome of the demonstrations and uh we decided after, when the Russians came back, we\nwere best to escape Hungary. Of course by then we both were survivors. We knew how\nto survive, so we took a train to as close to the border as possible when we decided to\nleave and uh we stayed with some peasants near the border until we found a guide who\ncould led us over the border. The borders were watched by Hungarian and Russian\nsoldiers and uh it was very difficult to escape. Again we had to...oh we found this...I'm\ngetting a little fuzzy here. The memories are just rushing back into my head. We escaped\nwith my cousin and her husband and two small children ages three and five. And uh what\nhappened was that the kids were scared and crying, so before when we paid off the\nguards in order to get across the border, we had to get some rum and had to give it to the\nkids so the kids were drunk and fell asleep and my husband carried uh one kid and uh the\nkid's father carried another kid. We had to walk in the snow. The winter's are very\ndifficult and heavy in Hungary and we dark winter clothing on and we had to walk in this\ndark clothing in the snow at night to be inconspicuous. When the Russian or the\nHungarian soldiers were shooting at us, we had to lie down in the snow with our dark\nwinter clothing in order not to be seen. We walked across...we had to walk a good twenty\nmiles until we got to the border and the walk again was very very frightening. It was like\ndeja vue. What happened as we were marching uh to escape...to go to the ghetto, because\nthey were shooting us at us from watch towers and we had to know where to walk, where\nthe border wasn't undermined. Finally we got to a creek which led us to Austria and this\nis where I just knew I'll never make it. I was just ready to give up and die. I was so tired\nafter...and scared...after walking for several hours at night in the snow that I was just\nready to give up. There was a log between uh Austria and Hungary and people walked\nacross the log but I wasn't coordinated enough and I wasn't...I was so tired I knew I'll\nnever make it. So finally people told me to sit on that log and I was able to just crawl\nover to Austria on that log, and I was very fortunate because we made it over. A lot of\npeople were taken back to Budapest. They could not escape, but we were again very\nfortunate to be able to manage to get out.",
        "A: Well, in Austria we stayed in uh...subsequently we went to Salzburg and a Jewish\norganization was very good. They put us 1n a hotel, the Pathenon really, and we stayed in\nthe Pathenon for two, three weeks, trying to come to America. We were planning to go to\nAustralia, but there was a real iron curtain in Hungary. We had no news from the west at\nall, and we thought Australia would be wonderful because we would be as far from\nEurope as we could be, so we decided to go to Australia. But my husband had a relative\nwho sent us a telegram from France...don't go to Australia. Go to America. Life is good\nthere. So OK. We decided to go to America. This is how the decision was made. And uh\nhowever we were applying to come to America but the American Jews, the HIAS\norganization didn't want us because they didn't want to be responsible for us and they\nturned us down. Finally we were able to find an organization which brought over three\nthousand refugees regardless of religion, and this was the Tolstoy (ph), the granddaughter\nof Leo Tolstoy had an organization bringing refugees over and uh by the Tolstoy\norganizations we were able to come to America. And again of course we felt very\nalienated and not belonging and it usually takes an immigrant five years to really get into\nthe mainstream, to learn the language, to learn the culture, to learn the customs, so again\nwe had to forget and relearn new ways of relating to people and new...uh how to live ina\nnew land.",
        "A: I had a very difficult time. I didn't expect all this difficulty, but I...thinking back I think I\nwas pretty depressed. I felt alienated. I didn't speak the language. I didn't have any skills\nthen. I didn't have any education then. I used to...uh the early years were very difficult.\n[...after arriving...upon arriving to America we were sent to Camp Kilmer (ph), and at\nCamp Kilmer they were sending uh people all over the country and we were told that we\nshould go to Norfolk, Virginia because they, the Jewish community wanted some\nrefugees there and we spoke some English. It will be a good place for us. So we moved to\nNo...so we said fine. We'll go anywhere. We didn't care. We didn't know anything about\nanything, so we went to Norfolk which is a southern town, not really wonderful for an\nimmigrant, but uh the reason we went there because they told my husband that he could\nfinish his schooling. He was an architectural student. We moved to Norfolk. There were\nno school of architecture. So we had to move on. We moved to Raleigh, North Carolina,\nwhere he did finally finish his schooling and I was working at Woolworth's in Raleigh,\nNorth Carolina, really not speaking English very well and not being able to...I really\nwasn't employable. And so the early years were very difficult for me, and uh learning a\nlanguage, learning a culture...it takes a good five years for a person to really feel at home\nin a new country.",
        "A: I don't know. I think when I go home I'll remember a thousand other things to add, but\nright now I think this is my story.",
        "A: This is a difficult question to answer. I've been struggling with it for fifty years.\n(Laughter) My self-esteem was non-existent. I had to really work on developing some\nsense of worth. I think that sense of worth...I think that's what's the...I felt less than equal\nfor years because of the Holocaust, because of escaping of Hungary. I had a very very...I\nthink the biggest problem is that you just don't feel quite as good as the other guy. I think\nthat was one of the major problems. Until you really feel good about yourself and who\nyou are and you can accept who you are, it's just very difficult. Self-esteem is the name of\nthe game I think. And that was really just can't and it just negated who I was, what I was\nall about. I was very ashamed of who I was. I didn't feel good about myself...for a long\ntime.",
        "A: Well, I became...in order to help myself to feel worthwhile I became a psycho-therapist\nand working with other people, helping them to realize who they are, what they are all\nabout and help them to develop a healthier self-esteem.\nEND OF INTERVIEW\n"
