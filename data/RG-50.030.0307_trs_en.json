        "Q: Can you tell us your name and where you were born?",
        "A: My name is and they used to call us Willy or Wilek. Loew was L-O-\nW, but when I came to the United States it was changed to L-O-E-W. So the name\nactually here in the United States is William Loew, but my friends back at home they\nremember me as Wilek. I was born in Lwow, Lemberg. Lemberg is basically a German\nname for Louve and my parents came from probably Austria. I'm not quite sure, but from\nAustria and we settled down in Lwow. That was Galicia at the time and also known as a\nAustria Hungarian empire. The time in the when I was born I had\nbasically a nice family, a wonderful family. Let me speak about my brothers. I had an\nolder brother we used to call Eli. The oldest one was Abe. We had a very close family.\nMy mother was very -- was a housewife but also dealing in business. Our business was\nwe had a brewery a mead brewery which is a honey wine. The business was quite\nprosperous. For one thing, our business has been derived from previous generations. We\nstarted, but not my father but my grandfather and my uncles they started in 1870. As a\nmatter of fact I still have one of the labels of our original wines which is a honey wine.\nOur family was approximately 80 persons strong counting my uncles, my grandfathers\nfrom either side, my mother's and my father's side. We were more numerous on my\nfather's side than on my mother's side. My mother's maiden name was Margulies and\nsome of her brothers went to Palestine. At that time in 1932, 1933 and the remainder\nstayed there in at that time. We stayed and we tried to continue our\nbusiness. My father died when I was four years old. He died probably 1929 so my mother\nactually took over the business. I don't think she was a good business woman from what I\nrecall. The business continued. We had my oldest brother could not get into a university\nin because there was a quota for the Jewish students, so he had to move\nout from Louve to Warsaw. So, he studied there. This was expensive to study in Warsaw\nbecause the money that we had from the business was not that prosperous. I'm not quite\nsure the reason for it but I think that my mother wasn't as aggressive in the business as\nshe should be. So, if I recall sometime in 1934 to 1934 before we folded our business and\nwe were no longer in the business of honey wine. But my uncles they continued to be in\nbusiness. At that time in that previous years, we used to export our wine to different areas\nof Poland that we know and also to other countries. The Jewish life in Louve was the best\nthat can be said back in '37 '38 from what I can recall was lukewarm. It wasn't very bad.\nIt wasn't very good. We did have our quotas going to school as a matter of fact when I\nwent for my exam to enter the gymnasium even though the gymnasium was ten blocks\naway from me, I couldn't get in because I had a quota. I passed I understand my entry\nexam, but I couldn't get in. That was back in 1938. So, in order to continue my studies I\nhad to move on somewhere else and I had to go to another gymnasium back on Louve on\nStreet. It was known as the Jewish gymnasium. Going back to '38, '38\nwas a fairly peaceful years for our family but it was a hardship because we couldn't meet\nthe loans that my father apparently incurred. So, things were difficult. My oldest brother\nAbe who was in Warsaw, he finished his master's degree and he came back home and he\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

Eli who was two years older than I was, he was more enterprising but for his\nown good. He was not part of -- he would try to help stabilize the family but we used to\nlove each other and we used to fight each other and we used to do things that 13, 14 year\nold boys used to do. Abe on the other hand was much older that we were. He was older\nthan I by ten years so he was more a Serious person and he had very little in common\nwith us other than try to take over the father figure, which he didn't succeed in many\nways. In 1938, in 1939 things were getting worse in terms of what I recall there were\nquite a few refugees who would be coming from the western part of Poland especially\nthose Jews who were exiled from Germany who came from Poland and somehow they\ndidn't stay long enough in the western part of Poland and they kept on moving and settled\ndown in our place in Louve. This was in '39 and it wasn't really that bad yet, yet they\ncame the German Jews in thousands and settled down in Poland.",
        "Q: What year were you born?",
        "A: I was born in 1925, October 29, 1925.",
        "Q: Did you work in the winery?",
        "A: No, I did not. We had people who used to take care of that, but as I mentioned before our\nenterprise, or the winery, wasn't that much as busy I think in 1934 or 1935 so I didn't\nwork. The only time I went to the cellar or to the winery 1s to see the process of making\nwine, how they were stirring the wine and to smell the wonderful smell that still persists\nin the winemakers. They were there, of course, I recall we had a winery that took space a\nwhole block because that whole block used to belong to us. Underneath in the cellar\nunder the whole block was the whole winery. I recall that barrels where the wine was\nstored for aging was stacked four or five barrels stacked high. They were smaller. They\nwere not the 55 gallon barrels which is the common size here in the United States but I\nrecall they were maybe 35 gallons. This was the standard barrel at that time to age honey\nwine. I don't recall how long they were aging but that smell and that wonderful aroma\ncontributed from the honey it was still there. But in 1934 and 1935 we were all gone and\nI don't know who took over our business. It could have been that my uncles had took it\nover.",
        "Q: You lost your father when you were four years old?",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Do you remember him?",
        "A: Very little. There's only one event that I recall about my father when I was four years old.\nHe had a beautiful flag, eight or nine rooms and each room was designated for a certain\npurpose. Beside the bedroom and the dining room we had what we used to call salon\nwhich is a large area and we had a special reception place for certain events or for our\nfriends of the family. So, we had a fairly large flag. My grandfather who actually brought\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview. The recording is the primary source document, not this transcript.

That was my family, the\nimmediate family. Our immediate family consisted of our three brothers, my mother, my\naunt Miriam and my grandfather. My grandfather brought me up. He was in a way a\nphilosopher on his own. He was a self taught mathematician. He was a true philosopher.\nNot only would he be reading philosophy books but he also was a scholar in his own\nmind with the tumult and all the laws of Jewish rights. He would get up in the morning\nfour o'clock in the morning and he would be on his way to study in the synagogue. I\nknew that he would wake us up because he would be coughing. Whenever he woke up he\nwould start coughing because he was a heavy smoker and when he left I didn't hear any\ncoughing any more. So, he did traditional things with him. He would get up and go to our\nsynagogue. We used to call it a . He would stay there until from four to\nseven, seven thirty and by that time he would come home and wake us up and go and\nprepare ourselves to go to school. My grandfather, he was very helpful. He actually\nprepared me for my bar mitzvah. He was very fluent in Hebrew and in German and of\ncourse other languages like Polish and Ukrainian. But his special language was Hebrew\nand German. By profession he was a printer. He came from which is\nsouth of Louve. He did have one sister I think and he had some family somewhere in\nRomania. I don't know that much about grandfather's side because I never met his sister,\nbut I remember back in 1938 that somebody from which is from\nRomania, came to visit us and we knew then that there was a cousin from grandfather's\nside that they live in Romania. He had a good life what I recalled even though it was\ndifficult from a national point of view, but it was close. We were one family. We had a\ngood rapport and a good relationship with our uncles. The other brewery in\nthat was right across our street so we had a major industrial park if you will of breweries.\nIt was the Isaac Brewery and there was the Brewery and then there was a\nBrewery and we were all together in it. It was good. I recall the way we\nwere distributing our wine to different stores. We had a wagon and horses and we would\nbe delivering wine so often. I used to like to go to the barn and every so often just to be\ntogether with the horses. So, the whole where we used to live, we used to\nlive on which is a normal whole block that compares with any block\nin the United States, it was all one brewery. We were sort of like a corner house which\nwas a three story corner house that borders on and .\nThat was the main road in the Louve that carried on for a number of miles. The\nis sort of almost like a district, an area where Jews used to live. It was a\ndominant area for Jewish life. It had many synagogues. In all, the Jewish people used to\ncongregate right there. I don't know how many thousands of families who are there, but\nthere are basically, it was the majority in . The minority in that area\nwere mostly Ukrainians and there was some Poles. There were more Ukrainians in our\narea than there were Poles. This is not to say that this was typical for In\nour area it was typical. The main activity in was on Friday where all the\npeasants or all the farmers would come and sell their goods, produce mostly. We had a\nfarmer that would come and deliver every Friday, sometimes Thursdays, but mostly\nFridays, dairy and the milk and the butters and the produce. The potatoes for winter time.\nThe cabbages, all that stuff because was the main outlet for those\nfarmers. Of course, we were doing also business at the same time. They were also\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview. The recording is the primary source document, not this transcript.

My mother would be purchasing from week to week produce, but\nfor the groceries she would go to a special store where it would specialize in Jewish food.\nIt was a vibrant area for Jews to live. It was very interesting and when the market the\nfarmer's market was over by Friday night, Friday evening as a matter of fact, you would\nsee everything was depleted. The whole area was quiet because Friday night we would be\ngoing to synagogue, so the area was depleted. Saturday it was not as fortuitous but it was\nstill kind of vibrant, mostly for the farmers who need to do some other shopping. So the\nwhole weekend was vibrant and active when it came to Sunday, Sunday was much much\nquieter. Although the Jewish life continued. When the life in those days and I'm saying\n'38 and '39 was quite active it was also troublesome. Because we wouldn't be completely\nfree of any problems. Any rumor that would install it would be quite dominant in our\nlives. The rumors were obviously of what happened in Germany and what happened in\nsome other countries like in Romania or Russia although we knew very little of Russia\nbut there were rumors, and he rumors were that Hitler was making statements that\naffected us automatically. There was a movement in Polish society to promote the\nanti-semitism. There was a part of that and anti-semitism was very dominant already in\nLouve and it was moving toward the end that we were worried. We didn't know whether\nwe had to take any action. In fact we didn't take any action other than we had a way of\nsaying let's wait and see what any troubles would be forthcoming. In 1939 it was a year\nthat we will remember the rest of our lives because it's the year the war broke out. I don't\nremember other than I recall when the war broke out it was a time where\nthe was bombarded. All the houses, one bomb hit our house. We were\nthen in our basement, actually in the cellar was where the winery was, but we no longer\nhad the winery but we had the cellar. A bomb hit just a part of our house, just a part of it,\nbut it was -- the damage was done not directly to our houses in general, but the staircase,\nfor example, which were concrete staircases, were they were marked and there were\nsome splits in it, although we didn't think anything looked collapsed, but there was\ndamage in it already. When we were in the cellar we had some other friends and some\npeople were in the cellar and we felt we are in trouble when we got out and it was a while\nthat I got out with Abe my older brother to see the damage. We didn't see any fire.\nNothing was really down other than one portion was hit and there were some other\nbuildings that were attached to our house and we checked that and I remember my\nbrother said well, there's not much damage to our hiding place. So, that I recall that we\nwere hit by a bomb. Apparently it wasn't a large bomb, but from there on, that was the\nbeginning of the war and in probably the next few days things had happened that Poland\nwas divided into two major areas with the lights somewhere west of Louve and the\nRussians came in. This was a new era that we began. The Russians occupied the eastern\npart of and was part of that territory. I recall when the tanks\nwere rolling down from coming from and they were\nhuge, huge, I have never seen in my life huge tanks and apparently they didn't have to\nfight anyone because the Polish army was not in our immediate area. If they were they\nwere somewhere else. So, there was no conquest to be bragged about. They kept on\nmoving, and they occupied and our immediate lifestyle had not\nchanged other than that in the next few weeks there was a proclamation of I think it was\nin a few weeks that all the major homes and businesses were confiscated and we had a\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

And probably we did not have to pay any taxes any more because\nthis was our main concern pervious, because my mother always had to come out with\nmoney for the loans we had incurred some years ago. So, that was a relief in a way. The\nbig question was how do you make a living. My mother didn't see how her facial with the\narmy showed that she was concerned about those things. Eli was basically two years\nolder than I was. He wasn't much concerned about the family as much as he wanted to\nfind himself, and he tried different approaches. He didn't feel like going to the\ngymnasium. He never cared for that. My older brother Abe was concerned because he\nwas one of the intellegencias and there were rumors that the Russians are rounding up the\nintelligencias for reasons that I don't understand. They would put them in prison which\nwas on -- I recall that prison being called . Whether they were arrested\nor not I'm not quite sure, but he was with us at home. During that period of time, 1939\nand into 1940, 1941, there was a period that I don't recall too much about Abe as much as\nEli. I continued to study. I continued to go to school, the gymnasium until that time. The\nsubjects my studies were now basically new. First of all since Jewish -- this was a Jewish\ngymnasium, we were told that now we are going to be learning Yiddish language. That\nwas a surprise. In addition to Yiddish language we also had Russian language along with\nthe Polish language, along with the German language, which was okay. My mother also\nmakes sure that she wanted me to learn the English language and the French language.\nShe used to, back in '39, she sent for me a special tutor for French and English. I was\nbetter in English than I was in French. That's how I picked up some of my English\nlanguage. But in the Jewish gymnasium we picked up two more languages and I was\nquite proficient in Yiddish, although the Yiddish alphabet is the same as the Hebrew\nalphabet. You actually write in Yiddish the way you pronounce it. In the Russian\nlanguage it was very similar to the Ukrainian language so I was also pretty much aware\nof that language, so we kept on going with our normal, normal studies with exception that\nwe picked up two more languages. The life under the Russians don't have too many bad\nrecollections other than that during that period of time more since Poland was divided\ninto two areas, the German area which 1s the line, quite a few refugees were coming more\nso from the western part of Poland to our area. Of course the Germans occupied the\nwestern Poland so they were directly under the German authority. And Jews were fleeing\nfrom that area. I recall that in my class in we received at least three\nGerman students one was from , one was from Berlin, two were from\nBerlin and one from . And there was another fellow who was also a\nstudent. He was from Czechoslovakia. I don't know he escaped probably from\nCzechoslovakia, but not Czechoslovakia per se. He was from the Bohemia part that was\noccupied by the Germans. He escaped into Poland and then to the western part of Poland.\nHe came to us to the Russian occupied part. In all, they were very jolly fellows. I was 14\nor 15 at that time and of course the fellows from Berlin they tried to speak either Polish\nor Russian and they had a horrible accent and they just couldn't get through because their\nRussian language and the German language they just don't put together. They used to\npronounce things in German that the pronunciation it was funny for us to listen to them,\nbut the were wonderful fellows, very, very good boys.",

        "A: No, they did not elaborate other than would I think would happen was the whole family\nescaped Germany to Poland so there were no problems with the family and they hardly\nspoke about any events that involved them. They were boys. They were my age. They\nwere more interested in soccer games. They were more interested in learning the\nlanguage, how to deal with us because we were actually and they were the\nGermans so we were basically -- they were not even of Jewish nature. We were Jews. We\nknew the Hebrew. We knew the laws. They were not that much involved. They didn't\ncare about that. Not that we cared either because we were actually just a part of our lives.\nWe were not frightened to bring them into our way of life. They had their way of life. So,\nthey did not mention anything of their event. The refugees who were coming in more and\nmore from the western part, from Poland, we felt that we better slowly but surely being\noverwhelmed with those people and the reports that they brought from the western part of\nPoland was just bad. They were claiming that the concentration camps are being\nestablished. they were claiming that there's a terrible persecution going on. We thought in\nbecause we knew about persecution that persecution -- because we didn't\nhave the same rights as the Poles of for that matter the Ukraine, but these were true\npersecutions they were telling us. We didn't understand what a concentration camp\nmeans. It was a hearsay and in fact you just didn't believe that. It wasn't a part that he\nwould accept that, it just wasn't acceptable. We didn't know what people would do in\nconcentration camp let alone the establishment and how do you so things people ignored\nthat part. But as they were coming, more by thousands, the shed that we used to have at\nhome, we have opened up, the salon and the special section room. We gave it up for them\nto dwell on it, to live in there. We had a large kitchen and we offered them everything we\nhad. They stayed with us. Some of them took to work. Some of them moved out on their\nown, mostly they were not families, they were mostly single people men and women who\ncame who escaped and tried a new life maybe it was temporary because they had left\nsome other people back home wherever their home was. There was quite a few from\n, from Warsaw from -- I don't recall the small towns in the western part\nof Poland. So, they stayed with us for a number of months until one day, one night a\nknock at the door, we had a big house in . It was the Russians came in and\nthey forced themselves into our place and they basically took all of these refugees. That\nwas traveling maybe 1940 there was a time when there was a major gathering, a major\nexpulsion of the refugees from to Russia. And we befriended some\npeople there, so we were not far away from the main station. I run into that, and they put\nthem in boxcars and a cattle trains, cars and they were locked up over there. That's how\nthey were going to transport them from to east to Russia. We couldn't\ndo anything about it. I knew they were crying, really crying. What did they do wrong?\nThese were Russians and this was the main event that I recall that the Russians did to the\nJews. They didn't kill them, but they put them away. We found out later that they were\nsent to and to different parts of Russia. I never met them again.

        "A: So when the Germans occupied there was a part that we didn't\n--when I saw we, I'm talking about the family. The family, my mother or my brothers and\nI was just a boy listening to what's happening, what surrounds us. We were concerned yet\nthere wasn't much that we could have done even though that it would be an immediate\ndanger. Our immediate danger would have been from the local people that we would be\nthreatened by. As I mentioned before we lived in , which the majority\nof people were actually Jewish people, but also the minority were the Ukrainians and\nPoles. We were not quite sure how to take it, what really happened, although we heard a\nlot that the Germans are very threatening people. We soon found out that the first few\nweeks in Louve after the German occupation of Louve, there were quite a few robberies\nand personal insults and personal beatings of Jews by the Ukrainians. Some of them were\nmaybe Ukrainians, some of them were maybe Polish, but it was very dangerous to go out.\nIt was very dangerous to walk on the street. Soon, we had a curfew that would not allow\nthe Jews to walk after certain hours, evening. That was maybe just as good, but the\nproblem that we actually had when it came to night, that was the time when the main\nrobberies and the main assaults on Jewish families began. It was the night first 1:00, then\n2:00, then 3:00 in the morning. They would rush into the house and if they couldn't find\nanything, they would destroy or maim people. Only during the night could you hear the\nnight cries, the night help rescue, seeking help. This was horrible right during the night.\nWe, at home we were basically safe because on the first floor we had a tenant that used to\nlive and apparently he was a . He was half German and half Polish, I think.\nThey occupied that level and they actually controlled the gate, not that he would help us\ndirectly but people know that somebody's -- Snyder I think was his name, he lived in that\nhouse, so we were basically protected. But you could hear at night the horrible screams\nbeing robbed and maimed and so on. It was a very bad period, but it wasn't getting better\nbecause every week there would be new regulations and new instructions and at one point\nand I don't recall exactly the month, we got instructions that we had to vacate the\npremises, the homes, where we used to live, and move into a small ghetto that was\n. To find a dwelling and to move out, and we didn't have that much\ntime. The furniture, the paintings, the rugs that we had, some of that Snyder took in his\npossession. He felt where we were going we wouldn't need them. All the beautiful\npaintings my father bought in Vienna, and the rugs. It's immaterial now, but at that time it\nmeant a lot to us. So, we moved out with a basic one couch and some of the belongings\nthat we had from the whole flat. It was my mother, myself, I'm not sure if Eli was there.\nMy oldest brother, Abe, he was no longer with us. He was taken away just before we\nmoved out to that small ghetto. He apparently went to a hospital to get some medicine.\nHe never came back. He had to go downtown to where later on it became the major\nghetto. It seems to me it was close to the ghetto. He went there and he\nnever came back. We didn't know what happened to him. We heard that later on one\nhospital was emptied by Gestapo or by people who worked with the Gestapo. They took\nthem away. I'm not quite sure when was established.\nwasn't even at that time a bad word. But we heard . 1S\nan area where Jews were killed and it was adjacent to camp. But we\nheard that word . So, he was not with us. Eli was in and out of our area,\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview. The recording is the primary source document, not this transcript.

I'm sure he was trying to survive, trying to\nfind some angles to get out of a bad situation. We moved out to that small ghetto. A\nsecretary to our business who used to be our secretary, she used to live in that area, in that\nsmall ghetto in a free standing home and she offered her house to my mother. I don't\nknow the deal that she made with my mother but at least we were secure that we had a\nhouse to go to and that was a relief because at that time it was very difficult to get an area\nbecause you're talking many thousands of people had to move out of one area to another\narea where you have a comparable exchange of dwellings. It wa questionable, but we had\nit. With our house in that free standing house and I recall there were maybe three rooms\nperhaps and there was another family that moved in with us. Now, it was a period of time\nthat we acclimated ourselves into this new ghetto. The faces that we didn't know before\nall of a sudden we knew them very well. They were all Jews. The way I understand that a\nJewish police was formed who supposed to bring law and order in the ghetto and our\nghetto. We were not much concerned with them, other than there was\nanother area that we were quite ambivalent that we did not know what that all means to\nus. We all of a sudden have a new life in a new ghetto, new people, new surroundings.\nThe future, who knows what it's going to bring. The rumors were actually in that ghetto\nthat those people who work will be much better off if they don't work, meaning that you\nbetter have a place to work and then you'll be getting some kind of identification card that\nwill help you survive. Survival really didn't mean too much to us other than it came to the\npoint where you had to survive somehow not knowing of camps or anything of that that\nwe are immediately placed in jeopardy of our lives. That didn't grasp yet. We weren't\ninvolved in that. We were involved mostly 1n our personal belonging, in our personal\nlifestyle and being attacked by hoodlums because you are a Jew you are no longer a\nhuman being. The ghetto didn't mean to us that this was the end of our line. It was\nperhaps the end of persecution by the Ukrainians. You were not directly confronted with\nthe physical abuse, the physical maiming of people. The rumors were you better get\nwork. That was in '41. I was 16 years old, and I wasn't -- didn't know where to find work.\nWhere do you find work in ghetto and I run across a friend of mine who told me that\nthere is a place on Street who -- and they called it that\nthey're looking for some workers, but he felt that I wouldn't be strong enough. I didn't\nknow what the work consisted of, but anyway it was something to look into. I went back\nto my mother and told her that there is a place that I was told that they're looking for\nsome workers and whether she would allow me to go interview. My mother didn't think\nthat she objected other than she warned me be careful. I went there. I went to\n. They called it later on . isa\nfactory or was a factory that made tar paper for the roofs and the way they were doing 1s\nyou roll out a three foot section of paper and you dunk it into asphalt. Later you roll it out\nand there are some people who were using dry sand and covering the wet asphalt and that\nbecomes a tar paper. What they were looking for workers who could carry balls of paper\n75 to 80 kilos of paper to go from one place, say from a truck to the depot that they had\nright in the back, or storage place, and I wasn't sure that I could do that, but if that meant\nto have an 1.d. and be protected I better do it. I walked into the office and told them that I\nwould like this work if they could have me. There was man called Fessel. He was a Jew\nfrom Slazia, it was in Poland, and he looked at me and close to him there was a foreman,\na Polish foreman. I forget his name and he asked me can you use this young fellow and\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview. The recording is the primary source document, not this transcript.

He took me out and tested me out, and he\nselected the largest ball, 75 kilos. Every ball was numbered and I picked it up and I\ncarried it and I dropped it the place where he wanted me to drop it and he hired me on the\nspot. You can work with us. It was basically not a relief for me other than that I felt that\nI'm employable. I went back home told my mom that I have a job and maybe we'll be\nmore secure. From there on it was very little things I recall other than I was working\nevery day with them going back from ghetto to or .\nIt's maybe a 20 minute walk, maybe 30 minutes. So, at that time, I was going back and\nforth and my mother all day long I would be working and evening I would be coming\nhome. At the same time I was able to purchase some produce at the place I used to work,\nlike tomatoes and maybe bread although we could buy some bread but we were rationed\nin ghetto. So, it was helpful. I don't recall at what point they have established living\nquarters in . It was some time later than -- I'm trying to recall\nsomething which I'm not quite at ease with me. Let me say the time sometime in August\nof 19-- 1t was in '42 already. I did work a number of months. It seems to me going back\nfrom ghetto to and here I'm blank a certain period of time that I\ncannot recall. The image that comes to my mind now is August the action. We called it\n, Where that small ghetto in was basically almost\nevacuated. Practically all the Jews were taken and I was at that time in\n, was located on Z6tkiewska Street. The main\nentrance was from which was the main thorough between north and\nsouth. And it was the area which would be within a couple blocks of where my home\nused to be, a couple blocks from my uncle's it used to be and so on. There was a time I\nrecall when the action came about in the ghetto and it was close to\nevening. Somebody rushed into the factory one of our workers. They were moving them\nout to the street. We moved out, I moved out immediately to the gate to see what we\nwanted to see. We saw what we didn't want to see, thousands and thousands of ghetto\npeople were moving and going to Street. I looked and I saw some of\nmy friends. My friends, dear friends that I used to play with. Some acquaintances. I was\nlooking for my mother. I didn't see her, didn't find her. It was maybe twenty rows and\nmiles of people. They were slowly marching. They were guarded by Ukrainian\n. I didn't see any Germans. Maybe in the back, but I didn't see them.\nMostly Ukrainian on each side. I didn't see the front either. I came right in the middle. I\ndidn't see the beginning the march, I didn't see the end of the march. I just kept on seeing\nthe area where it was visible to me from that narrow gate. They didn't see me. I saw them\nbecause the gate was actually locked, the gate. It was going on for hours\nand hours because there was a slow march. Finally it ended. People were looking from\nthe windows because all was inhabited by Ukrainians and Poles,\nsecond third stories, they're all looking at them. It was a very grim sight. I don't recall -- it\nwas the following day that I decided to go to the ghetto. Although they warned me not to\ngo, they I mean Fessel and the director of the factory. At that point in time I did already\nhave my 1.d., the identification card. I don't recall whether I had to wear a band or not. I\nprobably did, but I don't recall that. But I got into ghetto because I wanted to see what\nhappened to my mother. I rushed into the house. The house was empty but the hiding\nplace where we had the hiding place for my mother was a couch. A couch consisted of a\nframe and on top of the frame there was this soft part which is the couch. You couldn't\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

The frame and the\ncouch, the upper part was one unit. That's why when there was any action, my mother\nwould be hiding there. I would make sure of that. When I got home, the upper part was\nmoved so I was scared of that. When I cried out for my mother she came to life. She was\nthere. She was on the inside of the couch so even it was moved, she was in that area. She\nwas wrapped around in a blanket, a dark blanket. So even though they were looking for\nher, they didn't find her. She was there, so we had our moment, with my mother. A\nnumber of weeks went by before another action came about. I think during that action I\nlost my mother, and I don't know how they got her. So, she was gone. Eli was gone, Abe\nwas gone. It was a part of that they have then decided to establish a living quarters, I\nthink, on the premises of ;",
        "Q: Can I ask you something before we get to the living quarters?",
        "A: Sure.",
        "Q: What happened to your grandfather and Miriam?",
        "A: My grandfather died during the Russian time. He died -- I don't recall but it was during\nthe Russian occupation and he was buried in a grave yard. We felt that this was a very\ntimely death for my grandfather to die, not to see everything. But it was definitely during\nthe Russian occupation that we were not harassed at that time. Aunt Miriam she stayed\nwith us. Aunt Miriam did not have a good rapport with my mother, but at the time of that\nbad time, they changed their minds or they have relaxed their anger or whatever it was,\nthey were back together, at least on a talking basis. If I recall, she moved with us to the\nsmall ghetto. At what point she was taken I don't recall. But I don't recall her that much\nalthough I really liked her. She was one of the intellegencias, but she was a strange\nperson to many eyes, but not to me. I was her favorite, but what happened to her, I don't\nknow. I don't recall. Whether she was taken, the action I don't know because from there\non I did not see her. I don't recall where she went.",
        "Q: Tell me something about Eli and your family? Were you angry at him for not sticking\nwith your mother at this time?",
        "A: No. Eli was very special to me. He was 17, 18 at that time and he had his own friends. He\nhad many girlfriends. He always looking for money. He needed money. I was more of a\nfamily son. I was closer to my mother and assuring that everything was under control and\nEli was not the opposite of me and he wasn't completely with me as I would like him to\nbe. Abe was completely different. He was much older than we were. He was ten years\nolder. He had his own friends. He had very little to do with us. He would want to talk to\nme other than in Hebrew. He despised Polish language, so he would only speak Hebrew\nto me, and I had to respond to him also in Hebrew. Although my Hebrew wasn't that\ngood, but I carried on a conversation with him. It was something that I wanted to impress\nmy brother Abe at one point in time there was a Serbian or Yugoslavian king or\nRumanian king that abdicated sometime in 1938 and I tried to tell him this in Hebrew.

Abe was a little bit on the snobbish side because\nhe was always with his friends talking about zionism, talking about the world's affairs.\nHe tried to settle all the world's affairs. Eli was completely different from both of us. He\nwas more or like a happy go lucky fellow. He wanted to live now not tomorrow. Now is\nthe day. Since he didn't have that much, he would take certain things from home and sell\nit to satisfy his needs, and I was fighting with him. I wasn't angry with him, but I tried to\npreserve things that the family had. He understood that very well, but he was my favorite\nbrother because maybe we were fighting all the time and we loved each other and he used\nto give me some secrets and at night he used to take me outside the house and we would\nbe smoking. So, I kept things in secret. He was very good natured, though. He cared\nabout us. Now, Eli was taken away from us some time. I really don't know when. He was\ntaken away from that small ghetto. Now I heard that Eli was in concentration camp in\n. We weren't sure that this was a death camp, but it was very\nfearsome place to be in. The fact that we heard that and people are being\nkilled there. Even though that I heard that Eli 1s there, I felt always that when Eli is ina\ntight spot he always will get out. At least I hoped so. When established\nthe living quarters, I was one of them. We were a crew of 40 Jews only men. It was a\nplace where we felt was a very safe place at least for the time being. Even it was safe\nplace that we had within the 40 people there were certain groups that were more confined\nwith each other than others. Probably psychologists would love to study those groups. I\nwas basically with a group of boys my age. The 16, 17, and 18 and the question is how do\nwe get some cigarettes. That was the main thing at that time. The ghetto was gone. There\nwas nothing that I can do any more in ghetto. I didn't want to go anymore there. As a\nmatter of fact 1t was a Jew free area. The only thing that was dominant was actually the\ndowntown ghetto on Street and Street. That was the\narea. I did not know too much about things that surrounded us because we were confined\nin a given area and the only thing that we heard was the rumors that would come in. Even\npapers didn't come in. We didn't have any papers. So, the 40 Jews, even though we were\ntogether, they had such secrets. I didn't know what the secrets were. I learned later on\napparently they built an extra wall. There was a basement where we used to live. On top\nthere was the factory and the basement was the living quarters and in that basement they\nerected a wall which was done sometime probably before the action in August. I didn't\nknow that. Nobody let me know that. So, a lot of things -- in a way I was a little angry\nthat they didn't let me know that because I could have brought in my mother, into the\nhiding place. It was a hiding place. It was a whole wall and in that false wall, false\npartition, it was covered with wood, piles of cut wood that when at night at 12:00, 1:00\nthey would remove the wood and people would walk out for fresh air. Even at that time I\ndidn't know that. I found that out later. When I was living in time where maybe I was too\nambivalent, to naive of knowing what was going on. But, they were Jews. Families of\nsome of these 40 people and when I learned later on that there is a hiding place and I just\nhoped that Eli would be alive so I could bring him here. My work at that factory\nconsisted of working first with the bales, carrying the bales and sometimes just dusting\nthe asphalt with the dry sand. But then later on since I liked so much horses, we had a\nwagon there with horses that we would transport asphalt into the factory. There was one\nfellow who was we used to call the foreman. He took care of the horses and the wagon\nand he would transport the goods, certain asphalt and some of them he would bring also\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

I really enjoyed that. I'd rather work with horses\nthan work in the factory. The foreman of the factory liked also bunnies, rabbits. He had a\ncage of rabbits in the stall in the barn and he asked me to take care of them. So, I had the\nhorses now and I had the rabbits and I used to take care of them. It was pleasant. I liked\nto work with animals and at the same time I was the helper of . Lused to\ncall him . He was a very nice fellow. A very straightforward fellow. He was\nUkrainian. He did not see me as a Jew. I was Wilek to him and he was to\nme. I didn't care that he was Ukrainian even though that I knew that the Ukrainians killed\nJews and abused Jews and vice versa. He saw me as Wilek, a fellow. So, he was very\nnice to me, he was human. We liked each other. So, I was his assistant in doing anything\nthat the factory needed, to take care of. Caring for the animals but also transporting\nasphalt. This was going on for a number of months. Now, I had an opportunity to go out\nof the factory with him and see what was going on. Now, when I drove with him on the\nwagon, I did not have a band, I don't think so because I was part of the\n. SO, we used to drive oh maybe a kilometer or so to get the\nasphalt. We had a refinery not far from us within a kilometer or so. And that refinery\nthere was an area where there was a refinery, there was also a slaughter house for\nanimals. In that refinery, the bi product of the refinery is asphalt and they would pour out\nthe byproduct into an area, a depleted area a narrow area not too deep and what we would\nbe doing 1s we would be cutting them in blocks because they were solid and carry them\non top of the wagon and bring them back to the factory.\nEnd of Tape #2\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

        "A: So we used to bring the asphalt back to the factory and of course in the process of asphalt\nbeing liquified later on in huge ovens and that's how we get the process of that tar onto\nthe paper. That was my work in , working with day in\nand day out. We were able to drive from our factory to maybe two or three different\nstreets, and of course at that time Louve, that area any way, was already Jew free. There\nwere no Jews there anymore. Perhaps some were hidden, but there were no visible Jews.\nThe place was basically very quiet. It wasn't vibrant as it used to be the times that I recall\nback in '38 and '39. We were doing this a number of months and Peter and I we were very\nmuch befriended. We were talking about at times that it could happen that one of these\ndays they will take me away. The discussion was how do I survive. How do I get out of\nthis place. I did not have good moves ahead of me. I did not see too many visions, what is\na good way of doing it. In back of our factory there were tracks and those tracks you\ncould see every so often Hungarian troops going somewhere and the thought that came to\nmy mind, wouldn't it be nice if I knew some Hungarian language and just jumped in the\ncart and said hey, I'm one of you. But it was just a dream. Back with Peter, I told Peter\nwhat's a good way of surviving. He didn't give me a good answer. One day he came and\ntold me, you know Wilek, if I could hide you I would do that, but I can't trust my wife. I\nthanked him for the offer or his thoughts. We had a farmer that would deliver some\nproduce over a number of years and he was a very good friend of ours. He looked me up\nin , and he told me that if you need a place come to us. So, in that\npreparation I was very glad that he offered me a place to hide because I was at his house\nback on the farm a number of years ago, a number of times on my vacation. He would\ntake me in to . He had great piergos, it's dumplings with good stuffing. His\nwife used to make. I used to ride on the horses with him and take care of his cows. It was\njust fun for me to do that at that time. So, he came back, and he looked me up and he\noffered me, I had hope. There's a place to go. I had a duffle bag, a leather duffle bag and I\nput in some of my clothing, some of my things for him to have it just in case I do get to\nescape and get to his place. So, at least I have a place to go. Meanwhile I was working\nwith Peter. Because I wasn't sure where his farm was, I knew but I really didn't know\nwhere his farm was, and one day, Peter looks at me and says Wilek come over here. Do\nyou see this lady? There was a lady that was limping that was going to the office. I said\nyes I see her. I remember her. I remember her well. He told me that he delivered a wagon\nof potatoes there. That was some time early part of 1943 that he delivered a wagon of\npotatoes. It was a custom to buy potatoes in huge quantities for winter time and so on.\nThat was the way we did that in Louve. I asked him what makes him think that she's the\none. I mean how do I know. I don't know but remember her and I'll give you an address\nthat in case something happens here, you go there. Because he felt at that time that the\ndirector Fessel is grooming her or grooming this place for him to hide. I took this as a\ngood omen and I felt maybe he's got something there. It was a certain time within that\nperiod of time. It was just before the Warsaw ghetto that it was in April sometime that I\nremember that two partisans -- a partisan is a person who's a guerrilla warrior. They used\nto belong to a Polish underground, and they spoke to our leadership in to\njoin their partisan group. I'm not quite sure what transpired but I think our leadership\nrejected them. They didn't trust them. It was during that period of time that things are\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

We knew\nabout Warsaw and we knew they were fighting. We also knew that the downtown ghetto\nis getting tighter and tighter. Very few Jews you could see being escorted on the street,\nless and less because until that time you see a group escorted by the militia. People from\nghetto to work from work back to ghetto. Of course we were stationary. The group of the\n40 Jews. We were stationary. We live right then and but we see them once in a while and\nsometimes I saw on my wagon these groups going back and forth. I mentioned before this\nslaughter house and there was one Jew who used to work there and as we were cutting\nthe asphalt and that Jew across the field would look and wave to me and I would go there\ntalk to him and ask him what his business was while he goes back and forth from the\nslaughter house back to ghetto. But at the same time, he offered me some meat to take it\nwith me so I would bring that meat back home. Home meaning my\npeople. I would bring that. Occasionally I would be going from to\nghetto just to go there. I didn't have anyone there. Maybe I would be going with a friend\nof mine because he wanted to accompany, but I recall everytime I would be going there, I\nwouldn't be going there too often, but I was given an armband with a W letter which was\nfor meaning that we were working for the , the army, even\nthough that manager of our factory was a captain in air force which doesn't make sense\nbut that's the way it was. He apparently was very good, very good. A reasonable human\nbeing. He had an excellent rapport with Fessel. He was I think captain in the air force. He\nwas the one who would warn us when major problems occurred. At one point, he would\nwarn us that we were about to be picked up by the guards. We would move out. The way\nI dressed myself -- I was dressed myself as a typical farmer. This is the way I could\ndisguise myself the best, with long boots, with special boot type slacks. They're specially\ncurved that the boot accepts the slacks and with a hat and a cigarette in my mouth. I used\nto roll my own cigarettes so I was a typical farmer. The first time that we were going to\nbe picked up I just left. I had no where to go. Ghetto was opened. You could go in to\nghetto but who wants to go into ghetto. So I went downtown on Street\nwhere I used to go with friends of mine and prominent the area when we used to be\nyoung boys and free of troubles. It was like three or four o'clock or two o'clock,\nsomething right afternoon that I ran off from and there was very little\nyou could do downtown other than be picked up by Ukrainians or somebody who\nrecognized me. I was not, but my safe thing was to do was go to a movie house, so I went\nto a movie house just to kill time. After that time thinking just a few minutes ahead, what\nam I going to do next? I didn't have the answer. I had to do things that were natural in\nthat point in time. I saw a movie, another movie, it was newsreel of cutting. This was\nwhere the Germans showed how the 20,000, or 40,000 Polish officers were killed. The\nRussians claimed that the Germans killed them. The Germans claim that the Russians\nkilled them. This was the time that Saw that excerpt. I was all engrossed in that because\nfor the first time I hear there was a cutting, there was a slaughter of Polish officers but\nfrom the German side. After the movie, I went out and I don't know what time it was but\nI saw a column of Jews were going to ghetto. I put my armband and I joined them. That\nis the only place that I can go right now short of being right down town without Jews. So,\nI joined them and I went over there to ghetto. There was probably a few weeks after the\nWarsaw ghetto or around that time. I knew that I had to do something very drastic soon,\nbut didn't have the opportunity yet. I went back to ghetto. The ghetto was so crowded I\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview. The recording is the primary source document, not this transcript.

In\nother words, living in in my own bunk in the basement with only 40\nJews was a paradise from what I have seen over here. People were living in the street.\nJust a terrible situation. No clothing, torn clothing, and a lady that I recognized who used\nto live on the same street, she was a daughter of a grocer. A very pretty young lady, she\nwas probably in her 30s, I think. She became a prostitute in ghetto. But she took me in\nimmediately. She was my neighbor, and she gave me some slotties and I left went to\nanother place to another friends, the same surroundings, and I walked into an area where\nsome older young men were looking for how do you get out of ghetto. How do you join\nthe partisans. And I was right in the midst of it. On suggestion was we get a whole group\nwith the armbands and let some of us be the militia, the Ukrainian militia and escort that\ngroup all the way down all the way down because nobody is going to ask\nwhere are you going with this Jewish group. That was one of the questions. The other\nquestion is where do you the uniforms. Where do you get the arms, and so forth. It was a\nround robin exercise, how to you survive yourself. The following day I got word that we\nare safe. In other words I could go back to and resume my work. I went\nback. I went back to and resumed the work, but now I felt very strong.\nIt's only time before things happen. There was another major action sometime later, I\nforget when in '43, whether it was June or July, a major action and I was told that Eli was\nthere. He returned that he knew about me and during the action this was on that day\nsomeone else was going to go to ghetto also because of action, rescuing someone. I\njoined them. I said I want to go with you. I went and I took an extra armband for Eli just\nin case I catch him. I went over there and they told me the address and I went to that\nplace and there was a lady there, an empty house basically and asked her about Eli. She\nsaid he was here, but they picked him up. I came too late. I was downhearted. There was\na place that very few people should be going through this exercise. As I was walking on\nthe street, there was one fence there and I hear right on the other side of the fence, people\nwere praying with a loud voice. During the action and I kept on walking because I had to\nget out of that area. They will pick me up but I was secure because I did have the\narmband and I had the W and I had the identification stamp. I forget the stamp. It was a\nswastika stamp and I think it was a red stamp which was the most recent stamp. So I was\nsafe. I went through and I got the other people who went with me from\nand we made our exit in a hurry. At that time, I didn't see any buses anymore or any\ntrucks anymore. They finished the action for the moment so we took our exit out. I went\nback to . Eli was gone. They took him away. So there was nothing I can\ndo at this point. He's gone. The whole family is gone as a matter of fact. Now, a few\nmonths went by now and they were talking now about the liquidation of ghetto. I don't\nrecall when they had liquidated the ghetto other than one point in time just prior that we\nwere to be picked up they pronounced that Louve is Judenfrau, Jew free. No Jews live\nanymore in Louve. Now, the more I'm thinking from there on, I'm thinking more and\nmore about this lady, the limping lady. Peter gave me that address and he told me exactly\nhow to go there to get to that place. There was sometime in the morning, I forget when. It\nwas a beautiful morning as a matter of fact. The sun was out, nice and chilly. Whether it\nwas September or October, I don't know. It was sometime in the fall one day we were\ntold that 1:00 we would be picked up. Now, time was early in the morning, maybe eight,\nnine, ten. I don't know. I knew immediately that something 1s going on because Fessel\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview. The recording is the primary source document, not this transcript.

They were not moving\nyet, but they were ready to move out. I didn't even try to look down in the basement what\nis going on regardless even though you have a hiding place, I wasn't about to stay there. I\ndecided to go, to move because I didn't see any future in hiding in that place. Sooner or\nlater, probably sooner than later we were going to be discovered, so I didn't take this\nplace as a safe one. My point was 1s to get out. The question when, that is within an hour\nor so. I went to Peter. I said goodbye to him and I moved out. That was the last time I saw\nPeter. He wished me luck and I went out. I kept on walking. I don't remember all the\nstreets that I went through, I just followed certain streets and I went through a place a\nmain thorough and right on the street a friend of mine, well, not a friend but an\nacquaintance. A fellow I went to school with, to public school, Sayer his name was and\nhe saw me. He looks at me. Of course he knew that I'm Jewish and I look at him my\nquestion 1s is he going to betray me. I didn't think so. He grabbed me and we went to a\ngate, to a house and I told him I need your help. What do you need? I said I need you to\nbe here at a certain time, about three o'clock. I don't know what time it was then but there\nwas plenty of time. I thought I'd need him to go to the station to get my ticket because I\nhad my farmer in mind. But I was on my way to that lady. Just in case I didn't get any\nresults there, I'd have a chance to go there and I needed him to help me out to buy a\nticket, a train ticket. I wasn't sure how to buy it. I wasn't sure that part how to buy the\nticket, but besides I needed his help anyway if he could offer me or at least not to betray\nme. He said I'll be here at 3:00. What else do you need. I told him I didn't need anything\nother than to help me to go through that period of that hour or two. I kept on walking. I\ndidn't think that I would be betrayed by Sawyer. I didn't think so even though he was\nUkrainian. So, I kept on walking and I went to that place. At first I didn't recognize the\nhouse because he described me a certain house but when I looked at those houses, they\nall looked the same. Across the field there was barracks where the Ukrainian militia used\nto live. There was an area where I felt well, you do or you don't. I went to one house and\nI asked -- her name was Maria, and I knocked at the door, is Maria home? The person\nsays no Maria here. I'm sorry. Then I went to another door. It must have been one of\nthose houses so I went to another house. The next time and she opens the door. Maria\nwas there. Now, Maria doesn't know me. I know Maria. She was limping. She was a good\nlooking lady, probably 25 to 28, Polish. I asked her that I'd liked to see Mr. Fessel. She\nsays no Fessel in this house. I said well, probably not but please tell him that one of his\nworkers is here. She says no Fessel is not here. I said okay. I took off. Maybe I was\nmisled. I took this as a true sign I was misled my next option is to go to my farmer. I kept\non tracing my steps back, the same way and I was going to see Sawyer. As I walked\ndown I'd say a good half a mile down the road, I hear some hollering behind me. It was\nMaria with her limping legs was after me. She was hollering for me to stop. I finally\nstopped and went back, kept on walking towards her and she looked at me. You're so\nstupid and some other expletives. Come back with me. And probably I was stupid and\nshe took me back and walked me right into this room in this house where Fessel was.\nNow, my first impression was grim faces because they were not sure how I got that name,\nhow I got the address because if I could find them someone else could find them.\nObviously true, Peter could find them. This was their main concern. They weren't\nconcerned about me but about Peter. Peter as far as I have never seen him drunk. And\nPeter he was such a friend that he would never betray me. So there was no concern. I\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview. The recording is the primary source document, not this transcript.

His brother\nwas a tall, very heavy set fellow who impersonated a German captain. He had a German\novercoat and a German hat, but when I saw him, he was just Fessel, an obese fellow. It\nwas Fessel, his brother, his lady friend, two other people who I don't know how they got\nin there probably through a different route, but the route that I know how Fessel got into\nthis house was Fessel his brother, and another worker, I think Kline, who used to be his\npersonal secretary in . So at least two people from our factory, his brother\nwhich I never saw him before, his lady friend. That lady friend was a sister of that other\ncouple, that was already there apparently and another fellow that I don't know how he\ncame about there. Maybe he was completely independent but he was a lover of Maria. So\nwe had like seven people there. I think there was seven, I was the eighth one. It was a\ntime where they were concerned about their security because of Peter. The question was\nwhether or not they should send me back, back to Peter's place home and tell him no one\nwas there. So, I could go and apparently go back home to their place to secure their\nhiding place. It was stupid and it was very inconsiderate and but because they would put\nme in a double jeopardy really, because it was very difficult to travel, walk that number\nof miles to his place. They finally decided not to do that because they felt that Peter was\nmore of a friend of mine than of theirs. They left it at that. So, now I was not one of them,\nbut at least I was in a safe place for the time being. The area we were in one room I think\nmaybe it was another room, but basically I was in the front in the large room that was\ntogether with this hiding family. We had a trap door to the basement which was not in the\nwalking place but in a crawling space. We had a special area that was covered with a rock\nin case something happens we all go inside and hide ourself there. We had our food.\nApparently Fessel had enough money to supply for our existence there and apparently\npaying also Maria. I'm sure nothing went free because she demanded some money. I\ndidn't have any money so she couldn't get anything out of me, and she never asked either.\nSo, I thought things were taken care of by Fessel. The other couple they also were from\nLouve, I forget their name and that really irritates me that I don't remember those names\nbecause they're very important people because even though you're hiding and you're sort\nof in a group relationship, you were strangers. Maybe you had one thing in common, we\nare all Jews and we want to survive. There was one thing in common but different\ninterests in different projections in their lives, that was another thing. So, the dynamics of\nour group was strange, but I could listen to their conversations. I could take part of some\nof them, but Fessel was the dominant fellow who would set the tone of this group. There\nwas a point in time the ghetto was liquidated already and now there were rumors that the\nconcentration camp is being liquidated. The rumors were also that the\nRussian army is moving toward Poland, closer and closer. They weren't talking about\nimmediate occupation or immediate conquer of the territory but it was close enough that\nyou need to make a decision. Whether to stay in the hiding place or to move on. I did not\ntake any part of the decision because my action was always to stay in the hiding place. So\nthat wasn't an option that would be denied to me. The other option was whether or not to\nescape Louve all together. There was a young couple who would be coming and in\nkeeping 1n touch with us. They had Gentile papers and they had excellent Gentile features\nand they would be the ones with whom we had contact with the outside. They would\nknow how to prepare the papers, Gentile papers and how we could be rescued. Now the\nquestion was should they take me into the rescue effort moving out of Louve. They\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview. The recording is the primary source document, not this transcript.

The question was they're going to\nbe moving out, should they take me with them. I confronted that part with Fessel and I\ntold Fessel that although it wasn't his obligation towards me at all but I asked them that I\nwould like to be with them. I could always stay here, but I want to get out of Louve in\ngeneral. This is a horrible place. I don't want to be here, even in hiding. He said well,\nwe'll have to see what our resources are. We'll have to see if we can give you some\npapers. He apparently was good enough to do that for me. I was told that their plan is to\nescape ultimately to Hungary from Louve to from to\nMountains, through Slovakia to Hungary. That's the plan. I walked with\nthem all the way. I'll go with you anyplace you go. I felt that I could be of help to them if\nthey needed me. The time came sometime in the early part of December I think, maybe it\nwas in December, that we got our papers, the Gentile papers with our photographs and\nthe stamps and the my name was . I took the name of an\nacquaintance of mine from . He was a very nice fellow and I thought he\nought to have my name. So, from there on, my name was from then\non until my liberation. My religion was catholic, and everything else was true on those\npapers. My birth and where I was born, and everything else except my name and my\nreligion. From there on, there was at night prior to that by the way that was something\nvery interesting happened that I recall. You know when you are in hiding for so many\nmonths you don't know how to purchase things. How to deal with the outside although\nwe are informed by Marie where things are, how to get to the station, because now we\nhave to move from Louve, buy a ticket, and these are small items but very crucial items.\nGet out of the house, buy a ticket, go into the main station, buy a ticket and go to\n. Finding the place, and find a place and maybe a reservation for the\ntrain or not. That we did not know. Maria was not about to buy any tickets for us, so they\nasked me whether I could go on an exercise to the main station, look around, see where\nthe purchase ticket box 1s, see if there is anything unusual and go buy the tickets. Well, I\nwent there. One night they left me and I had to go from the place at night walking\nthrough the fields, through the barracks of the militia and there is a small station. I got to\nthe station and I got to the main station and to see where I could buy tickets. I went to the\nmain station, bought a ticket. On the way back to our place and to see the temperament\nand the environment we would be going through. When I came back, all the inhabitants\nof our hiding place were outside just in case to run in case they caught me and brought\nmilitia with me. They were relieved. I came back. Gave them the report and they were\nready to move on.\nEnd of Tape #3\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

        "Q: Do you have any idea why Maria would want to save Jews or at least save this group?",
        "A: I'm not quite sure. I never asked her. The only thing that I could stipulate was that she\nwas prearranged prior to that. The fact that I saw her one day in a factory walking\ntowards the office that means she was prearranged. She was given I'm almost sure that\nshe was paid, handsomely paid, by Mr. Fessel. I know other things that during my stay in\nthe hiding would be that her father would be visiting her one day in the week and that\nwas the day that they used to play similar cards to poker and he would be playing with\nFessel and Kline and Joseph evenings and it was make sure that her father would always\nbe the winner on that evening. He may be losing a little bit, but in the end when the game\nwas over, he would be coming out with money. He knew about us obviously, so he was\npaid that way through winning in this game. Other than that, I don't have any other facts,\nbut Maria a person of no wealth. She had this house and she was with Usak who told me\nwhere she used to live and maybe that was part of the attraction, but I'm not sure what\nwas the other relationship, whether she did it actually strictly for money and part of\nhuman compassion. Maybe it was a combination of both.",
        "Q: Was this a very lonely time for you?",
        "A: It wasn't lonely because I was always active. I was very active. My mind was always\ngoing regardless what was going -- what surrounded me. My question was to myself how\ndo you get out of this place. I was fierce about it. I was driven by that. How do you get\nout and stay alive. Because I felt that I had to say something later on. Maybe this is why\nI'm here, but I felt that maybe other Jews will survive but I think I had a feeling that I had\nto say it, to say that part. So lonely, no I wasn't lonely. I was too dynamic to be lonely.\nSo, when they saw me coming back from that train station and they greeted me with\nenthusiasm at least at that point in time I was one of them and soon after we packed our\nthings whatever I had. I don't think I had anything with me. I just had just my hat, my\njacket, a scarf, my boots and I was ready to go. We went through the main station, got our\nticket. There was a direct train to . It was all night. We went through over\nnight and the following day we were already in . We were picked up by\nthe smugglers. Now, let me back off just a bit. That couple who used to come who had\ntheir connection from outside, brought the papers for all of us. That couple that I forget\ntheir name, were left behind because that's what they chose, to stay. All of us left,\nincluding the lady friend of Fessel's brother. By the way, she was pregnant. She was big\nand my estimation was that she was in the eighth month of pregnancy, but she was\nwalking and she was also determined to survive. We were on a train and got picked up\nlater on in by the smugglers who were previously arranged by this\ncouple who gave us all the false papers. We went to a place. I forgot this area at the time\nwhere it was that they took us. I remember that we had our lunch with Polish kielbasa.\nWe had a piece of bread and that evening or that night, we were going to move out of\n. Because everything else was prearranged. It was sometime December or\nit was early part of January. I don't know that period of time. It was 1944, January or\n1944 or December 1943 but very close to that time. I want to say that I am close right on\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview. The recording is the primary source document, not this transcript.

It was very cold and we took a train from\nto a small village close to Tatra Mountains. It was basically a ski\nresort and we departed from there. We picked up and we kept on walking. It was an area\nprobably that was not very much guarded by the Polish police. By the way, this area was\nstrictly guarded and governed by the Polish people, Polish police force and border police.\nThe smugglers were actually Polish. I forget their name. I forget even their faces but we\ngot through and we kept on walking through the Tatra mountains. The episode that I\nrecall was walking in the snow. It was so called and also the snow was very deep. The\nsurface of the snow was frozen so each time you walk into the snow, you like walked into\na trap because you couldn't get out. It was a very difficult walk. Now, the lady who was\npregnant she had a horrible time walking. At least I had boots but I don't recall 1f she had\nboots. So, she kept on walking and her friend, Fessel I have never seen him helping her.\nNo one else would try to help her Kline or Joseph. The older fellow Fessel, he had a heart\nproblem. He was always holding his hand on his heart, so he was incapacitated in that\nmode. I was young. I felt good. I was strong and I tried to help her. I did help her. I kept\non walking with her. At first I was walking with her and giving my shoulder to her and\nembracing her and kept on walking but at least we were in step with the rest of us. At one\npoint in time I asked Fessel to help her because I was getting tired and I asked Usak to\nhelp her or Kline to help her and they all felt that they were too tired themselves, they\nwouldn't survive the trip. I couldn't leave her. I had to walk with her and I walked her and\na long time I just carried her and I didn't see any one of the people to help her out. Such a\nshame, but we survived. We went through the Tatra mountains and got into Slovakia. At\nleast we were there. We were so called safe and the boarder police grabbed us. They took\nus into a place which I don't recall too much of it, but then later on we identified\nourselves as refugees from Poland, so we were all Polish. So, from this police area I think\nthey took us into a school. We were given lunch and had milk and we were cared for. I\ndon't recall how long we stayed there. There was another couple from Poland,\nindependently they came in. They were refugees. One was a professor I think, a Polish\nprofessor with his wife, and some other people. At that point they took a picture of us that\nI had it but I lost it during my other events but Usak got it and showed me some time\nlater. The object has to move from Slovakia now to Hungary and within a few days I\nthink we were moved from Slovakia to another border town which I have a hard time\nremembering. It was comes to my mind. Maybe I'm wrong but\nwas the border. There were some Jews -- see Hungary at that point in\ntime was not occupied. It was the early part in January. If I recall well, when I was\nalready in Hungary, Hungary was occupied in February by the Germans, maybe a later\npart of January but not the early part. We were brought in and and\nthere was a Jewish couple that took us in for that evening. It was a Friday I think and the\nreason I remember was because there was shobotz and they offered us A\nis a meal a Jewish meal with beans and chicken and carrots and all that good\nstuff. It was very good, very tasty. This was the first time I was exposed to it. I was very\ngrateful for it. The following few days from because we wanted to g into\nBudapest and that was our goal because from there on Fessel had his plans. I had my\nplans so once I got into Budapest which we got into Budapest within a week or so. I don't\nremember that period very well, but I remember that we were in Budapest and the\nquestion was we were not occupied at that time so we were free and I identified myself\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

Whether they helped us or not\nI don't recall. It was immaterial to me. What I wanted to do to identify myself that I am a\nPolish refugee and to be on their books. From there on it was just a matter of finding out\nyour level of survival. Where do you go from there. The trigger point was the time when\nthe Germans again invaded Hungary. That was the trigger point, be on the run. You had\nto run again, and where to you run. By that time I had already met some people, not\nfriends, but acquaintances, we became friends because they were in the same shoes. The\nsame problem, where do you run. One thought was to run to get into Turkey. The way\nyou could get to Turkey was through Rumania. The other thought was to run to\nSwitzerland, means you had to go through Austria. Which route do you explore. You\nexplore them both, but one is less dangerous than the other. I felt to be in Switzerland\nwould be a good deal to do, but to go you had to Austria. That was bad. A better way is to\ngo through Turkey through Rumania. I had friends that became my friends that were in\nthe underground movement and I joined them. Some of these people were mostly Jews.\nSome Polish, but that didn't seem that much of a difference because they all were going\nto run somewhere. I had more trust in my Jewish compatriots because the Polish\nunderground which was a/k Army Crawly, was a group that I wasn't sure I would be\ncomfortable with, so I went with that Jewish group. Even that group, I have some Polish\nmembers. I was in a cell. Seven people, we had seven people in our cell. I wasn't given\norders to carry out. Basically I was a courier for them, transferring papers from place to\nplace, mainly from Buddha to Paris and from Paris to Buddha and so on. At one time I\nhad to go outside Budapest, but this was a short trip and I came back. One time I had to\ncarry a gun to transfer a gun, but I was doing some carry out orders and I felt good about\nit. I'm doing something about it. Friends of mine, they were also printing false papers,\nfalse birth certificate, false statements of good standing of a given community and so on.\nChurch papers I mean a lot of things that was needed for anyone especially for Hungarian\nJews. Not specifically for Polish refugees. We were all saved so called. The question now\nis how do you help out the Hungarian Jews. They needed the papers. They did not have\nthe flexibilities that we did have because we were right outside. There was a time that\nthey were mostly almost confined to the house ghettos. They already had the stars. They\nhad to carry, we did not. We were free. I happened to get myself with the underground\nand they advised me to have two or three residents in Budapest, having a place to live in\nBuddha, in Pess -- in Buddha I had to places where to live and when I chose a place to\nlive, I used to live always with a Christian family. I was safe there. Although I tell you I\nfeel at time whenever there was a knock at the door, there was always a heart beat, an\nextra heart beat that I have developed later on in my life because somebody is knocking\nat the door at the wrong time and maybe for the right purpose or for the wrong reason as\nfar as I am concerned. So, there were time when they were raiding some areas, but this\nwas in Gentile areas. I never lived with Jewish families, not in Budapest. But there were\nraids just in general and I was one of them, but I never had an occasion to be examined\nand to be found that I had any problems with them being either question whether I was a\nGentile or not. As a matter of fact, I used to go with those families to the church every\nSunday morning, and to be one of them. It was that kind of life that we tried to provide\npapers to the Jewish people in Budapest. Papers, birth certificates, status certificates and\nso on. Being in Budapest right in the midst, I'm almost angry with myself not knowing of\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

No mention about Swedish consulates and so on. I don't know if I\nwould have gone that route, but at least I was never exposed to that. Friends of mine were\nexposed to Switzerland and they went that route. I understand he never made it. Another\nfriend went through to Turkey. It was a perfect Gentile couple who had went through a\nreverse of circumcision. They were perfect in the physiotomy. They got through\nand through Rumania but they were torpedoed in the Black Sea I\nunderstand, so they never made it either. I was still there in Budapest and the question\nwas when I'm going to get out of it and one day I have an order to go to Rumania because\nI have asked for them to send me to Rumania and to get in touch with other underground\nin Rumania. They send me and they told me who to see, when I get over the boarder,\nwhat to send them. The question was whether or not the border between Rumania and\nHungary is safe. Of course, I was told that the reason they are sending me 1s to get that\nmessage to the other side, to Rumania. Later on I found out that the reason they sent me\nwas to find out whether the border was safe. So, it was one of those things that you have\nto take your chances. I did not know about that. I found that on later on when I was sick\nand back in Germany, that I wasn't told the whole truth of the matter. Shortly I went out\nfrom Budapest directly to . I think that was the name, that was the city,\nand I had to pick up those two smugglers who were going to take me to\nRumania. The way they identified themselves is by folding hands two of them and they\nwere there, they were waiting for me. And they took me and we were not far from\n; was the village I think right on the border between Hungary\nand Rumania. They took me to a place to a barn that's all I remember, a barn. Apparently\nI didn't sleep all that long and I was so exhausted I just fell asleep before someone burst\ninto that barn and it was the Hungarian ; with the black hats\nwith a pheasant feather. From there on they interrogated me. I did not have too much with\nme. I didn't have any money. I had a couple hundred penco, which is minimal. I didn't\nhave any papers other than my own identification paper and that's all I had. I had a few\nphotographs that got me into trouble later on, but they were mostly interested about my\nspy mission. What was I carrying, why kind of message was I carrying to Rumania. This\nroute by the way was known as a route the Jews were fleeing away from Rumania. There\nwas one lady that I recognized her as being Jewish and she was in that interrogation\nroom. They whisked me away from her later on. She was crying. Later on I also saw\nthose two smugglers in another circumstances. They were beaten very severely. Their\nfaces were black and blue, so at least from my prospective they did not betray me,\nsomeone betrayed them and in turn I was also betrayed. I was interrogated for a number\nof hours. I don't know at what point they transferred me, they deliver me to the gestapo.\nBy the way, from that place they took me back to where it was the\nheadquarters of gestapo. I was escorted by the Hungarian gerdeams. The gerdarms they\nwere actually the border police but they had some other special assignment. They were\nthe leaders of the police force in Hungary. I stayed in maybe a few days\nand I was again interrogated.",

        "A: Yes, I was beaten. I was beaten terribly. In other words they put a bar between your legs\nand then your whole body is folded downwards and you're beaten on your feet. Of course\non the buttocks and so on. It was very painful, but I took it. It wasn't a big thing that I\nrecall it was impossible not to survive. They wanted to know again, what was the\nmessage that I was trying to deliver to Rumania. Being Jewish I dropped my pants, being\nJewish wasn't their concern apparently. I don't recall that. Whether they took it for\ngranted one way or the other, I was never told. The main idea for them was to move me\nas soon as possible back to Budapest and they took me back to Budapest and they put me\nin a political prison on . That was the political prison in Budapest\nand I stayed there for a number of weeks or months almost. I'm not quite sure how long.\nIt was there that I met other some of my acquaintances from Budapest. I met\nwho was the ambassador from Hungary to Poland who spoke perfect\nPolish language. I also met across the court a lady name who later on I\nfound out she was Hanna . She was very resourceful to convey her name one\nletter after another.

It was a\ntime that if I want to tag a point it was Yom Kippur 1944. was still alive.\ndefinitely was still alive because I corresponded with him later on after the\nliberation. I was interrogated almost daily because not only they wanted to know what\nwas my message but the unfortunate thing was they found a picture in my possession. A\nfellow that I befriended in Budapest who was from Berlin, he was also a Jewish refugee\nbut for some other reasons I befriended him and we were dating girls together and we had\nfun with him and he was in that prison also. They caught him, so they wanted to know\nwhat was my association with him. So it was a complication. I don't know what happened\nto him. I don't remember even his name but he was a very nice fellow. He was a fellow\nthat I would feel very comfortable to be a friend. Sometime later after 1944 I remember\nwe were about to be ready to be moved out of this prison and we were told that they are\ngoing to send us to some kind of camp. It must have been some time in October because I\nrecall I got in, they brought us to Auschwitz and it was on my birthday, October 29, 1944\nthat we walked on that platform. It was a train, from a regular train and they brought us\nimmediately to this office. They tattooed us. Now, my name was 193 229, no longer the\nname . There was no other names but my number. The time in Auschwitz I\nhave very little memory of it. I did work there. I did get this uniform. I had the cap, with\nthe stripe. Whether they gave me some wooden shoes I don't recall. Probably they did,\nmaybe I did have it. I did have it I think, I did have it, the wooden shoes. I was one of the\ninmates now. I was in one of the barracks, surprised that I don't even remember the\nnumber of the barrack because you must remember that. I don't remember that. Maybe I\ndon't want to remember, but we were close to that barrack where there was a special\nbarrack where things were -- a punitive barrack and I was told to stay away from it, that\nbarrack. Not much, I don't think that I was ever concerned about being gassed. My only\nquestion was how do I get out.",

I think it was a\nleft position and then within an hour or so they pulled me back. Took me back into my\nbarrack. It was at that time that I realized that I am somehow protected and when they\nlook at my tattoo oh you're a , that's the word that I all of a sudden get to\nmy mind, a protected inmate, prisoner whatever. But what I was as a Jewish prisoner or\nnot a Jewish prisoner, I was a Jew with them and it really didn't matter at that time what\nmy status was because I was one of them. One major event that I recall wa the hanging of\nfive Polish prisoners who escaped Auschwitz. When they were brought back, they took\nout the whole camp to watch the hanging. That was sometime probably in December. It\nwas awfully cold, very cold and we stood probably until two or three o'clock in the\nmorning when the hanging took place and after the hanging normal life proceeded in the\ncamp. Then again there's a gap that I don't recall what was going on, just a matter of daily\nconsumption of the stale bread. The bread came from the transports from the wagons\nfrom the trains, but we were given stale bread. It was just at least it was something to eat.\nThe food was very terrible, very thin soup, just water. But I was not -- didn't feel that bad.\nI still felt that I could withstand the ordeals and whatever took place because they were\ntalking about soon there's going to be some liberation because Russian troops were\nmoving in closer and closer. As a matter of fact, our thought was that\nwas already taken. Maybe it was a hope, maybe it was not, but anyway they were very\nclose. So, the recreation of Auschwitz was almost eminent. January 5, comes to my mind\nbut I'll stand corrected if it was something else. We were evacuated from Auschwitz and\nwe walked a long time to another station, and I don't recall too well but we were put into\nopen carts, only men. I hadn't seen any women, and they took us out. A horrible trip, a\nhorrible trip, people were dying because of this cold exposure. I had frostbite on both\nfeet. They were persistent, I had shoes that were tight and it was very trying for me\npersonally because I never felt during the whole time that I will be able to survive. I\nalways felt that I could survive. There was a doubt in my mind that I could do it because I\ncouldn't physically move things the way I used to. We were, the train was moving\nthrough Czechoslovakia. I know because I heard that and as we were going underneath\nthe overpasses, they were covered with a lot of Czechs and they were throwing bread to\nus in the open cart. It was a good omen. I had a loaf of bread and Leon, a friend of mine\nwith whom I've been for since Budapest, that's where I met him, he was with me all along\nin the camp. He survived by the way and he was in Israel. He saw me sometime later in\nMunich. He visited me in the hospital. We went out and they kept us moving along from\nplace to place. There was no place that they had in mind. We finally wound up in\n, why I don't know.

        "A: My name is and they used to call us Willy or Wilek. Loew was L-O-\nW, but when I came to the United States it was changed to L-O-E-W. So the name\nactually here in the United States is William Loew, but my friends back at home they\nremember me as Wilek. I was born in Lwow, Lemberg. Lemberg is basically a German\nname for Louve and my parents came from probably Austria. I'm not quite sure, but from\nAustria and we settled down in Lwow. That was Galicia at the time and also known as a\nAustria Hungarian empire. The time in the when I was born I had\nbasically a nice family, a wonderful family. Let me speak about my brothers. I had an\nolder brother we used to call Eli. The oldest one was Abe. We had a very close family.\nMy mother was very -- was a housewife but also dealing in business. Our business was\nwe had a brewery a mead brewery which is a honey wine. The business was quite\nprosperous. For one thing, our business has been derived from previous generations. We\nstarted, but not my father but my grandfather and my uncles they started in 1870. As a\nmatter of fact I still have one of the labels of our original wines which is a honey wine.\nOur family was approximately 80 persons strong counting my uncles, my grandfathers\nfrom either side, my mother's and my father's side. We were more numerous on my\nfather's side than on my mother's side. My mother's maiden name was Margulies and\nsome of her brothers went to Palestine. At that time in 1932, 1933 and the remainder\nstayed there in at that time. We stayed and we tried to continue our\nbusiness. My father died when I was four years old. He died probably 1929 so my mother\nactually took over the business. I don't think she was a good business woman from what I\nrecall. The business continued. We had my oldest brother could not get into a university\nin because there was a quota for the Jewish students, so he had to move\nout from Louve to Warsaw. So, he studied there. This was expensive to study in Warsaw\nbecause the money that we had from the business was not that prosperous. I'm not quite\nsure the reason for it but I think that my mother wasn't as aggressive in the business as\nshe should be. So, if I recall sometime in 1934 to 1934 before we folded our business and\nwe were no longer in the business of honey wine. But my uncles they continued to be in\nbusiness. At that time in that previous years, we used to export our wine to different areas\nof Poland that we know and also to other countries. The Jewish life in Louve was the best\nthat can be said back in '37 '38 from what I can recall was lukewarm. It wasn't very bad.\nIt wasn't very good. We did have our quotas going to school as a matter of fact when I\nwent for my exam to enter the gymnasium even though the gymnasium was ten blocks\naway from me, I couldn't get in because I had a quota. I passed I understand my entry\nexam, but I couldn't get in. That was back in 1938. So, in order to continue my studies I\nhad to move on somewhere else and I had to go to another gymnasium back on Louve on\nStreet. It was known as the Jewish gymnasium. Going back to '38, '38\nwas a fairly peaceful years for our family but it was a hardship because we couldn't meet\nthe loans that my father apparently incurred. So, things were difficult. My oldest brother\nAbe who was in Warsaw, he finished his master's degree and he came back home and he\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

Eli who was two years older than I was, he was more enterprising but for his\nown good. He was not part of -- he would try to help stabilize the family but we used to\nlove each other and we used to fight each other and we used to do things that 13, 14 year\nold boys used to do. Abe on the other hand was much older that we were. He was older\nthan I by ten years so he was more a Serious person and he had very little in common\nwith us other than try to take over the father figure, which he didn't succeed in many\nways. In 1938, in 1939 things were getting worse in terms of what I recall there were\nquite a few refugees who would be coming from the western part of Poland especially\nthose Jews who were exiled from Germany who came from Poland and somehow they\ndidn't stay long enough in the western part of Poland and they kept on moving and settled\ndown in our place in Louve. This was in '39 and it wasn't really that bad yet, yet they\ncame the German Jews in thousands and settled down in Poland.",
        "A: I was born in 1925, October 29, 1925.",
        "A: No, I did not. We had people who used to take care of that, but as I mentioned before our\nenterprise, or the winery, wasn't that much as busy I think in 1934 or 1935 so I didn't\nwork. The only time I went to the cellar or to the winery 1s to see the process of making\nwine, how they were stirring the wine and to smell the wonderful smell that still persists\nin the winemakers. They were there, of course, I recall we had a winery that took space a\nwhole block because that whole block used to belong to us. Underneath in the cellar\nunder the whole block was the whole winery. I recall that barrels where the wine was\nstored for aging was stacked four or five barrels stacked high. They were smaller. They\nwere not the 55 gallon barrels which is the common size here in the United States but I\nrecall they were maybe 35 gallons. This was the standard barrel at that time to age honey\nwine. I don't recall how long they were aging but that smell and that wonderful aroma\ncontributed from the honey it was still there. But in 1934 and 1935 we were all gone and\nI don't know who took over our business. It could have been that my uncles had took it\nover.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Very little. There's only one event that I recall about my father when I was four years old.\nHe had a beautiful flag, eight or nine rooms and each room was designated for a certain\npurpose. Beside the bedroom and the dining room we had what we used to call salon\nwhich is a large area and we had a special reception place for certain events or for our\nfriends of the family. So, we had a fairly large flag. My grandfather who actually brought\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview. The recording is the primary source document, not this transcript.

That was my family, the\nimmediate family. Our immediate family consisted of our three brothers, my mother, my\naunt Miriam and my grandfather. My grandfather brought me up. He was in a way a\nphilosopher on his own. He was a self taught mathematician. He was a true philosopher.\nNot only would he be reading philosophy books but he also was a scholar in his own\nmind with the tumult and all the laws of Jewish rights. He would get up in the morning\nfour o'clock in the morning and he would be on his way to study in the synagogue. I\nknew that he would wake us up because he would be coughing. Whenever he woke up he\nwould start coughing because he was a heavy smoker and when he left I didn't hear any\ncoughing any more. So, he did traditional things with him. He would get up and go to our\nsynagogue. We used to call it a . He would stay there until from four to\nseven, seven thirty and by that time he would come home and wake us up and go and\nprepare ourselves to go to school. My grandfather, he was very helpful. He actually\nprepared me for my bar mitzvah. He was very fluent in Hebrew and in German and of\ncourse other languages like Polish and Ukrainian. But his special language was Hebrew\nand German. By profession he was a printer. He came from which is\nsouth of Louve. He did have one sister I think and he had some family somewhere in\nRomania. I don't know that much about grandfather's side because I never met his sister,\nbut I remember back in 1938 that somebody from which is from\nRomania, came to visit us and we knew then that there was a cousin from grandfather's\nside that they live in Romania. He had a good life what I recalled even though it was\ndifficult from a national point of view, but it was close. We were one family. We had a\ngood rapport and a good relationship with our uncles. The other brewery in\nthat was right across our street so we had a major industrial park if you will of breweries.\nIt was the Isaac Brewery and there was the Brewery and then there was a\nBrewery and we were all together in it. It was good. I recall the way we\nwere distributing our wine to different stores. We had a wagon and horses and we would\nbe delivering wine so often. I used to like to go to the barn and every so often just to be\ntogether with the horses. So, the whole where we used to live, we used to\nlive on which is a normal whole block that compares with any block\nin the United States, it was all one brewery. We were sort of like a corner house which\nwas a three story corner house that borders on and .\nThat was the main road in the Louve that carried on for a number of miles. The\nis sort of almost like a district, an area where Jews used to live. It was a\ndominant area for Jewish life. It had many synagogues. In all, the Jewish people used to\ncongregate right there. I don't know how many thousands of families who are there, but\nthere are basically, it was the majority in . The minority in that area\nwere mostly Ukrainians and there was some Poles. There were more Ukrainians in our\narea than there were Poles. This is not to say that this was typical for In\nour area it was typical. The main activity in was on Friday where all the\npeasants or all the farmers would come and sell their goods, produce mostly. We had a\nfarmer that would come and deliver every Friday, sometimes Thursdays, but mostly\nFridays, dairy and the milk and the butters and the produce. The potatoes for winter time.\nThe cabbages, all that stuff because was the main outlet for those\nfarmers. Of course, we were doing also business at the same time.

My mother would be purchasing from week to week produce, but\nfor the groceries she would go to a special store where it would specialize in Jewish food.\nIt was a vibrant area for Jews to live. It was very interesting and when the market the\nfarmer's market was over by Friday night, Friday evening as a matter of fact, you would\nsee everything was depleted. The whole area was quiet because Friday night we would be\ngoing to synagogue, so the area was depleted. Saturday it was not as fortuitous but it was\nstill kind of vibrant, mostly for the farmers who need to do some other shopping. So the\nwhole weekend was vibrant and active when it came to Sunday, Sunday was much much\nquieter. Although the Jewish life continued. When the life in those days and I'm saying\n'38 and '39 was quite active it was also troublesome. Because we wouldn't be completely\nfree of any problems. Any rumor that would install it would be quite dominant in our\nlives. The rumors were obviously of what happened in Germany and what happened in\nsome other countries like in Romania or Russia although we knew very little of Russia\nbut there were rumors, and he rumors were that Hitler was making statements that\naffected us automatically. There was a movement in Polish society to promote the\nanti-semitism. There was a part of that and anti-semitism was very dominant already in\nLouve and it was moving toward the end that we were worried. We didn't know whether\nwe had to take any action. In fact we didn't take any action other than we had a way of\nsaying let's wait and see what any troubles would be forthcoming. In 1939 it was a year\nthat we will remember the rest of our lives because it's the year the war broke out. I don't\nremember other than I recall when the war broke out it was a time where\nthe was bombarded. All the houses, one bomb hit our house. We were\nthen in our basement, actually in the cellar was where the winery was, but we no longer\nhad the winery but we had the cellar. A bomb hit just a part of our house, just a part of it,\nbut it was -- the damage was done not directly to our houses in general, but the staircase,\nfor example, which were concrete staircases, were they were marked and there were\nsome splits in it, although we didn't think anything looked collapsed, but there was\ndamage in it already. When we were in the cellar we had some other friends and some\npeople were in the cellar and we felt we are in trouble when we got out and it was a while\nthat I got out with Abe my older brother to see the damage. We didn't see any fire.\nNothing was really down other than one portion was hit and there were some other\nbuildings that were attached to our house and we checked that and I remember my\nbrother said well, there's not much damage to our hiding place. So, that I recall that we\nwere hit by a bomb. Apparently it wasn't a large bomb, but from there on, that was the\nbeginning of the war and in probably the next few days things had happened that Poland\nwas divided into two major areas with the lights somewhere west of Louve and the\nRussians came in. This was a new era that we began. The Russians occupied the eastern\npart of and was part of that territory. I recall when the tanks\nwere rolling down from coming from and they were\nhuge, huge, I have never seen in my life huge tanks and apparently they didn't have to\nfight anyone because the Polish army was not in our immediate area. If they were they\nwere somewhere else. So, there was no conquest to be bragged about. They kept on\nmoving, and they occupied and our immediate lifestyle had not\nchanged other than that in the next few weeks there was a proclamation of I think it was\nin a few weeks that all the major homes and businesses were confiscated and we had a\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

And probably we did not have to pay any taxes any more because\nthis was our main concern pervious, because my mother always had to come out with\nmoney for the loans we had incurred some years ago. So, that was a relief in a way. The\nbig question was how do you make a living. My mother didn't see how her facial with the\narmy showed that she was concerned about those things. Eli was basically two years\nolder than I was. He wasn't much concerned about the family as much as he wanted to\nfind himself, and he tried different approaches. He didn't feel like going to the\ngymnasium. He never cared for that. My older brother Abe was concerned because he\nwas one of the intellegencias and there were rumors that the Russians are rounding up the\nintelligencias for reasons that I don't understand. They would put them in prison which\nwas on -- I recall that prison being called . Whether they were arrested\nor not I'm not quite sure, but he was with us at home. During that period of time, 1939\nand into 1940, 1941, there was a period that I don't recall too much about Abe as much as\nEli. I continued to study. I continued to go to school, the gymnasium until that time. The\nsubjects my studies were now basically new. First of all since Jewish -- this was a Jewish\ngymnasium, we were told that now we are going to be learning Yiddish language. That\nwas a surprise. In addition to Yiddish language we also had Russian language along with\nthe Polish language, along with the German language, which was okay. My mother also\nmakes sure that she wanted me to learn the English language and the French language.\nShe used to, back in '39, she sent for me a special tutor for French and English. I was\nbetter in English than I was in French. That's how I picked up some of my English\nlanguage. But in the Jewish gymnasium we picked up two more languages and I was\nquite proficient in Yiddish, although the Yiddish alphabet is the same as the Hebrew\nalphabet. You actually write in Yiddish the way you pronounce it. In the Russian\nlanguage it was very similar to the Ukrainian language so I was also pretty much aware\nof that language, so we kept on going with our normal, normal studies with exception that\nwe picked up two more languages. The life under the Russians don't have too many bad\nrecollections other than that during that period of time more since Poland was divided\ninto two areas, the German area which 1s the line, quite a few refugees were coming more\nso from the western part of Poland to our area. Of course the Germans occupied the\nwestern Poland so they were directly under the German authority. And Jews were fleeing\nfrom that area. I recall that in my class in we received at least three\nGerman students one was from , one was from Berlin, two were from\nBerlin and one from . And there was another fellow who was also a\nstudent. He was from Czechoslovakia. I don't know he escaped probably from\nCzechoslovakia, but not Czechoslovakia per se. He was from the Bohemia part that was\noccupied by the Germans. He escaped into Poland and then to the western part of Poland.\nHe came to us to the Russian occupied part. In all, they were very jolly fellows. I was 14\nor 15 at that time and of course the fellows from Berlin they tried to speak either Polish\nor Russian and they had a horrible accent and they just couldn't get through because their\nRussian language and the German language they just don't put together. They used to\npronounce things in German that the pronunciation it was funny for us to listen to them,\nbut the were wonderful fellows, very, very good boys.\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

        "A: No, they did not elaborate other than would I think would happen was the whole family\nescaped Germany to Poland so there were no problems with the family and they hardly\nspoke about any events that involved them. They were boys. They were my age. They\nwere more interested in soccer games. They were more interested in learning the\nlanguage, how to deal with us because we were actually and they were the\nGermans so we were basically -- they were not even of Jewish nature. We were Jews. We\nknew the Hebrew. We knew the laws. They were not that much involved. They didn't\ncare about that. Not that we cared either because we were actually just a part of our lives.\nWe were not frightened to bring them into our way of life. They had their way of life. So,\nthey did not mention anything of their event. The refugees who were coming in more and\nmore from the western part, from Poland, we felt that we better slowly but surely being\noverwhelmed with those people and the reports that they brought from the western part of\nPoland was just bad. They were claiming that the concentration camps are being\nestablished. they were claiming that there's a terrible persecution going on. We thought in\nbecause we knew about persecution that persecution -- because we didn't\nhave the same rights as the Poles of for that matter the Ukraine, but these were true\npersecutions they were telling us. We didn't understand what a concentration camp\nmeans. It was a hearsay and in fact you just didn't believe that. It wasn't a part that he\nwould accept that, it just wasn't acceptable. We didn't know what people would do in\nconcentration camp let alone the establishment and how do you so things people ignored\nthat part. But as they were coming, more by thousands, the shed that we used to have at\nhome, we have opened up, the salon and the special section room. We gave it up for them\nto dwell on it, to live in there. We had a large kitchen and we offered them everything we\nhad. They stayed with us. Some of them took to work. Some of them moved out on their\nown, mostly they were not families, they were mostly single people men and women who\ncame who escaped and tried a new life maybe it was temporary because they had left\nsome other people back home wherever their home was. There was quite a few from\n, from Warsaw from -- I don't recall the small towns in the western part\nof Poland. So, they stayed with us for a number of months until one day, one night a\nknock at the door, we had a big house in . It was the Russians came in and\nthey forced themselves into our place and they basically took all of these refugees. That\nwas traveling maybe 1940 there was a time when there was a major gathering, a major\nexpulsion of the refugees from to Russia. And we befriended some\npeople there, so we were not far away from the main station. I run into that, and they put\nthem in boxcars and a cattle trains, cars and they were locked up over there. That's how\nthey were going to transport them from to east to Russia. We couldn't\ndo anything about it. I knew they were crying, really crying. What did they do wrong?\nThese were Russians and this was the main event that I recall that the Russians did to the\nJews. They didn't kill them, but they put them away. We found out later that they were\nsent to and to different parts of Russia. I never met them again. Life in\ncontinued after that expulsion until another war broke out and that\nwas in 1941 and that was the time when the main when the Germans invaded\n.

We soon found out that the first few\nweeks in Louve after the German occupation of Louve, there were quite a few robberies\nand personal insults and personal beatings of Jews by the Ukrainians. Some of them were\nmaybe Ukrainians, some of them were maybe Polish, but it was very dangerous to go out.\nIt was very dangerous to walk on the street. Soon, we had a curfew that would not allow\nthe Jews to walk after certain hours, evening. That was maybe just as good, but the\nproblem that we actually had when it came to night, that was the time when the main\nrobberies and the main assaults on Jewish families began. It was the night first 1:00, then\n2:00, then 3:00 in the morning. They would rush into the house and if they couldn't find\nanything, they would destroy or maim people. Only during the night could you hear the\nnight cries, the night help rescue, seeking help. This was horrible right during the night.\nWe, at home we were basically safe because on the first floor we had a tenant that used to\nlive and apparently he was a . He was half German and half Polish, I think.\nThey occupied that level and they actually controlled the gate, not that he would help us\ndirectly but people know that somebody's -- Snyder I think was his name, he lived in that\nhouse, so we were basically protected. But you could hear at night the horrible screams\nbeing robbed and maimed and so on. It was a very bad period, but it wasn't getting better\nbecause every week there would be new regulations and new instructions and at one point\nand I don't recall exactly the month, we got instructions that we had to vacate the\npremises, the homes, where we used to live, and move into a small ghetto that was\n. To find a dwelling and to move out, and we didn't have that much\ntime. The furniture, the paintings, the rugs that we had, some of that Snyder took in his\npossession. He felt where we were going we wouldn't need them. All the beautiful\npaintings my father bought in Vienna, and the rugs. It's immaterial now, but at that time it\nmeant a lot to us. So, we moved out with a basic one couch and some of the belongings\nthat we had from the whole flat. It was my mother, myself, I'm not sure if Eli was there.\nMy oldest brother, Abe, he was no longer with us. He was taken away just before we\nmoved out to that small ghetto. He apparently went to a hospital to get some medicine.\nHe never came back. He had to go downtown to where later on it became the major\nghetto. It seems to me it was close to the ghetto. He went there and he\nnever came back. We didn't know what happened to him. We heard that later on one\nhospital was emptied by Gestapo or by people who worked with the Gestapo. They took\nthem away. I'm not quite sure when was established.\nwasn't even at that time a bad word. But we heard . 1S\nan area where Jews were killed and it was adjacent to camp. But we\nheard that word . So, he was not with us. Eli was in and out of our area,\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview. The recording is the primary source document, not this transcript.

I'm sure he was trying to survive, trying to\nfind some angles to get out of a bad situation. We moved out to that small ghetto. A\nsecretary to our business who used to be our secretary, she used to live in that area, in that\nsmall ghetto in a free standing home and she offered her house to my mother. I don't\nknow the deal that she made with my mother but at least we were secure that we had a\nhouse to go to and that was a relief because at that time it was very difficult to get an area\nbecause you're talking many thousands of people had to move out of one area to another\narea where you have a comparable exchange of dwellings. It wa questionable, but we had\nit. With our house in that free standing house and I recall there were maybe three rooms\nperhaps and there was another family that moved in with us. Now, it was a period of time\nthat we acclimated ourselves into this new ghetto. The faces that we didn't know before\nall of a sudden we knew them very well. They were all Jews. The way I understand that a\nJewish police was formed who supposed to bring law and order in the ghetto and our\nghetto. We were not much concerned with them, other than there was\nanother area that we were quite ambivalent that we did not know what that all means to\nus. We all of a sudden have a new life in a new ghetto, new people, new surroundings.\nThe future, who knows what it's going to bring. The rumors were actually in that ghetto\nthat those people who work will be much better off if they don't work, meaning that you\nbetter have a place to work and then you'll be getting some kind of identification card that\nwill help you survive. Survival really didn't mean too much to us other than it came to the\npoint where you had to survive somehow not knowing of camps or anything of that that\nwe are immediately placed in jeopardy of our lives. That didn't grasp yet. We weren't\ninvolved in that. We were involved mostly 1n our personal belonging, in our personal\nlifestyle and being attacked by hoodlums because you are a Jew you are no longer a\nhuman being. The ghetto didn't mean to us that this was the end of our line. It was\nperhaps the end of persecution by the Ukrainians. You were not directly confronted with\nthe physical abuse, the physical maiming of people. The rumors were you better get\nwork. That was in '41. I was 16 years old, and I wasn't -- didn't know where to find work.\nWhere do you find work in ghetto and I run across a friend of mine who told me that\nthere is a place on Street who -- and they called it that\nthey're looking for some workers, but he felt that I wouldn't be strong enough. I didn't\nknow what the work consisted of, but anyway it was something to look into. I went back\nto my mother and told her that there is a place that I was told that they're looking for\nsome workers and whether she would allow me to go interview. My mother didn't think\nthat she objected other than she warned me be careful. I went there. I went to\n. They called it later on . isa\nfactory or was a factory that made tar paper for the roofs and the way they were doing 1s\nyou roll out a three foot section of paper and you dunk it into asphalt. Later you roll it out\nand there are some people who were using dry sand and covering the wet asphalt and that\nbecomes a tar paper. What they were looking for workers who could carry balls of paper\n75 to 80 kilos of paper to go from one place, say from a truck to the depot that they had\nright in the back, or storage place, and I wasn't sure that I could do that, but if that meant\nto have an 1.d. and be protected I better do it. I walked into the office and told them that I\nwould like this work if they could have me. There was man called Fessel. He was a Jew\nfrom Slazia, it was in Poland, and he looked at me and close to him there was a foreman,\na Polish foreman. I forget his name and he asked me can you use this young fellow and\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview. The recording is the primary source document, not this transcript.

He took me out and tested me out, and he\nselected the largest ball, 75 kilos. Every ball was numbered and I picked it up and I\ncarried it and I dropped it the place where he wanted me to drop it and he hired me on the\nspot. You can work with us. It was basically not a relief for me other than that I felt that\nI'm employable. I went back home told my mom that I have a job and maybe we'll be\nmore secure. From there on it was very little things I recall other than I was working\nevery day with them going back from ghetto to or .\nIt's maybe a 20 minute walk, maybe 30 minutes. So, at that time, I was going back and\nforth and my mother all day long I would be working and evening I would be coming\nhome. At the same time I was able to purchase some produce at the place I used to work,\nlike tomatoes and maybe bread although we could buy some bread but we were rationed\nin ghetto. So, it was helpful. I don't recall at what point they have established living\nquarters in . It was some time later than -- I'm trying to recall\nsomething which I'm not quite at ease with me. Let me say the time sometime in August\nof 19-- 1t was in '42 already. I did work a number of months. It seems to me going back\nfrom ghetto to and here I'm blank a certain period of time that I\ncannot recall. The image that comes to my mind now is August the action. We called it\n, Where that small ghetto in was basically almost\nevacuated. Practically all the Jews were taken and I was at that time in\n, was located on Z6tkiewska Street. The main\nentrance was from which was the main thorough between north and\nsouth. And it was the area which would be within a couple blocks of where my home\nused to be, a couple blocks from my uncle's it used to be and so on. There was a time I\nrecall when the action came about in the ghetto and it was close to\nevening. Somebody rushed into the factory one of our workers. They were moving them\nout to the street. We moved out, I moved out immediately to the gate to see what we\nwanted to see. We saw what we didn't want to see, thousands and thousands of ghetto\npeople were moving and going to Street. I looked and I saw some of\nmy friends. My friends, dear friends that I used to play with. Some acquaintances. I was\nlooking for my mother. I didn't see her, didn't find her. It was maybe twenty rows and\nmiles of people. They were slowly marching. They were guarded by Ukrainian\n. I didn't see any Germans. Maybe in the back, but I didn't see them.\nMostly Ukrainian on each side. I didn't see the front either. I came right in the middle. I\ndidn't see the beginning the march, I didn't see the end of the march. I just kept on seeing\nthe area where it was visible to me from that narrow gate. They didn't see me. I saw them\nbecause the gate was actually locked, the gate. It was going on for hours\nand hours because there was a slow march. Finally it ended. People were looking from\nthe windows because all was inhabited by Ukrainians and Poles,\nsecond third stories, they're all looking at them. It was a very grim sight. I don't recall -- it\nwas the following day that I decided to go to the ghetto. Although they warned me not to\ngo, they I mean Fessel and the director of the factory. At that point in time I did already\nhave my 1.d., the identification card. I don't recall whether I had to wear a band or not. I\nprobably did, but I don't recall that. But I got into ghetto because I wanted to see what\nhappened to my mother. I rushed into the house. The house was empty but the hiding\nplace where we had the hiding place for my mother was a couch. A couch consisted of a\nframe and on top of the frame there was this soft part which is the couch. You couldn't\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

The frame and the\ncouch, the upper part was one unit. That's why when there was any action, my mother\nwould be hiding there. I would make sure of that. When I got home, the upper part was\nmoved so I was scared of that. When I cried out for my mother she came to life. She was\nthere. She was on the inside of the couch so even it was moved, she was in that area. She\nwas wrapped around in a blanket, a dark blanket. So even though they were looking for\nher, they didn't find her. She was there, so we had our moment, with my mother. A\nnumber of weeks went by before another action came about. I think during that action I\nlost my mother, and I don't know how they got her. So, she was gone. Eli was gone, Abe\nwas gone. It was a part of that they have then decided to establish a living quarters, I\nthink, on the premises of ;",
        "A: Sure.",
        "A: My grandfather died during the Russian time. He died -- I don't recall but it was during\nthe Russian occupation and he was buried in a grave yard. We felt that this was a very\ntimely death for my grandfather to die, not to see everything. But it was definitely during\nthe Russian occupation that we were not harassed at that time. Aunt Miriam she stayed\nwith us. Aunt Miriam did not have a good rapport with my mother, but at the time of that\nbad time, they changed their minds or they have relaxed their anger or whatever it was,\nthey were back together, at least on a talking basis. If I recall, she moved with us to the\nsmall ghetto. At what point she was taken I don't recall. But I don't recall her that much\nalthough I really liked her. She was one of the intellegencias, but she was a strange\nperson to many eyes, but not to me. I was her favorite, but what happened to her, I don't\nknow. I don't recall. Whether she was taken, the action I don't know because from there\non I did not see her. I don't recall where she went.",
        "A: No. Eli was very special to me. He was 17, 18 at that time and he had his own friends. He\nhad many girlfriends. He always looking for money. He needed money. I was more of a\nfamily son. I was closer to my mother and assuring that everything was under control and\nEli was not the opposite of me and he wasn't completely with me as I would like him to\nbe. Abe was completely different. He was much older than we were. He was ten years\nolder. He had his own friends. He had very little to do with us. He would want to talk to\nme other than in Hebrew. He despised Polish language, so he would only speak Hebrew\nto me, and I had to respond to him also in Hebrew. Although my Hebrew wasn't that\ngood, but I carried on a conversation with him. It was something that I wanted to impress\nmy brother Abe at one point in time there was a Serbian or Yugoslavian king or\nRumanian king that abdicated sometime in 1938 and I tried to tell him this in Hebrew.

Abe was a little bit on the snobbish side because\nhe was always with his friends talking about zionism, talking about the world's affairs.\nHe tried to settle all the world's affairs. Eli was completely different from both of us. He\nwas more or like a happy go lucky fellow. He wanted to live now not tomorrow. Now is\nthe day. Since he didn't have that much, he would take certain things from home and sell\nit to satisfy his needs, and I was fighting with him. I wasn't angry with him, but I tried to\npreserve things that the family had. He understood that very well, but he was my favorite\nbrother because maybe we were fighting all the time and we loved each other and he used\nto give me some secrets and at night he used to take me outside the house and we would\nbe smoking. So, I kept things in secret. He was very good natured, though. He cared\nabout us. Now, Eli was taken away from us some time. I really don't know when. He was\ntaken away from that small ghetto. Now I heard that Eli was in concentration camp in\n. We weren't sure that this was a death camp, but it was very\nfearsome place to be in. The fact that we heard that and people are being\nkilled there. Even though that I heard that Eli 1s there, I felt always that when Eli is ina\ntight spot he always will get out. At least I hoped so. When established\nthe living quarters, I was one of them. We were a crew of 40 Jews only men. It was a\nplace where we felt was a very safe place at least for the time being. Even it was safe\nplace that we had within the 40 people there were certain groups that were more confined\nwith each other than others. Probably psychologists would love to study those groups. I\nwas basically with a group of boys my age. The 16, 17, and 18 and the question is how do\nwe get some cigarettes. That was the main thing at that time. The ghetto was gone. There\nwas nothing that I can do any more in ghetto. I didn't want to go anymore there. As a\nmatter of fact 1t was a Jew free area. The only thing that was dominant was actually the\ndowntown ghetto on Street and Street. That was the\narea. I did not know too much about things that surrounded us because we were confined\nin a given area and the only thing that we heard was the rumors that would come in. Even\npapers didn't come in. We didn't have any papers. So, the 40 Jews, even though we were\ntogether, they had such secrets. I didn't know what the secrets were. I learned later on\napparently they built an extra wall. There was a basement where we used to live. On top\nthere was the factory and the basement was the living quarters and in that basement they\nerected a wall which was done sometime probably before the action in August. I didn't\nknow that. Nobody let me know that. So, a lot of things -- in a way I was a little angry\nthat they didn't let me know that because I could have brought in my mother, into the\nhiding place. It was a hiding place. It was a whole wall and in that false wall, false\npartition, it was covered with wood, piles of cut wood that when at night at 12:00, 1:00\nthey would remove the wood and people would walk out for fresh air. Even at that time I\ndidn't know that. I found that out later. When I was living in time where maybe I was too\nambivalent, to naive of knowing what was going on. But, they were Jews. Families of\nsome of these 40 people and when I learned later on that there is a hiding place and I just\nhoped that Eli would be alive so I could bring him here. My work at that factory\nconsisted of working first with the bales, carrying the bales and sometimes just dusting\nthe asphalt with the dry sand. But then later on since I liked so much horses, we had a\nwagon there with horses that we would transport asphalt into the factory. There was one\nfellow who was we used to call the foreman. He took care of the horses and the wagon\nand he would transport the goods, certain asphalt and some of them he would bring also\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

I really enjoyed that. I'd rather work with horses\nthan work in the factory. The foreman of the factory liked also bunnies, rabbits. He had a\ncage of rabbits in the stall in the barn and he asked me to take care of them. So, I had the\nhorses now and I had the rabbits and I used to take care of them. It was pleasant. I liked\nto work with animals and at the same time I was the helper of . Lused to\ncall him . He was a very nice fellow. A very straightforward fellow. He was\nUkrainian. He did not see me as a Jew. I was Wilek to him and he was to\nme. I didn't care that he was Ukrainian even though that I knew that the Ukrainians killed\nJews and abused Jews and vice versa. He saw me as Wilek, a fellow. So, he was very\nnice to me, he was human. We liked each other. So, I was his assistant in doing anything\nthat the factory needed, to take care of. Caring for the animals but also transporting\nasphalt. This was going on for a number of months. Now, I had an opportunity to go out\nof the factory with him and see what was going on. Now, when I drove with him on the\nwagon, I did not have a band, I don't think so because I was part of the\n. SO, we used to drive oh maybe a kilometer or so to get the\nasphalt. We had a refinery not far from us within a kilometer or so. And that refinery\nthere was an area where there was a refinery, there was also a slaughter house for\nanimals. In that refinery, the bi product of the refinery is asphalt and they would pour out\nthe byproduct into an area, a depleted area a narrow area not too deep and what we would\nbe doing 1s we would be cutting them in blocks because they were solid and carry them\non top of the wagon and bring them back to the factory.\nEnd of Tape #2\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

        "A: So we used to bring the asphalt back to the factory and of course in the process of asphalt\nbeing liquified later on in huge ovens and that's how we get the process of that tar onto\nthe paper. That was my work in , working with day in\nand day out. We were able to drive from our factory to maybe two or three different\nstreets, and of course at that time Louve, that area any way, was already Jew free. There\nwere no Jews there anymore. Perhaps some were hidden, but there were no visible Jews.\nThe place was basically very quiet. It wasn't vibrant as it used to be the times that I recall\nback in '38 and '39. We were doing this a number of months and Peter and I we were very\nmuch befriended. We were talking about at times that it could happen that one of these\ndays they will take me away. The discussion was how do I survive. How do I get out of\nthis place. I did not have good moves ahead of me. I did not see too many visions, what is\na good way of doing it. In back of our factory there were tracks and those tracks you\ncould see every so often Hungarian troops going somewhere and the thought that came to\nmy mind, wouldn't it be nice if I knew some Hungarian language and just jumped in the\ncart and said hey, I'm one of you. But it was just a dream. Back with Peter, I told Peter\nwhat's a good way of surviving. He didn't give me a good answer. One day he came and\ntold me, you know Wilek, if I could hide you I would do that, but I can't trust my wife. I\nthanked him for the offer or his thoughts. We had a farmer that would deliver some\nproduce over a number of years and he was a very good friend of ours. He looked me up\nin , and he told me that if you need a place come to us. So, in that\npreparation I was very glad that he offered me a place to hide because I was at his house\nback on the farm a number of years ago, a number of times on my vacation. He would\ntake me in to . He had great piergos, it's dumplings with good stuffing. His\nwife used to make. I used to ride on the horses with him and take care of his cows. It was\njust fun for me to do that at that time. So, he came back, and he looked me up and he\noffered me, I had hope. There's a place to go. I had a duffle bag, a leather duffle bag and I\nput in some of my clothing, some of my things for him to have it just in case I do get to\nescape and get to his place. So, at least I have a place to go. Meanwhile I was working\nwith Peter. Because I wasn't sure where his farm was, I knew but I really didn't know\nwhere his farm was, and one day, Peter looks at me and says Wilek come over here. Do\nyou see this lady? There was a lady that was limping that was going to the office. I said\nyes I see her. I remember her. I remember her well. He told me that he delivered a wagon\nof potatoes there. That was some time early part of 1943 that he delivered a wagon of\npotatoes. It was a custom to buy potatoes in huge quantities for winter time and so on.\nThat was the way we did that in Louve. I asked him what makes him think that she's the\none. I mean how do I know. I don't know but remember her and I'll give you an address\nthat in case something happens here, you go there. Because he felt at that time that the\ndirector Fessel is grooming her or grooming this place for him to hide. I took this as a\ngood omen and I felt maybe he's got something there. It was a certain time within that\nperiod of time. It was just before the Warsaw ghetto that it was in April sometime that I\nremember that two partisans -- a partisan is a person who's a guerrilla warrior. They used\nto belong to a Polish underground, and they spoke to our leadership in to\njoin their partisan group. I'm not quite sure what transpired but I think our leadership\nrejected them. They didn't trust them. It was during that period of time that things are\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

We knew\nabout Warsaw and we knew they were fighting. We also knew that the downtown ghetto\nis getting tighter and tighter. Very few Jews you could see being escorted on the street,\nless and less because until that time you see a group escorted by the militia. People from\nghetto to work from work back to ghetto. Of course we were stationary. The group of the\n40 Jews. We were stationary. We live right then and but we see them once in a while and\nsometimes I saw on my wagon these groups going back and forth. I mentioned before this\nslaughter house and there was one Jew who used to work there and as we were cutting\nthe asphalt and that Jew across the field would look and wave to me and I would go there\ntalk to him and ask him what his business was while he goes back and forth from the\nslaughter house back to ghetto. But at the same time, he offered me some meat to take it\nwith me so I would bring that meat back home. Home meaning my\npeople. I would bring that. Occasionally I would be going from to\nghetto just to go there. I didn't have anyone there. Maybe I would be going with a friend\nof mine because he wanted to accompany, but I recall everytime I would be going there, I\nwouldn't be going there too often, but I was given an armband with a W letter which was\nfor meaning that we were working for the , the army, even\nthough that manager of our factory was a captain in air force which doesn't make sense\nbut that's the way it was. He apparently was very good, very good. A reasonable human\nbeing. He had an excellent rapport with Fessel. He was I think captain in the air force. He\nwas the one who would warn us when major problems occurred. At one point, he would\nwarn us that we were about to be picked up by the guards. We would move out. The way\nI dressed myself -- I was dressed myself as a typical farmer. This is the way I could\ndisguise myself the best, with long boots, with special boot type slacks. They're specially\ncurved that the boot accepts the slacks and with a hat and a cigarette in my mouth. I used\nto roll my own cigarettes so I was a typical farmer. The first time that we were going to\nbe picked up I just left. I had no where to go. Ghetto was opened. You could go in to\nghetto but who wants to go into ghetto. So I went downtown on Street\nwhere I used to go with friends of mine and prominent the area when we used to be\nyoung boys and free of troubles. It was like three or four o'clock or two o'clock,\nsomething right afternoon that I ran off from and there was very little\nyou could do downtown other than be picked up by Ukrainians or somebody who\nrecognized me. I was not, but my safe thing was to do was go to a movie house, so I went\nto a movie house just to kill time. After that time thinking just a few minutes ahead, what\nam I going to do next? I didn't have the answer. I had to do things that were natural in\nthat point in time. I saw a movie, another movie, it was newsreel of cutting. This was\nwhere the Germans showed how the 20,000, or 40,000 Polish officers were killed. The\nRussians claimed that the Germans killed them. The Germans claim that the Russians\nkilled them. This was the time that Saw that excerpt. I was all engrossed in that because\nfor the first time I hear there was a cutting, there was a slaughter of Polish officers but\nfrom the German side. After the movie, I went out and I don't know what time it was but\nI saw a column of Jews were going to ghetto. I put my armband and I joined them. That\nis the only place that I can go right now short of being right down town without Jews. So,\nI joined them and I went over there to ghetto. There was probably a few weeks after the\nWarsaw ghetto or around that time. I knew that I had to do something very drastic soon,\nbut didn't have the opportunity yet. I went back to ghetto. The ghetto was so crowded I\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview. The recording is the primary source document, not this transcript.

In\nother words, living in in my own bunk in the basement with only 40\nJews was a paradise from what I have seen over here. People were living in the street.\nJust a terrible situation. No clothing, torn clothing, and a lady that I recognized who used\nto live on the same street, she was a daughter of a grocer. A very pretty young lady, she\nwas probably in her 30s, I think. She became a prostitute in ghetto. But she took me in\nimmediately. She was my neighbor, and she gave me some slotties and I left went to\nanother place to another friends, the same surroundings, and I walked into an area where\nsome older young men were looking for how do you get out of ghetto. How do you join\nthe partisans. And I was right in the midst of it. On suggestion was we get a whole group\nwith the armbands and let some of us be the militia, the Ukrainian militia and escort that\ngroup all the way down all the way down because nobody is going to ask\nwhere are you going with this Jewish group. That was one of the questions. The other\nquestion is where do you the uniforms. Where do you get the arms, and so forth. It was a\nround robin exercise, how to you survive yourself. The following day I got word that we\nare safe. In other words I could go back to and resume my work. I went\nback. I went back to and resumed the work, but now I felt very strong.\nIt's only time before things happen. There was another major action sometime later, I\nforget when in '43, whether it was June or July, a major action and I was told that Eli was\nthere. He returned that he knew about me and during the action this was on that day\nsomeone else was going to go to ghetto also because of action, rescuing someone. I\njoined them. I said I want to go with you. I went and I took an extra armband for Eli just\nin case I catch him. I went over there and they told me the address and I went to that\nplace and there was a lady there, an empty house basically and asked her about Eli. She\nsaid he was here, but they picked him up. I came too late. I was downhearted. There was\na place that very few people should be going through this exercise. As I was walking on\nthe street, there was one fence there and I hear right on the other side of the fence, people\nwere praying with a loud voice. During the action and I kept on walking because I had to\nget out of that area. They will pick me up but I was secure because I did have the\narmband and I had the W and I had the identification stamp. I forget the stamp. It was a\nswastika stamp and I think it was a red stamp which was the most recent stamp. So I was\nsafe. I went through and I got the other people who went with me from\nand we made our exit in a hurry. At that time, I didn't see any buses anymore or any\ntrucks anymore. They finished the action for the moment so we took our exit out. I went\nback to . Eli was gone. They took him away. So there was nothing I can\ndo at this point. He's gone. The whole family is gone as a matter of fact. Now, a few\nmonths went by now and they were talking now about the liquidation of ghetto. I don't\nrecall when they had liquidated the ghetto other than one point in time just prior that we\nwere to be picked up they pronounced that Louve is Judenfrau, Jew free. No Jews live\nanymore in Louve. Now, the more I'm thinking from there on, I'm thinking more and\nmore about this lady, the limping lady. Peter gave me that address and he told me exactly\nhow to go there to get to that place. There was sometime in the morning, I forget when. It\nwas a beautiful morning as a matter of fact. The sun was out, nice and chilly. Whether it\nwas September or October, I don't know. It was sometime in the fall one day we were\ntold that 1:00 we would be picked up. Now, time was early in the morning, maybe eight,\nnine, ten. I don't know. I knew immediately that something 1s going on because Fessel\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview. The recording is the primary source document, not this transcript.

They were not moving\nyet, but they were ready to move out. I didn't even try to look down in the basement what\nis going on regardless even though you have a hiding place, I wasn't about to stay there. I\ndecided to go, to move because I didn't see any future in hiding in that place. Sooner or\nlater, probably sooner than later we were going to be discovered, so I didn't take this\nplace as a safe one. My point was 1s to get out. The question when, that is within an hour\nor so. I went to Peter. I said goodbye to him and I moved out. That was the last time I saw\nPeter. He wished me luck and I went out. I kept on walking. I don't remember all the\nstreets that I went through, I just followed certain streets and I went through a place a\nmain thorough and right on the street a friend of mine, well, not a friend but an\nacquaintance. A fellow I went to school with, to public school, Sayer his name was and\nhe saw me. He looks at me. Of course he knew that I'm Jewish and I look at him my\nquestion 1s is he going to betray me. I didn't think so. He grabbed me and we went to a\ngate, to a house and I told him I need your help. What do you need? I said I need you to\nbe here at a certain time, about three o'clock. I don't know what time it was then but there\nwas plenty of time. I thought I'd need him to go to the station to get my ticket because I\nhad my farmer in mind. But I was on my way to that lady. Just in case I didn't get any\nresults there, I'd have a chance to go there and I needed him to help me out to buy a\nticket, a train ticket. I wasn't sure how to buy it. I wasn't sure that part how to buy the\nticket, but besides I needed his help anyway if he could offer me or at least not to betray\nme. He said I'll be here at 3:00. What else do you need. I told him I didn't need anything\nother than to help me to go through that period of that hour or two. I kept on walking. I\ndidn't think that I would be betrayed by Sawyer. I didn't think so even though he was\nUkrainian. So, I kept on walking and I went to that place. At first I didn't recognize the\nhouse because he described me a certain house but when I looked at those houses, they\nall looked the same. Across the field there was barracks where the Ukrainian militia used\nto live. There was an area where I felt well, you do or you don't. I went to one house and\nI asked -- her name was Maria, and I knocked at the door, is Maria home? The person\nsays no Maria here. I'm sorry. Then I went to another door. It must have been one of\nthose houses so I went to another house. The next time and she opens the door. Maria\nwas there. Now, Maria doesn't know me. I know Maria. She was limping. She was a good\nlooking lady, probably 25 to 28, Polish. I asked her that I'd liked to see Mr. Fessel. She\nsays no Fessel in this house. I said well, probably not but please tell him that one of his\nworkers is here. She says no Fessel is not here. I said okay. I took off. Maybe I was\nmisled. I took this as a true sign I was misled my next option is to go to my farmer. I kept\non tracing my steps back, the same way and I was going to see Sawyer. As I walked\ndown I'd say a good half a mile down the road, I hear some hollering behind me. It was\nMaria with her limping legs was after me. She was hollering for me to stop. I finally\nstopped and went back, kept on walking towards her and she looked at me. You're so\nstupid and some other expletives. Come back with me. And probably I was stupid and\nshe took me back and walked me right into this room in this house where Fessel was.\nNow, my first impression was grim faces because they were not sure how I got that name,\nhow I got the address because if I could find them someone else could find them.\nObviously true, Peter could find them. This was their main concern. They weren't\nconcerned about me but about Peter. Peter as far as I have never seen him drunk. And\nPeter he was such a friend that he would never betray me. So there was no concern. I\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview. The recording is the primary source document, not this transcript.

His brother\nwas a tall, very heavy set fellow who impersonated a German captain. He had a German\novercoat and a German hat, but when I saw him, he was just Fessel, an obese fellow. It\nwas Fessel, his brother, his lady friend, two other people who I don't know how they got\nin there probably through a different route, but the route that I know how Fessel got into\nthis house was Fessel his brother, and another worker, I think Kline, who used to be his\npersonal secretary in . So at least two people from our factory, his brother\nwhich I never saw him before, his lady friend. That lady friend was a sister of that other\ncouple, that was already there apparently and another fellow that I don't know how he\ncame about there. Maybe he was completely independent but he was a lover of Maria. So\nwe had like seven people there. I think there was seven, I was the eighth one. It was a\ntime where they were concerned about their security because of Peter. The question was\nwhether or not they should send me back, back to Peter's place home and tell him no one\nwas there. So, I could go and apparently go back home to their place to secure their\nhiding place. It was stupid and it was very inconsiderate and but because they would put\nme in a double jeopardy really, because it was very difficult to travel, walk that number\nof miles to his place. They finally decided not to do that because they felt that Peter was\nmore of a friend of mine than of theirs. They left it at that. So, now I was not one of them,\nbut at least I was in a safe place for the time being. The area we were in one room I think\nmaybe it was another room, but basically I was in the front in the large room that was\ntogether with this hiding family. We had a trap door to the basement which was not in the\nwalking place but in a crawling space. We had a special area that was covered with a rock\nin case something happens we all go inside and hide ourself there. We had our food.\nApparently Fessel had enough money to supply for our existence there and apparently\npaying also Maria. I'm sure nothing went free because she demanded some money. I\ndidn't have any money so she couldn't get anything out of me, and she never asked either.\nSo, I thought things were taken care of by Fessel. The other couple they also were from\nLouve, I forget their name and that really irritates me that I don't remember those names\nbecause they're very important people because even though you're hiding and you're sort\nof in a group relationship, you were strangers. Maybe you had one thing in common, we\nare all Jews and we want to survive. There was one thing in common but different\ninterests in different projections in their lives, that was another thing. So, the dynamics of\nour group was strange, but I could listen to their conversations. I could take part of some\nof them, but Fessel was the dominant fellow who would set the tone of this group. There\nwas a point in time the ghetto was liquidated already and now there were rumors that the\nconcentration camp is being liquidated. The rumors were also that the\nRussian army is moving toward Poland, closer and closer. They weren't talking about\nimmediate occupation or immediate conquer of the territory but it was close enough that\nyou need to make a decision. Whether to stay in the hiding place or to move on. I did not\ntake any part of the decision because my action was always to stay in the hiding place. So\nthat wasn't an option that would be denied to me. The other option was whether or not to\nescape Louve all together. There was a young couple who would be coming and in\nkeeping 1n touch with us. They had Gentile papers and they had excellent Gentile features\nand they would be the ones with whom we had contact with the outside. They would\nknow how to prepare the papers, Gentile papers and how we could be rescued. Now the\nquestion was should they take me into the rescue effort moving out of Louve. They\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview. The recording is the primary source document, not this transcript.

The question was they're going to\nbe moving out, should they take me with them. I confronted that part with Fessel and I\ntold Fessel that although it wasn't his obligation towards me at all but I asked them that I\nwould like to be with them. I could always stay here, but I want to get out of Louve in\ngeneral. This is a horrible place. I don't want to be here, even in hiding. He said well,\nwe'll have to see what our resources are. We'll have to see if we can give you some\npapers. He apparently was good enough to do that for me. I was told that their plan is to\nescape ultimately to Hungary from Louve to from to\nMountains, through Slovakia to Hungary. That's the plan. I walked with\nthem all the way. I'll go with you anyplace you go. I felt that I could be of help to them if\nthey needed me. The time came sometime in the early part of December I think, maybe it\nwas in December, that we got our papers, the Gentile papers with our photographs and\nthe stamps and the my name was . I took the name of an\nacquaintance of mine from . He was a very nice fellow and I thought he\nought to have my name. So, from there on, my name was from then\non until my liberation. My religion was catholic, and everything else was true on those\npapers. My birth and where I was born, and everything else except my name and my\nreligion. From there on, there was at night prior to that by the way that was something\nvery interesting happened that I recall. You know when you are in hiding for so many\nmonths you don't know how to purchase things. How to deal with the outside although\nwe are informed by Marie where things are, how to get to the station, because now we\nhave to move from Louve, buy a ticket, and these are small items but very crucial items.\nGet out of the house, buy a ticket, go into the main station, buy a ticket and go to\n. Finding the place, and find a place and maybe a reservation for the\ntrain or not. That we did not know. Maria was not about to buy any tickets for us, so they\nasked me whether I could go on an exercise to the main station, look around, see where\nthe purchase ticket box 1s, see if there is anything unusual and go buy the tickets. Well, I\nwent there. One night they left me and I had to go from the place at night walking\nthrough the fields, through the barracks of the militia and there is a small station. I got to\nthe station and I got to the main station and to see where I could buy tickets. I went to the\nmain station, bought a ticket. On the way back to our place and to see the temperament\nand the environment we would be going through. When I came back, all the inhabitants\nof our hiding place were outside just in case to run in case they caught me and brought\nmilitia with me. They were relieved. I came back. Gave them the report and they were\nready to move on.\nEnd of Tape #3\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

        "A: I'm not quite sure. I never asked her. The only thing that I could stipulate was that she\nwas prearranged prior to that. The fact that I saw her one day in a factory walking\ntowards the office that means she was prearranged. She was given I'm almost sure that\nshe was paid, handsomely paid, by Mr. Fessel. I know other things that during my stay in\nthe hiding would be that her father would be visiting her one day in the week and that\nwas the day that they used to play similar cards to poker and he would be playing with\nFessel and Kline and Joseph evenings and it was make sure that her father would always\nbe the winner on that evening. He may be losing a little bit, but in the end when the game\nwas over, he would be coming out with money. He knew about us obviously, so he was\npaid that way through winning in this game. Other than that, I don't have any other facts,\nbut Maria a person of no wealth. She had this house and she was with Usak who told me\nwhere she used to live and maybe that was part of the attraction, but I'm not sure what\nwas the other relationship, whether she did it actually strictly for money and part of\nhuman compassion. Maybe it was a combination of both.",
        "A: It wasn't lonely because I was always active. I was very active. My mind was always\ngoing regardless what was going -- what surrounded me. My question was to myself how\ndo you get out of this place. I was fierce about it. I was driven by that. How do you get\nout and stay alive. Because I felt that I had to say something later on. Maybe this is why\nI'm here, but I felt that maybe other Jews will survive but I think I had a feeling that I had\nto say it, to say that part. So lonely, no I wasn't lonely. I was too dynamic to be lonely.\nSo, when they saw me coming back from that train station and they greeted me with\nenthusiasm at least at that point in time I was one of them and soon after we packed our\nthings whatever I had. I don't think I had anything with me. I just had just my hat, my\njacket, a scarf, my boots and I was ready to go. We went through the main station, got our\nticket. There was a direct train to . It was all night. We went through over\nnight and the following day we were already in . We were picked up by\nthe smugglers. Now, let me back off just a bit. That couple who used to come who had\ntheir connection from outside, brought the papers for all of us. That couple that I forget\ntheir name, were left behind because that's what they chose, to stay. All of us left,\nincluding the lady friend of Fessel's brother. By the way, she was pregnant. She was big\nand my estimation was that she was in the eighth month of pregnancy, but she was\nwalking and she was also determined to survive. We were on a train and got picked up\nlater on in by the smugglers who were previously arranged by this\ncouple who gave us all the false papers. We went to a place. I forgot this area at the time\nwhere it was that they took us. I remember that we had our lunch with Polish kielbasa.\nWe had a piece of bread and that evening or that night, we were going to move out of\n. Because everything else was prearranged. It was sometime December or\nit was early part of January. I don't know that period of time. It was 1944, January or\n1944 or December 1943 but very close to that time. I want to say that I am close right on\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview. The recording is the primary source document, not this transcript.

It was very cold and we took a train from\nto a small village close to Tatra Mountains. It was basically a ski\nresort and we departed from there. We picked up and we kept on walking. It was an area\nprobably that was not very much guarded by the Polish police. By the way, this area was\nstrictly guarded and governed by the Polish people, Polish police force and border police.\nThe smugglers were actually Polish. I forget their name. I forget even their faces but we\ngot through and we kept on walking through the Tatra mountains. The episode that I\nrecall was walking in the snow. It was so called and also the snow was very deep. The\nsurface of the snow was frozen so each time you walk into the snow, you like walked into\na trap because you couldn't get out. It was a very difficult walk. Now, the lady who was\npregnant she had a horrible time walking. At least I had boots but I don't recall 1f she had\nboots. So, she kept on walking and her friend, Fessel I have never seen him helping her.\nNo one else would try to help her Kline or Joseph. The older fellow Fessel, he had a heart\nproblem. He was always holding his hand on his heart, so he was incapacitated in that\nmode. I was young. I felt good. I was strong and I tried to help her. I did help her. I kept\non walking with her. At first I was walking with her and giving my shoulder to her and\nembracing her and kept on walking but at least we were in step with the rest of us. At one\npoint in time I asked Fessel to help her because I was getting tired and I asked Usak to\nhelp her or Kline to help her and they all felt that they were too tired themselves, they\nwouldn't survive the trip. I couldn't leave her. I had to walk with her and I walked her and\na long time I just carried her and I didn't see any one of the people to help her out. Such a\nshame, but we survived. We went through the Tatra mountains and got into Slovakia. At\nleast we were there. We were so called safe and the boarder police grabbed us. They took\nus into a place which I don't recall too much of it, but then later on we identified\nourselves as refugees from Poland, so we were all Polish. So, from this police area I think\nthey took us into a school. We were given lunch and had milk and we were cared for. I\ndon't recall how long we stayed there. There was another couple from Poland,\nindependently they came in. They were refugees. One was a professor I think, a Polish\nprofessor with his wife, and some other people. At that point they took a picture of us that\nI had it but I lost it during my other events but Usak got it and showed me some time\nlater. The object has to move from Slovakia now to Hungary and within a few days I\nthink we were moved from Slovakia to another border town which I have a hard time\nremembering. It was comes to my mind. Maybe I'm wrong but\nwas the border. There were some Jews -- see Hungary at that point in\ntime was not occupied. It was the early part in January. If I recall well, when I was\nalready in Hungary, Hungary was occupied in February by the Germans, maybe a later\npart of January but not the early part. We were brought in and and\nthere was a Jewish couple that took us in for that evening. It was a Friday I think and the\nreason I remember was because there was shobotz and they offered us A\nis a meal a Jewish meal with beans and chicken and carrots and all that good\nstuff. It was very good, very tasty. This was the first time I was exposed to it. I was very\ngrateful for it. The following few days from because we wanted to g into\nBudapest and that was our goal because from there on Fessel had his plans. I had my\nplans so once I got into Budapest which we got into Budapest within a week or so. I don't\nremember that period very well, but I remember that we were in Budapest and the\nquestion was we were not occupied at that time so we were free and I identified myself\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

Whether they helped us or not\nI don't recall. It was immaterial to me. What I wanted to do to identify myself that I am a\nPolish refugee and to be on their books. From there on it was just a matter of finding out\nyour level of survival. Where do you go from there. The trigger point was the time when\nthe Germans again invaded Hungary. That was the trigger point, be on the run. You had\nto run again, and where to you run. By that time I had already met some people, not\nfriends, but acquaintances, we became friends because they were in the same shoes. The\nsame problem, where do you run. One thought was to run to get into Turkey. The way\nyou could get to Turkey was through Rumania. The other thought was to run to\nSwitzerland, means you had to go through Austria. Which route do you explore. You\nexplore them both, but one is less dangerous than the other. I felt to be in Switzerland\nwould be a good deal to do, but to go you had to Austria. That was bad. A better way is to\ngo through Turkey through Rumania. I had friends that became my friends that were in\nthe underground movement and I joined them. Some of these people were mostly Jews.\nSome Polish, but that didn't seem that much of a difference because they all were going\nto run somewhere. I had more trust in my Jewish compatriots because the Polish\nunderground which was a/k Army Crawly, was a group that I wasn't sure I would be\ncomfortable with, so I went with that Jewish group. Even that group, I have some Polish\nmembers. I was in a cell. Seven people, we had seven people in our cell. I wasn't given\norders to carry out. Basically I was a courier for them, transferring papers from place to\nplace, mainly from Buddha to Paris and from Paris to Buddha and so on. At one time I\nhad to go outside Budapest, but this was a short trip and I came back. One time I had to\ncarry a gun to transfer a gun, but I was doing some carry out orders and I felt good about\nit. I'm doing something about it. Friends of mine, they were also printing false papers,\nfalse birth certificate, false statements of good standing of a given community and so on.\nChurch papers I mean a lot of things that was needed for anyone especially for Hungarian\nJews. Not specifically for Polish refugees. We were all saved so called. The question now\nis how do you help out the Hungarian Jews. They needed the papers. They did not have\nthe flexibilities that we did have because we were right outside. There was a time that\nthey were mostly almost confined to the house ghettos. They already had the stars. They\nhad to carry, we did not. We were free. I happened to get myself with the underground\nand they advised me to have two or three residents in Budapest, having a place to live in\nBuddha, in Pess -- in Buddha I had to places where to live and when I chose a place to\nlive, I used to live always with a Christian family. I was safe there. Although I tell you I\nfeel at time whenever there was a knock at the door, there was always a heart beat, an\nextra heart beat that I have developed later on in my life because somebody is knocking\nat the door at the wrong time and maybe for the right purpose or for the wrong reason as\nfar as I am concerned. So, there were time when they were raiding some areas, but this\nwas in Gentile areas. I never lived with Jewish families, not in Budapest. But there were\nraids just in general and I was one of them, but I never had an occasion to be examined\nand to be found that I had any problems with them being either question whether I was a\nGentile or not. As a matter of fact, I used to go with those families to the church every\nSunday morning, and to be one of them. It was that kind of life that we tried to provide\npapers to the Jewish people in Budapest. Papers, birth certificates, status certificates and\nso on. Being in Budapest right in the midst, I'm almost angry with myself not knowing of\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

No mention about Swedish consulates and so on. I don't know if I\nwould have gone that route, but at least I was never exposed to that. Friends of mine were\nexposed to Switzerland and they went that route. I understand he never made it. Another\nfriend went through to Turkey. It was a perfect Gentile couple who had went through a\nreverse of circumcision. They were perfect in the physiotomy. They got through\nand through Rumania but they were torpedoed in the Black Sea I\nunderstand, so they never made it either. I was still there in Budapest and the question\nwas when I'm going to get out of it and one day I have an order to go to Rumania because\nI have asked for them to send me to Rumania and to get in touch with other underground\nin Rumania. They send me and they told me who to see, when I get over the boarder,\nwhat to send them. The question was whether or not the border between Rumania and\nHungary is safe. Of course, I was told that the reason they are sending me 1s to get that\nmessage to the other side, to Rumania. Later on I found out that the reason they sent me\nwas to find out whether the border was safe. So, it was one of those things that you have\nto take your chances. I did not know about that. I found that on later on when I was sick\nand back in Germany, that I wasn't told the whole truth of the matter. Shortly I went out\nfrom Budapest directly to . I think that was the name, that was the city,\nand I had to pick up those two smugglers who were going to take me to\nRumania. The way they identified themselves is by folding hands two of them and they\nwere there, they were waiting for me. And they took me and we were not far from\n; was the village I think right on the border between Hungary\nand Rumania. They took me to a place to a barn that's all I remember, a barn. Apparently\nI didn't sleep all that long and I was so exhausted I just fell asleep before someone burst\ninto that barn and it was the Hungarian ; with the black hats\nwith a pheasant feather. From there on they interrogated me. I did not have too much with\nme. I didn't have any money. I had a couple hundred penco, which is minimal. I didn't\nhave any papers other than my own identification paper and that's all I had. I had a few\nphotographs that got me into trouble later on, but they were mostly interested about my\nspy mission. What was I carrying, why kind of message was I carrying to Rumania. This\nroute by the way was known as a route the Jews were fleeing away from Rumania. There\nwas one lady that I recognized her as being Jewish and she was in that interrogation\nroom. They whisked me away from her later on. She was crying. Later on I also saw\nthose two smugglers in another circumstances. They were beaten very severely. Their\nfaces were black and blue, so at least from my prospective they did not betray me,\nsomeone betrayed them and in turn I was also betrayed. I was interrogated for a number\nof hours. I don't know at what point they transferred me, they deliver me to the gestapo.\nBy the way, from that place they took me back to where it was the\nheadquarters of gestapo. I was escorted by the Hungarian gerdeams. The gerdarms they\nwere actually the border police but they had some other special assignment. They were\nthe leaders of the police force in Hungary. I stayed in maybe a few days\nand I was again interrogated.",
        "A: Yes, I was beaten. I was beaten terribly. In other words they put a bar between your legs\nand then your whole body is folded downwards and you're beaten on your feet. Of course\non the buttocks and so on. It was very painful, but I took it. It wasn't a big thing that I\nrecall it was impossible not to survive. They wanted to know again, what was the\nmessage that I was trying to deliver to Rumania. Being Jewish I dropped my pants, being\nJewish wasn't their concern apparently. I don't recall that. Whether they took it for\ngranted one way or the other, I was never told. The main idea for them was to move me\nas soon as possible back to Budapest and they took me back to Budapest and they put me\nin a political prison on . That was the political prison in Budapest\nand I stayed there for a number of weeks or months almost. I'm not quite sure how long.\nIt was there that I met other some of my acquaintances from Budapest. I met\nwho was the ambassador from Hungary to Poland who spoke perfect\nPolish language. I also met across the court a lady name who later on I\nfound out she was Hanna . She was very resourceful to convey her name one\nletter after another. There was a time probably that I recall because we were seeing\nat one point in time. It was a period when it was Yom Kippur. It was a\ntime that if I want to tag a point it was Yom Kippur 1944. was still alive.\ndefinitely was still alive because I corresponded with him later on after the\nliberation. I was interrogated almost daily because not only they wanted to know what\nwas my message but the unfortunate thing was they found a picture in my possession. A\nfellow that I befriended in Budapest who was from Berlin, he was also a Jewish refugee\nbut for some other reasons I befriended him and we were dating girls together and we had\nfun with him and he was in that prison also. They caught him, so they wanted to know\nwhat was my association with him. So it was a complication. I don't know what happened\nto him. I don't remember even his name but he was a very nice fellow. He was a fellow\nthat I would feel very comfortable to be a friend. Sometime later after 1944 I remember\nwe were about to be ready to be moved out of this prison and we were told that they are\ngoing to send us to some kind of camp. It must have been some time in October because I\nrecall I got in, they brought us to Auschwitz and it was on my birthday, October 29, 1944\nthat we walked on that platform. It was a train, from a regular train and they brought us\nimmediately to this office. They tattooed us. Now, my name was 193 229, no longer the\nname . There was no other names but my number. The time in Auschwitz I\nhave very little memory of it. I did work there. I did get this uniform. I had the cap, with\nthe stripe. Whether they gave me some wooden shoes I don't recall. Probably they did,\nmaybe I did have it. I did have it I think, I did have it, the wooden shoes. I was one of the\ninmates now. I was in one of the barracks, surprised that I don't even remember the\nnumber of the barrack because you must remember that. I don't remember that. Maybe I\ndon't want to remember, but we were close to that barrack where there was a special\nbarrack where things were -- a punitive barrack and I was told to stay away from it, that\nbarrack. Not much, I don't think that I was ever concerned about being gassed. My only\nquestion was how do I get out.",
        "A: I'm not sure. I'm not sure if I was a Jewish prisoner or not. It seems to me I was among\nJews so I was a Jewish prisoner. Until a given day that a barrack was empty and they\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview. The recording is the primary source document, not this transcript.

I think it was a\nleft position and then within an hour or so they pulled me back. Took me back into my\nbarrack. It was at that time that I realized that I am somehow protected and when they\nlook at my tattoo oh you're a , that's the word that I all of a sudden get to\nmy mind, a protected inmate, prisoner whatever. But what I was as a Jewish prisoner or\nnot a Jewish prisoner, I was a Jew with them and it really didn't matter at that time what\nmy status was because I was one of them. One major event that I recall wa the hanging of\nfive Polish prisoners who escaped Auschwitz. When they were brought back, they took\nout the whole camp to watch the hanging. That was sometime probably in December. It\nwas awfully cold, very cold and we stood probably until two or three o'clock in the\nmorning when the hanging took place and after the hanging normal life proceeded in the\ncamp. Then again there's a gap that I don't recall what was going on, just a matter of daily\nconsumption of the stale bread. The bread came from the transports from the wagons\nfrom the trains, but we were given stale bread. It was just at least it was something to eat.\nThe food was very terrible, very thin soup, just water. But I was not -- didn't feel that bad.\nI still felt that I could withstand the ordeals and whatever took place because they were\ntalking about soon there's going to be some liberation because Russian troops were\nmoving in closer and closer. As a matter of fact, our thought was that\nwas already taken. Maybe it was a hope, maybe it was not, but anyway they were very\nclose. So, the recreation of Auschwitz was almost eminent. January 5, comes to my mind\nbut I'll stand corrected if it was something else. We were evacuated from Auschwitz and\nwe walked a long time to another station, and I don't recall too well but we were put into\nopen carts, only men. I hadn't seen any women, and they took us out. A horrible trip, a\nhorrible trip, people were dying because of this cold exposure. I had frostbite on both\nfeet. They were persistent, I had shoes that were tight and it was very trying for me\npersonally because I never felt during the whole time that I will be able to survive. I\nalways felt that I could survive. There was a doubt in my mind that I could do it because I\ncouldn't physically move things the way I used to. We were, the train was moving\nthrough Czechoslovakia. I know because I heard that and as we were going underneath\nthe overpasses, they were covered with a lot of Czechs and they were throwing bread to\nus in the open cart. It was a good omen. I had a loaf of bread and Leon, a friend of mine\nwith whom I've been for since Budapest, that's where I met him, he was with me all along\nin the camp. He survived by the way and he was in Israel. He saw me sometime later in\nMunich. He visited me in the hospital. We went out and they kept us moving along from\nplace to place. There was no place that they had in mind. We finally wound up in\n, why I don't know. Just before we reached\nthey were discarding all the bodies from the train and people were\nmost of them were that majority was alive and there were shot on the spot. It was a huge\nmountain of the corpses from the cart. It was molestation. It was all guarded by the SS\nand their henchmen. We stayed there perhaps a few hours, they kept us back and we kept\non going, and from there on they took us from to .

He was my friend now that I tried to help him out from the\nactions in Flossenberg. It was three days and three nights of that death march towards\nDachau.
