        "Answer: Gittel.",
        "Q: Gittel, okay. Sorry. By Stephanie Blyskal on November 9\", 2008 in\nAlexandria, Virginia. I apologize for mispronouncing your name. Thank you for\nbeing interviewed \u2014 agreeing to be interviewed. Can you tell me where you were\nborn, and when?",

But she decided she was going to have a baby at a particular\nage, and no matter what the world situation was, she was gonna have that baby. And\nNovember 9, 2008\nshe thought, well, if something happens, they get taken away, her mother, my\ngrandmother, would take care of me. And then they\u2019Il come back and take over. It\nnever occurred to her that they may not come back. So \u2014",
        "Q: So, did your \u2014 did your family all live together, did your parents and your\ngrandparents live together in a \u2014 did they live in the same neighborhood?",
        "A: No, my parents did forced labor, so my grandparents took care of me. My\ngrandfather was Catholic, so my grandmother was protected while he was alive.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Anyway, So every evening my parents would come to visit me, and one day my\nformer landlady came running up and said, Frau Cheever(ph), they\u2019re taking them.\nAnd she stood on the balcony and watched my parents being taken away by the\nGestapo. And I was three months old, they were taken to Auschwitz. I have \u2014 I\nfinally found a permanent \u2014 let\u2019s say a definite death date for my father, and that\nwas March 28\", 1943. And for my paren \u2014 my mother, it just says the end of March.\nAnd just within this last month I got a lot of documents about myself and my\ngrandmother, and my parents. And is \u2014 it da\u2014 so I say, now I have absolute proof\nthat I\u2019m a survivor \u2014",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: \u2014 because I \u2014 it shows, you know, everything.\nNovember 9, 2008",

        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: \u2014 or some sort of documentation, yeah.",
        "A: Well, that\u2019s not what I just got.",
        "Q: Right, but you had \u2014 you had had it \u2014",
        "A: But this is [indecipherable] the camps.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So Auschwitz, Theresienstadt.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. But you had a birth certificate when you were born.",

        "Q: That \u2014 that \u2014",
        "A: I\u2014I got a copy years ago I needed [indecipherable] to prove my age, so yes.",
        "Q: Yeah. And so your \u2014 your grandparents were taking care of you at this point.",
        "A: Mm.",
        "Q: When a\u2014 you wound up in Theresienstadt, how \u2014 how did you get from Berlin\nto Theresienstadt?",
        "A: Well, evidently my grandmother knew she was going to go to Theresienstadt.\nShe had a family friend that worked for the underground. And the lady said, well, I\nthink \u2014 well, they called me Gitta, which was my German name. The Hitler regime\nNovember 9, 2008\ndidn\u2019t allow me to keep a German name, so it was changed to Gittel. So she says,\noh, I think it is best chance for survival was to go into camp with her, so I went to\nTheresienstadt with her. And I was in the nursery, and I was, you know, a toddler\nat that point.",
        "Q: Mm-hm, right.",
        "A: And my grandmother would scrub the sidewalks and the steps with cold water,\nand every winter her hands would turn blue, because of that experience, the rest of\nher life.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: It \u2014 that affected her that much.",
        "Q: Do you have any memor \u2014 any recollection of Theresienstadt at all?",
        "A: No. My husband thinks I\u2019m blocking it out.",
        "Q: So what do you thi \u2014 what do you think your first memory 1s, that the \u2014",
        "A: After \u2014 in Berlin \u2014",
        "Q: In Berlin.",
        "A: \u2014 going to services every Friday night, and no matter who my grandmother met,\nshe would tell my story, or our story. And I guess she didn\u2019t realize little pictures\nhave big ears, and that I knew everything. And by the time we came to the U.S.\nNovember 9, 2008\nwhen I was 13, she finally told me about my story, which I had known all along, but\ndidn't say.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And she used to say, if I\u2019d asked about my mother, you know, where\u2019s my\nmother, oh she\u2019s in America. And I have \u2014 I\u2019m in two books now. In the first book,\nthat\u2019s entitled, \u201cMy Dear Mother is in America,\u201d and \u2014 my grandmother did an\ninterview before we left Berlin, and that was the title of the story.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And she just didn\u2019t want me to know. And I \u2014 I\u2019m thinking logically, when I\ncame here I would say where she was, and I must have blocked it out because I\ndon\u2019t know the answer.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: You know, how did she, at that point, cover up that my mother was not here.",
        "Q: And what happened to your grandfather?",
        "A: He had tuberculosis and cancer and died. And that\u2019s when \u2014",
        "Q: Mm-hm, in Berlin.",
        "A: \u2014 yeah, and that\u2019s when she lost her protection and we went \u2014",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: \u2014 to Theresienstadt at that point.\nNovember 9, 2008",
        "Q: Now, was \u2014 was your grandmother practicing her faith while \u2014 or \u2014 or \u2014 before\nthe war, was she practicing her faith, or \u2014",
        "A: I think so, yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Just from what my uncle said, because his attitude was, religion\u2019s not important,\nleast of all judi \u2014",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: \u2014 least of all, Judaism. And we would go to services every Friday night, and high\nholy day service and everything. And then she\u2019d say to me, well, there can\u2019t be a\nGod if He let your mother die. So I grew up with mixed messages, in my opinion.",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: You know.",
        "Q: Being taken to services.",
        "A: I don\u2019t how much to elaborate, so I\u2019m going to let you just lead the story. I \u2014 I\ncould say more \u2014",
        "Q: No, I mean, feel free to con \u2014 I mean, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s a question that we ask a lot\nof our survivors because there is such \u2014 almost a struggle between their reality of\nwhat they experienced, and their faith. And so it\u2019s why we ask the question.",
        "A: No, we \u2014 I mean, we went to services very \u2014 you know, every week.\nNovember 9, 2008",
        "Q: And so, when you \u2014 when you came out of Theresienstadt, you were three?",
        "A: Almost three.",
        "Q: Almost three. And you \u2014 you went back to Berlin?",
        "A: We went back to the Berlin, to the same apartment we lived in before, and\nwaited for my parents to come back.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And she \u2014 you know, she just expected they\u2019d be back.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And just before we left Germany, she got copies of their death certificates.",
        "Q: When did you leave Germany\u201d",
        "A: In\u201951.",
        "Q: 51?",
        "A: I landed the day after my ninth birthday in New York. So it\u2019s a very easy day to\nremember.",
        "Q: Yeah. What \u2014 while you were still in Germany, I assume you started going to\nschool again \u2014 or started school.",
        "A: Yes, I did \u2014 I did start school.",
        "Q: And you were speaking \u2014",
        "A: I went there for like two years.\nNovember 9, 2008",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: I learned some English, so I knew, table, door and chair. Lot of English to get\nstarted in a new country.",
        "Q: Well, it\u2019s better than nothing.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: So you were \u2014 you were starting school, you were learning a little bit of English.\nDi \u2014 was \u2014 was it always your grandmothers intention to take you to the United\nStates, or \u2014 did she want to stay in Berlin?",
        "A: There was a compensation for having been in the camp. And my uncle didn\u2019t\ntalk to my grandmother for three years. She would bake every week in case he\nwould come, he didn't come. I \u2014 I think I suspect why he didn't come. I have no\nother \u2014",
        "Q: Why is that? No \u2014",
        "A: She befriended a \u2014 a gentleman, for lack of a better word, and he abused me, and\nI think that\u2019s why he stopped visiting his mother, because he was so against this\nman. This lady that worked for the underground, boo \u2014 we went back, after my\ngrandmother died, I went back to Germany with my whole family, my husband and\nmy three sons. And this lady that worked for the underground, I met her, and she\nsaid something to me, and I said, how did you know, I never told anybody, you\nNovember 9, 2008\nknow, that I was sexually abused. And she said, I suspected by the way he held you\non his lap. And so, I would think, you know, my uncle probably did, too. And, you\nknow, now I think, well, why didn't somebody do something to protect me from\nthat?",
        "Q: Mm-hm, yeah.",
        "A: So-",
        "Q: So this is while you were still in Berlin, or this is when you go to \u2014",
        "A: While I was in Berlin.",
        "Q: Do you think that influenced your grandmother\u2019s decision?",
        "A: I think that\u2019s why my uncle didn\u2019t come around \u2014",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: \u2014 and since he didn\u2019t come around, she thought my best chance for survival was\nto come to America. And like I said in my documentary, I love my children, I don\u2019t\nknow if I could give up my country for them.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: You know? So \u2014",
        "Q: Wow. And d \u2014 you \u2014 you never talked to your grandmother about the abuse? Did\nshe \u2014 do you think she knew about it?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know.\nNovember 9, 2008",
        "Q: You don\u2019t know.",
        "A: There\u2019s always, you know, like you hear, don\u2019t tell \u2014",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: \u2014 don\u2019t tell, okay, I won\u2019t.",
        "Q: So you leave \u2014 you leave Berlin, and you come \u2014",
        "A: That part really shouldn\u2019t be in [indecipherable] this is \u2014 you know.",
        "Q: You leave Berlin and you come to the United States, and you\u2019re nine years old.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: And you come to \u2014",
        "A: Well, I was eight on the ship [indecipherable]",
        "Q: On the sh \u2014 when you landed you were nine.",
        "A: Turned nine the day before we landed, right.",
        "Q: And you come to new \u2014 did you stay in New York, or where did you go after\nthat?",
        "A: My grandmother had a dot \u2014 somebody had to sponsor you.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So she had a document saying she\u2019s gonna be a housekeeper for someone in\nHackensack, New Jersey.",
        "Q: Okay.\nNovember 9, 2008",
        "A: And on the ship someone said to her, you might as well use that for toilet paper,\nbecause nobody is going to wait that long for domestic help. So we come to New\nYork, and they said, you can\u2019t stay in New York because the population is too\ngreat, so choose someplace to go. And she had relatives in California, she didn\u2019t\nwant them to feel obligated to take care of us, so she decided against California.\nShe had old family friends that lived in Chicago, so we came to Chicago.",
        "Q: Okay. And so you spent your \u2014 your youth in Chicago, your American youth in\nChicago.",
        "A: Right, right.",
        "Q: And did you go to public school, did you go to private school?",
        "A: Public school.",
        "Q: Public school. And what was your grandmother doing for a living at that point?",
        "A: She was, you know, she was a seamstress, so she \u2014 but I mean, it was like a word\nof mouth type thing \u2014",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: \u2014 it\u2019s not like she worked for somebody. Didn\u2019t earn Social Security like that.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: I mean, she didn\u2019t earn like a regular paycheck, but that\u2019s \u2014 you know, and there\nwas compensation money, she got [indecipherable] and some money for me until I\nNovember 9, 2008\nwas 18, so that\u2019s what we lived off of. And we qualified for public aid, or whatever\nyou called it at the time.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And being strong, or \u2014 I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m \u2014 can\u2019t think of the word right now, but they\nwould come every month and ask the same questions, like how many rooms do you\nhave, and how many bathrooms do you have? And she\u2019d, that doesn\u2019t change, you\nknow, from month to month.",
        "Q: You\u2019re living in the same place.",
        "A: She didn't \u2014 so she decided, no more, and she stopped the money.",
        "Q: Wow. Oh my.",

        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: But \u2014",
        "A: But you \u2014 what\u2019s interesting, and my husband has found this too, when I\u2019m\namong survivors \u2014 first of all, I don\u2019t have to explain myself, and I think just like\nthey do, I fall right in with them, in spite of it. So I don\u2019t know if it was like raised\ninto me, or what. But I am, you know, very comfortable 1-in this type of situation,\nor with a group that we had, you know. And so, we think the same way, you know\nyou \u2014 I have a stack of food, let\u2019s say, you know, so I never \u2014 even though we were\nboth unemployed for a long time, I never worried about food, because I have that\nstock.",

        "A: No.",
        "Q: No? It\u2019s just an innate quality that you have now, that you have to stockpile\nfood?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Can\u2019t pass up a good deal [indecipherable]",
        "Q: When you were in \u2014 when you were back in Berlin, do you remember, after the\nwar is over, do you remember anti-Semitism at all? Were you experiencing that?",
        "A: I\u2014 you know, I think I was too young to know that, and as I grew up in Chicago,\nI knew people didn't like me, but I didn't know why. When I started working 1s\nwhen I really experienced anti-Semitism, I had to quit a job because of it. I was\nthreatened, and I was harassed. One of my kids in particular says the Holocaust has\nreally affected him. For instance, when the series \u201cHolocaust\u201d was on TV, he came\nhome with \u2014 somebody told him a joke that I don\u2019t remember, but it ended up with,\nall you need is an ashtray for six million Jews. And so, what I say to the audience,\nhow do you respond to that as a human being, as a Jew, let alone as a survivor?",

        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And I said, well \u2014 and now what I\u2019m emphasizing, doesn\u2019t mean it didn\u2019t affect\nme.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And how it\u2019s affected me, my children and my grandchildren. And fir \u2014 I mean,\nfirst of all, you don\u2019t have, you know, family get-togethers, be it for holiday, or my\ngraduation or whatever, you know? And even my grandchildren are missing out on\nall of that.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Because the family is not there. So last Rosh Hashanah weeke \u2014 we\u2019ve got one\ncongregation we belong to that I absolutely love. We never used to go to services, I\nbelong to two congregations over 13 years, and people didn't even say hello to me.\nAnd now, if I\u2019m not going to be here, like this last Friday, don\u2019t worry about me,\nI\u2019m fine, I\u2019m going to be out of town, you know. So, the second congregation,\nHolocaust survivors are free.",
        "Q: Right.\nNovember 9, 2008",
        "A: It\u2019s a congregation that broke off from another congregation. So they have what\nthey \u2014 are called a pitch-in dinner for Rosh Hashanah eve, eve Rosh Hashanah.\nAnd, you know, I never had a family holiday dinner. I\u2019d like to see what that\u2019s like.",

        "A: Let\u2019s skip Rosh Hashanah services, you know, we\u2019re there all day long, we \u2014\nyou know, we\u2019ll miss that. And I got woken up the next morning, I didn't see you at\nservices last night, are you okay, is Vern okay? Missed you, and \u2014 you know,\nbecause my husband had two lung collapses and lung surgery this year. So, you\nknow, people, of course, are \u2014 are very aware of what\u2019s going on in our lives. So,\nit\u2019s a totally different \u2014 so I\u2019ve had \u2014 even like this year, some very new\nexperiences. I n\u2014 I had \u2014 I\u2019ve had so many people say, oh, forget about the\nHolocaust, put it behind you. Lot of \u2014 from different people \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",

        "A: man only child, yes. My mo \u2014 I\u2019m told I\u2019m a lot like my mother, and \u2014 which\nmeans I\u2019m stubborn. But she decided she was going to have a baby at a particular\nage, and no matter what the world situation was, she was gonna have that baby. And\nNovember 9, 2008\nshe thought, well, if something happens, they get taken away, her mother, my\ngrandmother, would take care of me. And then they\u2019Il come back and take over. It\nnever occurred to her that they may not come back. So \u2014",
        "A: No, my parents did forced labor, so my grandparents took care of me. My\ngrandfather was Catholic, so my grandmother was protected while he was alive.",
        "A: Anyway, So every evening my parents would come to visit me, and one day my\nformer landlady came running up and said, Frau Cheever(ph), they\u2019re taking them.\nAnd she stood on the balcony and watched my parents being taken away by the\nGestapo. And I was three months old, they were taken to Auschwitz. I have \u2014 I\nfinally found a permanent \u2014 let\u2019s say a definite death date for my father, and that\nwas March 28\", 1943. And for my paren \u2014 my mother, it just says the end of March.\nAnd just within this last month I got a lot of documents about myself and my\ngrandmother, and my parents. And is \u2014 it da\u2014 so I say, now I have absolute proof\nthat I\u2019m a survivor \u2014",

        "A: Mm.",
        "A: Well, evidently my grandmother knew she was going to go to Theresienstadt.\nShe had a family friend that worked for the underground. And the lady said, well, I\nthink \u2014 well, they called me Gitta, which was my German name. The Hitler regime\nNovember 9, 2008\ndidn\u2019t allow me to keep a German name, so it was changed to Gittel. So she says,\noh, I think it is best chance for survival was to go into camp with her, so I went to\nTheresienstadt with her. And I was in the nursery, and I was, you know, a toddler\nat that point.",

        "A: \u2014 going to services every Friday night, and no matter who my grandmother met,\nshe would tell my story, or our story. And I guess she didn\u2019t realize little pictures\nhave big ears, and that I knew everything. And by the time we came to the U.S.\nNovember 9, 2008\nwhen I was 13, she finally told me about my story, which I had known all along, but\ndidn't say.",
        "A: And she used to say, if I\u2019d asked about my mother, you know, where\u2019s my\nmother, oh she\u2019s in America. And I have \u2014 I\u2019m in two books now. In the first book,\nthat\u2019s entitled, \u201cMy Dear Mother is in America,\u201d and \u2014 my grandmother did an\ninterview before we left Berlin, and that was the title of the story.",
        "A: And she just didn\u2019t want me to know. And I \u2014 I\u2019m thinking logically, when I\ncame here I would say where she was, and I must have blocked it out because I\ndon\u2019t know the answer.",
        "A: You know, how did she, at that point, cover up that my mother was not here.",
        "A: He had tuberculosis and cancer and died. And that\u2019s when \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 yeah, and that\u2019s when she lost her protection and we went \u2014",

And this lady that worked for the underground, I met her, and she\nsaid something to me, and I said, how did you know, I never told anybody, you\nNovember 9, 2008\nknow, that I was sexually abused.

So we come to New\nYork, and they said, you can\u2019t stay in New York because the population is too\ngreat, so choose someplace to go. And she had relatives in California, she didn\u2019t\nwant them to feel obligated to take care of us, so she decided against California.\nShe had old family friends that lived in Chicago, so we came to Chicago.",

So I don\u2019t know if it was like raised\ninto me, or what. But I am, you know, very comfortable 1-in this type of situation,\nor with a group that we had, you know. And so, we think the same way, you know\nyou \u2014 I have a stack of food, let\u2019s say, you know, so I never \u2014 even though we were\nboth unemployed for a long time, I never worried about food, because I have that\nstock.",

        "A: I\u2014 you know, I think I was too young to know that, and as I grew up in Chicago,\nI knew people didn't like me, but I didn't know why. When I started working 1s\nwhen I really experienced anti-Semitism, I had to quit a job because of it. I was\nthreatened, and I was harassed. One of my kids in particular says the Holocaust has\nreally affected him. For instance, when the series \u201cHolocaust\u201d was on TV, he came\nhome with \u2014 somebody told him a joke that I don\u2019t remember, but it ended up with,\nall you need is an ashtray for six million Jews. And so, what I say to the audience,\nhow do you respond to that as a human being, as a Jew, let alone as a survivor?",
        "A: And so now, I talk about the different things that have happened in my life that\nhas affected me because of the Holocaust, you know?\nNovember 9, 2008",
        "A: So that\u2019s really where my story is coming in, because everyone says oh, well,\nyou\u2019re lucky you don\u2019t have memories.",
        "A: And I said, well \u2014 and now what I\u2019m emphasizing, doesn\u2019t mean it didn\u2019t affect\nme.",
        "A: And how it\u2019s affected me, my children and my grandchildren. And fir \u2014 I mean,\nfirst of all, you don\u2019t have, you know, family get-togethers, be it for holiday, or my\ngraduation or whatever, you know? And even my grandchildren are missing out on\nall of that.",
        "A: Because the family is not there. So last Rosh Hashanah weeke \u2014 we\u2019ve got one\ncongregation we belong to that I absolutely love. We never used to go to services, I\nbelong to two congregations over 13 years, and people didn't even say hello to me.\nAnd now, if I\u2019m not going to be here, like this last Friday, don\u2019t worry about me,\nI\u2019m fine, I\u2019m going to be out of town, you know. So, the second congregation,\nHolocaust survivors are free.\nNovember 9, 2008",
        "A: It\u2019s a congregation that broke off from another congregation. So they have what\nthey \u2014 are called a pitch-in dinner for Rosh Hashanah eve, eve Rosh Hashanah.\nAnd, you know, I never had a family holiday dinner. I\u2019d like to see what that\u2019s like.",

And I got woken up the next morning, I didn't see you at\nservices last night, are you okay, is Vern okay? Missed you, and \u2014 you know,\nbecause my husband had two lung collapses and lung surgery this year. So, you\nknow, people, of course, are \u2014 are very aware of what\u2019s going on in our lives. So,\nit\u2019s a totally different \u2014 so I\u2019ve had \u2014 even like this year, some very new\nexperiences. I n\u2014 I had \u2014 I\u2019ve had so many people say, oh, forget about the\nHolocaust, put it behind you. Lot of \u2014 from different people \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 comments like that. Or there\u2019s no more prejudism in the world, you know,\nand we all know better than that. So yeah, there\u2019s more and more \u2014 obviously my \u2014\nI don\u2019t feel my life is normal \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 because of it has been affected in spite of my age, an-and no memories, you\nknow?\nNovember 9, 2008",
        "A: Okay, I \u2014 I used to say, my parents didn\u2019t survive the Holocaust, and my\ngrandmother did. And I never put myself in that picture. And in 1981 was the world\ngathering of Holocaust survivors in Israel, was the first event I attended. And my\nson was on a work study program in Israel at the time. He\u2019s now, of course, you\nknow, almost Hassidic, I mean, he\u2019s ultra-Orthodox. He was on a work study\nprogram, quit the program in order to join me for the gathering. We went to kibbutz\ncomprised of survivors from Theresienstadt. And the man, among the racks and\nracks of documents found my name, and my grandmother\u2019s name, wrote down for\nme what transport I was on, how many were on the transport, and how many\nsurvived. And at that point it hit me, that this happened to me, and I\u2019m a survivor.",
        "A: And my life changed a lot after that.",
        "A: Well, because now I\u2019m talking about it all the time, and I\u2019m realizing it did\naffect me, you know?\nNovember 9, 2008",
        "A: Yeah, now I \u2014 I\u2019ve \u2014 certainly I see that, because as I talk to other people \u2014 like\none of the guys from my group said, look it, I have all this fruit, because I didn't\nhave that as a child, and I know I have so much it\u2019s gonna spoil, but that\u2019s just\nbecause of the war. And like, you know, we talked about I have a stack of food \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 that \u2019'm not gonna worry. But when we join our present congregation, the\nrabbi was hemming and hawing and he says, this is very awkward, and I don\u2019t\nknow how to say this, I just have to come up with it, we have a food pantry, and,\nyou know, I can get food every week. And I said, just ask my kids, I\u2019ve got too\nmuch \u2014 and I said, I have too much food. Nobody has \u2014 has too much food, he said.\nI says, just ask my children, I have too much food, you know. And we just had like\nflooding in the basement, we had terrible rain, we had to throw out a bunch of food.\nI\u2019m not worried about it. I\u2019ve got food that\u2019s way outdated, I\u2019m sure, you know.\nAnd \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 you know, so I\u2019m not worried about it, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s there, it\u2019s there.",

        "A: \u2014 my mother \u2014",
        "A: See, I\u2019ve known all along.",

        "A: Sh\u2014 well, because she kept telling everybody, and I\u2019m standing right next to her,\nyou know? Hello? Little pictures have big ears, you know. So \u2014 no, I mean, it was\njust something that I always grew up with, you know. But I did \u2014 I had to do like an\nautobiography in eighth grade, and so then she had to tell me some things, to do my\nhomework.",

I hi \u2014 why \u2014 I mean, I made\ndifferent friends and this one girlfriend, I spent weekends with them, and I called\nher parents mom and dad, and so I had a little sense of family there.",
        "A: Well, family is important to me \u2014",

        "A: I have a daughter-in-law who constantly cuts us off at her \u2014 her whim, and my\nson goes along with it. She t \u2014 he told his mother-in-law, I don\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t want to\nmake waves, cause I have to live with her. And she cut her own mother off for over\nNovember 9, 2008\nthree years, and her mother was also a survivor. And so now she\u2019s starting to get\ninvolved a little bit with the Second Generation. It\u2019s very difficult, you know, we\njust had ano \u2014 I mean, that cookbook \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 the Holocaust cookbook, okay? And \u2014 so I ge \u2014 all I ever hear about 1s I can\u2019t\ndeal with the subject, okay? So, I did not give my son or my granddaughters a\nchoice. So I gave them each a book and I wrote something in it. I didn't give her\none, it didn\u2019t occur to me. Like I se \u2014 you know, and she\u2019s never let me explain\nwhat my thinking was. They don\u2019t have a choice but deal with it, they have to deal\nwith it, because I\u2019m here.",
