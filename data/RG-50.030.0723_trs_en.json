So I\nwent to see the principal of the high school, and he said, I never heard of such a\nthing. So anyway, I got upset about this thing and I quit school, which was a big\nmistake.

[indecipherable] I just\nhappened to get on the train with the fellows from Hanover, and we went to Camp\nEdward, Massachusetts, and I went up \u2014 I slept in the barracks that night. The next\nmorning I walked down the stairs, and here is my ba \u2014 my brother-in-law\n[indecipherable] the next barracks. Fifty million people in the \u2014 in the service, and\nI end up with my brother-in-law right next door.\nOctober 4, 2013",

And I ended up in a \u2014 an aircraft, nine millimeter aircraft outfit. I send \u2014\nwe were in the country for about a year, I guess, and then we were shipped over to\nEurope.",

So there was four of us, as a meter\n\u2014 what we do is make gas, and we blew up large balloons to send up so that the\nradar could track the \u2014 the balloon, and we put an aluminum kite on the bottom of\nthe balloon, and that would rise up, and then the \u2014 the radar could track that, so that\nthe guns would track wherever the radar would take them. Then the \u2014 the radar\nwould pick up the \u2014 an airplane and then that would \u2014 the guns could shoot at it, so",

        "A: [indecipherable] the \u2014 the \u2014 the balloons would rise, and then the radar would\npick that up, and the radar would tell the guns where to \u2014 where to move. They were\nvery large guns, they were je \u2014 90 millimeter guns, which were a very big shell.\nAnd there wa \u2014 wa \u2014 that\u2019s what \u2014 we used that for \u2014 so we went overseas as \u2014 as a\n\u2014 an anti-aircraft",
        "Q: Anti-aircraft, okay.",
        "A: Yeah. So we trained in England and \u2014 and for a few months. And there I met a\nnumber of architects who were there designing buildings already, and highways for\nafter the war, and I met people there from the \u2014 the British architects\u2019 board, and we\nbecame very good friends. So a \u2014I got \u2014",

        "Q: From Cherbourg you were \u2014 you were \u2014",
        "A: Oh, we went across France and we were stationed right outside of the Battle of\nthe Bulge because they were going to use our guns as field artillery. They found out\nthat they were good \u2014 they were good guns for field artillery instead of \u2014 we had no\ngu \u2014 no German airplanes to shoot at. So then we \u2014 I never got to Paris, oh \u2014 even\nthough it was only a few miles from there, went into Belgium \u2014",
        "Q: Were you part of a particular division, a unit, or \u2014 or larger military presence?",

People were being\nshot, and it was \u2014 all kinds of things were going on, and \u2014 and at the time I was just\nhappy to be in this office, and I would get things to eat that people \u2014 Americans\nOctober 4, 2013\nwere \u2014 half the Americans were already there, so their rations and so on were re \u2014\nbeing brought in by the American army.

        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: But I \u2014 I volunteered to do whatever they said, because it \u2014 I thought well,\nsomebody needs an architect, or a mar \u2014 somebody with architectural experience.\nSo when I get there, I meet this man, Alfons Kamyczek(ph), he\u2019s in the office as \u2014\nas \u2014 he\u2019s just there. In fact, he lived there, as well, in the \u2014 in the \u2014 in the \u2014 1t was in\nthe building. So anyway, he told me what happens there, we ha \u2014 we were in charge\nof the \u2014 the water and sewer and \u2014 and then I ended up being the director to \u2014 to\npick up all these bodies. And I said well, what are we go \u2014 what are we going to\nuse, and anyway \u2014 and we ended up with an old tractor, a \u2014 and a \u2014 a trailer to pull\nOctober 4, 2013\nbehind the tractor. So we had to go over to the barracks where these people were di\n\u2014 if \u2014if you \u2014",

        "A: Oh, my heavens, yes, there was 30,000 there yet.",
        "Q: When you walked in there were still 30,000 people?",
        "A: Oh sure, yeah. Oh yeah. Oh yeah.",
        "Q: Did anybody come up to you, of these \u2014 of the prisoners?",
        "A: Oh \u2014 oh, yeah, why, sure, I talked to a \u2014 in fact, I have pictures of some of them,\nand yeah, I got to know quite a few of them, but those \u2014 there was a lot of people in\nthe barracks that were dead, that we didn\u2019t know. If you didn\u2019t move, you didn\u2019t\nmove your anything, you were considered dead. We had a \u2014 a dentist as a\u2014 asa\ndoctor, so what could he do for us? And so nobody really knew \u2014",
        "Q: Well, did anyone give you an explanation of what you had come across? If you\ndidn\u2019t know that there even had been such a place as Dachau, who \u2014 who explained\nto you why they were there, and who these people were?",
        "A: Well, as I say, a pa \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the American army was coming through,\nthey were \u2014 they were getting all the guards together, and they shot them. In fact, I\nhave some pictures of them shoo \u2014 shooting them.",
        "Q: Did you see these executions?\nOctober 4, 2013",
        "A: No, I took a picture of them, in fact, while they were going there. These poor\nguys were standing there with their hands up, and the Americans shot them anyway,\nit didn\u2019t make any difference; they were guards. But th-the German SS guarded the\nthings, but when these people were \u2014 were dead, and they were either gassed, or\nwhatever, into the crematory, they were \u2014 th-the \u2014 the Germans didn\u2019t \u2014 they didn\u2019t\nhandle these people that were passed away or put into the crematory. They would\nget prisoners of theirs from the \u2014 from the barracks to come in and do all this work\nin the crematory. So they would move the bodies around with their bare hands and\nso on, and put them in the furnaces, or whatever. And \u2014 but they \u2014 the \u2014 the SS\ndidn\u2019t do the \u2014 they didn\u2019t actually do any of the work, they just did the orders, it\u2019s\n\u2014 in other words, they directed the people what to do.",
        "Q: By the time you got to that camp, were there any SS still there, or they\u2019d all been\neither arrested, or escaped?",
        "A: Oh, there ba \u2014 there were a lot of SS there, there were loads of SS there. We had\nsi\u2014 30,000 prisoners in the camp when I got there, from 31 different countries. And\nso, they were \u2014 they were told that they could leave. Well, they wanted something\nto eat, so they were eating American rations, and so on, and \u2014 but \u2014 but the thing is,\na lot of those people couldn\u2019t even walk, they didn\u2019t know where they were from,\nthey didn\u2019t know what they were gonna see when they got home, and the \u2014 this \u2014\nOctober 4, 2013\nthe roads were just fi-filled with people all over the place, and the ro \u2014 other ca \u2014\nother prisoners in other camps, they were also let go. And they were all, everybody\nwas out in the street, walking, just walking, they didn\u2019t know where they were\ngoing. So \u2014 and there was no transportation provided for them, so \u2014 so you just \u2014\nthey \u2014 I don\u2019t know what ever happened to these people, I have no idea. I was just\nthere in the camp, just happy to be \u2014 be there. And I remember one day some bird\ncolonel walked in the office and said, Coulson, it\u2019s good to see you here, he said,\nI'll see you when you leave. And that was my orders. So I \u2014 I had been da \u2014 a\ncouple of times during the year, I was to the commandants ca \u2014 to his house, which\nwas located right in the middle of the camp, and I was there for couple drinks and\nso on, I guess we had some wine and so on, but that\u2019s the only \u2014 that\u2019s the only\norders I had, and I was there for a year. And then eventually the \u2014 the war crimes\ntrials came in t-to the camp, and they \u2014 and they tried the \u2014 the people that were still\nliving. And the doctor was there that did all the experiments on these prisoners,\npoor souls, and they\u2019re treated like animals. Animals are better treated than these\npeople were. And I met a lot of people. I met people from Austria and so on. I met\na count there, and I met the other \u2014 the officers\u2019 mess \u2014 the American officers\u2019 mess\nhad a\u2014 a German chef, who I had him \u2014 I don\u2019t know, and he and I became friends.\nSo \u2014 so he wanted me to \u2014 to go half on a ski lodge down in the mountains. So one\nOctober 4, 2013\nday he took me down to see the ski lodge, it was a beautiful place. Anyway, he said\n\u2014I said, well, what are \u2014 what do I have to put into it to buy this? He said, well, do\nyou ha \u2014 for half of 1t you\u2019re going to have to come up with 300 American dollars,\nwith real, actual cash. And we said \u2014 I said, I\u2019m not allowed to have American cash\nhere. So he said, well, can you get it? And I se \u2014 I wrote to my wife and said, just\nsend me 300 American dollars, which she did. And anyway, I said to this \u2014 this\nGerman chef that \u2014 but which was going to be my partner for the \u2014 the chateau. And\n\u2014and I said, how am I gonna get my money out of it when I leave here, how can \u2014\nhow can I get my money? Cause there was no \u2014 no di \u2014 no transfer of money funds\nor anything else between the countries at that time. And anyway, he said I don\u2019t\nknow. So I ended up selling my money on the black market and I did pretty well\nwith that. But so \u2014 my 300 dollar \u2014 I don\u2019t know what these poor souls did with the\nAmerican money. Most cases I sold it to the \u2014 the Germans, they bought most of the\nmoney, because Americans weren\u2019t allowed to have it.",
        "Q: Well, tell me, for how mu \u2014 do you remember what the black market rate was for\nan American dollar?",
        "A: Oh, I have no idea, I have no 1\u2014",
        "Q: Okay.\nOctober 4, 2013",
        "A: I have no idea. I sold cigarettes, which we\u2019d get a carton of cigarettes every\nweek, and I used to sell them. And I sent the money back, and after a while they\nwere catching up to us sending all this money back home, so \u2014 so I \u2014 anyway, they\ndecided that evwa \u2014 everybody would have to have a \u2014 the \u2014 a book that when you\ngot your pay, which I got five dollars a month, and then they\u2019d write down in that\nbook, and \u2014 that you had \u2014 that you got five dollars in pay, so you couldn\u2019t send any\nmore money back any more. We weren\u2019t allowed to send \u2014 send it back.",
        "Q: So, I want to understand a few things about what you just told me, because some\nof it is clear, and some of it is confusing to me. You get to \u2014 you get to Dachau \u2014",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: \u2014 you go into a building \u2014",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: \u2014 and this is, I don\u2019t know what kind of building. Was this an office building\nwithin the campground?",
        "A: Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yes, some of the buildings are very nice, as there \u2014 some\nbuildings were three and four stories, and well-built for the \u2014 the SS had used as a\ntraining camp, and then they switched over to just as a\u2014 as a se \u2014 a concentration\ncamp, where they brought people in from all the \u2014 all over Europe.\nOctober 4, 2013",
        "Q: Yeah, but the building that you went into, that you found Alfons Kamarek(ph)\nthere \u2014",
        "A: Right, that was a \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 what was \u2014 what was that building for?",
        "A: Okay, that \u2014 oh, that\u2019s a large \u2014 that was several stories. That was \u2014 it was really\none of the gates. The gate. In fact, there\u2019s a picture in my \u2014 in my book there. And\nwe had about, let\u2019s see, one, two, three, four d \u2014 rooms, and I had an apartment on\nthe \u2014 the third floor, where I slept. And \u2014 well, it wasn\u2019t an apartment, it was just a\nbedroom, really.",
        "Q: And who \u2014 would a\u2014 who would have slept there before you did? Jur \u2014",
        "A: Oh, I\u2014I would think it was \u2014 I think it was just empty space, as far as that was\nconcerned.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Yeah. The \u2014 the first floor was all office area, and \u2014 and the American sold \u2014\nsoldier used to \u2014 was like a big eagle over the gate, right next door to us, and I used\nto hear this popping sound, and the Americans were \u2014 used to try to shoot the eyes\nout of the big eagle that were a-a-above the gate.",
        "Q: So this was an iron gate, not a real \u2014 not a real bird.",
        "A: Oh no \u2014 oh no, it was a big bird, the German eagle, or whatever it was \u2014\nOctober 4, 2013",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 above the gate.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And then \u2014 and the gate was down below.",
        "Q: But it was \u2014 it was \u2014 it was a metal eagle.",
        "A: Oh yeah, right, yeah \u2014",
        "Q: It was a metal eagle. Okay.",
        "A: \u2014 oh yes, yeah, sure, yeah. Didn\u2019t know about plastic then.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Or not much about them, anyway. So yeah, was a big \u2014",
        "Q: And so \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 big metal \u2014 yes, th-the eagle.",
        "Q: \u2014 you \u2014 you got to know this \u2014 this Polish prisoner of war, whose name was\nAlfons.",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "Q: And did he tell you anything of what had been going on in the camp?",
        "A: Oh yeah, oh sure, he told me quite a bit about what was happening there, what\nhad happened, and how he was treated, and so on.",
        "Q: What did he tell you?\nOctober 4, 2013",
        "A: If \u2014 well, if someone tried to escape somewhere \u2014 I don\u2019t know how they ever\nget out, I don\u2019t think the \u2014 I think there was a big wall around the whole round \u2014 the\nwhole camp, so \u2014 cause the people in Dachau, which was only about a half a mile\naway \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 said that they didn\u2019t know what was going on in the camp. They had all these \u2014\nthe commandants and the \u2014 the \u2014 the German officials and so on, lived in nice\nhouses just outside the wall.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: So, I don\u2019t know, I guess the people in Dachau \u2014 I mean in \u2014 in the \u2014 yeah, the\ntown of Dachau thought that was just a training camp for the SS there. That\u2019s was\nthere from 1933, so up to \u2014 until the 40s, then it became a concentration camp, and\nthe SS operated it. So Alfons told me almost what I had to do, what he was doing\nfor years, was making drawings, and so on for buildings and things like this. And \u2014",
        "Q: What kind of \u2014 excuse me, I\u2019m going to go into some detail.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: What kind of buildings was he making drawings for? Within the camp itself?",
        "A: Oh yeah, oh, everything was 1\u2014 was in the camp, oh yeah. Yeah, right.\nOctober 4, 2013",
        "Q: Okay. And what kind of drawings \u2014 what kind of buildings was he making the\ndrawings for?",
        "A: Well, there \u2014 there were \u2014 well, most of them were to house the prisoners.",
        "Q: I see, barracks and things.",
        "A: And \u2014 yeah, right, yeah, the barracks and so on, things like that. Or service\nbuildings, and so on, maybe it\u2019s a place of \u2014 to house th-the vicious dogs and so on.\nSo it \u2014 if somebody tried to escape, they\u2019d send the dogs after them, or whatever,\nand then when they caught them down there, they\u2019d shoot them, so \u2014 so there\u2019s not\nmuch chance to get away. But Alfons would tell me, many days, if somebody tried\nto escape or work \u2014 coming back from their work, outside the barracks, they all had\nto line up there, and they had to stand there until they caught this guy, and then, no\nmatter what the weather was, if it was snowing or raining, or whatever it was, or\nheat or whatever, they had to stand out there in the street until they found them.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And that was days [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Here\u2019s another question.",
        "A: \u2014 many hours.",
        "Q: When you met Alfons, he was a prisoner, or he had been a prisoner.",
        "A: He had been a prisoner.\nOctober 4, 2013",
        "Q: And then you saw people who were in the barracks, who were still alive, but\nbarely. Did Alfons look any different from them? Did \u2014 he was \u2014 was he just as\nskeletal and as mal \u2014",
        "A: No, was \u2014 the odd thing about it was that he \u2014 h-he was fairly dressed. I mean, he\nhad shirt and trousers on. Where he got them, I had no idea. I don\u2019t know where he\ngot them. But the \u2014 the prisoners, the-they \u2014 they\u2019re \u2014 they\u2019re \u2014 they\u2019re\n[indecipherable] next to rags when th \u2014 when they came in there, and they were\nalways brought in on trains, closed boxcars and so on. Most \u2014 some of them were\nopen, but most of them are closed, that way nobody outside, the civilians wouldn\u2019t\nknow \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 who was coming in there on the trains. And so that\u2019s where the death train was\nparked, somewhere outside our office. Everybody smelled this thing one day, and\nwondered what was going on. And when somebody opened the doors on, and that\u2019s\nwhere we saw these two guys that \u2014 two out of 400 that lived. So a friend of mine\nwent down to \u2014 into the \u2014 in Dachau and got the mayor and I don\u2019t know who all,\nall \u2014 some of the officials, and brought them out to \u2014 to \u2014 to take these people off\nthe cars that were there, the dead people that were there. And they had them \u2014 th-\nthere was no gloves or anything else, they had to use their bare hands, he insisted on\nOctober 4, 2013\nthat, that d \u2014 that day, taking these people out. So what they did is they hauled them\nto the crematory and they were disposed of there, the bodies \u2014",
        "Q: So the mayor and other officials from Dachau were told \u2014",
        "A: From Dachau they br \u2014 he \u2014 he \u2014 he went in, collect all these people up and\nbrought them out to the camp.",
        "Q: Did you see that?",
        "A: Oh yeah, sure, because th-the train was just a short distance from where our\noffice was.",
        "Q: And how did the mayor of Dachau behave when he was told to do this?",
        "A: Well, he wasn\u2019t too happy about it, let me tell you, none of them were, cause\nthey said they didn\u2019t know that this was happening. So \u2014 so anyhow, there\u2019s these\n400 people, they\u2019re almost all dead, and \u2014 and it was just a horrible mess, and so\nthey had to pick these people up and take them to the crematory.",
        "Q: Was that far from the place where the train was?",
        "A: Oh, it was maybe a block or two away. So th-they had to dispose of them, and\nthey \u2014 they cleaned the cars up somewhat, and they just wipe them out, or whatever.\nThey had [indecipherable] brooms or something that they had, and cleaned up the\n\u2014 the freight cars, but [interruption, coughing] Pardon, I\u2019m talking too much.",
        "Q: No, no, no. We\u2019ll hold on just a second.\nOctober 4, 2013",
        "A: Pardon me.",
        "Q: We can hold on just a minute. We can hold on. [break]",
        "A: \u2014 at the \u2014 cleaning out the de \u2014 the death train.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: So when we\u2019re cleaning out the death train, you have all these sort of town\nofficials from Dachau there \u2014",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "Q: \u2014 having to do this with their hands, saying that they didn\u2019t know what was\ngoing on \u2014",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "Q: \u2014 before, and not happy that they have to get themselves in \u2014",
        "A: And th-they had to clean these cars out there \u2014",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: \u2014 and \u2014 and dispose of these \u2014 the deceased people that were on the train. I have\nno idea where they were from. They were probably brought in from other camps.\nBut, as the war was moving on real fast, the SS didn\u2019t want the Americans to talk to\nany of these people, but they were bringing people in from other camps, hundreds\nof people. They were probably bringing in from other ca \u2014 other areas, into\nOctober 4, 2013\nDachau, and then, of course, you try to get rid of them and you \u2014 and they were\ntrying to take them to other camps from there. And the the Americans caught them\nbecause they were moving so fast. The war \u2014",
        "Q: So in other words, they \u2014 they were \u2014 they \u2014 the \u2014 the peop \u2014 the SS, which was\nin charge of the concentration camps \u2014",
        "A: Correct.",
        "Q: \u2014 was trying to get \u2014 to keep them separate from their \u2014",
        "A: From the Americans talking to anybody \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 from the Americans, yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 or seeing \u2014 seeing what they were really doing there. But these people were\nlying in the \u2014 1n the barracks and so on. Most of them were dead anyway, so the \u2014\nlike I say, if you didn\u2019t move, you were considered dead. So, we just pile them up\nand put them on the gurney, or whatever it was that we had there, and either took\nthem to a\u2014 a\u2014 we \u2014 we got a bulldozer to dig a big hole, and you just pushed these\ndead people in the \u2014 the \u2014 you know, just \u2014",
        "Q: And who was \u2014 who was manning the bulldozer?",
        "A: Oh, I had one of the \u2014",
        "Q: American?",
        "A: \u2014 that was American \u2014\nOctober 4, 2013",
        "Q: American.",
        "A: \u2014 that was American, oh yeah, it was American.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: But it was \u2014 yeah, the Americans brought the \u2014 the engineers brought a bulldozer\nfrom some other camp somewhere, and we just dug a big hole and pushed them in.\nWas a sad day, but nobody knew who these people were. No had \u2014 nobody had any\nidea who they were.",
        "Q: I can imagine that everybody was shocked.",
        "A: Oh, well, it was just \u2014 that was the \u2014 the thing that I\u2019d been doing the day, and\nthat never happened, nobody di \u2014 they didn\u2019t really think anything about it.\nEverybody was upset about it, I\u2019m sure, because I know people tell me that when\nthey saw these things that \u2014 that they couldn\u2019t believe that this was happening to\nanybody, any human being, how they were treated. At Dachau they \u2014 they did\nmany tests there. The doctors would try different inoculations on the people. They\nput them in \u2014 they were testing a palette of \u2014 of uniforms there, and they \u2014 they put\nthem in cold water, because if the power came down over the \u2014 the \u2014 the ocean\nbetween England and \u2014 and France, they would be in cold water. They wanted to\nknow what \u2014 what kind of uniforms you should make for them. These tests were all\ndone before we got there, of course.\nOctober 4, 2013",
        "Q: Did somebody show you the places where these were done? I mean, 1s this \u2014 did\nyou go to those places where \u2014",
        "A: Oh yeah, yeah, sure we went there, but that was all part of the camp, there were\nspecial rooms, and so forth, these tests were done. And \u2014 and they \u2014",
        "Q: I\u2019m interested to find out what it is that you saw. In other words, did \u2014 did\nsomeone bring you around from room to room to explain, this is what \u2014",
        "A: Oh no, we just walked on our own. You just went wherever you wanted to go,\nyeah.",
        "Q: Was there any place that you went, that looked kind of confusing, you know,\nwhat was this for, or what was that for?",
        "A: Oh yeah, sure, yeah. Well th \u2014 one of the experimental buildings, you had to \u2014\nwhere \u2014 where these tests were done, and so on, one of the tests I know they \u2014 they\nput these people in ice \u2014 in 1ce water, like in the \u2014 which would have been the\nocean, and they put them in \u2014 they took these guys out, and put them in bed with\ntwo girls. They wanted to see if body heat was going to revive them. And I don\u2019t\nknow why, because they wouldn\u2019t have them out in the airplane, it didn\u2019t make\nsense. But anyway, that\u2019s what they were doing. They were trying all kinds of tests\nthere, different kind of \u2014 of diseases and so on. And of course you end up hanging\nthe \u2014 the doctor who was in charge of all this.\nOctober 4, 2013",
        "Q: Did you see him?",
        "A: Oh yeah, I saw him, yeah, before their \u2014 I remember they took him to the war\ncrimes trials, that\u2019s where I saw him, but I never went to the war cri \u2014 I didn\u2019t really\ncare about what was happening at the \u2014 at the war crimes trials. They had all the \u2014\nthe German SS people over there.",
        "Q: Were you \u2014 when you\u2019re telling me these things, what I\u2019m not sure is, 1s this \u2014\nthis something you learned afterwards, when you were out of the camp, or di \u2014\nsomeone told you when you were in the camp? H-How \u2014",
        "A: Well, I was \u2014 I was in the office most of the time. We were \u2014",
        "Q: Mm-hm. And what was your \u2014 what were you doing in the office?",
        "A: Well, we were \u2014 we were making drawings [indecipherable] instructed over\nwhat to do and so on. You gotta remember, I was only 23 years old, I didn\u2019t have\nthat much experience myself.",
        "Q: I got that. I understand.",
        "A: SO \u2014 so \u2014",
        "Q: But I\u2019m trying to get a sense of what your experience \u2014 not that you had to know\neverything.",
        "A: Yeah.\nOctober 4, 2013",
        "Q: But, for example, when you were making drawings in the office, since it was no\nlonger a concentration camp, and people were being let go, what were you making\ndrawings of?",
        "A: Well, the thing was, what we were doing renovations, because they were \u2014 they\nwere getting ready to have the war crimes trials there, just for those people that\nwere in the camp. And there was a like a couple hundred people that were there,\nthat were prisoners, SS officers and so on. And that\u2019s where they had the war\ncrimes trials. And the doctor was there, and \u2014",
        "Q: Within Dachau?",
        "A: In Dachau, yeah, right.",
        "Q: So they didn\u2019t go to Nuremberg?",
        "A: Oh no, no, not these people. These people were considered low class people.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: And they have \u2014 they held the \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the hearings right there, and if the\nguy was guilty, we took him \u2014 or they took him out and hung him, and that was it. It\ndidn\u2019t make much difference. So one day \u2014",
        "Q: So you \u2014 excu \u2014 okay, one day, mm-hm?",
        "A: Some \u2014 some officer walked in, I don\u2019t know what he was any more, and he said\nthey wanted a new gallows because when they hung these people, these newspapers\nOctober 4, 2013\nwere there and so on, and they would see these guys hanging there, down below the\n\u2014 the ba \u2014 the floorboards, they\u2019d come through, and they\u2019d take pictures of them.\nAnd so these peop \u2014 the American officers didn\u2019t want that any more, so they asked\nme to design a new gallows for them, which we did, and then all we did was put\nsome canvas around it, so that the \u2014 the newspaper people who were there couldn\u2019t\nsee or take pictures of these people that were hanging.",
        "Q: Oh, I see.",
        "A: So, it was \u2014 it was pretty crude when you really think about it. There was the \u2014\nthere was really no order. The object was just to get rid of these people who were\nrunning the camp, that was it, really. It was \u2014 it didn\u2019t make any difference \u2014 we had\n\u2014 some people would \u2014 would talk about other \u2014 they\u2019d get information about their\nfellow workers and so on. So that\u2019s how people knew what their jobs were, because\nthe Germans didn\u2019t want \u2014 and I don\u2019t know what I want to say here \u2014 they didn\u2019t\nwant to \u2014 they didn\u2019t want their \u2014 their buddies to n \u2014 to know what they were \u2014\nwhat they were doing when these pe \u2014 when the pri \u2014 the prisoners were there. So\nthat\u2019s really what the war crimes trials were all about, you know, just \u2014 actually it\nwas just a ha \u2014 it was really a farce when you really think about it, because they just\nwanted to get rid of these people that were guards there, of the \u2014 of the inmates, th-\nthe pri \u2014 the prisoners.\nOctober 4, 2013",
        "Q: Okay, I\u2019m a\u2014 I\u2019m a little confused here.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: When you\u2019re in the camp, you have \u2014 you come in and there\u2019s still lots and lots\nof people.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: And some of them are the former guards and \u2014 and those who were, you know,\nin charge, whether they were highest level or not \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, right.",
        "Q: \u2014 but they were in charge. And now they are prisoners.",
        "A: That\u2019s right, yeah.",
        "Q: And the \u2014 and then you have thousands upon thousands of former prisoners, who\nthey were \u2014",
        "A: Correct.",
        "Q: Okay. And during the time you were there, did those former prisoners leave, or\ndid they ste \u2014",
        "A: They were told to \u2014 they were told to leave, yeah, because we didn\u2019t want them\nthere. We had to feed them, we had to take care of them and so on. We didn\u2019t \u2014 we\ndidn\u2019t want them there any more because they\u2019d just leave, you know \u2014",
        "Q: Well, did they, or did they stay cause they had nowhere to go?\nOctober 4, 2013",
        "A: Well, some of them stayed there because they had nowhere to go, and I would \u2014\nwhe-when I needed help in the office, I would get drafts-people \u2014 I \u2014 in fact, I had\ntwo people, I have pictures of them, two drafts-people from Berlin, and they didn\u2019t\nwant to go back to Berlin because the Russians were there, and the russ \u2014 and the\nRussians and the Germans hated each other. So these people stayed on there, I \u2014 I\ntold the guys the fact that there was a front door right in our office that walked out\non the street, that \u2014 which bypassed the gate. And I told them to go ahead and leave,\nand they said they didn\u2019t want to leave. So I \u2014",
        "Q: These were former prisoners?",
        "A: No, these were \u2014 yeah, these were German prisoner of ours.",
        "Q: Okay, no, they weren\u2019t former prisoners of the Germans?",
        "A: No, no, they were \u2014 they were wi \u2014 I would get [indecipherable] we brought \u2014\nwe brought 4,000 German prisoners in to live in the camp after all the other people\nleft.",
        "Q: Got it.",
        "A: They were prisoners of ours.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: So anyway, I got two drafts-people out \u2014 out of the cage. If we wanted a\nplumber, or somebody to fix the plumbing, we got somebody out of the cage that\nOctober 4, 2013\nwas a prisoner of ours then, because we had prisoners br-brought in. And we had\nnowhere to take them, so we had to put them in there, some of them were a big \u2014\nsome people lived at the \u2014 the \u2014 oh, the racetrack, and they lived in the barns there,\nthey had prisoners there. We didn\u2019t know what to do with them, so \u2014",
        "Q: So these prisoners, the German prisoners now \u2014",
        "A: That\u2019s right, all ours.",
        "Q: \u2014 were coming in \u2014 of yours \u2014 of the American \u2014",
        "A: A-After these \u2014 after we got \u2014 we got some of the people out from other\ncountries \u2014",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: \u2014 that were prisoner of th \u2014 of the Germans.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Yeah, so \u2014",
        "Q: Okay, did they live in the same barracks that the other prisoners have lived in?",
        "A: No, they had \u2014 they had some \u2014 they had nicer buildings to live in, they didn\u2019t \u2014\nthey didn\u2019t stay in these \u2014 in these shacks that they were there.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: No, they had better buildings.",
        "Q: So the Americans \u2014 Americans housed them in better facilities.\nOctober 4, 2013",
        "A: That\u2019s right, yeah, that\u2019s what they had to do. We had about 4,000 there. They\nwere from Hungary and Italy and from all counties. They \u2014 they were \u2014 they were\nfighting against us. In other words, they were our prisoners \u2014",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: \u2014 and we took over them, and \u2014 and then \u2014 then we let them go, after a while,\nyou know, if they weren\u2019t too important. They were from all countries, as well.",
        "Q: So \u2014 so, were you designing anything else, besides gallows?",
        "A: Oh yeah, well other buildings for remodeling mostly, it was \u2014 was. Course a lot\nof the buildings were already there, they were good buildings, some of them were\nthree and four stories of brick construction, in fact. There were some very good\nbuildings there.",
        "Q: Did Alfons Kanarek(ph) stay with you the whole time, or did he leave?",
        "A: Oh yeah, he was \u2014 no, he was there the whole time. Fact, he was there when I\nleft, and I don\u2019t know why he didn\u2019t go back to Poland, but he said he didn\u2019t have\nany way to get there, so he wasn\u2019t going to walk. So \u2014 and there was no trains, there\nwere trains, but \u2014 but they didn\u2019t want to leave there.",
        "Q: Did he ever \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 because I would \u2014 I would get him food, and cigarettes and all that sort of\nthing, and some \u2014 and tobacco, and he loved that. So \u2014 so \u2014 and then we had other\nOctober 4, 2013\npeople there who knew where the sewers were, an-and the water, and supplies like\nthat, who had been bordering as well. Fact, I have pictures of them there in the\nkitchen, and they were \u2014 they came \u2014 became workers for us. In other words, they\nworked \u2014 they were working for me. But they didn\u2019t \u2014 they didn\u2019t get a salary or\nanything, they just got the goodies that we could give them, that\u2019s all, you know.",
        "Q: And they got food.",
        "A: That\u2019s exactly right, yeah. And wine.",
        "Q: Now, did you \u2014 a \u2014 a lot of people say that in those first days when \u2014 when the\nUS forces came in, and \u2014 and the starving prisoners of the Germans, that is the \u2014 the\nvictims \u2014",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: \u2014 of the concentration camp who were still alive, would ask for food, and they\nwould eat it so fast that they would die from \u2014",
        "A: Oh yeah, yeah but \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah, did you \u2014 did you have those types of things happen?",
        "A: I\u2014I didn\u2019t really know. I \u2014 I \u2014 I was never involved with the people that were\nthere. I don\u2019t know, I saw them, that\u2019s all. Because my work was really just in the\noffice, in there with Alfons and some of the other people that were prisoners of the\nGermans, who worked on the water and sewer lines and things like that. So we kept\nOctober 4, 2013\nthem on because they knew where these things were. Otherwise, we wouldn\u2019t have\nknown where anything was. And \u2014",
        "Q: Got it.",
        "A: \u2014so we kept them on, and like I said too, the people that I had from Berlin, they\nwouldn\u2019t leave because they \u2014 they again were \u2014 were scared of the Germans. They\n\u2014I mean, they \u2014 the Russians.",
        "Q: The Russians.",
        "A: They \u2014 they didn\u2019t get along at all, not one bit.",
        "Q: Did Alfons ever tell you his personal story of what happened to him, and how he\nhappened to come into that office?",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t know how he did it, I have no idea how they selected him, or\nanything else. He was just there when I got there, you know.",
        "Q: Okay. Because it sounds \u2014 because it sounds from what you\u2019re telling me, he\nwas in a rather privileged position for a prisoner.",
        "A: Yeah, he was \u2014 he was a prisoner of si \u2014 of the SS.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And as \u2014 like I say, they picked him up when he was 18 years old, and he was\nthere for four years, so he was about my same as \u2014 age as I was.",
        "Q: Ah, it\u2019s true.\nOctober 4, 2013",
        "A: And we became good friends. But he was just there. But he was there when I\nleft.",
        "Q: Okay. And so your job was, if I can summarize it, if I can understand it, your job\nwas to \u2014 was to provide the drawings for whatever renovations had to be done in the\ncamp.",
        "A: [indecipherable] renovations are \u2014 of new buildings, or things of that sort.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: But we didn\u2019t have that much to do really. There was a lot of playtime.",
        "Q: Well, that\u2019s \u2014 wow.",
        "A: Yeah. But I\u2014I really wasn\u2019t interested \u2014 pardon me \u2014 I wasn\u2019t inter \u2014 really\ninterested in what was going on, the pla \u2014 in the \u2014 the war crimes trials, I really\ndidn\u2019t care. All I knew was that they had gathered them all up in these buildings and\nso on, the SS people, and they had their war crimes trials there. And whoever was\nthere, most of them were hung. I don\u2019t think \u2014",
        "Q: Tell me, why do you call it a farce?",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "Q: Why did you call it a farce? I mean, you said that these trials were a bit of a\nfarce.",
        "A: Right.\nOctober 4, 2013",
        "Q: Why? Why \u2014 what made it that way di \u2014 for you?",
        "A: Well, the thing is that nobody wanted \u2014 wanted to talk about their buddies and so\non, so that they didn\u2019t really have too much information. They knew that they were\nalready there, they knew they were guards, because they got them out of the guard \u2014\nthe guard buildings. So th-they would \u2014 one prisoner might tell about what the other\nguy did, or something like that. But it really didn\u2019t make any difference; if they\nwere guards, they were shot, and that was it. A lot of them were shot even before\nthe war crimes trials came there, and \u2014 the Americans were so upset about what\nthey saw there, cause they couldn\u2019t understand that these kind of things were\nhappening.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And they just got the guards out of the building, right, so one day, the \u2014 they let\nthe prisoners out of the \u2014 out of the camp, out of \u2014 they cut the wire, and so on, or\nthe gates, and let them out. And they went up in the towers, and threw these guards\nright out the window, which are like three stories high, or something like that. And\nso the \u2014 some of them were \u2014 they ga \u2014 the inmates killed them. The-There was\nsome that I \u2014 that I never saw many women that were there, there were some that I\nti\u2014 I took a picture of one day and \u2014 but th \u2014 I don\u2019t know where they brought the\nwomen from, I have no idea. That really wasn\u2019t a women\u2019s camp, it was mostly for\nOctober 4, 2013\nmen. I think they were brought in right before the end of the war, and the people \u2014a\nlot of the women went into Dachau and smashed the \u2014 the windows. They had\nwomen\u2019s clothing hanging may \u2014 in there, you know, on a \u2014 some sort of a form or\nsome such thing in the window. And they just take the \u2014 their clothes off, standing\nright there in the window and \u2014 and put these new clothes on that they got out of the\n\u2014 out of Dachau stores. So it was pretty \u2014",
        "Q: I wa \u2014 I don\u2019t understand this part.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: So, former \u2014 former female prisoners \u2014",
        "A: Right",
        "Q: \u2014 in Dachau \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 were let go out of the camp, so they went into Dachau, which is only like a\nhalf a mile away.",
        "Q: Oh, the town, okay, they went into the Dachau town.",
        "A: The stores, that\u2019s right, the town, and they just smashed the windows if they\ncouldn\u2019t get in the store, if the door was locked, they just smashed the windows, and\nstanding in there, take all their clothes off, the rags that they had on, and put the\nnew clothes on that they found, you know, in the windows.",
        "Q: I see.\nOctober 4, 2013",
        "A: But anyway, I \u2014 I saw one of the girls was mistreated by someone of the SS\nofficer, or some such thing. And she got a knife from a friend of mine and cut his\ntesticles off, right there in front of everybody. So, they didn\u2019t care. That\u2019s what I\u2019m\nsaying, 1-it was just a madhouse. Nobody \u2014 nobody knew \u2014 we knew that the\nAmericans were 1n control, and the Germans had to listen to whatever they did. If\nthey didn\u2019t listen, they got shot.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: It didn\u2019t make any difference. You know, Americans can be cruel, you know, I \u2014\nI\u2019ve seen things that \u2014 that Americans have done that are just as cruel as any\nGerman ever did, but \u2014",
        "Q: Can you tell me about that?",
        "A: Oh yeah, they did \u2014 they \u2014 they were bad news too, some of them. Especially the\nparatroopers. They were just young kids and they were \u2014 they were gung-ho, they\nwould kill anybody that they can shoot. It didn\u2019t matter a \u2014 a bit. But anyway,\nDachau was a\u2014amess. We got it cleaned up pretty well in the year I was there,\nand \u2014",
        "Q: You were there for a whole year?",
        "A: Oh yeah, I \u2014 yeah, yeah. Yeah, I left \u2014",
        "Q: So you saw a lot in that year?\nOctober 4, 2013",
        "A: Oh yeah, oh goodness yeah. But then a lot of things I didn\u2019t really want to see,\nyou know, I \u2014 like I say, I didn\u2019t go to the trials. I never went to hangings. I \u2014 I just\nwanted to get out. You know, I was married and I wanted to \u2014 I was just a young\nkid, really, and \u2014 and this was all new to me. I could never imagine these things\nhappening; how they treated other people.",
        "Q: Tell me about \u2014 you know, you had your camera with you, what kind of camera\nwas it?",
        "A: Oh, I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s \u2014 well, the Germans weren\u2019t allowed to have cameras,\nknives, anything that could hurt an American.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And \u2014 but Alfons had his own camera, and that was one of our biggest problems.\nThe fil \u2014 the film we got might have been old, and we traded it for cigarettes, or\ncandy, or chocolate bars, or something like that. You couldn\u2019t walk to the grocery\nstore, or \u2014 or a\u2014 a drugstore and buy film there, there wasn\u2019t a such thing. In other\nwords, we get \u2014 we get film from people who already had it, and some of it was\ngood, and some of it wasn\u2019t. Sometimes you\u2019d give them a \u2014 a chocolate bar for a \u2014\na box of film, and it was no good, it was already exposed, as \u2014 so we got any kind\nof film at all that \u2014 that you could get your hands on.",
        "Q: So you had a camera, and he had a camera? Both of you had \u2014 two ki \u2014\nOctober 4, 2013",
        "A: Oh yeah, oh yeah, we both had, yeah, we were \u2014 well, we were allowed to have\ncameras, but \u2014 and of course, Alfons, I don\u2019t know where he got his camera, I have\nno idea, cause I \u2014 he could speak German, so he could go out and talk to these\npeople in Dachau and get things, and he was able to bring things back from the\nstores in Dachau [indecipherable] there, or steal or whatever he could do, you\nknow, he\u2019d just take it, you know, cause that \u2014 the Germans would give up anything\nbecause they \u2014 they just didn\u2019t want to be executed right there on the spot, yep.\nEnd of File One\nOctober 4, 2013\nBeginning File Two",
        "A: \u2014 yeah, that was a bad year, I'll tell you. I \u2014 I was glad to get out of there\n[indecipherable].",
        "Q: Well tell me \u2014 I know, but we\u2019re gonna dwell on it still a little bit, I\u2019m sorry to\nsay, because there are more questions. When you tell me things, that \u2014 more\nquestions about it \u2014",
        "A: That\u2019s okay. I don\u2019t mind.",
        "Q: Okay. So you would get ou \u2014 you would get the film, but not everybody would\nwant to take pictures. What made you want to take pictures of what you were\nseeing? Cause in the photo album you\u2019re donating to us \u2014",
        "A: Well, what it actually \u2014 well, everybody \u2014 Alfons did the same thing, you know,\nwe'd pi \u2014 take a picture of the gate, or \u2014 or the \u2014 or people lining the \u2014 in the \u2014 th-\nthe \u2014 the cadavers were lying in the \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the pick-up trucks. We were \u2014\nmaybe we thought it was going to be evidence sometime, y-you know, that maybe\nsomebody would want it, that\u2019s all. There was really no reason to \u2014 to take pictures,\nit was just that we wanted to do it, I guess for our own use later on. And \u2014 but I had\nthose pictures laying at home for years, and never looked at them anyway. I \u2014 I -",
        "Q: Tell me, how did you develop them there?\nOctober 4, 2013",
        "A: Oh, Alfons, for some reason or other, he was able to do this in his office. I don\u2019t\nknow how he did it, where he got the film. I mean, he had a little closet like where\nhe would develop these film for me, and for him.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And that\u2019s the only two cameras that were in the office, you know, just his and\nmine. And then we\u2019d get film all different sizes. A lot of times you couldn\u2019t use it\nanyway, because it was \u2014 you know, it was exposed, or whatever.",
        "Q: Were there any pictures that you took that didn\u2019t get developed because the films",
        "A: Oh my heavens, yeah, loads of them. Oh, the film wasn\u2019t any good, a lot of it,\nyou know, and \u2014 and so how would we know\u201d? We didn\u2019t know, you put it in the\ncamera and then it came out black, or whatever [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Cause there was no color, it was all black and white, and you know, th \u2014 the\nfilm. we\u2019d \u2014 we\u2019d borrow the film, you know, we \u2014 if we \u2014 we\u2019d go into Dachau\nand talk to these people who we heard maybe had film. And then we\u2019d say, well,\nwe ll \u2014 we\u2019ll give you maybe \u2014 I couldn\u2019t speak German because Alfons could, so\nhe was always the interpreter. So anyway, he would get [indecipherable] these\npeople who had film, and then we\u2019d give them whatever we had to give them,\nOctober 4, 2013\nmaybe C-rations, or whatever it was, just for the film, because they wanted to sell\nit. They wanted our \u2014 our things. They \u2014 they considered our bread as \u2014 as cake, and\nI liked their bread better, because it was dark bread. But our \u2014 all the fellows that I\nhad in the office, they le \u2014 really liked our bread. They thought it was cake at times,\ncause it was white.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And theirs is dark. But I liked the dark bread.",
        "Q: Well, people do say it\u2019s healthier than \u2014 than white bread.",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "Q: People say that dark bread is healthier than white bread.",
        "A: Oh, I \u2014 that\u2019s what I understand so, yeah. Oh, I \u2014 I used to \u2014 I loved that stuff,\nyeah. We \u2014 we\u2019d gallons of \u2014 of peanut butter and grape jelly, and I\u2019d put that\npeanut butter and grape jelly on this dark bread; that was really good, you know.\nBut if you didn\u2019t have anything else to eat, I guess that was all right. But \u2014 but we\nhad \u2014 we had [indecipherable] rations. Then after the Americans came in, they\nopened up the kitchen, and then we had good food that we knew \u2014 that was there.\nWell, I remember the \u2014 the Thanksgiving that we were there, I went over to the \u2014\nwhere the other Americans were, where they were eating in the dining room, and it\nwas Thanksgiving day, and somebody \u2014 one of the cooks in \u2014 American cooks told\nOctober 4, 2013\none of the German assistants to go get the salt. Anyway, he got the \u2014 the soapsud \u2014\nthe soap powder, and put that in the mashed potatoes. And \u2014 and everybo \u2014\neverybody was standing out in the hall, they gotta get in the toilet [indecipherable]\ndown \u2014 down the aisle there, you know, and fortunately I didn\u2019t eat any of the\nmashed potatoes. I \u2014 I\u2014 I was really glad I didn\u2019t after that, Pll tell you. But these\nguys were standing out there \u2014 somebody had gone in their pants, and everything\nelse, you know. I didn\u2019t \u2014 they were eating soap in their mashed potatoes.",
        "Q: Oh my God.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Oh my God.",
        "A: Aw, it was \u2014 but I\u2014I say, you know, it was a rat race. It was just th \u2014 it was n \u2014\neverything was turmoil, you know, for months, because there was really not that\nmuch instruction on what to do. All we wanted to do was get rid of the SS.",
        "Q: And they did.",
        "A: You know, get rid of the offi \u2014 get rid of the officers, get rid of the people who\nmistreated all these people for years, and just get rid of them, you know, and that\nwas it. And I guess we each had our own little places to be, and that\u2019s where we\nstayed, and we didn\u2019t \u2014 we didn\u2019t make it \u2014 any noise anywhere, because if you did,\nyou \u2014 you\u2019d get into the trouble. So we \u2014 we didn\u2019t really \u2014\nOctober 4, 2013",
        "Q: So you felt \u2014 you felt that, you know, gi \u2014 if I can summarize this in the way I\nunderstand it.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: Is that \u2014 that \u2014 when we\u2019re talking about those war crime trials, and what you\nmean is trials that took place within the camp of Dachau, for the camp of Dachau.",
        "A: That\u2019s correct, that\u2019s all.",
        "Q: That\u2019s all it was \u2014",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: \u2014 it never went to Nuremberg or anything else?",
        "A: Oh no, no, no, these \u2014 this was just to handle the people that were \u2014 that were\nofficers or guards there in Dachau.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: \u2014 the little people, not \u2014 no-no-nothing outside.",
        "Q: And these German former guards and \u2014 and camp managers and so on \u2014",
        "A: Right, right.",
        "Q: \u2014 were not talking \u2014 were not telling on one another.",
        "A: Oh, that\u2019s correct, that wa \u2014",
        "Q: In other words, they wouldn\u2019t provide any evidence?\nOctober 4, 2013",
        "A: No, nad \u2014 no information about somebody else. Maybe one time, maybe that\nsomebody didn\u2019t like the other guy, or something like that, he would say, well, he\ndid this or that, or he \u2014 he mistreated somebody, or something like that. Well, that\nwas only recorded, and that was it. So it ended up mostly everybody was either\nhung or shot or whatever anyway, it didn\u2019t make any difference.",
        "Q: Were these executions taking place on a daily basis?",
        "A: Oh sure, yeah, after \u2014 after the thing got started right, yeah, because there was\nlike \u2014 there were dozens of \u2014 of guards there, and the commandant and so on. And \u2014\nand all these people, they had a lot of officers there, from the SS, and they were all\ntried there, right there at Dachau.",
        "Q: Did any of the prisoners though, that they had mistreated, stay around to give\ntestimony, or were they gone?",
        "A: No, they \u2014 most of them were try to get out of the place. They didn\u2019t \u2014 they \u2014\nthey might have said some things about maybe certain ones that they were \u2014 they\nwere mishandled by, but \u2014 but they ne \u2014 they are \u2014 there was \u2014 wasn\u2019t much \u2014 there\nwere \u2014 there really wasn\u2019t much discussion about the prisoners. They were just glad\nto get out of that fence, and get out of them barracks. They would sleep anywhere in\nthe buildings, or wherever they could, you know, summer \u2014 was warm at the time,\ncause we got there in May, and then we got summer, but then in wintertime it got\nOctober 4, 2013\ncold, and but bo \u2014 most of the people were gone a \u2014 after I left \u2014 I mean, they were\ngone before I left, really.",
        "Q: I was going to ask you that, I was gonna \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, most of them \u2014 well, the ones that had someplace to go, or the ones\nthat could walk, they would go. Otherwise, you couldn\u2019t go, they just had to stay\nthere, and we fed them, whatever we could do with them, til they finally did go.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: But they may have had friends or somebody, maybe they knew somebody, or\nthey \u2014 they\u2019d just walk into houses and throw the people out, you know, take over\nthe house, you know, they were \u2014 pardon me, prisoners for \u2014 of the Germans for a\nwhile, and they just wanted to get out of the camp, just get out of there quickly as\nthey could.",
        "Q: So, in the local town of Dachau, they would \u2014 there were former prisoner who\nwould go and \u2014",
        "A: Oh yeah, they \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 empty out from \u2014",
        "A: Oh sure, that\u2019s right, they \u2014 you bet they did. And I \u2014 I understand now though,\nthat a lot of of those people who were the \u2014 most of them are gone, they wouldn\u2019t \u2014\nthere was no discussion about what happened with any of these people. But the-they\nOctober 4, 2013\nwere going to Dachau and they\u2019d steal food, or whatever, they \u2014 they\u2019d just knock\npeople down and take whatever they had. They \u2014 yo-you walk into the houses, hey,\nthey were prisoners there, so why \u2014 they were glad to get out. So \u2014 so they had no\nidea what \u2014 what was going to be happening to them or anything else. So they \u2014 I \u2014\nI could understand, if you were in Dachau and you were from Poland, you had a\nlong way to go to get back to where \u2014 another country. And we had people there\nfrom 31 different countries. So, lord, they came from all around, Austria\n[indecipherable] you know, and who knows where. There were no Americans\nthere that I know of, none at all.",
        "Q: You \u2014 you \u2014 did you ever have any personal interaction with any of the\nprisoners, aside from Alfons?",
        "A: Not really, other than what walked into my office, that\u2019s all, I had \u2014 I had no\nother contact.",
        "Q: But I meant \u2014",
        "A: I couldn\u2019t speak German anyway.",
        "Q: I\u2019m not talking about the German prisoners of the Americans.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: I\u2019m talking about the prisoners of the Germans. That is, when you s \u2014 the \u2014 the\npeople who had been in Dachau for four or five years as prisoners.\nOctober 4, 2013",
        "A: Yeah, right.",
        "Q: Did you have any contact with those, with the victims of the concentration\ncamp?",
        "A: Not really, no, because I couldn\u2019t speak their languages, and I didn\u2019t know what\nthey were saying anyway.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: You know, si\u20141f somebody was Poland, I didn\u2019t know what they were saying.\nWe had some Polish fellows working there, and they ended up \u2014 they \u2014 they started\nto speak some English. Or Alfons \u2014 most of those were \u2014 were friends of his, and he\n\u2014 they were all from \u2014 from Poland, so they knew how to get along with each other,\nand then Alfons would translate what they said to me, 1-in \u2014 in English. So that was\na big help to me, let me tell you. I w \u2014 I wouldn\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t know how I could have\never operated there without him being there. I cou \u2014 I couldn\u2019t have done it, no\nhow.",
        "Q: And \u2014 and his name, if I want to say it again, is Kanarek, k-a-n-a-r-e-k,\nsomething like that? His last name? Alfons\u2019?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I \u2014I know it started with a K, but I don\u2019t know. It was\nKamyczek(ph). Alfons Kamyczek(ph), I\u2019ll never forget his name.",

        "A: And I never had any contact with him after we left there. Like I say, he was still\nthere when I left. So I \u2014 I have no idea, I don\u2019t know his address. I used to hear\nfrom \u2014 from others \u2014 pardon me, Erkar(ph), from Hungary, who was a prisoner of\nours who would come in and clean up my \u2014 my bedroom, and clean the office, and\nhe would \u2014 if any cigarettes were \u2014 cigarette butts were around, he\u2019d tear them apart\nand save the tobacco. He\u2019d put them in a bag, and \u2014 to take back to \u2014 to Hungary.\nAnd he did write me, Erkar(ph), he had my address, and how he did it, I don\u2019t\nknow, but he had my address \u2014",

He was a postman in Hungary,\nwhere, I don\u2019t remember any more. And my wife and I used to get a kick out of it,\nshe\u2019d say, well, here\u2019s a \u2014 another letter for \u2014 for silk stockings or nylon stockings.\nAnd I\u2019d send him a \u2014 we sent them a couple of times, and that was it, then he didn\u2019t\nOctober 4, 2013\nwrite me any more.

        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "Q: \u2014 of what you saw. Did you explain in your letters what it was, where you were,\nand what kind of a place it was?",

        "Q: Did she ask you about them?",
        "A: \u2014 and I told her \u2014 I told her I was in Dachau, that\u2019s all. I re \u2014I really didn\u2019t want\nto upset her, beca \u2014 tell her where I was, because she didn\u2019t know if I was a prisoner\nor not, or what I was, you know, I was just there. But yeah, I wrote to her. You\nknow, sometimes you get a whole stack of letters at a time. It might have been a\nwhole month, you know, that you didn\u2019t get any mail, because everything had to\ntravel by boat.",

        "A: \u2014 you know, and there were \u2014 there were hundreds of camps. And so that was \u2014\nthat was just another place that I was. Like I\u2014 I wasn\u2019t supposed to keep a diary,\nand I kept a diary the whole time I was in the service. And again, those things were\nstolen, and so I had no \u2014 no \u2014 I would have known every time where I moved, and\nso on, but I didn\u2019t know. Oh gee.\nOctober 4, 2013",
        "Q: So you \u2014 you kept a diary, and that was stolen from you?",
        "A: Oh yeah, they [indecipherable] all three years were stolen that were all \u2014 that\nwere all my time in the service. I had them all there together, laying on the bed, on\nmy cot, and somebody stole everything I had.",

        "A: Well, they\u2019re \u2014 they were really \u2014 they were from \u2014 from different countries, and\nso on. Like, I only saw about maybe 20 or something like that, who were prisoners\nof the Germans \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: \u2014 of the SS, brought in there from other camps. And \u2014 but I don\u2019t know. They \u2014\nthey \u2014 they couldn\u2019t do very much, they were \u2014 they were the same as everybody\nelse, you know. They \u2014 they all wanted to get out, and I don\u2019t blame them.",
        "Q: Okay. Hang on just a second.",

        "Q: Well, I-\nOctober 4, 2013",
        "A: I got \u2014I gotta say, it was \u2014 it was somewhat turmoil, you know. Nobody \u2014\nnobody knew who did what.",
        "Q: Why is it \u2014 I mean, I know that in some ways it sounds like it \u2014 it should be\nobvious, but why 1s it that you wanted to get out of there so badly, out of that \u2014 out\nof that \u2014",
        "A: Why did I want to get out?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Because I was just married, and one \u2014 yeah, I mean, I wanted to just get home,\nthat\u2019s all. I saw enough, you know, and knowing \u2014 I didn\u2019t mind too much the\ntravel, or wherever barracks, and so on, or the buzz bombs and stuff like this. I\ndidn\u2019t \u2014 that didn\u2019t bother me. After I got to the camp \u2014 and I didn\u2019t dr \u2014 I didn\u2019t\nhave bad conditions there, I had a real nice bedroom and \u2014 and I could get food\nwhenever I wanted it, because Americans were in charge. I didn\u2019t \u2014 it \u2014 it really\nwasn\u2019t a hardship for me. In other words, I knew I had to stay there, and that was it.\nSo nobody ever \u2014 nobody ever said anything about what I should do, or \u2014",
        "Q: You had no commanding officer?",
        "A: No. And I was a lowly sergeant, yeah, yeah, ye-yeah.",
        "Q: Who was the American who was in charge of the entire Dachau camp?\nOctober 4, 2013",
        "A: Oh, they brought a couple different people in, different times over that year.\nThings were moving so fast. The war \u2014 the wa \u2014 when \u2014 when the Americans got to\nDachau, and they had been to Munich, they were then moving on to southern\nGermany. In other words, they were trying to get down where Hitler was, down in\nthe \u2014 in the Alps mountains. There \u2014 that\u2019s where they were trying to get him. So,\nafter they moved \u2014 they left only a certain amount of \u2014 maybe it was only a hundred\nAmericans there, for that year that I was there. The rest of them were already in\nbattle, they were go-going, trying to get to southern Germany, get the war over\nwith.",
        "Q: So they thought \u2014 so they thought that Hitler was in southern Germany, but in\ntruth, he was in Berlin.",
        "A: Yeah, but he was \u2014 no, he \u2014",
        "Q: Hitler was in Berlin. That\u2019s where he committed suicide.",
        "A: Yeah, but \u2014 but his \u2014 they were trying to get there where his house\n[indecipherable] was down there.",
        "Q: Oh yeah. That\u2019s right, Berchtesgaden was right there, okay.",
        "A: That\u2019s right. They didn\u2019t \u2014 they were trying to get down there, and \u2014 the\nAmericans were, to finish the war off, because they knew that the \u2014 Austria was\nright beyond that. We didn\u2019t want to \u2014 we didn\u2019t care about Austria, we just wanted\nOctober 4, 2013\nto get Germany, and get everybody killed out there we could kill, you know, that\nwas it. We wanted to get out. Everybody wanted out, that was it.",
        "Q: So tell me \u2014 tell me this, I asked this earlier. The end of the war was May eighth,\nI believe, or May ninth, one of those two days, \u201945.",
        "A: Yeah, \u00b045, but \u2014",
        "Q: Right. So you had been in Dachau nine, 10 days by that point.",
        "A: Oh sure.",
        "Q: Did the end of the \u2014 do you remember when you \u2014 how \u2014 where you were when\nthe war ended, when you learned that the war was really over?",
        "A: Yeah, but \u2014 but it really didn\u2019t di \u2014 yeah, wi \u2014 I was still there in th \u2014 in the\noffice at Dachau, you know, it wasn\u2019t \u2014",
        "Q: It didn\u2019t matter to you.",
        "A: No, no, it was nothing. It was just over, you know. Everybody was happy about\nit, but we had to get rid of all these people, we had to get into the war crimes trials,\na-and all these things were going on there. So \u2014 and to me, I didn\u2019t really care what\nwas going on, I just wanted out.",
        "Q: Tell me, did you ever \u2014 ever have R and R? That is, an opportunity to go away\nfrom Dachau for days at a time to have a bit of vacation?",
        "A: No, never.\nOctober 4, 2013",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: No, never. I was always there.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: I remember when I went down there one day for that guy to look at that \u2014 that\nchateau in the mountains, that ski run. Sir \u2014 he says 300 dollars, and look at all this\nspace. Oh my God, I thought, oh jeez. The guy can\u2019t possibly alo \u2014 believe this is\nworth 600 dollars, but yeah, yeah. Well, 300 dollars would have been thousands to\nthem, oh yeah.",
        "Q: And after \u2014 right after the war, that\u2019s a different story.",
        "A: Oh yeah, sure. Oh yeah. But see, I \u2014 I\u2014 I was smart enough to know \u2014 I was just\n\u2014 just a kid, but I was smart enough to know, how\u2019m I gonna get my money back\u2019?\nI\u2019m not going to sit here and watch this guy. I\u2019m married. My wife\u2019s back in \u2014 in\nYork, Pennsylvania for goodness sake. What am I gonna do here, how\u2019m I gonna\nget my money out of this place? So \u2014",
        "Q: He hadn't counted on you being that smart.",
        "A: Yeah, right, I di \u2014 I di\u2014 I was smart enough to know I \u2014 I\u2019m not gonna get \u2014 I\ncould have bought the place, I could have give him my money and so on, I might\nhave owned it, maybe. However, I wouldn\u2019t have known what was going on\nOctober 4, 2013\nanyway, you know. That wa \u2014 that was too far-fetched for me, that \u2014 that was way\nover my head.",
        "Q: Tell me now, when \u2014 when you finally did leave Dachau, was that April 1946 or\nMay 1946?",
        "A: Yeah, it was \u2014I got \u2014I got out in April of \u2014 of \u201946.",
        "Q: And did you go to Italy then, and Switzerland then, cause you mentioned \u2014",
        "A: Yeah. Yeah, wa \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 those were two other places \u2014 what happened?",
        "A: Well, we \u2014 we just took little tours. One of my \u2014 one of my American friends\nwas supposed to collect food for the prisoners over there, which was a farce. And\nanyway, somehow he finagled a German command car, one of them big, open jobs\nthat th \u2014 that the Germans had. And we had a \u2014 an SS officer and a Wehrmacht\nsoldier. And the four of us used to take trips, and we were looking for food. So\nanyway, these two guys there, the \u2014 the German SS offer \u2014 and the funny thing was\nthat he was from Hanover, Germany. His family had owned a \u2014 a \u2014 a \u2014 wheat\nmills and so on, they were grinders, they grind up for \u2014 for food, and so on. And I\nasked him one day how he \u2014 he could speak English, and he said \u2014 I asked him how\nhe \u2014 he got into the service, and the SS. And he said, well, Hitler said, like the Boy\nScouts were \u2014 had to go in this type of service, and \u2014 and the Girl Scouts were over\nOctober 4, 2013\nhere, and \u2014 and these groups were over, but a \u2014 he put them 1n important positions,\nbut he ended up in the SS. And anyway, we used to take these trips down to the\nmountain \u2014 in the mountains, in the Alps, the four of us. The \u2014 the werman \u2014\nGerman Wehrmacht guy, he would \u2014 he would drive, and sometimes I\u2019d sit in the\nback with this SS officer, who we got out of the camp. We were able to take him\nout wi \u2014 you know, get in the \u2014",
        "Q: So, he wasn\u2019t tried? He wasn\u2019t somebody \u2014",
        "A: Oh no, no, he wasn\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t know how he got out, but he did. The both of\nthem got out. Maybe I helped them, I don\u2019t know, but anyway, wa \u2014 but we can \u2014\nwe used to take trips any time down the mountains. And this one guy, the SS\nofficer, he knew some German general\u2019s wife that lived down there, I forget what\nthe town was, but it was occupied by the French. And they brought all these French\nMoroccans out of Africa, up there to the occupation army. And the \u2014 and I\nremember we were standing up there high in the window, we were looking down at\nthese people, and these guys in their robes, and so on. And the \u2014 the Americans\nused to bring meat out there, big legs of lamb and stuff like that. And they have in\nthe truck \u2014 there was no \u2014 there was no cooling \u2014",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: \u2014 and no \u2014 and no \u2014\nOctober 4, 2013",
        "Q: No refrigeration.",
        "A: No refrigera \u2014 they just brought it in trucks, they throw it on the ground, and no\n\u2014 these guys would pick it up, they\u2019d take it away and they just ate it, and so on. But\nwe'd stand up in this wom \u2014 this woman\u2019s house, and we\u2019d look down, see this stuff\ngoing on. But yeah, they \u2014 they a \u2014 they had hardly finagled that car \u2014 I \u2014 I still\ndon\u2019t know how they ever got that car, I don\u2019t know. But my friend Davros(ph)\nasked me along. We went to a\u2014 a funny part, we went to a Kraft cheese factory one\nday, and got cheese. Another place this guy knew, whoever, could get eggs. Why\nwe did it, I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know what we ever did with this stuff anyway.\nA2: This is after that happened, right?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Is this after Dachau, or is this while you\u2019re in Dachau?",
        "A: Oh yeah, we tha \u2014 while we were in Dachau, yeah, yeah. I don\u2019t know where\nthey got the car from, I guess it was from one of the officers had this car there. It\nwas a big [indecipherable] job that was really nice. Big convertible. We\u2019d ride\naround in that thing, oh yeah.",
        "Q: Well, tell me about something else, cause you alluded to it before. It sounds like\nthere was a pretty thriving black market going on after the war.",
        "A: Oh yeah.\nOctober 4, 2013",
        "Q: If you had \u2014 if you had money that you could exchange and get \u2014 what did you\nexchange it for, for stuff, or for local currency, whatever that local currency would\nhave been?",
        "A: Well [indecipherable] local. Well, we used to call \u2014 the Americans had their\nown money.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: So, we used to call them cigar coupons.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Cause back in those days, when you go here to \u2014 to a cigar store or something\nlike that, they give you coupons there if you bought certain products.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So we used to call the cigar coupons, the American money.",
        "Q: But it wasn\u2019t our usual dollar currency?",
        "A: Oh no, no, no, every ca \u2014 every country and America had different. In France\nthey had French money, American money. In Germany they had American money,\nbut it wasn\u2019t real money.",
        "Q: I see.\nOctober 4, 2013",
        "A: It was just printed stuff that they had. Whatever country it was that was\noccupied, the Americans brought their money in, but 1t wasn\u2019t real money. It wasn\u2019t\n\u2014 wasn\u2019t cur \u2014 American currency.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: It was just printed stuff that they brought. That\u2019s why I call \u2014 we call them cigar\ncoupons. But we could buy stuff with this. In other words, we could go to, maybe\nnot a PX, but place where you could buy stuff.",
        "Q: A commissary?",
        "A: Yeah, right \u2014 well, it was \u2014 wa \u2014 it was \u2014 it really wasn\u2019t \u2014 that headquarters,\nthey just had it like a little room, with stuff in 1t, you know, no store or anything like\nthat. They may have had cigars, or pipes, or you know, things [indecipherable]\nguys smoke with or \u2014 or whatever. They might \u2014",
        "Q: So was it worth anything, this \u2014 this printed money?",
        "A: Oh yeah, it was \u2014",
        "Q: I mean, worth anything that you could buy that was wor \u2014 that was the \u2014",
        "A: Oh yeah, you could buy a million things with it. The Germans would like to get\ntheir hands on it.",
        "Q: I see.\nOctober 4, 2013",
        "A: \u2014 because they could u-use the money too. Actually, the me \u2014 the German\nmoney wasn\u2019t worth anything, really.",
        "Q: You mean \u2014 talking about the old Reichsmark?",
        "A: I \u2014 like we \u2014 when we [indecipherable] that money wasn\u2019t any good to anybody\nreally. It was just a souvenir. I se \u2014 I \u2014 I used to send money back, I had some\nmillion dollar bills and so on from \u2014 from the bank, and I\u2019d send them to my wife\nhome, cause her uncle used to save the stuff from different countries. He\u2019d save this\nmoney that \u2014 you know, if guys would send him, cause he had a restaurant and \u2014\nand \u2014 and they\u2019d \u2014 they\u2019d send him money back. So I sent him a million dollar bill\none day. That was a \u2014",
        "Q: You mean a million Reichsmark bill, like \u2014",
        "A: No, real ri\u2014 yeah, but 1t wasn\u2019t \u2014 it wasn\u2019t anything anyway.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: It was just a souvenir really. Just a piece of paper.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, well, it was useless really.",
        "Q: Well, about \u2014 so the \u2014 so you were able to exchange real dollars for this sort of\nprinted American \u2014\nOctober 4, 2013",
        "A: Oh yeah, I could take my money, American money, and I could deposit. I could\nsend it back, we had like a post office that we could go to. It wasn\u2019t really a post\noffice, but you could take your stuff there. And we could exchange that money, we\ncould put it in the book, and then we get that, I could send that home. Yeah. But like\nI say, they only \u2014I only got five dollars, my wife got the rest of it. I guess\n[indecipherable] we had 30 dollars a month, a dollar a day we got, yeah.",
        "Q: And so you would keep five for yourself and send 25 home.",
        "A: Yeah, well, she was \u2014 yeah, she was working, so she worked in my \u2014 her uncle\u2019s\nrestaurant, and \u2014",
        "Q: And \u2014 and going back to other stuff, what kind of activities were some of the\nsoldiers, US soldiers involved in in the black market?",
        "A: Really nothing, they just \u2014 they would gamble money. They\u2019d gamble it to get\nthe money, that\u2019s all. That\u2019s how they got the money, you know, was mostly\ngambling. Oh, some of them used to go to \u2014 to Switzerland and buy cheap watches,\nand sell them to the Russians for a high price. And \u2014 and anyway \u2014 and they all \u2014\nthe Russian money wasn\u2019t worth anything, I don\u2019t know why they ever \u2014",
        "Q: Did you meet any Russians when you were in Dachau?",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "Q: Did you meet any Russians when you were in Dachau that \u2014\nOctober 4, 2013",
        "A: I saw some, but I\u2014 I saw them, but I wouldn\u2019t have known that I \u2014 I met them \u2014\nwe were in a \u2014 before we \u2014 I got to Dachau, we were in a \u2014 ake \u2014 a training camp\nwhere they \u2014 they tested all their guns, and so on. And their \u2014 the Russians were\ncoming in to take over, and I met some there. But nobody liked \u2014 even the\nAmericans didn\u2019t like the Russians, even though they were on our side, that we di \u2014\nwe didn\u2019t care for them. They were \u2014",
        "Q: Why\u2019?",
        "A: In fact, I\u2014 my neighbor down the street here, he met some Russians, and he\ndidn\u2019t \u2014 they didn\u2019t like them either. They \u2014 I don\u2019t know, they had their lifestyle, I\nguess, and us \u2014 and we \u2014 we couldn\u2019t \u2014 we couldn\u2019t get along with them at all. But I\nknew the Germans and the \u2014 and the Russians didn\u2019t like each other at all. They\nwere \u2014 like these two guys I said were draftsmen, they didn\u2019t want to go back to\nBerlin.",
        "Q: Did you ever get to Berlin, or not?",
        "A: Never. Never got to [indecipherable] always seven miles away. You know, the\nthing was, I always \u2014 when we were at Dachau, there was \u2014 I always wanted to get\nout, you know, and I didn\u2019t take any trips that I could have gone out in \u2014 down the\nmountains, there were these guys, cause I knew the other American was with me.\nBut we \u2014 I never took any \u2014 I could \u2014 I couldn\u2019t go on \u2014 I went to Munich a couple\nOctober 4, 2013\nof times, and I liked the city. But that was mostly all gone anyway. The buildings\nwere di \u2014 just ruined, everything was ruined.",
        "Q: Tell me this: you arrive in Dachau in the last day of April in 1945. You leave\nthe \u2014",
        "A: We got in in May.",
        "Q: Or in May.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: The first day of May. You leave in April 1946.",
        "A: Yeah, right.",
        "Q: The Dachau you arrived in, and the Dachau you left from \u2014",
        "A: Let me see \u2014 wait a minute here. We got four \u2014 yeah, \u201940 \u2014 wi \u2014 May of \u00b046.",
        "Q: Oh, May of \u00b046.",
        "A: Yeah, 40 \u2014 \u201946. Trying to get my mind here together. I got \u2014 no, I got out in\nApril. That wouldn\u2019t be right. I was still there in April, I got May \u2014 out in May of\n\u201946, yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: Okay. So that means you were really there over a year, just over a year.",
        "A: Yeah, right, yeah.",
        "Q: How had the camp changed in that year?\nOctober 4, 2013",
        "A: Not very much. I think it\u2019s after \u2014 after the war crimes people got out, a lot of it\nwas torn down, like I said about this man telling me a lot of \u2014 a lot of buildings\nwere disposed of. They took all the \u2014 they took all the barracks down, I understand,\neverything.",
        "Q: That\u2019s after you left.",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "Q: When you left, were th \u2014",
        "A: Oh, that was still there.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Everything was there.",
        "Q: Were all the prisoners still there?",
        "A: Oh no, a lot of them left.",
        "Q: Was it an empty camp?",
        "A: Oh yeah, pretty well, yeah, pretty well.",
        "Q: Were there \u2014 were there still \u2014",
        "A: Only the people didn\u2019t know where to go, they were the only ones that stayed.",
        "Q: And were there still German prisoners of the Americans there?",
        "A: Well, there were some un \u2014 some German prisoners there yet, but not many, they\nwere gone, they knew where to go. They \u2014 they knew where they lived, and so on.\nOctober 4, 2013\nBut these prisoners, the poor souls, they didn\u2019t know where they were from. They\nknew where they were from, but they \u2014 how they were gonna get there.",
        "Q: So there still were prisoners from the concentration camp years \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: \u2014 when you left in \u2014 in May \u201946, who were still in Dachau?",
        "A: Yeah, right. There were still some there because they didn\u2019t \u2014 well, a lot of them\ndidn\u2019t know where to go.",
        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: Th-They were confused, a lot of them were \u2014 well, they has spent a lot of time\nthere maybe, and they \u2014 they were too confused, they didn\u2019t know where to go. And\nthey couldn\u2019t walk, a lot of them couldn\u2019t walk. So I think eventually they took\nthese people back. They just put them on American trucks and took them wherever\nthey wanted to go, or something like that. That\u2019s what I understood, anyway, but I\nwasn\u2019t there when they did that, I don\u2019t know. They had to get rid of them\nsomehow, you had 30,000 people, that\u2019s a lot of people, let me tell you.",
        "Q: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: And they had to get rid of them. So, the Americans didn\u2019t want them there, you\nknow, they just wanted to close the camp up and get out. They wanted to get out as\nquickly as you could.\nOctober 4, 2013",
        "Q: Did you see any of the physical artifacts of the medical experiments?",
        "A: Yeah, I saw some \u2014 some lampshades that the commandant\u2019s wife made out \u2014\nout of human skin in the \u2014 1n the house [indecipherable] that stuff was still there.",
        "Q: Was it in the house, or was \u2014",
        "A: Oh, it was in the house, yeah. The \u2014 the commandant\u2019s house was about in the\ncenter of camp, so we Americans took it over. I don\u2019t know who was in charge, I\nhave no idea, but I know I was told to come there a couple of times, and I saw this\nstuff. There was still the \u2014 the \u2014 the furnishings were still there. Maybe they were\ngonna use it for evidence, I don\u2019t know. I had \u2014",
        "Q: What did \u2014 what did a lampshade made out of human skin look like?",
        "A: Something similar to this, except it was darker, that\u2019s all. She has it stretched\nout, you know. Was more just straight things here, that\u2019s all.",
        "Q: But it was like in a regularly furnished room?",
        "A: Oh yeah, sure, like your living room, yeah, yeah. I remember some of the\nfurniture and stuff they \u2014 they had \u2014 all that stuff was still there.",
        "Q: How come the comma \u2014",
        "A: I guess he must have used it for evidence, I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: How come the commandant\u2019s house was in the center of the camp, but most of\nthe SS officers live right outside?\nOctober 4, 2013",
        "A: I don\u2019t know why. I don\u2019t know why.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: But I know I was there three times, I was there. Maybe \u2014 I don\u2019t know, maybe \u2014",
        "Q: Was it awful \u2014",
        "A: I think his wife was there, too. I think he had some children there.",
        "Q: Why \u2014 was it a place that was off limits to you during the time you were there,\nthat you\u2019d only have three times you\u2019d have been there? Or was there just special\noccasions as to why you went to that commandant\u2019s house?",
        "A: No. All the Americans are in charge of it see, so \u2014",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: \u2014 I was just told to come there one day for a meeting or something like that.\nThat\u2019s all it was. People gotta do this or that, or somebody\u2019s this \u2014 was there. You\nknow, there\u2019s a couple of American officers there, and \u2014 but I was just one of\nmaybe 10 people that were there, that\u2019s all. All Americans were there, only \u2014 only\nAmericans were invited.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: But, yeah, we were just still there. We were gonna do this or that, or we\u2019re gonna\n\u2014 we\u2019re gonna move here, or we\u2019re gonna open this kind of a building or something\nOctober 4, 2013\nlike that. There was no really big instructions. I think it was more of a \u2014 a ti-time to\ndrink wine. That\u2019s about all, yeah.",
        "Q: So tell me how \u2014 who gave you the order that you could actually leave Dachau?\nHow did that happen?",
        "A: You know, I don\u2019t know. Somebody \u2014 there was some there \u2014 well, the\nAmerican officers were there, and some guy came in to \u2014 on the office one day and\ntold me that I could leave. I was the only American there, of course. So, he said, get\nyour things and \u2014 and come down to headquarters. And then we got on a truck, and\nwent to Munich and got on a train, and went to \u2014 to Bremerhaven, and that was it.\nThey gave us a ca\u2014a quart of Four Roses whiskey when we got on the train. And\nthe train was real cold because it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s three guys sit here, and three people over\nhere, it\u2019s like \u2014 well, you know how they are, the coaches with, I think there\u2019s six\npeople or something like that.",
        "Q: Sort of like separate compartments.",
        "A: Yeah. And I drank all my booze, I\u2019m taking all my clothes off, I\u2019m getting hot.\nThese here guys are all sitting there freezing. Oh God, you know, I \u2014I guess these\nwere \u2014 this whiskey warmed me up, because that\u2019s the first I ever had any whi \u2014 any\nbooze. But you know, I ha \u2014 the other people, they used to tell me, in the Pacific,\nthey\u2019d give them beer out there, Americans dis-distribute beer and all that sort of\nOctober 4, 2013\nthing. I never got any of that stuff. We got \u2014 when we got on the train, somebody\nhanded me a bottle of whiskey, and that was it. That\u2019s the only thing I ever got from\nanybody. We got a\u2014a pack of cigar \u2014 I mean, a carton of cigarettes a week, that\u2019s\nwhy everybody used to smoke. But we got tobacco for a pipe or something like that,\nonce in a while. But I never got anything that was given to me, other than that\nwhiskey [indecipherable] on the train.",
        "Q: So \u2014 so tell me this \u2014",
        "A: Let me tell you, by the time I got to mid-Germany, that booze was gone.\n[indecipherable]",
        "Q: So at Bremerhaven, where you on a military ship coming home, or \u2014",
        "A: We were on \u2014 we were on a troop ship.",
        "Q: On a troop ship.",
        "A: What happened, it was a freighter, really. The \u2014 the Americans would take\nGerman prisoners, and bring them back to the USA to work over here, on farms, in\nfactories and stuff like that. They were really the fortunate ones, that when that ship\ncame back, they\u2019d bring these prisoners back, the German prisoners back. It was all\npainted, it was really \u2014 everything was nice and clean for us. So, we came back on ji\n\u2014 on \u2014 got on the ship, and, in fact I have a picture in that book, of me standing on\nthe boat. And it took about 10 days to get home, I think we hit a storm or something\nOctober 4, 2013\ncoming back. But it was on a troop ship, but it was nice and clean, cause the\nGermans had painted everything, and it was, you know, it was neat. So they were\nusing [indecipherable] in the States. But then I heard a lot of stories about\nprisoners back here that \u2014 German prisoners that were pretty well treated some \u2014\nback here, I'll tell you. They had good \u2014 they didn\u2019t have to work on farms and\nfactories and stuff. In fact two guys over here the other day, they were telling me\nabout some of the prisoners that were \u2014 they knew people here who had taken care\nof them, you know, and brought them back. So they \u2014",
        "Q: And where did you sail in to?",
        "A: New York. We left from New York on the Queen Elizabeth, that took us five\ndays to get there. It was really fast. That ship traveled alone, it didn\u2019t go in a convoy\nlike all the others.",
        "Q: The Queen Elizabeth was the ship you came back on?",
        "A: No, no \u2014",
        "Q: That\u2019s the ship \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 we came back on a troop ship.",
        "Q: Oh a \u2014 that\u2019s what I thought.",
        "A: Yeah, right, a freighter. But we went over on \u2014",
        "Q: On the Queen Eliz \u2014\nOctober 4, 2013",
        "A: \u2014 there were 21,000 G.I.s on there, and \u2014 and 4,000 crew and 4,000 civilians\nwere on that ship.",
        "Q: On Queen Elizabeth?",
        "A: Yeah, right. Going over.",
        "Q: Going to \u2014 uh-huh.",
        "A: Going over. I never saw such a big ship in my life before we saw it. Well, I\nnever saw a ship before.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: But anyway, we got on there, and boy if a \u2014 a torpedo had ever hit that thing,\nthey\u2019d a lost a lot of people, let me tell you.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: But it would zigzag like this, it \u2014 1t goes like that across the ocean, because every\nsix minutes the ship would change course, because it took seven minutes for a\nGerman submarine to get on target. And that\u2019s why they \u2014 they\u2019d zigzag. And the\nlast night out, before we came up the Firth of Clyde, that ship was really bouncing\nback and forth, because they said they had a \u2014 a \u2014 a notice that maybe there was a\nsubmarine close by, so there was \u2014 that was really a bounce around, but it was a\nnice ride. We went over in August, it was beautiful weather. And then we \u2014 we\nstayed up on deck most of the time. I slept on deck almost every night, because I\nOctober 4, 2013\nknew I was down in D deck, so I\u2014 I never \u2014 I\u2019d never get out of there. That was a \u2014\nthat was a full ship, let me tell you. All them big dining rooms were filled up with\ndel \u2014 double decker c-cots. Some of them were three and \u2014 three high, you had to\nclimb up there to get to them. I was fortunate, I had a nice cot down in \u2014 somebody\nwas above me, I think, in \u2014 1n one the state rooms. A nice ship, a big ship, let me\ntell you. A big boat.",
        "Q: And when you got into New York harbor, having come back, did your wife\nmeet you there?",
        "A: Oh no, oh no, no. I had to go down to New Jersey to a \u2014 a de-depot there, an\narmy camp, where some guy was \u2014 he\u2019d \u2014 he was gonna sign us out. And he had\nonly been the \u2014 in the service about two months, I think it was, and he said, don\u2019t\nyou want to join the \u2014 the National Guard or \u2014 or the reserves? I said hell no, if you\nwant to join, you go ahead and join. Let me tell you right now, I\u2019ve had all the army\nI want. Yeah, he \u2014 he \u2014 he wanted me to sign up, I said no way. I\u2019m not signing up\nfor nothing, let me tell you. Nope. I ca\u2014I came back on \u2014 then we got a train out of\nsomewhere in New Jersey \u2014 no, I got a bus to Philadelphia, and then we got a train\nfrom Philadelphia to Lancaster, Pennsylvania. And \u2014 and the \u2014 the car, th-the car\nhad a potbellied stove right in the middle, that\u2019s how he heated the car. Oh jeez.\nOctober 4, 2013\nReally antiquated. Oh God, I can\u2019t believe that something like that happened. But\nthat\u2019s the way it was, you know, yeah.",
        "Q: And so your wife met you in Lancaster?",
        "A: No way.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: No. We had [indecipherable] on the third floor apartment, and I got a \u2014 a taxi to\ngo home. Nobody there [indecipherable] me, no, nobody. Hell, nobody was there. I\ncame home alone, yeah.",
        "Q: Was she surprised to see you?",
        "A: Sure was. She sure was surprised. I told her I was going to come home\nsometime, you know. Hell, we didn\u2019t have a telephone, and I \u2014 nobody had\ntelephones, nobody \u2014 I didn\u2019t buy a c \u2014I gotta borrow a car. Some guy was there\nwith me. He worked in a ga\u2014 ina Chrysler garage in York, so he told me to buy a\nca \u2014 a uSed car, cause cars weren\u2019t made during the war, and they \u2014 they only had\nthe cars before the war, and they started making them after the war, but wa \u2014 there\nwas \u2014 there was all used cars. And I had a big Chrysler, some beer magnate from\nYork, he owned the car, and he traded in for something else. And I could actually\nlay out in the trunk of the car, was a one-seater. I could lay out this way, not\nsideways, I could la \u2014\nOctober 4, 2013",
        "Q: But lengthwise.",
        "A: \u2014 that\u2019s how \u2014 how big the trunk was, I could stretch out like that, that\u2019s how\nbig. Beth(ph) said, what in the world do you want with this kind of big car? I said,\nit\u2019s just a car, that\u2019s all. Just something to drive around, you didn\u2019t have anything.\nWe sold our \u2014 we had a new Nash that we bought right before \u2014 about two \u2014 when I\nw \u2014 I worked in Baltimore and \u2014 and we had this Nash, and we sold it a couple\nhours before, cause she couldn\u2019t drive, so we sold it a couple of hours right before I\nwent in the service. S-So, we had that money.",
        "Q: So tell me about your post-war years.",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "Q: Tell me a little bit about the post-war years. Where did you start working when\nyou came back?",
        "A: When I came back?",
        "Q: Mm.",
        "A: Okay. I went back to my old buddy. We built a house here in Hanover, and I\nwent back with my old architect friend here downtown, who I had known before\nthat \u2014 before I got in. And I went with him for a couple of years, I guess it was.\nThen I got my license in 1950, and I \u2014 I was registered in five states: New York,\nNew Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania.\nOctober 4, 2013",
        "Q: Are \u2014 license for what?",
        "A: As an architect.",
        "Q: As an architect, okay.",

        "Q: And so, did you go out on your own then, or \u2014",
        "A: Oh yeah, I always had my own office, always. I did work for other people, then I\ndid work for a Baltimore firm when they were doing the Baltimore City Hall.\nThings like that, that sort of nice projects, yeah. And then I started getting into \u2014\ninto \u2014 into medical buildings, hospitals, [indecipherable] homes, retirement homes,\nthat sort of thing.",
        "Q: So mostly it was commercial buildings rather than residential?",
        "A: Oh yeah, right, oh yeah. Well, things were busy then, you know?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Everybody was doing something, you know, and they were building all kinds of\nthing \u2014 I \u2014 I designed every fa \u2014 house in this town, and a lot of the buildings and so\non.

        "Q: And then you saw people who were in the barracks, who were still alive, but\nbarely. Did Alfons look any different from them? Did \u2014 he was \u2014 was he just as\nskeletal and as mal \u2014",

        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: So in other words, they \u2014 they were \u2014 they \u2014 the \u2014 the peop \u2014 the SS, which was\nin charge of the concentration camps \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 was trying to get \u2014 to keep them separate from their \u2014",

        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: I can imagine that everybody was shocked.",

        "Q: I\u2019m interested to find out what it is that you saw. In other words, did \u2014 did\nsomeone bring you around from room to room to explain, this is what \u2014",

        "Q: Mm-hm. And what was your \u2014 what were you doing in the office?",
        "Q: I got that. I understand.",
        "Q: But I\u2019m trying to get a sense of what your experience \u2014 not that you had to know\neverything.",
        "Q: But, for example, when you were making drawings in the office, since it was no\nlonger a concentration camp, and people were being let go, what were you making\ndrawings of?",
        "Q: Within Dachau?",
        "Q: So they didn\u2019t go to Nuremberg?",

        "Q: And some of them are the former guards and \u2014 and those who were, you know,\nin charge, whether they were highest level or not \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 but they were in charge. And now they are prisoners.",

        "Q: So the Americans \u2014 Americans housed them in better facilities.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: So \u2014 so, were you designing anything else, besides gallows?",

        "A: Yeah, right. But it wa \u2014 the war was moving pretty fast there for a while. Near\nthe end, til I got involved with it, we were stationed like \u2014 as I said, about 50 miles\nfrom Dachau. And then I saw in, one morning I saw a \u2014 I noticed on the board, the\nbulletin board that somebody wa \u2014 was needed somewhere, ha-ha-had an\narchitectural experience, and I volunteered. I had no idea where I was going. So\nsomebody told me to pack my bags, and a guy \u2014 I jumped in a\u2014 in a Jeep witha\ndriver, and lo and behold, he takes me to Dachau.",

I-I was told to go to this\noffice building, which was really one of the ca \u2014 the gates where the architectural\nengineering office was. That was for doing my job, and that\u2019s where I met Alfons\nKamyczek(ph), who was a\u2014 who worked in the office for the German SS shir \u2014 the\nSS troopers, and \u2014",

People were being\nshot, and it was \u2014 all kinds of things were going on, and \u2014 and at the time I was just\nhappy to be in this office, and I would get things to eat that people \u2014 Americans\nOctober 4, 2013\nwere \u2014 half the Americans were already there, so their rations and so on were re \u2014\nbeing brought in by the American army.

        "A: Oh yeah, well I didn\u2019t \u2014 no, I didn\u2019t know. When \u2014 when I was told \u2014 I mean, I\nsaw the \u2014 the bul \u2014 on the bulletin board, the notice that somebody was needed, I\nhad no idea where I was going, or anything else.

        "A: But I \u2014 I volunteered to do whatever they said, because it \u2014 I thought well,\nsomebody needs an architect, or a mar \u2014 somebody with architectural experience.\nSo when I get there, I meet this man, Alfons Kamyczek(ph), he\u2019s in the office as \u2014\nas \u2014 he\u2019s just there. In fact, he lived there, as well, in the \u2014 in the \u2014 in the \u2014 1t was in\nthe building. So anyway, he told me what happens there, we ha \u2014 we were in charge\nof the \u2014 the water and sewer and \u2014 and then I ended up being the director to \u2014 to\npick up all these bodies. And I said well, what are we go \u2014 what are we going to\nuse, and anyway \u2014 and we ended up with an old tractor, a \u2014 and a \u2014 a trailer to pull\nOctober 4, 2013\nbehind the tractor. So we had to go over to the barracks where these people were di\n\u2014 if \u2014if you \u2014",

        "A: Oh \u2014 oh, yeah, why, sure, I talked to a \u2014 in fact, I have pictures of some of them,\nand yeah, I got to know quite a few of them, but those \u2014 there was a lot of people in\nthe barracks that were dead, that we didn\u2019t know. If you didn\u2019t move, you didn\u2019t\nmove your anything, you were considered dead. We had a \u2014 a dentist as a\u2014 asa\ndoctor, so what could he do for us? And so nobody really knew \u2014",
        "A: Well, as I say, a pa \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the American army was coming through,\nthey were \u2014 they were getting all the guards together, and they shot them. In fact, I\nhave some pictures of them shoo \u2014 shooting them.\nOctober 4, 2013",
        "A: No, I took a picture of them, in fact, while they were going there. These poor\nguys were standing there with their hands up, and the Americans shot them anyway,\nit didn\u2019t make any difference; they were guards. But th-the German SS guarded the\nthings, but when these people were \u2014 were dead, and they were either gassed, or\nwhatever, into the crematory, they were \u2014 th-the \u2014 the Germans didn\u2019t \u2014 they didn\u2019t\nhandle these people that were passed away or put into the crematory. They would\nget prisoners of theirs from the \u2014 from the barracks to come in and do all this work\nin the crematory. So they would move the bodies around with their bare hands and\nso on, and put them in the furnaces, or whatever. And \u2014 but they \u2014 the \u2014 the SS\ndidn\u2019t do the \u2014 they didn\u2019t actually do any of the work, they just did the orders, it\u2019s\n\u2014 in other words, they directed the people what to do.",
        "A: Oh, there ba \u2014 there were a lot of SS there, there were loads of SS there. We had\nsi\u2014 30,000 prisoners in the camp when I got there, from 31 different countries. And\nso, they were \u2014 they were told that they could leave. Well, they wanted something\nto eat, so they were eating American rations, and so on, and \u2014 but \u2014 but the thing is,\na lot of those people couldn\u2019t even walk, they didn\u2019t know where they were from,\nthey didn\u2019t know what they were gonna see when they got home, and the \u2014 this \u2014\nOctober 4, 2013\nthe roads were just fi-filled with people all over the place, and the ro \u2014 other ca \u2014\nother prisoners in other camps, they were also let go. And they were all, everybody\nwas out in the street, walking, just walking, they didn\u2019t know where they were\ngoing. So \u2014 and there was no transportation provided for them, so \u2014 so you just \u2014\nthey \u2014 I don\u2019t know what ever happened to these people, I have no idea. I was just\nthere in the camp, just happy to be \u2014 be there. And I remember one day some bird\ncolonel walked in the office and said, Coulson, it\u2019s good to see you here, he said,\nI'll see you when you leave. And that was my orders. So I \u2014 I had been da \u2014 a\ncouple of times during the year, I was to the commandants ca \u2014 to his house, which\nwas located right in the middle of the camp, and I was there for couple drinks and\nso on, I guess we had some wine and so on, but that\u2019s the only \u2014 that\u2019s the only\norders I had, and I was there for a year. And then eventually the \u2014 the war crimes\ntrials came in t-to the camp, and they \u2014 and they tried the \u2014 the people that were still\nliving. And the doctor was there that did all the experiments on these prisoners,\npoor souls, and they\u2019re treated like animals. Animals are better treated than these\npeople were. And I met a lot of people. I met people from Austria and so on. I met\na count there, and I met the other \u2014 the officers\u2019 mess \u2014 the American officers\u2019 mess\nhad a\u2014 a German chef, who I had him \u2014 I don\u2019t know, and he and I became friends.\nSo \u2014 so he wanted me to \u2014 to go half on a ski lodge down in the mountains. So one\nOctober 4, 2013\nday he took me down to see the ski lodge, it was a beautiful place. Anyway, he said\n\u2014I said, well, what are \u2014 what do I have to put into it to buy this? He said, well, do\nyou ha \u2014 for half of 1t you\u2019re going to have to come up with 300 American dollars,\nwith real, actual cash. And we said \u2014 I said, I\u2019m not allowed to have American cash\nhere. So he said, well, can you get it? And I se \u2014 I wrote to my wife and said, just\nsend me 300 American dollars, which she did. And anyway, I said to this \u2014 this\nGerman chef that \u2014 but which was going to be my partner for the \u2014 the chateau. And\n\u2014and I said, how am I gonna get my money out of it when I leave here, how can \u2014\nhow can I get my money? Cause there was no \u2014 no di \u2014 no transfer of money funds\nor anything else between the countries at that time. And anyway, he said I don\u2019t\nknow. So I ended up selling my money on the black market and I did pretty well\nwith that. But so \u2014 my 300 dollar \u2014 I don\u2019t know what these poor souls did with the\nAmerican money. Most cases I sold it to the \u2014 the Germans, they bought most of the\nmoney, because Americans weren\u2019t allowed to have it.",
        "A: Oh, I have no idea, I have no 1\u2014\nOctober 4, 2013",
        "A: I have no idea. I sold cigarettes, which we\u2019d get a carton of cigarettes every\nweek, and I used to sell them. And I sent the money back, and after a while they\nwere catching up to us sending all this money back home, so \u2014 so I \u2014 anyway, they\ndecided that evwa \u2014 everybody would have to have a \u2014 the \u2014 a book that when you\ngot your pay, which I got five dollars a month, and then they\u2019d write down in that\nbook, and \u2014 that you had \u2014 that you got five dollars in pay, so you couldn\u2019t send any\nmore money back any more.

And\nwe had about, let\u2019s see, one, two, three, four d \u2014 rooms, and I had an apartment on\nthe \u2014 the third floor, where I slept.

The \u2014 the first floor was all office area, and \u2014 and the American sold \u2014\nsoldier used to \u2014 was like a big eagle over the gate, right next door to us, and I used\nto hear this popping sound, and the Americans were \u2014 used to try to shoot the eyes\nout of the big eagle that were a-a-above the gate.",

That\u2019s was\nthere from 1933, so up to \u2014 until the 40s, then it became a concentration camp, and\nthe SS operated it. So Alfons told me almost what I had to do, what he was doing\nfor years, was making drawings, and so on for buildings and things like this. And \u2014",

But Alfons would tell me, many days, if somebody tried\nto escape or work \u2014 coming back from their work, outside the barracks, they all had\nto line up there, and they had to stand there until they caught this guy, and then, no\nmatter what the weather was, if it was snowing or raining, or whatever it was, or\nheat or whatever, they had to stand out there in the street until they found them.",

They were probably bringing in from other ca \u2014 other areas, into\nOctober 4, 2013\nDachau, and then, of course, you try to get rid of them and you \u2014 and they were\ntrying to take them to other camps from there.

At Dachau they \u2014 they did\nmany tests there. The doctors would try different inoculations on the people.

        "A: Oh yeah, sure, yeah. Well th \u2014 one of the experimental buildings, you had to \u2014\nwhere \u2014 where these tests were done, and so on, one of the tests I know they \u2014 they\nput these people in ice \u2014 in 1ce water, like in the \u2014 which would have been the\nocean, and they put them in \u2014 they took these guys out, and put them in bed with\ntwo girls. They wanted to see if body heat was going to revive them. And I don\u2019t\nknow why, because they wouldn\u2019t have them out in the airplane, it didn\u2019t make\nsense. But anyway, that\u2019s what they were doing. They were trying all kinds of tests\nthere, different kind of \u2014 of diseases and so on. And of course you end up hanging\nthe \u2014 the doctor who was in charge of all this.\nOctober 4, 2013",
        "A: Oh yeah, I saw him, yeah, before their \u2014 I remember they took him to the war\ncrimes trials, that\u2019s where I saw him, but I never went to the war cri \u2014 I didn\u2019t really\ncare about what was happening at the \u2014 at the war crimes trials. They had all the \u2014\nthe German SS people over there.",
        "A: Well, I was \u2014 I was in the office most of the time. We were \u2014",
        "A: Well, we were \u2014 we were making drawings [indecipherable] instructed over\nwhat to do and so on. You gotta remember, I was only 23 years old, I didn\u2019t have\nthat much experience myself.",
        "A: SO \u2014 so \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.\nOctober 4, 2013",
        "A: Well, the thing was, what we were doing renovations, because they were \u2014 they\nwere getting ready to have the war crimes trials there, just for those people that\nwere in the camp. And there was a like a couple hundred people that were there,\nthat were prisoners, SS officers and so on. And that\u2019s where they had the war\ncrimes trials. And the doctor was there, and \u2014",
        "A: In Dachau, yeah, right.",
        "A: Oh no, no, not these people. These people were considered low class people.",
        "A: And they have \u2014 they held the \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the hearings right there, and if the\nguy was guilty, we took him \u2014 or they took him out and hung him, and that was it. It\ndidn\u2019t make much difference. So one day \u2014",
        "A: Some \u2014 some officer walked in, I don\u2019t know what he was any more, and he said\nthey wanted a new gallows because when they hung these people, these newspapers\nOctober 4, 2013\nwere there and so on, and they would see these guys hanging there, down below the\n\u2014 the ba \u2014 the floorboards, they\u2019d come through, and they\u2019d take pictures of them.\nAnd so these peop \u2014 the American officers didn\u2019t want that any more, so they asked\nme to design a new gallows for them, which we did, and then all we did was put\nsome canvas around it, so that the \u2014 the newspaper people who were there couldn\u2019t\nsee or take pictures of these people that were hanging.",
        "A: So, it was \u2014 it was pretty crude when you really think about it. There was the \u2014\nthere was really no order. The object was just to get rid of these people who were\nrunning the camp, that was it, really. It was \u2014 it didn\u2019t make any difference \u2014 we had\n\u2014 some people would \u2014 would talk about other \u2014 they\u2019d get information about their\nfellow workers and so on. So that\u2019s how people knew what their jobs were, because\nthe Germans didn\u2019t want \u2014 and I don\u2019t know what I want to say here \u2014 they didn\u2019t\nwant to \u2014 they didn\u2019t want their \u2014 their buddies to n \u2014 to know what they were \u2014\nwhat they were doing when these pe \u2014 when the pri \u2014 the prisoners were there. So\nthat\u2019s really what the war crimes trials were all about, you know, just \u2014 actually it\nwas just a ha \u2014 it was really a farce when you really think about it, because they just\nwanted to get rid of these people that were guards there, of the \u2014 of the inmates, th-\nthe pri \u2014 the prisoners.\nOctober 4, 2013",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, right.",
        "A: That\u2019s right, yeah.",
        "A: Correct.",
        "A: They were told to \u2014 they were told to leave, yeah, because we didn\u2019t want them\nthere. We had to feed them, we had to take care of them and so on. We didn\u2019t \u2014 we\ndidn\u2019t want them there any more because they\u2019d just leave, you know \u2014",
        "A: Well, some of them stayed there because they had nowhere to go, and I would \u2014\nwhe-when I needed help in the office, I would get drafts-people \u2014 I \u2014 in fact, I had\ntwo people, I have pictures of them, two drafts-people from Berlin, and they didn\u2019t\nwant to go back to Berlin because the Russians were there, and the russ \u2014 and the\nRussians and the Germans hated each other. So these people stayed on there, I \u2014 I\ntold the guys the fact that there was a front door right in our office that walked out\non the street, that \u2014 which bypassed the gate. And I told them to go ahead and leave,\nand they said they didn\u2019t want to leave. So I \u2014",
        "A: No, these were \u2014 yeah, these were German prisoner of ours.",
        "A: No, no, they were \u2014 they were wi \u2014 I would get [indecipherable] we brought \u2014\nwe brought 4,000 German prisoners in to live in the camp after all the other people\nleft.",
        "A: They were prisoners of ours.",
        "A: So anyway, I got two drafts-people out \u2014 out of the cage. If we wanted a\nplumber, or somebody to fix the plumbing, we got somebody out of the cage that\nOctober 4, 2013\nwas a prisoner of ours then, because we had prisoners br-brought in. And we had\nnowhere to take them, so we had to put them in there, some of them were a big \u2014\nsome people lived at the \u2014 the \u2014 oh, the racetrack, and they lived in the barns there,\nthey had prisoners there. We didn\u2019t know what to do with them, so \u2014",
        "A: That\u2019s right, all ours.",
        "A: A-After these \u2014 after we got \u2014 we got some of the people out from other\ncountries \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 that were prisoner of th \u2014 of the Germans.",
        "A: Yeah, so \u2014",
        "A: No, they had \u2014 they had some \u2014 they had nicer buildings to live in, they didn\u2019t \u2014\nthey didn\u2019t stay in these \u2014 in these shacks that they were there.",
        "A: No, they had better buildings.\nOctober 4, 2013",
        "A: That\u2019s right, yeah, that\u2019s what they had to do. We had about 4,000 there. They\nwere from Hungary and Italy and from all counties. They \u2014 they were \u2014 they were\nfighting against us. In other words, they were our prisoners \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 and we took over them, and \u2014 and then \u2014 then we let them go, after a while,\nyou know, if they weren\u2019t too important. They were from all countries, as well.",
        "A: Oh yeah, well other buildings for remodeling mostly, it was \u2014 was. Course a lot\nof the buildings were already there, they were good buildings, some of them were\nthree and four stories of brick construction, in fact. There were some very good\nbuildings there.",
        "A: Oh yeah, he was \u2014 no, he was there the whole time. Fact, he was there when I\nleft, and I don\u2019t know why he didn\u2019t go back to Poland, but he said he didn\u2019t have\nany way to get there, so he wasn\u2019t going to walk. So \u2014 and there was no trains, there\nwere trains, but \u2014 but they didn\u2019t want to leave there.",
        "A: \u2014 because I would \u2014 I would get him food, and cigarettes and all that sort of\nthing, and some \u2014 and tobacco, and he loved that. So \u2014 so \u2014 and then we had other\nOctober 4, 2013\npeople there who knew where the sewers were, an-and the water, and supplies like\nthat, who had been bordering as well. Fact, I have pictures of them there in the\nkitchen, and they were \u2014 they came \u2014 became workers for us. In other words, they\nworked \u2014 they were working for me. But they didn\u2019t \u2014 they didn\u2019t get a salary or\nanything, they just got the goodies that we could give them, that\u2019s all, you know.",
        "A: That\u2019s exactly right, yeah. And wine.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Oh yeah, yeah but \u2014",
        "A: I\u2014I didn\u2019t really know. I \u2014 I \u2014 I was never involved with the people that were\nthere. I don\u2019t know, I saw them, that\u2019s all. Because my work was really just in the\noffice, in there with Alfons and some of the other people that were prisoners of the\nGermans, who worked on the water and sewer lines and things like that. So we kept\nOctober 4, 2013\nthem on because they knew where these things were. Otherwise, we wouldn\u2019t have\nknown where anything was. And \u2014",
        "A: \u2014so we kept them on, and like I said too, the people that I had from Berlin, they\nwouldn\u2019t leave because they \u2014 they again were \u2014 were scared of the Germans. They\n\u2014I mean, they \u2014 the Russians.",
        "A: They \u2014 they didn\u2019t get along at all, not one bit.",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t know how he did it, I have no idea how they selected him, or\nanything else. He was just there when I got there, you know.",
        "A: Yeah, he was \u2014 he was a prisoner of si \u2014 of the SS.",
        "A: And as \u2014 like I say, they picked him up when he was 18 years old, and he was\nthere for four years, so he was about my same as \u2014 age as I was.\nOctober 4, 2013",
        "A: And we became good friends. But he was just there. But he was there when I\nleft.",
        "A: [indecipherable] renovations are \u2014 of new buildings, or things of that sort.",
        "A: But we didn\u2019t have that much to do really. There was a lot of playtime.",
        "A: Yeah. But I\u2014I really wasn\u2019t interested \u2014 pardon me \u2014 I wasn\u2019t inter \u2014 really\ninterested in what was going on, the pla \u2014 in the \u2014 the war crimes trials, I really\ndidn\u2019t care. All I knew was that they had gathered them all up in these buildings and\nso on, the SS people, and they had their war crimes trials there. And whoever was\nthere, most of them were hung. I don\u2019t think \u2014",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "A: Right.\nOctober 4, 2013",
        "A: Well, the thing is that nobody wanted \u2014 wanted to talk about their buddies and so\non, so that they didn\u2019t really have too much information. They knew that they were\nalready there, they knew they were guards, because they got them out of the guard \u2014\nthe guard buildings. So th-they would \u2014 one prisoner might tell about what the other\nguy did, or something like that. But it really didn\u2019t make any difference; if they\nwere guards, they were shot, and that was it. A lot of them were shot even before\nthe war crimes trials came there, and \u2014 the Americans were so upset about what\nthey saw there, cause they couldn\u2019t understand that these kind of things were\nhappening.",
        "A: And they just got the guards out of the building, right, so one day, the \u2014 they let\nthe prisoners out of the \u2014 out of the camp, out of \u2014 they cut the wire, and so on, or\nthe gates, and let them out. And they went up in the towers, and threw these guards\nright out the window, which are like three stories high, or something like that. And\nso the \u2014 some of them were \u2014 they ga \u2014 the inmates killed them. The-There was\nsome that I \u2014 that I never saw many women that were there, there were some that I\nti\u2014 I took a picture of one day and \u2014 but th \u2014 I don\u2019t know where they brought the\nwomen from, I have no idea. That really wasn\u2019t a women\u2019s camp, it was mostly for\nOctober 4, 2013\nmen. I think they were brought in right before the end of the war, and the people \u2014a\nlot of the women went into Dachau and smashed the \u2014 the windows. They had\nwomen\u2019s clothing hanging may \u2014 in there, you know, on a \u2014 some sort of a form or\nsome such thing in the window. And they just take the \u2014 their clothes off, standing\nright there in the window and \u2014 and put these new clothes on that they got out of the\n\u2014 out of Dachau stores. So it was pretty \u2014",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: Right",
        "A: \u2014 were let go out of the camp, so they went into Dachau, which is only like a\nhalf a mile away.",
        "A: The stores, that\u2019s right, the town, and they just smashed the windows if they\ncouldn\u2019t get in the store, if the door was locked, they just smashed the windows, and\nstanding in there, take all their clothes off, the rags that they had on, and put the\nnew clothes on that they found, you know, in the windows.",
        "A: But anyway, I \u2014 I saw one of the girls was mistreated by someone of the SS\nofficer, or some such thing. And she got a knife from a friend of mine and cut his\ntesticles off, right there in front of everybody. So, they didn\u2019t care. That\u2019s what I\u2019m\nsaying, 1-it was just a madhouse. Nobody \u2014 nobody knew \u2014 we knew that the\nAmericans were 1n control, and the Germans had to listen to whatever they did. If\nthey didn\u2019t listen, they got shot.",
        "A: It didn\u2019t make any difference. You know, Americans can be cruel, you know, I \u2014\nI\u2019ve seen things that \u2014 that Americans have done that are just as cruel as any\nGerman ever did, but \u2014",
        "A: Oh yeah, they did \u2014 they \u2014 they were bad news too, some of them. Especially the\nparatroopers. They were just young kids and they were \u2014 they were gung-ho, they\nwould kill anybody that they can shoot. It didn\u2019t matter a \u2014 a bit. But anyway,\nDachau was a\u2014amess. We got it cleaned up pretty well in the year I was there,\nand \u2014",
        "A: Oh yeah, I \u2014 yeah, yeah. Yeah, I left \u2014\nOctober 4, 2013",
        "A: Oh yeah, oh goodness yeah. But then a lot of things I didn\u2019t really want to see,\nyou know, I \u2014 like I say, I didn\u2019t go to the trials. I never went to hangings. I \u2014 I just\nwanted to get out. You know, I was married and I wanted to \u2014 I was just a young\nkid, really, and \u2014 and this was all new to me. I could never imagine these things\nhappening; how they treated other people.",
        "A: Oh, I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s \u2014 well, the Germans weren\u2019t allowed to have cameras,\nknives, anything that could hurt an American.",
        "A: And \u2014 but Alfons had his own camera, and that was one of our biggest problems.\nThe fil \u2014 the film we got might have been old, and we traded it for cigarettes, or\ncandy, or chocolate bars, or something like that. You couldn\u2019t walk to the grocery\nstore, or \u2014 or a\u2014 a drugstore and buy film there, there wasn\u2019t a such thing. In other\nwords, we get \u2014 we get film from people who already had it, and some of it was\ngood, and some of it wasn\u2019t. Sometimes you\u2019d give them a \u2014 a chocolate bar for a \u2014\na box of film, and it was no good, it was already exposed, as \u2014 so we got any kind\nof film at all that \u2014 that you could get your hands on.\nOctober 4, 2013",
        "A: Oh yeah, oh yeah, we both had, yeah, we were \u2014 well, we were allowed to have\ncameras, but \u2014 and of course, Alfons, I don\u2019t know where he got his camera, I have\nno idea, cause I \u2014 he could speak German, so he could go out and talk to these\npeople in Dachau and get things, and he was able to bring things back from the\nstores in Dachau [indecipherable] there, or steal or whatever he could do, you\nknow, he\u2019d just take it, you know, cause that \u2014 the Germans would give up anything\nbecause they \u2014 they just didn\u2019t want to be executed right there on the spot, yep.\nEnd of File One\nOctober 4, 2013\nBeginning File Two",
        "A: \u2014 yeah, that was a bad year, I'll tell you. I \u2014 I was glad to get out of there\n[indecipherable].",
        "A: That\u2019s okay. I don\u2019t mind.",
        "A: Well, what it actually \u2014 well, everybody \u2014 Alfons did the same thing, you know,\nwe'd pi \u2014 take a picture of the gate, or \u2014 or the \u2014 or people lining the \u2014 in the \u2014 th-\nthe \u2014 the cadavers were lying in the \u2014 the \u2014 the \u2014 the pick-up trucks. We were \u2014\nmaybe we thought it was going to be evidence sometime, y-you know, that maybe\nsomebody would want it, that\u2019s all. There was really no reason to \u2014 to take pictures,\nit was just that we wanted to do it, I guess for our own use later on. And \u2014 but I had\nthose pictures laying at home for years, and never looked at them anyway. I \u2014 I -",
        "A: Oh, Alfons, for some reason or other, he was able to do this in his office. I don\u2019t\nknow how he did it, where he got the film. I mean, he had a little closet like where\nhe would develop these film for me, and for him.",
        "A: And that\u2019s the only two cameras that were in the office, you know, just his and\nmine. And then we\u2019d get film all different sizes. A lot of times you couldn\u2019t use it\nanyway, because it was \u2014 you know, it was exposed, or whatever.",
        "A: Oh my heavens, yeah, loads of them. Oh, the film wasn\u2019t any good, a lot of it,\nyou know, and \u2014 and so how would we know\u201d? We didn\u2019t know, you put it in the\ncamera and then it came out black, or whatever [indecipherable]",
        "A: Cause there was no color, it was all black and white, and you know, th \u2014 the\nfilm. we\u2019d \u2014 we\u2019d borrow the film, you know, we \u2014 if we \u2014 we\u2019d go into Dachau\nand talk to these people who we heard maybe had film. And then we\u2019d say, well,\nwe ll \u2014 we\u2019ll give you maybe \u2014 I couldn\u2019t speak German because Alfons could, so\nhe was always the interpreter. So anyway, he would get [indecipherable] these\npeople who had film, and then we\u2019d give them whatever we had to give them,\nOctober 4, 2013\nmaybe C-rations, or whatever it was, just for the film, because they wanted to sell\nit. They wanted our \u2014 our things. They \u2014 they considered our bread as \u2014 as cake, and\nI liked their bread better, because it was dark bread. But our \u2014 all the fellows that I\nhad in the office, they le \u2014 really liked our bread. They thought it was cake at times,\ncause it was white.",
        "A: And theirs is dark. But I liked the dark bread.",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "A: Oh, I \u2014 that\u2019s what I understand so, yeah. Oh, I \u2014 I used to \u2014 I loved that stuff,\nyeah. We \u2014 we\u2019d gallons of \u2014 of peanut butter and grape jelly, and I\u2019d put that\npeanut butter and grape jelly on this dark bread; that was really good, you know.\nBut if you didn\u2019t have anything else to eat, I guess that was all right. But \u2014 but we\nhad \u2014 we had [indecipherable] rations. Then after the Americans came in, they\nopened up the kitchen, and then we had good food that we knew \u2014 that was there.\nWell, I remember the \u2014 the Thanksgiving that we were there, I went over to the \u2014\nwhere the other Americans were, where they were eating in the dining room, and it\nwas Thanksgiving day, and somebody \u2014 one of the cooks in \u2014 American cooks told\nOctober 4, 2013\none of the German assistants to go get the salt. Anyway, he got the \u2014 the soapsud \u2014\nthe soap powder, and put that in the mashed potatoes. And \u2014 and everybo \u2014\neverybody was standing out in the hall, they gotta get in the toilet [indecipherable]\ndown \u2014 down the aisle there, you know, and fortunately I didn\u2019t eat any of the\nmashed potatoes. I \u2014 I\u2014 I was really glad I didn\u2019t after that, Pll tell you. But these\nguys were standing out there \u2014 somebody had gone in their pants, and everything\nelse, you know. I didn\u2019t \u2014 they were eating soap in their mashed potatoes.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Aw, it was \u2014 but I\u2014I say, you know, it was a rat race. It was just th \u2014 it was n \u2014\neverything was turmoil, you know, for months, because there was really not that\nmuch instruction on what to do. All we wanted to do was get rid of the SS.",
        "A: You know, get rid of the offi \u2014 get rid of the officers, get rid of the people who\nmistreated all these people for years, and just get rid of them, you know, and that\nwas it. And I guess we each had our own little places to be, and that\u2019s where we\nstayed, and we didn\u2019t \u2014 we didn\u2019t make it \u2014 any noise anywhere, because if you did,\nyou \u2014 you\u2019d get into the trouble. So we \u2014 we didn\u2019t really \u2014\nOctober 4, 2013",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: That\u2019s correct, that\u2019s all.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Oh no, no, no, these \u2014 this was just to handle the people that were \u2014 that were\nofficers or guards there in Dachau.",

Maybe one time, maybe that\nsomebody didn\u2019t like the other guy, or something like that, he would say, well, he\ndid this or that, or he \u2014 he mistreated somebody, or something like that. Well, that\nwas only recorded, and that was it. So it ended up mostly everybody was either\nhung or shot or whatever anyway, it didn\u2019t make any difference.",
        "A: Oh sure, yeah, after \u2014 after the thing got started right, yeah, because there was\nlike \u2014 there were dozens of \u2014 of guards there, and the commandant and so on. And \u2014\nand all these people, they had a lot of officers there, from the SS, and they were all\ntried there, right there at Dachau.",
        "A: No, they \u2014 most of them were try to get out of the place. They didn\u2019t \u2014 they \u2014\nthey might have said some things about maybe certain ones that they were \u2014 they\nwere mishandled by, but \u2014 but they ne \u2014 they are \u2014 there was \u2014 wasn\u2019t much \u2014 there\nwere \u2014 there really wasn\u2019t much discussion about the prisoners. They were just glad\nto get out of that fence, and get out of them barracks. They would sleep anywhere in\nthe buildings, or wherever they could, you know, summer \u2014 was warm at the time,\ncause we got there in May, and then we got summer, but then in wintertime it got\nOctober 4, 2013\ncold, and but bo \u2014 most of the people were gone a \u2014 after I left \u2014 I mean, they were\ngone before I left, really.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, most of them \u2014 well, the ones that had someplace to go, or the ones\nthat could walk, they would go. Otherwise, you couldn\u2019t go, they just had to stay\nthere, and we fed them, whatever we could do with them, til they finally did go.",
        "A: But they may have had friends or somebody, maybe they knew somebody, or\nthey \u2014 they\u2019d just walk into houses and throw the people out, you know, take over\nthe house, you know, they were \u2014 pardon me, prisoners for \u2014 of the Germans for a\nwhile, and they just wanted to get out of the camp, just get out of there quickly as\nthey could.",
        "A: Oh yeah, they \u2014",
        "A: Oh sure, that\u2019s right, they \u2014 you bet they did. And I \u2014 I understand now though,\nthat a lot of of those people who were the \u2014 most of them are gone, they wouldn\u2019t \u2014\nthere was no discussion about what happened with any of these people. But the-they\nOctober 4, 2013\nwere going to Dachau and they\u2019d steal food, or whatever, they \u2014 they\u2019d just knock\npeople down and take whatever they had. They \u2014 yo-you walk into the houses, hey,\nthey were prisoners there, so why \u2014 they were glad to get out. So \u2014 so they had no\nidea what \u2014 what was going to be happening to them or anything else. So they \u2014 I \u2014\nI could understand, if you were in Dachau and you were from Poland, you had a\nlong way to go to get back to where \u2014 another country. And we had people there\nfrom 31 different countries. So, lord, they came from all around, Austria\n[indecipherable] you know, and who knows where. There were no Americans\nthere that I know of, none at all.",

Or Alfons \u2014 most of those were \u2014 were friends of his, and he\n\u2014 they were all from \u2014 from Poland, so they knew how to get along with each other,\nand then Alfons would translate what they said to me, 1-in \u2014 in English. So that was\na big help to me, let me tell you. I w \u2014 I wouldn\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t know how I could have\never operated there without him being there.

        "A: And I never had any contact with him after we left there. Like I say, he was still\nthere when I left. So I \u2014 I have no idea, I don\u2019t know his address. I used to hear\nfrom \u2014 from others \u2014 pardon me, Erkar(ph), from Hungary, who was a prisoner of\nours who would come in and clean up my \u2014 my bedroom, and clean the office, and\nhe would \u2014 if any cigarettes were \u2014 cigarette butts were around, he\u2019d tear them apart\nand save the tobacco.

        "A: Nylon. Nylons were just coming out after the war, and he would write and tell\nme \u2014 he\u2019d send me stamps and stuff like that. He was a postman in Hungary,\nwhere, I don\u2019t remember any more. And my wife and I used to get a kick out of it,\nshe\u2019d say, well, here\u2019s a \u2014 another letter for \u2014 for silk stockings or nylon stockings.\nAnd I\u2019d send him a \u2014 we sent them a couple of times, and that was it, then he didn\u2019t\nOctober 4, 2013\nwrite me any more.

I re \u2014I really didn\u2019t want\nto upset her, beca \u2014 tell her where I was, because she didn\u2019t know if I was a prisoner\nor not, or what I was, you know, I was just there.

        "A: Because I was just married, and one \u2014 yeah, I mean, I wanted to just get home,\nthat\u2019s all. I saw enough, you know, and knowing \u2014 I didn\u2019t mind too much the\ntravel, or wherever barracks, and so on, or the buzz bombs and stuff like this.

However, I wouldn\u2019t have known what was going on\nOctober 4, 2013\nanyway, you know. That wa \u2014 that was too far-fetched for me, that \u2014 that was way\nover my head.",
        "A: Yeah, it was \u2014I got \u2014I got out in April of \u2014 of \u201946.",
        "A: Yeah. Yeah, wa \u2014",
        "A: Well, we \u2014 we just took little tours. One of my \u2014 one of my American friends\nwas supposed to collect food for the prisoners over there, which was a farce. And\nanyway, somehow he finagled a German command car, one of them big, open jobs\nthat th \u2014 that the Germans had. And we had a \u2014 an SS officer and a Wehrmacht\nsoldier. And the four of us used to take trips, and we were looking for food. So\nanyway, these two guys there, the \u2014 the German SS offer \u2014 and the funny thing was\nthat he was from Hanover, Germany. His family had owned a \u2014 a \u2014 a \u2014 wheat\nmills and so on, they were grinders, they grind up for \u2014 for food, and so on. And I\nasked him one day how he \u2014 he could speak English, and he said \u2014 I asked him how\nhe \u2014 he got into the service, and the SS. And he said, well, Hitler said, like the Boy\nScouts were \u2014 had to go in this type of service, and \u2014 and the Girl Scouts were over\nOctober 4, 2013\nhere, and \u2014 and these groups were over, but a \u2014 he put them 1n important positions,\nbut he ended up in the SS. And anyway, we used to take these trips down to the\nmountain \u2014 in the mountains, in the Alps, the four of us. The \u2014 the werman \u2014\nGerman Wehrmacht guy, he would \u2014 he would drive, and sometimes I\u2019d sit in the\nback with this SS officer, who we got out of the camp. We were able to take him\nout wi \u2014 you know, get in the \u2014",
        "A: Oh no, no, he wasn\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t know how he got out, but he did. The both of\nthem got out. Maybe I helped them, I don\u2019t know, but anyway, wa \u2014 but we can \u2014\nwe used to take trips any time down the mountains. And this one guy, the SS\nofficer, he knew some German general\u2019s wife that lived down there, I forget what\nthe town was, but it was occupied by the French. And they brought all these French\nMoroccans out of Africa, up there to the occupation army. And the \u2014 and I\nremember we were standing up there high in the window, we were looking down at\nthese people, and these guys in their robes, and so on. And the \u2014 the Americans\nused to bring meat out there, big legs of lamb and stuff like that. And they have in\nthe truck \u2014 there was no \u2014 there was no cooling \u2014",

        "A: No refrigera \u2014 they just brought it in trucks, they throw it on the ground, and no\n\u2014 these guys would pick it up, they\u2019d take it away and they just ate it, and so on. But\nwe'd stand up in this wom \u2014 this woman\u2019s house, and we\u2019d look down, see this stuff\ngoing on. But yeah, they \u2014 they a \u2014 they had hardly finagled that car \u2014 I \u2014 I still\ndon\u2019t know how they ever got that car, I don\u2019t know. But my friend Davros(ph)\nasked me along. We went to a\u2014 a funny part, we went to a Kraft cheese factory one\nday, and got cheese. Another place this guy knew, whoever, could get eggs. Why\nwe did it, I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know what we ever did with this stuff anyway.\nA2: This is after that happened, right?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Oh yeah, we tha \u2014 while we were in Dachau, yeah, yeah. I don\u2019t know where\nthey got the car from, I guess it was from one of the officers had this car there.

        "A: I saw some, but I\u2014 I saw them, but I wouldn\u2019t have known that I \u2014 I met them \u2014\nwe were in a \u2014 before we \u2014 I got to Dachau, we were in a \u2014 ake \u2014 a training camp\nwhere they \u2014 they tested all their guns, and so on. And their \u2014 the Russians were\ncoming in to take over, and I met some there. But nobody liked \u2014 even the\nAmericans didn\u2019t like the Russians, even though they were on our side, that we di \u2014\nwe didn\u2019t care for them. They were \u2014",
        "A: In fact, I\u2014 my neighbor down the street here, he met some Russians, and he\ndidn\u2019t \u2014 they didn\u2019t like them either. They \u2014 I don\u2019t know, they had their lifestyle, I\nguess, and us \u2014 and we \u2014 we couldn\u2019t \u2014 we couldn\u2019t get along with them at all. But I\nknew the Germans and the \u2014 and the Russians didn\u2019t like each other at all. They\nwere \u2014 like these two guys I said were draftsmen, they didn\u2019t want to go back to\nBerlin.",
        "A: Never. Never got to [indecipherable] always seven miles away. You know, the\nthing was, I always \u2014 when we were at Dachau, there was \u2014 I always wanted to get\nout, you know, and I didn\u2019t take any trips that I could have gone out in \u2014 down the\nmountains, there were these guys, cause I knew the other American was with me.\nBut we \u2014 I never took any \u2014 I could \u2014 I couldn\u2019t go on \u2014 I went to Munich a couple\nOctober 4, 2013\nof times, and I liked the city. But that was mostly all gone anyway. The buildings\nwere di \u2014 just ruined, everything was ruined.",
        "A: We got in in May.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, right.",

        "A: Yeah, 40 \u2014 \u201946. Trying to get my mind here together. I got \u2014 no, I got out in\nApril. That wouldn\u2019t be right. I was still there in April, I got May \u2014 out in May of\n\u201946, yeah, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, right, yeah.\nOctober 4, 2013",
        "A: Not very much. I think it\u2019s after \u2014 after the war crimes people got out, a lot of it\nwas torn down, like I said about this man telling me a lot of \u2014 a lot of buildings\nwere disposed of. They took all the \u2014 they took all the barracks down, I understand,\neverything.",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "A: Oh, that was still there.",
        "A: Everything was there.",
        "A: Oh no, a lot of them left.",
        "A: Oh yeah, pretty well, yeah, pretty well.",
        "A: Only the people didn\u2019t know where to go, they were the only ones that stayed.",
        "A: Well, there were some un \u2014 some German prisoners there yet, but not many, they\nwere gone, they knew where to go. They \u2014 they knew where they lived, and so on.\nOctober 4, 2013\nBut these prisoners, the poor souls, they didn\u2019t know where they were from. They\nknew where they were from, but they \u2014 how they were gonna get there.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, right. There were still some there because they didn\u2019t \u2014 well, a lot of them\ndidn\u2019t know where to go.",
        "A: Th-They were confused, a lot of them were \u2014 well, they has spent a lot of time\nthere maybe, and they \u2014 they were too confused, they didn\u2019t know where to go. And\nthey couldn\u2019t walk, a lot of them couldn\u2019t walk. So I think eventually they took\nthese people back. They just put them on American trucks and took them wherever\nthey wanted to go, or something like that. That\u2019s what I understood, anyway, but I\nwasn\u2019t there when they did that, I don\u2019t know. They had to get rid of them\nsomehow, you had 30,000 people, that\u2019s a lot of people, let me tell you.",
        "A: And they had to get rid of them. So, the Americans didn\u2019t want them there, you\nknow, they just wanted to close the camp up and get out. They wanted to get out as\nquickly as you could.\nOctober 4, 2013",
        "A: Yeah, I saw some \u2014 some lampshades that the commandant\u2019s wife made out \u2014\nout of human skin in the \u2014 1n the house [indecipherable] that stuff was still there.",
        "A: Oh, it was in the house, yeah. The \u2014 the commandant\u2019s house was about in the\ncenter of camp, so we Americans took it over. I don\u2019t know who was in charge, I\nhave no idea, but I know I was told to come there a couple of times, and I saw this\nstuff. There was still the \u2014 the \u2014 the furnishings were still there. Maybe they were\ngonna use it for evidence, I don\u2019t know. I had \u2014",
        "A: Something similar to this, except it was darker, that\u2019s all. She has it stretched\nout, you know. Was more just straight things here, that\u2019s all.",
        "A: Oh yeah, sure, like your living room, yeah, yeah. I remember some of the\nfurniture and stuff they \u2014 they had \u2014 all that stuff was still there.",
        "A: I guess he must have used it for evidence, I don\u2019t know.\nOctober 4, 2013",
        "A: I don\u2019t know why. I don\u2019t know why.",
        "A: But I know I was there three times, I was there. Maybe \u2014 I don\u2019t know, maybe \u2014",
        "A: I think his wife was there, too. I think he had some children there.",
        "A: No. All the Americans are in charge of it see, so \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 I was just told to come there one day for a meeting or something like that.\nThat\u2019s all it was. People gotta do this or that, or somebody\u2019s this \u2014 was there. You\nknow, there\u2019s a couple of American officers there, and \u2014 but I was just one of\nmaybe 10 people that were there, that\u2019s all. All Americans were there, only \u2014 only\nAmericans were invited.",
        "A: But, yeah, we were just still there. We were gonna do this or that, or we\u2019re gonna\n\u2014 we\u2019re gonna move here, or we\u2019re gonna open this kind of a building or something\nOctober 4, 2013\nlike that. There was no really big instructions. I think it was more of a \u2014 a ti-time to\ndrink wine. That\u2019s about all, yeah.",
        "A: You know, I don\u2019t know. Somebody \u2014 there was some there \u2014 well, the\nAmerican officers were there, and some guy came in to \u2014 on the office one day and\ntold me that I could leave. I was the only American there, of course. So, he said, get\nyour things and \u2014 and come down to headquarters. And then we got on a truck, and\nwent to Munich and got on a train, and went to \u2014 to Bremerhaven, and that was it.\nThey gave us a ca\u2014a quart of Four Roses whiskey when we got on the train. And\nthe train was real cold because it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s three guys sit here, and three people over\nhere, it\u2019s like \u2014 well, you know how they are, the coaches with, I think there\u2019s six\npeople or something like that.",
        "A: Yeah. And I drank all my booze, I\u2019m taking all my clothes off, I\u2019m getting hot.\nThese here guys are all sitting there freezing. Oh God, you know, I \u2014I guess these\nwere \u2014 this whiskey warmed me up, because that\u2019s the first I ever had any whi \u2014 any\nbooze. But you know, I ha \u2014 the other people, they used to tell me, in the Pacific,\nthey\u2019d give them beer out there, Americans dis-distribute beer and all that sort of\nOctober 4, 2013\nthing. I never got any of that stuff. We got \u2014 when we got on the train, somebody\nhanded me a bottle of whiskey, and that was it. That\u2019s the only thing I ever got from\nanybody. We got a\u2014a pack of cigar \u2014 I mean, a carton of cigarettes a week, that\u2019s\nwhy everybody used to smoke. But we got tobacco for a pipe or something like that,\nonce in a while. But I never got anything that was given to me, other than that\nwhiskey [indecipherable] on the train.",
        "A: Let me tell you, by the time I got to mid-Germany, that booze was gone.\n[indecipherable]",
        "A: We were on \u2014 we were on a troop ship.",
        "A: What happened, it was a freighter, really. The \u2014 the Americans would take\nGerman prisoners, and bring them back to the USA to work over here, on farms, in\nfactories and stuff like that. They were really the fortunate ones, that when that ship\ncame back, they\u2019d bring these prisoners back, the German prisoners back. It was all\npainted, it was really \u2014 everything was nice and clean for us. So, we came back on ji\n\u2014 on \u2014 got on the ship, and, in fact I have a picture in that book, of me standing on\nthe boat. And it took about 10 days to get home, I think we hit a storm or something\nOctober 4, 2013\ncoming back. But it was on a troop ship, but it was nice and clean, cause the\nGermans had painted everything, and it was, you know, it was neat. So they were\nusing [indecipherable] in the States. But then I heard a lot of stories about\nprisoners back here that \u2014 German prisoners that were pretty well treated some \u2014\nback here, I'll tell you. They had good \u2014 they didn\u2019t have to work on farms and\nfactories and stuff. In fact two guys over here the other day, they were telling me\nabout some of the prisoners that were \u2014 they knew people here who had taken care\nof them, you know, and brought them back. So they \u2014",
        "A: New York. We left from New York on the Queen Elizabeth, that took us five\ndays to get there. It was really fast. That ship traveled alone, it didn\u2019t go in a convoy\nlike all the others.",
        "A: No, no \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 we came back on a troop ship.",
        "A: Yeah, right, a freighter. But we went over on \u2014\nOctober 4, 2013",
        "A: \u2014 there were 21,000 G.I.s on there, and \u2014 and 4,000 crew and 4,000 civilians\nwere on that ship.",
        "A: Yeah, right. Going over.",
        "A: Going over. I never saw such a big ship in my life before we saw it. Well, I\nnever saw a ship before.",
        "A: But anyway, we got on there, and boy if a \u2014 a torpedo had ever hit that thing,\nthey\u2019d a lost a lot of people, let me tell you.",
        "A: But it would zigzag like this, it \u2014 1t goes like that across the ocean, because every\nsix minutes the ship would change course, because it took seven minutes for a\nGerman submarine to get on target. And that\u2019s why they \u2014 they\u2019d zigzag. And the\nlast night out, before we came up the Firth of Clyde, that ship was really bouncing\nback and forth, because they said they had a \u2014 a \u2014 a notice that maybe there was a\nsubmarine close by, so there was \u2014 that was really a bounce around, but it was a\nnice ride. We went over in August, it was beautiful weather. And then we \u2014 we\nstayed up on deck most of the time. I slept on deck almost every night, because I\nOctober 4, 2013\nknew I was down in D deck, so I\u2014 I never \u2014 I\u2019d never get out of there. That was a \u2014\nthat was a full ship, let me tell you. All them big dining rooms were filled up with\ndel \u2014 double decker c-cots. Some of them were three and \u2014 three high, you had to\nclimb up there to get to them. I was fortunate, I had a nice cot down in \u2014 somebody\nwas above me, I think, in \u2014 1n one the state rooms. A nice ship, a big ship, let me\ntell you. A big boat.",
        "A: Oh no, oh no, no. I had to go down to New Jersey to a \u2014 a de-depot there, an\narmy camp, where some guy was \u2014 he\u2019d \u2014 he was gonna sign us out. And he had\nonly been the \u2014 in the service about two months, I think it was, and he said, don\u2019t\nyou want to join the \u2014 the National Guard or \u2014 or the reserves? I said hell no, if you\nwant to join, you go ahead and join. Let me tell you right now, I\u2019ve had all the army\nI want. Yeah, he \u2014 he \u2014 he wanted me to sign up, I said no way. I\u2019m not signing up\nfor nothing, let me tell you. Nope. I ca\u2014I came back on \u2014 then we got a train out of\nsomewhere in New Jersey \u2014 no, I got a bus to Philadelphia, and then we got a train\nfrom Philadelphia to Lancaster, Pennsylvania. And \u2014 and the \u2014 the car, th-the car\nhad a potbellied stove right in the middle, that\u2019s how he heated the car. Oh jeez.\nOctober 4, 2013\nReally antiquated. Oh God, I can\u2019t believe that something like that happened. But\nthat\u2019s the way it was, you know, yeah.",
        "A: No way.",
        "A: No. We had [indecipherable] on the third floor apartment, and I got a \u2014 a taxi to\ngo home. Nobody there [indecipherable] me, no, nobody. Hell, nobody was there. I\ncame home alone, yeah.",
        "A: Sure was. She sure was surprised. I told her I was going to come home\nsometime, you know. Hell, we didn\u2019t have a telephone, and I \u2014 nobody had\ntelephones, nobody \u2014 I didn\u2019t buy a c \u2014I gotta borrow a car. Some guy was there\nwith me. He worked in a ga\u2014 ina Chrysler garage in York, so he told me to buy a\nca \u2014 a uSed car, cause cars weren\u2019t made during the war, and they \u2014 they only had\nthe cars before the war, and they started making them after the war, but wa \u2014 there\nwas \u2014 there was all used cars. And I had a big Chrysler, some beer magnate from\nYork, he owned the car, and he traded in for something else. And I could actually\nlay out in the trunk of the car, was a one-seater. I could lay out this way, not\nsideways, I could la \u2014\nOctober 4, 2013",
        "A: \u2014 that\u2019s how \u2014 how big the trunk was, I could stretch out like that, that\u2019s how\nbig. Beth(ph) said, what in the world do you want with this kind of big car? I said,\nit\u2019s just a car, that\u2019s all. Just something to drive around, you didn\u2019t have anything.\nWe sold our \u2014 we had a new Nash that we bought right before \u2014 about two \u2014 when I\nw \u2014 I worked in Baltimore and \u2014 and we had this Nash, and we sold it a couple\nhours before, cause she couldn\u2019t drive, so we sold it a couple of hours right before I\nwent in the service. S-So, we had that money.",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "A: When I came back?",
        "A: Okay. I went back to my old buddy. We built a house here in Hanover, and I\nwent back with my old architect friend here downtown, who I had known before\nthat \u2014 before I got in. And I went with him for a couple of years, I guess it was.\nThen I got my license in 1950, and I \u2014 I was registered in five states: New York,\nNew Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania.\nOctober 4, 2013",

I did work for other people, then I\ndid work for a Baltimore firm when they were doing the Baltimore City Hall.\nThings like that, that sort of nice projects, yeah.

He didn\u2019t want to build houses, always just \u2014 and I\nwas quite busy with \u2014 just with him, doing these farm buildings, because everybody\nused to have a \u2014 had had a bar \u2014 a \u2014 a horse farm or something like that, a riding\narena.
