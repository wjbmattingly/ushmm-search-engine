So, the \u2014 the only thing I remember of before we\nwere in Vienna was my going into a store in Prague, Czechoslovakia and saying\n[speaks Czech here]. That\u2019s the only thing I remember. So whenever I meet\nsomebody \u2014",

We stored \u2014 we had\nto store whatever f\u2014 we could bring out, which was some fur \u2014 lot of furniture, and\n\u2014 and personal papers. We had to store them in Prague. And I don\u2019t know why we\nhad to store them in Prague, but we did. And they were stored there all during the\nwar, and when I was in England already, and my mother was too, she paid for\nstorage, all during the war she kept up the payment through \u2014 through an aunt we\nhad in \u2014 in Zurich, in Switzerland. We \u2014 the aunt forwarded the money to \u2014 to \u2014",
        "Q: Oh, so it was still being stored in \u2014",
        "A: It was still being stored. And in 1946, when my mother wrote to \u2014 to bring it\nover, they wrote back and said it\u2019s not there anymore. The \u2014 you know, first it was\nthe Nazis and then it was the Russians. And they had no idea what happened to it,\nso \u2014 there was a lot of \u2014 all our personal stuff was there.",

I wrote to them and I researched it, I Googled it, I did everything\nI could, re \u2014 nobody \u2014 they said that from during the war years it was just totally cut\noff and the company now is a different comp \u2014 with the same name, but it\u2019s a totally\ndifferent company.",

        "Q: So when he arrived he was already very sick and \u2014",
        "A: Well, he really \u2014 he was a very strong man, he was very sporty. He was an\namateur soccer player for Czechoslovakia, actually, and all the photographs from\nthe newspaper and that were in \u2014 in Prague and \u2014 which were lost. But he was very\nstrong man, and I don\u2019t \u2014 he \u2014 appar \u2014 we-well, the story from my mother was that\nthey \u2014 at the hospital, when he was hospitalized they told her, after a while, that she\ncould come and pick him up the next day. He had \u2014 he had had tubes in his\nstomach. And so when she went the next day with his clothes, he wasn\u2019t there, and\nthey said he had died in the night. She went sort of crazy for a while.",
        "Q: Do you remember that period, or only from your mother\u2019s \u2014\nOctober 16, 2010",
        "A: That is from what my mother told me. I \u2014 I know that I was not with her.

And sh \u2014 I was with some fr-friends that they had\nmade, she played bridge a lot my mother, and these were bridge friends from\nVienna.",

But I never \u2014 I \u2014 I don\u2019t\nremember meeting him. [phone ringing] Yeah, 1-it was many, many years later, in\nCalifornia that I, by accident, met another member of my father\u2019s family, and\nactually a second cousin.",

        "A: No, he was Viennese, yeah.",
        "Q: Okay. So you did learn about the family from \u2014",
        "A: Well, this person wrote a biography, and in fact, I was just reading through it, I\nwas trying to find something about my father. But it\u2019s not a lot. What he said was\nthat there was a split in the family between those that had some money, and those\nthat didn\u2019t have money. The ones that didn\u2019t have money were sort of artists. Artists\nkind of were black sheep of the family, and he would b \u2014 he belonged to the black\nsheep of the family, but I-I didn\u2019t learn anything very much [inaudible]\nOctober 16, 2010",
        "Q: But he did remember your father? [phone ringing]",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: So your father died soon after \u2014",
        "A: He died \u2014 right, he died in 1936.",
        "Q: In 1936.",
        "A: And left my mother and me without any resources, because they \u2014 there was no\nmon \u2014 had no money, so my mother had to \u2014 my mother was a perfectionist, and\nwhatever she did, she did perfectly. So she learned how to make leather flowers,\nand she bought a \u2014 the equipment for it and then she made the flowers and went up\nand down stairs in Vienna trying to sell it. And I think this was the \u2014 this \u2014 well, I\u2019ll\nget onto that later on. Because of the ec \u2014 our economic conditions was \u2014 helped to\nput me on the Kindertransport, because they tried to get chil \u2014 people \u2014 children\nout from \u2014 well, both those that were well connected and those that were in need.\nSo, I guess [inaudible]",
        "Q: And where did you live in Vienna? With the family friend?",
        "A: We lived eve \u2014 no, we lived in an apartment right in \u2014 in the first\n[indecipherable]. And I went to school, to the Volksschule.",
        "Q: So, did you rent an apartment there?\nOctober 16, 2010",
        "A: Yeah, I ki\u2014 I \u2014I don\u2019t know how much help my mother got from these friends,\nI\u2019m not sure. You know, there are all these questions that I wish I would have\nasked.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: My mother lived long enough, to 93, and she did tell me, I mean, I \u2014 I know a lot\nof it, but there, the questions like this \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah, you never asked.",
        "A:\u2014I don\u2019t know where did the money come from, that she \u2014 but \u2014 but knowing\nmy mother, she probably worked night and day and made enough money, I don\u2019t\nknow, made enough money to pay for the apartment. But it was not for very long,\ncause you know, 36, I was [inaudible]",
        "Q: So, what do you remember from Vienna? You say you went to school there?",
        "A: Yes, I [coughing] excuse me.",
        "Q: No problem.",
        "A: The things I remember from Vienna are not happy memories. They\u2019re probably\nthe worst memories I have of the war. And that\u2019s why it\u2019s so ironic that my father\nsaid we should go to Vienna because it\u2019ll be safer in Vienna, because as far as I\u2019m\nconcerned, if anything could have been worse than Germany, it was Austria. I\u2019m\nsure you\u2019ve heard that a lot. My memories are of people \u2014 well, of ki\u2014\nOctober 16, 2010\nKristallnacht, of people marching in the streets, with the boots, and the heil\nHitlers, and what have you \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah, we\u2019ll get \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, we\u2019ll get to that.",
        "Q: We need first, like what would you remember before Kristallnacht. Do yo \u2014 do\nyou \u2014 do you have any good memories, like any memories? Wha \u2014 you started\ngoing to school, did you \u2014",
        "A: [had a\u2014 I have all my report cards and I remember one of the teachers who had\nto tell me that I couldn\u2019t go back to school.",
        "Q: When was that?",
        "A: Thirty \u2014 I think I went until early \u201938. And I \u2014 I\u2019ve tried to research that, I wrote\nto the school, and I \u2014 I have the report cards and I have her name. And I\u2019ve asked\npeople to \u2014 when they go to Vienna to see if they can find her name. But she was\nvery, very nice, and she was \u2014 she had tears in her eyes, I remember that, she had\ntears in her eyes when she told me I couldn\u2019t come back. And I remember being\nstoned \u2014 having stones thrown at me in Vienna. A-And I have \u2014 I have no good\nmemories of Vienna whatsoever.",
        "Q: Did you have any friends at school?\nOctober 16, 2010",
        "A: [had one friend called Litzie(ph) Barotti(ph), and she came over to England\ntoo but I \u2014 not on the Kindertransport I don\u2019t think. I\u2019d lost touch with her once\nshe moved to \u2014 to England. But otherwise I have \u2014",
        "Q: It\u2019s okay.",
        "A: \u2014I have no memories, unfortunately. Or fortunately. I think it\u2019s probably\nfortunately. And I \u2014 oh, okay.",
        "Q: Go ahe \u2014",
        "A: No, I was going to say one of the memories I have is \u2014 this was Kristallnacht,\nbut you don\u2019t want to come to that yet.",
        "Q: Oh, I first wanted to learn more about \u2014 cause you did spend like \u2014 it was two\nyears, you came in *36 and there was \u00b038, so \u2014",
        "A: I think yeah \u2014 I think probably my lack of memory there 1s due to the fact that\nwe moved from Berlin to Czechoslovakia. This is, you know, as a six year old\nchild, or a seven year old child at that time. And then my father died, and then, you\nknow, we were \u2014 I was pretty much alone in Vienna cause my mother went sort of\ncrazy for a while. And I think, you know, psychologically, if I probably went under\nhypnosis it would come back, but it could well be that I\u2019ve just \u2014 as a child it was\ntoo much. And I was very protective of my mother, so I subdued any fears and\nOctober 16, 2010\nfeelings that I had that were \u2014 that were probably pretty ghastly. I didn\u2019t want to\nworry my mother anymore, because I knew she was, you know, very \u2014",
        "Q: So she had a breakdown \u2014",
        "A: I think it was a \u2014 probably a breakdown, yes, she just \u2014 I think it was three days\nthat she was gone, just wandering around Vienna, you know.",
        "Q: And you were all by yourself?",
        "A: I was with these friends of hers, yeah.",
        "Q: What about your parents, were \u2014 were they religious?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: They were not religious.",
        "A: Absolutely.",
        "Q: They were Jewish.",
        "A: They were like \u2014 yes, Jewish, but they were like most German Jews, they were \u2014",
        "Q: Would they go to the synagogue?",
        "A: \u2014 they considered themselves German first, and then Jewish.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Yeah, I \u2014I think we had Christmas trees \u2014",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: \u2014 and I \u2014 I never \u2014 I don\u2019t ever remember going to temple.\nOctober 16, 2010",
        "Q: Oh. So now let\u2019s go to the Kristallnacht and your memories from \u2014",
        "A: Okay, my memories of that \u2014",
        "Q: Was that the first time that you experienced the anti-Semitism, or was it before\nthat that you \u2014",
        "A: Well, the \u2014 at school I wa \u2014 when this \u2014 this [phone ringing] Cut it out. It\u2019s\nokay. When I was being \u2014 when I had stones thrown at me, I don\u2019t know now\nwhether I realized that that was anti-Semitism, that it was because I was Jewish, I\ndon\u2019t know. I just \u2014 I was very, very feisty, very \u2014 and I would throw stones back.\nAnd I was \u2014 you know, I defended myself. I was always very independent, and \u2014",
        "Q: Was it other children at school were \u2014",
        "A: There weren\u2019t many \u2014 as far as I remember, there were only \u2014 in my class, I\nthink there were three of us, and I do remember having to sit at the back of the class\nwith two or three rows e-empty between us and then the non-Jewish children were\nat the front. Now again, I don\u2019t \u2014 I can\u2019t honestly say that I knew why I was there,\nwhy I was in the back. I obviously knew there was something wrong with me, oh \u2014\nI was having to sit at the back, but that it was anti-Semitism, I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s very\n\u2014I wish I could sort that out in my mind, whether I knew or not, but it was \u2014",
        "Q: Do you remember when you first realized that you were being discriminated\nbecause you were Jewish?\nOctober 16, 2010",
        "A: Probably in England, which is interesting. Where I was being called German\nJewish refugee, and then I \u2014 oh, how I hated those \u2014 being called a German Jewish\nrefugee. But I \u2014 I can\u2019t be honest with that and say yes, I remember that, I \u2014 I don\u2019t.",
        "Q: So Kristallnacht, the memories \u2014",
        "A: Okay, the memories of that, what really stands out is I \u2014 I ha \u2014 must have had\nsome friends that I played with at the central synagogue in Vienna. It was the big\none, apparently. We played inside or just outside and Kristallnacht, I remember\ncoming out of the temple, and seeing on either side of the temple were Nazis in\nuniform with their guns. I came out, and there was a cobblestone \u2014 all cobblestones\nin front of the synagogue, and there were the old people on their knees, scrubbing\nwith toothbrushes. And I remember kickings to go faster, a-and \u2014 and people\nlaughing. I remember people laughing. You know [indecipherable] sort of like if\nyou saw it on the film they were just sort of like, you know, pieces of \u2014 of memory\nthat \u2014 th-that are photographic in my mind. You know, th-the boots, the laughing of\nthe \u2014 the people there, the kicks that they got, and the cobblestones with \u2014 with\ntoothbrushes. And then I remember the \u2014 the fear I had of going home to the\napartment and not knowing whether I could get in or not, because apartments and\nhouses were being sealed, they had seals on them, and if they had seals on them that\nmeans you couldn\u2019t go in any more. And I remember that fear, am-am-am \u2014 am I\nOctober 16, 2010\ngoing to be able to get in or not? And of course all the \u2014 the glass, and seeing all the\n\u2014 the damage. And the people, the friends that my mother had, that she used to play\nbridge with, and that really helped us during this time, that took me in. They had a \u2014\na tie shop, men\u2019s tie shop at the bottom of the building, of the apartment building,\nand na \u2014 seeing all of that glass and broken, and I remember that.",
        "Q: Do you remember their names, the people who ha \u2014",
        "A: Klempner(ph), yes, Polly and Julius Klempner(ph), uh-huh.",
        "Q: Did they have children?",
        "A: They had children that they had a boy and a girl who were probably \u2014 I was\neight, 18 \u2014 who were probably 12 years older than I was. And \u2014 and I \u2014 we kept in\ncontact, they also came to England and we ke \u2014 did keep in contact with them.",
        "Q: Okay. So you went home, was it \u2014 did you manage to get in to the apartment?",
        "A: Yes, our place was not \u2014 as far as I remember, was n-not locked \u2014 sealed.",
        "Q: And was your mother home?",
        "A: And \u2014 yes. I don\u2019t ever remember my mother talking with me about what was\ngoing on. I-I think she was probably in such a psychological turmoil that I don\u2019t\nknow whether she was even able to talk about it. She did play bridge, so she must\nhave had \u2014 it\u2019s very confusing.",
        "Q: So you did not understand what was going on, or did you learn from other \u2014\nOctober 16, 2010",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember that it was a religious thing that was going on. I just remember\nturmoil, you know, dreadful turmoil. But because we were not religious, and I never\nwent to temple, I don\u2019t know if \u2014 how I probably was able to relate that to religion, I\ndon\u2019t know. And I never actually had to wear the Star of David. I never wore it.",
        "Q: And \u2014 so by that time, were you already expelled from school, or was it after?",
        "A: The last report card I had, where it said that I had been terminated was the s \u2014 the\nspring of 1938, was like May \u201938.",
        "Q: And were you given reasons why you were being expelled? Why \u2014 why you\ncouldn\u2019t come back to school?",
        "A: I\u2019m sorry to be so vague, but I \u2014 I \u2014 you know, I \u2014 I \u2014 I must have asked\nquestions and I must have been given some answers.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: But I \u2014I don\u2019t remember. I remember being very sad that I couldn\u2019t go to school\nany more, but I don\u2019t \u2014",
        "Q: Why did you feel sad, cause \u2014",
        "A: Because I wanted to school.",
        "Q: Because you liked studying, or \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, well, going to school, I guess, with other children [indecipherable]\nOctober 16, 2010",
        "Q: Yeah, so what happened then? You couldn\u2019t go to school any more, what \u2014 what\ndid you do?",
        "A: Well, that was spring of \u201938, and I don\u2019t know. I know I \u2014 I was in the store, this\n\u2014 this tie shop down below, with these friends of ours. I know I was in the store a\nlot. So I think I probably \u2014 that\u2019s how I spent my days, with them, while my mother\nwas trying to sell her leather flowers.",
        "Q: And did she manage to sell \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, she \u2014 she became, I gather, I say she was a perfectionist, she became\nreally good at that. And she took that hobby, by then, to England with her and\ncontinued making leather flowers over there.",
        "Q: And do you remember your mother \u2014 when did the decision come up to \u2014 of you\nleaving? Do you \u2014 do you remember when it was?",
        "A: De-Decision to?",
        "Q: For you to leave Vienna.",
        "A: Oh. Well, that \u2014 that came \u2014 again, I was playing around the temple. I came out\nof the temple and saw a long line of adults and children. They were lined up and\nthey were slowly moving forward to a desk. And I joined the line, but I had no idea\nwhy I was joining. And when I got to the front of the line, I signed something. And\nOctober 16, 2010\nthree or four days later, my mother got a \u2014 a letter from this group, whatever they\nwere, as-asking \u2014",
        "Q: [indecipherable] So were \u2014 you were standing 1n a line and you signed\nsomething.",
        "A: Standing in the line \u2014 yeah, and my moth \u2014 my mother got this letter from this\ncommittee, refugee committee, I \u2014 I guess it was. A-And she went sort of crazy\nagain, cause she turned to me and said, what are the \u2014 what have you done? And I\nsaid, ah \u2014 I signed something.",
        "Q: So you just signed [indecipherable] you had no idea what you signed?",
        "A: And a \u2014 1t\u2014 no 1\u2014no idea. And it turns out, as I ask around, that I appear to be\nthe only person who signed themselves up for the transport. So my mother, having\njust lost my father, and \u2014 and having no means of income except her, you know,\nwhat she was doing, the flowers, apparently had to make up her mind within, I think\nit was 13 days, 12 days, whether to send me on a Kindertransport or not. And I\u2019m\nan only child, so she must have gone through hell making that decision. Cause she\nwas in a foreign country to her, you know, Austria was not her \u2014 her country. And\nso I now understand why she was a very nervous person, I \u2014 I un \u2014understand so\nmuch now of why she was who she was because of what she went through. And I\nOctober 16, 2010\nwish I would have, you know, I really wish I would have understood that better\nwhile she was alive. But anyway, she did make the decision to send me, and \u2014",
        "Q: Do you remember, did you talk to her, did you have conversations about it, or \u2014",
        "A: Again, I was trying to protect my mother, and I remember saying \u2014 I remember\npretending to be very excited about this. I\u2019m going to \u2014 I\u2019m gonna travel, I\u2019m going\nover to England and it\u2019ll be fine because then you will come and everything\u2019 II be\nfine. I was just trying to cover up. I think what I did was I took my fa \u2014 tried to take\nmy father\u2019s role. And \u2014 and anyway, so she had s \u2014 I think it was12 days to \u2014 to get\neverything ready for me, so she had to go out and buy clothes for me, and sew in\nnametags onto everything. And I, you know, I don\u2019t know whether she ever realized\nthat she might not see me again. I don\u2019t think I realized that. I don\u2019t think that\nentered my thoughts.",
        "Q: Of course you don\u2019t think that.",
        "A: No. So that\u2019s how I did, I signed myself up for the Kindertransport. And\nactually, in the book that I wrote, I \u2014 I \u2014I wrote that I really unconsciously,\nsubconsciously saved both our lives, because by my going over there, I was able to\nalso get the Quaker family to finally get her out.",
        "Q: So the day came for you to leave, do you remember that?\nOctober 16, 2010",
        "A: Yes, I remember that. I remember the night, I remember going to the \u2014 to the\nstation, where I come \u2014",
        "Q: What were your thoughts?",
        "A: Hm?",
        "Q: What were your thoughts?",
        "A: Of protecting my mother. So I was the, you know, that eight year old child sort\nof laughing and smiling, and don\u2019t worry about it, I mean, it\u2019ll be fine. Everybody\nwas crying \u2014 or, a lot of people were crying around me. The \u2014 the families, the\nparents and the children, and here was this brave little kid, suppressing everything, I\nguess.",
        "Q: Did your mother cry?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t remember. And quite honestly, we never really talked\nabout it. You know, there was so much that wasn\u2019t talked about. One of the things\nwas my father\u2019s death. It\u2019s \u2014 my mother never, ever talked about my father\nafterwards, after he \u2014 he died, and nobody explained to me what happened to him.\nBut in my protective mode, I removed everything from the apartment that could\npossibly remind my mother of my father, and I hid it somewhere. And it was \u2014 I\ndon\u2019t know.",
        "Q: When did you leave Vienna? What \u2014 what day was it?\nOctober 16, 2010",
        "A: December 10\", \u201938.",
        "Q: December 10\". And the train was heading to \u2014 where did it go?",
        "A: Well, a lot of this was from research afterwards \u2014",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: \u2014 th-the route.",
        "Q: Did you know where you were going?",
        "A: All I we \u2014 her \u2014 knew is I was going to engla \u2014 England. And again, my\nmemory is, I didn\u2019t know anybody there on the train. And I was alone, and being an\nonly child \u2014 there were several people who had brothers, or siblings on the train, or\nfriends. But I was \u2014 I was alone and I remember the \u2014 th-the fear. Every time we\nstopped there was tremendous fear because these Nazis would come on board and \u2014\nand go through luggage, the little luggage that we had, and would throw things\naround and would take stuff, like dolls and bears and things, you know, from the\nchildren. I remember \u2014 I just remember my internal fears there. [indecipherable]\nAnd then really \u2014 and I remember crossing into Holland like you know, I read now\nthe stories, how everybody \u2014 for everybody going into Holland was just such a\nrelief, and ho-how nice the people were there, by contrast, so \u2014 so \u2014",
        "Q: Is that true? Is that how you felt?\nOctober 16, 2010",
        "A: Yes, oh yes. Yes, yes, yes. I have a wonderful feeling for Dutch people, although\nI know that there were a lot of Dutch who also were not that nice. But \u2014",
        "Q: And your arrival in England?",
        "A: My arrival in England was freezing cold, I remember that.",
        "Q: It was December. It was \u2014",
        "A: Well, it was apparently the coldest \u2014 the coldest winter in living memory in \u2014 in\n\u2014 in eng \u2014 in England. It was snowing and we went to this place that had some\ncabins, Dovercourt. But it was snowing and the snow was coming inside the\nbuilding and it was freezing cold, but we were all very happy, and we were \u2014\neverybody was \u2014 was happy t-to be there.",
        "Q: And did you have parents \u2014 foster parents already, or \u2014 cause I know that some\npeople went to the [indecipherable]",
        "A: Well, th \u2014 it was a huge dining room, that had in one corner of it there was an\narea where we could play darts, we could play games, table tennis and darts.\nAnother corner was where people gathered to learn English. Then there was\nsomewhere where we could write letters to our parents, or postcards. And then there\nwas this big dining area. And in the dining area, every few days, I don\u2019t know, or\nevery once a week or whenever it was, people would come and stare at us, and\nsome children would be taken out, would be picked out. And I have a memory there\nOctober 16, 2010\nof thinking, why is nobody picking me out? Cause I was still sitting there and then\nchildren were sort of being taken away. Why is nobody picking me out? And when\nI did my research \u2014 I thought it was \u2014 I thought I\u2019d been there for ages. When I did\nmy research I was actually there for nine days, I think it was.",
        "Q: Where was it?",
        "A: Dovercourt, Harwich, in England. It was a \u2014 a family holiday camp that had\nbeen converted to receive the children and be the reception area. And then finally\nsome \u2014",
        "Q: Did you write to your mother from there?",
        "A: I did, and I have \u2014 I have my letters. And th-that\u2019s amazing, how my mother\nsaved those. I wish I had the lett \u2014 I do have a few letters from my mother too, not\ntoo many, but their mostly \u2014 I have a pack like this of my letters to her. And that is\nso interesting, because it shows the progression of the language. How, you know,\nall German at first, and then less and less German and then no German, and \u2014 and I\nwas, I guess, having a good time in England, and I wrote very little about it. I was\nthinking \u2014 you know, as I was reading them I was thinking, oh my goodness, my\nmother probably wanted all this information, and I just wrote three or four lines,\nyou know, and so \u2014",
        "Q: So you spent nine days at the child shelter?\nOctober 16, 2010",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And then what happened?",
        "A: And then I was taken by a Quaker family up to York, in \u2014",
        "Q: So it was one of those families who came to pick children [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yeah, somebody came on their behalf from the Quaker meeting in York. They\npicked me up, they \u2014 and I went by train up to \u2014 to York, and it was just before\nChristmas. And I got there and it was a \u2014 a \u2014 I-I was so lucky, a wonderful family\nwith \u2014 it was a couple, Quaker couple \u2014",
        "Q: And what are their names?",
        "A: Jessie(ph) and Walter Robson. And they had no children, and so they sort of\ntreated me as their own child. And next door to them was \u2014 Jessie\u2019s(ph) mother\nlived next door, Jessie\u2019s(ph) mother and father lived next door on one side, and then\nthe other side was Jessie\u2019s(ph) sister. So it was like a family compound almost, and\n[inaudible] And they, you know, there were two, four \u2014 four or five cousins there.\nThere were \u2014 four of them I\u2019m still in touch with.",
        "Q: Did they speak any German? How did you communicate?",
        "A: So my mother arrived \u2014 every day I would \u2014 I would badger my foster parents to\nget my mother \u2014 to bring my mother over. And I would badger and I would badger\nand I would badger. And eventually the Quaker meeting in that area, in York,\nOctober 16, 2010\nmanaged to get her a domestic servant permit, and so she got out three weeks before\nthe war started. And th \u2014 which was nine months after I had arrived. And when she\ncame, I couldn\u2019t \u2014 I couldn\u2019t speak any German, she couldn\u2019t speak any English and\nwe couldn\u2019t communicate. So she \u2014",
        "Q: That was fast.",
        "A: Huh?",
        "Q: That was fast, nine months?",
        "A: Yeah, well I\u2014 you know, I didn\u2019t hear any German around me, it was all\nEnglish. And so she got a dictionary, and she followed me around with this dicti \u2014\nwhen she finally left her job down s \u2014 south of England, she came up north, she\nfollowed me around with this dictionary. She used it so much that it became all\nloose-leaved. And after she died, which was just 14 years ago, my \u2014 we were going\nthrough her things and my son, who is the sentimental child o-of the three of them,\nsaid he \u2014 oh, he want \u2014 that\u2019s \u2014 he wants that dictionary, and it meant a lot to him,\nso he had it rebound, and he has it, so that was very \u2014",
        "Q: So, how did you learn engl \u2014 did you go to school there? Did you start going to\nschool there immediately, in England?",
        "A: Did I go to school?",
        "Q: Yes.\nOctober 16, 2010",
        "A: Yes, I went to a\u2014 was sort of an unusual place, 1t was \u2014 I don\u2019t know whether\nyou've heard of Rowntree\u2019s Chocolates, have you? Okay. It\u2019s now been taken over\nby Cadbury\u2019s, but there was a chocolate cocoa \u2014 cocoa chocolate factory in York,\nand it was started by Joseph Rowntree, and he was a very well-known Quaker,\nwho started the first village \u2014 wh-what do you call it, new \u2014 a new village. He had a\n\u2014 he had such a social conscience that he was able to build a \u2014 a village which\nactually became a small city, one of the first \u2014 what do you call \u2014 designed cities\nthat kept wi \u2014 which \u2014 I\u2019m getting fuzzy here.",
        "Q: So that\u2019s where you went to school?",
        "A: Yeah, I went to that \u2014 to the \u2014 it was a local community school, where I really\nbecame the \u2014 for the first time conscious of anti-Semitism, which is interesting,\nbecause there were a lot of English people who really resented, I guess, us coming\nover, because they regarded us as German, and forgetting that we were Jewish. And\nyou know, I had names thrown at me, and again I hi \u2014 you know, I fi \u2014",
        "Q: What kind of names?",
        "A: Like German Jew. German \u2014 just things like that, which was sort of hurtful. And\nthen I had a \u2014 learning English, I had a teacher who \u2014 she was very nice, she\nthought she was doing the right thing, but she would make me stand up and say\nbaker\u2019s man. Pat a cake, pat a cake, baker\u2019s man, bake me a cake as fast as you can,\nOctober 16, 2010\nright? And she would have me stand up and recite this, and I would always say, pat\na cake, pat a cake, becker\u2019s(ph) man, because that was the German pronunciation\nof it, and the class would just roar with laughter, right? So she would make me\nrepeat it. So I-I be \u2014 you probably realize by now the very stubborn nature, feisty\nnature. The more she made me repeat the thing, the more I would say becker\u2019s(ph)\nman, I just refused to say baker\u2019s man. And it was just, you know, funny memories\nlike that. And then I had somebody who called me a guy \u2014 a young boy, and at the\ntime, of course, what was I, nine, probably \u2014 who called me German Jewish\nrefugee. Those were probably the worst words anybody could call me, for some\nreason. It just made me \u2014 made me so mad. And so he \u2014 so J got into a fight with\nhim. And we came out onto the playground, and we fought, we wrestled, and all the\ngirls were supporting me, the boys were supporting him. And I ended up sort of\nwinning this thing. And years and years later I met this guy at the theater. I was\nsitting next to him, and we talked about it, and we were just laughing our heads off.\nFunny memory.",
        "Q: So did you make friends there?",
        "A: I did, yes. I made friends there, mm-hm. And then in \u201942, 1942 \u2014 so I went to\nthis school for three, four years \u2014 1942, by which time my mother again through\nworking very, very hard and never, never taking a bus, she walked wherever she\nOctober 16, 2010\ncould go, to save her money, I had the opportunity to go to a Quaker boarding\nschool. And again, it was with a scholarship from the Quakers and my mother paid\nso much too. So I had five wonderful years at a Quaker boarding school.",
        "Q: And so, while your mother still was in England, what was she writing to you?\nDo you remember getting letters from her, and what were the news from Vienna?",
        "A: I don\u2019t have her \u2014 well, my mother then moved, cause she was all alone in \u2014 in\nthis strange country, she moved back to Germany, to her mother\u2019s house, to\nAachen. And from then for th \u2014 she left from there, when she finally got her\ndomestic servant permit, she left from her mother\u2019s house, and she tried to get her\nmother out too, because we had a \u2014 my aunt \u2014 my \u2014 my great aunt, I guess it 1s, my\nmother\u2019s \u2014 my mother\u2019s aunt in Switzerland could have gotten my grandmother\nout, but she said she \u2014 my grandmother wouldn\u2019t move cause she said she was too\nold, that nobody would hurt her, her age, and she was 66 at the time.",
        "Q: What was her name?",
        "A: Amanda Meyer. And I have all this in the book, so later on [indecipherable].\nSo she left from \u2014 from a \u2014 my mother left from Aachen without her mother,\nleaving her mother there.",
        "Q: And when she arrived in England?\nOctober 16, 2010",
        "A: She arrived in England, she had to go to a \u2014 a farm in the south of England.\nAnd my mother, of course, had lived all her life in the big city, had never been near\nthe \u2014 near a farm, was terrified of animals, the cows. And these people had saved up\nall their dirty linen and everything. And \u2014 and she had to go into the \u2014 into the\nservants\u2019 quarters and do the cooking and the washing, you know, with the washing\n\u2014 with the washing board, this way\u2019? And she had to spend any free \u2014 they were out\n\u2014 way out in the country, and any free time that she had \u2014 she had \u2014 was out in the\nfields with the animals, and she was terrified. She had such a bad time there, that\nshe wanted to go back to Germany, actually. She wanted to go back to Germany.\nLuckily, she couldn\u2019t go back.",
        "Q: Did you meet her when she arrived in England?",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t, no, I was up north and she was down south. So I don\u2019t know how\nwe communicated. I guess we wrote letters. But th \u2014 it wasn\u2019t for very long, cause\nshe was really unhappy there, and the people really mistreated her.",
        "Q: So what happened then?",
        "A: And they were \u2014 I think they were very angry, cause my mother was probably\ndressed better than they were, and she was a servant, you know, and \u2014 and anyway,\nthe \u2014 my Quaker parents there, foster parents, were \u2014 realized what was happening,\nso they \u2014 the \u2014 the meeting that they were with, it\u2019s called a meeting, Quaker\nOctober 16, 2010\nmeeting, they managed to get her up to York, and be a \u2014 a house \u2014 housekeeper, I\nthink it was. Housekeeper, where she kept house for a widower who had a child, a\nboy. And she \u2014 they loved her there, she was doing such a good job. And I would\nvisit from my place to hers, occasionally. And I remember, another one of these\nblurbs that I remember, going in there and seeing this boy on my mother\u2019s knee, she\nwas caring for him. And I was so mad. What was he doing on her knee? I remember\nthat, so jealous.",
        "Q: What were your foster parents like?",
        "A: They were wer \u2014 they were very simple, wonderful people, who \u2014 he \u2014 he was a\nconscientious objector. And again, the family was sort of ostracized by the people\nin the village around them. First of all because they \u2014 he was a conscientious\nobjector during wartime, and then because they took me in, and they \u2014 they didn\u2019t\nlike \u2014 like that. So they \u2014 they were very strong people, who did what they believed.\nAnd they didn\u2019t try and convert me, or do anything, but I \u2014 they invited me to come\nwith them to the Quaker meetings, and I did do that occasionally. And the family \u2014\nshe treated me like one of the family, and it was \u2014 I was very fortunate.",
        "Q: And the wider family also accepted you?",
        "A: Not so much Walter\u2019s family, because Walter\u2019s brother was in the air force, I\nthink it was, not the army, he was in the air force, and he became a prisoner of war\nOctober 16, 2010\nof the Japanese, and was very mistreated. So they, you know, they were angry at\nWalter for being a conscientious objector, and of course everything that came with\nWalter, which was me. But Jessie\u2019s(ph) family, certainly, yes. All her family\naccepted me. I \u2014 I guess I just figured I was one of the family. And then when my\nmother came over, she lived with us for quite a while. And she took on a new inco \u2014\nwa-way of making income, she studied hairdressing with a French hairdresser in\ntown. And in her way, she beca \u2014 became better than he was, so people wanted her,\nnot him. So, I \u2014 actually, it was fine with him, he \u2014 he didn\u2019t mind, as long as she\nwas getting lots of customers. And then one day my mother thought that maybe she\ncould do this on her own and not be working for him. So I think she gave indication\nthat she may leave, and he didn\u2019t want her to leave. So he said he would do\nanything she should stay there. So she said, okay, I'll stay if you provide me with\ncigarettes. Cause at this time cigarettes were \u2014 were rationed. And he actually went\nout and kept her supplied with \u2014 she hadn\u2019t smoked before she came to England,\nbut it\u2019s a habit she started, she started chain-smoking. And he kept her supplied with\ncigarettes. And eventually she had her own business, but \u2014",

        "A: I\u2014I don\u2019t th \u2014 I don\u2019t reme \u2014 remember any struggle between the two of them\nfor \u2014 for me. My mother was too busy, you know, working. And she did everything\nshe could to pay back what they were giving to \u2014 she would stay up all night to\nmake \u2014 she would do embroidery. Embroider pillow \u2014 cushion covers for birthdays\nand Christmas and that sort of thing for the family. And so \u2014 I mean, actually my\nfoster mother died in my mother\u2019s arms. So it was \u2014 they were \u2014 they became very\nclose, they became best friends almost. It was a \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s sort of a very nice\nStory.",

The people who bought my mother\u2019s house,\nbought the two houses on either side, 1t was sort of terraced housing, and broke\nthrough, and it\u2019s now a fairly big hotel. And I Googled it and I saw our bedroom,\nOctober 16, 2010\nwhich has been converted into a \u2014 I mean, it was just \u2014 it was an out of body\nexperience. I can see it, I can get it any time.

        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Maybe that\u2019s why I\u2019ve been so lucky, cause I was born on Mother\u2019s day and my\nbirthday was V-E Day. Yeah, I \u2014 I remember that, I remember all the celebrations,\nand \u2014",
        "Q: And what about your relatives in Berlin? It was your mother\u2019s mother?",
        "A: My mother\u2019s mother died in theres \u2014 no, not in Theresienstadt. She was in\nTheresienstadt. I\u2019m \u2014 I again have a package of letters from my grandmother, on \u2014",

        "Q: She couldn\u2019t read the letters?\nOctober 16, 2010",

        "Q: So you didn\u2019t even know what was going on? At the time when she was writing,\nyour mother was not reading them?",
        "A: Well, the last letter was when she had gone to an old age home. They had\ngathered all the old people \u2014 old? She was 66. They had gathered all the elderly\npeople, and the last letters from there, that she was there, and she was happy, and\neverything was fine, I mean, there\u2019s a lot of cover up. And how were we, and she\nhoped we\u2019d be fine. And they were going on a journey, they were going to be taken\nsomewhere else, which was to Theresienstadt. And then from Theresienstadt,\nagain from my research, I understand she was sent to Minsk, and died there at\nMinsk. And I have a couple of different reports. One is that she was in a \u2014 one of\nthe cattle cars, and they were shunted aside, I guess left there, and the people just\ndied of starvation and \u2014 and cold. The other was that she went to the ghetto in\nOctober 16, 2010\nMinsk, and that again there was starvation [inaudible]. And I ne \u2014 I never told my\n\u2014I never told my mother. I had done some research before she died, but she was\nunder the impression she d \u2014 her mother died in Theresienstadt, which was not\nquite as bad as some of the other places. And I never told her anything about\nMinsk. And it turns out that my husband\u2019s grandmother was also in Theresienstadt\nat the same time as my grandmother. So we keep saying, I wonder if they ever met\neach other?",
        "Q: Yeah. So, I just want to clear something. So your mother was re \u2014 she was not\nreading the letters as they were being sent, or you\u2019re saying she did not want to read\nthem after the war? Did you know what was going on with your grandmother when\nthe wa-war was still going on? Do you remember your mother talking about it?",
        "A: I certainly did not know what was going on.\n[break]",

And\nI don\u2019t think \u2014 I don\u2019t think she read her letters, I don\u2019t know. She always told me\nthat she had these bundle of letters, that she can\u2019t get herself to read them. Now,\nwhether it was re-read, that\u2019s possible too, I don\u2019t know. But my mother \u2014 you\nknow, I told you that she didn\u2019t deal with my father\u2019s death, she wasn\u2019t able to talk\nOctober 16, 2010\nabout that, she was never able to talk about her \u2014 her mother, and it was just a\u2014a\nseries of suppressions that she had.",

They were lined up and\nthey were slowly moving forward to a desk. And I joined the line, but I had no idea\nwhy I was joining. And when I got to the front of the line, I signed something. And\nOctober 16, 2010\nthree or four days later, my mother got a \u2014 a letter from this group, whatever they\nwere, as-asking \u2014",

And I\u2019m\nan only child, so she must have gone through hell making that decision. Cause she\nwas in a foreign country to her, you know, Austria was not her \u2014 her country.

And \u2014 and anyway, so she had s \u2014 I think it was12 days to \u2014 to get\neverything ready for me, so she had to go out and buy clothes for me, and sew in\nnametags onto everything.

It\u2019s \u2014 my mother never, ever talked about my father\nafterwards, after he \u2014 he died, and nobody explained to me what happened to him.\nBut in my protective mode, I removed everything from the apartment that could\npossibly remind my mother of my father, and I hid it somewhere.

So she would make me\nrepeat it. So I-I be \u2014 you probably realize by now the very stubborn nature, feisty\nnature. The more she made me repeat the thing, the more I would say becker\u2019s(ph)\nman, I just refused to say baker\u2019s man. And it was just, you know, funny memories\nlike that. And then I had somebody who called me a guy \u2014 a young boy, and at the\ntime, of course, what was I, nine, probably \u2014 who called me German Jewish\nrefugee. Those were probably the worst words anybody could call me, for some\nreason. It just made me \u2014 made me so mad. And so he \u2014 so J got into a fight with\nhim. And we came out onto the playground, and we fought, we wrestled, and all the\ngirls were supporting me, the boys were supporting him. And I ended up sort of\nwinning this thing.

        "A: To my mother. On paper that is like tissue paper almost, you know, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s\nairmail, and it\u2019s in the old German handwriting. I can read it. My mother never read\nit, ne-never read any of her letters, she wasn\u2019t able to. [indecipherable]",
        "A: She couldn\u2019t get herself to read anything from my grandmother. She had all this\nguilt about leaving her there, and \u2014",

        "A: No, no, I read them after \u2014 my mother, you know, after she died, I \u2014 I got all this\nstuff.",
        "A: Well, the last letter was when she had gone to an old age home. They had\ngathered all the old people \u2014 old? She was 66. They had gathered all the elderly\npeople, and the last letters from there, that she was there, and she was happy, and\neverything was fine, I mean, there\u2019s a lot of cover up. And how were we, and she\nhoped we\u2019d be fine. And they were going on a journey, they were going to be taken\nsomewhere else, which was to Theresienstadt. And then from Theresienstadt,\nagain from my research, I understand she was sent to Minsk, and died there at\nMinsk. And I have a couple of different reports. One is that she was in a \u2014 one of\nthe cattle cars, and they were shunted aside, I guess left there, and the people just\ndied of starvation and \u2014 and cold. The other was that she went to the ghetto in\nOctober 16, 2010\nMinsk, and that again there was starvation [inaudible]. And I ne \u2014 I never told my\n\u2014I never told my mother. I had done some research before she died, but she was\nunder the impression she d \u2014 her mother died in Theresienstadt, which was not\nquite as bad as some of the other places. And I never told her anything about\nMinsk. And it turns out that my husband\u2019s grandmother was also in Theresienstadt\nat the same time as my grandmother. So we keep saying, I wonder if they ever met\neach other?",
        "A: I certainly did not know what was going on.\n[break]",
        "A: \u2014no memory of ever knowing what \u2014 what was happening to my grandmother,\nuntil after the war, I had no idea. And I \u2014I don\u2019t think my mother knew, either. And\nI don\u2019t think \u2014 I don\u2019t think she read her letters, I don\u2019t know. She always told me\nthat she had these bundle of letters, that she can\u2019t get herself to read them. Now,\nwhether it was re-read, that\u2019s possible too, I don\u2019t know. But my mother \u2014 you\nknow, I told you that she didn\u2019t deal with my father\u2019s death, she wasn\u2019t able to talk\nOctober 16, 2010\nabout that, she was never able to talk about her \u2014 her mother, and it was just a\u2014a\nseries of suppressions that she had.",
        "A: Oh, all my grandmother\u2019s \u2014 there were \u2014 there were \u2014 how many of them were\nthere? Seven. Seven siblings. One came to America, to San Francis \u2014 to Los\nAngeles. And her f\u2014 that family lived there and I\u2019m in touch with the cousin.",
        "A: That was Feidelberg(ph), the Feidelbergs(ph). He survived. Four of the sisters\ndied in the concentration camps. Two of the children of those sisters died. One was\na really, really young, just four or five years old, died.",

        "A: It\u2019s in my book. Sometimes I have to go to my book to remember names. One of\nthe Nazis had a child that was very sick, so they came to him to help the child. And\nthe child was so sick that the uncle did not want to work on him, because he knew\nthat if the child died, he would be blamed for it. So he said he didn\u2019t want to take it\non, the child was sick. So, by doing that, they \u2014 of course they sent him to\nconcentration camp. That was \u2014",
