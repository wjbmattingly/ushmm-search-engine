        "Q: How long did you live in_6d_?",
        "A: I lived in 6d_ until 1939. On September 1, 1939, World War II started. Sadly, Poland lost\nthe war and after a few days, the Germans occupied our city. Germans came in and\nsurrounded us...to the city of 6d.",

My father instilled in his Jewish spirits\nand will power.",
        "Q: What did you do until '39?",
        "A: I started, sadly, very young; because the economic situation in our home was such that my\nfather himself was not able to provide for us the needs and support. He did everything\npossible to sustain us; but until '39, I worked hard helping to support my family.",
        "Q: When the Germans came to 6d_, what happened to your family?",
        "A: When the Germans came in on September Ist, 1939, they annexed the City of 6d_ in the\nThird Reich. Life in 6d_ turned into a hell for our people. They grabbed us on the streets,\ntormented and humiliated us. We were driven to degrading work. Beatings, robbery and\ninsults became a daily occurrence. Since my oldest...I was the oldest son, I asked my\nyounger brother to escape to Russia, but many Jews escaped at that time to Russia. And\nthanks to my advice, my brother survived. As I said before, he lives with me in Uruguay.\nThe rest of my family all perished. My sisters perished. Everybody perished. Out of 6\nbrothers and sisters, just I and my brother survived.",
        "Q: What did you do after your brother left 6d_?",
        "A: But if...in the beginning of October '39, I took my younger sister and went with her--the\nother ones were married already--and I went with her to a small town called Pruszkow, a\nsmall town 18 kilometers to Warsaw. I had there some people I knew. This was the Polish\nprotectorate and the regiment there was not so severe as in_6d_.I planned to bring all my\nfamily there, but my goal was to transfer all of them there. But the situation in_6d_\ndeteriorated so..I...1t was difficult and dangerous to bring them there.",
        "Q: What kind of work did you do in Pruszkow?",
        "A: In Pruszkow, in the beginning, the system was still bearable. And we lived in a ghetto, but\nthe area was not closed. We could go around and move around freely. Three times a week\nwe were have to taken to the railroad labor camp, and we worked there without pay and we\nwere harassed and beaten. After awhile they liquidated the ghetto, and transferred all men to\nthe railroad camp. The women and children were sent to the Warsaw ghetto. The men\ncontinued working there at the railroad. We slept there and worked there. Yah. But the\nremainder, like I said, they sent to the ghetto of Warsaw.",
        "Q: What happened to your sister?",
        "A: Yah. My sister also went to Warsaw. After the liquidation of the railroad brigades in\nPruszkow, they marched us to Warsaw, and I was reunited with my sister.",
        "Q: Please, tell us about the conditions in Warsaw upon your arrival there?",
        "A: The situation was very, very sad. Hunger...children... people were laying in the\nstreet...swollen with hunger.... bodies covered with sores. It was very bad. I looked aside\nimmediately to find a way to leave the ghetto. I obtained some travel document and left\nWarsaw. I got a permit to a town called Ostrow Lubelski, in the Lublin area. Lubelski. It was\na place away from the main road, 7 kilometers from the nearest railroad station. Life was\nthere so much easier that we lived by selling our belongings, our clothes. We were not\nhungry. We exchanged things for food. We did not suffer. We did not suffer any hunger\nthere. But unfortunately, in October '42, yah, the German decided to liquidate all remaining\nJewish communities in the area. And marched us off on foot to a small town called\nLubart\u00e9w. In Lubartow, they assembled all Jewish from Parczew and other towns. They\npacked us on the cattle wagons...in cattle wagons, they took us 1n a transport of 12,000\nJews...were taken to Treblinka.",
        "Q: How long did it take the train ride to Treblinka?",
        "A: (Long pause) It took lot more longer than normal, because this was not a regular scheduled\ntransport. It frequently stopped to wait for the regular trains to pass. The road to Treblinka\nwas already . They hurried us in the cattle wagons, flogging us with whips, squeezing 150\npeople into a wagon. We had to do things, you know, natural things in the place where we\nwere...in the wagons. The Ukrainians who were watching us took money to get us water, but\nwas no water...yah...or valuables...and never gave us the water. Many times they took away\nour valuables or whatever we had, but they never gave us the water.",
        "Q: Were they only Ukrainians who guarded you or were there others?",
        "A: I believe that the only Ukrainians were the guards who helped the liquidation of the Jewish\ncommunities in the area where we lived. Yah.",
        "Q: Please, describe to us your arrival in Treblinka.",
        "A: (Long pause) Before I will answer this question, let me tell something that bothers me 'til this\nday all my life. I can't forgive myself for something I did. On the train to Treblinka, my sister\nbegged me to give her some food. Because we had very little food with us. They cheated us.\nWe were told as they are taking us for work in Russia and it will take many days until we\nwill reach our destination. I did not give my sister, Anna, which she accepted my reasoning\nand was willing to suffer and hold off her thirst and craving for food. \"Alright, I will do\nwithout the food as long as we will come to a place and survive.\" She was so weak upon\narrival that they dispatched her to the gas chambers as soon as we arrived. (Long pause) The\ntrain arrived at a station called Treblinka. The transport came to a halt and was taken to the\nforest 4 o'clock in the morning. We were staying there a little less than two hours. Then we\nsaw that...what...what our destiny is. The door opens. Yah. We looked at each other, and we\nrealized that it didn't take long. We came through the forest and we arrived at the real camp,\nTreblinka. The doors opened, and we were ordered to get out with screams, \"Schnell!\nAusschteigen!\"--\"Hurry! Out! Men to the right! Women and small children to the left!\" The\nmen on the right ordered to this rope to bind our shoes 1n pairs. They later send the shoes to\nGermany. In a hurry, we had to undress. They selected the young among us and ordered us\nto collect in a hurry. All the clothing and belongings of the people from the spot where they\nundressed, and take them to a large place where they pointed out. Yah. It was a receptacle\nfor mountains of shoes, clothes, bags, and suitcases. It was terrible. We were...we were\nworking in a chain, running from the undressing spot to the receptacle...all day long. After\nwe finished with the men's belongings, we were hurried to the barrack where the women\nundressed upon arrival. Then the marched us to the left where the women and the children\nwere. We undressed in the field, but the women and the children were inside the barrack.\nWhen we came to take their clothes, nobody was there any more. Just a heap of clothing that\nwe carried to the same place we delivered the men's belongings. Yah. We have to leave it\nthere. And all it was done in a hurry. We did it running...back and forth, back and forth, we\nwere running. While running back and forth, we heard the German calling, \"Who 1s a\nbarber?\" I thought what did I have to lose and I said, \"I am a barber.\" They had already four\nmen chosen. I was the fifth man. A friend of mine that followed me was rejected. I...I called\non him to come close but it was too late. The Germans did not want any more barbers. He\ntook the five of us to the clothes magazines barrack and ordered them to give us a pair of\npants, a pair of shoes, and a shirt. The Germans ordered all to perform all works. He said that\nwe will be...will be sorting clothes, and then 1n addition will be..are...he is giving us an\nassignment as a barber. I did not know what mine...what mine assignment 1s. I knew how to\nwork there from another man who worked there. He said, \"Get yourselves a pair of scissors.\"\nWe were also warned by one of the men who belonged to the barber work, that we must\nwork in bent down positions. If not, we will be constantly beaten. The Germans walked\naround us with whips, constantly beating us. As soon as I start to work, I got a beating and\nwas bleeding from my head and face. I find some water, washed away the blood and\nreturned to work. This is the place where I worked. The first work was sorting the heaps of\nclothes, separating the shirts, pants, coats, and eyeglasses. Not just sorting, but also checking\nto see if jacket collars, cuffs of the pants, or the shoulder pads were hiding anything of value.\nIf you found money or a ring, we put it in a designated place. People hoped that they can\nsave it. And we had to control that. And I worked at the sorting barrack. We\nlooked...diamonds separate, rings separate. There I worked for about 2 days.",
        "Q: Did you have any idea what happened to your sister?",
        "A: (Long pause) On the second day, while separating clothes, I recognized my sister's dress.\nThe same day the new transport arrived and a German came up to called us. The new five\nbarbers join the five old ones. The five barbers of the old ones and the five new ones. Yah. I\nhad my scissors, and they marched us to the gas chambers area. The gas chambers was in an\nopen place with two entries. The gas chambers consist of 2 chambers. On the open door they\nrushed the victims with yellish, yelling and screaming. They had to go through that open gas\nchamber. They forced them to sit down, and we cut their hair with five cuts. We removed the\nwomen's hair. This was a...one of the most terrible times for me in Treblinka. My last contact\nwith living victims. I had such moments...a woman came in and grabbed my arm...my arm\nand asking me if the young will stay alive. I couldn't tell her otherwise. I said...Yes, I...I\nwill...the young will survive. The women then said to me, \"Now I can die assured that my\nson who...who came with me will live and take revenge for our misfortunes.\" We collected\nthe hair in valises and suitcases. The hair by the...the Germans are using the victims hair for\nthe military industry. This is material to strengthen the military and the German industry. I\nhad some ghastly periods at the barber place. A mother came to me begging not to cut her\nhair in such a hurry. She should like to die together with her daughter who 1s blind...with a\nfew people behind her. I wanted to help her. I slowed down cutting of her hair. Then a whip\ncame down on my face and head. I asked my friend to help the daughter to come closer, but\nhe couldn't do it. Yah. He couldn't do it. Another I had, the girl came to the gas chambers\narea, shouted, loudly shouting hysterically, laughing and screaming, said, \"Don't cry. Let's\nshow the murderers that we are not afraid to die. Don't give him the satisfaction to see you\nsad.\" She didn't want to give him the pleasure that they should see us cry, dying.",
        "Q: How long did you work with the barbers?",
        "A: This...this disdainful work, I worked for 3 days...2 or 3 days. After this, after I worked the 2\nor the 3 days, then nobody...it was a fact sorting the clothes in the barracks. From there, they\nselected 30 men--myself among them--and marched us to Camp 2.",
        "Q: What kind of work did you do?",
        "A: Treblinka was divided in two camps. Lager No. | was a place for sorting clothes and\nbelongings of the victims and cutting their hair, and so on. In Camp 2, the other camp, we\nwere in contact only with the dead. This was the devil's factory. In the first 2 days in\nTreblinka, we still hoped that maybe we will be able to escape and we saved some food,\nscraped up some underwear and a coat for this eventuality. But in Camp 2, we realized that\nthey will search us. I got rid of the coat and all other things, because if they would find other\nthings on me, they would have killed me and the other 30 men. I saw that they will search\nus...and if they would find something, they would have killed me.",
        "Q: Who is the \"they\" you constantly talk about?",
        "A: The SS men and the Ukrainian guards.",
        "Q: How did they behave toward the victims?",
        "A: They were police units. (Long pause) Among them, there are bad people. So...so much\nworser than the Germans. Let me give you an example. In 1945, '44, while hiding in a\nbunker in the destroyed Warsaw, I described my sufferings in Treblinka in a notebook. I\ndidn't know then if I will survive and the world will not know what happened to us. In my\nnotebook, I wrote about Treblinka. When I wrote then, I referred to the men there...we were\ntreated by the Ukraine guards. There were a few Ukrainians...three of them...one's name was\n\"Ivan the Terrible.\" I was a witness at a court proceeding of Ivan [NB: John] Demjanjuk.\nOnce in the United States, and now in Israel. I knew him as \"the devil Ivan. I didn't know\nthen that his name was Ivan Demjanjuk. Yah. We called him \"Ivan the devil.\" He was\nworking as a mechanic blacksmith who leaked in the gas into the gas chamber. Yah. He was\ngassing the people. He was a sadist, taking pleasure in his work. He liked what he did. I\nremember one day, he brought our food rations from Camp | to Camp 2. In this moment, he\nstopped his horse driven car, picked up an iron...picked up an iron bar and started hitting the\npeople with this 1ron pole. The screams of the people were unbearable. He kept that long\npiece of iron and continued, the people who were waited there, keep beating them...beating\nthem...hitting them with that piece of iron. And he had the joy doing that. I...1 can share with\nyou another example of his cruelties. I worked for awhile with a dentist group, yah,\nremoving the false teeth from the victims...after they brought them out from the gas\nchambers. The dentists were close to Ivan's workshop. It was very close nearby... where he\nkept his motors running, so that I saw... saw him very often. One day, by cleaning...washing\nthe bloody teeth with a friend of mine. His name was Finkelstein. He was from the town of\nP_ock. Yah, I don't remember exactly. I think he was from P_ock. It took him...took a\ndrill...that was used to drill holes in wood and stick the drill into Finkelstein's backside. In\nthe backside...in laughing, continually laughing. He screamed, \"Gevalt!\" Finkelstein then\nwas crying. Even told him that if he will not stop screaming, he will...he said...he had so\nmuch joy doing that. He used to take one, grabbing people and cutting off an ear. When the\nvictims was bleeding all over, he ordered them to undress. He shouted. The sadism of that\nIvan was so enormous that you find it difficult to speak about.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: It is impossible to repeat it. The other evil guard was Mikolai, his helper. The third man was\ncalled [Tsicktsark (ph)]. All the time they walked around beating the people. Murdering the\nvictims was their enjoyment, their pleasure. The foreman of the dentists group was a Dr.\nZimmermann, and the guard tolerated him and he had influence on the Ukraine | Tsicktsack\n(ph)| He had some influence on him, and he intentionally involved the guard in all matters of\nconversation in order to keep him away from beating us. We explored Dr. Zimmermann,\nplease, keep him busy with conservation so he will not have the time to so brutally badger\nus. In Treblinka, we were not allowed to walk, but always run. We continually had to be\nguard that our faces are free of injuries and show no marks or scars of the facing. Whoever\nhad a bloody face or scars was taken out in the evening, line up and shot. They looked if we\ncan still pick up our legs. If not, they took it out and killed us.",
        "Q: Who did the shooting?",
        "A: I think...we think there were about 100 SS men and 40 Ukrainians. You keep referring to SS\nGerman Ukrainians.",
        "A: (Long pause) They were able every day (pause)...they killed every day about 15,000\npeople...all Jews. One time I remember a gypsy transport of 500 people. Transports kept\ncoming from all over...from all over Europe. And the people were so abused, victimized,\nwent through such a hell and severe beating that they wanted to die. The nurse stood\nthere...only beating...constantly beating...constantly beating and killing.",
        "Q: If the people were so resigned, rather willing to die than to suffer, whose idea was it to rebel\nand organize the uprising in Treblinka?",
        "A: (Long pause) Let me tell you certain things before I answer this question. I saw personally a\nmother holding an infant in line for the gas chamber. Yah. She had a small child with her.\nThe German tore the child from the mother's arms, hit the child, and holding the infant by its\nlegs, he shushed the head against the wall. This was one of the daily scenes we saw in\nTreblinka. Then you ask me, \"How come about rebellion?,\" I can say to you the same thing I\nsaid to the judge when I was in Cleveland. I said, \"Your Honor, I was blind.\" The Judge\nunderstood what I said. But Ivan's attorney kept pressing the question, \"How can you claim\nyou were blind when you can see?\" The judge interrupted him, interrupted the attorney,\n\"Why do you keep asking this man such questions? Any human being facing such atrocities\nbecomes blind.\" We saw everything and perceived nothing. We become inhuman,\nincoherent. Our vision was overcast. We did not know what was happening to us. We\nhoped...we always kept asking, maybe someone will survive. Maybe a miracle will happen, a\nplane will come and bomb Treblinka and free us from the misery. We worked. We worked\nthere for many months. The whole world forgot about us. Our lives were worthless. The\nwhole world forgot about us. For this reason of hopelessness and broken spirits... (Long\npause) Let me...let me tell you. Yah. Treblinka, if we would have not have made this...the\nuprising, (Long pause) they warned that there would not be a sign that there ever was a death\ncamp in Treblinka. They had graves, mass graves, that were about 200,000 people in them.\nThey brought special machinery to dig deep...deep, deep holes. All those people, all those\nbodies, we..we put them there--one head to the feet--in order that there should be more place\nfor the people. One on top of the other, tens of thousands of people. When they\ndiscovered...you know, they discovered of the victims of Katyn and massacre, the mass\nmurder of Polish officers. Also the Germans defeat at Stalingrad, [on] their retreat, they\nstarted to worry, \"Would the world discover the murderous deeds in Treblinka?\" The deep\npits, mass graves, will be proof of their atrocities. They started to remove the bodies of the\nvictims and burn them. The same big machines which excavated the ground before started to\nremove the corpses, the remains...bloody parts of the people. They built a crematorium, but it\nwas too small for their purpose. This crematorium was not enough. It wasn't satisfactory for\ntheir needs. There was not enough results by just burning them. Then the arrived a specialists\nin the field, a man who [was] called [Wait (ph)|. He was a specialists in his trade. He did the\nfollowing. He did a simple thing. He took 5 or 6 railroad tracks each 30 meters long. Around\nit, he built a brick wall. He laid the tracks 15 centimeters apart...centimeters apart...and one\nand a half meters above the ground, up to one and a half metals. On those tracks, he covered\nthem with the corpses of the victims. The first layer were a woman, yah, their stomachs on\nthe tracks. Yah. We loaded 2,000 (pause)...we covered them with 2,500 corpses, counting...\nHow did we counted those people? We counted only the heads. Each head was...had one\nnumber. And we set them...when they were 1n a certain order, they set them on fire. Yah. In\nthe beginning, they burned the victims in daytime. But the flames were so immense that it\nwas impossible to stay close to the place. All day long we kept putting bodies one top of the\nother. So they changed the system. We worked all day from 6 in the morning to 6 in the\nevening. Only an hour before, we stopped working at 5 PM, when the mountains of corpse\nwere in place, yah, we worked with rough hand tools wracking the bodies in their place. We\ntook the branches and dried up bushes, and we put them under the tracks and set them on\nfire. This was dry bushes we set. And this was a half a meter high. And we set it on fire. And\nthe flames were so strong that we were unable to stay any closer than 50 feet from the blaze.\nAfter a few hours, even the 50 meters close, we wouldn't be able to stay there. And this was\nburning night after night. The fires were burning all night. And in the morning, we were\nextinguish it, there'll still smoldering skeletons. A specially organized ashes brigade, the\ncolony...was called ash brigades to remove the bones. We removed the ashes with wooden\nsticks, beat and remained it into thin ashes. After this was done, yah, we had to sift the ashes\nin special screen boxes. Yah. We beat it with those pieces of wood. We had to beat the ashes.\nIf we found pieces of bones, we had to beat them again until it became thin like cigarette\nashes. Whatever it was it left. After that again we have to beat. Like...like flour, 1t was this\nthin.",
        "Q: How long was this going on?",
        "A: This...this process continued all the time I was in Treblinka. They wanted to cover up the\ndeeds, so that..so that no trace was...would be left. The ashes were later buried in the ground\nfrom where they excavated the bodies. One layer of ashes and one layer of dirt. Yah. When\nthe graves...their crematives close to the surface, they did not use any more ashes, only soil,\nso that no trace can be found. There was also a group they called Knochen colony. Their task\nwas to find any remains of human bones, little bones...burn them again so no signs\nwhatsoever can ever be found. Absolutely, absolutely nothing be left.",
        "Q: When did this?",
        "A: This was going on until the uprising on August 2, 1943. If this would take a little bit longer,\nin a few more months, the world wouldn't have never know that there was a camp,\nTreblinka, which covered up their deeds so much that two kilometers from the original camp\nthey established a Obus Kari (ph), a penal camp, for smugglers and criminals. Yah. That\ncamp...they also called Treblinka. They wanted this camp as a coverup for the future. If\nsomeone will discover the real Treblinka with their gas chambers, they will have a place to\nshow that this was a place for criminals. Very few of us survived. After the war, when I\nreturned to Treblinka and I found Poles digging...digging the land, looking for valuables.",
        "Q: I want to ask you again, who were the people who organized the uprising?",
        "A: The uprising was planned by Camp 1. The clothes sorting camp with 700 inmates. They\norganized the uprising. As..as...yah...they wanted to punish someone in camp 1, they used to\nsend them to us. They sent to us some people...among them were 2 officers of the\nCzechoslavakia army, one adult and one Jelo (ph). And they brought the information\nabout...of the conspiracy and about the preparations for the uprising. And they stayed in\ncontact with the first camp. The schlau (ph) who was there leading to the gas chambers...was\nleading to the gas chambers was regularly cleaned of blood marks. They had to clean it every\nday, and the inmates assigned to the cleaning shared information with our group in camp 2.\nWe took...we spoke loud to each other about other things, but we shared information.\nOriginally, the uprising was planned for May 1943. They prepared gold to bribe the guards,\nto pay for food. We had duplicate keys to the arsenal, but the same day a train load of\nsoldiers arrived, and the plan was postponed. The rifles and ammunition taken from the\narsenal were returned so that the Germans did not notice there're missing. The Germans did\nnot notice it. Now when we saw that the time passed and nothing had happened, we\ninformed camp 1, if they will not do something, we will not wait any longer and start a\nbreakout ourselves. We had our own conspiracy in camp 2. A small group of disciplined\npeople...we were afraid of too many people will know about our plans, we will be\ndiscovered. So we decided that the uprising will start at August 2 at 5 PM....Yah...in 1943, 5\nO'clock. Everyone in our group is given an assignment. My role was to get the people out of\nthe camp, urging them to leave. We shouted.",
        "Q: What was your assignment?",
        "A: Like I said, I had to urge the people to leave. We shouted that there is a revolution in Berlin.\nBecause of some mixup, we had to start a half an hour earlier. Yah, because they started\nearlier. The signal was if we hear two shots, then we will start. And it started a half an hour\nearlier. Everybody was in their place. But it was not successful. It was not fully successful.\nWe wanted to destroy the gas chambers. But we set on fire the garages, the warehouse\nchambers. Our plan was to get out of there and free the...the penal camp, but we were not\nable to do it. It became so chaotic. Many people were not in their places. After a few\nmoments, the...the Germans starting shooting and killing. They kept shooting, and we were\nrunning wild. In the shouting and confusion, I was screaming, \"People, save yourself!\" Some\nof them, uh, chose not to run, and then went back to the barracks. I was one of the last ones\nto leave. When I left a many was lay, already dead, killed. They opened fire with machine\nguns.",
        "Q: How many people were in the group?",
        "A: Yah, there were Ukrainians and SS men who were shooting and killing us. And we were\nrunning in groups. I was...I was...I chose a road--not a main road, a side road, to run. And\nwhen I arrived a few kilometers in the daylight, I saw that we are too many people. We are\n20 people. So I decided that we should divide into...in...in...1nto two groups. This was still\ndaylight. This is August, middle of the summer. So we decided to hide...yah... in a field\namong the bushes. We...we stayed there for awhile. We saw the Germans are coming\nclose...and also the Ukrainians coming close. We were hiding in the bushes. One of the\ngroup...one of our group 1s in few minutes they open fire on them, and they killed them all.\nYah. But they did not notice us. No, the German soldiers that killed the groups. so they\ndeparted. They withdrew and departed. Next to me was laying a friend of mine, a Czech by\nthe name of Masaryk. He was related to the former President of Czechoslavakia. He come to\nTreblinka because his mother was Jewish. Yah. When they saw...when he he saw the\nGermans came near the field, he cut his veins. He did not want to...want to...the Germans to\ntake him alive. Yah. I bandaged his arm. I grabbed his arm and stopped the bleeding. As\nsoon as the Germans retreated and it got...and it got dark, we started to roam...bypassing the\nopen. We don't know if he survived. After a few days with the group, I decided to part. I was\nwith a friend of mine. They said I have a good face because we look like Christians. And we\ndecided during the night to go to a farm, to a peasant and ask for food. Some decent people\nhelped us. Some not, saying, \"Get lost, Jews!\" I saw...I realized that this is no way out of our\nsituation, and I suggested to my fellow fugitives to walk in the direction of Warsaw--a\ndistance of somewhere 80, 90 kilometers. I knew some Christian friends in Warsaw who\nwere active in the Polish underground. No one wanted to follow my advice. So I said to\nthem, \"Friends, sooner or later, some peasant will sell you to the Germans for 5 pounds of\nsugar.\" It was a time for 5 kellogs of sugar, they sold a Jew. So I parted with my friends. I\nsaid goodbye to them. And through side roads, I started to walk in the direction of Warsaw.\nIt's a long, long road. Then I arrived in Warsaw. The first night I was sleeping in a field. It\nwas raining all night. I rambled toward a farm house and started talking to the peasants. At\nthat moment, we heard shots and shouting. The peasant crossed himself and started to shake.\n\"Please,\" he urged, \"run away! If they will find you with me, I will be killed.\" He was afraid\nthat maybe someone noticed me. I hastened back to the potato field, hiding...hiding in the\nrain all night. At dawn, I returned to the peasant, asking him for directions to Warsaw, to a\nside road. \"How is a good road to Warsaw away to a regular highway?\" He gave me some\nfood and told me where to go.",
        "Q: What kind of clothes did you wear?",
        "A: I was wearing ordinary clothes. They smelled...stinked terrible. I didn't have anything except\nI was wearing. I looked like a living skeleton. We all did. When I wandered from village to\nvillage or from one village to the other, I met a man. He comes close and I greeted him in\nPolish, and said to him, \"May God be praised.\" Yah...Yah. The man paused and asked me,\n\"Are you a Jew?\" I said, \"Yes.\" Then he said, \"Are you of the people who scorched\nTreblinka?\" I said, \"Yes.\" This Christian man, who was walking in the opposite direction\nfrom where I came, turned back, and taking...taking my arm said, \"I am taking you to my\nhome.\" When his wife saw the way I looked, his wife looked at me...she ordered me to take\nmy soiled shirt...to take off my soiled shirt, and gave me a clean one. You know what she\nsaid to me? \"This is my husband's only extra shirt.\" They gave it to me. They gave me a\nhealthy meal, and inquired about my plans. I told those two honest good people that I want to\ngo to Warsaw. They ask me, \"Are this...are those your plans?\" They were good people, and\nthey advised me against it. I said again, I insist, because I know people in Warsaw. They\nsaid, \"Don't go. They will kill you there.\"",
        "Q: How long did you stay with these people?",
        "A: I was there two weeks. But I realized that no good will come by my staying there any longer.\nWhen I...when I came to that peasant, they helped me when I...he said to me that I should go\ninto hiding in the fields. Yah. At night, I came to the house and they gave me some food.\nYah. One night I came there and sit down and start eating; but suddenly came in a neighbor\nand started to hit me in face shouting, \"Come with me, Jew! Get up! Come with me!\" To the\nwomen, he shouted, \"They are criminals! They burned down Treblinka! And you will hide\nthe Jews,\" he said to the women. \"Let me take him to the Germans. I will get a premium for\nhis head.\" And he didn't want to let me go. The woman cried, begging him to let me go. But\nhe was holding on to my arm. When the woman saw that he was not giving up, she grabbed\nhim from the back with both her arms and yelled to me, \"Run! Save yourself!\" And I run\naway. Because it was darkness and the peasant was afraid to run after me, thinking maybe I\nam with more people. When I was running in the darkness, thinking of this fine, brave\nwoman. Such a beautiful soul! You cannot find anywhere. And they gave me so much help.\n[...1 went back to the field, and laid there until midnight. Because at night, in the evening,\nyou hear every movement. I...I noticed how they extinguished the lights in the houses.\nCrawling on all four, I returned at midnight. Traveling on my knees I returned to the stable\nand fell asleep there. One night is also good. Yah. And I slept there. And in the morning, the\nfarmer found me in the stable and asked me to leave. \"My God, they will kill you! They will\nkill me! They will kill all of us, and burn down the house. But he said, \"You know what?\nStay here 'til the evening, and leave in the dark. Yah. But you leave during the night.\nTomorrow is a Catholic holiday, and my relatives will come here. And they will sleep here\nin that barn. There is no other place for them. I want you to stay here all day, and as soon as\nit will get dark.\" He brought me during the day some food to eat. And I left; but every night\nafter that, I still came back. He used to give me some...a little food and I disappeared. Almost\nafter 2 weeks coming back and forth during the night, give me...give me..I asked him one\nday, please, give me a razor that I can shave off my beard. And he didn't even have a razor.\nSo...so he had a...some kind of a knife and I cut my beard off. Yah. I cut my beard, washed\nmyself, and I thanked him for all the help, for the food, and his kindness. And at dawn I left\nin the direction of Warsaw to a station called [Kostki (ph)]. No...when it got...1t started the\ndaylight, I started to walk in that direction. There 1s a little train goes from there. Yelp. Good.\nI thanked him and thanked her for the kindness again; and as soon as it got light, daylight, I\nstarted to walk in that direction. I asked some peasants that I met on the road, I asked if this\nis the direction to [Kostki (ph)], and they said yes. I met a guy who was a smuggler. I said to\nhim, \"I also a thief, but I had no packages of my own.\" Yah. He said, \"I would like to help\nyou the load.\" When I arrived at the station, I saw a woman and that you are holding a child\nwith some bundles of clothes so, yah, I had some money with me so I gave it to her and\nasked her to buy me a ticket to Warsaw, toward a station near Warsaw called Piastow. You\nknow what I said to her? \"I will help you carry the packages, but you help buy me a ticket to\nget to Warsaw.\" She believed me, but she could not buy me a ticket. But they had no tickets\nto Piastow. But also to write the ticket, he had no time so I had to buy a ticket to Warsaw.\nYah. We traveled on the train. I covered my face like I had a tooth ache, and I arrived to that\nstation in Piastow. I rested for awhile in a field and then I walked. There was a tramway, a\nstreet car going in that direction, so I took the street car...I took the street car. It was too early\nfor the tramway, for the street car, so I walked in the direction of Piastow. When I arrived in\nPiastow, I slept on...on...on...and rested a little bit because it was early. And then I went to\nthe door of a friend of mine that I knew from . When he looked at me, he did not recognize\nme. So he wanted...he gave me some money like I am a beggar. When I didn't want to take\nthe money, he realized who I am. He said, \"You have... , he said, \"You are alive. You have to\nsurvive.\" My friend, his name was Jarosz Wac_aw Nowak. And this was...he is the one who\nmade...give me the meaningful help. This is the man who provided me with this document,\nname Romanowski. Yah...that I am a Pole, that I employed of the railroad. Yah. He saved\nmy life, and this is the document. This is the document. This document saved my life. I used\nit all the time. This Polish Christian was a honest man. Physically very weak, he wasn't able\nto sleep or eat because of fear that he is hiding a Jew. Everyday his wife felt that he is losing\nhis mind, because there were stories in the paper about people getting killed because they\nwere hiding Jews in their homes. And he was so scared. And then I tells them, I said, \"You\ndon't have to sacrifice your life for mine. I can not blame you for being scared for helping a\nJew. Iam thankful for all you did for me. Yah. I am so thankful to you.\" And on Sunday\nmorning, I left his home and started searching for another place.",
        "Q: How long did it take for you to find another hiding spot?",
        "A: I came to another Christian I used to do business with before the war. And I left with him\nsome things when I went out, when I ran away from Warsaw. In fact, from after I left my\nfriend, I went to him. I came to that Christian. I asked him to help me. The woman has...was\na strong-willed person. She said she has only one room in the apartment where I can stay\nwith them under the bed. After a night of discomfort under this iron bed, I was ready to give\nmyself up to the militia. Yah. But I tried again, and I stayed in this place for several months.\nYah. Yah. I adjusted to the routine of 18 hours under the bed. Only when they left the room,\nI locked the door, crawled out from my...from under the bed concealment, did my things in\nthe chamberpot...they removed. They had to carry it out in packages. One day I was forced to\nleave this place. A German officer was slain in the area, and as a punishment they expelled\nall inhabitants of that neighborhood. Again, I started to look for a place to stay. I find a coach\ndriver, a simple honest soul. Yah. He told me, \"I live in a rented shack. One room is still\nliveable. The other room is falling apart. The shanty has no windows. If you are satisfied to\nlive in it, I will rent it to you.\" I said, \"Yes.\" I packed that chamber. This man had a little girl.\nShe knew that I was hidden there. There was no windows. Always darkness. Everything was\nclosed in. I never saw the daylight. I almost turned blind. Only through a small crack, a split\nin the wall, I was able to listen of what was going on on the outside. And from there I had to\nrun away too. Then...from there I had to escape, because the woman who owned the shack\nhad a pig she wanted to slaughter. And my landlord, the coach driver, advised her to hold the\npig until Easter. Yah. In the meantime, the pig was stole. The woman accused the driver of\nstealing the pig, and was ready to denounce him to the militia. Yah. It became dangerous to\nremain there any longer, and I escaped. Again, I returned to Pruszkow to a man I knew was\nmaking illegally vodka. I asked him to help me. He gave me lodging in a warm place and let\nme taste his brew. But in the morning, his mother came. When he made that vodka, he\nneeded somebody to help him and he hoped that I can stay there and help him. All night I\nfelt warm and I had enough to eat, but in the morning his mother came, and she recognized\nme and asked me immediately to leave and if I don't leave she will report me to the militia.\nBut he said to me...he wanted to help me...He said my wife passed away. The apartment\nwhere I lived is no...is unoccupied. I will take you there. In this place there are two more\napartments. I walked around without shoes so he took me there and so no one can hear my\nsteps I walked up there and I slept on a straw mattress. Yah. After a short time, he came to\nme and asked me to leave. \"It is bad,\" he said, \"a friend of his was registered in this\napartment in order to get employment, in the factory Tudor.\" The friend knew that the\napartment is vacant and he insisted that I allowed to move in, and that he will not give him\nhis permission voluntarily, he will force him to give it up by going to the militia.\" And then\nhe made me another offer. I have a girlfriend, a school teacher. She has an apartment in\nWarsaw. She stays here with her sister in this area. She is asking 3,000 zlotys monthly rent,\nand 10,000 zlotys key money. I still has 3 metals piece of material, more than the amount she\nasks. He gave me the address in Warsaw and I went there alone, and he followed me later.\nHe was arrested by the Germans, but I made it. I...I had...what do I have to lose? I arrived\nthere at the apartment on January 13, 3rd floor. I gave her the materials, and the teacher and\nher sister were already waiting for us. But they both were worried when Wacek (ph) did not\ncome. He...because he gave me the address that I should go by myself. But he was...the\nGermans got a hold of him and put him to work. When I got there, to that...to that apartment,\non January 13, and she was...and the sis...like I said, the sister was waiting for me already.\nBut after awhile he finally arrived. They were very upset and nervous. The Germans made\nhim to do some work and let him go. I rented their place and remained there. This apartment\nwas the Garden of Eden for me, with running water, a wash room. The apartment had an\nadvantage. The neighbor was deaf. He could not hear the water running. I lived in the\napartment until the Polish uprising in August 1944. One day through the window I noticed\nunusual movement. People were running, building barricades. I heard bombs bursting in the\nair and gun fire. The houses were shaking. I was thinking of what to do? Where to go? I was\nout of food and the water was cut off. I decided that there was nothing more to lose. I locked\nthe door and went outside. Every home, every building was controlled by a watchman, a\npatrol on the lookout for unfamiliar faces. Yah. When they saw my strange face they wanted\nto know who I was. I told them that I live on the side of the Vistula River. I am a friend of\nthe teacher who lives upstairs. She wanted me to keep an eye on her apartment and her\nbelongings whenever I visited Warsaw. Unfortunately, today I was caught in the middle of\nthe battle and the bombings and I can't return home to Praga.\u2019 The watchman became\nfriendly with me, and I became his assistant and his helper. I was his assistant. After several\ndays when I saw that I am dealing with an honest man, I confessed to him. I said, \"Listen\nfriend, forgive me for not telling me the truth. But I want you to know, I am a Jew. You\nknow our condition. We are forced to live in hiding.\" I was moved...he was moved by the\nwords, and told me from now on, I must join him in his home and eat with his family. I\nknew, he said, that you have no food. Knowing how little he has, I refused to go and eat at\nhis home. But he insisted. He sent one of his children to call me home for dinner. \"You will\neat what I will eat,\" he said, \"you will share our rations.\" He was a poor man, honest and\ngenerous. Yah. I became his assistant watching the side entrances to the building assigned to\nus. There was a tunnel from one house to the other and I was helping him. Yah. There was a\nbakery in a nearby building that belonged to a Turkish family. And I was...became friend\nwith that baker. I played chess with that baker. He was a man my age, and he became a good\nfriend. One day I confessed him that I am a Jew. He embraced me and kissed me. Why didn't\nyou tell me this before? From now on, you must take 10 loaves of bread. Ten loaves of bread\nat the time were like 10 pounds of gold. People were starving for a piece of bread. Why do\nyou want me to have so much bread I ached him. Go find your people and feed them. Sorry,\nI told him. I have no contact with any of my people here. We became such close friend that\nwhen neighbor...neighbors needed bread, they came to me. One day they declared a cease\nfire. All foreigners leaving in Warsaw were allowed to live..to leave. My Turkish friend\ndecided to leave. He gave me the keys of the bakery and told me, \"You are...you are now the\nowner.\" But I decided to join the Polish Party Liberation of the Polish Workers Party. This\nwas the Polska Partia Socialisticina, the Polish Socialist Party. Yah. I was assigned to the fire\narm brigade. Our tasks was to save the people still buried into the ruins at the destroyed\nbuildings. Some families were still living under the bomb-wrecked dwellings. And we were\nable to save a lot of people. There I found another Jew among the firefighters. After 2\nmonths of ferocious warfare, we lost the uprising against the Germans. All the Polish\npopulation was forced to surrender. And I abandoned the city limits of Warsaw. I decided\nnot to leave. Myself and seven more people constructed a hiding place in a bunker of the\nburned-out buildings between Ponska and Sliska Street. We lived there in misery until we\nwere liberated January 17, 1945. It was so terrible there we could hardly survive. We almost\ndid not survive. We were hungry, cold, despondent. But one might, a man discovered our\nhiding place. He asked, \"Jews, are you hungry? Have you any bags?\" We said, \"Yes.\"\n\"Come with me,\" he said. He carried an iron hand saw. We followed him in an abandoned\nwarehouses, homes..homes of people who their forced to leave Warsaw. We could open the\n' Suburb of Warsaw.\ngates and locks, and we carried off a couple of hundred pounds of food and clothes. It lasted\nus until the day of liberation. We find good clothes and good food...food that we did not have\ntil then. After liberation, we..the Polish units liberated me.",
        "Q: After liberation, did you remain in Warsaw or did you leave Poland?",
        "A: I remained in Poland. I went back to _6d_, and I was offered a high position in the new\nPolish Administration.",
        "Q: Did they give you this position because of your participation in the Treblinka uprising or\nyour serving...?",
        "A: Yes. Both. I still have the documents of recognition given me by the Polish government. The\nnew Polish administration gave me all the support. I was director of a, big, uh, company. But\nthey insisted that I remain under the name Romanowski, and I remained under that\nname...what you see here..until I left Poland.",
        "Q: When did you leave the country?",
        "A: I left Poland at the end of 1946. I realized that there 1s no future for us in Poland. I was\nmarried a half a year before. Leaving...I left Poland in the illegal immigration organized by\nthe Brichah, the Jewish underground. We pretended that we are citizens of Greece returning\nhome.",
        "Q: How long did you stay?",
        "A: Finally, I arrived in Munich, Germany; and there we received permits to travel to France. We\ngot...lay there...waiting a little while in Germany, we got a permit to go from Munich to\nFrance.",
        "Q: And from France?",
        "A: And I was 1n...for a little while in France, for a year and a half. We were, with my wife, a\nyear and a half in France.",
        "Q: When did you go to Europe?",
        "A: In France, we received...from an uncle we received...from my wife's uncle...these travel visa\npermits to Paraguay. Yah. On our stop in Uruguay, we planned to change our planes and go\nto Argentina. But it was the responsibility of the American Joint Distribution Committee, but\nwhen we arrived in Uruguay, the Joint...we were the responsibility of the Joint\nCommittee...yah...but we did not want to stay in the wagon, so we crawled out through the\nwindows, and we were arrested by civilian policemen. He asked us, \"Where are you going?\"\nWe did not speak Spanish. So he took us to the police station. The police chief...he did not\nknow Polish...so he called in a translator who spoke German. The woman was a door\nwatcher, and she wanted to know why did we escaped through the windows of the train. So I\ntold them I cannot understand why we...they locked the wagon doors. Today is August 25.\nIt's a national Uruguayan holiday. We are not criminals. We just wanted to share in the\nebullitions with the Uruguayan people. So he started to apologize. It is not you...you are\ndoing that...the Joint wants to send you somewhere else. He saw that my wife was pregnant\nand he continued. \"You are in a new and a free country.\" Yah. \"Where else do you want to\ngo.\" We said, \"To Paraguay.\" \"Why did you need to go to Paraguay,\" he said. \"Remain here\nand you will have a Uruguayan son.\" We are really...really fortunate and thankful to the\nUruguayan government and to the people for their friendly reception. We are now proud\nUruguayan citizens. Our government helped us with everything we needed. We are now\npart...we are now part of the Uruguayan nation. A beautiful people and a good government!\nWe are honored with visits to our home by the Vice Presidents of the Republic. Yah. We\nhave the high...high people in government visiting us. We are helping our country develop\nnew industries, and we are very happy in Uruguay.",

        "A: I started, sadly, very young; because the economic situation in our home was such that my\nfather himself was not able to provide for us the needs and support. He did everything\npossible to sustain us; but until '39, I worked hard helping to support my family.",
        "A: When the Germans came in on September Ist, 1939, they annexed the City of 6d_ in the\nThird Reich. Life in 6d_ turned into a hell for our people. They grabbed us on the streets,\ntormented and humiliated us. We were driven to degrading work. Beatings, robbery and\ninsults became a daily occurrence. Since my oldest...I was the oldest son, I asked my\nyounger brother to escape to Russia, but many Jews escaped at that time to Russia. And\nthanks to my advice, my brother survived. As I said before, he lives with me in Uruguay.\nThe rest of my family all perished. My sisters perished. Everybody perished. Out of 6\nbrothers and sisters, just I and my brother survived.",
        "A: But if...in the beginning of October '39, I took my younger sister and went with her--the\nother ones were married already--and I went with her to a small town called Pruszkow, a\nsmall town 18 kilometers to Warsaw. I had there some people I knew. This was the Polish\nprotectorate and the regiment there was not so severe as in_6d_.I planned to bring all my\nfamily there, but my goal was to transfer all of them there. But the situation in_6d_\ndeteriorated so..I...1t was difficult and dangerous to bring them there.",
        "A: In Pruszkow, in the beginning, the system was still bearable. And we lived in a ghetto, but\nthe area was not closed. We could go around and move around freely. Three times a week\nwe were have to taken to the railroad labor camp, and we worked there without pay and we\nwere harassed and beaten. After awhile they liquidated the ghetto, and transferred all men to\nthe railroad camp. The women and children were sent to the Warsaw ghetto. The men\ncontinued working there at the railroad. We slept there and worked there. Yah. But the\nremainder, like I said, they sent to the ghetto of Warsaw.",
        "A: Yah. My sister also went to Warsaw. After the liquidation of the railroad brigades in\nPruszkow, they marched us to Warsaw, and I was reunited with my sister.",
        "A: The situation was very, very sad. Hunger...children... people were laying in the\nstreet...swollen with hunger.... bodies covered with sores. It was very bad. I looked aside\nimmediately to find a way to leave the ghetto. I obtained some travel document and left\nWarsaw. I got a permit to a town called Ostrow Lubelski, in the Lublin area. Lubelski. It was\na place away from the main road, 7 kilometers from the nearest railroad station. Life was\nthere so much easier that we lived by selling our belongings, our clothes. We were not\nhungry. We exchanged things for food. We did not suffer. We did not suffer any hunger\nthere. But unfortunately, in October '42, yah, the German decided to liquidate all remaining\nJewish communities in the area. And marched us off on foot to a small town called\nLubart\u00e9w. In Lubartow, they assembled all Jewish from Parczew and other towns. They\npacked us on the cattle wagons...in cattle wagons, they took us 1n a transport of 12,000\nJews...were taken to Treblinka.",
        "A: (Long pause) It took lot more longer than normal, because this was not a regular scheduled\ntransport. It frequently stopped to wait for the regular trains to pass. The road to Treblinka\nwas already . They hurried us in the cattle wagons, flogging us with whips, squeezing 150\npeople into a wagon. We had to do things, you know, natural things in the place where we\nwere...in the wagons. The Ukrainians who were watching us took money to get us water, but\nwas no water...yah...or valuables...and never gave us the water. Many times they took away\nour valuables or whatever we had, but they never gave us the water.",
        "A: I believe that the only Ukrainians were the guards who helped the liquidation of the Jewish\ncommunities in the area where we lived. Yah.",
        "A: (Long pause) Before I will answer this question, let me tell something that bothers me 'til this\nday all my life. I can't forgive myself for something I did. On the train to Treblinka, my sister\nbegged me to give her some food. Because we had very little food with us. They cheated us.\nWe were told as they are taking us for work in Russia and it will take many days until we\nwill reach our destination. I did not give my sister, Anna, which she accepted my reasoning\nand was willing to suffer and hold off her thirst and craving for food. \"Alright, I will do\nwithout the food as long as we will come to a place and survive.\" She was so weak upon\narrival that they dispatched her to the gas chambers as soon as we arrived. (Long pause) The\ntrain arrived at a station called Treblinka. The transport came to a halt and was taken to the\nforest 4 o'clock in the morning. We were staying there a little less than two hours. Then we\nsaw that...what...what our destiny is. The door opens. Yah. We looked at each other, and we\nrealized that it didn't take long. We came through the forest and we arrived at the real camp,\nTreblinka. The doors opened, and we were ordered to get out with screams, \"Schnell!\nAusschteigen!\"--\"Hurry! Out! Men to the right! Women and small children to the left!\" The\nmen on the right ordered to this rope to bind our shoes 1n pairs. They later send the shoes to\nGermany. In a hurry, we had to undress. They selected the young among us and ordered us\nto collect in a hurry. All the clothing and belongings of the people from the spot where they\nundressed, and take them to a large place where they pointed out. Yah. It was a receptacle\nfor mountains of shoes, clothes, bags, and suitcases. It was terrible. We were...we were\nworking in a chain, running from the undressing spot to the receptacle...all day long. After\nwe finished with the men's belongings, we were hurried to the barrack where the women\nundressed upon arrival. Then the marched us to the left where the women and the children\nwere. We undressed in the field, but the women and the children were inside the barrack.\nWhen we came to take their clothes, nobody was there any more. Just a heap of clothing that\nwe carried to the same place we delivered the men's belongings. Yah. We have to leave it\nthere. And all it was done in a hurry. We did it running...back and forth, back and forth, we\nwere running. While running back and forth, we heard the German calling, \"Who 1s a\nbarber?\" I thought what did I have to lose and I said, \"I am a barber.\" They had already four\nmen chosen. I was the fifth man. A friend of mine that followed me was rejected. I...I called\non him to come close but it was too late. The Germans did not want any more barbers. He\ntook the five of us to the clothes magazines barrack and ordered them to give us a pair of\npants, a pair of shoes, and a shirt. The Germans ordered all to perform all works. He said that\nwe will be...will be sorting clothes, and then 1n addition will be..are...he is giving us an\nassignment as a barber. I did not know what mine...what mine assignment 1s. I knew how to\nwork there from another man who worked there. He said, \"Get yourselves a pair of scissors.\"\nWe were also warned by one of the men who belonged to the barber work, that we must\nwork in bent down positions. If not, we will be constantly beaten. The Germans walked\naround us with whips, constantly beating us. As soon as I start to work, I got a beating and\nwas bleeding from my head and face. I find some water, washed away the blood and\nreturned to work. This is the place where I worked. The first work was sorting the heaps of\nclothes, separating the shirts, pants, coats, and eyeglasses. Not just sorting, but also checking\nto see if jacket collars, cuffs of the pants, or the shoulder pads were hiding anything of value.\nIf you found money or a ring, we put it in a designated place. People hoped that they can\nsave it. And we had to control that. And I worked at the sorting barrack. We\nlooked...diamonds separate, rings separate. There I worked for about 2 days.",
        "A: (Long pause) On the second day, while separating clothes, I recognized my sister's dress.\nThe same day the new transport arrived and a German came up to called us. The new five\nbarbers join the five old ones. The five barbers of the old ones and the five new ones. Yah. I\nhad my scissors, and they marched us to the gas chambers area. The gas chambers was in an\nopen place with two entries. The gas chambers consist of 2 chambers. On the open door they\nrushed the victims with yellish, yelling and screaming. They had to go through that open gas\nchamber. They forced them to sit down, and we cut their hair with five cuts. We removed the\nwomen's hair. This was a...one of the most terrible times for me in Treblinka. My last contact\nwith living victims. I had such moments...a woman came in and grabbed my arm...my arm\nand asking me if the young will stay alive. I couldn't tell her otherwise. I said...Yes, I...I\nwill...the young will survive. The women then said to me, \"Now I can die assured that my\nson who...who came with me will live and take revenge for our misfortunes.\" We collected\nthe hair in valises and suitcases. The hair by the...the Germans are using the victims hair for\nthe military industry. This is material to strengthen the military and the German industry. I\nhad some ghastly periods at the barber place. A mother came to me begging not to cut her\nhair in such a hurry. She should like to die together with her daughter who 1s blind...with a\nfew people behind her. I wanted to help her. I slowed down cutting of her hair. Then a whip\ncame down on my face and head. I asked my friend to help the daughter to come closer, but\nhe couldn't do it. Yah. He couldn't do it. Another I had, the girl came to the gas chambers\narea, shouted, loudly shouting hysterically, laughing and screaming, said, \"Don't cry. Let's\nshow the murderers that we are not afraid to die. Don't give him the satisfaction to see you\nsad.\" She didn't want to give him the pleasure that they should see us cry, dying.",
        "A: This...this disdainful work, I worked for 3 days...2 or 3 days. After this, after I worked the 2\nor the 3 days, then nobody...it was a fact sorting the clothes in the barracks. From there, they\nselected 30 men--myself among them--and marched us to Camp 2.",
        "A: Treblinka was divided in two camps. Lager No. | was a place for sorting clothes and\nbelongings of the victims and cutting their hair, and so on. In Camp 2, the other camp, we\nwere in contact only with the dead. This was the devil's factory. In the first 2 days in\nTreblinka, we still hoped that maybe we will be able to escape and we saved some food,\nscraped up some underwear and a coat for this eventuality. But in Camp 2, we realized that\nthey will search us. I got rid of the coat and all other things, because if they would find other\nthings on me, they would have killed me and the other 30 men. I saw that they will search\nus...and if they would find something, they would have killed me.",
        "A: The SS men and the Ukrainian guards.",
        "A: They were police units. (Long pause) Among them, there are bad people. So...so much\nworser than the Germans. Let me give you an example. In 1945, '44, while hiding in a\nbunker in the destroyed Warsaw, I described my sufferings in Treblinka in a notebook. I\ndidn't know then if I will survive and the world will not know what happened to us. In my\nnotebook, I wrote about Treblinka. When I wrote then, I referred to the men there...we were\ntreated by the Ukraine guards. There were a few Ukrainians...three of them...one's name was\n\"Ivan the Terrible.\" I was a witness at a court proceeding of Ivan [NB: John] Demjanjuk.\nOnce in the United States, and now in Israel. I knew him as \"the devil Ivan. I didn't know\nthen that his name was Ivan Demjanjuk. Yah. We called him \"Ivan the devil.\" He was\nworking as a mechanic blacksmith who leaked in the gas into the gas chamber. Yah. He was\ngassing the people. He was a sadist, taking pleasure in his work. He liked what he did. I\nremember one day, he brought our food rations from Camp | to Camp 2. In this moment, he\nstopped his horse driven car, picked up an iron...picked up an iron bar and started hitting the\npeople with this 1ron pole. The screams of the people were unbearable. He kept that long\npiece of iron and continued, the people who were waited there, keep beating them...beating\nthem...hitting them with that piece of iron. And he had the joy doing that. I...1 can share with\nyou another example of his cruelties. I worked for awhile with a dentist group, yah,\nremoving the false teeth from the victims...after they brought them out from the gas\nchambers. The dentists were close to Ivan's workshop. It was very close nearby... where he\nkept his motors running, so that I saw... saw him very often. One day, by cleaning...washing\nthe bloody teeth with a friend of mine. His name was Finkelstein. He was from the town of\nP_ock. Yah, I don't remember exactly. I think he was from P_ock. It took him...took a\ndrill...that was used to drill holes in wood and stick the drill into Finkelstein's backside. In\nthe backside...in laughing, continually laughing. He screamed, \"Gevalt!\" Finkelstein then\nwas crying. Even told him that if he will not stop screaming, he will...he said...he had so\nmuch joy doing that. He used to take one, grabbing people and cutting off an ear. When the\nvictims was bleeding all over, he ordered them to undress. He shouted. The sadism of that\nIvan was so enormous that you find it difficult to speak about.",
        "A: It is impossible to repeat it. The other evil guard was Mikolai, his helper. The third man was\ncalled [Tsicktsark (ph)]. All the time they walked around beating the people. Murdering the\nvictims was their enjoyment, their pleasure. The foreman of the dentists group was a Dr.\nZimmermann, and the guard tolerated him and he had influence on the Ukraine | Tsicktsack\n(ph)| He had some influence on him, and he intentionally involved the guard in all matters of\nconversation in order to keep him away from beating us. We explored Dr. Zimmermann,\nplease, keep him busy with conservation so he will not have the time to so brutally badger\nus. In Treblinka, we were not allowed to walk, but always run. We continually had to be\nguard that our faces are free of injuries and show no marks or scars of the facing. Whoever\nhad a bloody face or scars was taken out in the evening, line up and shot. They looked if we\ncan still pick up our legs. If not, they took it out and killed us.",
        "A: I think...we think there were about 100 SS men and 40 Ukrainians. You keep referring to SS\nGerman Ukrainians.",
        "A: (Long pause) They were able every day (pause)...they killed every day about 15,000\npeople...all Jews. One time I remember a gypsy transport of 500 people. Transports kept\ncoming from all over...from all over Europe. And the people were so abused, victimized,\nwent through such a hell and severe beating that they wanted to die. The nurse stood\nthere...only beating...constantly beating...constantly beating and killing.",
        "A: (Long pause) Let me tell you certain things before I answer this question. I saw personally a\nmother holding an infant in line for the gas chamber. Yah. She had a small child with her.\nThe German tore the child from the mother's arms, hit the child, and holding the infant by its\nlegs, he shushed the head against the wall. This was one of the daily scenes we saw in\nTreblinka. Then you ask me, \"How come about rebellion?,\" I can say to you the same thing I\nsaid to the judge when I was in Cleveland. I said, \"Your Honor, I was blind.\" The Judge\nunderstood what I said. But Ivan's attorney kept pressing the question, \"How can you claim\nyou were blind when you can see?\" The judge interrupted him, interrupted the attorney,\n\"Why do you keep asking this man such questions? Any human being facing such atrocities\nbecomes blind.\" We saw everything and perceived nothing. We become inhuman,\nincoherent. Our vision was overcast. We did not know what was happening to us. We\nhoped...we always kept asking, maybe someone will survive. Maybe a miracle will happen, a\nplane will come and bomb Treblinka and free us from the misery. We worked. We worked\nthere for many months. The whole world forgot about us. Our lives were worthless. The\nwhole world forgot about us. For this reason of hopelessness and broken spirits... (Long\npause) Let me...let me tell you. Yah. Treblinka, if we would have not have made this...the\nuprising, (Long pause) they warned that there would not be a sign that there ever was a death\ncamp in Treblinka. They had graves, mass graves, that were about 200,000 people in them.\nThey brought special machinery to dig deep...deep, deep holes. All those people, all those\nbodies, we..we put them there--one head to the feet--in order that there should be more place\nfor the people. One on top of the other, tens of thousands of people. When they\ndiscovered...you know, they discovered of the victims of Katyn and massacre, the mass\nmurder of Polish officers. Also the Germans defeat at Stalingrad, [on] their retreat, they\nstarted to worry, \"Would the world discover the murderous deeds in Treblinka?\" The deep\npits, mass graves, will be proof of their atrocities. They started to remove the bodies of the\nvictims and burn them. The same big machines which excavated the ground before started to\nremove the corpses, the remains...bloody parts of the people. They built a crematorium, but it\nwas too small for their purpose. This crematorium was not enough. It wasn't satisfactory for\ntheir needs. There was not enough results by just burning them. Then the arrived a specialists\nin the field, a man who [was] called [Wait (ph)|. He was a specialists in his trade. He did the\nfollowing. He did a simple thing. He took 5 or 6 railroad tracks each 30 meters long. Around\nit, he built a brick wall. He laid the tracks 15 centimeters apart...centimeters apart...and one\nand a half meters above the ground, up to one and a half metals. On those tracks, he covered\nthem with the corpses of the victims. The first layer were a woman, yah, their stomachs on\nthe tracks. Yah. We loaded 2,000 (pause)...we covered them with 2,500 corpses, counting...\nHow did we counted those people? We counted only the heads. Each head was...had one\nnumber. And we set them...when they were 1n a certain order, they set them on fire. Yah. In\nthe beginning, they burned the victims in daytime. But the flames were so immense that it\nwas impossible to stay close to the place. All day long we kept putting bodies one top of the\nother. So they changed the system. We worked all day from 6 in the morning to 6 in the\nevening. Only an hour before, we stopped working at 5 PM, when the mountains of corpse\nwere in place, yah, we worked with rough hand tools wracking the bodies in their place. We\ntook the branches and dried up bushes, and we put them under the tracks and set them on\nfire. This was dry bushes we set. And this was a half a meter high. And we set it on fire. And\nthe flames were so strong that we were unable to stay any closer than 50 feet from the blaze.\nAfter a few hours, even the 50 meters close, we wouldn't be able to stay there. And this was\nburning night after night. The fires were burning all night. And in the morning, we were\nextinguish it, there'll still smoldering skeletons. A specially organized ashes brigade, the\ncolony...was called ash brigades to remove the bones. We removed the ashes with wooden\nsticks, beat and remained it into thin ashes. After this was done, yah, we had to sift the ashes\nin special screen boxes. Yah. We beat it with those pieces of wood. We had to beat the ashes.\nIf we found pieces of bones, we had to beat them again until it became thin like cigarette\nashes. Whatever it was it left. After that again we have to beat. Like...like flour, 1t was this\nthin.",
        "A: This...this process continued all the time I was in Treblinka. They wanted to cover up the\ndeeds, so that..so that no trace was...would be left. The ashes were later buried in the ground\nfrom where they excavated the bodies. One layer of ashes and one layer of dirt. Yah. When\nthe graves...their crematives close to the surface, they did not use any more ashes, only soil,\nso that no trace can be found. There was also a group they called Knochen colony. Their task\nwas to find any remains of human bones, little bones...burn them again so no signs\nwhatsoever can ever be found. Absolutely, absolutely nothing be left.",
        "A: This was going on until the uprising on August 2, 1943. If this would take a little bit longer,\nin a few more months, the world wouldn't have never know that there was a camp,\nTreblinka, which covered up their deeds so much that two kilometers from the original camp\nthey established a Obus Kari (ph), a penal camp, for smugglers and criminals. Yah. That\ncamp...they also called Treblinka. They wanted this camp as a coverup for the future. If\nsomeone will discover the real Treblinka with their gas chambers, they will have a place to\nshow that this was a place for criminals. Very few of us survived. After the war, when I\nreturned to Treblinka and I found Poles digging...digging the land, looking for valuables.",
        "A: The uprising was planned by Camp 1. The clothes sorting camp with 700 inmates. They\norganized the uprising. As..as...yah...they wanted to punish someone in camp 1, they used to\nsend them to us. They sent to us some people...among them were 2 officers of the\nCzechoslavakia army, one adult and one Jelo (ph). And they brought the information\nabout...of the conspiracy and about the preparations for the uprising. And they stayed in\ncontact with the first camp. The schlau (ph) who was there leading to the gas chambers...was\nleading to the gas chambers was regularly cleaned of blood marks. They had to clean it every\nday, and the inmates assigned to the cleaning shared information with our group in camp 2.\nWe took...we spoke loud to each other about other things, but we shared information.\nOriginally, the uprising was planned for May 1943. They prepared gold to bribe the guards,\nto pay for food. We had duplicate keys to the arsenal, but the same day a train load of\nsoldiers arrived, and the plan was postponed. The rifles and ammunition taken from the\narsenal were returned so that the Germans did not notice there're missing. The Germans did\nnot notice it. Now when we saw that the time passed and nothing had happened, we\ninformed camp 1, if they will not do something, we will not wait any longer and start a\nbreakout ourselves. We had our own conspiracy in camp 2. A small group of disciplined\npeople...we were afraid of too many people will know about our plans, we will be\ndiscovered. So we decided that the uprising will start at August 2 at 5 PM....Yah...in 1943, 5\nO'clock. Everyone in our group is given an assignment. My role was to get the people out of\nthe camp, urging them to leave. We shouted.",
        "A: Like I said, I had to urge the people to leave. We shouted that there is a revolution in Berlin.\nBecause of some mixup, we had to start a half an hour earlier. Yah, because they started\nearlier. The signal was if we hear two shots, then we will start. And it started a half an hour\nearlier. Everybody was in their place. But it was not successful. It was not fully successful.\nWe wanted to destroy the gas chambers. But we set on fire the garages, the warehouse\nchambers. Our plan was to get out of there and free the...the penal camp, but we were not\nable to do it. It became so chaotic. Many people were not in their places. After a few\nmoments, the...the Germans starting shooting and killing. They kept shooting, and we were\nrunning wild. In the shouting and confusion, I was screaming, \"People, save yourself!\" Some\nof them, uh, chose not to run, and then went back to the barracks. I was one of the last ones\nto leave. When I left a many was lay, already dead, killed. They opened fire with machine\nguns.",
        "A: Yah, there were Ukrainians and SS men who were shooting and killing us. And we were\nrunning in groups. I was...I was...I chose a road--not a main road, a side road, to run. And\nwhen I arrived a few kilometers in the daylight, I saw that we are too many people. We are\n20 people. So I decided that we should divide into...in...in...1nto two groups. This was still\ndaylight. This is August, middle of the summer. So we decided to hide...yah... in a field\namong the bushes. We...we stayed there for awhile. We saw the Germans are coming\nclose...and also the Ukrainians coming close. We were hiding in the bushes. One of the\ngroup...one of our group 1s in few minutes they open fire on them, and they killed them all.\nYah. But they did not notice us. No, the German soldiers that killed the groups. so they\ndeparted. They withdrew and departed. Next to me was laying a friend of mine, a Czech by\nthe name of Masaryk. He was related to the former President of Czechoslavakia. He come to\nTreblinka because his mother was Jewish. Yah. When they saw...when he he saw the\nGermans came near the field, he cut his veins. He did not want to...want to...the Germans to\ntake him alive. Yah. I bandaged his arm. I grabbed his arm and stopped the bleeding. As\nsoon as the Germans retreated and it got...and it got dark, we started to roam...bypassing the\nopen. We don't know if he survived. After a few days with the group, I decided to part. I was\nwith a friend of mine. They said I have a good face because we look like Christians. And we\ndecided during the night to go to a farm, to a peasant and ask for food. Some decent people\nhelped us. Some not, saying, \"Get lost, Jews!\" I saw...I realized that this is no way out of our\nsituation, and I suggested to my fellow fugitives to walk in the direction of Warsaw--a\ndistance of somewhere 80, 90 kilometers. I knew some Christian friends in Warsaw who\nwere active in the Polish underground. No one wanted to follow my advice. So I said to\nthem, \"Friends, sooner or later, some peasant will sell you to the Germans for 5 pounds of\nsugar.\" It was a time for 5 kellogs of sugar, they sold a Jew. So I parted with my friends. I\nsaid goodbye to them. And through side roads, I started to walk in the direction of Warsaw.\nIt's a long, long road. Then I arrived in Warsaw. The first night I was sleeping in a field. It\nwas raining all night. I rambled toward a farm house and started talking to the peasants. At\nthat moment, we heard shots and shouting. The peasant crossed himself and started to shake.\n\"Please,\" he urged, \"run away! If they will find you with me, I will be killed.\" He was afraid\nthat maybe someone noticed me. I hastened back to the potato field, hiding...hiding in the\nrain all night. At dawn, I returned to the peasant, asking him for directions to Warsaw, to a\nside road. \"How is a good road to Warsaw away to a regular highway?\" He gave me some\nfood and told me where to go.",
        "A: I was wearing ordinary clothes. They smelled...stinked terrible. I didn't have anything except\nI was wearing. I looked like a living skeleton. We all did. When I wandered from village to\nvillage or from one village to the other, I met a man. He comes close and I greeted him in\nPolish, and said to him, \"May God be praised.\" Yah...Yah. The man paused and asked me,\n\"Are you a Jew?\" I said, \"Yes.\" Then he said, \"Are you of the people who scorched\nTreblinka?\" I said, \"Yes.\" This Christian man, who was walking in the opposite direction\nfrom where I came, turned back, and taking...taking my arm said, \"I am taking you to my\nhome.\" When his wife saw the way I looked, his wife looked at me...she ordered me to take\nmy soiled shirt...to take off my soiled shirt, and gave me a clean one. You know what she\nsaid to me? \"This is my husband's only extra shirt.\" They gave it to me. They gave me a\nhealthy meal, and inquired about my plans. I told those two honest good people that I want to\ngo to Warsaw. They ask me, \"Are this...are those your plans?\" They were good people, and\nthey advised me against it. I said again, I insist, because I know people in Warsaw. They\nsaid, \"Don't go. They will kill you there.\"",
        "A: I was there two weeks. But I realized that no good will come by my staying there any longer.\nWhen I...when I came to that peasant, they helped me when I...he said to me that I should go\ninto hiding in the fields. Yah. At night, I came to the house and they gave me some food.\nYah. One night I came there and sit down and start eating; but suddenly came in a neighbor\nand started to hit me in face shouting, \"Come with me, Jew! Get up! Come with me!\" To the\nwomen, he shouted, \"They are criminals! They burned down Treblinka! And you will hide\nthe Jews,\" he said to the women. \"Let me take him to the Germans. I will get a premium for\nhis head.\" And he didn't want to let me go. The woman cried, begging him to let me go. But\nhe was holding on to my arm. When the woman saw that he was not giving up, she grabbed\nhim from the back with both her arms and yelled to me, \"Run! Save yourself!\" And I run\naway. Because it was darkness and the peasant was afraid to run after me, thinking maybe I\nam with more people. When I was running in the darkness, thinking of this fine, brave\nwoman. Such a beautiful soul! You cannot find anywhere. And they gave me so much help.\n[...1 went back to the field, and laid there until midnight. Because at night, in the evening,\nyou hear every movement. I...I noticed how they extinguished the lights in the houses.\nCrawling on all four, I returned at midnight. Traveling on my knees I returned to the stable\nand fell asleep there. One night is also good. Yah. And I slept there. And in the morning, the\nfarmer found me in the stable and asked me to leave. \"My God, they will kill you! They will\nkill me! They will kill all of us, and burn down the house. But he said, \"You know what?\nStay here 'til the evening, and leave in the dark. Yah. But you leave during the night.\nTomorrow is a Catholic holiday, and my relatives will come here. And they will sleep here\nin that barn. There is no other place for them. I want you to stay here all day, and as soon as\nit will get dark.\" He brought me during the day some food to eat. And I left; but every night\nafter that, I still came back. He used to give me some...a little food and I disappeared. Almost\nafter 2 weeks coming back and forth during the night, give me...give me..I asked him one\nday, please, give me a razor that I can shave off my beard. And he didn't even have a razor.\nSo...so he had a...some kind of a knife and I cut my beard off. Yah. I cut my beard, washed\nmyself, and I thanked him for all the help, for the food, and his kindness. And at dawn I left\nin the direction of Warsaw to a station called [Kostki (ph)]. No...when it got...1t started the\ndaylight, I started to walk in that direction. There 1s a little train goes from there. Yelp. Good.\nI thanked him and thanked her for the kindness again; and as soon as it got light, daylight, I\nstarted to walk in that direction. I asked some peasants that I met on the road, I asked if this\nis the direction to [Kostki (ph)], and they said yes. I met a guy who was a smuggler. I said to\nhim, \"I also a thief, but I had no packages of my own.\" Yah. He said, \"I would like to help\nyou the load.\" When I arrived at the station, I saw a woman and that you are holding a child\nwith some bundles of clothes so, yah, I had some money with me so I gave it to her and\nasked her to buy me a ticket to Warsaw, toward a station near Warsaw called Piastow. You\nknow what I said to her? \"I will help you carry the packages, but you help buy me a ticket to\nget to Warsaw.\" She believed me, but she could not buy me a ticket. But they had no tickets\nto Piastow. But also to write the ticket, he had no time so I had to buy a ticket to Warsaw.\nYah. We traveled on the train. I covered my face like I had a tooth ache, and I arrived to that\nstation in Piastow. I rested for awhile in a field and then I walked. There was a tramway, a\nstreet car going in that direction, so I took the street car...I took the street car. It was too early\nfor the tramway, for the street car, so I walked in the direction of Piastow. When I arrived in\nPiastow, I slept on...on...on...and rested a little bit because it was early. And then I went to\nthe door of a friend of mine that I knew from . When he looked at me, he did not recognize\nme. So he wanted...he gave me some money like I am a beggar. When I didn't want to take\nthe money, he realized who I am. He said, \"You have... , he said, \"You are alive. You have to\nsurvive.\" My friend, his name was Jarosz Wac_aw Nowak. And this was...he is the one who\nmade...give me the meaningful help. This is the man who provided me with this document,\nname Romanowski. Yah...that I am a Pole, that I employed of the railroad. Yah. He saved\nmy life, and this is the document. This is the document. This document saved my life. I used\nit all the time. This Polish Christian was a honest man. Physically very weak, he wasn't able\nto sleep or eat because of fear that he is hiding a Jew. Everyday his wife felt that he is losing\nhis mind, because there were stories in the paper about people getting killed because they\nwere hiding Jews in their homes. And he was so scared. And then I tells them, I said, \"You\ndon't have to sacrifice your life for mine. I can not blame you for being scared for helping a\nJew. Iam thankful for all you did for me. Yah. I am so thankful to you.\" And on Sunday\nmorning, I left his home and started searching for another place.",
        "A: I came to another Christian I used to do business with before the war. And I left with him\nsome things when I went out, when I ran away from Warsaw. In fact, from after I left my\nfriend, I went to him. I came to that Christian. I asked him to help me. The woman has...was\na strong-willed person. She said she has only one room in the apartment where I can stay\nwith them under the bed. After a night of discomfort under this iron bed, I was ready to give\nmyself up to the militia. Yah. But I tried again, and I stayed in this place for several months.\nYah. Yah. I adjusted to the routine of 18 hours under the bed. Only when they left the room,\nI locked the door, crawled out from my...from under the bed concealment, did my things in\nthe chamberpot...they removed. They had to carry it out in packages. One day I was forced to\nleave this place. A German officer was slain in the area, and as a punishment they expelled\nall inhabitants of that neighborhood. Again, I started to look for a place to stay. I find a coach\ndriver, a simple honest soul. Yah. He told me, \"I live in a rented shack. One room is still\nliveable. The other room is falling apart. The shanty has no windows. If you are satisfied to\nlive in it, I will rent it to you.\" I said, \"Yes.\" I packed that chamber. This man had a little girl.\nShe knew that I was hidden there. There was no windows. Always darkness. Everything was\nclosed in. I never saw the daylight. I almost turned blind. Only through a small crack, a split\nin the wall, I was able to listen of what was going on on the outside. And from there I had to\nrun away too. Then...from there I had to escape, because the woman who owned the shack\nhad a pig she wanted to slaughter. And my landlord, the coach driver, advised her to hold the\npig until Easter. Yah. In the meantime, the pig was stole. The woman accused the driver of\nstealing the pig, and was ready to denounce him to the militia. Yah. It became dangerous to\nremain there any longer, and I escaped. Again, I returned to Pruszkow to a man I knew was\nmaking illegally vodka. I asked him to help me. He gave me lodging in a warm place and let\nme taste his brew. But in the morning, his mother came. When he made that vodka, he\nneeded somebody to help him and he hoped that I can stay there and help him. All night I\nfelt warm and I had enough to eat, but in the morning his mother came, and she recognized\nme and asked me immediately to leave and if I don't leave she will report me to the militia.\nBut he said to me...he wanted to help me...He said my wife passed away. The apartment\nwhere I lived is no...is unoccupied. I will take you there. In this place there are two more\napartments. I walked around without shoes so he took me there and so no one can hear my\nsteps I walked up there and I slept on a straw mattress. Yah. After a short time, he came to\nme and asked me to leave. \"It is bad,\" he said, \"a friend of his was registered in this\napartment in order to get employment, in the factory Tudor.\" The friend knew that the\napartment is vacant and he insisted that I allowed to move in, and that he will not give him\nhis permission voluntarily, he will force him to give it up by going to the militia.\" And then\nhe made me another offer. I have a girlfriend, a school teacher. She has an apartment in\nWarsaw. She stays here with her sister in this area. She is asking 3,000 zlotys monthly rent,\nand 10,000 zlotys key money. I still has 3 metals piece of material, more than the amount she\nasks. He gave me the address in Warsaw and I went there alone, and he followed me later.\nHe was arrested by the Germans, but I made it. I...I had...what do I have to lose? I arrived\nthere at the apartment on January 13, 3rd floor. I gave her the materials, and the teacher and\nher sister were already waiting for us. But they both were worried when Wacek (ph) did not\ncome. He...because he gave me the address that I should go by myself. But he was...the\nGermans got a hold of him and put him to work. When I got there, to that...to that apartment,\non January 13, and she was...and the sis...like I said, the sister was waiting for me already.\nBut after awhile he finally arrived. They were very upset and nervous. The Germans made\nhim to do some work and let him go. I rented their place and remained there. This apartment\nwas the Garden of Eden for me, with running water, a wash room. The apartment had an\nadvantage. The neighbor was deaf. He could not hear the water running. I lived in the\napartment until the Polish uprising in August 1944. One day through the window I noticed\nunusual movement. People were running, building barricades. I heard bombs bursting in the\nair and gun fire. The houses were shaking. I was thinking of what to do? Where to go? I was\nout of food and the water was cut off. I decided that there was nothing more to lose. I locked\nthe door and went outside. Every home, every building was controlled by a watchman, a\npatrol on the lookout for unfamiliar faces. Yah. When they saw my strange face they wanted\nto know who I was. I told them that I live on the side of the Vistula River. I am a friend of\nthe teacher who lives upstairs. She wanted me to keep an eye on her apartment and her\nbelongings whenever I visited Warsaw. Unfortunately, today I was caught in the middle of\nthe battle and the bombings and I can't return home to Praga.\u2019 The watchman became\nfriendly with me, and I became his assistant and his helper. I was his assistant. After several\ndays when I saw that I am dealing with an honest man, I confessed to him. I said, \"Listen\nfriend, forgive me for not telling me the truth. But I want you to know, I am a Jew. You\nknow our condition. We are forced to live in hiding.\" I was moved...he was moved by the\nwords, and told me from now on, I must join him in his home and eat with his family. I\nknew, he said, that you have no food. Knowing how little he has, I refused to go and eat at\nhis home. But he insisted. He sent one of his children to call me home for dinner. \"You will\neat what I will eat,\" he said, \"you will share our rations.\" He was a poor man, honest and\ngenerous. Yah. I became his assistant watching the side entrances to the building assigned to\nus. There was a tunnel from one house to the other and I was helping him. Yah. There was a\nbakery in a nearby building that belonged to a Turkish family. And I was...became friend\nwith that baker. I played chess with that baker. He was a man my age, and he became a good\nfriend. One day I confessed him that I am a Jew. He embraced me and kissed me. Why didn't\nyou tell me this before? From now on, you must take 10 loaves of bread. Ten loaves of bread\nat the time were like 10 pounds of gold. People were starving for a piece of bread. Why do\nyou want me to have so much bread I ached him. Go find your people and feed them. Sorry,\nI told him. I have no contact with any of my people here. We became such close friend that\nwhen neighbor...neighbors needed bread, they came to me. One day they declared a cease\nfire. All foreigners leaving in Warsaw were allowed to live..to leave. My Turkish friend\ndecided to leave. He gave me the keys of the bakery and told me, \"You are...you are now the\nowner.\" But I decided to join the Polish Party Liberation of the Polish Workers Party. This\nwas the Polska Partia Socialisticina, the Polish Socialist Party. Yah. I was assigned to the fire\narm brigade. Our tasks was to save the people still buried into the ruins at the destroyed\nbuildings. Some families were still living under the bomb-wrecked dwellings. And we were\nable to save a lot of people. There I found another Jew among the firefighters. After 2\nmonths of ferocious warfare, we lost the uprising against the Germans. All the Polish\npopulation was forced to surrender. And I abandoned the city limits of Warsaw. I decided\nnot to leave. Myself and seven more people constructed a hiding place in a bunker of the\nburned-out buildings between Ponska and Sliska Street. We lived there in misery until we\nwere liberated January 17, 1945. It was so terrible there we could hardly survive. We almost\ndid not survive. We were hungry, cold, despondent. But one might, a man discovered our\nhiding place. He asked, \"Jews, are you hungry? Have you any bags?\" We said, \"Yes.\"\n\"Come with me,\" he said. He carried an iron hand saw. We followed him in an abandoned\nwarehouses, homes..homes of people who their forced to leave Warsaw. We could open the\n' Suburb of Warsaw.\ngates and locks, and we carried off a couple of hundred pounds of food and clothes. It lasted\nus until the day of liberation. We find good clothes and good food...food that we did not have\ntil then. After liberation, we..the Polish units liberated me.",
        "A: I remained in Poland. I went back to _6d_, and I was offered a high position in the new\nPolish Administration.",
        "A: Yes. Both. I still have the documents of recognition given me by the Polish government. The\nnew Polish administration gave me all the support. I was director of a, big, uh, company. But\nthey insisted that I remain under the name Romanowski, and I remained under that\nname...what you see here..until I left Poland.",
        "A: I left Poland at the end of 1946. I realized that there 1s no future for us in Poland. I was\nmarried a half a year before. Leaving...I left Poland in the illegal immigration organized by\nthe Brichah, the Jewish underground. We pretended that we are citizens of Greece returning\nhome.",
        "A: Finally, I arrived in Munich, Germany; and there we received permits to travel to France. We\ngot...lay there...waiting a little while in Germany, we got a permit to go from Munich to\nFrance.",
        "A: And I was 1n...for a little while in France, for a year and a half. We were, with my wife, a\nyear and a half in France.",
        "A: In France, we received...from an uncle we received...from my wife's uncle...these travel visa\npermits to Paraguay. Yah. On our stop in Uruguay, we planned to change our planes and go\nto Argentina. But it was the responsibility of the American Joint Distribution Committee, but\nwhen we arrived in Uruguay, the Joint...we were the responsibility of the Joint\nCommittee...yah...but we did not want to stay in the wagon, so we crawled out through the\nwindows, and we were arrested by civilian policemen. He asked us, \"Where are you going?\"\nWe did not speak Spanish. So he took us to the police station. The police chief...he did not\nknow Polish...so he called in a translator who spoke German. The woman was a door\nwatcher, and she wanted to know why did we escaped through the windows of the train. So I\ntold them I cannot understand why we...they locked the wagon doors. Today is August 25.\nIt's a national Uruguayan holiday. We are not criminals. We just wanted to share in the\nebullitions with the Uruguayan people. So he started to apologize. It is not you...you are\ndoing that...the Joint wants to send you somewhere else. He saw that my wife was pregnant\nand he continued. \"You are in a new and a free country.\" Yah. \"Where else do you want to\ngo.\" We said, \"To Paraguay.\" \"Why did you need to go to Paraguay,\" he said. \"Remain here\nand you will have a Uruguayan son.\" We are really...really fortunate and thankful to the\nUruguayan government and to the people for their friendly reception. We are now proud\nUruguayan citizens. Our government helped us with everything we needed. We are now\npart...we are now part of the Uruguayan nation. A beautiful people and a good government!\nWe are honored with visits to our home by the Vice Presidents of the Republic. Yah. We\nhave the high...high people in government visiting us. We are helping our country develop\nnew industries, and we are very happy in Uruguay.",
        "A: Yah. I give a lot of time and donate of my resources to Jewish education, schools, and to\nhelp the State of Israel.",
        "A: I consider this an obligation. I speak for those who can speak no more. I am their voice. I\nwant the whole world to know what happened to our people. I pray and hope that this will\nnever, never happen again. Not to us and not to other people anywhere. I want to thank Dr.\nLinda Kuzmack and you for the fine reception. I came to Washington. I want to thank you,\nDr. Kuzmack, and Herman Taube for your friendly reception you gave me. My , Herman\nTaube, on behalf of my wife and myself, I want you to continue that holy work of keeping\nthe memory of our people should never be forgotten. (Long pause)\n"
