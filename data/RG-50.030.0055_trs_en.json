        "Q: Would you tell me your name please?",
        "A: My name is Ralph Codikow.",
        "Q: Where and when were you born?",
        "A: I was born April 9th, 1930, in Kovno, Lithuania and lived in Panemon, Lithuania all my\nlife until I was 11 years old.",
        "Q: Where is Panemon in relation to Kovno?",
        "A: Panemon is on the outskirts of Kovno.",
        "Q: Ralph, would you tell me about your parents and about your family?",
        "A: Well, we were an average family in Lithuania before the war and...uh...my father, mother\nand a brother. I had a brother who was 7 years older than I was. And my father was in the\n...lumber business and lived there with his father, grandfather that I know oflived in\nLithuania. Before that I don't know.",
        "Q: Okay. What was your childhood like growing up?",
        "A: Well, it was a pretty happy childhood. I went to eider when I was about 6 years old, then\nat 7 I went to Hebrew gymnasium which is a high schoot until about...until I was about\n10 years old. And then in 1940...",
        "Q: Hold it one second. Before we get to 1940, tell me a little bit about...uh...the friends you\nhad, the things you did during the day as a child.",
        "A: Well, it was...1t was an average life. We had a...we lived in a nice town. Panemon was a\nsmall community. It consisted of one long street with a few alleys. And it was the\ngateway to which were...were summer homet3 B for the people who lived in Kovno.\nThey used to come over to spend their weekends in the woods and the forests where they\nhad built summer homes. Also was real close by and it was beautiful beach and we used\nto spend our weekends there and it was real nice before the war. And then in 1940, when\nthe Russians took over Lithuanta..*uh...we didn't have any more Hebrew schools and we\nhad to go to Yiddish schools and that's when we started g ~ learning Yiddish. I think\nHebrew was outlawed or something. And I studied there for 1 year in a different school\nuntil the Germans came in. And...well...uh...we could talk a little bit...uh...about that one\nyear.",
        "Q: Ya. Tell us about that. Well, uh my father had to leave his business because uh you\ncouldn't be a businessman under the \u2014_ Russian regime, and he tried to get a job several\ntimes and had difficulties because he didn't belong to any party, and he was not involved\nin politics. And being...having been in business before the war, it was a little difficult to\nget a job. So we kind of struggled through that year, but it wasn't too bad. We made tt.\nAnd...uh...and then in 41,when the Germans took over, that's when all Hell broke loose,\nso to speak. Uh...First of all, I remember like it was yesterday. It was on a Sunday\nmorning. And I had sat up until 4:00 in the morning making some names for my...for\nmy...for the uniforms of my basketball team. I was about 14years and I was...at 4:00 in\nthe morning when I was extremely tired I went to bed. And at 6:00 in the morning, I was\nwoken and told that the Germany invaded Russia and they're going to be in our town any\nday, the German army, and we have to leave because that may save our lives. So we had\na horse and wagon. My father...uh...got it all together and we packed some of our\nbelongings and took all...took my ...well, my whole family which consisted of my\nbrother, my mother and my father and also my grandfather from my mother's side. And\nwe just started toward Russia. Uh...We...I don't remember exactly how long it took us...a\nday or so to get to a small town. I believe that town was where my father was born and I\nthink it was named...I'm not really very sure. And that is when the Germans met us and\nthe border was closed, and there was no need to go any further. So we walked into the\nfirst abandoned home we found, probably was a Jewish home, other people who ran\naway, and we decided to stay overnight and see what happens the next day. And in the\nmeantime, I remember...uh...a few hours later, we heard some knocks on the doors,\nvicious knocks...uh...by the Germans and they were looking for Jewish people I believe.\nThey were yelling there were any Jews hiding here and naturally, we admitted that we\nwere Jewish. So I remember they were kind of...a little vulgar and then they\nasked...uh...what time it was. One incident, and my brother kind of being proud of his Bar\nMitzvah watch showed...showed him the watch and told him what time it was. They\nsaid, \"Well, give me that watch immediately.\" And my brother kind of resisted, so when\nthe Germans start pulling up his rifle, my mother went over grabbed his watch...grabbed\nmy brother's watch and just handed it over real fast. And this was our first introduction to\nthe German army Then the next day, I believe, we saw that there was no use to hang\naround. There was no use to stay in that little town. We still had our horse, our wagon\nand some of our belongings and we headed back home back to Panemon, through Kovno.\nOn the road, they had....some Lithuanian army, I believe it was, had set up a place where\nthey intercepted all the refugees who had tried to leave and tried and kept them...stopped\nall of us and told us to move over to that particular, big huge place it was on the road.\nAnd they just kept us there for no reason at all. We...we spent a few nights there I believe\noutside on the ground, sky. It wasn't too bad. It wasn't cold...cold. It was summertime.\nAnd no...no one knew what the future's going to bring. But after that I remembert...I\nbelieve that they took us to the Seventh or drove us to the Seventh the whole family.\nExactly I don't remember how it happened, but I remember that our next stop was the\nSeventh Fort in Lithuanian.",
        "Q: Tell us about the Seventh Fort.",
        "A: Well, the Seventh port was, I believe, an army base before the war. It may have been\nsome kind of a military defense area or something like that, but 1t was pretty\ngreen...pretty and they separated immediately the men and the women. Uh...I remember\nthat my brother was 7 years older than I was, and when my grandfather went with my\nfather on my one side, and my mother and I...they took us in another area of the Seventh\nFort. I was 11 years old at that time. And we spent...and we spent...the exact amount of\ndays...I don't remember how many days we spent there, but I... remember that right\nbefore they took us to the Ninth Fort, and the Ninth Fort was a similar place as the\nSeventh Fort in Lithuania, they had given them an order to some of the\nyounger...uh...younger people who were with the meant to...to go to the women's side,\nand I...someone told you...that I think the order was that all the children up to about 15 or\n16 could go to the women's side and my brother tried to go over. I don't know, he\nprobably thought maybe it is safer and my father may have told him to do\n60.And...uh...they didn't let him through because they said he looked older. Actually, he\nwas 18. And he looked older, and they didn't let him in...let him go to...to...uh...his\nmother. And...and right after that we heard and knew that everyone was shot over there.\nAll the men were shot, but my father was not there. This is another long story. My father\nwas a volunteer in the Lithuanian army. I believe when Lithuania in 1916 or something\nlike that, he volunteered in the Lithuanian army to defend the...the country. And while\nLithuania was independent between 1916 and I believe1940, these volunteers took a in\ncertain prominent Close Lithuanian life. They were ...and they were honored many times.\nMy father had medals of it, and we were pretty proud of it. Uh...So before they told all\nthe youngsters or after to go to another side, to the women's side, they also announced\nthat everyone who was...they called themselves and those are volunteers. Every man who\nwas a volunteer in the Lithuanian army to present themselves to the Lithuanian...uh.,\nsoldiers who probably did the massacre afterwards, and that they would take them out of\nthere. And indeed, they did. They took them to a different place, which was called\nthe...the Yellow Prison. They called it the Yellow Prison in Kovno. And I know that my\nfather was there. So at that time my father was not shot. It was only my brother and my\ngrandfather. Then the...and....uh...my father was...uh...in that prison I remember. And\nlater on when we were released from the Ninth Fort, after being there...uh...and...uh...my\nfather came home one day and...uh...he...we asked him how he did that. He was in prison.\nAnd he said he had promised the guard officers uniform and boots if he would let him go\nto see his family. He said, \"Well, I'll let you go, but you better be back.\" And my father\ncame to visit us. He spent a few hours with us and my mother begged him, I remember\nthat. She begged him not to go back because it's not going to be there very good place.\nWe knew about that. And...uh...he did go back, and...uh...they were shot over there also.\nThey were shot. We heard all kinds of stories. Who knows why? But, we really don't\nknow why. We really hoped and thought that being...being Xo the volunteers they were\nand respected before the war, the Lithuanian army who really directed most of\nthese...uh...I don't know how to call it...uh...would...would really let them free, but\nthey didn't. Uh...well, after...after this, we...uh...went to the ghetto. They...when the\norders came, they told the Jews have to leave their towns...their towns and homes and\nbelongings. Well, not all the belongings, but...uh...that you couldn't take with you and\nmove to that designated area around Kovno which was called the ghetto. And my mother\nand I...we just took the things that we had. Couldn't...tried to exchange our home with\nsome Lithuanians, but I guess we just were not successful. Some people did. Some\npeople gave up big mansions for little homes, and...uh...they moved in there, but there\nwas not enough room for everyone so they...people who had those homes took in their\nfamilies, their friends, whoever needed it, and we were sharing. I and my mother, we\nshared a room with a neighbor of ours who...uh...was...we were close before the war\nand...uh...that lady had also lost her son and her husband, and her daughter, who was my\nbrother's age and I think they were friends...uh...had a room that they acquired somehow\nfrom some relatives or friends in one of those houses, and they took us in and we...shared\none room, the four of us.",
        "Q: Can you...can you go back. You had told me before that while your father was in prison\nyour mother had taken his papers and tried to do something?",
        "A: Yes. Well...well, my mother always cherished papers, a being the, that volunteers...and\nhis medals. And that was...we tell that was a precious thing because most of the...most of\nour encounter all the misfortunes that we had until then were always caused by\nLithuanian soldiers. And we didn't see that many Germans around at the beginning. I'm\nsure they gave all the orders. They were involved. But I we didn't see them. So we\nfelt...she felt especially that those papers and medals may come in handy someday. She\nalways kept them on her. Uh...Well...there's so much to talk about...",
        "Q: You had gone ahead and you are in the ghetto now?",
        "A: Yes, I'm in the ghetto now. But...uh...there was another incident that if I may I should\nback up a little but that's always stuck with me too is when...when the Russians came in,\nalthough we were not in great shape financially either, but my father since he was a\nvolunteer and he was in the army, he kind of had respect for some...for the Lithuanian\nArmy...for the Lithuanian army before the war. And he was friendly with\nsome...uh...people in high command. And he find out where we lived there a general who\nwas I think the Chief of Staff of the Lithuanian army and when the Russians came in they\nsent him to Siberia. And...and he had left his wife and children in our town, and my\nfather knew them. And I remember that whenever he could, he used to take some\npackages over there or even lumber to heat the homes because in Lithuania most of the\nhomes were heated by lumber, good lumber. And he...he was quite friendly with them\nand tried to help that particular year. And right after the Germans occupied Lithuania\nright before the ghetto, we were sitting in this lady's house, Mrs. Mudrick was her name,\nand...uh...just talking about the future in the ghetto and things like that, where we're going\nto move homes or whatever and I.... looked through the window. It, it was about two\nhouses away from ours in Panemon, and I looked through the window and here was the\nGeneral walking with his wife and was going back to their home in the...on the... They\nlived...they had a home in the outskirts of Panemon. And I kind of felt a great feeling\nbecause I felt this is one man who probably could help release my father from that\nYellow prison that he was in. And I pointed her out to my mother, \"Look who's walking\nby here. Why don't you go out and talk to him really quickly. I'm sure he knows us.\nEspecially...she knows us, and maybe they can do something,\" my mother went out real\nquick. I was with her and I remember that for a minute they acted like...like...they didn't\neven know us or pretended anyway. And...uh...she told them who we were and they\nnodded and she begged them to see if they\u2019Il...can do something about releasing my\nfather. But needless to t say, nothing happened. That is one incident that stayed with me.\nUh...Alright, I guess now the next thing is the ghetto.",
        "Q: Tell us again which ghetto you were in and how did you get there?",
        "A: Well, from what I remember it was quite simple. We just walked or...or took a bus or\nsomething. I really don't remember exactly how we got there. Maybe on a wagon? No, I\ncannot. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I know that we were there in 1941, and I was11 years\nold with my mother and she had arranged to live in that room with Mrs. Widrick and her\ndaughter, Rita.",
        "Q: You are not in Kaunas. You are in Kovno.",
        "A: Well, Kaunas and Kovno is the same thing. Kaunas is in Lithuania. Uh, well, from the\nbeginning, I remember there was Aktions. They called for 500 people, and they called\nfour thousand people to work, and they called for all kinds of things. And some came\nback, some people didn't come back, but those things did...did not affect me personally\nbecause, as I said, you know, being young, you...you don't understand a lot of things. I\n12 know...my...my mother used to go to work every day in a brigade. I don't remember\nexactly what she was doing and, but then we tried...we tried our best to survive.",
        "Q: Did you see any of the roundups?",
        "A: Uh...Not, not exactly. I seen alot of roundups. I seena lot of brigades going in and\nout, but...uh...there | weren't...[ could not distinguish between the ones who went and\ncame back and the ones who went and didn't come back. Uh _ I was a go-for when I was\nabout 12, 13 years old, I became a go-for for the administration in the ghetto.. .running\naround with papers, back and forth to offices...And...uh...I thought maybe...I really don't\nremember what I was thinking. I...I was just doing what I was told to do,\nAfter...and...and that's it. When I was about 14 I believe, I started to work in a...in a\nclay factory where weQ 5 * 2 used to manufacture pottery, clay...out of clay. And that\nfactory was run by afamily of generations of...of pottery makers, and they were very\nexperienced and dida very beautiful job.;5 ft",
        "Q: Okay. Let's just pause. We need to change tapes.AtZ < e Xtal",
        "Q: Tell us about your >**ning.- < > Qvlve I t(a ew13",
        "A: Well...uh...so, I was doing some running for that place, \u2014 running around, delivering to\nthe pottery, and also trying to help out with the clay, kneading clay and so on and so\nt forth. A avery important uh part of my life happened in that factory. When I\nworked there, I'm sure that's whenX the... F st of the people know about the children's\naktionSwhich was the selection of the young children whomthey...they picked out from\nthe ghetto and took to the Ninthb ffi rt and killed them all over there.\nAs...as...uh...weheard, I was...the day they hAd that selection, I was at thepottery, at the\nceramic factory. And I guess the boss orthe leader of that factory had heard that there's\nata selection...they're rounding up all the children. Well, hewas kind of concerned about\nme...uh...and he said, \"Well, wegonna...since they're rounding up children we're going\nto;:ao put you to work and make you look important. So let's seeif...what we can do about\nit.\" I don't know...I don't knowif I understood what was happening, what our destiny\nwas, but he all of a sudden put me next to his old uncle who wast 9 @t the best pottery\nmaker, a real artist, and he put me rightnext to him to knead...knead the clay to prepare\nthe clay ..for him to put on that machine and he was making the pots and vases and things\nlikethat. And I remember two~3 ;6tUkrainian soldiers walked in. They looked around.\nThey didn't see any children untilthey spotted me. And they walked up to me and they\nsaid, \"How old are you?\" And 1 14 believe I said, \"I was about 14.\" Maybe I was 15.\nMaybe I was 14.\" And onesaid to me, \"Come with us.\" Wellt Ir3 ;au didn't move that fast.\nI just kept on working, and the other one looked at me andsaid, \"Aw, let him stay.\" \"Oh\nno.\" \"Let him go. Let him go. Come on. Come on.\" AndWz Ssthen the...the boss, Ske\nname 1~ Nicholas, and he intervened o and said, \"Well, this is a real good worker\nand we need him here. n And he said, \"Okay, let's leave him here. wJ And the\nsecond one insisted that I stay, and they walked away and_ tt _ this is how I remained\nthat timt and uh_ this was an0 4 60important...uh...event, that clay factory. I think\nstayed in the clay factory untilthe evacuation to the concentration camps in Germany. But\nI think before that...beforethe clay factory, we had a very importantO<ab Aktion...an\nincident happened. And that was what they called the big Aktion, thebig selection where\nthis particular day the German commandant selected 10,000 peopleO4 4b and they were\nall exterminated in one day in the Ninth Kort. And this is quite a story.Uh...They told us\nto present ourselves at 6:00 in the morning at a certain place intheghetto. The\nwhole...everyone...whoever would stay behind ..O $ tt would be shot, and naturally\neverybody showed up. They...they put everybody in thegates...and some type of Jewish\npolice and...uh...and the leaders of the ghetto triedto keep some kind of order, so as to try\nto present us in Io S ;=b guess a better light, and so not to upset the Germans, you 15\nknow, when...when we walked in front of them. I remember walking up in front of\nthe German Gestapo men with my mother loxclt 06 s~\\l. and he asked my\nmother questions, says , \"No men?\" And my mother said, \"No.\" And he says,\nWell, he pointed to the right. And as he pointed to the right, log 61D knew right\nthen and there that was death. That was the end of us. And...uh...1 remember we\nstarted crying and we _ started worrying. And...uh...my mother told me in the\nconvoys, \"Don't worry. We'll be back. We r re not going toU D go anywhere.\" And I\nthought she's really out of her mind. And...uh..~because that wasunheard of. Once they\ndecided something, there's no coming back. And...uh...she toldme,# MM she said...we\nhad...we had a friend...and this is another story. We had a friend,Lithuanian, before the\nwar who was a German-Jew, a refugee from Germany. And he usedto come over to our\nhouse and be friendly with us, with my parents. And he in 1940,was = out by the\nRussians as a O8 ; 4 olitical prisoner. He escaped, came back toLithuanian, and had some\npapers as if..1f he was some political prisoner and againstcommunism. And he was in\nghetto. We knew that.o7 aO We used to see him. And she told me, \"We're going to meet\nhim on this side, andtogether with his papers and our papers, we're going to come back.\"\nMy father'smedals...what I was talking about. \"We're going to come back.\" And again,\n[...Ididn't.... didn't know whatto a _ think. I thought my mother had lost her sind right\nthere. 4:rS; oF ll \\ tt~1~IL h. To find him on the wrong side since he was,\npoFtiswbartywas I think a single person. I don't think he had his familyO g a anymore.\nWell, to shorten it, they took us down about, oh, 50 yards or 100 yards ina different place\nafter we were selected on the right side which was the wrong sideand...uh...they were\nwaiting for more people to come and when they had a certainamount...on that side they\nusedot:2~ to...they took us into the little ghetto. And that 1s different...altogetherdifferent\nstory about the little ghetto. Well, as we were standing there and waitingto be taken to the\nlittle ghetto, I spotted that man standingt Mabout 10 yards from us and said to my mother,\n\"Here he is just like you 8aid.\" And shesays, \"Run over to him and tell him to come over\nand stay with us.\" And I did. Andhe kind of worked his way to us. My mother asked him,\n\"How did you get over here?\" Well, I tried to save a lot of people,O 9'6~ children,\nand...and the commandant wouldn't even listen to me. He just put us on thewrong side\nand here we are.\" And he was just as scared and just as weak as I was.My motherW)S\n4t\u00abOq Lao said, \"Let's stay together. Wsw'ra going with UL,J~ Well, we went to the\nlittleghetto which was empty, which was...which was exterminated before and as we\ncamethere...uh...there...uh...10,000 people were there at night.t5,+t Ten thourand people\nwere selected. And some thought that they may just separate usfrom the big ghetto and let\nus stay there and maybe live or do other things. Sosone __17 people tried to get their\nhomes and get some beds to be ableD 9 to sleep on or whatever was left from the people\nwho were there before. And my mothersaid, \"We're not looking for no houses. We are\nnot going to look for any furniture.We don't need anything. We want to come back to the\nghetto. n\u00a2: ao Because she doesntt like the situation here. So as she saidwe picked one\nhouse right...right by the gate. [remember  \\>;\u00abd~S ~ that we found some berrivie\nroom and there was an oldmattress...mattress on which Mr. h was his name, Mr. R*6tu~\nand I laid down and sleptand my mother sat in aqD lounge chair all night long and I thin\nS tt8>, M# ,r Jke aOlr something. And everytime I woke up I could see her sitting, not\nsleeping at all. At 6:00 in the morning,5:00,X1~O-D 6:00 in the morning, we heard bang\ng r~yelling, screaming, insults, dragging people. We ran out and we saw already\nsome...uh...rows of humanity being taken I thlnk in theX1 aj) direction of the Ninth Fort\nwhich we knew...which street led to the Ninth Fort. Andas we were in the line in front,\nalmost by the gate, my mother decided, she said,\"Well, now _ ttr. X h we're going to try\nto come back.\" She said, \"Ba , give/{ 4t me your papers.\" And she took the medals and\nmy father's .. paper and she ran up to oneLithuanian officer and told him that...pretended\nthat Mr. Raston was her husband andsaid that he was a political prisoner, that he was a, a\nvolunteer before the war,that he did some good things forXD Lithuania\u00ab, and would he\nhelp us in...1n sending us back to 18 the big ghetto. Well, one...one said, \"Well, don't\nworry wherever you'regoing you're going to be working. You're...you're just going to\nchange places. Itwon't be/; ; UD much different.\" And she went to another one. Another\none wouldn't even listen toher. The third one said I could not do anything about it, until\nMr. iesCcn and I kindof gave up and told herl \"Let's...let's go where everyone else goes.\"\n/; And uh - she said, \"One more.\" She saw _ she spotted thislieutenant, Lithuanian\nlieutenant, and she walked up to himand she kind of with her last breath tried to explain\nthe} 3 ' 6M situation. And he said to her, \"Look, I cannot do anything about it, but...but\ntheGerman commandant is going to come over in a few minutes and rsached...he took us\nandhe put us on the sidewalk, rather than in the streets. And he said, ~You stay here\nandwhen the German commandant comes, we're going to present to him these papers and\nseewhat he can do} 3 aU3 about it.\" And that felt very tood at that moment except that\nabout a minute later,some soldier walked up, Lithuanian soldier, and he saw us standing\non...on thesidewalk, not where everyone else was standing. And he had, 3: q O a club in\nhis hand and without any question he smacked Mr. ..9*6ten on his ear and split his ear\nand...uh...my mother on her back, black and bluemarks on her back, and told us to get\nback in the row with all the other people. Atthat time # ffi that officer noticed it and he\ncame over and he said to him, \"Look, Itold them to stay here and I want them to stay here\n19 and don't touch them.\" A minute later the German appeared, the Germancommandant.\nAnd the way it was situated was like/ 4 ag3 this. The gate of the small ghetto was the end\nof one street. The whole thinghappened...the way it happened was like a interception\nfrom which four or fivestreets...streets branched out. The German commandant wastX 40\nstanding in the middle of the interception. The gate was on one street. About 90degrees\nof that gate was the fence of the big ghetto from which we had come. No gate.3ust barbed\nwire fence with German guards and the Jewish policea ff n an the other side of it,\npretending to watch what'shappening or to guard or whatever they were doing there. a\u00bba\nXs___ Probably seeing what was happening. knothes German was J b SLt standing\nthere,the lieutenant ran over quickly, took the medal the papers, and walked over to\ntheGerman commandant and he talked to hiw. What he said I don't know, but I heard\ntheGerman yell, \"Where are those Jews? Where are those Jews?\" So he ran...he came\noverquickly and got us and...uh...my mother walked up to him quickly and told...ff 40\nrepeated her story, and he said, \"Back in the ghetto.\" And we could see...before I gotto\nthe fence, I could see the 3ewish police...there was no entrance, but the Jewishpolice16;\n65r who were on the other side tore the barbed wire with their hands and their feet,tore\napart...made a hole, and we just crawled back in. And...uh...that day 10,000people\ndied.sUD One of the nen who vent was a cousin who we really hadn't 20 seen, but we\nlearned afterwards that she was there. And...uh...this is, Iguess, how we survived that\none.g q p But...uh...it just worked out exactly the same way my mother ~1,8,~8 zr ~\npredicted. - ~ . Probably one in a million. From what I understand is thatthere may have\nbeen a few othersIn C~) who hid in attics or some other places that day instead of going\nto the Ninth Fort,and I think when somebody told me afterwards...when the Jewish police\nand the firemencame 1 10 check they found some people hidden and later got them out of\nthere. Theybrought over uniforms and they dressed n a>Dthem up as policemen and they\njust gotthem back in.I FaP S>ftdon't think there was very many, but I know\nthat...uh...thatAo* WenQwe came back, we were the only ones.O",
        "Q: Where did you go? What happened to you?",
        "A: Well, we went back to our place, to our...where we lived in the ghetto and we\ncontinuedthe ghetto life and actually the =Ats ktt 8 e atD children's aktion\nand...uh...was after...after tWz nd they would go outcontinue living in the ghetto until the\nevacuation.",
        "Q: And did you see the children? The children aktion that you had described earlier? > =}\nD",
        "A: Yes. And uh the ghetto kept on shrinking all the time,21 less and less people.\nAnd even the area was reduced and I believe in 44 when the Russian army got\ncloser to Lithuania, X for sone reason and just evacuated us and took us to\ntheconcentration camp.

We played there among ours Qlvesand...uh...and\n..uh...as a matter of fact, I had a good friend who was the captain of our team.

Uh...Otherwise I really don't remember too much. It was>;L ~nb just routine every\nday. I remember one incident when my mother went to work and she took me with...with\nher because she got a chance to go to home ~ in Panemon because the brigade was\nworking there for...I don't know who...theQ; g D military or somebody.

        "A: Prom what I remember was this. There were no schools inthe \u2014 school in the ghetto. If\nthere were any, I didn't know about it. Uh... We had some friends as I said who came\nfrom...who also were German-Jewish refugees who came to live \u2014 ol; 1 in Panemon and\nmy parents became friends of theirs. And they were religious people, very religious\npeople, and...uh...tbere were all the Jewish traditions andso Ol~qO forth. They\nalso made it to the ghetto. And remember when I was about 12, 12 and a half, my\nmother...uh...said that this gentleman...I forgot his name...would teach me the\nSa orah and everything that one needs to know to havea Bar o Mitzvah.

I\nwas maybe 12, 13 watching through a window because...uh...they had him $4; a pistol or\nsomething.

        "Q: What happened then? Do you remember? 90",
        "A: Well, when...when they evacuated us. We were one of the last ones to be evacuated, to\nGermany, to the concentration camps. They took us 1n a train. We traveled to Germany. I\ndon't know. I don't remember how long it was. But I remember coming to Stutthof and\nuh and they separated the women from the men and...uh...kept the women in the\nStuffhof camp someplace around Stutthof and the men they took to Landsberg.\nLandsberg was a...was the first stop in t Germany. That was a concentration camp.\nA small one I believe not far from Munich and not far from Dachau. And I\nremember being separated with my mother already and I justO G qocontinued with the\ntrains to deeper into Germany. And that is the last time I heard of my mother until\nafter the war. I had some people who were with her and told me that she \u2014_ died in the\nlast days of the war. The exact details they | O5 CDnever told me, but...uh...probably\nfor some reason probably 27 not to upset me or other things, but the exact way I\ndon't know, but I know she...she died in the last days. And...uh...I came to Landsberg, and\nthere were a lot of men, young men and older men. And we stayed there not too long, and\nthey ordered all the children up to 17 years old to q O assemble and...uh...and they took\nus away. They took us away to...to Dachau. We were about 131 I believe, and we stayed\nin Dachau for 1 week and then they shipped us out to Birkenau, Auschwitz, Birkenau.\nAnd...uh...when we came to Birkenau....",
        "Q: Tell us about that ride.Ot",
        "A: Well, the ride to Birkenau. We were...we were put in three \u2014 wagons, three railroad\nwagons, train wagons, 131 ofusand D we we were stopping someplace. The only\nthing I really remember from that ride is that we came to a place in a train station where\nsome Russian prisoners were able to walkup to our train and there were some port holes\nin our cattleOg # 513 trains and warned US to see and try to...try to escape if we could\nbecause...uh...they said if you are Jewish and youare.. going to Auschwitz or\nBirkenau, that's where they kill them Oq \u00bb D all. So if you have a chance, just run away.\nAnd some of us couldn't . And it...it took quite a while to get there. And one incident I\nremember was that since we>q # O were all Lithuanian children that none of us spoke\nPolish so _\u2014_28 to try to escape was useless or we wouldn't know to talk or how to talk.\nButin my...1n my wagon, there were two boys who did speak Polish, a little or a lot I don't\nknow. I knew they knew something about it. And they told us that a they were going to\njump and escape. Now, we hada big _\u2014_ dilemma because if they escaped and we knew\nfrom the ghetto Ib Qdif one did anything wrong, all of us would be done. So we\nhad a plan made up with them thst they...we would try __ to...there were two older\nGerman guards in that train,and we would try to distract them to try...there were\nmaybe 60 qOofus or 50 of US on that train, and we would try...there = was\nonly...the was only made of about we were maybe about 5 or 10 kids involved in that.\nAnd...uh...we said like this, that they're going to go through that port hole, \u2014_tnD try to\nclimb down the step of the train and stay there for awhile until maybe the moment that\nthe train slows down a little bit...I believe the train was going about maybe 40 miles an\nhour, 50 miles an hour, and when the train slow down and maybe in a brushy area where\nit would be softer...softer to land, they would try to jump. And to protect us because out\nof 50 kids someone had to see that they were jumping out and not to tell the Germans that\nwould have been the end of every one of us. So we decided with them that they're going\nto jump and in about a couple of hours later, we would pretend...we would be\nabout...and...100 miles away...120 miles away from that area...a couple of hours later, we\nwould pretend that we just saw the kids jump, and we would tell the German guards that\nhere two kids have jumped out and here they are. They're laying right here watching us.\nAnd...uh...maybe that would save us and...uh...1n the meantime, Seli thit w%l;;D-,\nthey wouldn't...they wouldn't even look for them that far away and...uh...maybe they\nwould. So we did itZ; q D that way. We...we took four...four of us, starting talking to the\nGermans. They were kind of older and they were not from the SS. They were from the\nWehrmacht, so...so you could speak to them once in awhile. They would...I remember\nsomeone was talking to them about knives, about other/3 61) things. I don't remember the\nconversation. About we were watching the homes or the greenery while the train was\ngoing by. We just talked to them and kept them busy. And all of a sudden, like we said,\nabout two hours later, one kid ran up to us and started to pretend that he's telling me a?\nbao secret~ And they got excited and they asked whatts happened. We said, \"Go look\nquick. Quick. Through that window, the port hole, two kids just jumped out.\" First, they\ndidn't believe it and then they kinda looked and then3 AO they said, \"Well, it took you\ntoo long. They were right there.\" And thirdly, they started to call the officer somehow\nand made some signs that we should stop the train reco+Mblc and to recount them\nbecause if they took them to , we/ # 61D were missing. Now that took a little while. And\nthey30stopped the train. They took us all out and they counted us three times, and two\nwere missing. SO they...they asked us, Where did it happened. And they said, \"About five\nminutes# dD ago, they all jumped out, and we reported it, we saw it.\"And okay, from\nwhat I understand they did call the localpolice in that town, but that may have had been\n10towns...those kids were about 10 towns behind us...andthey...they were looking for\nthem. What happened? We don'tknow. But from what I heard lately, I think one...ne of/4\n4O them did survive. Someone told me a story that one kid whenthey were transported\nfrom...uh...from...uh...we were goingto Buchenwald to Birkenau jumped the train. One of\ntheLithuanian kids jumped the train, and he's somewhere iny 5 ; > Israel right now. And\nI'm trying to see if we can makecontact and meet him. And...uh...that I learned recently\nayear...maybe a few months ago. So we then we came toAuschwitz,- Birkenau. We were\nled in. We were kept for3 about 3 days in quarantine, and we didn't know why in\nabarrack with straw, not even a shower. Very little food.And we could see a lot of\nconcerned inmates, old timers whoused to come in and out, in and out, talk to us, and ask\nusZ S qt questions. And we found out...out later, the reason westayed there about four\ndays before letting us into thecamps is because this is the first transport of children\nwhowere let into Birkenau alive. There were some childrenyC CnD before who came\nwith their father or families. WhenI say 31 children, 13, 14, 15. And we were the\nfirst...1t was late in the war andthings had started to change a little bit. So what happened,\nwe don't really know.But they told us U aO later that...uh...they were very surprised and\nhappy that wewere the first ones let in, and we were in quarantine ini \u2014_a...in a camp\nwhich was called A-lager, A-lager. WciL~ we /6 gO didn't doanything from...just looked\nfor food. Try see what...uh...we could do.b...That's allwe thought about. There were hot\ndays and cold days and all kinds of days.J7;6t And I remember after quarantiner they\ntook us to a children's barrack in the...theD-Lager, which was a working lager, working\ncamp. They were a lot of kommandos,people who used to go to work every day and come\nback. And we had those appells whereyou had to get up early in the morning, stand in\nthat place being counted day andnight, twice a day to make sure that everyone of US was\nthere. And at the beginning! didn't do anything there either. There was notn 4 D too much\nwork for us, I believe. But there was one brigade that used to...that usedto come out of\nthis barrack. And they were some children whopushed...uh...some...they called q K it a\nroll wagon....1t looked like a...like abuggy or like a horse and buggy, without a horse and\niVet collected garbage in someplaces in the camps and the crematoriums and things like\nthat. That was not a bad jObcause when you u6ed to gol t aUDto some of those places\nand being a child or young men, you used to meet some womenand older people who\nused to give 32d.%you some_ share withatheir rations or bread or whatever they v\nhad. But...uh...that was hard to 4 ve into until one day, I%;~ O remember it was pouring\nrain, mud to your knees, and you hadto go and push that wagon. Well, some of the kids\nwho wereworking there before kind of hid or didn't show up,/ 4 t6D and...uh...half way\nvolunteering and half way being picked Igot into that job. And as I said before, many\ndays thathelped me because people used to hand Fe some things, foodand things like to\neat, which was the most important thing/ 5 ;O in that time. We stayed there not very long,\nmaybe a fewmonths. The...the crematorium had quiet2 down...quietedD down from what\nI understand. They...they didn't exterminatepeople in those days as much as they did in\nthe earlier daysuntil one day we woke up and we did see all kind of flamesgoing through\nthose chimneys and we knew that's what's goingon. We knew that they were burning\npeople over there, but\u00bb 5 that day they...someone told us...I don't know how therumors\nstarted. They had rounded up about 3,000gypsies...gypsies and just took them to the\ncrematorium andjust gassed them and burned them like they did...they did\u00bbD Q O the\nJewish people. And that was...uh...kind of scared. __..Needless to say, also...now it's\ncoming back to me...uh.. Hthose A and D lagers, we were...we were...there were \u00bb\n~ QO selections too. I almost forgot about those.9eday we 4. were onthe\nappellSplaNK where we were supposed to stand every morning and evening and\nth- Ke--an KO ~n~aNt KdR- b33 and he looked over. We...I was in a children's\nbarrack anda | ;n he looked us over, and...uh...I think that was before thatGypsy incident\nand he looked us over. He asked us our ages.And...uh...1 remember I think I was about 14\nat that...atthat time, and ...uh...the kid next to me, he asked him hisa I aD age, and he told\nthem 14. THet marked down his number.Uh...I had felt that was not a good sign, so when\nhe walkedup to me, I told him I was 15. I tried to lie about a year.D He looked at me\ntwice and just walked by me. Well, thatafternoon they came to pick up all the kids\nwho[*...whosenumber they had written down. I never heard fromthem @ _ = againg\nUh Another incident, also in Birkenau. Sne dayWa a. n they showed up with a measuring\ninstrument, measuring device 7 likea  asquare. And we had to walk under it. And\nIremember you never knew whether to be tall is better or tobe short is better or to older or\nto be younger. You neveraw R O knew. There was a lot of deception, a lot of lies,\nandconfused us completely. And this I think, also, wasa; Q D instrumental 1n..in some of\nus not being as resistant as weshould have been because we were completely lied\nto,deceived and mishandled and by the time some of us woke up, .. Q_ it was\nalmost too late. This measuring device I remember walking through it and I\nbarely touched that bar-SSacross and my number was not taken that da H Some\nof the shorter =* ones I remember was taken. But you really never knew what\nS was the right wayX They had you confused completelyg And 34 after that...I\nbelieve after Birkenau, we went...they evacuated us or theytook us out to...uh...what they\ncalled...we went to Auschwitz for one day, and theydid...and then Auschwitz, that was\nthe big concentration;3 %~ camp near Birkenau. And then they took us to which was\ncalled farm. And that farm wascalled _ Birkenau again. There were different names. They\nseparated a lot of us, andI wound up in that ofaq~ y Birkenau where I was very sick. Had\npneumonia and stayed in...there was aHungarian-Jewish doctor took care of the little\nhospital. He had a few bedsand...uh...he took care of me with some medicines. I\nwas there for quitea few |X weeks I remember and just barely got better or well by\nthe time they took us to Buchenwald. And that was quite aa 4 q O march. Also\n[...another incident happened. I forgot to tAo94(Otalk about that one...in Birkenau\nwhen we got the needles.w _\u2014_\u2014 I don't know, 5, 10 of us got the neelles and we were just a\nG (tlaying in whatthey call a hospital and the main doctor who took care of us was a\nFrench-Jewishdoctor. He was extremely kind, understanding and tried to help us. Matter\n;ao offact, he saved our lives there. I remember before ..evacuation day, we had to be sick\nabout 21 days in order to be declared notcontagious and...uh...[ think that day we _ ;\nwere about 17 days in the hospital and we remember himrunning back and forth trying to\ndoctor all kinds of peoplein charge and what we remember, he signed something or 35\ndeclared us well enough, we were not...we were not contagious anymore. Itwas touch and\ngo until he was ableX 1D to declare us not contagious and...and they were able to\nevacuate us with everyoneelse. In that of Birkenau ....(Pause) we were...we were most of\nus were working atW +\u00a2r on;6 6 Z S the tincv I don't remember. I didn't work at the time.\nWhen I was there, I was sickand I didn't do too much.aL q O And...uh...1f not for that\nHungarian doctor, I wouldn't have survived there either.Because I must have been well\nenough to make that long trip to Buchenwald. Wewere...we were(b about 6 days I believe\nand 6 nights. We were walking for many, many, many days...formany hours and I think\nat night we stopped just for a little sleep a few hours. Andthen I think we were on trains.\nThey put us on trains right before9D we got to Buchenwald. And it was wintertime and it\nwas open wagons and you...wegot...uh...one of my eyes was very infected and...uh...I\nlived with that throughBuchenwalda N qOmost of the time. Some days it was better,\nsome days it was worse. But I don't thinkthat I had any treatment for that. Uh...In\nBuchenwald we were again in a children'sbarrack, ina S n quarantine for 66. They\nbrought 66 I believe in the back of the camp. In that barrack,there were a lot of\nHungarians, Slovakians, German, Polish Jewish children and someof us, Lithuanians.\nAnd...uh...we didn't do any work because we; 3 were in quarantine.

        "Q: Ya. Tell us about that. Well, uh my father had to leave his business because uh you\ncouldn't be a businessman under the \u2014_ Russian regime, and he tried to get a job several\ntimes and had difficulties because he didn't belong to any party, and he was not involved\nin politics. And being...having been in business before the war, it was a little difficult to\nget a job. So we kind of struggled through that year, but it wasn't too bad. We made tt.\nAnd...uh...and then in 41,when the Germans took over, that's when all Hell broke loose,\nso to speak. Uh...First of all, I remember like it was yesterday. It was on a Sunday\nmorning. And I had sat up until 4:00 in the morning making some names for my...for\nmy...for the uniforms of my basketball team. I was about 14years and I was...at 4:00 in\nthe morning when I was extremely tired I went to bed. And at 6:00 in the morning, I was\nwoken and told that the Germany invaded Russia and they're going to be in our town any\nday, the German army, and we have to leave because that may save our lives. So we had\na horse and wagon. My father...uh...got it all together and we packed some of our\nbelongings and took all...took my ...well, my whole family which consisted of my\nbrother, my mother and my father and also my grandfather from my mother's side. And\nwe just started toward Russia. Uh...We...I don't remember exactly how long it took us...a\nday or so to get to a small town. I believe that town was where my father was born and I\nthink it was named...I'm not really very sure. And that is when the Germans met us and\nthe border was closed, and there was no need to go any further. So we walked into the\nfirst abandoned home we found, probably was a Jewish home, other people who ran\naway, and we decided to stay overnight and see what happens the next day. And in the\nmeantime, I remember...uh...a few hours later, we heard some knocks on the doors,\nvicious knocks...uh...by the Germans and they were looking for Jewish people I believe.\nThey were yelling there were any Jews hiding here and naturally, we admitted that we\nwere Jewish. So I remember they were kind of...a little vulgar and then they\nasked...uh...what time it was. One incident, and my brother kind of being proud of his Bar\nMitzvah watch showed...showed him the watch and told him what time it was. They\nsaid, \"Well, give me that watch immediately.\" And my brother kind of resisted, so when\nthe Germans start pulling up his rifle, my mother went over grabbed his watch...grabbed\nmy brother's watch and just handed it over real fast. And this was our first introduction to\nthe German army Then the next day, I believe, we saw that there was no use to hang\naround. There was no use to stay in that little town. We still had our horse, our wagon\nand some of our belongings and we headed back home back to Panemon, through Kovno.\nOn the road, they had....some Lithuanian army, I believe it was, had set up a place where\nthey intercepted all the refugees who had tried to leave and tried and kept them...stopped\nall of us and told us to move over to that particular, big huge place it was on the road.\nAnd they just kept us there for no reason at all. We...we spent a few nights there I believe\noutside on the ground, sky. It wasn't too bad. It wasn't cold...cold. It was summertime.\nAnd no...no one knew what the future's going to bring. But after that I remembert...I\nbelieve that they took us to the Seventh or drove us to the Seventh the whole family.\nExactly I don't remember how it happened, but I remember that our next stop was the\nSeventh Fort in Lithuanian.",

        "A: My name is Ralph Codikow.",
        "A: I was born April 9th, 1930, in Kovno, Lithuania and lived in Panemon, Lithuania all my\nlife until I was 11 years old.",
        "A: Panemon is on the outskirts of Kovno.",
        "A: Well, we were an average family in Lithuania before the war and...uh...my father, mother\nand a brother. I had a brother who was 7 years older than I was. And my father was in the\n...lumber business and lived there with his father, grandfather that I know oflived in\nLithuania. Before that I don't know.",
        "A: Well, it was a pretty happy childhood. I went to eider when I was about 6 years old, then\nat 7 I went to Hebrew gymnasium which is a high schoot until about...until I was about\n10 years old. And then in 1940...",
        "A: Well, it was...1t was an average life. We had a...we lived in a nice town. Panemon was a\nsmall community. It consisted of one long street with a few alleys. And it was the\ngateway to which were...were summer homet3 B for the people who lived in Kovno.\nThey used to come over to spend their weekends in the woods and the forests where they\nhad built summer homes. Also was real close by and it was beautiful beach and we used\nto spend our weekends there and it was real nice before the war. And then in 1940, when\nthe Russians took over Lithuanta..*uh...we didn't have any more Hebrew schools and we\nhad to go to Yiddish schools and that's when we started g ~ learning Yiddish. I think\nHebrew was outlawed or something. And I studied there for 1 year in a different school\nuntil the Germans came in. And...well...uh...we could talk a little bit...uh...about that one\nyear.",
        "A: Well, the Seventh port was, I believe, an army base before the war. It may have been\nsome kind of a military defense area or something like that, but 1t was pretty\ngreen...pretty and they separated immediately the men and the women. Uh...I remember\nthat my brother was 7 years older than I was, and when my grandfather went with my\nfather on my one side, and my mother and I...they took us in another area of the Seventh\nFort. I was 11 years old at that time. And we spent...and we spent...the exact amount of\ndays...I don't remember how many days we spent there, but I... remember that right\nbefore they took us to the Ninth Fort, and the Ninth Fort was a similar place as the\nSeventh Fort in Lithuania, they had given them an order to some of the\nyounger...uh...younger people who were with the meant to...to go to the women's side,\nand I...someone told you...that I think the order was that all the children up to about 15 or\n16 could go to the women's side and my brother tried to go over. I don't know, he\nprobably thought maybe it is safer and my father may have told him to do\n60.And...uh...they didn't let him through because they said he looked older. Actually, he\nwas 18. And he looked older, and they didn't let him in...let him go to...to...uh...his\nmother. And...and right after that we heard and knew that everyone was shot over there.\nAll the men were shot, but my father was not there. This is another long story. My father\nwas a volunteer in the Lithuanian army. I believe when Lithuania in 1916 or something\nlike that, he volunteered in the Lithuanian army to defend the...the country. And while\nLithuania was independent between 1916 and I believe1940, these volunteers took a in\ncertain prominent Close Lithuanian life. They were ...and they were honored many times.\nMy father had medals of it, and we were pretty proud of it. Uh...So before they told all\nthe youngsters or after to go to another side, to the women's side, they also announced\nthat everyone who was...they called themselves and those are volunteers. Every man who\nwas a volunteer in the Lithuanian army to present themselves to the Lithuanian...uh.,\nsoldiers who probably did the massacre afterwards, and that they would take them out of\nthere. And indeed, they did. They took them to a different place, which was called\nthe...the Yellow Prison. They called it the Yellow Prison in Kovno. And I know that my\nfather was there. So at that time my father was not shot. It was only my brother and my\ngrandfather. Then the...and....uh...my father was...uh...in that prison I remember. And\nlater on when we were released from the Ninth Fort, after being there...uh...and...uh...my\nfather came home one day and...uh...he...we asked him how he did that. He was in prison.\nAnd he said he had promised the guard officers uniform and boots if he would let him go\nto see his family. He said, \"Well, I'll let you go, but you better be back.\" And my father\ncame to visit us. He spent a few hours with us and my mother begged him, I remember\nthat. She begged him not to go back because it's not going to be there very good place.\nWe knew about that. And...uh...he did go back, and...uh...they were shot over there also.\nThey were shot. We heard all kinds of stories. Who knows why? But, we really don't\nknow why. We really hoped and thought that being...being Xo the volunteers they were\nand respected before the war, the Lithuanian army who really directed most of\nthese...uh...I don't know how to call it...uh...would...would really let them free, but\nthey didn't. Uh...well, after...after this, we...uh...went to the ghetto. They...when the\norders came, they told the Jews have to leave their towns...their towns and homes and\nbelongings. Well, not all the belongings, but...uh...that you couldn't take with you and\nmove to that designated area around Kovno which was called the ghetto. And my mother\nand I...we just took the things that we had. Couldn't...tried to exchange our home with\nsome Lithuanians, but I guess we just were not successful. Some people did. Some\npeople gave up big mansions for little homes, and...uh...they moved in there, but there\nwas not enough room for everyone so they...people who had those homes took in their\nfamilies, their friends, whoever needed it, and we were sharing. I and my mother, we\nshared a room with a neighbor of ours who...uh...was...we were close before the war\nand...uh...that lady had also lost her son and her husband, and her daughter, who was my\nbrother's age and I think they were friends...uh...had a room that they acquired somehow\nfrom some relatives or friends in one of those houses, and they took us in and we...shared\none room, the four of us.",
        "A: Yes. Well...well, my mother always cherished papers, a being the, that volunteers...and\nhis medals. And that was...we tell that was a precious thing because most of the...most of\nour encounter all the misfortunes that we had until then were always caused by\nLithuanian soldiers. And we didn't see that many Germans around at the beginning. I'm\nsure they gave all the orders. They were involved. But I we didn't see them. So we\nfelt...she felt especially that those papers and medals may come in handy someday. She\nalways kept them on her. Uh...Well...there's so much to talk about...",
        "A: Yes, I'm in the ghetto now. But...uh...there was another incident that if I may I should\nback up a little but that's always stuck with me too is when...when the Russians came in,\nalthough we were not in great shape financially either, but my father since he was a\nvolunteer and he was in the army, he kind of had respect for some...for the Lithuanian\nArmy...for the Lithuanian army before the war. And he was friendly with\nsome...uh...people in high command. And he find out where we lived there a general who\nwas I think the Chief of Staff of the Lithuanian army and when the Russians came in they\nsent him to Siberia. And...and he had left his wife and children in our town, and my\nfather knew them. And I remember that whenever he could, he used to take some\npackages over there or even lumber to heat the homes because in Lithuania most of the\nhomes were heated by lumber, good lumber. And he...he was quite friendly with them\nand tried to help that particular year. And right after the Germans occupied Lithuania\nright before the ghetto, we were sitting in this lady's house, Mrs. Mudrick was her name,\nand...uh...just talking about the future in the ghetto and things like that, where we're going\nto move homes or whatever and I.... looked through the window. It, it was about two\nhouses away from ours in Panemon, and I looked through the window and here was the\nGeneral walking with his wife and was going back to their home in the...on the... They\nlived...they had a home in the outskirts of Panemon. And I kind of felt a great feeling\nbecause I felt this is one man who probably could help release my father from that\nYellow prison that he was in. And I pointed her out to my mother, \"Look who's walking\nby here. Why don't you go out and talk to him really quickly. I'm sure he knows us.\nEspecially...she knows us, and maybe they can do something,\" my mother went out real\nquick. I was with her and I remember that for a minute they acted like...like...they didn't\neven know us or pretended anyway. And...uh...she told them who we were and they\nnodded and she begged them to see if they\u2019Il...can do something about releasing my\nfather. But needless to t say, nothing happened. That is one incident that stayed with me.\nUh...Alright, I guess now the next thing is the ghetto.",
        "A: Well, from what I remember it was quite simple. We just walked or...or took a bus or\nsomething. I really don't remember exactly how we got there. Maybe on a wagon? No, I\ncannot. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I know that we were there in 1941, and I was11 years\nold with my mother and she had arranged to live in that room with Mrs. Widrick and her\ndaughter, Rita.",
        "A: Well, Kaunas and Kovno is the same thing. Kaunas is in Lithuania. Uh, well, from the\nbeginning, I remember there was Aktions. They called for 500 people, and they called\nfour thousand people to work, and they called for all kinds of things. And some came\nback, some people didn't come back, but those things did...did not affect me personally\nbecause, as I said, you know, being young, you...you don't understand a lot of things. I\n12 know...my...my mother used to go to work every day in a brigade. I don't remember\nexactly what she was doing and, but then we tried...we tried our best to survive.",
        "A: Uh...Not, not exactly. I seen alot of roundups. I seena lot of brigades going in and\nout, but...uh...there | weren't...[ could not distinguish between the ones who went and\ncame back and the ones who went and didn't come back. Uh _ I was a go-for when I was\nabout 12, 13 years old, I became a go-for for the administration in the ghetto.. .running\naround with papers, back and forth to offices...And...uh...I thought maybe...I really don't\nremember what I was thinking. I...I was just doing what I was told to do,\nAfter...and...and that's it. When I was about 14 I believe, I started to work in a...in a\nclay factory where weQ 5 * 2 used to manufacture pottery, clay...out of clay. And that\nfactory was run by afamily of generations of...of pottery makers, and they were very\nexperienced and dida very beautiful job.;5 ft",
        "A: Well...uh...so, I was doing some running for that place, \u2014 running around, delivering to\nthe pottery, and also trying to help out with the clay, kneading clay and so on and so\nt forth. A avery important uh part of my life happened in that factory. When I\nworked there, I'm sure that's whenX the... F st of the people know about the children's\naktionSwhich was the selection of the young children whomthey...they picked out from\nthe ghetto and took to the Ninthb ffi rt and killed them all over there.\nAs...as...uh...weheard, I was...the day they hAd that selection, I was at thepottery, at the\nceramic factory. And I guess the boss orthe leader of that factory had heard that there's\nata selection...they're rounding up all the children. Well, hewas kind of concerned about\nme...uh...and he said, \"Well, wegonna...since they're rounding up children we're going\nto;:ao put you to work and make you look important. So let's seeif...what we can do about\nit.\" I don't know...I don't knowif I understood what was happening, what our destiny\nwas, but he all of a sudden put me next to his old uncle who wast 9 @t the best pottery\nmaker, a real artist, and he put me rightnext to him to knead...knead the clay to prepare\nthe clay ..for him to put on that machine and he was making the pots and vases and things\nlikethat. And I remember two~3 ;6tUkrainian soldiers walked in. They looked around.\nThey didn't see any children untilthey spotted me. And they walked up to me and they\nsaid, \"How old are you?\" And 1 14 believe I said, \"I was about 14.\" Maybe I was 15.\nMaybe I was 14.\" And onesaid to me, \"Come with us.\" Wellt Ir3 ;au didn't move that fast.\nI just kept on working, and the other one looked at me andsaid, \"Aw, let him stay.\" \"Oh\nno.\" \"Let him go. Let him go. Come on. Come on.\" AndWz Ssthen the...the boss, Ske\nname 1~ Nicholas, and he intervened o and said, \"Well, this is a real good worker\nand we need him here. n And he said, \"Okay, let's leave him here. wJ And the\nsecond one insisted that I stay, and they walked away and_ tt _ this is how I remained\nthat timt and uh_ this was an0 4 60important...uh...event, that clay factory. I think\nstayed in the clay factory untilthe evacuation to the concentration camps in Germany. But\nI think before that...beforethe clay factory, we had a very importantO<ab Aktion...an\nincident happened. And that was what they called the big Aktion, thebig selection where\nthis particular day the German commandant selected 10,000 peopleO4 4b and they were\nall exterminated in one day in the Ninth Kort. And this is quite a story.Uh...They told us\nto present ourselves at 6:00 in the morning at a certain place intheghetto. The\nwhole...everyone...whoever would stay behind ..O $ tt would be shot, and naturally\neverybody showed up. They...they put everybody in thegates...and some type of Jewish\npolice and...uh...and the leaders of the ghetto triedto keep some kind of order, so as to try\nto present us in Io S ;=b guess a better light, and so not to upset the Germans, you 15\nknow, when...when we walked in front of them. I remember walking up in front of\nthe German Gestapo men with my mother loxclt 06 s~\\l. and he asked my\nmother questions, says , \"No men?\" And my mother said, \"No.\" And he says,\nWell, he pointed to the right. And as he pointed to the right, log 61D knew right\nthen and there that was death. That was the end of us. And...uh...1 remember we\nstarted crying and we _ started worrying. And...uh...my mother told me in the\nconvoys, \"Don't worry. We'll be back. We r re not going toU D go anywhere.\" And I\nthought she's really out of her mind. And...uh..~because that wasunheard of. Once they\ndecided something, there's no coming back. And...uh...she toldme,# MM she said...we\nhad...we had a friend...and this is another story. We had a friend,Lithuanian, before the\nwar who was a German-Jew, a refugee from Germany. And he usedto come over to our\nhouse and be friendly with us, with my parents. And he in 1940,was = out by the\nRussians as a O8 ; 4 olitical prisoner. He escaped, came back toLithuanian, and had some\npapers as if..1f he was some political prisoner and againstcommunism. And he was in\nghetto. We knew that.o7 aO We used to see him. And she told me, \"We're going to meet\nhim on this side, andtogether with his papers and our papers, we're going to come back.\"\nMy father'smedals...what I was talking about. \"We're going to come back.\" And again,\n[...Ididn't.... didn't know whatto a _ think. I thought my mother had lost her sind right\nthere. 4:rS; oF ll \\ tt~1~IL h. To find him on the wrong side since he was,\npoFtiswbartywas I think a single person. I don't think he had his familyO g a anymore.\nWell, to shorten it, they took us down about, oh, 50 yards or 100 yards ina different place\nafter we were selected on the right side which was the wrong sideand...uh...they were\nwaiting for more people to come and when they had a certainamount...on that side they\nusedot:2~ to...they took us into the little ghetto. And that 1s different...altogetherdifferent\nstory about the little ghetto. Well, as we were standing there and waitingto be taken to the\nlittle ghetto, I spotted that man standingt Mabout 10 yards from us and said to my mother,\n\"Here he is just like you 8aid.\" And shesays, \"Run over to him and tell him to come over\nand stay with us.\" And I did. Andhe kind of worked his way to us. My mother asked him,\n\"How did you get over here?\" Well, I tried to save a lot of people,O 9'6~ children,\nand...and the commandant wouldn't even listen to me. He just put us on thewrong side\nand here we are.\" And he was just as scared and just as weak as I was.My motherW)S\n4t\u00abOq Lao said, \"Let's stay together. Wsw'ra going with UL,J~ Well, we went to the\nlittleghetto which was empty, which was...which was exterminated before and as we\ncamethere...uh...there...uh...10,000 people were there at night.t5,+t Ten thourand people\nwere selected. And some thought that they may just separate usfrom the big ghetto and let\nus stay there and maybe live or do other things. Sosone __17 people tried to get their\nhomes and get some beds to be ableD 9 to sleep on or whatever was left from the people\nwho were there before. And my mothersaid, \"We're not looking for no houses. We are\nnot going to look for any furniture.We don't need anything. We want to come back to the\nghetto. n\u00a2: ao Because she doesntt like the situation here. So as she saidwe picked one\nhouse right...right by the gate. [remember  \\>;\u00abd~S ~ that we found some berrivie\nroom and there was an oldmattress...mattress on which Mr. h was his name, Mr. R*6tu~\nand I laid down and sleptand my mother sat in aqD lounge chair all night long and I thin\nS tt8>, M# ,r Jke aOlr something. And everytime I woke up I could see her sitting, not\nsleeping at all. At 6:00 in the morning,5:00,X1~O-D 6:00 in the morning, we heard bang\ng r~yelling, screaming, insults, dragging people. We ran out and we saw already\nsome...uh...rows of humanity being taken I thlnk in theX1 aj) direction of the Ninth Fort\nwhich we knew...which street led to the Ninth Fort. Andas we were in the line in front,\nalmost by the gate, my mother decided, she said,\"Well, now _ ttr. X h we're going to try\nto come back.\" She said, \"Ba , give/{ 4t me your papers.\" And she took the medals and\nmy father's .. paper and she ran up to oneLithuanian officer and told him that...pretended\nthat Mr. Raston was her husband andsaid that he was a political prisoner, that he was a, a\nvolunteer before the war,that he did some good things forXD Lithuania\u00ab, and would he\nhelp us in...1n sending us back to 18 the big ghetto. Well, one...one said, \"Well, don't\nworry wherever you'regoing you're going to be working. You're...you're just going to\nchange places. Itwon't be/; ; UD much different.\" And she went to another one. Another\none wouldn't even listen toher. The third one said I could not do anything about it, until\nMr. iesCcn and I kindof gave up and told herl \"Let's...let's go where everyone else goes.\"\n/; And uh - she said, \"One more.\" She saw _ she spotted thislieutenant, Lithuanian\nlieutenant, and she walked up to himand she kind of with her last breath tried to explain\nthe} 3 ' 6M situation. And he said to her, \"Look, I cannot do anything about it, but...but\ntheGerman commandant is going to come over in a few minutes and rsached...he took us\nandhe put us on the sidewalk, rather than in the streets. And he said, ~You stay here\nandwhen the German commandant comes, we're going to present to him these papers and\nseewhat he can do} 3 aU3 about it.\" And that felt very tood at that moment except that\nabout a minute later,some soldier walked up, Lithuanian soldier, and he saw us standing\non...on thesidewalk, not where everyone else was standing. And he had, 3: q O a club in\nhis hand and without any question he smacked Mr. ..9*6ten on his ear and split his ear\nand...uh...my mother on her back, black and bluemarks on her back, and told us to get\nback in the row with all the other people. Atthat time # ffi that officer noticed it and he\ncame over and he said to him, \"Look, Itold them to stay here and I want them to stay here\n19 and don't touch them.\" A minute later the German appeared, the Germancommandant.\nAnd the way it was situated was like/ 4 ag3 this. The gate of the small ghetto was the end\nof one street. The whole thinghappened...the way it happened was like a interception\nfrom which four or fivestreets...streets branched out. The German commandant wastX 40\nstanding in the middle of the interception. The gate was on one street. About 90degrees\nof that gate was the fence of the big ghetto from which we had come. No gate.3ust barbed\nwire fence with German guards and the Jewish policea ff n an the other side of it,\npretending to watch what'shappening or to guard or whatever they were doing there. a\u00bba\nXs___ Probably seeing what was happening. knothes German was J b SLt standing\nthere,the lieutenant ran over quickly, took the medal the papers, and walked over to\ntheGerman commandant and he talked to hiw. What he said I don't know, but I heard\ntheGerman yell, \"Where are those Jews? Where are those Jews?\" So he ran...he came\noverquickly and got us and...uh...my mother walked up to him quickly and told...ff 40\nrepeated her story, and he said, \"Back in the ghetto.\" And we could see...before I gotto\nthe fence, I could see the 3ewish police...there was no entrance, but the Jewishpolice16;\n65r who were on the other side tore the barbed wire with their hands and their feet,tore\napart...made a hole, and we just crawled back in. And...uh...that day 10,000people\ndied.sUD One of the nen who vent was a cousin who we really hadn't 20 seen, but we\nlearned afterwards that she was there. And...uh...this is, Iguess, how we survived that\none.g q p But...uh...it just worked out exactly the same way my mother ~1,8,~8 zr ~\npredicted. - ~ . Probably one in a million. From what I understand is thatthere may have\nbeen a few othersIn C~) who hid in attics or some other places that day instead of going\nto the Ninth Fort,and I think when somebody told me afterwards...when the Jewish police\nand the firemencame 1 10 check they found some people hidden and later got them out of\nthere. Theybrought over uniforms and they dressed n a>Dthem up as policemen and they\njust gotthem back in.I FaP S>ftdon't think there was very many, but I know\nthat...uh...thatAo* WenQwe came back, we were the only ones.O",
        "A: Well, we went back to our place, to our...where we lived in the ghetto and we\ncontinuedthe ghetto life and actually the =Ats ktt 8 e atD children's aktion\nand...uh...was after...after tWz nd they would go outcontinue living in the ghetto until the\nevacuation.",
        "A: Yes. And uh the ghetto kept on shrinking all the time,21 less and less people.\nAnd even the area was reduced and I believe in 44 when the Russian army got\ncloser to Lithuania, X for sone reason and just evacuated us and took us to\ntheconcentration camp. But before that happened...uh...peoplewere trying...trying to build\nsome bunkers~ They werecalled bunkers, which were hiding pl*ces. They kind of5 C1D\nexpected that some day when the war was over that theGermans would not leave a trace\nof U8.

        "A: Well, it all depends. It all depends. It was different for all people. For me7 Well,when I\nwas working...running a \u201c so around and working, it wasn't that bad.

We played there among ours Qlvesand...uh...and\n..uh...as a matter of fact, I had a good friend who was the captain of our team.

        "A: Prom what I remember was this. There were no schools inthe \u2014 school in the ghetto. If\nthere were any, I didn't know about it. Uh... We had some friends as I said who came\nfrom...who also were German-Jewish refugees who came to live \u2014 ol; 1 in Panemon and\nmy parents became friends of theirs. And they were religious people, very religious\npeople, and...uh...tbere were all the Jewish traditions andso Ol~qO forth. They\nalso made it to the ghetto. And remember when I was about 12, 12 and a half, my\nmother...uh...said that this gentleman...I forgot his name...would teach me the\nSa orah and everything that one needs to know to havea Bar o Mitzvah. So every\nday he used to come over. I used to go over to his place and we would study4*F 1 I\ndon't remember how long, but...uh...but by the time the day of the Bar Mitzvah came, I\nremember there was a house and there were25D z ; D quite a few people, 10, 20 and I\nremember the women being in d,~ the back and...uh...they were styihq their Saturday\nprayerd g ust like in the normal times, and when it came to my paronks I remember that I\nthink I did fairly well with myuL ~< =~. And one thing I can remember that day, I had\nneverO)'457 seen my mother cry so hard and that day, it was...1t was I remember it was\nimpossible to stop her. Although> @; a after...after the Bar Mitzvah, they had a little\nparty.Whoever had anything brought over, and we managed to03 a 3 celebrate. That was\none incident I remember clearly.And...uh.*.1n the ghetto every day life, work and we\nheard, of course, all kind of incidents. If I were to go to very day life, there was a hanging\nin the ghetto that I remembero 3;%5 clearly because...uh...uh...one...they...they claimed\nthey found in fact, one of the inmates with a revolver or a pistol trying to smuggle into\nthe ghetto. & And uh _natura}ly the Gestapo apprehended him and uh we\nwere ordered everyone was ordered to appear in one place. And the gallows were all\nprepared ~ They brought him back. I remember having seen him coming out of the = all\nbeaten up, swollen, hardly recognizable, andI.. \u00a9O remember the hanging incident. I\nwas maybe 12, 13 watching through a window because...uh...they had him $4; a pistol or\nsomething. And I believe because of that...the # +O ghetto had to sacrifice a lot of people\nfor him because they wanted to punish US and took some innocent people and just\n26Wtg t3 did kill them Xe=roTth of that incident. It was not...it was not pleasant. You\nhad to move from place to place. As they were shrinking the ghetto, we had to move from\nplace to place. And...uh...tried to do the best...make the best of it. I am sure that there\nwere a lot of other incidents thatt6 '2 thappened. I'll probably think of them later, but right\nnow I cannot think of them.",
        "A: Well, when...when they evacuated us. We were one of the last ones to be evacuated, to\nGermany, to the concentration camps. They took us 1n a train. We traveled to Germany. I\ndon't know. I don't remember how long it was. But I remember coming to Stutthof and\nuh and they separated the women from the men and...uh...kept the women in the\nStuffhof camp someplace around Stutthof and the men they took to Landsberg.\nLandsberg was a...was the first stop in t Germany. That was a concentration camp.\nA small one I believe not far from Munich and not far from Dachau. And I\nremember being separated with my mother already and I justO G qocontinued with the\ntrains to deeper into Germany. And that is the last time I heard of my mother until\nafter the war. I had some people who were with her and told me that she \u2014_ died in the\nlast days of the war. The exact details they | O5 CDnever told me, but...uh...probably\nfor some reason probably 27 not to upset me or other things, but the exact way I\ndon't know, but I know she...she died in the last days. And...uh...I came to Landsberg, and\nthere were a lot of men, young men and older men. And we stayed there not too long, and\nthey ordered all the children up to 17 years old to q O assemble and...uh...and they took\nus away. They took us away to...to Dachau. We were about 131 I believe, and we stayed\nin Dachau for 1 week and then they shipped us out to Birkenau, Auschwitz, Birkenau.\nAnd...uh...when we came to Birkenau....",
        "A: Well, the ride to Birkenau. We were...we were put in three \u2014 wagons, three railroad\nwagons, train wagons, 131 ofusand D we we were stopping someplace. The only\nthing I really remember from that ride is that we came to a place in a train station where\nsome Russian prisoners were able to walkup to our train and there were some port holes\nin our cattleOg # 513 trains and warned US to see and try to...try to escape if we could\nbecause...uh...they said if you are Jewish and youare.. going to Auschwitz or\nBirkenau, that's where they kill them Oq \u00bb D all. So if you have a chance, just run away.\nAnd some of us couldn't . And it...it took quite a while to get there. And one incident I\nremember was that since we>q # O were all Lithuanian children that none of us spoke\nPolish so _\u2014_28 to try to escape was useless or we wouldn't know to talk or how to talk.\nButin my...1n my wagon, there were two boys who did speak Polish, a little or a lot I don't\nknow. I knew they knew something about it. And they told us that a they were going to\njump and escape. Now, we hada big _\u2014_ dilemma because if they escaped and we knew\nfrom the ghetto Ib Qdif one did anything wrong, all of us would be done. So we\nhad a plan made up with them thst they...we would try __ to...there were two older\nGerman guards in that train,and we would try to distract them to try...there were\nmaybe 60 qOofus or 50 of US on that train, and we would try...there = was\nonly...the was only made of about we were maybe about 5 or 10 kids involved in that.\nAnd...uh...we said like this, that they're going to go through that port hole, \u2014_tnD try to\nclimb down the step of the train and stay there for awhile until maybe the moment that\nthe train slows down a little bit...I believe the train was going about maybe 40 miles an\nhour, 50 miles an hour, and when the train slow down and maybe in a brushy area where\nit would be softer...softer to land, they would try to jump. And to protect us because out\nof 50 kids someone had to see that they were jumping out and not to tell the Germans that\nwould have been the end of every one of us. So we decided with them that they're going\nto jump and in about a couple of hours later, we would pretend...we would be\nabout...and...100 miles away...120 miles away from that area...a couple of hours later, we\nwould pretend that we just saw the kids jump, and we would tell the German guards that\nhere two kids have jumped out and here they are. They're laying right here watching us.\nAnd...uh...maybe that would save us and...uh...1n the meantime, Seli thit w%l;;D-,\nthey wouldn't...they wouldn't even look for them that far away and...uh...maybe they\nwould. So we did itZ; q D that way. We...we took four...four of us, starting talking to the\nGermans. They were kind of older and they were not from the SS. They were from the\nWehrmacht, so...so you could speak to them once in awhile. They would...I remember\nsomeone was talking to them about knives, about other/3 61) things. I don't remember the\nconversation. About we were watching the homes or the greenery while the train was\ngoing by. We just talked to them and kept them busy. And all of a sudden, like we said,\nabout two hours later, one kid ran up to us and started to pretend that he's telling me a?\nbao secret~ And they got excited and they asked whatts happened. We said, \"Go look\nquick. Quick. Through that window, the port hole, two kids just jumped out.\" First, they\ndidn't believe it and then they kinda looked and then3 AO they said, \"Well, it took you\ntoo long. They were right there.\" And thirdly, they started to call the officer somehow\nand made some signs that we should stop the train reco+Mblc and to recount them\nbecause if they took them to , we/ # 61D were missing. Now that took a little while. And\nthey30stopped the train. They took us all out and they counted us three times, and two\nwere missing. SO they...they asked us, Where did it happened. And they said, \"About five\nminutes# dD ago, they all jumped out, and we reported it, we saw it.\"And okay, from\nwhat I understand they did call the localpolice in that town, but that may have had been\n10towns...those kids were about 10 towns behind us...andthey...they were looking for\nthem. What happened? We don'tknow. But from what I heard lately, I think one...ne of/4\n4O them did survive. Someone told me a story that one kid whenthey were transported\nfrom...uh...from...uh...we were goingto Buchenwald to Birkenau jumped the train. One of\ntheLithuanian kids jumped the train, and he's somewhere iny 5 ; > Israel right now. And\nI'm trying to see if we can makecontact and meet him. And...uh...that I learned recently\nayear...maybe a few months ago. So we then we came toAuschwitz,- Birkenau. We were\nled in. We were kept for3 about 3 days in quarantine, and we didn't know why in\nabarrack with straw, not even a shower. Very little food.And we could see a lot of\nconcerned inmates, old timers whoused to come in and out, in and out, talk to us, and ask\nusZ S qt questions. And we found out...out later, the reason westayed there about four\ndays before letting us into thecamps is because this is the first transport of children\nwhowere let into Birkenau alive. There were some childrenyC CnD before who came\nwith their father or families. WhenI say 31 children, 13, 14, 15. And we were the\nfirst...1t was late in the war andthings had started to change a little bit. So what happened,\nwe don't really know.But they told us U aO later that...uh...they were very surprised and\nhappy that wewere the first ones let in, and we were in quarantine ini \u2014_a...in a camp\nwhich was called A-lager, A-lager. WciL~ we /6 gO didn't doanything from...just looked\nfor food. Try see what...uh...we could do.b...That's allwe thought about. There were hot\ndays and cold days and all kinds of days.J7;6t And I remember after quarantiner they\ntook us to a children's barrack in the...theD-Lager, which was a working lager, working\ncamp. They were a lot of kommandos,people who used to go to work every day and come\nback. And we had those appells whereyou had to get up early in the morning, stand in\nthat place being counted day andnight, twice a day to make sure that everyone of US was\nthere. And at the beginning! didn't do anything there either. There was notn 4 D too much\nwork for us, I believe. But there was one brigade that used to...that usedto come out of\nthis barrack. And they were some children whopushed...uh...some...they called q K it a\nroll wagon....1t looked like a...like abuggy or like a horse and buggy, without a horse and\niVet collected garbage in someplaces in the camps and the crematoriums and things like\nthat. That was not a bad jObcause when you u6ed to gol t aUDto some of those places\nand being a child or young men, you used to meet some womenand older people who\nused to give 32d.%you some_ share withatheir rations or bread or whatever they v\nhad. But...uh...that was hard to 4 ve into until one day, I%;~ O remember it was pouring\nrain, mud to your knees, and you hadto go and push that wagon. Well, some of the kids\nwho wereworking there before kind of hid or didn't show up,/ 4 t6D and...uh...half way\nvolunteering and half way being picked Igot into that job. And as I said before, many\ndays thathelped me because people used to hand Fe some things, foodand things like to\neat, which was the most important thing/ 5 ;O in that time. We stayed there not very long,\nmaybe a fewmonths. The...the crematorium had quiet2 down...quietedD down from what\nI understand. They...they didn't exterminatepeople in those days as much as they did in\nthe earlier daysuntil one day we woke up and we did see all kind of flamesgoing through\nthose chimneys and we knew that's what's goingon. We knew that they were burning\npeople over there, but\u00bb 5 that day they...someone told us...I don't know how therumors\nstarted. They had rounded up about 3,000gypsies...gypsies and just took them to the\ncrematorium andjust gassed them and burned them like they did...they did\u00bbD Q O the\nJewish people. And that was...uh...kind of scared. __..Needless to say, also...now it's\ncoming back to me...uh.. Hthose A and D lagers, we were...we were...there were \u00bb\n~ QO selections too. I almost forgot about those.9eday we 4. were onthe\nappellSplaNK where we were supposed to stand every morning and evening and\nth- Ke--an KO ~n~aNt KdR- b33 and he looked over. We...I was in a children's\nbarrack anda | ;n he looked us over, and...uh...I think that was before thatGypsy incident\nand he looked us over. He asked us our ages.And...uh...1 remember I think I was about 14\nat that...atthat time, and ...uh...the kid next to me, he asked him hisa I aD age, and he told\nthem 14. THet marked down his number.Uh...I had felt that was not a good sign, so when\nhe walkedup to me, I told him I was 15. I tried to lie about a year.D He looked at me\ntwice and just walked by me. Well, thatafternoon they came to pick up all the kids\nwho[*...whosenumber they had written down. I never heard fromthem @ _ = againg\nUh Another incident, also in Birkenau. Sne dayWa a. n they showed up with a measuring\ninstrument, measuring device 7 likea  asquare. And we had to walk under it. And\nIremember you never knew whether to be tall is better or tobe short is better or to older or\nto be younger. You neveraw R O knew. There was a lot of deception, a lot of lies,\nandconfused us completely. And this I think, also, wasa; Q D instrumental 1n..in some of\nus not being as resistant as weshould have been because we were completely lied\nto,deceived and mishandled and by the time some of us woke up, .. Q_ it was\nalmost too late. This measuring device I remember walking through it and I\nbarely touched that bar-SSacross and my number was not taken that da H Some\nof the shorter =* ones I remember was taken. But you really never knew what\nS was the right wayX They had you confused completelyg And 34 after that...I\nbelieve after Birkenau, we went...they evacuated us or theytook us out to...uh...what they\ncalled...we went to Auschwitz for one day, and theydid...and then Auschwitz, that was\nthe big concentration;3 %~ camp near Birkenau. And then they took us to which was\ncalled farm. And that farm wascalled _ Birkenau again. There were different names. They\nseparated a lot of us, andI wound up in that ofaq~ y Birkenau where I was very sick. Had\npneumonia and stayed in...there was aHungarian-Jewish doctor took care of the little\nhospital. He had a few bedsand...uh...he took care of me with some medicines. I\nwas there for quitea few |X weeks I remember and just barely got better or well by\nthe time they took us to Buchenwald. And that was quite aa 4 q O march. Also\n[...another incident happened. I forgot to tAo94(Otalk about that one...in Birkenau\nwhen we got the needles.w _\u2014_\u2014 I don't know, 5, 10 of us got the neelles and we were just a\nG (tlaying in whatthey call a hospital and the main doctor who took care of us was a\nFrench-Jewishdoctor. He was extremely kind, understanding and tried to help us. Matter\n;ao offact, he saved our lives there. I remember before ..evacuation day, we had to be sick\nabout 21 days in order to be declared notcontagious and...uh...[ think that day we _ ;\nwere about 17 days in the hospital and we remember himrunning back and forth trying to\ndoctor all kinds of peoplein charge and what we remember, he signed something or 35\ndeclared us well enough, we were not...we were not contagious anymore. Itwas touch and\ngo until he was ableX 1D to declare us not contagious and...and they were able to\nevacuate us with everyoneelse. In that of Birkenau ....(Pause) we were...we were most of\nus were working atW +\u00a2r on;6 6 Z S the tincv I don't remember. I didn't work at the time.\nWhen I was there, I was sickand I didn't do too much.aL q O And...uh...1f not for that\nHungarian doctor, I wouldn't have survived there either.Because I must have been well\nenough to make that long trip to Buchenwald. Wewere...we were(b about 6 days I believe\nand 6 nights. We were walking for many, many, many days...formany hours and I think\nat night we stopped just for a little sleep a few hours. Andthen I think we were on trains.\nThey put us on trains right before9D we got to Buchenwald. And it was wintertime and it\nwas open wagons and you...wegot...uh...one of my eyes was very infected and...uh...I\nlived with that throughBuchenwalda N qOmost of the time. Some days it was better,\nsome days it was worse. But I don't thinkthat I had any treatment for that. Uh...In\nBuchenwald we were again in a children'sbarrack, ina S n quarantine for 66. They\nbrought 66 I believe in the back of the camp. In that barrack,there were a lot of\nHungarians, Slovakians, German, Polish Jewish children and someof us, Lithuanians.\nAnd...uh...we didn't do any work because we; 3 were in quarantine. And we...when you\nwere in quarantine, they didn't make you work. Theday...36\n"
