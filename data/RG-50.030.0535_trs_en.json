        "A: Yeah, so, my mother, she came from a family living in \u2014 in Latvia, and \u2014 not in\nRiga, she was Ventspila(ph). That\u2019s a different city, it\u2019s a ha-harbor in Latvia. And\nshe had two brothers, and t-two sisters. And they owned a \u2014 a farm of cattle, a cattle\nfarm up there. But \u2014 and of course in Latvia there was a \u2014 a certain amount of\nJewish population. And that way Latvia also was a \u2014 belonged to Russia, but\nbefore it belonged to Russia, was a part of Germany, was a colony of Germany.\nAnd the people spoke German, and later they learned Russian from the Russian\noccupation, or beca \u2014 the Russian got the \u2014 got the territory. And she \u2014 her \u2014 they\nwere Selling cattle to Finland and Sweden and everywhere. But then the \u2014 the tsar\nof Russia had a brother and his name was Peter. And when they went \u2014 they went\nin war with Germany, a \u2014 a [indecipherable] there were \u2014 he \u2014 he was afraid of the\nJewish population because in those days the Jews were friendly with the Germans,\nJuly 23, 2009\nand they spoke Yiddish, which 1s an \u2014 an old German. It\u2019s a dialect of Germany\nfrom \u2014 from 500 years ago. So Peter decided, with his brother, the tsar of Russia,\nthey decided to \u2014 to take the Jews and send them to the other part of Russia by the\n[-Iranian border, by the Caspian Sea, by Azrahan(ph), by Baku, Azrahan(ph).\nAnd they were sent there. And up there they \u2014 they started a new life, with different\nbusinesses to survive. And the gr \u2014 the grandfather, my mother\u2019s father started\nbecause there \u2014 up there is a lot of fish. The \u2014 the caviar comes from there, and the\n\u2014 and the best fish. And the oils from the whales, too, which was like, very\nimportant in those days. So he start the factory of smoking fish, and he was very\nsuccessful with that because in those days, in the first World War, the Russian army\nhad no C-rations like today, and they used to u-use a piece of smoked fish and a\npiece of bread. That was the food of the Russian soldier. And \u2014 and he couldn\u2019t\nproduce enough smoked fish for the government, so we\u2019re \u2014 the government wanted\nthey should produce more fish, they\u2019re working day and night. So he complained\nabout it. So they told him, don\u2019t worry about it, 1f you\u2019re short of labor, we give you\nworkers. So they gave him Turkish prisoners and German prisoners and Austrian\nprisoners from the first World War, and they used to work in the factory helping to\nsmoke the fish. And \u2014 and two prisoners fell in love with my aunts, and they\nmarried my aunts, and when the revolution of Russia started, the war with the\nJuly 23, 2009\nGermans and Russians stopped, because the Germans made the Russian revolution,\nI don\u2019t know if you know that, yeah. Because they got Lenin in Switzerland, and\nthey gave him money and they send him back to Russia to make the revolution.\nAnd when they made the revolution, the war stopped. So those \u2014 those two\nprisoners took their wives with them to Germany, and then went to United States.\nAnd one uncle \u2014 an aunt went to Belgium. And my mother, she was young and she\nwasn\u2019t married, so she stayed with \u2014 with her folks, and the two brothers went to the\nRussian army. And after the war, my mother was the only daughter home with the \u2014\nwith the two brothers. They went back to Latvia from Azrahan(ph). But the\nparents died in Azrahan(ph). They got \u2014 what\u2019s that disease? The fever \u2014\nL: Typhoid?",
