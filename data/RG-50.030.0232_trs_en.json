And these people, just like everybody else, had to sort of,\nsay, shift for themselves, and stand on line, and of course sometimes the line got -- by the\ntime they got to your point in the line, the food was gone. But this is -- basically was the\ndivision of everybody for himself. They had to secure their own food, and they -- her\nfamily had to secure her own food.",
        "Q: What was the atmosphere like in the apartment?",

        "Q: Up until what point was there enough food?",
        "A: It went on like this up to the time when the Jews were removed from the -- from town all\ntogether, but there was less and less bread, but it was all rationed. But there was always\nless of it, up to the point when the town was cleared of Jews.",

In reta -- and in retaliation, they -- 10 or 12\npeople were hung in the square.",
        "Q: S -- was it an atmos -- can she remember back to the -- like waking up in the morning?\nWhat was the atmosphere like? Was it one of terror, was there any hope? Was --",
        "A: It was terrible fear among all, because nobody knew who was going to be next.",
        "Q: Did you think you would survive?",

        "Q: Did you get any sense of how your mother or your father felt?",
        "A: It was basically that a -- that very fear of what will happen that my parents, I\u2019m sure, felt.",
        "Q: Did you ever hear any tales of -- witness any form of resistance to what was going on?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember that.",

        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: I wa -- I wanted just to go back, because you s -- you were talking about the fear, that it\ncould happen to you, you never knew who would be next, and I wanted to ask you if --\nyou said you\u2019d seen people die for the first time. Did you, in any incident see people die\nthat you knew personally, or were these strangers?",

        "Q: Could she describe the incident to me. I mean, what -- where was she going when she\nsaw it, what happened, was [indecipherable]",
        "A: There were many people dead in the street, who were just laying in the street, and that is\nwhat I saw for the first time in my life, though other people were dying also, but basically\nwhat you saw on the streets all the time were these corpses.",
        "Q: Had they died from starvation, or from --",
        "A: Cold, and -- and -- and hunger.",
        "Q: Would you -- so people every day, I mean, two people, or three people, or 10 people, or -",
        "A: I saw them -- I saw single corpses here and there, but mother was very protective, and she\nwould not allow me to see it, so whenever there was somebody killed in the street, she\nmade sure that I didn\u2019t go out to see any more than I -- I have already seen. I ... I do\nremember something. ... They were apparently concentrating all the people at that time,\nbut basically there was a work -- there was work to be done in our town because of the\nmunitions factory. And they were always looking toward having cheap, or slave labor out\nof the people who were shipped in.",
        "Q: I don\u2019t know if she happens just to know how many people were in the ghetto by 1944\nwhen everyone was --",
        "A: Not \u00b044.",

        "A: I wouldn\u2019t know.",
        "Q: I'd like to go back a little bit to -- ... just to wait until -- before she answers.",
        "A: Well, thi -- the circle vot -- of women, the volunteers sa --",
        "Q: I guess what I was interested to hear was that there was this sense of solidarity with the\nnew arrivals, and trying to help, and that it was organized help. And I just wondered if\nshe could tell me a little about the theater group, and -- and doing plays, and what plays\nshe did, and -- and what she -- what she thought she was doing, and what was her\nunderstanding of that.",
        "A: Well, the theater was composed of th -- I need to answer. Then there was a -- there was a\n-- a little drama about a woman who took in a child, and she was -- she wasn\u2019t very kind\nto the child, and the child was taken away from her, and that was the drama that they\nenacted on the stage in that little theater.",
        "Q: Does she remember the poem?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, some of it. Yeah, she remembers, did you want her --",
        "Q: Can she [indecipherable]. Very nice. You\u2019ve got an extraordinary memory.",

        "Q: Did you get a lot of applause for that?",
        "A: And a lot of kisses, too. A lot of kisses, and a lot of applause.",
        "Q: So there were a few happy memories from this time?",
        "A: The most important thing is that I was at that time still with my parents and my sister.\nAnd my parents were -- their only goal was to protect us, and to feed us, and to -- to be\nsure that our way of life does not change as drastically as the circumstances have forced\nus to live in.",
        "Q: Could we move on now to couple -- a few years, to the time when you\u2019re taken to\nAuschwitz? Is your father s -- is her father still alive [indecipherable]",
        "A: He died in camp, you see. We were talking -- you were talking up to the ghetto.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Now is camp --",
        "Q: I know.",
        "A: -- and her father -- I told her to remember when the father died.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: But let\u2019s build up to that. Perhaps -- can she tell me how she came to go to the camp?\nWhat were the -- did someone come one day to the house and say, your -- pack up and\ngo, or how did that --",
        "A: At that time, and that is toward --",
        "Q: Yeah?",
        "A: Toward the ... So what do you want to tell her? I gave her the date, what did --",
        "Q: Okay. Yeah, if she could tell us, when she heard this knock --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: She knew what it meant? Did she know what was going to happen? And could she\ndescribe how she felt?",
        "A: We knew by then that this was a clearing to go to -- t-to Treblinka, but we --",
        "Q: What happened at Treblinka? Did you know who -- there were death camps, and that you\nwould be systematically --",
        "A: Basically, ah -- she knew that people were being --",
        "Q: Is this noise okay for you? It\u2019s gone now, okay.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: Could we -- could you carry on telling me the story of when you heard -- they banged on\nthe door, and you heard them saying everybody up?",
        "A: What\u2019s sh --",
        "Q: What happened next? I mean, I wanted --",
        "A: What happened next, okay. The night before, we -- because there were selections going\non in neighboring towns, and it was then that everybody realized that it was not passive --\nthat we will not get away, by not -- we will not get away, that we will be included in the\nselections, too.",
        "Q: So you got dressed, and you went down to the square.",
        "A: When the selections started, they were se --",
        "Q: You knew at that point what each group meant, that it -- you were presumably put in the\nchildren\u2019s group.",
        "A: No, she was a older child --",
        "Q: So th --",
        "A: They\u2019re talking about --",
        "Q: Oh, little -- little children.",
        "A: Babies, yeah. What was the question originally?",
        "Q: So, ho -- did she know what was -- everybody was aware that little children were going to\nbe --",
        "A: Yes, yes. Then there was also a group of women that was being separated and my mother\nwas in it, sort of assigned to personnel, that they were going to run personnel or\nwhatever. And I stayed with my mother, and -- and I was able to get in with her, into that\ngroup.",
        "Q: And what ha -- where were you taken?",
        "A: We were marched into -- toward that camp. Father always -- also went to Shterneetsa, the\ncamp Shterneetsa.",

        "A: All four. Father, mother, and the two girls.",
        "Q: You know, when you di -- I was coming back to what you were saying about the doctor\nand -- and her child. From the footage that I\u2019ve seen, the -- the selections always look sort\nof -- everyone seems very quiet, and passive, but obviously that wasn\u2019t the case with --\nwith the selection as you experienced it. It must have been a lot of screaming, and crying,\nand horrible, awful stuff.",
        "A: If the people were very quiet, chances are that they were totally in shock. Because the\ncrying, and the -- and the -- the -- the noises were basically were people were being\nseparated, where they were being torn apart. But otherwise, people were in total shock,\nand they were -- 1-in that way, they were quiet. There were also those who were\n[indecipherable] and they knew that this was the last -- last trip.",
        "Q: Tell me a -- so you -- you marched for three or four hours to the camp?",
        "A: It was two or three.",
        "Q: Two or three hours to the camp. What happened when you arrived?",
        "A: When we arrived at the camp Shtelneetsa, there was a wall-like structure, because ...\nThere was a communal kitchen where soup was being cooked, and people who went to\nwork in the factory got a portion of soup and a piece of bread in the morning, and the\nsame in the evening when they returned from the factory.",
        "Q: Did you work in the factory?",
        "A: No, I was -- I did not work in the factory, I was peeling potatoes in the kitchen, work with\nmy mother.",
        "Q: Was there a roll call every day, was there strict discipline in the camp?",

        "A: Shifts, thank you. Three shifts, eight hours each.",
        "Q: What was the -- did many people die through the hard conditions and lack of food?",
        "A: Very many people died, not just from the conditions and work, but also from typhus.\nThere was a typhus epidemic at that time in the camp. I reme -- she remembers that the\ncommandant of the -- of the police -- of the -- the German police, during the epidemic\ncame one day to camp, parked his car in a specific place, and told all the -- the sick ones\nto come out and run around the car. And whoever couldn\u2019t make it was shot right then\nand there.",
        "Q: Were there many incidents of simply gratuitous brutality like that? I mean --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: I guess what I\u2019m unclear about 1-1n the -- this whole thing with the camp is how is it\ndifferent from a concentration camp? How is it different from Auschwitz?",
        "A: The first thing is there was no crematorium. In this camp there was still families, you\ncould still see the families. In Auschwitz it was already all separated and -- and no more\nfamily set up.",
        "Q: Were the living conditions better than at Auschwitz, or about the same? Food, lodging,\nclothing, whatever.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And how long were you here for, at this camp? ... And just -- just one second, just sorry --",
        "A: May I also explain before we start, as I told you before, there were two camps, and this\ncamp, Shtelneetsa was later liquidated and combined with the other Myoufka camp, you\nsee?",
        "Q: So she went from one to the other.",
        "A: She went from one to the other as I did, too, and we went to Auschwitz as one unit.",
        "Q: From the second camp.",
        "A: Right. Because first there were three camps, then there were two camps, and then there\nwas one camp. And -- you see?",
        "Q: And -- and let me just double check one thing, which 1s, the men were ...",
        "A: I don\u2019t think this came out very clear, that she didn\u2019t say it so that you -- I -- I -- let -- let\nme just coach her.",
        "Q: Okay, I understood that. How was her health, and her family\u2019s health in this time, did\nthey get sick?",
        "A: You know, her father died in camp?",
        "Q: I know, so --",
        "A: We actually were -- had typhus first, and that weakened us all. But we somehow\nrecovered even though we were weak, but the father was paralyzed after the typhus, and\nhe died in Shtelneetsa camp.",
        "Q: Did he have any medical help when he was sick? Did there -- was there a doctor?",
        "A: The only medical help that I\u2019m aware of is that one of the Ukrainian guards was paid to\nbring in leeches from town. And he brought the leeches, and my father was treated with\nleeches, and that\u2019s about all I know.",
        "Q: Were -- was your mother, or were any of you with your father when he died?",
        "A: My mother was -- the mother was with the father.",

        "A: She remembers that the -- when the f -- ... the night before he died, she saw -- the last\ntime I saw my father, he was choking, and there was no pillow for to support his back.

Many people saw what\nwas happening, and as they approached the tri -- the entrance to the train -- to the wagon,\ninstead of entering, would go to the end of the line, trying to beat it, so to say. And very\nsoon the Germans realized that this was going to go on, and this wasn\u2019t what they were\nexpected, so they started beating everybody furiously, and that way the ca -- the trains\nwere loaded. Hel -- she remembers that her mother took with her a -- a teapot with water,\nand she sat on the teapot right along.

        "A: When we arrived in the camp, in Auschwitz platform -- ... women\u2019s camps. And all these\nwomen were wearing stripe -- you know, the stripes. And we noticed they had no hair,\nand we thought -- I thought that the -- she though that this was total like a madhouse,\nsome kind of a madhouse, because these women were trying to shout something, and say\nsomething, but obviously they were talking in a language that she didn\u2019t understand. She\ndidn\u2019t know what they were saying, so the whole thing was like an -- like a -- like a --\nlike an in -- like insanity, because nobody knew what they were saying.

They were given out other clothes that was handed to them, it was more like\nputting, because tall women got short dresses, and short women got long dresses, and\nnobody got what really fit, it was just being handed out. And later on, when the number\nwas administered to the arm -- the tattoo was done in the following fashion. They used a -\n- sawed off a fountain pen, and they applied little dots to make the number, dot after dot.\nAnd all I remember -- all she remembers is that when the tattoo was done she was told to\nlick her finger with her saliva and -- and rub it on the number. Why that was to be done\nshe doesn\u2019t know, but she did it. And that\u2019s -- that\u2019s the way the number was made.",

        "A: Her number is A14319.",
        "Q: Is there a significance to the -- why an A?",
        "A: It was a series, but this was the second time around. Those are numbers that other people\nalready had, without the A, and this was the second series number. So it\u2019s hard to tell\nhow many people had the same numbers, except for the letter A.",

        "A: The personnel consisted of the main overseer of the -- of the barracks, the s-secretary, the\nmessenger, four supervisors, ea -- one for each section of the barracks. They were all\nprisoners as we were, and they were women -- Jewish women from Czechoslovakia.",

        "Q: Could you give an example?",
        "A: When the roll call came around, they -- they yelled terribly. Also, they used to yell a lot\nwhen they were checking -- there was a check of the -- how the bunks were kept. And if\nthey didn\u2019t like something there was terrible yelling, but they did not beat us.",

        "A: The -- the business of washing up, of staying clean was that once every na -- every --\nonce in a while, the group would be taken to the sownar, which you know what tt is,\nright, for disinfect -- ...

        "Q: What sort of physical condition were the three of you in by the time the selection was\nmade, the selection that you\u2019re going to tell us about?",
        "A: Physically they were not well off because they were starving. Somehow or other they\nwere pushed through, but that does not mean they were in good physical condition.",
        "Q: Were you or your mother or your sister ever punished for any reason?",
        "A: The discipline was so -- so strong, and it was -- everything was obeyed that there was\nvery seldom a reason to -- to punish any transgression. The biggest punishment as far as\nshe\u2019s concerned is that she was taken to the gas chamber, and that\u2019s what she would like\nto tell.",
        "Q: Could she -- could -- would she tell us the story now, from beginning to end?",

Okay. ... piles of hell piled up, and she and her mother are\nhuddling, and her mother is explaining to her that, \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t feel bad, because life -\n- all of life is just like a corridor, like a hallway, you know. You pass through it to a better\nlife, and that\u2019s where we\u2019re going.\u201d Some women were hysterical, other women were\nsitting quietly, and every now and then the door would open, and the SS men -- women --\nSS women would come in and say, \u201cHa, you\u2019re still alive.\u201d And they would close the\ndoor. And then they would hear all these sounds outside, laughing and joking. Then the\ndoor opened again, and the men came in with gas masks on, and they had a box. They\nopened the box, which contained powder, like talcum powder, white talcum powder, and\nthey scattered it around, and they threw the box down, and they left. Well, they were\nquite sure that this was the very end. And finally, a few more times, they -- the -- the --\nthen the women came in, the SS women said, \u201cNow, you are going to have to sort these\nrags here, because these rags are going to be sent to the crematorium, and you are going\nto be sent to a place where there\u2019s braiding to be done.\u201d And so they said to each other,\n\u2018That cannot be, they are teasing us, because what she means is that we will go the\ncrematorium, and the rags are going to go to the place for braiding.\u201d And th-this lasted\nfor 48 hours, no water, and no food. 120 -- 100 to 120 women.
