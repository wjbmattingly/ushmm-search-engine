In other words, we were raised by a governess or nurses. Spent a lot of\ntime away from my parents, although they kept coming, but we were at \u2014 basically,\nuntil I was five years old, until 1938, that\u2019s how we lived.",

        "A: Yes, because I went there and looked at the street and the house in 1945 - \u00b046,\nright after the war, and also from my parents\u2019 stories. We lived there in \u2014 in the\nApril 22, 1994\ncenter of town. We lived in the \u2014 what\u2019s known as the third bezirke, which is a\nsection of Vienna right near the Belvedere Palace, and we had a private three floor\nhouse, a walk-up kind of thing. I do remember glimpses of it from before the war,\nnot too much.",

And because\nhe had wide interests in Austria and my mother preferred Austria to Poland, that\u2019s\nApril 22, 1994\nwhy we \u2014 he had a residence in Austria, and that\u2019s why my brother and I were born\nin Austria.",
        "Q: Tell me about your schooling th \u2014 when you were young. When did you first\nbegin school?",
        "A: I did not begin school at all, because the war broke out September 1\u201c, 1939, and\nI was just \u2014 I had just turned in August, seven, and in Poland school started at sev \u2014\nyou know, first grade at seven. So I had just been registered. By then we were in\nPoland, because we went from Vienna to Poland after the anschluss. And so I\nnever went to school.",
        "Q: How religious was your family?",
        "A: Not at all. Not at all, except that they were \u2014 I can only \u2014 I don\u2019t remember too\nmany holidays before the war, barely any at all. I remember one Passover in 1938,\nin Poland already, maybe \u00b039, and \u2014 but I don\u2019t remember any Jewish observance. I\ndo know that they felt Jewish. During the war I remember that I knew we were\nJewish, and so on, but I don\u2019t remember any tradition at home until after the war.",

        "Q: So when you were very young, you pla \u2014 you had non-Jewish playmates?",
        "A: Not too many playmates, because at that time, somehow children were more\nisolated. There was more fear of contagion and illnesses and all kinds of things.\nAnd I had a younger brother and the idea was that that was companionship enough.\nAnd so I re\u2014I only remember very few other children, not at all on a steady basis,\nand my brother and I just played together. We also \u2014 neither one of us went to any\nnursery school or anything. But I know from what I heard later, that was not\nunusual. Children \u2014 some children did grow up \u2014 I think the more affluent people\nbrought up their children that way. I do know that some \u2014 some of my cousins, my\nhusband\u2019s family, his \u2014 they seem to have had a lot of contact with their cousins,\nwhich I didn\u2019t because I was in Vienna until I was five, so I \u2014 until I was five I\ncertainly don\u2019t remember any other children.",

        "A: I recall that we had went on a train trip somewhere, and then, with our\ngoverness, or nanny, or whatever, and we went to Krakow from Vienna without\nour parents, and met them 1n vien \u2014 in Krakow when we arrived. And I remember\nthat we were told that we are going to live here from now on for \u2014 for good. And\nthat we had \u2014 and they hired a new governess, who spoke Polish, which we didn\u2019t\nspeak, my brother and I, and that we were told that it was important for us to learn\nPolish.",
        "Q: What language had you spoken at home?",
        "A: German.",
        "Q: Only?",
        "A: German, yes. So, I remember that we then started living in Poland. That\u2019s when\nI first also saw some of my relatives. I remember my grandfather coming to our\nhouse, and going to my maternal grandparents, meeting some of my cousins, and\nduring the \u2014 tha \u2014 at that point, I remember that.",
        "Q: When did you arrive in Krak\u00e9w?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know the exact months, but it must a \u2014 it was right after the anschluss.\nWe were still in Vienna during the anschluss, and my parents were horrified\nbecause they were in Poland and this happened that \u2014 an-and the two children were\nin Vienna. And then they were able to smuggle us out, through Switzerland. They\nApril 22, 1994\nsent somebody from Switzerland to pick us up, I know to this day who it was. And\nthis young man pretended that he was married to our governess, and he had a Swiss\npassport. My brother and I had no papers, or whatever papers we had probably were\nnot very good for us. And so they took us out, since we were so young, to\nSwitzerland, pretending that we were their children.",
        "Q: What was his name?",
        "A: His name was Oswild(ph) Landau(ph). He was the son, a young son of my\nfather\u2019s partner in Switzerland, and he\u2019s still alive, I know, because I hear from\nhim and see him occasionally. He\u2019s in \u2014 quite old now.",
        "Q: So the four of you, the two adults and the two children \u2014",
        "A: That\u2019s right, that\u2019s right. But they didn\u2019t go all the way with us to Krakow. They\n\u2014 my parents then picked us up in Switzerland.",
        "Q: In Switzerland.",
        "A: And then we went to Krakow, and they of course stayed. He lived in\nSwitzerland.",
        "Q: Do you remember being very frightened as a child doing this?",
        "A: Not at all.",
        "Q: Did you \u2014\nApril 22, 1994",
        "A: Not \u2014 no, because I think we told we were going to go somewhere and meet my\nparents, or \u2014 no, I don\u2019t remember it at all. The only thing I do remember from that\ntrip was that \u2014 that I was surprised that we were going with them, and that my\nparents didn\u2019t come. I was a little surprised, but I can\u2019t say that I was surprised\n[indecipherable] I don\u2019t remember it well.",
        "Q: Do you have any recollection of being frightened or \u2014 in Austria once the\nanschluss happened?",
        "A: No, not at all, no.",
        "Q: Again, you were very young.",
        "A: Not at all, no.",
        "Q: And were you aware of that \u2014",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: You weren\u2019t, no, okay. So then you went through Switzerland to Krakow.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And where \u2014 a-a-and where did you settle? Did you settle in town, where did\nyou live?",
        "A: We \u2014- my father and mother had an apartment because there, as I said, they spent\na lot of time in Krakow as well. They had a large apartment right above the bank.\nThe bank was on the main floor of this building, and our apartment was on the\nApril 22, 1994\nsecond floor. And it was a corner building, so the apartment went all the way\naround the corner.",
        "Q: Do you know what street you were on?",
        "A: Yes, it was called Sarego, and corner of Gertrudy. It was right near what\u2019s\nknown the Planty, which is the moat that surrounds Krak\u00e9w, which is now a park,\nor at \u2014 and was at that time, as well. It had been a moat during medieval times, and\nit then was turned into a park.",
        "Q: And then what was your daily life then like?",
        "A: There, I begin to remember that my mother was nervous.",
        "Q: Did she ever tell you why?",
        "A: Jittery. No, nobody ever told us why. This was the year before the war, life was\nquite normal in \u2014 in other respects for us, but I remember that she was nervous\nbecause she would take me out sometimes, and if I didn\u2019t \u2014 like I was terribly\nfrightened of thunderstorms, and \u2014 and rains, and I was once out with my mother,\nshe took me and \u2014 and a thunderstorm came and she was terribly upset with me\nbecause I cried and screamed. And I remember feeling that it \u2014 things were not as\nnice as they used to be, but I can\u2019t really put my finger on it in any way, no.",
        "Q: And so, what was a daily routine for you?\nApril 22, 1994",
        "A: I don\u2019t quite remember, I think just going to \u2014 to the park, and having this new\ngoverness who \u2014 the language was a bit of a problem, even though we learned very,\nvery quickly. I remember my brother saying some things in Polish that were very\nfunny, and everybody laughed at them. And they were direct translations from\nGerman, I\u2019m sure I did that as well. And I remember, as I said, some of my\ngrandparents coming and visiting, and us visiting them. I remember that the\nchildren who had grown up in Poland, my cousins, behaved very differently\ntowards my grandparents from the way we were told to behave. Like they \u2014 they\nwould kiss their hands, my mother didn\u2019t let us do that, so we were different. I\nremember being different. Actually, I remember that all my life, being different.\nAnd so the routine I think was just to \u2014 to go to the park and to eat and to sleep and\nto go out for walks, and nothing in particular. No school or anything like that.",
        "Q: So you \u2014 did you have any contact with non-Jewish children?",
        "A: No, no. Actually, I don\u2019t remember any contact with any children except my\ncousins occasionally. Even that was not encouraged, it was \u2014 my parents were not \u2014\nmy parents were not that family conscious, I would say. That \u2014 you know, it wasn\u2019t\nthe famil \u2014 because they lived from far away and because they \u2014 my father was very\nestablished and very worldly. And before he married my mother he already lived all\nover the world and so on. Their lifestyle was different from my parents\u2019 relatives in\nApril 22, 1994\nKrakow and therefore, I think they didn\u2019t always spend a lot of time together. My\nmother was close to her brother, who will appear later.",
        "Q: Okay. And then when was the next change, from going to the \u2014",
        "A: I should add also that my mother was to her own par \u2014 actually, my mother was\nclose to her own family, but I think she lost some contact while she was living\naway, and \u2014 but she was closer to her family than maybe my father was to his.\nOkay.",
        "Q: Okay, and then when was the next change in your daily \u2014",
        "A: Oh, the next change I remember very, very distinctly was when the war broke\nout. And that was September 1\u2018, 1939, and I do remember the terrible commotion\nand screaming and yelling and peop \u2014 and packing, and \u2014",
        "Q: Where were you that day?",
        "A: I can\u2019t remember the exact day, but I was certainly at home, which I described\nbefore, and my parents were very nervous, and everybody was packing. We were all\nat home and \u2014 and we were \u2014 th \u2014 we \u2014 my father had a large car and my \u2014 I guess\nsomebody else had a car, but I remember there was a lot of discussion about who\nwas going to go in which car and how many things we can take and where we\nshould go. And in the end we ended up in this car with my father\u2019s, I guess sister\nand my cousin who was much older, she was 14. And her father was the director of\nApril 22, 1994\nthe branch in Krak\u00e9w, so he was the one who was most closely associated with my\nfather in business. That was his brother-in-law, and they were with us in the car.\nAnd \u2014",
        "Q: What were their names?",
        "A: Their names was \u2014 her name was li \u2014 my cousin\u2019s name was Stefunia(ph),\nwhich is Stefanie(ph), and the last name was Raab, r-a-a-b, and her father\u2019s name\nwas Leon Raab. And \u2014 and my aunt, was my father\u2019s younger sister, her name was\nEugenia, and we went in this car for a while, and the next spot where we were\nsupposed to stop was \u2014 I don\u2019t remember the name of the small town, it may come\nback to me. But it was the hometown of this new powe \u2014 Polish Jewish governess\nthat they hired when we came from \u2014 from Vienna. And \u2014",
        "Q: What was her name?",
        "A: Amalia(ph) \u2014 we called her Tetta(ph), because we called all our governesses\nTetta(ph), which was evolve \u2014 which was baby talk for schweste in German, and\nthen they all became Tettas(ph). So her name was Tetta(ph), just like every other\none, and her parents came from this little town, which must have been a little bit\neast of Krakow, because we were definitely going east.",
        "Q: You were seven years old. What did you take with you?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember. Whatever they let me or didn\u2019t let me, I don\u2019t remember.\nApril 22, 1994",
        "Q: Okay. Do you remember being frightened?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: In the car?",
        "A: Frightened, uncomfortable. Everybody was nervous, it was tight, it was a long\ntrip. There was a lot of discussion, among my parents particularly, as to where to\ngo, and my father, who was very much of an optimist, unfortunately did not size up\nthe situation very well, and thought it would pass in some way, thought that we\nwould be comfortable at the \u2014 at the home of this governess, because her parents\nwere there, and because there would be food there and sh \u2014 and so on, and my\nmother, who was arguing that this was stupid, that as \u2014 that we shouldn\u2019t stop\nanywhere and we should just go straight to the border with Romania, that was what\nmany people did, and better than we did. But my father felt that it was not\nnecessary, it was a panic, it was \u2014 also, I should actually rectify this. We did not\nleave September first, we left September third, because my father insisted on\nstaying three days in Krakow aft \u2014 when the war began, because people were\ncoming to the bank to get money out, and he felt he couldn\u2019t leave and disappoint\nthem. So, we waited two \u2014 two days or three days, which was also somewhat fatal.\nSo, I remember a lot of argument about leaving late. Was a lot of tension. That I\nremember, there was a lot of tension.\nApril 22, 1994",
        "Q: What \u2014 do you remember what it meant to you as a child that the Germans had\ninvaded Poland? Did that mean anything to you?",
        "A: No, it didn\u2019t mean anything except this panic that \u2014 that just sort of rained\naround me, I didn\u2019t know why.",
        "Q: That was the atmosphere of it.",
        "A: It was more the atmosphere, I didn\u2019t have any concept of what the Germans \u2014",
        "Q: What was happening.",
        "A: \u2014 were, why everybody was scared, no, definitely not. Children were not as\nincluded in those days as they are now, in Poland. We were very sheltered, and I\nnever, for instance, ate with my parents before the war. So, you know, we led very\nmuch a separate existence. So we always ate in our room. So I really don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: Did you go to your governesses house?",
        "A: Yes, we did. We did, and we must have been there \u2014 and my timing will be\nconfused, because I don\u2019t know, we must have been there two or three days. And\nthen of course, the war progressed, and I remember there was the first bombing was\nthere, there were \u2014 you know, there were siren, there were planes, we went to some\ncellar. There was a commotion, 1t was crowded in her house. And I don\u2019t know how\nlong we were there, probably a few days, and then we started moving east again.\nApril 22, 1994\nAnd again in the same car, and all in all, we were, I think, 14 people, between that\ncar and my uncles car, I think. That means on my father\u2019s side.",
        "Q: So you \u2014 you said you had gone into the shelter during the bombing.",
        "A: Yeah, there was a bombing, and I remember a lot of commotion and going into \u2014",
        "Q: Was that a terribly frightening experience for you?",
        "A: Yes, because it was noisy. It was very, very, you know, that the siren was noisy,\nthe bombs were noisy, the planes coming low, and it was \u2014 yes, that was \u2014",
        "Q: You saw \u2014 you actually saw planes?",
        "A: You did see planes, yes, yes. And that was frighten \u2014 frightening. I must say, I\nwas very frightened of bombing throughout the war. Some people were more \u2014\nsome children were more, some were less, I was always very frightened of\nbombing. To me it was worse than lightning; I was frightening of lightning and this\nwas like, you know, amplified lightening. So, I was always afraid of that.",
        "Q: And then you continued on?",
        "A: Then we continued on in two cars, and \u2014",
        "Q: This is still the two families?",
        "A: Yes, but now I may \u2014 getting confused. I remember our car, but then my\nmother\u2019s brother somehow was there too, and he was in another car with his family,\nand I guess my mother\u2019s sister and her two sons, and there was a lot of family at\nApril 22, 1994\nthat point, and we were in two cars, and we headed east. And then I remember the\nnext stop was some sort of an abandoned house, where the people had fled. It was\nnot a Jewish house, it was like an estate. And 1t was abandoned and we \u2014 it was big,\nand we were very happy to find shelter there, and we stayed there a couple of days.\nAnd by that time it was difficult to get gasoline, and so my uncle went out to try to\nget gasoline, they got gasoline. And then there was a commotion; my father was\nready to stay as usual, and then my father \u2014 but then he was convinced that he \u2014 that\nwe shouldn\u2019t stay, and in the meantime we had news \u2014 we already saw, I remember,\nPolish soldiers who were either deserting, or their units had been broken up, they\nwere running. And we knew that the front was not doing very well, and the\nGermans were advancing, so then we went, again, east. And I don\u2019t know how\nmany days this whole trip took, but it took a few days. When it \u2014",
        "Q: How about food, did you have enough food?",
        "A: We -\u2014 on the way, we bought \u2014 I guess we had some money, we bought food, and\nin this house that was abandoned, we found food. I remember that was one reason\nwhy we stayed there for a few days, that there was plenty of food there. And then\nwe went on and the next memory I have was of a little town called Zwatruf(ph),\nwhich was already in eastern Poland. And there we \u2014 there we got into some\napartment that belonged to some Jewish people. It might have been somebody my\nApril 22, 1994\nfather knew, I don\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t know who they were. But there I remember a big\ndiscussion between \u2014 a big more than discussion, a fight between my uncle and my\nfather, because it was \u2014 by that time it was \u2014 I remember that it was the first Jewish\nholiday, it was Rosh Hashanah, and my father decided to stay over the holiday and\nthen continue to the Romanian border, because that was sort of the ultimate goal,\nthat everybody thought we \u2014 one should go to. And my uncle felt that we should go\nimmediately, and this is nonsense to start sitting and waiting. And \u2014 but then my\nfather wasn\u2019t well, he didn\u2019t feel well, and we stayed. And we stayed there, I think,\nover the holidays, and maybe a couple of days longer. I don\u2019t remember how long\nwe were there, but it was a few days. And then, because he didn\u2019t feel well, we did\nnot go to the Romanian border til much, much later.",
        "Q: What happened in between?",
        "A: In between I just remember that we were living in \u2014 in very uncomfortable\nconditions and everybody was discussing when and where we should go, that\u2019s all I\nremember. But it was like a layover, we were just there waiting to \u2014 to decide what\nnext. That\u2019s all I remember.",
        "Q: And then you \u2014 your \u2014 you continued \u2014",
        "A: And then eventually, yes, my father was feeling better. I later found out that it\nwas a gallbladder attack. He had gallbladder problems, I didn\u2019t know what they\nApril 22, 1994\nwere at the time. So that delayed us. Again it was the Jewish holidays originally,\nthat we were supposed to wait just for two days and then he didn\u2019t feel well, so it \u2014 I\ndon\u2019t know how long we were there. But anyway, then we went to a place called\nKolomyia which was on the border, not far from the border. And there I think we\nstayed with \u2014 I don\u2019t know, in somebody\u2019s house, wasn\u2019t too uncomfortable. And\nwe had \u2014 by then the borders had been closed, they were already guarded. The\nconfusion was somewhat over. The Russians had occupied eastern Poland, the\nGermans had occupied western Poland. This was already after the three weeks that\nPoland defended itself. And at that point I remember we were in Kolomyia and we\nwere waiting there to go to Romania. And by that time there were some guides, and\npeople who would help, for money, would help you cross and so on, but you had to\nwait, because they couldn\u2019t take too many people at the same time. And at that time,\nI even remember that they did put me in a school, because I \u2014 I remember sitting\nthere and making whole rows of As and Bs on lined paper. And we were there for\nthree months.",
        "Q: This was your first school?",
        "A: This was my first school. And I remember writing As and Bs and straight lines. I\nremember that.",
        "Q: And what kind of school was it?\nApril 22, 1994",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember so much the school itself as having to write these long lines of\nthe same letter. It was a public school in this little town Kolomyia. And since we\nwere there, and they just sent us to school. Not us, my brother didn\u2019t go, he was too\nyoung, I did. So I went to first grade.",
        "Q: Were they non \u2014 non Jewish schools?",
        "A: Non-Jewish children, yes. Po \u2014 it was a Polish school.",
        "Q: Polish school.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And by then your Polish was good enough?",
        "A: By then I could speak, yes, because we were there already a year, and with this \u2014\nthis last Tetta(ph) hardly spoke any German, that was why they hired her, and so\nyes, yes; children learn very quickly.",
        "Q: What were your classmates actions towards you? Was there any problem that\nyou \u2014",
        "A: No, no, I don\u2019t remember any at all, no.",
        "Q: And no incidents on the street, talking on the street?",
        "A: No, no, no, no, no, we just lived there. No, I don\u2019t \u2014",
        "Q: Was it a Jewish village, or \u2014\nApril 22, 1994",
        "A: Kolomyia apparently, this I learned later, was a very Jewish town, full of Jews.\nSo maybe our neighbors and everybody was Jewish. I really don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t\nknow, I \u2014 I wasn\u2019t aware of it one way or the other.",
        "Q: So you remember these three months as relatively calm?",
        "A: Calm. Absolutely, relatively calm, yes. And then one ma \u2014 one day my mother\ntold us that my brother and my father were going to cross the border beca \u2014 an-and\ngo, and leave and then she and I would follow a few days later. You couldn\u2019t cross\nin large groups. It was done by [indecipherable] and my \u2014 my father was supposed\nto go with his brother-in-law, and he did, as a matter of fact, and my brother. Fo \u2014\nwhy the men went ahead, wha-wha-what this decision was made on, I don\u2019t know,\nbut the idea was that they would go ahead and then my mother and I would follow. I\ndo know that my aunt and my cousin, who was with us originally in the car, had\ngone directly to the border when my father was delayed by his illness, and they\nwere already in Romania. And that\u2019s why maybe her husband, who was my\nfather\u2019s brother-in-law, was supposed to go first with him, and I guess they decided\nto take my brother, so that my mother wouldn\u2019t have to go with two children. I\ndon\u2019t know what the reasoning was, but that\u2019s how it was.",
        "Q: So this is what, December 1939?",
        "A: This must be by now about December 1939.\nApril 22, 1994",
        "Q: And so they \u2014 the first group of men left?",
        "A: Maybe November. Because I don\u2019t remember snow yet. I think it might have\nbeen November still.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Yeah, the first group left.",
        "Q: And you were left with your mother.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Was that upsetting to you, that your brother and your father left?",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t particularly remember it as being upsetting, because there wasn\u2019t that\nmuch time to be upset or not upset, because very soon, maybe on the next day, we\nlearned that they had been captured on the border. So, we never followed. So I \u2014\nthat was upsetting, because I remember my mother crying and that was very\nupsetting, yes. And also the \u2014 the \u2014 the idea that my five year old brother was now\nin jail with my father and \u2014 and she didn\u2019t know where and how and so on. We her\n\u2014 we learned from the guy that that\u2019s what had happened, or [indecipherable] I\ndon\u2019t \u2014 I wasn\u2019t there when she learned about it, but \u2014 or at least I don\u2019t remember,\nbut I remember her crying, and it was quite awful.",
        "Q: A-And then?\nApril 22, 1994",
        "A: And then what happened was that she tried to contact the Russian authorities to\nsee if she could see my father, or at least her goal was to pick up my little brother\nfrom jail. So she tried, how she tried I don\u2019t know, she must have gone there and\npleaded with them. I wasn\u2019t with her, she left me at home \u2014 at home, I don\u2019t know,\nwith the landlady or something, I don\u2019t remember that part. [break] And then she\nwas able to \u2014 they told her that \u2014 that they would release my brother, and she should\ncome and pick him up.",
        "Q: How far away was your father and your brother from your town?",
        "A: Very close, because this town was on the border. So it\u2019s very possible that he\nwas in jail right in that town, that they brought him from \u2014 the few kilometers from\nthe border back there, I don\u2019t know, I never saw him. But my mother went and\nbrought my brother bra \u2014 back. So then she had both of us, but my father was in jail\nand she had no contact with him. And then she decided to go \u2014 to go and join her\nown family, and they were in Zwatruf(ph), and by her own family I mean her\nparents and her older sister and my uncle, meaning her brother, and his wife and\nthree children. And her sister\u2019s two children. Eventually we ended up being 14\npeople. And they had an apartment or some way of living in \u2014 in this town called\nZwatruf(ph), and we joined them there.",
        "Q: How did you get there?\nApril 22, 1994",
        "A: And \u2014 don\u2019t remember. I imagine we either took a train \u2014 probably a train, but I\ndo not remember. All I remember 1s that they were all very, very nice to us, and that\nwe lived there with them, and it was crowded, but it was peaceful and nice, for a\nshort time. And my uncle would go to Lwow, which was not too far away, a few\nhours away, I presume. And he would come occasionally, and he wa \u2014 got a job in\nLwow and he was making money. In other words, he was earning, he was the only\none who was earning and he had a job, and he had friends and connections, but he\nleft his family, his parents and so on in this place, and we were with them.",
        "Q: Did your brother tell you anything \u2014 and a gra \u2014 I \u2014 I do know he was five years\nold \u2014 did he tell you anything about his prison experience with your father?",
        "A: No, no, I don\u2019t remember anything.",
        "Q: So your brother did not remember that experience that \u2014",
        "A: He either didn\u2019t, or he may have talked about it like a five year old would, and I\ndon\u2019t remember what he said, or I don\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: So there you were this big group.",
        "A: There we were, this big group, and then \u2014 and we did not go to school any more\non the \u2014 I, or an \u2014 my cousins. And then one night there was a big commotion,\nyelling and screaming and banging and that\u2019s when the Russians came with \u2014 with \u2014\nwhat do they call it, the trucks, and they loaded us on trucks and took us to the\nApril 22, 1994\ntrains, and deported us. I do remember \u2014 I'll go back a little bit \u2014 during the time\nwhen we were there with our big family group, there was a lot of discussion\nwhether to take Russian citizenship or not. The Russians offered passports to all the\npeople who had fled from western Poland into eastern Poland, they could become\nRussian citizens. There was a lot of discussion because one didn\u2019t know whether to\ndo that or not to, because if you did that, it seemed to us \u2014 at least that\u2019s what the\ngrownups were saying, then we would never, ever have a chance of leaving what\nwas occupied Russian territory, or Russia itself, because we were Russian citizens.\nSo that was sort of giving up. On the other hand, the risk of remaining with the\nPolish passports, which we had, was that then we would be treated badly, possibly\ndeported. There were talks about deportations to Siberia, and that was a different\nrisk, but I know that we did not take the Russian passports because we thought that\nwas like abdicating altogether. So we were deported, all 14 of us.",
        "Q: What was it like?",
        "A: That I remember. That I already \u2014 there I have vivid memories. It was \u2014 it was\ncargo cars or cattle cars, and we were 70 people in one of them, in each one of\nthem. And \u2014 and the conditions were very, very bad. There was one in the center of\nthis big cattle car, there was one pipe which was the toilet, and it wasn\u2019t even\ncovered or \u2014 or \u2014 or separated. So I remember that some people gave some blankets\nApril 22, 1994\nor spreads or sheets, I don\u2019t remember, and those were somehow hung up there and\nmy mother was rather witty, kept saying she could tell exactly from the feet as to\nwho was in there, and that was a big \u2014 with the children, for us it was a sort of a\ngame about guessing who was in there. But I remember that very distinctly. And the\ntrain would stop quite often and then the Russians would come in and they didn\u2019t\nmistreat us or anything, they didn\u2019t even come in. They would open the door and\nfrom the platform they would hand us the food. They brought big pots with \u2014 and\nmostly it was soup, I remember, some sort of soup. It was not great, but they did\nbring it twice a day over there. And also, we used to stop a great deal and it took us\n\u2014 we went all the way to \u2014 very far, we were deported all the way to \u2014 yeah,\nKutskaya Oblast, which was near Yakutsk which is almost as far as you can go\nwithout going to Manchuria, I guess. And it took us six weeks to get there. So we\ntra \u2014 but six weeks with a great number of stops, because they did stop all the time,\nthey stopped at different stations, I imagine when they needed the tracks they would\nput us on a side track, but I know we stopped a lot.",
        "Q: Okay, let\u2019s talk a little bit more about that journey. Were there men, women and\nchildren together in a car?",
        "A: Yes, yes. All the families were together. And one additional thing that I\nremember from that trip was that my brother got scarlet fever during that trip. And\nApril 22, 1994\nhe was very sick, then my cousin got it. And they tried to isolate them in one corner\nof this car, and my mother was going \u2014 absolutely falling apart, because \u2014 I mean,\nshe was brave, but she was carrying on quite a bit because he was so sick. And there\nwas even a doctor in another car who came, and my mother used to tell much later\nthat he said it would take a miracle for my brother to survive, because he was\nsupposed to be on a salt free diet, or whatever one does with scarlet fever. And he\nwas quite sick. He was very sick. And so we were families together, yes; men,\nwomen and children.",
        "Q: And what \u2014 was there any place to sit down, were there seat \u2014",
        "A: On the floor, there were \u2014 and suitcases.",
        "Q: And suitcases.",
        "A: On the suitcases, yes. And then things were spread on the floor to \u2014 to make\nsleeping \u2014 to make sleeping possible.",
        "Q: So were you able to stretch out?",
        "A: Yes, we were able to sort of, like sardines, one next to the other, we \u2014 we had \u2014 I\nremember sleeping, yes.",
        "Q: And how much light was in the car?",
        "A: There was some light from the windows, which were high up. There must have\nbeen light because I remember that my mother, to keep us busy, this is one of the\nApril 22, 1994\ngreat things she did, the girls, she taught me how to darn socks on that trip. And\nwhen we ran out of socks with holes, I remember she made holes in socks and then\nI darned them over and over again. And I became very proficient at it, so I \u2014 there\nmust have been light, to do that.",
        "Q: Did you have any special doll or toy with you? Was there something \u2014",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t remember that \u2014 anything like that.",
        "Q: You don\u2019t remember bringing anything that was special.",
        "A: The only amusing incident I remember from that trip, I mean, there were many,\nthat as strange as it seems in all these horrible situations there was always\nsomething humorous. And I remember that when we stopped in all the different \u2014 in\nall the different, I presume small towns or wherever we stopped, there was\ninevitably an enormous statue of Stalin and Lenin on the platform, and they were\nusually life-size. And one day we stopped at dusk, and usually when we stopped,\nsomebody, very often my mother, would climb up on two or three suitcases to reach\nthe little window, that\u2019s how I remember they were high up, and try to get \u2014 ask the\npassersby to give us some food or anything. Water, food, whatever we were wa \u2014 sh\n\u2014 literally begging. And one day she was sa \u2014 she turned around and said to\neverybody, well today we are sure to get what I asked for. Says, do you know who I\njust spoke to? I spoke to Stalin in person. It was \u2014 she was talking to this\nApril 22, 1994\n[indecipherable] and suddenly she realized that it was one of the statues. So\nanyway, often these peasants did hand something over, and she learned a few words\nof Russian, laybeonki(ph) being children, and you know, I remember her always\nsaying about the children. I always felt that like, that we were the \u2014 the cause of all\nevil, because th \u2014 we were used for \u2014 for that kind of begging. Like we were the\nonly reason why she \u2014 she did it.",
        "Q: What was the atmosphere inside the car? Were people helping each other, were\nthey supportive of each other?",
        "A: I remember arguments about space. I do remember arguments about, you know,\nth \u2014 particularly when my brother got sick and they \u2014 my \u2014 my mother and \u2014 and\nthen later, a few days later, my cousin got sick, and there were arguments even\nabout \u2014 between my mother an-an-and the mother of this cousin, and \u2014 who was her\nsister-in-law, about \u2014 because I guess everybody was so anxious. And I remember\nwhen they wanted to isolate the sick children, they had to \u2014 needed space from\nanother family, so they displaced them a little, and tried to tell them the space here\nwas just as good, whatever was left when they moved the other children. There\nwere arguments about space, definitely. That I remember. On \u2014 in other ways, I\nthink there was also support. It wasn\u2019t a constant argument, but there was tension\nabout space, physical space.\nApril 22, 1994",
        "Q: You said that the train made a lot of stops. Were you able to get out of the car\nand move around?",
        "A: No, no, no.",
        "Q: You were inside the car for \u2014",

        "Q: And \u2014",
        "A: The doors never opened unless they brought us food. So that\u2019s why my mother\nalways \u2014",
        "Q: How often wou \u2014 did they bring the food?",
        "A: I think she \u2014 I don\u2019t remember it, but I think two or three times a day. They did\ngive us food twice a day for sure.",
        "Q: What kind of food did they give you?",
        "A: Soup mostly. Soup mostly, black bread and hot water. Kipyatok they called it.",
        "Q: And did you just wear the same clothes the whole time?",
        "A: I think so. I think so. I don\u2019t remember changing or washing. There was some\nwashing, but I don\u2019t remember how. I don\u2019t remember.\nApril 22, 1994",
        "Q: Did you play with the other children, word games or \u2014",
        "A: Yes, alot. And my mother told us stories and we darned the socks and we did\nword games and finger games, and yes, a lot, and \u2014 and \u2014",
        "Q: What was the weather like during your journey?",
        "A: It was \u2014 I don\u2019t remember it as being cold or anything, because we were\ndeported, I think in June. I do remember that I turned eight in \u2014 when \u2014 after, right\nafter we arrived in Siberia. So we must have arrived around August. And there it\nwas very, very hot, because they have a short, hot summer.",
        "Q: During the journey, was there any talk of people trying to escape?",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t remember any \u2014",
        "Q: That you were aware of.",
        "A: No, I wa\u2014I-\u2014no, I don\u2019t think at that point \u2014 there was a lot of talk people trying\nto escape, and I do remember that later on when we were already settled in Siberia,\nbut not from the train, I don\u2019t remember that, no.",
        "Q: Was there any difference in the actions between the men \u2014 of the men, or of the\nwomen \u2014 any di-\u2014 any difference in behavior of the men or the women on \u2014 in the\ncar?",
        "A: Not that Iam aware of, no, no, I don\u2019t remember. I remember differences in\npeople close to me. I remember my mother se \u2014 actions and attitudes were very\nApril 22, 1994\ndifferent from my aunt\u2019s actions and attitude. Some people despaired. There was a\nlot of despair and crying and so on. My mother did not succumb to that, and I\nremember thinking that she was different, because she really did not do that. She \u2014\nshe was much more resourceful, and much more \u2014 well, she used her charm, her\nintelligence, she was very clever, and so on, to \u2014 to achieve something, to gain\nthings for herself and for us, but mainly for us, so \u2014 mainly for my brother was sick.\nBut \u2014 and the others sort of just despaired. Also, there was a lot of talk like we\u2019ll\nnever get out of here, and this is the end, and my mother arguing that this is not so,\nthat it\u2019s not the end because we really don\u2019t know what \u2014 that the \u2014 you know, she\ndidn\u2019t give in to that.",
        "Q: And your memories of your feelings then, during that trip?",
        "A: I don\u2019t have any memories of my feelings, except maybe some fear of the\nuncertain, but nothing other than that, no. No, I don\u2019t even remember being \u2014 I\nremember being very crowded, but I don\u2019t remember being very uncomfortable. I\ndon\u2019t remember, you know, any physical pain or anything like that, no.",
        "Q: Do you remember being hungry?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Do you rememb \u2014\nApril 22, 1994",
        "A: I think that the food came fairly regularly, and my mother probably gave us\nenough, because I remember that people did say that they were hungry. But I think\nshe again made sure that \u2014 that I had enough. I was not hungry.",
        "Q: And you weren\u2019t cold, because the weather \u2014",
        "A: No.",

        "A: We were not cold, no, no \u2014",

        "Q: Now your father wa-was not with you, he was still in prison?",
        "A: Yes, and we had absolutely, after my mother picked up my brother, she had no\nmore contact, no \u2014 nor did we have any knowledge whether he \u2014 what happened to\nhim. And that was something I do remember, because she talked about that a lot,\nthat we didn\u2019t know whether he was dead or alive, or that he was in jail, where he\nwas, nothing. Absolutely nothing. And she talked a lot about that.",
        "Q: Did you and your brother miss him very much?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know whether we missed him. I guess, yes, I think that th-the uncertainty,\nth-the insecurity that he was gone, and her despair over that. That was the only time\nshe showed despair was when she talked about not knowing what happened to him.\nApril 22, 1994\nSo that, I think affected us more than the \u2014 just that he wasn\u2019t there. Again, I must\nemphasize that we didn\u2019t see that much of our parents when we were very young,\ncause he was not, you know, a father like today. He was a father was in the office,\nwho came in maybe a few minutes before we went to sleep. So I really didn\u2019t \u2014 he\nwas not directly involved in our care, daily lives, so I don\u2019t, you know, it wasn\u2019t\n[inaudible]",
        "Q: Did \u2014 you said the journey took six weeks.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Did it seem like more than six weeks?",
        "A: Yes, it seemed endless. Yes, it seemed like a very long time, endless, yeah, that\nit seemed. And also, you must remember that we had absolutely no idea as to where\nwe are being taken. So we didn\u2019t know whether it would take one week, six weeks,\nfour weeks, and also where our final destination was we had no idea, so it was just\ngoing and going and going. Nobody knew where we were going.",
        "Q: But the guards treated you all right \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: \u2014 well, no problem with that.",
        "A: No, no, no, no problem. They brought the food and left.",
        "Q: And then finally you arrived.\nApril 22, 1994",
        "A: Finally we arrived, and it was very hot there, I remember that, and there was a\nlot of like wheat, or very tall grass where we arrived. It was like fields and forests.\nWe were actually in the middle of the Taiga, which are these enormous forests in\nRussia, and \u2014 in Siberia. And there were barracks, we did not have to build our\nown. There was like a settlement there waiting for us.",
        "Q: Wha \u2014 you arrive, th-the car stopped, and you got out.",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "Q: Do you remember that moment?",
        "A: I do remember that \u2014 that it was wonderful to get out.",
        "Q: I was going to say, what were your feelings \u2014",
        "A: Yes, it was wonderful, and I remember being very impressed with this tall grass,\nwhich was very tall, it was almost as tall as I was. And then we walked through this\ngrass, and then there were these houses, which I remember seeing, they were like\nhuts, and there were like 10 or 12 or 15 maybe of them, I don\u2019t know how many.\nAnd there was a central one where we all had to go and line up, and they assigned\nthese houses. And I remember that my mother was very anxious for this whole\nfamily, we were 14 people, our family, to get our own house. And most of these\nhouses housed between 16 or 20 people. And her big accomplishment was that we\ndid get one of these houses just for us.\nApril 22, 1994",
        "Q: How was your health at that point?",
        "A: Mine was fine.",
        "Q: How was your brother?",
        "A: My brother was better by then, but very, very weak, and very emaciated. And \u2014\nbut he was better, he was no longer critical, and his fever, I think, had gone by then.\nAnd my health was fine.",
        "Q: Were there many other children from other families \u2014",
        "A: Yes, there were \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 in this group of people?",
        "A: Yes, there were many children. There were many children, and after we all got\nsettled, and this I remember also very distinctly, after they allocated these different\nhuts to different \u2014 to \u2014 to all these people, and everybody was more or less settled,\nthey \u2014 you had to register again for work. The adults had to register for work, and\nthe children had to register for school. And there were many children, but they were\n\u2014 it seemed that they didn\u2019t have enough children who belonged into second grade,\nwhich was where I should have gone. And I knew by then how to read and write a\nlittle, because I had learned \u2014 three months I was in the \u2014 1n that school, and maybe\nI learned on my \u2014 by myself, or whatever, but \u2014 but I didn\u2019t know Russian, of\ncourse. Now this school was going to be in Russian, and I remember that I \u2014 they\nApril 22, 1994\nhad a first grade and a third grade, or enough children to \u2014 for those age groups, and\nthey were in the \u2014 somehow in the same room, there was the \u2014 why they had them\nin the same room, I guess they didn\u2019t have enough teachers, or they didn\u2019t have\nenough children, and I remember that they were \u2014 and I was in first grade. And with\na \u2014 that was one of the things that they did very quickly. I remember we barely got\nthere and we \u2014 and they made us go to school, and they made the adults work. And\nwe all got like an I.D. card. The children got them and the working adults. And\nunless you had that, you could not buy food. By then you were buying food, they\nhad like a dispensary. But you had to show your I.D. work card or school card to\nget your rations. You couldn\u2019t just come with rubles and buy it.",
        "Q: Where did you get the \u2014 where did the adults get the money from?",
        "A: From working. They were compensated, yes.",
        "Q: They got paid. Oh, they got paid for working.",
        "A: They got paid, yes.",
        "Q: What were the sleeping arrangements like?",
        "A: That I remember very well, too, because they were \u2014 it was called a pritcha(ph).\nIt was a \u2014 like a bunk made out of wood, and it was right above the floor, and it was\nlong. It was on the floor, and it was made out of boards. And so we, all 14 of us,\nslept on this one long thing, and it was very tight. And so, when I remember that\nApril 22, 1994\nwhen one person turned, everybody turned. And to this day I can\u2019t stand sleeping\nwith anybody, because it just \u2014 I can\u2019t sleep when somebody keeps turning, because\nI turn too. So that was terrible. The sleeping arrangements were very, very tight.\nVery tight.",
        "Q: But you had food.",
        "A: We had some food. We had some food and \u2014 but not adequate food, there were\nshortages of \u2014 there were no \u2014 no vegetables. People started getting scurvy, people\nstarted getting all kinds of \u2014 because they were deficient in \u2014 in so many foods. But\nwe didn\u2019t have \u2014 and we were not starving, but we didn\u2019t have adequate food. But\nvery soon after we arrived there, we started getting food parcels, because \u2014 I have to\nbacktrack. My uncle was not deported. He was the only one of my mother\u2019s family,\nbecause he was working in Lwow, as I had said before, and he was not home that\nnight. So he was not deported. And he, when he heard that his whole family was\ndeported, his three children, his parents, his sisters, and his wife, he wanted to run\nafter the train. He thought he would go and run after the train. And his friends in\nLwow told him this was stupid \u2014 a stupid thing to do because you would get on\nsome train \u2014 if you go there, to the station, they\u2019ll deport you, but by no means will\nyou be on the same train. You may never find them. If you stay in Lw\u00e9w, you may\nbe able to help them, but this way it \u2014 1t \u2014 1t would be ludicrous. So he stayed. And\nApril 22, 1994\nhe had a very good job with the Russians, and so he made money and he sent\nparcels to us. How he knew where we were, I don\u2019t know, but he did \u2014 we got the\nparcels. We were [phone ringing- break] So we got the parcels \u2014 as a matter of\nfact, I don\u2019t \u2014 it \u2014 it still 1s a puzzle to me how he knew where he was, or whether\nhe just sent them by name to Siberia and by mira-miracle we got them, but we did\nget them. And I remember that he sent sugar and fat and tea and coffee and things\nlike that. I remember particularly the sugar and the fat.",
        "Q: What kind of fat?",
        "A: And that\u2019s an interesting story too. The fat was some kind of lard or chicken fat.\nAnd the problem with that was that my grandmother was still very religious. And\nmy uncle, who was not religious any more, and who was a very clever and shrewd\nkind of person, and a very good son and \u2014 and father, and very family-minded, he\nwanted the worst way, because he knew what the conditions there were, that we\nshould all eat this, particularly his mother. And so he himself certified it. And so\nwhat it was, it was he \u2014 after the war he told me that it was just at first he c-couldn\u2019t\nget any kosher fat, and then he just certified it himself. So 1t was different kinds of\nlards, whatever he could get. Goose fat, chicken fat, maybe lard. I don\u2019t know,\nwhatever. And it came, and \u2014",
        "Q: Did \u2014 did this camp that you were in have a specific name?\nApril 22, 1994",
        "A: No, it did not have a specific name, it was a \u2014 I wouldn\u2019t even call it a camp, it\nwas a \u2014 it was a work settlement, it was a \u2014 it was a settlement. They had deportees\nin Siberia fra \u2014 during the \u2014 the \u2014 the purges that they did during Tsar\u2019s time. There\nwere deportees there in the nearest town, who had been deported 11 years before, as\nI remember the number exactly because it always se \u2014 stuck in my mind. And these\npeople had been there for \u2014 political deportees, who had no way of ever getting out,\nat least they thought, and they kept telling us that we would also remain \u2014 these\nwere work settlements \u2014 that we would also remain there forever, because whenever\nwe said well, you know, maybe someday we\u2019ll get out, or after the war, or\nsomething, they used to tell us there\u2019s no hope. So there were \u2014 there were different\n\u2014 this area had been populated by different deportees over the years, just like when I\nwas Yakutsk in nine \u2014 four years, five years ago. They had a lot of deportees from\nthe Tsar\u2019s time, who now are several generations later, and they just stayed there. It\ncould have happened to us, thank God it didn\u2019t.",
        "Q: What did you learn at school?",
        "A: Oh, I learned how to read and write in Russian. And also they had a very \u2014 I\nremember that they had a very strong program of indoctrination of \u2014 Stalin was our\nhero, he was our father, he \u2014 around Christmastime they asked us to pray to God for\ncandy, and we did, and nothing happened of course. And then they asked us to ask\nApril 22, 1994\nStalin, whose portrait was right in front of course, and we got candy. It was the\nonly time we got candy, it was that kind of atmosphere. And it was always glory,\nthe glory of Russia and the glory of Stalin, the glory of communism. That was all\nthe reading material and all of that \u2014 that was what we learned in school, but mainly\nto read and write.",
        "Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember the school as being unpleasant. I do remember \u2014 I \u2014 I\nremember being \u2014 it was difficult, because we had to walk one kilometer. Took us\nabout 10 or 15 minutes, and when it got cold \u2014 because once the snow falls there, it\nnever melts, it \u2014 and they \u2014 we \u2014 they dug like a little trail, and on either side there\nwere banks of the snow, which was tall as I was. And we all got what\u2019s called\nvalenkis, the children got, they were boots made out of a heavy felt. And they\nallocated those for children to go to school in, and I remember walking that\ndistance.",
        "Q: But the subjects that you were learning in school?",
        "A: I learned how to read and write, and I don\u2019t think it was divided by subjects, I\nthink it was just mainly the glory of Russia and reading and writing, that\u2019s all I\nremember of that.",
        "Q: What did you do for pleasure, the children? Anything?\nApril 22, 1994",
        "A: I imagine we played in the snow and it was not terrib \u2014 I don\u2019t remember\nanything for pleasure. Stories, being home, games, running around. Nothing in\nparticular. I mean, nothing organized, or \u2014",
        "Q: Besides the boots they gave you \u2014",
        "A: There were also jackets.",
        "Q: \u2014 did you have enough clothes?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Oh, they gave you clothes.",
        "A: They allocated \u2014 for children, they gave us those lined or interlined jackets and \u2014\nFufaikas, they were called, and working people also got those.",
        "Q: What kind of work did your mother do?",
        "A: They \u2014 in the forest, in the Taiga, women \u2014 men cut branches and trees \u2014 it was\ncleaning the Taiga. It was cleaning the forest. Men cut the branches and the dead\nbranches, and women gathered them and carried them to \u2014 to central sort of spots\nwhere they were burned. So it was to clean out the undergrowth. It was heavy work,\nit was hard work, because you had to carry the branches, and then \u2014 it was hard,\nphysical work. My mother, strangely enough, was very, very pampered and spoiled,\nsaid she, physically she felt very well the \u2014\nEnd of Tape One\nJanuary 5, 1996\nBeginning Tape Two",
        "Q: This is tape two, side one, and we were talking about your arrival in Siberia in\nAugust 1940, when you were eight years old. You were with your mother and\nbrother. And you\u2019ve already described some of the conditions there, but I was\nwondering, what was your first impression when you arrived?",
        "A: We got off the train and sort of a \u2014 in the middle of nowhere, and then I\nremember seeing the huts, and then there was a bit of a scramble among the\npeople, who is going to get which hut. And as we were a group of 14 people, same\nfamily, we did \u2014 we managed to get one hut just for our family, and that I\nremember as being something that everybody thought was a very positive thing.",
        "Q: Can you describe a typical day there?",
        "A: In the beginning there was utter confusion. We had to like register, we had to\nget our food cards. And they told us that we would go to school, children would go\nto school and they\u2019re go \u2014 and the adults would go to work. And then there was\nque \u2014 they talked a lot about what type of work and everybody was sort of \u2014 1t was\nalso a new experience for all of us to have to work. I mean, my mother never\nworked a day in her life, and ma \u2014 and most other women certainly didn\u2019t, and the\ntype of work that they had was heavy, physical work. But the early work was\nactually cutting the \u2014 what was it, the grass. It was tall grass that they cut and they\ngave us these sickles, that\u2019s wha \u2014 th-the \u2014 like knives. And all \u2014 that\u2019s what the\nJanuary 5, 1996\nfirst work was. The children did not do it, we did not do it, the adults did it. And\nthey gathered it and tied it, and it was still very hot when we got there in August, it\nwas very, very hot. It\u2019s a short summer. Soon after that, the typical day was going\nto school. And they did not have enough children to have a second grade, which I\nshould have gone to, cause I already knew how to read and write in Polish, and I\nwas eight years old. So \u2014 but they only had enough children for a first grade and\nfor a third grade, so I was in the first grade, and we started learning Russian. And\nschool was important. They did m-make it absolutely clear that we had to go to\nschool in order to get our food, and school was important, and they were rather\nnice to us in school. The teacher was nice, and they kept telling us about, you\nknow, Stalin and how he was going to take care of us, and how we are going to\nget presents from him, and actually when Christmas came around, they told us that\nwe should pray for candy, and of course we didn\u2019t get any and then we should ask\nStalin and the candy appeared. She distributed it and so on. Actually, this\nparticular incident was very well portrayed in the film \u2014 what was it called?\n\u201cEuropa Europa.\u201d Exactly he had the identical thing happen to him that I\nremember very vividly, the same conversation in school. Anyway, so our typical\ndays, wet \u2014 it very soon got very cold. There\u2019s very \u2014 there\u2019s practically no\ntransition. We started having the first snow by end of September, beginning of\nOctober, and that snow never, ever melts. So when we were walking to school, we\nJanuary 5, 1996\nwere walking like in a \u2014 in a ditch, and on both sides there were these walls of\nsnow that were as tall as I was. It was cut out, so that if walked in, an-and that\nsnow never, ever melted, so \u2014 until the next spring, obviously. And the grown-ups\nwent off and did whatever they were doing, I didn\u2019t see them. And the thing was\nto get some of the wood for us to make fire in the hut. My grandmother sort of\ncooked something. I don\u2019t remember ever being really hungry. We did have some\nfood, and so I don\u2019t remember ever being really hungry. I do remember going to\nthe store and getting \u2014 with those ration cards and getting our allocations. And\nthey were mostly some sort of staples, I think. Certainly no vegetables, no \u2014 no\nfood, no nothing, so that was bad, because we were very deprived of \u2014 of vitamins\nand \u2014 and that kind of nutrition. There was a little town not far away, where from\ntime to time people were summoned for various reasons, and there was always a\ngreat deal of trepidation and fear attached to that, because you didn\u2019t know \u2014 it\nwas usually somebody that they either wanted to recruit for some other work, or it\nwas some oth \u2014 or they suspected somebody of being what they called the\nbourgoi(ph) you know, before the war, and they wanted to look into it. Two\nyoung people from the settlement tried to run away to \u2014 to the Manchurian border,\nwe were not far from Manchuria. It\u2019s pretty far out there. So, a-and they either\nwere caught, or they were \u2014 there was some mystery. I mean, I was only eight\nyears old, but I remember the excitement that thi \u2014 were they caught, weren\u2019t they\nJanuary 5, 1996\ncaught, did they freeze to death, didn\u2019t they freeze to death. But when they were\nmissing, th-th-th-th-the NK VD, which then became the [indecipherable] who\ncame around and asked questions, you know, the Russian secret service, or\nwhatever they were. The police. So there was some contact to \u2014 to that little city,\nwhich was not far away. It was called Auga(ph). And so, the typical day was just,\ngo to work or go to school and eat and sleep. Were a lot of bedbugs, that was a\nterrible pest, and other than that I can\u2019t really remember that much, except big\ndiscussions inside with my \u2014 I had one of my cousins was already 15 years old,\nand he had been quite a good student before the war, and he knew quite a bit of\nhistory, and his sort of view of the situation was that we\u2019ll never get out of there.\nThis is where the Russians send their political enemies, have done so during Tsar\u2019s\ntime and have done so, you know, during the purges, and are doing it now. And\nnone of these people ever get out. And of course my view of history was limited,\nbut I do remember arguments because my mother particularly said you can\u2019t take\nthat kind of point of view, and it doesn\u2019t have necessary to be like that, and we\nwill get out, it\u2019s different. There\u2019s a war and they will be defeated at some point,\nand things will change. Anyway, those discussions I do remember, and I\nremember him saying there\u2019s a Polish saying that these are dreams of a severed\nhead. So, whenever my mother would hold out these optimistic speeches, he\nJanuary 5, 1996\nwould say, these are dreams of a severed head. So that\u2019s what I remember from\nthere.",
        "Q: What do you attribute \u2014 and again I know you were only eight years old \u2014 your\nmother\u2019s optimism to? Was she \u2014 had she always been that \u2014 that way?",
        "A: She \u2014 it was not a stupid optimism, she was very clever, and sophisticated\nwoman, who lived in various places in Europe and so on. I don\u2019t know whether it\nwas just a sort of simplistic optimism, it was the kind of optimism that she had\nthroughout the war later, in much worse circumstances, where she felt that we\nwould survive. And it wasn\u2019t the rosy kind of optimism, it was just her kind of\nfeeling that we would survive. And she was very good \u2014 I now understand it better\nthan I did then, in \u2014 in making us believe it, that I always believed, I \u2014 later on\nalso, that we would survive. And that she had this way of making us feel very\nimportant and very special, because of pre-war connections, because of her\nexperience before the war, because of the way \u2014 because of who my father was. I\nsee it all as \u2014 now as \u2014 not as significant as she thought it was, but it helped\nsurvive the war, so I can\u2019t even fault her. When I became a little older I started\nthinking that maybe she\u2019s exaggerating. But 1t worked.",
        "Q: What did you talk about with friends, or di \u2014 first of all, did you make friends\nthere?\nJanuary 5, 1996",
        "A: No, I only ha \u2014 remember playing and talking and being with my two cousins,\nand they are \u2014 they\u2019re both girls. And sh \u2014 one of them was a year younger than I,\nand one is a year older. And they now live in Israel and I\u2019m still friendly and close\nto them \u2014 no, schoolwork, schoolwork. Who could write \u2014 that\u2019s what we talked\nabout, who could write the lines neater, who could read Russian better, do the\narithmetic. I don\u2019t remember talking about any significant things. No, da-daily \u2014\ndaily occurrence.",
        "Q: Did \u2014 did you go to school on the weekend?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember, probably Saturday, yes, Saturday we went to school, Sunday\nwe didn\u2019t go. There was one free day, I don\u2019t remember what it was.",
        "Q: And what did you do?",
        "A: Stayed inside and played some word games, a lot of word games, because we\ndidn\u2019t have toys. Lots of word games, string games. We had strings, and so I\nremember doing this cat\u2019s cradle. And jumping games like hopscotch, that kind of\nthing. But it was a t \u2014 it was tight quarters and there were no streets. So it was sort\nof all invented, and it was more in the center \u2014 there was a room in the center of\nthat hut, and we sort of played there. It\u2019s hard to say exactly what we did.",
        "Q: And the sleeping conditions were?",
        "A: They \u2014 terrible. There was one long bunk and we all slept on this one long\nbunk, all 14 of us. And this is \u2014 to this day I have a thing about that, because it was\nJanuary 5, 1996\nso tight that when one person turned, everybody had to turn, because you all had\nto be sort of lined up like sardines in the same direction. So it was \u2014 that was very,\nvery un \u2014 bad. And to this day I can\u2019t sleep with anybody because it \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 just\nthe thought of having somebody next to me when I sleep, I can\u2019t stand.",
        "Q: Did you have enough blankets?",
        "A: We used \u2014 I think we covered ourselves also with our clothes, or coats or\njackets and we also slept clothesed. We didn\u2019t sleep in pajamas, we did sleep\nclothesed.",
        "Q: How did you keep yourself clean?",
        "A: Again, I don\u2019t remember, there was th \u2014 yes, I do remember. They heated water\nand they put the \u2014 like a basin or a thing made out of wood, actually, and \u2014 like\nyou see in very old \u2014",
        "Q: Like a bucket?",
        "A: Oh yeah, exactly. And you washed first the bottom and the top or vice-a-versa,\nyes, in the kitchen, when it was warm. And it didn\u2019t happen certainly, every day.\nThere was no bathroom.",
        "Q: And sanitary facilities, toilet?",
        "A: Outside, outside.",
        "Q: Outside.",
        "A: An outhouse.\nJanuary 5, 1996",
        "Q: An outhouse.",
        "A: An outhouse, or \u2014 or you just went anywhere, because it all froze anyway, right\naway, so there was no problem with that. But it was an outhouse. Very cold going\nout. No bathroom inside.",
        "Q: Now you had said earlier that you had been, when you were very young, you\nwere raised by a governess. And obviously the conditions had changed in so many\nways. And so you were with your mother even more so under these derry \u2014 very\ndifficult conditions \u2014",
        "A: Well, there\u2019s an interesting story actually. Both our governess and my cousin\u2019s\ngoverness was deported with us, because they happened to have been with us\nwhen they were \u2014 they still were with us when \u2014 when we got deported. And that\nwas actually interesting, because as soon as we got to Siberia, they were working\ngirls, so they thought that they deserved different conditions from us. They were\nnot capitalists. And particularly my \u2014 my \u2014 our governess apparently was a very si\n\u2014 was a bit of a communist and a socially conscious person, and she \u2014 sh \u2014 they\nleft. The two gir \u2014 the two young women left us, they lived someplace else. One of\nthem I later found out had some sort of a relationship with some local one of the\nguards or something. And one of them apparently did get married there and stayed\nthere and never left Russia. So these were two young girls, and so anyhow, they\nsort of evaporated after we got there, with some bad feelings, because both my\nJanuary 5, 1996\naunt and my mother thought they weren\u2019t very loyal, but they saw this as maybe\nsome sort of an opportunity of not being, you know, employed by these people any\nmore. So I don\u2019t think my \u2014 my mother could pay. It would have been \u2014 if they\nhad stayed it would have been more out of loyalty, and apparently that did not\nhappen.",
        "Q: But my question was, how did this change your relationship with your mother\nnow that it was you and she in close quarters.",
        "A: Very much, very much so. But I think it\u2019s a little bit like \u2014 like \u2014 from what I\nremember, it was more like in a kibbutz, you know? The chil \u2014 everybody was\ntogether, so it was not only my mother who told us what to do, but my aunt and\nmy grandmother, I mean ev-everybody was telling the children what to do. My \u2014\nmy mother was \u2014 my \u2014 the relationship was good, except that she always was very\nconcerned about my brother, who was younger, and who was very \u2014 somewhat\nsickly. And my \u2014 my aunt, my two cousins\u2019 mother was very, very strict. So I felt\nsort of very privileged because my mother was not very strict. And \u2014 not strict at\nall, as a matter of fact, she was not a disciplinarian and she \u2014 we had it \u2014 we had a\ngood relationship. It was only difficult to watch her because she was terribly\nconcerned and nervous about what happened to \u2014 to my father, and there was a\nconstant sort of tension. I almost sometimes had the feeling that you know, if th \u2014\nJanuary 5, 1996\nit\u2019s no use talking about it all the time, that whatever happens, happens, you know.\nIt was oppressive to hear about that all the time. And but otherwise I \u2014",
        "Q: Do you know if \u2014 what action she took to try to get information?",
        "A: Yes, she \u2014 she was in some way resourceful. What she did was each time there\nwas an opportunity to talk to one of the Russian guards, which was at work, and\nthis she told us in the evening about, or when she got her ration cards, or when she\n\u2014 whenever there was some contact, she would ask. Of course, these people were\nminor. Today I see how minor they were. These were minor guards and they had\nno idea what happened, you know, 3,000 kilometers back east, to my father. So it\nwas sort of useless. I thought even at eight that she\u2019s being a terrible nuisance to\nthem. But she did do that all the time. And as a matter of fact, she \u2014 she was once\ncalled, I don\u2019t know why, she was called either because of work, or because of\nsome ration cards, or because of some permits to go to the city, I don\u2019t know, she\nwas called to the encava \u2014 the office, and she went there, and as usual she com \u2014\ntold them that \u2014 about my father, and she tried to evoke some pity in them. And\nthere was a large age difference between my parents and so she said he \u2014 you\nknow that she \u2014 first of all she didn\u2019t want to say that he owned the bank, because\nthat \u2014 you know. So she \u2014 but she said that he\u2019s older and that he 1s sickly and that\nshe\u2019s terribly worried about him and so on. And then this official asked her, what\ndid he do? So she said well, he was a bank clerk. So he said, so what are you so\nJanuary 5, 1996\nupset about? You are young and you are beautiful and you\u2019ll \u2014 we have lots of\nbank clerks in Russia and you\u2019ll find a young one that he won\u2019t be sick. So don\u2019t\nbe so upset. So she came home and told that story in very \u2014 1t was very funny the\nway she told it. And so I know that she was constantly doing that. It didn\u2019t help\nterribly much, but she was doing it.",
        "Q: Were there any particular sights or smells in that time that stayed with you?",
        "A: Snow. Lots and lots of snow. No smells, no sights, we didn\u2019t go anywhere, it\nwas just the snow in hut and the little narrow walkway to the school and from the\nschool, and that\u2019s all I remember from that. And the schoolroom was pleasant and\nwarm, that I remember, that it was pleasant and warm.",
        "Q: And this routine went on for how long?",
        "A: This routine went on until about April. It started in September, October, soon\nas we got \u2014",
        "Q: April 1941?",
        "A: April 1941, right. And in April she was \u2014 my mother was summoned by them,\nand told that if she wanted to, she could leave, she could go back to Poland with\nthe two children. And of course, she couldn\u2019t believe her ears, I mean, sh-she\ncouldn\u2019t believe that they were saying that, and she thought it was some sort of a \u2014\nof a plan to trick her to \u2014 to \u2014 she just couldn\u2019t believe it, no one had been set free.\nAnd so she said she just listened to them, and then she said, how will I go back, I\nJanuary 5, 1996\ndon\u2019t \u2014 you know, I don\u2019t have money to buy a ticket, I don\u2019t \u2014 you know, how do\nI go \u2014 so they said, why don\u2019t you ask your brother to send you money to get a\u2014\nto buy the ticket for the transiber \u2014 she had to buy a ticket for the Trans-Siberia\nrailroad, which went from Vladivostok all the way down \u2014 back to \u2014 to Moscow.\nBut \u2014 and then we still were a day, or many hours by horse and buggy away from\nthat last station. But anyway, so she said she was afraid that they were trying to\ntrick her into saying that my uncle had the money to buy it. So she didn\u2019t \u2014 so she\nsaid, I don\u2019t know \u2014 he doesn\u2019t have that kind of money to buy the ticket. So he s\n\u2014 so this guard said to her, okay, so if he doesn\u2019t send you a ticket, then you won\u2019t\ngo back. So at that point she thought maybe she was overplaying her cards here, so\nshe said, okay, she\u2019ll write to him and he\u2019ll make a collection among his friends.\nAnd at that point the guard apparently got upset and said, in Russia we don\u2019t make\ncollections. His honor was hurt. So she said, well, I\u2019ll write to him and see\nwhatever he wants to do. And she got out of that one, and actually when she did\nwrite that they said that \u2014 that we could leave, but she needed the money for the\npassage and so on, he thought also that 1t was some sort of a trick. And he asked\nher for her password. He asked her the name of a cousin that they had actually\nhere in America, who had left Poland in the early 20s, or whatever, her first\nname. And when she gave that \u2014 when she wrote it back, he did send the money.\nAnd at that point, she went with the money and she was told that we could leave,\nJanuary 5, 1996\nand we left in May. We \u2014 we went to the train, just my brother and \u2014 and she \u2014 and\nmy mother and I, and we went to \u2014 to \u2014 they provided us with transportation from\nwhere we were, to the end station. And I remember that trip very clearly because\nwe had to wait overnight in \u2014 at this train station, which also was not very\npleasant, it was very cold.",
        "Q: What were \u2014 two questions, what were your thoughts about leaving? What was\nyour reaction when your mother told you that you would be leaving?",
        "A: I was very, very excited, and I didn\u2019t know \u2014 I had the same feeling she had,\nthat we were afraid, because everybody, her parents and my aunt and the rest of\nthe family said, who knows where they\u2019re taking you? Who knows why they\u2019re\nsingling you out? Who knows what they\u2019 Il do to you? And my mother\u2019s answer\nwas, that if they wanted \u2014 and which was very clever, if they wanted to do\nsomething to her, or what \u2014 then they didn\u2019t have to \u2014 to put on this whole act,\nthey could do it right here, they could just take her away and do it. So they didn\u2019t\nhave to have this whole production. Therefore, she did trust that this is legitimate,\nthat they want to send us back for some reason that she couldn\u2019t figure out. And of\ncourse, neither could I. And I remember just that we were ta \u2014 you know, people \u2014\npeople in general, other people; there were friends, and people she worked with,\nand everybody came to say goodbye to us, but there was a lot of, you know,\nshould she go, shouldn\u2019t she go there for \u2014 for \u2014 for weeks, I remember these\nJanuary 5, 1996\ndiscussions, should she go, shouldn\u2019t she go. And she decided she wanted to go\nand you know, and \u2014 did I \u2014",
        "Q: Did she say anything about leaving her parents and other relatives?",
        "A: No, she was rather independent and she \u2014 I would say no. I think she \u2014 she\ntrusted \u2014 she loved her brother, so she knew she was going to him. She knew she\nwas going back to Europe. She knew, you know, that it was going to be less cold\nand less miserable, and she wouldn\u2019t be loo \u2014 so in other words, she knew \u2014 she\nfelt that it was going to be better, whatever it is, 1t\u2019s going to be better. And\ncertainly better for us children, particularly for my brother.",
        "Q: Even though she left her parents?",
        "A: Oh yeah. My mother was not \u2014 how shall I say? She was not that attached to\nher family. She had married, lived abroad and it\u2019s not that she didn\u2019t like them, but\nshe felt that \u2014 that this was something that she \u2014",
        "Q: Opportunity she \u2014",
        "A: Yes, absolutely, and she was not the clinging type, no, absolutely not.",
        "Q: Did you say anything special when you said goodbye to your relatives \u2014",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: \u2014 do you remember saying anything?",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t remember saying anything, no. Just goodbye and should \u2014 how\nshould I say? I was glad to be rid of my aunt, I really was. What else? My\nJanuary 5, 1996\ngrandmother was very quiet, my grandfather \u2014 no, I don\u2019t remember saying\nanything, no, mm-mm, no.",
        "Q: What did you all take with you when you left?",
        "A: Whatever we were wearing. We didn\u2019t have anything to take with us. By then\nwe had nothing, you know, precious or anything. No, I don\u2019t remember \u2014 all \u2014 all I\nremember is that she always watched very carefully her \u2014 the identity, the papers.\nThe papers were very important, you know, th-the \u2014 the \u2014 the permits, the various\npermits that she needed. She did have to go back several times to get all of the\npermits and the train tickets, and the \u2014 all of that I remember, there was constantly\ntalk about, you know, where to keep it and how to keep it to make sure she has it\nand all that, yeah.",
        "Q: So now you\u2019re at the train station.",
        "A: So now we\u2019re at the train station and the train arrived. We got on it and we had\na compartment, and in the compartment there were two \u2014 there were bunk beds,\nand there was a \u2014 this I also don\u2019t remember, my brother and I had a bunk\ndownstairs and there was another man in the compartment, who actually was with\nus the whole time. Whether he slept in that compartment or slept across in another\ncompartment, I don\u2019t somehow remember, but I do remember that he used to take\nme and my brother to the restaurant car and gave us \u2014 and bought us hot chocolate.\nAnd that to us was such a treat, you see, this is the kind of thing I do remember,\nJanuary 5, 1996\nthat he sought \u2014 and my mother suspected, later on when she used to talk about it,\nthat he was actually planted to sort of take care of us and, you know, planted by\nthem to \u2014 to \u2014 to be nice to us and also maybe to watch us. Not that we had any\nplace to go, we had no place she could have gone. But he was there for some\nstrange reason, he was there in a way that \u2014 that \u2014 that we couldn\u2019t make out why\nhe was there, and he was there \u2014 maybe he was just \u2014 maybe it \u2014 it wasn\u2019t so,\nmaybe he just traveled, and he happened to be a friendly guy, and \u2014 so there\u2019s na \u2014\nI don\u2019t know. But he sort of stayed around and the whole time \u2014 it\u2019s a long trip,\nit\u2019s 11 days. So \u2014 and then we got to Moscow.",
        "Q: Did you ever get off the train?",
        "A: In Moscow.",
        "Q: Not \u2014 but not in \u2014",
        "A: Sometimes on the platform we would just get off, because the \u2014 the \u2014",
        "Q: Stretch.",
        "A: \u2014 yes, th-th \u2014 because \u2014 the train was enormously comfortable. The beds were\nmade with linens, I mean, this was super luxury for us, super luxury. We got very\ngood food, decent food on the train and always hot water, what they called\nkipyatok. And then he would get us the hot chocolate. It was not bad, it was, by\nour standards this was top luxury. And when we got to Moscow we had to\ninterrupt the trip and I don\u2019t know if we had to wait for another train, but I know\nJanuary 5, 1996\nwhere \u2014 we had a few hours and he took us sightseeing. So he was, you know, he\ntook us \u2014 he \u2014 he had a horse and buggy. And in Kiev, because we passed through\nKiev also, and in Kiev \u2014 he was gone already, but we went \u2014 you know, he left in\nMoscow, he didn\u2019t continue with us. In Kiev my mother hired a horse and buggy,\nand we went around and she \u2014 she was very excited about being in Kiev, and she\nknew a lot about Kiev, and she was trying to show us the city, city is quite nice, by\nthe way. And \u2014 well, my only memory from there is that as we were riding, they \u2014\nmy brother noticed a broken egg on the street, and he started yelling, an egg, an\negg. And this egg sticks in my mind to this day. To him the whole city wasn\u2019t\nimportant, but that somebody could have dropped an actual egg and wasted it, was\nlike, you know \u2014 so I remember that ride in Kiev. What I remember most vividly\nis arriving in \u2014 in Lw\u00e9w, because when we arrived in Lwow my uncle was waiting\non the platform, and that I remember as being an enormously emotional reunion,\nbut really, I mean she was very, very excited and very happy, and I was too, I\nmean, you know, here we were, we had arrived and everything was all right, and\nso on. And I also remember that he helped us with the little bit of luggage we had.\nAnd he had a man with him, somebody who helped him, who I later found out was\nlike his, kind of manservant, who did lots of things for him also, in connection\nwith packing, antiques, and delivering things and so on. So he wasn\u2019t like a house\nservant, he was more like a helper. So he helped with the luggage. And we got 1-\nJanuary 5, 1996\ninto a taxi, we actually got into a car, and while we were going to \u2014 to, I imagine\nwhere he lived, because we were supposed to go to his, I guess to hi \u2014 he was\ntaking us to his house. While we were going there, my mother asked whether he\nhad heard something about my father, was the usual thing. And he said, as a matter\nof fact he had. And he said \u2014 and so mother started saying, is he all right, is he all\nright? And he said yes, actually, he\u2019s all right, he\u2019s well. And the whole ride was\nnot very long, must have been \u2014 I\u2019ve been back there since, it\u2019s a short distance,\nmust have been five or 10 minute ride. During those 10 minutes he prepared her\nthat my father was actually there. And when we got to the building, there was my\nfather standing and she fainted. My mother fainted, they had to carry her out, she\nscreamed. And that I remember very vividly, I remember that was very moving\nand very, you know, I mean so unexpected. And I hadn\u2019t seen my father in over a\nyear and a half or whatever it was, and it \u2014 and that was very exciting. And then\nwe went upstairs and they talked and talked and talked and talked. And that was it.\n[break]",
        "Q: We were talking about your arrival in Lwow and your \u2014 you and your mother\nand your brother seeing your father for the first time.",
        "A: Right. And \u2014 and the reason he didn\u2019t come to the railroad station was because\n\u2014 my uncle and he had decided that it was very important to prepare her slowly,\nbut since the distance from the railroad station to his house was very short, so even\nJanuary 5, 1996\nthe slow preparation was not really slow enough, and the impact was enormous\nand she fainted and carried on, and so on. And then we went upstairs and I re \u2014 I\njust remember that they talked and talked and talked and talked. And that was \u2014\nthat was it. And then we found out that my father had \u2014 well, he had his own set\nof, you know, what he went through, but the reason we were set free was because\nthey \u2014 a relative here in New York had bought in Switzerland, or gotten in\nSwitzerland, Bolivian passports which were actually \u2014 they were almost genuine,\nthey were not completely false. They were issued by the consulate \u2014 the Bolivian\nconsulate in Zurich, which \u2014 they were not issued by the government of Bolivia.\nThey had booklets and they had stamps and the consuls very often did it for their\nown gain. And so \u2014 but they were more legitimate than the ones who were later\nprod \u2014 you know, manufactured right \u2014 right then in Poland and wherever. So,\nanyhow, he had gotten the \u2014 these Bolivian passports, and my father, while he was\nin jail, and he ha \u2014 was moved during the 18 months he was in jail, he was moved\nto 11 different jails. They move people constantly. And the interrogations started\nfrom \u2014 from the beginning in each particular jail. My father never knew whether it\nwas because they didn\u2019t have records, or whether it was a purposeful thing to\nexhaust people. Interrogations were always at night he told us, and the first few\njails he was treated terribly, and he really suffered hunger. And later \u2014 and he, on\nthe other hand, did something different which worked out well. He convinced\nJanuary 5, 1996\nthem that he was actually more important than he was. He tried \u2014 he did not play\nthe [indecipherable] because he thought that it wouldn\u2019t work anyway. He was a\nvery imposing, good-looking, tall man, and he spoke five languages fluently, was\neducated in Germany. And so he was a personality. And he was afraid that if he\ntried to tell them that \u2014 who he wasn\u2019t, they would find out who he was, and then\nthat would be worse. So he sort of even \u2014 he told them who he was, and he told\nthem that he had very good connections abroad. He did do some dealings with\nLehman Brothers here in America, he had some dealings with Bernard Baruch,\nhe did do that. Probably not as much as he told them, but \u2014 and they felt maybe\nthat it was worth saving him and sending him abroad. And so when he \u2014 they told\nmy father that if he wanted to contact his \u2014 his relatives and ask them to help him\nby sending in foreign papers, they would release him, and that\u2019s what happened.\nBut we didn\u2019t know anything about that in Siberia, so when these passports\narrived, they notif \u2014 they called my father one \u2014 by then he was in La Lubyanka.\nAt the end, the last three or four months he was at La Lubyanka. By the way, it\u2019s\na very luxurious prison. He had a beautiful room he told us, with Persian rugs, and\nthey treated him like a king. Wonderful food, he went out for a walk every day.\nThose were the people \u2014 you never knew in Russia what was going to happen \u2014\nthose were the people that they subsequently probably released. Anyhow, to make\na long story short, he said that they notified him one day that the passports had\nJanuary 5, 1996\narrived, and he would be able to leave whenever he felt like it. And at that point,\nhe said he wasn\u2019t going to leave until he found out what happened to us. Took\nthem three months to locate us. And three months later, I forgot to say, the first\ntime they called my mother, they asked her to give them a picture of herself and\nthe two children, and they didn\u2019t say why. And that picture took them a long time\nto send it from Siberia to Moscow, and it actually came to the Lubyanka and the\n\u2014 the inspector showed it to my father and said, is this your wife? We found her,\nwe know now where she is. And that\u2019s when they told us to go back, or sent us\nback. So there was some rhyme and reason to it, and that\u2019s when \u2014 and \u2014 and they\nreleased him, or he left on hi \u2014 of his own free will. He was \u2014 when \u2014 when they\ntold him that we got on the train. So that\u2019s how we were reunited, and we had now\nthese Bolivian passports. And we were supposed to leave on the 24\" of June,\n1941, and we were supposed to go all the way east again, via Japan to leave\nRussia, and to go to, presumably Bolivia at some point. But the 22\u2122 of June,\nGermany invaded Russia, and so we never made it. We had everything, we \u2014 we\nhad the train tickets, we were packed, we had everything. So that was a very bad\nbreak for us because we \u2014 the da \u2014 the Russians evacuated very efficiently. I mean,\nthey \u2014 they left, and they didn\u2019t take anyone with them. We tried to ask them to\ntake us with them, but there was no way, they weren\u2019t going to take any civilians\nat all, and they didn\u2019t. And so we \u2014 we stayed in \u2014 in Lwow. And I remember we\nJanuary 5, 1996\nwere in the cellar at night, because they were shooting and bombing. Not bombing\nso much, but shooting. There was a war. And during the night, I remember there\nwas this marching at night, this very, very strong marching, and my mother said,\nthe Russians are gone, these are the Germans, and I remember say \u2014 sort of \u2014 I\nalways thought that she knew too much before anyone else did, she \u2014 and\nsometimes she was wrong, but very \u2014 most of the time she was right. And I said,\nhow do you know\u201d And she said, because they march differently. And sure was\nshe right, they marched differently. And in the morning, there they were. And so\nthat was the hard \u2014 that was hard, because we were lucky in the way that we had\nthe Bolivian passports, so we did not \u2014 we were not in the ghetto. The ghetto in\nLwow was established very, very quickly, because they already had experience\nfrom Krakow and Warsaw and all that, so they \u2014 in Lwow it went very, very\nquickly. And we couldn\u2019t go out, because they were rounding up children in the\nstreet, they were rounding up people, they were rounding \u2014 you know, and they\nhad these ratzias as they called them, they rounded up people, so my parents\ndidn\u2019t \u2014 th-th-they were afraid to let us out in the street because \u2014 or themselves,\nfor that matter, because they knew that these Bolivian passports \u2014 you know, they\n\u2014 they were safe \u2014 th-there was talk that the \u2014 we would be exchanged for\nprisoners. As you know, these talks went on and on and some people were sent,\nand actually \u2014 I don\u2019t know if anyone was actually exchanged, but some people\nJanuary 5, 1996\nwere deported and told that they would be held, and would be exchanged. These\nforeigners. Some people really had real foreign passports because the husband was\n\u2014 had left Poland before and sent the passport, was living already in \u2014 1n one of\nthe South American countries, and so on, and the wife was supposed to follow.\nAnd so there were some real legitimate ones. Ours were not a hundred percent\nlegitimate, but that didn\u2019t make that much difference.",
        "Q: What was it like for you to see a German soldier?",
        "A: Scary. Very, very scary, because they looked superhuman, they looked like\ngods, and I \u2014 I often had the \u2014 the feeling that maybe if we would look like they\ndid, or be dressed like they did, and have these shiny boots that they had, then\nmaybe we \u2014 they wouldn\u2019t hate us so much. In other words, I remember strongly\nfeeling that they were superior. I believed they were superior at that time, they did\n\u2014 they \u2014 they \u2014 they look mighty and \u2014 and superhuman. So I \u2014 I was just afraid of\nthem, but not \u2014 but at the same time I thought they were great, you know, they\nwere the \u2014 they were \u2014 they were awesome, that\u2019s what they were. I remember\nreading one of Elie Wiesel\u2019s early books, and \u2014 where he talks about the same \u2014\nthat he had sometimes the same sort of feeling, that if he looked \u2014 you know, if he\ncould look like them, they wouldn\u2019t hate us so much. So apparently children did\nhave that kind of fantasy. So I do remember that. I remember being very afraid. I\nremember \u2014 you asked me about relationships and so on, I remember my parents\nJanuary 5, 1996\nat that point fighting all the time. A lot of tension, a lot of fighting, because the\nfights were always about what to do and what not to do. And my mother \u2014 my\nfather was a very law abiding sort of straight kind of person, and he thought if he\nlay low with his Bolivian passports, things would blow over. If he followed\nwhatever directions, or whatever ordinances they passed, and so on, then he would\nbe all right, because you don\u2019t \u2014 you don\u2019t do anything to somebody who\u2019s a law\nabiding citizen. My mother had totally different ideas. My mother felt that we\nwould never survive if we just stayed there, and we have to do something, and\nthere was this constant fighting about who was going to be guilty of us being\nkilled and who wasn\u2019t, and who \u2014 you know, this was [indecipherable] this was,\nand it was really constant. So I remember th-that part of it. After a few \u2014 after \u2014 we\nwere a year with the Germans in \u2014 in Lwow, but after the first two or three\nmonths, my parents too \u2014 sent my brother and me to the country, because by\ncoincidence, the chauffeur that they employed before the war, his wife\u2019s family\ncame from that part of \u2014 of Poland, and they had \u2014 they were farmers, they had a\nfarm, they were peasants. And so he was able to find that out, he \u2014 or I guess my\nfather did, and they paid them, and then my brother and I stayed there for about\ntwo or three months \u2014",
        "Q: Was it hard \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 or four months.\nJanuary 5, 1996",
        "Q: \u2014 hard for you to leave \u2014",
        "A: No-",
        "Q: \u2014 your mother?",
        "A: \u2014no, I was so happy to leave, because it was safe, you know, it was quiet. And\nit was \u2014 it felt safe, and \u2014",
        "Q: But even leaving your mother, wasn\u2019t it hard at that young age?",
        "A: No, no I don\u2019t think it was hard, because I don\u2019t remember it as being hard, I\nremember thinking that \u2014 that this was going to be quiet and safe, and that \u2014 and\nthey also told us that it would be \u2014 we were a burden. They \u2014 they made it very\nclear to us that we were a burden, because we \u2014 ye \u2014 they could hide with grown-\nups, they \u2014 subsequently they were hidden by a German officer in his office. And\nwi \u2014 they couldn\u2019t do that sort of thing with us children around, so we knew that\nwe had \u2014 that we were a kind of burden, and we had to be taken care of\nsomewhere else. So, I know it wasn\u2019t bad, and these people were nice to us.",
        "Q: The two or three months you were in Lwow, before you went to the country,\nwhat did you do?",
        "A: Nothing. We stayed home, we never went out, we just \u2014 nothing. And there my\nmother was very good at creating paper games, pencil and paper games, and that \u2014\nnothing. We couldn\u2019t go out, you did nothing. You \u2014 you went crazy. Particularly\nmy brother went crazy, because he was a little boy and he was lively. I see now,\nJanuary 5, 1996\nfor instance, my grandchildren, if they have no program on a \u2014 you know, then\nwhat \u2014 th-the \u2014 programs for this and programs for that and so on. Nothing, there\nwas nothing. You didn\u2019t do anything. You just \u2014 you just stayed around and\nlistened to what the grown-ups were talking about, and it wasn\u2019t very cheerful,\neither. No, that was hard. You didn\u2019t go to school, you did nothing, you did\nabsolutely nothing. One memory, vivid memory I actually have from \u2014 actually\nthis happened before the Germans came, because they \u2014 we were there for two or\nthree months before, and I had very, very bad teeth. I suppose because of the result\nof this year in Russia and I needed fillings, and those were my permanent teeth,\nand they were \u2014 had enormous cavities in them, and I \u2014 oh, knitting. My mother\ntaught me how to knit and how to darn, and I did a lot of that because that was\nsomething to do all day long. So I had this knitting needle, and I could put it right\nthrough my front teeth, they were s \u2014 and I was supposed to go to the dentist, they\nhad no \u2014 and you know, there were dentists [indecipherable] anyhow, they had no\nNovocain. So, to do that, they had to strap me to the table and \u2014 to the chair, which\nwas, to this day when I go to a dentist, I have a terrible time. But anyway \u2014 and my\nparents were having one of their fights about what to do. And I remember staying\n\u2014 staying in my \u2014 I had like a little alcove where my bed was, and it was early in\nthe morning, and I was supposed to go to the dentist that day, and I remember say-\nsaying to myself whether I should volunteer and say if they stopped fighting, then\nJanuary 5, 1996\nI would go without crying and objecting, and I never made it. I was so afraid of\nthis dentist and the strap and the pain, that I didn\u2019t make it. I let them fight on,\nbecause I couldn\u2019t bring myself to do that, to make that supreme sacrifice.\nAnyway, aft \u2014 so then we went out and we were in the country. There I remember\ndigging potatoes, which was great fun, by the way. And then they made fires, and\nthey roasted the potatoes. I remember Christmas there, where we baked a \u2014 there\nwe had something to do. That was, you see, the difference. I didn\u2019t \u2014 we didn\u2019t go\nout, because they didn\u2019t want us to see the other farmers, and we didn\u2019t go to\nchurch, and we didn\u2019t \u2014 because they all went to church on Sunday, but we didn\u2019t,\nwe were actually hidden. So we only stayed on \u2014 in the field near to their house.\nAnd I remember the animals, I remember milking cows, I remember drinking milk\nstraight from the cow. I remember feeding them, I remember the digging of\npotatoes. So that was actually not \u2014 it was a peaceful kind of interlude, so to speak.\nAnd \u2014",
        "Q: Did you have any contact with your parents?",
        "A: Very little. He would go into the \u2014",
        "Q: How\u201d",
        "A: \u2014 yeah h \u2014 my parents would write little notes, you know, letters, and I would\nalso write letters, I knew how to write. And he would go into the city and take the\nJanuary 5, 1996\nletters, and then they would write. Yes, we did have contact, but not spoken,\nwritten yeah.",
        "Q: Who made up \u2014",
        "A: And then \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 the farmer\u2019s family?",
        "A: It was he and his wife and a daughter. There were just three of them. The\ndaughter was actually a very pretty girl, and I remember she had \u2014 she would sit in\nfront of the mirror and make \u2014 she must have been about 18 or 19 or whatever, and\nmake the hairdo like they did at that time, three sort of \u2014",
        "Q: Rolls, curls? Okay.",
        "A: \u2014 round rolls this way, and then you pinned it with a pin. And then \u2014 and I \u2014 I\nremember thinking when I grow up, that\u2019s exactly the hairdo I\u2019m going to have, I\nwas so jealous of her. And \u2014",
        "Q: Did they know exactly who you were \u2014",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: \u2014 that you were two Jewish children?",
        "A: Yes, yes. They got paid for it. Yes. Oh, they were paid, absolutely. But they\nwere kind, I mean, you know, they were kind. They were \u2014 they were human, they\nwere \u2014 they treated us like \u2014 like they would any other relative children \u2014",
        "Q: Did they try any kind of converting on \u2014\nJanuary 5, 1996",
        "A: No, no, no. But we had \u2014 we sort of fit in, you know, when they were\ndecorating the tree, we were decorating the tree. When they were baking cookies,\nwe were baking cookies. But I know that we never went to church there, because\nthey didn\u2019t want us to be all over the place, and people asking too many questions,\nbut when somebody did come, like one of the neighbors or something, they said\nthere were city \u2014 you know, children of some \u2014 somebody who worked in the city,\na relative, and didn\u2019t want the children there; things were hard in the city. Don\u2019t\nforget that things were harder in cities always than in the country, there was a\nshortage of food by then, and all. But we were \u2014 we didn\u2019t have too much contact.\nBut they were nice to us, they didn\u2019t mistreat us in any way at all. And then one\nday he came back from the city, and he told us that he has \u2014 that we are going to\ngo to \u2014 that my parents are going to go to Hungary. And that they would take us \u2014\nhe took us by horse and buggy, or by car, I don\u2019t even remember, but I took us to\nan estate that was owned, or lived in by a German. And this German was supposed\nto help us get to the border. Some \u2014 a German helped us, that\u2019s how \u2014 my \u2014 and\nPll tell you how that connection came. He had a relationship with a Polish woman\nwho was a friend of somebody that my uncle knew. So she hel \u2014 she helped\nseveral Polish and Jewish people through her relationship with him. And again, it\nwas paid as well, but that was the connection. So what they did with us, they\nbrought my brother and me there, we spend one night there. And \u2014\nJanuary 5, 1996",
        "Q: The farmer brought you?",
        "A: Yes, and they \u2014",
        "Q: What was the farmer\u2019s name, do you remember?",
        "A: Boushlevich(ph) yes, I remember his last name because everybody called him\nBoushlevich(ph). I don\u2019t remember his first name. Boushlevich(ph). And then he\n\u2014 he brought us there, he left us there, and we were there a few days before my\nparents arrived. And I know it was August, because it was over my birthday. And\nhe showed up, this German, I'll never forget that, and he asked me what I like best\nto eat. And I had a thing about tomatoes, I loved tomatoes. And on my birthday \u2014\nhe asked me when is my birthday, it so happened was in a few days, he brought\nme four tomatoes. I'll never forget that. This was this German. And then \u2014",
        "Q: His name?",
        "A: No, don\u2019t remember, I was only there a few \u2014 I don\u2019t even know her name, but\nI understand that she was killed right after the war because she was considered a\ncollaborator. These people didn\u2019t live very long, so \u2014 but anyway, she \u2014 and so my\npar \u2014 and my parents were hidden in his office behind a wardrobe at the end, it\nwas really \u2014 they couldn\u2019t leave his office, they were like behind a big wardrobe, a\npartition or something. I wasn\u2019t there, so I don\u2019t know, but my \u2014 but that\u2019s what\nthey told me. And you see, and that\u2019s why it was important to get us out of the\nway, because you couldn\u2019t hide us together like that. And then \u2014 then my par \u2014\nJanuary 5, 1996\nyou see, my parents at some point realized that they would never survive, or that\nthey would be deported with the Bolivian passport, that the Bolivian passports\nwould not save them from deportations. And you see, there, there was a big\ndifference of opinion between my parents, because my father believed that we\nwould be exchanged, and my mother said no way, this is all \u2014 you know, they\u2019ll\nnever exchange anybody for anybody. And they\u2019ll just take us like everybody else,\nand kill us. So the \u2014 1n the end they made the decision that we would go illegally\nacross the border to Hungary. And \u2014 which was a very risky business, but\napparently they came to the conclusion that it would be less risky than staying\nwith these Bolivian passports in Lw\u00e9w. My uncle had gone before. He went\nbefore because he was \u2014 he didn\u2019t have any foreign passport, and he was what they\ndec \u2014 what they designated as a necessary Jew, because he helped \u2014 just like he\nhelped the Russians to identify what they were robbing, he then did the same for\nthe Germans, because they were \u2014 they were robbing things, and they had these\nwarehouses where they stored them, and they had to decide what to take to\nGermany, what to send to Germany, what not to send to Germany, what to steal,\nwhat not to steal for themselves, and so on, so they needed experts to tell them\nwhat\u2019s good and what isn\u2019t, you know, like in every other area, you know, what is\na good painting, what is a good carpet, what is good china, what is good silver,\nwhat is \u2014 and so on. So my uncle got, since he had that kind of job with the\nJanuary 5, 1996\nRussians, he stayed on and they took over this warehouse, and so he stayed with\nthem. And he became \u2014 my uncle was a very charismatic person and became very\nfriendly with the guy who ran this warehouse. And so first he had like a certificate\nas a notwendig Jude, you know one of these Jews who were necessary for the\nGerman Reich. And then he was arrested twice and badly beaten and both times\nthis German was able to get him out on the \u2014 saying that he was a necessary\nperson. But my uncle realized that this is not going to work a third time, besides he\nsuffered terribly, was terribly beaten. And so he decided to \u2014 to take \u2014 to run \u2014 to\nescape to Hungary, and then we followed. And I remember that crossing of the\nborder, because that was a terrible experience, because you see, they kept saying,\nmy parents kept saying \u2014 I guess they \u2014 they knew about it and they didn\u2019t try to\nhide it. Many of these guys, they were paid and then they took people directly to\nthe nearest police outpost. And there was no way you could pretend, I remember\nbeing totally, totally defenseless against that, because you were in a forest, and\nyou had to cross \u2014 you didn\u2019t cross on a road, you crossed like on trails. And you\nhad to cross a river, there\u2019s a river on the border of Germany \u2014 of Poland and\nHungary. So \u2014 and they were the guides, they \u2014 they were local people who knew\nhow to \u2014 how to get there. And \u2014 but if they turned left or right or straight, and \u2014\nand took you somewhere else, there was no way you could have prevented it, or \u2014\nor even know. And that\u2019s what happened to many people. So I knew about that,\nJanuary 5, 1996\nand I \u2014 I don\u2019t know how I knew about it, because probably my parents talked\nabout it and \u2014 and I remember being terribly afraid that they would deliver us. So\n\u2014 but we didn\u2019t \u2014 they were \u2014 they didn\u2019t, and \u2014 or he didn\u2019t, was one guy. And\nwhat I remember about that is that when we were crossing the river, there was a\nstrong sort of current, and there were like big rocks and it was slippery, and my\nfather fell, or slipped and lost his glasses. And that was a major problem, and he\ngot terribly upset because he couldn\u2019t see without his glasses, he was very\nnearsight. And so I went next to him, or I sort of went back and I started looking\nfor the glasses and I found them, they were caught behind the \u2014 and he talked\nabout this as long as he lived, about these \u2014 that I found his glasses and that saved\nwhatever it saved. But the effect of all of this was that we arrived in Hungary near\nMunkacs, and we \u2014 Munkacs was the nearest metropolis. And we arrived in the\nmorning early, and we were \u2014 my father was wet, and he was in a suit, and he was\nwet from the river. And it wasn\u2019t so much that it was uncomfortable, 1t was in\nAugust, so it wasn\u2019t cold, but as \u2014 as they said late \u2014 it was dangerous, you know?\nWhy would these people be dressed like that and wet and no place to go, in the\npark. We went to a park, because that was the \u2014 the most logical place to be. And\nwhat my father \u2014 what my parents with great bitterness recalled for years and\nyears was that \u2014 see, Hungary had not been occupied yet, and the Hungarian Jews\nin Munkacs \u2014 Munkacs was a very Jewish place, they were living there a normal\nJanuary 5, 1996\nlife, and my parents told \u2014 you know, approached a couple of people, my father\ndid, and told them of \u2014 you know, that we had just escaped from Poland and\nwould they help us. And nobody wanted to help us. Nobody. And it wasn\u2019t even \u2014\nthat\u2019s what my parent were so bitter about, because it was \u2014 later on, you\nunderstood if somebody didn\u2019t help you, or the Poles, for that matter, if they didn\u2019t\nhelp you during the occupation, because they would be severely punished. But at\nthat point in Hungary there was no real danger yet of being severely punished,\nand yet they wanted no part. And we later \u2014 I read about it later a little, I think\nthey thought if they had nothing to do wi-with us, then the evil, and all this\nproblem that\u2019s coming from the east, somehow wouldn\u2019t come to them. You\nknow, but my parents were very bitter about it, I don\u2019t know enough about it. But\nfinally somebody did take us in, and I remember that it was on the outskirts, and it\nwas a\u2014 was not a Jewish family, some \u2014 some woman in the square told us to\nfollow her, and she took us, and she had a barn. And she told us we could stay in\nthat barn. So we dried out in the barn, and she brought us some food. And in the\nmeantime, my father had some sort of a meeting point with \u2014 because my uncle\nwent ahead, and my uncle was supposed to arrange for Christian papers with a\nfake name for us. You see, we couldn\u2019t show up as the same people with the same\npassports in \u2014 in Poland \u2014 in Hungary. You see, we had to then reinvent, and I \u2014\nourselves and the new identity. So th-the idea was that in Hungary we would be\nJanuary 5, 1996\nas Polish Christians, which \u2014 of whom there were many because there were some\ndeserters from before the war, from the beginning of the war. And there was a\ncolony of Polish people there. So these papers came to Munkacs, and my father\ngot them someplace, and they came with a man with a car, who my uncle arranged\nwould take us to Budapest already with those papers. And those papers, that I ha\n\u2014remember one of the most frightening moments of my war was that my mother\ntold us that from now on my name, or \u2014 for me, and my brother too, my name was,\nsince I was always called Ria(ph), that my name was Maria, and the last name\nwas Wolinsky(ph). Our name before the war was Wohl. So the simplest thing,\nthey dropped the H and made it into a very nice Polish name, which was\nWolinsky(ph), so my name was Maria Wolinsky(ph), or Wolinska(ph) for that\nmatter. And my brother was Stefan always, so there was no problem, was Stefan\nWolinsky(ph) and my father was Athol(ph) and my mother was Gisele. But, when\nwe were \u2014 you see, the - Munkacs in that area was still the border, it was the\nborder strip what they called, and then there was a post, a police post that you had\nto pass. And there they stopped all the cars and looked and \u2014 and you had to\nidentify yourself, or whatever, identification. And at that point, when they stopped\nus, my mind went blank. I suddenly could not remember whether our name now\nwas Wolinsky(ph) or Wolsky(ph), which are very similar. And I was \u2014 and how I\ndidn\u2019t die of a heart attack, although children don\u2019t usually, but I was trembling\nJanuary 5, 1996\nand I was petrified. And this guard spoke to the driver, of course and the driver \u2014\nthey spoke Hungarian, we couldn\u2019t understand a word. And they \u2014 he told them\nthat we were some relatives or something. I mean, it never came to us \u2014 to our\nhaving \u2014 it was all bribe \u2014 the \u2014 to identify ourselves, but I thought that it might,\nand I was sure that they would ask me my name, this was very important at that\npoint, and I was very scared. And as soon as we started moving again, I said to my\nmother, I forgot what our name is. And she \u2014 and I was \u2014 you know, I \u2014 I saw\nmyself also as being the \u2014 the one who caused everyone to be whatever \u2014 so, killed\nor \u2014 or whatever. So my mother said then, don\u2019t worry, she said, if you \u2014 if they\nhad asked you for your name, we would have been lost anyway, no matter what\nthey would have s \u2014 what they would have \u2014 what you would have said. So \u2014 but it\nwas just, to show you how these things were. So then we came to Budapest and in\nBudapest we stayed in a pensionne. And we could not stay in the city, it was sort\nof in the outskirts of the city, but life was good. You had plenty of food, we had\ncomfortable rooms. Apparently life was enormously cheap in Hungary at that\ntime. And my father went to the city quite often, I remember, came back and then\nonce he was \u2014 you see, the \u2014 the \u2014 the Hungarians were allies of the Germans.\nGonna stop it.\nEnd of Tape Two\nJanuary 5, 1996\nBeginning Tape Three",
        "Q: This is tape three, side one, and you are now in Hungary.",
        "A: Right, and we have just arrived, and we were actually sort of waiting. We\nstayed in this pensionne. My father would go into Budapest, it was a train ride, a\nshort train ride. He would meet my uncle, he would meet other people. The main\nbusiness of the day was some trading. You had to get some money. At that point\nmy mother sold some jewelry, particularly one diamond pin about which she\ntalked a lot because she said the things in \u2014 in Hungary were so inexpensive that\nwe lived on that pin for one year. [indecipherable]",
        "Q: This is a pin she had kept with her \u2014",
        "A: Yes \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 all the time \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 yes, she had it \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 even to Siberia?",
        "A: \u2014 she had jewelry \u2014 yes, yes, she kept a few things and she had it with her. And\nshe sold that. And they were also trading in stones. There was a big trade going on\nin diamonds, in foreign currencies; dollars, English pounds, and people were\ntrading, the Jews and the non-Jews, th-th-the Gentile refugees. There was a\nbusiness going on and people were trading and that\u2019s how people made some\nmoney, and that\u2019s what people lived on. Because at that point, none of us were\nJanuary 5, 1996\nreally in hiding. We did \u2014 my father did get held up or arrested at one point,\nbecause they were checking the legitimacy of his being there. So he had false\npapers, we had to have a permit to be \u2014 a residency permit, which we sort of got,\nbut I know that he was in Budapest, he wasn\u2019t supposed to be there. Anyhow, he\ngot caught, and then they came and got us, th-the \u2014 the \u2014 this is all now Hungarian\npolice. And, because he told them where that they \u2014 they asked where we are, you\nknow, and they knew he had family, or that he told them he had family, I don\u2019t\nknow, I wasn\u2019t there. But they did come and they arrested us. And we were put\ninto a \u2014 they had like a detention camp, it was not a real prison, but it was like a\ndetention camp in the center of Budapest. And the danger there was that they\nwould send us back to Poland.",
        "Q: What were you \u2014 what were your thoughts when you got arrested?",
        "A: Scared. We were scared because we were afraid that they would send us back\nto Poland. I knew better than anybody else, or certainly better than they that our\npapers were fake, our permits were fake, and if they caught on to that, they did\nsend \u2014 you see, they were allies of the \u2014 of the Germans. They were not occupied,\nbut they were allies, and if they found that somebody was really Jewish, and was\npretending to be Polish, and had no legitimate papers to be there, they did send\nsome people back. And that was the danger. It wasn\u2019t so much that the prison\nitself was so terrible. It was not very comfortable. They separated women from\nJanuary 5, 1996\nmen. All I remember is that there was a courtyard in the center of it, that\u2019s actually\none of the nicer stories, with a huge tree. And the \u2014 the \u2014 my \u2014 my father, when we\nlived in this pensionne, we were not far from a forest, and my brother found, one\nday when we went for a walk, he found a baby squirrel that must have fallen out\nfrom the nest or whatever, and we took it home. And this baby squirrel, we had\nhad him now maybe for a couple of months when \u2014 when we got arrested. And he\nwas tame, he was \u2014 he would sit in people\u2019s pockets. He was quite destructive\nactually, he would chew things up. But of course, my brother absolutely adored\nthis squirrel, and to this day he loves squirrels, and I do too. And when my father \u2014\nwhen they arrested us, my \u2014 they did go back with my father a day or two later,\nand \u2014 to pick up some things, you know, the necessities, and so they \u2014 they went\nback with my father and he was supposed to pick up some things for us. And at\nthat point the squirrel apparently recognized him and came to him and jumped into\nhis pocket as he always did. And there he was, and this policeman had never seen\na squirrel like that. And so he s \u2014 you know, the squirrel came back to prison, and\nhe was there. And when we got \u2014 when he got there, we didn\u2019t know what to do\nwith him, cause you couldn\u2019t keep him in the pocket all the time. So we let him go\nin the courtyard, and he went up and down that tree. He became like \u2014 everybody\nloved him. And luckily, we were released a few days later and the squirrel went\nhome with us. But one of the other sort of more humorous thing \u2014 they \u2014 they\nJanuary 5, 1996\nexamined our papers and decided it was okay. But one of the more humorous\nthings from that was that when they interrogated you, you had these false papers,\nbut you had to have \u2014 you know, they could ask you what was your mother\u2019s\nmaiden name, what was your grandmother\u2019s maiden name, and so on. So people\nof course, and we weren\u2019t the only ones who were in that situation, didn\u2019t have all\nthat information, nor did they \u2014 so they invented these names, and my mother used\nto tol \u2014 told a very funny story of this woman who was interro \u2014 who was asked,\nyou know, interrogated, and when she was asked, she would look around and pick\nan object, and say, you know, tay-tabloska(ph), you know, and just add the Polish\nending to it, you\u2019d look around. So that\u2019s how things were, you know, and \u2014 and\nyou either got away with it, or you didn\u2019t get away with it, depended. But anyway,\nso then we were there for another \u2014 must have been there about 10 days, and then\nthey released it.",
        "Q: Were you ever questioned?",
        "A: No, no \u2014",
        "Q: Wa \u2014 you were never questioned.",
        "A: \u2014no, no. I memorized what my mother told us to memorize, we didn\u2019t invent\nsome sort of maiden names for my grandmother and so on. And no, I was not mem\n\u2014 we also were taught very carefully by my mother, who knew those things,\nbecause she had been educated in Catholic schools, we were taught the basic\nJanuary 5, 1996\nprayers, you know, th-the Holy Mary, the \u2014 and Father, who are in heaven, the \u2014\nthe Pater Noster, because as Christian children we obviously had to know these\nmain things. So those things we knew backwards and forwards in \u2014 in Polish,\nquite, quite well. We were not questioned about that. So then they released us and\nwe went back to this place, but they told us that we couldn\u2019t stay there, because it\nwas too close to Budapest. And they had, at that time they had some rules about\nPolish refugees in general. This was not directed against Jews. They did not want\nlarge concentrations of foreign refugees in Budapest, say they wanted them\noutside of Budapest in smaller villages and ar \u2014 and so on, areas. So at that point\n\u2014 by the way, the squirrel, after he came back about a week later, he grew, he\nbecame \u2014 a-and he left, he ran away. Probably went back to the forest, once he\nwas no longer a baby, he was gone. And my brother was very upset when he \u2014 but\n\u2014 but he came back from prison, then he left. And then we \u2014 so then we had to\nmove, and we moved to an area that was \u2014 that they told us they \u2014 that we should\nbe in, and it was not far from Budapest, about an hour by train in Leanyfalu, and\nthat was sort of a concentration of Polish refugees. We rented a villa. We could do\nthat, we did \u2014 you know, within the circumference of where they wanted to \u2014 we\ncould live the way we wanted to live. The only problem with that was that we\nwere surrounded by Poles, and many of them not Jews. Some were Jews like us\nand some were not. More were not. And there the theater started. You really had to\nJanuary 5, 1996\nknow how to pretend not to be Jewish. And these Polish people, they knew. I\nmean, this was \u2014 this was all a \u2014a theater. So there \u2014 first of all, we had a fairly\nnormal life in the sense that we were not hiding, so my mother decided to see if\nshe could find somebody to take care of my brother and of me, and teach us\nsomething. I mean, you \u2014 we had never been to school again. And they \u2014 we were\ndriving them also crazy. So we \u2014 they took a \u2014 they found a lady who had been a\nteacher before the war, and she was the wife of a \u2014 of a \u2014 she was Polish, not\nJewish, and she was the wife, a young wife of a Polish deserter. Most of these\nPoles were actually somehow families of deserters. You know, they deserted in\n1939 from this army that was falling apart. And he was a tenor at the \u2014 at the opera\nin Poznan a Polish singer, and she was a teacher. And she was just as happy to\nwork for us because she was paid, of course. And she would come in the morning\nand she would take care of us all day long. And I \u2014 that was a \u2014 very nice, because\nshe would take us on picnics. She did find some Polish books. She made up a\nschedule, you know, we read, and then she had dictation, and then she had\narithmetic, and then she had lunch and \u2014 and we were with her all day long, and\nshe invented \u2014 she even \u2014 we even staged a little \u2014 I think one of the pictures that \u2014\nthat I showed you that you took was a staging of a Polish song in honor of my\nuncle\u2019s birthday and so on.",
        "Q: Now, your uncle was with you at this time?\nJanuary 5, 1996",
        "A: No, he did \u2014 yes, he was in Hungary, and he was in Budapest, but he did not\ngo with us \u2014",
        "Q: He did not come with you \u2014",
        "A: No, he did not live with us \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 to the village.",
        "A: \u2014 in this bucolic \u2014 no, he \u2014 when he had some Polish friends, he stayed with\nthem, he \u2014 he had to also sort of do some wheeling and dealing, because he had to\nearn some sort of living. My father has \u2014 was more fortunate, my father had more\nmoney, my father had my mother\u2019s jewelry, he had \u2014 he had some connections\nwhere he could get some money, he got some money from Switzerland that point\nas well. So he was different, but my \u2014 my uncle really lived by trading, you know,\nhe would buy antiques, sell antiques, make a commission. Buy and sell, that\u2019s\nwhat \u2014 and \u2014 and \u2014 and that\u2019s what he did, and he was a young, single person, I\nmean, his family was in Siberia, he had no contact at that point, he had no idea\nwhether they lived or died. Chances were they all lived, by the way. We did know\nthat the people in \u2014 in Siberia, unless they died of disease, that they were not\nkilled. That much one did know. So \u2014 so we went \u2014",
        "Q: [indecipherable] had no \u2014 no contact?",
        "A: No contact, none whatsoever, except that rumor had it that they did not kill\npeople \u2014\nJanuary 5, 1996",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 unlike the Germans, who did kill people. Then we lived \u2014 so there we lived\nfor a while very nicely, until the day that the Germans marched in. When the ger \u2014\nand we went to church regularly, went to church every Sunday, because you know,\nthat was the [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Okay, what was your feeling, going to church \u2014",
        "A: That\u2019s a very interesting, I \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 young Jewish girl going to church?",
        "A: Not the feeling that \u2014 that Americans have, not the feeling that I find among\nJews here, which I very often find very reprehensible. You went \u2014 I knew that it\nwas not my religion. I was afraid that I would do things wrong. You had to\nparticipate, you had to know when to get up, you had to go \u2014 know how to go to\ncommunion, you had to say the prayers the right place, you had to \u2014 you had to\npretend, and you \u2014 and \u2014 and it had to be real. Another thing that I often \u2014 that I\nknow was very highly emphasized to us, and I still feel very strongly about this, is\nthat we had to speak Polish correctly. We were not allowed \u2014 my mother would\nhave killed us if we had used a Jewish word, I mean that was a giveaway. So you\nwere sort of brainwashed to speak it, to speak it correctly and speak it without an\nintonation and so on. Because those were giveaways. So to this day, when \u2014 when\nI hear \u2014 hear people mixing, you know, Yiddish and English, I \u2014 I can\u2019t stand it.\nJanuary 5, 1996\nFirst of all, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s nice, because every language should be \u2014 I have\nnothing against Yiddish, but by itself, it shouldn\u2019t be mixed, you don\u2019t mix\nlanguages. Now there it was a matter of life and death, so you had to speak Polish\ncorrectly, and that was s-something that was another reason why my mother was\nvery anxious to hire somebody to \u2014 to \u2014 to be with us, though, because children\npick up accents, and that we should speak properly. So, we went to church every\nSunday. How did I feel? I had one problem with it, and that was a very strange\none. That the incense, I hated the smell of it, and I must have just about gotten to\nthe age just before puberty, and I used to get terrible headaches. And \u2014 which I\nsuffered from for a while. But I had a feeling at that time that the incense ma \u2014\nproduced them. Any time they start \u2014 I always had a headache on Sunday, whether\nit was the tension and the incense, or what it was \u2014 my mother went with us to\nchurch, so did my father. My mother knew very well what to do, she was very \u2014\nhad been exposed to it and so on. My father did \u2014 you know, what he was told to\ndo. But that was one of the things that did make us nervous. It\u2019s not that I was \u2014\nthat I hated it, but it made us nervous. It\u2019s like crossing the border, you know. If\nthey discover you\u2019re not who you say you are, you\u2019re in danger, so it made me\nnervous, yes.",
        "Q: Did you think about death a lot?",
        "A: Yes, yes. We \u2014\nJanuary 5, 1996",
        "Q: Was it something you were fearful of?",
        "A: Yes, yes, because I knew that each time, like when they arrested us, and they \u2014\nthey\u2019ll be another episode later, which was more dangerous, that each time there\nwas the possibility that they would send us back. And if they send you back, then\nthat was death.",
        "Q: And you knew that as a child?",
        "A: Oh, oh [indecipherable]",
        "Q: How did you know that?",
        "A: Because everybody talked about it, that the danger was not so much of sitting\nin this prison in Budapest, which was not \u2014 they didn\u2019t torture you, they didn\u2019t\nbeat you, they didn\u2019t do terrible things to you. The danger was that they will se \u2014 if\nthey discover that you\u2019re not who you say you are, they\u2019Il send you back. If you \u2014\nthey send you back, you\u2019ll go to the border guards, the border guards will hand\nyou over to the Gestapo. And then we knew that that was \u2014 that was 95 \u2014 99\npercent sure that you will be killed.",
        "Q: Did your mother or father try to soften this for you? Do you know what I mean,\nto put a layer \u2014 to prote \u2014 a protective layer?",
        "A: No, no, because this was in the air, everybody talked about it; who had been\ncaught, who had been sent back, why did they send them back, why the papers\nweren\u2019t good enough. This was \u2014 this was what people talked about, so this was\nJanuary 5, 1996\nsomething they couldn\u2019t really protect us from. They said that our papers were\nbetter, maybe, or that if we spoke correctly Polish that we would minimize this,\nthat somebody would denounce us locally. You know, all these things, that\u2019s why\nwe would \u2014 did all these things, to prevent this from happening. But nobody tried\nto tell you that if it did happen, that you would survive, no, th-th-that was like a\nsure death. So that was the scary thing out there all the time. And that\u2019s the danger\nof living on false papers, you know. So we stayed there, and \u2014 and w \u2014 and we\nwere there until the Germans invaded. When the Germans invaded, that\u2019s when\nthings became very dangerous, because a \u2014 they came and they made a inspection,\nand they did it very, very quickly. Everybody had to register with them. They\ncame, they set up a desk in a\u2014 in a ha \u2014 in a schoolhouse or in a house \u2014 I\nremember it was 1n a house. And people had to line up \u2014",
        "Q: This is at your village?",
        "A: Yes. People had to line up. They made an announcement, tomorrow morning or\nwhatever, they are going to have an inspection, everybody has to register. Was just\na registration, really. But that was dangerous, because they, of course, were\nlooking for Jews, that\u2019s what they were looking for. So that was very bad, and at\nthat point, we were doubly afraid; A, that they would discover that our papers\nwere not a hundred percent right, and B, that somebody would denounce us,\nbecause before that, if somebody had denounced us, there was really very little\nJanuary 5, 1996\ngain. What, they went to the Hungarians, the Hungarians didn\u2019t know who was\nwho, they were not that interested in the whole thing. But here now, we were\nafraid of that. So the minute that happened, we went through the registration\nbecause there was nothing we could do to avoid it, because it happened very\nquickly.",
        "Q: Did you go down yourself?",
        "A: Yes, Is \u2014 went with my mother, yes, I went with my mo \u2014 they separated men\nand women. But one \u2014 what was the wonderful thing about it is that my \u2014 my \u2014\nyou see, what was dangerous was for my father \u2014 it wasn\u2019t so much for women,\nbecause they did examine men, they \u2014 and that was the easiest way to tell who was\nwho. This husband of this teacher whom we had, he \u2014 his physique was somewhat\nsimilar to my father, he was shorter, but other than that, he was sort of husky, was\na big man also, but shorter. And anyhow, he went instead of my father. He went in\nthe morning himself, he got on the end of the line after a couple of hundred\npeople, he went instead of \u2014 with my father\u2019s papers. And my brother they didn\u2019t\nexamine, my brother went, you know, with him as his child and they just, you\nknow. So after that \u2014 I\u2019m in touch with her to this day, I just wrote her a letter.\nThey still \u2014",
        "Q: What are \u2014 what are their \u2014 their names?\nJanuary 5, 1996",
        "A: Rochinski(ph), Rochinski(ph). Her name was Helena Rochinska(ph). His\nname is \u2014 I don\u2019t know his first name, but Rochinski(ph), you know, you didn\u2019t\naddress people by their first name, but I knew her better than him. But I\u2014 we saw\nthem now \u2014 I mean, now, in 1973 when we were in Poland, and Mike and I went\nto visit them. They live in Poznan, and to this day I am in touch with her, I write\nto her, my father\u2019s, you know, helped her after the war. I still send her money as\nwell, and so on. So it is one of those wonderful stories. And they are \u2014 so then we\ndisappeared. Right after this-this thing, we knew we-we \u2014 we couldn\u2019t stay, that\nwe \u2014 we ran away from there.",
        "Q: When you were standing on line with your mother \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: \u2014 do you have any recollection?",
        "A: Just \u2014 just being scared, and being relieved after they, you know, they \u2014 they \u2014\nyou went there, they \u2014 they looked at your papers and they waived you on. There\nwas no conversation. The minute \u2014 as my mother used to say, the minute a\nconversation starts, things are bad. I mean, you know, there was nothing to talk\nabout if they didn\u2019t question your truthfulness, or whatever. So, no, there was no\nconversation, looked at our paper and waved us on and that was it. Then we went\nhome. And that was another one of those situations where my parents had an\nenormous fight, because my father felt that now that they have, you know,\nJanuary 5, 1996\nregistered us and examined us, we could stay. Then my mother said, we can\u2019t stay\nhere. Somebody sooner or later will either denounce us or something\u2019s \u2014 this is no\nplace for us to stay now. And she usually won out, because she made such scenes,\nmy mother could fight, and \u2014 and actually my parents got along. And so we left.\nWe left. I mean, what we did was \u2014 I don\u2019t remember exactly how \u2014 we stayed\nwith a fr \u2014 my brother and I stayed with a friend of my uncle\u2019s, a Christian\nwoman, a Polish lady, in Budapest. And my parents stayed with somebody, but I\nhave no idea with whom. And during the next few weeks, two or three or four\nweeks, whatever that time period was, they made arrangements to \u2014 to try to cross\nthe border illegally, to Romania. In other words, we tried to do the same thing we\ndid from Poland to Hungary, now from Hungary to Romania. Romania, things\nwere much easier, as you know. Prior to that, I forgot to mention my \u2014 you know,\nthere were transports going, prior to the Germans arriving, there was a way of\ngoing to Palestine th-that was \u2014 there was some sort of effort made, and my uncle\ntried to get on one of those transports, because he had been a Zionist before the\nwar, which my father was not, and he knew Hebrew, and he rated whatever, you\nknow, an affidavit, or whatever they needed at the time, to prove that they were\nworthy of going to Palestine. And he, I don\u2019t know how he did it, but he got this\nfake \u2014 I showed you that picture, I think \u2014 he got this fake permit for a wife and a\nchild, and my mother was supposed to go as his wife, and Stefan, my brother was\nJanuary 5, 1996\nsupposed to go as their child. But that never materialized. That\u2019s why there is this\nfunny photo, passport photo of my uncle, my mother and \u2014 and my brother. That\nnever materialized. But then, after the Germans came, and we were hiding for a\nbit, we tried to go to Romania. And the way that happened was we went to\nSzeged, and there there was a line-up. There was a house owned by some people\nwho rented the rooms. You paid them. And that was just renting rooms. But then\nthere was an aristocrat or a landowner who was \u2014 whose property was right on the\nborder, and th-the \u2014 the way was through his property. And he was a kind of bon\nvivant before the war, or during the beginning of the war, and he had a lot of\nparties. So he wasn\u2019t conspicuous by having 10, 12 people at his estate at any one\ntime. So people \u2014 so the first place where you stayed was a \u2014 at \u2014 in Szeged, and\nthen you went at night to his property, and then you stayed there for one day, and\nthere was this pretense of a party. And then at night you crossed the border to\nRomania. And the party before us was caught. Somebody must have announced,\nand they were all killed, by the way. So he was \u2014 they were caught, and somebody\n\u2014 and they came to get us, because somebody \u2014 they were tortured, and they gave\nout the address of where people \u2014 they knew that this was like a chain. My uncle,\nluckily, was not home when they came to arrest us. We were there, he was out on\n\u2014 in town, because he was supposed to go with us that evening, but he went out on\nJanuary 5, 1996\ntown. He was a \u2014 that was one of these strokes of genius. And he \u2014 and we were\narrested, and they took us to the local jail in Szeged.",
        "Q: This was the four of you?",
        "A: Just the four of us, right. They separated my mother and me, and my brother\nand \u2014 and my father were in the men\u2019s\u2019 jail. Now there I remember it distinctly,\nbecause we went in the same cell with two prostitutes. You \u2014 this was a local\nprison, you know, you had these \u2014 and it was a miserable little jail, and the\nconditions were terrible, and there I was sure that we wouldn\u2019t survive. I was\nterrified, because I knew that if they arrested us, and these people there gave our\nnames, that the next thing would be that they \u2014 that the police, th-the Hungarian\npolice would hand us over to the Gestapo, there was no \u2014 I didn\u2019t think there was\nany other way out of this. And there my mother used to say that I used to cry. I\u2014I\nremember crying, I remember thinking that I was too young to die. And my\nmother said that I told her a couple of times that it\u2019s easier for her because she\nalready had a life, and I didn\u2019t have anything. And she said that was sort of\nheartbreaking. But I remember being terribly scared in that prison, terribly. Cause\nthere it was the closest we came to being sent back. And we were there for a few\ndays, and we were told by the Hungarian guards, and by these women with whom\nmy mother started being very friendly, that they are \u2014 that the Gestapo came to the\nprison once a week. There was a day when they handed people over. And so the\nJanuary 5, 1996\nhope was that somehow, by some miracle, we would get out, I don\u2019t know if it\nwas a Monday or a Tuesday, whatever, before that happened. But I s \u2014 I didn\u2019t see\nany way out, but it so happened that after \u2014 I\u2019Il tell you why it happened. I \u2014 that\nthe day before there was \u2014 we were there six days \u2014 the day before they were\nsupposed to come, they released us, and in the custody of a local lawyer, a\nHungarian lawyer who was born and bred in Szeged. Now the way this was done\nis very interesting, 1t shows you how resourceful my uncle was. When my uncle\ncame back and realized we had been taken \u2014 by the way, my mother left money\nand jewelry behind one of the pictures. They had a \u2014 they had a \u2014 a secret as to\nhow, you know \u2014 anyhow [indecipherable] he got that, and he went back to\nBudapest, by foot, by hitchhike, I don\u2019t even know how, but he did go back,\nbecause his papers were not so [indecipherable] either. But he was loner man, he\nwas very resourceful. And he went to the Polish committee, there was a Polish\ncommittee, which was in charge of Polish refugees in Hungary. It was like a\u2014a\ncommittee. And he knew a number of people; my uncle was very friendly with a\nnumber of non-Jews from before the war. He knew people in \u2014 and all the time, he\nwas in touch with them. And he told them what happened to us. And basically,\nthey figured out that the only transgression that we did, for all practical purposes,\nwas that my father was not supposed to be in Szeged, because we, as Polish\nrefugees were \u2014 we had designated areas where we were supposed to live, and\nJanuary 5, 1996\nSzeged was not one of them. So they invented this idea that he went to look for\nwork. And that was a very nice idea, but then they looked for a connection and\nthey found the most prominent lawyer in Szeged, paid him off. He paid off the \u2014 I\nmean, this \u2014 the \u2014 the girl was his regular, you know, where he \u2014 where he was\nwell known, and where he had his cronies. So that\u2019s how we got out. So we were\nactually \u2014 and this lawyer, also a wonderful man, took us to his house, and you\nknow, really treated us \u2014 he was a Hungarian \u2014 very well. I mean, he fed us, I\nremember we took a bath there, everything was \u2014",
        "Q: What were the conditions like in the jail?",
        "A: Terrible, terrible \u2014",
        "Q: Did you go outside?",
        "A: \u2014 it was a small cell \u2014 no, no. It was a cell where you sat \u2014",
        "Q: So again you were cooped up, again you were",
        "A: Absolutely, and it was with these two \u2014 two women who my mother later told\nme were prostitutes, but these were local girls, and we were just sitting there with\nthese local women, and \u2014 and my mother used to tell me stories, because my\nbrother wasn\u2019t with us, we didn\u2019t see them, they were \u2014 you know, they \u2014 we saw\nthem maybe once, they \u2014 there was a place where \u2014 where \u2014 there was a corridor\nwhere my mother went to see them, I didn\u2019t see them. But she used to tell me\nstories. I once made a speech for the Heschel(ph) school. I said that, you know,\nJanuary 5, 1996\nchildren\u2019s stories usually start with once upon a time, our stories always started,\nafter the war. And she used to invent \u2014 she was a very good story teller in general,\nand she used to invent these stories about what would happen after the war. But\nthere I \u2014 it was almost more than a fairy tale, because there I didn\u2019t believe we\nwould get out. That was the only time I really didn\u2019t think we would make it.",
        "Q: Did you find that your bond to your mother was getting closer and closer \u2014",
        "A: Yes, yes \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 the more you experienced with her?",
        "A: \u2014 yes, yes, yes. I felt that she was the strongest \u2014 and I \u2014 my strongest bond was\nto my uncle, cause my uncle was like God. He was the one who arranged things.\nHe arranged our escape from Poland \u2014",
        "Q: This is Joseph Schtiglietz(ph) \u2014",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: \u2014 we\u2019re talking about.",
        "A: From Poland to Hungary. He arranged a \u2014 first \u2014 and he was also very\namusing, he was a \u2014 he arranged that \u2014 our release from prison. He would arrange\nthings, you know, he would bring things for us, he would tell stories, he would \u2014\nhe had all the adventures. I mean, in between he had his own adventures. He used\nto tell stories how he outwitted different the \u2014 he \u2014 he \u2014 to me he was immortal,\nindestructible an-and he proved such, I mean, he was a wonderful man. So he, to\nJanuary 5, 1996\nme, was God. I worshipped the ground he walked on. And my mother was the next\nbest thing, because she was a little bit like him, but of course she was a woman,\nand she was tied to my father and my father was ailing also, he was, you know, he\nwas not the \u2014 he \u2014 he was sick. As a matter of fact, in \u2014 I mean, not all the time,\nbut in Szeged, right after they released us, he had a gall bladder attack. And he \u2014\nthis Hungarian lawyer arranged for him to go to the hospital and he was very, very\nsick. At that point, my uncle made some sort of arrangements with somebody to\npick us up, my brother and me, and brought us to Budapest, by train, I remember.\nWe went to Budapest and then he put us up with his friend, he had a lady friend\nwhile he was \u2014 while he was there he had lots of lady friends.",
        "Q: This is your uncle, yeah.",
        "A: And so we stayed with \u2014 with his friend at the time, was a lovely Polish\nwoman, beautiful woman. And she \u2014 so she \u2014 we lived with her, and then my\nuncle came and \u2014 and you know, he was there in the evenings and all the time, but\nwe basically lived with her. And my parents went to the hospital. Was a convent\nhospital, and my father was apparently very sick, which I didn\u2019t know any more,\nbecause we had left. And my mother said that they came ahe \u2014 and they actually\ncame for \u2014 you know, to give him unction, and these were these priests, and my\nmother told him how he had to confess, he had to make a last confession. And of\ncourse, he didn\u2019t have to do it so well, because it was in Hungarian [break]\n100January 5, 1996",
        "Q: You were talking about your father having the gall bladder attack.",
        "A: Right. So he went to the hospital. I understand he was ex \u2014 very, very sick. My\nmother claimed that after he had the last confession and they did do his \u2014 the rites\nand all of that, he started improving. She actually believed \u2014",
        "Q: But he did make a confession?",
        "A: Yes, yes, but he confessed \u2014 he was very sick and he was probably, you know,\neven not quite lucid. I mean, he spoke in Polish and they didn\u2019t \u2014 these were\nHungarian priests, so whatever he mumbled, she sort of improvised half Polish,\nher Hungarian wasn\u2019t so great either, was not the pun \u2014 you know, our obligation\nto know Hungarian. So anyhow, she said the confession went very well, but she\nalways told it as a very amusing story, how he after that started improving. And he\n\u2014 so he was in this hospital for a few weeks, and she was with him. She \u2014 you\nknow, they very often let relatives stay in European hospitals, it\u2019s still common in\nBrazil, even. But anyway, after that \u2014 and we were hidden \u2014 not hidden, but living\nwith this woman, hidden in a way, because we couldn\u2019t go out. And then later, my\nuncle placed us with the janitor of a villa which was owned by Jewish antique\ndealer, who had been a contact of my uncles before the war. It was now occupied\nby a Dutch \u2014 I don\u2019t know, official, or somebody who was doing a lot of business\nwith the Germans. And my uncle met him because he knew both the janitor and\nthe previous owner. The previous owner, by the way, survived in one of those\n101January 5, 1996\nJewish houses in \u2014 in Budapest, he was not deported, he did survive. And so my\nuncle placed us in this villa, 1t was in Buda, right on top of a mountain, near a\ncemetery, I remember, with this janitor and his wife. So we were there. My\nparents, when they returned from Szeged from the hospital, stayed with some\nfriends or some people they knew in Budapest. This was already now getting\nclose to the end, and confusion was rampant. This was already \u2014 the Russians were\nvery close.",
        "Q: What we haven\u2019t talked about is your relationship with your brother.",
        "A: My brother was a nuisance, throughout the war. My brother was \u2014 I always\nthought \u2014 my \u2014 my father, you see, my fath - my mother was his second wife, and\nhe was not young. My father was born in 1887, so when my brother was born, he\nwas close to 50. So my father had very little \u2014 and he was a very autocratic kind of\nauthoritarian person. He had very little understanding, knowledge or anything\nabout children. Children were supposed to be quiet and obey. And my brother was\nlively, had nothing to do \u2014 I mean we \u2014 we had nothing to do, it\u2019s very \u2014 now I see\nhow difficult it was, but as a result of it, he was a terrible nuisance. He \u2014 he \u2014 my\nfather was constantly yelling at him, my uncle often used to beat him up, he was\nbeaten very often. He was a terrible nuisance, because he \u2014 he couldn\u2019t just\nbehave. And I, as a child, or \u2014 I was only a year and a half older, I was very\nmature, and I was very quiet. So I was no problem. My mother taught me how to\n102January 5, 1996\ndarn, my mother taught me how to knit. Later on I knew how to read, so I used to\nread \u2014 not appropriate things, because she \u2014 whatever Polish book she had, I could\nsit there and decipher it, whether I liked the story or not, because that was\nsomething to do. I did all kinds of word games and so on. My brother wasn\u2019t\ninterested in any of that, and he didn\u2019t do any of that. So he really \u2014 I don\u2019t\nremember what he did except make a terrible nuisance of himself. So \u2014 and I\nalways, whenever they f-\u2014 they also fought about him, because my mother\nprotected him, my father got angry at him, my mother protected him. So he was a\nproblem, and I always thought that he was the problem, I didn\u2019t know, nor did I\nunderstand that the circumstances were the problem, and he was just a naturally \u2014\na normal child who was in terrible conditions.",
        "Q: Did you talk about the dangers with your brother? Did \u2014 did you confide in\neach other about your fears, and \u2014",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t \u2014 maybe I did and maybe I didn\u2019t, I don\u2019t remember. No, I don\u2019t\nremember. I remember playing with him sometimes. I remember taking care of\nhim sometimes when he became impossible. My father would say, you take care\nof him, and I tried to \u2014 to make him be quiet. I don\u2019t know \u2014 we both were afraid\nat \u2014 as a matter of fact, I told you that I did an oral history in Brazil in Portuguese,\nand I have those tapes, but because of my brother, because he did one over there\nand they were \u2014 they had a program on Jewish refugees a few years ago, and the \u2014\n103January 5, 1996\nthe focus was, what do people take when they\u2019re running away, do they take their\npictures, do they take jewelry, do they take medals\u2019? I mean, depending, different\npeople took different things. But that was the focus, and with that they had a few\noral histories. And it is amazing how different his perception was of what\nhappened. How he was afraid \u2014 the basic facts are the same, but like he was afraid\nat different times, he remembers different moments as being the worst or the best,\nand \u2014 from me. And we were only a year and a half apart, so \u2014 but I do know that\nhe was a problem. He was a problem because he \u2014 he had \u2014 he was a problem;\nmade noise, got on people\u2019s nerves, because he was bored. So I \u2014 you know, I\ntolerated \u2014 I \u2014 I identified with the grownups and the people who knew that \u2014 that\nyou had to behave. And \u2014 and \u2014 and he \u2014 and I saw him the same way,\nunfortunately, I\u2019ve \u2014 today I\u2019m sorry about it, as my father did, that he was a\nnuisance and he didn\u2019t know how to behave and he didn\u2019t know that he had to be\nquiet. So, I did not identify with him, nor with his problems. I didn\u2019t identify with\nhis problems til many years later, when I had my own children and I realized that\nchildren \u2014 what children really need and so on. But during the war he was a pain in\nthe neck, he really was. And, I think we\u2019ll stop here, because otherwise I\u2019ll be very\nlate.",
        "Q: Okay.\nEnd of Tape Three\n104March 1, 1999\nBeginning Tape Four, Side A",
        "Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\nvolunteer collection interview with Riane Gruss. Previously, tape number one was\nrecorded on April 22\", 1994 in Chevy Chase, Maryland. And tapes number two\nand three were recorded on January 5\", 1996, in New York City. Today\u2019s interview\nis conducted, as before, by Gail Schwartz, on March 1*, 1999, in Chevy Chase,\nMaryland. This is tape number four, side A. And just to clarify where we are, and\nyour age, you are 12 years old, it is mid-1944, and you are living in Buda at the\ntime.",
        "A: That\u2019s correct, except that my impression is that it was fall 1944, and we \u2014 at that\npoint we were in Buda; we meaning my brother and I, because my parents stayed on\nin Szeged longer because my father was sick. He was first in the hospital, then he\nstayed for as long as they could in the house of the lawyer who was able to get us\nout of jail. He was a lawyer who was quite prominent in Szeged, had a large\napartment, because I remember it, because that\u2019s where went directly from prison,\nwe went to his apartment, and we stayed there a day or two before my brother and I\nleft for Budapest, and he \u2014 and my father went to \u2014 got sick and stayed on and\nended up in the hospital. Now we are in Buda at the janitor of a friend of my uncle\u2019s\n\u2014 oh, not a friend really, but an acquaintance who was in the same business as my\n105March 1, 1999\nuncle, he was a art dealer in Budapest, and he had a villa in Buda where he lived,\nand on the property he had a caretaker and his wife. It was a small house on the\nproperty, separate. And that\u2019s where my uncle placed us. And that\u2019s where we were\nliving, and it wasn\u2019t bad there, it was fine. I mean, they fed us and they were quite\nnice to us, we were not supposed to be running around too much, although we could\ngo into the garden, but we were not going out too much. And my uncle would come\nand visit us quite often. Eventually, my parents came back to Budapest, and we did\nnot see them, at least I don\u2019t remember seeing them. And I think they stayed\nsomewhere, with someone for a very short time, because then my father got sick\nagain. And he went to the hospital, and from what I understand, he was operated \u2014\nhe had gall bladder problems, that \u2014 that was his u \u2014 these various stays in the\nhospital ha \u2014 were gall bladder attacks. And I think he was oper \u2014 not only I think, I\nknow, he was operated by a surgeon as th \u2014 people called them then a professor\nsomething, pr \u2014 I don\u2019t remember his name. And the surgeon realized that they were\n\u2014 who they were, or what they were and he decided to help them, I presume. And he\nkept my father in the hospital beyond \u2014 beyond what was necessary. Today you\ncan\u2019t do that, but then you did. And he was a prominent \u2014 he was prominent in this\nhospital, and my parents had a private room, and my mother stayed with him, which\nwas very common in those days. And he \u2014 they were liberated 1n the hospital. So for\n106March 1, 1999\nthem this was a marvelous thing, because he just kept him on and on. And he wasn\u2019t\nterribly well, he was weak, he was after surgery, so there was some justification in\nthat. But anyhow, that\u2019s where they were liberated. We, on the other side \u2014 on the\nother hand were in Buda in \u2014 with this janitor, and my uncle was the one who kept\ncoming to us and visiting us. And \u2014 and yo \u2014 sort of looking after us. And while this\nwas going on, of course the front was getting closer and closer, the Russians were\ncoming closer and closer, and Budapest was encircled. So the siege of Budapest\nwas about, I think, five or six weeks, it was quite long.",
        "Q: Before we get to that, which is important, you were a 12 year old child at the\ntime. You are separated from your parents. Do you remember this as being a very\nfrightening time? Did you have nightmares, did you know what was going on? Were\nyou really, truly aware of what was happening?",
        "A: Twelve years in those days was not really a child. I was very aware of what was\ngoing on, I was very \u2014 was I frightened? I was afraid \u2014 not \u2014 I was afraid because\nalso the gun \u2014 you heard \u2014 by then you were beginning to hear a lot of guns and\nshooting, and there were bombings, the Russians were flying over Budapest with\ntheir planes, and so on. Was I afraid? Yes, I was afraid all the time. My one vivid\nmemory from that time is that that\u2019s when I first got my period. And I didn\u2019t know\nwho to turn to. I didn\u2019t have any kind of protection, and it was horrible. And it \u2014 that\n107March 1, 1999\n\u2014 that I remember very clearly. And then I told \u2014I guess I told my uncle, and he said\nit was normal, and he spoke to this woman there and she gave me some rags, which\nI had to wash out, but they were very hard to keep between my legs, because they\nkept falling out. And that\u2019s my one vivid memory from that period. But was I\nafraid? Yes, I \u2014 but \u2014 but as I said, you were afraid most of the time. I was less\nafraid then that we would be caught or \u2014 or something horrible would happen,\nbecause things were very stable in a way, we \u2014 you know, there was this couple and\nthey took care of us, and they were nice to us, and there was, I guess, enough food.\nIt wasn\u2019t we \u2014 1-it was okay, it was \u2014 it was one of the sort of stable sort of moments.\nWe were not running away, we were not \u2014 it wasn\u2019t \u2014 we were maybe a little lonely,\nbut I don\u2019t remember that so distinctly. I remember being very excited every time\nmy uncle came and \u2014 to see us. And \u2014",
        "Q: What was your relationship with your brother at that point, who was a year and a\nhalf younger?",
        "A: Right. I don\u2019t remember him being particularly difficult at that point. It was\nprobably very good at that point. We were just on our own, and he didn\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t\nremember him as \u2014 in any way at that point. All I remember is that I was always told\nthat I was the older one, I was the more mature one, and I was sort of looking after\nhim a little, but he \u2014 I don\u2019t remember him being any problem.\n108March 1, 1999",
        "Q: Did you think about your parents a lot while you were separated from them?",
        "A: Yes, but I was much more dependent on my uncle, I must say. I\u2014I\u2014I felt that \u2014\nthat he was the one who was instrumental in either us surviving or not surviving. He\n\u2014my father, you have to know, was helpless, was sick, and \u2014 at the time, so while I\n\u2014 I thought about them, I don\u2019t remember \u2014 I knew they were in the hospital, my\nuncle told me that they were safe, that they \u2014 this professor was going to keep them\nthere. And so no, the answer is, I wasn\u2019t agonizing over what\u2019s happening to them,\nno. I was more agonizing about my uncle coming and making sure that we all were\nright, because I knew that he \u2014 it was all dependent on him, it was his relationship\nwith these people, 1t was him taking care of us, and he was much more resourceful at\nma \u2014 than my parents were at the time, and he was alone, and he was vital and\ninteresting, and he was a great person.",
        "Q: What \u2014 what kind of relationship did you have with the couple who was taking\ncare of you? Were they \u2014 was it a warm relationship?",
        "A: No. No, it was not a warm relationship. I just remember them as being civil and\nnice to us, but it was not a warm, warm relationship, at least not \u2014 not that I am\naware of, no.",
        "Q: Were there any other children in the house?",
        "A: No, they were a childless couple.\n109March 1, 1999",
        "Q: And did you have any schooling during that time?",
        "A: No. No, no schooling whatsoever, zero. Because at that point, this \u2014 much before\nthat, when we were living in the settlement with all the Polish refugees at that point,\nM-Mtrs. Rochinska(ph) was teaching us, but this was \u2014 by then we had lost contact\nwith her, and she probably remained, she was really critch \u2014 Christian. And we\nstarted running a \u2014 from one place to another. No, no schooling whatsoever.",
        "Q: Did you feel at that point Viennese, or Polish? What \u2014 what did you think you\nwere as a 12 year old?",
        "A: Nothing. No, we \u2014 it \u2014I\u2014I-\u2014no, I didn\u2019t feel like \u2014 I don\u2019t think I felt like\nanything in particular, certainly not Hungarian, certainly not Austrian. If anything,\nall through my life, I identify much more with Poland than with any of the other\ncountries, because I know even now, when I pick up a newspaper and there\u2019s\nsomething about Poland, I'll read it, if 1t\u2019s something about Austria, I don\u2019t, and\nsomething about Hungary, also much less. So no, definitely Polish, if anything, yes,\nPolish.",
        "Q: So what did you and your brother do during the day?",
        "A: That\u2019s a very good question, because I have no recollection what we did. I really\ndon\u2019t know, I think we probably did nothing. I don\u2019t know. I don \u2014 I don\u2019t know\nwhat we did. I don\u2019t know if we played, or talked, or \u2014 or \u2014 I \u2014 I don\u2019t have any\n110March 1, 1999\nrecol \u2014 I think maybe she gave us some little things to do, like little chores and \u2014 I\ndon\u2019t even remember her name. But I don\u2019t remember doing it.",
        "Q: Did you have any contact with other children at all during tho-those months?",
        "A: None whatsoever, none. Absolutely none, because the idea was that we shouldn\u2019t\nbe seen too much, we \u2014 you know, nobody was exactly very proud of having these\ntwo children suddenly there that she never had before. So we were definitely not \u2014\nno, no contact with other children, I don\u2019t remember any contact with other children.",
        "Q: Was it easy for you to sleep, or did you have frightening nightmares at that time?",
        "A: No, I always slept fine, and I don\u2019t remember any frightening nightmares, no, no,\nnone \u2014 none whatsoever. Actually, what I do remember is that we slept \u2014 they had a\nbig bed, and we slept with them in that huge bed.",
        "Q: The four of you?",
        "A: Yeah, all four of us, yeah.",
        "Q: What was that like?",
        "A: Not pleasant. No, I didn\u2019t like that, no, no. Mm-mm.",
        "Q: Did they do that for purposes of safety, or just because of room?",
        "A: I think lack of room, lack of room. It was a tiny little house, and it was not \u2014 I\nthink it was for lack of room, yeah, but there was absolutely no \u2014 no privacy.\n111March 1, 1999\nEverybody was always touching everybody, I didn\u2019t like that. Yeah, I didn\u2019t like\nthat.",
        "Q: But wa-was there any uncomfortable advances by the man\u2019?",
        "A: Yes. And I remember that, and that was very unpleasant and then I told my\nbrother to sleep next to me, and then there was this mishmash about who was\nsleeping where, and of course she wasn\u2019t aware of it, and so she \u2014 you know, it \u2014 it\nstopped, it wasn\u2019t very long. It just happened once or twice, yeah.",
        "Q: But did you say anything to the man?",
        "A: No. No, I was much too afraid, no.",
        "Q: Okay, and then the next \u2014",
        "A: Then, the most dramatic event I remember was that my uncle told me that he\nwould come and stay with us. We realized that we were being \u2014 that we were\nencircled, and that eventually there will be a fight, and there\u2019Il be a siege. And my\nuncle said that when things get really bad, and the fighting becomes very, you know,\ndangerous, he would come and stay with us. He wasn\u2019t going to leave us there by\nourselves. And that was my biggest concern, that \u2014 that the fighting would start, and\n\u2014 and we would be all alone. And that I was really afraid of. So, I don\u2019t remember\nhow it was, but I do remember that I used to meet my uncle \u2014 there was also another\ndanger, that if somebody \u2014 something suspicious happens, like somebody came to \u2014\n112March 1, 1999\nto ask questions, or to ask why we were there, or who were we, or any kind of police\nvisit or inquiry, I was supposed to warn my uncle, because he was much more\nvulnerable be \u2014 not much more vulnerable, but really vulnerable. In other words, if\nthey were suspicious of us, he didn\u2019t want to come there, because they would arrest\nhim. They would certainly watch him. So \u2014",
        "Q: How \u2014 how would you warn him?",
        "A: Well, that was \u2014 I knew exactly where he was st \u2014 coming, I knew the route he\nwas taking, and there wa \u2014 there was that streetcar, and he had to get off on the last\nstop of the streetcar and it was near a cemetery, and I knew, you know, I knew the\nneighborhood a little, so I knew how \u2014 and each time, I would meet him there when\nhe came. He would tell me when he is coming and I would wait for him there,\nsometimes for very long periods of time. And when they were already really close\nand were shooting and so on, the last time, before he s \u2014 before he actually remained\nwith us, I went to meet him and he always talked about that. They were actually\nshooting and I was hiding behind \u2014 alongside the graves, because the route took me\nthrough the \u2014 through the cemetery. And I got to the end station where I was\nsupposed to wait for him, but the \u2014 the trams weren\u2019t coming very regularly any\nmore, so I waited there for a very long time, he had to walk part of the way. But he\ncame, and he was always very impressed that I made it to meet him, that I was \u2014 that\n113March 1, 1999\nI was courageous enough to do it. He said no one else, when they were shooting,\nwould have done it, but I was always very reliable and dependable, and at that point\nI certainly was even more so, I imagine. That was what I was \u2014 wanted to do, and\nthat\u2019s what I \u2014 was expected of me, so I did it. Anyway, he came, and then we\ntogether ran back, you know, hiding and falling to the ground. It was the real\nshooting by then. And then he stayed with us. And the \u2014",
        "Q: But what part of Buda were \u2014 were you staying in? Can you be a little more\nspecific about area?",
        "A: I cannot. As a matter of fact, we went back, my husband and I went to Budapest\nin about 1982 or so, and I tried to ra \u2014 locate the \u2014 the street, and I couldn\u2019t. I\ncouldn\u2019t. I know it was a\u2014a par \u2014 a residential part of Buda, quite \u2014 because Buda,\nth-the \u2014 the lower part of Buda is part of the city, so that\u2019s very much like a city,\nlike Pest, only that it\u2019s the nicer part, it\u2019s the older part of the city. But where we\nwere was a residential part and was a si \u2014 and it was on top of a hill. I remember\nthat, and then there was this \u2014 and it was the last stop of the trolley car. I couldn\u2019t\nremember where it \u2014 I mean, I \u2014 we went there and we walked around and there was\na hill. But what looked to me at that time as a big hill was probably a minute hill.\nAnd so we tried to find it, no, we couldn\u2019t. So I don\u2019t know what part of Budapest.\n114March 1, 1999",
        "Q: Was it hard for your brother when you would go to meet your uncle, and you\nwould leave him alone in the house? Do you think that was hard for him?",
        "A: Never asked him, there was no choice. He just stayed there, and that was it. My\nuncle said that I have to go by myself. I \u2014 was always safer for girls than for boys.",
        "Q: Why is that?",
        "A: Because of the circumcision. If you were caught, for a girl it was much easier\nthan for a boy. So he had to stay home and that \u2014 and also you \u2014 you know, I didn\u2019t\nwant to bother with him; he was younger, he was \u2014 anyhow, it was my job an-and I\nnever thought much about what he felt when he stayed behind. Then we went \u2014 so\nanyway, then we came back, and by that time we no longer stayed in the \u2014 1n the\ncaretaker\u2019s house, because by that time the Germans were really on the run, and\nthere was less danger of being arrested or something by the Germans. They were not\nso much on the run as they were occupied by other things. They were fighting. And\nwe moved into the main house, and my uncle was able to get the old couple, who\nwere actually the antique dealer and his wife, they were in a \u2014 what they called it \u2014\nthey were hidden someplace in Buda \u2014 in \u2014 in Pest, I think. I don\u2019t know exactly,\nbut my uncle was able to get them out to wherever they were, and helped them come\nto our \u2014 come to their \u2014 what was their home, what was their house, and they\nprepared the cellar. And we were all in the cellar of the villa, because that was safer.\n115March 1, 1999\nIt was a real cellar, so it was more like a shelter. And that\u2019s where we were. So it\nwas the old couple, my uncle and the two of us, and the caretaker and his wife\nwould come in there and stay for a while and then go back to their house. They were\nin and out, I remember. There was a Dutch man \u2014 by the way, that\u2019s how we were\nactually able to stay with the caretaker. There was a Dutch man, I think \u2014 well, this\nwill make a lot of sense, I think 1t was Menton(ph). Menton(ph) is a very well-\nknown name because there was a book written about him, and then my uncle, after\nthe war, was in a very controversial situation with him. Menton(ph) lived, or his\nfriend, lived in the villa, and that\u2019s how we were able to stay with the caretaker, and\nthere was no suspic \u2014 I mean, nobody looked at who we were and what we were.\nAnd so \u2014 but by then, Menton(ph) had fled, because he was obviously friendly with\nthe Germans, and he was afraid and I think if he went to Holland \u2014 he \u2014 he was\ngone and the villa was empty. So the rightful owners came back, they were very old.\nAs a matter of fact, she died during the siege. And \u2014 and then \u2014 and we all stayed in\nthe shelter of that \u2014 or in the \u2014 what was the shelter, but what was n-not really a\nshelter, it was just the cellar of the villa. And during the fight \u2014 by then it was\nwinter, because we were liberated in January. So it was freezing cold \u2014",
        "Q: Did you continue to menstruate once you started, under all that stress?\n116March 1, 1999",
        "A: I don\u2019t think I menstruated because I don\u2019t remember it after that, I remember\nthat \u2014 but I think that\u2019s very common when you first begin, you have a period and\nthen for several months you don\u2019t. I don\u2019t remember any periods after that.",
        "Q: When you had your first one, did you know what it was? Had you had any \u2014",
        "A: Maybe \u2014 maybe that was not my first one, because I now remember \u2014 no,\nactually I made a mistake, it was not my first one. I did get it then, and what I told\nyou about the rags, I remember, and it was terrible. But I don\u2019t think 1t was my first\none, I think it was my second one, because I did know what it was, and I remember\nthe first one I got, I think when we were in Leanyfalu, where Mrs. Rochinska(ph)\nwas teaching us and there was a relative period of quiet, and I was 11, and that\u2019s\nwhen I got my first period, and I remember I had no clue what it was, and I thought\nthat I had gotten \u2014 what is it called? Not diphtheria, that is \u2014 a disease \u2014",
        "Q: Typhoid?",
        "A: I think it\u2019s typhoid where you bleed from the rectum. So I thought I was deadly\nill, and when I saw the blood on the paper and I told my mother and that\u2019s when she\ntold me what it was. So this must have been my second period. And then again, I\ndon\u2019t remember having a period til late \u2014 much later. No, I did not have any. So we\nstayed, all of us in that cellar, and I don\u2019t remember what we ate, but I remember\nthere wasn\u2019t terribly much. Mostly I think potatoes, from what I remember, and I\n117March 1, 1999\ndon\u2019t remember how it was prepared, I don\u2019t \u2014 there was a little stove, little\nprimos(ph) what was called a little, I guess a little with kerosene or something, a\nlittle stove, and I think we had mostly potatoes. And \u2014",
        "Q: Did you have anything special with you that gave you comfort? A special book,\nor some special object?",
        "A: That\u2019s a good question. I had a watch that my uncle gave me, that Brenda has\ntoday, that my uncle gave me for my, I guess 11\" or 12\" birthday, I don\u2019t remember\nwhich one, but it was during the war. Must have been 11\". And I absolutely loved\nthat watch. That watch was my prime possession, it was sign of maturity, it was\neverything, a symbol of everything. And I always wore it, of course, and that watch\nI liked a lot. And then when the Russians did occupy us \u2014 I\u2019Il go back to that, but\none of the things that I remember vividly is that my uncle realized \u2014 I didn\u2019t know\nabout it, but he knew that they were raping women, and they were actually no \u2014 not\na very kind liberators, but \u2014 and it was rough, and he wanted to protect me, so he\ntold me that \u2014 they also used to be crazy about watches, they took watches by the\ndozen and they would line them up on their arms, and \u2014 from the wrist up, and they\n\u2014 that was sort of like their status symbol as \u2014 as to how many they could get. It was\nreally weird that \u2014 how they focused on the watches. So my uncle told me that, you\nknow, if I wanted to protect my watch and not have them take it, and Ill \u2014 he knew I\n118March 1, 1999\nloved that watch, then I would have to hide under the bed. And that\u2019s what I did.\nAnd that I remember distinctly, that every time we heard steps on top, I would run\nand hide under the bed with my watch on my wrist.",
        "Q: Did you know what rape meant? Did he explain it to you?",
        "A: No, he didn\u2019t tell me, he just told me that I had to protect my watch, if I wanted \u2014\nso that\u2019s \u2014 he \u2014 I had no clue as to why he was so concerned, but I \u2014 but I believed\nhim, you know, that that was the thing, they were robbing and that\u2019s what was the\nthing. The other thing I remember distinctly is that the \u2014 they \u2014 the Russians je \u2014\nsince it was a fighting situation, there was a fight going on, he \u2014 [phone ringing] \u2014\nso they would \u2014 th-the Russians, because it wou \u2014 they were fighting, I guess, to\nmake sure that they survive, they would \u2014 wou \u2014 throw grenades into cellars before\nthey came in, because that way they would be sure that it wasn\u2019t some Germans,\nwho would shoot at them when they started coming down. So the big danger was\nthat they would do that. So every time we heard steps on top, I went under the bed\nwith my watch and \u2014 bed, it was a kind of cot, and my uncle would run up the steps\nand scream in Russian, you know, the \u2014 we \u2014 there are just children here, and we are\nfriends and so on. Don\u2019t \u2014 don\u2019t kill, don\u2019t shoot, don\u2019t \u2014 and he would make a \u2014 he\nwould talk to them and \u2014 and they never did, obviously, otherwise we wouldn\u2019t have\nsurvived. And he would \u2014 and then, you know, they would go away, they would \u2014\n119March 1, 1999\nno, I don\u2019t remember them ever \u2014 they would come down and look around and see\nthat ever \u2014 you know, that there are no \u2014 that no Germans are hiding, and they would\njust go away and that was the end. But this happened a couple of times, about I\nwould say three or four times it happened. And then, as they occupied more and\nmore of the city, and we also knew already that Pest had fallen, Pest \u2014 they \u2014 the\nGermans did not defend Pest like Buda. They gave that up and they went in \u2014 they \u2014\nbecause Buda had a hill and a castle, they occupied that, and from there they were\ndefending themselves. From the castle, so they \u2014 they were in Buda much longer.\nAnd \u2014",
        "Q: At that point, or up to that point, did your uncle tell you what was happening in\nthe other countries in Europe? Were you aware of what was happening outside your\nimmediate life?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember. I \u2014 all I remember being concerned about, and \u2014 and knowing\nwas how the front was progressing. In other words, both the \u2014 the \u2014 you know, the\ninvasion in \u2014 in Normandy, | knew that the Americans had invaded Europe on the\nother side, and the Russians were coming on this side and eventually they would\nliberate us. I knew the Germans were losing the war. I knew that, but what exactly\nwas happening in other countries? No, I don\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t think I was too concerned\n120March 1, 1999\nabout that. I think we were really focused on ourselves, totally and completely. We\ncouldn\u2019t really care what happened anywhere else, it was \u2014 and at least \u2014",
        "Q: Had you heard about, in 1943, the Warsaw ghetto uprising?",
        "A: No, didn\u2019t know anything about the Warsaw ghetto, didn\u2019t know anything about\n\u2014 I knew that they were deporting people to camps. I don\u2019t think that I knew too\nmuch \u2014 I knew that it was bad. I knew that \u2014 that they were killing people, I knew\nthat \u2014 but the exact \u2014 I think I knew that they have gas chambers. I knew that \u2014 that\nbeing deported was the end. That I knew. But I didn\u2019t know exactly about the\nuprising and so on. Don\u2019t forget that the uprising was probably not described in the\npress, and we didn\u2019t have foreign fr \u2014 foreign press, and I don\u2019t even remember\nseeing \u2014 I could read, and I could read Hungarian as well. So I remember he \u2014\nreading headlines in the Hungarian newspaper, because she bought the newspaper,\nthe woman where we were hiding. But I don\u2019t rec \u2014 they certainly wouldn\u2019t write\nabout that, so \u2014 I just know that we were \u2014 knew the \u2014 how the \u2014 the Russian forces\nwere advancing, and that was our prime concern, you know, how quickly will this\nbe over. And so after we were occupied and were safe, basically for \u2014 safe in the\nsense that \u2014 that no Germans would come and get us, for a few days, and more and\nmore of the area was liberated, we heard that most of Buda was liberated, and the\nconditions in the cellar deteriorated. I mean, she died. She was buried in \u2014 in \u2014 the\n121March 1, 1999\nowner\u2019s wife, the old lady, and I remember we buried her in the garden in the\nmiddle of the night. And that was before we were liberated. And I also remember\nthat the ground was terribly, terribly hard, because it was winter, it was all frozen.",
        "Q: Was this your first contact with a dead body?",
        "A: Yes. I never knew any other dead body, but she was very old, and I don\u2019t\nremember being very upset. I was only very upset about having to bury her and\ndoing this whole thing, because that was scarier, to go up and \u2014 and \u2014 and be outside\nof the cellar and \u2014 and \u2014 and bury her and get \u2014 get her out of the cellar.",
        "Q: So you helped to actually dig the hole?",
        "A: Yeah, I did help. I did help dig the hole. And so at \u2014 and also, food was getting\nshorter, and it was cold. I mean, the conditions were very, very horrible. So my\nuncle decided, when he heard that more and more of Buda was liberated and Pest\nwas already occupied by the Russians, and we knew also, because we heard that the\nbur \u2014 bridges had all been exploded, because the Germans, when they retreated to \u2014\nto Buda, they \u2014 they explo \u2014\nEnd of Tape Four, Side A\nBeginning Tape Four, Side B",

        "A: So we \u2014 we knew some people who were living close to the Danube, and so my\nuncle decided to leave our cellar and to try to get over to these other people\u2019s house,\nand see what\u2019s happening to them, and also try to get closer to the Danube to cross\nthe Danube, and \u2014 and meet my parents, and get us across to my parents. And that\u2019s\nwhat we did, and that\u2019s what I remember as the most vivid and horrible thing,\nbecause th-there was snow on the ground, and there were dead bodies all over, beca\n\u2014 and dead horses. And dead horses had these wide open eyes, and so we had to s \u2014\nliterally step over these dead bodies; dead Germans, dead Russians and dead horses.\nAnd we finally got to their house \u2014",
        "Q: Can you talk a little bit more \u2014 what that\u2019s like for a 12 year old to experience\nthat?",
        "A: I \u2014it\u2019s hard for me t-to talk in greater detail except that I was \u2014 it was \u2014 it was\nfrightening, it was like a nightmare. And we had to \u2014 it was physically also difficult,\nyou had to get over these things and it was slippery and we didn\u2019t have the best\nshoes and it was cold. It was all those things, and I remember that as being one of\nthe most horrible walks, so to speak, that I ever took. But anyway, we \u2014 and that \u2014",
        "Q: Did \u2014 did your uncle comfort you at all, or did you ask him questions?",
        "A: No, there was nothing to ask. I mean, I knew it was the aftermath of a battle, and\ndid he comfort us? No, because he was equally as upset as \u2014 you know, it was\n123March 1, 1999\nequally ha \u2014 people in tho \u2014 at least my \u2014 my experience was that except for my\nmother occasionally, when they were \u2014 when we were in jail, and things were sort of\nstatic, this was not static, you had to move. It\u2019s like \u2014 it\u2019s like comforting a child\nwho got up on top of a hill and doesn\u2019t know how to ski down. So you comforted,\nyou \u2014 you \u2014 you \u2014 but you have to get down. So that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s more or less\n[indecipherable] I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good analogy, but there wasn\u2019t time to talk.\nThere was \u2014 you had to move, you had to \u2014 you had to walk, and it was at night, and\nit was dark, and it was hard. But he \u2014 I guess he pushed us. He \u2014 I don\u2019t know what\nhe did, I don\u2019t remember, but all I remember is that that was a very difficult,\nmiserable walk. And then we got to their house, and they had been liberated for a\nfew days also, and they were still in the cellar, because most people s \u2014 remained\nthere. There was no pl \u2014 mu \u2014 many of the houses on top were destroyed. Or it was\nfreezing cold, 1t was warmer in the cellar. So they were down below, and there was\nhardly any room for us, but somehow we \u2014 of course, we had to stay there, so we\nstayed there. But the worst thing was that during the night, the Germans broke out\nfrom the castle, and it was \u2014 that was the last \u2014 they were encircled and that was the\nlast time they broke out and that they made any stand, and that they re-occupied our\nhouse. And that was terrible. And they took out all the men in our cellar and they \u2014\nat \u2014 these were people that my uncle knew and I don\u2019t remember who they were. All\n124March 1, 1999\nI remember is that they went \u2014 they made all the men go upstairs and they killed\nthree of them while we were there. Now, how my uncle escaped being killed, I don\u2019t\nremember. I don\u2019t think he went up with them. They said, all the inhabitants 1n this\nhouse have to come upstairs \u2014 all the men. And so they did, and they killed them.\nThis was in the last minute, we were only occupied for another few hours. And then\nthe Russians advanced, and the Germans \u2014 you know, it was like a last desperate\nattempt on their part, and it was horrible that we ha \u2014 we were there. And \u2014",
        "Q: Did you hear the shots?",
        "A: Yes, oh yes, I heard the shots, and then I heard, you know, the despair of th-the\nwives, and you know. And my uncle, I don\u2019t remember how he \u2014 whether he hid, or\nwhether he didn\u2019t go up. I remember only that three of them were killed, and he was\nvery upset by that, because it was in the last minute, you know, it was such a\nhorrible thing that you had to \u2014 that \u2014 that that\u2019s what happened at the end. And then\nwe were re-occupied by the Russians, and we didn\u2019t stay after that, we just went as\nfar as the Danube. We tried to cross over and my uncle \u2014 by then I remember he\nsort of used us, my brother and me, you know. Here we were these children, and the\nparents were on the other side and so on. So because there was a har \u2014 a priority for\npeople crossing, there was a pontoon bridge by then. And they didn\u2019t want civilians\ncrossing back and forth, I mean, this was still wartime. So he, you know, by saying\n125March 1, 1999\nthese are the paren \u2014 the parents are over there and these are the children and so on,\nthey let us \u2014 he convinced them. And what we had to do was go from boat to boat,\nbecause this was a pontoon bridge, and they needed people to get the water out of\nthese little boats, because these boats kept leaking, and they were filling up with\nwater. So it took us hours and hours, because we were going from one boat to the\nnext, slowly crossing that bridge and helping get the water out of the boats. And\nthen the next dramatic thing was that we go to Buda and we went straight to the\nhospital, and they had on the gate, they had a list of people who had survived, and\nmy parents were not on it. And then I remember we got a terrible shock and started\nscreaming and yelling. And it turned out that the reason there \u2014 they had survived,\nthe reason the list \u2014 they were not on that list was because the list was of people who\nwere still there, who had survived were \u2014 and were in the hospital. And my parents,\nbecause they were there only mainly because of being hidden there, the minute the\nRussians occupied Pest, they left and went to some friends\u2019 house. We knew where\nto look for them, and we came there and \u2014",
        "Q: Let\u2019s go back to the experience on \u2014 on the little boats and the pontoon bridge.\nWhere did you have the energy to do what you were required to do? You said\nemptying out the buckets of water and so forth. Where did you get the strength? You\nwere 12 years old.\n126March 1, 1999",
        "A: I guess I did as much as I could. I don\u2019t know how much strength I had. Maybe \u2014\nmaybe it wasn\u2019t, you know, as \u2014 as efficient as it was supposed to be, but that\u2019s what\nwe were told to do, and there were these containers and we took the water. Maybe\nthe containers were not that big, maybe they had small and bigger containers. I don\u2019t\nremember that, but I do remember doing it, yes. It was hard. It was hard. Everything\nthat \u2014 those last few days were very, very hard. Was hard. And then the emotio \u2014 by\nthen the \u2014 I also remember the emotional stress, because by then we knew we are\ngoing over, and we are going to now be reunited with my parents, and while I wasn\u2019t\nthinking about them maybe continuously all the time, this was a very exciting\nmoment for us, and I remembered that. And I do remember when we didn\u2019t see their\nnames on that list; 1t was horrifying, and we were crying and we were screaming and\nI\u2014 my uncle said, you know, let \u2014 you know, don\u2019t cry, and everything will \u2014 will be\nall right, and let me ask and see what happened, and so on, so forth. So then we went\ninside and we spoke to \u2014 1t was run by nuns and we spoke to \u2014 to whoever was in the\noffice there, and they told us where my parents went, that they had left the hospital.",
        "Q: Did you have enough food up to that point?",
        "A: No, we did not have. During the whole siege, I told you was th \u2014 we had great\nshortages, I mean, I don\u2019t even remember what we ate, but I remember that we \u2014\nthere was very little to eat.\n127March 1, 1999",
        "Q: Were you wearing the same clothes all the time?",
        "A: Yes, yes. And I don\u2019t remember ever taking a bath or \u2014 oh, I do remember that\nwe were full of lice, and that we were \u2014 that \u2014 that kept us, by the way, quite busy,\nbecause we used to sit there and take our clothes off and kill the lice, one by one \u2014",
        "Q: How did you kill them?",
        "A: \u2014 between the nails of the two thumbs. That was a great occupation, you did it for\nhours and hours. And the problem is that you could never kill the eggs, and the eggs\nthen would develop, and there would be new lice. But the lice were horrible because\nthey were biting, and it was itching and it was horrible, yeah. So we were full of\nlice, full of lice. So when we got to there, where they were, everybody was in bad\nshape, because there was no food, there were terrible shortages, people were sick,\nfull of lice. And that\u2019s when we left, we left right after that, bec \u2014 we went to the\nsouth of Hungary, to a place called Mako, I think.",
        "Q: Le-Le-Let\u2019s talk about seeing your parents.",
        "A: Oh, that was very exciting, that was very exciting. We came there, my mother\nhugged us and kissed us and cried, and there was a lot of commotion. And it was\nquite a \u2014 quite a reunion. That was very, very exciting. Very exciting.",
        "Q: What kind of condition were they both in?\n128March 1, 1999",
        "A: Not as bad as we, because they had been liberated for at least two or \u2014 two weeks\nalready, and not that there was any abundance, because as I said, the c \u2014 the \u2014 the\nconditions were very hard. But I don\u2019t think they was in as bad a condition as we\nwere, because they \u2014 even the hospital, th-there was more hygiene and more food. I\ndon\u2019t think they had plenty, but there wa \u2014 I mean, they took care of the sick people,\nthey gave them a soup every day. No one was taking care of us. So I remember that\nthey were \u2014 and sh \u2014 my mother talked about it later, that they were appalled at, you\nknow, very upset by the way we both looked, and how \u2014 in what terrible shape we\nwere In.",
        "Q: How do you think you looked?",
        "A: Probably awful. And I remember they \u2014 they \u2014 the first thing they did also, we\nhad a lot of lice in our hair, and they cut off all my hair and they washed it with\nsome sort of kerosene and it smelled and burned and so on. So I remember that.\nHow did I look? Probably dirty, and ragged, and I don\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t have a clear\npicture of what we looked like, but probably awful. I don\u2019t remember that.",
        "Q: Did your mother or father say anything special to you, do you remember any\nparticular words?",
        "A: No. No, I don\u2019t remember. All I remember is that they kept saying we have to get\nout of here as fast as possible, because they \u2014 there was sickness, there was \u2014 we \u2014 I-\n129March 1, 1999\nI just remember primary concern about surviving this next danger, which was\nsickness, and \u2014 and you know, when there\u2019s no food, an-and hygiene conditions are\nso terrible, and there\u2019s a lot of illness around, it spreads. And so all I remember is\nthem saying that we have to get out of there as quickly as possible, and that\u2019s what\nwe did.",
        "Q: Did you feel free? Did you feel a relief?",
        "A: Ye-Yes, in that respect we did. I mean, we knew that the Germans were gone,\nthat nobody was going to deport us. But don\u2019t forget that the Russians and the chaos\nthat was right after liberation. It was not paradise. It was far from it. You didn\u2019t\nknow whether the Russians wouldn\u2019t grab you. Russians also did things that \u2014\nunexpected things. They either arrested you, or they decided you were a capitalist. I\nmean, we had experience with the Russians, we had been with them. So we knew\nwhat they were like. So it wasn\u2019t like it was paradise, plus the physical conditions,\nwhich were so bad. And the cold, 1t was the middle of winter, was January. So it\nwasn\u2019t like you know, now you\u2019re free, and you begin to live. As a matter of fact, to\ndigress a little, I understand there\u2019s a new documentary called \u201cThe Last Days,\u201d\nwhich I understand deals a lot with the aftermath, what happens right after. Because\nit wasn\u2019t that simple, it didn\u2019t just end and then everything was fine. There were\ndecisions to be made, where to go, what to do. I also remember that when you \u2014 that\n130March 1, 1999\nI felt that when you only survive \u2014 when your goal is to survive, you have more of a\ndirection than after the war, when you \u2014 when it\u2019s no longer just to survive, but\nwhere to go, how to survive, what to do with your life. When you\u2019re only trying to\nsave your life, your \u2014 your way of thinking is very, very different. So I almost\nremember a certain, like a lack of direction, like a certain, you know, let down\nalmost. It\u2019s like \u2014 it\u2019s like after a party. You look forward to it like I don\u2019t know\nwhat, and then afterwards you sort of, where do you go from here? That\u2019s the kind\nof thing I remember. And also the discussions; where to go, what to do. So finally\nthey decided to go to the south of Hungary. And for me, at that point also was a\nvery big disappointment, because my uncle, whom I worshipped, decided that he\nwas done with us. He \u2014 he knew his family had survived. They had gone from\nSiberia to Palestine. He had \u2014 he had a goal, he was going to Palestine to be\nreunited with his family. So he, at that point, decided to leave us. And he was going\nto go to Romania, and from Romania I think there were boats already going to\nPalestine somehow. And I wanted to go with him. I didn\u2019t \u2014 I really wanted to go\nwith him. I would have gone with him to the end of the world. And that I remember\nas being very traumatic, and he talked to me and told me that I couldn\u2019t go with him\nbecause I wasn\u2019t his child, and he had his own children and all of that was very hard\nfor me to take. And also, I felt that he had more direction, he knew what he was\n131March 1, 1999\ngoing to do, while my father did not. And so of course, he left and I felt very\nabandoned, very abandoned. And not only I, but our whole, family, because he was\nthe resourceful one. And while my father di \u2014 was a wonderful man, but it \u2014 for\npeace time. He was not very good during the war. I mean, for \u2014 for these very\ndifficult conditions. Not difficult, where you really couldn\u2019t just go a straight line,\nmy father was a straight, very straight person. So anyway, my father da \u2014 so we\nwent south, and I don\u2019t remember how we traveled. I think \u2014 I don\u2019t remember, you\nknow, all I remember is that in the south of Hungary, we stayed on a farm with\nsome people, and \u2014 Hungarians. And it was wonderful, because it was \u2014 it was\nspring by then. And we stayed there through the spring, and it \u2014 I think through the\nspring. Maybe for \u2014 for a month or six weeks. And there were animals. I remember I\nlearned how to cut the wool off \u2014 they had angora rabbits, and so they taught me\nhow to do that. That\u2019s sort of nice, and then how to weave. I could weave yarn. They\nhad a spindle, or whatever it\u2019s called, and I could weave angora into wool; I was\nvery good. Anything with my hands, I was very good at. And actually I had my first\nromance there, there was a boy of 17 or 16, he was much ol \u2014 and he was on the\nneighboring farm, and I learned how to ride a bike at that point, because he taught\nme how to ride a bike. And there was a little river where we used to go and walk\nalong and look at pebbles, and do things. So that was very nice there. During that\n132March 1, 1999\ntime my father went back to Poland, to Krakow, because he thought that he would\nbe able to go back there and resume life there. He did not want to go to Palestine, he\nwas never a Zionist, and he also knew that conditions in Palestine were very bad.\nAnd he was a banker, and I remember he even \u2014 I remember his words. He used to\nsay that the German bankers, there were many German bankers, much more\nprominent, who had gone there in the 30s and were still walking around with a cane.\nYou know, with a little walking stick, because they had nothing to do, and \u2014 and so\nhe felt that he couldn\u2019t \u2014 wouldn\u2019t want to go there, he couldn\u2019t make a living there.\nHe could also not even contribute anything to the country, because he didn\u2019t have a\n\u2014 that kind of a skill. So Palestine was out. He thought that he could go back to\nPoland. The reason he thought he could go back to Poland is because there was a\ngovernment in exile in \u2014 in London, headed by Mikolajczyk was his name, and my\nfather thought that it was going to be a democratic Poland, and he thought he could\nrepossess whatever he had, and start life again. He was robbed on the train going\nthere. He got to Krakow and he saw the Russians had occupied Poland, and\n[indecipherable] but of course, conditions were much better already. But he saw\nthat there was no one to talk to, that that \u2014 no one was \u2014 you know, he would have to\ndeal with the Russians. Anyhow, he came to the conclusion he couldn\u2019t do it. So he\ncame back to \u2014 to Mako and he decided that we should go to Vienna, which was\n133March 1, 1999\nactually, in the long run, a good decision, because he had a great deal of property in\nVienna. Vienna had just been liberated, and Vienna was in four occupational\nzones. And he would establish the fact that he survived, claim whatever he had\nclaims on, and he thought maybe there. So that I remember, we went back to\nBudapest and from Budapest we took a train. And by then there was a train going,\nbut there were like millions of people on the station, everybody had bundles and it\nwas cold and it \u2014 it was horrible. It was really quite difficult.",
        "Q: Speaking of Budapest, if we can just back up a little bit, when you were there,\nhad you ever heard of a man named Raoul Wallenberg? Were you in safe houses\nwhen you were there? What did you know about him?",
        "A: We \u2014I knew a lot about him, I had heard about him, because my uncle kept\ntalking about him, and he tried to get into those houses. My \u2014 my uncle tried\neverything, and he was aware, but we didn\u2019t qualify, so we couldn\u2019t get into one of\nthose ha \u2014 those houses, because we were \u2014 had Christian papers. We actually had\npapers, and they didn\u2019t \u2014 they were taking Hungarian Jews who had no other identit\n\u2014 so we did not \u2014 there was no way they were going to take us. And we were not\neven Hungarian. So, you know, if \u2014 if \u2014 1f \u2014 even if \u2014 1f Wallenberg himself would\nhave agreed to take us, the other Hungarians would have been very upset by us,\n134March 1, 1999\nbecause there were mi \u2014 lines and lines of people waiting for that, 1t was like a safe\nhaven. Yes, we knew about him, yes.",
        "Q: And now to go forward, did \u2014 did you re-recover your health qu \u2014 quite quickly,\nor your physical condition once you were with your parents?",
        "A: Yes, very, very quickly, because the \u2014 as I said, the conditions in the country\nwere good. We had food, we had a room, we had \u2014 you know, my parents had a\u2014a\n\u2014asi\u2014aroom. It was a farmhouse, and so yes, very quickly.",
        "Q: Did you talk to your mother or your father about what you had gone through\nwithout them when you were th-the \u2014 when you were not with them, you were with\nyour uncle. Did your mother ask you specifically \u2014",
        "A: No, no. No, we never talked about. I mean, maybe we talked about it, th \u2014 you\nknow, the siege, and in the cellar, yes, we talked about that. But I don\u2019t think that we\ndwelled on what we went through. I mean, that wasn\u2019t what \u2014 what this was all\nabout. It was getting \u2014 lo-looking forward, and I think we talked a lot. I remember,\nyou know, my \u2014 about I had to start going to school some point. I was very\nconcerned about that, you know. And \u2014 and where are we going next, and \u2014 and we\ntalked more about that than what we went through actually, because that was not\nvery relevant at the moment, it was over. I mean, you didn\u2019t want to, didn\u2019t get you\nanywhere. So I don\u2019t remember talking a lot about what we went through or not, no.\n135March 1, 1999",
        "Q: Did your uncle arrange for the farm in Mako?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so. I think my father did. I think we went down there, looked ar \u2014\nlooked \u2014 I don\u2019t remember the details. I don\u2019t even remember how we got there,\nwhether it was by train, or \u2014 must have been by train, because th-the \u2014 the \u2014\nprobably the \u2014 the trains were already running. Or by truck? I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t\nknow, but it must have been my \u2014 my father, because my uncle was gone by then.\nHe was gone, he \u2014 he left right away. So, then we aw \u2014 took this horrible train ride\nto Vienna, and we arrived in Vienna and we went to where my parents ho-home\nwas. My parents lived in a townhouse, on three floors, like the little townhouses in\nNew York. And again, there was a caretaker in the basement, and she was a woman\nwho, of course, remembered my parents, wasn\u2019t that long, and my father decided \u2014\nhe stayed for a while, went around to all kinds of lawyers and things, and again,\nconditions in Vienna were very, very bad. Now, I remember it being cold, and that\u2019s\nwhy I\u2019m confused. It must have been like March, maybe. Because I remember it\nbeing cold. So I think it was something like March, 1945. It was just be \u2014 just bef \u2014",
        "Q: I thought you \u2014 but in the spring you were on the farm, weren\u2019t you?",
        "A: Well, that\u2019s just it. We were liberated in January. We went down soon after, so I\nthink we might have been like, you know, end of January, four weeks in February\nand in March we got to \u2014 to Vienna. Because it was still cold, and they decided, or I\n136March 1, 1999\ndecide \u2014 everybody decided I was going to go to school, and my brother was going\nto go to school. Pro \u2014 but the main reason for going to school was food, because\nthere was the United Nations, UNRRA provided soup for children in school. So we\nhad one hot meal. One day it was bean soup, and one day it was pea soup, I\nremember it alternated. Now, the 1\u2014 I remember the school as being very interesting\nbecause I spoke German, but I didn\u2019t know very well how \u2014 I \u2014 I knew how to read\nand write. But \u2014",
        "Q: Read and write German?",
        "A: Read and write period. Some language. I knew how to read and write in \u2014 in\nPolish, which is what I learned. But if you know how to read and write in one\nlanguage, and it\u2019s Latin characters, you can figure it out. And I knew how to speak\nGerman. So I knew how to read and write in German, more or less.",
        "Q: Did you know Hungarian?",
        "A: I learned Hungarian, fry \u2014 ha \u2014 but only by ear, just for \u2014 and both my brother\nand I spoke excellent Hungarian, and we spoke to each other Hungarian, because\nthat was the goal of our being there, because the whole version of us being with\nthese people in \u2014 in \u2014 in Buda was that we were some relatives, and that they didn\u2019t\nwant us to be in the center of town, so this was a little outside, so it was less likely to\nbe bombed, and that was always \u2014 or visiting relatives, so the per \u2014 so we did have\n137March 1, 1999\nto speak Hungarian to each other, we didn\u2019t run around speaking Polish. So\n[indecipherable]",
        "Q: What did you speak to your parents in, Polish?",
        "A: Yes, always in Polish. So we got \u2014 when we got to Austria \u2014 to \u2014 to Vienna, the\nhouse, the building where we lived, or the hou \u2014 townhouse, was in the \u2014 in the\nBritish zone, which was one of the better zones to be in. And the city was divided, as\nI said, and I remember only that my father took me to the lawyer, and gave me a\npower of attorney, which was terribly imp \u2014 I was very impressed with that, because\nhe \u2014 he \u2014 they were going to go back to Poland, my parents, and they decided they\nwere going to leave us, because they still thought they could maybe make it there.\nAnd also, they also half-heartedly by then decided that they would emigrate. And\nthe only place where we could go would be \u2014 you\u2019re going to \u2014 [break]",
        "Q: Ready?",
        "A: My parents decided to go back to Poland because in order for us to emigrate, we\ndid need to emigrate from Poland. We were Polish citizens and that\u2019s what the law\nwas at the time. From Vienna we could not go anywhere. We also needed to see\nwhere we could go, where we could get visas, and start applying for them, and all of\nthis had to be done from Poland, because we were Polish citizens. And, so my\nparents decided that they would establish the fact that they survived, and claim\n138March 1, 1999\nproperty in Vienna that they had before the war. And in order to establish the fact\nthat they had survived, they were going to leave my brother and me in Vienna,\nbecause there were papers to be signed, and you know, it was proof that we \u2014 that\nwe were alive and had claims. Because of that, my father took me to the lawyer and\ngave me a power of attorney, and every once in a while the lawyer would come and\nget me to sign some papers. I also had my fathe \u2014",
        "Q: Even though you\u2019re minor?",
        "A: Even though I was a minor, because I guess I \u2014 I\u2014 it was some sort of paper\ndeclaring that that\u2019s \u2014 that I was empowered to do it because my parents couldn\u2019t be\nthere, or whatever. I was very impressed with that. I also had plenty of money, my\nfather left me money, because he left. And there was nothing to buy with the money,\nbecause there were horrendous shortages, but horrendous in Vienna. You actually y-\nyou know, tha \u2014 everything was on coupons and so on. We ate with this woman who\ntook care of the house, and \u2014",
        "Q: Was it hard for \u2014 for you to have your parents go away again?",
        "A: No. No. Well, yes and no. In some ways yes, on the other hand, I knew that there\nwas no imminent danger any more, nobody was going to take us anywhere. We\nlived in the British zone, which was fairly civilized. Altogether, Vienna was\ncivilized at that point. It was occupy \u2014 it was an occupied city, there was order.\n139March 1, 1999\nThere was a lot of military on the street, but there was order. No, I was not afraid, I\nwas, in a way lonely. It was miserable, because my brother, I don\u2019t know whether he\nwent to school or not, but very soon after that, he got very sick. He had a \u2014 an\nabscess on his neck, I remember like today, and he started running a fever, and it\nwas full of pus. And I didn\u2019t know what to do with that. So what I did was, I took\nhim \u2014 would be interesting to see what he remembers, I took him to the Polish\ncommittee, because they \u2014 the \u2014 I knew that Poland was repatriating, they wanted\nall Polish citizens to go back to Poland, that was after the war. There was a\nrepatriation effort. And I found a\u2014 somebody who was willing to take him by \u2014 who\nwas going by car to Krakow, it wasn\u2019t \u2014 you know, Vienna and Krakow is not that\nfar apart. And he took him. And so, because I w \u2014 I was afraid to stay with him any\nlonger, because he was so sick, I didn\u2019t know what to do with him. So I send him\nhome sick, and my parents got him. And then I stayed on probably another month or\nfive weeks. And \u2014",
        "Q: But was that hard to be by yourself?",
        "A: It was hard to be by myself, and it was hard altogether. I was \u2014 it was not an easy\ntime. But wa \u2014 one funny incident \u2014 not funny, but interesting incident I remember\nbefore my brother left, when he was still well. Since I had so much money, and there\nwas nothing to buy with it really, the theater was active in \u2014 in Vienna. So I decided\n140March 1, 1999\nthat we should go to the theater. I had never been to a theater, but \u2014 so I\u2014 we got\ntickets, or I got tickets, and I went. And they were doing \u201cMedea.\u201d Does he\nremember that? Yes. And I took \u2014 and we went to see \u201cMedea.\u201d And I \u2014 to this day,\nyou know, there I was, I had no clue what this was all about, except that there was\nthis mother who had ki \u2014 was kill \u2014 at the end kills those two children. And we had\njust survived, and I knew that my mother did everything to save us. I couldn\u2019t\nunderstand for the world of me, ho \u2014 why would a mother kill two children? And I\nremember I cried a lot during that play. That was very \u2014 it was probably very well\ndone; the theater in Vienna was very, very good. So that I remember vividly, that\nwas before he left. Then he left, and I was by myself, and I didn\u2019t like the woman\nwe stayed with, I didn\u2019t \u2014 it was not \u2014 it was not very pleasant, yes, it was lonely. By\nthat time it was lonely. Also, the school was very difficult because they didn\u2019t have\nany textbooks. That was very interesting. They were not allowed to use any of the\nNazi period textbooks because they all had some element of propaganda in them,\neven the math books, you know, had things like how \u2014 how many Jews if you \u2014\nEnd of Tape Four, Side B\n141March 1, 1999\nBeginning Tape Five, Side A",
        "Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\nvolunteer collection interview with Riane Gruss. This is tape number five, side A,\nand you were talking about the German textbooks.",
        "A: So, they were not allowed to use in the schools in Vienna after the war, any of\nthe German textbooks, which meant that everything was dictated to us. And it was\nso cold in the ca \u2014 in the classrooms, that we had to have gloves on to \u2014 to \u2014 to write,\nand it was very difficult, I remember that was very difficult, and it was difficult for\nme to write dictation, because also my German wasn\u2019t that good. But I did\nsomehow, but the main reason why we weren\u2019t \u2014 why I was, I don\u2019t remember if my\nbro \u2014 I think my brother also must have gone, was that we got food, that we got the\nsoup, that was the main reason to be there, because I don\u2019t remember learning a\nwhole lot there. And then afterwards, one day a man came to us, and told me \u2014\nintroduced himself and told me that my parents said that he should bring me back to\nKrakow. And he didn\u2019t have a piece of paper, anything written, and I was a little bit\nleery of going with him, because my parents said that I had to wait until I heard from\nthem, you know, that I had \u2014 that was my \u2014 my assignment. And I \u2014 and \u2014 but he\nconvinced me. And I must have been very lonely, because I was happy to go. And I\nwent, and I \u2014 the \u2014 he \u2014 and I later found out that he was doing what most people\n142March 1, 1999\nwere doing then, smuggling. And my parents \u2014 he knew my parents and they asked\nhim if he would bring me back, because by then my parents had the Brazilian visas.\nWe knew we were going to Brazil. At least they knew, I didn\u2019t. And they needed\nme to come back to Poland. And they asked him, because they knew he was doing\nthat, he was going back and forth, had he had a car. But he told them that he\nwouldn\u2019t have room for me, and s \u2014 that he wouldn\u2019t be able to do it. And that\u2019s why\nthey never gave him a piece of paper to \u2014 to te \u2014 a letter for me, that I was supposed\nto come. So \u2014 but then he found that he had room. [break \u2014 doorbell] So he\ndiscovered that he would have room for me, and not only would he have room for\nme, but apparently it was to his advantage, because if he traveled with a girl, or a\nchild or whatever, he was less suspicious than he would have been. And that\u2019s why\nhe decided he was going to take me after all. So he came, he contacted me, and I\nwent. And we stop \u2014 we drove to Brno, we stopped in bro \u2014 Brno, which is\nCzechoslovakia at that time. And he \u2014 we stayed in a hotel, he took a room for me,\nand treated me very well, I liked that he was a very nice man. And he told me to\ncome downstairs and we were going to have dinner. And there was this restaurant, it\nwas like a pensionne. And I had a goose, he ordered a goose, and I\u2019Il never forget\nthat goose as long as I live, was the best dinner I ever had, was wonderful. And then\nwe slept, and the next morning we went on to Krakow. My parents, I remember,\n143March 1, 1999\nwere very excited to see me, very happy, because they didn\u2019t expect that I was\ncoming at all, so that was a very happy reunion.",
        "Q: Did you bring everything that you owned with you?",
        "A: I didn\u2019t own very much, yes, I [indecipherable]",
        "Q: What did you own?",
        "A: A bundle, I don\u2019t know. A few \u2014 I suppose sweaters, I don\u2019t know. I have no\nidea, I don\u2019t remember. It was not a big \u2014 I didn\u2019t spend lots of time packing, like I\ndo now. No, I don\u2019t remember that. Little something. And they lived in a house in\nthe office of a distant relative. We couldn\u2019t get back into our apartment, which was a\ngovernment office, actually, it was a biological institute, I found out. And my\nmother had reopened and was running the gallery, the antique gallery that my uncle\nand my grandfather owned. And it was a fairly sort of normal existence, except that\nwe, of course, we \u2014 again we didn\u2019t go to school, and we were used mainly to walk\nfrom our \u2014 where we lived to \u2014 to the store, sit in the store. One day a week the\nbeggars came to \u2014 to \u2014 because then all the businesses sort of have this as a custom\nin Poland, still is, where, so that you don\u2019t have to deal with beggars e-every single\nday, you used to tell them to come on Fridays. So my job was to sit next to the door,\nthe entrance to this gallery and tell the beggars to come back on Friday. I remember\nthat like today. And I wasn\u2019t very well for some reason, I don\u2019t know why. Maybe I\n144March 1, 1999\nwas run down when I came, because I remember that mi \u2014 I went to a doctor and I\nhad like a general check-up. And he told my mother that I was fine, and as soon as I\njust lived, you know, had more food and so on, I would be fine, and I was fine.\nBasically I was very healthy.",
        "Q: What month \u2014 what month was this that you got back to Poland?",
        "A: This was \u2014 we left in July, so this must \u2014 must have been like June. I wasn\u2019t there\nvery long, May or June, end of May or June, it was warm already. And I just sat in\nthe store, watched my mother talk to people and ran errands and that\u2019s about it. We\nwere, at that time, reunited with my grandfather, who had survived in Siberia, and\nhe came ba \u2014 and my aunt, my mother\u2019s older sister, and we all lived together at the\nsame time, in the same place.",
        "Q: What was your reaction in seeing them again?",
        "A: \u2019'm not a very warm person. I keep thinking even now, you know, and \u2014 it was\nfine, you know, and my grandfather was a nice man, he was quiet. What I do\nremember 1s that I, for the first time, I found about Jewish things, because my\ngrandfather ate kosher, and so did my aunt. And I remember that when I get \u2014 got\nback from Vienna, my mother showed me, there was this one shelf of a few cups\nand things, and she told me not to touch those, because those were my grandfather\u2019s\ndishes and I wasn\u2019t supposed to touch them. But I still didn\u2019t have a clear picture as\n145March 1, 1999\nto exactly why, but I remember that he was a very nice man, and my aunt was very\nnice, and again, my concerns were different. They were there, 1t was crowded. My\nparents slept \u2014 this was a \u2014 the office of a cousin of my father\u2019s, and he \u2014 this cousin\nhad imports of watches, he was an importer of watches from Switzerland, and \u2014\nbefore the war. And so I remember my parents had a war \u2014 it was like a wardrobe, a\n\u2014 or a gr \u2014 big cabinet, not a wardrobe, a big cabinet that was put down on the floor,\nand they slept on that. So you know, it was crowded in there, and then my\ngrandfather was there and my brother, and we slept \u2014 I think we slept on chairs that\nwere put together. It was not very comfortable, there was \u2014 so I don\u2019t \u2014 you know, it\nwasn\u2019t like you were happy to see your grandfather. In a way it was almost \u2014 he had\n\u2014 he occupied the only bed that was there, so it wasn\u2019t so wonderful. And then, a\nlittle while later, we were ready to leave, and we left. We left by train from Krakow\nto Warsaw. And from Warsaw, we took \u2014 how did we get to Stockholm? I think \u2014",
        "Q: What did Warsaw look like when you got there?",
        "A: That was in bad shape, yeah, that was ruined. But I wasn\u2019t very impressed,\nbecause again, by then it was a little cleaned up already, and it \u2014 while it was very\ndestroyed, I was not exactly at an age where I could appreciate it, that these\nwonderful buildings were destroyed. And it was nothing compared with what\nBudapest looked like. I mean, I knew what the city that\u2019s destroyed is a few hours\n146March 1, 1999\nafter, that\u2019s very different. So I wasn\u2019t \u2014 that didn\u2019t make any impression on me. As\nfar as Jewish memorials, we never went to any of them. My parents \u2014 you know, as\nfar as the ghetto, or the site of the ghetto and so on. No, I think this is an\n[indecipherable] that 1s now very \u2014 you know, people do it and I\u2019m going to say\nsomething that\u2019s going to shock everybody, but I think that \u2014 I myself feel that\nthere\u2019s \u2014 when we really needed help and support right after the war, and when I\ncame to Brazil and \u2014 and, you know, I had a need to talk about what happened to us,\nin order to inform people I had close contact with, schoolmates and so on, nobody\nwas interested. Nobody was interested. And now, I almost think it\u2019s too much, and I\nmyself am almost overdosed on the Holocaust, particularly on the superficial de \u2014\ncharacteristics of it. I still very much like to read books on the ho \u2014 that have\nsomething to do with the Holocaust. Not memor \u2014 not memoirs, you know, what\nhappened to another person who had a similar story like mine, I think on that level\nit\u2019s not interesting. But novels or fiction or anything that deals with the Holocaust, I\nwill read, and I find some of them very interesting. But this sort of obsession with it\nnow is, I think way overboard, you know, way, way too much. And not all of it\u2019s\nsincere anyway. So anyhow, we did \u2014 I don\u2019t remember doing anything Jewish.\nAfter the war, my mother was very gratified, because my parents did ask us after the\nwar whether we wanted to stay Jewish. And both my brother and I apparently said\n147March 1, 1999\nyes. I don\u2019t remember it v \u2014 I do remember talking about it, but it wasn\u2019t a long\ndiscussion, it was more \u2014 don\u2019t forget, we had these Christian papers. We had an\noption to stay who we were during the war. You \u2014 you did have some \u2014 you had a\npossibility, and some people did. They just didn\u2019t want to have anything to do with\nit any more. They didn\u2019t want their children to have to go through this, what we\nwent through, and so there were all kinds of different solutions, let\u2019s say, or \u2014 or \u2014 or\nroads to recovery that people opted for. Options. So I \u2014 they asked us, and we\ndecided that we wanted to \u2014 at least we said that we wanted to stay Jewish, and the\nreason was not \u2014 I was too young, I mean I didn\u2019t know anything, I never studied\nanything, neither did my brother, that I-I just felt that \u2014 that we were born, that is\nlike, do I want to be a blonde? No, because I was never a blonde, and there was no\nreason to now become a blonde. So now that it\u2019s over, yes, so we said yes. But it\nwasn\u2019t such a big deal as it 1s today in general again, you know being Jewish was\nnot what I always tell my husband, a full-time occupation. It was just something you\nwere, that\u2019s all. So, after the war, we had back our names and our \u2014 you know,\nlegitimate birth certificates and the whole thing. And we went via \u2014 we went to\nSweden. In Sweden \u2014 we went by train, I think \u2014 in Sweden we had to wait a long\ntime, we were in Stockholm for about three months. We didn\u2019t get to Brazil til\nOctober, so we must have been there \u2014 not three months, maybe a little shorter,\n148March 1, 1999\nbecause the trip took about four or five weeks on the \u2014 on a freighter. At that time\nthe big issue was not only getting a visa, but getting transportation out of Europe\nbecause everybody was go \u2014 leaving.",
        "Q: Before we talk about your going to Brazil, let\u2019s just talk a little bit more about\nyour leaving to go to Sweden. What were your thoughts about having now to go to\nanother country?",
        "A: Actually, that was a very positive experience. And actually, I should backtrack a\nlittle bit. I think from Krak\u00e9w to Warsaw, on the way to Brazil, I later remembered\nwe did fly. And I remember it was an airplane that did \u2014 had seats all around, it\ndidn\u2019t have seats in rows. And it was a short flight, it\u2019s not very far.",
        "Q: Th-This is a flight to Sweden you\u2019re talking about?",
        "A: No, it was the flight from Krak\u00e9w to Warsaw on the way to Sweden, and then\nin \u2014 from Warsaw to Stockholm, I really don\u2019t know how we went. As I said, I\nthink it was by train, but I couldn\u2019t swear. I don\u2019t remember how \u2014 how we got\nthere, all I remember is that we did get there.",
        "Q: So you don\u2019t remember the voyage over the water to Sweden?",
        "A: No, we definitely did not go by ship. We went by ship from Sweden, from\nGoteborg to Brazil, yeah, that was by sh \u2014 by ship. Going to Sweden was a\nwonderful feeling, because going \u2014 Sweden we knew was a neutral country during\n149March 1, 1999\nthe war. It was kind of heaven, you know, going to a neutral country, a country that\nwas never destroyed, never had any part in any war. It was wonderful, and we knew\nit was a good country and a prosperous country and that we would be comfortable\nand \u2014 and we were. And \u2014",
        "Q: Were you unhappy about leaving Poland\u201d?",
        "A: No, I was not unhappy about leaving Poland because I really had no roots in\nPoland. I never went to school in Poland. I was actually, between Vienna and our\nleaving, was only about two months. So I was only there for about two months, and\nalso ba \u2014 by \u2014 by the time I returned from Vienna, when this man took me home to\nmy parents, I was told that the reason they brought me over is because they already\nhad the visas and it was just a matter of getting everything else settled and we were\nleaving. So it wasn\u2019t like you know, I was settling down anywhere. So I was very ha\n\u2014 then there was a good feeling. Leaving for Sweden was a good feeling was \u2014\nbecause it was the beginning of something new and something that we knew had to\nhappen, is us settling somewhere. Now Brazil was the goal and Sweden was\ncertainly a good and easy country to \u2014 to wait in. And that\u2019s what happened. We\nwaited in Sweden in \u2014 in Stockholm we stayed in \u2014 in zak \u2014 some sort of a\npensionne, boarding house, very comfortable. And the only thing we thought was\nterrible was the Swedish food, which 1s very, very different from any food we had \u2014\n150March 1, 1999\nwe ever had before. There\u2019s a lot of, as you know, cold fish and herrings and so on.\nAnd in addition to that, they have \u2014 their desserts are not sweet, so we were shocked\nthat things that looked like a cake, turned out to be salty. So th \u2014 it was always a bit\nof a surprise. The other thing that struck us, and we must have arrived in Sweden in\nAugust, because they have very little sunshine there, and the minute the sun would\ncome out in front of the opera, we \u2014 we lived not far from the opera, there were\nsteps, and there were these people sitting down and with their faces leaning up and\nlooking at the sun, and you know, every few moments of sunshine was a big thing.\nSo we found that peculiar.",
        "Q: How did you adjust to a new language?",
        "A: We didn\u2019t understand, of course, Swedish. A little bit it\u2019s like German, so there\nwere some words that we could make out. And again, it was not a big \u2014 it was not a\nbig problem. We st-stayed in this boarding house, our needs were taken care of.\nWhat was a big problem was that my father went \u2014 while we were waiting to go to \u2014\nto get the ship to go to Brazil, he decided to go to Switzerland and look around,\nbecause he was beginning to think what he was going to do in Sweden \u2014 in Brazil,\nand the reason we were going to Brazil was that his former partner from\nSwitzerland, from his branch in Switzerland was in Brazil since 1940, and was\ndoing very, very well. And the idea came up, I don\u2019t know if my father initiated it,\n151March 1, 1999\nor this \u2014 his name was Landau(ph), Mr. Roman Landau(ph) \u2014 or whether Mr.\nLandau(ph) initiated it, but I\u2014 my father had very good connections in Switzerland\nin the \u2014 in the watch industry, because he financed \u2014 first of all, he was there during\nWorld War I, and \u2014 and so he somehow knew many of the people. But in addition to\nthat, he financed the \u2014 his cousins representation of Omega and Tissot, which were\ntwo very well-known makes of Swiss watches. And my \u2014 my father\u2019s cousin had the\nrepresentation of these two brands for Poland. Omega particularly was very\nsuccessful before the war, and my father was \u2014 had a partner [indecipherable]\nfinance his cousin, or whatever. So anyhow, he had connections, and his idea was to\ngo to Brazil, and with the capital from Mr. Landau(ph), with his help, which was\nmore like he owed my father wha \u2014 he \u2014 they \u2014 my father would open a\nrepresentation and import of Swiss watches. And that actually was his business, and\nhe went to \u2014 to Switzerland in order to talk \u2014 to see \u2014 t-to develop some\nrelationships with manufacturers. And so he went for about two or three weeks. And\nin Sweden there wasn\u2019t much going on, because we were just waiting for passage\nand \u2014 and he knew that we weren\u2019t getting it so soon, there were, as I said before,\nthousands of people waiting for passage out of the \u2014",
        "Q: Did you \u2014 did you socialize with any of the children who were waiting to leave?\n152March 1, 1999",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t remember. No. We stayed in this boarding house, and I don\u2019t\nremember any children, no. All I remember 1s my mother \u2014 my mother wasn\u2019t well \u2014\nby the way, she miscarried at that time. She became pregnant after the war, which to\nher was \u2014 she was terribly upset about, but she only told it to me la \u2014 many years\nlater. But I did know that she was very, very sick and she was bleeding. And she\nlater told us this very moving story that after my father left, she realized she was\npregnant, and she certainly couldn\u2019t now arrive in Brazil with a new baby, and we\nwere grown, and it was \u2014 she was terribly upset and tried to get an abortion. There\nwas no abortion in \u2014 in Sweden, which | \u2014 it was a surprise to me, a progressive\ncountry like that, you couldn\u2019t get an abortion. I remember her going to the doctor\nand I went with her to the do \u2014 what did I do? I just sort of stayed with her and with\nmy brother, I mean, that\u2019s all we did. And \u2014 but I had no clue as to why. And then\nshe induced the miscarriage. So I remember there was a lot of blood and she told me\nthat was a very heavy menstruation. I was the one that was cleaning it up. So that\nwas not a happy thing, but I didn\u2019t know that it was that until many years later. And\nthen she recovered and we waited, and my father came back, eventually, we went to\nGoteborg. And that I remember, that trip from Stockholm to Goteborg, I\nremember very well, because it was a beautiful train ride, just beautiful. And we\nwent to \u2014 and in Goteborg we still waited for a while. And I think that \u2014 I don\u2019t\n153March 1, 1999\nknow where it was, either in Stockholm or in Goteborg, I think my brother got a\nbicycle, or there was some talk about bicycle. I vaguely remember something about\nthat, but very little. And then in the \u2014 then the passa \u2014 the \u2014 the tickets came through,\nor th-the space became available, and we went to Brazil, and arrived in Brazil in\noke \u2014 October, 1946, end of October we arrived actually the day of my father\u2019s\nbirth. So I remember that date very well, because it \u2014 my mother always talked\nabout how we arrived on his birthday.",
        "Q: So you were now a little over 14 years old.",
        "A: Right. I turned 14 in Sweden, because we \u2014 in August we were in Sweden, that\u2019s\nwhen I turned 14. Mm-hm, so when I arrived in Brazil, there I had fi \u2014 my fa \u2014",
        "Q: O-On the boat going over, were there other people who were leaving Europe?",
        "A: Yes, a very small \u2014 it was a freighter, and there were 11 of us. There was some\nother family, whom I remember very vaguely, and some \u2014 but there were no\nchildren, or no youngsters, we were the only ones. And on that \u2014 on that boat, I\nlearned how to play Bridge, because the captain and purser, they had, I don\u2019t know,\ntwo or three officers and they needed a fourth hand. And I was the one that they\ndecided to teach, I was the most teachable, so I \u2014 I played Bridge; that\u2019s most of\nwhat I remember on that boat, that I played Bridge, and that some days it was very\n154March 1, 1999\nrough, and everybody was seasick. And I felt also queasy, but I was the only one\nwho didn\u2019t really, you know, throw up, so I was very proud of myself. But \u2014",
        "Q: Were you looking forward to going to Brazil? What did Brazil mean to you at\nthat \u2014 at the age of 14?",
        "A: I didn\u2019t know anything about it, nothing. I knew it was a hot climate. I knew that\nRio, its capital, and that\u2019s where we were going, was supposed to be a beautiful city.\nAnd also I knew that we knew a number of people there; that I knew. And also my\nfather, not only that \u2014 that his former partner was there, but also my father was\nmarried before, so my mother was his second wife, and he had two daughters by his\nfirst wife, and the older one, with her husband and son, were in Brazil; that was\nanother reason why we went there. And my nephew, her son, was only two and a\nhalf years younger than I am, and a year younger than my brother. So I knew that \u2014\nthat there was some sort of family. My father never had a very good relationship\nwith her before or after the war, but that\u2019s a different story. But anyhow, I knew they\nwere there. And what did it mean? It meant a certain, imagine, permanence, but not\na happy one. Not \u2014 not for me. I had \u2014 I had \u2014 I was open to it, but my mother was\nvery unhappy, she didn\u2019t want to go to Brazil, so there was a lot of problems for \u2014\nabout that, because my mother really wanted to go to Palestine. And she made it\nvery clear when my uncle left, she wanted to do it. My father didn\u2019t want to take the\n155March 1, 1999\nchance, and of course, she couldn\u2019t do it. But she felt that Brazil was really a very,\nvery, very, you know, contrary, different country, and she felt very strongly that she\nhad nothing in common with that culture, and talked a lot about it. I remember that I,\nfor myself, felt that she was exaggerating, that she was making it \u2014 being negative,\nand I didn\u2019t want to be negative at that point. My father also \u2014 my father was a very\npositive, but my father was the kind of man who, how shall I say? If he decided to\ndo something, he would \u2014 he \u2014 he didn\u2019t have second thoughts, he would make an\neffort to make it work. And she was a much more kind of intuitive and emotional\nperson. Anyhow, she felt that after surviving the war, there was really nothing for in\nBrazil. It was a strange country, a tropical country, she kept saying it was a tropical\ncountry, a strange country, and it really made no sense to go there, and she was very\nunhappy about it. And when they argued about it, th-the interesting thing was that\nshe used to say that my brother, who was much more \u2014 you know, was younger and\nmuch more sort of very different, less settled than I was at that \u2014 you \u2014 she used to\nwarn my father and say, you na \u2014 he\u2019s going to get used to this country, and you see,\nhe\u2019ll end up marrying out of faith. And that did happen eventually. So \u2014",
        "Q: When you had quiet moments with your mother, let\u2019s say on the voyage, or other\ntimes, did you and she talk about the difficult times in Siberia, or the train ride to\nSiberia? Did she ever \u2014 did you ever talk that over with her, that \u2014\n156March 1, 1999",
        "A: She used to talk a lot about it, because to her, what we went through, the war,\nwas very much alive, and to me also. And she used to talk a lot about it, more in\nrelation to what was expecting us. Her attitude was, we went through so much, and\nis this what we went it through for? And so she would bring things up, and \u2014 over\nand over. I can\u2019t say that I was sitting there patiently talking about it, because my\nattitude was more like my father\u2019s. We\u2019re coming here, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014I didn\u2019t\nwant it to be that negative because I didn\u2019t \u2014 I didn\u2019t worry about my fa \u2014 my\nbrother marrying out of faith, I mean I\u2014 you know, I had other problem, I had other\n\u2014 I thought she was exaggerating, I thought, you know, let\u2019s give this country first a\n\u2014a chance, and then see maybe it will be a nice country. Who knows? Why say in\nadvance that it won\u2019t be? And so yes, she talked a lot about what \u2014 what we \u2014 we\nhad gone through, and so on, yes. But how much I did of that, I probably listened.\nAnd some of the stories \u2014 she, by the way, was a great, as I mentioned probably\nearlier, she was a great storyteller and she was amusing and \u2014 and so on. And she\nwas interesting, so I probably, you know, if she had some reminiscences of\nsomething that I didn\u2019t remember so well, or that was amusing to her, and at the\ntime I was too young to understand, yes, I \u2014 she did talk about it, and I did listen to\nthat, yes.",
        "Q: So now you\u2019 ve arrived in Brazil?\n157March 1, 1999",
        "A: So now we arrived in Brazil, and I \u2014 from that I have very vivid memories. It\nwas hot. It was end of October, which is the beginning of the brazi \u2014 of the Brazilian\nsummer, and it was very hot. And at that time there was no air conditioning. The\nonly place that was air conditioned were cinemas. So my mother used to say, we go\nto the ci \u2014 to the movies for the climate. And that\u2019s the \u2014 that\u2019s the only place that\nwas air conditioned. They arranged for us to \u2014 of course my sister met us at the pier,\nand my father\u2019s former partner, so there were people meeting us at the \u2014 when we\narrived. And we \u2014 they rented for us two rooms, and a bathroom, and a little kind of\n\u2014I don\u2019t know if it was a kitchen or whatever, in a residential hotel. And all I\nremember from that, that it was beastly hot, and it was full of cockroaches. Because\ncockroaches in Brazil at that time were numerous. And so my mother used to say,\nwhen you want to go into the bathroom, you have to knock first, not to see if\nsomebody\u2019s there, but to frighten them away. And that\u2019s exactly what I\n[indecipherable]. And that was horrible, that was just awful. It was a horrible place,\nth \u2014 and it wasn\u2019t \u2014 it was 1n the best part of town, it wasn\u2019t like it was the slums or\nanything. But that \u2014 those were the conditions in Brazil. It was not a super luxury\nhotel, it was a\u2014 some sort of middle class kind of residential hotel. I have a very\nvivid memory of the second evening we were there, we were invited to dinner, to\nmy father\u2019s former partner\u2019s house. And they lived in a really, really wonderful,\n158March 1, 1999\nluxurious, enormous kind of apartment that exists to this day only in Brazil, it\ndoesn\u2019t \u2014 y-you \u2014 nobody in America lives as well as that. And they were very, very\nwell-to-do, they \u2014 he made a lot of money during the war on things like quartz and\nall kinds of raw materials.\nEnd of Tape Five, Side A\nBeginning Tape Five, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\nvolunteer collection interview with Riane Gruss. This is tape number five, side B.",
        "A: And so we were invited there for dinner, and we went. And of course, during the\n\u2014 first of all, the dinner was so unbelievably elaborate and beautiful, and butlers in\nwhite gloves serving and candle lights on the thing. I\u2019d never seen anything \u2014 on the\ntable, candle lights, silver, porcelain. I mean, it was really, even by my today\nstandards, it \u2014 1t would still be very impressive because people don\u2019t live that way in\n\u2014 in America with, you know, we had practically two servants per person at this\ndinner. So anyway, during that dinner, of course, the conversation was about what\nwe went through, you know, what happened wi \u2014 to us during the war and so on.\nAnd at the end tu \u2014 my parents sort of told the story. I, of course, at age 14 was very,\nvery quiet and I didn\u2019t say anything, my brother didn\u2019t say anything because we just\nsat there and \u2014 and were stunned by the whole thing. And when she finished telling\n159March 1, 1999\nwhat happened to us, our hostess said \u2014 she said, oh my God, she said, this is nothi \u2014\nwhat you went through is nothing compared what we suffered not knowing where\nyou were and what was happening. And I said to my mother \u2014 this I remember \u2014\nwhen we left that evening, I said to my mother, I\u2019m never going to talk about what\nhappened to us to anybody. They don\u2019t understand. They don\u2019t \u2014 it\u2019s no use, beca \u2014\nand I really did do that, I did not talk to people what happened. And later on, when I\nwent to school, and I should then tell you how and where and so on, I also found that\nas a result of what happened to us, or to me, I had very little rapport with youngsters\nmy age, very, very little. Because I always felt that whatever interested them was so\n\u2014 today I would use the word superficial, it wasn\u2019t superficial, it was \u2014 they were\nreal teenagers, and they were interested in clothes and lipstick. Again, in Brazil this\nwas very \u2014 still is a primary concern of a teenage girl. And \u2014 and I became later on,\na little interested in that, but it wasn\u2019t like \u2014 you know, I had so many other things\nthat happened to me. But they wouldn\u2019t understand, so I didn\u2019t have \u2014 I didn\u2019t have\na lot in common with them. That was a big problem for me.",
        "Q: Was there any other girl your age that you could confide in?",
        "A: Did I have a best friend? I had a couple of friends, but I wouldn\u2019t say that any of\nthem, as I said, I mean th-they were all \u2014 had been there during the war, in Brazil.\nThey were \u2014 the people I became friendly with eventually, were actually children of\n160March 1, 1999\npeople from Europe, not necessarily survivors, because I didn\u2019t know that many,\nbut people who went to Brazil in 1940 or 1939, who got out, were able to leave\nEurope before the war, and came there and lived extremely well. I mean, wa \u2014 I\ncan\u2019t tell you how well people in Brazil to this day live, com \u2014 you know, th-they\u2019re\nwealthy people, live extremely well. So, I have a couple of very close friends, pa \u2014\nthe daughter of one of my parent\u2019s good friend is a very good friend of mine to this\nday. I did, but on the whole, classmates and parties and all of that, was something\nthat was very difficult for me. I mean, I wasn\u2019t interested, I \u2014 I felt I was like \u2014 like\nan adult at a children\u2019s party, that\u2019s how I felt.",
        "Q: How did the teachers at school treat you?",
        "A: I should really backtrack and tell you about my school experience, because I\narrived in Brazil at the age of 14, and basically had no school, because I was in\nschool about 10 months in Siberia, in first grade. I was in school after that again,\nafter the war, in Vienna for about six weeks or two months. I was taught by this\nlady, this Polish lady in Hungary, and by my mother, so I la \u2014 that\u2019s how, at some\npoint I learned how to read and write. Probably in first grade, but that was in\nRussian. And just before they deported us, I was in school for about two months or\nso, because I remember making lines and lines and lines of As and Bs, that\u2019s how\nthey taught at that time. So that was in Polish. So basically I had never really been in\n161March 1, 1999\nschool properly. So here I was, and I was 14 years old, and I needed to go to school.\nSo my parents found out, and I found out that the Brazilian system is exactly like the\nFrench system. Which means that you have to \u2014 they cannot put you any higher than\nsixth grade, because you don\u2019t earn credits, you have to work towards the baccal \u2014\nbaccalaureate, or wa \u2014 how you spell it, how you pronounce it, and they wouldn\u2019t\ntake me above the sixth grade. They were willing to take me into the sixth grade,\nand then I would learn Portuguese, and so on. So anyway, I had to learn Portuguese.\nThis, to me, was like part of the war. It was a terrible disappointment, because here I\nwas, I was 14 years old. To go into the sixth grade was so humiliating. And I was\nalso very tall, I was as tall as I am today, or if not taller, cause I\u2019ve begun to shrink.\nBut \u2014 so this was a terrible, terrible blow to me, and there was nothing you could do\nabout it. So someone told me, and that was my lifesaver, that there\u2019s an American\nschool. And the American school does let you earn credits, and 1t only counts from\nthe ninth grade. I was the right age for the ninth grade, so if they would let me start\nin the ninth grade, then I had a chance to \u2014 to be with people my own age, and\ngraduate on time. Problem was that I didn\u2019t know any English at all, just like I didn\u2019t\nknow any Portuguese. So, I \u2014 of course, my parents were convinced that it was six\nof one, half a dozen of the other, I did have to learn a new language, and that wasn\u2019t\nthe problem. And I must say that I went with \u2014 I had to go with somebody who\n162March 1, 1999\nwould interpret for me. So I went with my half-sister, she spoke excellent English,\nshe \u2014 she was at the interpreters\u2019 school in \u2014 in Switzerland before the war, her\nEnglish was excellent. And she went with me. And we spoke \u2014 we got an\nappointment, we went there and they told me that if I learned English between\nOctober, end of a \u2014 now it\u2019s November already, middle of November, and March,\nbecause the school year in Brazil begins in \u2014 on the first of March. The long\nvacation because of the summer season 1s in the \u2014 is 1n the winter. So, they would\ngive me some sort of an exam, that would have a little bit of social studies, they\ngave me some \u2014 they gave me a textbook. General science, a little mathematics. So\nbasically sort of a\u2014 some kind of foundation. And some English and if I could pass\nthat exam at the end of the summer, over there, by March first, they would let me cu\n\u2014 go into ninth grade. Now, when I took th \u2014 I studied like crazy from that day on\nuntil March first. And then my mother used to say that was \u2014 we had an armchair \u2014\noh, eventually we moved, we got an apartment. We had armchair that she used to\nsay she could have sent easily to take that exam, because an armchair was so\nsaturated with my sitting in there and studying. I studied from morni \u2014 morning to\nnight, I had a dictionary. I had no lessons, nobody helped me, really. My sister\noccasionally helped me a little, but I really did it by myself with a dictionary, and\nmy father knew a little English and somehow \u2014 and the American school was\n163March 1, 1999\nunbelievable, they were so supportive, they really were. And when I was taking that\nexam, they gave me a dictionary, they let me use a dictionary. And in \u2014 and the only\nfunny experience I had with that was that my mathematics was quite good, I was\nalways good in math. And \u2014 but one of the examples on that exam had to do with\ndimes, nickels and quarters. And of course, there I had no idea what that was, and I\nhad to leave that question out, but it was the only one I left out, so I did very well.\nAnd I started ninth grade at th \u2014 and I was thrilled, and I worked very hard, and I did\nvery well. And I graduated from \u2014 from the American school when I was 18, four\nyears later. And that\u2019s what brought me to the United States, because the American\nschool did not have rights in Brazil, so I could not have gone on to \u2014 to a university\nor anything. So that fa \u2014 and I did want to leave, but it was because of that I really\nhad to leave, unless I \u2014 I could have gone to a secretarial school and become a\nsecretary, and there was some talk of doing that, but I didn\u2019t want to do that.",
        "Q: Did the teachers at the American school ask you about your background, or be\nsympathetic, or be good listeners?",
        "A: I think they knew about our \u2014 my background, and I wasn\u2019t the only one, by the\nway, there were three other survivors\u2019 children in my class. So I was not the only\none any more. And we all did very well, by the way, all of us, because \u2014 because we\nworked so hard. We were so serious, we \u2014 you know, scholastically, we did very\n164March 1, 1999\nwell. The teachers did not \u2014 teachers at that time, I don\u2019t know how it was in the\nUnited States, but teachers were not really interested terribly much in what you\nthought or didn\u2019t think, or what you did do \u2014 went through or didn\u2019t go through.\nThey were supportive, they helped you if you needed help, they were nice. No, I\ndon\u2019t remember having any kind of contact about that.",
        "Q: You said there were three other children.",
        "A: Yeah, they were not chil \u2014 you know, teen \u2014",
        "Q: Teenagers. Did you four get together and talk?",
        "A: Yeah, yes, they were \u2014 they \u2014 we definitely were a lot together, because we had a\nlot in common. One of them was a boy, and he was two years older than I was, and\nhe was in the same b \u2014 he was unlucky enough to be to \u2014 so he graduated two years\nlater, cause that was the only way you could do it. So he was there and then one of\nthem was a distant, very distant cousin of my mother\u2019s, and her daughter was there\nand she was also two years older than I was.",
        "Q: Did you exchange stories?",
        "A: Did we exchange stories? I knew her story, yes, and she knew my story; with\nhim, no. No, I don\u2019t know what \u2014 I wasn\u2019t that terribly friendly with him. I don\u2019t\nknow what he went through. I knew thought, that he did \u2014 I think he lost his family,\nbecause he was living with an uncle. So I do \u2014 but I didn\u2019t \u2014 we didn\u2019t go around\n165March 1, 1999\nasking people, you know, what did you or did you not \u2014 everybody\u2019s story was, in\nsome ways, similar. I mean, you knew that if he survived \u2014 he also was on Christian\npapers, I knew that. So, I don\u2019t know whether I knew it because my mother knew \u2014\nmy parents knew these families, or knew about them. So whether that\u2019s how I heard\nthat they survived \u2014 I heard more how people survived from my parents than I did\ndirectly. By then, people like \u2014 like him and my \u2014 the other young \u2014 the other girl,\nwere more interested in the day to day, you know, getting \u2014 doing what we had to\ndo. There \u2014 there wasn\u2019t much time to sit around and talk about what happened. So \u2014",
        "Q: Did you keep any kind of a journal, or did you do any kind of writing of your\nmemories of what you had been through during the war, at that time?",
        "A: No, I never really wrote diaries, and no, the answer is no. I have, to this day,\nsomething very funny. It\u2019s a \u2014 it\u2019s an embroidery, and it\u2019s a rectangular, like a\u2014a\u2014\nit\u2019s like a doily, but it\u2019s embroidered 1n a \u2014 1n a stitch, it\u2019s not crocheted. And I got\nthat at some point, I think in Hungary, because very often my mother would buy \u2014 I\nloved to sew and I was very good at it, I was always very good at knitting and\nembroidering and all of that, and that kept me busy. So, I \u2014 so this thing, I finished\nafter the war, and I brought it with me to Brazil. So in the middle \u2014 in the center of\nit, I wrote it was embroidered during the war years of 1940 to \u201945. I have it to this\nday. Did I keep journals? No, no, I never did that, no. The \u2014 a closest thing I kept to\n166March 1, 1999\na journal was when I came to brazi \u2014 to America, I \u2014 I was here alone, I wrote home\nto my mother \u2014 well, to my parents actually, but she was the one that answered\nmore, although my father also wrote very often. I wrote daily, because I guess I was\nlonely, and also I wanted them to know what was happening, and I was so far away,\nand there was such a big sacrifice on their part to send me, that I sort of felt I should\ndo that. And my mother kept all those letters. So those letters still exist, some of\nthem are \u2014 most of them are still in Brazil, my brother has them. And \u2014",
        "Q: Was it your desire to go to the United States?",
        "A: Yes, I wanted to leave, A, as I told you, I really didn\u2019t want to take a secretarial\ncourse and study \u2014 and \u2014 and work there 1n an office, I wasn\u2019t very much \u2014 very\nexciting. And I did want to leave, because I guess that my feeling, after a few years\nthere \u2014 you see, going to the American school ha \u2014 was a \u2014 it was a mixed blessing\nin some ways, because my classmates, who were all American, were children of\ndiplomats, business people, and they kept coming and going. They would stay a year\nor two or three or four, whatever. But it was not \u2014 they were not in the country, and\nthey certainly all left, after they \u2014 we graduated, they all went back to the States to s\n\u2014 to school, an \u2014 even if their parents remained in Brazil. So you didn\u2019t really have\nfriends. Once the school was over, you didn\u2019t \u2014 not only friends, you didn\u2019t know\nanyone. That was the second reason. The third reason was that because my mother\n167March 1, 1999\nended up being very unhappy in Brazil, there was a lot of \u2014 there was a lot of\nunhappiness in \u2014 in my parents\u2019 home. There was a lot of friction, there was a lot of\nunhappiness. And so I was anxious to get away, I really was. So, that\u2019s why I\nwanted to go away. There were all these different reasons, but that\u2019s what I wanted.",
        "Q: What were your first impressions of the United States?",
        "A: Oh, I loved it, I loved it. Absolutely loved it. First of all, there was another thing\nthat I hated in Rio \u2014 although I shouldn\u2019t really say that, I \u2014 that I didn\u2019t like the\ncountry, because it\u2019s not fair. The country is really very, very nice, and the\nBrazilians are very nice people. And I later on met some, and my brother did not go\nto the American school right away. He later transferred. So he has Brazilian friends\ngalore, and \u2014 and also because he married a Brazilian woman, he \u2014 so I know a lot of\npeople \u2014 I knew some through him when \u2014 when ~ as an older sister when \u2014 because\nhe brought these people home. And he \u2014 he \u2014 they\u2019re lovely people, and they\u2019re not\n\u2014 they\u2019re not anti-Semitic, they\u2019re not \u2014 they\u2019re just very nice, hospitable, warm\npeople. So \u2014 but what I didn\u2019t like there was that basically my social life was within\nthe ca \u2014 what we call the colony. In other words, there were two Jewish clubs, and\nthey were social clubs. And so the young people like myself would go there and\nthere would be a record player, and you danced, and you dated these people and so\non. But it was very, very provincial. I always used to say, by the time I woke up, if I\n168March 1, 1999\nwent to a dance, or \u2014 and stayed out, you know, til midnight and then slept late the\nnext morning, by the time I woke up, my mother knew who I danced with, what I\ndid, where I went and the whole thing. So it was \u2014 it was very, very provincial. And\nmy parents social life also reflected that, you know. Lot of emphasis of who or what\nand where and when and how. So, because of that, I also wanted to leave, and when\nI came here, I had \u2014 to America, I came to New York, I had this wonderful feeling\nthat nobody cared what I did, nobody. And I was on my own and I was free, and I\ndidn\u2019t have to \u2014 to worry about anybody. I did like it, even though I was alone, I did\nlike it very, very much.",
        "Q: You were ninet \u2014 19 years old?",
        "A: I was 18 and a half \u2014 19, actually. I came here in February, and I graduated in \u2014\nin \u2014 in Brazil you graduate in \u2014 oh, when did we graduate? End of the year was in\nOctober, and then was vacation. And I didn\u2019t leave right away, because I had to wait\nfor the new term here, and also because the wa \u2014 Korean war had broken out, so my\nfather suddenly got very worried. And actually, originally, I was supposed to go to\nLondon. He agreed for me to go to London, he wasn\u2019t too keen on \u2014 on America.\nLondon, I don\u2019t know, London he felt a little more comfortable. When the Korean\nwar broke out, London was no longer an option, he was afraid of Europe and so on,\n169March 1, 1999\nand he decided \u2014 and \u2014 and I wanted to go to \u2014 to New York, to America. My father\nwas not keen on my leaving. It was my mother was, and he wa not.",
        "Q: Did you experience any anti-Semitism in Brazil during high school years?",
        "A: None, absolutely none. Because again, in Brazil \u2014 the Brazilians were not at all\nanti-Semitic and the American \u2014 my classmates and so on, no, no. No, they were\nvery \u2014 it wasn\u2019t that they did not like me, it was that I did not have enough in\ncommon with them to really \u2014 you know, to \u2014 to \u2014 to have some kind of real warm\nfriendship.",
        "Q: Now you\u2019re in New York City.",
        "A: Now I\u2019m in New York City, and again, because of what we went through, and\nalso because my father was \u2014 my father, at that point, was beginning to \u2014 to be\nestablished. He was making a living, and he had started and \u2014 but he wasn\u2019t terribly\nwell-to-do, because he had lost really everything. But \u2014 and at that time the Brazilian\ngovernment was allowing 200 daw \u2014 if you had a student, child, living abroad, they\nwere giving 200 dollars a month at the official exchange. So I was getting 200\ndollars a month. My father could afford that, that wasn\u2019t a big thing. But he was\nafraid that if things changed, or he suddenly couldn\u2019t afford it, or whatever, he\nwanted to make sure that I would learn, or be able to \u2014 to earn my living as soon as\npossible. So his condition finally was that if I did come to New York, he wanted me\n170March 1, 1999\nto go to secretarial school before I went to college. And that\u2019s what I did, I took a wa\n\u2014 so I went first to secretarial school, and I finished one year of that, and then I went\nto NYU. So \u2014I don\u2019t remember what your question was about \u2014",
        "Q: Well, it \u2014 I had previously asked you about anti-Semitism \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: \u2014 but then you went on to talk about \u2014 you answered that and then went on to talk\nabout being in New York.",
        "A: Yeah, well, I liked New York [indecipherable]",
        "Q: What did you concentrate \u2014 what did you major 1n in college?",
        "A: I took liberal arts, and I \u2014 I did two years of it, and by then I got married, so I\ndidn\u2019t finish, because my husband is almost 12 years older than I am and he was\nalready in business and established and we started a life where I also had to entertain\nand go out and I just couldn\u2019t do it all at the same time. And then we had chil \u2014 I had\nchildren very young.",
        "Q: And how did you meet your husband?",
        "A: Oh, that\u2019s actually a cute story. He \u2014 my father was a banker in Krakow before\nthe war, and my f \u2014 late father-in-law was in the banking business in Lwow in\neastern Poland. And so they had done some business together. They were not\nfriends, but \u2014 because they were living in different cities and it was a little bit \u2014 they\n171March 1, 1999\nwere different. But they had done some business together, and my late father-in-law\nfound out from some \u2014 some Polish people from Krakow that \u2014 who were neighbors\nof his actually, in the building where he lived, was a family from Krak\u00e9w who\nknew my parents, and found out that I was here by myself, studying. So he called\nme on night and said, my name is Oskar Gruss, and he \u2014 he was \u2014 said, I knew your\nfather, and I would like to \u2014 you to come for dinner. Now, I had gotten quite a\nnumber of invitations like that, because many people knew my parents \u2014 well, my\nfather, before the war. And if \u2014 they heard that I was alone in New York, so they\nwould invite me. And most of these ee \u2014 dinners were deadly boring, terrible. So \u2014\nand most of the names of the people who invited me, prior to this call, I had heard\nabout at home, you know, the \u2014 they \u2014 but this name I had never heard, so I decided\nthat I wasn\u2019t going to go there for dinner, and rush \u2014 he wanted me to come Friday\nnight. I said, I\u2019m sorry, Friday night I can\u2019t. So he said, when can you? So I said,\nMonday in two weeks, because I figured out \u2014 it took a week \u2014 it took five days\nactually, to write \u2014 to write a letter home and get an answer, so that would be 10\ndays. So it gave me over two weeks to find out who this person was. So he said\nMonday in two weeks, okay. And he said, we eat early, and \u2014 so be there at 6:30. All\nright, so I said goodbye and I said I would be. And in the meantime I wrote home to\nmy parents, and I said such an Oskar Gruss called me, invited me for dinner, shall I\n172March 1, 1999\ngo? Who 1s it? So I got back an answer sure enough, and my father wrote that there\nwas such a person, he was in the banking business, he was in Lwow, and he\nremembers him, you know, vaguely, not terribly, but \u2014 and that if I have nothing\nbetter to do on that Monday evening, I can go, I should go. So I decided to go. So I\nwent and I got there at 6:30 sharp and I \u2014 my mother-in-law \u2014 my future mother-in-\nlaw opened the door, and I saw this blank thing \u2014 he completely forgot to tell her.\nBut she caught on quite quickly, he mu \u2014 they must have talked about me, because\nonce I stood there \u2014 first I saw this blank stare, and then she \u2014 she sort of caught on\nwho I was. I introduced myself, and she was very nice. And then I saw the maid\nsetting another place, so obviously everybody had forgotten about me. And then I\nsat \u2014 and she was very nice to me, and we sat on the sofa and she actually asked me\na lot about what we had gone through, and wha \u2014 where was I and what was I doing,\nand so on. So, about half an hour later, the key turns 1n the door, and in comes my\nfather-in-law first, and my future husband behind him. And my father-in-law sort of\nwent with his head, oh my God, he said, cause he remembered he for \u2014 that he forgot\ncompletely that I was coming. Anyhow, then we sat down to dinner, and dinner was\na disaster, because my husband had a sister who\u2019s no longer alive, and she was\nstudying \u2014 oh, she was in third year law school, I think. And they were in Wall\nStreet, and the conversation, even though I knew English, seemed to me that I\n173March 1, 1999\ndidn\u2019t understand one word, didn\u2019t know what they were talking about. And so that\nwas dinner, and then right after dinner, we got up and my future husband said, I\u2019m\nvery sorry, but I have an appointment, and he got up and he left. And I said to\nmyself, I\u2019m going to wait 20 minutes, because I was told someone doesn\u2019t get up\nfrom the table and leave. But this was horrible, so I said to myself, I'll wait 20\nminutes and then I\u2019m leaving. So, during those 20 minutes, we sat on the sofa and\nmy father-in-law also sat with us, my mother-in-law talked some more. And she was\nvery nice, I liked her. And she \u2014 and my husband came back before those 20 minutes\nwere up. I later found out that he did have a business appointment on Broadway,\nnot far from where they lived, at the Schrafft\u2019s, they used to meet there at that time,\nand he had no way of contacting this person, so he ran over, told him I can\u2019t be with\nyou tonight, and came back, brought me home. So that was very nice. That was\nvery, very nice. Then I wrote home to my parents that \u2014 described the dinner, more\nor less, in the way \u2014 and there was one other detail that I omitted. My parents-in-law\nhad the large collection of Jewish paintings, you know, as they s \u2014 they just now\nactually was \u2014 part of 1t went to the museum, the Jewish museum in New York. But\nthey were all Oppenheimers(ph) and Kaufmans, so they were these Jewish heads.\nAnd all these things were staring down at me. And my father-in-law and my future\nhusband, this was a Monday night, were sitting in kippot. I had never seen that in\n174March 1, 1999\nmy life. So I was a little bit taken by that, you know, it was such a different kind of\nhome, I\u2019d never seen anything like that. So that was a little strange. So anyhow, I\nwrote to my parents home about this whole evening, and I got a letter back from my\nfather saying, in the year 1930, with a question mark, I remember sending him a\npresent for his Bar Mitzvah. Why isn\u2019t he married yet? So anyway, so that\u2019s how I\nmet my husband. We started going out, he started taking me out. This was in\nFebruary, so it was about a year after I came to New York. And I went and \u2014 we\nwent out from February til \u2014 til June. June I was going home for my vacation,\nbecause my s-school year was over. And I \u2014 he took me \u2014 he told me \u2014 he brought\nme a little radio, I remember, he brought me a present, the \u2014 the \u2014 just before I was\nleaving, and he said to me, I\u2019m very sorry, I won\u2019t be able to take you to the ship to\nsee you off \u2014 I was traveling by ship \u2014 because he said, it\u2019s a holiday. And I said, a\nholiday? Well, it turned out it was Shavuot, which was a holiday I never even heard\nabout. So at that point I found out that he\u2019s observant. He kept it from me, from \u2014\nfrom February until June, he took me out \u2014 I didn\u2019t realize that he was ordering fish,\nbecause I didn\u2019t really care what he was ordering. But we went out a lot, and I didn\u2019t\nrealize that he was religious. Never asked me out on a Friday, but you know, th-that\nwas \u2014 I didn\u2019t think about it. So when I came home to Rio, he came for the Fourth of\n175March 1, 1999\nJuly weekend, and he came to my \u2014 to our home, he met my parents, and so on and\nso forth. And we got engaged in September, after I came back.\nEnd of Tape Five, Side B\n176March 1, 1999\nBeginning Tape Six, Side A",

        "Q: Let\u2019s talk now a little bit about some of your thoughts. Do you feel that you\nwould be a different person today, if you hadn\u2019t gone through the historical\nexperience that you have?",
        "A: Probably yes, because when I graduated high school, I \u2014 really my dream was to\nstudy medicine. And whether it was a dream or whether I wasn\u2019t, you know,\npersevering enough \u2014 many people who went through what I went through did very\nwell after the war. I felt that my education was like a building without a foundation.\nWas a great building, but it \u2014 there was \u2014 as I had great, really great shortages. I\ndidn\u2019t know many things, even though I did finish this American high school, I had\nno \u2014 hardly any European history, hardly any \u2014 so anyhow, I felt it was without a\nfoundation. A building without a foundation, or \u2014 probably, if I had had a normal\neducation, I probably would have been a different person. I would have been a\ndifferent person also having lived in Europe and I don\u2019t \u2014 I imagine so that \u2014 that I\nwould have been very different, yes.",
        "Q: In what way\u201d?",
        "A: I would have probably achieved a little more than I did achieve on my own, a-\nafter the war. As I said, I would have had a \u2014 probably a better foundation, a regular\neducation. I probably would have been able to \u2014 to go on and \u2014 and you know, do\neither medicine, or \u2014 or something a little more concrete than what I did.\n178March 1, 1999",
        "Q: In the sense of coping with life, do y \u2014 do you think that you got skills that\nordinarily children don\u2019t get, because of what you experienced?",

        "Q: As an adult.",
        "A: Oh.",
        "Q: The adult that you became because of your childhood.",
        "A: I would think in some ways yes, that I\u2014 maybe that my perspective on life is\nsomewhat different than it would have been if I didn\u2019t go through what I went\nthrough. I had an interesting exchange just last week, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s relevant or\nnot, with Brenda about overprotective parents. And I had met this young \u2014 youngish\nwoman who has an only daughter, talking to another youngish woman who has an\nonly daughter. And they seemed to be terribly concerned because the class that these\nchildren, third graders were in, were going on some sort of a s-swimming \u2014 I don\u2019t\nknow, they \u2014 at \u2014 at some club or something, and one of the mothers was saying\nhow she\u2019s going also, because she\u2019s concerned they won\u2019t have enough lifeguards\nand 30 little girls swimming, and who knows \u2014 and these were not even Jewish\npeople, these were Catholic people. So I \u2014 I told Brenda about this, I said, I never\nwas concerned about \u2014 I mean, if the school took them someplace, I never thought\nthat there was any \u2014 so Brenda said, maybe 1 \u2014 and I said, this must be because\n179March 1, 1999\nthey\u2019re only children. And Brenda said no, maybe it\u2019s because you went through so\nmuch when you were a child, that \u2014 that what we were doing was so protected and\nso normal, never occurred to you that something could happen. And maybe that\u2019s\ntrue, as the \u2014 I thought about it. It was just something that happened 10 days ago, I\nstarted thinking about it, maybe she\u2019s right. So then I said to her, so I was not an\noverprotective mother? And she said no, you were not. And I really \u2014 maybe that\u2019s\nsomething that I got out of it. On the other hand, from having read a lot about\nsurvivors, I know that many of them are overp \u2014 very, very overprotective of their\nchildren. I guess the reason is that they feel that these children should accomp \u2014 you\nknow, that they \u2014 I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know why, but \u2014",
        "Q: Did you share your st-stories about your childhood with your daughters?",
        "A: Very little. Later on in life, when they became more interested, because when\nthey became more grown-up, and started reading and studying at university and so\non, they would ask me, and then I would tell them. I didn\u2019t want to burden anyone\nwith all of that. I felt that it was irrelevant, 1t wasn\u2019t that \u2014 it was over. And no, I\ndidn\u2019t tell them too much. Every once in a while, I would make a comment, I\nremember, to them, you know, when \u2014 when I was your age \u2014 you know, if there\u2019s\nsomething meg \u2014 you know, was like highly exaggerated I thought by then, I would\nsay, you know, when I was your age, I didn\u2019t have such and such, or I didn\u2019t even\n180March 1, 1999\nthink about such and such. As a matter of fact, I did that the other day, I don\u2019t\nremember what it was about, with my grandson Jonathan, and then he started to ask\nme, well, where were you, what were you doing? So I told him. As they asked me, I\nwould tell, but not \u2014 not share a whole lot of it. He \u2014 he said \u2014 he said to me, so\nwhere were you when you were my age, you know. So I told him, that\u2019s how it\nstarted, so I told him. So he said, so \u2014 so what happened? And \u2014 but then you \u2014 you\n\u2014 you \u2014 you stop, because it\u2019s hard for \u2014 you don\u2019t want to burden a child like that,\nand many of the things that happened un \u2014 until he studies history, until \u2014 and that\u2019s\nwhat I felt with my own children, until they have the historical background, they\nwon\u2019t be able to \u2014 to grasp what happened.

        "A: Oh, he came \u2014 he was very lucky, he left Poland at the a \u2014 my husband did, at\nthe age of 17, because in eastern Poland where he was, the an \u2014 the anti-Semitism\nwas really quite a problem for \u2014 for all of them, especially for my husband. And he\nleft \u2014 actually, it\u2019s interesting, he really ri \u2014 left for a vacation, summer vacation, to\nlearn a little English. So his parents sent him to England. And a ye \u2014",

And he fell in love with\nEngland and freedom, and \u2014 and he told his parents he\u2019s not going back, under no\ncircumstances. And they were very upset, because he hadn\u2019t finished high school,\nand \u2014 and he said he\u2019s not going back. And so he stayed in England and went to\nuniversity in England. Actually, he was able to convince the university in\nManchester, he wasn\u2019t able to do it in London, that his, what they call the small\nmatriculation, because there were two matriculations in Poland, one was at the age\nof 16 or 15, and then there was one an \u2014 the full one was at 18. And he had the little\none, and he had the \u2014 some sort of a diploma that that was it. And so he started\nuniversity in Manchester. And he decide \u2014 and he never went back, he \u2014 so he was\nlucky, because the war broke out a year later, and he was in England. So, he was in\nEngland, he finished the university in 1942. He came to America and he was\ndrafted, he was in the army. As a matter of fact, he was in the \u2014 1n the Battle of the\nBulge. He was \u2014 he was in Europe, he was overseas.

Yes, when things \u2014 especially when the Germans were there\nin Poland and in Hungary, I often \u2014 I wasn\u2019t angry, I wasn\u2019t \u2014 I often wished that I\nwasn\u2019t Jewish because things would be easier, would be better, and I wouldn\u2019t \u2014 yes,\nbut I wasn\u2019t angry, I wouldn\u2019t say I was angry.

        "A: They have changed in the sense that I no longer wish I wasn\u2019t Jewish. I just wish\nthat being Jewish, the way it is in America wouldn\u2019t be so \u2014 how shall I put it?\nWouldn\u2019t be such an important part of my life. I find it \u2014 there\u2019s just too much of it,\nit\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 being rai \u2014 I\u2014 you know, I wasn\u2019t raised in a home that was that Jewish,\nit\u2014 you were Jewish, you observed, my parents ob-observed Passover \u2014 after the\nwar I\u2019m now speaking. And \u2014 and Yom Kippur and Rosh Hashanah and that was\nbeing Jewish and \u2014 and nobody said you weren\u2019t Jewish, but that was about it. And\n183March 1, 1999\nit was wonderful, you had three big holidays a year, and so on. And here I find that\nit\u2019s just \u2014 I find it very confining, yes. But that has nothing to do with the war, I\nprobably would have found it very confining if I had \u2014 you know, if I had gotten\nfrom the kind of background I was from, into this kind of milieu, I may have found\nit very confining anyway. I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: You lost your childhood, in many ways. Did you ever feel that you got it back?",
        "A: No, no, you don\u2019t get it back, no. You lost it. And what I did feel very strongly\nwhen I had my own children was that I was very involved with them. I took care of\nthem myself, even though I didn\u2019t have to, and I enjoyed every moment of it,\nbecause I saw \u2014 you know, I enjoyed when they went to school, and \u2014 and \u2014 and\nenjoyed the fact that they enjoyed learning and did well. And \u2014 and enjoyed\nparticipating in day trips, and everything that \u2014 I spent a lot of time doing that, and I\nreally enjoyed it. Not always because of \u2014 for them, as I felt that I often relived a\npart of my life that I never had. So I think because of that \u2014 I loved, for instance \u2014 I\nwa \u2014 I\u2019m very f \u2014 very few women my \u2014 that I know, my friends, loved sitting in the\npark. I loved sitting in the park with those children and just observing them play.\nAnd \u2014 and the development, nobody ever concentrated on that, on my development,\nmy brother\u2019s development, you know, you \u2014 you were surviving, you weren\u2019t\ndeveloping. So that, I think I had from that, yes.\n184March 1, 1999",
        "Q: When your daughters turned the ages \u2014 the age that you were \u2014 let\u2019s say when\nyou and your mother and brother had to \u2014 you know, were on \u2014 in the train and\ngoing to Siberia, and all those very difficult times, did that bring back memories for\nyou? Was that an especially hard time, when they were the age that you were?",
        "A: No, I th\u2014I do though, think, or actually I did often, sort of, when they would turn\nseven, like when the war would break out, it\u2019s not that I rethought what happened to\nme so much as I sort of marked the time and said, this is when \u2014 when it started for\nme and \u2014 and look what they\u2019re like. And I was often amazed how \u2014 looking at\nthem, how childish they were, you know, here they \u2014 and \u2014 and when I think what I\nwas like at that age, that\u2019s when I realized what the war had done to me. At seven,\nyou know, I \u2014 I \u2014 even my grandchildren, I look at them, I mean, they \u2014 they\u2019re\nchildren. And when I think what I had to do and what I had to go through and what I\nhad to think when I was that age, yes, it\u2019s \u2014 so when these la \u2014 these mar \u2014 these\nages came, that \u2014 that were very significant in my life in terms of what happened to\nme, I would sort of look at them and say, my God, what was I like? How different\nwas I when they \u2014 when that happened \u2014 when \u2014 when I was that age, yes. But not\nthat I sat there and sort of reminisced, no. I\u2019m not that much of a reminiscing person.\nBut that did strike me, you know, when \u2014 when \u2014 and also the opportunities. But\nthen my husband says very often, rightly, that our generation, he also didn\u2019t have the\n185March 1, 1999\nopportunities that young people have today. Even though he \u2014 okay, he went to the\narmy, but \u2014 so \u2014 but \u2014 but \u2014 and he has a university education, but young pe \u2014 like\nBrenda, for instance, she could travel, she \u2014 she did, I mean, she did all these things.\nShe went to school, she traveled, she worked, she did all kinds of things before she\ngot married. We didn\u2019t have a chance to do any of that. The world has changed.\nYoung people also weren\u2019t as independent. But it often did sort of strike me how\ndifferent their life was, and I was determined, that I remember thinking, that I would\nmake sure that \u2014 that this should not happen to them. Yes, I di \u2014 in what way?\nMaybe by living here, or whatever, that \u2014 that I was hoping this would never happen\nto them. That I remember thinking, yes, that \u2014 that this kind of thing should not\nhappen to them.",
        "Q: Do you think it could happen again?",
        "A: Another war like that, and another \u2014 not quite like that, but horrible things could\nhappen, sure. Of course, yes, yes, we have no \u2014 no way of making sure that it will\nnot happen. Maybe not in the same form. Probably not in the same form.",
        "Q: Have you experienced anti-Semitism in your adult life?",
        "A: Once, in a very strange way in \u2014 actually in Poland. We went back about two or\nthree times. My father had property in Poland, which I now have. And it was very\nstrange, it was the first time we went back, my husband and I, we were together.\n186March 1, 1999\nAnd it was in 19 six \u2014 no, 1973. And we went to \u2014 to Krak\u00e9w, and we ac \u2014 actually,\nit was the only time in my life, including the wars, interestingly enough, that I\nexperienced outspoken anti-Semitism. Because during the war I never experienced\nit. mean, I knew they were murdering Jews, but the Germans were doing it, and I\npersonally never did. I wasn\u2019t in school, so I never did. And \u2014 and the Polish people,\nI also have very strong opinions about people \u2014 Polish people helping Jews, because\nthose Jews who survived like I did, at one point or another had to be helped by\nChristians. Otherwise there was no hope, there was no way you could have survived.\nBut anyway, I wa \u2014 we were in Krakow and we went to visit Auschwitz. Was a\nSunday morning. And we came back, and both my husband and I speak Polish, and\nwe had \u2014 we took a taxi or a driver, or whatever. And we came back from\nAuschwitz, it must have been like two o\u2019clock Sunday, and \u2014 we went early in the\nmorning, and we were starved. So we wanted \u2014 but we didn\u2019t \u2014 you feel funny after\ngoing there, funny. You feel very strange. And we didn\u2019t want to go to some fancy\nplace for lunch, so we decided to ask the driver to just take us someplace where\nthere\u2019s some food, where workers go. You know, a normal kind of place. So \u2014 so he\nsaid, okay, he\u2019ll take us where he sometimes eats and many of the cab drivers and\nworkers eat there. So he said a very unpretentious kind of \u2014 that\u2019s what we were\nlooking for, something unpretentious. So he took us there, and it was crowded, and it\n187March 1, 1999\nwas unpretentious and it was very crowded, and they were seating people together\nwith other people. So we sat down \u2014 they told us to sit at a table where there was a\nyoung couple. They were speaking Polish. My husband and I were speaking\nEnglish, because \u2014 but of course, they were speaking Polish because they were\nPolish, and we understood every word. And we sat down and we \u2014 I don\u2019t know, we\nspoke about, I don\u2019t know what we spoke about, but we spoke English. And there\nwas no menu, so we got a big plate of sauerkraut, mashed \u2014 and big, big portions,\nsauerkraut, mashed potatoes and some sort of meat. And I\u2014 I\u2019m a very good eater,\nbut it was a huge portion, particularly there were a lot of these potatoes. So I\nfinished everything except about half the potatoes. And she, the young woman,\nturned to her whoever he was, escort or \u2014 or boyfriend or husband, I don\u2019t know\nwhat he was, and she said to him, look she \u2014 he s \u2014 she said \u2014 and it\u2019s true that at\nthat time there were still shortages in Poland \u2014 one always has to understand where\nit all comes from \u2014 and she said, look she\u2019s \u2014 he \u2014 she said, she didn\u2019t finish her\npotatoes. That \u2014 and so he said, yeah, I see, and then she said \u2014 she was more\nvirulent than he \u2014 she was virulent, he wasn\u2019t. And she said, they\u2019re probably not\ngood enough for her. And then she turned to him and said, look, she has this big\nJewish nose. It was the only time \u2014 and to this day I\u2019m really mad at myself that I\ndidn\u2019t say any \u2014 something. But I was so taken aback. Also, I was so innocently\n188March 1, 1999\naccused, because I just couldn\u2019t finish those potatoes. But the point was, that this\nwas the only time, in all my life \u2014 I told my husband \u2014 the only time that I\nexperienced anti-Semitism, you know, in its rawest kind of form. So, nothing, I\ndidn\u2019t finish the potatoes, and they left, and so on. I wasn\u2019t \u2014 they finished, I mean,\nth-they had \u2014 she made that one remark, and then she didn\u2019t focus on us at all. But it\nwas interesting. So that was the only time I really experienced sort of \u2014 and that was\nafter the war, way after the war.",

        "A: Well, it\u2019s a pretty terrible place to visit. First of all, I was grateful I didn\u2019t end up\nthere. But, you know, I\u2019ve seen photographs, I\u2019ve read about it, I knew about the\ncamps already, you know, right after the end of war. It just bore out what I knew\nwas \u2014 had happened, and how it had \u2014 how it looked and so on.

We were lucky to survive, all four of us, but we knew that some of\nthem were \u2014 my father\u2019s brothe \u2014 brother-in-law was killed, his niece was killed. I\n189March 1, 1999\nknew all of that, so it wasn\u2019t 1t \u2014 we didn\u2019t \u2014 they didn\u2019t wait til after the war, 1t was\n\u2014 some of them were shot before they were deported, those pe \u2014 so we knew, yes, I\nknew, of course. Tha-Tha \u2014 it wasn\u2019t a big discovery after the war. There were\nmaybe individual \u2014 again, my situation is very different from other people, because\nmy parents, as I probably said at the beginning, were very, very wealthy before the\nwar. And we are \u2014 were raised in Vienna by governesses and nurses. We had no\ncontact with other children. And also my parents fo \u2014 the families were in Poland.\nSo in 1938, when we went to Poland, we still had no contact with anybody. My\nmother was afraid of \u2014 of children\u2019s diseases. At that time there were all these\nconcerns. So I hardly \u2014 I didn\u2019t know my cousins, I didn\u2019t \u2014 I met them in Siberia,\nthose \u2014 th \u2014 but those were the ones that went from Siberia to Palestine, so I knew\nthey were safe and I knew them a little during that one year in Siberia. But I didn\u2019t\nknow my uncles, I didn\u2019t know my aunts. My parents didn\u2019t \u2014 it was not a terribly\nclose, enormous family, it was not. So I \u2014 contrary to other people like my \u2014 like my\nhusband, when we went back to Lw\u00e9w, to wa \u2014 and also, he was older. So when I\nwalked with him through Lw\u00e9w, he would show me, he \u2014 this is where Aunt So and\nSo lived, and this is where Aunt So and So lived, and this is where the school was,\nand this is where the synagogue was, and this was here, and this was there. I didn't\nhave all of that. I didn\u2019t \u2014 I didn\u2019t know where my relatives lived.\n190March 1, 1999",
        "Q: Did he lose many members of his extended family?",
        "A: Mike? Yes, he did. Yeah, he lost a good number, yes, yes. His grandparent \u2014 I\ndon\u2019t know, yes, a good \u2014 a good number, yes. And so did we actually, because my\n\u2014 my \u2014 couple of my cousins, my \u2014 two of my aunts on my father\u2019s side. My\nmother\u2019s side, an uncle who I never met. One of my cousins, yes, I \u2014 I lost some, he\nlost some, yes. But I didn\u2019t know them well.",
        "Q: When you go into a room now, and you meet people who are amer \u2014 Native\nAmericans, and \u2014 do you feel like you are a different person than they are? Do you\nfeel like you\u2019re two different people, someone on the inside, and someone on the\noutside to the public, because of your experience?",
        "A: No, I do feel not two different people, I do feel very different from when I walk\ninto an American \u2014 into a room with Native Americans \u2014 it\u2019s not Native Americans,\nyou mean Jews who were born \u2014 born here, Americans who were born here. Yes,\nvery much so, yes. I do feel that. Don\u2019t forget, to this day I have an accent. So very\noften, to this day, I mean I still have a \u2014 an accent, I na \u2014 people can hear that I\nwasn\u2019t born here. So, to this day, people will ask me, you know, where are you\nfrom, and then they start, you know, asking you where you\u2019re from, or where were\nyou born. The next thing you know, they know that you went through the war,\nbecause in [indecipherable] figure out your age and so on. So they \u2014 unless I want\n191March 1, 1999\nto cut them short, which I do very often if I feel I don\u2019t want to talk about it, then P11\njust say, you know, I was born in Vienna, but I left when I was five. And then I\ndon\u2019t say where I left, I don\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t tell them that I went east instead of west. But\nyes, yes, I do feel different, yes, definitely.",
        "Q: How would you describe yourself today? Are you American, are you Polish?\nWhat are you?",
        "A: Definitely not Polish, but defi \u2014 I would say American. I \u2014 yes, I like this country\nthe most of any country that I\u2019ve lived in. I\u2019ve been very happy here. I like the\npolitical system. I think definitely American. But as I said, I think yesterday, that I\nstill feel \u2014 [inaudible, background noise] I still \u2014 you\u2019ll get that noise. [break] \u2014\nthat when I see the newspaper \u2014 I think I said that yesterday also, and there\u2019s some\nnews from Poland, I will read it, as opposed to let\u2019s say, news from Hungary,\nwhere I was a little while, and occasionally Pll look at it. But news from Poland I\nwill read, so I must have some sort of feeling about knowing the country, knowing a\nlittle about their problems, and being interested in it. Never read news about\nAustria, don\u2019t feel Austrian at all, even though I was born there. That I really don\u2019t.\nBut of course, we are all a little mixed up because we \u2014 because of the fact th-that\nwe didn\u2019t grow up here. You know, when you don\u2019t grow up someplace and you\nbecome naturalized much later in life, you probably feel differently. And also,\n192March 1, 1999\nEnglish is not my native language, I learned it much later. So, I think it has\nsomething to do with it. Today, for instance, and also interesting, during the Purim\ncelebration at JPDS, where I was with Jonathan today, they were singing all these\nPurim songs, it left me cold, I must say. But when they sang \u2014 what did they sing?\nNot the stars \u2014 \u201cAmerica, the Beautiful,\u201d I felt a twinge, I really did. So yes, I do\nlike this country.",
        "Q: How did you convey Jewish culture to your children, Jewish religion to your\nchildren?",
        "A: I didn\u2019t, my husband did. I really fe \u2014 was a very m \u2014 I did what \u2014 what was\nexpected of me. I didn\u2019t put any effort into that at all. My husband was the one who\ncared about it. And I didn\u2019t sabotage it, but I certainly didn\u2019t, you know, I didn\u2019t \u2014 I\nwanted my children to be Jewish, but I didn\u2019t put a great deal of effort into it. It\nwasn\u2019t may doing. If \u2014 1f\u2014 if it worked out, it was his doing.",
        "Q: Are you proud that you are Jewish?",
        "A: Y-Yes, but again, I don\u2019t \u2014 I\u2019m not proud of \u2014 of the way Americans feel Jewish.\nI \u2014 it \u2014 it \u2014 it actually upsets me. I don\u2019t like the fact that they\u2019re so \u2014 so sure of\nthemselves, so cocky, so \u2014 there\u2019s just \u2014 I keep thinking of it as just too much. Too \u2014\ntoo \u2014 politically when they also \u2014 all these \u2014 these pressure groups, and all this\nJewish stuff. And even Israel the way it\u2019s becoming today. This aggressiveness, and\n193March 1, 1999\nthis \u2014 you know, we are \u2014 we are different, we are better, we are th \u2014 it\u2019s just too\nmuch for me. Am I proud to be Jewish? Yes, in a quiet way, I\u2019m very proud to be\nJewish, but when it\u2019s \u2014 when it becomes overwhelming, and overbearing and then I-\nI don\u2019t like it.",
        "Q: What are your thoughts about Germany?",
        "A: Oh, Germany \u2014\nEnd of Tape Six, Side A\nBeginning Tape Six, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\nvolunteer collection interview with Riane Gruss. This is tape number six, side B,\nand I was asking you your thoughts and \u2014 about Germany.",
        "A: We went to Germany about \u2014 when did we go? About eight or 10 years ago\nthere was an exhibition of \u2014 I don\u2019t remember what it was, it was a history of the\nJews, it was in germ \u2014 in Berlin, and one of my mother-in-law\u2019s paintings was at\nthat exhibition, so we \u2014 we decided to go. So we went, and I found it \u2014",
        "Q: This is a painting your mother-in-law owned, or painted?",
        "A: Oh, yes, owned, owned, owned. From her collection. I found \u2014 first, what you do\nis, what most people I think do is, you sort of look around and you figure out\nwhether this person was alive during the war or not. That\u2019s what most people do and\n194March 1, 1999\nI did that to some degree also. And I soon realized that most people were not alive,\nbecause they \u2014 they were younger, my age or younger. And even if they were my\nage, then they were children during the war, so then I started telling myself that you\ncan\u2019t \u2014 you know, you can\u2019t hold \u2014 think about that all the time, you just cannot.\nAnd would I want to live there? No. Do I hate them? No. You know, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s hard\nto say what I think about them. I don\u2019t know whether they are any worse than \u2014 |\noften wonder what would happen in this country if there would be gradually, as very\ngradually our \u2014 th-the Nazi racial laws were \u2014 they didn\u2019t \u2014 they weren\u2019t done from\none day to the next. People don\u2019t realize that. It came on very gradually. If there\nwould be such laws passed against the black population, would we react, would we s\n\u2014 you know, some of us maybe the vi \u2014 but most of us would not. We would just sit\nquietly and \u2014 and \u2014 and probably not go out and help people and so on. So therefore\nI \u2014 I also know that helping was very, very difficult during the war. It was risky, it\nwas dangerous, it was more than \u2014 I mean, in Poland people who helped were\nexecuted. They \u2014 there was no trial, no anything if they were caught. So, under those\ncircumstances, would I do that for somebody else? Probably not. So therefore I have\nno \u2014 I don\u2019t hold it against them, I don\u2019t hate them. That\u2019s my feeling. I wouldn\u2019t\nwant to live there, but then I wouldn\u2019t want to live anywhere except here, so it\u2019s the\nsame \u2014 same thing. But I have \u2014 I \u2014 no, I don\u2019t hate \u2014 I don\u2019t hate that \u2014 hate them,\n195March 1, 1999\nno. Just like I don\u2019t hate the Poles for that one \u2014 I didn\u2019t enjoy that one anti-Semitic\nincident, but I don\u2019t hate them, no. I\u2019ve had some very good experiences with Polish\npeople as well. We were on a hiking trip, P\u2019Il never get \u2014 we went \u2014 my husband and\nI, we \u2014 one of the trips that we took, we went to Krakow about two \u2014 two or three\nyears ago when I start \u2014 when they started giving back property, we \u2014 I went, and we\nsaw lawyers and we did this and that and the other. And then there was a Polish\nholiday, so we suddenly found ourselves with three days or four days as \u2014 a\nweekend, and over the weekend, and so we decided to go to Zakopane. We had to\nremain, we had appointments afterwards. Zakopane is 1n the mountains, in the \u2014 in\nthe Tatra mountains. And both my husband and I enjoy hiking, they have wonderful\nwalks there, so we went. And we met \u2014 it was a sort of difficult, somewhat steep\nhike for us, and it was after a rain, and there was moss and it was a little slippery. So\nclimbing up was not bad, but I was afraid that it\u2019s not a loop. I wasn\u2019t sure it\u2019s a\nloop, and I was afraid of coming down the same trail. So, there was a young woman\nwith a better trail map than what we had, which was not very good. And she was\ngoing up and I \u2014 we asked her whether it was a loop and so on, and she said, yes, it\nwas a loop, we didn\u2019t have to come down the same way. And then she said she was\na very good hiker, and she said she\u2019s going ahead, but she has two or three friends\ncoming behind and they are slow, and they\u2019Il probably catch up with us, and we\n196March 1, 1999\nshould just follow them, and okay, thank you very much. We went up, and then sure\nenough there was a bu \u2014 they came up behind us and then we confirmed the route,\nand then they went ahead, and they were still faster than we. And eventually we \u2014\nwe met up with them again at the top where there was a beautiful overlook. And\ngoing \u2014 so, we already had talked with them, so we asked them about going down,\nwhich way the \u2014 you know, th-th-the \u2014 the trail, which was the best way to go down,\nthe easiest way, we were looking for. So they explained to us, and they explained to\nus that at some point there\u2019s going to be a V and we had to take an \u2014 but there was\nanother little trail, and then you had to take the left, but it was difficult. They said it\nwould be a little bit maybe difficult to find. So, we got there, to that point, and there\nthey were again. And they were sitting and waiting for us, and on the ground there\nwas, in little pebbles, they had made an arrow which one \u2014 but \u2014 and they showed us\nthat this is the arrow and they made it for us. And then I said, so why are you here?\nAnd they said, because we were really concerned about you, so we decided to wait\nfor you after all. I\u2019ve hiked in America, I\u2019ve hiked in \u2014 in Switzerland, we\u2019ve hiked\nin France, nothing like that ever happened to us. Did they know we were Jewish?\nProbably yes, because the way we speak Polish, th-they \u2014 we both speak well, but\nwe don\u2019t \u2014 y-you know, when you haven\u2019t been in a country for 45 years, even if\nyou speak continuously, it\u2019s a little \u2014 the language is a little different. And a-also,\n197March 1, 1999\nthey knew we had \u2014 were tourists, from the way we dress, from the way we \u2014 th-\nthere\u2019s no \u2014 I mean, nobody thought the \u2014 so that was very nice, very nice. Then we\nstarted talking some more, they invited us to their homes, but they \u2014 they were not\nfrom Zakopane, they were also there \u2014 they were someplace from the north of\nPoland where we wer \u2014 never went. But, you know, that was something and I\nthought it was very, very nice. Never happened anywhere else. So you can\u2019t tell.\nPeople are people, and they\u2019re different, and everybody\u2019s different.",
        "Q: What language do you think in?",
        "A: I think probably the language I speak in at the moment, but I do think probably in\nPolish quite often. But probably in the language \u2014 and people ask me what \u2014 what \u2014\nyou know, the classical question is what language do you dream in? I have no idea.\nBut probably the language I speak at the moment, I tend to \u2014 to do that. But I do \u2014\nwhen I am by myself, I think I sp \u2014 I think in Polish a lot.",
        "Q: Tell me briefly about what happened to your uncle, Joseph Schtiglietz(ph) who\nwent on to Palestine.",
        "A: He went to Palestine and he opened a gallery, like he did be \u2014 like he had before\nthe war. He did extremely well, and the gallery was just closed about two years ago,\nwhen he died. But he lived there, and he was definitely a Zionist, was a da \u2014 Zionist\nbefore the war. He was very happy to be in Israel, traveled very often to Europe\n198March 1, 1999\nand bought and sold and \u2014 and so on. And died a well t \u2014 very well-to-do man. So he\ndid very well. And his children \u2014 his daught \u2014 he has two daughters and a son. His\nwife died a few years before him, and they\u2019re \u2014 and the children all live in Israel, all\nthree of them, and they\u2019re married and have children and so on, and I\u2019m in touch\nwith them.",
        "Q: Was it very hard for you when he died, because you said you had such an intense\nconnection to him when you were younger?",
        "A: It was very hard, because he was also very sick for a long time before he died,\nand he was in a Senior citizen situation in \u2014 in Bat Yam, and I visit \u2014 I went all the\ntime when I was there, went all the time. But it was very \u2014 it was heartbreaking\nbecause he \u2014 it was hard to also figure out, you know, exactly what he had, because\n\u2014 it was probably a number of strokes, because in Israel I find they don\u2019t \u2014 it\u2019s not\nlike in America, in America people are very blunt, and the doctors tell the patient\nan-and you know exactly what, more or less, what the story is. Over there my\ncousins would say, well, you know, old age and so on. And it bothered me a lot\nbecause I couldn\u2019t get to the bottom of it, but he \u2014 he had \u2014 he was sick for a year,\nvery sick and \u2014 and \u2014 and then he died.\n199March 1, 1999",
        "Q: I was just thinking, he had such a profound effect on you and a profound\ninfluence on you as a child, but his lo \u2014 his an \u2014 his death must have been a\ntremendous loss for you.",
        "A: Yeah, it was, it was both for me and for my brother. We ta \u2014 often talked about it,\nabout that, yeah. And when we went to Israel, one of my main reason \u2014 we have a\nhome in Israel, and \u2014 and we did that when our children were \u2014 were ha \u2014 our older\ndaughter was about 10 when we built the home. So we did that when they were\nyoung, and the reason was, actually, that we wanted them to speak Hebrew well, and\nnot \u2014 you know, spoken Hebrew, and get to know the country, and my husband was\nalways interested in hi\u2014 zi \u2014 he \u2014 he 1s a Zionist, always supported the state. He also\nhas an office in Israel, he also was business-wise active. But the main reason why I\nsupported the whole thing was because of my uncle. I mean, otherwise, I wouldn\u2019t\nhave wanted to have a house there, and so on. But \u2014 so we saw a lot of him when we\nwere there, all the time.",
        "Q: Do you also speak Hebrew?",
        "A: I speak some Hebrew, yes. I learned it when I was \u2014 you know, I go there quite \u2014\nwe still go twice a year, all the time. And I \u2014 I don\u2019t speak terribly well, because \u2014\nmy husband speaks fluently and very, very well. But I just went to an old\n[indecipherable] in New York, and I found out exactly, the same as with my other\n200March 1, 1999\neducation, I learn languages by hearing, very easily. But because I never had any\nkind of Jewish education [indecipherable]. So I didn\u2019t \u2014 the \u2014 the class at the\n[indecipherable] was composed mostly of women who knew how to read very well,\nand knew how to pray, but couldn\u2019t put a sentence together, and I could speak very\nwell, but I couldn\u2019t read. So \u2014 and then they would sit there and start, you know\ndoing the diktuk(ph) and \u2014 and so on, and I dropped out, because that\u2019s not what I\nwas \u2014 I was interested in learning how to speak well, and \u2014 and so I learned it by be\n\u2014 first in the [indecipherable] basic things, then I had some private lessons and I go\nt \u2014 go to Israel all the time, so I understand well, and I speak well \u2014 well enough,\nbut I don\u2019t read it, and tha \u2014 it\u2019s a superficial kind of thing, but I don \u2014",
        "Q: Speaking of Israel, what was your reaction at the time of the Eichmann trial? Do\nyou remember anything special?",
        "A: I remember the Eichmann trial, I was terribly happy that they caught him, and I\nthought it was a great trial, and was a great thing for Israel and I was all in favor of\nit. I can\u2019t say that I felt the same way when Demjanjuk was tried, and subsequent,\nyou know, that kind of thing. Because again, you \u2014 it\u2019s like with a very, you know,\nsuccessful event, it\u2019s hard to repeat it. And sometimes it\u2019s counterproductive.",
        "Q: Did it stir memories, the Eichmann trial, for you?\n201March 1, 1999",
        "A: A little bit, because Eichmann was in Hungary, I don\u2019t know if you realize. He\nwas the one that \u2014 and there were \u2014 that\u2019s why the deportations from \u2014 from\nHungary were so efficiently done, because he came there and he did it very quickly\nand efficiently. So I kept hearing the name Eichmann. So it didn\u2019t stir memory \u2014\nwell, you know, I th \u2014 I was afraid it didn\u2019t \u2014 that we would be deported, we\nweren\u2019t. So, after the war, when he was caught, I was just glad that he was caught,\nand I thought it was a very worthwhile trial, both for Israel and for the world. That \u2014\nthat one trial I thought was great, but I don\u2019t like when they try these people who are\nnow in their 80s, and you know, like in France when they tried \u2014 who was it that\nthey were trying, was so old, and it\u2019s \u2014 it doesn\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t think it makes sense to\nput \u2014 to \u2014 for that kind of thing to \u2014 to be tried so many years later. You don\u2019t have\nthe witnesses, you don\u2019t have anything.",
        "Q: Do you have any special attachments to the civil rights movement here in the\nUnited States, again, because of your experience?",
        "A: I\u2019m not a very political person, wa \u2014 the only thing \u2014 no, not the civil rights, no, I",
        "Q: A sensitivity, in a\u2014 wa \u2014 do you feel you have a greater sensitivity to it?",
        "A: Yes, I would say sensitivity, yes. When I read about what does happen, or\ndoesn\u2019t happen, especially now in New York, we have all these incidents with \u2014\n202March 1, 1999\nbecause of the police seems to overreact because of our present administration, I get\n\u2014 I read all of that and it upsets me. The other sensitivity that I have is that I became\naware of an organization called the Abraham Fund in New York, which is an\norganization that tries to promote better understanding and \u2014 and coexistence\nbasically, between Israeli Jews and Arabs, in \u2014 in Israel within the Green Line and\nI\u2019m very active with that, because I think that, you know, having, like my husband\nsaid, having been a second class citizen in a country like Poland, one knows what it\nfeels like to be an Arab in Israel, with the same problems of having an identity card,\nwhere you\u2019re \u2014 you know, the religion is stamped in and that sort of thing. So,\nbecause of that, I do have more of a sensitivity about that. But mainly in connection\nwith Israel, not so much with America, because in America, it\u2019s a problem that I\u2019m\nnot familiar enough with, or knowledgeable enough where I think, you know, that I\ncan actively make an enormous difference. So I just read about it.",
        "Q: You had said earlier that you are \u2014 you don\u2019t read other Holocaust memoirs, but\nyou read historical books, 1s that correct?",
        "A: Historical books? Not so much historical as when there\u2019s something worthwhile,\nfrom a different point of view. For instance, I found that f\u2014 I don\u2019t remember what\nthe name of it was, a book that somebody recommended to me just last year, about\nwomen. It was called, between courage and something else. Not a very good title, I\n203March 1, 1999\nthought. A woman who is, I think a sociologi \u2014 a professor of sociology, whatever,\nand who wrote about women in Germany, ger \u2014 the Jewish women in Germany,\nbetween 1933 and \u201939. It wasn\u2019t even about the war. And I found \u2014 that kind of\nthing I find very interesting because it \u2014 it talked about how the structure of the\nfamily changed, as the men were losing their positions and were not allowed to wo \u2014\nto execute, let\u2019s say, doctors were not allowed to practice, you know, as the racial\nlaws progressed in Germany. Before the war, women tended to sometimes earn a\nliving, sometimes the men became so isolated and so discouraged and so\ndemoralized that the women were the f \u2014 th-the force behind the family. Also, when\nthey had the discriminatory laws against children in schools, it was the women who\nwent to the schools, and \u2014 and \u2014 and were 1n touch with the children, and heard\nabout all of that. Also, when the husband was arrested, which happened very often at\nthat point, or had some running in with the police, it was the women who went in\nand tried to \u2014 to talk to the police and tried to help the husbands. It totally changed\nthe structure of the family. The women became the \u2014 the stronger part of the family,\nvery often in \u2014 in a way that would not have happened at all, had it not been a \u2014 ina\n\u2014a-\u2014had this not happened. And I find that kind of thing interests me very much. It\n\u2014 It\u2019s partly, you know, German anti-Semitism, Holocaust, but it\u2019s not just a story of\nwhat somebody went through, but how it affected life and affected the families, and\n204March 1, 1999\naffected every-everything; how it changed things; how it showed \u2014 I \u2014 I \u2014 I also\nnoticed that in my own family, that my mother was the much more, somehow,\nresourceful person during the war than my father, who had a tremendous position\nbefore the war. But once all of this was taken away from him, he \u2014 it \u2014 and I, of\ncourse, as a child I never understood what was going on. That kind of thing interests\nme, that kind of thing I read. There was recently a book by a German man written,\ncalled \u201cThe Reader,\u201d did you read that?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: I find \u2014 that I find also very interesting; motivation, why and so on. Little \u2014 in\norder to \u2014 I read about the Holocaust only things that I \u2014 books that I think will give\nme more insight. That \u2014 that\u2019s the only reason why I read them. Otherwise I really\nam not interested.",
        "Q: Are there any sights or sounds today that make you think back, or odors, smells,\nor even getting on a train? Does any of this ever trigger thoughts of the war?",
        "A: Not odor and not smell and not trains. What does trigger is music, I would say.\nAnd not some lofty music, but let\u2019s say if I hear someplace, in an old, whatever,\n\u201cLili Marlene.\u201d That triggers it. But \u2014 or the other day I saw, gee, a wonderful film,\nwhich I think is going to be released, called comede \u2014 \u201cComedian(ph)\nHarmonicum(ph).\u201d Did you hear about it?\n205March 1, 1999",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And that kind of music then triggers, but not, no, not trains and not \u2014 trains are so\ndifferent now, you know, what \u2014 what \u2014 I mean, if you take Amtrak from \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014",
        "Q: Well, I meant because you were what, six weeks on a train.",
        "A: Yeah, I know, no \u2014 yeah, but wa \u2014 the train itself is so different that it doesn\u2019t\ntrigger that, no, mm-mm, no, no.",
        "Q: What about lots of snow?",
        "A: Snow, that\u2019s a good question, I 1 \u2014 st \u2014 I love it. I think it\u2019s beautiful when it falls.\nIn New York there was \u2014 when we had that \u2014 what was it, the storm \u2014 not storm,\nwhat did they call it? The blizzard, a few years ago, I at \u2014 and I went to the park, I\nsort of said to myself, here we have \u2014 what did we get, say 12 inches, 16 inches, I\ndon\u2019t know. And I remember \u2014 and I said to myself, this is lovely, but, you know,\nit\u2019s really not terribly much; they make such a fuss over it. But what we had in\nSiberia, the snow falls and it di \u2014 never, ever melts. And I remember when we were\ngoing to this school there, there was like a little \u2014 it was like a corridor and on both\nsides the snow came up to practically my \u2014 to my shoulders, I \u2014 just my little head\nwas out there. So \u2014 and it was like that for months and months. So, yes, I did think\nabout that for a moment, but just as a joke, rather than \u2014 you know, it doesn\u2019t trigger\nanything horrible.\n206March 1, 1999",
        "Q: Is there anything else that you wanted to say, or anything we haven\u2019t covered?\nAnything \u2014 any maybe messages to your grandchildren? Anything you\u2019d like to say\nbefore we close?",
        "A: Messages to my grandchildren. I hope it never happens to them. No. I hope they\nhave good lives, and then you know, will \u2014 will just see this as an interesting thing\nthat happened to one of their grandparents. No, nothing special.",
        "Q: Well, thank you very much for doing the interview.",
        "A: You\u2019re very welcome. You\u2019re very welcome, I hope it, you know, it\u2019s of interest\nto somebody at some time. My grandson today asked me about this, my eight year\nold, why are you doing this? Why are you telling Gail about this? So I said to her \u2014 I\nsaid to him, it\u2019s going to go to the museum, the Holocaust Museum. And he \u2014 and he\nsaid why? And I said, well, you know, maybe someday somebody is going to study\nabout what happened in Europe at that time, and maybe they\u2019Il look for somebody\nwho was not very old, or was still a child and was in Hungary. And they\u2019|l look up\nin the index and they\u2019ll look up Hungary, and there\u2019II be one other story, it will be\ndifferent from what Hungarian children went through, because I\u2019m \u2014 wasn\u2019t\nHungarian, I \u2014 and ho \u2014 he said oh. That was the end of that. So, I tried to explain to\nhim wa \u2014 what this is good for. So I hope in that sense that, you know, it\u2019s good for\nthat.\n207March 1, 1999",
        "Q: It certainly is. Well, that\u2019s a wonderful note to end on. Thank you again.",

        "A: No, he\u2019s 18 months younger than I am.",
        "A: No, we did not have \u2014 well, I should qualify that. When \u2014 when we were born,\nwe were born in Austria, and my parents lived half in Austria and half in Poland.\nThey both had family in Poland, but we had no family in Austria.",
        "A: Mostly my parents went back and forth. We, my brother and I being very young\nand very sheltered, very rarely. We stayed in Vienna, and my parents would come\nand see us, or take us on vacation, or be with us the part of the time that they were\nin Vienna. In other words, we were raised by a governess or nurses. Spent a lot of\ntime away from my parents, although they kept coming, but we were at \u2014 basically,\nuntil I was five years old, until 1938, that\u2019s how we lived.",
        "A: Yes, because I went there and looked at the street and the house in 1945 - \u00b046,\nright after the war, and also from my parents\u2019 stories. We lived there in \u2014 in the\nApril 22, 1994\ncenter of town. We lived in the \u2014 what\u2019s known as the third bezirke, which is a\nsection of Vienna right near the Belvedere Palace, and we had a private three floor\nhouse, a walk-up kind of thing. I do remember glimpses of it from before the war,\nnot too much.",

He\nhad a furniture factory and a brick factory in \u2014 in Austria, in Vienna. And because\nhe had wide interests in Austria and my mother preferred Austria to Poland, that\u2019s\nApril 22, 1994\nwhy we \u2014 he had a residence in Austria, and that\u2019s why my brother and I were born\nin Austria.",
        "A: I did not begin school at all, because the war broke out September 1\u201c, 1939, and\nI was just \u2014 I had just turned in August, seven, and in Poland school started at sev \u2014\nyou know, first grade at seven. So I had just been registered. By then we were in\nPoland, because we went from Vienna to Poland after the anschluss. And so I\nnever went to school.",
        "A: Not at all. Not at all, except that they were \u2014 I can only \u2014 I don\u2019t remember too\nmany holidays before the war, barely any at all. I remember one Passover in 1938,\nin Poland already, maybe \u00b039, and \u2014 but I don\u2019t remember any Jewish observance. I\ndo know that they felt Jewish. During the war I remember that I knew we were\nJewish, and so on, but I don\u2019t remember any tradition at home until after the war.",
        "A: Never.\nApril 22, 1994",
        "A: Never. I know I never went. Nev \u2014 I\u2019d never been to synagogue before the war,\nor during the war, for that matter. But I \u2014 the first time I was in a synagogue was\nafter the war, in Brazil.",
        "A: Not too many playmates, because at that time, somehow children were more\nisolated. There was more fear of contagion and illnesses and all kinds of things.\nAnd I had a younger brother and the idea was that that was companionship enough.\nAnd so I re\u2014I only remember very few other children, not at all on a steady basis,\nand my brother and I just played together. We also \u2014 neither one of us went to any\nnursery school or anything. But I know from what I heard later, that was not\nunusual. Children \u2014 some children did grow up \u2014 I think the more affluent people\nbrought up their children that way. I do know that some \u2014 some of my cousins, my\nhusband\u2019s family, his \u2014 they seem to have had a lot of contact with their cousins,\nwhich I didn\u2019t because I was in Vienna until I was five, so I \u2014 until I was five I\ncertainly don\u2019t remember any other children.",
        "A: \u00b038.\nApril 22, 1994",
        "A: I recall that we had went on a train trip somewhere, and then, with our\ngoverness, or nanny, or whatever, and we went to Krakow from Vienna without\nour parents, and met them 1n vien \u2014 in Krakow when we arrived. And I remember\nthat we were told that we are going to live here from now on for \u2014 for good. And\nthat we had \u2014 and they hired a new governess, who spoke Polish, which we didn\u2019t\nspeak, my brother and I, and that we were told that it was important for us to learn\nPolish.",
        "A: German.",
        "A: German, yes. So, I remember that we then started living in Poland. That\u2019s when\nI first also saw some of my relatives. I remember my grandfather coming to our\nhouse, and going to my maternal grandparents, meeting some of my cousins, and\nduring the \u2014 tha \u2014 at that point, I remember that.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know the exact months, but it must a \u2014 it was right after the anschluss.\nWe were still in Vienna during the anschluss, and my parents were horrified\nbecause they were in Poland and this happened that \u2014 an-and the two children were\nin Vienna. And then they were able to smuggle us out, through Switzerland. They\nApril 22, 1994\nsent somebody from Switzerland to pick us up, I know to this day who it was. And\nthis young man pretended that he was married to our governess, and he had a Swiss\npassport. My brother and I had no papers, or whatever papers we had probably were\nnot very good for us. And so they took us out, since we were so young, to\nSwitzerland, pretending that we were their children.",
        "A: His name was Oswild(ph) Landau(ph). He was the son, a young son of my\nfather\u2019s partner in Switzerland, and he\u2019s still alive, I know, because I hear from\nhim and see him occasionally. He\u2019s in \u2014 quite old now.",
        "A: That\u2019s right, that\u2019s right. But they didn\u2019t go all the way with us to Krakow. They\n\u2014 my parents then picked us up in Switzerland.",
        "A: And then we went to Krakow, and they of course stayed. He lived in\nSwitzerland.",
        "A: Not at all.\nApril 22, 1994",
        "A: Not \u2014 no, because I think we told we were going to go somewhere and meet my\nparents, or \u2014 no, I don\u2019t remember it at all. The only thing I do remember from that\ntrip was that \u2014 that I was surprised that we were going with them, and that my\nparents didn\u2019t come. I was a little surprised, but I can\u2019t say that I was surprised\n[indecipherable] I don\u2019t remember it well.",

        "A: Not at all, no.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: We \u2014- my father and mother had an apartment because there, as I said, they spent\na lot of time in Krakow as well. They had a large apartment right above the bank.\nThe bank was on the main floor of this building, and our apartment was on the\nApril 22, 1994\nsecond floor. And it was a corner building, so the apartment went all the way\naround the corner.",
        "A: Yes, it was called Sarego, and corner of Gertrudy. It was right near what\u2019s\nknown the Planty, which is the moat that surrounds Krak\u00e9w, which is now a park,\nor at \u2014 and was at that time, as well. It had been a moat during medieval times, and\nit then was turned into a park.",
        "A: There, I begin to remember that my mother was nervous.",
        "A: Jittery. No, nobody ever told us why. This was the year before the war, life was\nquite normal in \u2014 in other respects for us, but I remember that she was nervous\nbecause she would take me out sometimes, and if I didn\u2019t \u2014 like I was terribly\nfrightened of thunderstorms, and \u2014 and rains, and I was once out with my mother,\nshe took me and \u2014 and a thunderstorm came and she was terribly upset with me\nbecause I cried and screamed. And I remember feeling that it \u2014 things were not as\nnice as they used to be, but I can\u2019t really put my finger on it in any way, no.\nApril 22, 1994",
        "A: I don\u2019t quite remember, I think just going to \u2014 to the park, and having this new\ngoverness who \u2014 the language was a bit of a problem, even though we learned very,\nvery quickly. I remember my brother saying some things in Polish that were very\nfunny, and everybody laughed at them. And they were direct translations from\nGerman, I\u2019m sure I did that as well. And I remember, as I said, some of my\ngrandparents coming and visiting, and us visiting them. I remember that the\nchildren who had grown up in Poland, my cousins, behaved very differently\ntowards my grandparents from the way we were told to behave. Like they \u2014 they\nwould kiss their hands, my mother didn\u2019t let us do that, so we were different. I\nremember being different. Actually, I remember that all my life, being different.\nAnd so the routine I think was just to \u2014 to go to the park and to eat and to sleep and\nto go out for walks, and nothing in particular. No school or anything like that.",
        "A: No, no. Actually, I don\u2019t remember any contact with any children except my\ncousins occasionally. Even that was not encouraged, it was \u2014 my parents were not \u2014\nmy parents were not that family conscious, I would say. That \u2014 you know, it wasn\u2019t\nthe famil \u2014 because they lived from far away and because they \u2014 my father was very\nestablished and very worldly. And before he married my mother he already lived all\nover the world and so on. Their lifestyle was different from my parents\u2019 relatives in\nApril 22, 1994\nKrakow and therefore, I think they didn\u2019t always spend a lot of time together. My\nmother was close to her brother, who will appear later.",
        "A: I should add also that my mother was to her own par \u2014 actually, my mother was\nclose to her own family, but I think she lost some contact while she was living\naway, and \u2014 but she was closer to her family than maybe my father was to his.\nOkay.",
        "A: Oh, the next change I remember very, very distinctly was when the war broke\nout. And that was September 1\u2018, 1939, and I do remember the terrible commotion\nand screaming and yelling and peop \u2014 and packing, and \u2014",
        "A: I can\u2019t remember the exact day, but I was certainly at home, which I described\nbefore, and my parents were very nervous, and everybody was packing. We were all\nat home and \u2014 and we were \u2014 th \u2014 we \u2014 my father had a large car and my \u2014 I guess\nsomebody else had a car, but I remember there was a lot of discussion about who\nwas going to go in which car and how many things we can take and where we\nshould go. And in the end we ended up in this car with my father\u2019s, I guess sister\nand my cousin who was much older, she was 14. And her father was the director of\nApril 22, 1994\nthe branch in Krak\u00e9w, so he was the one who was most closely associated with my\nfather in business. That was his brother-in-law, and they were with us in the car.\nAnd \u2014",
        "A: Their names was \u2014 her name was li \u2014 my cousin\u2019s name was Stefunia(ph),\nwhich is Stefanie(ph), and the last name was Raab, r-a-a-b, and her father\u2019s name\nwas Leon Raab. And \u2014 and my aunt, was my father\u2019s younger sister, her name was\nEugenia, and we went in this car for a while, and the next spot where we were\nsupposed to stop was \u2014 I don\u2019t remember the name of the small town, it may come\nback to me. But it was the hometown of this new powe \u2014 Polish Jewish governess\nthat they hired when we came from \u2014 from Vienna. And \u2014",
        "A: Amalia(ph) \u2014 we called her Tetta(ph), because we called all our governesses\nTetta(ph), which was evolve \u2014 which was baby talk for schweste in German, and\nthen they all became Tettas(ph). So her name was Tetta(ph), just like every other\none, and her parents came from this little town, which must have been a little bit\neast of Krakow, because we were definitely going east.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember. Whatever they let me or didn\u2019t let me, I don\u2019t remember.\nApril 22, 1994",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Frightened, uncomfortable. Everybody was nervous, it was tight, it was a long\ntrip. There was a lot of discussion, among my parents particularly, as to where to\ngo, and my father, who was very much of an optimist, unfortunately did not size up\nthe situation very well, and thought it would pass in some way, thought that we\nwould be comfortable at the \u2014 at the home of this governess, because her parents\nwere there, and because there would be food there and sh \u2014 and so on, and my\nmother, who was arguing that this was stupid, that as \u2014 that we shouldn\u2019t stop\nanywhere and we should just go straight to the border with Romania, that was what\nmany people did, and better than we did. But my father felt that it was not\nnecessary, it was a panic, it was \u2014 also, I should actually rectify this. We did not\nleave September first, we left September third, because my father insisted on\nstaying three days in Krakow aft \u2014 when the war began, because people were\ncoming to the bank to get money out, and he felt he couldn\u2019t leave and disappoint\nthem. So, we waited two \u2014 two days or three days, which was also somewhat fatal.\nSo, I remember a lot of argument about leaving late. Was a lot of tension. That I\nremember, there was a lot of tension.\nApril 22, 1994",
        "A: No, it didn\u2019t mean anything except this panic that \u2014 that just sort of rained\naround me, I didn\u2019t know why.",
        "A: It was more the atmosphere, I didn\u2019t have any concept of what the Germans \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 were, why everybody was scared, no, definitely not. Children were not as\nincluded in those days as they are now, in Poland. We were very sheltered, and I\nnever, for instance, ate with my parents before the war. So, you know, we led very\nmuch a separate existence. So we always ate in our room. So I really don\u2019t know.",
        "A: Yes, we did. We did, and we must have been there \u2014 and my timing will be\nconfused, because I don\u2019t know, we must have been there two or three days. And\nthen of course, the war progressed, and I remember there was the first bombing was\nthere, there were \u2014 you know, there were siren, there were planes, we went to some\ncellar. There was a commotion, 1t was crowded in her house. And I don\u2019t know how\nlong we were there, probably a few days, and then we started moving east again.\nApril 22, 1994\nAnd again in the same car, and all in all, we were, I think, 14 people, between that\ncar and my uncles car, I think. That means on my father\u2019s side.",
        "A: Yeah, there was a bombing, and I remember a lot of commotion and going into \u2014",
        "A: Yes, because it was noisy. It was very, very, you know, that the siren was noisy,\nthe bombs were noisy, the planes coming low, and it was \u2014 yes, that was \u2014",
        "A: You did see planes, yes, yes. And that was frighten \u2014 frightening. I must say, I\nwas very frightened of bombing throughout the war. Some people were more \u2014\nsome children were more, some were less, I was always very frightened of\nbombing. To me it was worse than lightning; I was frightening of lightning and this\nwas like, you know, amplified lightening. So, I was always afraid of that.",
        "A: Then we continued on in two cars, and \u2014",
        "A: Yes, but now I may \u2014 getting confused. I remember our car, but then my\nmother\u2019s brother somehow was there too, and he was in another car with his family,\nand I guess my mother\u2019s sister and her two sons, and there was a lot of family at\nApril 22, 1994\nthat point, and we were in two cars, and we headed east. And then I remember the\nnext stop was some sort of an abandoned house, where the people had fled. It was\nnot a Jewish house, it was like an estate. And 1t was abandoned and we \u2014 it was big,\nand we were very happy to find shelter there, and we stayed there a couple of days.\nAnd by that time it was difficult to get gasoline, and so my uncle went out to try to\nget gasoline, they got gasoline. And then there was a commotion; my father was\nready to stay as usual, and then my father \u2014 but then he was convinced that he \u2014 that\nwe shouldn\u2019t stay, and in the meantime we had news \u2014 we already saw, I remember,\nPolish soldiers who were either deserting, or their units had been broken up, they\nwere running. And we knew that the front was not doing very well, and the\nGermans were advancing, so then we went, again, east. And I don\u2019t know how\nmany days this whole trip took, but it took a few days. When it \u2014",
        "A: We -\u2014 on the way, we bought \u2014 I guess we had some money, we bought food, and\nin this house that was abandoned, we found food. I remember that was one reason\nwhy we stayed there for a few days, that there was plenty of food there. And then\nwe went on and the next memory I have was of a little town called Zwatruf(ph),\nwhich was already in eastern Poland. And there we \u2014 there we got into some\napartment that belonged to some Jewish people. It might have been somebody my\nApril 22, 1994\nfather knew, I don\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t know who they were. But there I remember a big\ndiscussion between \u2014 a big more than discussion, a fight between my uncle and my\nfather, because it was \u2014 by that time it was \u2014 I remember that it was the first Jewish\nholiday, it was Rosh Hashanah, and my father decided to stay over the holiday and\nthen continue to the Romanian border, because that was sort of the ultimate goal,\nthat everybody thought we \u2014 one should go to. And my uncle felt that we should go\nimmediately, and this is nonsense to start sitting and waiting. And \u2014 but then my\nfather wasn\u2019t well, he didn\u2019t feel well, and we stayed. And we stayed there, I think,\nover the holidays, and maybe a couple of days longer. I don\u2019t remember how long\nwe were there, but it was a few days. And then, because he didn\u2019t feel well, we did\nnot go to the Romanian border til much, much later.",
        "A: In between I just remember that we were living in \u2014 in very uncomfortable\nconditions and everybody was discussing when and where we should go, that\u2019s all I\nremember. But it was like a layover, we were just there waiting to \u2014 to decide what\nnext. That\u2019s all I remember.",
        "A: And then eventually, yes, my father was feeling better. I later found out that it\nwas a gallbladder attack. He had gallbladder problems, I didn\u2019t know what they\nApril 22, 1994\nwere at the time. So that delayed us. Again it was the Jewish holidays originally,\nthat we were supposed to wait just for two days and then he didn\u2019t feel well, so it \u2014 I\ndon\u2019t know how long we were there. But anyway, then we went to a place called\nKolomyia which was on the border, not far from the border. And there I think we\nstayed with \u2014 I don\u2019t know, in somebody\u2019s house, wasn\u2019t too uncomfortable. And\nwe had \u2014 by then the borders had been closed, they were already guarded. The\nconfusion was somewhat over. The Russians had occupied eastern Poland, the\nGermans had occupied western Poland. This was already after the three weeks that\nPoland defended itself. And at that point I remember we were in Kolomyia and we\nwere waiting there to go to Romania. And by that time there were some guides, and\npeople who would help, for money, would help you cross and so on, but you had to\nwait, because they couldn\u2019t take too many people at the same time. And at that time,\nI even remember that they did put me in a school, because I \u2014 I remember sitting\nthere and making whole rows of As and Bs on lined paper. And we were there for\nthree months.",
        "A: This was my first school. And I remember writing As and Bs and straight lines. I\nremember that.\nApril 22, 1994",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember so much the school itself as having to write these long lines of\nthe same letter. It was a public school in this little town Kolomyia. And since we\nwere there, and they just sent us to school. Not us, my brother didn\u2019t go, he was too\nyoung, I did. So I went to first grade.",
        "A: Non-Jewish children, yes. Po \u2014 it was a Polish school.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: By then I could speak, yes, because we were there already a year, and with this \u2014\nthis last Tetta(ph) hardly spoke any German, that was why they hired her, and so\nyes, yes; children learn very quickly.",
        "A: No, no, I don\u2019t remember any at all, no.",
        "A: No, no, no, no, no, we just lived there. No, I don\u2019t \u2014",
        "A: Kolomyia apparently, this I learned later, was a very Jewish town, full of Jews.\nSo maybe our neighbors and everybody was Jewish. I really don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t\nknow, I \u2014 I wasn\u2019t aware of it one way or the other.",
        "A: Calm. Absolutely, relatively calm, yes. And then one ma \u2014 one day my mother\ntold us that my brother and my father were going to cross the border beca \u2014 an-and\ngo, and leave and then she and I would follow a few days later. You couldn\u2019t cross\nin large groups. It was done by [indecipherable] and my \u2014 my father was supposed\nto go with his brother-in-law, and he did, as a matter of fact, and my brother. Fo \u2014\nwhy the men went ahead, wha-wha-what this decision was made on, I don\u2019t know,\nbut the idea was that they would go ahead and then my mother and I would follow. I\ndo know that my aunt and my cousin, who was with us originally in the car, had\ngone directly to the border when my father was delayed by his illness, and they\nwere already in Romania. And that\u2019s why maybe her husband, who was my\nfather\u2019s brother-in-law, was supposed to go first with him, and I guess they decided\nto take my brother, so that my mother wouldn\u2019t have to go with two children. I\ndon\u2019t know what the reasoning was, but that\u2019s how it was.",
        "A: This must be by now about December 1939.\nApril 22, 1994",
        "A: Maybe November. Because I don\u2019t remember snow yet. I think it might have\nbeen November still.",
        "A: Yeah, the first group left.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t particularly remember it as being upsetting, because there wasn\u2019t that\nmuch time to be upset or not upset, because very soon, maybe on the next day, we\nlearned that they had been captured on the border. So, we never followed. So I \u2014\nthat was upsetting, because I remember my mother crying and that was very\nupsetting, yes. And also the \u2014 the \u2014 the idea that my five year old brother was now\nin jail with my father and \u2014 and she didn\u2019t know where and how and so on. We her\n\u2014 we learned from the guy that that\u2019s what had happened, or [indecipherable] I\ndon\u2019t \u2014 I wasn\u2019t there when she learned about it, but \u2014 or at least I don\u2019t remember,\nbut I remember her crying, and it was quite awful.",
        "A: And then what happened was that she tried to contact the Russian authorities to\nsee if she could see my father, or at least her goal was to pick up my little brother\nfrom jail. So she tried, how she tried I don\u2019t know, she must have gone there and\npleaded with them. I wasn\u2019t with her, she left me at home \u2014 at home, I don\u2019t know,\nwith the landlady or something, I don\u2019t remember that part. [break] And then she\nwas able to \u2014 they told her that \u2014 that they would release my brother, and she should\ncome and pick him up.",
        "A: Very close, because this town was on the border. So it\u2019s very possible that he\nwas in jail right in that town, that they brought him from \u2014 the few kilometers from\nthe border back there, I don\u2019t know, I never saw him. But my mother went and\nbrought my brother bra \u2014 back. So then she had both of us, but my father was in jail\nand she had no contact with him. And then she decided to go \u2014 to go and join her\nown family, and they were in Zwatruf(ph), and by her own family I mean her\nparents and her older sister and my uncle, meaning her brother, and his wife and\nthree children. And her sister\u2019s two children. Eventually we ended up being 14\npeople. And they had an apartment or some way of living in \u2014 in this town called\nZwatruf(ph), and we joined them there.\nApril 22, 1994",
        "A: And \u2014 don\u2019t remember. I imagine we either took a train \u2014 probably a train, but I\ndo not remember. All I remember 1s that they were all very, very nice to us, and that\nwe lived there with them, and it was crowded, but it was peaceful and nice, for a\nshort time. And my uncle would go to Lwow, which was not too far away, a few\nhours away, I presume. And he would come occasionally, and he wa \u2014 got a job in\nLwow and he was making money. In other words, he was earning, he was the only\none who was earning and he had a job, and he had friends and connections, but he\nleft his family, his parents and so on in this place, and we were with them.",
        "A: No, no, I don\u2019t remember anything.",
        "A: He either didn\u2019t, or he may have talked about it like a five year old would, and I\ndon\u2019t remember what he said, or I don\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: There we were, this big group, and then \u2014 and we did not go to school any more\non the \u2014 I, or an \u2014 my cousins. And then one night there was a big commotion,\nyelling and screaming and banging and that\u2019s when the Russians came with \u2014 with \u2014\nwhat do they call it, the trucks, and they loaded us on trucks and took us to the\nApril 22, 1994\ntrains, and deported us. I do remember \u2014 I'll go back a little bit \u2014 during the time\nwhen we were there with our big family group, there was a lot of discussion\nwhether to take Russian citizenship or not. The Russians offered passports to all the\npeople who had fled from western Poland into eastern Poland, they could become\nRussian citizens. There was a lot of discussion because one didn\u2019t know whether to\ndo that or not to, because if you did that, it seemed to us \u2014 at least that\u2019s what the\ngrownups were saying, then we would never, ever have a chance of leaving what\nwas occupied Russian territory, or Russia itself, because we were Russian citizens.\nSo that was sort of giving up. On the other hand, the risk of remaining with the\nPolish passports, which we had, was that then we would be treated badly, possibly\ndeported. There were talks about deportations to Siberia, and that was a different\nrisk, but I know that we did not take the Russian passports because we thought that\nwas like abdicating altogether. So we were deported, all 14 of us.",
        "A: That I remember. That I already \u2014 there I have vivid memories. It was \u2014 it was\ncargo cars or cattle cars, and we were 70 people in one of them, in each one of\nthem. And \u2014 and the conditions were very, very bad. There was one in the center of\nthis big cattle car, there was one pipe which was the toilet, and it wasn\u2019t even\ncovered or \u2014 or \u2014 or separated. So I remember that some people gave some blankets\nApril 22, 1994\nor spreads or sheets, I don\u2019t remember, and those were somehow hung up there and\nmy mother was rather witty, kept saying she could tell exactly from the feet as to\nwho was in there, and that was a big \u2014 with the children, for us it was a sort of a\ngame about guessing who was in there. But I remember that very distinctly. And the\ntrain would stop quite often and then the Russians would come in and they didn\u2019t\nmistreat us or anything, they didn\u2019t even come in. They would open the door and\nfrom the platform they would hand us the food. They brought big pots with \u2014 and\nmostly it was soup, I remember, some sort of soup. It was not great, but they did\nbring it twice a day over there. And also, we used to stop a great deal and it took us\n\u2014 we went all the way to \u2014 very far, we were deported all the way to \u2014 yeah,\nKutskaya Oblast, which was near Yakutsk which is almost as far as you can go\nwithout going to Manchuria, I guess. And it took us six weeks to get there. So we\ntra \u2014 but six weeks with a great number of stops, because they did stop all the time,\nthey stopped at different stations, I imagine when they needed the tracks they would\nput us on a side track, but I know we stopped a lot.",
        "A: Yes, yes. All the families were together. And one additional thing that I\nremember from that trip was that my brother got scarlet fever during that trip. And\nApril 22, 1994\nhe was very sick, then my cousin got it. And they tried to isolate them in one corner\nof this car, and my mother was going \u2014 absolutely falling apart, because \u2014 I mean,\nshe was brave, but she was carrying on quite a bit because he was so sick. And there\nwas even a doctor in another car who came, and my mother used to tell much later\nthat he said it would take a miracle for my brother to survive, because he was\nsupposed to be on a salt free diet, or whatever one does with scarlet fever. And he\nwas quite sick. He was very sick. And so we were families together, yes; men,\nwomen and children.",
        "A: On the floor, there were \u2014 and suitcases.",
        "A: On the suitcases, yes. And then things were spread on the floor to \u2014 to make\nsleeping \u2014 to make sleeping possible.",
        "A: Yes, we were able to sort of, like sardines, one next to the other, we \u2014 we had \u2014 I\nremember sleeping, yes.",
        "A: There was some light from the windows, which were high up. There must have\nbeen light because I remember that my mother, to keep us busy, this is one of the\nApril 22, 1994\ngreat things she did, the girls, she taught me how to darn socks on that trip. And\nwhen we ran out of socks with holes, I remember she made holes in socks and then\nI darned them over and over again. And I became very proficient at it, so I \u2014 there\nmust have been light, to do that.",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t remember that \u2014 anything like that.",
        "A: The only amusing incident I remember from that trip, I mean, there were many,\nthat as strange as it seems in all these horrible situations there was always\nsomething humorous. And I remember that when we stopped in all the different \u2014 in\nall the different, I presume small towns or wherever we stopped, there was\ninevitably an enormous statue of Stalin and Lenin on the platform, and they were\nusually life-size. And one day we stopped at dusk, and usually when we stopped,\nsomebody, very often my mother, would climb up on two or three suitcases to reach\nthe little window, that\u2019s how I remember they were high up, and try to get \u2014 ask the\npassersby to give us some food or anything. Water, food, whatever we were wa \u2014 sh\n\u2014 literally begging. And one day she was sa \u2014 she turned around and said to\neverybody, well today we are sure to get what I asked for. Says, do you know who I\njust spoke to? I spoke to Stalin in person. It was \u2014 she was talking to this\nApril 22, 1994\n[indecipherable] and suddenly she realized that it was one of the statues. So\nanyway, often these peasants did hand something over, and she learned a few words\nof Russian, laybeonki(ph) being children, and you know, I remember her always\nsaying about the children. I always felt that like, that we were the \u2014 the cause of all\nevil, because th \u2014 we were used for \u2014 for that kind of begging. Like we were the\nonly reason why she \u2014 she did it.",
        "A: I remember arguments about space. I do remember arguments about, you know,\nth \u2014 particularly when my brother got sick and they \u2014 my \u2014 my mother and \u2014 and\nthen later, a few days later, my cousin got sick, and there were arguments even\nabout \u2014 between my mother an-an-and the mother of this cousin, and \u2014 who was her\nsister-in-law, about \u2014 because I guess everybody was so anxious. And I remember\nwhen they wanted to isolate the sick children, they had to \u2014 needed space from\nanother family, so they displaced them a little, and tried to tell them the space here\nwas just as good, whatever was left when they moved the other children. There\nwere arguments about space, definitely. That I remember. On \u2014 in other ways, I\nthink there was also support. It wasn\u2019t a constant argument, but there was tension\nabout space, physical space.\nApril 22, 1994",
        "A: No, no, no.",

        "A: It was \u2014 I don\u2019t remember it as being cold or anything, because we were\ndeported, I think in June. I do remember that I turned eight in \u2014 when \u2014 after, right\nafter we arrived in Siberia. So we must have arrived around August. And there it\nwas very, very hot, because they have a short, hot summer.",

        "A: No, I wa\u2014I-\u2014no, I don\u2019t think at that point \u2014 there was a lot of talk people trying\nto escape, and I do remember that later on when we were already settled in Siberia,\nbut not from the train, I don\u2019t remember that, no.",
        "A: Not that Iam aware of, no, no, I don\u2019t remember. I remember differences in\npeople close to me. I remember my mother se \u2014 actions and attitudes were very\nApril 22, 1994\ndifferent from my aunt\u2019s actions and attitude. Some people despaired. There was a\nlot of despair and crying and so on. My mother did not succumb to that, and I\nremember thinking that she was different, because she really did not do that. She \u2014\nshe was much more resourceful, and much more \u2014 well, she used her charm, her\nintelligence, she was very clever, and so on, to \u2014 to achieve something, to gain\nthings for herself and for us, but mainly for us, so \u2014 mainly for my brother was sick.\nBut \u2014 and the others sort of just despaired. Also, there was a lot of talk like we\u2019ll\nnever get out of here, and this is the end, and my mother arguing that this is not so,\nthat it\u2019s not the end because we really don\u2019t know what \u2014 that the \u2014 you know, she\ndidn\u2019t give in to that.",

No, I don\u2019t even remember being \u2014 I\nremember being very crowded, but I don\u2019t remember being very uncomfortable. I\ndon\u2019t remember, you know, any physical pain or anything like that, no.",
        "A: No.\nApril 22, 1994",
        "A: I think that the food came fairly regularly, and my mother probably gave us\nenough, because I remember that people did say that they were hungry. But I think\nshe again made sure that \u2014 that I had enough. I was not hungry.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: We were not cold, no, no \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 no, and we were crowded, so it wasn\u2019t cold, no.",
        "A: Yes, and we had absolutely, after my mother picked up my brother, she had no\nmore contact, no \u2014 nor did we have any knowledge whether he \u2014 what happened to\nhim. And that was something I do remember, because she talked about that a lot,\nthat we didn\u2019t know whether he was dead or alive, or that he was in jail, where he\nwas, nothing. Absolutely nothing. And she talked a lot about that.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know whether we missed him. I guess, yes, I think that th-the uncertainty,\nth-the insecurity that he was gone, and her despair over that. That was the only time\nshe showed despair was when she talked about not knowing what happened to him.\nApril 22, 1994\nSo that, I think affected us more than the \u2014 just that he wasn\u2019t there. Again, I must\nemphasize that we didn\u2019t see that much of our parents when we were very young,\ncause he was not, you know, a father like today. He was a father was in the office,\nwho came in maybe a few minutes before we went to sleep. So I really didn\u2019t \u2014 he\nwas not directly involved in our care, daily lives, so I don\u2019t, you know, it wasn\u2019t\n[inaudible]",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes, it seemed endless. Yes, it seemed like a very long time, endless, yeah, that\nit seemed. And also, you must remember that we had absolutely no idea as to where\nwe are being taken. So we didn\u2019t know whether it would take one week, six weeks,\nfour weeks, and also where our final destination was we had no idea, so it was just\ngoing and going and going. Nobody knew where we were going.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: No, no, no, no problem. They brought the food and left.\nApril 22, 1994",
        "A: Finally we arrived, and it was very hot there, I remember that, and there was a\nlot of like wheat, or very tall grass where we arrived. It was like fields and forests.\nWe were actually in the middle of the Taiga, which are these enormous forests in\nRussia, and \u2014 in Siberia. And there were barracks, we did not have to build our\nown. There was like a settlement there waiting for us.",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: I do remember that \u2014 that it was wonderful to get out.",
        "A: Yes, it was wonderful, and I remember being very impressed with this tall grass,\nwhich was very tall, it was almost as tall as I was. And then we walked through this\ngrass, and then there were these houses, which I remember seeing, they were like\nhuts, and there were like 10 or 12 or 15 maybe of them, I don\u2019t know how many.\nAnd there was a central one where we all had to go and line up, and they assigned\nthese houses. And I remember that my mother was very anxious for this whole\nfamily, we were 14 people, our family, to get our own house. And most of these\nhouses housed between 16 or 20 people. And her big accomplishment was that we\ndid get one of these houses just for us.\nApril 22, 1994",
        "A: Mine was fine.",
        "A: My brother was better by then, but very, very weak, and very emaciated. And \u2014\nbut he was better, he was no longer critical, and his fever, I think, had gone by then.\nAnd my health was fine.",
        "A: Yes, there were \u2014",
        "A: Yes, there were many children. There were many children, and after we all got\nsettled, and this I remember also very distinctly, after they allocated these different\nhuts to different \u2014 to \u2014 to all these people, and everybody was more or less settled,\nthey \u2014 you had to register again for work. The adults had to register for work, and\nthe children had to register for school. And there were many children, but they were\n\u2014 it seemed that they didn\u2019t have enough children who belonged into second grade,\nwhich was where I should have gone. And I knew by then how to read and write a\nlittle, because I had learned \u2014 three months I was in the \u2014 1n that school, and maybe\nI learned on my \u2014 by myself, or whatever, but \u2014 but I didn\u2019t know Russian, of\ncourse. Now this school was going to be in Russian, and I remember that I \u2014 they\nApril 22, 1994\nhad a first grade and a third grade, or enough children to \u2014 for those age groups, and\nthey were in the \u2014 somehow in the same room, there was the \u2014 why they had them\nin the same room, I guess they didn\u2019t have enough teachers, or they didn\u2019t have\nenough children, and I remember that they were \u2014 and I was in first grade. And with\na \u2014 that was one of the things that they did very quickly. I remember we barely got\nthere and we \u2014 and they made us go to school, and they made the adults work. And\nwe all got like an I.D. card. The children got them and the working adults. And\nunless you had that, you could not buy food. By then you were buying food, they\nhad like a dispensary. But you had to show your I.D. work card or school card to\nget your rations. You couldn\u2019t just come with rubles and buy it.",
        "A: From working. They were compensated, yes.",
        "A: They got paid, yes.",
        "A: That I remember very well, too, because they were \u2014 it was called a pritcha(ph).\nIt was a \u2014 like a bunk made out of wood, and it was right above the floor, and it was\nlong. It was on the floor, and it was made out of boards. And so we, all 14 of us,\nslept on this one long thing, and it was very tight. And so, when I remember that\nApril 22, 1994\nwhen one person turned, everybody turned. And to this day I can\u2019t stand sleeping\nwith anybody, because it just \u2014 I can\u2019t sleep when somebody keeps turning, because\nI turn too. So that was terrible. The sleeping arrangements were very, very tight.\nVery tight.",
        "A: We had some food. We had some food and \u2014 but not adequate food, there were\nshortages of \u2014 there were no \u2014 no vegetables. People started getting scurvy, people\nstarted getting all kinds of \u2014 because they were deficient in \u2014 in so many foods. But\nwe didn\u2019t have \u2014 and we were not starving, but we didn\u2019t have adequate food. But\nvery soon after we arrived there, we started getting food parcels, because \u2014 I have to\nbacktrack. My uncle was not deported. He was the only one of my mother\u2019s family,\nbecause he was working in Lwow, as I had said before, and he was not home that\nnight. So he was not deported. And he, when he heard that his whole family was\ndeported, his three children, his parents, his sisters, and his wife, he wanted to run\nafter the train. He thought he would go and run after the train. And his friends in\nLwow told him this was stupid \u2014 a stupid thing to do because you would get on\nsome train \u2014 if you go there, to the station, they\u2019ll deport you, but by no means will\nyou be on the same train. You may never find them. If you stay in Lw\u00e9w, you may\nbe able to help them, but this way it \u2014 1t \u2014 1t would be ludicrous. So he stayed. And\nApril 22, 1994\nhe had a very good job with the Russians, and so he made money and he sent\nparcels to us. How he knew where we were, I don\u2019t know, but he did \u2014 we got the\nparcels. We were [phone ringing- break] So we got the parcels \u2014 as a matter of\nfact, I don\u2019t \u2014 it \u2014 it still 1s a puzzle to me how he knew where he was, or whether\nhe just sent them by name to Siberia and by mira-miracle we got them, but we did\nget them. And I remember that he sent sugar and fat and tea and coffee and things\nlike that. I remember particularly the sugar and the fat.",
        "A: And that\u2019s an interesting story too. The fat was some kind of lard or chicken fat.\nAnd the problem with that was that my grandmother was still very religious. And\nmy uncle, who was not religious any more, and who was a very clever and shrewd\nkind of person, and a very good son and \u2014 and father, and very family-minded, he\nwanted the worst way, because he knew what the conditions there were, that we\nshould all eat this, particularly his mother. And so he himself certified it. And so\nwhat it was, it was he \u2014 after the war he told me that it was just at first he c-couldn\u2019t\nget any kosher fat, and then he just certified it himself. So 1t was different kinds of\nlards, whatever he could get. Goose fat, chicken fat, maybe lard. I don\u2019t know,\nwhatever. And it came, and \u2014\nApril 22, 1994",
        "A: No, it did not have a specific name, it was a \u2014 I wouldn\u2019t even call it a camp, it\nwas a \u2014 it was a work settlement, it was a \u2014 it was a settlement. They had deportees\nin Siberia fra \u2014 during the \u2014 the \u2014 the purges that they did during Tsar\u2019s time. There\nwere deportees there in the nearest town, who had been deported 11 years before, as\nI remember the number exactly because it always se \u2014 stuck in my mind. And these\npeople had been there for \u2014 political deportees, who had no way of ever getting out,\nat least they thought, and they kept telling us that we would also remain \u2014 these\nwere work settlements \u2014 that we would also remain there forever, because whenever\nwe said well, you know, maybe someday we\u2019ll get out, or after the war, or\nsomething, they used to tell us there\u2019s no hope. So there were \u2014 there were different\n\u2014 this area had been populated by different deportees over the years, just like when I\nwas Yakutsk in nine \u2014 four years, five years ago. They had a lot of deportees from\nthe Tsar\u2019s time, who now are several generations later, and they just stayed there. It\ncould have happened to us, thank God it didn\u2019t.",
        "A: Oh, I learned how to read and write in Russian. And also they had a very \u2014 I\nremember that they had a very strong program of indoctrination of \u2014 Stalin was our\nhero, he was our father, he \u2014 around Christmastime they asked us to pray to God for\ncandy, and we did, and nothing happened of course. And then they asked us to ask\nApril 22, 1994\nStalin, whose portrait was right in front of course, and we got candy. It was the\nonly time we got candy, it was that kind of atmosphere. And it was always glory,\nthe glory of Russia and the glory of Stalin, the glory of communism. That was all\nthe reading material and all of that \u2014 that was what we learned in school, but mainly\nto read and write.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember the school as being unpleasant. I do remember \u2014 I \u2014 I\nremember being \u2014 it was difficult, because we had to walk one kilometer. Took us\nabout 10 or 15 minutes, and when it got cold \u2014 because once the snow falls there, it\nnever melts, it \u2014 and they \u2014 we \u2014 they dug like a little trail, and on either side there\nwere banks of the snow, which was tall as I was. And we all got what\u2019s called\nvalenkis, the children got, they were boots made out of a heavy felt. And they\nallocated those for children to go to school in, and I remember walking that\ndistance.",
        "A: I learned how to read and write, and I don\u2019t think it was divided by subjects, I\nthink it was just mainly the glory of Russia and reading and writing, that\u2019s all I\nremember of that.\nApril 22, 1994",
        "A: I imagine we played in the snow and it was not terrib \u2014 I don\u2019t remember\nanything for pleasure. Stories, being home, games, running around. Nothing in\nparticular. I mean, nothing organized, or \u2014",
        "A: There were also jackets.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: They allocated \u2014 for children, they gave us those lined or interlined jackets and \u2014\nFufaikas, they were called, and working people also got those.",
        "A: They \u2014 in the forest, in the Taiga, women \u2014 men cut branches and trees \u2014 it was\ncleaning the Taiga. It was cleaning the forest. Men cut the branches and the dead\nbranches, and women gathered them and carried them to \u2014 to central sort of spots\nwhere they were burned. So it was to clean out the undergrowth. It was heavy work,\nit was hard work, because you had to carry the branches, and then \u2014 it was hard,\nphysical work. My mother, strangely enough, was very, very pampered and spoiled,\nsaid she, physically she felt very well the \u2014\nEnd of Tape One\nJanuary 5, 1996\nBeginning Tape Two",
        "A: We got off the train and sort of a \u2014 in the middle of nowhere, and then I\nremember seeing the huts, and then there was a bit of a scramble among the\npeople, who is going to get which hut. And as we were a group of 14 people, same\nfamily, we did \u2014 we managed to get one hut just for our family, and that I\nremember as being something that everybody thought was a very positive thing.",
        "A: In the beginning there was utter confusion. We had to like register, we had to\nget our food cards. And they told us that we would go to school, children would go\nto school and they\u2019re go \u2014 and the adults would go to work. And then there was\nque \u2014 they talked a lot about what type of work and everybody was sort of \u2014 1t was\nalso a new experience for all of us to have to work. I mean, my mother never\nworked a day in her life, and ma \u2014 and most other women certainly didn\u2019t, and the\ntype of work that they had was heavy, physical work. But the early work was\nactually cutting the \u2014 what was it, the grass. It was tall grass that they cut and they\ngave us these sickles, that\u2019s wha \u2014 th-the \u2014 like knives. And all \u2014 that\u2019s what the\nJanuary 5, 1996\nfirst work was. The children did not do it, we did not do it, the adults did it. And\nthey gathered it and tied it, and it was still very hot when we got there in August, it\nwas very, very hot. It\u2019s a short summer. Soon after that, the typical day was going\nto school. And they did not have enough children to have a second grade, which I\nshould have gone to, cause I already knew how to read and write in Polish, and I\nwas eight years old. So \u2014 but they only had enough children for a first grade and\nfor a third grade, so I was in the first grade, and we started learning Russian. And\nschool was important. They did m-make it absolutely clear that we had to go to\nschool in order to get our food, and school was important, and they were rather\nnice to us in school. The teacher was nice, and they kept telling us about, you\nknow, Stalin and how he was going to take care of us, and how we are going to\nget presents from him, and actually when Christmas came around, they told us that\nwe should pray for candy, and of course we didn\u2019t get any and then we should ask\nStalin and the candy appeared. She distributed it and so on. Actually, this\nparticular incident was very well portrayed in the film \u2014 what was it called?\n\u201cEuropa Europa.\u201d Exactly he had the identical thing happen to him that I\nremember very vividly, the same conversation in school. Anyway, so our typical\ndays, wet \u2014 it very soon got very cold. There\u2019s very \u2014 there\u2019s practically no\ntransition. We started having the first snow by end of September, beginning of\nOctober, and that snow never, ever melts. So when we were walking to school, we\nJanuary 5, 1996\nwere walking like in a \u2014 in a ditch, and on both sides there were these walls of\nsnow that were as tall as I was. It was cut out, so that if walked in, an-and that\nsnow never, ever melted, so \u2014 until the next spring, obviously. And the grown-ups\nwent off and did whatever they were doing, I didn\u2019t see them. And the thing was\nto get some of the wood for us to make fire in the hut. My grandmother sort of\ncooked something. I don\u2019t remember ever being really hungry. We did have some\nfood, and so I don\u2019t remember ever being really hungry. I do remember going to\nthe store and getting \u2014 with those ration cards and getting our allocations. And\nthey were mostly some sort of staples, I think. Certainly no vegetables, no \u2014 no\nfood, no nothing, so that was bad, because we were very deprived of \u2014 of vitamins\nand \u2014 and that kind of nutrition. There was a little town not far away, where from\ntime to time people were summoned for various reasons, and there was always a\ngreat deal of trepidation and fear attached to that, because you didn\u2019t know \u2014 it\nwas usually somebody that they either wanted to recruit for some other work, or it\nwas some oth \u2014 or they suspected somebody of being what they called the\nbourgoi(ph) you know, before the war, and they wanted to look into it. Two\nyoung people from the settlement tried to run away to \u2014 to the Manchurian border,\nwe were not far from Manchuria. It\u2019s pretty far out there. So, a-and they either\nwere caught, or they were \u2014 there was some mystery. I mean, I was only eight\nyears old, but I remember the excitement that thi \u2014 were they caught, weren\u2019t they\nJanuary 5, 1996\ncaught, did they freeze to death, didn\u2019t they freeze to death. But when they were\nmissing, th-th-th-th-the NK VD, which then became the [indecipherable] who\ncame around and asked questions, you know, the Russian secret service, or\nwhatever they were. The police. So there was some contact to \u2014 to that little city,\nwhich was not far away. It was called Auga(ph). And so, the typical day was just,\ngo to work or go to school and eat and sleep. Were a lot of bedbugs, that was a\nterrible pest, and other than that I can\u2019t really remember that much, except big\ndiscussions inside with my \u2014 I had one of my cousins was already 15 years old,\nand he had been quite a good student before the war, and he knew quite a bit of\nhistory, and his sort of view of the situation was that we\u2019ll never get out of there.\nThis is where the Russians send their political enemies, have done so during Tsar\u2019s\ntime and have done so, you know, during the purges, and are doing it now. And\nnone of these people ever get out. And of course my view of history was limited,\nbut I do remember arguments because my mother particularly said you can\u2019t take\nthat kind of point of view, and it doesn\u2019t have necessary to be like that, and we\nwill get out, it\u2019s different. There\u2019s a war and they will be defeated at some point,\nand things will change. Anyway, those discussions I do remember, and I\nremember him saying there\u2019s a Polish saying that these are dreams of a severed\nhead. So, whenever my mother would hold out these optimistic speeches, he\nJanuary 5, 1996\nwould say, these are dreams of a severed head. So that\u2019s what I remember from\nthere.",
        "A: She \u2014 it was not a stupid optimism, she was very clever, and sophisticated\nwoman, who lived in various places in Europe and so on. I don\u2019t know whether it\nwas just a sort of simplistic optimism, it was the kind of optimism that she had\nthroughout the war later, in much worse circumstances, where she felt that we\nwould survive. And it wasn\u2019t the rosy kind of optimism, it was just her kind of\nfeeling that we would survive. And she was very good \u2014 I now understand it better\nthan I did then, in \u2014 in making us believe it, that I always believed, I \u2014 later on\nalso, that we would survive. And that she had this way of making us feel very\nimportant and very special, because of pre-war connections, because of her\nexperience before the war, because of the way \u2014 because of who my father was. I\nsee it all as \u2014 now as \u2014 not as significant as she thought it was, but it helped\nsurvive the war, so I can\u2019t even fault her. When I became a little older I started\nthinking that maybe she\u2019s exaggerating. But 1t worked.\nJanuary 5, 1996",

So it was sort\nof all invented, and it was more in the center \u2014 there was a room in the center of\nthat hut, and we sort of played there. It\u2019s hard to say exactly what we did.",

        "A: Oh yeah, exactly. And you washed first the bottom and the top or vice-a-versa,\nyes, in the kitchen, when it was warm. And it didn\u2019t happen certainly, every day.\nThere was no bathroom.",
        "A: Outside, outside.",
        "A: An outhouse.\nJanuary 5, 1996",
        "A: An outhouse, or \u2014 or you just went anywhere, because it all froze anyway, right\naway, so there was no problem with that. But it was an outhouse. Very cold going\nout. No bathroom inside.",
        "A: Well, there\u2019s an interesting story actually. Both our governess and my cousin\u2019s\ngoverness was deported with us, because they happened to have been with us\nwhen they were \u2014 they still were with us when \u2014 when we got deported. And that\nwas actually interesting, because as soon as we got to Siberia, they were working\ngirls, so they thought that they deserved different conditions from us. They were\nnot capitalists. And particularly my \u2014 my \u2014 our governess apparently was a very si\n\u2014 was a bit of a communist and a socially conscious person, and she \u2014 sh \u2014 they\nleft. The two gir \u2014 the two young women left us, they lived someplace else. One of\nthem I later found out had some sort of a relationship with some local one of the\nguards or something. And one of them apparently did get married there and stayed\nthere and never left Russia. So these were two young girls, and so anyhow, they\nsort of evaporated after we got there, with some bad feelings, because both my\nJanuary 5, 1996\naunt and my mother thought they weren\u2019t very loyal, but they saw this as maybe\nsome sort of an opportunity of not being, you know, employed by these people any\nmore. So I don\u2019t think my \u2014 my mother could pay. It would have been \u2014 if they\nhad stayed it would have been more out of loyalty, and apparently that did not\nhappen.",
        "A: Very much, very much so. But I think it\u2019s a little bit like \u2014 like \u2014 from what I\nremember, it was more like in a kibbutz, you know? The chil \u2014 everybody was\ntogether, so it was not only my mother who told us what to do, but my aunt and\nmy grandmother, I mean ev-everybody was telling the children what to do. My \u2014\nmy mother was \u2014 my \u2014 the relationship was good, except that she always was very\nconcerned about my brother, who was younger, and who was very \u2014 somewhat\nsickly. And my \u2014 my aunt, my two cousins\u2019 mother was very, very strict. So I felt\nsort of very privileged because my mother was not very strict. And \u2014 not strict at\nall, as a matter of fact, she was not a disciplinarian and she \u2014 we had it \u2014 we had a\ngood relationship. It was only difficult to watch her because she was terribly\nconcerned and nervous about what happened to \u2014 to my father, and there was a\nconstant sort of tension. I almost sometimes had the feeling that you know, if th \u2014\nJanuary 5, 1996\nit\u2019s no use talking about it all the time, that whatever happens, happens, you know.\nIt was oppressive to hear about that all the time. And but otherwise I \u2014",
        "A: Yes, she \u2014 she was in some way resourceful. What she did was each time there\nwas an opportunity to talk to one of the Russian guards, which was at work, and\nthis she told us in the evening about, or when she got her ration cards, or when she\n\u2014 whenever there was some contact, she would ask. Of course, these people were\nminor. Today I see how minor they were. These were minor guards and they had\nno idea what happened, you know, 3,000 kilometers back east, to my father. So it\nwas sort of useless. I thought even at eight that she\u2019s being a terrible nuisance to\nthem. But she did do that all the time. And as a matter of fact, she \u2014 she was once\ncalled, I don\u2019t know why, she was called either because of work, or because of\nsome ration cards, or because of some permits to go to the city, I don\u2019t know, she\nwas called to the encava \u2014 the office, and she went there, and as usual she com \u2014\ntold them that \u2014 about my father, and she tried to evoke some pity in them. And\nthere was a large age difference between my parents and so she said he \u2014 you\nknow that she \u2014 first of all she didn\u2019t want to say that he owned the bank, because\nthat \u2014 you know. So she \u2014 but she said that he\u2019s older and that he 1s sickly and that\nshe\u2019s terribly worried about him and so on. And then this official asked her, what\ndid he do? So she said well, he was a bank clerk. So he said, so what are you so\nJanuary 5, 1996\nupset about? You are young and you are beautiful and you\u2019ll \u2014 we have lots of\nbank clerks in Russia and you\u2019ll find a young one that he won\u2019t be sick. So don\u2019t\nbe so upset. So she came home and told that story in very \u2014 1t was very funny the\nway she told it. And so I know that she was constantly doing that. It didn\u2019t help\nterribly much, but she was doing it.",
        "A: Snow. Lots and lots of snow. No smells, no sights, we didn\u2019t go anywhere, it\nwas just the snow in hut and the little narrow walkway to the school and from the\nschool, and that\u2019s all I remember from that. And the schoolroom was pleasant and\nwarm, that I remember, that it was pleasant and warm.",
        "A: This routine went on until about April. It started in September, October, soon\nas we got \u2014",
        "A: April 1941, right. And in April she was \u2014 my mother was summoned by them,\nand told that if she wanted to, she could leave, she could go back to Poland with\nthe two children. And of course, she couldn\u2019t believe her ears, I mean, sh-she\ncouldn\u2019t believe that they were saying that, and she thought it was some sort of a \u2014\nof a plan to trick her to \u2014 to \u2014 she just couldn\u2019t believe it, no one had been set free.\nAnd so she said she just listened to them, and then she said, how will I go back, I\nJanuary 5, 1996\ndon\u2019t \u2014 you know, I don\u2019t have money to buy a ticket, I don\u2019t \u2014 you know, how do\nI go \u2014 so they said, why don\u2019t you ask your brother to send you money to get a\u2014\nto buy the ticket for the transiber \u2014 she had to buy a ticket for the Trans-Siberia\nrailroad, which went from Vladivostok all the way down \u2014 back to \u2014 to Moscow.\nBut \u2014 and then we still were a day, or many hours by horse and buggy away from\nthat last station. But anyway, so she said she was afraid that they were trying to\ntrick her into saying that my uncle had the money to buy it. So she didn\u2019t \u2014 so she\nsaid, I don\u2019t know \u2014 he doesn\u2019t have that kind of money to buy the ticket. So he s\n\u2014 so this guard said to her, okay, so if he doesn\u2019t send you a ticket, then you won\u2019t\ngo back. So at that point she thought maybe she was overplaying her cards here, so\nshe said, okay, she\u2019ll write to him and he\u2019ll make a collection among his friends.\nAnd at that point the guard apparently got upset and said, in Russia we don\u2019t make\ncollections. His honor was hurt. So she said, well, I\u2019ll write to him and see\nwhatever he wants to do. And she got out of that one, and actually when she did\nwrite that they said that \u2014 that we could leave, but she needed the money for the\npassage and so on, he thought also that 1t was some sort of a trick. And he asked\nher for her password. He asked her the name of a cousin that they had actually\nhere in America, who had left Poland in the early 20s, or whatever, her first\nname. And when she gave that \u2014 when she wrote it back, he did send the money.\nAnd at that point, she went with the money and she was told that we could leave,\nJanuary 5, 1996\nand we left in May. We \u2014 we went to the train, just my brother and \u2014 and she \u2014 and\nmy mother and I, and we went to \u2014 to \u2014 they provided us with transportation from\nwhere we were, to the end station. And I remember that trip very clearly because\nwe had to wait overnight in \u2014 at this train station, which also was not very\npleasant, it was very cold.",
        "A: I was very, very excited, and I didn\u2019t know \u2014 I had the same feeling she had,\nthat we were afraid, because everybody, her parents and my aunt and the rest of\nthe family said, who knows where they\u2019re taking you? Who knows why they\u2019re\nsingling you out? Who knows what they\u2019 Il do to you? And my mother\u2019s answer\nwas, that if they wanted \u2014 and which was very clever, if they wanted to do\nsomething to her, or what \u2014 then they didn\u2019t have to \u2014 to put on this whole act,\nthey could do it right here, they could just take her away and do it. So they didn\u2019t\nhave to have this whole production. Therefore, she did trust that this is legitimate,\nthat they want to send us back for some reason that she couldn\u2019t figure out. And of\ncourse, neither could I. And I remember just that we were ta \u2014 you know, people \u2014\npeople in general, other people; there were friends, and people she worked with,\nand everybody came to say goodbye to us, but there was a lot of, you know,\nshould she go, shouldn\u2019t she go there for \u2014 for \u2014 for weeks, I remember these\nJanuary 5, 1996\ndiscussions, should she go, shouldn\u2019t she go. And she decided she wanted to go\nand you know, and \u2014 did I \u2014",
        "A: No, she was rather independent and she \u2014 I would say no. I think she \u2014 she\ntrusted \u2014 she loved her brother, so she knew she was going to him. She knew she\nwas going back to Europe. She knew, you know, that it was going to be less cold\nand less miserable, and she wouldn\u2019t be loo \u2014 so in other words, she knew \u2014 she\nfelt that it was going to be better, whatever it is, 1t\u2019s going to be better. And\ncertainly better for us children, particularly for my brother.",
        "A: Oh yeah. My mother was not \u2014 how shall I say? She was not that attached to\nher family. She had married, lived abroad and it\u2019s not that she didn\u2019t like them, but\nshe felt that \u2014 that this was something that she \u2014",
        "A: Yes, absolutely, and she was not the clinging type, no, absolutely not.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t remember saying anything, no. Just goodbye and should \u2014 how\nshould I say? I was glad to be rid of my aunt, I really was. What else? My\nJanuary 5, 1996\ngrandmother was very quiet, my grandfather \u2014 no, I don\u2019t remember saying\nanything, no, mm-mm, no.",
        "A: Whatever we were wearing. We didn\u2019t have anything to take with us. By then\nwe had nothing, you know, precious or anything. No, I don\u2019t remember \u2014 all \u2014 all I\nremember is that she always watched very carefully her \u2014 the identity, the papers.\nThe papers were very important, you know, th-the \u2014 the \u2014 the permits, the various\npermits that she needed. She did have to go back several times to get all of the\npermits and the train tickets, and the \u2014 all of that I remember, there was constantly\ntalk about, you know, where to keep it and how to keep it to make sure she has it\nand all that, yeah.",
        "A: So now we\u2019re at the train station and the train arrived. We got on it and we had\na compartment, and in the compartment there were two \u2014 there were bunk beds,\nand there was a \u2014 this I also don\u2019t remember, my brother and I had a bunk\ndownstairs and there was another man in the compartment, who actually was with\nus the whole time. Whether he slept in that compartment or slept across in another\ncompartment, I don\u2019t somehow remember, but I do remember that he used to take\nme and my brother to the restaurant car and gave us \u2014 and bought us hot chocolate.\nAnd that to us was such a treat, you see, this is the kind of thing I do remember,\nJanuary 5, 1996\nthat he sought \u2014 and my mother suspected, later on when she used to talk about it,\nthat he was actually planted to sort of take care of us and, you know, planted by\nthem to \u2014 to \u2014 to be nice to us and also maybe to watch us. Not that we had any\nplace to go, we had no place she could have gone. But he was there for some\nstrange reason, he was there in a way that \u2014 that \u2014 that we couldn\u2019t make out why\nhe was there, and he was there \u2014 maybe he was just \u2014 maybe it \u2014 it wasn\u2019t so,\nmaybe he just traveled, and he happened to be a friendly guy, and \u2014 so there\u2019s na \u2014\nI don\u2019t know. But he sort of stayed around and the whole time \u2014 it\u2019s a long trip,\nit\u2019s 11 days. So \u2014 and then we got to Moscow.",
        "A: In Moscow.",
        "A: Sometimes on the platform we would just get off, because the \u2014 the \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 yes, th-th \u2014 because \u2014 the train was enormously comfortable. The beds were\nmade with linens, I mean, this was super luxury for us, super luxury. We got very\ngood food, decent food on the train and always hot water, what they called\nkipyatok. And then he would get us the hot chocolate. It was not bad, it was, by\nour standards this was top luxury. And when we got to Moscow we had to\ninterrupt the trip and I don\u2019t know if we had to wait for another train, but I know\nJanuary 5, 1996\nwhere \u2014 we had a few hours and he took us sightseeing. So he was, you know, he\ntook us \u2014 he \u2014 he had a horse and buggy. And in Kiev, because we passed through\nKiev also, and in Kiev \u2014 he was gone already, but we went \u2014 you know, he left in\nMoscow, he didn\u2019t continue with us. In Kiev my mother hired a horse and buggy,\nand we went around and she \u2014 she was very excited about being in Kiev, and she\nknew a lot about Kiev, and she was trying to show us the city, city is quite nice, by\nthe way. And \u2014 well, my only memory from there is that as we were riding, they \u2014\nmy brother noticed a broken egg on the street, and he started yelling, an egg, an\negg. And this egg sticks in my mind to this day. To him the whole city wasn\u2019t\nimportant, but that somebody could have dropped an actual egg and wasted it, was\nlike, you know \u2014 so I remember that ride in Kiev. What I remember most vividly\nis arriving in \u2014 in Lw\u00e9w, because when we arrived in Lwow my uncle was waiting\non the platform, and that I remember as being an enormously emotional reunion,\nbut really, I mean she was very, very excited and very happy, and I was too, I\nmean, you know, here we were, we had arrived and everything was all right, and\nso on. And I also remember that he helped us with the little bit of luggage we had.\nAnd he had a man with him, somebody who helped him, who I later found out was\nlike his, kind of manservant, who did lots of things for him also, in connection\nwith packing, antiques, and delivering things and so on. So he wasn\u2019t like a house\nservant, he was more like a helper. So he helped with the luggage. And we got 1-\nJanuary 5, 1996\ninto a taxi, we actually got into a car, and while we were going to \u2014 to, I imagine\nwhere he lived, because we were supposed to go to his, I guess to hi \u2014 he was\ntaking us to his house. While we were going there, my mother asked whether he\nhad heard something about my father, was the usual thing. And he said, as a matter\nof fact he had. And he said \u2014 and so mother started saying, is he all right, is he all\nright? And he said yes, actually, he\u2019s all right, he\u2019s well. And the whole ride was\nnot very long, must have been \u2014 I\u2019ve been back there since, it\u2019s a short distance,\nmust have been five or 10 minute ride. During those 10 minutes he prepared her\nthat my father was actually there. And when we got to the building, there was my\nfather standing and she fainted. My mother fainted, they had to carry her out, she\nscreamed. And that I remember very vividly, I remember that was very moving\nand very, you know, I mean so unexpected. And I hadn\u2019t seen my father in over a\nyear and a half or whatever it was, and it \u2014 and that was very exciting. And then\nwe went upstairs and they talked and talked and talked and talked. And that was it.\n[break]",
        "A: Right. And \u2014 and the reason he didn\u2019t come to the railroad station was because\n\u2014 my uncle and he had decided that it was very important to prepare her slowly,\nbut since the distance from the railroad station to his house was very short, so even\nJanuary 5, 1996\nthe slow preparation was not really slow enough, and the impact was enormous\nand she fainted and carried on, and so on. And then we went upstairs and I re \u2014 I\njust remember that they talked and talked and talked and talked. And that was \u2014\nthat was it. And then we found out that my father had \u2014 well, he had his own set\nof, you know, what he went through, but the reason we were set free was because\nthey \u2014 a relative here in New York had bought in Switzerland, or gotten in\nSwitzerland, Bolivian passports which were actually \u2014 they were almost genuine,\nthey were not completely false. They were issued by the consulate \u2014 the Bolivian\nconsulate in Zurich, which \u2014 they were not issued by the government of Bolivia.\nThey had booklets and they had stamps and the consuls very often did it for their\nown gain. And so \u2014 but they were more legitimate than the ones who were later\nprod \u2014 you know, manufactured right \u2014 right then in Poland and wherever. So,\nanyhow, he had gotten the \u2014 these Bolivian passports, and my father, while he was\nin jail, and he ha \u2014 was moved during the 18 months he was in jail, he was moved\nto 11 different jails. They move people constantly. And the interrogations started\nfrom \u2014 from the beginning in each particular jail. My father never knew whether it\nwas because they didn\u2019t have records, or whether it was a purposeful thing to\nexhaust people. Interrogations were always at night he told us, and the first few\njails he was treated terribly, and he really suffered hunger. And later \u2014 and he, on\nthe other hand, did something different which worked out well. He convinced\nJanuary 5, 1996\nthem that he was actually more important than he was. He tried \u2014 he did not play\nthe [indecipherable] because he thought that it wouldn\u2019t work anyway. He was a\nvery imposing, good-looking, tall man, and he spoke five languages fluently, was\neducated in Germany. And so he was a personality. And he was afraid that if he\ntried to tell them that \u2014 who he wasn\u2019t, they would find out who he was, and then\nthat would be worse. So he sort of even \u2014 he told them who he was, and he told\nthem that he had very good connections abroad. He did do some dealings with\nLehman Brothers here in America, he had some dealings with Bernard Baruch,\nhe did do that. Probably not as much as he told them, but \u2014 and they felt maybe\nthat it was worth saving him and sending him abroad. And so when he \u2014 they told\nmy father that if he wanted to contact his \u2014 his relatives and ask them to help him\nby sending in foreign papers, they would release him, and that\u2019s what happened.\nBut we didn\u2019t know anything about that in Siberia, so when these passports\narrived, they notif \u2014 they called my father one \u2014 by then he was in La Lubyanka.\nAt the end, the last three or four months he was at La Lubyanka. By the way, it\u2019s\na very luxurious prison. He had a beautiful room he told us, with Persian rugs, and\nthey treated him like a king. Wonderful food, he went out for a walk every day.\nThose were the people \u2014 you never knew in Russia what was going to happen \u2014\nthose were the people that they subsequently probably released. Anyhow, to make\na long story short, he said that they notified him one day that the passports had\nJanuary 5, 1996\narrived, and he would be able to leave whenever he felt like it. And at that point,\nhe said he wasn\u2019t going to leave until he found out what happened to us. Took\nthem three months to locate us. And three months later, I forgot to say, the first\ntime they called my mother, they asked her to give them a picture of herself and\nthe two children, and they didn\u2019t say why. And that picture took them a long time\nto send it from Siberia to Moscow, and it actually came to the Lubyanka and the\n\u2014 the inspector showed it to my father and said, is this your wife? We found her,\nwe know now where she is. And that\u2019s when they told us to go back, or sent us\nback. So there was some rhyme and reason to it, and that\u2019s when \u2014 and \u2014 and they\nreleased him, or he left on hi \u2014 of his own free will. He was \u2014 when \u2014 when they\ntold him that we got on the train. So that\u2019s how we were reunited, and we had now\nthese Bolivian passports. And we were supposed to leave on the 24\" of June,\n1941, and we were supposed to go all the way east again, via Japan to leave\nRussia, and to go to, presumably Bolivia at some point. But the 22\u2122 of June,\nGermany invaded Russia, and so we never made it. We had everything, we \u2014 we\nhad the train tickets, we were packed, we had everything. So that was a very bad\nbreak for us because we \u2014 the da \u2014 the Russians evacuated very efficiently. I mean,\nthey \u2014 they left, and they didn\u2019t take anyone with them. We tried to ask them to\ntake us with them, but there was no way, they weren\u2019t going to take any civilians\nat all, and they didn\u2019t. And so we \u2014 we stayed in \u2014 in Lwow. And I remember we\nJanuary 5, 1996\nwere in the cellar at night, because they were shooting and bombing. Not bombing\nso much, but shooting. There was a war. And during the night, I remember there\nwas this marching at night, this very, very strong marching, and my mother said,\nthe Russians are gone, these are the Germans, and I remember say \u2014 sort of \u2014 I\nalways thought that she knew too much before anyone else did, she \u2014 and\nsometimes she was wrong, but very \u2014 most of the time she was right. And I said,\nhow do you know\u201d And she said, because they march differently. And sure was\nshe right, they marched differently. And in the morning, there they were. And so\nthat was the hard \u2014 that was hard, because we were lucky in the way that we had\nthe Bolivian passports, so we did not \u2014 we were not in the ghetto. The ghetto in\nLwow was established very, very quickly, because they already had experience\nfrom Krakow and Warsaw and all that, so they \u2014 in Lwow it went very, very\nquickly. And we couldn\u2019t go out, because they were rounding up children in the\nstreet, they were rounding up people, they were rounding \u2014 you know, and they\nhad these ratzias as they called them, they rounded up people, so my parents\ndidn\u2019t \u2014 th-th-they were afraid to let us out in the street because \u2014 or themselves,\nfor that matter, because they knew that these Bolivian passports \u2014 you know, they\n\u2014 they were safe \u2014 th-there was talk that the \u2014 we would be exchanged for\nprisoners. As you know, these talks went on and on and some people were sent,\nand actually \u2014 I don\u2019t know if anyone was actually exchanged, but some people\nJanuary 5, 1996\nwere deported and told that they would be held, and would be exchanged. These\nforeigners. Some people really had real foreign passports because the husband was\n\u2014 had left Poland before and sent the passport, was living already in \u2014 1n one of\nthe South American countries, and so on, and the wife was supposed to follow.\nAnd so there were some real legitimate ones. Ours were not a hundred percent\nlegitimate, but that didn\u2019t make that much difference.",
        "A: Scary. Very, very scary, because they looked superhuman, they looked like\ngods, and I \u2014 I often had the \u2014 the feeling that maybe if we would look like they\ndid, or be dressed like they did, and have these shiny boots that they had, then\nmaybe we \u2014 they wouldn\u2019t hate us so much. In other words, I remember strongly\nfeeling that they were superior. I believed they were superior at that time, they did\n\u2014 they \u2014 they \u2014 they look mighty and \u2014 and superhuman. So I \u2014 I was just afraid of\nthem, but not \u2014 but at the same time I thought they were great, you know, they\nwere the \u2014 they were \u2014 they were awesome, that\u2019s what they were. I remember\nreading one of Elie Wiesel\u2019s early books, and \u2014 where he talks about the same \u2014\nthat he had sometimes the same sort of feeling, that if he looked \u2014 you know, if he\ncould look like them, they wouldn\u2019t hate us so much. So apparently children did\nhave that kind of fantasy. So I do remember that. I remember being very afraid. I\nremember \u2014 you asked me about relationships and so on, I remember my parents\nJanuary 5, 1996\nat that point fighting all the time. A lot of tension, a lot of fighting, because the\nfights were always about what to do and what not to do. And my mother \u2014 my\nfather was a very law abiding sort of straight kind of person, and he thought if he\nlay low with his Bolivian passports, things would blow over. If he followed\nwhatever directions, or whatever ordinances they passed, and so on, then he would\nbe all right, because you don\u2019t \u2014 you don\u2019t do anything to somebody who\u2019s a law\nabiding citizen. My mother had totally different ideas. My mother felt that we\nwould never survive if we just stayed there, and we have to do something, and\nthere was this constant fighting about who was going to be guilty of us being\nkilled and who wasn\u2019t, and who \u2014 you know, this was [indecipherable] this was,\nand it was really constant. So I remember th-that part of it. After a few \u2014 after \u2014 we\nwere a year with the Germans in \u2014 in Lwow, but after the first two or three\nmonths, my parents too \u2014 sent my brother and me to the country, because by\ncoincidence, the chauffeur that they employed before the war, his wife\u2019s family\ncame from that part of \u2014 of Poland, and they had \u2014 they were farmers, they had a\nfarm, they were peasants. And so he was able to find that out, he \u2014 or I guess my\nfather did, and they paid them, and then my brother and I stayed there for about\ntwo or three months \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 or four months.\nJanuary 5, 1996",
        "A: No-",
        "A: \u2014no, I was so happy to leave, because it was safe, you know, it was quiet. And\nit was \u2014 it felt safe, and \u2014",
        "A: No, no I don\u2019t think it was hard, because I don\u2019t remember it as being hard, I\nremember thinking that \u2014 that this was going to be quiet and safe, and that \u2014 and\nthey also told us that it would be \u2014 we were a burden. They \u2014 they made it very\nclear to us that we were a burden, because we \u2014 ye \u2014 they could hide with grown-\nups, they \u2014 subsequently they were hidden by a German officer in his office. And\nwi \u2014 they couldn\u2019t do that sort of thing with us children around, so we knew that\nwe had \u2014 that we were a kind of burden, and we had to be taken care of\nsomewhere else. So, I know it wasn\u2019t bad, and these people were nice to us.",
        "A: Nothing. We stayed home, we never went out, we just \u2014 nothing. And there my\nmother was very good at creating paper games, pencil and paper games, and that \u2014\nnothing. We couldn\u2019t go out, you did nothing. You \u2014 you went crazy. Particularly\nmy brother went crazy, because he was a little boy and he was lively. I see now,\nJanuary 5, 1996\nfor instance, my grandchildren, if they have no program on a \u2014 you know, then\nwhat \u2014 th-the \u2014 programs for this and programs for that and so on. Nothing, there\nwas nothing. You didn\u2019t do anything. You just \u2014 you just stayed around and\nlistened to what the grown-ups were talking about, and it wasn\u2019t very cheerful,\neither. No, that was hard. You didn\u2019t go to school, you did nothing, you did\nabsolutely nothing. One memory, vivid memory I actually have from \u2014 actually\nthis happened before the Germans came, because they \u2014 we were there for two or\nthree months before, and I had very, very bad teeth. I suppose because of the result\nof this year in Russia and I needed fillings, and those were my permanent teeth,\nand they were \u2014 had enormous cavities in them, and I \u2014 oh, knitting. My mother\ntaught me how to knit and how to darn, and I did a lot of that because that was\nsomething to do all day long. So I had this knitting needle, and I could put it right\nthrough my front teeth, they were s \u2014 and I was supposed to go to the dentist, they\nhad no \u2014 and you know, there were dentists [indecipherable] anyhow, they had no\nNovocain. So, to do that, they had to strap me to the table and \u2014 to the chair, which\nwas, to this day when I go to a dentist, I have a terrible time. But anyway \u2014 and my\nparents were having one of their fights about what to do. And I remember staying\n\u2014 staying in my \u2014 I had like a little alcove where my bed was, and it was early in\nthe morning, and I was supposed to go to the dentist that day, and I remember say-\nsaying to myself whether I should volunteer and say if they stopped fighting, then\nJanuary 5, 1996\nI would go without crying and objecting, and I never made it. I was so afraid of\nthis dentist and the strap and the pain, that I didn\u2019t make it. I let them fight on,\nbecause I couldn\u2019t bring myself to do that, to make that supreme sacrifice.\nAnyway, aft \u2014 so then we went out and we were in the country. There I remember\ndigging potatoes, which was great fun, by the way. And then they made fires, and\nthey roasted the potatoes. I remember Christmas there, where we baked a \u2014 there\nwe had something to do. That was, you see, the difference. I didn\u2019t \u2014 we didn\u2019t go\nout, because they didn\u2019t want us to see the other farmers, and we didn\u2019t go to\nchurch, and we didn\u2019t \u2014 because they all went to church on Sunday, but we didn\u2019t,\nwe were actually hidden. So we only stayed on \u2014 in the field near to their house.\nAnd I remember the animals, I remember milking cows, I remember drinking milk\nstraight from the cow. I remember feeding them, I remember the digging of\npotatoes. So that was actually not \u2014 it was a peaceful kind of interlude, so to speak.\nAnd \u2014",
        "A: Very little. He would go into the \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 yeah h \u2014 my parents would write little notes, you know, letters, and I would\nalso write letters, I knew how to write. And he would go into the city and take the\nJanuary 5, 1996\nletters, and then they would write. Yes, we did have contact, but not spoken,\nwritten yeah.",
        "A: And then \u2014",
        "A: It was he and his wife and a daughter. There were just three of them. The\ndaughter was actually a very pretty girl, and I remember she had \u2014 she would sit in\nfront of the mirror and make \u2014 she must have been about 18 or 19 or whatever, and\nmake the hairdo like they did at that time, three sort of \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 round rolls this way, and then you pinned it with a pin. And then \u2014 and I \u2014 I\nremember thinking when I grow up, that\u2019s exactly the hairdo I\u2019m going to have, I\nwas so jealous of her. And \u2014",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes, yes. They got paid for it. Yes. Oh, they were paid, absolutely. But they\nwere kind, I mean, you know, they were kind. They were \u2014 they were human, they\nwere \u2014 they treated us like \u2014 like they would any other relative children \u2014\nJanuary 5, 1996",
        "A: No, no, no. But we had \u2014 we sort of fit in, you know, when they were\ndecorating the tree, we were decorating the tree. When they were baking cookies,\nwe were baking cookies. But I know that we never went to church there, because\nthey didn\u2019t want us to be all over the place, and people asking too many questions,\nbut when somebody did come, like one of the neighbors or something, they said\nthere were city \u2014 you know, children of some \u2014 somebody who worked in the city,\na relative, and didn\u2019t want the children there; things were hard in the city. Don\u2019t\nforget that things were harder in cities always than in the country, there was a\nshortage of food by then, and all. But we were \u2014 we didn\u2019t have too much contact.\nBut they were nice to us, they didn\u2019t mistreat us in any way at all. And then one\nday he came back from the city, and he told us that he has \u2014 that we are going to\ngo to \u2014 that my parents are going to go to Hungary. And that they would take us \u2014\nhe took us by horse and buggy, or by car, I don\u2019t even remember, but I took us to\nan estate that was owned, or lived in by a German. And this German was supposed\nto help us get to the border. Some \u2014 a German helped us, that\u2019s how \u2014 my \u2014 and\nPll tell you how that connection came. He had a relationship with a Polish woman\nwho was a friend of somebody that my uncle knew. So she hel \u2014 she helped\nseveral Polish and Jewish people through her relationship with him. And again, it\nwas paid as well, but that was the connection. So what they did with us, they\nbrought my brother and me there, we spend one night there. And \u2014\nJanuary 5, 1996",
        "A: Yes, and they \u2014",
        "A: Boushlevich(ph) yes, I remember his last name because everybody called him\nBoushlevich(ph). I don\u2019t remember his first name. Boushlevich(ph). And then he\n\u2014 he brought us there, he left us there, and we were there a few days before my\nparents arrived. And I know it was August, because it was over my birthday. And\nhe showed up, this German, I'll never forget that, and he asked me what I like best\nto eat. And I had a thing about tomatoes, I loved tomatoes. And on my birthday \u2014\nhe asked me when is my birthday, it so happened was in a few days, he brought\nme four tomatoes. I'll never forget that. This was this German. And then \u2014",
        "A: No, don\u2019t remember, I was only there a few \u2014 I don\u2019t even know her name, but\nI understand that she was killed right after the war because she was considered a\ncollaborator. These people didn\u2019t live very long, so \u2014 but anyway, she \u2014 and so my\npar \u2014 and my parents were hidden in his office behind a wardrobe at the end, it\nwas really \u2014 they couldn\u2019t leave his office, they were like behind a big wardrobe, a\npartition or something. I wasn\u2019t there, so I don\u2019t know, but my \u2014 but that\u2019s what\nthey told me. And you see, and that\u2019s why it was important to get us out of the\nway, because you couldn\u2019t hide us together like that. And then \u2014 then my par \u2014\nJanuary 5, 1996\nyou see, my parents at some point realized that they would never survive, or that\nthey would be deported with the Bolivian passport, that the Bolivian passports\nwould not save them from deportations. And you see, there, there was a big\ndifference of opinion between my parents, because my father believed that we\nwould be exchanged, and my mother said no way, this is all \u2014 you know, they\u2019ll\nnever exchange anybody for anybody. And they\u2019ll just take us like everybody else,\nand kill us. So the \u2014 1n the end they made the decision that we would go illegally\nacross the border to Hungary. And \u2014 which was a very risky business, but\napparently they came to the conclusion that it would be less risky than staying\nwith these Bolivian passports in Lw\u00e9w. My uncle had gone before. He went\nbefore because he was \u2014 he didn\u2019t have any foreign passport, and he was what they\ndec \u2014 what they designated as a necessary Jew, because he helped \u2014 just like he\nhelped the Russians to identify what they were robbing, he then did the same for\nthe Germans, because they were \u2014 they were robbing things, and they had these\nwarehouses where they stored them, and they had to decide what to take to\nGermany, what to send to Germany, what not to send to Germany, what to steal,\nwhat not to steal for themselves, and so on, so they needed experts to tell them\nwhat\u2019s good and what isn\u2019t, you know, like in every other area, you know, what is\na good painting, what is a good carpet, what is good china, what is good silver,\nwhat is \u2014 and so on. So my uncle got, since he had that kind of job with the\nJanuary 5, 1996\nRussians, he stayed on and they took over this warehouse, and so he stayed with\nthem. And he became \u2014 my uncle was a very charismatic person and became very\nfriendly with the guy who ran this warehouse. And so first he had like a certificate\nas a notwendig Jude, you know one of these Jews who were necessary for the\nGerman Reich. And then he was arrested twice and badly beaten and both times\nthis German was able to get him out on the \u2014 saying that he was a necessary\nperson. But my uncle realized that this is not going to work a third time, besides he\nsuffered terribly, was terribly beaten. And so he decided to \u2014 to take \u2014 to run \u2014 to\nescape to Hungary, and then we followed. And I remember that crossing of the\nborder, because that was a terrible experience, because you see, they kept saying,\nmy parents kept saying \u2014 I guess they \u2014 they knew about it and they didn\u2019t try to\nhide it. Many of these guys, they were paid and then they took people directly to\nthe nearest police outpost. And there was no way you could pretend, I remember\nbeing totally, totally defenseless against that, because you were in a forest, and\nyou had to cross \u2014 you didn\u2019t cross on a road, you crossed like on trails. And you\nhad to cross a river, there\u2019s a river on the border of Germany \u2014 of Poland and\nHungary. So \u2014 and they were the guides, they \u2014 they were local people who knew\nhow to \u2014 how to get there. And \u2014 but if they turned left or right or straight, and \u2014\nand took you somewhere else, there was no way you could have prevented it, or \u2014\nor even know. And that\u2019s what happened to many people. So I knew about that,\nJanuary 5, 1996\nand I \u2014 I don\u2019t know how I knew about it, because probably my parents talked\nabout it and \u2014 and I remember being terribly afraid that they would deliver us. So\n\u2014 but we didn\u2019t \u2014 they were \u2014 they didn\u2019t, and \u2014 or he didn\u2019t, was one guy. And\nwhat I remember about that is that when we were crossing the river, there was a\nstrong sort of current, and there were like big rocks and it was slippery, and my\nfather fell, or slipped and lost his glasses. And that was a major problem, and he\ngot terribly upset because he couldn\u2019t see without his glasses, he was very\nnearsight. And so I went next to him, or I sort of went back and I started looking\nfor the glasses and I found them, they were caught behind the \u2014 and he talked\nabout this as long as he lived, about these \u2014 that I found his glasses and that saved\nwhatever it saved. But the effect of all of this was that we arrived in Hungary near\nMunkacs, and we \u2014 Munkacs was the nearest metropolis. And we arrived in the\nmorning early, and we were \u2014 my father was wet, and he was in a suit, and he was\nwet from the river. And it wasn\u2019t so much that it was uncomfortable, 1t was in\nAugust, so it wasn\u2019t cold, but as \u2014 as they said late \u2014 it was dangerous, you know?\nWhy would these people be dressed like that and wet and no place to go, in the\npark. We went to a park, because that was the \u2014 the most logical place to be. And\nwhat my father \u2014 what my parents with great bitterness recalled for years and\nyears was that \u2014 see, Hungary had not been occupied yet, and the Hungarian Jews\nin Munkacs \u2014 Munkacs was a very Jewish place, they were living there a normal\nJanuary 5, 1996\nlife, and my parents told \u2014 you know, approached a couple of people, my father\ndid, and told them of \u2014 you know, that we had just escaped from Poland and\nwould they help us. And nobody wanted to help us. Nobody. And it wasn\u2019t even \u2014\nthat\u2019s what my parent were so bitter about, because it was \u2014 later on, you\nunderstood if somebody didn\u2019t help you, or the Poles, for that matter, if they didn\u2019t\nhelp you during the occupation, because they would be severely punished. But at\nthat point in Hungary there was no real danger yet of being severely punished,\nand yet they wanted no part. And we later \u2014 I read about it later a little, I think\nthey thought if they had nothing to do wi-with us, then the evil, and all this\nproblem that\u2019s coming from the east, somehow wouldn\u2019t come to them. You\nknow, but my parents were very bitter about it, I don\u2019t know enough about it. But\nfinally somebody did take us in, and I remember that it was on the outskirts, and it\nwas a\u2014 was not a Jewish family, some \u2014 some woman in the square told us to\nfollow her, and she took us, and she had a barn. And she told us we could stay in\nthat barn. So we dried out in the barn, and she brought us some food. And in the\nmeantime, my father had some sort of a meeting point with \u2014 because my uncle\nwent ahead, and my uncle was supposed to arrange for Christian papers with a\nfake name for us. You see, we couldn\u2019t show up as the same people with the same\npassports in \u2014 in Poland \u2014 in Hungary. You see, we had to then reinvent, and I \u2014\nourselves and the new identity. So th-the idea was that in Hungary we would be\nJanuary 5, 1996\nas Polish Christians, which \u2014 of whom there were many because there were some\ndeserters from before the war, from the beginning of the war. And there was a\ncolony of Polish people there. So these papers came to Munkacs, and my father\ngot them someplace, and they came with a man with a car, who my uncle arranged\nwould take us to Budapest already with those papers. And those papers, that I ha\n\u2014remember one of the most frightening moments of my war was that my mother\ntold us that from now on my name, or \u2014 for me, and my brother too, my name was,\nsince I was always called Ria(ph), that my name was Maria, and the last name\nwas Wolinsky(ph). Our name before the war was Wohl. So the simplest thing,\nthey dropped the H and made it into a very nice Polish name, which was\nWolinsky(ph), so my name was Maria Wolinsky(ph), or Wolinska(ph) for that\nmatter. And my brother was Stefan always, so there was no problem, was Stefan\nWolinsky(ph) and my father was Athol(ph) and my mother was Gisele. But, when\nwe were \u2014 you see, the - Munkacs in that area was still the border, it was the\nborder strip what they called, and then there was a post, a police post that you had\nto pass. And there they stopped all the cars and looked and \u2014 and you had to\nidentify yourself, or whatever, identification. And at that point, when they stopped\nus, my mind went blank. I suddenly could not remember whether our name now\nwas Wolinsky(ph) or Wolsky(ph), which are very similar. And I was \u2014 and how I\ndidn\u2019t die of a heart attack, although children don\u2019t usually, but I was trembling\nJanuary 5, 1996\nand I was petrified. And this guard spoke to the driver, of course and the driver \u2014\nthey spoke Hungarian, we couldn\u2019t understand a word. And they \u2014 he told them\nthat we were some relatives or something. I mean, it never came to us \u2014 to our\nhaving \u2014 it was all bribe \u2014 the \u2014 to identify ourselves, but I thought that it might,\nand I was sure that they would ask me my name, this was very important at that\npoint, and I was very scared. And as soon as we started moving again, I said to my\nmother, I forgot what our name is. And she \u2014 and I was \u2014 you know, I \u2014 I saw\nmyself also as being the \u2014 the one who caused everyone to be whatever \u2014 so, killed\nor \u2014 or whatever. So my mother said then, don\u2019t worry, she said, if you \u2014 if they\nhad asked you for your name, we would have been lost anyway, no matter what\nthey would have s \u2014 what they would have \u2014 what you would have said. So \u2014 but it\nwas just, to show you how these things were. So then we came to Budapest and in\nBudapest we stayed in a pensionne. And we could not stay in the city, it was sort\nof in the outskirts of the city, but life was good. You had plenty of food, we had\ncomfortable rooms. Apparently life was enormously cheap in Hungary at that\ntime. And my father went to the city quite often, I remember, came back and then\nonce he was \u2014 you see, the \u2014 the \u2014 the Hungarians were allies of the Germans.\nGonna stop it.\nEnd of Tape Two\nJanuary 5, 1996\nBeginning Tape Three",
        "A: Right, and we have just arrived, and we were actually sort of waiting. We\nstayed in this pensionne. My father would go into Budapest, it was a train ride, a\nshort train ride. He would meet my uncle, he would meet other people. The main\nbusiness of the day was some trading. You had to get some money. At that point\nmy mother sold some jewelry, particularly one diamond pin about which she\ntalked a lot because she said the things in \u2014 in Hungary were so inexpensive that\nwe lived on that pin for one year. [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yes \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 yes, she had it \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 she had jewelry \u2014 yes, yes, she kept a few things and she had it with her. And\nshe sold that. And they were also trading in stones. There was a big trade going on\nin diamonds, in foreign currencies; dollars, English pounds, and people were\ntrading, the Jews and the non-Jews, th-th-the Gentile refugees. There was a\nbusiness going on and people were trading and that\u2019s how people made some\nmoney, and that\u2019s what people lived on. Because at that point, none of us were\nJanuary 5, 1996\nreally in hiding. We did \u2014 my father did get held up or arrested at one point,\nbecause they were checking the legitimacy of his being there. So he had false\npapers, we had to have a permit to be \u2014 a residency permit, which we sort of got,\nbut I know that he was in Budapest, he wasn\u2019t supposed to be there. Anyhow, he\ngot caught, and then they came and got us, th-the \u2014 the \u2014 this is all now Hungarian\npolice. And, because he told them where that they \u2014 they asked where we are, you\nknow, and they knew he had family, or that he told them he had family, I don\u2019t\nknow, I wasn\u2019t there. But they did come and they arrested us. And we were put\ninto a \u2014 they had like a detention camp, it was not a real prison, but it was like a\ndetention camp in the center of Budapest. And the danger there was that they\nwould send us back to Poland.",
        "A: Scared. We were scared because we were afraid that they would send us back\nto Poland. I knew better than anybody else, or certainly better than they that our\npapers were fake, our permits were fake, and if they caught on to that, they did\nsend \u2014 you see, they were allies of the \u2014 of the Germans. They were not occupied,\nbut they were allies, and if they found that somebody was really Jewish, and was\npretending to be Polish, and had no legitimate papers to be there, they did send\nsome people back. And that was the danger. It wasn\u2019t so much that the prison\nitself was so terrible. It was not very comfortable. They separated women from\nJanuary 5, 1996\nmen. All I remember is that there was a courtyard in the center of it, that\u2019s actually\none of the nicer stories, with a huge tree. And the \u2014 the \u2014 my \u2014 my father, when we\nlived in this pensionne, we were not far from a forest, and my brother found, one\nday when we went for a walk, he found a baby squirrel that must have fallen out\nfrom the nest or whatever, and we took it home. And this baby squirrel, we had\nhad him now maybe for a couple of months when \u2014 when we got arrested. And he\nwas tame, he was \u2014 he would sit in people\u2019s pockets. He was quite destructive\nactually, he would chew things up. But of course, my brother absolutely adored\nthis squirrel, and to this day he loves squirrels, and I do too. And when my father \u2014\nwhen they arrested us, my \u2014 they did go back with my father a day or two later,\nand \u2014 to pick up some things, you know, the necessities, and so they \u2014 they went\nback with my father and he was supposed to pick up some things for us. And at\nthat point the squirrel apparently recognized him and came to him and jumped into\nhis pocket as he always did. And there he was, and this policeman had never seen\na squirrel like that. And so he s \u2014 you know, the squirrel came back to prison, and\nhe was there. And when we got \u2014 when he got there, we didn\u2019t know what to do\nwith him, cause you couldn\u2019t keep him in the pocket all the time. So we let him go\nin the courtyard, and he went up and down that tree. He became like \u2014 everybody\nloved him. And luckily, we were released a few days later and the squirrel went\nhome with us. But one of the other sort of more humorous thing \u2014 they \u2014 they\nJanuary 5, 1996\nexamined our papers and decided it was okay. But one of the more humorous\nthings from that was that when they interrogated you, you had these false papers,\nbut you had to have \u2014 you know, they could ask you what was your mother\u2019s\nmaiden name, what was your grandmother\u2019s maiden name, and so on. So people\nof course, and we weren\u2019t the only ones who were in that situation, didn\u2019t have all\nthat information, nor did they \u2014 so they invented these names, and my mother used\nto tol \u2014 told a very funny story of this woman who was interro \u2014 who was asked,\nyou know, interrogated, and when she was asked, she would look around and pick\nan object, and say, you know, tay-tabloska(ph), you know, and just add the Polish\nending to it, you\u2019d look around. So that\u2019s how things were, you know, and \u2014 and\nyou either got away with it, or you didn\u2019t get away with it, depended. But anyway,\nso then we were there for another \u2014 must have been there about 10 days, and then\nthey released it.",
        "A: No, no \u2014",
        "A: \u2014no, no. I memorized what my mother told us to memorize, we didn\u2019t invent\nsome sort of maiden names for my grandmother and so on. And no, I was not mem\n\u2014 we also were taught very carefully by my mother, who knew those things,\nbecause she had been educated in Catholic schools, we were taught the basic\nJanuary 5, 1996\nprayers, you know, th-the Holy Mary, the \u2014 and Father, who are in heaven, the \u2014\nthe Pater Noster, because as Christian children we obviously had to know these\nmain things. So those things we knew backwards and forwards in \u2014 in Polish,\nquite, quite well. We were not questioned about that. So then they released us and\nwe went back to this place, but they told us that we couldn\u2019t stay there, because it\nwas too close to Budapest. And they had, at that time they had some rules about\nPolish refugees in general. This was not directed against Jews. They did not want\nlarge concentrations of foreign refugees in Budapest, say they wanted them\noutside of Budapest in smaller villages and ar \u2014 and so on, areas. So at that point\n\u2014 by the way, the squirrel, after he came back about a week later, he grew, he\nbecame \u2014 a-and he left, he ran away. Probably went back to the forest, once he\nwas no longer a baby, he was gone. And my brother was very upset when he \u2014 but\n\u2014 but he came back from prison, then he left. And then we \u2014 so then we had to\nmove, and we moved to an area that was \u2014 that they told us they \u2014 that we should\nbe in, and it was not far from Budapest, about an hour by train in Leanyfalu, and\nthat was sort of a concentration of Polish refugees. We rented a villa. We could do\nthat, we did \u2014 you know, within the circumference of where they wanted to \u2014 we\ncould live the way we wanted to live. The only problem with that was that we\nwere surrounded by Poles, and many of them not Jews. Some were Jews like us\nand some were not. More were not. And there the theater started. You really had to\nJanuary 5, 1996\nknow how to pretend not to be Jewish. And these Polish people, they knew. I\nmean, this was \u2014 this was all a \u2014a theater. So there \u2014 first of all, we had a fairly\nnormal life in the sense that we were not hiding, so my mother decided to see if\nshe could find somebody to take care of my brother and of me, and teach us\nsomething. I mean, you \u2014 we had never been to school again. And they \u2014 we were\ndriving them also crazy. So we \u2014 they took a \u2014 they found a lady who had been a\nteacher before the war, and she was the wife of a \u2014 of a \u2014 she was Polish, not\nJewish, and she was the wife, a young wife of a Polish deserter. Most of these\nPoles were actually somehow families of deserters. You know, they deserted in\n1939 from this army that was falling apart. And he was a tenor at the \u2014 at the opera\nin Poznan a Polish singer, and she was a teacher. And she was just as happy to\nwork for us because she was paid, of course. And she would come in the morning\nand she would take care of us all day long. And I \u2014 that was a \u2014 very nice, because\nshe would take us on picnics. She did find some Polish books. She made up a\nschedule, you know, we read, and then she had dictation, and then she had\narithmetic, and then she had lunch and \u2014 and we were with her all day long, and\nshe invented \u2014 she even \u2014 we even staged a little \u2014 I think one of the pictures that \u2014\nthat I showed you that you took was a staging of a Polish song in honor of my\nuncle\u2019s birthday and so on.\nJanuary 5, 1996",
        "A: No, he did \u2014 yes, he was in Hungary, and he was in Budapest, but he did not\ngo with us \u2014",
        "A: No, he did not live with us \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 in this bucolic \u2014 no, he \u2014 when he had some Polish friends, he stayed with\nthem, he \u2014 he had to also sort of do some wheeling and dealing, because he had to\nearn some sort of living. My father has \u2014 was more fortunate, my father had more\nmoney, my father had my mother\u2019s jewelry, he had \u2014 he had some connections\nwhere he could get some money, he got some money from Switzerland that point\nas well. So he was different, but my \u2014 my uncle really lived by trading, you know,\nhe would buy antiques, sell antiques, make a commission. Buy and sell, that\u2019s\nwhat \u2014 and \u2014 and \u2014 and that\u2019s what he did, and he was a young, single person, I\nmean, his family was in Siberia, he had no contact at that point, he had no idea\nwhether they lived or died. Chances were they all lived, by the way. We did know\nthat the people in \u2014 in Siberia, unless they died of disease, that they were not\nkilled. That much one did know. So \u2014 so we went \u2014",
        "A: No contact, none whatsoever, except that rumor had it that they did not kill\npeople \u2014\nJanuary 5, 1996",
        "A: \u2014 unlike the Germans, who did kill people. Then we lived \u2014 so there we lived\nfor a while very nicely, until the day that the Germans marched in. When the ger \u2014\nand we went to church regularly, went to church every Sunday, because you know,\nthat was the [indecipherable]",
        "A: That\u2019s a very interesting, I \u2014",
        "A: Not the feeling that \u2014 that Americans have, not the feeling that I find among\nJews here, which I very often find very reprehensible. You went \u2014 I knew that it\nwas not my religion. I was afraid that I would do things wrong. You had to\nparticipate, you had to know when to get up, you had to go \u2014 know how to go to\ncommunion, you had to say the prayers the right place, you had to \u2014 you had to\npretend, and you \u2014 and \u2014 and it had to be real. Another thing that I often \u2014 that I\nknow was very highly emphasized to us, and I still feel very strongly about this, is\nthat we had to speak Polish correctly. We were not allowed \u2014 my mother would\nhave killed us if we had used a Jewish word, I mean that was a giveaway. So you\nwere sort of brainwashed to speak it, to speak it correctly and speak it without an\nintonation and so on. Because those were giveaways. So to this day, when \u2014 when\nI hear \u2014 hear people mixing, you know, Yiddish and English, I \u2014 I can\u2019t stand it.\nJanuary 5, 1996\nFirst of all, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s nice, because every language should be \u2014 I have\nnothing against Yiddish, but by itself, it shouldn\u2019t be mixed, you don\u2019t mix\nlanguages. Now there it was a matter of life and death, so you had to speak Polish\ncorrectly, and that was s-something that was another reason why my mother was\nvery anxious to hire somebody to \u2014 to \u2014 to be with us, though, because children\npick up accents, and that we should speak properly. So, we went to church every\nSunday. How did I feel? I had one problem with it, and that was a very strange\none. That the incense, I hated the smell of it, and I must have just about gotten to\nthe age just before puberty, and I used to get terrible headaches. And \u2014 which I\nsuffered from for a while. But I had a feeling at that time that the incense ma \u2014\nproduced them. Any time they start \u2014 I always had a headache on Sunday, whether\nit was the tension and the incense, or what it was \u2014 my mother went with us to\nchurch, so did my father. My mother knew very well what to do, she was very \u2014\nhad been exposed to it and so on. My father did \u2014 you know, what he was told to\ndo. But that was one of the things that did make us nervous. It\u2019s not that I was \u2014\nthat I hated it, but it made us nervous. It\u2019s like crossing the border, you know. If\nthey discover you\u2019re not who you say you are, you\u2019re in danger, so it made me\nnervous, yes.",
        "A: Yes, yes. We \u2014\nJanuary 5, 1996",
        "A: Yes, yes, because I knew that each time, like when they arrested us, and they \u2014\nthey\u2019ll be another episode later, which was more dangerous, that each time there\nwas the possibility that they would send us back. And if they send you back, then\nthat was death.",
        "A: Oh, oh [indecipherable]",
        "A: Because everybody talked about it, that the danger was not so much of sitting\nin this prison in Budapest, which was not \u2014 they didn\u2019t torture you, they didn\u2019t\nbeat you, they didn\u2019t do terrible things to you. The danger was that they will se \u2014 if\nthey discover that you\u2019re not who you say you are, they\u2019Il send you back. If you \u2014\nthey send you back, you\u2019ll go to the border guards, the border guards will hand\nyou over to the Gestapo. And then we knew that that was \u2014 that was 95 \u2014 99\npercent sure that you will be killed.\nto put a layer \u2014 to prote \u2014 a protective layer?",
        "A: No, no, because this was in the air, everybody talked about it; who had been\ncaught, who had been sent back, why did they send them back, why the papers\nweren\u2019t good enough. This was \u2014 this was what people talked about, so this was\nJanuary 5, 1996\nsomething they couldn\u2019t really protect us from. They said that our papers were\nbetter, maybe, or that if we spoke correctly Polish that we would minimize this,\nthat somebody would denounce us locally. You know, all these things, that\u2019s why\nwe would \u2014 did all these things, to prevent this from happening. But nobody tried\nto tell you that if it did happen, that you would survive, no, th-th-that was like a\nsure death. So that was the scary thing out there all the time. And that\u2019s the danger\nof living on false papers, you know. So we stayed there, and \u2014 and w \u2014 and we\nwere there until the Germans invaded. When the Germans invaded, that\u2019s when\nthings became very dangerous, because a \u2014 they came and they made a inspection,\nand they did it very, very quickly. Everybody had to register with them. They\ncame, they set up a desk in a\u2014 in a ha \u2014 in a schoolhouse or in a house \u2014 I\nremember it was 1n a house. And people had to line up \u2014",
        "A: Yes. People had to line up. They made an announcement, tomorrow morning or\nwhatever, they are going to have an inspection, everybody has to register. Was just\na registration, really. But that was dangerous, because they, of course, were\nlooking for Jews, that\u2019s what they were looking for. So that was very bad, and at\nthat point, we were doubly afraid; A, that they would discover that our papers\nwere not a hundred percent right, and B, that somebody would denounce us,\nbecause before that, if somebody had denounced us, there was really very little\nJanuary 5, 1996\ngain. What, they went to the Hungarians, the Hungarians didn\u2019t know who was\nwho, they were not that interested in the whole thing. But here now, we were\nafraid of that. So the minute that happened, we went through the registration\nbecause there was nothing we could do to avoid it, because it happened very\nquickly.",
        "A: Yes, Is \u2014 went with my mother, yes, I went with my mo \u2014 they separated men\nand women. But one \u2014 what was the wonderful thing about it is that my \u2014 my \u2014\nyou see, what was dangerous was for my father \u2014 it wasn\u2019t so much for women,\nbecause they did examine men, they \u2014 and that was the easiest way to tell who was\nwho. This husband of this teacher whom we had, he \u2014 his physique was somewhat\nsimilar to my father, he was shorter, but other than that, he was sort of husky, was\na big man also, but shorter. And anyhow, he went instead of my father. He went in\nthe morning himself, he got on the end of the line after a couple of hundred\npeople, he went instead of \u2014 with my father\u2019s papers. And my brother they didn\u2019t\nexamine, my brother went, you know, with him as his child and they just, you\nknow. So after that \u2014 I\u2019m in touch with her to this day, I just wrote her a letter.\nThey still \u2014\nJanuary 5, 1996",
        "A: Rochinski(ph), Rochinski(ph). Her name was Helena Rochinska(ph). His\nname is \u2014 I don\u2019t know his first name, but Rochinski(ph), you know, you didn\u2019t\naddress people by their first name, but I knew her better than him. But I\u2014 we saw\nthem now \u2014 I mean, now, in 1973 when we were in Poland, and Mike and I went\nto visit them. They live in Poznan, and to this day I am in touch with her, I write\nto her, my father\u2019s, you know, helped her after the war. I still send her money as\nwell, and so on. So it is one of those wonderful stories. And they are \u2014 so then we\ndisappeared. Right after this-this thing, we knew we-we \u2014 we couldn\u2019t stay, that\nwe \u2014 we ran away from there.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Just \u2014 just being scared, and being relieved after they, you know, they \u2014 they \u2014\nyou went there, they \u2014 they looked at your papers and they waived you on. There\nwas no conversation. The minute \u2014 as my mother used to say, the minute a\nconversation starts, things are bad. I mean, you know, there was nothing to talk\nabout if they didn\u2019t question your truthfulness, or whatever. So, no, there was no\nconversation, looked at our paper and waved us on and that was it. Then we went\nhome. And that was another one of those situations where my parents had an\nenormous fight, because my father felt that now that they have, you know,\nJanuary 5, 1996\nregistered us and examined us, we could stay. Then my mother said, we can\u2019t stay\nhere. Somebody sooner or later will either denounce us or something\u2019s \u2014 this is no\nplace for us to stay now. And she usually won out, because she made such scenes,\nmy mother could fight, and \u2014 and actually my parents got along. And so we left.\nWe left. I mean, what we did was \u2014 I don\u2019t remember exactly how \u2014 we stayed\nwith a fr \u2014 my brother and I stayed with a friend of my uncle\u2019s, a Christian\nwoman, a Polish lady, in Budapest. And my parents stayed with somebody, but I\nhave no idea with whom. And during the next few weeks, two or three or four\nweeks, whatever that time period was, they made arrangements to \u2014 to try to cross\nthe border illegally, to Romania. In other words, we tried to do the same thing we\ndid from Poland to Hungary, now from Hungary to Romania. Romania, things\nwere much easier, as you know. Prior to that, I forgot to mention my \u2014 you know,\nthere were transports going, prior to the Germans arriving, there was a way of\ngoing to Palestine th-that was \u2014 there was some sort of effort made, and my uncle\ntried to get on one of those transports, because he had been a Zionist before the\nwar, which my father was not, and he knew Hebrew, and he rated whatever, you\nknow, an affidavit, or whatever they needed at the time, to prove that they were\nworthy of going to Palestine. And he, I don\u2019t know how he did it, but he got this\nfake \u2014 I showed you that picture, I think \u2014 he got this fake permit for a wife and a\nchild, and my mother was supposed to go as his wife, and Stefan, my brother was\nJanuary 5, 1996\nsupposed to go as their child. But that never materialized. That\u2019s why there is this\nfunny photo, passport photo of my uncle, my mother and \u2014 and my brother. That\nnever materialized. But then, after the Germans came, and we were hiding for a\nbit, we tried to go to Romania. And the way that happened was we went to\nSzeged, and there there was a line-up. There was a house owned by some people\nwho rented the rooms. You paid them. And that was just renting rooms. But then\nthere was an aristocrat or a landowner who was \u2014 whose property was right on the\nborder, and th-the \u2014 the way was through his property. And he was a kind of bon\nvivant before the war, or during the beginning of the war, and he had a lot of\nparties. So he wasn\u2019t conspicuous by having 10, 12 people at his estate at any one\ntime. So people \u2014 so the first place where you stayed was a \u2014 at \u2014 in Szeged, and\nthen you went at night to his property, and then you stayed there for one day, and\nthere was this pretense of a party. And then at night you crossed the border to\nRomania. And the party before us was caught. Somebody must have announced,\nand they were all killed, by the way. So he was \u2014 they were caught, and somebody\n\u2014 and they came to get us, because somebody \u2014 they were tortured, and they gave\nout the address of where people \u2014 they knew that this was like a chain. My uncle,\nluckily, was not home when they came to arrest us. We were there, he was out on\n\u2014 in town, because he was supposed to go with us that evening, but he went out on\nJanuary 5, 1996\ntown. He was a \u2014 that was one of these strokes of genius. And he \u2014 and we were\narrested, and they took us to the local jail in Szeged.",
        "A: Just the four of us, right. They separated my mother and me, and my brother\nand \u2014 and my father were in the men\u2019s\u2019 jail. Now there I remember it distinctly,\nbecause we went in the same cell with two prostitutes. You \u2014 this was a local\nprison, you know, you had these \u2014 and it was a miserable little jail, and the\nconditions were terrible, and there I was sure that we wouldn\u2019t survive. I was\nterrified, because I knew that if they arrested us, and these people there gave our\nnames, that the next thing would be that they \u2014 that the police, th-the Hungarian\npolice would hand us over to the Gestapo, there was no \u2014 I didn\u2019t think there was\nany other way out of this. And there my mother used to say that I used to cry. I\u2014I\nremember crying, I remember thinking that I was too young to die. And my\nmother said that I told her a couple of times that it\u2019s easier for her because she\nalready had a life, and I didn\u2019t have anything. And she said that was sort of\nheartbreaking. But I remember being terribly scared in that prison, terribly. Cause\nthere it was the closest we came to being sent back. And we were there for a few\ndays, and we were told by the Hungarian guards, and by these women with whom\nmy mother started being very friendly, that they are \u2014 that the Gestapo came to the\nprison once a week. There was a day when they handed people over. And so the\nJanuary 5, 1996\nhope was that somehow, by some miracle, we would get out, I don\u2019t know if it\nwas a Monday or a Tuesday, whatever, before that happened. But I s \u2014 I didn\u2019t see\nany way out, but it so happened that after \u2014 I\u2019Il tell you why it happened. I \u2014 that\nthe day before there was \u2014 we were there six days \u2014 the day before they were\nsupposed to come, they released us, and in the custody of a local lawyer, a\nHungarian lawyer who was born and bred in Szeged. Now the way this was done\nis very interesting, 1t shows you how resourceful my uncle was. When my uncle\ncame back and realized we had been taken \u2014 by the way, my mother left money\nand jewelry behind one of the pictures. They had a \u2014 they had a \u2014 a secret as to\nhow, you know \u2014 anyhow [indecipherable] he got that, and he went back to\nBudapest, by foot, by hitchhike, I don\u2019t even know how, but he did go back,\nbecause his papers were not so [indecipherable] either. But he was loner man, he\nwas very resourceful. And he went to the Polish committee, there was a Polish\ncommittee, which was in charge of Polish refugees in Hungary. It was like a\u2014a\ncommittee. And he knew a number of people; my uncle was very friendly with a\nnumber of non-Jews from before the war. He knew people in \u2014 and all the time, he\nwas in touch with them. And he told them what happened to us. And basically,\nthey figured out that the only transgression that we did, for all practical purposes,\nwas that my father was not supposed to be in Szeged, because we, as Polish\nrefugees were \u2014 we had designated areas where we were supposed to live, and\nJanuary 5, 1996\nSzeged was not one of them. So they invented this idea that he went to look for\nwork. And that was a very nice idea, but then they looked for a connection and\nthey found the most prominent lawyer in Szeged, paid him off. He paid off the \u2014 I\nmean, this \u2014 the \u2014 the girl was his regular, you know, where he \u2014 where he was\nwell known, and where he had his cronies. So that\u2019s how we got out. So we were\nactually \u2014 and this lawyer, also a wonderful man, took us to his house, and you\nknow, really treated us \u2014 he was a Hungarian \u2014 very well. I mean, he fed us, I\nremember we took a bath there, everything was \u2014",
        "A: Terrible, terrible \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 it was a small cell \u2014 no, no. It was a cell where you sat \u2014",
        "A: Absolutely, and it was with these two \u2014 two women who my mother later told\nme were prostitutes, but these were local girls, and we were just sitting there with\nthese local women, and \u2014 and my mother used to tell me stories, because my\nbrother wasn\u2019t with us, we didn\u2019t see them, they were \u2014 you know, they \u2014 we saw\nthem maybe once, they \u2014 there was a place where \u2014 where \u2014 there was a corridor\nwhere my mother went to see them, I didn\u2019t see them. But she used to tell me\nstories. I once made a speech for the Heschel(ph) school. I said that, you know,\nJanuary 5, 1996\nchildren\u2019s stories usually start with once upon a time, our stories always started,\nafter the war. And she used to invent \u2014 she was a very good story teller in general,\nand she used to invent these stories about what would happen after the war. But\nthere I \u2014 it was almost more than a fairy tale, because there I didn\u2019t believe we\nwould get out. That was the only time I really didn\u2019t think we would make it.",
        "A: Yes, yes \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 yes, yes, yes. I felt that she was the strongest \u2014 and I \u2014 my strongest bond was\nto my uncle, cause my uncle was like God. He was the one who arranged things.\nHe arranged our escape from Poland \u2014",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: From Poland to Hungary. He arranged a \u2014 first \u2014 and he was also very\namusing, he was a \u2014 he arranged that \u2014 our release from prison. He would arrange\nthings, you know, he would bring things for us, he would tell stories, he would \u2014\nhe had all the adventures. I mean, in between he had his own adventures. He used\nto tell stories how he outwitted different the \u2014 he \u2014 he \u2014 to me he was immortal,\nindestructible an-and he proved such, I mean, he was a wonderful man. So he, to\nJanuary 5, 1996\nme, was God. I worshipped the ground he walked on. And my mother was the next\nbest thing, because she was a little bit like him, but of course she was a woman,\nand she was tied to my father and my father was ailing also, he was, you know, he\nwas not the \u2014 he \u2014 he was sick. As a matter of fact, in \u2014 I mean, not all the time,\nbut in Szeged, right after they released us, he had a gall bladder attack. And he \u2014\nthis Hungarian lawyer arranged for him to go to the hospital and he was very, very\nsick. At that point, my uncle made some sort of arrangements with somebody to\npick us up, my brother and me, and brought us to Budapest, by train, I remember.\nWe went to Budapest and then he put us up with his friend, he had a lady friend\nwhile he was \u2014 while he was there he had lots of lady friends.",
        "A: And so we stayed with \u2014 with his friend at the time, was a lovely Polish\nwoman, beautiful woman. And she \u2014 so she \u2014 we lived with her, and then my\nuncle came and \u2014 and you know, he was there in the evenings and all the time, but\nwe basically lived with her. And my parents went to the hospital. Was a convent\nhospital, and my father was apparently very sick, which I didn\u2019t know any more,\nbecause we had left. And my mother said that they came ahe \u2014 and they actually\ncame for \u2014 you know, to give him unction, and these were these priests, and my\nmother told him how he had to confess, he had to make a last confession. And of\ncourse, he didn\u2019t have to do it so well, because it was in Hungarian [break]\n100January 5, 1996",
        "A: Right. So he went to the hospital. I understand he was ex \u2014 very, very sick. My\nmother claimed that after he had the last confession and they did do his \u2014 the rites\nand all of that, he started improving. She actually believed \u2014",
        "A: Yes, yes, but he confessed \u2014 he was very sick and he was probably, you know,\neven not quite lucid. I mean, he spoke in Polish and they didn\u2019t \u2014 these were\nHungarian priests, so whatever he mumbled, she sort of improvised half Polish,\nher Hungarian wasn\u2019t so great either, was not the pun \u2014 you know, our obligation\nto know Hungarian. So anyhow, she said the confession went very well, but she\nalways told it as a very amusing story, how he after that started improving. And he\n\u2014 so he was in this hospital for a few weeks, and she was with him. She \u2014 you\nknow, they very often let relatives stay in European hospitals, it\u2019s still common in\nBrazil, even. But anyway, after that \u2014 and we were hidden \u2014 not hidden, but living\nwith this woman, hidden in a way, because we couldn\u2019t go out. And then later, my\nuncle placed us with the janitor of a villa which was owned by Jewish antique\ndealer, who had been a contact of my uncles before the war. It was now occupied\nby a Dutch \u2014 I don\u2019t know, official, or somebody who was doing a lot of business\nwith the Germans. And my uncle met him because he knew both the janitor and\nthe previous owner. The previous owner, by the way, survived in one of those\n101January 5, 1996\nJewish houses in \u2014 in Budapest, he was not deported, he did survive. And so my\nuncle placed us in this villa, 1t was in Buda, right on top of a mountain, near a\ncemetery, I remember, with this janitor and his wife. So we were there. My\nparents, when they returned from Szeged from the hospital, stayed with some\nfriends or some people they knew in Budapest. This was already now getting\nclose to the end, and confusion was rampant. This was already \u2014 the Russians were\nvery close.",
        "A: My brother was a nuisance, throughout the war. My brother was \u2014 I always\nthought \u2014 my \u2014 my father, you see, my fath - my mother was his second wife, and\nhe was not young. My father was born in 1887, so when my brother was born, he\nwas close to 50. So my father had very little \u2014 and he was a very autocratic kind of\nauthoritarian person. He had very little understanding, knowledge or anything\nabout children. Children were supposed to be quiet and obey. And my brother was\nlively, had nothing to do \u2014 I mean we \u2014 we had nothing to do, it\u2019s very \u2014 now I see\nhow difficult it was, but as a result of it, he was a terrible nuisance. He \u2014 he \u2014 my\nfather was constantly yelling at him, my uncle often used to beat him up, he was\nbeaten very often. He was a terrible nuisance, because he \u2014 he couldn\u2019t just\nbehave. And I, as a child, or \u2014 I was only a year and a half older, I was very\nmature, and I was very quiet. So I was no problem. My mother taught me how to\n102January 5, 1996\ndarn, my mother taught me how to knit. Later on I knew how to read, so I used to\nread \u2014 not appropriate things, because she \u2014 whatever Polish book she had, I could\nsit there and decipher it, whether I liked the story or not, because that was\nsomething to do. I did all kinds of word games and so on. My brother wasn\u2019t\ninterested in any of that, and he didn\u2019t do any of that. So he really \u2014 I don\u2019t\nremember what he did except make a terrible nuisance of himself. So \u2014 and I\nalways, whenever they f-\u2014 they also fought about him, because my mother\nprotected him, my father got angry at him, my mother protected him. So he was a\nproblem, and I always thought that he was the problem, I didn\u2019t know, nor did I\nunderstand that the circumstances were the problem, and he was just a naturally \u2014\na normal child who was in terrible conditions.",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t \u2014 maybe I did and maybe I didn\u2019t, I don\u2019t remember. No, I don\u2019t\nremember. I remember playing with him sometimes. I remember taking care of\nhim sometimes when he became impossible. My father would say, you take care\nof him, and I tried to \u2014 to make him be quiet. I don\u2019t know \u2014 we both were afraid\nat \u2014 as a matter of fact, I told you that I did an oral history in Brazil in Portuguese,\nand I have those tapes, but because of my brother, because he did one over there\nand they were \u2014 they had a program on Jewish refugees a few years ago, and the \u2014\n103January 5, 1996\nthe focus was, what do people take when they\u2019re running away, do they take their\npictures, do they take jewelry, do they take medals\u2019? I mean, depending, different\npeople took different things. But that was the focus, and with that they had a few\noral histories. And it is amazing how different his perception was of what\nhappened. How he was afraid \u2014 the basic facts are the same, but like he was afraid\nat different times, he remembers different moments as being the worst or the best,\nand \u2014 from me. And we were only a year and a half apart, so \u2014 but I do know that\nhe was a problem. He was a problem because he \u2014 he had \u2014 he was a problem;\nmade noise, got on people\u2019s nerves, because he was bored. So I \u2014 you know, I\ntolerated \u2014 I \u2014 I identified with the grownups and the people who knew that \u2014 that\nyou had to behave. And \u2014 and \u2014 and he \u2014 and I saw him the same way,\nunfortunately, I\u2019ve \u2014 today I\u2019m sorry about it, as my father did, that he was a\nnuisance and he didn\u2019t know how to behave and he didn\u2019t know that he had to be\nquiet. So, I did not identify with him, nor with his problems. I didn\u2019t identify with\nhis problems til many years later, when I had my own children and I realized that\nchildren \u2014 what children really need and so on. But during the war he was a pain in\nthe neck, he really was. And, I think we\u2019ll stop here, because otherwise I\u2019ll be very\nlate.\nEnd of Tape Three\n104March 1, 1999\nBeginning Tape Four, Side A",
        "A: That\u2019s correct, except that my impression is that it was fall 1944, and we \u2014 at that\npoint we were in Buda; we meaning my brother and I, because my parents stayed on\nin Szeged longer because my father was sick. He was first in the hospital, then he\nstayed for as long as they could in the house of the lawyer who was able to get us\nout of jail. He was a lawyer who was quite prominent in Szeged, had a large\napartment, because I remember it, because that\u2019s where went directly from prison,\nwe went to his apartment, and we stayed there a day or two before my brother and I\nleft for Budapest, and he \u2014 and my father went to \u2014 got sick and stayed on and\nended up in the hospital. Now we are in Buda at the janitor of a friend of my uncle\u2019s\n\u2014 oh, not a friend really, but an acquaintance who was in the same business as my\n105March 1, 1999\nuncle, he was a art dealer in Budapest, and he had a villa in Buda where he lived,\nand on the property he had a caretaker and his wife. It was a small house on the\nproperty, separate. And that\u2019s where my uncle placed us. And that\u2019s where we were\nliving, and it wasn\u2019t bad there, it was fine. I mean, they fed us and they were quite\nnice to us, we were not supposed to be running around too much, although we could\ngo into the garden, but we were not going out too much. And my uncle would come\nand visit us quite often. Eventually, my parents came back to Budapest, and we did\nnot see them, at least I don\u2019t remember seeing them. And I think they stayed\nsomewhere, with someone for a very short time, because then my father got sick\nagain. And he went to the hospital, and from what I understand, he was operated \u2014\nhe had gall bladder problems, that \u2014 that was his u \u2014 these various stays in the\nhospital ha \u2014 were gall bladder attacks. And I think he was oper \u2014 not only I think, I\nknow, he was operated by a surgeon as th \u2014 people called them then a professor\nsomething, pr \u2014 I don\u2019t remember his name. And the surgeon realized that they were\n\u2014 who they were, or what they were and he decided to help them, I presume. And he\nkept my father in the hospital beyond \u2014 beyond what was necessary. Today you\ncan\u2019t do that, but then you did. And he was a prominent \u2014 he was prominent in this\nhospital, and my parents had a private room, and my mother stayed with him, which\nwas very common in those days. And he \u2014 they were liberated 1n the hospital. So for\n106March 1, 1999\nthem this was a marvelous thing, because he just kept him on and on. And he wasn\u2019t\nterribly well, he was weak, he was after surgery, so there was some justification in\nthat. But anyhow, that\u2019s where they were liberated. We, on the other side \u2014 on the\nother hand were in Buda in \u2014 with this janitor, and my uncle was the one who kept\ncoming to us and visiting us. And \u2014 and yo \u2014 sort of looking after us. And while this\nwas going on, of course the front was getting closer and closer, the Russians were\ncoming closer and closer, and Budapest was encircled. So the siege of Budapest\nwas about, I think, five or six weeks, it was quite long.",
        "A: Twelve years in those days was not really a child. I was very aware of what was\ngoing on, I was very \u2014 was I frightened? I was afraid \u2014 not \u2014 I was afraid because\nalso the gun \u2014 you heard \u2014 by then you were beginning to hear a lot of guns and\nshooting, and there were bombings, the Russians were flying over Budapest with\ntheir planes, and so on. Was I afraid? Yes, I was afraid all the time. My one vivid\nmemory from that time is that that\u2019s when I first got my period. And I didn\u2019t know\nwho to turn to. I didn\u2019t have any kind of protection, and it was horrible. And it \u2014 that\n107March 1, 1999\n\u2014 that I remember very clearly. And then I told \u2014I guess I told my uncle, and he said\nit was normal, and he spoke to this woman there and she gave me some rags, which\nI had to wash out, but they were very hard to keep between my legs, because they\nkept falling out. And that\u2019s my one vivid memory from that period. But was I\nafraid? Yes, I \u2014 but \u2014 but as I said, you were afraid most of the time. I was less\nafraid then that we would be caught or \u2014 or something horrible would happen,\nbecause things were very stable in a way, we \u2014 you know, there was this couple and\nthey took care of us, and they were nice to us, and there was, I guess, enough food.\nIt wasn\u2019t we \u2014 1-it was okay, it was \u2014 it was one of the sort of stable sort of moments.\nWe were not running away, we were not \u2014 it wasn\u2019t \u2014 we were maybe a little lonely,\nbut I don\u2019t remember that so distinctly. I remember being very excited every time\nmy uncle came and \u2014 to see us. And \u2014",
        "A: Right. I don\u2019t remember him being particularly difficult at that point. It was\nprobably very good at that point. We were just on our own, and he didn\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t\nremember him as \u2014 in any way at that point. All I remember is that I was always told\nthat I was the older one, I was the more mature one, and I was sort of looking after\nhim a little, but he \u2014 I don\u2019t remember him being any problem.\n108March 1, 1999",
        "A: Yes, but I was much more dependent on my uncle, I must say. I\u2014I\u2014I felt that \u2014\nthat he was the one who was instrumental in either us surviving or not surviving. He\n\u2014my father, you have to know, was helpless, was sick, and \u2014 at the time, so while I\n\u2014 I thought about them, I don\u2019t remember \u2014 I knew they were in the hospital, my\nuncle told me that they were safe, that they \u2014 this professor was going to keep them\nthere. And so no, the answer is, I wasn\u2019t agonizing over what\u2019s happening to them,\nno. I was more agonizing about my uncle coming and making sure that we all were\nright, because I knew that he \u2014 it was all dependent on him, it was his relationship\nwith these people, 1t was him taking care of us, and he was much more resourceful at\nma \u2014 than my parents were at the time, and he was alone, and he was vital and\ninteresting, and he was a great person.",
        "A: No. No, it was not a warm relationship. I just remember them as being civil and\nnice to us, but it was not a warm, warm relationship, at least not \u2014 not that I am\naware of, no.",
        "A: No, they were a childless couple.\n109March 1, 1999",
        "A: No. No, no schooling whatsoever, zero. Because at that point, this \u2014 much before\nthat, when we were living in the settlement with all the Polish refugees at that point,\nM-Mtrs. Rochinska(ph) was teaching us, but this was \u2014 by then we had lost contact\nwith her, and she probably remained, she was really critch \u2014 Christian. And we\nstarted running a \u2014 from one place to another. No, no schooling whatsoever.",
        "A: Nothing. No, we \u2014 it \u2014I\u2014I-\u2014no, I didn\u2019t feel like \u2014 I don\u2019t think I felt like\nanything in particular, certainly not Hungarian, certainly not Austrian. If anything,\nall through my life, I identify much more with Poland than with any of the other\ncountries, because I know even now, when I pick up a newspaper and there\u2019s\nsomething about Poland, I'll read it, if 1t\u2019s something about Austria, I don\u2019t, and\nsomething about Hungary, also much less. So no, definitely Polish, if anything, yes,\nPolish.",
        "A: That\u2019s a very good question, because I have no recollection what we did. I really\ndon\u2019t know, I think we probably did nothing. I don\u2019t know. I don \u2014 I don\u2019t know\nwhat we did. I don\u2019t know if we played, or talked, or \u2014 or \u2014 I \u2014 I don\u2019t have any\n110March 1, 1999\nrecol \u2014 I think maybe she gave us some little things to do, like little chores and \u2014 I\ndon\u2019t even remember her name. But I don\u2019t remember doing it.",
        "A: None whatsoever, none. Absolutely none, because the idea was that we shouldn\u2019t\nbe seen too much, we \u2014 you know, nobody was exactly very proud of having these\ntwo children suddenly there that she never had before. So we were definitely not \u2014\nno, no contact with other children, I don\u2019t remember any contact with other children.",
        "A: No, I always slept fine, and I don\u2019t remember any frightening nightmares, no, no,\nnone \u2014 none whatsoever. Actually, what I do remember is that we slept \u2014 they had a\nbig bed, and we slept with them in that huge bed.",
        "A: Yeah, all four of us, yeah.",
        "A: Not pleasant. No, I didn\u2019t like that, no, no. Mm-mm.",
        "A: I think lack of room, lack of room. It was a tiny little house, and it was not \u2014 I\nthink it was for lack of room, yeah, but there was absolutely no \u2014 no privacy.\n111March 1, 1999\nEverybody was always touching everybody, I didn\u2019t like that. Yeah, I didn\u2019t like\nthat.",
        "A: Yes. And I remember that, and that was very unpleasant and then I told my\nbrother to sleep next to me, and then there was this mishmash about who was\nsleeping where, and of course she wasn\u2019t aware of it, and so she \u2014 you know, it \u2014 it\nstopped, it wasn\u2019t very long. It just happened once or twice, yeah.",
        "A: No. No, I was much too afraid, no.",
        "A: Then, the most dramatic event I remember was that my uncle told me that he\nwould come and stay with us. We realized that we were being \u2014 that we were\nencircled, and that eventually there will be a fight, and there\u2019Il be a siege. And my\nuncle said that when things get really bad, and the fighting becomes very, you know,\ndangerous, he would come and stay with us. He wasn\u2019t going to leave us there by\nourselves. And that was my biggest concern, that \u2014 that the fighting would start, and\n\u2014 and we would be all alone. And that I was really afraid of. So, I don\u2019t remember\nhow it was, but I do remember that I used to meet my uncle \u2014 there was also another\ndanger, that if somebody \u2014 something suspicious happens, like somebody came to \u2014\n112March 1, 1999\nto ask questions, or to ask why we were there, or who were we, or any kind of police\nvisit or inquiry, I was supposed to warn my uncle, because he was much more\nvulnerable be \u2014 not much more vulnerable, but really vulnerable. In other words, if\nthey were suspicious of us, he didn\u2019t want to come there, because they would arrest\nhim. They would certainly watch him. So \u2014",
        "A: Well, that was \u2014 I knew exactly where he was st \u2014 coming, I knew the route he\nwas taking, and there wa \u2014 there was that streetcar, and he had to get off on the last\nstop of the streetcar and it was near a cemetery, and I knew, you know, I knew the\nneighborhood a little, so I knew how \u2014 and each time, I would meet him there when\nhe came. He would tell me when he is coming and I would wait for him there,\nsometimes for very long periods of time. And when they were already really close\nand were shooting and so on, the last time, before he s \u2014 before he actually remained\nwith us, I went to meet him and he always talked about that. They were actually\nshooting and I was hiding behind \u2014 alongside the graves, because the route took me\nthrough the \u2014 through the cemetery. And I got to the end station where I was\nsupposed to wait for him, but the \u2014 the trams weren\u2019t coming very regularly any\nmore, so I waited there for a very long time, he had to walk part of the way. But he\ncame, and he was always very impressed that I made it to meet him, that I was \u2014 that\n113March 1, 1999\nI was courageous enough to do it. He said no one else, when they were shooting,\nwould have done it, but I was always very reliable and dependable, and at that point\nI certainly was even more so, I imagine. That was what I was \u2014 wanted to do, and\nthat\u2019s what I \u2014 was expected of me, so I did it. Anyway, he came, and then we\ntogether ran back, you know, hiding and falling to the ground. It was the real\nshooting by then. And then he stayed with us. And the \u2014",
        "A: I cannot. As a matter of fact, we went back, my husband and I went to Budapest\nin about 1982 or so, and I tried to ra \u2014 locate the \u2014 the street, and I couldn\u2019t. I\ncouldn\u2019t. I know it was a\u2014a par \u2014 a residential part of Buda, quite \u2014 because Buda,\nth-the \u2014 the lower part of Buda is part of the city, so that\u2019s very much like a city,\nlike Pest, only that it\u2019s the nicer part, it\u2019s the older part of the city. But where we\nwere was a residential part and was a si \u2014 and it was on top of a hill. I remember\nthat, and then there was this \u2014 and it was the last stop of the trolley car. I couldn\u2019t\nremember where it \u2014 I mean, I \u2014 we went there and we walked around and there was\na hill. But what looked to me at that time as a big hill was probably a minute hill.\nAnd so we tried to find it, no, we couldn\u2019t. So I don\u2019t know what part of Budapest.\n114March 1, 1999",
        "A: Never asked him, there was no choice. He just stayed there, and that was it. My\nuncle said that I have to go by myself. I \u2014 was always safer for girls than for boys.",
        "A: Because of the circumcision. If you were caught, for a girl it was much easier\nthan for a boy. So he had to stay home and that \u2014 and also you \u2014 you know, I didn\u2019t\nwant to bother with him; he was younger, he was \u2014 anyhow, it was my job an-and I\nnever thought much about what he felt when he stayed behind. Then we went \u2014 so\nanyway, then we came back, and by that time we no longer stayed in the \u2014 1n the\ncaretaker\u2019s house, because by that time the Germans were really on the run, and\nthere was less danger of being arrested or something by the Germans. They were not\nso much on the run as they were occupied by other things. They were fighting. And\nwe moved into the main house, and my uncle was able to get the old couple, who\nwere actually the antique dealer and his wife, they were in a \u2014 what they called it \u2014\nthey were hidden someplace in Buda \u2014 in \u2014 in Pest, I think. I don\u2019t know exactly,\nbut my uncle was able to get them out to wherever they were, and helped them come\nto our \u2014 come to their \u2014 what was their home, what was their house, and they\nprepared the cellar. And we were all in the cellar of the villa, because that was safer.\n115March 1, 1999\nIt was a real cellar, so it was more like a shelter. And that\u2019s where we were. So it\nwas the old couple, my uncle and the two of us, and the caretaker and his wife\nwould come in there and stay for a while and then go back to their house. They were\nin and out, I remember. There was a Dutch man \u2014 by the way, that\u2019s how we were\nactually able to stay with the caretaker. There was a Dutch man, I think \u2014 well, this\nwill make a lot of sense, I think 1t was Menton(ph). Menton(ph) is a very well-\nknown name because there was a book written about him, and then my uncle, after\nthe war, was in a very controversial situation with him. Menton(ph) lived, or his\nfriend, lived in the villa, and that\u2019s how we were able to stay with the caretaker, and\nthere was no suspic \u2014 I mean, nobody looked at who we were and what we were.\nAnd so \u2014 but by then, Menton(ph) had fled, because he was obviously friendly with\nthe Germans, and he was afraid and I think if he went to Holland \u2014 he \u2014 he was\ngone and the villa was empty. So the rightful owners came back, they were very old.\nAs a matter of fact, she died during the siege. And \u2014 and then \u2014 and we all stayed in\nthe shelter of that \u2014 or in the \u2014 what was the shelter, but what was n-not really a\nshelter, it was just the cellar of the villa. And during the fight \u2014 by then it was\nwinter, because we were liberated in January. So it was freezing cold \u2014\n116March 1, 1999",

        "A: Maybe \u2014 maybe that was not my first one, because I now remember \u2014 no,\nactually I made a mistake, it was not my first one. I did get it then, and what I told\nyou about the rags, I remember, and it was terrible. But I don\u2019t think 1t was my first\none, I think it was my second one, because I did know what it was, and I remember\nthe first one I got, I think when we were in Leanyfalu, where Mrs. Rochinska(ph)\nwas teaching us and there was a relative period of quiet, and I was 11, and that\u2019s\nwhen I got my first period, and I remember I had no clue what it was, and I thought\nthat I had gotten \u2014 what is it called? Not diphtheria, that is \u2014 a disease \u2014",
        "A: I think it\u2019s typhoid where you bleed from the rectum. So I thought I was deadly\nill, and when I saw the blood on the paper and I told my mother and that\u2019s when she\ntold me what it was. So this must have been my second period. And then again, I\ndon\u2019t remember having a period til late \u2014 much later. No, I did not have any. So we\nstayed, all of us in that cellar, and I don\u2019t remember what we ate, but I remember\nthere wasn\u2019t terribly much. Mostly I think potatoes, from what I remember, and I\n117March 1, 1999\ndon\u2019t remember how it was prepared, I don\u2019t \u2014 there was a little stove, little\nprimos(ph) what was called a little, I guess a little with kerosene or something, a\nlittle stove, and I think we had mostly potatoes. And \u2014",
        "A: That\u2019s a good question. I had a watch that my uncle gave me, that Brenda has\ntoday, that my uncle gave me for my, I guess 11\" or 12\" birthday, I don\u2019t remember\nwhich one, but it was during the war. Must have been 11\". And I absolutely loved\nthat watch. That watch was my prime possession, it was sign of maturity, it was\neverything, a symbol of everything. And I always wore it, of course, and that watch\nI liked a lot. And then when the Russians did occupy us \u2014 I\u2019Il go back to that, but\none of the things that I remember vividly is that my uncle realized \u2014 I didn\u2019t know\nabout it, but he knew that they were raping women, and they were actually no \u2014 not\na very kind liberators, but \u2014 and it was rough, and he wanted to protect me, so he\ntold me that \u2014 they also used to be crazy about watches, they took watches by the\ndozen and they would line them up on their arms, and \u2014 from the wrist up, and they\n\u2014 that was sort of like their status symbol as \u2014 as to how many they could get. It was\nreally weird that \u2014 how they focused on the watches. So my uncle told me that, you\nknow, if I wanted to protect my watch and not have them take it, and Ill \u2014 he knew I\n118March 1, 1999\nloved that watch, then I would have to hide under the bed. And that\u2019s what I did.\nAnd that I remember distinctly, that every time we heard steps on top, I would run\nand hide under the bed with my watch on my wrist.",
        "A: No, he didn\u2019t tell me, he just told me that I had to protect my watch, if I wanted \u2014\nso that\u2019s \u2014 he \u2014 I had no clue as to why he was so concerned, but I \u2014 but I believed\nhim, you know, that that was the thing, they were robbing and that\u2019s what was the\nthing. The other thing I remember distinctly is that the \u2014 they \u2014 the Russians je \u2014\nsince it was a fighting situation, there was a fight going on, he \u2014 [phone ringing] \u2014\nso they would \u2014 th-the Russians, because it wou \u2014 they were fighting, I guess, to\nmake sure that they survive, they would \u2014 wou \u2014 throw grenades into cellars before\nthey came in, because that way they would be sure that it wasn\u2019t some Germans,\nwho would shoot at them when they started coming down. So the big danger was\nthat they would do that. So every time we heard steps on top, I went under the bed\nwith my watch and \u2014 bed, it was a kind of cot, and my uncle would run up the steps\nand scream in Russian, you know, the \u2014 we \u2014 there are just children here, and we are\nfriends and so on. Don\u2019t \u2014 don\u2019t kill, don\u2019t shoot, don\u2019t \u2014 and he would make a \u2014 he\nwould talk to them and \u2014 and they never did, obviously, otherwise we wouldn\u2019t have\nsurvived. And he would \u2014 and then, you know, they would go away, they would \u2014\n119March 1, 1999\nno, I don\u2019t remember them ever \u2014 they would come down and look around and see\nthat ever \u2014 you know, that there are no \u2014 that no Germans are hiding, and they would\njust go away and that was the end. But this happened a couple of times, about I\nwould say three or four times it happened. And then, as they occupied more and\nmore of the city, and we also knew already that Pest had fallen, Pest \u2014 they \u2014 the\nGermans did not defend Pest like Buda. They gave that up and they went in \u2014 they \u2014\nbecause Buda had a hill and a castle, they occupied that, and from there they were\ndefending themselves. From the castle, so they \u2014 they were in Buda much longer.\nAnd \u2014",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember. I \u2014 all I remember being concerned about, and \u2014 and knowing\nwas how the front was progressing. In other words, both the \u2014 the \u2014 you know, the\ninvasion in \u2014 in Normandy, | knew that the Americans had invaded Europe on the\nother side, and the Russians were coming on this side and eventually they would\nliberate us. I knew the Germans were losing the war. I knew that, but what exactly\nwas happening in other countries? No, I don\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t think I was too concerned\n120March 1, 1999\nabout that. I think we were really focused on ourselves, totally and completely. We\ncouldn\u2019t really care what happened anywhere else, it was \u2014 and at least \u2014",
        "A: No, didn\u2019t know anything about the Warsaw ghetto, didn\u2019t know anything about\n\u2014 I knew that they were deporting people to camps. I don\u2019t think that I knew too\nmuch \u2014 I knew that it was bad. I knew that \u2014 that they were killing people, I knew\nthat \u2014 but the exact \u2014 I think I knew that they have gas chambers. I knew that \u2014 that\nbeing deported was the end. That I knew. But I didn\u2019t know exactly about the\nuprising and so on. Don\u2019t forget that the uprising was probably not described in the\npress, and we didn\u2019t have foreign fr \u2014 foreign press, and I don\u2019t even remember\nseeing \u2014 I could read, and I could read Hungarian as well. So I remember he \u2014\nreading headlines in the Hungarian newspaper, because she bought the newspaper,\nthe woman where we were hiding. But I don\u2019t rec \u2014 they certainly wouldn\u2019t write\nabout that, so \u2014 I just know that we were \u2014 knew the \u2014 how the \u2014 the Russian forces\nwere advancing, and that was our prime concern, you know, how quickly will this\nbe over. And so after we were occupied and were safe, basically for \u2014 safe in the\nsense that \u2014 that no Germans would come and get us, for a few days, and more and\nmore of the area was liberated, we heard that most of Buda was liberated, and the\nconditions in the cellar deteriorated. I mean, she died. She was buried in \u2014 in \u2014 the\n121March 1, 1999\nowner\u2019s wife, the old lady, and I remember we buried her in the garden in the\nmiddle of the night. And that was before we were liberated. And I also remember\nthat the ground was terribly, terribly hard, because it was winter, it was all frozen.",
        "A: Yes. I never knew any other dead body, but she was very old, and I don\u2019t\nremember being very upset. I was only very upset about having to bury her and\ndoing this whole thing, because that was scarier, to go up and \u2014 and \u2014 and be outside\nof the cellar and \u2014 and \u2014 and bury her and get \u2014 get her out of the cellar.",
        "A: Yeah, I did help. I did help dig the hole. And so at \u2014 and also, food was getting\nshorter, and it was cold. I mean, the conditions were very, very horrible. So my\nuncle decided, when he heard that more and more of Buda was liberated and Pest\nwas already occupied by the Russians, and we knew also, because we heard that the\nbur \u2014 bridges had all been exploded, because the Germans, when they retreated to \u2014\nto Buda, they \u2014 they explo \u2014\nEnd of Tape Four, Side A\nBeginning Tape Four, Side B\n122March 1, 1999",
        "A: So we \u2014 we knew some people who were living close to the Danube, and so my\nuncle decided to leave our cellar and to try to get over to these other people\u2019s house,\nand see what\u2019s happening to them, and also try to get closer to the Danube to cross\nthe Danube, and \u2014 and meet my parents, and get us across to my parents. And that\u2019s\nwhat we did, and that\u2019s what I remember as the most vivid and horrible thing,\nbecause th-there was snow on the ground, and there were dead bodies all over, beca\n\u2014 and dead horses. And dead horses had these wide open eyes, and so we had to s \u2014\nliterally step over these dead bodies; dead Germans, dead Russians and dead horses.\nAnd we finally got to their house \u2014",
        "A: I \u2014it\u2019s hard for me t-to talk in greater detail except that I was \u2014 it was \u2014 it was\nfrightening, it was like a nightmare. And we had to \u2014 it was physically also difficult,\nyou had to get over these things and it was slippery and we didn\u2019t have the best\nshoes and it was cold. It was all those things, and I remember that as being one of\nthe most horrible walks, so to speak, that I ever took. But anyway, we \u2014 and that \u2014",
        "A: No, there was nothing to ask. I mean, I knew it was the aftermath of a battle, and\ndid he comfort us? No, because he was equally as upset as \u2014 you know, it was\n123March 1, 1999\nequally ha \u2014 people in tho \u2014 at least my \u2014 my experience was that except for my\nmother occasionally, when they were \u2014 when we were in jail, and things were sort of\nstatic, this was not static, you had to move. It\u2019s like \u2014 it\u2019s like comforting a child\nwho got up on top of a hill and doesn\u2019t know how to ski down. So you comforted,\nyou \u2014 you \u2014 you \u2014 but you have to get down. So that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s more or less\n[indecipherable] I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good analogy, but there wasn\u2019t time to talk.\nThere was \u2014 you had to move, you had to \u2014 you had to walk, and it was at night, and\nit was dark, and it was hard. But he \u2014 I guess he pushed us. He \u2014 I don\u2019t know what\nhe did, I don\u2019t remember, but all I remember is that that was a very difficult,\nmiserable walk. And then we got to their house, and they had been liberated for a\nfew days also, and they were still in the cellar, because most people s \u2014 remained\nthere. There was no pl \u2014 mu \u2014 many of the houses on top were destroyed. Or it was\nfreezing cold, 1t was warmer in the cellar. So they were down below, and there was\nhardly any room for us, but somehow we \u2014 of course, we had to stay there, so we\nstayed there. But the worst thing was that during the night, the Germans broke out\nfrom the castle, and it was \u2014 that was the last \u2014 they were encircled and that was the\nlast time they broke out and that they made any stand, and that they re-occupied our\nhouse. And that was terrible. And they took out all the men in our cellar and they \u2014\nat \u2014 these were people that my uncle knew and I don\u2019t remember who they were. All\n124March 1, 1999\nI remember is that they went \u2014 they made all the men go upstairs and they killed\nthree of them while we were there. Now, how my uncle escaped being killed, I don\u2019t\nremember. I don\u2019t think he went up with them. They said, all the inhabitants 1n this\nhouse have to come upstairs \u2014 all the men. And so they did, and they killed them.\nThis was in the last minute, we were only occupied for another few hours. And then\nthe Russians advanced, and the Germans \u2014 you know, it was like a last desperate\nattempt on their part, and it was horrible that we ha \u2014 we were there. And \u2014",
        "A: Yes, oh yes, I heard the shots, and then I heard, you know, the despair of th-the\nwives, and you know. And my uncle, I don\u2019t remember how he \u2014 whether he hid, or\nwhether he didn\u2019t go up. I remember only that three of them were killed, and he was\nvery upset by that, because it was in the last minute, you know, it was such a\nhorrible thing that you had to \u2014 that \u2014 that that\u2019s what happened at the end. And then\nwe were re-occupied by the Russians, and we didn\u2019t stay after that, we just went as\nfar as the Danube. We tried to cross over and my uncle \u2014 by then I remember he\nsort of used us, my brother and me, you know. Here we were these children, and the\nparents were on the other side and so on. So because there was a har \u2014 a priority for\npeople crossing, there was a pontoon bridge by then. And they didn\u2019t want civilians\ncrossing back and forth, I mean, this was still wartime. So he, you know, by saying\n125March 1, 1999\nthese are the paren \u2014 the parents are over there and these are the children and so on,\nthey let us \u2014 he convinced them. And what we had to do was go from boat to boat,\nbecause this was a pontoon bridge, and they needed people to get the water out of\nthese little boats, because these boats kept leaking, and they were filling up with\nwater. So it took us hours and hours, because we were going from one boat to the\nnext, slowly crossing that bridge and helping get the water out of the boats. And\nthen the next dramatic thing was that we go to Buda and we went straight to the\nhospital, and they had on the gate, they had a list of people who had survived, and\nmy parents were not on it. And then I remember we got a terrible shock and started\nscreaming and yelling. And it turned out that the reason there \u2014 they had survived,\nthe reason the list \u2014 they were not on that list was because the list was of people who\nwere still there, who had survived were \u2014 and were in the hospital. And my parents,\nbecause they were there only mainly because of being hidden there, the minute the\nRussians occupied Pest, they left and went to some friends\u2019 house. We knew where\nto look for them, and we came there and \u2014\n126March 1, 1999",
        "A: I guess I did as much as I could. I don\u2019t know how much strength I had. Maybe \u2014\nmaybe it wasn\u2019t, you know, as \u2014 as efficient as it was supposed to be, but that\u2019s what\nwe were told to do, and there were these containers and we took the water. Maybe\nthe containers were not that big, maybe they had small and bigger containers. I don\u2019t\nremember that, but I do remember doing it, yes. It was hard. It was hard. Everything\nthat \u2014 those last few days were very, very hard. Was hard. And then the emotio \u2014 by\nthen the \u2014 I also remember the emotional stress, because by then we knew we are\ngoing over, and we are going to now be reunited with my parents, and while I wasn\u2019t\nthinking about them maybe continuously all the time, this was a very exciting\nmoment for us, and I remembered that. And I do remember when we didn\u2019t see their\nnames on that list; 1t was horrifying, and we were crying and we were screaming and\nI\u2014 my uncle said, you know, let \u2014 you know, don\u2019t cry, and everything will \u2014 will be\nall right, and let me ask and see what happened, and so on, so forth. So then we went\ninside and we spoke to \u2014 1t was run by nuns and we spoke to \u2014 to whoever was in the\noffice there, and they told us where my parents went, that they had left the hospital.",
        "A: No, we did not have. During the whole siege, I told you was th \u2014 we had great\nshortages, I mean, I don\u2019t even remember what we ate, but I remember that we \u2014\nthere was very little to eat.\n127March 1, 1999",
        "A: Yes, yes. And I don\u2019t remember ever taking a bath or \u2014 oh, I do remember that\nwe were full of lice, and that we were \u2014 that \u2014 that kept us, by the way, quite busy,\nbecause we used to sit there and take our clothes off and kill the lice, one by one \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 between the nails of the two thumbs. That was a great occupation, you did it for\nhours and hours. And the problem is that you could never kill the eggs, and the eggs\nthen would develop, and there would be new lice. But the lice were horrible because\nthey were biting, and it was itching and it was horrible, yeah. So we were full of\nlice, full of lice. So when we got to there, where they were, everybody was in bad\nshape, because there was no food, there were terrible shortages, people were sick,\nfull of lice. And that\u2019s when we left, we left right after that, bec \u2014 we went to the\nsouth of Hungary, to a place called Mako, I think.",
        "A: Oh, that was very exciting, that was very exciting. We came there, my mother\nhugged us and kissed us and cried, and there was a lot of commotion. And it was\nquite a \u2014 quite a reunion. That was very, very exciting. Very exciting.\n128March 1, 1999",
        "A: Not as bad as we, because they had been liberated for at least two or \u2014 two weeks\nalready, and not that there was any abundance, because as I said, the c \u2014 the \u2014 the\nconditions were very hard. But I don\u2019t think they was in as bad a condition as we\nwere, because they \u2014 even the hospital, th-there was more hygiene and more food. I\ndon\u2019t think they had plenty, but there wa \u2014 I mean, they took care of the sick people,\nthey gave them a soup every day. No one was taking care of us. So I remember that\nthey were \u2014 and sh \u2014 my mother talked about it later, that they were appalled at, you\nknow, very upset by the way we both looked, and how \u2014 in what terrible shape we\nwere In.",
        "A: Probably awful. And I remember they \u2014 they \u2014 the first thing they did also, we\nhad a lot of lice in our hair, and they cut off all my hair and they washed it with\nsome sort of kerosene and it smelled and burned and so on. So I remember that.\nHow did I look? Probably dirty, and ragged, and I don\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t have a clear\npicture of what we looked like, but probably awful. I don\u2019t remember that.",
        "A: No. No, I don\u2019t remember. All I remember is that they kept saying we have to get\nout of here as fast as possible, because they \u2014 there was sickness, there was \u2014 we \u2014 I-\n129March 1, 1999\nI just remember primary concern about surviving this next danger, which was\nsickness, and \u2014 and you know, when there\u2019s no food, an-and hygiene conditions are\nso terrible, and there\u2019s a lot of illness around, it spreads. And so all I remember is\nthem saying that we have to get out of there as quickly as possible, and that\u2019s what\nwe did.",
        "A: Ye-Yes, in that respect we did. I mean, we knew that the Germans were gone,\nthat nobody was going to deport us. But don\u2019t forget that the Russians and the chaos\nthat was right after liberation. It was not paradise. It was far from it. You didn\u2019t\nknow whether the Russians wouldn\u2019t grab you. Russians also did things that \u2014\nunexpected things. They either arrested you, or they decided you were a capitalist. I\nmean, we had experience with the Russians, we had been with them. So we knew\nwhat they were like. So it wasn\u2019t like it was paradise, plus the physical conditions,\nwhich were so bad. And the cold, 1t was the middle of winter, was January. So it\nwasn\u2019t like you know, now you\u2019re free, and you begin to live. As a matter of fact, to\ndigress a little, I understand there\u2019s a new documentary called \u201cThe Last Days,\u201d\nwhich I understand deals a lot with the aftermath, what happens right after. Because\nit wasn\u2019t that simple, it didn\u2019t just end and then everything was fine. There were\ndecisions to be made, where to go, what to do. I also remember that when you \u2014 that\n130March 1, 1999\nI felt that when you only survive \u2014 when your goal is to survive, you have more of a\ndirection than after the war, when you \u2014 when it\u2019s no longer just to survive, but\nwhere to go, how to survive, what to do with your life. When you\u2019re only trying to\nsave your life, your \u2014 your way of thinking is very, very different. So I almost\nremember a certain, like a lack of direction, like a certain, you know, let down\nalmost. It\u2019s like \u2014 it\u2019s like after a party. You look forward to it like I don\u2019t know\nwhat, and then afterwards you sort of, where do you go from here? That\u2019s the kind\nof thing I remember. And also the discussions; where to go, what to do. So finally\nthey decided to go to the south of Hungary. And for me, at that point also was a\nvery big disappointment, because my uncle, whom I worshipped, decided that he\nwas done with us. He \u2014 he knew his family had survived. They had gone from\nSiberia to Palestine. He had \u2014 he had a goal, he was going to Palestine to be\nreunited with his family. So he, at that point, decided to leave us. And he was going\nto go to Romania, and from Romania I think there were boats already going to\nPalestine somehow. And I wanted to go with him. I didn\u2019t \u2014 I really wanted to go\nwith him. I would have gone with him to the end of the world. And that I remember\nas being very traumatic, and he talked to me and told me that I couldn\u2019t go with him\nbecause I wasn\u2019t his child, and he had his own children and all of that was very hard\nfor me to take. And also, I felt that he had more direction, he knew what he was\n131March 1, 1999\ngoing to do, while my father did not. And so of course, he left and I felt very\nabandoned, very abandoned. And not only I, but our whole, family, because he was\nthe resourceful one. And while my father di \u2014 was a wonderful man, but it \u2014 for\npeace time. He was not very good during the war. I mean, for \u2014 for these very\ndifficult conditions. Not difficult, where you really couldn\u2019t just go a straight line,\nmy father was a straight, very straight person. So anyway, my father da \u2014 so we\nwent south, and I don\u2019t remember how we traveled. I think \u2014 I don\u2019t remember, you\nknow, all I remember is that in the south of Hungary, we stayed on a farm with\nsome people, and \u2014 Hungarians. And it was wonderful, because it was \u2014 it was\nspring by then. And we stayed there through the spring, and it \u2014 I think through the\nspring. Maybe for \u2014 for a month or six weeks. And there were animals. I remember I\nlearned how to cut the wool off \u2014 they had angora rabbits, and so they taught me\nhow to do that. That\u2019s sort of nice, and then how to weave. I could weave yarn. They\nhad a spindle, or whatever it\u2019s called, and I could weave angora into wool; I was\nvery good. Anything with my hands, I was very good at. And actually I had my first\nromance there, there was a boy of 17 or 16, he was much ol \u2014 and he was on the\nneighboring farm, and I learned how to ride a bike at that point, because he taught\nme how to ride a bike. And there was a little river where we used to go and walk\nalong and look at pebbles, and do things. So that was very nice there. During that\n132March 1, 1999\ntime my father went back to Poland, to Krakow, because he thought that he would\nbe able to go back there and resume life there. He did not want to go to Palestine, he\nwas never a Zionist, and he also knew that conditions in Palestine were very bad.\nAnd he was a banker, and I remember he even \u2014 I remember his words. He used to\nsay that the German bankers, there were many German bankers, much more\nprominent, who had gone there in the 30s and were still walking around with a cane.\nYou know, with a little walking stick, because they had nothing to do, and \u2014 and so\nhe felt that he couldn\u2019t \u2014 wouldn\u2019t want to go there, he couldn\u2019t make a living there.\nHe could also not even contribute anything to the country, because he didn\u2019t have a\n\u2014 that kind of a skill. So Palestine was out. He thought that he could go back to\nPoland. The reason he thought he could go back to Poland is because there was a\ngovernment in exile in \u2014 in London, headed by Mikolajczyk was his name, and my\nfather thought that it was going to be a democratic Poland, and he thought he could\nrepossess whatever he had, and start life again. He was robbed on the train going\nthere. He got to Krakow and he saw the Russians had occupied Poland, and\n[indecipherable] but of course, conditions were much better already. But he saw\nthat there was no one to talk to, that that \u2014 no one was \u2014 you know, he would have to\ndeal with the Russians. Anyhow, he came to the conclusion he couldn\u2019t do it. So he\ncame back to \u2014 to Mako and he decided that we should go to Vienna, which was\n133March 1, 1999\nactually, in the long run, a good decision, because he had a great deal of property in\nVienna. Vienna had just been liberated, and Vienna was in four occupational\nzones. And he would establish the fact that he survived, claim whatever he had\nclaims on, and he thought maybe there. So that I remember, we went back to\nBudapest and from Budapest we took a train. And by then there was a train going,\nbut there were like millions of people on the station, everybody had bundles and it\nwas cold and it \u2014 it was horrible. It was really quite difficult.",
        "A: We \u2014I knew a lot about him, I had heard about him, because my uncle kept\ntalking about him, and he tried to get into those houses. My \u2014 my uncle tried\neverything, and he was aware, but we didn\u2019t qualify, so we couldn\u2019t get into one of\nthose ha \u2014 those houses, because we were \u2014 had Christian papers. We actually had\npapers, and they didn\u2019t \u2014 they were taking Hungarian Jews who had no other identit\n\u2014 so we did not \u2014 there was no way they were going to take us. And we were not\neven Hungarian. So, you know, if \u2014 if \u2014 1f \u2014 even if \u2014 1f Wallenberg himself would\nhave agreed to take us, the other Hungarians would have been very upset by us,\n134March 1, 1999\nbecause there were mi \u2014 lines and lines of people waiting for that, 1t was like a safe\nhaven. Yes, we knew about him, yes.",
        "A: Yes, very, very quickly, because the \u2014 as I said, the conditions in the country\nwere good. We had food, we had a room, we had \u2014 you know, my parents had a\u2014a\n\u2014asi\u2014aroom. It was a farmhouse, and so yes, very quickly.",
        "A: No, no. No, we never talked about. I mean, maybe we talked about it, th \u2014 you\nknow, the siege, and in the cellar, yes, we talked about that. But I don\u2019t think that we\ndwelled on what we went through. I mean, that wasn\u2019t what \u2014 what this was all\nabout. It was getting \u2014 lo-looking forward, and I think we talked a lot. I remember,\nyou know, my \u2014 about I had to start going to school some point. I was very\nconcerned about that, you know. And \u2014 and where are we going next, and \u2014 and we\ntalked more about that than what we went through actually, because that was not\nvery relevant at the moment, it was over. I mean, you didn\u2019t want to, didn\u2019t get you\nanywhere. So I don\u2019t remember talking a lot about what we went through or not, no.\n135March 1, 1999",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so. I think my father did. I think we went down there, looked ar \u2014\nlooked \u2014 I don\u2019t remember the details. I don\u2019t even remember how we got there,\nwhether it was by train, or \u2014 must have been by train, because th-the \u2014 the \u2014\nprobably the \u2014 the trains were already running. Or by truck? I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t\nknow, but it must have been my \u2014 my father, because my uncle was gone by then.\nHe was gone, he \u2014 he left right away. So, then we aw \u2014 took this horrible train ride\nto Vienna, and we arrived in Vienna and we went to where my parents ho-home\nwas. My parents lived in a townhouse, on three floors, like the little townhouses in\nNew York. And again, there was a caretaker in the basement, and she was a woman\nwho, of course, remembered my parents, wasn\u2019t that long, and my father decided \u2014\nhe stayed for a while, went around to all kinds of lawyers and things, and again,\nconditions in Vienna were very, very bad. Now, I remember it being cold, and that\u2019s\nwhy I\u2019m confused. It must have been like March, maybe. Because I remember it\nbeing cold. So I think it was something like March, 1945. It was just be \u2014 just bef \u2014",
        "A: Well, that\u2019s just it. We were liberated in January. We went down soon after, so I\nthink we might have been like, you know, end of January, four weeks in February\nand in March we got to \u2014 to Vienna. Because it was still cold, and they decided, or I\n136March 1, 1999\ndecide \u2014 everybody decided I was going to go to school, and my brother was going\nto go to school. Pro \u2014 but the main reason for going to school was food, because\nthere was the United Nations, UNRRA provided soup for children in school. So we\nhad one hot meal. One day it was bean soup, and one day it was pea soup, I\nremember it alternated. Now, the 1\u2014 I remember the school as being very interesting\nbecause I spoke German, but I didn\u2019t know very well how \u2014 I \u2014 I knew how to read\nand write. But \u2014",
        "A: Read and write period. Some language. I knew how to read and write in \u2014 in\nPolish, which is what I learned. But if you know how to read and write in one\nlanguage, and it\u2019s Latin characters, you can figure it out. And I knew how to speak\nGerman. So I knew how to read and write in German, more or less.",
        "A: I learned Hungarian, fry \u2014 ha \u2014 but only by ear, just for \u2014 and both my brother\nand I spoke excellent Hungarian, and we spoke to each other Hungarian, because\nthat was the goal of our being there, because the whole version of us being with\nthese people in \u2014 in \u2014 in Buda was that we were some relatives, and that they didn\u2019t\nwant us to be in the center of town, so this was a little outside, so it was less likely to\nbe bombed, and that was always \u2014 or visiting relatives, so the per \u2014 so we did have\n137March 1, 1999\nto speak Hungarian to each other, we didn\u2019t run around speaking Polish. So\n[indecipherable]",
        "A: Yes, always in Polish. So we got \u2014 when we got to Austria \u2014 to \u2014 to Vienna, the\nhouse, the building where we lived, or the hou \u2014 townhouse, was in the \u2014 in the\nBritish zone, which was one of the better zones to be in. And the city was divided, as\nI said, and I remember only that my father took me to the lawyer, and gave me a\npower of attorney, which was terribly imp \u2014 I was very impressed with that, because\nhe \u2014 he \u2014 they were going to go back to Poland, my parents, and they decided they\nwere going to leave us, because they still thought they could maybe make it there.\nAnd also, they also half-heartedly by then decided that they would emigrate. And\nthe only place where we could go would be \u2014 you\u2019re going to \u2014 [break]",
        "A: My parents decided to go back to Poland because in order for us to emigrate, we\ndid need to emigrate from Poland. We were Polish citizens and that\u2019s what the law\nwas at the time. From Vienna we could not go anywhere. We also needed to see\nwhere we could go, where we could get visas, and start applying for them, and all of\nthis had to be done from Poland, because we were Polish citizens. And, so my\nparents decided that they would establish the fact that they survived, and claim\n138March 1, 1999\nproperty in Vienna that they had before the war. And in order to establish the fact\nthat they had survived, they were going to leave my brother and me in Vienna,\nbecause there were papers to be signed, and you know, it was proof that we \u2014 that\nwe were alive and had claims. Because of that, my father took me to the lawyer and\ngave me a power of attorney, and every once in a while the lawyer would come and\nget me to sign some papers. I also had my fathe \u2014",
        "A: Even though I was a minor, because I guess I \u2014 I\u2014 it was some sort of paper\ndeclaring that that\u2019s \u2014 that I was empowered to do it because my parents couldn\u2019t be\nthere, or whatever. I was very impressed with that. I also had plenty of money, my\nfather left me money, because he left. And there was nothing to buy with the money,\nbecause there were horrendous shortages, but horrendous in Vienna. You actually y-\nyou know, tha \u2014 everything was on coupons and so on. We ate with this woman who\ntook care of the house, and \u2014",
        "A: No. No. Well, yes and no. In some ways yes, on the other hand, I knew that there\nwas no imminent danger any more, nobody was going to take us anywhere. We\nlived in the British zone, which was fairly civilized. Altogether, Vienna was\ncivilized at that point. It was occupy \u2014 it was an occupied city, there was order.\n139March 1, 1999\nThere was a lot of military on the street, but there was order. No, I was not afraid, I\nwas, in a way lonely. It was miserable, because my brother, I don\u2019t know whether he\nwent to school or not, but very soon after that, he got very sick. He had a \u2014 an\nabscess on his neck, I remember like today, and he started running a fever, and it\nwas full of pus. And I didn\u2019t know what to do with that. So what I did was, I took\nhim \u2014 would be interesting to see what he remembers, I took him to the Polish\ncommittee, because they \u2014 the \u2014 I knew that Poland was repatriating, they wanted\nall Polish citizens to go back to Poland, that was after the war. There was a\nrepatriation effort. And I found a\u2014 somebody who was willing to take him by \u2014 who\nwas going by car to Krakow, it wasn\u2019t \u2014 you know, Vienna and Krakow is not that\nfar apart. And he took him. And so, because I w \u2014 I was afraid to stay with him any\nlonger, because he was so sick, I didn\u2019t know what to do with him. So I send him\nhome sick, and my parents got him. And then I stayed on probably another month or\nfive weeks. And \u2014",
        "A: It was hard to be by myself, and it was hard altogether. I was \u2014 it was not an easy\ntime. But wa \u2014 one funny incident \u2014 not funny, but interesting incident I remember\nbefore my brother left, when he was still well. Since I had so much money, and there\nwas nothing to buy with it really, the theater was active in \u2014 in Vienna. So I decided\n140March 1, 1999\nthat we should go to the theater. I had never been to a theater, but \u2014 so I\u2014 we got\ntickets, or I got tickets, and I went. And they were doing \u201cMedea.\u201d Does he\nremember that? Yes. And I took \u2014 and we went to see \u201cMedea.\u201d And I \u2014 to this day,\nyou know, there I was, I had no clue what this was all about, except that there was\nthis mother who had ki \u2014 was kill \u2014 at the end kills those two children. And we had\njust survived, and I knew that my mother did everything to save us. I couldn\u2019t\nunderstand for the world of me, ho \u2014 why would a mother kill two children? And I\nremember I cried a lot during that play. That was very \u2014 it was probably very well\ndone; the theater in Vienna was very, very good. So that I remember vividly, that\nwas before he left. Then he left, and I was by myself, and I didn\u2019t like the woman\nwe stayed with, I didn\u2019t \u2014 it was not \u2014 it was not very pleasant, yes, it was lonely. By\nthat time it was lonely. Also, the school was very difficult because they didn\u2019t have\nany textbooks. That was very interesting. They were not allowed to use any of the\nNazi period textbooks because they all had some element of propaganda in them,\neven the math books, you know, had things like how \u2014 how many Jews if you \u2014\nEnd of Tape Four, Side B\n141March 1, 1999\nBeginning Tape Five, Side A",
        "A: So, they were not allowed to use in the schools in Vienna after the war, any of\nthe German textbooks, which meant that everything was dictated to us. And it was\nso cold in the ca \u2014 in the classrooms, that we had to have gloves on to \u2014 to \u2014 to write,\nand it was very difficult, I remember that was very difficult, and it was difficult for\nme to write dictation, because also my German wasn\u2019t that good. But I did\nsomehow, but the main reason why we weren\u2019t \u2014 why I was, I don\u2019t remember if my\nbro \u2014 I think my brother also must have gone, was that we got food, that we got the\nsoup, that was the main reason to be there, because I don\u2019t remember learning a\nwhole lot there. And then afterwards, one day a man came to us, and told me \u2014\nintroduced himself and told me that my parents said that he should bring me back to\nKrakow. And he didn\u2019t have a piece of paper, anything written, and I was a little bit\nleery of going with him, because my parents said that I had to wait until I heard from\nthem, you know, that I had \u2014 that was my \u2014 my assignment. And I \u2014 and \u2014 but he\nconvinced me. And I must have been very lonely, because I was happy to go. And I\nwent, and I \u2014 the \u2014 he \u2014 and I later found out that he was doing what most people\n142March 1, 1999\nwere doing then, smuggling. And my parents \u2014 he knew my parents and they asked\nhim if he would bring me back, because by then my parents had the Brazilian visas.\nWe knew we were going to Brazil. At least they knew, I didn\u2019t. And they needed\nme to come back to Poland. And they asked him, because they knew he was doing\nthat, he was going back and forth, had he had a car. But he told them that he\nwouldn\u2019t have room for me, and s \u2014 that he wouldn\u2019t be able to do it. And that\u2019s why\nthey never gave him a piece of paper to \u2014 to te \u2014 a letter for me, that I was supposed\nto come. So \u2014 but then he found that he had room. [break \u2014 doorbell] So he\ndiscovered that he would have room for me, and not only would he have room for\nme, but apparently it was to his advantage, because if he traveled with a girl, or a\nchild or whatever, he was less suspicious than he would have been. And that\u2019s why\nhe decided he was going to take me after all. So he came, he contacted me, and I\nwent. And we stop \u2014 we drove to Brno, we stopped in bro \u2014 Brno, which is\nCzechoslovakia at that time. And he \u2014 we stayed in a hotel, he took a room for me,\nand treated me very well, I liked that he was a very nice man. And he told me to\ncome downstairs and we were going to have dinner. And there was this restaurant, it\nwas like a pensionne. And I had a goose, he ordered a goose, and I\u2019Il never forget\nthat goose as long as I live, was the best dinner I ever had, was wonderful. And then\nwe slept, and the next morning we went on to Krakow. My parents, I remember,\n143March 1, 1999\nwere very excited to see me, very happy, because they didn\u2019t expect that I was\ncoming at all, so that was a very happy reunion.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t own very much, yes, I [indecipherable]",
        "A: A bundle, I don\u2019t know. A few \u2014 I suppose sweaters, I don\u2019t know. I have no\nidea, I don\u2019t remember. It was not a big \u2014 I didn\u2019t spend lots of time packing, like I\ndo now. No, I don\u2019t remember that. Little something. And they lived in a house in\nthe office of a distant relative. We couldn\u2019t get back into our apartment, which was a\ngovernment office, actually, it was a biological institute, I found out. And my\nmother had reopened and was running the gallery, the antique gallery that my uncle\nand my grandfather owned. And it was a fairly sort of normal existence, except that\nwe, of course, we \u2014 again we didn\u2019t go to school, and we were used mainly to walk\nfrom our \u2014 where we lived to \u2014 to the store, sit in the store. One day a week the\nbeggars came to \u2014 to \u2014 because then all the businesses sort of have this as a custom\nin Poland, still is, where, so that you don\u2019t have to deal with beggars e-every single\nday, you used to tell them to come on Fridays. So my job was to sit next to the door,\nthe entrance to this gallery and tell the beggars to come back on Friday. I remember\nthat like today. And I wasn\u2019t very well for some reason, I don\u2019t know why. Maybe I\n144March 1, 1999\nwas run down when I came, because I remember that mi \u2014 I went to a doctor and I\nhad like a general check-up. And he told my mother that I was fine, and as soon as I\njust lived, you know, had more food and so on, I would be fine, and I was fine.\nBasically I was very healthy.",
        "A: This was \u2014 we left in July, so this must \u2014 must have been like June. I wasn\u2019t there\nvery long, May or June, end of May or June, it was warm already. And I just sat in\nthe store, watched my mother talk to people and ran errands and that\u2019s about it. We\nwere, at that time, reunited with my grandfather, who had survived in Siberia, and\nhe came ba \u2014 and my aunt, my mother\u2019s older sister, and we all lived together at the\nsame time, in the same place.",
        "A: \u2019'm not a very warm person. I keep thinking even now, you know, and \u2014 it was\nfine, you know, and my grandfather was a nice man, he was quiet. What I do\nremember 1s that I, for the first time, I found about Jewish things, because my\ngrandfather ate kosher, and so did my aunt. And I remember that when I get \u2014 got\nback from Vienna, my mother showed me, there was this one shelf of a few cups\nand things, and she told me not to touch those, because those were my grandfather\u2019s\ndishes and I wasn\u2019t supposed to touch them. But I still didn\u2019t have a clear picture as\n145March 1, 1999\nto exactly why, but I remember that he was a very nice man, and my aunt was very\nnice, and again, my concerns were different. They were there, 1t was crowded. My\nparents slept \u2014 this was a \u2014 the office of a cousin of my father\u2019s, and he \u2014 this cousin\nhad imports of watches, he was an importer of watches from Switzerland, and \u2014\nbefore the war. And so I remember my parents had a war \u2014 it was like a wardrobe, a\n\u2014 or a gr \u2014 big cabinet, not a wardrobe, a big cabinet that was put down on the floor,\nand they slept on that. So you know, it was crowded in there, and then my\ngrandfather was there and my brother, and we slept \u2014 I think we slept on chairs that\nwere put together. It was not very comfortable, there was \u2014 so I don\u2019t \u2014 you know, it\nwasn\u2019t like you were happy to see your grandfather. In a way it was almost \u2014 he had\n\u2014 he occupied the only bed that was there, so it wasn\u2019t so wonderful. And then, a\nlittle while later, we were ready to leave, and we left. We left by train from Krakow\nto Warsaw. And from Warsaw, we took \u2014 how did we get to Stockholm? I think \u2014",
        "A: That was in bad shape, yeah, that was ruined. But I wasn\u2019t very impressed,\nbecause again, by then it was a little cleaned up already, and it \u2014 while it was very\ndestroyed, I was not exactly at an age where I could appreciate it, that these\nwonderful buildings were destroyed. And it was nothing compared with what\nBudapest looked like. I mean, I knew what the city that\u2019s destroyed is a few hours\n146March 1, 1999\nafter, that\u2019s very different. So I wasn\u2019t \u2014 that didn\u2019t make any impression on me. As\nfar as Jewish memorials, we never went to any of them. My parents \u2014 you know, as\nfar as the ghetto, or the site of the ghetto and so on. No, I think this is an\n[indecipherable] that 1s now very \u2014 you know, people do it and I\u2019m going to say\nsomething that\u2019s going to shock everybody, but I think that \u2014 I myself feel that\nthere\u2019s \u2014 when we really needed help and support right after the war, and when I\ncame to Brazil and \u2014 and, you know, I had a need to talk about what happened to us,\nin order to inform people I had close contact with, schoolmates and so on, nobody\nwas interested. Nobody was interested. And now, I almost think it\u2019s too much, and I\nmyself am almost overdosed on the Holocaust, particularly on the superficial de \u2014\ncharacteristics of it. I still very much like to read books on the ho \u2014 that have\nsomething to do with the Holocaust. Not memor \u2014 not memoirs, you know, what\nhappened to another person who had a similar story like mine, I think on that level\nit\u2019s not interesting. But novels or fiction or anything that deals with the Holocaust, I\nwill read, and I find some of them very interesting. But this sort of obsession with it\nnow is, I think way overboard, you know, way, way too much. And not all of it\u2019s\nsincere anyway. So anyhow, we did \u2014 I don\u2019t remember doing anything Jewish.\nAfter the war, my mother was very gratified, because my parents did ask us after the\nwar whether we wanted to stay Jewish. And both my brother and I apparently said\n147March 1, 1999\nyes. I don\u2019t remember it v \u2014 I do remember talking about it, but it wasn\u2019t a long\ndiscussion, it was more \u2014 don\u2019t forget, we had these Christian papers. We had an\noption to stay who we were during the war. You \u2014 you did have some \u2014 you had a\npossibility, and some people did. They just didn\u2019t want to have anything to do with\nit any more. They didn\u2019t want their children to have to go through this, what we\nwent through, and so there were all kinds of different solutions, let\u2019s say, or \u2014 or \u2014 or\nroads to recovery that people opted for. Options. So I \u2014 they asked us, and we\ndecided that we wanted to \u2014 at least we said that we wanted to stay Jewish, and the\nreason was not \u2014 I was too young, I mean I didn\u2019t know anything, I never studied\nanything, neither did my brother, that I-I just felt that \u2014 that we were born, that is\nlike, do I want to be a blonde? No, because I was never a blonde, and there was no\nreason to now become a blonde. So now that it\u2019s over, yes, so we said yes. But it\nwasn\u2019t such a big deal as it 1s today in general again, you know being Jewish was\nnot what I always tell my husband, a full-time occupation. It was just something you\nwere, that\u2019s all. So, after the war, we had back our names and our \u2014 you know,\nlegitimate birth certificates and the whole thing. And we went via \u2014 we went to\nSweden. In Sweden \u2014 we went by train, I think \u2014 in Sweden we had to wait a long\ntime, we were in Stockholm for about three months. We didn\u2019t get to Brazil til\nOctober, so we must have been there \u2014 not three months, maybe a little shorter,\n148March 1, 1999\nbecause the trip took about four or five weeks on the \u2014 on a freighter. At that time\nthe big issue was not only getting a visa, but getting transportation out of Europe\nbecause everybody was go \u2014 leaving.",
        "A: Actually, that was a very positive experience. And actually, I should backtrack a\nlittle bit. I think from Krak\u00e9w to Warsaw, on the way to Brazil, I later remembered\nwe did fly. And I remember it was an airplane that did \u2014 had seats all around, it\ndidn\u2019t have seats in rows. And it was a short flight, it\u2019s not very far.",
        "A: No, it was the flight from Krak\u00e9w to Warsaw on the way to Sweden, and then\nin \u2014 from Warsaw to Stockholm, I really don\u2019t know how we went. As I said, I\nthink it was by train, but I couldn\u2019t swear. I don\u2019t remember how \u2014 how we got\nthere, all I remember is that we did get there.",
        "A: No, we definitely did not go by ship. We went by ship from Sweden, from\nGoteborg to Brazil, yeah, that was by sh \u2014 by ship. Going to Sweden was a\nwonderful feeling, because going \u2014 Sweden we knew was a neutral country during\n149March 1, 1999\nthe war. It was kind of heaven, you know, going to a neutral country, a country that\nwas never destroyed, never had any part in any war. It was wonderful, and we knew\nit was a good country and a prosperous country and that we would be comfortable\nand \u2014 and we were. And \u2014",
        "A: No, I was not unhappy about leaving Poland because I really had no roots in\nPoland. I never went to school in Poland. I was actually, between Vienna and our\nleaving, was only about two months. So I was only there for about two months, and\nalso ba \u2014 by \u2014 by the time I returned from Vienna, when this man took me home to\nmy parents, I was told that the reason they brought me over is because they already\nhad the visas and it was just a matter of getting everything else settled and we were\nleaving. So it wasn\u2019t like you know, I was settling down anywhere. So I was very ha\n\u2014 then there was a good feeling. Leaving for Sweden was a good feeling was \u2014\nbecause it was the beginning of something new and something that we knew had to\nhappen, is us settling somewhere. Now Brazil was the goal and Sweden was\ncertainly a good and easy country to \u2014 to wait in. And that\u2019s what happened. We\nwaited in Sweden in \u2014 in Stockholm we stayed in \u2014 in zak \u2014 some sort of a\npensionne, boarding house, very comfortable. And the only thing we thought was\nterrible was the Swedish food, which 1s very, very different from any food we had \u2014\n150March 1, 1999\nwe ever had before. There\u2019s a lot of, as you know, cold fish and herrings and so on.\nAnd in addition to that, they have \u2014 their desserts are not sweet, so we were shocked\nthat things that looked like a cake, turned out to be salty. So th \u2014 it was always a bit\nof a surprise. The other thing that struck us, and we must have arrived in Sweden in\nAugust, because they have very little sunshine there, and the minute the sun would\ncome out in front of the opera, we \u2014 we lived not far from the opera, there were\nsteps, and there were these people sitting down and with their faces leaning up and\nlooking at the sun, and you know, every few moments of sunshine was a big thing.\nSo we found that peculiar.",
        "A: We didn\u2019t understand, of course, Swedish. A little bit it\u2019s like German, so there\nwere some words that we could make out. And again, it was not a big \u2014 it was not a\nbig problem. We st-stayed in this boarding house, our needs were taken care of.\nWhat was a big problem was that my father went \u2014 while we were waiting to go to \u2014\nto get the ship to go to Brazil, he decided to go to Switzerland and look around,\nbecause he was beginning to think what he was going to do in Sweden \u2014 in Brazil,\nand the reason we were going to Brazil was that his former partner from\nSwitzerland, from his branch in Switzerland was in Brazil since 1940, and was\ndoing very, very well. And the idea came up, I don\u2019t know if my father initiated it,\n151March 1, 1999\nor this \u2014 his name was Landau(ph), Mr. Roman Landau(ph) \u2014 or whether Mr.\nLandau(ph) initiated it, but I\u2014 my father had very good connections in Switzerland\nin the \u2014 in the watch industry, because he financed \u2014 first of all, he was there during\nWorld War I, and \u2014 and so he somehow knew many of the people. But in addition to\nthat, he financed the \u2014 his cousins representation of Omega and Tissot, which were\ntwo very well-known makes of Swiss watches. And my \u2014 my father\u2019s cousin had the\nrepresentation of these two brands for Poland. Omega particularly was very\nsuccessful before the war, and my father was \u2014 had a partner [indecipherable]\nfinance his cousin, or whatever. So anyhow, he had connections, and his idea was to\ngo to Brazil, and with the capital from Mr. Landau(ph), with his help, which was\nmore like he owed my father wha \u2014 he \u2014 they \u2014 my father would open a\nrepresentation and import of Swiss watches. And that actually was his business, and\nhe went to \u2014 to Switzerland in order to talk \u2014 to see \u2014 t-to develop some\nrelationships with manufacturers. And so he went for about two or three weeks. And\nin Sweden there wasn\u2019t much going on, because we were just waiting for passage\nand \u2014 and he knew that we weren\u2019t getting it so soon, there were, as I said before,\nthousands of people waiting for passage out of the \u2014\n152March 1, 1999",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t remember. No. We stayed in this boarding house, and I don\u2019t\nremember any children, no. All I remember 1s my mother \u2014 my mother wasn\u2019t well \u2014\nby the way, she miscarried at that time. She became pregnant after the war, which to\nher was \u2014 she was terribly upset about, but she only told it to me la \u2014 many years\nlater. But I did know that she was very, very sick and she was bleeding. And she\nlater told us this very moving story that after my father left, she realized she was\npregnant, and she certainly couldn\u2019t now arrive in Brazil with a new baby, and we\nwere grown, and it was \u2014 she was terribly upset and tried to get an abortion. There\nwas no abortion in \u2014 in Sweden, which | \u2014 it was a surprise to me, a progressive\ncountry like that, you couldn\u2019t get an abortion. I remember her going to the doctor\nand I went with her to the do \u2014 what did I do? I just sort of stayed with her and with\nmy brother, I mean, that\u2019s all we did. And \u2014 but I had no clue as to why. And then\nshe induced the miscarriage. So I remember there was a lot of blood and she told me\nthat was a very heavy menstruation. I was the one that was cleaning it up. So that\nwas not a happy thing, but I didn\u2019t know that it was that until many years later. And\nthen she recovered and we waited, and my father came back, eventually, we went to\nGoteborg. And that I remember, that trip from Stockholm to Goteborg, I\nremember very well, because it was a beautiful train ride, just beautiful. And we\nwent to \u2014 and in Goteborg we still waited for a while. And I think that \u2014 I don\u2019t\n153March 1, 1999\nknow where it was, either in Stockholm or in Goteborg, I think my brother got a\nbicycle, or there was some talk about bicycle. I vaguely remember something about\nthat, but very little. And then in the \u2014 then the passa \u2014 the \u2014 the tickets came through,\nor th-the space became available, and we went to Brazil, and arrived in Brazil in\noke \u2014 October, 1946, end of October we arrived actually the day of my father\u2019s\nbirth. So I remember that date very well, because it \u2014 my mother always talked\nabout how we arrived on his birthday.",
        "A: Right. I turned 14 in Sweden, because we \u2014 in August we were in Sweden, that\u2019s\nwhen I turned 14. Mm-hm, so when I arrived in Brazil, there I had fi \u2014 my fa \u2014",
        "A: Yes, a very small \u2014 it was a freighter, and there were 11 of us. There was some\nother family, whom I remember very vaguely, and some \u2014 but there were no\nchildren, or no youngsters, we were the only ones. And on that \u2014 on that boat, I\nlearned how to play Bridge, because the captain and purser, they had, I don\u2019t know,\ntwo or three officers and they needed a fourth hand. And I was the one that they\ndecided to teach, I was the most teachable, so I \u2014 I played Bridge; that\u2019s most of\nwhat I remember on that boat, that I played Bridge, and that some days it was very\n154March 1, 1999\nrough, and everybody was seasick. And I felt also queasy, but I was the only one\nwho didn\u2019t really, you know, throw up, so I was very proud of myself. But \u2014",
        "A: I didn\u2019t know anything about it, nothing. I knew it was a hot climate. I knew that\nRio, its capital, and that\u2019s where we were going, was supposed to be a beautiful city.\nAnd also I knew that we knew a number of people there; that I knew. And also my\nfather, not only that \u2014 that his former partner was there, but also my father was\nmarried before, so my mother was his second wife, and he had two daughters by his\nfirst wife, and the older one, with her husband and son, were in Brazil; that was\nanother reason why we went there. And my nephew, her son, was only two and a\nhalf years younger than I am, and a year younger than my brother. So I knew that \u2014\nthat there was some sort of family. My father never had a very good relationship\nwith her before or after the war, but that\u2019s a different story. But anyhow, I knew they\nwere there. And what did it mean? It meant a certain, imagine, permanence, but not\na happy one. Not \u2014 not for me. I had \u2014 I had \u2014 I was open to it, but my mother was\nvery unhappy, she didn\u2019t want to go to Brazil, so there was a lot of problems for \u2014\nabout that, because my mother really wanted to go to Palestine. And she made it\nvery clear when my uncle left, she wanted to do it. My father didn\u2019t want to take the\n155March 1, 1999\nchance, and of course, she couldn\u2019t do it. But she felt that Brazil was really a very,\nvery, very, you know, contrary, different country, and she felt very strongly that she\nhad nothing in common with that culture, and talked a lot about it. I remember that I,\nfor myself, felt that she was exaggerating, that she was making it \u2014 being negative,\nand I didn\u2019t want to be negative at that point. My father also \u2014 my father was a very\npositive, but my father was the kind of man who, how shall I say? If he decided to\ndo something, he would \u2014 he \u2014 he didn\u2019t have second thoughts, he would make an\neffort to make it work. And she was a much more kind of intuitive and emotional\nperson. Anyhow, she felt that after surviving the war, there was really nothing for in\nBrazil. It was a strange country, a tropical country, she kept saying it was a tropical\ncountry, a strange country, and it really made no sense to go there, and she was very\nunhappy about it. And when they argued about it, th-the interesting thing was that\nshe used to say that my brother, who was much more \u2014 you know, was younger and\nmuch more sort of very different, less settled than I was at that \u2014 you \u2014 she used to\nwarn my father and say, you na \u2014 he\u2019s going to get used to this country, and you see,\nhe\u2019ll end up marrying out of faith. And that did happen eventually. So \u2014\n156March 1, 1999",
        "A: She used to talk a lot about it, because to her, what we went through, the war,\nwas very much alive, and to me also. And she used to talk a lot about it, more in\nrelation to what was expecting us. Her attitude was, we went through so much, and\nis this what we went it through for? And so she would bring things up, and \u2014 over\nand over. I can\u2019t say that I was sitting there patiently talking about it, because my\nattitude was more like my father\u2019s. We\u2019re coming here, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014I didn\u2019t\nwant it to be that negative because I didn\u2019t \u2014 I didn\u2019t worry about my fa \u2014 my\nbrother marrying out of faith, I mean I\u2014 you know, I had other problem, I had other\n\u2014 I thought she was exaggerating, I thought, you know, let\u2019s give this country first a\n\u2014a chance, and then see maybe it will be a nice country. Who knows? Why say in\nadvance that it won\u2019t be? And so yes, she talked a lot about what \u2014 what we \u2014 we\nhad gone through, and so on, yes. But how much I did of that, I probably listened.\nAnd some of the stories \u2014 she, by the way, was a great, as I mentioned probably\nearlier, she was a great storyteller and she was amusing and \u2014 and so on. And she\nwas interesting, so I probably, you know, if she had some reminiscences of\nsomething that I didn\u2019t remember so well, or that was amusing to her, and at the\ntime I was too young to understand, yes, I \u2014 she did talk about it, and I did listen to\nthat, yes.\n157March 1, 1999",
        "A: So now we arrived in Brazil, and I \u2014 from that I have very vivid memories. It\nwas hot. It was end of October, which is the beginning of the brazi \u2014 of the Brazilian\nsummer, and it was very hot. And at that time there was no air conditioning. The\nonly place that was air conditioned were cinemas. So my mother used to say, we go\nto the ci \u2014 to the movies for the climate. And that\u2019s the \u2014 that\u2019s the only place that\nwas air conditioned. They arranged for us to \u2014 of course my sister met us at the pier,\nand my father\u2019s former partner, so there were people meeting us at the \u2014 when we\narrived. And we \u2014 they rented for us two rooms, and a bathroom, and a little kind of\n\u2014I don\u2019t know if it was a kitchen or whatever, in a residential hotel. And all I\nremember from that, that it was beastly hot, and it was full of cockroaches. Because\ncockroaches in Brazil at that time were numerous. And so my mother used to say,\nwhen you want to go into the bathroom, you have to knock first, not to see if\nsomebody\u2019s there, but to frighten them away. And that\u2019s exactly what I\n[indecipherable]. And that was horrible, that was just awful. It was a horrible place,\nth \u2014 and it wasn\u2019t \u2014 it was 1n the best part of town, it wasn\u2019t like it was the slums or\nanything. But that \u2014 those were the conditions in Brazil. It was not a super luxury\nhotel, it was a\u2014 some sort of middle class kind of residential hotel. I have a very\nvivid memory of the second evening we were there, we were invited to dinner, to\nmy father\u2019s former partner\u2019s house. And they lived in a really, really wonderful,\n158March 1, 1999\nluxurious, enormous kind of apartment that exists to this day only in Brazil, it\ndoesn\u2019t \u2014 y-you \u2014 nobody in America lives as well as that. And they were very, very\nwell-to-do, they \u2014 he made a lot of money during the war on things like quartz and\nall kinds of raw materials.\nEnd of Tape Five, Side A\nBeginning Tape Five, Side B",
        "A: And so we were invited there for dinner, and we went. And of course, during the\n\u2014 first of all, the dinner was so unbelievably elaborate and beautiful, and butlers in\nwhite gloves serving and candle lights on the thing. I\u2019d never seen anything \u2014 on the\ntable, candle lights, silver, porcelain. I mean, it was really, even by my today\nstandards, it \u2014 1t would still be very impressive because people don\u2019t live that way in\n\u2014 in America with, you know, we had practically two servants per person at this\ndinner. So anyway, during that dinner, of course, the conversation was about what\nwe went through, you know, what happened wi \u2014 to us during the war and so on.\nAnd at the end tu \u2014 my parents sort of told the story. I, of course, at age 14 was very,\nvery quiet and I didn\u2019t say anything, my brother didn\u2019t say anything because we just\nsat there and \u2014 and were stunned by the whole thing. And when she finished telling\n159March 1, 1999\nwhat happened to us, our hostess said \u2014 she said, oh my God, she said, this is nothi \u2014\nwhat you went through is nothing compared what we suffered not knowing where\nyou were and what was happening. And I said to my mother \u2014 this I remember \u2014\nwhen we left that evening, I said to my mother, I\u2019m never going to talk about what\nhappened to us to anybody. They don\u2019t understand. They don\u2019t \u2014 it\u2019s no use, beca \u2014\nand I really did do that, I did not talk to people what happened. And later on, when I\nwent to school, and I should then tell you how and where and so on, I also found that\nas a result of what happened to us, or to me, I had very little rapport with youngsters\nmy age, very, very little. Because I always felt that whatever interested them was so\n\u2014 today I would use the word superficial, it wasn\u2019t superficial, it was \u2014 they were\nreal teenagers, and they were interested in clothes and lipstick. Again, in Brazil this\nwas very \u2014 still is a primary concern of a teenage girl. And \u2014 and I became later on,\na little interested in that, but it wasn\u2019t like \u2014 you know, I had so many other things\nthat happened to me. But they wouldn\u2019t understand, so I didn\u2019t have \u2014 I didn\u2019t have\na lot in common with them. That was a big problem for me.",
        "A: Did I have a best friend? I had a couple of friends, but I wouldn\u2019t say that any of\nthem, as I said, I mean th-they were all \u2014 had been there during the war, in Brazil.\nThey were \u2014 the people I became friendly with eventually, were actually children of\n160March 1, 1999\npeople from Europe, not necessarily survivors, because I didn\u2019t know that many,\nbut people who went to Brazil in 1940 or 1939, who got out, were able to leave\nEurope before the war, and came there and lived extremely well. I mean, wa \u2014 I\ncan\u2019t tell you how well people in Brazil to this day live, com \u2014 you know, th-they\u2019re\nwealthy people, live extremely well. So, I have a couple of very close friends, pa \u2014\nthe daughter of one of my parent\u2019s good friend is a very good friend of mine to this\nday. I did, but on the whole, classmates and parties and all of that, was something\nthat was very difficult for me. I mean, I wasn\u2019t interested, I \u2014 I felt I was like \u2014 like\nan adult at a children\u2019s party, that\u2019s how I felt.",
        "A: I should really backtrack and tell you about my school experience, because I\narrived in Brazil at the age of 14, and basically had no school, because I was in\nschool about 10 months in Siberia, in first grade. I was in school after that again,\nafter the war, in Vienna for about six weeks or two months. I was taught by this\nlady, this Polish lady in Hungary, and by my mother, so I la \u2014 that\u2019s how, at some\npoint I learned how to read and write. Probably in first grade, but that was in\nRussian. And just before they deported us, I was in school for about two months or\nso, because I remember making lines and lines and lines of As and Bs, that\u2019s how\nthey taught at that time. So that was in Polish. So basically I had never really been in\n161March 1, 1999\nschool properly. So here I was, and I was 14 years old, and I needed to go to school.\nSo my parents found out, and I found out that the Brazilian system is exactly like the\nFrench system. Which means that you have to \u2014 they cannot put you any higher than\nsixth grade, because you don\u2019t earn credits, you have to work towards the baccal \u2014\nbaccalaureate, or wa \u2014 how you spell it, how you pronounce it, and they wouldn\u2019t\ntake me above the sixth grade. They were willing to take me into the sixth grade,\nand then I would learn Portuguese, and so on. So anyway, I had to learn Portuguese.\nThis, to me, was like part of the war. It was a terrible disappointment, because here I\nwas, I was 14 years old. To go into the sixth grade was so humiliating. And I was\nalso very tall, I was as tall as I am today, or if not taller, cause I\u2019ve begun to shrink.\nBut \u2014 so this was a terrible, terrible blow to me, and there was nothing you could do\nabout it. So someone told me, and that was my lifesaver, that there\u2019s an American\nschool. And the American school does let you earn credits, and 1t only counts from\nthe ninth grade. I was the right age for the ninth grade, so if they would let me start\nin the ninth grade, then I had a chance to \u2014 to be with people my own age, and\ngraduate on time. Problem was that I didn\u2019t know any English at all, just like I didn\u2019t\nknow any Portuguese. So, I \u2014 of course, my parents were convinced that it was six\nof one, half a dozen of the other, I did have to learn a new language, and that wasn\u2019t\nthe problem. And I must say that I went with \u2014 I had to go with somebody who\n162March 1, 1999\nwould interpret for me. So I went with my half-sister, she spoke excellent English,\nshe \u2014 she was at the interpreters\u2019 school in \u2014 in Switzerland before the war, her\nEnglish was excellent. And she went with me. And we spoke \u2014 we got an\nappointment, we went there and they told me that if I learned English between\nOctober, end of a \u2014 now it\u2019s November already, middle of November, and March,\nbecause the school year in Brazil begins in \u2014 on the first of March. The long\nvacation because of the summer season 1s in the \u2014 is 1n the winter. So, they would\ngive me some sort of an exam, that would have a little bit of social studies, they\ngave me some \u2014 they gave me a textbook. General science, a little mathematics. So\nbasically sort of a\u2014 some kind of foundation. And some English and if I could pass\nthat exam at the end of the summer, over there, by March first, they would let me cu\n\u2014 go into ninth grade. Now, when I took th \u2014 I studied like crazy from that day on\nuntil March first. And then my mother used to say that was \u2014 we had an armchair \u2014\noh, eventually we moved, we got an apartment. We had armchair that she used to\nsay she could have sent easily to take that exam, because an armchair was so\nsaturated with my sitting in there and studying. I studied from morni \u2014 morning to\nnight, I had a dictionary. I had no lessons, nobody helped me, really. My sister\noccasionally helped me a little, but I really did it by myself with a dictionary, and\nmy father knew a little English and somehow \u2014 and the American school was\n163March 1, 1999\nunbelievable, they were so supportive, they really were. And when I was taking that\nexam, they gave me a dictionary, they let me use a dictionary. And in \u2014 and the only\nfunny experience I had with that was that my mathematics was quite good, I was\nalways good in math. And \u2014 but one of the examples on that exam had to do with\ndimes, nickels and quarters. And of course, there I had no idea what that was, and I\nhad to leave that question out, but it was the only one I left out, so I did very well.\nAnd I started ninth grade at th \u2014 and I was thrilled, and I worked very hard, and I did\nvery well. And I graduated from \u2014 from the American school when I was 18, four\nyears later. And that\u2019s what brought me to the United States, because the American\nschool did not have rights in Brazil, so I could not have gone on to \u2014 to a university\nor anything. So that fa \u2014 and I did want to leave, but it was because of that I really\nhad to leave, unless I \u2014 I could have gone to a secretarial school and become a\nsecretary, and there was some talk of doing that, but I didn\u2019t want to do that.",
        "A: I think they knew about our \u2014 my background, and I wasn\u2019t the only one, by the\nway, there were three other survivors\u2019 children in my class. So I was not the only\none any more. And we all did very well, by the way, all of us, because \u2014 because we\nworked so hard. We were so serious, we \u2014 you know, scholastically, we did very\n164March 1, 1999\nwell. The teachers did not \u2014 teachers at that time, I don\u2019t know how it was in the\nUnited States, but teachers were not really interested terribly much in what you\nthought or didn\u2019t think, or what you did do \u2014 went through or didn\u2019t go through.\nThey were supportive, they helped you if you needed help, they were nice. No, I\ndon\u2019t remember having any kind of contact about that.",
        "A: Yeah, they were not chil \u2014 you know, teen \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, yes, they were \u2014 they \u2014 we definitely were a lot together, because we had a\nlot in common. One of them was a boy, and he was two years older than I was, and\nhe was in the same b \u2014 he was unlucky enough to be to \u2014 so he graduated two years\nlater, cause that was the only way you could do it. So he was there and then one of\nthem was a distant, very distant cousin of my mother\u2019s, and her daughter was there\nand she was also two years older than I was.",
        "A: Did we exchange stories? I knew her story, yes, and she knew my story; with\nhim, no. No, I don\u2019t know what \u2014 I wasn\u2019t that terribly friendly with him. I don\u2019t\nknow what he went through. I knew thought, that he did \u2014 I think he lost his family,\nbecause he was living with an uncle. So I do \u2014 but I didn\u2019t \u2014 we didn\u2019t go around\n165March 1, 1999\nasking people, you know, what did you or did you not \u2014 everybody\u2019s story was, in\nsome ways, similar. I mean, you knew that if he survived \u2014 he also was on Christian\npapers, I knew that. So, I don\u2019t know whether I knew it because my mother knew \u2014\nmy parents knew these families, or knew about them. So whether that\u2019s how I heard\nthat they survived \u2014 I heard more how people survived from my parents than I did\ndirectly. By then, people like \u2014 like him and my \u2014 the other young \u2014 the other girl,\nwere more interested in the day to day, you know, getting \u2014 doing what we had to\ndo. There \u2014 there wasn\u2019t much time to sit around and talk about what happened. So \u2014",
        "A: No, I never really wrote diaries, and no, the answer is no. I have, to this day,\nsomething very funny. It\u2019s a \u2014 it\u2019s an embroidery, and it\u2019s a rectangular, like a\u2014a\u2014\nit\u2019s like a doily, but it\u2019s embroidered 1n a \u2014 1n a stitch, it\u2019s not crocheted. And I got\nthat at some point, I think in Hungary, because very often my mother would buy \u2014 I\nloved to sew and I was very good at it, I was always very good at knitting and\nembroidering and all of that, and that kept me busy. So, I \u2014 so this thing, I finished\nafter the war, and I brought it with me to Brazil. So in the middle \u2014 in the center of\nit, I wrote it was embroidered during the war years of 1940 to \u201945. I have it to this\nday. Did I keep journals? No, no, I never did that, no. The \u2014 a closest thing I kept to\n166March 1, 1999\na journal was when I came to brazi \u2014 to America, I \u2014 I was here alone, I wrote home\nto my mother \u2014 well, to my parents actually, but she was the one that answered\nmore, although my father also wrote very often. I wrote daily, because I guess I was\nlonely, and also I wanted them to know what was happening, and I was so far away,\nand there was such a big sacrifice on their part to send me, that I sort of felt I should\ndo that. And my mother kept all those letters. So those letters still exist, some of\nthem are \u2014 most of them are still in Brazil, my brother has them. And \u2014",
        "A: Yes, I wanted to leave, A, as I told you, I really didn\u2019t want to take a secretarial\ncourse and study \u2014 and \u2014 and work there 1n an office, I wasn\u2019t very much \u2014 very\nexciting. And I did want to leave, because I guess that my feeling, after a few years\nthere \u2014 you see, going to the American school ha \u2014 was a \u2014 it was a mixed blessing\nin some ways, because my classmates, who were all American, were children of\ndiplomats, business people, and they kept coming and going. They would stay a year\nor two or three or four, whatever. But it was not \u2014 they were not in the country, and\nthey certainly all left, after they \u2014 we graduated, they all went back to the States to s\n\u2014 to school, an \u2014 even if their parents remained in Brazil. So you didn\u2019t really have\nfriends. Once the school was over, you didn\u2019t \u2014 not only friends, you didn\u2019t know\nanyone. That was the second reason. The third reason was that because my mother\n167March 1, 1999\nended up being very unhappy in Brazil, there was a lot of \u2014 there was a lot of\nunhappiness in \u2014 in my parents\u2019 home. There was a lot of friction, there was a lot of\nunhappiness. And so I was anxious to get away, I really was. So, that\u2019s why I\nwanted to go away. There were all these different reasons, but that\u2019s what I wanted.",
        "A: Oh, I loved it, I loved it. Absolutely loved it. First of all, there was another thing\nthat I hated in Rio \u2014 although I shouldn\u2019t really say that, I \u2014 that I didn\u2019t like the\ncountry, because it\u2019s not fair. The country is really very, very nice, and the\nBrazilians are very nice people. And I later on met some, and my brother did not go\nto the American school right away. He later transferred. So he has Brazilian friends\ngalore, and \u2014 and also because he married a Brazilian woman, he \u2014 so I know a lot of\npeople \u2014 I knew some through him when \u2014 when ~ as an older sister when \u2014 because\nhe brought these people home. And he \u2014 he \u2014 they\u2019re lovely people, and they\u2019re not\n\u2014 they\u2019re not anti-Semitic, they\u2019re not \u2014 they\u2019re just very nice, hospitable, warm\npeople. So \u2014 but what I didn\u2019t like there was that basically my social life was within\nthe ca \u2014 what we call the colony. In other words, there were two Jewish clubs, and\nthey were social clubs. And so the young people like myself would go there and\nthere would be a record player, and you danced, and you dated these people and so\non. But it was very, very provincial. I always used to say, by the time I woke up, if I\n168March 1, 1999\nwent to a dance, or \u2014 and stayed out, you know, til midnight and then slept late the\nnext morning, by the time I woke up, my mother knew who I danced with, what I\ndid, where I went and the whole thing. So it was \u2014 it was very, very provincial. And\nmy parents social life also reflected that, you know. Lot of emphasis of who or what\nand where and when and how. So, because of that, I also wanted to leave, and when\nI came here, I had \u2014 to America, I came to New York, I had this wonderful feeling\nthat nobody cared what I did, nobody. And I was on my own and I was free, and I\ndidn\u2019t have to \u2014 to worry about anybody. I did like it, even though I was alone, I did\nlike it very, very much.",
        "A: I was 18 and a half \u2014 19, actually. I came here in February, and I graduated in \u2014\nin \u2014 in Brazil you graduate in \u2014 oh, when did we graduate? End of the year was in\nOctober, and then was vacation. And I didn\u2019t leave right away, because I had to wait\nfor the new term here, and also because the wa \u2014 Korean war had broken out, so my\nfather suddenly got very worried. And actually, originally, I was supposed to go to\nLondon. He agreed for me to go to London, he wasn\u2019t too keen on \u2014 on America.\nLondon, I don\u2019t know, London he felt a little more comfortable. When the Korean\nwar broke out, London was no longer an option, he was afraid of Europe and so on,\n169March 1, 1999\nand he decided \u2014 and \u2014 and I wanted to go to \u2014 to New York, to America. My father\nwas not keen on my leaving. It was my mother was, and he wa not.",
        "A: None, absolutely none. Because again, in Brazil \u2014 the Brazilians were not at all\nanti-Semitic and the American \u2014 my classmates and so on, no, no. No, they were\nvery \u2014 it wasn\u2019t that they did not like me, it was that I did not have enough in\ncommon with them to really \u2014 you know, to \u2014 to \u2014 to have some kind of real warm\nfriendship.",
        "A: Now I\u2019m in New York City, and again, because of what we went through, and\nalso because my father was \u2014 my father, at that point, was beginning to \u2014 to be\nestablished. He was making a living, and he had started and \u2014 but he wasn\u2019t terribly\nwell-to-do, because he had lost really everything. But \u2014 and at that time the Brazilian\ngovernment was allowing 200 daw \u2014 if you had a student, child, living abroad, they\nwere giving 200 dollars a month at the official exchange. So I was getting 200\ndollars a month. My father could afford that, that wasn\u2019t a big thing. But he was\nafraid that if things changed, or he suddenly couldn\u2019t afford it, or whatever, he\nwanted to make sure that I would learn, or be able to \u2014 to earn my living as soon as\npossible. So his condition finally was that if I did come to New York, he wanted me\n170March 1, 1999\nto go to secretarial school before I went to college. And that\u2019s what I did, I took a wa\n\u2014 so I went first to secretarial school, and I finished one year of that, and then I went\nto NYU. So \u2014I don\u2019t remember what your question was about \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, well, I liked New York [indecipherable]",
        "A: I took liberal arts, and I \u2014 I did two years of it, and by then I got married, so I\ndidn\u2019t finish, because my husband is almost 12 years older than I am and he was\nalready in business and established and we started a life where I also had to entertain\nand go out and I just couldn\u2019t do it all at the same time. And then we had chil \u2014 I had\nchildren very young.",
        "A: Oh, that\u2019s actually a cute story. He \u2014 my father was a banker in Krakow before\nthe war, and my f \u2014 late father-in-law was in the banking business in Lwow in\neastern Poland. And so they had done some business together. They were not\nfriends, but \u2014 because they were living in different cities and it was a little bit \u2014 they\n171March 1, 1999\nwere different. But they had done some business together, and my late father-in-law\nfound out from some \u2014 some Polish people from Krakow that \u2014 who were neighbors\nof his actually, in the building where he lived, was a family from Krak\u00e9w who\nknew my parents, and found out that I was here by myself, studying. So he called\nme on night and said, my name is Oskar Gruss, and he \u2014 he was \u2014 said, I knew your\nfather, and I would like to \u2014 you to come for dinner. Now, I had gotten quite a\nnumber of invitations like that, because many people knew my parents \u2014 well, my\nfather, before the war. And if \u2014 they heard that I was alone in New York, so they\nwould invite me. And most of these ee \u2014 dinners were deadly boring, terrible. So \u2014\nand most of the names of the people who invited me, prior to this call, I had heard\nabout at home, you know, the \u2014 they \u2014 but this name I had never heard, so I decided\nthat I wasn\u2019t going to go there for dinner, and rush \u2014 he wanted me to come Friday\nnight. I said, I\u2019m sorry, Friday night I can\u2019t. So he said, when can you? So I said,\nMonday in two weeks, because I figured out \u2014 it took a week \u2014 it took five days\nactually, to write \u2014 to write a letter home and get an answer, so that would be 10\ndays. So it gave me over two weeks to find out who this person was. So he said\nMonday in two weeks, okay. And he said, we eat early, and \u2014 so be there at 6:30. All\nright, so I said goodbye and I said I would be. And in the meantime I wrote home to\nmy parents, and I said such an Oskar Gruss called me, invited me for dinner, shall I\n172March 1, 1999\ngo? Who 1s it? So I got back an answer sure enough, and my father wrote that there\nwas such a person, he was in the banking business, he was in Lwow, and he\nremembers him, you know, vaguely, not terribly, but \u2014 and that if I have nothing\nbetter to do on that Monday evening, I can go, I should go. So I decided to go. So I\nwent and I got there at 6:30 sharp and I \u2014 my mother-in-law \u2014 my future mother-in-\nlaw opened the door, and I saw this blank thing \u2014 he completely forgot to tell her.\nBut she caught on quite quickly, he mu \u2014 they must have talked about me, because\nonce I stood there \u2014 first I saw this blank stare, and then she \u2014 she sort of caught on\nwho I was. I introduced myself, and she was very nice. And then I saw the maid\nsetting another place, so obviously everybody had forgotten about me. And then I\nsat \u2014 and she was very nice to me, and we sat on the sofa and she actually asked me\na lot about what we had gone through, and wha \u2014 where was I and what was I doing,\nand so on. So, about half an hour later, the key turns 1n the door, and in comes my\nfather-in-law first, and my future husband behind him. And my father-in-law sort of\nwent with his head, oh my God, he said, cause he remembered he for \u2014 that he forgot\ncompletely that I was coming. Anyhow, then we sat down to dinner, and dinner was\na disaster, because my husband had a sister who\u2019s no longer alive, and she was\nstudying \u2014 oh, she was in third year law school, I think. And they were in Wall\nStreet, and the conversation, even though I knew English, seemed to me that I\n173March 1, 1999\ndidn\u2019t understand one word, didn\u2019t know what they were talking about. And so that\nwas dinner, and then right after dinner, we got up and my future husband said, I\u2019m\nvery sorry, but I have an appointment, and he got up and he left. And I said to\nmyself, I\u2019m going to wait 20 minutes, because I was told someone doesn\u2019t get up\nfrom the table and leave. But this was horrible, so I said to myself, I'll wait 20\nminutes and then I\u2019m leaving. So, during those 20 minutes, we sat on the sofa and\nmy father-in-law also sat with us, my mother-in-law talked some more. And she was\nvery nice, I liked her. And she \u2014 and my husband came back before those 20 minutes\nwere up. I later found out that he did have a business appointment on Broadway,\nnot far from where they lived, at the Schrafft\u2019s, they used to meet there at that time,\nand he had no way of contacting this person, so he ran over, told him I can\u2019t be with\nyou tonight, and came back, brought me home. So that was very nice. That was\nvery, very nice. Then I wrote home to my parents that \u2014 described the dinner, more\nor less, in the way \u2014 and there was one other detail that I omitted. My parents-in-law\nhad the large collection of Jewish paintings, you know, as they s \u2014 they just now\nactually was \u2014 part of 1t went to the museum, the Jewish museum in New York. But\nthey were all Oppenheimers(ph) and Kaufmans, so they were these Jewish heads.\nAnd all these things were staring down at me. And my father-in-law and my future\nhusband, this was a Monday night, were sitting in kippot. I had never seen that in\n174March 1, 1999\nmy life. So I was a little bit taken by that, you know, it was such a different kind of\nhome, I\u2019d never seen anything like that. So that was a little strange. So anyhow, I\nwrote to my parents home about this whole evening, and I got a letter back from my\nfather saying, in the year 1930, with a question mark, I remember sending him a\npresent for his Bar Mitzvah. Why isn\u2019t he married yet? So anyway, so that\u2019s how I\nmet my husband. We started going out, he started taking me out. This was in\nFebruary, so it was about a year after I came to New York. And I went and \u2014 we\nwent out from February til \u2014 til June. June I was going home for my vacation,\nbecause my s-school year was over. And I \u2014 he took me \u2014 he told me \u2014 he brought\nme a little radio, I remember, he brought me a present, the \u2014 the \u2014 just before I was\nleaving, and he said to me, I\u2019m very sorry, I won\u2019t be able to take you to the ship to\nsee you off \u2014 I was traveling by ship \u2014 because he said, it\u2019s a holiday. And I said, a\nholiday? Well, it turned out it was Shavuot, which was a holiday I never even heard\nabout. So at that point I found out that he\u2019s observant. He kept it from me, from \u2014\nfrom February until June, he took me out \u2014 I didn\u2019t realize that he was ordering fish,\nbecause I didn\u2019t really care what he was ordering. But we went out a lot, and I didn\u2019t\nrealize that he was religious. Never asked me out on a Friday, but you know, th-that\nwas \u2014 I didn\u2019t think about it. So when I came home to Rio, he came for the Fourth of\n175March 1, 1999\nJuly weekend, and he came to my \u2014 to our home, he met my parents, and so on and\nso forth. And we got engaged in September, after I came back.\nEnd of Tape Five, Side B\n176March 1, 1999\nBeginning Tape Six, Side A",
        "A: His official name is Emmanuel Gruss, he\u2019s called Mike Gruss.",
        "A: Yeah, we got engaged in September, when I returned from Rio, and we got\nmarried in December.",
        "A: Yes, yes, I\u2019ve lived in New York ever since. We got married 1952, December\n52.",
        "A: Yes, we have two daughters. Our older daughter was born in January \u00b054, and our\nyounger daughter was born also in January 1957.",
        "A: No, I never worked. I never worked. I tried to take dictation from my husband on\nour honeymoon, and I was so inexperienced and slow that he \u2014 that was my last\nattempt. No, I never worked, no.\n177\nMarch 1, 1999",
        "A: Probably yes, because when I graduated high school, I \u2014 really my dream was to\nstudy medicine. And whether it was a dream or whether I wasn\u2019t, you know,\npersevering enough \u2014 many people who went through what I went through did very\nwell after the war. I felt that my education was like a building without a foundation.\nWas a great building, but it \u2014 there was \u2014 as I had great, really great shortages. I\ndidn\u2019t know many things, even though I did finish this American high school, I had\nno \u2014 hardly any European history, hardly any \u2014 so anyhow, I felt it was without a\nfoundation. A building without a foundation, or \u2014 probably, if I had had a normal\neducation, I probably would have been a different person. I would have been a\ndifferent person also having lived in Europe and I don\u2019t \u2014 I imagine so that \u2014 that I\nwould have been very different, yes.",
        "A: I would have probably achieved a little more than I did achieve on my own, a-\nafter the war. As I said, I would have had a \u2014 probably a better foundation, a regular\neducation. I probably would have been able to \u2014 to go on and \u2014 and you know, do\neither medicine, or \u2014 or something a little more concrete than what I did.\n178March 1, 1999",
        "A: Children, or as an a \u2014 as an adult?",
        "A: Oh.",
        "A: I would think in some ways yes, that I\u2014 maybe that my perspective on life is\nsomewhat different than it would have been if I didn\u2019t go through what I went\nthrough. I had an interesting exchange just last week, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s relevant or\nnot, with Brenda about overprotective parents. And I had met this young \u2014 youngish\nwoman who has an only daughter, talking to another youngish woman who has an\nonly daughter. And they seemed to be terribly concerned because the class that these\nchildren, third graders were in, were going on some sort of a s-swimming \u2014 I don\u2019t\nknow, they \u2014 at \u2014 at some club or something, and one of the mothers was saying\nhow she\u2019s going also, because she\u2019s concerned they won\u2019t have enough lifeguards\nand 30 little girls swimming, and who knows \u2014 and these were not even Jewish\npeople, these were Catholic people. So I \u2014 I told Brenda about this, I said, I never\nwas concerned about \u2014 I mean, if the school took them someplace, I never thought\nthat there was any \u2014 so Brenda said, maybe 1 \u2014 and I said, this must be because\n179March 1, 1999\nthey\u2019re only children. And Brenda said no, maybe it\u2019s because you went through so\nmuch when you were a child, that \u2014 that what we were doing was so protected and\nso normal, never occurred to you that something could happen. And maybe that\u2019s\ntrue, as the \u2014 I thought about it. It was just something that happened 10 days ago, I\nstarted thinking about it, maybe she\u2019s right. So then I said to her, so I was not an\noverprotective mother? And she said no, you were not. And I really \u2014 maybe that\u2019s\nsomething that I got out of it. On the other hand, from having read a lot about\nsurvivors, I know that many of them are overp \u2014 very, very overprotective of their\nchildren. I guess the reason is that they feel that these children should accomp \u2014 you\nknow, that they \u2014 I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know why, but \u2014",
        "A: Very little. Later on in life, when they became more interested, because when\nthey became more grown-up, and started reading and studying at university and so\non, they would ask me, and then I would tell them. I didn\u2019t want to burden anyone\nwith all of that. I felt that it was irrelevant, 1t wasn\u2019t that \u2014 it was over. And no, I\ndidn\u2019t tell them too much. Every once in a while, I would make a comment, I\nremember, to them, you know, when \u2014 when I was your age \u2014 you know, if there\u2019s\nsomething meg \u2014 you know, was like highly exaggerated I thought by then, I would\nsay, you know, when I was your age, I didn\u2019t have such and such, or I didn\u2019t even\n180March 1, 1999\nthink about such and such. As a matter of fact, I did that the other day, I don\u2019t\nremember what it was about, with my grandson Jonathan, and then he started to ask\nme, well, where were you, what were you doing? So I told him. As they asked me, I\nwould tell, but not \u2014 not share a whole lot of it. He \u2014 he said \u2014 he said to me, so\nwhere were you when you were my age, you know. So I told him, that\u2019s how it\nstarted, so I told him. So he said, so \u2014 so what happened? And \u2014 but then you \u2014 you\n\u2014 you \u2014 you stop, because it\u2019s hard for \u2014 you don\u2019t want to burden a child like that,\nand many of the things that happened un \u2014 until he studies history, until \u2014 and that\u2019s\nwhat I felt with my own children, until they have the historical background, they\nwon\u2019t be able to \u2014 to grasp what happened. So I \u2014 no, I did not talk too much about\nit, no.",
        "A: Oh, he came \u2014 he was very lucky, he left Poland at the a \u2014 my husband did, at\nthe age of 17, because in eastern Poland where he was, the an \u2014 the anti-Semitism\nwas really quite a problem for \u2014 for all of them, especially for my husband. And he\nleft \u2014 actually, it\u2019s interesting, he really ri \u2014 left for a vacation, summer vacation, to\nlearn a little English. So his parents sent him to England. And a ye \u2014\n181March 1, 1999",
        "A: \u201938, a year before the war. And he was supposed to go back to Poland to finish\nhis last year of \u2014 of the gymnasium, of \u2014 to matriculate. And he fell in love with\nEngland and freedom, and \u2014 and he told his parents he\u2019s not going back, under no\ncircumstances. And they were very upset, because he hadn\u2019t finished high school,\nand \u2014 and he said he\u2019s not going back. And so he stayed in England and went to\nuniversity in England. Actually, he was able to convince the university in\nManchester, he wasn\u2019t able to do it in London, that his, what they call the small\nmatriculation, because there were two matriculations in Poland, one was at the age\nof 16 or 15, and then there was one an \u2014 the full one was at 18. And he had the little\none, and he had the \u2014 some sort of a diploma that that was it. And so he started\nuniversity in Manchester. And he decide \u2014 and he never went back, he \u2014 so he was\nlucky, because the war broke out a year later, and he was in England. So, he was in\nEngland, he finished the university in 1942. He came to America and he was\ndrafted, he was in the army. As a matter of fact, he was in the \u2014 1n the Battle of the\nBulge. He was \u2014 he was in Europe, he was overseas.

        "A: Yeah, I understand. Yes, when things \u2014 especially when the Germans were there\nin Poland and in Hungary, I often \u2014 I wasn\u2019t angry, I wasn\u2019t \u2014 I often wished that I\nwasn\u2019t Jewish because things would be easier, would be better, and I wouldn\u2019t \u2014 yes,\nbut I wasn\u2019t angry, I wouldn\u2019t say I was angry. It was more that I wished like when\nyou go to bed and you fantasize about something, I wished often that I wasn\u2019t\nJewish.",
        "A: They have changed in the sense that I no longer wish I wasn\u2019t Jewish. I just wish\nthat being Jewish, the way it is in America wouldn\u2019t be so \u2014 how shall I put it?\nWouldn\u2019t be such an important part of my life. I find it \u2014 there\u2019s just too much of it,\nit\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 being rai \u2014 I\u2014 you know, I wasn\u2019t raised in a home that was that Jewish,\nit\u2014 you were Jewish, you observed, my parents ob-observed Passover \u2014 after the\nwar I\u2019m now speaking. And \u2014 and Yom Kippur and Rosh Hashanah and that was\nbeing Jewish and \u2014 and nobody said you weren\u2019t Jewish, but that was about it. And\n183March 1, 1999\nit was wonderful, you had three big holidays a year, and so on. And here I find that\nit\u2019s just \u2014 I find it very confining, yes. But that has nothing to do with the war, I\nprobably would have found it very confining if I had \u2014 you know, if I had gotten\nfrom the kind of background I was from, into this kind of milieu, I may have found\nit very confining anyway. I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: No, no, you don\u2019t get it back, no. You lost it. And what I did feel very strongly\nwhen I had my own children was that I was very involved with them. I took care of\nthem myself, even though I didn\u2019t have to, and I enjoyed every moment of it,\nbecause I saw \u2014 you know, I enjoyed when they went to school, and \u2014 and \u2014 and\nenjoyed the fact that they enjoyed learning and did well. And \u2014 and enjoyed\nparticipating in day trips, and everything that \u2014 I spent a lot of time doing that, and I\nreally enjoyed it. Not always because of \u2014 for them, as I felt that I often relived a\npart of my life that I never had. So I think because of that \u2014 I loved, for instance \u2014 I\nwa \u2014 I\u2019m very f \u2014 very few women my \u2014 that I know, my friends, loved sitting in the\npark. I loved sitting in the park with those children and just observing them play.\nAnd \u2014 and the development, nobody ever concentrated on that, on my development,\nmy brother\u2019s development, you know, you \u2014 you were surviving, you weren\u2019t\ndeveloping. So that, I think I had from that, yes.\n184March 1, 1999",
        "A: No, I th\u2014I do though, think, or actually I did often, sort of, when they would turn\nseven, like when the war would break out, it\u2019s not that I rethought what happened to\nme so much as I sort of marked the time and said, this is when \u2014 when it started for\nme and \u2014 and look what they\u2019re like. And I was often amazed how \u2014 looking at\nthem, how childish they were, you know, here they \u2014 and \u2014 and when I think what I\nwas like at that age, that\u2019s when I realized what the war had done to me. At seven,\nyou know, I \u2014 I \u2014 even my grandchildren, I look at them, I mean, they \u2014 they\u2019re\nchildren. And when I think what I had to do and what I had to go through and what I\nhad to think when I was that age, yes, it\u2019s \u2014 so when these la \u2014 these mar \u2014 these\nages came, that \u2014 that were very significant in my life in terms of what happened to\nme, I would sort of look at them and say, my God, what was I like? How different\nwas I when they \u2014 when that happened \u2014 when \u2014 when I was that age, yes. But not\nthat I sat there and sort of reminisced, no. I\u2019m not that much of a reminiscing person.\nBut that did strike me, you know, when \u2014 when \u2014 and also the opportunities. But\nthen my husband says very often, rightly, that our generation, he also didn\u2019t have the\n185March 1, 1999\nopportunities that young people have today. Even though he \u2014 okay, he went to the\narmy, but \u2014 so \u2014 but \u2014 but \u2014 and he has a university education, but young pe \u2014 like\nBrenda, for instance, she could travel, she \u2014 she did, I mean, she did all these things.\nShe went to school, she traveled, she worked, she did all kinds of things before she\ngot married. We didn\u2019t have a chance to do any of that. The world has changed.\nYoung people also weren\u2019t as independent. But it often did sort of strike me how\ndifferent their life was, and I was determined, that I remember thinking, that I would\nmake sure that \u2014 that this should not happen to them. Yes, I di \u2014 in what way?\nMaybe by living here, or whatever, that \u2014 that I was hoping this would never happen\nto them. That I remember thinking, yes, that \u2014 that this kind of thing should not\nhappen to them.",
        "A: Another war like that, and another \u2014 not quite like that, but horrible things could\nhappen, sure. Of course, yes, yes, we have no \u2014 no way of making sure that it will\nnot happen. Maybe not in the same form. Probably not in the same form.",
        "A: Once, in a very strange way in \u2014 actually in Poland. We went back about two or\nthree times. My father had property in Poland, which I now have. And it was very\nstrange, it was the first time we went back, my husband and I, we were together.\n186March 1, 1999\nAnd it was in 19 six \u2014 no, 1973. And we went to \u2014 to Krak\u00e9w, and we ac \u2014 actually,\nit was the only time in my life, including the wars, interestingly enough, that I\nexperienced outspoken anti-Semitism. Because during the war I never experienced\nit. mean, I knew they were murdering Jews, but the Germans were doing it, and I\npersonally never did. I wasn\u2019t in school, so I never did. And \u2014 and the Polish people,\nI also have very strong opinions about people \u2014 Polish people helping Jews, because\nthose Jews who survived like I did, at one point or another had to be helped by\nChristians. Otherwise there was no hope, there was no way you could have survived.\nBut anyway, I wa \u2014 we were in Krakow and we went to visit Auschwitz. Was a\nSunday morning. And we came back, and both my husband and I speak Polish, and\nwe had \u2014 we took a taxi or a driver, or whatever. And we came back from\nAuschwitz, it must have been like two o\u2019clock Sunday, and \u2014 we went early in the\nmorning, and we were starved. So we wanted \u2014 but we didn\u2019t \u2014 you feel funny after\ngoing there, funny. You feel very strange. And we didn\u2019t want to go to some fancy\nplace for lunch, so we decided to ask the driver to just take us someplace where\nthere\u2019s some food, where workers go. You know, a normal kind of place. So \u2014 so he\nsaid, okay, he\u2019ll take us where he sometimes eats and many of the cab drivers and\nworkers eat there. So he said a very unpretentious kind of \u2014 that\u2019s what we were\nlooking for, something unpretentious. So he took us there, and it was crowded, and it\n187March 1, 1999\nwas unpretentious and it was very crowded, and they were seating people together\nwith other people. So we sat down \u2014 they told us to sit at a table where there was a\nyoung couple. They were speaking Polish. My husband and I were speaking\nEnglish, because \u2014 but of course, they were speaking Polish because they were\nPolish, and we understood every word. And we sat down and we \u2014 I don\u2019t know, we\nspoke about, I don\u2019t know what we spoke about, but we spoke English. And there\nwas no menu, so we got a big plate of sauerkraut, mashed \u2014 and big, big portions,\nsauerkraut, mashed potatoes and some sort of meat. And I\u2014 I\u2019m a very good eater,\nbut it was a huge portion, particularly there were a lot of these potatoes. So I\nfinished everything except about half the potatoes. And she, the young woman,\nturned to her whoever he was, escort or \u2014 or boyfriend or husband, I don\u2019t know\nwhat he was, and she said to him, look she \u2014 he s \u2014 she said \u2014 and it\u2019s true that at\nthat time there were still shortages in Poland \u2014 one always has to understand where\nit all comes from \u2014 and she said, look she\u2019s \u2014 he \u2014 she said, she didn\u2019t finish her\npotatoes. That \u2014 and so he said, yeah, I see, and then she said \u2014 she was more\nvirulent than he \u2014 she was virulent, he wasn\u2019t. And she said, they\u2019re probably not\ngood enough for her. And then she turned to him and said, look, she has this big\nJewish nose. It was the only time \u2014 and to this day I\u2019m really mad at myself that I\ndidn\u2019t say any \u2014 something. But I was so taken aback. Also, I was so innocently\n188March 1, 1999\naccused, because I just couldn\u2019t finish those potatoes. But the point was, that this\nwas the only time, in all my life \u2014 I told my husband \u2014 the only time that I\nexperienced anti-Semitism, you know, in its rawest kind of form. So, nothing, I\ndidn\u2019t finish the potatoes, and they left, and so on. I wasn\u2019t \u2014 they finished, I mean,\nth-they had \u2014 she made that one remark, and then she didn\u2019t focus on us at all. But it\nwas interesting. So that was the only time I really experienced sort of \u2014 and that was\nafter the war, way after the war.",
        "A: Well, it\u2019s a pretty terrible place to visit. First of all, I was grateful I didn\u2019t end up\nthere. But, you know, I\u2019ve seen photographs, I\u2019ve read about it, I knew about the\ncamps already, you know, right after the end of war. It just bore out what I knew\nwas \u2014 had happened, and how it had \u2014 how it looked and so on. So it was a horrible\nday and it\u2019s very depressing, but na \u2014 I didn\u2019t discover anything I didn\u2019t know, so \u2014",
        "A: After the war \u2014 well, during the war, we already knew that some of our relatives\nare \u2014 were killed. We were lucky to survive, all four of us, but we knew that some of\nthem were \u2014 my father\u2019s brothe \u2014 brother-in-law was killed, his niece was killed. I\n189March 1, 1999\nknew all of that, so it wasn\u2019t 1t \u2014 we didn\u2019t \u2014 they didn\u2019t wait til after the war, 1t was\n\u2014 some of them were shot before they were deported, those pe \u2014 so we knew, yes, I\nknew, of course. Tha-Tha \u2014 it wasn\u2019t a big discovery after the war. There were\nmaybe individual \u2014 again, my situation is very different from other people, because\nmy parents, as I probably said at the beginning, were very, very wealthy before the\nwar. And we are \u2014 were raised in Vienna by governesses and nurses. We had no\ncontact with other children. And also my parents fo \u2014 the families were in Poland.\nSo in 1938, when we went to Poland, we still had no contact with anybody. My\nmother was afraid of \u2014 of children\u2019s diseases. At that time there were all these\nconcerns. So I hardly \u2014 I didn\u2019t know my cousins, I didn\u2019t \u2014 I met them in Siberia,\nthose \u2014 th \u2014 but those were the ones that went from Siberia to Palestine, so I knew\nthey were safe and I knew them a little during that one year in Siberia. But I didn\u2019t\nknow my uncles, I didn\u2019t know my aunts. My parents didn\u2019t \u2014 it was not a terribly\nclose, enormous family, it was not. So I \u2014 contrary to other people like my \u2014 like my\nhusband, when we went back to Lw\u00e9w, to wa \u2014 and also, he was older. So when I\nwalked with him through Lw\u00e9w, he would show me, he \u2014 this is where Aunt So and\nSo lived, and this is where Aunt So and So lived, and this is where the school was,\nand this is where the synagogue was, and this was here, and this was there. I didn't\nhave all of that. I didn\u2019t \u2014 I didn\u2019t know where my relatives lived.\n190March 1, 1999",
        "A: Mike? Yes, he did. Yeah, he lost a good number, yes, yes. His grandparent \u2014 I\ndon\u2019t know, yes, a good \u2014 a good number, yes. And so did we actually, because my\n\u2014 my \u2014 couple of my cousins, my \u2014 two of my aunts on my father\u2019s side. My\nmother\u2019s side, an uncle who I never met. One of my cousins, yes, I \u2014 I lost some, he\nlost some, yes. But I didn\u2019t know them well.",
        "A: No, I do feel not two different people, I do feel very different from when I walk\ninto an American \u2014 into a room with Native Americans \u2014 it\u2019s not Native Americans,\nyou mean Jews who were born \u2014 born here, Americans who were born here. Yes,\nvery much so, yes. I do feel that. Don\u2019t forget, to this day I have an accent. So very\noften, to this day, I mean I still have a \u2014 an accent, I na \u2014 people can hear that I\nwasn\u2019t born here. So, to this day, people will ask me, you know, where are you\nfrom, and then they start, you know, asking you where you\u2019re from, or where were\nyou born. The next thing you know, they know that you went through the war,\nbecause in [indecipherable] figure out your age and so on. So they \u2014 unless I want\n191March 1, 1999\nto cut them short, which I do very often if I feel I don\u2019t want to talk about it, then P11\njust say, you know, I was born in Vienna, but I left when I was five. And then I\ndon\u2019t say where I left, I don\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t tell them that I went east instead of west. But\nyes, yes, I do feel different, yes, definitely.",
        "A: Definitely not Polish, but defi \u2014 I would say American. I \u2014 yes, I like this country\nthe most of any country that I\u2019ve lived in. I\u2019ve been very happy here. I like the\npolitical system. I think definitely American. But as I said, I think yesterday, that I\nstill feel \u2014 [inaudible, background noise] I still \u2014 you\u2019ll get that noise. [break] \u2014\nthat when I see the newspaper \u2014 I think I said that yesterday also, and there\u2019s some\nnews from Poland, I will read it, as opposed to let\u2019s say, news from Hungary,\nwhere I was a little while, and occasionally Pll look at it. But news from Poland I\nwill read, so I must have some sort of feeling about knowing the country, knowing a\nlittle about their problems, and being interested in it. Never read news about\nAustria, don\u2019t feel Austrian at all, even though I was born there. That I really don\u2019t.\nBut of course, we are all a little mixed up because we \u2014 because of the fact th-that\nwe didn\u2019t grow up here. You know, when you don\u2019t grow up someplace and you\nbecome naturalized much later in life, you probably feel differently. And also,\n192March 1, 1999\nEnglish is not my native language, I learned it much later. So, I think it has\nsomething to do with it. Today, for instance, and also interesting, during the Purim\ncelebration at JPDS, where I was with Jonathan today, they were singing all these\nPurim songs, it left me cold, I must say. But when they sang \u2014 what did they sing?\nNot the stars \u2014 \u201cAmerica, the Beautiful,\u201d I felt a twinge, I really did. So yes, I do\nlike this country.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t, my husband did. I really fe \u2014 was a very m \u2014 I did what \u2014 what was\nexpected of me. I didn\u2019t put any effort into that at all. My husband was the one who\ncared about it. And I didn\u2019t sabotage it, but I certainly didn\u2019t, you know, I didn\u2019t \u2014 I\nwanted my children to be Jewish, but I didn\u2019t put a great deal of effort into it. It\nwasn\u2019t may doing. If \u2014 1f\u2014 if it worked out, it was his doing.",
        "A: Y-Yes, but again, I don\u2019t \u2014 I\u2019m not proud of \u2014 of the way Americans feel Jewish.\nI \u2014 it \u2014 it \u2014 it actually upsets me. I don\u2019t like the fact that they\u2019re so \u2014 so sure of\nthemselves, so cocky, so \u2014 there\u2019s just \u2014 I keep thinking of it as just too much. Too \u2014\ntoo \u2014 politically when they also \u2014 all these \u2014 these pressure groups, and all this\nJewish stuff. And even Israel the way it\u2019s becoming today. This aggressiveness, and\n193March 1, 1999\nthis \u2014 you know, we are \u2014 we are different, we are better, we are th \u2014 it\u2019s just too\nmuch for me. Am I proud to be Jewish? Yes, in a quiet way, I\u2019m very proud to be\nJewish, but when it\u2019s \u2014 when it becomes overwhelming, and overbearing and then I-\nI don\u2019t like it.",
        "A: Oh, Germany \u2014\nEnd of Tape Six, Side A\nBeginning Tape Six, Side B",
        "A: We went to Germany about \u2014 when did we go? About eight or 10 years ago\nthere was an exhibition of \u2014 I don\u2019t remember what it was, it was a history of the\nJews, it was in germ \u2014 in Berlin, and one of my mother-in-law\u2019s paintings was at\nthat exhibition, so we \u2014 we decided to go. So we went, and I found it \u2014",
        "A: Oh, yes, owned, owned, owned. From her collection. I found \u2014 first, what you do\nis, what most people I think do is, you sort of look around and you figure out\nwhether this person was alive during the war or not. That\u2019s what most people do and\n194March 1, 1999\nI did that to some degree also. And I soon realized that most people were not alive,\nbecause they \u2014 they were younger, my age or younger. And even if they were my\nage, then they were children during the war, so then I started telling myself that you\ncan\u2019t \u2014 you know, you can\u2019t hold \u2014 think about that all the time, you just cannot.\nAnd would I want to live there? No. Do I hate them? No. You know, it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s hard\nto say what I think about them. I don\u2019t know whether they are any worse than \u2014 |\noften wonder what would happen in this country if there would be gradually, as very\ngradually our \u2014 th-the Nazi racial laws were \u2014 they didn\u2019t \u2014 they weren\u2019t done from\none day to the next. People don\u2019t realize that. It came on very gradually. If there\nwould be such laws passed against the black population, would we react, would we s\n\u2014 you know, some of us maybe the vi \u2014 but most of us would not. We would just sit\nquietly and \u2014 and \u2014 and probably not go out and help people and so on. So therefore\nI \u2014 I also know that helping was very, very difficult during the war. It was risky, it\nwas dangerous, it was more than \u2014 I mean, in Poland people who helped were\nexecuted. They \u2014 there was no trial, no anything if they were caught. So, under those\ncircumstances, would I do that for somebody else? Probably not. So therefore I have\nno \u2014 I don\u2019t hold it against them, I don\u2019t hate them. That\u2019s my feeling. I wouldn\u2019t\nwant to live there, but then I wouldn\u2019t want to live anywhere except here, so it\u2019s the\nsame \u2014 same thing. But I have \u2014 I \u2014 no, I don\u2019t hate \u2014 I don\u2019t hate that \u2014 hate them,\n195March 1, 1999\nno. Just like I don\u2019t hate the Poles for that one \u2014 I didn\u2019t enjoy that one anti-Semitic\nincident, but I don\u2019t hate them, no. I\u2019ve had some very good experiences with Polish\npeople as well. We were on a hiking trip, P\u2019Il never get \u2014 we went \u2014 my husband and\nI, we \u2014 one of the trips that we took, we went to Krakow about two \u2014 two or three\nyears ago when I start \u2014 when they started giving back property, we \u2014 I went, and we\nsaw lawyers and we did this and that and the other. And then there was a Polish\nholiday, so we suddenly found ourselves with three days or four days as \u2014 a\nweekend, and over the weekend, and so we decided to go to Zakopane. We had to\nremain, we had appointments afterwards. Zakopane is 1n the mountains, in the \u2014 in\nthe Tatra mountains. And both my husband and I enjoy hiking, they have wonderful\nwalks there, so we went. And we met \u2014 it was a sort of difficult, somewhat steep\nhike for us, and it was after a rain, and there was moss and it was a little slippery. So\nclimbing up was not bad, but I was afraid that it\u2019s not a loop. I wasn\u2019t sure it\u2019s a\nloop, and I was afraid of coming down the same trail. So, there was a young woman\nwith a better trail map than what we had, which was not very good. And she was\ngoing up and I \u2014 we asked her whether it was a loop and so on, and she said, yes, it\nwas a loop, we didn\u2019t have to come down the same way. And then she said she was\na very good hiker, and she said she\u2019s going ahead, but she has two or three friends\ncoming behind and they are slow, and they\u2019Il probably catch up with us, and we\n196March 1, 1999\nshould just follow them, and okay, thank you very much. We went up, and then sure\nenough there was a bu \u2014 they came up behind us and then we confirmed the route,\nand then they went ahead, and they were still faster than we. And eventually we \u2014\nwe met up with them again at the top where there was a beautiful overlook. And\ngoing \u2014 so, we already had talked with them, so we asked them about going down,\nwhich way the \u2014 you know, th-th-the \u2014 the trail, which was the best way to go down,\nthe easiest way, we were looking for. So they explained to us, and they explained to\nus that at some point there\u2019s going to be a V and we had to take an \u2014 but there was\nanother little trail, and then you had to take the left, but it was difficult. They said it\nwould be a little bit maybe difficult to find. So, we got there, to that point, and there\nthey were again. And they were sitting and waiting for us, and on the ground there\nwas, in little pebbles, they had made an arrow which one \u2014 but \u2014 and they showed us\nthat this is the arrow and they made it for us. And then I said, so why are you here?\nAnd they said, because we were really concerned about you, so we decided to wait\nfor you after all. I\u2019ve hiked in America, I\u2019ve hiked in \u2014 in Switzerland, we\u2019ve hiked\nin France, nothing like that ever happened to us. Did they know we were Jewish?\nProbably yes, because the way we speak Polish, th-they \u2014 we both speak well, but\nwe don\u2019t \u2014 y-you know, when you haven\u2019t been in a country for 45 years, even if\nyou speak continuously, it\u2019s a little \u2014 the language is a little different. And a-also,\n197March 1, 1999\nthey knew we had \u2014 were tourists, from the way we dress, from the way we \u2014 th-\nthere\u2019s no \u2014 I mean, nobody thought the \u2014 so that was very nice, very nice. Then we\nstarted talking some more, they invited us to their homes, but they \u2014 they were not\nfrom Zakopane, they were also there \u2014 they were someplace from the north of\nPoland where we wer \u2014 never went. But, you know, that was something and I\nthought it was very, very nice. Never happened anywhere else. So you can\u2019t tell.\nPeople are people, and they\u2019re different, and everybody\u2019s different.",
        "A: I think probably the language I speak in at the moment, but I do think probably in\nPolish quite often. But probably in the language \u2014 and people ask me what \u2014 what \u2014\nyou know, the classical question is what language do you dream in? I have no idea.\nBut probably the language I speak at the moment, I tend to \u2014 to do that. But I do \u2014\nwhen I am by myself, I think I sp \u2014 I think in Polish a lot.",
        "A: He went to Palestine and he opened a gallery, like he did be \u2014 like he had before\nthe war. He did extremely well, and the gallery was just closed about two years ago,\nwhen he died. But he lived there, and he was definitely a Zionist, was a da \u2014 Zionist\nbefore the war. He was very happy to be in Israel, traveled very often to Europe\n198March 1, 1999\nand bought and sold and \u2014 and so on. And died a well t \u2014 very well-to-do man. So he\ndid very well. And his children \u2014 his daught \u2014 he has two daughters and a son. His\nwife died a few years before him, and they\u2019re \u2014 and the children all live in Israel, all\nthree of them, and they\u2019re married and have children and so on, and I\u2019m in touch\nwith them.",
        "A: It was very hard, because he was also very sick for a long time before he died,\nand he was in a Senior citizen situation in \u2014 in Bat Yam, and I visit \u2014 I went all the\ntime when I was there, went all the time. But it was very \u2014 it was heartbreaking\nbecause he \u2014 it was hard to also figure out, you know, exactly what he had, because\n\u2014 it was probably a number of strokes, because in Israel I find they don\u2019t \u2014 it\u2019s not\nlike in America, in America people are very blunt, and the doctors tell the patient\nan-and you know exactly what, more or less, what the story is. Over there my\ncousins would say, well, you know, old age and so on. And it bothered me a lot\nbecause I couldn\u2019t get to the bottom of it, but he \u2014 he had \u2014 he was sick for a year,\nvery sick and \u2014 and \u2014 and then he died.\n199March 1, 1999",
        "A: Yeah, it was, it was both for me and for my brother. We ta \u2014 often talked about it,\nabout that, yeah. And when we went to Israel, one of my main reason \u2014 we have a\nhome in Israel, and \u2014 and we did that when our children were \u2014 were ha \u2014 our older\ndaughter was about 10 when we built the home. So we did that when they were\nyoung, and the reason was, actually, that we wanted them to speak Hebrew well, and\nnot \u2014 you know, spoken Hebrew, and get to know the country, and my husband was\nalways interested in hi\u2014 zi \u2014 he \u2014 he 1s a Zionist, always supported the state. He also\nhas an office in Israel, he also was business-wise active. But the main reason why I\nsupported the whole thing was because of my uncle. I mean, otherwise, I wouldn\u2019t\nhave wanted to have a house there, and so on. But \u2014 so we saw a lot of him when we\nwere there, all the time.",
        "A: I speak some Hebrew, yes. I learned it when I was \u2014 you know, I go there quite \u2014\nwe still go twice a year, all the time. And I \u2014 I don\u2019t speak terribly well, because \u2014\nmy husband speaks fluently and very, very well. But I just went to an old\n[indecipherable] in New York, and I found out exactly, the same as with my other\n200March 1, 1999\neducation, I learn languages by hearing, very easily. But because I never had any\nkind of Jewish education [indecipherable]. So I didn\u2019t \u2014 the \u2014 the class at the\n[indecipherable] was composed mostly of women who knew how to read very well,\nand knew how to pray, but couldn\u2019t put a sentence together, and I could speak very\nwell, but I couldn\u2019t read. So \u2014 and then they would sit there and start, you know\ndoing the diktuk(ph) and \u2014 and so on, and I dropped out, because that\u2019s not what I\nwas \u2014 I was interested in learning how to speak well, and \u2014 and so I learned it by be\n\u2014 first in the [indecipherable] basic things, then I had some private lessons and I go\nt \u2014 go to Israel all the time, so I understand well, and I speak well \u2014 well enough,\nbut I don\u2019t read it, and tha \u2014 it\u2019s a superficial kind of thing, but I don \u2014",
        "A: I remember the Eichmann trial, I was terribly happy that they caught him, and I\nthought it was a great trial, and was a great thing for Israel and I was all in favor of\nit. I can\u2019t say that I felt the same way when Demjanjuk was tried, and subsequent,\nyou know, that kind of thing. Because again, you \u2014 it\u2019s like with a very, you know,\nsuccessful event, it\u2019s hard to repeat it. And sometimes it\u2019s counterproductive.\n201March 1, 1999",
        "A: A little bit, because Eichmann was in Hungary, I don\u2019t know if you realize. He\nwas the one that \u2014 and there were \u2014 that\u2019s why the deportations from \u2014 from\nHungary were so efficiently done, because he came there and he did it very quickly\nand efficiently. So I kept hearing the name Eichmann. So it didn\u2019t stir memory \u2014\nwell, you know, I th \u2014 I was afraid it didn\u2019t \u2014 that we would be deported, we\nweren\u2019t. So, after the war, when he was caught, I was just glad that he was caught,\nand I thought it was a very worthwhile trial, both for Israel and for the world. That \u2014\nthat one trial I thought was great, but I don\u2019t like when they try these people who are\nnow in their 80s, and you know, like in France when they tried \u2014 who was it that\nthey were trying, was so old, and it\u2019s \u2014 it doesn\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t think it makes sense to\nput \u2014 to \u2014 for that kind of thing to \u2014 to be tried so many years later. You don\u2019t have\nthe witnesses, you don\u2019t have anything.",
        "A: I\u2019m not a very political person, wa \u2014 the only thing \u2014 no, not the civil rights, no, I",
        "A: Yes, I would say sensitivity, yes. When I read about what does happen, or\ndoesn\u2019t happen, especially now in New York, we have all these incidents with \u2014\n202March 1, 1999\nbecause of the police seems to overreact because of our present administration, I get\n\u2014 I read all of that and it upsets me. The other sensitivity that I have is that I became\naware of an organization called the Abraham Fund in New York, which is an\norganization that tries to promote better understanding and \u2014 and coexistence\nbasically, between Israeli Jews and Arabs, in \u2014 in Israel within the Green Line and\nI\u2019m very active with that, because I think that, you know, having, like my husband\nsaid, having been a second class citizen in a country like Poland, one knows what it\nfeels like to be an Arab in Israel, with the same problems of having an identity card,\nwhere you\u2019re \u2014 you know, the religion is stamped in and that sort of thing. So,\nbecause of that, I do have more of a sensitivity about that. But mainly in connection\nwith Israel, not so much with America, because in America, it\u2019s a problem that I\u2019m\nnot familiar enough with, or knowledgeable enough where I think, you know, that I\ncan actively make an enormous difference. So I just read about it.",
        "A: Historical books? Not so much historical as when there\u2019s something worthwhile,\nfrom a different point of view. For instance, I found that f\u2014 I don\u2019t remember what\nthe name of it was, a book that somebody recommended to me just last year, about\nwomen. It was called, between courage and something else. Not a very good title, I\n203March 1, 1999\nthought. A woman who is, I think a sociologi \u2014 a professor of sociology, whatever,\nand who wrote about women in Germany, ger \u2014 the Jewish women in Germany,\nbetween 1933 and \u201939. It wasn\u2019t even about the war. And I found \u2014 that kind of\nthing I find very interesting because it \u2014 it talked about how the structure of the\nfamily changed, as the men were losing their positions and were not allowed to wo \u2014\nto execute, let\u2019s say, doctors were not allowed to practice, you know, as the racial\nlaws progressed in Germany. Before the war, women tended to sometimes earn a\nliving, sometimes the men became so isolated and so discouraged and so\ndemoralized that the women were the f \u2014 th-the force behind the family. Also, when\nthey had the discriminatory laws against children in schools, it was the women who\nwent to the schools, and \u2014 and \u2014 and were 1n touch with the children, and heard\nabout all of that. Also, when the husband was arrested, which happened very often at\nthat point, or had some running in with the police, it was the women who went in\nand tried to \u2014 to talk to the police and tried to help the husbands. It totally changed\nthe structure of the family. The women became the \u2014 the stronger part of the family,\nvery often in \u2014 in a way that would not have happened at all, had it not been a \u2014 ina\n\u2014a-\u2014had this not happened. And I find that kind of thing interests me very much. It\n\u2014 It\u2019s partly, you know, German anti-Semitism, Holocaust, but it\u2019s not just a story of\nwhat somebody went through, but how it affected life and affected the families, and\n204March 1, 1999\naffected every-everything; how it changed things; how it showed \u2014 I \u2014 I \u2014 I also\nnoticed that in my own family, that my mother was the much more, somehow,\nresourceful person during the war than my father, who had a tremendous position\nbefore the war. But once all of this was taken away from him, he \u2014 it \u2014 and I, of\ncourse, as a child I never understood what was going on. That kind of thing interests\nme, that kind of thing I read. There was recently a book by a German man written,\ncalled \u201cThe Reader,\u201d did you read that?",
        "A: I find \u2014 that I find also very interesting; motivation, why and so on. Little \u2014 in\norder to \u2014 I read about the Holocaust only things that I \u2014 books that I think will give\nme more insight. That \u2014 that\u2019s the only reason why I read them. Otherwise I really\nam not interested.",
        "A: Not odor and not smell and not trains. What does trigger is music, I would say.\nAnd not some lofty music, but let\u2019s say if I hear someplace, in an old, whatever,\n\u201cLili Marlene.\u201d That triggers it. But \u2014 or the other day I saw, gee, a wonderful film,\nwhich I think is going to be released, called comede \u2014 \u201cComedian(ph)\nHarmonicum(ph).\u201d Did you hear about it?\n205March 1, 1999",
        "A: And that kind of music then triggers, but not, no, not trains and not \u2014 trains are so\ndifferent now, you know, what \u2014 what \u2014 I mean, if you take Amtrak from \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014",
        "A: Yeah, I know, no \u2014 yeah, but wa \u2014 the train itself is so different that it doesn\u2019t\ntrigger that, no, mm-mm, no, no.",
        "A: Snow, that\u2019s a good question, I 1 \u2014 st \u2014 I love it. I think it\u2019s beautiful when it falls.\nIn New York there was \u2014 when we had that \u2014 what was it, the storm \u2014 not storm,\nwhat did they call it? The blizzard, a few years ago, I at \u2014 and I went to the park, I\nsort of said to myself, here we have \u2014 what did we get, say 12 inches, 16 inches, I\ndon\u2019t know. And I remember \u2014 and I said to myself, this is lovely, but, you know,\nit\u2019s really not terribly much; they make such a fuss over it. But what we had in\nSiberia, the snow falls and it di \u2014 never, ever melts. And I remember when we were\ngoing to this school there, there was like a little \u2014 it was like a corridor and on both\nsides the snow came up to practically my \u2014 to my shoulders, I \u2014 just my little head\nwas out there. So \u2014 and it was like that for months and months. So, yes, I did think\nabout that for a moment, but just as a joke, rather than \u2014 you know, it doesn\u2019t trigger\nanything horrible.\n206March 1, 1999",
        "A: Messages to my grandchildren. I hope it never happens to them. No. I hope they\nhave good lives, and then you know, will \u2014 will just see this as an interesting thing\nthat happened to one of their grandparents. No, nothing special.",
        "A: You\u2019re very welcome. You\u2019re very welcome, I hope it, you know, it\u2019s of interest\nto somebody at some time. My grandson today asked me about this, my eight year\nold, why are you doing this? Why are you telling Gail about this? So I said to her \u2014 I\nsaid to him, it\u2019s going to go to the museum, the Holocaust Museum. And he \u2014 and he\nsaid why? And I said, well, you know, maybe someday somebody is going to study\nabout what happened in Europe at that time, and maybe they\u2019Il look for somebody\nwho was not very old, or was still a child and was in Hungary. And they\u2019|l look up\nin the index and they\u2019ll look up Hungary, and there\u2019II be one other story, it will be\ndifferent from what Hungarian children went through, because I\u2019m \u2014 wasn\u2019t\nHungarian, I \u2014 and ho \u2014 he said oh. That was the end of that. So, I tried to explain to\nhim wa \u2014 what this is good for. So I hope in that sense that, you know, it\u2019s good for\nthat.\n207March 1, 1999",
