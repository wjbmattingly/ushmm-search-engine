And then there came...uh,\nthere was a Polish woman, a dancer; and she started a small group. And I heard, and I was\nengaged for two weeks. But because I got terrible [allergies always (ph)], during the\nrehearsal I left the company again. And then we went with this first woman I had class with,\nand who made this [fantasist (ph)| ballet. She made the ballet about the uh setting, about the\ntime during the war; and with that company, we went to Copenhagen for the Concours. And\nwhen we came back--there was only half an hour--and um when we came to uh, back to\nAmsterdam, we thought it was a pity because there wasn't ballet. And then we made\nwith a few other people a new company...",

A friend of mine said the other day to\nme--the man, that friend whom you met yesterday--he said, \"The only thing you had to have\nis mazel.\" And it's true. It's true.",
        "Q: So what company did you dance with then, after the war?",
        "A: After I was danced with this Ballet de Laaglanden, the Lowlands Ballet, Ballet of the\nLowlands. And in in '50..'54, I suddenly stopped dancing. I was only 41 or so. I was not old.\nAnd I started a studio for myself, already; and then afterwards, I had to do with the company\nof young Skapino Ballet. And I gave them training, and I made a lot of ballets for them. And\nso I stopped with everything when...when I became director of the Academy of Dancing...",
        "Q: Which one?",
        "A: Skapino Dance Academy. And that was a part of the theater school afterwards. I started in\n'55 for myself; and then I got acquainted with Skapino, , the director, and so it grew\nand grew. And there again I had a lot of luck.",

        "Q: Can you tell me about some of the things you've choreographed?",
        "A: Hmm?",
        "Q: Can you tell me about some of the things you've choreographed, about your students?",
        "A: Well, I choreographed for the company always, uh...well, abstract ballets, and, and story\nballets. And, uh, for my students, I made everything because, uh, I had to do with the smaller\nones and it had grown up. And I did all kinds of things; even when I was 64, I did in the\nballet Coppelia, the old man... because one of the pupils fell ill a week before the\nperformance, so I had to take the part. It was very nice.",
        "Q: Are there certain individuals you've enjoyed dancing with the most?",

        "Q: Have there been any other...have there been exceptional students ?",
        "A: Pupils of mine? Yes, a few. Yes, certainly there have. A few with the National Ballet now,\nand a few of the boys will become one of the...they became good choreographers. The\nyounger ones at the moment are nearly all ex-pupils of mine, that they're all 30 or 40",
        "Q: May I ask...when did you find out what had happened to your family?",
        "A: Shortly after the war, of course, when they brought all these lists and.... But my father came\nback from Theresienstadt, and my second sister came back. And then, as I say I, I don't know\nwhere they died. I don't know; because the family should know, but I didn't want to hear\nabout it.",
        "Q: Is there anything you'd like to add?",
        "A: Huh?",
        "Q: Is there anything else you'd like to add?",
        "A: Ah, no. Many things happened during the war. I always felt...sometimes very interesting, but\nwell..you have...you certainly will have much more stories told than I can tell you. When\nthese people what I told you about in in Hausen (ph) were all taken away. They all were\ntaken away; and afterwards, a few months afterwards, we got the message that uh there were\npapers in the house left from the underground. And they had, um, one daughter; and it\nwas...when these people would have, had been married really--the German Communist with\nthe Jewish woman--then the child was not Jewish, and uh...at the moment. Then they\ntook...they didn't take the girl away [NB: the Germans regarded her as non-Jewish, and\ntherefore did not take her]. She was hidden in the house by the doctor, I think. And then a\nfew days later, we heard that...well, we had to find out that these people were not married at\nall. So the underground knew that this child was...should been taken next day. So we were\nwith a few people, and we took this child away from this house in...early in the morning. She\nlives now in East Germany, and uh I often see her. She's now a grandmother already.",
        "Q: You and who else took the child?",
        "A: Now, I didn't took the child. Marion [von] Binsbergen, Marion Pritchard [NB: the reference\nis to the same individual, under first her maiden and then her married names]...she was\nleading. And the parents of this child always tell them everywhere that I did it, and I gave up\nto contradict them. Even the books they have written this, and Marian has it now. As if I, I\nuh rescued the child; and it was not me. It was Marion who did it. Because there wasn't...they\nhave told she had spoken with this doctor, and he should be away early in the morning and\nhis wife should open the door. And when we came she didn't dare. She didn't open the door,\nand uh Marian took in hand and took the child away. She hit this woman. She knocked her\ndown, and took the child away.",
        "Q: She essentially kidnapped her?",
        "A: Yes, quite true. Yes, fortunately. Otherwise she would have gone to concentration camps.",
        "Q: Were you with Marian? You were with Marian at the time?",
        "A: Well, we saw each other.",
        "Q: Well, in this particular instance?",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes. But it was just an incident. And uh when we took, afterwards we tried to find\nthese papers 1n the house. And that's like a a story in a play, you know? Because I told you I\ndid a lot of uh movement exercises and then I had to...I had one...woman [where] I was\nhidden...she climbed up the house and uh threw something through the window. And she\nthrow everything out in our house what she could find, also the papers that they are looking\nfor. And I stood outside...it was outside the, the village; and I was looking around and I was\nlaughing a little bit...that I don't what I should do 1f somebody came. I didn't know what to\ndo, and nothing happened.",
        "Q: You knew the person who was throwing them out? I'm a little confused. Who was throwing\nthem out?",
        "A: The the woman who, um...where I was hidden. She was also underground...engaged with\npeople. And it was like a comic scene. It was...1t was in the middle of the night, and we were\nnot allowed to be on the street; and we took the mattresses and everything out of the house. It\nwas ridiculous.",
        "Q: Are there other such stories that you can recall?",
        "A: Uh hmm...",
        "Q: Do you have other such stories that you can recall?",
        "A: No. I don't think so, but I...no. I only recall that uh uh...I told you my sister was...came to us,\nand afterwards she went to uh a peasant family. But she couldn't travel with her bags. And so\nwe said, \"Well, we come...we come after you, afterwards, a few days later with all your\nluggage.\" And this woman where I was hidden, she--uh, Mrs. [Hanneloos (ph)]--she, uh,\nwas weaver and so she had to buy wool. So we went there, and we said, \"Well, of course, we\nare here to find wool.\" I, I don't think there was one sheep, but that didn't matter. And when\nwe came after a long trip to this village, there came then policeman and said, \"What are you\nuh...what are you doing here?\" So we said, \"Well, we are looking for, uh, wool.\" He said,\n\"Well, I don't think so that it's true. I think you are going to Mrs. De Vrieses (ph),\"--my\nsister--\"who 1s hidden away with Frau Haut (ph).\" And it was true. But we said, \"No, we\ndon't know anything about that. We were just looking for wool.\" And I show him...\"Show\nyour passports,\" and I gave to him. It was good and he gave it back. And my, uh, guest, uh,\nwoman, how you say? She gave hers, and he said to her, \"Well, this is false.\" And I said to\nthis man, \"Well, how can you say that? Of course, it 1s not false! Otherwise we would be\nmuch more nervous.\" And he said to me, \"Well, you needn't be nervous. I can see that. But\nthis woman 1s totally...\" Uh...uh...how do you call that? \"Bleak... have lost all color, you\nknow.\" And then he said, \"Well, it's alright. Go to this house; because you needn't be afraid.\nI made the hiding places for Mrs. [De Vries (ph)].\" And when we came there, they laughed\na little bit. But again, the luck.... This man was after the war, had been I think ten or twenty\nyears 1n prison because he had given people to the Nazis; and by chance not my sister and\nnot us. Luck...mazel.",
        "Q: Anything else that you'd like to add or ?",
        "A: No, no, I don't...1t was not a very interesting time. It was a nice time, and we followed\neverything and we thought what we should do after the war. And I wanted to dance again.\nAnd that happened.",
        "Q: Was it hard putting your life back together again after the war?",
        "A: No, no. No, not at all. No. I got a room...I got an engagement since I couldn't...I don't...I don't\nremember. I'm not so very much interested in money, so I really don't remember where that\nmoney came from after the war; but somebody have given it to me for a while and then\nwe...I got an engagement in .",

And, uh, and then I uh went with this woman and a few dancers to Brussels.\nBecause she was very ambitious, and she had made a ballet about something that happened\nin Holland where the government threw bombs on their own war...warship because of some\nmutiny; and she made a ballet about that. And after that all theaters were forbidden for her.\nSo we left Amsterdam for Brussels.",
        "A: I don't remember. I think it was about...I think it must have been about in the '30's...'35 or\nsomething like that... '34 or '35.",
        "A: Oh, just marvelous. I liked it very much. I still like it. Again, it was marvelous. It was very\nfree city, and uh I had no troubles at all, mixed...and mixed friends...not Jews, not only Jews;\nand we had all kind of friends.",
        "A: In the first year nothing happened. Nothing happened. My mother had died already,\nand...well, life went on. They were very smart, the Germans. Everybody thought, \"Well, this\nis it.\" And I could...I was then at another company, another ballet company. And uh in the\nfirst year nothing happened. And the second year the trouble started. Of course, the Jews\nwere thrown out, out of the company.",
        "A: The company was called \"Yvonne George.\" Yvonne George was the dancer and\nchoreographer, and she made this company.",
        "A: Well, the moment that they had to move to uh, to the Jewish quarter, that I knew\nimmediately that I would go underground--or how do you call 1t?--and, uh, I had a very nice\nhouse, small house, in the Jewish quarter. It was a small uh flat. And we had about 45\nperformances in the Jewish uh theater, only Jews; and they were marvelous\nperformances...opera and operetta and uh...you know. And then suddenly I got notice where\nI could hide. It was quite near Amsterdam.",
        "A: Yes. Yes, sure. Yes.",
        "A: Hmm?",
        "A: I don't think so. No. No. No. I, the other family... the other family, I don't know. I, I had little\ncontact with uncles and aunts and things like that, and I don't know anybody who left\nHolland.",
        "A: What kind of ballets? Well, all kind of ballets... Dutch, Dutch choreographers...this German\nwoman, Yvonne George, made marvelous ballets. They were uh little abstract ballets, and\nthere were story ballets, and uh she did.... For example, the first thing I did was a Coppelia;\none of the...one of the boys, of course. And it was a very pleasant company, not too big; and\nso I danced there until '42. And then I went to the hiding address, and it was a marvelous\naddress in, in, near Amsterdam.",
        "A: I must say you notice...I notice...noticed nothing. I am a very strange character. I didn't want\nto hear about it. I knew I would hide, and I didn't see my family anymore because they were\nalready in hiding places and uh.... Of course, you didn't know where...nobody knew anything\nabout anybody. And uh I got uh...because I...at that time I was very blond, and blue-eyes;\nand so for Germans, it was unthinkable that I was Jewish. So I was very free to walk around\nand to do everything I wanted to do.",
        "A: I don't know. I don't know, because my eldest sister and brother [NB: -in-law], I heard\nafterwards went I think a little...nght after I went; but I didn't see them anymore. And, uh,\nthey went in hiding in a place near, quite near Amsterdam. And there was a minister, you\nknow...a ____ minister, from what I heard afterwards from my other brother-in-law. And he\nsaid to my brother-in-law, \"Do you have a lot of money with you?\" And he had. \"And don't\nyou think it's better that you give it to me?\" And he said, \"Well, yes.\" And then the next day\nhe was thrown out...of the house, of the hiding place. And then my sister was a very nervous\nperson. She wanted to go back to her own house, which was already more or less raided by\nthe neighbors. But she got things back, and they waited until the Germans came to fetch\nthem.",
        "A: Hmm?",
        "A: No, no. I think '43, '42...1 don't know.",
        "A: I had a strange, but it was...I had a marvelous time. It was a marvelous house, and there was\na woman there that.... I had a big studio where I could train every day, and so I even had the\nvitality to give performance there. So the performance was a (laughter)...I had a little\ngramophone which I had still at that time to turn 'round. It was very nice.",
        "A: No, no. In [Hausen (ph]), in the quarry pits. About a half an hour from Amsterdam. In the\ncountry.",
        "A: I went on the train, just. And I went there [with] an address, or something like that; and I\ncame there and told who I were. I had another name at the time already.",
        "A: I had to.\nEnd of Tape #1\nTape #2\nTECHNICAL CONVERSATION",
        "A: Yes. Well, that was very nice and uh, and the most important thing for me was then that I\ncould train every day; even with winter, with woolen things and cotton gloves on my hand.\nBut it was very nice and this woman tried to do with me. It was a very good understanding\nbetween us. I stayed there for three years.",
        "A: For a few friends of this woman...she was also (laughter) of the society, grown up, the\ntheosophic society. That is 1n this little town, it was the center there; and so she had a lot of\ngood friends, but they didn't know that I was uh hidden. They thought I was bombed out of\nThe Hague. That was our story. She had family in The Hague; and so she made the nephew\nwho was bombed out, and I took her name and I got the right, uh, papers.",
        "A: No. No.",
        "A: A lot of news. First of all, we had a radio; and there were papers, underground papers, and\nwe got somehow. And you read a lot.",
        "A: Well, it was hidden somewhere in the house, and uh we were very lucky that when there\nwas, the Nazi are in the house that they didn't find it; and they didn't find me either.",
        "A: Oh well, at first it was all the training. And then I started...she was a weaver, and so she had\nwool; and I started to uh make wool, you know? And we read a lot, and we walked a lot; and\nuh we had a very ordinary life and the shopping in the nearest town. And uh, and in...when I\nwas shopping there in Hilversum, suddenly I saw my brother--who was in uh, in Holland\n....1n the concentration camp in Holland--and uh went (pause)... and I went up to him and I\nsaid, \"Mr. Poons, how are you?\" He said, \"I don't know you.\" I said, \"Yes, but I am your\nbrother.\" And then we talked for ten minutes; and I asked, \"Why don't you uh, go hiding?\"\nHe said, \"I can't. They don't do anything to me. I have in uh...\" Westerbork, 1s it?...\"my wife\nand children are there, so I can't stay away. And I have all the supervision of everything\nthat's printed, so they will not do nothing to me.\"",
        "A: He just was permitted to, to, to do the purchases for the for the printery. But he was also\nkilled, was in a concentration camp afterwards.",
        "A: No, I don't think so; because they were sure he would come back. He was quite alone there,\nbecause of his wife and his work, what he did there.",
        "A: Because I was blond. I wasn't blond before the war; and during the war there was a lot of\nperoxide (laughter) and...",
        "A: Yes. Yes.",
        "A: Yes. First very uh...the first time they were very bad papers of an acquaintance, of the pianist\nof the company. And then I suddenly was in a shop, and the owner of the shop said to me...it\nwas an empty shop...\"Do you need good papers?\" And I was a little bit, uh, taken back, and\nsaid, \"Well, I don't know.\" And I asked this woman where I lived...she said, \"Oh, yes. It's\nalright.\" And the next day I went and said, \"Well, this offer you made me yesterday, it's\nalright. Now somebody will come to you.\" And comes someone.... We became very, very\ngood friends afterwards, because he was a...he spoke fluently Dutch. I thought he came from\nthe eastern part of the country. But it was a German Communist, married with a Jewish\nwoman...one child; and they had a house quite near us where about thirty people were\nhidden. All her family were there. And it was very strange, because uh he said to me, \"Do\nyou have any work?\" I said, \"Oh, there is nothing to draw.\" I was drawing. It was in my\npapers that it was...how do you call it? Graphics. He said, \"No, I don't mean that. I mean, of\ncourse, are you still doing something in dance?\" I said, \"How do you know that you're...that\nI'm a dancer?\" And he said, \"My wife is a dancer, too; and she saw you many times in, here\nin [Hausen (ph)| walking.\" And then afterwards I met her; and we took the vitality to, to rent\na studio in a nearby city, near my village, and we went to train there for a while. And then\nthey were uh, um...they were all taken away by Germans, of course. It was somewhat",
        "A: Who did that?",
        "A: The whole family. All of them.",
        "A: No. Well, I was dancing only with this one woman. And I never saw the other ones who\nlived in that house. I never came to that house, only a few moments. And I had the luck there\nthat this woman had said to me, \"If there is something wrong with your bike, or something\nelse, we always know people who can make it all right.\" And so one day we had given...on a\nFriday night, we took our bikes there and we could get them on Monday; and we had given\nthem books to read and they had given us books to read. We were on the...on the verge of uh\ngoing there to fetch books and the bikes; and we were outside and I said to the woman...I\nwasn't living...\"Let us wait for the postman.\" He was in the house nearby. And the postman\nsaid, \"Well, you have heard about it?\" That the Germans are at this moment in the house\nwhere they are. So then I went...we went back. And I had to leave this house, of course,\nbecause...because it was too dangerous. Perhaps they found out letters or.... And so I...I didn't\nknow what to do. And I had met just, before I went away from Amsterdam...I uh had a lunch\nwith friends--an actor and and friend of his who was student in [Maarthen (ph)]--and they\nwas having lunch with me, in the Jewish part of the town, of course. And then we were\nhaving luncheon; and I don't know why but I had all the family silver... the forks and spoons\nand..., and then soon there was a ring at the door. You can't imagine it now. And there were\ntwo very uh, well, violent persons and they came to fetch the silver...",
        "A: Yeah...Anaz...Nazis, of course. And they were very polite. And I said, \"Well, they are all on\nthe table. Take it away.\"",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: I couldn't tell you. They just tried, perhaps; or they knew from someone. And then this\nstudent boy, this...certainly he was--his wife was his screen...he said to me when they left, \"If\never you are in trouble, you can...here is my phone number in [Maarthen (ph)], where I live.\"\nAnd at that time...I mean....'44, '43...1 phone him. And he said, \"Well, come to me.\" And I\nstayed with him for a fortnight, and everything was clear again; and afterwards he came to\nus, when they started to go after the students.",
        "A: Well, excellent. We had a nice time together.",
        "A: Oh, yes. I went everywhere. I went even to a performance in a nearby city of the company\nwhere I was in; and it was a little bit stupid, but nothing happened. And uh I went shopping.\nAnd nobody paid any attention to me, ever. And only when there was a razzia in this...in the\nvillage, in the street where I lived, and I was uh.... Well, we lived in a nice house, a nice\nvilla; and uh next to us there were two...a German brother and sister lived there. But they\nwere already for thirty or forty years in Holland, and never spoke German. And in the\nmorning, at seven o'clock in the morning, suddenly I heard that they were speaking German;\nand I said to the woman...I said, \"Please go and have a look.\" And she went out to have a\nlook, and she...she said to me...she made a sign; and we had a marvelous hiding place in the\nhouse. And I went there in two minutes. And then they came in.",
        "A: The Germans.",
        "A: Under the floor.",
        "A: Well, they were...looked everywhere but they didn't find me and they didn't find anything.\nThey didn't...by, by sheer luck, they didn't find even my uh, my uh clothes. They were\nhidden every night away in a.... And then I heard them come in to the uh bathroom, but it\nwas so nice and so well done that they couldn't imagine that there was an entrance to the, uh\nunder the floor; so I laid there down. It was all over with, with blankets and everything. And\nafter a while I heard this woman laughing with them outside because she was glad that they\nwere outside... out of the house.",
        "A: Never...no, no. I had only been for for two hours... never again. I never...I never hid. I think\nthe best thing was not to hide.",
        "A: No, no. Yes. My sister, my second sister, was uh hidden in the north of the country. And\nthey escaped from the Germans, also by a good hiding place; and my sister and her daughter\ncame to us, and this woman where I lived found them a place nearby, and afterwards another\nplace [in another part of the (ph)| country.",
        "A: I went to Amsterdam, looking if I could find somebody.",
        "A: I must...the war finished...5th of May...6th...7 May. I went walking to Amsterdam, and I had\na good friend there who would...who made it possible for me to hide because he was\nsolicitor. And he told me afterwards he had a lot of uh Fascist clients, and all the money he\ngot from them he gave me; because I had to live and I had no money.",
        "A: No. That was during the war.",
        "A: Huh?",
        "A: Well, from the beginning that I was hidden, he took care of me.",
        "A: Three years. Exactly three years. July 28th, 1942 until May '45.",
        "A: No. We didn't know anything about it. We just travel in the beginning of the war. You didn't\nknow where to go where to go. You didn't know what to do. You were with friends who\nwere...well, didn't let you go. And they...they managed to get money from all kind of\npeople...from....",
        "A: Hmm?",
        "A: No. Nothing happened. I told you, nothing happened to me. I lived a very comfortable life\nthere for three years. A big garden. And next time you come to Holland, I'll show you\npictures of the time, dancing in the garden.",
        "A: Well, the first thing of course we knew it and we heard it. Everybody shouted; and\ncelebrating immediately. And then I went to Amsterdam after a few days.",
        "A: Who liberated us there? (Pause) I don't know. (Laughing) I don't remember. I think Polish\npeople...and, uh, English people...Canadians. No...Canadians. Yes, right. Canadians.",
        "A: No. I was immediately away there. I went to Amsterdam, because I lived there.",
        "A: No, because at liberation day I was still in this place; so there was not much work.... Well,\nthere was a little bit of feasting, but there were no...no uh people at that time. So it\nwas just everybody was uh...the flag outside the house in the front, and the Queen's uh\nportrait everywhere, you know.",
        "A: Well, they shouting...there were people who shouted, and phoned us. There was still phone.",
        "A: Well, at first I... went to this friend of mine; and we, we, we, I found very quickly my sister\nand uh her daughter back in Amsterdam. And my brother-in-law. And then there came...uh,\nthere was a Polish woman, a dancer; and she started a small group. And I heard, and I was\nengaged for two weeks. But because I got terrible [allergies always (ph)], during the\nrehearsal I left the company again. And then we went with this first woman I had class with,\nand who made this [fantasist (ph)| ballet. She made the ballet about the uh setting, about the\ntime during the war; and with that company, we went to Copenhagen for the Concours. And\nwhen we came back--there was only half an hour--and um when we came to uh, back to\nAmsterdam, we thought it was a pity because there wasn't ballet. And then we made\nwith a few other people a new company...",
        "A: That was Mascha TerWeeme, and [Florrie Hodlechko (ph)], and the dancers of the time;\nand [| _-_ De Donke (ph)|.",
        "A: Huh?",
        "A: Well, I knew her before the war. She was in the same company with Yvonne George. She\nwas the first dancer at the time. And now, I don't know...and she lived in Amsterdam, so I\nwent up to her...it's very easy. She lived at the same address, so there was no difficulty at all.",
        "A: I can't...I don't know. Of, of course I don't know, because I wasn't there.",
        "A: Excellent. A marvelous time. I liked dancing. I liked uh...I did teaching; I liked teaching, and\nuh that's what I said ...you had, you had to have luck. A friend of mine said the other day to\nme--the man, that friend whom you met yesterday--he said, \"The only thing you had to have\nis mazel.\" And it's true. It's true.",
        "A: After I was danced with this Ballet de Laaglanden, the Lowlands Ballet, Ballet of the\nLowlands. And in in '50..'54, I suddenly stopped dancing. I was only 41 or so. I was not old.\nAnd I started a studio for myself, already; and then afterwards, I had to do with the company\nof young Skapino Ballet. And I gave them training, and I made a lot of ballets for them. And\nso I stopped with everything when...when I became director of the Academy of Dancing...",
        "A: Skapino Dance Academy. And that was a part of the theater school afterwards. I started in\n'55 for myself; and then I got acquainted with Skapino, , the director, and so it grew\nand grew. And there again I had a lot of luck.",
        "A: My private life?",
        "A: Well, you know I met my friend in '51, and we had a very happy life. (Pause--weeping) It's\nyour fault, you asked me. Now and then, I went on giving classes and being Director of this\nschool, this academy. And I've really had a very nice life.",
        "A: Hmm?",
        "A: Well, I choreographed for the company always, uh...well, abstract ballets, and, and story\nballets. And, uh, for my students, I made everything because, uh, I had to do with the smaller\nones and it had grown up. And I did all kinds of things; even when I was 64, I did in the\nballet Coppelia, the old man... because one of the pupils fell ill a week before the\nperformance, so I had to take the part. It was very nice.",
        "A: Hmm?",
        "A: Well, in a big company and I dance with a colleague a lot of duets. It's a [pas de donke (ph)],\nand we made them ourselves. And when you're in a company you have to dance with\neverybody, you know. That's just the fun of it.",
        "A: Pupils of mine? Yes, a few. Yes, certainly there have. A few with the National Ballet now,\nand a few of the boys will become one of the...they became good choreographers. The\nyounger ones at the moment are nearly all ex-pupils of mine, that they're all 30 or 40",
        "A: Shortly after the war, of course, when they brought all these lists and.... But my father came\nback from Theresienstadt, and my second sister came back. And then, as I say I, I don't know\nwhere they died. I don't know; because the family should know, but I didn't want to hear\nabout it.",
        "A: Huh?",
        "A: Ah, no. Many things happened during the war. I always felt...sometimes very interesting, but\nwell..you have...you certainly will have much more stories told than I can tell you. When\nthese people what I told you about in in Hausen (ph) were all taken away. They all were\ntaken away; and afterwards, a few months afterwards, we got the message that uh there were\npapers in the house left from the underground. And they had, um, one daughter; and it\nwas...when these people would have, had been married really--the German Communist with\nthe Jewish woman--then the child was not Jewish, and uh...at the moment. Then they\ntook...they didn't take the girl away [NB: the Germans regarded her as non-Jewish, and\ntherefore did not take her]. She was hidden in the house by the doctor, I think. And then a\nfew days later, we heard that...well, we had to find out that these people were not married at\nall. So the underground knew that this child was...should been taken next day. So we were\nwith a few people, and we took this child away from this house in...early in the morning. She\nlives now in East Germany, and uh I often see her. She's now a grandmother already.",
        "A: Now, I didn't took the child. Marion [von] Binsbergen, Marion Pritchard [NB: the reference\nis to the same individual, under first her maiden and then her married names]...she was\nleading. And the parents of this child always tell them everywhere that I did it, and I gave up\nto contradict them. Even the books they have written this, and Marian has it now. As if I, I\nuh rescued the child; and it was not me. It was Marion who did it. Because there wasn't...they\nhave told she had spoken with this doctor, and he should be away early in the morning and\nhis wife should open the door. And when we came she didn't dare. She didn't open the door,\nand uh Marian took in hand and took the child away. She hit this woman. She knocked her\ndown, and took the child away.",
        "A: Yes, quite true. Yes, fortunately. Otherwise she would have gone to concentration camps.",
        "A: Well, we saw each other.",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes. But it was just an incident. And uh when we took, afterwards we tried to find\nthese papers 1n the house. And that's like a a story in a play, you know? Because I told you I\ndid a lot of uh movement exercises and then I had to...I had one...woman [where] I was\nhidden...she climbed up the house and uh threw something through the window. And she\nthrow everything out in our house what she could find, also the papers that they are looking\nfor. And I stood outside...it was outside the, the village; and I was looking around and I was\nlaughing a little bit...that I don't what I should do 1f somebody came. I didn't know what to\ndo, and nothing happened.",
        "A: The the woman who, um...where I was hidden. She was also underground...engaged with\npeople. And it was like a comic scene. It was...1t was in the middle of the night, and we were\nnot allowed to be on the street; and we took the mattresses and everything out of the house. It\nwas ridiculous.",
        "A: Uh hmm...",
        "A: No. I don't think so, but I...no. I only recall that uh uh...I told you my sister was...came to us,\nand afterwards she went to uh a peasant family. But she couldn't travel with her bags. And so\nwe said, \"Well, we come...we come after you, afterwards, a few days later with all your\nluggage.\" And this woman where I was hidden, she--uh, Mrs. [Hanneloos (ph)]--she, uh,\nwas weaver and so she had to buy wool. So we went there, and we said, \"Well, of course, we\nare here to find wool.\" I, I don't think there was one sheep, but that didn't matter. And when\nwe came after a long trip to this village, there came then policeman and said, \"What are you\nuh...what are you doing here?\" So we said, \"Well, we are looking for, uh, wool.\" He said,\n\"Well, I don't think so that it's true. I think you are going to Mrs. De Vrieses (ph),\"--my\nsister--\"who 1s hidden away with Frau Haut (ph).\" And it was true. But we said, \"No, we\ndon't know anything about that. We were just looking for wool.\" And I show him...\"Show\nyour passports,\" and I gave to him. It was good and he gave it back. And my, uh, guest, uh,\nwoman, how you say? She gave hers, and he said to her, \"Well, this is false.\" And I said to\nthis man, \"Well, how can you say that? Of course, it 1s not false! Otherwise we would be\nmuch more nervous.\" And he said to me, \"Well, you needn't be nervous. I can see that. But\nthis woman 1s totally...\" Uh...uh...how do you call that? \"Bleak... have lost all color, you\nknow.\" And then he said, \"Well, it's alright. Go to this house; because you needn't be afraid.\nI made the hiding places for Mrs. [De Vries (ph)].\" And when we came there, they laughed\na little bit. But again, the luck.... This man was after the war, had been I think ten or twenty\nyears 1n prison because he had given people to the Nazis; and by chance not my sister and\nnot us. Luck...mazel.",
        "A: No, no, I don't...1t was not a very interesting time. It was a nice time, and we followed\neverything and we thought what we should do after the war. And I wanted to dance again.\nAnd that happened.",
        "A: No, no. No, not at all. No. I got a room...I got an engagement since I couldn't...I don't...I don't\nremember. I'm not so very much interested in money, so I really don't remember where that\nmoney came from after the war; but somebody have given it to me for a while and then\nwe...I got an engagement in .",
        "A: No. It's enough.",
