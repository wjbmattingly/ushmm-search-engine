        "Q: Would you tell me your name please?",
        "A: My name is Doriane Kurz.",
        "Q: Where and when were you born?",
        "A: I was born in Vienna, Austria in March of 1936.",
        "Q: Can you tell me about your parents, where they came from?",
        "A: Yeah. I...my mother's name, maiden name was Klara Biberstein and she was born in a little\ntown called Huszityn (ph) which was in Poland at the time, part of the Austria-Hungarian\nempire and my father's name was Meilech Kurz. Uh he was known as Emil in the family and\nhis early years, certainly in Poland his official early years, he was known as Meilech Weiss,\nwhich was his mother's maiden name and uh that was because in Poland in those years\nJewish marriages performed by rabbis were not recognized by the state and the Jewish\nchildren were considered illegitimate and took their mother's name on official uh documents,\nso that I have some documents showing my father as Meilech Kurz. From very early years\nwhen he was eight I have some uh report cards from the schools on him and leading right on\nup to his compulsory time as a cadet uh in the service in the Polish army, which was\nmandatory, and uh and until he really became an adult he he was known as Meilech Weiss,\nhis mother's name. So my father's name was Meilech Weiss or Meilech Kurz and my\nmother's maiden name was Klara Biberstein Kurz and both of them came from Poland and\nuh my mother then grew up in Germany, in Essen and my parents met and then married in\nVienna and we were born there, we being my brother whose name was given as Alfred Kurz\nand uh who is known as Freddie and who was born in the year 1937, sixteen months after\nme, so that there were four of us 1n the family.",
        "Q: Would you tell me what you remember about your very early childhood?",
        "A: My uh very earliest tableau memories are from the time after we left Vienna. We left Vienna\nwith the Anschluss and went, eventually ended up in Holland. My father and his brothers\nand brother-in-laws and father had a world-wide business of selling optical frames with\nbranches really all around Europe and as well at the time and we're talking about the 1920's\nand 1930's, the business was uh in what was then known as Palestine, and in Egypt and there\nwere branches all over Europe and there were plans of expansion into Asia and to America,\nand uh at the time of the Anschluss various of the brothers...there were four brothers. My\nfather had uh there were four brothers. He had three brothers and one sister, so at the time of\nthe Anschluss there were my father, his three brothers and his brother-in-law and father and\nvarious of these uh family members were living in different parts of the world manning\nbranches. My father's sister at the time was in uh Egypt, in Alexandria with her husband and\nso their children were born in Egypt and one of my father's brothers whose name was\nMichael was in in Yugoslavia. The branch was in Belgrade and he was there with his wife\nand children when the war started and after the year 1940 nothing is known of them.\nThey...none of them survived the war. And at the time of the Anschluss uh some of the\nbrothers were where their headquarters were and some were traveling, but it became\napparent very quickly that Jews should not remain in Vienna. Uh there was...anti-Semitism\nwas ripe and almost at once things like people who worked in houses, maids and so on, uh\nbecame rude, insulting and took advantage of the fact that they either worked for Jews or\nknew Jews. It was a not good climate and everyone left Vienna. All, all the family left\nVienna, or the immediate family left Vienna. My father uh went eventually to Holland where\nwe had a branch of the business in a in a town in Holland called Maastricht and we followed.\nThere were some uh stops between Vienna and the time we got to Maastricht. We went to\nAbbazia which I think 1s in Italy or in Yugoslavia...somewhere on the border. There were\nsome detours on the way out. I I tell all this because those things are really not within my\nfactual recollections. My first tableau recollections are in Maastricht and since we arrived\nthere in the year 1939 I would have been three and so my earliest tableau memories are\nreally in a nursery school there learning colors with little fuzzy balls. (laughter) Uh we lived\nin Maastricht uh for less than a year, and my father was in business there and the business\nwas eventually extended into Amsterdam and uh we then moved to Amsterdam and it is in\nAmsterdam that I begin to have more than tableau memories. They are really uh long\nspecters of time that I can account for. I remember very well that when we first moved to\nAmsterdam we lived in a hotel, a residential hotel, and my brother and I uh caught several\nchildhood diseases at that time. I remember being stuck 1n a darkened hotel room with him at\nthe same time when we both had the measles and uh my father worked and my mother\nstayed with us. I I have lots of memories of our time in that hotel, but uh they're not really\nrelevant to this discussion. And from the hotel, for some reason we we we shared an\napartment with some other people by the name Nussbaum, whom I remember very well and\nwho survived the war and who lived on the street adjacent to the only skyscraper that\nAmsterdam had for very many years. The word in Dutch for skyscraper is Wolkenkrabber\nwhich means a cloud scratcher, and we lived there and I have absolute memories of of that\ntime. Uh I'm not sure why we shared an apartment, but I know from there we shared\nsomeone else's apartment and eventually we had our own apartment on the street in in uh on\na street in Amsterdam called Amsterdam _ (ph) in the southern part of Amsterdam called\n(ph) and uh we had a flat there and my memories from that time on are are pretty\ncomplete. We must have moved to (ph) somewhere in 1940 or so, because by 1941 I\nknow we were living there so I I don't know the exact dates that we moved but I can tell you\nit goes '40 to '41.",
        "Q: What was life like for you as a child?",
        "A: Well, uh uh I suppose at that time...[ mean I I have recollections as a four year old of things\nnormal four year olds remember. I...friends of my parents, uh visits, wearing a snow-suit, uh\nplaying on the street uh in front of the house, playing moving games with my brother and\ngoing to school, and one of my early recollections really of really moving recollections are\nthat I I seem to have been able to read at a very early age. I was interested in reading and uh\nlearned how to read Dutch. Having having been born in uh Vienna I guess my first language\nwas German and my mother...when we moved to Holland my mother never...1 remember\nnever did very well in Dutch. Dutch and German are related languages and they are\ndialectally different and I remember my mother could never quite pronounce the Dutch\nproperly which use to embarrass me. Uh my father spoke lots of languages since he was in\nan international business. I...we have some correspondence from him. He wrote fluently and\nspoke fluently several languages, and uh I remember that my mother, when I was very\nlittle...[ must have been around four...uh wanted us, wanted me...I don't really remember\nwhether my brother was involved...but she wanted me to learn Hebrew and I remember she\nhired a red-bearded young rabbi who use to come to the house and sit me on his lap and\ntaught me how to read Hebrew, so that I know I was able to read Hebrew about the same\ntime that I was able to read vernacular Dutch and uh uh I...we were going to nursery school.\nI have pictures of some of those nursery school things, performances and things from uh\nfrom my early days in Amsterdam. And then the first time that I really remember things\nhaving to do with the war...in fact there was uh one of the incidents related to the nursery\nschool...uh we had to wear Jewish stars, big stars, yellow stars and uh uh I remember going\nto school wearing a star always accompanied by my mother and I remember one time in the\nuh nursery school that there was an air raid and they sent us home from the nursery school\nand they rushed us through the streets and they covered us, our clothing up so that the Jewish\nstar wouldn't get to be seen and uh I remember bombardments that were at least in the\nneighborhood in Amsterdam. I remember a plane being shot down and seeing a parachute\ncome down. I remember once being out in the street to get ice cream with my brother...we\nwere allowed out by ourselves and we got caught in an air raid and uh we ducked...you\nweren't allowed to walk on the street. If there's an air raid you had to take cover so we\nducked into a little doorway and we stayed there. There was no all clear and after a while, a\nlong while it seems to me, my mother came rushing past and we called out to her and she\nwas crying. I guess she had gone out to look for the children, the two little children. We must\nhave been six and five or five and four who were missing in the midst of the air raid so she\nmust have gone out illegally and gone out to search for us, so I remember the Jewish star and\nbeing aware of that. Uh also wearing it one time and having some children say a a rhyme at\nus which was, in Dutch it goes: \"Jood Jood op een poot, met een stukje rochedroot\" (ph),\nwhich means, \"Jew Jew on a paw, with a piece of black bread,\" but I didn't know I knew that\nstill. That just came back to me now. Anyway, I I remember being somewhere in a market\nplace or something and two little boys saying that at me. Uh I was also going to an\nelementary school, in the first grade and uh learning with other children how to read and do\narithmetic and then uh after a while I did not go to school anymore and I guess the time had\ncome when Jewish, Jews could not, Jewish children could not go to school anymore. Uh I do\nnot know from my own knowledge but from correspondence that I have from uh my mother\nuh from those times that in 1940 uh Jews were not allowed to do certain things anymore like\ngo to the movies or go to parks\u2019 and that by 1941 those rules had tightened to uh include\ntime you could not go on the buses or trains or on trolley cars which Amsterdam was run. By\n1942 you could no longer go in stores or into the homes of the non-Jews and they uh could\nnot come to your house and uh I...my father's business employed several people many of\nwhom were gentile and I know, I remember very well being taken to the beach at Sunford\nwhich is a beach community not far from Amsterdam as a little child with one of those\nyoung women who worked for my father. She took my brother and me to the beach, so that\nmuch have been a great treat because we couldn't have been allowed otherwise\u2019 and I\nremember being on the beach when there was a sound of a lot of bombing, of bombs,\nexplosions and I don't know whether I'm right or not but I I seem to recall that somebody\nsaid something about Rotterdam\u2019 and I I don't know whether...I don't know whether if we\nchecked on it whether the big bombing of Rotterdam happened in the summertime. I I\ncouldn't tell you that that is so, but it's...but somehow it seems to be connected for me in my\nhead. Uh I...there were other outings that these people took us to. Uh life changed abruptly\nbecause I remember coming home one day from somewhere, nursery school or something, to\nuh find my mother in tears and my father not there. I want to backtrack before I get to that\nbecause there were some things when my father was still there which uh I don't want to leave\nout. Uh I remember one evening we were sitting out...our living room had a bay window\noverlooking the street and I remember being in that living room and my brother was sitting\non the bay window sill and looking out the window, and he said oh, look at that fire engine\nout there and my parents rushed to the window and it wasn't a fire engine but it was a truck\nand there were a lot of men in black uniforms that were jumping out of that, off that truck. It\nwas a like a black fire engine kind of thing with men sitting on the outside and they all ran\noff and my parents grabbed us and we ran out of the house. In Amsterdam the buildings that\nhave flats are differently configured from the way we know them here. In order to get\ndownstairs there were, in the house there were stores and then there were like stoops,\nstairways that went up from the from the street and at the top of that stair there was a landing\nand there were four doors and they led to four flats. Actually, in our case, they didn't lead to\nfour flats. They led to two flats and ours so that our flat took up half of that space and the\nother two doors, when you entered them there was a stairway that went up off them up to the\nnext level and there were flats and then there was another level and up there there were\nrooms, and we, that evening when my parents looked out, they grabbed us and we ran into\none of those center doors and up the two flights of stairs where we seem to have had a\nstorage room that must have come to us with the apartment and there were lots of things\nlying all over and we went into that room and I remember my mother putting something over\nthe keyhole so that you couldn't look in and then they said, shhh...and we sat there much of\n' Decree No. 138, came into effect on September 15, 1941.\n* Prohibition of 1941.\n* Rotterdam: May 14th, 1940.\nthe night and we heard boots going up the stairs and I remember my mother crying. They\ntried to tell us to go to sleep, my brother and I, and we stayed there most of the night and\nwhen we came down in the morning I remember our door was bashed in and the house was a\nwreck and it was the uh SS that had come to the house so it must have been one of the early\nattempts to gather up people for transports but they didn't find us. I I remember the sound of\nboots coming up close to us and going past our room so, I guess that was a miraculous\nescape because this must have been, you know, early. It must have been something like '41\nor early '42 and so since uh it must have been at least a year and a half or two before actually\nwe were taken so I suppose if we had not escaped it that night I would not be here to tell the\nstory. It would have been another year and a half or two years, and so uh in that that was a\nnarrow escape that we had. I also remember uh the place where we lived which was a like a\nnice uh middle-class or upper middle-class part of Amsterdam. For some reason my parents\ntook us after that to uh the equivalent I guess of the Lower East Side in New York. Very\ndensely populated and I was very upset at that because I didn't know why and I said why and\nthey said because we are going to be living here, and I didn't...I I knew enough even though I\nwas little to know that I didn't want to live in those very crowded surroundings and didn't\nquite understand it, but we didn't move and I...1n retrospect I uh again uh I put two and two\ntogether and I think at some point my parents felt it necessary to merge or move away so that\nthey would be able to to hide better and they must have thought that my moving into these\nsurroundings they would be harder to find but it didn't happen and I I can't really answer for\nit. Uh uh I I'm going to skip back to now to a to the time when uh when I know life changed\nvery radically. Uh I I I came home one day and uh I know my mother was crying and there\nwas a a family friend with her, a man who served as uh (ph) blower in our\nsynagogue and whose profession was uh a green grocer. He and his wife were friends of my\nparents and their two boys were friends of ours. We spent some time together. And I...my\nmother was crying a lot and she said that my father was not coming back to us. He was taken\nprisoner. Uh I cannot tell you that I understood all the implications of that at the time, but I I\nI know what happened and, of course, as as an adult and uh I can fill in on some of those\nearly things. Uh my father, as I said, was involved in the optical business and somewhere by\n1942 Jews weren't allowed to have any business and they certainly weren't allowed to have\nany goods. Jews had to uh register with the Nazis and uh and they were restricted really to\nthe house and they weren't allowed to uh do business anymore and at this point uh my father\nhad to take whatever assets he had and he uh converted some of them into a diamond. Well\none of the things Jews weren't allowed to do was to have uh jewelry. It had to be given up\nand uh my father bought a rather large stone which he, I gather, had as uh as a small item\nwhich he hoped he could keep and hide. Uh my goodness...I I find that in the telling of this I\nenter...my my brain 1s skipping about from early things to later things and I find that I would\nlike you to refresh me in my memory later so that I may go back and tell you about the\nhiding place, if you'll do that for me uh so I can continue this story with the stone. My father\nconverted some of the assets to a diamond. I think uh probably many Jews tried to convert\nsome of their assets into small items that they felt they could secrete without uh greater\ndanger than had to be and so it was a rather large stone that he bought. I guess from, in\nAmsterdam, which was one of the diamond centers of the world, that was fairly common and\nuh he hid it. He hid that, and uh as Jews were not allowed to do business anymore he was\nhome more than not, and he was bored and so he had friends who had worked I guess in the\nstock market and he began to uh visit them and my father had friends both Jewish and non-\nJewish and uh he accompanied some friends who were willing to take the chance uh to the\nstock market and uh I guess at some point he must have felt he wanted to do something so\nhe, I guess he wanted to do a little investing and with that in mind I suppose the thought\ncame to him that in order to get some capital he needed to uh sell the stone, which was an\neight carat diamond, and uh there was a person that he knew, a Jew who uh whose judgment\nhe trusted. I guess he was one of these people who who was a...who knew a lot of people and\nwho was one of these well-connected sorts that we all know who always seems to know a\nlittle bit about everything and has it right, and so my father uh consulted this man about the\nvalue of the stone and this man, who assured him that the stone had a greater value than he\nhad been told it had when he had attempted to have it evaluated for sale before, advised him\nnot to sell the stone yet, that he would try to get htm more money for it. It was, of course, not\nknown to anyone that this creature was working for the Nazis and that he had...he offered to\ndeliver to the Germans this stone which he knew my father had in exchange for some further\ntime saved from being transported for himself and his family. And so uh he denounced my\nfather to the uh Nazis and uh my father and my mother were arrested and brought into for\nquestioning and my mother denied knowing anything about it and my father also said that uh\nhe didn't have the stone and uh he was then confronted with the man face-to-face and uh he\nwas told that he would not get out unless he gave the stone up but if he gave the stone up that\nhe would then be released. And this was uh...I think this was in 1942. I did make notes on\nthat...uh it was in uh in 1942 in uh in August\u2019 and uh so eventually he gave in and he was\nbrought home and they uh they were given the stone. My father took it out of its hiding place\nand gave it to them and uh they released my mother directly and they released my father in\nfact uh a day or so later, but both my parents realized that uh things would not be well for\nthem and that they had to get out, so they attempted to find some ways out but by this time of\ncourse gentiles who consorted with Jews were themselves in danger of being transported. Uh\nand uh there were people who at great, great danger to themselves uh uh went to the Belgium\nborder and attempted to find a way out for my parents. Uh there were illegal trans...ways out\nover the border at night...uh bicycles and so on and uh but my brother and I were very small\nand the people who who led these expeditions out were afraid to take children along and so\nmy mother then tried to get my father to go out on his own and he wouldn't leave us and uh a\nfew days later they...my parents stayed hidden but it was all to no avail and my father was in\nfact arrested uh the very first time he went out again and he was sent to a prison for having\nfor having hidden and lied about this stone and he was kept in a prison in uh Holland for\nthree and a half months and uh there wasn't any help for that. My mother was not badly\nconnected through the, what was called the Joodscher Raad, the Jewish Committee and uh\nbut there wasn't even...nobody really knew exactly where he was so this was uh in August of\n1942, August the 6th, and uh he was then kept in that prison called Vught in Holland for\nthree and a half months and from there he was sent to a prison camp called Amersfoort and\n* Date uncertain.\nhe was detained in Amersfoort for two weeks, not just as a Jew but as a Jew who merited\nspecial punishment and after two weeks in Amersfoort he was sent to Westerbork and\nWesterbork on the borderline between uh between Holland and Germany was a transit camp\nto which people were sent when they were first arrested and from there the transport went to\nconcentration camps in Germany and in Poland. We had some distant cousins...I will name\nnames here when possible because they are people who were murdered and perhaps their\nnames will not appear anywhere else, so I will speak them here. Uh the last name of these\npeople was Kamerling (ph) and uh the man's first name was Dunio Kamerling (ph) and uh\nher name was Trude (ph). Uh the Kamerlings having been arrested uh in the very early\nstages of the war and sent to Westerbork were in the nature of trustees in that camp and had\nuh quarters other than the barracks in which most of the inmates lived. They were...had a\nsmall...[ remember a small house or they had like two rooms rather than in in a large barrack,\nand they had special privileges. Uh at the time I I would not have understood and known but\nI know that Westerbork uh had as...it was a less secure place than con...than real...the\nGerman and Polish concentration camps, and there were deputations (ph) from Jewish\ncommittees that were allowed in and out of Westerbork and I believe even some of them,\nthose deputations were put in the position of helping to determine who would be kept in\nWesterbork and who would be transported from there. I uh I mention this only because I\nthink at...later on in in the story the fact that this was a less secure facility is, becomes\nmaterial in uh in our story. Well, my father was sent uh to, after two weeks in Amersfoort,\nthe prison uh detention camp, after two weeks there he was sent to Westerbork and there he\nmade contact of course with this relative of ours, Dunio Kamerling and uh Mr. Kamerling uh\nused his best efforts to try to lighten my father's uh position in in Westerbork because my\nfather was slated to be transported to Germany or Poland directly as a special prisoner\nmeriting special punishment. Uh we had not heard from my father in those months that he\nwas prisoner or in Amersfoort but uh immediately upon his entrance into Westerbork my\nfather sent us a letter which was taken out to us uh and he sent in fact in the next three days\nfour communications, all of which I have, to my mother uh from Westerbork through the\nunderground or through members of the committee who were allowed in and out and uh he\nuh he mentions the fact that everything that happened to him was because of the betrayal and\nhe was blamed for, from that for many other things by the Nazis, by the Germans and my\nmother tried everything she could. She knew officials and she went and she begged to have\nhim remain in Westerbork because he he wrote that he was slated for transport and uh Dunio\nKamerling tried everything he could but nothing helped and he was sent out. Uh he arrived\nin uh Westerbork on the 7th of November in 1942 and he was transported to Auschwitz on\nthe 10th of November of 1942 and we had no other word about him and so we presume that\nhe was exterminated.",
        "Q: You got a letter from your father much later that he had written on the way to Auschwitz.\nCan you tell us about that?",
        "A: Well, yeah. There were four communications so one every day and that last one which was\nwritten on the uh 10th of November in nineteen hundred forty-two is a very short little note\nand it is in German and it says in effect uh, \"Dearest Klara, my mother's name. Dearest\nKlara. I am writing this letter on the train uh while we're standing and we are going to go\nfurther. I feel alright. Uh the uh the things that you sent me uh I got. I I'm taking them with\nme. There are a lot of things you sent. There were too many. I have too many things but I'm\nsure they'll be used. Uh stay well. All my love to you and the children.\" I will tell you that I\nhave a a absolutely I remember that my mother, when she got the letter from my father, the\nfirst letter, was crying and I remember her packing a backpack full of things...soap and food\nand things and as I say, she had some connections to both the underground and to uh the\nJoodscher Raad and she got the package to him because that's what he referred to, that the\nthings that she had sent to him he had received. And so uh Westerbork not, was not shut up\ntight. I mean if you had the right combination of money, I guess, and words or the right\nconnections it was possible sometimes to do something still in the year 1942. Those things\nchanged later. Uh Dunio Kamerling and Trude were both uh deported and after the war we\nfound Trude Kamerling's name on the Theresienstadt deceased list and Dunio was sent to\nBelsen\u201d eventually where he died. And so uh even for people who had whatever privileges\nthere were in that camp, time ran out for them too. At any rate, it is uh November of 1942\nand my mother is now left in Amsterdam with uh two small children and uh quite besides\nherself and uh one of those four communications that my father sent to her from Westerbork\nsaid to her, asked her how she was managing all alone in the house and maybe she should\ntake in someone else, a nice lady to live with her, maybe would be easier and uh so my\nmother interviewed some women and eventually picked a Jewish woman. My brother and I\nhad to give up our bedroom. I remember crying about that. We shared a little bedroom in the\nflat and we didn't...anyway, we had to move out of the bedroom which was down at the end\nof the hall near the bathroom and we had to share my mother's bedroom which caused a big\nto-do because in my mother's and father's bedroom there was only room for one extra little\nbed, so one of us had to share her bed and one of us was going to be able to keep our own\nbed and I wanted both to keep my pretty little bed and to share my mother's bed. I I didn't\nwant my brother to have that right, you see, so I remember crying a lot about that, but he got\nto share the bed with her while I had to stay in my own bed, so...anyway this lady came to uh\nthis lady came to uh stay with us. (ph) my mother was called down to the Joodscher\nRaad not to uh or to the underground not too much after she took this woman in because it\nturned out that this Jewish lady had a...she was single. She had a boyfriend and he was a\nNazi and he was a spy and so after that things in the house had to become careful. Most\nparticularly I will tell you that I remember very well our bay window, as I told you, and the\nbay window of the flat next to us, which both stuck out and my mother and the lady living in\nthat flat used to talk all the time. It was a gentile Dutch lady and her husband who lived next\ndoor to us and they were very active in the underground on behalf of Jews and they were\nexterminated and uh who knows whether this woman whom we took in and her boyfriend\ndidn't rat on them, because it would have been very hard to have uh hidden that. Uh we were\nsmall, my brother and I, and the woman I guess became fond of us and uh I remember one\nday that she hid my mother under the kitchen table and hid us under something else and\n> Bergen-Belsen.\nand...answered the door to uh to the Gestapo and got rid of them for us somewhere along the\nline. But I don't know, as I say, whether she was instrumental in having our neighbors\nmurdered or her boyfriend of whatever, but I remember my mother telling us not to talk loud\nand not to say things so much so because it was none of that woman's business, and I\nunderstand now why. At any rate uh the woman and her boyfriend took a trip to Paris in the\nyear uh 1943 and uh they returned on the first evening of Rosh HaShanah at which time\nliving in our house in our flat while she was gone was a family of four people...a man, his\nwife and the two children, and that was the man whom I had found with my mother the day\nwhen my father disappeared. That friend, he and his wife and his two children who had been\npicked up by the Gestapo and whom my mother had helped to liberate, somehow spring\nfrom their initial confinement and who had no place to go...one of the things that happened\nwhen the Gestapo took you was that they also came in and stripped the house and took all\nyour effects and uh so they had no place to live and they came and stayed with us. After all\nthe woman was not there and her boyfriend and I don't think anyone knew they were coming\nback and so...but they...it was right...1 remember it was Rosh HaShanah evening and the\nwoman and her boyfriend came back and they had been in Paris and they brought us a gifts\nand I remember the gift that my brother got was a little wind-up car that wouldn't fall off the\nedge of the table when it, you know, they're common now but we'd never seen anything like\nthat, so anyway uh we went to bed that night. I don't know how my mother must have felt.\nThe woman there and those four people in the apartment who weren't supposed to been\nthere...the man, his wife and two children. They were sleeping in the main bedroom and my\nmother and I were sharing one of the little tiny office rooms that were part of our apartment\nand in the middle of the night uh the banging on the door came and I remember my mother\ngot up and said to me, shhhh. Stay in. Stay absolutely quiet. And my mother and this woman\nwent to the door and what happened was that the woman showed her identity to the Gestapo\nat the door and they asked how many people were in the house and the woman told them just\nthe two of them, my mother and she, and this time however they took my mother and they\ntook the woman. They had her come along, but they did not search the apartment at that very\nmoment. So I remember my mother coming back into the room where we were sleeping and\nshe just said, shhh...be quiet and do whatever the man who was staying there tells you to do.\nAnd then she was gone and we were...we got up right away. It was the middle of the night. It\nwas very black outside. Nobody was allowed to be on the street, but we we went out on the\nstreet and my brother Freddie and I were taken to, in the middle of the night, through the\nstreets by somebody...I can't tell you anymore who, and we ended up in a in an apartment\nwith a woman, a single woman. I didn't know that night where we were, but she was a\ngentile woman who was living on the second floor somewhere, and we lived with her for a\nfew weeks and we had to stay in bed all day because being a single woman, the people who\nwere below her knew that there was no one else living in the apartment and she went to work\nevery day, so she continued to go to work everyday, I guess because she didn't want anyone\nto suspect that she was working with the underground, and Freddie and I had to stay in bed\nall day but I mean this was uh... was seven. He was six and children of seven and six don't\ndo very well staying in bed all day, so I remember we tried to stay in bed, but we used to\ntiptoe out and uh I remember us being there for St. Nicholas day, which in Holland St.\nNicholas day is not really like Christmas here. It's a almost a national holiday. All children\nsort of take part in it and the woman was trying to make us interested in St. Nicholas and I\ndidn't want to have any part of it. I I know I wanted very much to somehow get back to my\nmother and they said no, no, you can't. And then one day not long after that we were told that\nwe couldn't stay there anymore and we were spirited away again with some people and we\nwere brought to a little town in Holland...I can't tell you where it was. Uh somewhere in the\noutlying farm district where we were with two people whom I only remember by their first\nname. They were called Uncle Hank, Ome Hank and Aunt Jo, which amused us a lot\nbecause we could never figure out at the beginning whether it was Uncle Joe and Aunt Hank\nor visa versa. I remember a farm, a small community and a house, a large backyard and\nrabbits. And I remember playing a game, drawing with a stick in the dirt and making\npathways and mazes and things. In retrospect I can imagine what an enormous chance\npeople took to hide two Jewish children in a town out of outside of a main city where\nprobably, you know, people just couldn't come up with two little children and pawn them off\nas something related to them if they'd never had them before. Uh so they must have taken an\nenormous chance in doing this. I I...we could never thank them. I could never...I never knew\nwhere I was because that chapter in our lives was cut short and uh in order to explain that I\nhave to backtrack a little bit now. My mother had a uh sister who made it to America with\nher family and my mother also had a brother. Her brother uh had to leave Germany and\nescaped to Russia as early in in the 1920's and eventually came back to Germany and then\nhad to flee from everywhere. He was, I gather he got involved in the Russian something or\nother as well and he had to flee and he fled...it was very early times. It was the end of the\n'20's and he fled to Palestine and he lived there and he married there. He married in fact a\nwoman who was a Sabra even at that time. And he settled there and his name is Eliot\nBiberstein and he thank God is in this year 1990 still alive and well and he lives with his\nwife and uh their children and uh so her brother was living in Palestine and uh we're now\nback here in the early 1940's...he knew that we were in Holland and not too much was heard\nfrom us. My mother managed through the Red Cross to send a telegram to Palestine to say\nthat we were still alive and this was...it must have been in like 1941 or beginning of '42\u00b0\nwhich he got, and so my uncle in Palestine somehow heard of a an exchange that was\nplanned between Palestinian nationals who had been caught by the war in German territory\nand German nationals who were caught by the advent of the war in British-mandated\nPalestine, and so an exchange was planned for these, among these people and my uncle\ncontrived to try to get us on that list. Having received uh that cable from my mother he knew\nthat my father was no longer with us. The telegram my mother sent said uh the children and I\nare fine. I haven't heard from Emile for a while, so he knew that, so he contrived to get the\nthree of us put on that list, but we were not, of course, nor had ever we been Palestinian\nnationals and so uh he found the name of a woman who had been a Palestinian national who\nhad gone to Germany who was deceased and I guess money changed hands and uh that\nwoman's name was added to my mother's name and my mother's picture and my brother and\nmy picture were eventually put on a certificate attesting to the fact that we were Palestinian\n\u00b0 Date uncertain.\nnationals and that we were slated for repatriation. At the time that this happened my mother\nwas already, had already been taken away from us and she had been sent also to Westerbork,\nthe transit camp to which my father had been sent for a few days. Uh and my brother and I\nwere what is called onderverdoken (ph) which means we were uh hidden, uh ducked under is\nthe literal translation. Jews who were hidden were called, that was called onderverdoken\n(ph), so we were onderverdoken (ph) and my mother was by herself in in Westerbork uh\nwhen word was gotten to her through uh the Joodscher Raad and to and I maybe even\nthrough the Red Cross that she had been put for repatriation on a list with her children and\nmy mother... mean if I think about what this must have done to the poor woman...she was\nnotified that she was going to be liberated and sent to Palestine and her children were\nsomeplace that she was not even allowed to know about in case she was questioned. Hidden\nsomewhere, somewhere and she must have been beside herself and half out of her mind at\nthe concept of ending up in Palestine, free with her children somewhere maybe picked up by\nthe Nazis and then hidden and then punished for having been onderverdoken (ph). So she\ndeemed it absolutely necessary for us to to to to join her so we could be sent out to Palestine\nwith her. So through the Joodscher Raad and the underground my mother had to try to find\nus. And she did. She did locate us, and so I remember one day uh Ome Joe and Tante Hank\nor visa versa, they said to us that my mother had sent word that she wanted us to come and\nthat we should...they didn't think we should go but they had to send us and so they were\ngoing to let us go but that we should tell my mother when we got there that we didn't want to\nstay, that we should definitely come back to them, and we were put on the back of an open\ntruck, or something with canvas or something and it was evening and the...I had a dolly with\nme. I was carrying a doll and my brother Freddie was carrying a little truck. They didn't send\nus with any clothes or anything. I guess they must have really thought that we were going to\ncome back and we traveled a long time, all night and then it was dawn and somehow or other\nwe went through a gate and there was my mother, and my mother did it, did this by uh\ngiving out that we had been sick and had been left behind because we were sick or\nsomething... anyway, we joined her. Uh my mother having been arrested on the first evening\nof Rosh HaShanah, must have been in October of 19 uh 43 and uh we joined her about eight\nweeks later. It was late winter. Uh we were not uh...Holland is pretty damp and cold and\nwhere Westerbork was on the borderline uh definitely cold and damp, and I remember going\nwith her to a a closet or someplace where there was a woman behind the counter and there\nwas a pile of clothes and my mother picking things through it and exchanging something for\nthem, so she must have given away somethings that she had taken and I remember being in\nthat little...those little quarters that Dunio and Trude Kamerling. I remember being in there,\nin their little house and I remember sleeping 1n a barrack but being in their little... that's why\nI remembered that they were under special circumstances. I mean that wasn't just here say. I\nI remember them. And it was...I remember it being very cold and I remember that this was\nthe first time that Freddie and I learned some Hebrew songs and I know today that some of\nthose were Haluts songs so that uh there must have been an active group of young Palestine,\nyoung Halutsim that uh were interested in in going to Palestine and making a homeland for\nthe Jews and I remember learning some songs. I mean they're songs that everybody knows\nthese days but I remember learning them at that time.",
        "Q: OK. At this point let's stop and pause and we're going to change tapes.\nTECHNICAL CONVERSATION\nTAPE #2",
        "Q: Would you tell me what you remember about Westerbork?",
        "A: About Westerbork?",
        "Q: Uh hum.",
        "A: Uh actually uh Westerbork I don't have a layout memory of, but I remember our barracks.\nUh double-decker beds. Uh I remember that because later on when we got to Belsen there\nwere triple-decker beds, so I remember that those were double-decker beds. Uh I just\nremember a large, a very large place and barracks and I remembered, I remember feeling\nspecial because we we had those relatives in Westerbork, so uh really my recollections are of\nof of that place of where we had the exchange of clothing, depot or whatever it was, the\nbarracks, uh the Kamerlings' little house, uh and really and and the Halutsim and really not\nnot a whole lot of the physical plant of Westerbork.",
        "Q: Uh how long were in Westerbork?",
        "A: Well uh Freddie and I got there at the end of 1943, of December and in February we were\nsent out in a transport, all three of us, uh my mother, my brother and I, to Belsen. Ostensibly\nwe were put on that transport and told that we were going to be exchanged as part of that\nexchange but of course we were never exchanged and I don't know whether the exchange\nnever happened or whether someone else crossed somebody else's palms with silver more,\nbut uh we were never exchanged and we were sent to Bergen-Belsen. I think we were kept\nwith a group of people who were slated for some special stuff because uh the compound that\nwe were in in Belsen...Bergen-Belsen was a very large place and it was divided into many\ndifferent sections. The sections were divided from each other by barbed wire and within each\nsection of course there were barracks and there were nationalities within each group, each\nsection and I think that we were in a group of people who were still possibly slated for some\nspecial event because uh I think we were not in the same part of Belsen, for example, that\nAnne Frank who was of course Dutch also, was. I think she was in a different part of the\ncompound.\u2019 And I have uh in our possession some Red Cross cards or Red Cross\ncommunications that were, came in and were allowed out and I have recollections of some\nspecial people who were very well connected getting packages and I suspect that was not the\npossibility through out Belsen so I mean from these things I suppose that we were still kept\ntogether with a group of people who were possibly slated for some still special treatment and\nmaybe that helped to save our lives.",
        "Q: . I'd like to know about your experience. Can you tell us from the time you got on\n\u2019 Anne Frank died in the \"Star Camp\" (Sternenlager) of Bergen Belsen, probably the same\ncompound.\nthe train to go to Belsen, what happened to you?",
        "A: No. No. I I will I will I will tell you my experience, my experiences in in Belsen and not\nprobably do it as carefully chronologically as you have just asked me to because I I can't do\nit. It's too mixed up, but given that we're now speaking about uh the very start of the year\n1944, I was eight uh and my brother was uh seven, or not quite that. Uh I remember our first\nday or two in Bergen-Belsen. Uh this time definitely in a barrack, very crowded. Uh lots of\nnoise and light. Uh lights out in the evening. I remember one evening the women in the\nbarracks...the barracks were all wo...our barrack was all women and children. Uh they got up\nand performed for each other. I remember my mother singing a song and being very\nmortified. She was wearing some kind of a housecoat thing and and singing a song. I I can't I\ncan't tell you why they why there was this think that the inmates did that evening in the\nbarrack, but I remember it and I remember the song which is uh dealt...1t was a German song\nand it dealt with a a woman who lost her husband and who was begging God to please spare\nher husband, so I remember that song. Uh and then uh we were moved into a different\nbarrack because the woman...the barracks had where people who were put in charge of the\nbarracks...I mean when the Nazis wanted to know something they came to the barrack head\nand so this...the woman who was the head of that barrack was a woman with whom we had\nlived for a short while, for a short while in Amsterdam. Not the one who lived by the\nskyscraper. The other one, and uh this woman's husband was in America and this woman, to\nthe best of my knowledge, 1s still altve and her husband in America was very wealthy and\nshe had special privileges. I can't tell you how that came about but I know that was so, and\nsince my mother knew her, my mother contrived to get us into her barracks and we were in\nthat barracks with her. Life in Belsen...oh, first and foremost I guess uh was barbed wire. Uh\nit was everywhere. I I have a hard time being around barbed wire now, but the barbed wire\nwas every where. Uh our barracks was Dutch people. Uh again women and children. Uh\nvery narrow beds, triple-deck. Uh two low to sit up in...you you couldn't sit upright on your\nbed and there were two people to a bed. The bed...the the uh bunks were made of wood.\nThere were just sides and wooden slats and straw pallets and they were very narrow. I think\nthey were narrower than what we think of as cots and there were two people to a bed, so that\nthere would have been six people to a stack and several hundred people to a barrack and in\nthe morning everyone had to get up very early and anybody over the age of fourteen or\ntwelve or something had to go to work, and I guess we were lucky we were eight. Uh first\nthere was a thing called appell, which was...everybody had to quickly get dressed and run\nout to the big courtyard and line up by barrack and by number in straight lines and then we\nwere counted, including the children, and on some mornings the count didn't check and the\nGestapo*, wearing those black boots and those jodhpurs and those those hats with the visors\nthat you that they always wore, and always screaming, would keep us standing there until the\ncount turned out the right way. And sometimes that was a very long time and then when the\ncounting was over, then the grown-ups were marched out of the camp and they went to work\nin a shoe factory or something. I didn't understand then what it was. I I suspect now it must\n* SS.\nhave been shoes that were taken from other Jews in various parts of the world where the\nGermans were killing people, must have been re-stitched or refinished for...so I remember\nthe grown-ups marching away and somehow uh my mother contrived to not have to take that\nkind of a job but to have a job in the infirmary. And she did that I guess so that she could be\nwith Freddie and me in the course of the day, or at least in in the neighborhood because the\ngrown-ups who were marched out to work, they left our compound. They were marched out\nof our barbed wire into the larger area of Bergen-Belsen to a place where there smoke stacks.\nUh Belsen did not have a gas chamber but it did have crematoria and I couldn't tell you in\nretrospect whether the smoke stacks were crematoria or related to the factory, but I imagine\nit was the crematoria because uh not long after the grown-ups left the camp uh there were\nwagons...open wagons like like carts, like the back of a horse and cart, open wagons, that\nwere dragged along without horses. There were people pulling them and uh they had uh\ncorpses in them and the corpses were lying in all directions and uh heaped on top of each\nother and there were many people who died every night and they didn't make it out to appell\nbut they were accounted for by being bodies and so after the grown-ups were marched out\nthe uh there was a squadron of people that pulled this wagon around and uh came into the\nbarracks and took the corpses and then they would, two of them would take the corpse...one\nat the feet and one at the hands and they would toss them up to the top of the heap and that\nuh happened every day. I still have trouble with that. And uh then for the day we children\nwere left on our own. Uh again I I remember teen-aged children, older children taking some\nof us smaller children aside to secret places and teaching us uh songs of of Zion and teaching\nus other lessons, and they were young people, very young. I mean I was a child and people\nin their twenties seemed like old people to me, and these I remember were older children, so\nthey must have been young teen-agers. Uh there are other specifics. Uh the bathroom\nfacilities were a large, a large outhouse for everybody, quite far from the other barracks. You\nhad to go there and you had to go there for quite a while. You had to walk there and they\nwere composed of uh a wooden plank, a large wooden plank and...with a with a front return\nand holes cut into the top of the wooden plank and there was an excavation below it and so\nuh when everybody relieved themselves they they would just fall through the holes into...I\nremember it was a very bad smell and uh I remember feeling very lucky that I didn't have to\nwotry about going to work because before work there were so many people who went\nrunning there and then everybody had to wait for each other, and that I could wait to do that\nuntil after everybody was gone. Most of our time during the day, Freddie's and mine, was\nspent uh talking about food because uh there was not very much to eat and we were hungry\nmuch of the time, almost all the time. I don't remember that about Westerbork. We must\nhave uh had enough to eat there, but in Belsen the rations were uh the rations were three-\nquarters of a liter of watery soup made from uh a variety of turnips, uh and cooked in water.\nIt was very watery. And three and a half centimeters of bread a day and and there was some\nkind of an Ersatz coffee because I remember there were some people who worked in the\nkitchen and they would come with those large uh...I don't know...like milk-can kind of things\nwith a handle, one on each side, and I remember them carrying this heavy thing with both of\nthem leaning sideways carrying that thing and we all had cups and things that you had to\nhave your own, and they were also hidden in your bed. Everything was hidden in your bed.\nYour clothes were hidden in your bed and your and your eating utensils and whatever you\nowned had to be in bed including some kind of a a uh night pot so I...people had dysentery\nand you couldn't run out at night and go to those facilities so you had to have something, and\nall that was in the bed and the bed was shared with two people and in our case uh I guess my\nbrother being a boy, my mother shared her bunk with him and since I was a girl I shared it\nwith another woman. We slept foot...you know, heads at opposite ends and so I remember\ntaking uh a bowl or something...once a day you you go there and stand on line and they\nwould put in a ladle of that soup, Kohlrabi soup and uh in there and there was...and you had\nyour little bit of bread and I remember my brother and I spending lots of time with our little\npiece of bread, cutting it for hours into the tiniest tiniest little, tiny squares that we could and\nthen eating them...tiny tiny piece by tiny tiny piece so we could make it last as long as we\ncould. Uh my mother worked in this uh infirmary and it was a good thing because uh\nsomewhere along the way my brother got to be very sick. He had a kidney infection which in\nthose years had to be...in order to get better you had to have a special diet, for some reason\nhigh in sugar. I I don't quite know why but I remember that and of course there was no such\na thing except by special privileged characters and uh some of those privileged characters\nwere a group of Greek people. I cannot tell you why that is, but the kapo, the head of our\ncompound was a Greek. He was a Greek Jew I guess. He was he was kapo. He worked with\nthe Nazis and he oversaw appell in the morning and he had other Greek people, friends, and\nthey were in a barrack by themselves and they had special privileges. Uh they had milk that\nwas delivered to them for their children every day and once in a while there was chocolate\nmilk because I remember my brother being in the infirmary and the rest of us children in the\ncamp used to line up when those Greek people got their special rations. We used to line up in\ncase there was something left over or sometimes they used to give out the extra stuff to the\nrest of us children, and I remember lining up and getting some chocolate milk and bringing it\nto the infirmary, which I was not allowed to go into, but I stayed outside and kept yelling and\nyelling my mother's name till she heard it and I virtuously gave her this milk. I would like to\ntell you I was just being a good girl, but actually I used to hate milk and even under those\ncircumstances I suspect that I I gave that up to my brother not so unhappily. Uh my mother,\nmy mother uh happily then was working in the infirmary so she was able to be with Freddie\na part of the day, or at least look in on him uh because he was laid up for four and a half\nmonths, and he was not allowed to eat the stuff that we were getting and the other stuff was\nnot to be had, so there was...it was touch and go whether he would make it through. I\nremember being in the barracks one day...they used to make announcements all the time in\nthe barracks. In the evening when the grown-ups came back, people used to go around and\nmake announcements...they found something, they needed something and I remember being\nmortified one evening when I was standing in the barracks...somebody came around and\nstarted saying that there was a child in the infirmary who was gravely ill and who needed\nsugar and did anybody have anything sweet to save his life - his name was Freddie Kurz or\nAlfred Kurz. I was so mortified that it was my brother...I can't even tell you. So I guess\npeople did do things for other people. I know in our compound besides the Greeks there was\na group of Albanians. Albanians. We didn't think very much of those people. They were,\nthey were not literate or something. I I don't know why, and we thought they were dirty and\nin Bergen-Belsen, besides the amount of time we spent cutting our food small, we also spent,\nwe children spent a lot of the day searching ourselves for lice. Uh this became an activity of\nuh glee. We all had lice and we used to comb our hair and try to catch the lice on the comb\nso that we could squash them with our thumbs, and since we were all covered with lice on\nour heads and fleas on our bodies...lice are horrible little grey things with a black spot in the\nmiddle and they lay little eggs in your hair. They have little white eggs and they stick on.\nYou can't get it off, and they used to come around and uh shave our heads from time to time\nand I always tried to hide myself so my head wouldn't get to be shaved. I remember running\nto the infirmary once when...I knew I had lice and if they found lice on you they would shave\nyour head...and hiding myself and crying and fleas...the fleas, they were red. I don't\nknow...they were long like little worms and you could see them on your clothes. The fleas\ngave uh people a particular sickness. They are carriers of a disease called spotty typhus.\nTyphus. T - Y - P - H- U-S. And everybody came down with it. Uh I did. I came down\nwith it. We we all came down with strange things. We...besides typhus we had uh yellow\njaundice...uh turned yellow. Your eyes turn yellow. Your skin turned yellow. Uh you're very\nnauseous. You have fever. Everybody had that lots. We...I had it twice. My brother had it\ntwice, and my mother had it a couple of times. Uh and uh I came down with\ntyphus...not...typhus was on a different level from the yellow jaundice because many of those\nmorning corpses were corpses not...some from starvation and and many many from typhus,\nso typhus was a disease that gave you very high fever and it had a crisis period and if you\nmade it through the crisis you survived and if you didn't make it, you didn't survive, and I uh\ngot typhus in uh March of 1944 and uh and on the day that I was able to walk again,\nafterward two weeks of lying with typhus...in those two week, in that two week period\nheading towards uh was heading towards the end of the war, we uh began to hear\nbombardments very close by. In general in the time that we were in Bergen-Belsen which\nwas uh for a year and three months, uh the bombardments were coming more frequently and\nit was the English who were approaching and on the day that I was able to get out of bed and\nwalk we were notified that we were going to be evacuated, and so uh we were rounded up\ntogether with whatever other people were still around...not just from our compound now but\nfrom all the other compounds in in Bergen-Belsen and we were marched to a a railway\nsiding again and on that morning I remember a SS woman in boots and a skirt who was\nscreaming at the top of my lung, her lungs and standing right by my mother and she\nsuddenly was screaming to move along and she put her hand back and slapped my mother\nhard across the cheek. And uh then we were put on board a train, a cattle car sort of train and\nit had some seats and it had a ridged floor. It had ridges in it and it was a very long train. It\nhad hundreds of cars and uh we know afterwards, from the after the war, that the uh English\nhaving come that close to us uh the idea was to bring us to to Theresienstadt, I think, and and\ngas us. But uh there was a locomotive pulling our train and every once in a while the train\nwould stop and the locomotive would disappear for a couple of days and then it would come\nby pulling another train and it would leave that other train and pull us again. And we were on\nthat train for sixteen days. There was no food and there was no water and everybody became\naware that we were going around in circles because we were coming to spots that everybody\nremembered seeing before. Whenever the train stopped there were some people who got out\nof the train and foraged in the area for grass or or potatoes or whatever they could scavage\nout of the ground in the surrounding area. We were obviously in the middle of Germany and\nthere was not much possibility of really escaping uh and for water people went back and got\nwater and brought it back to the train and everybody got sick. There there was no room to sit.\nMost people had to lie down and the lice were all over and whoever hadn't gotten typhus\nbefore, most people got it then. After sixteen days, half the people remained. We were\nliberated in what be, got to be East uh Germany by the Russians, after sixteen days, and I\nremember when we were liberated the Greek man, the kapo, was crying and carrying his\nlittle three year old son, son's body in his arms because the child had died on the train. My\nmother had gotten typhus about two or three days before we were liberated and she was\ndelirious. At some point there were no more German soldiers around us and uh and\neverybody began to leave the train and the Russians were there and they told us to go into\nthe town and so uh the people around whom the three of us had been sitting 1n the train,\nother women with children, took my my brother and me along and the Germans living in that\ntown were thrown out by all of us on the train and we took over their houses and so there\nwere several women and their children who took a house and took my brother and me along\nand I remember Freddie and I found a little, like a little flexible flyer wagon with a long\nhandle and we went back to the train and we got my mother out and we put her in the little\nflexible flyer and we dragged her to the town and put her to bed. And it was a very\ncontagious thing, uh typhus, so nobody wanted to uh come near her for some days or a week\nand she was delirious and she didn't recognize me but I had to take care of her cause there\nwasn't any one else to do it, and I remember what our first meal was. When we when we got\nto the house there was a sack of potatoes and the women took the potatoes and boiled the\npotatoes and our first meal...[ remember sitting, all these people around that table just eating\nboiled potatoes with salt and I still remember how they tasted, and and it was April and they\nmust have been new potatoes so they really must have been good, not just that they were the\nfirst real meal. We just ate and ate till we couldn't eat any more. I uh have a soft spot for\nboiled potatoes to this day. Everybody ate all that food and then my mother was still\ndelirious and I, somebody said to me, this is the crisis if she gets through it. But I was a child\nand I knew my mother was going to make it through. I was afraid but I...1t was not\ncomprehensible to me that she would not survive it, and uh oh one...it was a house and it had\na garden and there were fruit trees and there were berry bushes. I remember...there were\nberries and we picked them and ate them, and my brother was always mischievous and\nalways adventurous and he went off by himself one day to the cellar which had a coal bin\nand if there was some way to get dirty, my brother found it, so he stood on the coal bin and\nwas playing in the coal and pushing the coal aside and found in the coal bin like a potato\nsack and he came running upstairs and he got all the grown-up ladies and everybody ran\ndownstairs and there they had hidden, in the coal bin, jars and jars of preserves, preserved\nfruits and everything, so I remember eating all that and uh it must have been one of the first\ndays that my mother was back to her own self again, because I remember that she ate some\nof them and I remember saying, asking whether Freddie shouldn't get something extra cause\nhe had, was the one who found it, because they divvied everything up into little parts. And\nthen after some time there were Russian people there and they were at the beginning very\nfriendly and then I remember there was, they were less friendly and then at some point we\nwere gathered up. I had found a doll, a doll that I had found in that house, and I I had busied\nmyself on those days making little outfits for the dolly from rags that I found and a crib and a\nthing, and one morning we were all gathered up together and we were put into groups for\ntransport out and someone stole my doll. It disappeared. And we were put on a train and we\nwere transported, eventually to Leip...to Leipzig. Somewhere, either on that trip or\nafterwards when we were out of Leipzig and back to Holland, but I think on the first part\nbecause it was not long after the end of the war, our train went through Berlin and everybody\nwas cheering because all that you could see was bombed out in Berlin...just walls were\nstanding. Most of those were being held up with poles and I remember all those Dutch\npeople just cheering and and along the way, along the tracks, there would be German people\nlooking up at our Red Cross train with their mouths open and the Dutch people would go\nthere and say, Heil Hitler to them and laugh and laugh. And so we were in in Leipzig in a\nwhat must have been a military uh battalion headquarters. We were quartered in a battalion\nheadquarters where Freddie one day found some machine with gears and stuck his finger in\nand cut off the top of his fingers. I remember. He's got bumpy tops on those fingers to this\nday, and a lot of blood. And we came...we were brought to a DP camp back to Holland uh in\nJune of 1945 and my mother was still with us. She recovered from the typhus uh and we\nwere we were in back to Maastricht. The DP camp was in Maastricht and there of course we\nhad had a business and my mother knew people from the earlier days and even though the\nthe conditions in the DP camp were very bad and we were treated more like prisoners,\nlocked in and so on, nevertheless we had these connections and they came to see us and my\nmother was able immediately to notify our family in America and in Palestine of the fact that\nwe were alive and to and to ask for their help, and the communications that I, that my mother\nwrote uh in those days and in the weeks following that she wrote to my family in America\nand in Palestine, those letters with all her recollections are in my possession and many of the\ndocuments that uh uh we have from from the times we were being returned after the war are\nin my possession, and uh the uh eventually uh the Dutch people took care of their of the\nDutch citizens who were brought back to Holland. First allowed them to go back to their\nhomes, which were given back to them, but we were not Dutch citizens, having been what\nwas called stateless and uh so it took time for us to be allowed back. We were sent back to\nAmsterdam first to some other barrack type of thing because I remember lying in bed one\nday in that barrack and looking up and there was my my oldest friend, Naomi Moskowitz\n(ph) with whom I had been friends since nursery school. She stood there at the foot of my\nbed. They had she had survived the war too, and we were uh we were allowed to take, get\nour old get our old apartment back and uh just about at that time my mother, who was racked\nwith pain all the time was no longer able to uh bear her pain and uh went to the doctor and\nwas found to have uh bumps, lumps uh and she uh never really recovered. She had some\noperations. My family in the United States having been notified that we were alive was\nsending communications to us and the family whom my mother had hidden in our apartment\nthe night that they came, and those friends of hers, that whole family survived the war, the\ntwo children having been hidden that night when Freddie and I were hidden...those two\nchildren were hidden too separately and the two adults were hidden separately and all\nmanaged to survive the war...and at the end of the war uh we made contact with them again,\nmy mother did, and when my mother became very sick we were sent to the country where\nthey were living out in the country, and my mother, with much pain and some surgery and\nmuch help from America, died in uh March, the beginning of March of 1945\u201d. Before she\nwas incapacitated totally she made uh an attempt on her own to get in touch with the\nAmerican Consulate or the American Embassy in Holland again to ask that...my father had\nmade application to the American Consulate back in 1939 when we first entered Holland for\na visa and I have much correspondence from that time, form letters from the American\nConsulate saying this by no means says that you're going to be allowed in and we make no\nrepresentation, but you better supply us with such and such documents and then follow up\nthings of the same sort, and uh after the war my mother uh made contact, uh wrote to the\nAmerican Embassy and asked that we should be reinstated for visa uh but nothing came of it.\nI think the American Consul and even the American Embassy uh were not re-established in\nHolland after the war. Uh it became clear that my mother was not going to survive and one\nof my uncles uh, one of my father's brothers came over to Holland and my mother...and\nanother brother of my father, a man by the name of Benjamin Kurz who died in 1957 and\nwho was made guardian of my brother and me, then saw that he needed to get some\npermission to have the two children brought to America. Well, there were I guess millions of\npeople trying to arrange to come to America after the war and the quotas were very tight but\nuh my Uncle Benjamin didn't let anything stop him. He went down to see President Truman.\nHe wrote to President Truman and he went to see President Truman and he got to see\nPresident Truman's secretary and a special bill was introduced in the Congress to allow my\nbrother and I to come in. Uh in the mean time it had been determined that the American\nConsulate was not going to be opened in Holland soon enough and when my mother died,\nmy brother and I were brought to Sweden to establish residency there and possibly try to get\nin with my uncle's help and President Truman's through the American Consulate in Sweden\nand so we lived in Sweden over the summer and my Uncle Benjamin arranged, managed to\nget that bill there through the Congress and uh we were given a number and at the end of uh\nJuly of 1945'\u00b0* we were brought to Goteborg, Sweden from the from the boarding school\nthat we'd been placed uh while we were in Sweden because we were alone, and we were put\non board the ship alone and uh a lady was paid to make sure that we got to meals and so on,\nand so we two children sailed on the uh in the Swedish-American Line at the end\nof July of 1945. Uh fourteen days later we uh arrived in the port of New York in the United\nStates, having survived what nobody told us was a uh drill, an evacuation drill...they just\nblew those horns and told us to get to our life boats and I remember crying cause Freddie and\nI had been put into different life boats and I didn't know it wasn't the real thing and I thought\nthe ship was sinking and uh so I remember that uh and then we arrived. When we arrived a\ngroup of men came running up to us on board the ship and wanted to take our picture and I\nrealized of course in retrospect that it was the press and that they'd been given a list of people\n\u201d Date uncertain.\n'\u00b0 Date uncertain.\nwho are arriving that might be of interest to their newspapers and we were one of the first\nchildren allowed in to the United States, especially on our own, and uh so they positioned us\non the ship's railing, standing up and my Uncle Benjamin came on board to get us and saw\nall these men surrounding two children teetering on the ship's edge and started yelling at\nthem and took us off and our pictures were taken looking through a small, a little life\npreserver. I had contracted uh a skin disease called impetigo, a very bad skin disease and\nextremely catching and uh I would not have been allowed into the United States without a\nstay at Ellis Island but uh I had, I got a series of:..on board ship...I guess penicillin had just\nbecome available...this is 1946. I was given shots, four times a day and four times a night.\nEvery three hours they came and gave me injections in my rear end of penicillin in an effort\nto cure it. It didn't cure it but I remember we, I had...Freddie and I slept in different state\nrooms. I was in one with three other women, double decker beds, four to a cabin and I\nremember them...they all...they came into the cabin and woke me up at night a few times and\ngave me a shot in my rear end. I was very sore. The impetigo didn't go away and the lady\nwho had been paid to take care of us, I guess with the connivance of the ship's doctor, I don't\nknow...put gloves on me. Particular one glove cause I had the impetigo very badly on one\nhand, so you can see when you look at the picture...there's this child wearing one glove and\none not glove and we were smuggled through and I did not have to stay on Ellis Island and\nso Freddie and I came here and to grow up in the home of my Uncle Benjamin and his wife\nand his two daughters, my father's brother. And uh to this country had managed to come\nbefore the uh 1941 that Uncle Benjamin, my father's other brother Charles Kurz and his\nfamily who had fled and who had managed to arrive in the United States via a stay in the\nsouth of France in Nice and eventually they came here. Uh my father's sister who with her\nhusband had been in Alexandria and in that branch...they managed to come to the United\nStates. The brother who was in Belgrade, Yugoslavia and his family was never heard from\nagain, and my father of course died. My mother's sister and her family uh came here by way\nof Belgium and my mother's brother had gone to Palestine. Uh I guess my mother must have\ndoubts of surviving the war because uh from the earliest times on during the war she drilled\ninto Freddie and me the address of both my uncle in Palestine and the address of my uncle in\nNew York and uh we could have been awakened any time of day and night and could have\ncould have recited those addresses because so many children were left alone in the\nconcentration camps without parents, parents who died, and who...I guess my mother must\nhave wanted to make sure that we would not just become displaced children, since we had\nfamily that we would know where to tell them to send us if we survived and so I know we uh\nwe knew those addresses from a very very early age on.",
        "Q: We need to move on so we have time for the photographs, but I wanted to ask you uh if you\ncould very briefly, what was your adjustment to America like?",
        "A: Uh, we arrived here on August 5th, 1946. Uh we had had, my family had arranged for us to\nhave some private English lessons in uh Sweden and when we came here, there was one\nmonth to go before we were to enter school and uh we had some private English lessons so\nby the time school started in September uh we knew a few words of English and uh we were\nentered in a public school. We...my uncle and aunt and their two children, one of whom was\nexactly my age, three months difference, and one of whom was two years older, lived in a\ntwo room apartment in in Brooklyn, in Brighton Beach, and suddenly there were four\nchildren and two adults in two rooms, and the man downstairs uh could tolerate the noise. I\nremember him coming up with a baseball bat, and we were put to school almost immediately\nin September. Uh I have the compositions I wrote in that first half year. Uh children learn\nlanguages extremely quickly and uh I we adjusted well like that. Uh I will tell you that uh we\ncame through it pretty well. From my point of view uh I guess the best thing my parents ever\ndid for me was to give me a brother. I felt in in certainly the first part of my life, I mean for\nthe decade after we came here, I I'm not sure I would have made it through so well if I had\nnot had him because uh I I suspect that the reason that my recollections are are very good\nthrough all this period is because they are connected, they are my only connection to my\nmemories of my parents and to my memories of my own beginnings. And I must have\ndetermined at a very early age that I wasn't going to let go of those and so I guess I mean\nsometimes people have better memories and sometimes they have worse memories, so I\nguess I was gifted with a better memory, but besides that, I I felt I felt very close to my\nbrother in all the years I was growing up and I I'm sure he felt that way about me because we\nhad shared something which we never really could share with anybody else, and I think my\nadjustment was OK because of that. I would tell you that we went, we came here in August\nof 19 uh 46. In the summer of '47 we went to camp, a summer camp, for two months in\nMaine and all of a sudden that summer I became unable to eat. I was not able to swallow. Uh\n[...1t took me about two years to be able to swallow again, and uh I can't tell you why that\nwas but I'm sure it was as a result of my experiences. It was...in the forties one didn't send\nchildren to psychiatrist and all that. They seemed to be functioning OK and I was\nfunctioning alright in all other ways and of course we were lucky...we we had a family here\nand people who took us 1n as their own children and brought us up as their own children, and\nthose people not only brought us up as their own children, but they were...they knew my\nparents and so we were able to maintain our own identity and still become part of their\nfamily, and so, you know, I was lucky that way. And uh I'm sure a whole lot of our\npersonalities have been formed by those experiences. I I would say we are both exceedingly\nself-reliant people and uh I think that has something to do with it. I certainly didn't have a\nnormal childhood. We didn't have a normal childhood and I had much more responsibility\nthan...heaped on me...than most children have. My mother charged me with the care of my\nbrother, if anything happened to her. Uh the time I had to take care of her when she was sick.\nI have letters that I wrote to my mother as a young child of six, seven, eight, in which I tried\nto comfort her and assure her that my father would be found after the war. They're not...they\nweren't things with which children are normally concerned. Childhood is a time of carefree\nuh selfishness and I don't think we had those opportunities and I'm sure those that had a bad\neffect on me and I'm sure it had some good effects on me. I found I'm uh more self-reliant\nand less willing to let other people do for me and I think that had something to do with it.",

        "A: My name is Doriane Kurz.",
        "A: I was born in Vienna, Austria in March of 1936.",
        "A: Yeah. I...my mother's name, maiden name was Klara Biberstein and she was born in a little\ntown called Huszityn (ph) which was in Poland at the time, part of the Austria-Hungarian\nempire and my father's name was Meilech Kurz. Uh he was known as Emil in the family and\nhis early years, certainly in Poland his official early years, he was known as Meilech Weiss,\nwhich was his mother's maiden name and uh that was because in Poland in those years\nJewish marriages performed by rabbis were not recognized by the state and the Jewish\nchildren were considered illegitimate and took their mother's name on official uh documents,\nso that I have some documents showing my father as Meilech Kurz. From very early years\nwhen he was eight I have some uh report cards from the schools on him and leading right on\nup to his compulsory time as a cadet uh in the service in the Polish army, which was\nmandatory, and uh and until he really became an adult he he was known as Meilech Weiss,\nhis mother's name. So my father's name was Meilech Weiss or Meilech Kurz and my\nmother's maiden name was Klara Biberstein Kurz and both of them came from Poland and\nuh my mother then grew up in Germany, in Essen and my parents met and then married in\nVienna and we were born there, we being my brother whose name was given as Alfred Kurz\nand uh who is known as Freddie and who was born in the year 1937, sixteen months after\nme, so that there were four of us 1n the family.",
        "A: My uh very earliest tableau memories are from the time after we left Vienna. We left Vienna\nwith the Anschluss and went, eventually ended up in Holland. My father and his brothers\nand brother-in-laws and father had a world-wide business of selling optical frames with\nbranches really all around Europe and as well at the time and we're talking about the 1920's\nand 1930's, the business was uh in what was then known as Palestine, and in Egypt and there\nwere branches all over Europe and there were plans of expansion into Asia and to America,\nand uh at the time of the Anschluss various of the brothers...there were four brothers. My\nfather had uh there were four brothers. He had three brothers and one sister, so at the time of\nthe Anschluss there were my father, his three brothers and his brother-in-law and father and\nvarious of these uh family members were living in different parts of the world manning\nbranches. My father's sister at the time was in uh Egypt, in Alexandria with her husband and\nso their children were born in Egypt and one of my father's brothers whose name was\nMichael was in in Yugoslavia. The branch was in Belgrade and he was there with his wife\nand children when the war started and after the year 1940 nothing is known of them.\nThey...none of them survived the war. And at the time of the Anschluss uh some of the\nbrothers were where their headquarters were and some were traveling, but it became\napparent very quickly that Jews should not remain in Vienna. Uh there was...anti-Semitism\nwas ripe and almost at once things like people who worked in houses, maids and so on, uh\nbecame rude, insulting and took advantage of the fact that they either worked for Jews or\nknew Jews. It was a not good climate and everyone left Vienna. All, all the family left\nVienna, or the immediate family left Vienna. My father uh went eventually to Holland where\nwe had a branch of the business in a in a town in Holland called Maastricht and we followed.\nThere were some uh stops between Vienna and the time we got to Maastricht. We went to\nAbbazia which I think 1s in Italy or in Yugoslavia...somewhere on the border. There were\nsome detours on the way out. I I tell all this because those things are really not within my\nfactual recollections. My first tableau recollections are in Maastricht and since we arrived\nthere in the year 1939 I would have been three and so my earliest tableau memories are\nreally in a nursery school there learning colors with little fuzzy balls. (laughter) Uh we lived\nin Maastricht uh for less than a year, and my father was in business there and the business\nwas eventually extended into Amsterdam and uh we then moved to Amsterdam and it is in\nAmsterdam that I begin to have more than tableau memories. They are really uh long\nspecters of time that I can account for. I remember very well that when we first moved to\nAmsterdam we lived in a hotel, a residential hotel, and my brother and I uh caught several\nchildhood diseases at that time. I remember being stuck 1n a darkened hotel room with him at\nthe same time when we both had the measles and uh my father worked and my mother\nstayed with us. I I have lots of memories of our time in that hotel, but uh they're not really\nrelevant to this discussion. And from the hotel, for some reason we we we shared an\napartment with some other people by the name Nussbaum, whom I remember very well and\nwho survived the war and who lived on the street adjacent to the only skyscraper that\nAmsterdam had for very many years. The word in Dutch for skyscraper is Wolkenkrabber\nwhich means a cloud scratcher, and we lived there and I have absolute memories of of that\ntime. Uh I'm not sure why we shared an apartment, but I know from there we shared\nsomeone else's apartment and eventually we had our own apartment on the street in in uh on\na street in Amsterdam called Amsterdam _ (ph) in the southern part of Amsterdam called\n(ph) and uh we had a flat there and my memories from that time on are are pretty\ncomplete. We must have moved to (ph) somewhere in 1940 or so, because by 1941 I\nknow we were living there so I I don't know the exact dates that we moved but I can tell you\nit goes '40 to '41.",
        "A: Well, uh uh I suppose at that time...[ mean I I have recollections as a four year old of things\nnormal four year olds remember. I...friends of my parents, uh visits, wearing a snow-suit, uh\nplaying on the street uh in front of the house, playing moving games with my brother and\ngoing to school, and one of my early recollections really of really moving recollections are\nthat I I seem to have been able to read at a very early age. I was interested in reading and uh\nlearned how to read Dutch. Having having been born in uh Vienna I guess my first language\nwas German and my mother...when we moved to Holland my mother never...1 remember\nnever did very well in Dutch. Dutch and German are related languages and they are\ndialectally different and I remember my mother could never quite pronounce the Dutch\nproperly which use to embarrass me. Uh my father spoke lots of languages since he was in\nan international business. I...we have some correspondence from him. He wrote fluently and\nspoke fluently several languages, and uh I remember that my mother, when I was very\nlittle...[ must have been around four...uh wanted us, wanted me...I don't really remember\nwhether my brother was involved...but she wanted me to learn Hebrew and I remember she\nhired a red-bearded young rabbi who use to come to the house and sit me on his lap and\ntaught me how to read Hebrew, so that I know I was able to read Hebrew about the same\ntime that I was able to read vernacular Dutch and uh uh I...we were going to nursery school.\nI have pictures of some of those nursery school things, performances and things from uh\nfrom my early days in Amsterdam. And then the first time that I really remember things\nhaving to do with the war...in fact there was uh one of the incidents related to the nursery\nschool...uh we had to wear Jewish stars, big stars, yellow stars and uh uh I remember going\nto school wearing a star always accompanied by my mother and I remember one time in the\nuh nursery school that there was an air raid and they sent us home from the nursery school\nand they rushed us through the streets and they covered us, our clothing up so that the Jewish\nstar wouldn't get to be seen and uh I remember bombardments that were at least in the\nneighborhood in Amsterdam. I remember a plane being shot down and seeing a parachute\ncome down. I remember once being out in the street to get ice cream with my brother...we\nwere allowed out by ourselves and we got caught in an air raid and uh we ducked...you\nweren't allowed to walk on the street. If there's an air raid you had to take cover so we\nducked into a little doorway and we stayed there. There was no all clear and after a while, a\nlong while it seems to me, my mother came rushing past and we called out to her and she\nwas crying. I guess she had gone out to look for the children, the two little children. We must\nhave been six and five or five and four who were missing in the midst of the air raid so she\nmust have gone out illegally and gone out to search for us, so I remember the Jewish star and\nbeing aware of that. Uh also wearing it one time and having some children say a a rhyme at\nus which was, in Dutch it goes: \"Jood Jood op een poot, met een stukje rochedroot\" (ph),\nwhich means, \"Jew Jew on a paw, with a piece of black bread,\" but I didn't know I knew that\nstill. That just came back to me now. Anyway, I I remember being somewhere in a market\nplace or something and two little boys saying that at me. Uh I was also going to an\nelementary school, in the first grade and uh learning with other children how to read and do\narithmetic and then uh after a while I did not go to school anymore and I guess the time had\ncome when Jewish, Jews could not, Jewish children could not go to school anymore. Uh I do\nnot know from my own knowledge but from correspondence that I have from uh my mother\nuh from those times that in 1940 uh Jews were not allowed to do certain things anymore like\ngo to the movies or go to parks\u2019 and that by 1941 those rules had tightened to uh include\ntime you could not go on the buses or trains or on trolley cars which Amsterdam was run. By\n1942 you could no longer go in stores or into the homes of the non-Jews and they uh could\nnot come to your house and uh I...my father's business employed several people many of\nwhom were gentile and I know, I remember very well being taken to the beach at Sunford\nwhich is a beach community not far from Amsterdam as a little child with one of those\nyoung women who worked for my father. She took my brother and me to the beach, so that\nmuch have been a great treat because we couldn't have been allowed otherwise\u2019 and I\nremember being on the beach when there was a sound of a lot of bombing, of bombs,\nexplosions and I don't know whether I'm right or not but I I seem to recall that somebody\nsaid something about Rotterdam\u2019 and I I don't know whether...I don't know whether if we\nchecked on it whether the big bombing of Rotterdam happened in the summertime. I I\ncouldn't tell you that that is so, but it's...but somehow it seems to be connected for me in my\nhead. Uh I...there were other outings that these people took us to. Uh life changed abruptly\nbecause I remember coming home one day from somewhere, nursery school or something, to\nuh find my mother in tears and my father not there. I want to backtrack before I get to that\nbecause there were some things when my father was still there which uh I don't want to leave\nout. Uh I remember one evening we were sitting out...our living room had a bay window\noverlooking the street and I remember being in that living room and my brother was sitting\non the bay window sill and looking out the window, and he said oh, look at that fire engine\nout there and my parents rushed to the window and it wasn't a fire engine but it was a truck\nand there were a lot of men in black uniforms that were jumping out of that, off that truck. It\nwas a like a black fire engine kind of thing with men sitting on the outside and they all ran\noff and my parents grabbed us and we ran out of the house. In Amsterdam the buildings that\nhave flats are differently configured from the way we know them here. In order to get\ndownstairs there were, in the house there were stores and then there were like stoops,\nstairways that went up from the from the street and at the top of that stair there was a landing\nand there were four doors and they led to four flats. Actually, in our case, they didn't lead to\nfour flats. They led to two flats and ours so that our flat took up half of that space and the\nother two doors, when you entered them there was a stairway that went up off them up to the\nnext level and there were flats and then there was another level and up there there were\nrooms, and we, that evening when my parents looked out, they grabbed us and we ran into\none of those center doors and up the two flights of stairs where we seem to have had a\nstorage room that must have come to us with the apartment and there were lots of things\nlying all over and we went into that room and I remember my mother putting something over\nthe keyhole so that you couldn't look in and then they said, shhh...and we sat there much of\n' Decree No. 138, came into effect on September 15, 1941.\n* Prohibition of 1941.\n* Rotterdam: May 14th, 1940.\nthe night and we heard boots going up the stairs and I remember my mother crying. They\ntried to tell us to go to sleep, my brother and I, and we stayed there most of the night and\nwhen we came down in the morning I remember our door was bashed in and the house was a\nwreck and it was the uh SS that had come to the house so it must have been one of the early\nattempts to gather up people for transports but they didn't find us. I I remember the sound of\nboots coming up close to us and going past our room so, I guess that was a miraculous\nescape because this must have been, you know, early. It must have been something like '41\nor early '42 and so since uh it must have been at least a year and a half or two before actually\nwe were taken so I suppose if we had not escaped it that night I would not be here to tell the\nstory. It would have been another year and a half or two years, and so uh in that that was a\nnarrow escape that we had. I also remember uh the place where we lived which was a like a\nnice uh middle-class or upper middle-class part of Amsterdam. For some reason my parents\ntook us after that to uh the equivalent I guess of the Lower East Side in New York. Very\ndensely populated and I was very upset at that because I didn't know why and I said why and\nthey said because we are going to be living here, and I didn't...I I knew enough even though I\nwas little to know that I didn't want to live in those very crowded surroundings and didn't\nquite understand it, but we didn't move and I...1n retrospect I uh again uh I put two and two\ntogether and I think at some point my parents felt it necessary to merge or move away so that\nthey would be able to to hide better and they must have thought that my moving into these\nsurroundings they would be harder to find but it didn't happen and I I can't really answer for\nit. Uh uh I I'm going to skip back to now to a to the time when uh when I know life changed\nvery radically. Uh I I I came home one day and uh I know my mother was crying and there\nwas a a family friend with her, a man who served as uh (ph) blower in our\nsynagogue and whose profession was uh a green grocer. He and his wife were friends of my\nparents and their two boys were friends of ours. We spent some time together. And I...my\nmother was crying a lot and she said that my father was not coming back to us. He was taken\nprisoner. Uh I cannot tell you that I understood all the implications of that at the time, but I I\nI know what happened and, of course, as as an adult and uh I can fill in on some of those\nearly things. Uh my father, as I said, was involved in the optical business and somewhere by\n1942 Jews weren't allowed to have any business and they certainly weren't allowed to have\nany goods. Jews had to uh register with the Nazis and uh and they were restricted really to\nthe house and they weren't allowed to uh do business anymore and at this point uh my father\nhad to take whatever assets he had and he uh converted some of them into a diamond. Well\none of the things Jews weren't allowed to do was to have uh jewelry. It had to be given up\nand uh my father bought a rather large stone which he, I gather, had as uh as a small item\nwhich he hoped he could keep and hide. Uh my goodness...I I find that in the telling of this I\nenter...my my brain 1s skipping about from early things to later things and I find that I would\nlike you to refresh me in my memory later so that I may go back and tell you about the\nhiding place, if you'll do that for me uh so I can continue this story with the stone. My father\nconverted some of the assets to a diamond. I think uh probably many Jews tried to convert\nsome of their assets into small items that they felt they could secrete without uh greater\ndanger than had to be and so it was a rather large stone that he bought. I guess from, in\nAmsterdam, which was one of the diamond centers of the world, that was fairly common and\nuh he hid it. He hid that, and uh as Jews were not allowed to do business anymore he was\nhome more than not, and he was bored and so he had friends who had worked I guess in the\nstock market and he began to uh visit them and my father had friends both Jewish and non-\nJewish and uh he accompanied some friends who were willing to take the chance uh to the\nstock market and uh I guess at some point he must have felt he wanted to do something so\nhe, I guess he wanted to do a little investing and with that in mind I suppose the thought\ncame to him that in order to get some capital he needed to uh sell the stone, which was an\neight carat diamond, and uh there was a person that he knew, a Jew who uh whose judgment\nhe trusted. I guess he was one of these people who who was a...who knew a lot of people and\nwho was one of these well-connected sorts that we all know who always seems to know a\nlittle bit about everything and has it right, and so my father uh consulted this man about the\nvalue of the stone and this man, who assured him that the stone had a greater value than he\nhad been told it had when he had attempted to have it evaluated for sale before, advised him\nnot to sell the stone yet, that he would try to get htm more money for it. It was, of course, not\nknown to anyone that this creature was working for the Nazis and that he had...he offered to\ndeliver to the Germans this stone which he knew my father had in exchange for some further\ntime saved from being transported for himself and his family. And so uh he denounced my\nfather to the uh Nazis and uh my father and my mother were arrested and brought into for\nquestioning and my mother denied knowing anything about it and my father also said that uh\nhe didn't have the stone and uh he was then confronted with the man face-to-face and uh he\nwas told that he would not get out unless he gave the stone up but if he gave the stone up that\nhe would then be released. And this was uh...I think this was in 1942. I did make notes on\nthat...uh it was in uh in 1942 in uh in August\u2019 and uh so eventually he gave in and he was\nbrought home and they uh they were given the stone. My father took it out of its hiding place\nand gave it to them and uh they released my mother directly and they released my father in\nfact uh a day or so later, but both my parents realized that uh things would not be well for\nthem and that they had to get out, so they attempted to find some ways out but by this time of\ncourse gentiles who consorted with Jews were themselves in danger of being transported. Uh\nand uh there were people who at great, great danger to themselves uh uh went to the Belgium\nborder and attempted to find a way out for my parents. Uh there were illegal trans...ways out\nover the border at night...uh bicycles and so on and uh but my brother and I were very small\nand the people who who led these expeditions out were afraid to take children along and so\nmy mother then tried to get my father to go out on his own and he wouldn't leave us and uh a\nfew days later they...my parents stayed hidden but it was all to no avail and my father was in\nfact arrested uh the very first time he went out again and he was sent to a prison for having\nfor having hidden and lied about this stone and he was kept in a prison in uh Holland for\nthree and a half months and uh there wasn't any help for that. My mother was not badly\nconnected through the, what was called the Joodscher Raad, the Jewish Committee and uh\nbut there wasn't even...nobody really knew exactly where he was so this was uh in August of\n1942, August the 6th, and uh he was then kept in that prison called Vught in Holland for\nthree and a half months and from there he was sent to a prison camp called Amersfoort and\n* Date uncertain.\nhe was detained in Amersfoort for two weeks, not just as a Jew but as a Jew who merited\nspecial punishment and after two weeks in Amersfoort he was sent to Westerbork and\nWesterbork on the borderline between uh between Holland and Germany was a transit camp\nto which people were sent when they were first arrested and from there the transport went to\nconcentration camps in Germany and in Poland. We had some distant cousins...I will name\nnames here when possible because they are people who were murdered and perhaps their\nnames will not appear anywhere else, so I will speak them here. Uh the last name of these\npeople was Kamerling (ph) and uh the man's first name was Dunio Kamerling (ph) and uh\nher name was Trude (ph). Uh the Kamerlings having been arrested uh in the very early\nstages of the war and sent to Westerbork were in the nature of trustees in that camp and had\nuh quarters other than the barracks in which most of the inmates lived. They were...had a\nsmall...[ remember a small house or they had like two rooms rather than in in a large barrack,\nand they had special privileges. Uh at the time I I would not have understood and known but\nI know that Westerbork uh had as...it was a less secure place than con...than real...the\nGerman and Polish concentration camps, and there were deputations (ph) from Jewish\ncommittees that were allowed in and out of Westerbork and I believe even some of them,\nthose deputations were put in the position of helping to determine who would be kept in\nWesterbork and who would be transported from there. I uh I mention this only because I\nthink at...later on in in the story the fact that this was a less secure facility is, becomes\nmaterial in uh in our story. Well, my father was sent uh to, after two weeks in Amersfoort,\nthe prison uh detention camp, after two weeks there he was sent to Westerbork and there he\nmade contact of course with this relative of ours, Dunio Kamerling and uh Mr. Kamerling uh\nused his best efforts to try to lighten my father's uh position in in Westerbork because my\nfather was slated to be transported to Germany or Poland directly as a special prisoner\nmeriting special punishment. Uh we had not heard from my father in those months that he\nwas prisoner or in Amersfoort but uh immediately upon his entrance into Westerbork my\nfather sent us a letter which was taken out to us uh and he sent in fact in the next three days\nfour communications, all of which I have, to my mother uh from Westerbork through the\nunderground or through members of the committee who were allowed in and out and uh he\nuh he mentions the fact that everything that happened to him was because of the betrayal and\nhe was blamed for, from that for many other things by the Nazis, by the Germans and my\nmother tried everything she could. She knew officials and she went and she begged to have\nhim remain in Westerbork because he he wrote that he was slated for transport and uh Dunio\nKamerling tried everything he could but nothing helped and he was sent out. Uh he arrived\nin uh Westerbork on the 7th of November in 1942 and he was transported to Auschwitz on\nthe 10th of November of 1942 and we had no other word about him and so we presume that\nhe was exterminated.",
        "A: Well, yeah. There were four communications so one every day and that last one which was\nwritten on the uh 10th of November in nineteen hundred forty-two is a very short little note\nand it is in German and it says in effect uh, \"Dearest Klara, my mother's name. Dearest\nKlara. I am writing this letter on the train uh while we're standing and we are going to go\nfurther. I feel alright. Uh the uh the things that you sent me uh I got. I I'm taking them with\nme. There are a lot of things you sent. There were too many. I have too many things but I'm\nsure they'll be used. Uh stay well. All my love to you and the children.\" I will tell you that I\nhave a a absolutely I remember that my mother, when she got the letter from my father, the\nfirst letter, was crying and I remember her packing a backpack full of things...soap and food\nand things and as I say, she had some connections to both the underground and to uh the\nJoodscher Raad and she got the package to him because that's what he referred to, that the\nthings that she had sent to him he had received. And so uh Westerbork not, was not shut up\ntight. I mean if you had the right combination of money, I guess, and words or the right\nconnections it was possible sometimes to do something still in the year 1942. Those things\nchanged later. Uh Dunio Kamerling and Trude were both uh deported and after the war we\nfound Trude Kamerling's name on the Theresienstadt deceased list and Dunio was sent to\nBelsen\u201d eventually where he died. And so uh even for people who had whatever privileges\nthere were in that camp, time ran out for them too. At any rate, it is uh November of 1942\nand my mother is now left in Amsterdam with uh two small children and uh quite besides\nherself and uh one of those four communications that my father sent to her from Westerbork\nsaid to her, asked her how she was managing all alone in the house and maybe she should\ntake in someone else, a nice lady to live with her, maybe would be easier and uh so my\nmother interviewed some women and eventually picked a Jewish woman. My brother and I\nhad to give up our bedroom. I remember crying about that. We shared a little bedroom in the\nflat and we didn't...anyway, we had to move out of the bedroom which was down at the end\nof the hall near the bathroom and we had to share my mother's bedroom which caused a big\nto-do because in my mother's and father's bedroom there was only room for one extra little\nbed, so one of us had to share her bed and one of us was going to be able to keep our own\nbed and I wanted both to keep my pretty little bed and to share my mother's bed. I I didn't\nwant my brother to have that right, you see, so I remember crying a lot about that, but he got\nto share the bed with her while I had to stay in my own bed, so...anyway this lady came to uh\nthis lady came to uh stay with us. (ph) my mother was called down to the Joodscher\nRaad not to uh or to the underground not too much after she took this woman in because it\nturned out that this Jewish lady had a...she was single. She had a boyfriend and he was a\nNazi and he was a spy and so after that things in the house had to become careful. Most\nparticularly I will tell you that I remember very well our bay window, as I told you, and the\nbay window of the flat next to us, which both stuck out and my mother and the lady living in\nthat flat used to talk all the time. It was a gentile Dutch lady and her husband who lived next\ndoor to us and they were very active in the underground on behalf of Jews and they were\nexterminated and uh who knows whether this woman whom we took in and her boyfriend\ndidn't rat on them, because it would have been very hard to have uh hidden that. Uh we were\nsmall, my brother and I, and the woman I guess became fond of us and uh I remember one\nday that she hid my mother under the kitchen table and hid us under something else and\n> Bergen-Belsen.\nand...answered the door to uh to the Gestapo and got rid of them for us somewhere along the\nline. But I don't know, as I say, whether she was instrumental in having our neighbors\nmurdered or her boyfriend of whatever, but I remember my mother telling us not to talk loud\nand not to say things so much so because it was none of that woman's business, and I\nunderstand now why. At any rate uh the woman and her boyfriend took a trip to Paris in the\nyear uh 1943 and uh they returned on the first evening of Rosh HaShanah at which time\nliving in our house in our flat while she was gone was a family of four people...a man, his\nwife and the two children, and that was the man whom I had found with my mother the day\nwhen my father disappeared. That friend, he and his wife and his two children who had been\npicked up by the Gestapo and whom my mother had helped to liberate, somehow spring\nfrom their initial confinement and who had no place to go...one of the things that happened\nwhen the Gestapo took you was that they also came in and stripped the house and took all\nyour effects and uh so they had no place to live and they came and stayed with us. After all\nthe woman was not there and her boyfriend and I don't think anyone knew they were coming\nback and so...but they...it was right...1 remember it was Rosh HaShanah evening and the\nwoman and her boyfriend came back and they had been in Paris and they brought us a gifts\nand I remember the gift that my brother got was a little wind-up car that wouldn't fall off the\nedge of the table when it, you know, they're common now but we'd never seen anything like\nthat, so anyway uh we went to bed that night. I don't know how my mother must have felt.\nThe woman there and those four people in the apartment who weren't supposed to been\nthere...the man, his wife and two children. They were sleeping in the main bedroom and my\nmother and I were sharing one of the little tiny office rooms that were part of our apartment\nand in the middle of the night uh the banging on the door came and I remember my mother\ngot up and said to me, shhhh. Stay in. Stay absolutely quiet. And my mother and this woman\nwent to the door and what happened was that the woman showed her identity to the Gestapo\nat the door and they asked how many people were in the house and the woman told them just\nthe two of them, my mother and she, and this time however they took my mother and they\ntook the woman. They had her come along, but they did not search the apartment at that very\nmoment. So I remember my mother coming back into the room where we were sleeping and\nshe just said, shhh...be quiet and do whatever the man who was staying there tells you to do.\nAnd then she was gone and we were...we got up right away. It was the middle of the night. It\nwas very black outside. Nobody was allowed to be on the street, but we we went out on the\nstreet and my brother Freddie and I were taken to, in the middle of the night, through the\nstreets by somebody...I can't tell you anymore who, and we ended up in a in an apartment\nwith a woman, a single woman. I didn't know that night where we were, but she was a\ngentile woman who was living on the second floor somewhere, and we lived with her for a\nfew weeks and we had to stay in bed all day because being a single woman, the people who\nwere below her knew that there was no one else living in the apartment and she went to work\nevery day, so she continued to go to work everyday, I guess because she didn't want anyone\nto suspect that she was working with the underground, and Freddie and I had to stay in bed\nall day but I mean this was uh... was seven. He was six and children of seven and six don't\ndo very well staying in bed all day, so I remember we tried to stay in bed, but we used to\ntiptoe out and uh I remember us being there for St. Nicholas day, which in Holland St.\nNicholas day is not really like Christmas here. It's a almost a national holiday. All children\nsort of take part in it and the woman was trying to make us interested in St. Nicholas and I\ndidn't want to have any part of it. I I know I wanted very much to somehow get back to my\nmother and they said no, no, you can't. And then one day not long after that we were told that\nwe couldn't stay there anymore and we were spirited away again with some people and we\nwere brought to a little town in Holland...I can't tell you where it was. Uh somewhere in the\noutlying farm district where we were with two people whom I only remember by their first\nname. They were called Uncle Hank, Ome Hank and Aunt Jo, which amused us a lot\nbecause we could never figure out at the beginning whether it was Uncle Joe and Aunt Hank\nor visa versa. I remember a farm, a small community and a house, a large backyard and\nrabbits. And I remember playing a game, drawing with a stick in the dirt and making\npathways and mazes and things. In retrospect I can imagine what an enormous chance\npeople took to hide two Jewish children in a town out of outside of a main city where\nprobably, you know, people just couldn't come up with two little children and pawn them off\nas something related to them if they'd never had them before. Uh so they must have taken an\nenormous chance in doing this. I I...we could never thank them. I could never...I never knew\nwhere I was because that chapter in our lives was cut short and uh in order to explain that I\nhave to backtrack a little bit now. My mother had a uh sister who made it to America with\nher family and my mother also had a brother. Her brother uh had to leave Germany and\nescaped to Russia as early in in the 1920's and eventually came back to Germany and then\nhad to flee from everywhere. He was, I gather he got involved in the Russian something or\nother as well and he had to flee and he fled...it was very early times. It was the end of the\n'20's and he fled to Palestine and he lived there and he married there. He married in fact a\nwoman who was a Sabra even at that time. And he settled there and his name is Eliot\nBiberstein and he thank God is in this year 1990 still alive and well and he lives with his\nwife and uh their children and uh so her brother was living in Palestine and uh we're now\nback here in the early 1940's...he knew that we were in Holland and not too much was heard\nfrom us. My mother managed through the Red Cross to send a telegram to Palestine to say\nthat we were still alive and this was...it must have been in like 1941 or beginning of '42\u00b0\nwhich he got, and so my uncle in Palestine somehow heard of a an exchange that was\nplanned between Palestinian nationals who had been caught by the war in German territory\nand German nationals who were caught by the advent of the war in British-mandated\nPalestine, and so an exchange was planned for these, among these people and my uncle\ncontrived to try to get us on that list. Having received uh that cable from my mother he knew\nthat my father was no longer with us. The telegram my mother sent said uh the children and I\nare fine. I haven't heard from Emile for a while, so he knew that, so he contrived to get the\nthree of us put on that list, but we were not, of course, nor had ever we been Palestinian\nnationals and so uh he found the name of a woman who had been a Palestinian national who\nhad gone to Germany who was deceased and I guess money changed hands and uh that\nwoman's name was added to my mother's name and my mother's picture and my brother and\nmy picture were eventually put on a certificate attesting to the fact that we were Palestinian\n\u00b0 Date uncertain.\nnationals and that we were slated for repatriation. At the time that this happened my mother\nwas already, had already been taken away from us and she had been sent also to Westerbork,\nthe transit camp to which my father had been sent for a few days. Uh and my brother and I\nwere what is called onderverdoken (ph) which means we were uh hidden, uh ducked under is\nthe literal translation. Jews who were hidden were called, that was called onderverdoken\n(ph), so we were onderverdoken (ph) and my mother was by herself in in Westerbork uh\nwhen word was gotten to her through uh the Joodscher Raad and to and I maybe even\nthrough the Red Cross that she had been put for repatriation on a list with her children and\nmy mother... mean if I think about what this must have done to the poor woman...she was\nnotified that she was going to be liberated and sent to Palestine and her children were\nsomeplace that she was not even allowed to know about in case she was questioned. Hidden\nsomewhere, somewhere and she must have been beside herself and half out of her mind at\nthe concept of ending up in Palestine, free with her children somewhere maybe picked up by\nthe Nazis and then hidden and then punished for having been onderverdoken (ph). So she\ndeemed it absolutely necessary for us to to to to join her so we could be sent out to Palestine\nwith her. So through the Joodscher Raad and the underground my mother had to try to find\nus. And she did. She did locate us, and so I remember one day uh Ome Joe and Tante Hank\nor visa versa, they said to us that my mother had sent word that she wanted us to come and\nthat we should...they didn't think we should go but they had to send us and so they were\ngoing to let us go but that we should tell my mother when we got there that we didn't want to\nstay, that we should definitely come back to them, and we were put on the back of an open\ntruck, or something with canvas or something and it was evening and the...I had a dolly with\nme. I was carrying a doll and my brother Freddie was carrying a little truck. They didn't send\nus with any clothes or anything. I guess they must have really thought that we were going to\ncome back and we traveled a long time, all night and then it was dawn and somehow or other\nwe went through a gate and there was my mother, and my mother did it, did this by uh\ngiving out that we had been sick and had been left behind because we were sick or\nsomething... anyway, we joined her. Uh my mother having been arrested on the first evening\nof Rosh HaShanah, must have been in October of 19 uh 43 and uh we joined her about eight\nweeks later. It was late winter. Uh we were not uh...Holland is pretty damp and cold and\nwhere Westerbork was on the borderline uh definitely cold and damp, and I remember going\nwith her to a a closet or someplace where there was a woman behind the counter and there\nwas a pile of clothes and my mother picking things through it and exchanging something for\nthem, so she must have given away somethings that she had taken and I remember being in\nthat little...those little quarters that Dunio and Trude Kamerling. I remember being in there,\nin their little house and I remember sleeping 1n a barrack but being in their little... that's why\nI remembered that they were under special circumstances. I mean that wasn't just here say. I\nI remember them. And it was...I remember it being very cold and I remember that this was\nthe first time that Freddie and I learned some Hebrew songs and I know today that some of\nthose were Haluts songs so that uh there must have been an active group of young Palestine,\nyoung Halutsim that uh were interested in in going to Palestine and making a homeland for\nthe Jews and I remember learning some songs. I mean they're songs that everybody knows\nthese days but I remember learning them at that time.\nTAPE #2",
        "A: About Westerbork?",
        "A: Uh actually uh Westerbork I don't have a layout memory of, but I remember our barracks.\nUh double-decker beds. Uh I remember that because later on when we got to Belsen there\nwere triple-decker beds, so I remember that those were double-decker beds. Uh I just\nremember a large, a very large place and barracks and I remembered, I remember feeling\nspecial because we we had those relatives in Westerbork, so uh really my recollections are of\nof of that place of where we had the exchange of clothing, depot or whatever it was, the\nbarracks, uh the Kamerlings' little house, uh and really and and the Halutsim and really not\nnot a whole lot of the physical plant of Westerbork.",
        "A: Well uh Freddie and I got there at the end of 1943, of December and in February we were\nsent out in a transport, all three of us, uh my mother, my brother and I, to Belsen. Ostensibly\nwe were put on that transport and told that we were going to be exchanged as part of that\nexchange but of course we were never exchanged and I don't know whether the exchange\nnever happened or whether someone else crossed somebody else's palms with silver more,\nbut uh we were never exchanged and we were sent to Bergen-Belsen. I think we were kept\nwith a group of people who were slated for some special stuff because uh the compound that\nwe were in in Belsen...Bergen-Belsen was a very large place and it was divided into many\ndifferent sections. The sections were divided from each other by barbed wire and within each\nsection of course there were barracks and there were nationalities within each group, each\nsection and I think that we were in a group of people who were still possibly slated for some\nspecial event because uh I think we were not in the same part of Belsen, for example, that\nAnne Frank who was of course Dutch also, was. I think she was in a different part of the\ncompound.\u2019 And I have uh in our possession some Red Cross cards or Red Cross\ncommunications that were, came in and were allowed out and I have recollections of some\nspecial people who were very well connected getting packages and I suspect that was not the\npossibility through out Belsen so I mean from these things I suppose that we were still kept\ntogether with a group of people who were possibly slated for some still special treatment and\nmaybe that helped to save our lives.\n\u2019 Anne Frank died in the \"Star Camp\" (Sternenlager) of Bergen Belsen, probably the same\ncompound.\nthe train to go to Belsen, what happened to you?",
        "A: No. No. I I will I will I will tell you my experience, my experiences in in Belsen and not\nprobably do it as carefully chronologically as you have just asked me to because I I can't do\nit. It's too mixed up, but given that we're now speaking about uh the very start of the year\n1944, I was eight uh and my brother was uh seven, or not quite that. Uh I remember our first\nday or two in Bergen-Belsen. Uh this time definitely in a barrack, very crowded. Uh lots of\nnoise and light. Uh lights out in the evening. I remember one evening the women in the\nbarracks...the barracks were all wo...our barrack was all women and children. Uh they got up\nand performed for each other. I remember my mother singing a song and being very\nmortified. She was wearing some kind of a housecoat thing and and singing a song. I I can't I\ncan't tell you why they why there was this think that the inmates did that evening in the\nbarrack, but I remember it and I remember the song which is uh dealt...1t was a German song\nand it dealt with a a woman who lost her husband and who was begging God to please spare\nher husband, so I remember that song. Uh and then uh we were moved into a different\nbarrack because the woman...the barracks had where people who were put in charge of the\nbarracks...I mean when the Nazis wanted to know something they came to the barrack head\nand so this...the woman who was the head of that barrack was a woman with whom we had\nlived for a short while, for a short while in Amsterdam. Not the one who lived by the\nskyscraper. The other one, and uh this woman's husband was in America and this woman, to\nthe best of my knowledge, 1s still altve and her husband in America was very wealthy and\nshe had special privileges. I can't tell you how that came about but I know that was so, and\nsince my mother knew her, my mother contrived to get us into her barracks and we were in\nthat barracks with her. Life in Belsen...oh, first and foremost I guess uh was barbed wire. Uh\nit was everywhere. I I have a hard time being around barbed wire now, but the barbed wire\nwas every where. Uh our barracks was Dutch people. Uh again women and children. Uh\nvery narrow beds, triple-deck. Uh two low to sit up in...you you couldn't sit upright on your\nbed and there were two people to a bed. The bed...the the uh bunks were made of wood.\nThere were just sides and wooden slats and straw pallets and they were very narrow. I think\nthey were narrower than what we think of as cots and there were two people to a bed, so that\nthere would have been six people to a stack and several hundred people to a barrack and in\nthe morning everyone had to get up very early and anybody over the age of fourteen or\ntwelve or something had to go to work, and I guess we were lucky we were eight. Uh first\nthere was a thing called appell, which was...everybody had to quickly get dressed and run\nout to the big courtyard and line up by barrack and by number in straight lines and then we\nwere counted, including the children, and on some mornings the count didn't check and the\nGestapo*, wearing those black boots and those jodhpurs and those those hats with the visors\nthat you that they always wore, and always screaming, would keep us standing there until the\ncount turned out the right way. And sometimes that was a very long time and then when the\ncounting was over, then the grown-ups were marched out of the camp and they went to work\nin a shoe factory or something. I didn't understand then what it was. I I suspect now it must\n* SS.\nhave been shoes that were taken from other Jews in various parts of the world where the\nGermans were killing people, must have been re-stitched or refinished for...so I remember\nthe grown-ups marching away and somehow uh my mother contrived to not have to take that\nkind of a job but to have a job in the infirmary. And she did that I guess so that she could be\nwith Freddie and me in the course of the day, or at least in in the neighborhood because the\ngrown-ups who were marched out to work, they left our compound. They were marched out\nof our barbed wire into the larger area of Bergen-Belsen to a place where there smoke stacks.\nUh Belsen did not have a gas chamber but it did have crematoria and I couldn't tell you in\nretrospect whether the smoke stacks were crematoria or related to the factory, but I imagine\nit was the crematoria because uh not long after the grown-ups left the camp uh there were\nwagons...open wagons like like carts, like the back of a horse and cart, open wagons, that\nwere dragged along without horses. There were people pulling them and uh they had uh\ncorpses in them and the corpses were lying in all directions and uh heaped on top of each\nother and there were many people who died every night and they didn't make it out to appell\nbut they were accounted for by being bodies and so after the grown-ups were marched out\nthe uh there was a squadron of people that pulled this wagon around and uh came into the\nbarracks and took the corpses and then they would, two of them would take the corpse...one\nat the feet and one at the hands and they would toss them up to the top of the heap and that\nuh happened every day. I still have trouble with that. And uh then for the day we children\nwere left on our own. Uh again I I remember teen-aged children, older children taking some\nof us smaller children aside to secret places and teaching us uh songs of of Zion and teaching\nus other lessons, and they were young people, very young. I mean I was a child and people\nin their twenties seemed like old people to me, and these I remember were older children, so\nthey must have been young teen-agers. Uh there are other specifics. Uh the bathroom\nfacilities were a large, a large outhouse for everybody, quite far from the other barracks. You\nhad to go there and you had to go there for quite a while. You had to walk there and they\nwere composed of uh a wooden plank, a large wooden plank and...with a with a front return\nand holes cut into the top of the wooden plank and there was an excavation below it and so\nuh when everybody relieved themselves they they would just fall through the holes into...I\nremember it was a very bad smell and uh I remember feeling very lucky that I didn't have to\nwotry about going to work because before work there were so many people who went\nrunning there and then everybody had to wait for each other, and that I could wait to do that\nuntil after everybody was gone. Most of our time during the day, Freddie's and mine, was\nspent uh talking about food because uh there was not very much to eat and we were hungry\nmuch of the time, almost all the time. I don't remember that about Westerbork. We must\nhave uh had enough to eat there, but in Belsen the rations were uh the rations were three-\nquarters of a liter of watery soup made from uh a variety of turnips, uh and cooked in water.\nIt was very watery. And three and a half centimeters of bread a day and and there was some\nkind of an Ersatz coffee because I remember there were some people who worked in the\nkitchen and they would come with those large uh...I don't know...like milk-can kind of things\nwith a handle, one on each side, and I remember them carrying this heavy thing with both of\nthem leaning sideways carrying that thing and we all had cups and things that you had to\nhave your own, and they were also hidden in your bed. Everything was hidden in your bed.\nYour clothes were hidden in your bed and your and your eating utensils and whatever you\nowned had to be in bed including some kind of a a uh night pot so I...people had dysentery\nand you couldn't run out at night and go to those facilities so you had to have something, and\nall that was in the bed and the bed was shared with two people and in our case uh I guess my\nbrother being a boy, my mother shared her bunk with him and since I was a girl I shared it\nwith another woman. We slept foot...you know, heads at opposite ends and so I remember\ntaking uh a bowl or something...once a day you you go there and stand on line and they\nwould put in a ladle of that soup, Kohlrabi soup and uh in there and there was...and you had\nyour little bit of bread and I remember my brother and I spending lots of time with our little\npiece of bread, cutting it for hours into the tiniest tiniest little, tiny squares that we could and\nthen eating them...tiny tiny piece by tiny tiny piece so we could make it last as long as we\ncould. Uh my mother worked in this uh infirmary and it was a good thing because uh\nsomewhere along the way my brother got to be very sick. He had a kidney infection which in\nthose years had to be...in order to get better you had to have a special diet, for some reason\nhigh in sugar. I I don't quite know why but I remember that and of course there was no such\na thing except by special privileged characters and uh some of those privileged characters\nwere a group of Greek people. I cannot tell you why that is, but the kapo, the head of our\ncompound was a Greek. He was a Greek Jew I guess. He was he was kapo. He worked with\nthe Nazis and he oversaw appell in the morning and he had other Greek people, friends, and\nthey were in a barrack by themselves and they had special privileges. Uh they had milk that\nwas delivered to them for their children every day and once in a while there was chocolate\nmilk because I remember my brother being in the infirmary and the rest of us children in the\ncamp used to line up when those Greek people got their special rations. We used to line up in\ncase there was something left over or sometimes they used to give out the extra stuff to the\nrest of us children, and I remember lining up and getting some chocolate milk and bringing it\nto the infirmary, which I was not allowed to go into, but I stayed outside and kept yelling and\nyelling my mother's name till she heard it and I virtuously gave her this milk. I would like to\ntell you I was just being a good girl, but actually I used to hate milk and even under those\ncircumstances I suspect that I I gave that up to my brother not so unhappily. Uh my mother,\nmy mother uh happily then was working in the infirmary so she was able to be with Freddie\na part of the day, or at least look in on him uh because he was laid up for four and a half\nmonths, and he was not allowed to eat the stuff that we were getting and the other stuff was\nnot to be had, so there was...it was touch and go whether he would make it through. I\nremember being in the barracks one day...they used to make announcements all the time in\nthe barracks. In the evening when the grown-ups came back, people used to go around and\nmake announcements...they found something, they needed something and I remember being\nmortified one evening when I was standing in the barracks...somebody came around and\nstarted saying that there was a child in the infirmary who was gravely ill and who needed\nsugar and did anybody have anything sweet to save his life - his name was Freddie Kurz or\nAlfred Kurz. I was so mortified that it was my brother...I can't even tell you. So I guess\npeople did do things for other people. I know in our compound besides the Greeks there was\na group of Albanians. Albanians. We didn't think very much of those people. They were,\nthey were not literate or something. I I don't know why, and we thought they were dirty and\nin Bergen-Belsen, besides the amount of time we spent cutting our food small, we also spent,\nwe children spent a lot of the day searching ourselves for lice. Uh this became an activity of\nuh glee. We all had lice and we used to comb our hair and try to catch the lice on the comb\nso that we could squash them with our thumbs, and since we were all covered with lice on\nour heads and fleas on our bodies...lice are horrible little grey things with a black spot in the\nmiddle and they lay little eggs in your hair. They have little white eggs and they stick on.\nYou can't get it off, and they used to come around and uh shave our heads from time to time\nand I always tried to hide myself so my head wouldn't get to be shaved. I remember running\nto the infirmary once when...I knew I had lice and if they found lice on you they would shave\nyour head...and hiding myself and crying and fleas...the fleas, they were red. I don't\nknow...they were long like little worms and you could see them on your clothes. The fleas\ngave uh people a particular sickness. They are carriers of a disease called spotty typhus.\nTyphus. T - Y - P - H- U-S. And everybody came down with it. Uh I did. I came down\nwith it. We we all came down with strange things. We...besides typhus we had uh yellow\njaundice...uh turned yellow. Your eyes turn yellow. Your skin turned yellow. Uh you're very\nnauseous. You have fever. Everybody had that lots. We...I had it twice. My brother had it\ntwice, and my mother had it a couple of times. Uh and uh I came down with\ntyphus...not...typhus was on a different level from the yellow jaundice because many of those\nmorning corpses were corpses not...some from starvation and and many many from typhus,\nso typhus was a disease that gave you very high fever and it had a crisis period and if you\nmade it through the crisis you survived and if you didn't make it, you didn't survive, and I uh\ngot typhus in uh March of 1944 and uh and on the day that I was able to walk again,\nafterward two weeks of lying with typhus...in those two week, in that two week period\nheading towards uh was heading towards the end of the war, we uh began to hear\nbombardments very close by. In general in the time that we were in Bergen-Belsen which\nwas uh for a year and three months, uh the bombardments were coming more frequently and\nit was the English who were approaching and on the day that I was able to get out of bed and\nwalk we were notified that we were going to be evacuated, and so uh we were rounded up\ntogether with whatever other people were still around...not just from our compound now but\nfrom all the other compounds in in Bergen-Belsen and we were marched to a a railway\nsiding again and on that morning I remember a SS woman in boots and a skirt who was\nscreaming at the top of my lung, her lungs and standing right by my mother and she\nsuddenly was screaming to move along and she put her hand back and slapped my mother\nhard across the cheek. And uh then we were put on board a train, a cattle car sort of train and\nit had some seats and it had a ridged floor. It had ridges in it and it was a very long train. It\nhad hundreds of cars and uh we know afterwards, from the after the war, that the uh English\nhaving come that close to us uh the idea was to bring us to to Theresienstadt, I think, and and\ngas us. But uh there was a locomotive pulling our train and every once in a while the train\nwould stop and the locomotive would disappear for a couple of days and then it would come\nby pulling another train and it would leave that other train and pull us again. And we were on\nthat train for sixteen days. There was no food and there was no water and everybody became\naware that we were going around in circles because we were coming to spots that everybody\nremembered seeing before. Whenever the train stopped there were some people who got out\nof the train and foraged in the area for grass or or potatoes or whatever they could scavage\nout of the ground in the surrounding area. We were obviously in the middle of Germany and\nthere was not much possibility of really escaping uh and for water people went back and got\nwater and brought it back to the train and everybody got sick. There there was no room to sit.\nMost people had to lie down and the lice were all over and whoever hadn't gotten typhus\nbefore, most people got it then. After sixteen days, half the people remained. We were\nliberated in what be, got to be East uh Germany by the Russians, after sixteen days, and I\nremember when we were liberated the Greek man, the kapo, was crying and carrying his\nlittle three year old son, son's body in his arms because the child had died on the train. My\nmother had gotten typhus about two or three days before we were liberated and she was\ndelirious. At some point there were no more German soldiers around us and uh and\neverybody began to leave the train and the Russians were there and they told us to go into\nthe town and so uh the people around whom the three of us had been sitting 1n the train,\nother women with children, took my my brother and me along and the Germans living in that\ntown were thrown out by all of us on the train and we took over their houses and so there\nwere several women and their children who took a house and took my brother and me along\nand I remember Freddie and I found a little, like a little flexible flyer wagon with a long\nhandle and we went back to the train and we got my mother out and we put her in the little\nflexible flyer and we dragged her to the town and put her to bed. And it was a very\ncontagious thing, uh typhus, so nobody wanted to uh come near her for some days or a week\nand she was delirious and she didn't recognize me but I had to take care of her cause there\nwasn't any one else to do it, and I remember what our first meal was. When we when we got\nto the house there was a sack of potatoes and the women took the potatoes and boiled the\npotatoes and our first meal...[ remember sitting, all these people around that table just eating\nboiled potatoes with salt and I still remember how they tasted, and and it was April and they\nmust have been new potatoes so they really must have been good, not just that they were the\nfirst real meal. We just ate and ate till we couldn't eat any more. I uh have a soft spot for\nboiled potatoes to this day. Everybody ate all that food and then my mother was still\ndelirious and I, somebody said to me, this is the crisis if she gets through it. But I was a child\nand I knew my mother was going to make it through. I was afraid but I...1t was not\ncomprehensible to me that she would not survive it, and uh oh one...it was a house and it had\na garden and there were fruit trees and there were berry bushes. I remember...there were\nberries and we picked them and ate them, and my brother was always mischievous and\nalways adventurous and he went off by himself one day to the cellar which had a coal bin\nand if there was some way to get dirty, my brother found it, so he stood on the coal bin and\nwas playing in the coal and pushing the coal aside and found in the coal bin like a potato\nsack and he came running upstairs and he got all the grown-up ladies and everybody ran\ndownstairs and there they had hidden, in the coal bin, jars and jars of preserves, preserved\nfruits and everything, so I remember eating all that and uh it must have been one of the first\ndays that my mother was back to her own self again, because I remember that she ate some\nof them and I remember saying, asking whether Freddie shouldn't get something extra cause\nhe had, was the one who found it, because they divvied everything up into little parts. And\nthen after some time there were Russian people there and they were at the beginning very\nfriendly and then I remember there was, they were less friendly and then at some point we\nwere gathered up. I had found a doll, a doll that I had found in that house, and I I had busied\nmyself on those days making little outfits for the dolly from rags that I found and a crib and a\nthing, and one morning we were all gathered up together and we were put into groups for\ntransport out and someone stole my doll. It disappeared. And we were put on a train and we\nwere transported, eventually to Leip...to Leipzig. Somewhere, either on that trip or\nafterwards when we were out of Leipzig and back to Holland, but I think on the first part\nbecause it was not long after the end of the war, our train went through Berlin and everybody\nwas cheering because all that you could see was bombed out in Berlin...just walls were\nstanding. Most of those were being held up with poles and I remember all those Dutch\npeople just cheering and and along the way, along the tracks, there would be German people\nlooking up at our Red Cross train with their mouths open and the Dutch people would go\nthere and say, Heil Hitler to them and laugh and laugh. And so we were in in Leipzig in a\nwhat must have been a military uh battalion headquarters. We were quartered in a battalion\nheadquarters where Freddie one day found some machine with gears and stuck his finger in\nand cut off the top of his fingers. I remember. He's got bumpy tops on those fingers to this\nday, and a lot of blood. And we came...we were brought to a DP camp back to Holland uh in\nJune of 1945 and my mother was still with us. She recovered from the typhus uh and we\nwere we were in back to Maastricht. The DP camp was in Maastricht and there of course we\nhad had a business and my mother knew people from the earlier days and even though the\nthe conditions in the DP camp were very bad and we were treated more like prisoners,\nlocked in and so on, nevertheless we had these connections and they came to see us and my\nmother was able immediately to notify our family in America and in Palestine of the fact that\nwe were alive and to and to ask for their help, and the communications that I, that my mother\nwrote uh in those days and in the weeks following that she wrote to my family in America\nand in Palestine, those letters with all her recollections are in my possession and many of the\ndocuments that uh uh we have from from the times we were being returned after the war are\nin my possession, and uh the uh eventually uh the Dutch people took care of their of the\nDutch citizens who were brought back to Holland. First allowed them to go back to their\nhomes, which were given back to them, but we were not Dutch citizens, having been what\nwas called stateless and uh so it took time for us to be allowed back. We were sent back to\nAmsterdam first to some other barrack type of thing because I remember lying in bed one\nday in that barrack and looking up and there was my my oldest friend, Naomi Moskowitz\n(ph) with whom I had been friends since nursery school. She stood there at the foot of my\nbed. They had she had survived the war too, and we were uh we were allowed to take, get\nour old get our old apartment back and uh just about at that time my mother, who was racked\nwith pain all the time was no longer able to uh bear her pain and uh went to the doctor and\nwas found to have uh bumps, lumps uh and she uh never really recovered. She had some\noperations. My family in the United States having been notified that we were alive was\nsending communications to us and the family whom my mother had hidden in our apartment\nthe night that they came, and those friends of hers, that whole family survived the war, the\ntwo children having been hidden that night when Freddie and I were hidden...those two\nchildren were hidden too separately and the two adults were hidden separately and all\nmanaged to survive the war...and at the end of the war uh we made contact with them again,\nmy mother did, and when my mother became very sick we were sent to the country where\nthey were living out in the country, and my mother, with much pain and some surgery and\nmuch help from America, died in uh March, the beginning of March of 1945\u201d. Before she\nwas incapacitated totally she made uh an attempt on her own to get in touch with the\nAmerican Consulate or the American Embassy in Holland again to ask that...my father had\nmade application to the American Consulate back in 1939 when we first entered Holland for\na visa and I have much correspondence from that time, form letters from the American\nConsulate saying this by no means says that you're going to be allowed in and we make no\nrepresentation, but you better supply us with such and such documents and then follow up\nthings of the same sort, and uh after the war my mother uh made contact, uh wrote to the\nAmerican Embassy and asked that we should be reinstated for visa uh but nothing came of it.\nI think the American Consul and even the American Embassy uh were not re-established in\nHolland after the war. Uh it became clear that my mother was not going to survive and one\nof my uncles uh, one of my father's brothers came over to Holland and my mother...and\nanother brother of my father, a man by the name of Benjamin Kurz who died in 1957 and\nwho was made guardian of my brother and me, then saw that he needed to get some\npermission to have the two children brought to America. Well, there were I guess millions of\npeople trying to arrange to come to America after the war and the quotas were very tight but\nuh my Uncle Benjamin didn't let anything stop him. He went down to see President Truman.\nHe wrote to President Truman and he went to see President Truman and he got to see\nPresident Truman's secretary and a special bill was introduced in the Congress to allow my\nbrother and I to come in. Uh in the mean time it had been determined that the American\nConsulate was not going to be opened in Holland soon enough and when my mother died,\nmy brother and I were brought to Sweden to establish residency there and possibly try to get\nin with my uncle's help and President Truman's through the American Consulate in Sweden\nand so we lived in Sweden over the summer and my Uncle Benjamin arranged, managed to\nget that bill there through the Congress and uh we were given a number and at the end of uh\nJuly of 1945'\u00b0* we were brought to Goteborg, Sweden from the from the boarding school\nthat we'd been placed uh while we were in Sweden because we were alone, and we were put\non board the ship alone and uh a lady was paid to make sure that we got to meals and so on,\nand so we two children sailed on the uh in the Swedish-American Line at the end\nof July of 1945. Uh fourteen days later we uh arrived in the port of New York in the United\nStates, having survived what nobody told us was a uh drill, an evacuation drill...they just\nblew those horns and told us to get to our life boats and I remember crying cause Freddie and\nI had been put into different life boats and I didn't know it wasn't the real thing and I thought\nthe ship was sinking and uh so I remember that uh and then we arrived. When we arrived a\ngroup of men came running up to us on board the ship and wanted to take our picture and I\nrealized of course in retrospect that it was the press and that they'd been given a list of people\n\u201d Date uncertain.\n'\u00b0 Date uncertain.\nwho are arriving that might be of interest to their newspapers and we were one of the first\nchildren allowed in to the United States, especially on our own, and uh so they positioned us\non the ship's railing, standing up and my Uncle Benjamin came on board to get us and saw\nall these men surrounding two children teetering on the ship's edge and started yelling at\nthem and took us off and our pictures were taken looking through a small, a little life\npreserver. I had contracted uh a skin disease called impetigo, a very bad skin disease and\nextremely catching and uh I would not have been allowed into the United States without a\nstay at Ellis Island but uh I had, I got a series of:..on board ship...I guess penicillin had just\nbecome available...this is 1946. I was given shots, four times a day and four times a night.\nEvery three hours they came and gave me injections in my rear end of penicillin in an effort\nto cure it. It didn't cure it but I remember we, I had...Freddie and I slept in different state\nrooms. I was in one with three other women, double decker beds, four to a cabin and I\nremember them...they all...they came into the cabin and woke me up at night a few times and\ngave me a shot in my rear end. I was very sore. The impetigo didn't go away and the lady\nwho had been paid to take care of us, I guess with the connivance of the ship's doctor, I don't\nknow...put gloves on me. Particular one glove cause I had the impetigo very badly on one\nhand, so you can see when you look at the picture...there's this child wearing one glove and\none not glove and we were smuggled through and I did not have to stay on Ellis Island and\nso Freddie and I came here and to grow up in the home of my Uncle Benjamin and his wife\nand his two daughters, my father's brother. And uh to this country had managed to come\nbefore the uh 1941 that Uncle Benjamin, my father's other brother Charles Kurz and his\nfamily who had fled and who had managed to arrive in the United States via a stay in the\nsouth of France in Nice and eventually they came here. Uh my father's sister who with her\nhusband had been in Alexandria and in that branch...they managed to come to the United\nStates. The brother who was in Belgrade, Yugoslavia and his family was never heard from\nagain, and my father of course died. My mother's sister and her family uh came here by way\nof Belgium and my mother's brother had gone to Palestine. Uh I guess my mother must have\ndoubts of surviving the war because uh from the earliest times on during the war she drilled\ninto Freddie and me the address of both my uncle in Palestine and the address of my uncle in\nNew York and uh we could have been awakened any time of day and night and could have\ncould have recited those addresses because so many children were left alone in the\nconcentration camps without parents, parents who died, and who...I guess my mother must\nhave wanted to make sure that we would not just become displaced children, since we had\nfamily that we would know where to tell them to send us if we survived and so I know we uh\nwe knew those addresses from a very very early age on.",
        "A: Uh, we arrived here on August 5th, 1946. Uh we had had, my family had arranged for us to\nhave some private English lessons in uh Sweden and when we came here, there was one\nmonth to go before we were to enter school and uh we had some private English lessons so\nby the time school started in September uh we knew a few words of English and uh we were\nentered in a public school. We...my uncle and aunt and their two children, one of whom was\nexactly my age, three months difference, and one of whom was two years older, lived in a\ntwo room apartment in in Brooklyn, in Brighton Beach, and suddenly there were four\nchildren and two adults in two rooms, and the man downstairs uh could tolerate the noise. I\nremember him coming up with a baseball bat, and we were put to school almost immediately\nin September. Uh I have the compositions I wrote in that first half year. Uh children learn\nlanguages extremely quickly and uh I we adjusted well like that. Uh I will tell you that uh we\ncame through it pretty well. From my point of view uh I guess the best thing my parents ever\ndid for me was to give me a brother. I felt in in certainly the first part of my life, I mean for\nthe decade after we came here, I I'm not sure I would have made it through so well if I had\nnot had him because uh I I suspect that the reason that my recollections are are very good\nthrough all this period is because they are connected, they are my only connection to my\nmemories of my parents and to my memories of my own beginnings. And I must have\ndetermined at a very early age that I wasn't going to let go of those and so I guess I mean\nsometimes people have better memories and sometimes they have worse memories, so I\nguess I was gifted with a better memory, but besides that, I I felt I felt very close to my\nbrother in all the years I was growing up and I I'm sure he felt that way about me because we\nhad shared something which we never really could share with anybody else, and I think my\nadjustment was OK because of that. I would tell you that we went, we came here in August\nof 19 uh 46. In the summer of '47 we went to camp, a summer camp, for two months in\nMaine and all of a sudden that summer I became unable to eat. I was not able to swallow. Uh\n[...1t took me about two years to be able to swallow again, and uh I can't tell you why that\nwas but I'm sure it was as a result of my experiences. It was...in the forties one didn't send\nchildren to psychiatrist and all that. They seemed to be functioning OK and I was\nfunctioning alright in all other ways and of course we were lucky...we we had a family here\nand people who took us 1n as their own children and brought us up as their own children, and\nthose people not only brought us up as their own children, but they were...they knew my\nparents and so we were able to maintain our own identity and still become part of their\nfamily, and so, you know, I was lucky that way. And uh I'm sure a whole lot of our\npersonalities have been formed by those experiences. I I would say we are both exceedingly\nself-reliant people and uh I think that has something to do with it. I certainly didn't have a\nnormal childhood. We didn't have a normal childhood and I had much more responsibility\nthan...heaped on me...than most children have. My mother charged me with the care of my\nbrother, if anything happened to her. Uh the time I had to take care of her when she was sick.\nI have letters that I wrote to my mother as a young child of six, seven, eight, in which I tried\nto comfort her and assure her that my father would be found after the war. They're not...they\nweren't things with which children are normally concerned. Childhood is a time of carefree\nuh selfishness and I don't think we had those opportunities and I'm sure those that had a bad\neffect on me and I'm sure it had some good effects on me. I found I'm uh more self-reliant\nand less willing to let other people do for me and I think that had something to do with it.",
