And we\nlived in the \u2014 the same building. Some years ago, I took my family to Vienna, and I\nknew the address, so I went to look at the building. And there was a plaque there\nthat said this 1s not the original building. The original was destroyed in the war \u2014 in\nthe World War II and I thought, good for them.",

My father\nhad six brothers and three sisters, large family. And the family was in \u2014 they had a\nbusiness that had to do with sewing machines, and they did something with cloth\nfor sacks and things. But the whole family worked there, the sisters worked in the\noffice, the three sisters.",

        "A: So, I had \u2014I\u2014I still have one cousin who lived in the same apartment with us,\nshe lives in New York; I don\u2019t see her very often. Her brother, who I was a little\ncloser to, he died a few years ago. He was a journalist, and he actually worked for\n\u201cThe Washington Post,\u201d for awhile.",

        "A: Mm-hm. Well, I was six when I left, so it\u2019s not very, very clear. In fact, when we\nwent back with the family, I walked around trying to think if anything looked\nfamiliar. At the time we were there, they were building a subway, so the whole city\nwas sort of torn up, and so \u2014",
        "Q: What year was this?",
        "A: That we went back?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",

        "A: I have vague memories, mainly of my family and my cousin, th-the one who\ndied, who lived in the building with me, beating me up. That I remember very\nclearly.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And I remember we had a fairly large extended family and we used to get\ntogether at \u2014 I think it was my grandmother\u2019s house. But I don\u2019t have very clear\nmemories of as \u2014 you know, a six year old is not really too sharp. I do remember\nwhen we left Vienna. I remember it was kind of uncomfortable. My mother \u2014 we\nwere not allowed to bring any jewelry with us or anything. And I re \u2014 I remember I\nhad a necklace, a very thin little necklace, and I remember my mother sewed the\nnecklace into the elastic of my underpants. And my father had left a little before us,\nbecause it was really very bad for men. And so my mother and I left, and I\nremember going on the \u2014 the boat from Calais to \u2014",
        "Q: Do you remember the trip from Vienna to Calais?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No?",
        "A: Well, I thi \u2014 I remember being on the train, but not very clearly, you know? And\nthen I remember on the boat over to Calais. And then we were in England and we\nlived in London. We were there during a lot of the blitz.",
        "Q: Oh my.",
        "A: I remember wonderful times we had going to sleep in the subway, the\nunderground, as they call it.",
        "Q: Yeah. What part of London, do you know\u201d?",
        "A: We were in \u2014 jeez, I don\u2019t remember exactly where it was. Kilburn, I think\n[indecipherable] section.",
        "Q: I think that\u2019s in west la \u2014 western part of the city?",
        "A: I\u2019m not sure.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: I\u2014 I\u2019ve been back several times to London, but I don\u2019t re \u2014",
        "Q: Not east London. Not \u2014 not south London.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so.",
        "Q: Yeah, I think Kilburn is west, if I remember it.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. We were there for awhile. The \u2014 there was a \u2014 a Jewish agency that\n\u2014 that helped at the beginning.",
        "Q: So you weren\u2019t on a Kindertransport?",
        "A: No, no, no, no.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: I was with my mother the whole time. My father went to the Isle of Man.",
        "Q: Oh my.",
        "A: He was interned for 11 months, because the British were very nervous about\npeople who spoke German. And of course, we spoke German then. So he was\ninterned there. Also, my mother had a sister who had married a German, who tried\nto follow \u2014 who did follow her to England. And then he was sent on a transport to\nCanada and it was torpedoed, and he went down. And that was \u2014 she never\nremarried or anything. My father was there for 11 months. He had a great time. He\nbecame a cook, which he never did before or since. And in \u2014 it wasn\u2019t \u2014",
        "Q: He wasn\u2019t mistreated?",
        "A: No, oh no, no. He \u2014 he seemed to, you know, get along with all the people there,\nand when he was released, he came and joined us. By this time \u2014",
        "Q: Do you remember not having him around?",
        "A: Yes. My mother was only able to work as a domestic. That was the only job that\nwas available for the immigrants. And I remember we went to \u2014 she worked in what\nwas called a \u2014 a boys\u2019 college, it was like private school, with kids living there. And\nI got the measles. And so they shipped me off to the hospital very fast, before I\nspread it through the entire \u2014",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: \u2014 school population. And that was my \u2014 just my mother and I were there at that\ntime. And then my \u2014 the school that I went to in England, and I don\u2019t really have a\nclear picture of that school in London, decided to evacuate everybody out to the\ncountry. So they sent us out to Gloucestershire, and we lived in a little town \u2014 a\nlittle village outside of Cheltenham, and we were boarded with a family there. And\nI \u2014I have very clear pictures of that. I went to school there, they had a \u2014 a regular\nschool in a neighborhood. And I \u2014 I do remember one day the principal I guess it\nwas, called me into the office and said, you \u2014 you understand German? I said, well,\nI don\u2019t speak it much any more, because by then you \u2014 you didn\u2019t speak German.",
        "Q: That was going to be \u2014 that was going to be one of my questions, 1s how was that\ntransition for \u2014 for a young child? They \u2014 they soak up languages like sponges.",
        "A: Right, right.",
        "Q: So, I could imagine \u2014",
        "A: I was teaching my parents. My parents had been taking English lessons, you\nknow, with \u2014 with records and stuff. And they \u2014 they died with an accent, okay? I\npicked it up immediately. And the principal said to me, you speak German? I \u2014\nwell, I understand German, cause I didn\u2019t want to speak it any more. And\napparently, there was a prisoner of war camp nearby, and they wanted to bring these\nprisoners over to talk to me, the Germans. And I \u2014",
        "Q: And you were how old?",
        "A: \u2014 refused to talk to \u2014",
        "Q: You must have been a little girl.",
        "A: I must have been about eight or nine at the time. And I said no, I won\u2019t talk to\nthem. And I wouldn\u2019t. I would not talk \u2014 I wouldn't meet with them, I wouldn\u2019t talk\nto them.",
        "Q: So tell me though, as an eight or nine year old child, to have such \u2014 such a very\nstrong, marked position, how had things been explained to you by your parents, of\nwhat was going on, and why you\u2019d left Vienna, and \u2014 and this war, and so on. Ti \u2014\ncan you recall that?",
        "A: Not really. I don\u2019t remember ever actually discussing it with them. It was just\nsort of a fact of life that you left Vienna. You didn\u2019t \u2014 you \u2014 you couldn\u2019t stay there\nany more, because there were these guys marching around with the brown uniforms,\nand the boots, and \u2014 and these were not good guys, and the sooner we got out of\nthere, the better. So, off we went to England, and I became an English child fast. I\n\u2014I was \u2014 as I said, I was teaching my parents English because I \u2014 I picked it up, you\nknow, very quickly.",
        "Q: So, in other words, was it an English child saying to the principal that no, I don\u2019t\nwant to talk to the German prisoners of war, because they\u2019re the enemy of England\nand we\u2019ve just survived the blitz, or was it a \u2014",
        "A: No, I just said I don\u2019t want to talk to them.",
        "Q: And that\u2019s it.",
        "A: And that was the end of it, yeah. And I didn\u2019t. I never met them, and I \u2014 I\nwouldn\u2019t speak with them, so I\u2014 I don\u2019t know why they wanted to talk to me in the\nfirst place.",
        "Q: I also find it very surprising that a principal would ask an eight year old child to\nmeet with prisoners of war.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: I find it \u2014",
        "A: It was \u2014 I don\u2019t know, maybe \u2014 I don\u2019t know, maybe they were being\nrehabilitated or something, I don\u2019t know, I really don\u2019t know, but it was kind of a\nstrange episode.",
        "Q: But other than that, did you wa \u2014 did you feel comfortable in \u2014 in England, in\nBritain?",
        "A: Yes, except we always felt a little bit like the outsiders. We were the refugees.\nAt that time, Britain was not very cosmopolitan, especially out in the country, you\nknow, London was a little different, but out in the country, you know. They didn\u2019t\nknow what Jews were. We sort of had to explain, you know. There was a woman\nwho came from London, once or twice \u2014 I think once a week or twice a week, I\ndon\u2019t remember exactly, to teach me Hebrew, which I still can\u2019t read. And once in\nawhile, after things were not quite as bad, we \u2014 we had some relatives in London,\nso we would go to visit them in \u2014 in London occasionally. Meanwhile, my aunt, the\naunt, my mother\u2019s sister, the one who married the German, she had also been\ninterned in the Isle of Man. And she was released, and she stayed in London for \u2014\nuntil after the war, and eventually came to the U.S. But we would go and visit her\ntoo, but this was, you know, not while the blitz was going on. That \u2014 that was pretty\nbad.",
        "Q: Do you remember war \u2014 wartime sorts of episodes or experiences while in\nBritain, or was it blitz, and Cheltenham and \u2014 and this, you know, inter \u2014 non-\ninteraction with \u2014 with the \u2014 the POWs, you know, that you were asked to do.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Were there more such things that \u2014 that \u2014 that are in your mind?",
        "A: Well, I remember listening to Churchill on the radio. I mean, everybody listened\nto Churchill on the radio, and he made things, you know, he was very positive, and\n\u2014 and upbeat and everything. I remember the sound of the \u2014 the bombs, you know,\nthe \u2014 those things that \u2014 that made this noise.",
        "Q: The V2 rockets?",
        "A: Yeah, and then they stopped, and then you knew they were gonna fall. And then\nwhen we went to the underground and \u2014 at night, we would come out in the\nmorning and there would be rubble all over, because you know, the bomb had\ndropped not far away. But the \u2014 the underground was very safe, and everybody\nwent to the underground. I loved it, because I \u2014 I have no siblings, and when we\nwent to the underground, you know, we\u2019d go with our pillows and our blankets and\neverything, and there\u2019d be kids to play with. It was wonderful. On the platform, you\nknow, we \u2014 we\u2019d run around and have a great time.",
        "Q: What \u2014 what kids do.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: What kids do, and thank goodness they do.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. It was a very, you know, su-supposedly normal childhood. But \u2014",
        "Q: Do you remember V-E day? Do you remember th-the day that war was over, or\nnot?",
        "A: I remember I went to school, and the teacher said, do you know what day this is?\nIt was V day \u2014 V-D day, V \u2014 the day that they landed at the \u2014",
        "Q: In Normandy?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And, of course, none of us knew.",
        "Q: D-Day, yeah.",
        "A: And she said, remember this day, because it\u2019s very important. There \u2014 the place\nwhere we lived, it wa \u2014 there was a \u2014 a group of \u2014 th-there was a \u2014 an American\nbase not far, and so the soldiers used to come in, and I had a \u2014 a friend who had an\nolder sister who, you know, they used to go out with the G.I.s and everything. And\nwe used to follow the G.I.s, and we\u2019d say to them, got any gum, chum? And they\nwould give us gum. And we thought that was \u2014",
        "Q: The coolest thing, huh?",
        "A: \u2014 the won \u2014 wonderful thing. So that \u2014 that was \u2014 that was really fun. So I\u2014I\nreally didn\u2019t have a deprived kind of childhood. I had a \u2014 a really, you know, pretty\ndecent, considering, you know, when you look back \u2014",
        "Q: The circumstances, yeah, yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 and you think about where \u2014 where I started, and what happened, it was really\npretty normal.",
        "Q: Did your parent try to get out of Vienna earlier than \u201939? Do you \u2014 did they ever\ntalk to you later, when you were older, about the circumstances, and the planning,\nand the, you know, everything \u2014",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: \u2014 that went into leaving, and how they left?",
        "A: No, they never did. The only thing, after the war, we \u2014 my father had a sister\nwho married a doctor, and he survived. He \u2014 I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s still alive, he lived\nin New York, but I do \u2014 I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s still alive or not. He came to visit us in\nEngland, and he told my parents what went on. His \u2014 his wife, my \u2014 my aunt, and\nthey had a child who died in the camps. And he told them, but they wouldn\u2019t let me\nlisten. They sent me to bed, and said you \u2014 you can\u2019t hear this. So I never did hear\nthe story, which \u2014 you know.",
        "Q: And this large, extended family that your father came from, did most of them\nstay in Austria?",
        "A: Just \u2014 well, one brother was severely beaten on Kristallnacht, I remember. I\ndon\u2019t know if he died after that, or if he disappeared, or what happened. Another\nbrother was killed, I believe. His son 1s still alive, and his \u2014 his wife escaped, and\nthey went to Canada, and he\u2019s my Canadian cousin. He\u2019s \u2014 I just saw him a couple\nof weeks ago, we were \u2014 he \u2014 he goes to Florida in the winter. There was one \u2014\nlet\u2019s see, was that a \u2014 that was a \u2014a brother of my father\u2019s, and his family. He had\nwife and two children. They died. They stayed in the camps. As far as I know, my\ngrandmother died, she never left. The rest of the \u2014 the family escaped. My father\u2019s\nfamily. My mother didn\u2019t have a very big family, she had a brother and a sister,\nboth of them went to Canada. So they escaped. So, I basically lost two cousins,\nseveral uncles, and a couple of aunts. But I have an uncle who went to New York,\nand he is the father of the \u2014 the cousin who was the reporter, and I had another aunt\nwho also came to New Jersey, and when we came to the U.S. we stayed with them\nin New Jersey. She married a man who, he had also, he had come from Austria, I\nthink he was a native Austrian. But they \u2014 they had come earlier. And their son,\nwho \u2014 who is another cousin of mine that I\u2019m very fond of, he was born in the U.S.",
        "Q: Post-war, while still in Britain \u2014",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: \u2014 are there any \u2014 what kind of a life was that, in those first, post-war years?",
        "A: We left the little village where we had been billeted with this family, and we\nwent to Cheltenham town, and we bought \u2014 my father bought a house. You know,\nit was a duplex, so he bought the \u2014 half of the house. And I went to school there, not\nliking school all that well, because they made me do phys ed, which I didn\u2019t like.",
        "Q: I share that with you. I share it completely.",
        "A: I\u2014I w-\u2014I went back to the school when I went with my family, and I said, could\nI look at my record? You know, here you can look at any \u2014",
        "Q: Sure.",
        "A: Oh no, we can\u2019t show you the records, they said.",
        "Q: School records? [indecipherable]",
        "A: Because I \u2014 I\u2014 whenever we \u2014 th-they were very much into gymnastics, and I\ncan\u2019t do any of that stuff. And so when \u2014 when \u2014 whenever we \u2014 we would have\none of these days where we would have to perform for the rest of the school, and\neverything was in teams, you know, you were on this team, and \u2014 and you had to do\nthings for the good of the team, and \u2014 and all that. I would stay home that day. And\nI remember going back the next day and the headmistress \u2014 this was a girls\u2019 school,\nsaid to me, why weren\u2019t you here yesterday? And she said, you weren\u2019t sick, were\nyou? And I said no. And she said, why weren\u2019t you here? And I said, I didn\u2019t want\nto let my team down. I thought that was a good way to put it. And they whacked\nyou over the head in those days, they did. I would get whacked. But, I could \u2014",
        "Q: But were \u2014 were you made to feel like a foreigner?",
        "A: We- we were never really considered English. We were always those people\nthat came from Europe, you know. And after awhile it didn\u2019t really bother me,\nparticularly.",
        "Q: Do you think it bothered your parents?",
        "A: It \u2014I think it bothered my father, because he couldn\u2019t wait to come to America.\nHe had family here, you know the \u2014 whatever remained of the family had come to\nthe U.S.",
        "Q: Did they sponsor him in?",
        "A: Yes. The cousin, his father sponsored us in, and so we came. And I immediately\nfelt much more at home, like I could belong here, you know, it was a different\nfeeling. Although I \u2014 I love the British. I go back and I love to go to London and go\nin the theater and do all that kind of stuff. And \u2014",
        "Q: I think you caught it right, though, when you said that, after the war, 1t was not\nyet a very cosmopolitan society.",
        "A: No. Right.",
        "Q: And it\u2019s harder to integrate into British society than it is into American society.",
        "A: Yes, yes. And American society, even though I came here with a pronounced\nBritish accent, I went to high school, and people would say to me, talk British to\nme.",
        "Q: And they still do.",
        "A: But I don\u2019t have the accent any more.",
        "Q: Tell me, did you ever use German again?",
        "A: The only time I used it was when I was in college, and you had to take two years\nof language, and I figured ooh, hey, this 1s gonna be easy. So I took first year\nGerman, which was hard because it was a lot of grammar, which I\u2019d never done,\ncause I\u2019d never gone to school in German speaking country. But the professor said\nto me, don\u2019t take second year German, because you know the vocabulary, go right\ninto third year German, which was basically reading a lot of literature.",

We took one trip for three weeks. We went to Germany, Switzerland\nand Austria, all in the German speaking parts. And by the end of the three weeks, I\nfound I \u2014 I remembered more words.

And my mother, her maiden name was\nAppel, a-p-p-e-l, and I have no siblings, I was an only child. We lived in an\napartment house in a two part apartment, and my \u2014 my father\u2019s brother and his\nfamily, they had two children, their \u2014 they did not stay in Europe either. And we\nlived in the \u2014 the same building. Some years ago, I took my family to Vienna, and I\nknew the address, so I went to look at the building. And there was a plaque there\nthat said this 1s not the original building. The original was destroyed in the war \u2014 in\nthe World War II and I thought, good for them.",
        "A: Yeah, yes, yes. Both my parents were born in Poland. They came to Vienna as\nyoung adults, and I don\u2019t know exactly when that was, and they married. My father\nhad six brothers and three sisters, large family.

        "A: Mm-hm. Well, I was six when I left, so it\u2019s not very, very clear. In fact, when we\nwent back with the family, I walked around trying to think if anything looked\nfamiliar. At the time we were there, they were building a subway, so the whole city\nwas sort of torn up, and so \u2014",

But I don\u2019t have very clear\nmemories of as \u2014 you know, a six year old is not really too sharp. I do remember\nwhen we left Vienna. I remember it was kind of uncomfortable. My mother \u2014 we\nwere not allowed to bring any jewelry with us or anything. And I re \u2014 I remember I\nhad a necklace, a very thin little necklace, and I remember my mother sewed the\nnecklace into the elastic of my underpants. And my father had left a little before us,\nbecause it was really very bad for men. And so my mother and I left, and I\nremember going on the \u2014 the boat from Calais to \u2014",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Well, I thi \u2014 I remember being on the train, but not very clearly, you know? And\nthen I remember on the boat over to Calais. And then we were in England and we\nlived in London. We were there during a lot of the blitz.",

        "A: I was with my mother the whole time. My father went to the Isle of Man.",
        "A: He was interned for 11 months, because the British were very nervous about\npeople who spoke German. And of course, we spoke German then. So he was\ninterned there. Also, my mother had a sister who had married a German, who tried\nto follow \u2014 who did follow her to England. And then he was sent on a transport to\nCanada and it was torpedoed, and he went down. And that was \u2014 she never\nremarried or anything. My father was there for 11 months. He had a great time. He\nbecame a cook, which he never did before or since. And in \u2014 it wasn\u2019t \u2014",
        "A: No, oh no, no. He \u2014 he seemed to, you know, get along with all the people there,\nand when he was released, he came and joined us. By this time \u2014",
        "A: Yes. My mother was only able to work as a domestic. That was the only job that\nwas available for the immigrants. And I remember we went to \u2014 she worked in what\nwas called a \u2014 a boys\u2019 college, it was like private school, with kids living there. And\nI got the measles.

        "A: \u2014 school population. And that was my \u2014 just my mother and I were there at that\ntime. And then my \u2014 the school that I went to in England, and I don\u2019t really have a\nclear picture of that school in London, decided to evacuate everybody out to the\ncountry. So they sent us out to Gloucestershire, and we lived in a little town \u2014 a\nlittle village outside of Cheltenham, and we were boarded with a family there. And\nI \u2014I have very clear pictures of that. I went to school there, they had a \u2014 a regular\nschool in a neighborhood. And I \u2014 I do remember one day the principal I guess it\nwas, called me into the office and said, you \u2014 you understand German? I said, well,\nI don\u2019t speak it much any more, because by then you \u2014 you didn\u2019t speak German.",
        "A: Right, right.",
        "A: I was teaching my parents. My parents had been taking English lessons, you\nknow, with \u2014 with records and stuff. And they \u2014 they died with an accent, okay? I\npicked it up immediately. And the principal said to me, you speak German? I \u2014\nwell, I understand German, cause I didn\u2019t want to speak it any more. And\napparently, there was a prisoner of war camp nearby, and they wanted to bring these\nprisoners over to talk to me, the Germans. And I \u2014",

        "A: Not really. I don\u2019t remember ever actually discussing it with them. It was just\nsort of a fact of life that you left Vienna. You didn\u2019t \u2014 you \u2014 you couldn\u2019t stay there\nany more, because there were these guys marching around with the brown uniforms,\nand the boots, and \u2014 and these were not good guys, and the sooner we got out of\nthere, the better. So, off we went to England, and I became an English child fast. I\n\u2014I was \u2014 as I said, I was teaching my parents English because I \u2014 I picked it up, you\nknow, very quickly.",
        "A: No, I just said I don\u2019t want to talk to them.",
        "A: And that was the end of it, yeah. And I didn\u2019t. I never met them, and I \u2014 I\nwouldn\u2019t speak with them, so I\u2014 I don\u2019t know why they wanted to talk to me in the\nfirst place.",

        "A: Yes, except we always felt a little bit like the outsiders. We were the refugees.\nAt that time, Britain was not very cosmopolitan, especially out in the country, you\nknow, London was a little different, but out in the country, you know. They didn\u2019t\nknow what Jews were. We sort of had to explain, you know. There was a woman\nwho came from London, once or twice \u2014 I think once a week or twice a week, I\ndon\u2019t remember exactly, to teach me Hebrew, which I still can\u2019t read. And once in\nawhile, after things were not quite as bad, we \u2014 we had some relatives in London,\nso we would go to visit them in \u2014 in London occasionally. Meanwhile, my aunt, the\naunt, my mother\u2019s sister, the one who married the German, she had also been\ninterned in the Isle of Man. And she was released, and she stayed in London for \u2014\nuntil after the war, and eventually came to the U.S. But we would go and visit her\ntoo, but this was, you know, not while the blitz was going on. That \u2014 that was pretty\nbad.",
        "A: Yeah.",

I mean, everybody listened\nto Churchill on the radio, and he made things, you know, he was very positive, and\n\u2014 and upbeat and everything. I remember the sound of the \u2014 the bombs, you know,\nthe \u2014 those things that \u2014 that made this noise.",
        "A: Yeah, and then they stopped, and then you knew they were gonna fall. And then\nwhen we went to the underground and \u2014 at night, we would come out in the\nmorning and there would be rubble all over, because you know, the bomb had\ndropped not far away. But the \u2014 the underground was very safe, and everybody\nwent to the underground. I loved it, because I \u2014 I have no siblings, and when we\nwent to the underground, you know, we\u2019d go with our pillows and our blankets and\neverything, and there\u2019d be kids to play with. It was wonderful. On the platform, you\nknow, we \u2014 we\u2019d run around and have a great time.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. It was a very, you know, su-supposedly normal childhood. But \u2014",
        "A: I remember I went to school, and the teacher said, do you know what day this is?\nIt was V day \u2014 V-D day, V \u2014 the day that they landed at the \u2014",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: And, of course, none of us knew.",
        "A: And she said, remember this day, because it\u2019s very important. There \u2014 the place\nwhere we lived, it wa \u2014 there was a \u2014 a group of \u2014 th-there was a \u2014 an American\nbase not far, and so the soldiers used to come in, and I had a \u2014 a friend who had an\nolder sister who, you know, they used to go out with the G.I.s and everything. And\nwe used to follow the G.I.s, and we\u2019d say to them, got any gum, chum? And they\nwould give us gum. And we thought that was \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 the won \u2014 wonderful thing. So that \u2014 that was \u2014 that was really fun. So I\u2014I\nreally didn\u2019t have a deprived kind of childhood. I had a \u2014 a really, you know, pretty\ndecent, considering, you know, when you look back \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 and you think about where \u2014 where I started, and what happened, it was really\npretty normal.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No, they never did. The only thing, after the war, we \u2014 my father had a sister\nwho married a doctor, and he survived. He \u2014 I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s still alive, he lived\nin New York, but I do \u2014 I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s still alive or not. He came to visit us in\nEngland, and he told my parents what went on. His \u2014 his wife, my \u2014 my aunt, and\nthey had a child who died in the camps. And he told them, but they wouldn\u2019t let me\nlisten. They sent me to bed, and said you \u2014 you can\u2019t hear this. So I never did hear\nthe story, which \u2014 you know.",
        "A: Just \u2014 well, one brother was severely beaten on Kristallnacht, I remember. I\ndon\u2019t know if he died after that, or if he disappeared, or what happened. Another\nbrother was killed, I believe. His son 1s still alive, and his \u2014 his wife escaped, and\nthey went to Canada, and he\u2019s my Canadian cousin. He\u2019s \u2014 I just saw him a couple\nof weeks ago, we were \u2014 he \u2014 he goes to Florida in the winter. There was one \u2014\nlet\u2019s see, was that a \u2014 that was a \u2014a brother of my father\u2019s, and his family. He had\nwife and two children. They died. They stayed in the camps. As far as I know, my\ngrandmother died, she never left. The rest of the \u2014 the family escaped. My father\u2019s\nfamily. My mother didn\u2019t have a very big family, she had a brother and a sister,\nboth of them went to Canada. So they escaped. So, I basically lost two cousins,\nseveral uncles, and a couple of aunts. But I have an uncle who went to New York,\nand he is the father of the \u2014 the cousin who was the reporter, and I had another aunt\nwho also came to New Jersey, and when we came to the U.S. we stayed with them\nin New Jersey. She married a man who, he had also, he had come from Austria, I\nthink he was a native Austrian. But they \u2014 they had come earlier. And their son,\nwho \u2014 who is another cousin of mine that I\u2019m very fond of, he was born in the U.S.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: We left the little village where we had been billeted with this family, and we\nwent to Cheltenham town, and we bought \u2014 my father bought a house. You know,\nit was a duplex, so he bought the \u2014 half of the house. And I went to school there, not\nliking school all that well, because they made me do phys ed, which I didn\u2019t like.",
        "A: I\u2014I w-\u2014I went back to the school when I went with my family, and I said, could\nI look at my record? You know, here you can look at any \u2014",
        "A: Oh no, we can\u2019t show you the records, they said.",
        "A: Because I \u2014 I\u2014 whenever we \u2014 th-they were very much into gymnastics, and I\ncan\u2019t do any of that stuff. And so when \u2014 when \u2014 whenever we \u2014 we would have\none of these days where we would have to perform for the rest of the school, and\neverything was in teams, you know, you were on this team, and \u2014 and you had to do\nthings for the good of the team, and \u2014 and all that. I would stay home that day. And\nI remember going back the next day and the headmistress \u2014 this was a girls\u2019 school,\nsaid to me, why weren\u2019t you here yesterday? And she said, you weren\u2019t sick, were\nyou? And I said no. And she said, why weren\u2019t you here? And I said, I didn\u2019t want\nto let my team down. I thought that was a good way to put it. And they whacked\nyou over the head in those days, they did. I would get whacked. But, I could \u2014",
        "A: We- we were never really considered English. We were always those people\nthat came from Europe, you know. And after awhile it didn\u2019t really bother me,\nparticularly.",
        "A: It \u2014I think it bothered my father, because he couldn\u2019t wait to come to America.\nHe had family here, you know the \u2014 whatever remained of the family had come to\nthe U.S.",
        "A: Yes. The cousin, his father sponsored us in, and so we came. And I immediately\nfelt much more at home, like I could belong here, you know, it was a different\nfeeling. Although I \u2014 I love the British. I go back and I love to go to London and go\nin the theater and do all that kind of stuff. And \u2014",
        "A: No. Right.",
        "A: Yes, yes. And American society, even though I came here with a pronounced\nBritish accent, I went to high school, and people would say to me, talk British to\nme.",
        "A: But I don\u2019t have the accent any more.",
        "A: The only time I used it was when I was in college, and you had to take two years\nof language, and I figured ooh, hey, this 1s gonna be easy. So I took first year\nGerman, which was hard because it was a lot of grammar, which I\u2019d never done,\ncause I\u2019d never gone to school in German speaking country. But the professor said\nto me, don\u2019t take second year German, because you know the vocabulary, go right\ninto third year German, which was basically reading a lot of literature.",
        "A: And it wasn\u2019t in the old script, 1t was 1n new script, and so I took that and then\nthat was really a goo \u2014 the extent. We have been back to German speaking\ncountries. We took one trip for three weeks. We went to Germany, Switzerland\nand Austria, all in the German speaking parts. And by the end of the three weeks, I\nfound I \u2014 I remembered more words. And I \u2014 I said to myself, if I ever had to learn\nGerman to really communicate, I could do it. Wouldn\u2019t be a big deal.",
        "A: But it\u2019s not something I\u2019ve ever \u2014 I\u2019ve tried to learn Spanish, you know \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 stuff like that. But I\u2014 I- I\u2019ve really no desire to speak German, or to \u2014 we\nhave a German club here, I\u2019ve never gone. I just don\u2019t want to even bother.",
        "A: I have too many other good things to do here.",
        "A: Well, when \u2014 when my uncle came to visit us, I sort of got the gist of what\nhappened, even though they wouldn\u2019t let me hear all of the details. There was a lot\nof information. This was right after the war, and there was a lot of information in\nthe papers. I think I was aware of what had gone on.",
        "A: It could have been, yeah. No, I don\u2019t think so. It was okay, we\u2019re here now, we\nhave survived this, and now the next step is to go to the U.S. We had to wait four\nyears before we got here.",
        "A: Yeah. We applied immediately, and it took four years, and now \u2014 we came in\nJanuary \u00b049.",
        "A: Sure.",
        "A: For the what?",
        "A: Oh.",
        "A: It was somebody walked through.",
        "A: Just that I don\u2019t feel \u2014 you know, people say to me, where were you born? And I\nse \u2014 oh, Vienna, oh, that\u2019s a wonderful city, and \u2014 and \u2014 and \u2014 you know, they talk\nabout the music and dance and everything. Doesn\u2019t do anything for me. I just have\nno strong feeling about it. None.",
        "A: No, no, it doesn\u2019t mean anything, it \u2014 it \u2014 it really \u2014 you know.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: No, no.",
        "A: Nothing. We walked around. Well, it may have been because of, you know,\neverything was dug up.",
        "A: But I was ready to move on to other places, and we enjoyed Switzerland. We\nbasically flew in and out of Germany, we didn\u2019t spend any time there. But, you\nknow, we went around and we looked at things, but it \u2014 it\u2019s not the kind of thing\nthat I say to my children, oh, you must go back there, because it\u2019s your heritage. It\u2019s\nnot your heritage.",
        "A: So, I\u2014I don\u2019t have any \u2014 I would not \u2014 well, I \u2014 if I had to go to Europe, I\nwould go to England, because I \u2014 I do have a feel for that.",
        "A: But Austria doesn\u2019t \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 doesn\u2019t do it for me, no.",
        "A: I enjoyed it.",
