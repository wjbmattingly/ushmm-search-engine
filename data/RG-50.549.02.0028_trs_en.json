        "Question: Okay, United States Holocaust Memorial, Jeff and Toby Herr collection, this is\nan interview with Doris Greenberg, conducted by Melissa Block, on November 22nd,\ninterview, conducted with Doris Greenberg on November 27th, 1990. The United States\nHolocaust Memorial Museum gratefully acknowledges Jeff and Toby Herr for making\nthis interview possible. This is tape number one, side A. That\u2019s the official business. I\nwanted to just go back and ask you, your parents, I needed to know their names and their\n-- what they did for a living, what your father or your mother did for a living.",
        "Answer: My father\u2019s name was Elkanon Fochs. My mother\u2019s name was Gitl. Gitl\ntranslates to Tova. They called her in Polish Gutcha and my father was called Henry. T-\nThey had a -- a store in Warsaw, haberdashery. Also, in those days, you needed license\nfor selling tobacco or lottery tickets. My father had both and they used to sell both.",
        "Q: What was the name of his store?",
        "A: There was no name, just -- just haberdashery store and I don\u2019t remember seeing any\nname over a particular store. Although, next door, there was my grandmother\u2019s store and\nshe had electrical appliances and her store had a name. So I -- I don\u2019t know why my\nparent\u2019s store had no name. My grandmother\u2019s store na -- store\u2019s name was Znicz. Znicz,\nZ-n-1-c-z in Poland, and that means a flare or a -- in Hebrew, mare tahmid, a light\nforever, Znicz. And that was my grandmother\u2019s store, which was next door to my\nparent\u2019s store.",
        "Q: Okay, and you had -- your sister was older than you, or younger?",
        "A: My sister was older than I, five years older.",
        "Q: And her name was?",
        "A: Her name -- the Jewish name was Malka Arahel. Malka Rachel. She was commonly\nknown at home as Mareesha.",
        "Q: Five years older, okay. You mentioned in the videotaped interview, back in 1990, that\nyour parents disappeared at certain points during the war. Do you remember what years\nthose were or how old you would have been?",
        "A: I can give you approximate times. A-All I remember, actually, was the seasons of the\nyear, whether it was cold or hot. My mother disappeared, I think it was 1942 and it must\nhave been July, or August, was very hot. And I understand that there was a big German\naktion in town and that\u2019s when she -- when she was caught in the street and brought to\nthe Umschlagplatz, which was the -- the railroad station, where they took all the people,\nto send them out. I found out later on that people who were caught and -- that day, were\nsent to Treblinka right away.",
        "Q: So that was 1942, in the summer --",
        "A: Yes, 19 --",
        "Q: What about your dad, was that earlier?",
        "A: No, later. That was later. When there were the factories, the German factories opened\nup in -- in Warsaw ghetto, there were different factories in different parts of -- of\nWarsaw. Where we lived, we went to work at the brush makers, making brushes. And my\nfather and my sister and I, we lived at the Narlefke Street. This was already maybe the\nthird or fourth time that we have moved, since we were thrown out of our own apartment\nand moved into the ghetto. My father went to work at that particular time and did not\nreturn. It seems to have been an aktion and all people from the factory were taken out. So\nhe never returned.",
        "Q: Do you have any idea when that was?",
        "A: It must have been a few months later. Must have been a few months later, can\u2019t\nremember the date.",
        "Q: Okay, so we\u2019re still probably in 1942.",
        "A: Late \u201842, I would think, yes.",
        "Q: Okay. And it was then after that, that your sister was captured?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Do you remember when that would have been?",
        "A: After my father. I-It must have been -- it must have been the end of \u201842, I think. There\nwas an aktion where the Germans came into the building and flushed out -- or at least\ntried to flush out everybody from their hiding places. And at that time, we were 1n an\napartment on -- on the street floor, just a few steps going up. And the -- We were left --\nmy aunt was left, my Aunt Esther. My grandmother was left. My Aunt Esther\u2019s little boy,\nwho was about three years old, yeah, it must have been \u201842. And my sister and I. And\nwhen we heard that the Germans are coming in, we started hiding. Now, my\ngrandmother, my aunt and her little boy, went to a little cabinet underneath the window,\nwhich was used instead of -- instead of a refrigerator. And th-the walls of the building\nwere thick, so there was enough room for those people to get in and I closed the door and\nput a chair in front of it. And my sister didn\u2019t know -- I -- we didn\u2019t know what to do. So\nwe had a folding bed that when it was folded up, it looked like a table. And she crawled\nin there and I put a -- a cover over it and then I didn\u2019t know what to do, the Germans\nwere already in, so I opened the door to the bathroom, but they looked in the bathroom,\ntoo. Then I saw on the -- at the wall -- on the wall of the bathroom, it was a ladder and on\ntop of it was a shelf. There was also a light bulb above the shelf. And I don\u2019t know how I\nwas able to, but I really went up the ladder and sat down on the shelf and unscrewed the\nbulb, making sure that no-none of my clothes hang down. By that time, I could hear the\nGermans in the hallway, coming in and my heart was banging so hard I hoped they didn\u2019t\nhear it. And that\u2019s when they found my sister, and they took her out. At that time they\ndidn\u2019t find my grandmother, my aunt or my little cousin. But they did find my sister.\nSome people told me afterwards, some neighbors, that she was shot. I cannot recall -- I\nwas in such shock, that I don\u2019t remember what I heard and what I saw. I just remembered\nthat I heard her cry and they took her out. They found her in the bed.",
        "Q: And she would have been about 17, it sounds like.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: I\u2019m curious, with -- with your mother and your father, your description in your\nvideotaped interview was, they went out and they never came back. And I wonder what\nthat was like for you, what you remember feeling, that you never really knew what\nhappened to them, you s -- they just disappeared.",
        "A: Well, where my mother\u2019s concerned, we heard from her from Umschlagplatz. She\nmanaged to send word that she is there and asked [phone ringing]",
        "Q: Before the phone rang, we were talking about yo-your mother and your father, when\nthey disappeared.",
        "A: Yeah, well we got word from Umschlagplatz that my mother was there and she was\nasking for help. And my uncle, at that time, tried to -- to contact some friends who\nworked with the police -- with the Jewish police. But, before anything could happen, we\ngot word that the trains left. So, we know that she was caught there and that she was\nthere. And of course, the trains left to Treblinka, that\u2019s what we were advised. When my\nfather didn\u2019t come back, we did not hear anything, except that there was the aktion in the\nfactory and the people were taken out. And this was, oh, I would estimate maybe two\nmonths or three months after my mother, because I remember the weather was windy. I\nreally had to judge everything by the weather. I had no knowledge of dates. There was no\ncalendar to look at. And I think that I was too young or inexperienced to -- to really\nremember dates. Life there was like life of a rat that is hiding and it\u2019s constantly chased.\nAnd one does not know exactly where and when it 1s, day, night, summer, winter. This\nkind of sticks in the mind because it is -- you remember whether you were cold or -- or\nhot. But the dates -- exact dates are not known to me. Later on, when I listened to some\npeople, who were a little bit older, even three, four years older than I am, they knew\ndates. I have a friend who is 10 years my senior, she remembers every date and she has a\nterrific memory. But I don\u2019t remember the exact dates.",
        "Q: Do you remember what you were thinking or feeling? You were about 12 now, a very\ndifficult time --",
        "A: Yeah, 12 and a half, something like that.",
        "Q: Do you remember how -- what -- how you reacted when you found out about this?\nWhen you realized that first your mother, then your father was gone?",
        "A: I was in shock and I don\u2019t know if I can -- if I can assign any thoughts to that period. I\nknow that I was in shock. I know that the thought that was the most important, was\nsurvival and probably I -- probably I thought, \u201cHow can I survive without them?\u201d It was\nactually a -- a selfish feeling, probably. It\u2019s very hard to describe, I even get goosebumps\nwhen I -- when I talk about it, even now, because now I -- I miss them. For all these\nyears, I\u2019ve been missing them. But in those days, I think 1t was more of a -- of a self-\npreservation feeling. Of a, \u2018What am I going to do without them?\u2019 And that\u2019s all that\ncomes to mind. What next, how to survive.",
        "Q: Were you very close to your parents?",
        "A: Very close. Very close to my parents, to my grandparent. I was the youngest\ngrandchild until my little cousin was born. I was quite spoiled as a child. Had terrific\nchildhood, very, very good. I had good school, good teachers. I had everything I needed\nor I wanted. I can\u2019t imagine anybody having a better life than I did at home. My sister\nand I, we were kind of spoiled children. But I was even more, because I was the younger\none, yeah.",
        "Q: You mentioned in the videotaped interview that -- that you had made efforts after your\nsister disappeared to try to find her and I\u2019m curious what -- what you did -- that you just\nsort of were never sure she was really gone.",
        "A: I was never sure that she was gone, because I didn\u2019t hear or see anything. And the\nefforts I tried to make would be after the war. I tried to put ads in paper. Went to agent --\nJewish agencies to look for survivor\u2019s names. I wrote to the international Red Cross. I\neven wrote to them to find out if they heard anything from my parents, because I hadn\u2019t\nseen them being killed and -- and -- and I thought that maybe miracle do happen and\npeople do survive. But everywhere I turned there was a closed door. There was -- Not a\nclosed door, but there was a \u2018no\u2019 answer.",
        "Q: Was this when you were in -- where were you when you were making contact in the\npapers?",
        "A: I was -- I started doing that when I was still in Germany. And then I went to Israel,\ntried from there. And when I came to America, tried again.",
        "Q: And did they have any record of your mother at Treblinka, any --",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Nothing.",
        "A: No records whatsoever, not that I could find any. There is one place, very curious. It --\nIt happened kind of in the last two or three years, that I came across a book of pictures.\nAnd those pictures were compiled by a professor from -- from California and I contacted\nhim and he said that he went to the archives in Koblins, Germany, where they have many,\nmany films taken by German soldiers during the war, and the pictures -- th-the films have\nonly dates on them, dates and places, but of course, no names of people or what th-they\ntook pictures of. And I looked through -- through this book and I found two pictures\nwhere my uncle was in it and that\u2019s when I contacted that professor and I wanted to know\nand that\u2019s what he told me. He said if I went to Koblins, the people there are very\naccommodating and I could look through any pictures I want to. But of course, I didn\u2019t\ndo that. I had a sick son, whom I lost since.",
        "Q: I\u2019m very sorry. The uncle, whose pictures you saw, which uncle was this and where\nwas he?",
        "A: This was the uncle who helped my escape, as well as the escape of my grandmother,\nmy aunt and her boy and his brother and the wife. He helped us all escape from the\nghetto, just as the Warsaw ghetto uprising started in \u201843.",
        "Q: And what was his name?",
        "A: His Jewish name was Mordechai, but he went by the name of Mietek. Yeah.",
        "Q: And where were these pictures taken, that the professor had?",
        "A: It seems to me that it was taken on the stage of a theater in the ghetto. There were two\nor three theaters, one of which was familiar to me because my uncle performed there.\nAnd th-the name of the theater was Azazel. And I used to go there, almost daily to watch\nthe performances of -- of the theater, I used to love it. And I used to go there every day\nafter so-called school. There was no school for us, but we had a professor who formed\nclasses in his house. And he was paid by my parent with whatever they had. Could be a\npair of socks for his children or whatever. And he formed a class. So some of us -- we\nstarted out with about eight or 10 children in the class and little by little, there were\nfewer, because they were caught, they died, or whatever. So, every day after the classes, I\nwould run over to the theater and watch the performances. So, when I saw the pictures, I\nsaw also the other actors, whom I knew, whom I met there. And I tried to even locate\nthem, but it -- it is not very easy. Although I was good at locating people -- I knew where\nto go and how to go about it, but those people I couldn\u2019t locate. So, I recognize on the\npicture the stage, and it must have been taken there. I would have loved to go there, to\nKoblins and look for more pictures and God knows whom I -- I could identify. But, at\nthat time, my younger son was very, very sick and I just -- I just couldn\u2019t do it. I went\naway somewhere for a week or 10 days, I think to Florida and -- and I was sorry I did,\nbecause he couldn\u2019t -- he couldn\u2019t really look after himself, he was very ill. And he\npassed away Friday the 13th of December, of \u201896. So this Friday -- that -- this 13th of\nDecember that\u2019s coming, will be two years that I lost him. So I didn\u2019t pursue any more\nlooking and with me getting so -- falling apart, kind of. It\u2019s -- It\u2019s tough to -- to\nconcentrate on everything.",
        "Q: You mentioned that Uncle Mietek was the one who smuggled you out of the ghetto.",
        "A: Yeah, he did.",
        "Q: Forgive me for asking you a date again, but do you remember what -- around when\nthat would have been?",
        "A: Yes, yes. It would have been in 1943, a little before or after my birthday, which 1s in\nMarch. Probably was in March, maybe in April of *43.",
        "Q: Okay. And then you describe that there was a period of you living outside and then at\none point, you went back to Warsaw on the train. And that would have been \u201844?",
        "A: Oh, that was still \u201843. When -- When we were at -- when my uncle smuggled us out of\nthe ghetto, we -- he prepared, with the help of my other uncle, his brother and -- and her -\n- and his wife, they prepared an apartment. And my aunt\u2019s brother made a double wall in\na room without a window and we could hide there. So, if anybody knocked on the door\nor anything like this, we would just crawl in and hide there until we were found out and\nof course, thrown out.",
        "Q: When -- After you went back to Warsaw, after your uncle was shot, you went back to\nWarsaw and you described that the city was -- everyone was forced onto trains and you\nultimately went to Ravensbrick.",
        "A: Well, that was a year later.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: That was -- I would say more than a year later. The -- The ghetto revolt was Passover\nof \u201c43 and the Polish revolt was September of \u00b044. So, it was a year and a half later.",
        "Q: What do you remember about those two events? Were you in Warsaw at that time?",
        "A: Yes, I was in Warsaw. I was working as a cook\u2019s helper, in one of the suburbs that\u2019s\ncalled Jolybush. When the -- When the Polish revolt started in September, at that time,\nmy aunt was across the river, in Pragga and her little boy was on our side, in Warsaw,\ntake -- being taken care of by a Polish woman named Olga -- Ola. I remembered that day.\nI went to visit my aunt in Pragga and she knitted a sweater for her s-son. She gave me\nthat sweater -- of course, nobody knew we were Jewish -- she gave me that sweater, I\nbrought it to her son and by the time I got back to Jolybush, I heard shots. And that was\nwhen the Polish revolt started, September of *44, yeah.",
        "Q: And what -- And what was -- What was going through your mind at that time? What\ndid you think was happening?",
        "A: I was not terribly emotional about that. I just thought, this 1s a war. Nobody\u2019s after me,\nspecifically. This is a war, there were all kinds of rumors going on, because at -- at some\npoint, we were -- we were bombed by the Cartushas from -- from the other side of the\nriver. And they were, I think, the Russian Cartushas. And sometimes we heard airplanes\nand shooting, lot of shooting, and there were some direct hits. But it was a different\nfeeling for me. They were not chasing me because I was Jewish. It was just a war. And of\ncourse, we want to stay alive and we want to survive the war, but it was not the same as\nbeing chased because you\u2019re Jewish.",
        "Q: When you got on the train and you were being taken to Ravensbrtick, had you heard\nany stories about what went on there? You described that when you went to take a\nshower, you thought that you would be gassed. And I was curious how you even would\nhave known about that.",
        "A: We have heard that in the ghetto, some time before.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: They were -- It seems that there were some people who jumped the trains and came\nback to the ghetto. And since the ghetto was very small, they -- they were tightening it all\nthe time and rumors spread all the time. There were some rumors to that effect. So, when\nwe were taken, in \u201844, as Christians, there was a thought about it, but the thought was\nimmediately countered by a feeling that this cannot happen because I\u2019m here among\nChristians and not Jews and they probably would not do that. At one time, there was a\npossibility to escape and I did not take that chance.",
        "Q: When -- When was that?",
        "A: The train slowed down and it was not part of the way, it was an half open wagon\nwhere they keep cattle, in a half open wagon. They -- Only later they switched to a all\nclosed. But at that time -- and it was still on Polish soil, there was a -- a way to jump out\nof -- of a train when it slowed down. But I did not take the chance.",
        "Q: Why not, do you think?",
        "A: Well, I was with my friend, Peppy. We looked at each other and I think -- I don\u2019t\nthink we talked about it, but we both felt that this -- they are not going to kill us. And I\ndon\u2019t think I could jump or she could jump. We were not that a-athletic. So -- And it was\njust a matter of a short time when the possibility presented itself. The trains were -- were\nwatched by the German soldiers with rifles, so no, we didn\u2019t take the chance. Just like we\ndidn\u2019t take the chance to swallow the poison.",
        "Q: Do you remember being afraid on that train, as you were going to the camp?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, of course. But, you were with other people who were talking and -- and\nthey never heard of dying or being gassed or anything like that. The mood was different.\nIt was like we know that we\u2019re political prisoners. We were taken as political prisoners of\nwar.",
        "Q: Because they didn\u2019t know you were Jewish?",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "Q: I want to ask you about that, let me just -- I\u2019m curious how -- you -- you\u2019d had to hide\nyour identity, I\u2019d -- I don\u2019t know, did your identification papers say you were Catholic?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah, Catholic. How was that for you? You\u2019d been raised in a Jewish home?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Wh-What did that do to you, to be suddenly Catholic?",
        "A: Well, it meant to survive. I also went to see a priest. And the priest apparently was\nvery smart, because he told me that -- that religion -- God 1s for all --\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with\nDoris Greenberg. This is tape number one, side B. You were talking about the priest who\nyou\u2019d come to know.",
        "A: Yes, I had -- I had gone to see him more than once and he was encouraging all the\ntime. Sometimes I -- I thought that he probably knows who I was. Sometimes he would --\nhe\u2019d give me some nuts and candy to take with me in my pocket. And he was very\nencouraging and very nice. Kept me going.",
        "Q: Was there any -- Did you feel any conflict internally, th -- wa -- about having to hide\nyour identity as a Jew?",
        "A: Absolutely, yes. I knew very well that I\u2019m not supposed to be in church. And yet for --\nin order to survive, I had to go to church. I had to do what every -- every other person did\nupon entering the church, put the holy water or make the sign of the crest or whatever.\nYes, I felt very uncomfortable. But the thought of survival meant more than anything\nelse. And I just kept thinking, when I -- if I survive -- when I survive, I\u2019m going to be\nwho I am and not who I pretend to be. And I also know that Jewish religion tells you that\nlife -- a human life is very dear and should be preserved. People are allowed to eat on\nYom Kippur, if their life depends upon it. So, I thought that I\u2019m allowed to -- to go to\nchurch and pray, because my life depends upon it. It was -- This was my mediation in\nchurch, really.",
        "Q: Did the -- Did the religion -- Did that faith in church, was it a comfort to you, to be\nable to do -- worship in some way?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so. I -- I think that my religion was my religion and whenever there was a\nspeech by -- by the -- by the priest, it was a good speech, but I -- I can not identify with\nJesus. I -- Iam -- I wasn\u2019t brought up that way. I couldn\u2019t identify. But, in my mind, I\nwould just substitute the word God. I was praying to God, no names, just God. And that\u2019s\nwhat made it possible for me. And this was my meditation, that I\u2019m preserving my life.\nThat\u2019s what I have to do to preserve it. Same thing with eating non-kosher food, I have to\ndo it. And that was the -- the power of survival is enormous -- is enormous. I went once\nto a course, oh, years later, here in -- in New York. Was a course of -- I think the power\nof negotiation or something like that. Was given by a very good instructor. And before\nthe course, the instructor told us to write down everything we know how to do. And\npeople were writing and writing and writing and I just wrote one word, survive. The\ninstructor was not very pleased and she wanted explanation. But that was what I thought\nmy main achievement in life, to survive. It is -- That feeling 1s terribly strong, especially\nit was for me, I -- I -- I figured fo-for everybody. And people did lot of things to survive.",
        "Q: What -- When you -- When you got to Ravensbrtick -- on the video interview you\ndescribed seeing writing on the wall in Yiddish from something.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: Were there Jews at Ravensbrick still when you were there?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: There were none, no. The only way -- because Peppy could read Yiddish and she\npointed out very discreetly, so that other people cannot see what we\u2019re looking at and she\nshowed me that there were Jewish names and I -- I don\u2019t know what else was on it, but\nthere were messages in Yiddish.",
        "Q: That must have been a real moment, I would think, that hit home, that had your\nidentity been known, your fate might have been very different.",
        "A: Oh, we knew that all along. We knew that all along. We had to even be very careful\nsleeping, not to talk in our sleep. When -- Because we were not alone, we were in big\nbarracks. And if we would say one word that the people don\u2019t understand or they think\nit\u2019s Yiddish or anything like that, 1t would be bad. I thought later on, not at the time -- at\nthe time it didn\u2019t bother me, because I didn\u2019t speak Yiddish. So I -- If I dreamed, 1t would\nbe in -- in Polish. So, it didn\u2019t bother me, but I remember it did bother my friend Peppy,\nwho spoke Polish and Yiddish. And we had to watch each other, to kind of -- not to talk\nin our sleep. There\u2019s so many details when you -- when you want to hide under\nsomebody -- to be somebody else. Doesn\u2019t pay, unless your life depends on it, 1t does not\npay. It\u2019s a -- I-It\u2019s a very, very 1-involved task.",
        "Q: You went to a labor camp after Ravensbriick --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Do you remember the name?",
        "A: Noibrandenberg -- Noibrandenberg. That was in a forest. There were barracks dug in\nthe ground and also barracks of factories. So -- huge barracks and the factories were\noutside of the camp, but also in barracks. So, we were brought there and I remember the\nwalls were dripping with water and when -- this was wintertime, yeah. We were brought\nthere, was wintertime, right.",
        "Q: Of 1944?",
        "A: 1944, right. And then they sent us out to the -- a -- a group of laborers, women\nlaborers, we laid tracks for a train. So we -- They used to march us out with SS people\nand dogs and went to -- marched to -- to the place where they wanted us to put their\nrailroad tracks. We worked for 12 hours a day and then they marched us back.",
        "Q: You then went to something called free work and I\u2019m curious if you had any notion of\nwhat that was, or --",
        "A: Yeah, when I said free work, I meant that there was no camp. That you living in\nfreedom, that you can go out on the street or -- or go where and come wherever you want.\nThat it was not in a camp, not in a jail. That is what I called free. Although you were assi\n-- | was assigned to a couple who owned a store downstairs and they lived upstairs and I\nthink they were assigned a slave, me, because they had a daughter who was an SS person.\nI didn\u2019t know it at the beginning, but I was assigned to this elderly couple and they were\nquite good to me. They demanded their work and they gave me a place to sleep and some\nfood to eat. They did not hit me, they did not treat me badly, so 1t was okay, except when\ntheir daughter came to visit. They were shaking, they were very nervous, and I didn\u2019t\nknow why. Come to think of it, maybe they were afraid of her, too. And when she saw\nme, that daughter, she wanted to know if I understand a lot of German, because it\u2019s\nsimilar to Yiddish and if I can say something so that she could see that I speak Yiddish.\nMa -- I don\u2019t know whether it was my imagination or -- or it was for real, but she did a-\nask me questions and most of the time I -- I just didn\u2019t know what to say. I could say yes,\nI could say no and -- or I could gesture with my hands like maybe. And she was quite\nunnerving me. I think maybe she was doing the same to her parents. I noticed they felt\nmuch better when she left. So that\u2019s what I called free work.",
        "Q: When they announced that they were going to be sending you there, do you remember\nwhat your emotions were? I mean, did you sort of feel like the worst was over? Was it\nany kind of relief or did it not seem that way?",
        "A: They did not announce anything. They just put you on the train and -- and got you\nthere. They didn\u2019t announce anything. In the last minute, they say, \u201cYou are going be\nhere. You are going to work here.\u201d But, in the camp, they did not announce anything.\nSaid that we\u2019re going to go out to work. We really didn\u2019t know where we were going.\nBut it turned out that -- that\u2019s where we went. And it must have been -- must have been\nwhat -- end of \u00b044, beginning of fort -- no, it was in \u201845. It was already in \u201c45, because I\nremember being there not a very long time, when we were liberated. And we\u2019re liberated\nin May of \u201845. So we must have gone to that place in \u00b045, I assume.",
        "Q: So you were there for a few months? [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yeah, right.",
        "Q: Okay. I want to ask you about liberation. Can you tell me what you remember about\nthat day?",
        "A: Oh, that was a miserable day for me. It was awful. I got almost killed. The Russians\ncame to town and apparently they had to fight very hard and they were very excited about\neverything. And their idea of survivors was a mistaken idea that whoever survived, must\nhave cooperated with the Germans. And out of this assumption, they almost killed us.",
        "Q: What happened?",
        "A: We talked. They talked to me, I talked to them and I talked again and again. The\nwhole day went by talking. And for some reason, there were other soldiers that came in\nand talked to others and somehow we survived.",
        "Q: Do you remember -- I\u2019m curious how it happened, did -- did you see troops all of a\nsudden, did they walk up to the house?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, oh yeah",
        "Q: Tell me about that.",
        "A: Oh yes, the-they -- they went into the house. They were looking for things that they\nwanted. Food, drinks, watches, bicycles, anywh -- anything. And there was a bicycle\nupstairs in the attic. It must have been the bicycle of their daughter, I don\u2019t know. But\nthey went up and they found it and they took it. They wanted me to go upstairs and --\nwith them, but I was afraid, so I didn\u2019t. And I just told them where the bicycle was. Now,\nthose people had the store with foodstuff. There was sugar, there was flour. And I don\u2019t\nknow they took anything, they must have taken some edible things that you don\u2019t have to\ncook, but they did take the bicycle and they were running around looking for things that\nthey wanted. And at -- at the same time, they were talking about the survivors who were\ncooperating with the Germans. And I kind of tried to stay away, if I could. Then another\ngroup came in and they met and they talked and they talked to me and to the -- to the\nGerman couple. They really were looking for things, maybe they took something from\nthem, their watches I suppose, I don\u2019t know. And -- And they -- Then they went the next\nhouse. So it was a very, very tough day. At the evening, after I was all alone, I decided to\ngo to Peppy.",
        "Q: What happened to the family?",
        "A: Oh, they stayed there, they were fine.",
        "Q: Oh, you said you were all alone, so the soldiers had left?",
        "A: Yeah, the soldiers were gone, yeah.",
        "Q: Okay, you mentioned you had been afraid to go upstairs with them. What were you --\nWhat were you afraid of?",
        "A: My room was upstairs and there was a bed and things. And I didn\u2019t want them to -- to\ngo to my room with -- with me in it. So, I didn\u2019t want to go upstairs. And they went and\nthey got their bicycle or whatever else in the attic and there were others who -- wh --\nwhen -- when this group was upstairs, others came in, because they were coming in -- the\ntroops were coming in, pouring in. And they came and went and whoever got what. I\nsuppose they wanted to be ahead of their friends to get more stuff, I don\u2019t know. I was\nscared.",
        "Q: Did they mistreat you in any way\u201d?",
        "A: No, except that they talked to me like that. Not all of them, but many of them would\nsay, \u201cYou'll get yours. You cooperated with the Germans.\u201d I never mentioned to\nanybody that I was Jewish. I was still afraid. So, 1-1t was tough. It was very, very scary.",
        "Q: And they left the couple alone?",
        "A: Yeah, oh yeah. I suppose they left everybody alone after they took what they wanted\nand after they had a night\u2019s sleep, when the fighting stopped. They seemed to be very\nexcited, nervous, tired, hungry. They were the -- the front line soldiers.",
        "Q: And it\u2019s curious to me, they were essentially setting you free, but it do -- doesn\u2019t\nsound like you viewed them as your ally at that point.",
        "A: Well, I did, in my head, I did. Because they -- they freed me from the Germans. So, I -\n- I felt very good towards them, but they put other thoughts -- they had other thoughts in\ntheir mind about people like myself, who survived. Maybe they were told that this is the -\n- the case. Maybe it was their own idea. I\u2019m not talking about a whole regiment of\nsoldiers, I\u2019m talking about those who came my way. And those that came my way, some\nof them -- many of them had that idea.",
        "Q: How did that make you feel?",
        "A: It made me feel helpless. And not knowing what to do. What do I tell those people,\nno, you\u2019re wrong? And all together, your -- you\u2019re wrong assuming anything that you\nassume, because I\u2019m not really the person that you think I am. Couldn\u2019t say anything. I --\nI was really upset and -- and helpless.",
        "Q: And you didn\u2019t tell them you were Jewish?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Wh-Why didn\u2019t you tell them that?",
        "A: Because I learned by then that nobody likes Jews. And therefore it isn\u2019t going to do\nme any good.",
        "Q: So, even though they were the liberators, presumably they were not the enemy.",
        "A: They were not the enemy. They were -- They were the liberators. I wish they could\nbehave a little better than they did, but yes, I was glad to be liberated from the Germans,\nyeah. I heard later on different stories of different people who were treated very badly by\nthe Russian liberators, but I have not experienced that and I have not seen that.",
        "Q: Treated badly how?",
        "A: Oh, there are people who told me that they were mugged. That they were -- they were\nhit. I hadn\u2019t seen anything like that. I -- I can tell you what I saw and I\u2019m telling you what\nI heard, but I felt good to be liberated from the Germans and that was the main thing, but\nthey scared me because of their thoughts of why I was spared. Because they were\nmistaken. I did not cooperate with Germans, besides, no German wanted my cooperation.\nI -- I just rode out the waves of the war and I was glad that the war is over and maybe\nsome peace will come and -- and I -- even then I hoped that I could find some of my\nfamily. That was always, in my head. So, I -- I felt good about being liberated.",
        "Q: And you went to find your friend, how did you get to her house?",
        "A: I walked. I walked. At that time I would walk a couple -- a few miles. She was in a\nvery small place a -- that -- ba -- at a farm. Th -- She was farmed out to the farmer from\nthe camp. And it just so happened -- happened that in that farm where she was, I -- I\ncame there to -- to be with her, because I was very much afraid. And then the Russians\ndecided to be there to -- to take that farm as their headquarters in the area. So, 1-it was --\nit was an unexpected event. However, it was not bad because by that time when I went\nthere, she represented herself as my mother. So I kind of felt protection. And indeed, I\ngot a lot of protection because they knew that there is a mother and daughter, and that we\nwere Polish. So, it went much easier. And those people who came there, the Russian\nmilitary, not all of them had this idea that the survivors were cooperating. They set up\ntheir headquarters and they had Peppy work for them, interpret. And Peppy said to them\nthat she will be very glad, but to announce that her daughter is here and she is not to be\ntouched. And that\u2019s exactly what happened, so I was protected.",
        "Q: And how long did you stay there?",
        "A: We stayed there not long. Maybe some -- Maybe two months. It was still not cold out\nwhen -- it was still summer, maybe deep summer, we set out to go to Berlin.",
        "Q: Now, how did you decide to go to Berlin? Did Peppy decide? Did you talk about it?",
        "A: Oh, we talked about it, sure. And by that time we knew that in Berlin there were\narmies of all the allies and we better get there as a first stop and then see if we could go\nback to our respective homes, to hope to meet our survivors -- our family who survived.\nBut Berlin was the first stop.",
        "Q: And how did you -- how did you get there? How far away were you?",
        "A: We were very far away. We had -- the farmer had a horse and the Russian found, in\nanother farmer\u2019s place, a little carriage, which they took. And what they did, they brought\nPeppy and me to the railroad station on that horse and buggy. And then we went on the --\non the train to Berlin.",
        "Q: Tell me about Berlin.",
        "A: Well, we came to Berlin and we wanted to s -- and we went to the Jewish -- society or\nJewish headquarters or what do they call it here? The Jewish government kind of -- was\nin Oranyanboogerstrasser. The Yiddish Agaminda. And at that time, it -- there was some\npeople there and it was not excellently organized, but pretty good. And there was -- there\nwere some people coming and needing things and there were local people who manned\nthat -- that -- what shall I call it, club, or the Jewish -- what do they call it? The Jewish\ngovernment, if there is such a thing. Anyway, I was interviewed by one of the people\nthere and when I told him that I was Jewish, he wouldn\u2019t believe me. He thought that I\ntold him I was Jewish so that I can get a package of food, or a place to stay from the\nUNRRA.",
        "Q: United Nations Relief wor -- agency?",
        "A: Yes. Which at that time -- I found out later it was bringing a lot of help, blankets and\nclothes and food to Berlin for the DP\u2019s, displaced persons. And this particular person that\ninterviewed me was under the impression that I\u2019m telling him I was Jewish so that I could\nget some of the goodies. Well, I had a problem convincing him. And he asked all kinds of\nquestion and then he asked me to recite the shmisered, the prayer. I didn\u2019t know the\nwhole thing, but I knew some of it. Although -- he asked me the names of my parents and\nI told him the Jewish name. I told him my Jewish name. I had to recite the schma, which I\ndid a poor job, but I did some. And finally, reluctantly, he thought that I was Jewish.",
        "Q: That\u2019s a curious thing, isn\u2019t it --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- because you\u2019d been having to deny that Jewishness --",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "Q: -- for so long, and here was someone who didn\u2019t believe it. How -- How did that\nregister for you?",
        "A: Ver-Very awkward. Very awkward. I had the same comment you just did. I had to\nfight all this time to dispel from other people\u2019s minds that I might be Jewish, and here\nI\u2019m trying to tell him I am and he doesn\u2019t believe me. Very awkward.",
        "Q: Where were you staying when you were in Berlin?",
        "A: We found Peppy -- Peppy found actually, an apartment of a young, German lady with\na baby. Her husband, I think was a -- a prisoner of war. And she had an extra bedroom.\nSo she rented us the bedroom for some food. I don\u2019t think we paid her anything but food.\nPeppy made the arrangements, I\u2019m not sure. But she gave us that bedroom, which was\nvery nice and finally we could sleep in a -- in a bed, 1n a house, rather than all kinds of\nother bad places. So that was nice.",
        "Q: Do you remember that first night, when you actually had a bed in a safe place?",
        "A: Yeah. It was very, very funny, w -- because the -- the apartment, th-the room,\neverything was very nice, but I thought, \u201cOh, I\u2019m loo -- going to look around and see\nwhat it is like.\u201d Well, I fell asleep like a log, did not enjoy anything else but sleep.",
        "Q: And you stayed in Berlin about how long, do you think?",
        "A: I stayed in Berlin, let\u2019s see, four, five, probably six to eight months, something like\nthat.",
        "Q: That\u2019s a long time.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Why don\u2019t we take a break here, the tape\u2019s running out.\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with\nDoris Greenberg. This is tape number two, side A. We\u2019re still in Berlin. Tell me what the\n-- what the atmosphere was like at that time. Was it filled with people? Did it -- What did\nit seem like?",
        "A: Well, the atmosphere was chaotic. There were a lot of foreigners, many people, many\nsurvivors came. They were military of all area -- al-allied groups. And people are trying\nto find things -- find other people, find their relatives, find a place to stay, acquire some\nclothes, acquire some food. It was quite chaotic, but the allies brought in a lot of help.\nThere was one synagogue, I remember, and in that synagogue, they had brought in\nblankets and clothes and some food packages I think, I\u2019m not sure. And they were\ndistributed to -- to people who needed them. The German people were -- also were quite\ndepressed and they needed some help, too; they had no food. However, it was in a short\nperiod of time, there was -- a black market developed. Ill never forget that, it was called\nAlexanderplatz and in -- in that place, you could probably trade for everything you\nneeded. You could buy or sell or whatever. The German people would bring out their\nwares, maybe their clothes or their watches or whatever, to sell, to exchange for food.\nThe survivors were -- were looking for everything that they couldn\u2019t get from the Jewish\nagency. Oh, that\u2019s the word I was looking, the Jewish agency, not government. So, it was\na time of confusion and people, being very eager and looking for things and for people.\nSomehow, one tried to help the other. It was a very nice day and I can\u2019t remember what\nkind of a Jewi-Jewish holiday it was, it\u2019s very hard for me to tell. There was a Jewish\nholiday and Peppy invited the Jewish soldiers from the allied armies to come and\ncelebrate the Jewish holiday. And I remember they were Russians, they were Americans,\nBritish, French. I don\u2019t think there were any Polish. And whatever Peppy cou-could get\nin the way of food, she would prepare and there were candles lit and this was -- this was a\n-- a thing that will always bring tears to my eyes, because this is the first time that people\nin different uniforms of different countries, sat at the table and recited the same prayer.\nWhatever food there was, I don\u2019t remember. Probably wasn\u2019t much and probably some of\nit was that the allies brought in in cans or whatever. But the li -- the -- the candles were lit\nand all the different nations, who couldn\u2019t speak to each other because of the language\nbarrier, they could recite the same prayer. And that was something that I will always\nremember.",
        "Q: Did you -- Did you start going to synagogue regularly? Were there places to worship\nfor you?",
        "A: No, no. I did not go to worship anyplace at that time. I just didn\u2019t know where I was,\nwhat I was doing and I was planning to -- to look for my family, if anybody -- and -- and\nI figured that if anybody survived, they\u2019Il go back home. So, I wanted to go to Warsaw\nand go to the house where we lived and see if anybody shows up. Or go to the Jewish\nagency and see if anybody registered. That was my first and only thought at that time.",
        "Q: And did you -- did you do that? Were you able to go to Warsaw?",
        "A: Well, I started. I was on my way in a train, from Berlin, to go to Warsaw. And in a\ntown of Dresden, the train was held up by the Russians and all the foreigners were taken\noff. I don\u2019t know if the Germans were taken off or not, but all the foreigners were taken\noff the train and hold into the jail. And the explanation given was, that the Russians are\ngoing to help us go home. Originally, I wasn\u2019t worried, well if -- if the Russians are\ngoing to help me to go home, that would be fine. That\u2019s where I was going anywhere.\nBut, as we were put in the jail cells, there were some people from Ukraine. And they told\nme that you really don\u2019t go home, they don\u2019t send you home. They send you somewhere\nin Russia, wherever they want to. I was scared. I don\u2019t want to go anywhere in Russia, I\nwanted to go to Warsaw. And the mere fact that we were locked up and not let out,\nscared me again. So this -- this person that was there told me how to escape, and I did.",
        "Q: Tell me about that.",
        "A: Well, you asked the guard to escort you to the bathroom. And the bathroom was on\nthe entrance, on the street level, kind of. Just a few steps. So, he escorted me to the\nbathroom and he was walking up and down the hallway, huge hallway. So, I watched\nwhen he was very far away with the back to me, and I walked out and down the stairs and\nI -- very wide stairs. On each side there were policeman. Polish -- No, not a Pole --\nGerman police and German soldier, I think. I remember the police, but there were two of\nthem on each side. And when I walked out, I walked in the middle of the stairs, head high\nand very sure of myself. And nobody said anything. I -- I looked left and right, wherever\nI saw a corner of the -- of the street, closer. I think it was to the right. I turned right and I\nwalked -- I kind of marched, until I hit the corner. When I went around the corner, I\nstarted running. And I ran very quickly. I went back to the railroad station. I had no\nmoney for a ticket, but 1t was -- I just went so quickly and I yelled something, I think in\nRussian or in Polish, when they wanted a ticket -- I didn\u2019t give them. And -- and because\nI saw the train started moving and I hopped in the train. And the train took me back to\nBerlin. It was the only train I could see there. It lucky took me to Berlin, it could have\ntaken me somewhere else. So I went back to Berlin. On the way, they stopped and they\nlooked for people again, but then I was lucky. I -- When -- When I jumped in to the train\nand I saw there were some Russian officers sitting and they showed me that I could sit\nnext to them, so I did. And that\u2019s where my Russian language kind of -- although broken,\nbut it was helpful.\nAnd they started talking to me a-and I said, \u201cI\u2019m on my way.\u201d They told me, \u201cAre you\ngoing to Berlin, too?\u201d So I said yes. I was glad to know it\u2019s Berlin. And I told them yes, I\nwas going to Berlin too, to see my relatives, who were there after the war. And we\ndeveloped a nice conversation. And when the train stopped at night and the other Russian\nsoldiers came to look for foreigners, this particular officer, who sat across this -- the\nbench from me, he said to the soldiers, \u201cGo away, it\u2019s middle of the night, we\u2019re all\nsleepy. Go away.\u201d I couldn\u2019t be happier. And the soldier went away. So I could go back -\n- otherwise, I would be caught again and brought to jail again. And I didn\u2019t know -- it --\nit scared me, the fact that -- that they put us 1n jail before they send me away, that scared\nme. I would have been glad to go home, just because I was on my way. And -- And that\u2019s\nwhy I -- I never went back to -- to Warsaw after the war. I came back to Berlin.",
        "Q: I\u2019m curious about that, you mentioned about being back in jail. \u2019m wondering if, in\nthe time that you were berl -- in Berlin, did you feel genuinely free?",
        "A: More or less, yes. I felt good because I was with Peppy and she -- she really took good\ncare of me. It was not only name that -- that she was my mother, she -- she really tried her\nbest to be my mother and she behaved like one. It was a -- a great feeling to have\nsomebody watching over you. Oh, many times I gave her aggravation. Refused to do\nwhatever she said, you know, but -- but it\u2019s part of it.",
        "Q: So, on this train to Berlin, I\u2019m figuring you were about 16?",
        "A: 15.",
        "Q: 15.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: All by yourself?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: She let you go?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And then you f -- How did you find her when you got back to Berlin?",
        "A: Well, we were in the same apartment in -- in that place where we had the room, a\nbedroom. And she was there, so I could go there. As a matter of fact, this officer, who sat\nacross from me, he apologized aft -- to yell -- for yelling at the soldier. And I said,\n\u201cThat\u2019s okay.\u201d He was a gentleman and -- and I told him that I was going to Berlin and\nmy mother is there and all that. And he wanted the address and I gave him. And he\nshowed up. He showed up, he came in, he -- had a very nice reception, Peppy and I. He --\nHe had tea, or whatever there was. And we had a very nice visit and he apologized again\nfor yelling at the soldier and he left. Wasn\u2019t that nice?",
        "Q: You had mentioned earlier that you were trying to find your family. Ha -- Did you try\nto do that in Berlin? How would you go about doing that?",
        "A: Well, in Berlin, there were several ways that ja -- that one could do it. The Jewish\nagency, they had registry. People that came in from other countries, they would register\nthere that they are alive. There were also soldiers from different countries. Some of them\ntook -- I asked them to put ads in the paper. There was the international Red Cross. I tried\nto -- to reach -- to find where they are. It wasn\u2019t easy, because it was all chaotic and --\nand it was all new established and some offices there were before, were not any more.\nBut it was possible to find. And -- And I put in inquires everywhere.",
        "Q: Did you have any luck?",
        "A: None. There is one thing that -- one thing that came out of it is that after awhile the --\nI asked a British person, who went home for vacation, to put in England an ad, because\nmy father had a brother in England with family, for many years. So, they put an ad, and\nsure enough, I found my uncle.",
        "Q: Which uncle is this?",
        "A: My father\u2019s brother.",
        "Q: What\u2019s his name?",
        "A: Philip. And -- Philip Fox. And he -- his friend saw the ad in the paper and called him\nand within a little while -- there were some British soldiers in the area and my uncle\nknew their parents. And they wrote to them and they came to visit and I was 1n -- in the\norphanage then. They came to visit, they said their parents wrote that here I was, to find\nout how I am and if I want to go to England.",
        "Q: I want to get back to that in a second, but I\u2019m still curious about one other thing in\nBerlin. Was it even anything as -- I imagine you would be walking down the street just\nlooking at faces, trying to find familiar faces, and --",
        "A: All the time.",
        "Q: Tell me about that.",
        "A: I look at faces wherever I go, for 50 years or more, hoping to find a familiar face. I\njoined the [indecipherable] the Warsaw ghetto resistance organization in New York,\nbecause for awhile we lived in New York, in Manhattan. So I joined them, and every\ntime there was a meeting, I would just go there and stare at faces. I didn\u2019t find anybody.\nA friend of mine find -- found friends. The one that 1s a little older and she could\nremember better, or maybe her friends didn\u2019t change as much. I didn\u2019t find a soul that I\nknow.",
        "Q: What is that like when you\u2019re looking at faces? I mean --",
        "A: Very disappointing, and the question is here, look at me, don\u2019t you know me? It\u2019s not\nas if I am supposed to know you, because I am a child. It\u2019s that you are supposed to\nrecognize me. Without realizing that this is not possible, children change faster than\nadults. Didn\u2019t realize that. Don\u2019t -- Doesn\u2019t anybody know me? Nobody knew me. Even\nif they did know my parents, they wouldn\u2019t recognize me. I didn\u2019t know that. So this\nlooking at faces, whenever you are at a Jewish gathering, is something that I do\nautomatic, wherever I go.",
        "Q: Well, your next stop after Berlin, what was that and how -- how did you decide where\nyou were going? How did that get figured out?",
        "A: Well, to begin with, after -- after a little while, the -- Berlin was divided into zones,\ninto different zones. And there was Russian, an American, a British, a French. And they\nstarted closing in. At that time, Peppy, who was very active in helping everybody and she\ngot me involved in it, too. Like when -- when some survivors came in, she would say,\nhere is the Jewish agency and here 1s their -- the synagogue and what -- she tried to -- to\nhelp a lot of people. She got me involved in it and -- and at one time, she said to me that\nshe and some other people organized for a group of orphans to go to the British zone. But\n[ -- I have to be in that orphanage. So she registered me in that orphanage in Berlin. And\none day there was a British truck, covered truck. Came up, pick up the children from the\norphanage, including me, and they drove us off to -- to Bergen-Belsen. And that\u2019s how I\ngot to Bergen-Belsen.",
        "Q: Did you know where you were going?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: And had you said goodbye to Peppy? Did -- What --",
        "A: Peppy said that she will come as soon as she can. That she will come to the British so\n-- zone, as soon as she can. Becau -- She got involved in helping others so much that\npeople came to depend on her and she didn\u2019t want to let them down. So, she send me out\nand she knew where we\u2019re going, because it was arranged. And then she said that as soon\nas she can, she will come to join me.",
        "Q: Did you know that you were going to a place that had been a camp, during the war?",
        "A: Well, we did not go to a place that was a camp, it was the same town, but the\norphanage was in the barracks of -- in the former barracks of the soldiers.",
        "Q: Ah.",
        "A: Was not the camp. It was a building and it was in-indoors, it was in a nice area.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Like a -- a barracks, but built out of brick. I even have the pictures of it.",
        "Q: And tell me about that time. How -- How did you feel about being there? What was it\nlike?",
        "A: It felt like a temporary assignment, like a temporary thing, because it was in the back\nof my head still to go back to Warsaw to find relatives. I thought about that most of the\ntime and it felt like this is a good stop, a place to stop and wait until the opportunity\npresents itself to travel to Warsaw, to find my relatives.",
        "Q: What -- How were you -- How were you treated? What were -- What were the\nconditions like for you?",
        "A: I was treated as good as could be. Everybody had to eat -- needed things and people\nmainly were survivors there. Conditions were not that great, but they were the best they\ncould be. They gave us some clothes, they gave us a place to sleep, food to eat and then --\nth-th -- there was one nurse there, I -- I just went to visit with her in Ramatgan. She was\njust fantastic, she would care about all the children. She would act like a mother to\neverybody. And that\u2019s where I met her. She apparently was liberated from the camp in\nBergen-Belsen with a group of children and when they brought us from Berlin, we were\njust additional children. And it was fine.",
        "Q: What\u2019s her name? Tell me about her.",
        "A: Oh, her name is Hela.",
        "Q: Hela what?",
        "A: When I met her, her name was Hela Wash. Of course, now her name is Hela Yafare.\nShe was -- She is a fantastic lady. She treated us well, she was -- ca -- she cared about all\nthe children. Now, when I was in Ramatgan, and I came to visit with her. I came with my\nson and daughter-in-law and she was at home with her husband and she kept referring,\nwhenever she talked to my son and daughter-in-law, she kept referring to me as her\nchildren. She would say, you know, another one of my children, such and such, called.\nAnd -- So we were her children. And it was great to see her.",
        "Q: Have you -- you\u2019ve stayed in touch with her all this time?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: Wow. Ha-Has -- Tell me about that, how have you -- how did you find her and how\ndid you keep in touch?",
        "A: Well, we -- we went to Israel and we were in, Kayata Navim and she came to Israel,\nshe came to visit and the whole group just loved her. And for awhile she was there and\nthen she moved to -- to Tel Aviv. And we each visited her whenever we had a day off, or\nso. We would visit and she would visit and we -- we stayed in touch.",
        "Q: Pll come back to the Israel chapter in a little bit, but I want to get you there first. How\nmany -- Was it all girls at fir -- at the orphanage camp, was it --",
        "A: Oh no, girls and boys.",
        "Q: Girls and boys.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: About how many, do you think?",
        "A: In the orphanage, I don\u2019t know how many there were. But, when we went to Israel,\nout of that place, I know we were 80, a group of 80. We were divided into two groups\nand each one went to a different kibbutz, cause they had the reunion fo-for which I -- I\ngot a tape of the reunion, I wasn\u2019t there. I was there in the previous reunion, but this\nreunion I wasn\u2019t there. And they made me -- for me a -- a tape, which I brought with me,\nI saw it. And she was there at the reunion, she\u2019s there at every reunion. She\u2019s just a\nfantastic lady.",
        "Q: Did you -- I don\u2019t -- How long were you at Bergen-Belsen [indecipherable |",
        "A: We were at Bergen-Belsen just a couple of months -- a few months.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And we\u2019re transferred to a -- ablankanasia, which is near Hamburg.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: There was a -- an estate, I think the Varburg estate. And they have arranged for us to\nbe there to -- to transform it into an orphanage and we were brought over there, so it was\nbeautiful, it was beautiful. And from there, we were sent to Israel, via Marseilles.",
        "Q: Okay. Now, in this time, when you were at these orphanages, did you -- did you have\nany kind of boyfriend?",
        "A: Not really boyfriend, but developed friendship with a few people, girls as well as\nboys.",
        "Q: Yeah? These people you\u2019re still in touch with, besides the -- the nurse?",
        "A: Some people, yes. One of them brought a book, and when I got there now to Israel,\nthere was a copy of the book for me, with her writing because she couldn\u2019t come to meet\nme, she was going out of town to a seminar. So -- and I was so sick, I read the book. I\nwas surprised that I could still read Hebrew with -- without punctuation. I haven\u2019t done it\nin a long time, but slowly it came back to me and I read her book about her life. Very\ninteresting. And then I went to visit my room mate and she invited a few people from the\nsame group, who came to visit and brought pictures. So, it was nice.",
        "Q: Th-The children, or young adults -- you were, at this point, I guess 16 -- 15 -16, at the\ncamp, did you tell each other about your experiences di -- during the war? Did people\ntalk about it?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so. I don\u2019t think so. The main thing was 1-if -- when you made\nacquaintance with another survivor, the main questions was -- were, which camp did you\ngo to? Which camp did you survive? If the camp was the same as that person, then they\nwould compare notes to people they knew or the -- the bad guys or what -- what it was\nlike in the camp. But, this is how people got acquainted, what camp were you in.",
        "Q: Did you see a lot -- any evidence of trauma, of people who were really scarred after\nthe war emotionally or physically?",
        "A: We were all scarred. We were all scarred and I think that this 1s going to last a\nlifetime. I thought that I can always point out a person -- a survivor -- from any group of\npeople. I can do that, I think. Because we have a scar. We have a certain way of behavior,\na certain way of speaking or behaving that points to the fact that we\u2019re survivors. That\u2019s\nin my opinion.",
        "Q: When we change sides, I want to ask you about that a little bit more.\nEnd of Tape Two, Side A\nBeginning Tape Two, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with\nDoris Greenberg. This is tape number two, side B. You were talking about being able to\nrecognize survivors. Tell -- Tell me what you mean by that. What do you -- What do you\nsee?",
        "A: I find that we survivors have a certain way of speaking, of behaving, that I don\u2019t find\namong other people, who never went through the hell we did. That\u2019s how it seems to me.\nWe -- We can compare -- We can compare to each other, but we don\u2019t have the good\ntimes that other people talk about. There\u2019s some among us that block out the -- the\nhappenings during the war, although it was just a few years, but it left a big scar on\neverybody. And even, it -- just like in the Jewish religion, whenever there is a holiday,\nthere is an eeskar. That\u2019s the prayer for the departed. I find that whenever we have even\nthe greatest simcha, which 1s a celebration, we always remember the bad times. And I\nfind it many times in people\u2019s eyes, in their voices and behavior. I\u2019m not trying to\nanalyze, but it seems to me that I can recognize people who are survivors.",
        "Q: Other kinds of survivors, as well? I mean, if you were to find someone who\u2019d\nsurvived Cambodia, or Rwanda or any other sort of mass slaughter of people, do you\nthink it would be the same, or is there something unique?",
        "A: Well, I can only speculate on that. My speculations would point out that yes, you can.\nBecause people who have such past, where they suffered a lot, they usually behave in a\nmilder way, I think. But that would be just speculation.",
        "Q: Okay. I think where we left off, you were -- you had just left Bergen-Belsen, you were\nin the other camp in -- oh, I wanted to mention one more thing at Bergen-Belsen. You\nhad mentioned a woman, Haddassah Rosenzaft, who was there.",
        "A: Oh, yes.",
        "Q: Tell me about her.",
        "A: Well, Haddassah Rosenzaft, when I met her in Bergen-Belsen, her name was\nHaddassah Bimko. She is also a survivor -- was -- she passed away since. She was in the\ncamp of Bergen-Belsen, and sister the -- we call her Sister Hela, the one I spoke about\nbefore, the nurse, sister. Everybody called her Shustra Hela. Polish, shustra means sister.\nShe knew Dr. Bimko quite a lot from the camp and they were apparently saving a lot of\nchildren in Bergen-Belsen camp during the war. And Dr. Bimko was very helpful in\nsecuring things that the children needed. Hela was in -- in the orphanage all the time and\nalso trying to help out. Dr. Bimko did not reside there, I don\u2019t think so, but she was in\ndifferent committees to help.",
        "Q: Do you have any strong memories of her, of things she did?",
        "A: Not really. I remember that she got married in the camp, to ros -- Mr. Rosen -- Mr.\nRosenzaft. Was his name Joseph? I don\u2019t remember -- Yosela, I don\u2019t know. I can\u2019t\nremember his first name. I used to -- to know it, because it went together in my mind, but\nsomething happened to my mind since then. She married Mr. Rosenzaft. And then I met\ntheir son. I think he was born in -- in Bergen-Belsen., Menachim Rosenzaft. Dr. Bimko,\nwell Haddassah Rosenzaft, she traveled with me to Washington, to bring me to the\nHolocaust Museum, to do the tape. It\u2019s -- Actually, she contacted me and she made all the\narrangements for travel. And we flew together, there and back, so we could talk a little.\nAnd then we were 1n touch on the phone. And then, one day I went to visit Hela in\nFlorida and she told me that Dr. Bim -- Dr. Haddassah Rosenzaft passed away.",
        "Q: Had either of the two of them, over the years, mentioned Anne Frank? I\u2019m wondering\nif they knew her at Bergen-Belsen.",
        "A: No, no, I don\u2019t think so. I don\u2019t think I knew that name at all. I think Anne Frank\ncame from a different country, she went to different camp, that we -- the people from our\narea did not go to. So, I don\u2019t remember hearing anything about Anne Frank.",
        "Q: Okay. So you\u2019ve now left Bergen-Belsen, you\u2019ve gone to another orphanage in\nGermany.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And then -- How is it -- Did you decide where you wanted to go? Did you know\nwhere you wanted to go?",
        "A: Well, actually, the whole group was talking. We had some people from Israel come.\nWe had even from the Jewish brigade, that joined the British army, they were stationed\nsomewhere in Holland, I think. And they send us gifts for Hanukah, with letters. Each\none wrote a letter to the kids and another roommate of mine got a letter in her package\nand she did not want to respond. She gave it to me and I responded. Developed great\nfriendship with a young man. As a matter of fact, I visited him, too, and his family.",
        "Q: In Israel?",
        "A: Yeah. First through the mails, and then, when I was in Israel and he was discharged\nfrom the for-forces, he came to visit, so we could meet in person. Also, some other\nmembers of the Jewish brigade came to teach us. They formed a school. They taught us\nEnglish, math, whatever we could, whatever they could teach us and give us and do for\nus, they did.",
        "Q: Where was this?",
        "A: That was -- It started in Bergen-Belsen, and it continued in -- in Blankanasa. And then\nlater on, when we were in Israel, we stayed in touch with them. The tape I mentioned\nbefore, of the reunion, has one of them giving a terrific speech.",
        "Q: Hm.",
        "A: Couldn\u2019t recognize him, because he\u2019s all gray and when we went to visit Hela, she\nhad copies of the same pictures that I had and I showed my son and daughter-in-law this -\n- this particular soldier -- he taught us I think, math. No, he did not teach us math. For\nmath, there was a Mr. Kaplan, Shopdike Kaplan. He taught us math. This particular one,\nAlleeyahu Benyuhuda, I don\u2019t remember was -- what he was teaching us, but there were\nclasses and there was another one, Mr. Schwartz, Aria Schwartz, from the Jewish\nbrigade. We kept in touch with them all these years. They came to reunions. And the\nreunions happened every five years now. I don\u2019t know if there is another planned,\nbecause we\u2019re getting old. We\u2019re getting old.",
        "Q: Well, how -- how was it decided then, that you would go to Israel from the camps\n[indecipherable]",
        "A: Well, since we were in a group, and we had all the influence of the Jewish brigade, we\nalso had visits from Golda Meir. We had a visit from Ben -- Ben-Gurion, who came to\ntalk to us. There was no doubt about it and no question about it, that that\u2019s -- we\u2019re going\nto go.",
        "Q: Tell me about those visits. Where was this and what -- tell me about that.",
        "A: Well, the visits happen in -- in Bergen-Belsen, and of course Ben-Gurion came to talk\nto us in Yiddish. He talked to all the survivors and of course, we were there to hear his\nspeech. So, 1-it -- 1t was very, very -- how to say -- it was ins-inspirational. And, after\nbeing treated so well, and taught -- we were taught the alphabet or Hebrew, there was no\ndoubt about it, there were a few people who -- who didn\u2019t -- there were maybe a few\npeople who didn\u2019t want to go or had found relatives, I don\u2019t know, but the whole group --\nit was decided for us and nobody objected.",
        "Q: Tell me more about that speech. Do you remember what he said, or how -- what --\nwhat were you thinking when you -- did you know who he was?",
        "A: I didn\u2019t, originally. Originally, I didn\u2019t know. And the speech was mainly about --\nabout Jews having a country. And that -- that we\u2019re this -- he came to greet the survivors,\ninvite us to build -- to build Palestine -- it was Palestine at that time, and 1t was mainly an\ninvitation to come and help them build. This was before the state was born.",
        "Q: Do you remember what you were feeling when you heard this?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember, really, how I felt about it. I thought it was a good vibration, it was\nsomething that, oh yes, let\u2019s go and do it. Something like that. Although, all the time, in\nthe back of my head was to go to Warsaw and find family and then maybe go together\nwith the family. I was not -- I was undecided, really. But it didn\u2019t matter. This -- There\nwas freedom, there was enough food, there was what to wear and nobody chased me.\nAnd that was good enough.",
        "Q: Where did -- Did Golda Meir come to Bergen-Belsen as well? What was the --",
        "A: Golda Meir came to Bergen-Belsen too, yes.",
        "Q: Together?",
        "A: No, no, at different occasions. But I hadn\u2019t heard her speech. Sometimes, when --\nwhen things got a little organized, they were having -- they formed commissions and --\nand different organizations and they had everything indoors, and it became not as\noutdoorsy as at the beginning. Maybe the weather also interfered, I don\u2019t know. But later\non, we could -- we knew that somebody was in town, but not necessarily -- we were not\nnecessarily invited.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. But you did hear him?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. I heard -- he spoke in Yiddish, I could understand it, but this was not my\nlanguage.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: But I could understand what -- the gist of it. Years later, I found out that I can speak\nYiddish, too, which I never tried before, I never knew I could. But I could understand\nbecause my mother and grandmother, whenever they didn\u2019t want me to understand\nsomething, that\u2019s how they spoke. So, maybe that\u2019s why I -- I could understand. Later on\n-- years, years later, I found out that I could speak it too. I tried and it went.",
        "Q: Were you concerned that you\u2019re going to Palestine or Israel meant, in some sense, that\nyou were giving up on finding your family?",
        "A: Oh no. No, because you could find people wherever you are. You could write letters,\nyou could teleph -- well, telephones were not that popular at that time, but you could\nalways write and there were always people who traveled and they\u2019re helpful. They want\nto help you. So, you could ask somebody to place an ad in the paper or I could write to\nWarsaw, whether I am in Israel or in Germany. So, no, I was not fearful.",
        "Q: Okay. And how did you get to Israel?",
        "A: Oh, we -- we got to Israel in a -- 1n a great big, old ship, by the name of Champalion,\nwhich afterwards sank. Yeah, we went from Marseilles to Haifa and the ship was packed\nwith people, there was no place to lie down or sit down, just to stand up, almost. The trip\nwas not very comfortable, but we were moving across the at -- the sea, the\nMediterranean, towards Israel and we got there and the British put us in a camp again, in\nAtleet, there was a camp. But we were 1n -- not too long there, and we were assigned our\ndestination and we went to -- my group went to Kayata Navim, which is not far from\nJerusalem.",
        "Q: Had you ever seen water like that before? Had you ever been to the sea before?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so, no. I don\u2019t think so. I have hardly traveled -- when I was a child, I\nhardly traveled out of Warsaw, just for summertime. My parents used to rent a place\noutside of town, which was reachable within an hour, so that my parents could come out\nfor the weekend to be with us. And that was the extent of travel I did before the war.",
        "Q: Do you remember any impression once you were on the Mediterranean of seeing what\nyou were seeing, or seeing Israel for the first time?",
        "A: If I was lucky, I could see it, because there were so many people around, you can\u2019t\neven see out. Th-Th-The boat -- The ship was really full, because among us who -- who\nhad legal papers, there were many more who were just smuggling through. So that\u2019s why\nthe ship was so packed.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. And there were how many of you together, the group that you were with?",
        "A: Well, we were 80 in our group from the -- from the orphanage.",
        "Q: And tell me about your impressions when you first arrived in Israel. What do you\nremember?",
        "A: I remember being in -- in Atleet, in the camp, the British camp and it was terribly hot.\nWas very hot and I did not have a lot of clothes to wear, ex -- but I did have a little coat.\nAnd it was too hot with the coat and I couldn\u2019t take it off, because what I was wearing\nunderneath was -- wasn\u2019t good. So I remember that, suffering from the heat. But, as I\nsaid, we did not stay there long, because of the fact that we were children and we came\nlegally, we were assigned our respective places quite quickly.",
        "Q: And do you remember what -- when this was that you came to Israel, what the date\nwould have been?",
        "A: I have -- I have a document there that tells the day -- with a picture, you should see\nthat picture. I think it was April, \u201846, 1f I\u2019m not mistaken.",
        "Q: So you\u2019re 16?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Okay. And where were you sent? What -- What did you do?",
        "A: We were -- We were sent to Kayata Navim, and there was a program that the Jewish\nagency had -- the program was deyuse aleeya. And within that program, they send us to\nKayata Navim, where we were supposed to work a half a day and study a half a day, and\nthat\u2019s what we did.",
        "Q: Is this a kibbutz?",
        "A: It\u2019s really a kwootsa, but everybody called it a kibbutz, but it was kwootsa.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. And what were your impressions? Was it a -- did you like being there? Was\nit hard work? What -- Tell me.",
        "A: No, it was not hard work, and if it was, it was the -- the -- the feeling of doing\nsomething, accomplishing and -- and being proud of it, so whatever assignment we got, it\nwas fine. We were taught a -- a lot of stuff. We were treated well, we were given clean\nrooms, with clean beds, with clothes to wear, with food to eat. We were treated well, just\n-- some people talked to us Yiddish. They assumed that everybody knows it. And\nsometimes it was hard on me. So, we had to study Hebrew quite quickly, to be able to\ncommunicate. And we worked and we studied.",
        "Q: What had happened to Peppy at this time? Were you still in touch with her?",
        "A: I was in touch -- She was in touch with me, actually. She -- At that time, when I came\nto Israel, well, let me tell you what happened before. In the train from Hanover -- from\nHamburg to Marseilles, we were on the border of France, I think, when my roommate\nheard somebody calling out my name as the train was stopping. And sure enough, it was\nPeppy. Peppy was on that train and she was running alongside to -- to find where I was.\nSo, I saw her and she was traveling with some people from the UNRRA and from the\nJoint -- AJDC, American Joint Distribution Committee, and she was traveling with them\nto accompany the -- all the people who go to Israel. And she told me that she\u2019Il see me as\nsoon as we are in Marseilles, which really did happen. So she saw me off to the -- to the\nship. She also gave me a name and address of her husband\u2019s nephew, who was supposed\nto live in Israel. There was also a gentleman from America, who was in the armed forces,\nwho accompanied our group on the ship. And Peppy was going back to France, to Paris.\nApparently she -- she was involved in rescuing some children from different countries or\nfrom different places -- rescuing Jewish children. And she was going back to France, to --\nto Paris from Marseilles. This gentleman, who was in the armed forces, the American\none, David Eisenberg, a redhead -- I remember him so well. He accompanied the -- the\nship, with the children. And we got to Israel and after we settled in Kayata Navim, he\ncame to visit. And I asked him to help me find my uncle. I knew I had an uncle there, my\nmother\u2019s brother. And I asked him to help me to find Peppy\u2019s husband\u2019s nephew. Well,\nhe found the nephew very quickly. I called him, told him where Peppy is and then I\ndidn\u2019t hear from him any more. This David Eisenberg, he traveled with me to find my\nuncle. And we traveled quite awhile, we traced him down, oh yeah. I remember that he\nlived somewhere in Rananna. We went to Rananna, he wasn\u2019t there. We went to the post\noffice, we inquired, we asked. Somebody walked in and knew -- and knew my uncle\u2019s\nwife\u2019s sister lived in Rananna. We went there and they told us where my uncle was, in\nHaifa. So David Eisenberg really helped me a lot, finding people. Well, coming back to\nPeppy. When I found the nephew and -- actually, David found the nephew and he was\ninformed where Peppy was, apparently he got in touch with Peppy and told her that her\nhusband is alive. He was in Russia somewhere and he survived, and that he came back to\nPoland. So Peppy went there to see him, yeah.",
        "Q: So at this point you had found one uncle?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And did you stay in Israel? What happened next?",
        "A: Well, I stayed in kibbutz, yes. I went to visit with my uncle and aunt and their two\nchildren. One was jumping around in his playpen and the other one was outdoors, so they\nmust have been like a year and a half, or -- and the other one, maybe six, seven. Little\nkids. I just saw the -- the one that was older, 1s a grandfather, yeah. Anyway, that -- time\nflies unbelievably fast.",
        "Q: How was that, to find that you had some family?",
        "A: Well, it was great. And my uncle Aram, he spoke to me Yiddish, too. And he likes to\nspeak Yiddish or Hebrew. He knew I don\u2019t speak Hebrew, so he spoke to me Yiddish.\nAnd I tried to do my best, so I replied, because I took some lessons in German and I\ncould speak at that time, German. And he laughed at me, that I don\u2019t speak well Yiddish.\nSo I said, \u201cLet\u2019s speak Polish.\u201d He said, \u201cNah.\u201d And it was very, very nice. And the\nsecond time I went to visit with him, which must have been a holiday, he told me that he\ngot the letter from his sister, my aunt. The one I hid under the -- the window in -- 1n that\nroom with her little boy. That she survived and her husband was in Russia and she found\nhim, too, cause he returned to Poland with the Russian army. And that they were hoping\nto find their son, the little boy. Which they found. So that\u2019s what I learned from my\nUncle Aram. And sure enough, I wrote to them that I am around. That letter that my\nUncle Aram received, stated that my aunt thought that maybe I am alive, because she saw\nme -- So -- she saw me in -- must have been September \u201844, was the last day I saw her\nand she thought maybe I was still alive. So, I wrote her and it was -- it was quite a -- quite\na thing.",
        "Q: Did -- Y-You were in Israel in -- during the War of Independence?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Were you involved with that?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Tell me.",
        "A: Well, from -- from the time that we arrived there, we were studying, we were working\nand we were also involved in military exercise. It started as a gymnastics, as a field trips\nand it turned into throwing stones and then throwing grenades and then a little rifle --\ntarget, and little MG 34\u2019s, shooting and stuff. We were involved in exercise, war -- war\nexercise, or whatever. They taught us about it. I don\u2019t remember how often it was, but\nquite often. Boys and girls. And when the war started, we were -- we were involved in\ndoing all the services that everybody else did. And then there was the pamah that came\nand they were -- they were even having uniforms and stuff. And our group --",

        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with\nDoris Greenberg. This is tape number three, side A. You were talking about the War of\nIndependence.",
        "A: Uh-huh. Well, when the pamah came in, they had the command an-and things and\nactually, we were supposed to do whatever we were assigned to and some of our boys\nwere assigned to join an-and go to a -- how do you call that? The positions that were\nprepared -- and the girls, too. So, we were actually kind of mobilized to -- to be -- to help\nwith the pamah. And I know that some of the elders from the kibbutz were also in charge.\nSo, there must have been cooperation of forces, and we were involved in that. They\nneeded a lot of help. It was -- It was a very bad area where the war was concerned, near\nJerusalem and th-the location of our kibbutz was very vulnerable. Well, we participated\nin -- in that war and we were assigned different duties. I remember I w -- I tried to help\nout as a nurse, and when they brought the -- a wounded soldier and I was supposed to\nwash his head -- he was wounded in the head -- I was supposed to wash off from the\nblood, so that he can be treated, and -- and I kind of blacked out. I think that was the --\nthe end of my nursing career, very short-lived nursing career. And I was assigned then to\ncommunications. That lasted. So I was involved in communications. We also went on\npatrols, night patrols, day patrols and whatever needed to be done, we did participate.\nHowever, I understand that we were not sent out of the area. We were only 1n that area,\nbecause I remembered when a different group of pamah came in. One group moved and\none group came in. But we were on the left, where we were. So we\u2019re actually under their\norders when they were there, but would -- we were in the -- in Kayata Navim for the\ndefense of the place. So we lasted there quite a bit. And you know the outcome.",
        "Q: How do you think your -- your past experience as a Holocaust survivor affected how\nyou viewed that war? Did that -- Did the two come into connection at some point in your\nmind?",
        "A: Sometimes, but not very often. Don\u2019t forget that at this age, you don\u2019t think much\nabout comparing things. But sometimes a thought came to mind, like why doesn\u2019t\nanybody like us? What is it that we have done to the world? The Germans don\u2019t like us.\nThe Arabs don\u2019 t like us. I was not a good politician, I never was, I never will be. I just\nsee things from the point of view of -- of being human, being a person. So my concern\nsometimes was, why don\u2019t they like us? What have we done to be so disliked? And I\ncouldn\u2019t figure.",
        "Q: How -- Tell me about how you met your husband.",
        "A: Oh. Well, I -- I went to visit my uncle, eventually, after the war.",
        "Q: Which uncle is this?",
        "A: My Uncle Philip in London, in England. I went to visit and I stayed there for about a\nyear or so, came back -- I came back to Israel and I stayed with my Aunt Esther -- the one\nthat survived -- her husband Shalom and their little boy, Yakov. I stayed with them in\nAko and there was their cousin -- my Uncle Shalom\u2019s cousin, I think and his wife, who\nhad the little place also in Ako, but it was not in the town, it was kind of out of town,\nwhere the government built places to live. Actually it was like a barrack or some, but it --\nit was -- people have a little room, kitchen, share a toilet with a next door neighbor, and a\nshower. These cousins, they lived there and we used to see each other once a week or so.\nAt one time, I had a little dispute with my aunt and uncle and decided to leave, and of\ncourse, where did I go, I went to the cousins. They invited me to stay. So I went there and\nthose cousin -- in the same place where they lived, lived my husband, and they\nintroduced us. So, we met, we went out a few times and I don\u2019t know, we -- we -- we\nwere dating for about two years before we were married.",
        "Q: And you were married in what year?",
        "A: 1952.",
        "Q: \u201852. Did you talk with him about your experiences during the war, as a survivor? Was\nhe also a survivor, or was h -- no.",
        "A: No. He had a good time. He -- He lived in China, in Shanghai. And anytime -- if I met\n-- if I met a friend who was a survivor or I talked to my friend as a survivor, he just\ncouldn\u2019t understand. Say, \u201cOh, what a terrible thing, what a -- we knew about it, but\nmuch later,\u201d he says. And I said, \u201cWhat have you done during that time?\u201d He says, \u201cI had\na good time. Went to cabaret, nightclub, theater, lived it up.\u201d",
        "Q: So, he couldn\u2019t understand really, what you\u2019d been through.",
        "A: This I don\u2019t know. This I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: But he had different past. His childhood and youth were different from mine.",
        "Q: Was it -- When you got to know each other, was it a problem that you had had such a\ndifferent recent past?",
        "A: It was not a problem for me, I don\u2019t think so. As a matter of fact, I thought it would --\nit was very nice to listen to good stuff. It was not as depressing as to listen to the bad\nstuff, so it was okay.",
        "Q: So you married in \u201852 and at some point you came to the United States. How did that\nhappen?",
        "A: Well, my husband\u2019s parents came to the United States from -- from China and they\nalso had a daughter in the United States, my husband\u2019s sister. And they wanted to have\nboth children near them. I asked my husband to write them and invite them to come to\nIsrael, but a letter came back in which they said, \u201cIf we come here, we still have one child\nsomewhere else.\u201d So we decided to go. At that time, the parents wrote to -- to him about\ncoming to America and -- and settling down and having his parents nearby and -- and I\nthought that if my parents lived anywhere, I would go there. And, of course, I wanted to\nbe good, enjoy parents. So we wen -- we went.",
        "Q: And when did you come -- when did you come and where did you enter? Do you\nremember what --",
        "A: W-We came here, I think it was November of \u201855. November of \u201855 and we went to\nmy in-laws house. They had a pretty large apartment in Manhattan, on 79th Street. And\nthey gave us a bedroom with a bath and it was very, very beautiful, very beautiful.",
        "Q: Did you come on a boat?",
        "A: No, we flew.",
        "Q: You flew?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Do you remember what your -- what your feelings were about coming to America,\nleaving Israel, coming this far?",
        "A: I really didn\u2019t feel great about it, no. I wanted to stay in Israel. The family I had,\nwhatever it was, it was family, friends, and I thought I wanted to stay in Israel. But I also\nthought that, as I said, if I had parents in Siberia, I would try and get there. So -- So we\nwent.",
        "Q: And you had one son at this point, with you?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. He was born there. He was about a year and a half, or a year and three\nmonths, that -- when -- when we took him in.",
        "Q: Did -- Did your husband or you begin working in New York, did you stay in New\nYork? What happened?",
        "A: Oh, we -- we came in -- we came -- end of November. In December I had a job.",
        "Q: Doing what?",
        "A: Assistant -- Assistant to the bookkeeper.",
        "Q: Of what -- of --",
        "A: There was a factor -- an office, Dunmore. This was an office of a manufacturer of\nboy\u2019s wear. And th-they had a bookkeeper who was actually an office manager. She --\nThe books -- She had -- She -- A lot of people that worked there and did the payroll and\nstuff. So, I was her assistant.",
        "Q: And your husband?",
        "A: He -- He tried to get all kinds of jobs as a salesman. Actually, he used to deal in furs,\nin Shanghai. He\u2019s -- He tried to get into the fur business here, but he found it impossible,\nalmost. So, he tried other jobs, a salesman, he sold eyeglasses for awhile. He also -- He\nalso went -- in order to get som -- to earn some money, he went to the funeral parlors to\nbe a night watchman. Slowly, he developed all kinds of theories and tried all kinds of\nthings to make a better living. I was working all the time. I was lucky that my mother-in-\nlaw took care of the baby. I could leave the baby at home and go to work. And that was\npretty -- a great help.",
        "Q: And you had a second child. How -- When was that?",
        "A: He was born in 1959, in Mount Sinai Hospital, in New York. And by that time, we\nmoved out from my in-law\u2019s place and we had an apartment on Riverside Drive. And my\nHank, my bigger boy, went to -- well, he started with the nursery, then he went to school,\nwent to Hebrew school. And when -- when my younger son was born, Sid, Hank was\nfive, so he was going -- he was going at that time, I think, to the nursery school. And I\ntook some time off from work and then later on, hired a babysitter so I could go back to\nwork.",
        "Q: During this time when you were here in New York, did you talk about your war\nexperience?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Did you seek out any other survivors?",
        "A: No, did not talk about it, did not seek out anybody. I was quite busy with work and\nfamily. The only thing that I did do, was, soon as I heard from this organization, Bugrow,\nI joined them in hope of -- of finding somebody that I know or that kn-knew my people.\nSo I used to go with my husband to their meetings. But that was about the only thing.",
        "Q: And he would go with you?",
        "A: Oh yeah. Very sociable fellow, likes company.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. As your children got older, enough to understand the war, did you talk to\nthem about what you had gone through? Were they curious about it?",
        "A: Yes, my older son, he gave me an assignment to write my memoirs, of which I wrote\nfive pages. And that\u2019s it. He would -- 1s very curious. Always asks questions. Even when\nwe went now to visit my old friends, he wanted to know more, and his wife, too. She\u2019s a\njournalist, so 1-it was for her also something probably interesting to hear. The younger\nson, he would ask a question or two. I think that -- that he was not up to it yet. There --\nThere has to be a time in one\u2019s life when one becomes to -- becomes -- comes to a point\nwhere he needs other information -- more information or where he wants to know\ndifferent things. It 1s -- probably happens to everybody. He would ask some questions,\nbut he was not as persistent. My Hank tells me quite often and he\u2019s persistent -- maybe\nalso different character, different types of people. He could have wanted me to do that,\nbut did not want to press on me. I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: And with your husband, was he curious?",
        "A: Not in particular, no. I think that he -- he was satisfied with what he knew and what he\nread and what he heard from other people, and from me sometimes.",
        "Q: I\u2019m wondering how he reacted to that. I mean, did you feel like you had enough\nchance to talk about it, or did you feel you didn\u2019t need to talk about 1t so much?",
        "A: Well, I wasn\u2019t looking for chances to talk. As matter of fact -- and right after the war,\nfor quite a few years, I couldn\u2019t talk about it. I remember when I was in England and my\naunt and uncle wanted to talk, I couldn\u2019t. It was very hard. It took quite some time to be\nable to talk about it. It -- The whole thing, it was such a humiliating experience, to be\nchased, to be -- to be at the target of somebody who wants to kill you because why? And\nthe way we were treated by the Germans, it was so humiliating. This wa -- This was\nprobably what they wanted to do, so that we can forget that we\u2019re human beings. It was\nvery humiliating. It was very tough to -- to reverse that, to say well, it is not what\nanybody else thinks, we are people, we have feelings, we\u2019re -- if -- we\u2019re not better, but\njust as good at least, as anybody else. Took a long time to -- to get back to what I call, to\nnormal. Maybe that\u2019s the reason that I can recognize survivors. There is something that\ntells us, oh, we\u2019re all right. We\u2019re okay. We\u2019re not what the Nazis told -- told the world\nthat we are. We\u2019re a people and some of us are -- are really nice. And then, when you\nthink about it and you read about it, we have given the world quite a few good things. So,\nI don\u2019t think anybody should hate us, but that\u2019s my opinion. That\u2019s my opinion.",
        "Q: Do you think your experience as a survivor, especially the notion that you had to hide\nwho you were for so long, affected how you raised your kids, do you think?",
        "A: Yes, I think it did.",
        "Q: How so\u201d?",
        "A: I raised my kids to like everybody, to begin with, and treat everybody very, very well.\nAnd -- And they ask, \u201cNo matter what?\u201d Well, it\u2019s not no matter what. If they don\u2019t treat\nyou well, you can find out why or you can not communicate with these people any more.\nBut you, as my child, your approach should be to everybody, treat them the same and\ntreat them well. I think I did the right thing by telling them that. I even look back and I\nsee -- you saw now my friend that came in to -- to -- to do the air conditioning\n[indecipherable]? This person, I don\u2019t think I have anything in common with that person,\nand yet, he\u2019s my friend. I have quite a few friends with whom I have nothing in common,\nnot in the past and not in the present. But I met them and they\u2019re nice people and I like\nthem and they like me and we\u2019re friends. I find this to be the right thing for me. It always\n-- It is sa-said, you have to choose your friends. That\u2019s true. You don\u2019t become close\nfriends with just anybody, but you -- there is a difference between friends and -- and --\nand acquaintances. Your acquaintances can be very friendly and if you treat them the\nsame and they treat you, that\u2019s what I find. I have a lot of -- not a lot, some different --\nsome -- different friends who -- with whom I have nothing in common, and yet we\u2019re\nfriendly. And we see each other and we discuss things. I\u2019m glad to learn their point of\nview and hear what they have to say. And I have nothing but the best wishes for them.",
        "Q: I\u2019m curious too, since you lost your parents when you were so young, you were, I\nguess, 12. You didn\u2019t know what it was like to be an adult with parents. I wonder if that\naffected your parenting and the way you\u2019ve raised your children?",
        "A: I can\u2019t tell that. I think you have to ask my son. But, very often, when I hear or read\nabout people who have difficulties communicating with their mothers, usually mothers\nand daughters have problems. I can\u2019t understand that. I simply cannot understand that\nand I cannot see why that would happen. Well, maybe there is a reason, but I don\u2019t know\nit.",
        "Q: Why is that, do you think? The -- The -- That that\u2019s your reaction?",
        "A: I really don\u2019t know, but if I were to speculate, I would think that maybe the both\nparties want to -- to impose their views on the other party, whether it\u2019s mothers and\ndaughters or vice versa. I find it possible to express my views to my son and not impose\non it. He should know my views. If I wouldn\u2019t tell him, it wouldn\u2019t be fair. He should\nknow his mother just like I would like to know him. He would know my views, but I\ndon\u2019t impose. Maybe those people try to impose those views, one upon the other. I don\u2019t\nknow, but that\u2019s how I would speculate it is.",
        "Q: You mentioned that you -- I believe you had gone back to Warsaw for the 50th\nanniversary, tell me about that.",
        "A: Yes. My son Hank -- that was the same year that the museum was opened and I\nreceived and invitation as one of the, I don\u2019t know, not founders, but people who gave\ntheir -- their life stories or whatever and I was supposed to go to Washington, DC for that\nopening. But my son suggested that since the whole thing is happening in Warsaw, we\nshould go there, so we did.",
        "Q: This was -- What was it exactly that was going on?",
        "A: It was the 50th anniversary of the ghetto Warsaw. And, I still have an uncle in\nWarsaw. I saw him, too.",
        "Q: So tell me about that, you went with your son and anyone else?",
        "A: No, just with my son. We booked a one week tour of the -- of the camps and the\nimportant places during the co -- Holocaust. So we were driven by bus and we had a ga --\na tour guide and we visited the camps and this was for one week. And the second week,\nwe spend two days with my uncle and then we went back to Krakow to look around\nourselves for things that we didn\u2019t have a chance to -- to see enough or we wanted to\nrevisit. And we saw a lot of stuff. We also, one day, went back -- he wanted to know\nwhere I was born and where I lived and my side of the family, because some years back,\nhe went to China to see where his father grew up. So this time he wanted to see about me,\nSO we went, we took some pictures in front of the house and we walked around, we saw\nwhere it was and then we went -- I explained to him a few things that I remembered. He\nwas very impressed. My uncle took us to an Israeli restaurant in Warsaw, which was --\nby which I was very impressed. And I recalled a few things that happened and where it\nhappened. I think my son was very impressed wi-with -- with things that he heard about\nand now he saw, but he was -- he was so upset when we went to the camps. Couldn\u2019t --\nCouldn\u2019t tear him away from looking at those shoes and those glasses and -- and things\nhe -- he was -- he was really upset. And then we had some experience with the modern\nanti-Semitic behavior.",
        "Q: Let me just [indecipherable] tape for a second. Actually no, I think we\u2019re okay. Wh-\nWh-What experience was that?",
        "A: Well, there were still signs on some buildings and especially in the -- in the -- where\nthe train goes, on the sides, there were walls and there were still signs there that said,\n\u2018Out with the Jews\u2019. You know, derogatory statements for the Jews. There -- There are\nstill people who speak badly about us, and when I\u2019d experienced that a little bit. So, on\nthe other hand, they cook very delicious food, very rich and delicious food and they have\nsome nice things. But the ghetto Warsaw is non-existent. And when we tried to see --\nEnd of Tape Three, Side A\nBeginning Tape Three, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with\nDoris Greenberg. This it tape number three, side B. How -- How did you respond when\nyou saw that graffiti, that -- in the place where you had grown up and seen so much pain?",
        "A: Well, I had -- I had no one to respond to. I just felt that it\u2019s insulting, it still exists and\nit\u2019s bad. And nowadays we hear even more about it, of what is going on in Russia and in\nother countries. It\u2019s very upsetting and I cannot respond to that. I wish it was nonexistent.",
        "Q: And it was upsetting for your son, you said?",
        "A: Very much, very much.",
        "Q: Did you go back to Ravensbrick, was that one of the camps that you visited?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: No. We went to Majdanek, to Treblinka, to Auschwitz-Birkenau.",
        "Q: Was it an emotional thing for you to be back in Warsaw, to be back?",
        "A: It was. It was emotional f-for s-several reasons. To begin with, it\u2019s the place that you\nthought you know. And all of a sudden, I find that I couldn\u2019t recognize everything.\nMainly the things that were rebuilt and of course, they could have been rebuilt a little\ndifferently. But, also, I couldn\u2019t recognize -- I thought there was a street somewhere and\nthen you go there, no, that there was no street, there is just a block. In other words, the\nmemory plays a little trick. And I was upset about that. On the other hand, there were\nsome things that I remembered and I told my son, \u201cWhen we\u2019ll go around the corner,\nwe'll see steps mai --\u201d At that time they were made of stone, I think. But they go all the\nway down to the -- to the river. And he looks at me, we take a walk. Just around the\ncorner, here are the steps, only they are made of wood and they are much nicer now. So,\nit brought back -- it brought back my -- my self confidence. We had -- he -- his birthday\nwas while we were there, so we went to a very fancy restaurant and we were much\nimpressed with -- with the restaurant and with the food they served and with the service\nthey had. So that was one nice thing about it. But, when we went to another place, we\nfound some -- some anti-Semitism exists, yeah. Which was not that great, and I wish it\nwould go away.",
        "Q: Is that also something you\u2019ve confronted here in the United States, ever?",
        "A: I did not confront it here as openly as in Europe, no.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. And when you confronted it there, it was in the graffiti that you saw or was\nthere anything else?",
        "A: There was graffiti, there was also -- some expressions exist that people use. I know\nthat there are some expressions in America, too, but I didn\u2019t hear them -- I didn\u2019t hear\nthem being used. Over there, I s -- I heard them being used a lot and it seems to be kind\nof degrading. Why don\u2019t they get rid of those expressions? There -- There are very few\nJews now in Poland, very few, and mainly they are old and they are there because they\nhave no place to go. I wonder why the people are so angry with us. There are no Jews\nthere for 50 years. What could we do -- what we could have done to make those people\nstill angry with us? A-And they are still using some expressions, they probably inherited\nthem. Maybe they -- I don\u2019t know if they stop to think, but they should.",
        "Q: I want to ask you finally just to -- 1f you wa -- can give me some sense of how your\nexperience during the war has shaped your life now. What do you think the most long\nlasting effect of that has been?",
        "A: I think that -- that I have become a milder person, a more understanding person of\nothers. And if somebody is persecuted or singled out, for anything for the bad, I -- I really\nfeel for them and I wish it would go away. Of course, when I say singled out, I don\u2019t\nmean people who are lawless. I\u2019m talking about the political things that are happening.\nFor politics people get killed and mistreated. I simply wish it would go away, because it -\n- it isn\u2019t worth it. Life is so short and when you treat people nice, you treat everybody\nnice and everybody treats you nice, isn\u2019t that a world we want to live in? To help one\nanother, rather than to fight. I see no good reason to -- to have any wars. I may be very,\nvery stupid, I see no reasons for it, or -- we\u2019re talking now about -- about preparing\nweapons of mass destruction. That is awful. Who needs that? And sometimes I think that\nhaving gone through what I have, I wish I could live in a world that is peaceful and the\nsame for my children, my son and daughter-in-law, their families. For my friends, I wish\nwe had peace, we -- everybody would really benefit from it.",
        "Q: Are there particular events, political events that have happened over the last 50 years,\nthat have really triggered a response for you?",
        "A: I cannot very well answer this, because I am very -- a very poor politician.",
        "Q: Or -- Not necessarily political, but historical events, and -- you know, there have been\nany number of things. The Civil Rights movement, the Women\u2019s movement, the\nMcCarthy era.",
        "A: I think the McCarthy era was before my time here.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Women\u2019s movement, in my mind -- in my mind, women should get paid the same if\nthey do the same work as men. Women should get jobs that they are good for, just like\nmen should get jobs that they are good for. I don\u2019t think that they should be chosen on\nthe basis of their sex, but because of what they can do on a job. That\u2019s what they should\ndo. But, I also believe that women are different from men. So, some of those movements\nthat you mention, don\u2019t fall into any category. I would pull out -- some points out of it\nand say, where work is concerned, it goes by ability, who is able to do what. Should be\ndoing th-that thing and get paid the same. When it comes to personal lives, women are\ndifferent from men, period, no matter what. And as -- as such, we have to behave as such\nand we shouldn\u2019t change our behavior. I don\u2019t like to see boys walking around in dresses\nor -- or -- or -- or girls wearing man\u2019s suits. We are -- I feel that in private life, in\npersonal life, men are men and women are women, should act as such and behave as\nsuch. That does not mean that it\u2019s a woman\u2019s job to cook the supper. If he is a better\ncook, he should do it. If he comes home earlier from work, he should do it. It is sharing,\nit 1s -- 1t is equality in where it counts. But we\u2019re -- we\u2019re not the same, we\u2019re much\ndifferent. And as they say, vive la difference. I believe in that. But I\u2019d like to get paid as\nmuch as a man if I do the work that a man does.",
        "Q: Great. I think we can stop there. I want to just give you a chance, if there was\nsomething else you wanted to add, that I didn\u2019t get to.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know of what I wanted to add, because I didn\u2019t plan on what you\u2019re going to\nask. Pll be glad to answer any questions if you have any. If I can, I will answer, be\ntruthful. But I really don\u2019t know what you would like to hear. To encapsulate 50 years in\ntwo or three hours, is very hard. And I\u2019m sure that when you leave, I will probably think,\noh why didn\u2019t I say so and so or such and such or explain this event or that. It\u2019s very\nhard, but it might happen. So, I\u2019m glad that I could answer some of what you asked and if\nyou have any more questions, Ill be glad to -- to supply my answers, however poorly\nthey may sound.",

        "Q: Was it an emotional thing for you to be back in Warsaw, to be back?",
        "Q: Is that also something you\u2019ve confronted here in the United States, ever?",
        "Q: Mm-hm. And when you confronted it there, it was in the graffiti that you saw or was\nthere anything else?",

        "Answer: My father\u2019s name was Elkanon Fochs. My mother\u2019s name was Gitl. Gitl\ntranslates to Tova. They called her in Polish Gutcha and my father was called Henry. T-\nThey had a -- a store in Warsaw, haberdashery. Also, in those days, you needed license\nfor selling tobacco or lottery tickets. My father had both and they used to sell both.",
        "A: There was no name, just -- just haberdashery store and I don\u2019t remember seeing any\nname over a particular store. Although, next door, there was my grandmother\u2019s store and\nshe had electrical appliances and her store had a name. So I -- I don\u2019t know why my\nparent\u2019s store had no name. My grandmother\u2019s store na -- store\u2019s name was Znicz. Znicz,\nZ-n-1-c-z in Poland, and that means a flare or a -- in Hebrew, mare tahmid, a light\nforever, Znicz. And that was my grandmother\u2019s store, which was next door to my\nparent\u2019s store.",
        "A: My sister was older than I, five years older.",
        "A: Her name -- the Jewish name was Malka Arahel. Malka Rachel. She was commonly\nknown at home as Mareesha.",
        "A: I can give you approximate times. A-All I remember, actually, was the seasons of the\nyear, whether it was cold or hot. My mother disappeared, I think it was 1942 and it must\nhave been July, or August, was very hot. And I understand that there was a big German\naktion in town and that\u2019s when she -- when she was caught in the street and brought to\nthe Umschlagplatz, which was the -- the railroad station, where they took all the people,\nto send them out. I found out later on that people who were caught and -- that day, were\nsent to Treblinka right away.",
        "A: Yes, 19 --",
        "A: No, later. That was later. When there were the factories, the German factories opened\nup in -- in Warsaw ghetto, there were different factories in different parts of -- of\nWarsaw. Where we lived, we went to work at the brush makers, making brushes. And my\nfather and my sister and I, we lived at the Narlefke Street. This was already maybe the\nthird or fourth time that we have moved, since we were thrown out of our own apartment\nand moved into the ghetto. My father went to work at that particular time and did not\nreturn. It seems to have been an aktion and all people from the factory were taken out. So\nhe never returned.",
        "A: It must have been a few months later. Must have been a few months later, can\u2019t\nremember the date.",
        "A: Late \u201842, I would think, yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: After my father. I-It must have been -- it must have been the end of \u201842, I think. There\nwas an aktion where the Germans came into the building and flushed out -- or at least\ntried to flush out everybody from their hiding places. And at that time, we were 1n an\napartment on -- on the street floor, just a few steps going up. And the -- We were left --\nmy aunt was left, my Aunt Esther. My grandmother was left. My Aunt Esther\u2019s little boy,\nwho was about three years old, yeah, it must have been \u201842. And my sister and I. And\nwhen we heard that the Germans are coming in, we started hiding. Now, my\ngrandmother, my aunt and her little boy, went to a little cabinet underneath the window,\nwhich was used instead of -- instead of a refrigerator. And th-the walls of the building\nwere thick, so there was enough room for those people to get in and I closed the door and\nput a chair in front of it. And my sister didn\u2019t know -- I -- we didn\u2019t know what to do. So\nwe had a folding bed that when it was folded up, it looked like a table. And she crawled\nin there and I put a -- a cover over it and then I didn\u2019t know what to do, the Germans\nwere already in, so I opened the door to the bathroom, but they looked in the bathroom,\ntoo. Then I saw on the -- at the wall -- on the wall of the bathroom, it was a ladder and on\ntop of it was a shelf. There was also a light bulb above the shelf. And I don\u2019t know how I\nwas able to, but I really went up the ladder and sat down on the shelf and unscrewed the\nbulb, making sure that no-none of my clothes hang down. By that time, I could hear the\nGermans in the hallway, coming in and my heart was banging so hard I hoped they didn\u2019t\nhear it. And that\u2019s when they found my sister, and they took her out. At that time they\ndidn\u2019t find my grandmother, my aunt or my little cousin. But they did find my sister.\nSome people told me afterwards, some neighbors, that she was shot. I cannot recall -- I\nwas in such shock, that I don\u2019t remember what I heard and what I saw. I just remembered\nthat I heard her cry and they took her out. They found her in the bed.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: Well, where my mother\u2019s concerned, we heard from her from Umschlagplatz. She\nmanaged to send word that she is there and asked [phone ringing]",
        "A: Yeah, well we got word from Umschlagplatz that my mother was there and she was\nasking for help. And my uncle, at that time, tried to -- to contact some friends who\nworked with the police -- with the Jewish police. But, before anything could happen, we\ngot word that the trains left. So, we know that she was caught there and that she was\nthere. And of course, the trains left to Treblinka, that\u2019s what we were advised. When my\nfather didn\u2019t come back, we did not hear anything, except that there was the aktion in the\nfactory and the people were taken out. And this was, oh, I would estimate maybe two\nmonths or three months after my mother, because I remember the weather was windy. I\nreally had to judge everything by the weather. I had no knowledge of dates. There was no\ncalendar to look at. And I think that I was too young or inexperienced to -- to really\nremember dates. Life there was like life of a rat that is hiding and it\u2019s constantly chased.\nAnd one does not know exactly where and when it 1s, day, night, summer, winter. This\nkind of sticks in the mind because it is -- you remember whether you were cold or -- or\nhot. But the dates -- exact dates are not known to me. Later on, when I listened to some\npeople, who were a little bit older, even three, four years older than I am, they knew\ndates. I have a friend who is 10 years my senior, she remembers every date and she has a\nterrific memory. But I don\u2019t remember the exact dates.",
        "A: Yeah, 12 and a half, something like that.",
        "A: I was in shock and I don\u2019t know if I can -- if I can assign any thoughts to that period. I\nknow that I was in shock. I know that the thought that was the most important, was\nsurvival and probably I -- probably I thought, \u201cHow can I survive without them?\u201d It was\nactually a -- a selfish feeling, probably. It\u2019s very hard to describe, I even get goosebumps\nwhen I -- when I talk about it, even now, because now I -- I miss them. For all these\nyears, I\u2019ve been missing them. But in those days, I think 1t was more of a -- of a self-\npreservation feeling. Of a, \u2018What am I going to do without them?\u2019 And that\u2019s all that\ncomes to mind. What next, how to survive.",
        "A: Very close. Very close to my parents, to my grandparent. I was the youngest\ngrandchild until my little cousin was born. I was quite spoiled as a child. Had terrific\nchildhood, very, very good. I had good school, good teachers. I had everything I needed\nor I wanted. I can\u2019t imagine anybody having a better life than I did at home. My sister\nand I, we were kind of spoiled children. But I was even more, because I was the younger\none, yeah.",
        "A: I was never sure that she was gone, because I didn\u2019t hear or see anything. And the\nefforts I tried to make would be after the war. I tried to put ads in paper. Went to agent --\nJewish agencies to look for survivor\u2019s names. I wrote to the international Red Cross. I\neven wrote to them to find out if they heard anything from my parents, because I hadn\u2019t\nseen them being killed and -- and -- and I thought that maybe miracle do happen and\npeople do survive. But everywhere I turned there was a closed door. There was -- Not a\nclosed door, but there was a \u2018no\u2019 answer.",
        "A: I was -- I started doing that when I was still in Germany. And then I went to Israel,\ntried from there. And when I came to America, tried again.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No records whatsoever, not that I could find any. There is one place, very curious. It --\nIt happened kind of in the last two or three years, that I came across a book of pictures.\nAnd those pictures were compiled by a professor from -- from California and I contacted\nhim and he said that he went to the archives in Koblins, Germany, where they have many,\nmany films taken by German soldiers during the war, and the pictures -- th-the films have\nonly dates on them, dates and places, but of course, no names of people or what th-they\ntook pictures of. And I looked through -- through this book and I found two pictures\nwhere my uncle was in it and that\u2019s when I contacted that professor and I wanted to know\nand that\u2019s what he told me. He said if I went to Koblins, the people there are very\naccommodating and I could look through any pictures I want to. But of course, I didn\u2019t\ndo that. I had a sick son, whom I lost since.",
        "A: This was the uncle who helped my escape, as well as the escape of my grandmother,\nmy aunt and her boy and his brother and the wife. He helped us all escape from the\nghetto, just as the Warsaw ghetto uprising started in \u201843.",
        "A: His Jewish name was Mordechai, but he went by the name of Mietek. Yeah.",
        "A: It seems to me that it was taken on the stage of a theater in the ghetto. There were two\nor three theaters, one of which was familiar to me because my uncle performed there.\nAnd th-the name of the theater was Azazel. And I used to go there, almost daily to watch\nthe performances of -- of the theater, I used to love it. And I used to go there every day\nafter so-called school. There was no school for us, but we had a professor who formed\nclasses in his house. And he was paid by my parent with whatever they had. Could be a\npair of socks for his children or whatever. And he formed a class. So some of us -- we\nstarted out with about eight or 10 children in the class and little by little, there were\nfewer, because they were caught, they died, or whatever. So, every day after the classes, I\nwould run over to the theater and watch the performances. So, when I saw the pictures, I\nsaw also the other actors, whom I knew, whom I met there. And I tried to even locate\nthem, but it -- it is not very easy. Although I was good at locating people -- I knew where\nto go and how to go about it, but those people I couldn\u2019t locate. So, I recognize on the\npicture the stage, and it must have been taken there. I would have loved to go there, to\nKoblins and look for more pictures and God knows whom I -- I could identify. But, at\nthat time, my younger son was very, very sick and I just -- I just couldn\u2019t do it. I went\naway somewhere for a week or 10 days, I think to Florida and -- and I was sorry I did,\nbecause he couldn\u2019t -- he couldn\u2019t really look after himself, he was very ill. And he\npassed away Friday the 13th of December, of \u201896. So this Friday -- that -- this 13th of\nDecember that\u2019s coming, will be two years that I lost him. So I didn\u2019t pursue any more\nlooking and with me getting so -- falling apart, kind of. It\u2019s -- It\u2019s tough to -- to\nconcentrate on everything.",
        "A: Yeah, he did.",
        "A: Yes, yes. It would have been in 1943, a little before or after my birthday, which 1s in\nMarch. Probably was in March, maybe in April of *43.",
        "A: Oh, that was still \u201843. When -- When we were at -- when my uncle smuggled us out of\nthe ghetto, we -- he prepared, with the help of my other uncle, his brother and -- and her -\n- and his wife, they prepared an apartment. And my aunt\u2019s brother made a double wall in\na room without a window and we could hide there. So, if anybody knocked on the door\nor anything like this, we would just crawl in and hide there until we were found out and\nof course, thrown out.",
        "A: Well, that was a year later.",
        "A: That was -- I would say more than a year later. The -- The ghetto revolt was Passover\nof \u201c43 and the Polish revolt was September of \u00b044. So, it was a year and a half later.",
        "A: Yes, I was in Warsaw. I was working as a cook\u2019s helper, in one of the suburbs that\u2019s\ncalled Jolybush. When the -- When the Polish revolt started in September, at that time,\nmy aunt was across the river, in Pragga and her little boy was on our side, in Warsaw,\ntake -- being taken care of by a Polish woman named Olga -- Ola. I remembered that day.\nI went to visit my aunt in Pragga and she knitted a sweater for her s-son. She gave me\nthat sweater -- of course, nobody knew we were Jewish -- she gave me that sweater, I\nbrought it to her son and by the time I got back to Jolybush, I heard shots. And that was\nwhen the Polish revolt started, September of *44, yeah.",
        "A: I was not terribly emotional about that. I just thought, this 1s a war. Nobody\u2019s after me,\nspecifically. This is a war, there were all kinds of rumors going on, because at -- at some\npoint, we were -- we were bombed by the Cartushas from -- from the other side of the\nriver. And they were, I think, the Russian Cartushas. And sometimes we heard airplanes\nand shooting, lot of shooting, and there were some direct hits. But it was a different\nfeeling for me. They were not chasing me because I was Jewish. It was just a war. And of\ncourse, we want to stay alive and we want to survive the war, but it was not the same as\nbeing chased because you\u2019re Jewish.\nshower, you thought that you would be gassed. And I was curious how you even would\nhave known about that.",
        "A: We have heard that in the ghetto, some time before.",
        "A: They were -- It seems that there were some people who jumped the trains and came\nback to the ghetto. And since the ghetto was very small, they -- they were tightening it all\nthe time and rumors spread all the time. There were some rumors to that effect. So, when\nwe were taken, in \u201844, as Christians, there was a thought about it, but the thought was\nimmediately countered by a feeling that this cannot happen because I\u2019m here among\nChristians and not Jews and they probably would not do that. At one time, there was a\npossibility to escape and I did not take that chance.",
        "A: The train slowed down and it was not part of the way, it was an half open wagon\nwhere they keep cattle, in a half open wagon. They -- Only later they switched to a all\nclosed. But at that time -- and it was still on Polish soil, there was a -- a way to jump out\nof -- of a train when it slowed down. But I did not take the chance.",
        "A: Well, I was with my friend, Peppy. We looked at each other and I think -- I don\u2019t\nthink we talked about it, but we both felt that this -- they are not going to kill us. And I\ndon\u2019t think I could jump or she could jump. We were not that a-athletic. So -- And it was\njust a matter of a short time when the possibility presented itself. The trains were -- were\nwatched by the German soldiers with rifles, so no, we didn\u2019t take the chance. Just like we\ndidn\u2019t take the chance to swallow the poison.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, of course. But, you were with other people who were talking and -- and\nthey never heard of dying or being gassed or anything like that. The mood was different.\nIt was like we know that we\u2019re political prisoners. We were taken as political prisoners of\nwar.",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Well, it meant to survive. I also went to see a priest. And the priest apparently was\nvery smart, because he told me that -- that religion -- God 1s for all --\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "A: Yes, I had -- I had gone to see him more than once and he was encouraging all the\ntime. Sometimes I -- I thought that he probably knows who I was. Sometimes he would --\nhe\u2019d give me some nuts and candy to take with me in my pocket. And he was very\nencouraging and very nice. Kept me going.",
        "A: Absolutely, yes. I knew very well that I\u2019m not supposed to be in church. And yet for --\nin order to survive, I had to go to church. I had to do what every -- every other person did\nupon entering the church, put the holy water or make the sign of the crest or whatever.\nYes, I felt very uncomfortable. But the thought of survival meant more than anything\nelse. And I just kept thinking, when I -- if I survive -- when I survive, I\u2019m going to be\nwho I am and not who I pretend to be. And I also know that Jewish religion tells you that\nlife -- a human life is very dear and should be preserved. People are allowed to eat on\nYom Kippur, if their life depends upon it. So, I thought that I\u2019m allowed to -- to go to\nchurch and pray, because my life depends upon it. It was -- This was my mediation in\nchurch, really.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so. I -- I think that my religion was my religion and whenever there was a\nspeech by -- by the -- by the priest, it was a good speech, but I -- I can not identify with\nJesus. I -- Iam -- I wasn\u2019t brought up that way. I couldn\u2019t identify. But, in my mind, I\nwould just substitute the word God. I was praying to God, no names, just God. And that\u2019s\nwhat made it possible for me. And this was my meditation, that I\u2019m preserving my life.\nThat\u2019s what I have to do to preserve it. Same thing with eating non-kosher food, I have to\ndo it. And that was the -- the power of survival is enormous -- is enormous. I went once\nto a course, oh, years later, here in -- in New York. Was a course of -- I think the power\nof negotiation or something like that. Was given by a very good instructor. And before\nthe course, the instructor told us to write down everything we know how to do. And\npeople were writing and writing and writing and I just wrote one word, survive. The\ninstructor was not very pleased and she wanted explanation. But that was what I thought\nmy main achievement in life, to survive. It is -- That feeling 1s terribly strong, especially\nit was for me, I -- I -- I figured fo-for everybody. And people did lot of things to survive.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: There were none, no. The only way -- because Peppy could read Yiddish and she\npointed out very discreetly, so that other people cannot see what we\u2019re looking at and she\nshowed me that there were Jewish names and I -- I don\u2019t know what else was on it, but\nthere were messages in Yiddish.",
        "A: Oh, we knew that all along. We knew that all along. We had to even be very careful\nsleeping, not to talk in our sleep. When -- Because we were not alone, we were in big\nbarracks. And if we would say one word that the people don\u2019t understand or they think\nit\u2019s Yiddish or anything like that, 1t would be bad. I thought later on, not at the time -- at\nthe time it didn\u2019t bother me, because I didn\u2019t speak Yiddish. So I -- If I dreamed, 1t would\nbe in -- in Polish. So, it didn\u2019t bother me, but I remember it did bother my friend Peppy,\nwho spoke Polish and Yiddish. And we had to watch each other, to kind of -- not to talk\nin our sleep. There\u2019s so many details when you -- when you want to hide under\nsomebody -- to be somebody else. Doesn\u2019t pay, unless your life depends on it, 1t does not\npay. It\u2019s a -- I-It\u2019s a very, very 1-involved task.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Noibrandenberg -- Noibrandenberg. That was in a forest. There were barracks dug in\nthe ground and also barracks of factories. So -- huge barracks and the factories were\noutside of the camp, but also in barracks. So, we were brought there and I remember the\nwalls were dripping with water and when -- this was wintertime, yeah. We were brought\nthere, was wintertime, right.",
        "A: 1944, right. And then they sent us out to the -- a -- a group of laborers, women\nlaborers, we laid tracks for a train. So we -- They used to march us out with SS people\nand dogs and went to -- marched to -- to the place where they wanted us to put their\nrailroad tracks. We worked for 12 hours a day and then they marched us back.",
        "A: Yeah, when I said free work, I meant that there was no camp. That you living in\nfreedom, that you can go out on the street or -- or go where and come wherever you want.\nThat it was not in a camp, not in a jail. That is what I called free. Although you were assi\n-- | was assigned to a couple who owned a store downstairs and they lived upstairs and I\nthink they were assigned a slave, me, because they had a daughter who was an SS person.\nI didn\u2019t know it at the beginning, but I was assigned to this elderly couple and they were\nquite good to me. They demanded their work and they gave me a place to sleep and some\nfood to eat. They did not hit me, they did not treat me badly, so 1t was okay, except when\ntheir daughter came to visit. They were shaking, they were very nervous, and I didn\u2019t\nknow why. Come to think of it, maybe they were afraid of her, too. And when she saw\nme, that daughter, she wanted to know if I understand a lot of German, because it\u2019s\nsimilar to Yiddish and if I can say something so that she could see that I speak Yiddish.\nMa -- I don\u2019t know whether it was my imagination or -- or it was for real, but she did a-\nask me questions and most of the time I -- I just didn\u2019t know what to say. I could say yes,\nI could say no and -- or I could gesture with my hands like maybe. And she was quite\nunnerving me. I think maybe she was doing the same to her parents. I noticed they felt\nmuch better when she left. So that\u2019s what I called free work.",
        "A: They did not announce anything. They just put you on the train and -- and got you\nthere. They didn\u2019t announce anything. In the last minute, they say, \u201cYou are going be\nhere. You are going to work here.\u201d But, in the camp, they did not announce anything.\nSaid that we\u2019re going to go out to work. We really didn\u2019t know where we were going.\nBut it turned out that -- that\u2019s where we went. And it must have been -- must have been\nwhat -- end of \u00b044, beginning of fort -- no, it was in \u201845. It was already in \u201c45, because I\nremember being there not a very long time, when we were liberated. And we\u2019re liberated\nin May of \u201845. So we must have gone to that place in \u00b045, I assume.",
        "A: Yeah, right.",
        "A: Oh, that was a miserable day for me. It was awful. I got almost killed. The Russians\ncame to town and apparently they had to fight very hard and they were very excited about\neverything. And their idea of survivors was a mistaken idea that whoever survived, must\nhave cooperated with the Germans. And out of this assumption, they almost killed us.",
        "A: We talked. They talked to me, I talked to them and I talked again and again. The\nwhole day went by talking. And for some reason, there were other soldiers that came in\nand talked to others and somehow we survived.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, oh yeah",
        "A: Oh yes, the-they -- they went into the house. They were looking for things that they\nwanted. Food, drinks, watches, bicycles, anywh -- anything. And there was a bicycle\nupstairs in the attic. It must have been the bicycle of their daughter, I don\u2019t know. But\nthey went up and they found it and they took it. They wanted me to go upstairs and --\nwith them, but I was afraid, so I didn\u2019t. And I just told them where the bicycle was. Now,\nthose people had the store with foodstuff. There was sugar, there was flour. And I don\u2019t\nknow they took anything, they must have taken some edible things that you don\u2019t have to\ncook, but they did take the bicycle and they were running around looking for things that\nthey wanted. And at -- at the same time, they were talking about the survivors who were\ncooperating with the Germans. And I kind of tried to stay away, if I could. Then another\ngroup came in and they met and they talked and they talked to me and to the -- to the\nGerman couple. They really were looking for things, maybe they took something from\nthem, their watches I suppose, I don\u2019t know. And -- And they -- Then they went the next\nhouse. So it was a very, very tough day. At the evening, after I was all alone, I decided to\ngo to Peppy.",
        "A: Oh, they stayed there, they were fine.",
        "A: Yeah, the soldiers were gone, yeah.",
        "A: My room was upstairs and there was a bed and things. And I didn\u2019t want them to -- to\ngo to my room with -- with me in it. So, I didn\u2019t want to go upstairs. And they went and\nthey got their bicycle or whatever else in the attic and there were others who -- wh --\nwhen -- when this group was upstairs, others came in, because they were coming in -- the\ntroops were coming in, pouring in. And they came and went and whoever got what. I\nsuppose they wanted to be ahead of their friends to get more stuff, I don\u2019t know. I was\nscared.",
        "A: No, except that they talked to me like that. Not all of them, but many of them would\nsay, \u201cYou'll get yours. You cooperated with the Germans.\u201d I never mentioned to\nanybody that I was Jewish. I was still afraid. So, 1-1t was tough. It was very, very scary.",
        "A: Yeah, oh yeah. I suppose they left everybody alone after they took what they wanted\nand after they had a night\u2019s sleep, when the fighting stopped. They seemed to be very\nexcited, nervous, tired, hungry. They were the -- the front line soldiers.",
        "A: Well, I did, in my head, I did. Because they -- they freed me from the Germans. So, I -\n- I felt very good towards them, but they put other thoughts -- they had other thoughts in\ntheir mind about people like myself, who survived. Maybe they were told that this is the -\n- the case. Maybe it was their own idea. I\u2019m not talking about a whole regiment of\nsoldiers, I\u2019m talking about those who came my way. And those that came my way, some\nof them -- many of them had that idea.",
        "A: It made me feel helpless. And not knowing what to do. What do I tell those people,\nno, you\u2019re wrong? And all together, your -- you\u2019re wrong assuming anything that you\nassume, because I\u2019m not really the person that you think I am. Couldn\u2019t say anything. I --\nI was really upset and -- and helpless.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Because I learned by then that nobody likes Jews. And therefore it isn\u2019t going to do\nme any good.",
        "A: They were not the enemy. They were -- They were the liberators. I wish they could\nbehave a little better than they did, but yes, I was glad to be liberated from the Germans,\nyeah. I heard later on different stories of different people who were treated very badly by\nthe Russian liberators, but I have not experienced that and I have not seen that.",
        "A: Oh, there are people who told me that they were mugged. That they were -- they were\nhit. I hadn\u2019t seen anything like that. I -- I can tell you what I saw and I\u2019m telling you what\nI heard, but I felt good to be liberated from the Germans and that was the main thing, but\nthey scared me because of their thoughts of why I was spared. Because they were\nmistaken. I did not cooperate with Germans, besides, no German wanted my cooperation.\nI -- I just rode out the waves of the war and I was glad that the war is over and maybe\nsome peace will come and -- and I -- even then I hoped that I could find some of my\nfamily. That was always, in my head. So, I -- I felt good about being liberated.",
        "A: I walked. I walked. At that time I would walk a couple -- a few miles. She was in a\nvery small place a -- that -- ba -- at a farm. Th -- She was farmed out to the farmer from\nthe camp. And it just so happened -- happened that in that farm where she was, I -- I\ncame there to -- to be with her, because I was very much afraid. And then the Russians\ndecided to be there to -- to take that farm as their headquarters in the area. So, 1-it was --\nit was an unexpected event. However, it was not bad because by that time when I went\nthere, she represented herself as my mother. So I kind of felt protection. And indeed, I\ngot a lot of protection because they knew that there is a mother and daughter, and that we\nwere Polish. So, it went much easier. And those people who came there, the Russian\nmilitary, not all of them had this idea that the survivors were cooperating. They set up\ntheir headquarters and they had Peppy work for them, interpret. And Peppy said to them\nthat she will be very glad, but to announce that her daughter is here and she is not to be\ntouched. And that\u2019s exactly what happened, so I was protected.",
        "A: We stayed there not long. Maybe some -- Maybe two months. It was still not cold out\nwhen -- it was still summer, maybe deep summer, we set out to go to Berlin.",
        "A: Oh, we talked about it, sure. And by that time we knew that in Berlin there were\narmies of all the allies and we better get there as a first stop and then see if we could go\nback to our respective homes, to hope to meet our survivors -- our family who survived.\nBut Berlin was the first stop.",
        "A: We were very far away. We had -- the farmer had a horse and the Russian found, in\nanother farmer\u2019s place, a little carriage, which they took. And what they did, they brought\nPeppy and me to the railroad station on that horse and buggy. And then we went on the --\non the train to Berlin.",
        "A: Well, we came to Berlin and we wanted to s -- and we went to the Jewish -- society or\nJewish headquarters or what do they call it here? The Jewish government kind of -- was\nin Oranyanboogerstrasser. The Yiddish Agaminda. And at that time, it -- there was some\npeople there and it was not excellently organized, but pretty good. And there was -- there\nwere some people coming and needing things and there were local people who manned\nthat -- that -- what shall I call it, club, or the Jewish -- what do they call it? The Jewish\ngovernment, if there is such a thing. Anyway, I was interviewed by one of the people\nthere and when I told him that I was Jewish, he wouldn\u2019t believe me. He thought that I\ntold him I was Jewish so that I can get a package of food, or a place to stay from the\nUNRRA.",
        "A: Yes. Which at that time -- I found out later it was bringing a lot of help, blankets and\nclothes and food to Berlin for the DP\u2019s, displaced persons. And this particular person that\ninterviewed me was under the impression that I\u2019m telling him I was Jewish so that I could\nget some of the goodies. Well, I had a problem convincing him. And he asked all kinds of\nquestion and then he asked me to recite the shmisered, the prayer. I didn\u2019t know the\nwhole thing, but I knew some of it. Although -- he asked me the names of my parents and\nI told him the Jewish name. I told him my Jewish name. I had to recite the schma, which I\ndid a poor job, but I did some. And finally, reluctantly, he thought that I was Jewish.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: Ver-Very awkward. Very awkward. I had the same comment you just did. I had to\nfight all this time to dispel from other people\u2019s minds that I might be Jewish, and here\nI\u2019m trying to tell him I am and he doesn\u2019t believe me. Very awkward.",
        "A: We found Peppy -- Peppy found actually, an apartment of a young, German lady with\na baby. Her husband, I think was a -- a prisoner of war. And she had an extra bedroom.\nSo she rented us the bedroom for some food. I don\u2019t think we paid her anything but food.\nPeppy made the arrangements, I\u2019m not sure. But she gave us that bedroom, which was\nvery nice and finally we could sleep in a -- in a bed, 1n a house, rather than all kinds of\nother bad places. So that was nice.",
        "A: Yeah. It was very, very funny, w -- because the -- the apartment, th-the room,\neverything was very nice, but I thought, \u201cOh, I\u2019m loo -- going to look around and see\nwhat it is like.\u201d Well, I fell asleep like a log, did not enjoy anything else but sleep.",
        "A: I stayed in Berlin, let\u2019s see, four, five, probably six to eight months, something like\nthat.",
        "A: Yeah.\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "A: Well, the atmosphere was chaotic. There were a lot of foreigners, many people, many\nsurvivors came. They were military of all area -- al-allied groups. And people are trying\nto find things -- find other people, find their relatives, find a place to stay, acquire some\nclothes, acquire some food. It was quite chaotic, but the allies brought in a lot of help.\nThere was one synagogue, I remember, and in that synagogue, they had brought in\nblankets and clothes and some food packages I think, I\u2019m not sure. And they were\ndistributed to -- to people who needed them. The German people were -- also were quite\ndepressed and they needed some help, too; they had no food. However, it was in a short\nperiod of time, there was -- a black market developed. Ill never forget that, it was called\nAlexanderplatz and in -- in that place, you could probably trade for everything you\nneeded. You could buy or sell or whatever. The German people would bring out their\nwares, maybe their clothes or their watches or whatever, to sell, to exchange for food.\nThe survivors were -- were looking for everything that they couldn\u2019t get from the Jewish\nagency. Oh, that\u2019s the word I was looking, the Jewish agency, not government. So, it was\na time of confusion and people, being very eager and looking for things and for people.\nSomehow, one tried to help the other. It was a very nice day and I can\u2019t remember what\nkind of a Jewi-Jewish holiday it was, it\u2019s very hard for me to tell. There was a Jewish\nholiday and Peppy invited the Jewish soldiers from the allied armies to come and\ncelebrate the Jewish holiday. And I remember they were Russians, they were Americans,\nBritish, French. I don\u2019t think there were any Polish. And whatever Peppy cou-could get\nin the way of food, she would prepare and there were candles lit and this was -- this was a\n-- a thing that will always bring tears to my eyes, because this is the first time that people\nin different uniforms of different countries, sat at the table and recited the same prayer.\nWhatever food there was, I don\u2019t remember. Probably wasn\u2019t much and probably some of\nit was that the allies brought in in cans or whatever. But the li -- the -- the candles were lit\nand all the different nations, who couldn\u2019t speak to each other because of the language\nbarrier, they could recite the same prayer. And that was something that I will always\nremember.",
        "A: No, no. I did not go to worship anyplace at that time. I just didn\u2019t know where I was,\nwhat I was doing and I was planning to -- to look for my family, if anybody -- and -- and\nI figured that if anybody survived, they\u2019Il go back home. So, I wanted to go to Warsaw\nand go to the house where we lived and see if anybody shows up. Or go to the Jewish\nagency and see if anybody registered. That was my first and only thought at that time.",
        "A: Well, I started. I was on my way in a train, from Berlin, to go to Warsaw. And in a\ntown of Dresden, the train was held up by the Russians and all the foreigners were taken\noff. I don\u2019t know if the Germans were taken off or not, but all the foreigners were taken\noff the train and hold into the jail. And the explanation given was, that the Russians are\ngoing to help us go home. Originally, I wasn\u2019t worried, well if -- if the Russians are\ngoing to help me to go home, that would be fine. That\u2019s where I was going anywhere.\nBut, as we were put in the jail cells, there were some people from Ukraine. And they told\nme that you really don\u2019t go home, they don\u2019t send you home. They send you somewhere\nin Russia, wherever they want to. I was scared. I don\u2019t want to go anywhere in Russia, I\nwanted to go to Warsaw. And the mere fact that we were locked up and not let out,\nscared me again. So this -- this person that was there told me how to escape, and I did.",
        "A: Well, you asked the guard to escort you to the bathroom. And the bathroom was on\nthe entrance, on the street level, kind of. Just a few steps. So, he escorted me to the\nbathroom and he was walking up and down the hallway, huge hallway. So, I watched\nwhen he was very far away with the back to me, and I walked out and down the stairs and\nI -- very wide stairs. On each side there were policeman. Polish -- No, not a Pole --\nGerman police and German soldier, I think. I remember the police, but there were two of\nthem on each side. And when I walked out, I walked in the middle of the stairs, head high\nand very sure of myself. And nobody said anything. I -- I looked left and right, wherever\nI saw a corner of the -- of the street, closer. I think it was to the right. I turned right and I\nwalked -- I kind of marched, until I hit the corner. When I went around the corner, I\nstarted running. And I ran very quickly. I went back to the railroad station. I had no\nmoney for a ticket, but 1t was -- I just went so quickly and I yelled something, I think in\nRussian or in Polish, when they wanted a ticket -- I didn\u2019t give them. And -- and because\nI saw the train started moving and I hopped in the train. And the train took me back to\nBerlin. It was the only train I could see there. It lucky took me to Berlin, it could have\ntaken me somewhere else. So I went back to Berlin. On the way, they stopped and they\nlooked for people again, but then I was lucky. I -- When -- When I jumped in to the train\nand I saw there were some Russian officers sitting and they showed me that I could sit\nnext to them, so I did. And that\u2019s where my Russian language kind of -- although broken,\nbut it was helpful.\nAnd they started talking to me a-and I said, \u201cI\u2019m on my way.\u201d They told me, \u201cAre you\ngoing to Berlin, too?\u201d So I said yes. I was glad to know it\u2019s Berlin. And I told them yes, I\nwas going to Berlin too, to see my relatives, who were there after the war. And we\ndeveloped a nice conversation. And when the train stopped at night and the other Russian\nsoldiers came to look for foreigners, this particular officer, who sat across this -- the\nbench from me, he said to the soldiers, \u201cGo away, it\u2019s middle of the night, we\u2019re all\nsleepy. Go away.\u201d I couldn\u2019t be happier. And the soldier went away. So I could go back -\n- otherwise, I would be caught again and brought to jail again. And I didn\u2019t know -- it --\nit scared me, the fact that -- that they put us 1n jail before they send me away, that scared\nme. I would have been glad to go home, just because I was on my way. And -- And that\u2019s\nwhy I -- I never went back to -- to Warsaw after the war. I came back to Berlin.",
        "A: More or less, yes. I felt good because I was with Peppy and she -- she really took good\ncare of me. It was not only name that -- that she was my mother, she -- she really tried her\nbest to be my mother and she behaved like one. It was a -- a great feeling to have\nsomebody watching over you. Oh, many times I gave her aggravation. Refused to do\nwhatever she said, you know, but -- but it\u2019s part of it.",
        "A: 15.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Well, we were in the same apartment in -- in that place where we had the room, a\nbedroom. And she was there, so I could go there. As a matter of fact, this officer, who sat\nacross from me, he apologized aft -- to yell -- for yelling at the soldier. And I said,\n\u201cThat\u2019s okay.\u201d He was a gentleman and -- and I told him that I was going to Berlin and\nmy mother is there and all that. And he wanted the address and I gave him. And he\nshowed up. He showed up, he came in, he -- had a very nice reception, Peppy and I. He --\nHe had tea, or whatever there was. And we had a very nice visit and he apologized again\nfor yelling at the soldier and he left. Wasn\u2019t that nice?",
        "A: Well, in Berlin, there were several ways that ja -- that one could do it. The Jewish\nagency, they had registry. People that came in from other countries, they would register\nthere that they are alive. There were also soldiers from different countries. Some of them\ntook -- I asked them to put ads in the paper. There was the international Red Cross. I tried\nto -- to reach -- to find where they are. It wasn\u2019t easy, because it was all chaotic and --\nand it was all new established and some offices there were before, were not any more.\nBut it was possible to find. And -- And I put in inquires everywhere.",
        "A: None. There is one thing that -- one thing that came out of it is that after awhile the --\nI asked a British person, who went home for vacation, to put in England an ad, because\nmy father had a brother in England with family, for many years. So, they put an ad, and\nsure enough, I found my uncle.",
        "A: My father\u2019s brother.",
        "A: Philip. And -- Philip Fox. And he -- his friend saw the ad in the paper and called him\nand within a little while -- there were some British soldiers in the area and my uncle\nknew their parents. And they wrote to them and they came to visit and I was 1n -- in the\norphanage then. They came to visit, they said their parents wrote that here I was, to find\nout how I am and if I want to go to England.",
        "A: All the time.",
        "A: I look at faces wherever I go, for 50 years or more, hoping to find a familiar face. I\njoined the [indecipherable] the Warsaw ghetto resistance organization in New York,\nbecause for awhile we lived in New York, in Manhattan. So I joined them, and every\ntime there was a meeting, I would just go there and stare at faces. I didn\u2019t find anybody.\nA friend of mine find -- found friends. The one that 1s a little older and she could\nremember better, or maybe her friends didn\u2019t change as much. I didn\u2019t find a soul that I\nknow.",
        "A: Very disappointing, and the question is here, look at me, don\u2019t you know me? It\u2019s not\nas if I am supposed to know you, because I am a child. It\u2019s that you are supposed to\nrecognize me. Without realizing that this is not possible, children change faster than\nadults. Didn\u2019t realize that. Don\u2019t -- Doesn\u2019t anybody know me? Nobody knew me. Even\nif they did know my parents, they wouldn\u2019t recognize me. I didn\u2019t know that. So this\nlooking at faces, whenever you are at a Jewish gathering, is something that I do\nautomatic, wherever I go.",
        "A: Well, to begin with, after -- after a little while, the -- Berlin was divided into zones,\ninto different zones. And there was Russian, an American, a British, a French. And they\nstarted closing in. At that time, Peppy, who was very active in helping everybody and she\ngot me involved in it, too. Like when -- when some survivors came in, she would say,\nhere is the Jewish agency and here 1s their -- the synagogue and what -- she tried to -- to\nhelp a lot of people. She got me involved in it and -- and at one time, she said to me that\nshe and some other people organized for a group of orphans to go to the British zone. But\n[ -- I have to be in that orphanage. So she registered me in that orphanage in Berlin. And\none day there was a British truck, covered truck. Came up, pick up the children from the\norphanage, including me, and they drove us off to -- to Bergen-Belsen. And that\u2019s how I\ngot to Bergen-Belsen.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: Peppy said that she will come as soon as she can. That she will come to the British so\n-- zone, as soon as she can. Becau -- She got involved in helping others so much that\npeople came to depend on her and she didn\u2019t want to let them down. So, she send me out\nand she knew where we\u2019re going, because it was arranged. And then she said that as soon\nas she can, she will come to join me.",
        "A: Well, we did not go to a place that was a camp, it was the same town, but the\norphanage was in the barracks of -- in the former barracks of the soldiers.",
        "A: Was not the camp. It was a building and it was in-indoors, it was in a nice area.",
        "A: Like a -- a barracks, but built out of brick. I even have the pictures of it.",
        "A: It felt like a temporary assignment, like a temporary thing, because it was in the back\nof my head still to go back to Warsaw to find relatives. I thought about that most of the\ntime and it felt like this is a good stop, a place to stop and wait until the opportunity\npresents itself to travel to Warsaw, to find my relatives.",
        "A: I was treated as good as could be. Everybody had to eat -- needed things and people\nmainly were survivors there. Conditions were not that great, but they were the best they\ncould be. They gave us some clothes, they gave us a place to sleep, food to eat and then --\nth-th -- there was one nurse there, I -- I just went to visit with her in Ramatgan. She was\njust fantastic, she would care about all the children. She would act like a mother to\neverybody. And that\u2019s where I met her. She apparently was liberated from the camp in\nBergen-Belsen with a group of children and when they brought us from Berlin, we were\njust additional children. And it was fine.",
        "A: Oh, her name is Hela.",
        "A: When I met her, her name was Hela Wash. Of course, now her name is Hela Yafare.\nShe was -- She is a fantastic lady. She treated us well, she was -- ca -- she cared about all\nthe children. Now, when I was in Ramatgan, and I came to visit with her. I came with my\nson and daughter-in-law and she was at home with her husband and she kept referring,\nwhenever she talked to my son and daughter-in-law, she kept referring to me as her\nchildren. She would say, you know, another one of my children, such and such, called.\nAnd -- So we were her children. And it was great to see her.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: Well, we -- we went to Israel and we were in, Kayata Navim and she came to Israel,\nshe came to visit and the whole group just loved her. And for awhile she was there and\nthen she moved to -- to Tel Aviv. And we each visited her whenever we had a day off, or\nso. We would visit and she would visit and we -- we stayed in touch.",
        "A: Oh no, girls and boys.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: In the orphanage, I don\u2019t know how many there were. But, when we went to Israel,\nout of that place, I know we were 80, a group of 80. We were divided into two groups\nand each one went to a different kibbutz, cause they had the reunion fo-for which I -- I\ngot a tape of the reunion, I wasn\u2019t there. I was there in the previous reunion, but this\nreunion I wasn\u2019t there. And they made me -- for me a -- a tape, which I brought with me,\nI saw it. And she was there at the reunion, she\u2019s there at every reunion. She\u2019s just a\nfantastic lady.",
        "A: We were at Bergen-Belsen just a couple of months -- a few months.",
        "A: And we\u2019re transferred to a -- ablankanasia, which is near Hamburg.",
        "A: There was a -- an estate, I think the Varburg estate. And they have arranged for us to\nbe there to -- to transform it into an orphanage and we were brought over there, so it was\nbeautiful, it was beautiful. And from there, we were sent to Israel, via Marseilles.",
        "A: Not really boyfriend, but developed friendship with a few people, girls as well as\nboys.",
        "A: Some people, yes. One of them brought a book, and when I got there now to Israel,\nthere was a copy of the book for me, with her writing because she couldn\u2019t come to meet\nme, she was going out of town to a seminar. So -- and I was so sick, I read the book. I\nwas surprised that I could still read Hebrew with -- without punctuation. I haven\u2019t done it\nin a long time, but slowly it came back to me and I read her book about her life. Very\ninteresting. And then I went to visit my room mate and she invited a few people from the\nsame group, who came to visit and brought pictures. So, it was nice.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so. I don\u2019t think so. The main thing was 1-if -- when you made\nacquaintance with another survivor, the main questions was -- were, which camp did you\ngo to? Which camp did you survive? If the camp was the same as that person, then they\nwould compare notes to people they knew or the -- the bad guys or what -- what it was\nlike in the camp. But, this is how people got acquainted, what camp were you in.",
        "A: We were all scarred. We were all scarred and I think that this 1s going to last a\nlifetime. I thought that I can always point out a person -- a survivor -- from any group of\npeople. I can do that, I think. Because we have a scar. We have a certain way of behavior,\na certain way of speaking or behaving that points to the fact that we\u2019re survivors. That\u2019s\nin my opinion.",
        "A: I find that we survivors have a certain way of speaking, of behaving, that I don\u2019t find\namong other people, who never went through the hell we did. That\u2019s how it seems to me.\nWe -- We can compare -- We can compare to each other, but we don\u2019t have the good\ntimes that other people talk about. There\u2019s some among us that block out the -- the\nhappenings during the war, although it was just a few years, but it left a big scar on\neverybody. And even, it -- just like in the Jewish religion, whenever there is a holiday,\nthere is an eeskar. That\u2019s the prayer for the departed. I find that whenever we have even\nthe greatest simcha, which 1s a celebration, we always remember the bad times. And I\nfind it many times in people\u2019s eyes, in their voices and behavior. I\u2019m not trying to\nanalyze, but it seems to me that I can recognize people who are survivors.",
        "A: Well, I can only speculate on that. My speculations would point out that yes, you can.\nBecause people who have such past, where they suffered a lot, they usually behave in a\nmilder way, I think. But that would be just speculation.",
        "A: Oh, yes.",
        "A: Well, Haddassah Rosenzaft, when I met her in Bergen-Belsen, her name was\nHaddassah Bimko. She is also a survivor -- was -- she passed away since. She was in the\ncamp of Bergen-Belsen, and sister the -- we call her Sister Hela, the one I spoke about\nbefore, the nurse, sister. Everybody called her Shustra Hela. Polish, shustra means sister.\nShe knew Dr. Bimko quite a lot from the camp and they were apparently saving a lot of\nchildren in Bergen-Belsen camp during the war. And Dr. Bimko was very helpful in\nsecuring things that the children needed. Hela was in -- in the orphanage all the time and\nalso trying to help out. Dr. Bimko did not reside there, I don\u2019t think so, but she was in\ndifferent committees to help.",
        "A: Not really. I remember that she got married in the camp, to ros -- Mr. Rosen -- Mr.\nRosenzaft. Was his name Joseph? I don\u2019t remember -- Yosela, I don\u2019t know. I can\u2019t\nremember his first name. I used to -- to know it, because it went together in my mind, but\nsomething happened to my mind since then. She married Mr. Rosenzaft. And then I met\ntheir son. I think he was born in -- in Bergen-Belsen., Menachim Rosenzaft. Dr. Bimko,\nwell Haddassah Rosenzaft, she traveled with me to Washington, to bring me to the\nHolocaust Museum, to do the tape. It\u2019s -- Actually, she contacted me and she made all the\narrangements for travel. And we flew together, there and back, so we could talk a little.\nAnd then we were 1n touch on the phone. And then, one day I went to visit Hela in\nFlorida and she told me that Dr. Bim -- Dr. Haddassah Rosenzaft passed away.",
        "A: No, no, I don\u2019t think so. I don\u2019t think I knew that name at all. I think Anne Frank\ncame from a different country, she went to different camp, that we -- the people from our\narea did not go to. So, I don\u2019t remember hearing anything about Anne Frank.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Well, actually, the whole group was talking. We had some people from Israel come.\nWe had even from the Jewish brigade, that joined the British army, they were stationed\nsomewhere in Holland, I think. And they send us gifts for Hanukah, with letters. Each\none wrote a letter to the kids and another roommate of mine got a letter in her package\nand she did not want to respond. She gave it to me and I responded. Developed great\nfriendship with a young man. As a matter of fact, I visited him, too, and his family.",
        "A: Yeah. First through the mails, and then, when I was in Israel and he was discharged\nfrom the for-forces, he came to visit, so we could meet in person. Also, some other\nmembers of the Jewish brigade came to teach us. They formed a school. They taught us\nEnglish, math, whatever we could, whatever they could teach us and give us and do for\nus, they did.",
        "A: That was -- It started in Bergen-Belsen, and it continued in -- in Blankanasa. And then\nlater on, when we were in Israel, we stayed in touch with them. The tape I mentioned\nbefore, of the reunion, has one of them giving a terrific speech.",
        "A: Couldn\u2019t recognize him, because he\u2019s all gray and when we went to visit Hela, she\nhad copies of the same pictures that I had and I showed my son and daughter-in-law this -\n- this particular soldier -- he taught us I think, math. No, he did not teach us math. For\nmath, there was a Mr. Kaplan, Shopdike Kaplan. He taught us math. This particular one,\nAlleeyahu Benyuhuda, I don\u2019t remember was -- what he was teaching us, but there were\nclasses and there was another one, Mr. Schwartz, Aria Schwartz, from the Jewish\nbrigade. We kept in touch with them all these years. They came to reunions. And the\nreunions happened every five years now. I don\u2019t know if there is another planned,\nbecause we\u2019re getting old. We\u2019re getting old.",
        "A: Well, since we were in a group, and we had all the influence of the Jewish brigade, we\nalso had visits from Golda Meir. We had a visit from Ben -- Ben-Gurion, who came to\ntalk to us. There was no doubt about it and no question about it, that that\u2019s -- we\u2019re going\nto go.",
        "A: Well, the visits happen in -- in Bergen-Belsen, and of course Ben-Gurion came to talk\nto us in Yiddish. He talked to all the survivors and of course, we were there to hear his\nspeech. So, 1-it -- 1t was very, very -- how to say -- it was ins-inspirational. And, after\nbeing treated so well, and taught -- we were taught the alphabet or Hebrew, there was no\ndoubt about it, there were a few people who -- who didn\u2019t -- there were maybe a few\npeople who didn\u2019t want to go or had found relatives, I don\u2019t know, but the whole group --\nit was decided for us and nobody objected.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t, originally. Originally, I didn\u2019t know. And the speech was mainly about --\nabout Jews having a country. And that -- that we\u2019re this -- he came to greet the survivors,\ninvite us to build -- to build Palestine -- it was Palestine at that time, and 1t was mainly an\ninvitation to come and help them build. This was before the state was born.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember, really, how I felt about it. I thought it was a good vibration, it was\nsomething that, oh yes, let\u2019s go and do it. Something like that. Although, all the time, in\nthe back of my head was to go to Warsaw and find family and then maybe go together\nwith the family. I was not -- I was undecided, really. But it didn\u2019t matter. This -- There\nwas freedom, there was enough food, there was what to wear and nobody chased me.\nAnd that was good enough.",
        "A: Golda Meir came to Bergen-Belsen too, yes.",
        "A: No, no, at different occasions. But I hadn\u2019t heard her speech. Sometimes, when --\nwhen things got a little organized, they were having -- they formed commissions and --\nand different organizations and they had everything indoors, and it became not as\noutdoorsy as at the beginning. Maybe the weather also interfered, I don\u2019t know. But later\non, we could -- we knew that somebody was in town, but not necessarily -- we were not\nnecessarily invited.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. I heard -- he spoke in Yiddish, I could understand it, but this was not my\nlanguage.",
        "A: But I could understand what -- the gist of it. Years later, I found out that I can speak\nYiddish, too, which I never tried before, I never knew I could. But I could understand\nbecause my mother and grandmother, whenever they didn\u2019t want me to understand\nsomething, that\u2019s how they spoke. So, maybe that\u2019s why I -- I could understand. Later on\n-- years, years later, I found out that I could speak it too. I tried and it went.",
        "A: Oh no. No, because you could find people wherever you are. You could write letters,\nyou could teleph -- well, telephones were not that popular at that time, but you could\nalways write and there were always people who traveled and they\u2019re helpful. They want\nto help you. So, you could ask somebody to place an ad in the paper or I could write to\nWarsaw, whether I am in Israel or in Germany. So, no, I was not fearful.",
        "A: Oh, we -- we got to Israel in a -- 1n a great big, old ship, by the name of Champalion,\nwhich afterwards sank. Yeah, we went from Marseilles to Haifa and the ship was packed\nwith people, there was no place to lie down or sit down, just to stand up, almost. The trip\nwas not very comfortable, but we were moving across the at -- the sea, the\nMediterranean, towards Israel and we got there and the British put us in a camp again, in\nAtleet, there was a camp. But we were 1n -- not too long there, and we were assigned our\ndestination and we went to -- my group went to Kayata Navim, which is not far from\nJerusalem.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so, no. I don\u2019t think so. I have hardly traveled -- when I was a child, I\nhardly traveled out of Warsaw, just for summertime. My parents used to rent a place\noutside of town, which was reachable within an hour, so that my parents could come out\nfor the weekend to be with us. And that was the extent of travel I did before the war.",
        "A: If I was lucky, I could see it, because there were so many people around, you can\u2019t\neven see out. Th-Th-The boat -- The ship was really full, because among us who -- who\nhad legal papers, there were many more who were just smuggling through. So that\u2019s why\nthe ship was so packed.",
        "A: Well, we were 80 in our group from the -- from the orphanage.",
        "A: I remember being in -- in Atleet, in the camp, the British camp and it was terribly hot.\nWas very hot and I did not have a lot of clothes to wear, ex -- but I did have a little coat.\nAnd it was too hot with the coat and I couldn\u2019t take it off, because what I was wearing\nunderneath was -- wasn\u2019t good. So I remember that, suffering from the heat. But, as I\nsaid, we did not stay there long, because of the fact that we were children and we came\nlegally, we were assigned our respective places quite quickly.",
        "A: I have -- I have a document there that tells the day -- with a picture, you should see\nthat picture. I think it was April, \u201846, 1f I\u2019m not mistaken.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: We were -- We were sent to Kayata Navim, and there was a program that the Jewish\nagency had -- the program was deyuse aleeya. And within that program, they send us to\nKayata Navim, where we were supposed to work a half a day and study a half a day, and\nthat\u2019s what we did.",
        "A: It\u2019s really a kwootsa, but everybody called it a kibbutz, but it was kwootsa.",
        "A: No, it was not hard work, and if it was, it was the -- the -- the feeling of doing\nsomething, accomplishing and -- and being proud of it, so whatever assignment we got, it\nwas fine. We were taught a -- a lot of stuff. We were treated well, we were given clean\nrooms, with clean beds, with clothes to wear, with food to eat. We were treated well, just\n-- some people talked to us Yiddish. They assumed that everybody knows it. And\nsometimes it was hard on me. So, we had to study Hebrew quite quickly, to be able to\ncommunicate. And we worked and we studied.",
        "A: I was in touch -- She was in touch with me, actually. She -- At that time, when I came\nto Israel, well, let me tell you what happened before. In the train from Hanover -- from\nHamburg to Marseilles, we were on the border of France, I think, when my roommate\nheard somebody calling out my name as the train was stopping. And sure enough, it was\nPeppy. Peppy was on that train and she was running alongside to -- to find where I was.\nSo, I saw her and she was traveling with some people from the UNRRA and from the\nJoint -- AJDC, American Joint Distribution Committee, and she was traveling with them\nto accompany the -- all the people who go to Israel. And she told me that she\u2019Il see me as\nsoon as we are in Marseilles, which really did happen. So she saw me off to the -- to the\nship. She also gave me a name and address of her husband\u2019s nephew, who was supposed\nto live in Israel. There was also a gentleman from America, who was in the armed forces,\nwho accompanied our group on the ship. And Peppy was going back to France, to Paris.\nApparently she -- she was involved in rescuing some children from different countries or\nfrom different places -- rescuing Jewish children. And she was going back to France, to --\nto Paris from Marseilles. This gentleman, who was in the armed forces, the American\none, David Eisenberg, a redhead -- I remember him so well. He accompanied the -- the\nship, with the children. And we got to Israel and after we settled in Kayata Navim, he\ncame to visit. And I asked him to help me find my uncle. I knew I had an uncle there, my\nmother\u2019s brother. And I asked him to help me to find Peppy\u2019s husband\u2019s nephew. Well,\nhe found the nephew very quickly. I called him, told him where Peppy is and then I\ndidn\u2019t hear from him any more. This David Eisenberg, he traveled with me to find my\nuncle. And we traveled quite awhile, we traced him down, oh yeah. I remember that he\nlived somewhere in Rananna. We went to Rananna, he wasn\u2019t there. We went to the post\noffice, we inquired, we asked. Somebody walked in and knew -- and knew my uncle\u2019s\nwife\u2019s sister lived in Rananna. We went there and they told us where my uncle was, in\nHaifa. So David Eisenberg really helped me a lot, finding people. Well, coming back to\nPeppy. When I found the nephew and -- actually, David found the nephew and he was\ninformed where Peppy was, apparently he got in touch with Peppy and told her that her\nhusband is alive. He was in Russia somewhere and he survived, and that he came back to\nPoland. So Peppy went there to see him, yeah.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Well, I stayed in kibbutz, yes. I went to visit with my uncle and aunt and their two\nchildren. One was jumping around in his playpen and the other one was outdoors, so they\nmust have been like a year and a half, or -- and the other one, maybe six, seven. Little\nkids. I just saw the -- the one that was older, 1s a grandfather, yeah. Anyway, that -- time\nflies unbelievably fast.",
        "A: Well, it was great. And my uncle Aram, he spoke to me Yiddish, too. And he likes to\nspeak Yiddish or Hebrew. He knew I don\u2019t speak Hebrew, so he spoke to me Yiddish.\nAnd I tried to do my best, so I replied, because I took some lessons in German and I\ncould speak at that time, German. And he laughed at me, that I don\u2019t speak well Yiddish.\nSo I said, \u201cLet\u2019s speak Polish.\u201d He said, \u201cNah.\u201d And it was very, very nice. And the\nsecond time I went to visit with him, which must have been a holiday, he told me that he\ngot the letter from his sister, my aunt. The one I hid under the -- the window in -- 1n that\nroom with her little boy. That she survived and her husband was in Russia and she found\nhim, too, cause he returned to Poland with the Russian army. And that they were hoping\nto find their son, the little boy. Which they found. So that\u2019s what I learned from my\nUncle Aram. And sure enough, I wrote to them that I am around. That letter that my\nUncle Aram received, stated that my aunt thought that maybe I am alive, because she saw\nme -- So -- she saw me in -- must have been September \u201844, was the last day I saw her\nand she thought maybe I was still alive. So, I wrote her and it was -- it was quite a -- quite\na thing.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Well, from -- from the time that we arrived there, we were studying, we were working\nand we were also involved in military exercise. It started as a gymnastics, as a field trips\nand it turned into throwing stones and then throwing grenades and then a little rifle --\ntarget, and little MG 34\u2019s, shooting and stuff. We were involved in exercise, war -- war\nexercise, or whatever. They taught us about it. I don\u2019t remember how often it was, but\nquite often. Boys and girls. And when the war started, we were -- we were involved in\ndoing all the services that everybody else did. And then there was the pamah that came\nand they were -- they were even having uniforms and stuff. And our group --\nBeginning Tape Three, Side A",
        "A: Uh-huh. Well, when the pamah came in, they had the command an-and things and\nactually, we were supposed to do whatever we were assigned to and some of our boys\nwere assigned to join an-and go to a -- how do you call that? The positions that were\nprepared -- and the girls, too. So, we were actually kind of mobilized to -- to be -- to help\nwith the pamah. And I know that some of the elders from the kibbutz were also in charge.\nSo, there must have been cooperation of forces, and we were involved in that. They\nneeded a lot of help. It was -- It was a very bad area where the war was concerned, near\nJerusalem and th-the location of our kibbutz was very vulnerable. Well, we participated\nin -- in that war and we were assigned different duties. I remember I w -- I tried to help\nout as a nurse, and when they brought the -- a wounded soldier and I was supposed to\nwash his head -- he was wounded in the head -- I was supposed to wash off from the\nblood, so that he can be treated, and -- and I kind of blacked out. I think that was the --\nthe end of my nursing career, very short-lived nursing career. And I was assigned then to\ncommunications. That lasted. So I was involved in communications. We also went on\npatrols, night patrols, day patrols and whatever needed to be done, we did participate.\nHowever, I understand that we were not sent out of the area. We were only 1n that area,\nbecause I remembered when a different group of pamah came in. One group moved and\none group came in. But we were on the left, where we were. So we\u2019re actually under their\norders when they were there, but would -- we were in the -- in Kayata Navim for the\ndefense of the place. So we lasted there quite a bit. And you know the outcome.",
        "A: Sometimes, but not very often. Don\u2019t forget that at this age, you don\u2019t think much\nabout comparing things. But sometimes a thought came to mind, like why doesn\u2019t\nanybody like us? What is it that we have done to the world? The Germans don\u2019t like us.\nThe Arabs don\u2019 t like us. I was not a good politician, I never was, I never will be. I just\nsee things from the point of view of -- of being human, being a person. So my concern\nsometimes was, why don\u2019t they like us? What have we done to be so disliked? And I\ncouldn\u2019t figure.",
        "A: Oh. Well, I -- I went to visit my uncle, eventually, after the war.",
        "A: My Uncle Philip in London, in England. I went to visit and I stayed there for about a\nyear or so, came back -- I came back to Israel and I stayed with my Aunt Esther -- the one\nthat survived -- her husband Shalom and their little boy, Yakov. I stayed with them in\nAko and there was their cousin -- my Uncle Shalom\u2019s cousin, I think and his wife, who\nhad the little place also in Ako, but it was not in the town, it was kind of out of town,\nwhere the government built places to live. Actually it was like a barrack or some, but it --\nit was -- people have a little room, kitchen, share a toilet with a next door neighbor, and a\nshower. These cousins, they lived there and we used to see each other once a week or so.\nAt one time, I had a little dispute with my aunt and uncle and decided to leave, and of\ncourse, where did I go, I went to the cousins. They invited me to stay. So I went there and\nthose cousin -- in the same place where they lived, lived my husband, and they\nintroduced us. So, we met, we went out a few times and I don\u2019t know, we -- we -- we\nwere dating for about two years before we were married.",
        "A: 1952.",
        "A: No. He had a good time. He -- He lived in China, in Shanghai. And anytime -- if I met\n-- if I met a friend who was a survivor or I talked to my friend as a survivor, he just\ncouldn\u2019t understand. Say, \u201cOh, what a terrible thing, what a -- we knew about it, but\nmuch later,\u201d he says. And I said, \u201cWhat have you done during that time?\u201d He says, \u201cI had\na good time. Went to cabaret, nightclub, theater, lived it up.\u201d",
        "A: This I don\u2019t know. This I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: But he had different past. His childhood and youth were different from mine.",
        "A: It was not a problem for me, I don\u2019t think so. As a matter of fact, I thought it would --\nit was very nice to listen to good stuff. It was not as depressing as to listen to the bad\nstuff, so it was okay.",
        "A: Well, my husband\u2019s parents came to the United States from -- from China and they\nalso had a daughter in the United States, my husband\u2019s sister. And they wanted to have\nboth children near them. I asked my husband to write them and invite them to come to\nIsrael, but a letter came back in which they said, \u201cIf we come here, we still have one child\nsomewhere else.\u201d So we decided to go. At that time, the parents wrote to -- to him about\ncoming to America and -- and settling down and having his parents nearby and -- and I\nthought that if my parents lived anywhere, I would go there. And, of course, I wanted to\nbe good, enjoy parents. So we wen -- we went.",
        "A: W-We came here, I think it was November of \u201855. November of \u201855 and we went to\nmy in-laws house. They had a pretty large apartment in Manhattan, on 79th Street. And\nthey gave us a bedroom with a bath and it was very, very beautiful, very beautiful.",

        "A: Yeah.",

But I also\nthought that, as I said, if I had parents in Siberia, I would try and get there. So -- So we\nwent.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. He was born there. He was about a year and a half, or a year and three\nmonths, that -- when -- when we took him in.",

        "A: Assistant -- Assistant to the bookkeeper.",
        "A: There was a factor -- an office, Dunmore. This was an office of a manufacturer of\nboy\u2019s wear. And th-they had a bookkeeper who was actually an office manager. She --\nThe books -- She had -- She -- A lot of people that worked there and did the payroll and\nstuff. So, I was her assistant.",

He\u2019s -- He tried to get into the fur business here, but he found it impossible,\nalmost. So, he tried other jobs, a salesman, he sold eyeglasses for awhile. He also -- He\nalso went -- in order to get som -- to earn some money, he went to the funeral parlors to\nbe a night watchman. Slowly, he developed all kinds of theories and tried all kinds of\nthings to make a better living. I was working all the time. I was lucky that my mother-in-\nlaw took care of the baby. I could leave the baby at home and go to work. And that was\npretty -- a great help.",
        "A: He was born in 1959, in Mount Sinai Hospital, in New York. And by that time, we\nmoved out from my in-law\u2019s place and we had an apartment on Riverside Drive. And my\nHank, my bigger boy, went to -- well, he started with the nursery, then he went to school,\nwent to Hebrew school. And when -- when my younger son was born, Sid, Hank was\nfive, so he was going -- he was going at that time, I think, to the nursery school. And I\ntook some time off from work and then later on, hired a babysitter so I could go back to\nwork.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No, did not talk about it, did not seek out anybody. I was quite busy with work and\nfamily. The only thing that I did do, was, soon as I heard from this organization, Bugrow,\nI joined them in hope of -- of finding somebody that I know or that kn-knew my people.\nSo I used to go with my husband to their meetings. But that was about the only thing.",
        "A: Oh yeah. Very sociable fellow, likes company.",
        "A: Yes, my older son, he gave me an assignment to write my memoirs, of which I wrote\nfive pages. And that\u2019s it. He would -- 1s very curious. Always asks questions. Even when\nwe went now to visit my old friends, he wanted to know more, and his wife, too. She\u2019s a\njournalist, so 1-it was for her also something probably interesting to hear. The younger\nson, he would ask a question or two. I think that -- that he was not up to it yet. There --\nThere has to be a time in one\u2019s life when one becomes to -- becomes -- comes to a point\nwhere he needs other information -- more information or where he wants to know\ndifferent things. It 1s -- probably happens to everybody. He would ask some questions,\nbut he was not as persistent. My Hank tells me quite often and he\u2019s persistent -- maybe\nalso different character, different types of people. He could have wanted me to do that,\nbut did not want to press on me. I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: Not in particular, no. I think that he -- he was satisfied with what he knew and what he\nread and what he heard from other people, and from me sometimes.",
        "A: Well, I wasn\u2019t looking for chances to talk. As matter of fact -- and right after the war,\nfor quite a few years, I couldn\u2019t talk about it. I remember when I was in England and my\naunt and uncle wanted to talk, I couldn\u2019t. It was very hard. It took quite some time to be\nable to talk about it. It -- The whole thing, it was such a humiliating experience, to be\nchased, to be -- to be at the target of somebody who wants to kill you because why? And\nthe way we were treated by the Germans, it was so humiliating. This wa -- This was\nprobably what they wanted to do, so that we can forget that we\u2019re human beings. It was\nvery humiliating. It was very tough to -- to reverse that, to say well, it is not what\nanybody else thinks, we are people, we have feelings, we\u2019re -- if -- we\u2019re not better, but\njust as good at least, as anybody else. Took a long time to -- to get back to what I call, to\nnormal. Maybe that\u2019s the reason that I can recognize survivors. There is something that\ntells us, oh, we\u2019re all right. We\u2019re okay. We\u2019re not what the Nazis told -- told the world\nthat we are. We\u2019re a people and some of us are -- are really nice. And then, when you\nthink about it and you read about it, we have given the world quite a few good things. So,\nI don\u2019t think anybody should hate us, but that\u2019s my opinion. That\u2019s my opinion.",

If they don\u2019t treat\nyou well, you can find out why or you can not communicate with these people any more.\nBut you, as my child, your approach should be to everybody, treat them the same and\ntreat them well. I think I did the right thing by telling them that. I even look back and I\nsee -- you saw now my friend that came in to -- to -- to do the air conditioning\n[indecipherable]? This person, I don\u2019t think I have anything in common with that person,\nand yet, he\u2019s my friend. I have quite a few friends with whom I have nothing in common,\nnot in the past and not in the present. But I met them and they\u2019re nice people and I like\nthem and they like me and we\u2019re friends. I find this to be the right thing for me. It always\n-- It is sa-said, you have to choose your friends. That\u2019s true. You don\u2019t become close\nfriends with just anybody, but you -- there is a difference between friends and -- and --\nand acquaintances. Your acquaintances can be very friendly and if you treat them the\nsame and they treat you, that\u2019s what I find. I have a lot of -- not a lot, some different --\nsome -- different friends who -- with whom I have nothing in common, and yet we\u2019re\nfriendly. And we see each other and we discuss things. I\u2019m glad to learn their point of\nview and hear what they have to say. And I have nothing but the best wishes for them.",
        "A: I can\u2019t tell that. I think you have to ask my son. But, very often, when I hear or read\nabout people who have difficulties communicating with their mothers, usually mothers\nand daughters have problems. I can\u2019t understand that. I simply cannot understand that\nand I cannot see why that would happen. Well, maybe there is a reason, but I don\u2019t know\nit.",
        "A: I really don\u2019t know, but if I were to speculate, I would think that maybe the both\nparties want to -- to impose their views on the other party, whether it\u2019s mothers and\ndaughters or vice versa. I find it possible to express my views to my son and not impose\non it. He should know my views. If I wouldn\u2019t tell him, it wouldn\u2019t be fair. He should\nknow his mother just like I would like to know him. He would know my views, but I\ndon\u2019t impose. Maybe those people try to impose those views, one upon the other. I don\u2019t\nknow, but that\u2019s how I would speculate it is.",
        "A: Yes. My son Hank -- that was the same year that the museum was opened and I\nreceived and invitation as one of the, I don\u2019t know, not founders, but people who gave\ntheir -- their life stories or whatever and I was supposed to go to Washington, DC for that\nopening. But my son suggested that since the whole thing is happening in Warsaw, we\nshould go there, so we did.",
        "A: It was the 50th anniversary of the ghetto Warsaw. And, I still have an uncle in\nWarsaw. I saw him, too.",
        "A: No, just with my son. We booked a one week tour of the -- of the camps and the\nimportant places during the co -- Holocaust. So we were driven by bus and we had a ga --\na tour guide and we visited the camps and this was for one week. And the second week,\nwe spend two days with my uncle and then we went back to Krakow to look around\nourselves for things that we didn\u2019t have a chance to -- to see enough or we wanted to\nrevisit. And we saw a lot of stuff. We also, one day, went back -- he wanted to know\nwhere I was born and where I lived and my side of the family, because some years back,\nhe went to China to see where his father grew up. So this time he wanted to see about me,\nSO we went, we took some pictures in front of the house and we walked around, we saw\nwhere it was and then we went -- I explained to him a few things that I remembered. He\nwas very impressed. My uncle took us to an Israeli restaurant in Warsaw, which was --\nby which I was very impressed. And I recalled a few things that happened and where it\nhappened. I think my son was very impressed wi-with -- with things that he heard about\nand now he saw, but he was -- he was so upset when we went to the camps. Couldn\u2019t --\nCouldn\u2019t tear him away from looking at those shoes and those glasses and -- and things\nhe -- he was -- he was really upset. And then we had some experience with the modern\nanti-Semitic behavior.",
        "A: Well, there were still signs on some buildings and especially in the -- in the -- where\nthe train goes, on the sides, there were walls and there were still signs there that said,\n\u2018Out with the Jews\u2019. You know, derogatory statements for the Jews. There -- There are\nstill people who speak badly about us, and when I\u2019d experienced that a little bit. So, on\nthe other hand, they cook very delicious food, very rich and delicious food and they have\nsome nice things. But the ghetto Warsaw is non-existent. And when we tried to see --\nEnd of Tape Three, Side A\nBeginning Tape Three, Side B",
        "A: Well, I had -- I had no one to respond to. I just felt that it\u2019s insulting, it still exists and\nit\u2019s bad. And nowadays we hear even more about it, of what is going on in Russia and in\nother countries. It\u2019s very upsetting and I cannot respond to that. I wish it was nonexistent.",
        "A: Very much, very much.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No. We went to Majdanek, to Treblinka, to Auschwitz-Birkenau.",
        "A: It was. It was emotional f-for s-several reasons. To begin with, it\u2019s the place that you\nthought you know. And all of a sudden, I find that I couldn\u2019t recognize everything.\nMainly the things that were rebuilt and of course, they could have been rebuilt a little\ndifferently. But, also, I couldn\u2019t recognize -- I thought there was a street somewhere and\nthen you go there, no, that there was no street, there is just a block. In other words, the\nmemory plays a little trick. And I was upset about that. On the other hand, there were\nsome things that I remembered and I told my son, \u201cWhen we\u2019ll go around the corner,\nwe'll see steps mai --\u201d At that time they were made of stone, I think. But they go all the\nway down to the -- to the river. And he looks at me, we take a walk. Just around the\ncorner, here are the steps, only they are made of wood and they are much nicer now. So,\nit brought back -- it brought back my -- my self confidence. We had -- he -- his birthday\nwas while we were there, so we went to a very fancy restaurant and we were much\nimpressed with -- with the restaurant and with the food they served and with the service\nthey had. So that was one nice thing about it. But, when we went to another place, we\nfound some -- some anti-Semitism exists, yeah. Which was not that great, and I wish it\nwould go away.",
        "A: I did not confront it here as openly as in Europe, no.",
        "A: There was graffiti, there was also -- some expressions exist that people use. I know\nthat there are some expressions in America, too, but I didn\u2019t hear them -- I didn\u2019t hear\nthem being used. Over there, I s -- I heard them being used a lot and it seems to be kind\nof degrading. Why don\u2019t they get rid of those expressions? There -- There are very few\nJews now in Poland, very few, and mainly they are old and they are there because they\nhave no place to go. I wonder why the people are so angry with us. There are no Jews\nthere for 50 years. What could we do -- what we could have done to make those people\nstill angry with us? A-And they are still using some expressions, they probably inherited\nthem. Maybe they -- I don\u2019t know if they stop to think, but they should.",
        "A: I think that -- that I have become a milder person, a more understanding person of\nothers. And if somebody is persecuted or singled out, for anything for the bad, I -- I really\nfeel for them and I wish it would go away. Of course, when I say singled out, I don\u2019t\nmean people who are lawless. I\u2019m talking about the political things that are happening.\nFor politics people get killed and mistreated. I simply wish it would go away, because it -\n- it isn\u2019t worth it. Life is so short and when you treat people nice, you treat everybody\nnice and everybody treats you nice, isn\u2019t that a world we want to live in? To help one\nanother, rather than to fight. I see no good reason to -- to have any wars. I may be very,\nvery stupid, I see no reasons for it, or -- we\u2019re talking now about -- about preparing\nweapons of mass destruction. That is awful. Who needs that? And sometimes I think that\nhaving gone through what I have, I wish I could live in a world that is peaceful and the\nsame for my children, my son and daughter-in-law, their families. For my friends, I wish\nwe had peace, we -- everybody would really benefit from it.",
        "A: I cannot very well answer this, because I am very -- a very poor politician.",
        "A: I think the McCarthy era was before my time here.",
        "A: Women\u2019s movement, in my mind -- in my mind, women should get paid the same if\nthey do the same work as men. Women should get jobs that they are good for, just like\nmen should get jobs that they are good for. I don\u2019t think that they should be chosen on\nthe basis of their sex, but because of what they can do on a job. That\u2019s what they should\ndo. But, I also believe that women are different from men. So, some of those movements\nthat you mention, don\u2019t fall into any category. I would pull out -- some points out of it\nand say, where work is concerned, it goes by ability, who is able to do what. Should be\ndoing th-that thing and get paid the same. When it comes to personal lives, women are\ndifferent from men, period, no matter what. And as -- as such, we have to behave as such\nand we shouldn\u2019t change our behavior. I don\u2019t like to see boys walking around in dresses\nor -- or -- or -- or girls wearing man\u2019s suits. We are -- I feel that in private life, in\npersonal life, men are men and women are women, should act as such and behave as\nsuch. That does not mean that it\u2019s a woman\u2019s job to cook the supper. If he is a better\ncook, he should do it. If he comes home earlier from work, he should do it. It is sharing,\nit 1s -- 1t is equality in where it counts. But we\u2019re -- we\u2019re not the same, we\u2019re much\ndifferent. And as they say, vive la difference. I believe in that. But I\u2019d like to get paid as\nmuch as a man if I do the work that a man does.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know of what I wanted to add, because I didn\u2019t plan on what you\u2019re going to\nask. Pll be glad to answer any questions if you have any. If I can, I will answer, be\ntruthful. But I really don\u2019t know what you would like to hear. To encapsulate 50 years in\ntwo or three hours, is very hard. And I\u2019m sure that when you leave, I will probably think,\noh why didn\u2019t I say so and so or such and such or explain this event or that. It\u2019s very\nhard, but it might happen. So, I\u2019m glad that I could answer some of what you asked and if\nyou have any more questions, Ill be glad to -- to supply my answers, however poorly\nthey may sound.\nEnd of Tape Three, Side B\nConclusion of Interview\n"
