        "A: Right.",
        "Q: -- and he got -- you got two Polish workers who were working -- supposed to\nwork on your farm. Did -- you -- you don\u2019t -- do you know how it came that those\ntwo were chosen, by any chance?",
        "A: Well, that -- the community, they were -- they were saying my -- my -- my --\nmy father had to put applications in to need some workers, and he did. He wanted\nmore, but they decide to give him one. Then later on they said two because they\nreally saw we needed -- we re -- really need workers because they all -- they all\nwants to go -- you couldn\u2019t get Austrian workers because they\u2019re all going to war,\nyou know? And my brother also. And so they said not -- December eight, that\nthere going to be -- got to be -- two Polish workers got to be picked up. So my\nfather went and want to pick up the Polish workers. At the time they were saying\nfrom -- from Poland, to Austria, to Vienna, a -- such a snowstorm came, you\nknow, so the train got stuck somewhere, they couldn\u2019t get to Austria, you know.\nSo my father was waiting, the -- all the farmers were there, they were waiting 1n --\nin -- in [indecipherable] on a -- on a -- on a -- on a -- you know, on a ha -- s --\nwhat the -- get the workers who -- they\u2019re supposed to come in the office, and they\nhad to go home because they didn\u2019t came. Well, my father do -- was about four or\nfive kilometer, almost five kilometer to walk home in that snowstorm, so he got\nreal sick. He was -- had a bad cold. The next day he had said he -- he just can\u2019t go,\nyou know. And we need them workers, what we going to do? So he said Frieda,\nyou want to go? I said, yeah, I go. We couldn't go with any -- any -- any horses or\nthe -- or the wagon or the -- anything like that, so I had to walk and walk in that\nsnow and there was no snowplowed or anything. And I walked for kilometers to\nget to this -- for the wor -- get the worker, yeah, workers.",
        "Q: And then they started to work for you, and -- and you got to like Julian slowly.\nDid you like him right away, or was it a slow proce -- what did you like about\nhim?",
        "A: Well, actually, when -- when -- when th-the man in the unem -- unemployment\noff -- when the unemployment office said, you know, you get this worker and this\nworker. Doesn\u2019t mean anything to me, you know, so okay, let\u2019s go home. It got\ndark already, was almost 4:30, something like that. And that man from the -- from\nthe unemployment office, he -- he know my father very well. I -- In -- even\nthought about that he didn\u2019t trust them two guys, you know, with a young girl to\nwalk home for four kilometer in the dark. Never even came -- came to my mind,\nyou know? He said, listen, I called taxi for you, you going to go home in a taxi\nwith them two guys. So they all -- we almost got home with the taxi, but up on a\nhill there was so much snow that we have to walk, you know, we had to walk to\nthe farm. And we did. And we came home to the farm, they all was waiting for --\nfor us. My mom had a big supper ready. My sisters were there, even my grandpa\nwas there and my father. And we walked in, here they are, you know, so okay. My\nfather, he knows a few words in Polish, right, because he was in the first World\nWar, he was 1n Poland. And little by little, you know, they got -- you know,\nfriendly, yeah, and -- but didn\u2019t came into my mind that I had a -- you know, I\nreally -- I just liked, you know, that we got workers, and got help on the farm, you\nknow? And --",
        "Q: So how did that change, though?",
        "A: Well, he was very, very helpful, very f-friendly, Julian, you know? And we\nliked that, we girls, we really liked that, that he was friendly, and very pleasant\nand we got along good and things. But still, you know, gee, I would never,\nbecause you could never, ever -- they were saying, you know, don\u2019t you ever get\ninvolved with someone -- they said, you shouldn\u2019t eat even on the same -- by the\nsame table. But my mom said no, not such a thing, she said, you know, you all --\nwe're -- we -- we girls had to eat by the same table what the workers was wer --\neating. But Mom and Dad, they eat in the other room, you know, but you girls, we\nalways -- and we did. We\u2019re at the same table, eating at the same table.",
        "Q: What did you like -- what did you like about Julian, though [indecipherable |",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, he was friendly and happy and this and that, and I think we girls,\nwe needed someone to, you know, to be nice, and bring some -- I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s\njust little by little, very little by little, and he was nice and -- and once we -- he\nhelped me to carry something in the barn, you know, and he just -- just lean over\nand -- and -- and kissed me. I said, oh, don\u2019t you dare, you know? He stole a kiss\nfrom me, you know. And gee, I got all shook up that he did that, I didn\u2019t expect\nthat, you know? And I didn't look at him for three days, I didn\u2019t even look at him.\nI got so -- so scared. And then little by little, you know, he was nice, you know,\nreally very, very gentle and little by little, we got -- yeah, like -- liked each other a\nlittle bit, you know. But, oh my gosh, this can\u2019t happen, this is out of question, you\nknow, this just --",
        "Q: You were very much aware of how dangerous this 1s?",
        "A: Yes, oh yes, oh yes, oh yes. First of all, for myself and for him too, you know,\nbecause if they find out if I just mentioned something that he is friendly or\nsomething, you know, they would put him away and he would be gone forever,\nyou know, so -- they were so strict that time, you know, so -- and I wouldn\u2019t do\nthat.",
        "Q: Then, at one day, you allowed him to listen secretly to the radio. Now that was\nalso dangerous.",
        "A: It was also dangerous, yes, yeah, because it was just a -- from the big room\nwould a -- where we usually eat, you know, was a door to the smaller room where\nmy father had the radio, you know, that was very -- was just one radio in the\nhouse. And he wanted to listen to that, you know, and [indecipherable] I just keep\nthe door unlocked and he went in and listened to that radio, you know. Nobody\nknew that, you know, so -- he didn\u2019t do anything wrong, nor any harm, you know,\nbut I -- I did let him do that, you know?",
        "Q: What wou -- I always have to ask why, but you know, so you were a young\nperson, and -- but it was -- 1t was dangerous. Why did you -- I mean, it almost\nseems as if you were courting danger.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: Why would you do that -- what --",
        "A: I don\u2019t know myself. I don\u2019t know myself, you know. Little by little we fell in\nlove, I think, you know, and that\u2019s how it happened, you know. My father noticed\nthat, m-my father -- and somebody else must too, you know, must -- somebody --\nsomebody else must have saw something. And my father said no, that can\u2019t go on\nlike that, and -- and once he did slap me, you know, and I was so hurt because it\nwas my father what I loved so dearly and he loved me, too. And that --",
        "Q: Did somebody see you -- did somebody --",
        "A: Probably.",
        "Q: -- see him while he was listening and [indecipherable]",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. Somebody must have see us, you know, what -- we were friendly\nto each other, or whatever. Yeah, and --",
        "Q: And then eventually your father called both of you -- first separately and then\nboth --",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: -- of you into a room and gave you an ultimatum basically because --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- it was too dangerous --",
        "A: Right, right.",
        "Q: -- one of you had to leave, so you decided to -- to go --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- and s-say that --",
        "A: It was a big step for me, that was -- I knew if I don\u2019t go that he 1s in danger.",
        "Q: Julian?",
        "A: Julian is in danger, yes. And I couldn\u2019t let that happen, I just couldn\u2019t, you\nknow? It\u2019s something -- something tells you that, you know, it -- you -- you can\u2019t\ndo that, something -- something going to happen to him and he would be gone\nforever, you know? And so I said, I go. That was terrible, you know, it was a big st\n-- big step for me. And my father was stubborn too, you know, he said well, if you\nlike that, you know, so --",
        "Q: Did anybody in the family try to hold you back or to change your mind?",
        "A: No, my mom tried, you know, but some sisters even said, n -- n -- later on they\nwere saying when -- if the -- if th -- I came home, they were saying, why don\u2019t we\nstick together, why didn\u2019t -- we were there for you? So they just let me go, just\nlike that, you know, and I had no one to turn to.",
        "Q: So Julian stayed on the farm --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- and you went to another small farm, but you -- you --",
        "A: No, actually, that was a big farm. It was a big farm, that first one. Was a big\nfarm, yeah. And I was there, working there and somebody must have see us, or the\n-- something, I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: So you cont -- you continued to see each other [indecipherable |",
        "A: Yes, oh he came immediately, every Sunday, you know, yes. Like we said, you\nknow, at that time, you know, when I left, we were saying that I know that that --\nthat gonna be far away, so far away it\u2019s not 1n our area over here that they put me\nto work because you have not a choice what a -- the u -- employment office puts\nyou, you have to go, you know, so there was no other choice. So I know that\u2019s\ngoing to be in Eferding. And I sen -- I said, in Eferding going to be a church, I\nknow that. And near the church over there we\u2019re going to meet -- you\u2019re going to\nbe here at one o\u2019clock, we going to see each other Sunday, that following Sunday.\nAnd that\u2019s what had happened, a way -- we saw each other. He came, and we were\nvery happy to saw each other, and that\u2019s --",
        "Q: But then eventually you got denounced and you were arrested and you were\ninterrogated by the Gestapo in -- in Linz?",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: And you took the -- basically you took the blame on you that --",
        "A: Oh yes, oh yes, I took it --",

So you were back in\nLinz at the Gestapo headquarters and this time the situation was more serious\nbecause you had already signed papers that you would never see him again, and\nthe interrogation was -- was much more harsh. And what -- what happened then?",
        "A: Right. Well, one, the Gestapo took me, and interviewed me. They -- they\nshowed me -- they told me that I was already here, that I must -- you know, second\ntime here and that was more serious. And how come, what happened? And you\nsees -- sees -- see still that Pole, you know, they were saying, you know, to make\nhim -- you know, make me -- humiliate me, you know\u201d? And I said, well, you\nknow, once in awhile, you know, we are friends, and things. Then -- then later on\nthey were saying what -- you know, to -- to force it out on me, you know, that you\nhad something to do with him, you know. It was no other way, you know, that just\nforce it out of me there\u2019s some poss -- well, yes, I had something to do with him,\nwe had something to do each other. Okay, that\u2019s about it. But, I said, 1t\u2019s my fault.\nI took it on me, blame on me, and I -- I thought that going to be better for Julian,\nyou know, because if it\u2019s the opposite then -- then to take it out on him, and\nthey\u2019re going to -- I know they\u2019re going to -- not going to kill me. I know that, I\nwas sure, you know. But I took it -- everything on me, on -- that is everything my\nfault, you know, that we got together and had something to do with each other.\nAnd -- okay, so they -- they were saying, you know what\u2019s -- what\u2019s going to\nhappen to you, you\u2019re going to be black and blue, and you\u2019re going to be sent to\nconcentration camp. Well, I had nothing to say, you know, so what I could say?\nAnd I got back to the prison cell again, only in two days, I remember, my father\ncame to the Gestapo. And he talked with them. He had a lot of friends over -- you\nknow, some people told him, you know, to go there and do something about it.\nAnd my father came, he wanted to see me, so they called me out from the cell, and\na special -- there were a special room where you visit us and my father was there, I\nwas scared to death, you know. And then -- he was very gentle to me. He said,\nwhat happened? He said, please tell me the truth, he said, you got to tell me the\ntruth. If you tell -- you -- nothing happened between you two, you know, and I do\nanything to get you out of here, you know, get you home. Did you -- what you\nsay? I said, yes, we ha -- da -- we had something to do with each other. Then he\nwas just shook up. He said -- he hugged me and hold me for awhile. He said, I\ncan\u2019t help you now, he said. And he was very sad about it. And --",
        "Q: But that you took the blame on yourself, that you were the one who initiated\nthe relationship --",

        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- they would have killed him?",
        "A: Oh yeah, definitely, definitely, yeah. Because they killed many out -- and in\n[indecipherable] they were saying they were -- they were saying that some of them\nwere hanged out in the woods, and some Polish people have to come and see it,\nhow they were hanged in the woods, you know, because he had something to do\nwith German girl, and on -- once they were saying that was a -- a German girl in\nsome town far away from us. A German girl that she had something to do with a\nPolish young man, and then there were a nasty mayor over there in that town.\nThey shaved her head, put her on a wagon, and with -- on a h -- on the horse, and\ndrove her around in town. And that there was a sign up there, I had sexual\nsomething to do with a Polish Auslander [indecipherable] yeah, foreigner, you\nknow?

        "Q: But --",
        "A: But at least it didn\u2019t happen to me like that, you know, so I was glad that they\ndidn\u2019t put me out in the open like that. So they were saying that I got to go to the\nconcentration camp, and they were -- we were about seven or the -- eight girls\nthere, all the same problem, all -- all the same thing they had in a cell, all the same\nthing, you know? And they said, well that\u2019s all it is, you know. If we survive, we\nsurvive, if not, you know, then that\u2019s it, you know? And then I was there til\nNovember, in the Gestapo, locked up. And then they came, I had to signed a pink\nslip -- a pink paper, sign my name. And that was -- dos -- th-that slip was for the\nconcentration camp, that I got a -- they sent me to concen -- yeah, I will know it,\nyou know, if they come with the pink slip, they know that\u2019s a concentration camp,\nand I was one of them, you know.

And then\nthey took us somewhere downstairs, somewhere in a -- in a tunnel. And when we\nwalked downstairs I got scared, it was the most scary things. They were like on a -\n- on a -- on a -- when you walk down it, alls you could see was caskets. What the\ncaskets are doing here, why?

I remember once he was saying, you\nknow, wh-when the war is over, when I going to go home, what I gonna told\nJulian\u2019s mother how Julian died, you know? And what I gonna tell him?

And it was -- the -- the war -- when --\nis -- was over in March 23, and I thought, I wonder if he come -- come here, or the\n-- it -- if he survived, and things, you know, and I keep thinking about it, you\nknow, if he made it, you know, over there in concentration camp. And then it was\nalready March, April, May. No, no, he not gonna come, that\u2019s too long already, he\nwould be here by now, you know. So, that was one day 1n a -- I think it was Friday\nor the Saturday evening, Saturday evening it was, May 18, and -- 1945, and I was -\n- it was a beautiful evening, the birds were singing 1n the -- in the -- in the big yard\n-- in the -- in the hofe out there, you know.

And isn\u2019t much worth it, you know, so how my life gonna\nbe, and things, and then I was thinking, my God, Julian not gonna -- he not -- he\ndidn\u2019t survived, he didn't make it, but how I can get in touch with his mother,\nbecause I know his mother loved him so much, and he was very close with his\nmother, that I\u2019d want to let her know that he was not a criminal, that he was a good\nman, and that he lost his life because he loved me. And to let her know that. If he\ndidn\u2019t -- maybe he came back to Poland, you know, so I wasn\u2019t sure, maybe he\nwent straight to Poland from the concentration camp if he is alive. And I was\nthinking like that, and -- and the doorbell\u2019s ringing. My sister went out -- out to the\n-- answer the door, the big door, and then she said, Julius, and when I heard that\nword, there\u2019s just one Julius, you know, what I know. My God, this is\nunbelievable, that must be him, you know. And I came running up to the door, and\nthat was him with another friend, both of them on a bicycle, you know. I said, oh\nmy God, you\u2019re here, and then he -- we hugged, and my sister stood there, and she\nwent -- she went in the house, and we talked for awhile and then we said well,\ntomorrow we gonna meet somewhere, and that\u2019s how I was so very happy.",

        "A: Oh, he -- he was -- he was someplace else, on another farm, on his friends, and\nthe people were very good to him, they let him stay there. But I was on my\nfather\u2019s farm, on our farm at home, yeah.

I just couldn\u2019t get married over there because\nthe people were still kind of, you know, that it wasn\u2019t right, you know. So we said\nwe no have to do that, we\u2019re going to get married in a big city, in Linz. And my\nhusband arranged everything, and arranged a big bus -- a -- a bus, you know, to\ncome and take us all to the wedding, to Linz.

        "A: Well, he no want to, but he had to. That was like you have to belong to the\nparty. If not, you\u2019re not going to get any machinery, or the -- no workers.

So, that ma -- they gave him a real hard time, you know. We couldn\u2019t get\nany workers, and machinery were hard to get. Just when you belong to the party.\nSo there was already a tractor on a way for us, a big tractor, you know, to -- to --\nthat we get on the farm and that was very important. But then [indecipherable] my\nfather have the tractor, just keep going on, just couple small machineries he got,\nyou know, what he really, really needed, you -- and he really begged for it, you\nknow. But they gave him a hard time.",
        "A: Not exactly d -- that -- that date when h -- when he left, you know, but --",

And my brother also. And so they said not -- December eight, that\nthere going to be -- got to be -- two Polish workers got to be picked up. So my\nfather went and want to pick up the Polish workers.

And then -- he was very gentle to me. He said,\nwhat happened? He said, please tell me the truth, he said, you got to tell me the\ntruth. If you tell -- you -- nothing happened between you two, you know, and I do\nanything to get you out of here, you know, get you home. Did you -- what you\nsay? I said, yes, we ha -- da -- we had something to do with each other. Then he\nwas just shook up. He said -- he hugged me and hold me for awhile. He said, I\ncan\u2019t help you now, he said.

And then it was\nalready March, April, May. No, no, he not gonna come, that\u2019s too long already, he\nwould be here by now, you know.

And isn\u2019t much worth it, you know, so how my life gonna\nbe, and things, and then I was thinking, my God, Julian not gonna -- he not -- he\ndidn\u2019t survived, he didn't make it, but how I can get in touch with his mother,\nbecause I know his mother loved him so much, and he was very close with his\nmother, that I\u2019d want to let her know that he was not a criminal, that he was a good\nman, and that he lost his life because he loved me. And to let her know that. If he\ndidn\u2019t -- maybe he came back to Poland, you know, so I wasn\u2019t sure, maybe he\nwent straight to Poland from the concentration camp if he is alive. And I was\nthinking like that, and -- and the doorbell\u2019s ringing. My sister went out -- out to the\n-- answer the door, the big door, and then she said, Julius, and when I heard that\nword, there\u2019s just one Julius, you know, what I know. My God, this is\nunbelievable, that must be him, you know. And I came running up to the door, and\nthat was him with another friend, both of them on a bicycle, you know. I said, oh\nmy God, you\u2019re here, and then he -- we hugged, and my sister stood there, and she\nwent -- she went in the house, and we talked for awhile and then we said well,\ntomorrow we gonna meet somewhere, and that\u2019s how I was so very happy.",

So every time, more -- the more often\nwe came and other friends, they invite me, you know, invite us, we should come,\nbut we never had a chance to. Some -- some of them died already, they\u2019re gone\nforever. And some of them what we went to school, they always said, you know,\nwant to see my sister.
