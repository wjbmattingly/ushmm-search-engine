I remember a little table, in the middle with a\nclothing hanging over it and I would sit under it most\nof the time because I was afraid I knew that Germans\nwere always searching for children.

I remember that. It's interesting\nbecause I remember, as I said I would sit under the\ntable and I really didn't have any toys but paper and\npencil and I would draw pictures. And it was always\nabout soldiers, Germans and the Jews fighting. I\nremember drawing pictures of house, of a house, this\none is just amazing because it has always stayed with\nme. I drew a picture of a house with a chimney and\nthat I would stuff Hitler inside that chimney and that\nhe would suffocate and die and you're, it's only re-\ncently that I even thought about my god how symbolic\nthat the chimney was obviously I had, was no idea.

So when it was our turn and appar-\nently he pointed to the left, my father just grabbed me\nas we were all walking together and just pushed our way\ninto the right side and that's why I survived.
