        "Q: I need you to start off by telling me your name, place of birth, and date of birth?",
        "A: My name David Kochalski. I was born in a small town called , and I was\nborn May 5, 1928.",
        "Q: Tell me a little bit about your family life before the war?",
        "A: Well, we were very hard working, six children, father and mother and we had a small\nmill, flour, buckwheat. We were not prosperous but comfortable.",
        "Q: Did you go to a public school, a private school?",
        "A: I went to two schools. One was a public school in the morning. In the afternoon I went\nto a religious school until almost late at night.",
        "Q: So your family was fairly religious?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And Judaism was important to you?",
        "A: Well, I raised in the spirit of Judaism.",
        "Q: Now, when you went to the public school you had a lot of friends who were not Jewish?",
        "A: No, the school itself, in this little city, was segregated between Catholics and Jews. Mind\nyou, it was a small town, and I would say the majority of the people in that small town\nwere Jewish people. Inside the town, somehow, I don't know why, but they separated us\nJewish children and Catholic children. As you know, most of the people in Poland were\nCatholic.",
        "Q: Did you have friends who were Catholics?",
        "A: Yes, I used to have friends.",
        "Q: Did you feel any anti-semitism growing up?",
        "A: Yes, I did. I felt it, maybe not personally, but I knew of a lot of incidents whereby either\nthey were small little -- I would call 1t -- we were separated, in other words, but hardly\ngot together, and there were incidents. Incidents, not pleasant incidents, because we were\ncalled in from the house, people regardless of how religious we were, did not believe that\nwe were really religious people.",
        "Q: Were there any incidents with your brothers or sisters that you remember?",
        "A: No, other than we were a lovely family.",
        "Q: Were there a lot of cultural or social organizations, political organizations in the town?",
        "A: Yes there were Zionists in the city. There were Socialists, there were Communists, even\nthough at that time Communists had to go underground, and religious institutions.",
        "Q: Were your parents active in the Zionist movement?",
        "A: My parents were, I would say, Zionists, and very religious.",
        "Q: What did you know about Hitler and the rise of Nazism before the war?",
        "A: I was aware what was going on even though I was a very young youngster. My father\nused to subscribe to many newspapers, Jewish in origin and non-Jewish papers, papers\nthat had nothing to do with us. However, my father and my brother and all the rest of\nthem we used to discuss those things. They used to discuss and I used to listen, and I\nknew what was going on. In fact, I remember when they were chasing out Jews from\nGermany, who were of Polish origin, my father took in some of them, a couple of them,\nto stay with them because they came out of there with nothing. They really went from\ncity to city amongst Jews. There were so many of them that people had to help. So, I\nwas aware, until the war, very much aware, what was going on.",
        "Q: They told stories of what was going on in Germany\u2019?",
        "A: Definitely, yes. In a public school, since it was more or less a Jewish school, in other\nwords, we did not speak Jewish there, it was Polish, history, everything was Polish, and\nthe guy who was --what do you call it? He was not Polish, the guy who was running the\nschool, he was not Jewish, he was Polish. In other words, he was a Catholic, so we were\naware amongst us kids, because sometimes we were not greeted in the city very well.",
        "Q: Did you have any idea what was happening in Germany might come to your town?",
        "A: Yes, because people were aware that eventually Hitler will overrun Poland. It was\nknown between people that he's not going to stop at that time in Czechoslovakia. He had\ngreat -- in other words, he had great expansion ideas, and he asked the Polish government\nto give him almost everything they needed, or wanted. So, we knew it was going to be\nsooner or later. A few days before the war they already had black outs in Poland,\nbecause at that time, I would say the Russians and the Poles signed an agreement. It was\nabout a week before the war, and everyone was aware that there will be a war. We did\nnot know the particulars of what they signed. The Germans, the USSR, we anticipated\nthere would be a war.",
        "Q: Was there anything that the community did in preparation for this?",
        "A: I don't think so. The Jewish people naturally were very anxious. They already knew\nwhat happened to the people. They were thrown out. They already heard of the burnings\nof the synagogues and everything, but they really thought it will pass if the Germans\ncome in. It will pass, and Jewish people really believed that Germany was going to be\ndefeated. We were aware and the preparation was made in a way. People used to hoard\nfood and everything, because they knew he was going to come. They had certain\nmemories, Jewish people had certain memories of World War I where it really was\nbenign. They occupied Poland or part of Poland and it was benign. In other words, the\noccupation, they were not harsh on Jews. On the other end, Jews were very friendly\nbecause our language, the Jewish language resembled German, so there were a lot of\nGermans in that town. They used to speak Jewish too, or Jews spoke German. So, the\nJews kind of figured it will go over. Maybe the war will take a little longer, but it's not\ngoing to be that bad. They did not expect anything very bad.",
        "Q: Do you remember what the Catholic population was thinking? Were they eager for\nGermany to come in? Were they prepared to fight them?",
        "A: At that time, it was more or less, I would say a partnership between Jews and Catholics,\nbecause they had a history, the catholics had a bad history of German occupations. The\nJews already knew what was going to happen, that they are putting Jews in concentration\ncamps and so on. That they are really against Jews, the Germans. So,\nnaturally at that point they were united.",
        "Q: Do you remember the day that was occupied by Germany?",
        "A: What I remember is one morning, I think it was on a Friday, we were all sleeping and all\nof a sudden, a great bang in that little town. A bomb was thrown. We did not know it\nwas a bomb. We all ran out and we saw planes going over. There was near the town, not\nfar from the town were German garrison (ph). They tried to bomb the garrison but they\nmissed. They bombed the city. At that time, radios whatever you could hear, they\nannounced already that the war had begun.",
        "Q: They tried to bomb a German garrison?",
        "A: No, it was a Polish Army garrison, which from what I guess, they wanted to bomb, but\nthey probably missed.",
        "Q: Do you remember what was going on at this point? You went outside, you realized there\nhad been a bomb. What did you see? What were people doing?",
        "A: Panic, immediately. There was great panic in town. People did not know what to do, to\nstay in that little town or escape to Warsaw. My parents they went to Warsaw. All the\nsix children and my mother. My father was in the militia. He was a young man. They\ntook him in the militia to watch black outs. Once the German planes came they either\nthrew out -- they didn't throw them out, but they let go certain soldiers in parachutes. His\naim, my father's aim, was to watch that a black outs and there were some people who\ncame in there to bomb some bridges. So my father was there, and my mother was in\nWarsaw. Finally, my mother got very lonely or she was afraid that something was going\nto happen to my father, since he wasn't far, so she took me and we went back to that little\ncity. Warsaw at that time was not spared, but they did not come yet, the Germans.",
        "Q: So, what happened after this?",
        "A: I went back with that little city. My mother stayed with my father, otherwise he was in\nthe Reserves, the Military Reserves, but she watched after him and I was around there\nand watched after the mill, which we had.",
        "Q: It was still going?",
        "A: Yes. I stayed there. All of sudden we heard that Warsaw was surrounded, and here my\nmother and father were very anxious because five children were there. We heard that the\nGermans surrounded them and the artillery is going, and there was no food because there\nwere more than a million people in Warsaw. My father and mother decided that I should\ngo back to Warsaw to help the children. So, they loaded me up with flour, food, but it\nwas very tough, tough for me.",
        "Q: You were talking about you were going to take some food?",
        "A: I had to take some food to help because starvation in Warsaw my mother and father heard\nabout. And you know, they have four children left helter skeltor in Warsaw in a small\nroom. So, they loaded me up with all kinds of food and they said, maybe he'll make it\neven though Warsaw was surrounded. It was very heavy what they put on, and I\nremember my father and mother, my mother would say to my father, maybe we'll never\nsee him again. But I guess the urge to help the children was greater and my father kind\nof looked at me and probably thought the same way, will I go through it, because there\nwere horses and people on the street massacred, killed on the way to Warsaw. In other\nwords, out of town the Germans would also throw in a bomb, artillery, bombed it. Many\npeople would walk through the streets going to Warsaw you would see carnage. So, my\nmother kind of kissed me and says who knows if I'll ever see him to my father, and my\nfather clenched his hand and I turned around and I walked. I never saw them again.",
        "Q: How do you know what happened to them?",
        "A: Well, I came back from Warsaw, that same day Warsaw capitulated. I want to tell you\nfirst. I made it into Warsaw. It was very hard. It was very hard, but when I came\nWarsaw was surrounded there was a time they had what you call -- they stopped fighting\nto collect the dead. The Germans were fighting the Poles, the Polish Army. They were\nsurrounding them and of course, the Polish Army had some fierce resistance. However,\nthere was a time when they got the Red Cross or whatever, they arranged a one hour to\nget the dead out of the way. Germans and Polish. At that time, kids like us could go\nthrough. I made it and somehow when I came to a certain bridge, since they bombarded\nthe bridge with artillery, I had flour in the bag and a piece of shrapnel went in there. The\nflour, we got out of it, but we had other food. The flour went on the floor and I made it\nand I brought it to my brother and sisters, because there was starvation. Artillery, there\nwere people killed, burned, fire was all over. However, the Poles at that time they put up\na tremendous heroic, what do you call it -- heroic resistance.",
        "Q: How old were you at this time?",
        "A: I think I remember I was 12 years old.",
        "Q: How far was the distance between your town and Warsaw\u2019?",
        "A: Not far.",
        "Q: Did you walk or on a train?",
        "A: Only walking.",
        "Q: How long would it normally take to walk?",
        "A: It didn't take a day, I want you to know, because the carnage on the way was great. The\nartillery we had to go at midnight. Somehow I think it took two and half, three days until\nI made it in. It was like an inferno. Warsaw was an inferno.",
        "Q: Weren't you frightened?",
        "A: What do you think? I certainly was frightened.",
        "Q: You were a little boy.",
        "A: I was frightened because there were fires and we never knew running through the street\nwhether the building would collapse. And on top of it, since I was a little boy, after\ndelivery I was told by the Polish Army, and rightly so, to help dig ditches in case the\nGermans advance. They called anybody who could do something. I was frightened,\nthat's the answer.",
        "Q: When you were carrying all these goods to Warsaw, at this time you were asked to help\ndig ditches?",
        "A: I helped do what?",
        "Q: The Polish people, the Polish Army dig the ditches?",
        "A: The Army in Warsaw was preparing ditches against tanks, in case they advanced so any\nable bodied, any kid, anybody that could see on the street, they made him come and do it.",
        "Q: Were you traveling alone or with people?",
        "A: A party of one.",
        "Q: Tell me a little bit of what happened next, you made it to Warsaw?",
        "A: Well, there was starvation, and the worst thing there was no water. We were hiding in\nbasements. It was really mayhem. People would stand in line for bread, and artillery\nwould just mow them down and kill them. It was an inferno, fires all over. The funny\nthing, it was during the Jewish holiday, but Jews no matter what it is, what is was,\nwhoever had enough religious upbringing would hide in the underground and have the\nservices. Some of them stayed down there and were buried alive by the artillery. Not\njust artillery, but planes, where they would just circle the city and fire whoever they saw\nor just at random at any building.",
        "Q: Did you attend any of these services?",
        "A: I don't think so. No, I was impatient. I would have liked to go back, but somehow -- I\nhad other problems. We had no water and there was a river and we were all running for\nwater, to drink water. That's a very terrible deal when you have no water, and it was also\nvery dangerous because there were not the Germans. At that time they were\nshooting the people who came for water. So, some of them never came back. I was very\nlittle.",
        "Q: Did you see the shooting?",
        "A: Well, certainly. It wasn't shooting especially, it was bombarding, you know from the air.\nI either get trapped or I ran away. IfI get trapped, then I wait there.",
        "Q: What else can you describe about conditions at that time?",
        "A: Jewish people were very scared at that time. I think, or I heard that most of the\nbombardment at that time was directed to the Jewish quarter, most of the bombardment\nand I guess Jews were very much congregated in one area and the Germans were aware --\nin fact they were aware of everything, but this in Warsaw.",
        "Q: Were you hiding in this Jewish area?",
        "A: Yes, I was hiding in the Jewish area wherever I could.",
        "Q: Do you have any remembrance of any Polish catholic people you knew at this time. Did\nyour relationship with them change or did you separate?",
        "A: I think it was very much -- there were cold sufferers and they used to meet at the river if\nthey get water, and it didn't make at that point in time, it didn't make any difference\nwhether you were Jewish, Polish, catholic. At that point we were all Poles against the\nGermans. I want you to know the Jews were more interested to fight the Germans\nbecause they knew that they anticipated bad days.",
        "Q: How did that relationship start to change?",
        "A: At the time of bombardment, I think there was no animosity against each other because\nthere was normally a one enemy, which had to be scared of. There was no real\nanimosity. People would stand in line for bread whether they were Poles, Catholics,\nJews or anybody else. Each one was miserable.",
        "Q: Didn't that relationship, though, change?",
        "A: Not really, only after the war. It always changed later on.",
        "Q: That is not something you experienced?",
        "A: I did not experience anything like that.",
        "Q: I guess before we continue, when did you get any information about your parents.",
        "A: Let me tell you. As soon as the armistice was declared, the same day I picked up -- the\nrest of the children were still in Warsaw -- I picked up and got through the line, because\neven though there was an armistice, you didn't cross the line, the Germans. However,\nchildren they let through, and we went through, and we went up a few kilometers and all\nof sudden I found out what really happened. I went with another friend. He was not\nJewish, he was Catholic. We went back to the city and there was a German sentry and he\ncalled over because I did not know that they had at that time a curfew in the middle of the\nnight. So, the German soldier just grabbed me and slashed his throat. So, I understood\nright now that I have a lot of worries watching myself. In the morning I walked. I\ncouldn't go at night, in the evening. It took me another day to get through to see if I can\nmeet my parents. In the front of the city I had an uncle. He had a little restaurant. I\nwalked into this restaurant, nobody there. I got into that little city and all of a sudden I\nsee people that don't want to talk to me. Everytime I ask someone you know where are\nmy parents, they took off. That kind of feeling, maybe they escaped. So, I went into that\nlittle mill and people were robbing and I was just sitting until a man came over, a huge\nman, and he said \"These people are robbing this kid. He's just an orphan.\" I didn't\nunderstand him. Then my uncle came in and he says to me \"Don't you know about\n,\" that's the time I got immediately, and I couldn't believe\nit. I asked him where is it that they -- they are digging. I ran over and there was -- they\nwere trying to dig for the people. They were just not my parents, there were bombs and\nmaybe thirty people, twenty-five people in my uncle's restaurant's basement that were all\nkilled. They were all decimated. I took out and I recognized the skull and half of my\nfather's clothes, a little bit of my mother. I got very sick, and I walked out, then I knew\nfor sure that I didn't have any parents anymore. I got sick and dizzy and they took me to\nthe hospital. Then, of course, they were buried in a certain place. A few days later they\ntook the remains of all the people and I came there and I made a mark so I can find it and\nwell it comes later when I go fifty years later. That's how I met my parents again.",
        "Q: How long after the war began in Poland was this armistice when you went back to\nWarsaw\u2019?",
        "A: The armistice from the beginning it was about 30 days, the whole war, and mind you,\nfrom what I found out there were killed about 36 hours before the armistice they were\nbombed.",
        "Q: (Can't hear the tape)",
        "A: Yes, uncle, aunt, and other family, cousins.",
        "Q: (Can't hear the tape)",
        "A: Not all, but most.",
        "Q: What did you do after this?",
        "A: Well, I was there, no communication with the children. They came about a week later\nand of course, we didn't know what to do. We were orphans.",
        "Q: I just want to ask you one questions. In terms of the ages of your brothers and sisters,\nwere you little, were you young?",
        "A: I happened to be the third. We were six. I was the third.",
        "Q: So, you were there and you didn't know what to do?",
        "A: We didn't know what to do, and we were very depressed. Somehow, we found also our\napartment was bombed. We had to go in a little room. My sister had nothing to survive\non -- my sister tried to make some food for people. Sometimes German soldiers used to\ncome by and she would make some food for them in order to earn something. We stayed\nthere, what I remember is all of a sudden my sister disappeared, and we were left. I did\nnot know why, and I was very mad at her. But later I found out that the German soldiers\ntried to attack her. She was then, I think she was 17 years old. She was six years older\nthan me, so she just took off one day, and run abroad to Russia. See, the Russians took\nhalf of Poland, and the Germans took the other one. This was the real pact, the map\nwhich separated Poland. So, my sister took off, somehow at that time it was chaos.\nAnybody who could run across even though -- it wasn't easy, but she made it.",
        "Q: The German soldiers tried to rape her?",
        "A: They tried, yes, but she was ashamed to tell us, and she escaped, and she left us five in\nthat city. She was the cook. Again, we were out of business I think about two months.\nWe had to get out of there, out of the city.",
        "Q: I know this is a difficult question but did you find out later whether the Germans were\nable to rape her?",
        "A: I really don't know. Maybe she was just afraid, I don't know. I asked her and she would\nnever tell me, because she lives in San Francisco. I keep on asking.",
        "Q: So, you decided to get out of the city. Did you know people there? Were you neighbors\nstill there?",
        "A: In which city?",
        "Q: The little city?",
        "A: The people were still there, all of them, except those who were hurt by the bombs or\nthose who escaped to Warsaw. There were more or less -- 1t was right after the war and\nthey did not suffer too much. We suffered because we were orphans.",
        "Q: Nobody tried to take care of you?",
        "A: It was just everyone for himself.",
        "Q: So what did you all do?",
        "A: We got together the first night, my brothers and sisters, went back to Warsaw, and me\nand my little brother were left behind we could sell anything we had, and then we went to\nWarsaw. We all went to Warsaw. And of course, there was no place to be. It was\nalready around December. Somehow my older brother, who was a university student got\ntogether with this professor to place us in an orphanage. He couldn't take care of us\neither. He was about 19 years old. So, he took us over. He had another one by the name\nof Adolf Therman who was the head of the Health and Children.",
        "Q: But this is the same --",
        "A: I don't know. I knew him by the name of Adolf, because eventually I worked with him in\nGhetto. They took us over across to place, at that time, and they separated\nmy two little sisters. Also, at the place there was a place for girls and me\nand my younger brother over there. My older brother suffered probably\n, and I don't remember how he was existing, but later on I think he had a\njob.",
        "Q: So, you went to the orphanage you think about December of '39?",
        "A: It was close to January already. I'm sorry the exact dates I just don't know. I could know\nif I could concentrate.",
        "Q: What was the orphanage like?",
        "A: It was a big building, many children over there. It was an organized like a government\ninside the orphanage. Each one had his own supposed to do certain things. They had a\ncourt, they had people older people who took care of the youngsters to see that they\nwashed, they cleaned. There were people who had to make up the beds. It was just like\nan internal -- they had a court, if someone deviated from certain things, he was punished.\nThe doctor was just going around. He knew that you're going to do it right. However, I\npersonally was a rebel in this, because most of the kids were just orphans since they were\nchildren. They knew their ways. I was very bitter. I was bitter that all of sudden my\nfather used to care about orphans, and all of a sudden I'm an orphan. So, I did not go\naccording to regulations. I used to run away to my brother's all the time, and I did not -- I\nwould say I was not a good boy there.",
        "Q: Did they assign you certain jobs or duties?",
        "A: We used to get jobs, you know, cleaning dishes. Cleaning . I don't\nremember. I don't recall, but I tried to get away from it because I was not used to the kids\nand them with the routines. To me it wasn't routine. It was like punishment.",
        "Q: Now, did you get punished by the court?",
        "A: I was not punished, in fact they made me part of the court, because I was an older boy.\nSomehow, the regimentation down there, I wasn't too respected because I was fresh one,\nyou know. But they tried to give me some responsibilities.",
        "Q: How many people were in the court?",
        "A: I really can't recall, but I would say it was over a hundred.",
        "Q: Do you remember liking any of the staff or any relationships with them?",
        "A: Oh yes, with the older ones. We had beds of 30 to 40 in a room, and we had to have\nfriends at night. We tried to get into mischief. I know now, kids are mischievous. On\nthe signal to go to sleep, we pretended we were going to sleep, but we used to talk a lot. I\nhad friends.",
        "Q: What did you talk about?",
        "A: Well, let me tell you, mostly child talk, because these children down there, they were\nraised differently. I was born, I mean I was raised and I spoke Yiddish quite a bit, but\nthey spoke Polish only. Their vision of life was different because he taught them\nhe really taught them discipline. They were schooled and schooled in\ncertain areas, they were way ahead of me. A few friends I had.",
        "Q: Were you going to school at that time?",
        "A: Well, from what I know now, officially we're not supposed to have schooling. There was\nno schooling any more, no school outside, but inside there were certain people who\nworked there for years and they were teachers and they gave us lesson. I wouldn't say\nthat I attended them, but I did.",
        "Q: What do you remember about the orphanage that you appreciated?",
        "A: First of all the food. I appreciated the food because three times a day we were eating. It\nwas just the beginning of the war. America was not at war then and they used to ship\nfrom Switzerland or from other areas, they used to ship food, so there was no scarcity of\nfood, but I appreciated that because between the time I got into the orphanage and I lived\nin a room somewhere with my brothers and sisters, we had no food. That's what I\nappreciated.",
        "Q: Any other good memories about the orphanage?",
        "A: Yes, I had very good memories, very good memories, but I was bitter because I couldn't--\nI think I was bitter because I couldn't imagine that I'll ever be an orphan at one time. I\nused to know orphans, you know either the father died, or the mother died and they put\nthem in, but all of a sudden I had both gone, and what hurts me more is that I had a\ncouple of sisters there. I don't think the very young even knew that she didn't have.\nThere was a little girl, she must be four years old. She was taken in, but she was asking a\nlittle bit about her parents. That hurts me, but otherwise I think I was stronger at time. I\ntook it the way it was, because I was very happy they took me into that orphanage. I\nalready seen young kids going around and asking for bread, but whether I was happy or\nunhappy, I don't know, but I appreciated being there.",
        "Q: Did you spend time with your sisters and brother in the orphanage?",
        "A: I used to see him not very often because all of a sudden, my older sister was very\nknowledgeable -- my younger sister. But the rest of them, they were very young, they\ngot involved in playing, involved in the procedure of the place. They had little\ngirlfriends. That's it.",
        "Q: So anything else you can remember about the original orphanage, the way it was run, the\nteachers, the cultural activities?",
        "A: I already told you it was run like a government. This guy, I didn't see him very often I\nwant you to know, but whenever I seen him, he was very lenient man. He if a kid was\nsick he would go by and pat him. He was very good, because I remember he even used\nto take out the excrement in the morning. He got up very early. I don't remember him\nvery well because I was a stranger down there. He figured that probably that I am not his\nin Polish they call it . He did not raise me, you understand? He more or\nless, he liked more the kids which he raised. Don't forget that he was the kind of a man\nhe read a lot of books which as I a child I was reading. Only of us children, all kinds of\nmysteries about how children behave and and we used to have theaters there\ntoo. We used to have what do you call , all kind of marionettes. In\nthe beginning of the war you could do almost a lot of things, but the Germans were not\norganized yet. They couldn't cope with a half a million Jews, and the Jews were not, at\nthat time, segregated.\nTape #2",
        "Q: Any other memories of ?",
        "A: Other than seeing them go out, we were waiting for him a lot of times. He was busy\nalmost every day, going out and arranging for help. This orphanage was very organized.\nIt was, I think at that time, it was even run by the Polish, by the city, but there were\nmany, many orphanages at that time in Warsaw. I am going to run away from myself.\nThat's how we organized later when I had to leave. I haven't got too many memories of\nthat man because I was there only a short time. He would go around and check, ask if we\nhad enough to eat maybe comfort me once in a while, say everything will work out, and\nthe staff was very nice. The staff there understood that I was just a freshly baked orphan,\nso they were nice to me. They knew also that I had a brother, a little brother, my two\nsisters and so that's all I remember.",
        "Q: Do you remember any of the in particular, Stephan?",
        "A: Stephan, yes I saw her once in a while. An elderly lady who was very nice. That's all I\nknow, and I used to ask her how my little sisters are. She said don't worry about them.\nThey are fine. I used to come in and she's show me the little children were dancing. I\nthink my little one forgot all about my parents. She was involved in the life. The older\none --.",
        "Q: How long were you in the orphanage?",
        "A: The best that I can recall I would say almost two months.",
        "Q: Then what happened?",
        "A: Then he organized, we must have organized it before, there was a place somewhere in\nWarsaw, in the Jewish district and they called that -- they took all the older boys down\nthere all the freshly orphans which they took in, boys only, and they organized what they\ncalled a House of Boys, under their supervision, but they had a different administrator.\nThat administrator was a professor, a Jewish professor. So, they took us, this guy would\nand other guys who were approximately over 11 years old, and they\norganized a new home. This home was, again, they tried to get us to gover -- which\nyou'll see in this little book and it was very nice, I want you to know.",
        "Q: What was the name of the Professor?",
        "A: From what I remember, I did not remember, but my friend told me it was",
        "Q: How many boys were at this House of Boys?",
        "A: Eventually they took a lot of boys off the street, too, and I would think I would say\nbetween 70, around there, 80. My little brother could have stayed with him, but he didn't\nwant to stay. He wanted to go with me. We were both there",
        "Q: What was different from this orphanage from the other orphanage?",
        "A: It was completely different. The task of this place was we should be more or less\nresponsible even economically for everything. They used to send children like to barbers\nwhere they cleaned up. They used to send people to shoemakers they should help. They\nused to send people out, the little older boys, because they were up to 15, 16, some of\nthem even had a little children. Normally in Europe, if a kid finished school, he became\nan apprentice somewhere. So, people used to make money, kids used to make money and\nthey would take the money and buy food. In other words, you almost had to be self\nsufficient.",
        "Q: What kind of work did you do?",
        "A: I did all kinds of jobs. My first job was I worked with very responsible people who were\ndirecting the food distribution for all orphanages in Warsaw.",
        "Q: Were these Jewish people.",
        "A: Jewish people, only in the Jewish district. I can't tell you when it happened, but I can tell\nyou what happened, because we at that point, a Ghetto, I mean were all together. Jews\nwere separated, not completely yet, but they were separated. And we used to go out to all\nkinds of work. I worked with this -- he liked me this guy, and he directed the food\ndistribution. He directed the people, had to hide whatever they had, the Germans would\nconfiscate everything for free. So, they used to hide things in the cellars, wherever they\ncould and then bring it up, because the American was already working there\nfor orphanages, and I was there working. They used to bring all their wares, their\nsamples and they would distribute all the samples. They didn't give them any money, but\nthey gave them certain numbers in Switzerland that later on they'll be able to collect.\nNow, I know they never collected. But my job was . We used to -\n- we didn't have any horses or anything, we used to have a little buggy, long buggy, one\non the side and I on other side and we would pull from place to place and distribute food.\nThis I got so many bread. That was my first job. It lasted something like three months.\nThen I had other jobs.",
        "Q: Do you want to tell me about your other jobs?",
        "A: You keep asking me because the last job was the job where I could not come back to the\norphanage anymore.",
        "Q: So, let's talk more about the orphanage. So, you remember, this orphanage were you\naccepted a little more or were you still --?",
        "A: It was more responsible. We were older kids. We were reading newspapers. And I want\nyou to know, it went like a university. In this orphanage you had the biggest I would say\ndoctors, the Germans as a rule tried to kill whether they were Poles or Jews all the\nintelligent, all the professors, doctors and colleges, all of them, so at this orphanage we\nhad even though we knew who they were, but we had the very educated, most educated\nof Warsaw and surrounding. They were professors, they were the chief rabbis of a city\ncalled . They were they liked me, one guy wanted the best\nchore. There were other professors who were hiding there. They were cleaning, they\nwere cooking in order not to be discovered by these Germans. And since they worked in\norphanages, I don't think the Germans checked too well. There were a few times they\ntook out some. So, at night we were not allowed to go to school -- when night came after\nsupper, what I know now how education goes, we had a terrific lectures on everything.\nIn other words, it was something like a university. All the boys would sit down and they\nwould give us lectures in history, Jewish history and then they would always give us\ngeography and any other arithmetic every other night another professor would start\nteaching us. Then the rabbi would teach us Judaism. It was like a university.",
        "Q: You appreciated this?",
        "A: Very much. I wouldn't miss those things. I couldn't understand you know, I used to go\nto public school and I didn't finish, so I couldn't understand how nicely the interpreter\nwas.",
        "Q: Do you remember what street this orphanages was on?",
        "A: Yes 1t was on Gesha 6.",
        "Q: Do you remember any particular professors who were here that you remember their\nnames?",
        "A: Those who were officially -- there was like people who worked there and they were also\nvery educated people because they tried to -- you had to a lot of influence to get off the\nstreet of Warsaw and work in orphanages. But at that same time they had to have a\ncertain amount of education.",
        "Q: I was just asking for the record were there any younger leaders or professors there that\nyou can remember their names?",
        "A: I really cannot recall names, but I know some of them didn't even give their real names\nbecause they were hiding. They didn't want to be killed by the Gestapo.",
        "Q: In the orphanages, either of them, did you observe the Sabbath and the Jewish holidays?",
        "A: Why certainly, definitely. We were all Jewish kids and there was a chief rabbi down\nthere.",
        "Q: Friday evening there were special ceremony.",
        "A: It was special. We maybe had a little more bread and we were singing the songs.",
        "Q: You rested on Saturday?",
        "A: Not all of us. Those who had to work, and even some of them worked with the Germans\noutside the area and they had to go.",
        "Q: What was involved with in this orphanage. Did he come by?",
        "A: He supervised and he came by I would say very often. He would stop by and check with\nthe and he would recognize us. He would check to see with they guys who\nwere running it. He felt that this was his responsibility, because a lot of them other than\nme they were also his kids who were brought up by him.",
        "Q: How long did you stay at the House for Boys?",
        "A: I would say about a year and a half.",
        "Q: Your brother also?",
        "A: My little brother, too.",
        "Q: Did you make good friends in this orphanage?",
        "A: Oh yes. In fact, they used to bring new ones from the area, very nice educated kids, those\nwho were qualified they brought into work.",
        "Q: Was there an effort, now that the war was on and everybody's motives were changed so\nmuch, that they let in a lot more people who's orphanages --",
        "A: I don't know anything about before the war, but I'll tell you they did not they couldn't get\ninto our place because the rooms, the area was very small and we had 30 40 people in a\nroom. I don't think they could absorb more but they did not have a place for them.",
        "Q: Did you notice maybe that wanted to protect everyone who needed\nprotection at the time so he opened more places?",
        "A: I have heard at that time that he was very influential even with the city who was catholic,\nbut they respected him and I think he did open a few more somewhere. If he didn't open\nofficially, he took them off the streets.",
        "Q: I've heard some crazy stories about , he's a character.",
        "A: Well, I would compare him to a hippie, I want you to know. He never dressed, you\nknow, and he wasn't really sophisticated. He was just like a hippie.",
        "Q: He seemed to be able to help people, get money and really accomplished something\nincredible.",
        "A: What they tried to do 1n this orphanage, they tried to make human beings out of us under\nthe worst circumstances because inside we were like an island. Outside it was hell, a real\nhell. People were dying of starvation and even in the beginning they were dying of\nstarvation, people some of their parents left for Russia, left the wife with the children. It\nwas very bad outside. Here you tried to organize it in such a way that everyone either\nworked or if you couldn't find work give him a trade inside. Little kids became shoe\nmakers, cabinet makers. They brought up old tools.",
        "Q: You said that you had other jobs?",
        "A: Yes, and this was my downfall. I had other jobs where they used to send me I guess what\nhappened is I wasn't strong enough to pull the buggy so they sent me they had other jobs,\nto send me to people in factories where they were making clothes. But my last job, that\nwas my downfall. That was my downfall. They sent me to a factory outside the Ghetto.\nI had to go at 5:00 in the morning. You had to go with the German sentries. If they\nwanted to warm themselves up, they would chase me around just for exercise. They\nwould chase me around and around and made me run. It was bad. So, I went through it\nwas a problem in Ghetto a big foundry, a big factory run by Germans and some Jews who\nbefore the war were foremen. I used to get up in the morning hoping that I would get to\neat something. But somehow they didn't give me any food and the job was very horrid. I\nhad to pick up 30 or 40 pounds of burned up steel and throw them into the fire walking\non the . I was very week. I couldn't do the job. I was always thinking to\nescape. It was horrible. So eventually some Polish people who worked with me, they\ngive me a piece of bread. I was still hungry. The orphanage -- the people were still\nsleeping while I was going to work. I wasn't the only one, in other places they woke up\nearly. So, around noon time -- this was my downfall, maybe you should understand, I\nwas very hungry, hard work for now I know for a boy was terrible. I had to walk up with\na load of 40 or 50 pounds. Finally around noon time it wasn't arranged for me to have\nfood and the Poles give me a little bread but they didn't have themselves. They were\nworking people, hard working people, and I explained I came from the orphanage\nbecause I had to keep up with them and I couldn't keep up. I think I was about 14 years\nold, and I wasn't too strong either. So, they took pity on me and they helped me a little\nbit, but I was still hungry. What my downfall is, it started with a dog. These people who\nran the place they had their own big house next to it. They were German soldiers and\nGerman civilians because most of this was going for the armaments. They were making\npresses there and everything. Somehow they were always happened, but I noticed that\nthe dog gets a lot of food after lunch. The dog got a lot of food but I couldn't reach it.\nEverytime I went by I wanted to grab something. Finally I got acquainted over a week\nor two he would finish eating I would grab some. He was happy, and it was good stuff\nfor the dog. I ate it and I felt good. So one day, I could always get after he was finished.\nIf not, he would growl. That was one day one of the foreman, I don't know if he was\nJewish or non-Jewish, came out and grabbed me and slapped me and hit me. You go\ntaking away the food of the dog. Don't you get enough food. I was working there for\ntwo weeks, I had no food. Nevertheless, he called a couple of other Germans over and he\nshamed me in front of them. Because I know it wasn't the first time I got hurt that way,\nbut , he had engineering place, all kinds of instruments and a Polish\nengineer was there and he started hitting me again. Aren't you ashamed he said. You're a\nJewish boy, to do those things. When he hit me very hard, I got very excited and figured\nthat's the end of me. I grabbed a inch by inch a steel ruler and I grabbed it\ninstantly without thinking and hit him in the glasses and I think I blinded him. I escaped.\nI could run through before the assessment checked by paper I was gone already anyhow,\nbut I had legitimate papers anyhow to go from the Ghetto, and I was afraid to go back in.\nThen my little brother came out at night. I was I think sleeping over at my brother's. He\nsaid, don't go there. The Jewish police are looking for you and if you go in there you\nmight compromise the whole place. I don't know to this day what happened to that man,\nbut I know the glasses and blood was running out. From then on I became what we call\nin the Ghetto, a wild boy. My brother didn't have enough food, so to tell you it was\nhorrible. I used to wake up 5:00 in the morning hoping there would be a lot of dead\npeople on the street. Hoping I don't know maybe it was just that I wanted to live, but\neveryday hundreds of people would lay down and die. They couldn't either take it\nanymore or sick or just froze to death or gave up. I used to wake up 5:00 in the morning,\nI wasn't the only one I want you to know, and kind of stuffed my hands in the pockets of\nthose half dead or dead people and whatever bread -- in Warsaw everybody you couldn't\ngo away without a piece of bread. I got a piece of bread here, a piece of bread here.\nSometimes a dead person I would even take off a watch too, to help myself. That's how I\ngot breakfast, and some of it I had for lunch. Some of the time I was beaten up. They\nused to smuggle in potatoes. If something fell I would grab and they would run after me\nand beat the hell out of me. Hygiene, very dirty. There was no place to take a shower\nany more. You go around desperate. So, finally I decided I'm going to go out to the\nother side. I didn't run away but to go out for some food. One incident I want to tell you.\nSo, the situation was very bad. Children, especially elderly people would be laying\ndown there dead either of typhus or any other sickness or just frozen to death because\nthey had no place to stay or they gave up. I decided with other kids we're going to take a\nchance. They used to take out groups to work outside the Ghetto so we were to get in\nthere and as soon as we passed, the Germans did not especially check those who went\nout, they only checked those who came back, so we used to go and beg for food. One\ntime, very early, I and two more friends, I'm sorry do you want me to tell you this is just\nthe gist of one event. We're trying to get in and beg for food. We have learned already a\nlittle bit how to greet catholic people in their way. So, it was about a four or five story\nbuilding and right after the curfew we got in there the superintendent opened there's a\ncertain gate, and each one of us went to a different floor. I knocked on the door. A\nwoman looks and me and I try to cross myself and say whatever I knew and say what I\nhad to. She said to me, \"Look, you don't have to do that. I know who you are.\" I\nprobably wasn't the first boy to beg for food, but she was all messed up. A nice woman\nand the first thing she asked me to take off my clothes and she prepared some hot water\nand especially we had so many lice on us they were eating us alive. We did not look\ngood. That's how they recognized us anyhow. So, she said don't worry about it. Take it\noff and I'll burn it. I will cook it. Then she was cooking for me something like\nbuckwheat. And they were poor themselves. She didn't have anything to give other than\nto cook something. And I was hungrier than hell. She sat down with me and I think she\nwas a good woman, but all of a sudden she started talking religion to me. She said it's\nsuch a pity that you Jewish children can not go to kingdom of heaven and he had to bring\nHitler a man, the destroyer. I kind of looked at her and I figured I was brought up\nreligious in other ways, but I figured she's good, so I said okay. Well, I understand, but\nwhat can we do we're hungry. All of a sudden we were sitting down there and I didn't eat\nyet. I hear a shot. The superintendent of the building must have called up the police, the\nlocal police and I looked down and one of my friends was shot. He was shot in the leg\nand he fell. I didn't know what happened yet to the guy on the second floor, but that\nwoman, we realized first I said hide me somewhere. So, she took me in a closet, in\nEurope they have, like you have hear, where you hang your clothes, inside they have\noutside, and she put me in there and she locked me up. She covered me with all kinds of\nfurs, whatever was in there and took the key out and went to the neighbors. She was\nafraid that if they catch me down there, they'll kill her too. So, she went to the neighbors,\nand I was lucky she took out the key with her so I didn't have any air. I was holding my\nnose against, and I was sweating and I thought this is the end. They'll probably ask the\nother kid on the second floor what happened, where I am who is the other one because\nthe superintendent saw three kids coming, three Jewish kids. Well, I was there, running\nwas water, I thought this is the end of me. I couldn't breath. I think I passed out for a\nwhile. All of a sudden I hear a scream and I thought it was German, but it wasn't, it was\na husband and coming back and screaming. He was a good man, he says look you have\nto kill us. He was a railroad man, but don't suffocate him. When they took me out, I\ndidn't go out, I fell out. But he was a good man, and he hid me with neighbors. Gave me\nnew clothes because my clothes were wet. He was still cooking and food and everything\nand at night he took me through because he worked with the German Army and he was\nvery connected with the police and I went through with a lot of food. He gave me food\nand everything I brought in I think two weeks I ate. I had food for two weeks. What I'm\ntrying to tell you is an accident again, I had to hide because the other kid was beaten to\nhell, almost dead. The guy on the second floor. I don't know what happened to the first\nfloor whether they took him back to the hospital or not. I never met him. This kid, the\nother one, told on me and again I had to change clothes. I had to make myself all kind of\ndirty things on it because I was cleaned up already, and they didn't recognize me. But I\nwas sought again by the Jewish police because the German gave him the description, who\nIam. Finally I think it's impossible for me to be there. I am going to die there. I went\nover to my brother. I didn't even bother telling my younger brother, because we were\nclose. I said to my older brother, I said look I want on the other side, some of them\nrecognized, some of them didn't recognize. I am going to escape. Whatever happens,\nhappens, but I'm not going to die here like the rest of the kids. So, he says look, tell me\nsomething, you go because there's no hope here. I'll take you through. The way they\ntook through people was they went to work outside and they could squeeze me, but he\nwas already an educated guy. He belonged to a group they were revisionists, a group, a\nZionist group and I guess he was more or less in underground already. They had certain\nconnections with people in Slovakia so he kind of drew up a map for me if I get over\nthere. He drew up amap. You take this boat. There was a boat going. There was a rive\nin Poland which goes through the whole country. When you hit under the\ntry to go across and we have connections with these people who are saving Jews. So, he\ngave me a map and everything, gave me a few dollars, whatever he had and whatever I\nhad, not much, and to go and get a ticket. I walked out of the group which went to work\nand ran away. I want to tell you, he helped me, my brother he gave me whatever money\nhe had. He bought a little jacket for me and a little hat and proper shoes, not too good but\nshoes. I went out there and I went to get a ticket and I went to get a ticket and I hesitated,\nI was moving back, because there was a line of people, to go or not to go, because I think\nonly older people go and I was just a little kid in between. So, I moved out, all of\nsudden, with a German he asked me he says to me he grabbed me he says listen to me,\ndon't go in there in German they said they'll you. They will finish you off\nin German. I pretended I didn't know a word of German. So I was saying again in Czech\nagain. He got mad and he started talking in Polish. He knew both languages. He said\nyou get the hell away from here. They will kill you. I have an idea after today, he was\nan angel and he saved me. But where do I go. I had a map, about a journey of two days\nhit the in Poland, and 1 don't know where to go so I went to the Central\nStation. I went to Central Station but my heart was pumping. I didn't know whether they\nwould recognize me, if they want to recognize me, but it looked like nobody paid\nattention to me. I had a piece of bread. This was early in the morning when I got out,\nand where do you go. Finally, I was afraid to go because to go into that Central Station\nentrance because there were so many German SS around there checking for ;\nwhich means you had to have some kind of a -- something who you are. They called\nthem , and I had nothing. Where do you go, so I was just roaming around\nthe street and I reminded myself my father used to go once in a while took me with him\nto a rabbi, a big they had those semitic groups and they used to he was maybe 60\nkilometers outside of Warsaw. But they had a little train there. It wasn't large rails and\nsmall and it sort of dragged into that little city. So I said maybe down there there won't\nbe so many soldiers. And sure enough, I went down there, it was near dusk, I figured if it\nget a little dusk nobody will recognize me anyhow. So, I got up, but I was afraid to buy a\nticket. I got up without a ticket and I figured if they catch me I'll take out some money\nand give the conductor. They weren't Germans, they were just Polish workers. So, I sat\ndown amongst the women. They were smugglers. They would smuggle in food to\nWarsaw and buy clothes there. This was their job. So amongst them I sat between them\nthey asked me where do you come from? What are you doing here? I told them, listen\nmy father was a soldier -- I made it up-- I father was in the army and he was killed. I am\nlooking for my mother because my father lived in the German occupied area and my\nmother took off and she's supposed to be around this area. So, they started giving me\nsalami, food, anything what I wanted. When the conductor came he, they said you don't\ntouch that kid. In other words, they felt sorry for me because my father was killed. I\ndon't know how I got that idea, but it came into me the last minute when I asked me what\nam I doing. I didn't have a ticket. I was still scared. When the rail -- the locomotive\nslowed down and the front of that city 1t was called and in the front of\nthat city there were a lot of Germans waiting I guess checking on those people who were\nsmuggling and when it was slowing up, it was dark already, and I jumped off. Where do\nyou go now? I was just running in the direction of the end of the train. Dark, I went\nthrough a little river up to here, and down across was a forest and I didn't know, you\nwouldn't believe it, I was hoping to God and I was sorry I left Warsaw. I was real sorry,\nbecause I didn't know where to go. It was dark, cold, wet. I couldn't sleep. In the\nmorning some elderly lady, a woman, was carrying a can of milk to distribute. I asked\nhere where am I. I spoke very good Polish. I was very good at it. She says, first she\ngave me a little bit milk. She says you're so wet, what happened? I said I got in in that\nriver and I don't know where -- I got lost. There's a little city called Varka (ph), not far,\nyou go there. I think it was Sunday morning, I figured I'm going to go. What do you do?\nI went to that little city in the morning and the sun came out and I dried out and I see all\nthe people are going to church, so I went down there to. I was afraid to stay behind\nsomeone else's house, and I seen a lot of those very old ladies sat down begging and\npeople would give them. I sat down too, but on the side I wanted to dry out. One woman\ncame over and said, \"What are you doing little boy here between all these old people?\" I\nsaid I don't know. I haven't got any money and I have a family. My father was killed. I\nused it, I knew it worked. My father was killed -- they took out pieces of bread they gave\nme. Other people said this was an orphan. His father was killed. They gave me bread\nand little pieces of sausage. In the meantime I dried out and they gave me a few dollars,\na few . The first few dollars I had. They were selling crosses down there in\nfront of the church. I gave the few dollars to that guy, and I got myself a very large size\nof across. I figured it's going to help. And I continued that day, I stuck around in that\ncity. I went again, I was afraid to stay there. I was always worried if they ar going to\nrecognize me or not. I figured if I keep going, I'll be dried out. It's a small village. So, I\nwent through like a forest, and in this forest the German firm was cutting trees, I think for\nthe coal mines, the mines. There was a sign that was two days later -- there was sign\nwhoever works will get so many marks. In the mill in the forest they had like a trailer\nthere and it wasn't army. These were people, 1t was a company with Germans who were\npreparing those trees, and a lot of Poles were working there. I went over and I asked for\najob. I asked for a job and the woman she spoke German and Polish you know. To the\nGerman she spoke German, to me she spoke Polish. Don't you think you're a little bit too\nyoung. You had to be sixteen years old. But I was very skinny too on top of it. Don't\nyou think you're too young. You can't work because you're too young. So, one of the\nother Germans, a foreman said, and I understood what he was saying, tell me you'll take\nhim in and they'll let him clean up around us. Clean up the trailer. I'm telling you, as\nsoon as she said can you clean a little bit, nobody ever cleaned better than I did. I did a\ngood job. Then she asked me do you have anything to show who you are? I gave the\nsame story, my father was killed. I came from a certain city, North Poland, and I have\ngot nothing. She said, \"I'll tell you what. You work here next week. I'll go with you to\nanother village. We'll make a photograph of you, a picture and then I'll send it into the\ncity and they'll bring you a work card. I don't know, I think luck was with me at that\ntime. When she said I can have a work card, and she was good to me, because I really\nwashed and cleaned and helped. It so happened I got a work card, and I worked there for\nquite a while, maybe five or six weeks, until they liquidated the work place. We cut\nenough trees probably. They hauled them away in trucks. They hauled them away in\ntrucks. Now, where do you go now?",
        "Q: Had you changed your name for the work card?",
        "A: Why certainly, at that time my name was , with a W. I figured I can't\nkeep my real name. I had to have a Polish name, a Christian Name, and they used to call\nme , So I didn't know what to do. Where do you go? Finally, they were\nasking, I went to another village. I already had a few dollars. The foreman gave me\nmoney. I was a polishing their boots, they had some horses, I was cleaning the horses, so\nI had quite a few marks at that time. So, I went to a small little village and then they had\na sign. I stayed by people. They slept on the floor and they told me there's a place where\nthey're looking for hands, working hands to help on the farm. And I have to go to the\nhead of the area, who was naturally a German, a commandant and these people used to\ncome and take the workers. They wanted them to have a lot of workers, because they\nwere supplying food for the Germans. The Germans were confiscating food at that time.\nSo, I came into a big place there, and I registered my name take a look I got working\npapers. They didn't ask me any questions. And a guy on a horse and buggy took me to\nhis farm, and I had to start working on a farm. They didn't know who I was, whether I\nwas Jewish. I had certain problems there. After a week or two I had to go to confession.\nNow, my father never went to confession, my grandfather neither, and I didn't know\nwhat to say either. I understood what it's all about because the son of the owner had to go\nand went with me. We went later than the people. He went in down there and I'm telling\nyou my heart is just pumping, what am I going to tell the priest. What do you tell a\npriest, you know, I didn't understand. I never did it. Somehow I heard it. I was so\nscared I put my ear to the little entrance. It was a little bit ajar and I understood what he\nsaid and I asked him, he said just tell him that you didn't do anything wrong. I went in\nthere and repeated the same thing. I repeated the same thing and somehow it didn't work.\nHe took me out, it was a man I would say over eighty for sure, a priest. And he asked\nme, tell me your parents were not from the old religion , L understood\nthat if you didn't say they were not Jews I understood right away that he was not such a\nbad man. If he would have been a bad man and said they were not Jews, but somehow he\nwas very delicate about it. I asked what kind of people are those , he\nkind of winked at me and said if you don't know, you don't know, but an old man wore\nthose long robes, and I think, today, he recognized me, I was Jewish. I did not do the\nright thing I know it, but he took advantage of me later, you know every time I had to\nclean up behind him in his room, he made me do it.\nTape #3",
        "Q: When we stopped, you were telling me about the priest who sort of recognized you but\ndidn't acknowledge you.",
        "A: He was a very nice man. He never bothered me. I think he recognized me and I did\nsome chores for him so I didn't have to go back to confessions. On a whole he was a\nheck of a nice man, because I used to go every other Sunday to him. And I worked on a\nfarm, and I did anything people had to do on a farm and of course, since I was not used to\nit, it was horrid, but I was very happy. I had food. The people down there treated me\nwell. I worked -- I think I ran out of work and to the best of my recollection I needed\nmoney because I didn't get too much money from the men but they gave me food,\nclothes, very nice catholic people. So, I worked for a baker. I went to work in a small\nlittle village not far. A little city for a baker, the place was called Garbutka (ph).\nWorking for the baker, he was a very nice man, and I worked all night. From what I can\nrecollect, that's the first time I found out of the Holocaust with him. Once we were\nthrough we sat down outside to rest. It was like it wasn't even daybreak yet. A train\nwent down not far. A train went down there not far from there and he said\nyou know something, these Germans are going to pay, and they're going to pay heavily\nfor the kind of barbarism they are doing now. He told me in Polish. He was mad. He\nwas a good man, and he said, you know something, these trains which you see going\nthrough, they are burning people alive and getting them through the chimneys and Jews.\nI heard that and everything inside of me started shaking. I did not believe it, you know. I\ndidn't believe it that this could happen, something like that. They're burning -- I looked\nat him but I said I got very good information that that's what they do to people. One day\nthey will pay for it. I was uneasy already, very uneasy. And I heard, not far from there\nthere was a little Jewish Ghetto. That Ghetto was --what they did the Germans got\ntogether shoemakers, what do you call it, tailors, other let's say people who were good in\ncertain trades. They got them together, and they worked for the Germans. This was\nalready after they liquidated most of the Ghettos, and these people were living maybe a\ncouple hundred of them and one man a shoemaker used to come to me the baker and he\nused to hide his shoes. I think he recognized me that I was Jewish. A very nice man, and\nhe told me about the Jewish Ghetto, because he used to get out of the Ghetto, all the\nshoes, bring them into Ghetto, make some money and brought them back to the village,\nmade some money and came back. One day, being in this little village, something must\nhave happened some provocation or something, the Polish people around there were\ndoing something, the underground which wasn't to the Gestapo liking. They must have\ndone something bad. I didn't know anything about it. All of a sudden, I want to tell you\nsomething, my mother comes to my dream she says listen -- everytime something\nhappened bad my mother came to my dream. She said in the morning you run away from\nthere, and with that kind of thought I wake up and I , they are shooting\npeople all over the village. They are shooting people in the village. I kind of remember,\nbut it was hard to escape.",
        "Q: Who and why were they shooting in the village?",
        "A: What I'm trying to tell you is they had some kind --from what I know now, I didn't know\nthen, there was a provocation, the underground, the Polish underground probably robbed\nor took a lot of food out of the trains which went to the front. So they brought some kind\nof punishment, a company of Ukrainian all kinds of real butchers and they started killing\npeople on the street. I look out and the priest was even taken in chains. I was looking\nout and I figured I'm going to run. And I think I was running better than Tarzan and I\nran, but the wheat was that high and in Poland they did not have big estates, just small\nlittle parcels of land. So, in between there was one parcel of land and the other, there was\nwhat they called in Polish , like little streets, and they were having a guns\nmachine guns down there. Anything moves, boom. I got in between and I want to tell\nyou I was going and I figured this is the end, and I kind of ducked every minutes. After\nthey shot, I got through. I finally got through and where do I go now. I remind myself\nabout that Jewish Ghetto. I'm going to run there, and it was about a couple kilometers\nthere. I was running away in my shorts. My whole body was full of blood from I was on\nmy chest walking on my chest because I was afraid if I put my head up that was the end.\nWell, I finally reached that place and they let me in. The Jewish people were watching\nthemselves too. They didn't know yet, but they had an idea. They heard all the shooting\nand I told them what happened. I told them listen I'm Jewish let me into this group, and I\ntold him about that man who used to hold my shoes down there. Sure enough they went\nin there and he came in and took me into his house. It was very early. I was a stranger.\nEverybody was sleeping yet. His wife, he woke up his wife to wash me up, because I\nwas full of blood, and I was sitting figuring, what kind of life was that. I was really\ndisgusted. I could have been killed a couple hours ago. All of a sudden I seen the same\nGerman marching in on this place. I was a stranger and sitting behind the door and\npeople were still sleeping behind every little house seven Germans, SS men would stand\nthere, their guns pulled out and one of them, all of a sudden I saw that this must be the\nend. But I was behind the door, a stranger, and they opened the door. They went to\nevery home, and all of a sudden one of them walks in and said all the men out. I never\nknew that so many men were in one little house. This guy -- so I look out through that\nwindow, through that opening, boom. Everybody that walks out boom, got a bullet right\nin the back of the head. At that moment, you wouldn't believe it, I saw myself dying\nthere, and I saw a film in front me, all my life, I saw like a fast film, my life and I figured\nthis is it there where I lay. Now, I turned into glue, I tell you. There was no escape. One\nguy was outside chasing out and the rest of them were shooting, one by one, in every\nhouse in front of them. The German who was chasing out, took me by my back and\npulled me and I didn't give a damn. I didn't want to go. I knew I'm going to be dead and\nI was half conscious. So, there was one of them in the front a tall SS man. I don't know\nwhat happened but he turns me around and says in German , he's a\nlittle boy. go back. He looked me in the eyes and go back. I want to go\nback, but I'll never forget that guy who chased out everybody from the house, a big\nGerman like this, and assessment aren't you killed yet? I started begging\nhim. He didn't shoot inside, he was holding the gun like that, but the women all of a\nsudden they saw what was happening they tore me out of his hand. The women, because\nthey -- they killed some women, I found out later, those who resisted killing their\nhusbands or their sons. Somehow there was scattering all those Germans so this German\nlet them tear me out and he went outside to shoot others and they told me in this little\nroom, the next room, the Germans were not there. They tore off the door and I go in\nthere. There was a lady there who started crying. To the other women you brought us an\nangle of death to me, that I am going to spoil it for them. And they had a\na little basement and one side was a bath the other side and a basement\nabout three by three. They must have been hiding food or something because it wasn't\nvery deep and the old man, the woman's husband was shaking he was afraid to go down.\nHe was an old man. And I got the idea if he go down I'll go down with him. There was\nno escape. These two girls, one that mentioned, the two girls one of them didn't let me in\nand the other one said let him in. Finally they pushed the father in because the SS, the\nGermans were running around looking for men to shoot. They got him, but the elder\nsister didn't let me in, so I kind of got in, the girl pushed her away. I got in with my head\ndown and my feet up. There wasn't enough space and I held the old man like this. When\nthey saw the Germans approaching, they closed it, closed it very fast. They went and the\nJewish people did resist at that time. They were looking around. I think they were\nscared themselves too. They were shooting in one bath if someone is not there, then the\nother bath, and I laid between and the little girl said I want to go with my Grandpa to that\nlittle basement and then I passed out. I honestly don't remember having any conscious. I\ndon't remember until about four hours later, these two girls with another woman they\npulled me up. They pulled up their father. The people were killed already. I could\nhardly regain my consciousness because my head was whirling. I didn't know whether I\nwas still alive or I'm dead. They pulled me out and there was a heap of dead people, like\n120. They pushed me in between and I took some and I bloodied myself to make sure\nthat the women had to go, they disappeared, most the SS went away. They did their job,\ncruelly. I was laying between the dead and a couple of old local Germans were to write\ndown how many. They pushed me up, I pretended I was dead. I was waiting. They took\nthe women to dig a big ditch for their husband and they put all kinds of lime in there.\nThat's what 1 heard. Then the women came back and they put us out. I was almost night,\nand they put us on a big horse and buggy. All the dead, I pretended I was dead too. They\nleft a couple of Jewish policeman or ordinals, they left them alive, they helped pull it up.\nOne of them squeezed me. I knew that he knew that I was alive. When we went\nsomewhere I remember because after the war I went to take a look down there. I was\nonly about 100 meters from the big ditch, and we made a turn after I decided to jump off.\nI don't think anybody did any shooting. Nobody did any shooting. I ran. I didn't know\nwhere I'm going. My head was whirling. All night I was running like a dead person. I\ndidn't know where I was going and what's going to happen. Until I finally saw a little\nman and I told him that I worked for this guy and this guy in this village where I worked\nfor the baker, so they gave me some clothes and they washed me, another farmer. That's\nhow I survived this massacre.",
        "Q: What was the name of the village where the Jewish Ghetto was?",
        "A: It's called Garbutka.",
        "Q: Did you have any sense when this was?",
        "A: It was somewhere around either July or August 1942. At that time, we heard, because I\nrelated that that they were killing older Jews, or killing all the Jews in Warsaw. That's\nhow I remember that. Anyhow, that's was the event, and that's why I told you off camera\nabout this girl, that woman who saved me is in Montreal today, and I recognized it two\nyears ago in Italy.",
        "Q: The woman in the basement?",
        "A: The woman who helped me get into the basement. She had another sister who did not\nwant me to get in there because they wanted to save their father. Anyhow I got out of\nthis mayhem and I went to work for another -- I think 1t was again a smaller little farmer.\nI was afraid to go back. Eventually I went back to the camp, but what happened is I ran\ninto another small little city and they took me to a camp. This was some kind of a camp\nfor Poles. There was some Jews too. Not far was called . I think I\nwas working there only two weeks. Also, they surrounded the people but supervision\nwas done by Russian P.O.W.s and they were working on -- they were crushing stone to\nmake some kind of a -- to go through some kind of a street. My job was -- again I was a\nlittle boy so they put me on a little lorry to hold the two -- to kind of brake and somehow\nI forgot my way and instead of braking I pulled the thing and naturally the guy, the\nforeman, he was German, started jumping and threatening me, and hitting me and\nbleeding me. He says I'll take care of you tonight. I want to tell you, an hour later I said\nI have to go to the bathroom, bloody, and I kept on walking and I escaped. That was a\nlittle camp I wasn't long there, a couple of weeks. Then I remember another event when I\nwas in that village and there I really literally found out about the holocaust. We were\ntaken to work down there near a train, and every week a train would come from Holland\nenclosed wagons, they had some wires across and there was a bag for water, and all the\nboys, including me, we were running to get some water, because these people I knew\nthey were Jewish people. They were screaming in Jewish. They couldn't talk Polish, half\nGerman, but they were from Holland. And they threw gold and money and give you\nwater. My heart was just the same thing. I was crying to myself. What the heck is going\non, and I knew which direction they were going already. The whole families and they\nwere crying and looking through the thing. Of course I didn't care about the money but\nsome of the kids cared about the money. I didn't want to be different. I picked up too.\nThis was going on for a few weeks. Every Thursday a train would come and I was\nwaiting with water and other boys were waiting with water too, for money, some of them\nI felt very sorry for those people. One day, a train comes and I waited. This was just an\nevent I must tell you. I'm holding a bucket of water and a train comes but not that kind of\na train, opened, and German police not SS, but police were talking to these people, stop\nthe train. They always had to stop. I don't know whether they had to fill up with water,\nthe locomotive, so it stopped and I looked in. Believe me I hold the bucket of water for I\nthought first class, all Germans and they talked to each other. I was smart enough to\nknow which is an SS man, which is a policeman. I had a kind of education over the\nyears. So, I was educated in this respect, so I go ahead and I take a look at it. I hide my\nwater and take a look what's going on and I look in there. They were wearing medals.\nThere were beautiful people, , so a German, I hesitated, he's going to get like\neverybody ten marks get in there and bring him the water. I took the water out and I\nstarted giving they had like little cubicles. I walked over to one man and he was\nreligious, religious Jews were they called it, and I recognized that he's\nJewish and all of a sudden I look at the rest of the people and all of a sudden I knew they\nwere Jewish, because the guy who was the head, a little guy next to him, he asked me in\nGerman , So I told me slowly , Means\na killing place in German. So, I kind of mentioned him. But I was very scared saying it\nwhen they said , | just jumped off the train with my empty bucket.\nI spilled the water and I ran as far as I could. I know my heart was crying because I\nknew in a couple two or three hours nothing will be out of them. They must have been\nVIPs from Vienna. Some of them had medals. In other words some of them must have\nbeen soldiers in the Austrian army. This was the last time I went through to the trains. I\nwas really afraid. But when I found out at this time really about the Holocaust.",
        "Q: How did you or anybody else know where these trains were going?",
        "A: Where I'm going?",
        "Q: No, how did you know where these trains were heading?",
        "A: I told you the first time I found out the truth the baker, he told me that in this direction,\ngoes down there to a place called and from there it goes down to\nand they knew. The local population knew. They were witnessing it.\nI don't think they were happy the Polish people regardless of their feeling. They still\nknew that human beings are being burned alive. I saw in the eyes of my baker, catholic, I\nsaw he was very angry. He said one day they are going to pay for that crime. I couldn't\nsay I was Jewish, but my heart and everything in me was whirling. I really didn't believe\nit. But slowly after the trains, and also there were runaways. Jews were hiding. Those\nwho jumped out of the trains. I can't go into in this interview all of the particulars, but\nthere were incidents -- there were incidents where I saw Russian escapes. I gave them\nbread, anything we had because somehow they were begging for food because they\nescaped and most of them were caught anyhow. But the Russians were really, really\ntreated bad by that time, the Russian POWs. They used tell me some of them. I worked\nin the fields and they would somehow run through those fields and ask me if I could\nbring in a piece of bread.",
        "Q: Was there any effort by the Polish people to sabotage this?",
        "A: From what I knew, do you mean sabotage the Jewish problem or sabotage against the\nGermans?",
        "Q: Against the Germans?",
        "A: There was quite a bit, I want you to know. From what I know and from what I observed\nthe Polish people were very patriotic, and they hated the Germans regardless and let me\ntell you the Germans, the SS, they did not treat the Poles nicely, not even nicely. They\nwere killing them off quite a bit. They were killing them off. And they had their\nunderground, which was run through London and some of them, most of them in the\nvillage by us were hiding and we were hiding all kinds of guns and ammunition and I\nused to be chased out sometimes in the village to find out what time the train goes to\nRussia to the front, because sometimes this underground would jump on one of the trains,\nbut on the edge of the train and steal whatever they could, food, ammunition. So, the\nPoles, they were putting up a hell of a resistance.",
        "Q: Were you aware of any specific incidents?",
        "A: Where they put on a resistance. Not a specific but I knew and I saw because the people I\nworked for, they were really engaged in that underground activity. I wasn't on a specific\ndid anything specifically because I was young.",
        "Q: How long did you go from village to village hiding out as a catholic boy?",
        "A: You want to know how much time. I was even late before, I was after that I worked in a\ngun powder factory, and also they had a lot of Jewish people down there working for\nthose good chemists. They got together all those people who they didn't liquidate if they\nasked look what did you do, if he was a good chemist of physicist they needed for\narmaments so these people worked in a big factory down there, and I happened to go in\nto them, to the Jewish people. Then I stayed with them a few months and then I escaped\nback to the villages, but to answer you how many -- what did you ask me again?",
        "Q: Were you in hiding essentially for the rest of the war of how long?",
        "A: Hiding through the rest of the war 1s the answer. I was never free. I either was inside,\njail was inside or I was hiding outside. I was not hiding because I had to hide, I was\nhiding because I was scared. Just about I would say a year before the end of the year, the\nPolish resistance was very great, and I was scared at that time they grabbed all youth I\nwas scared they were going to recognize me, so I escaped from there. I went back to\nwhere the factory was, not far, and I was hiding personally because there was another\nproblem. Amy boy whether they were Jewish or not Jewish, any boy was either arrested\nto kill because the Poles had an uprising in Warsaw and the people they I would say the\nPolish army was gathering to go help the people in Warsaw. I was afraid that they were\ngoing to -- I was with them really, it was called at that time ,a\nPolish Army, but I didn't want to go to Warsaw and I was afraid they were really\nmobiling young kids to go to Warsaw. However, I escaped. I was more afraid that they\nwere going to recognize me that I'm not Jewish, because being in the village somehow I\nknew the people, but strangers, groups, underground there were all kinds of people and\nsome of them were they were very good and recognizing Jews, I want you to know. So, I\nescaped the forest and then I was hiding wherever I could. But his was the real way I\nwas saved. I was hiding in the haystack and all of a sudden I see two guys. I was with\nanother fellow. Not to be killed the Germans were after him. Germans SS, Gestapo,\nthey had all kinds of you know, people who were looking to kill us. So, I was hiding and\nall of a sudden I seen two guys whom I recognized they worked in the gun powder\nfactory and they escaped from there. One guy knew the area very well. He's the one who\npractically saved me. He's in Toronto now. I was just with him in . His\nname is Silverman He knew the area and we tried to get across the lines, the lines\nmeaning the Russians were advancing. We were on the other side. The artillery was just\nunbearable from the Russian side. We tried to get through the to go to\nthe Russian side, but it was impossible. There were virtually hordes of German army\nwhich they retreated to this other side of the water so we couldn't. They had another line\nwhich they were preparing in case they had to retreat. So, we were between the first line\nand the second line of the German defense. It was horrible. It was bad. I used to inside I\ndid not look Jewish, I used to go out and somehow organize bread and water and we\nmade bunkers, deep bunkers, winter, deep bunkers and we begged, we got some food.\nWe were hungry all the time and that's how until the Army came across. It's a little\nharder for me, but it didn't take long. It was very hard because the German army with\ntheir dogs and all that they were retreating and they at that point they didn't especially\ncare who they killed. If we were in their way between both lines and that's how\neventually I survived. I think it's enough for me now. I'm getting tired.",
        "Q: Can I just ask you a couple general questions.",
        "A: There's still a lot more for me to say, but it's very hard for me to go on.",
        "Q: Did you go back to Warsaw then?",
        "A: Why certainly.",
        "Q: I wanted to ask you if you saw the city, the Ghetto burning?",
        "A: The Jewish Ghetto, no, but I saw Warsaw. I was aware of the burning and I was aware\nthat there was a Jewish uprising because it was full. Everybody was talking about it in\nthe villages and the cities. I came back down to Warsaw and Warsaw was completely\ndestroyed because after the Jewish uprising, after the Jewish uprising, then there was a\nPolish uprising before the Soviet Army came in, and they killed quite a bit of Poles, a\ncouple of hundred thousands. They guarded themselves pretty good, but the Germans\nwere overwhelming with tanks and everything. When I came back, Warsaw was burned\nto the ground.",
        "Q: You were liberated by the Russian army, when was that?",
        "A: I didn't see the Russians, but that was about the time somewhere in 1945.",
        "Q: Did you in the time you were hiding, did you feel terribly isolated that you knew you had\nto be safe that you had to be a catholic boy, but you knew that you're people were\nsomewhere else. Was that a strange feeling?",
        "A: Well, number one it was I wasn't too smart to think about those things. I was trying to\nsave myself. I knew that I'd never see my brothers and sisters. That I knew, yet the will\nto live and to one day survive and like now to tell people, it was a certain thought of it\nand I was lucky.",
        "Q: How did you feel about being Jewish at the time?",
        "A: Well, let me tell you, I went to church for quite a while, but whenever I could avoid,\ncould avoid. I never heard because the church never teaches anything harsh against Jews.\nI just felt strange amongst it because I was brought up in a Jewish religion, so I let it go\nby what the priests say with a grain. Let it go, okay, some of it I absorbed and some of it\nI forgot and that's it. But I felt Jewish --not that I felt Jewish, I felt very scared every\ntime I went from village to village and maybe they could recognize me. I felt Jewish, all\nright.",
        "Q: You didn't resent being Jewish?",
        "A: I was resenting a lot of times. There were times when they took kids, in the villages, they\ntook them to Germany and I was very scared because I was circumcised and I thought\nthat whenever they had something like that surround and take the kids to Germany from\nthe villages, I was hiding and very fast because they used to say they take them a certain\nplace and because the Germans wanted only healthy people, so somewhere near\nthey would take them to quarantine and checked whether they don't have any\nt.b. They wanted healthy people. So I was afraid if I was going to undress before\ndoctors, they'll recognize that I was Jewish. So, I was very sure, at the risk of my life to\nescape those situations where they couldn't catch me to Germany. Funny thing,\nsometimes I figured I could have gone because one of my neighbor boy was caught then\nhe escaped from Germany he told me didn't have anything like that. They took us\nstraight in there. It would have been easier for me if I would have gone. I was aware that\nI was circumcised. Every moment of the day, it hit me.",
        "Q: After the war, were you eager to be Jewish again?",
        "A: Let me tell you, during the war, I really thought that God as a German. I thought they'll\nnever be defeated, the kind of cruelties, the way they were. I would say the SS and all\nthe Gestapo and all the apparatus. I will tell you, you would never they were barbarians.\nThey were not human beings, these people who were running Poland at that time. The\nSS, the Gestapo, and all kinds of other names they had. I knew how strong they were.\nTo say that I was glad to be Jewish, I want to tell you something, and this is the truth, I\nwas just mad a my God, first of all mad at my father that he made me a Jew, and mad at\nmy God that we had to suffer so much, what for. That was my first feeling. A lot of time\nI talked to God. When you get desperate you start talking to something. You've got\nnothing. I would just put my eyes up and I asked why, why wasn't I born a dog, a bird\nwho could jump over the Ghetto walls or a catholic. Why was I Jewish. And there were\ntimes when I was really thinking that it's not good for me to be a Jew, if I ever live and if\nI have children, I said to myself, I would never let them be circumcised because this is\njust showing the enemy that you're not the same.",
        "Q: After the war?",
        "A: Well, when I went to America, of course, in American I found out that I would not\ncircumcise my kids if it wouldn't be that they said in America they are circumcising\neverybody. I was Jewish. I got married and my in-laws they were Jewish too, and I let\nthem circumcise my two sons. If I were to live in Poland, in Europe, I would never let\nmy kids by circumcise, in fact I would even try to be a non-Jew, because what for?",
        "Q: I guess did it take you a while to readjust to being a Jew again after the war?",
        "A: Believe me, I knew I was Jewish, because there was some persecution in Poland too,\nafter the war. And some of them came back from Russia or those who survived never\nmade it even amongst the Polish people. There were some Poles who were not happy yet\nwith Jews surviving. I wouldn't say some, majority were just people.",
        "Q: You're tired aren't you. Do you want to stop?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: After you were liberated, where did you go?",
        "A: Eventually a year later I escaped from Poland and made my way to Germany.",
        "Q: Right afterward did you go back to your village to see if you knew anybody?",
        "A: Definitely I went back. I was looking. I was trying to find out if anybody's 1s alive. I\nknow they're not, but maybe, of course, I was trying. I went from village to village and I\neven put my name in on certain areas because I was afraid I was taken into the ARmy. I\nwas afraid that somehow my sister by the writing on the wall knew that I'm alive. She\ncame back from Siberia, from Russia.",
        "Q: You're sister is the only surviving?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Is there anything else you think should be recorded about this whole experience.",
        "A: To record I could just tell you one thing. The worst for me was the Ghetto Warsaw. It\nwas worse than hell. You couldn't imagine -- hell was worse. I can't imagine that the\npeople could be surrounded, not fed, children my age and worse was smaller children,\nwere just laying in the street begging for food, dying and no body even paid attention.\nThey just picked them up in groups, on lorries and they you know when I look I wonder\nright now, always my heart goes out for them. Because what I saw over there, I saw the\nreal stuff, I can relate that to what's happening. But the worst was the older people, the\nepidemic of typhus. I want you to know I had typhus at certain time, we skipped. I had\ntyphus too, but it was hell on earth. The worst was Ghetto, was hell on earth. To give\nyou an example, I want to say something. After the war I always looked in the eyes of\nGerman women. Why. You'll ask me because I saw one girl, one woman, I'm going to\nrelate it to an incident. I know already hungry kids, we knew which are good Germans,\nw which are bad Germans, who's going photograph us and they used to come into the\nGhetto, like tourist, show how Jewish people are dirty, how they live in poverty, how\nthey just are a heap of people who wouldn't be so bad to kill. That was their real idea.\nOne day like a little truck opened in small little like a pickup and I looked at it from far.\nEverytime a German pickup like this came into the Ghetto, everybody ran because you\nnever know when they're going to catch up, but I was a little from far I\ncould recognize these were airmen. They were airmen so I figured I'll wait and I'll beg\nfor bread. I wait up there and they stopped and they want to make pictures. I thought\nvery good come a little close. So, I said they can't photograph me unless they throw me a\npiece of bread. So one girl came a little close and she grabbed me and hit me right\nbetween the eyes. A girl, must have been a husband or boyfriend, a German soldier, says\n\"Now tell me why did you do that. He's just a little boy,\" to that woman, and I'll never\nforget her. After the war I was looking in the eyes of every German girl and I couldn't\nunderstand why a German woman, maybe she was 18, 19 you know something like this,\nwhy she would do it to me and I didn't get any bread and I wouldn't take any bread\nbecause to me shame was worse than hunger. Then they went on, but she really gave it\ntome. What got into those people. What kind of people were they? Either they were\nbarbarians or they were just got out of the caves and to go ahead and hate, make us\nmiserable, and on the contrary they tried to I would say prosper on our misery. They\nbrought in people to show our people are dirty people, loused, not really prepared I\nwould say prepare the stage where they could kill us because we are not worthy living\nand they are the ones who really brought this up because slowly they weakened\neverybody in the Ghetto. No food, dirty water, no hygienic anything which we could be\nclean nothing but sickness, people dying on the street, they weakened us and they made\nus like no humans and it's very hard for the majority of people to even resist however a\nlot of older people remember the Germans where they were good people from the first\nWorld War or they lived with them in Poland and they couldn't understand, they would\nnot believe that they could do it to us. They didn't believe that the German would\neventually kill all of them. They couldn't imagine, however, by slowly depriving the\npeople of everything taking away all their privileges, taking away their education,\nmaking them look like raggedy people they prepared, they were preparing they figured\nthat these people are unworthy to life, and it was their fault, because scientifically I'm\nsure they did it all scientifically to get rid of the Jewish people.",

        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Well, I raised in the spirit of Judaism.",
        "A: No, the school itself, in this little city, was segregated between Catholics and Jews. Mind\nyou, it was a small town, and I would say the majority of the people in that small town\nwere Jewish people. Inside the town, somehow, I don't know why, but they separated us\nJewish children and Catholic children. As you know, most of the people in Poland were\nCatholic.",
        "A: Yes, I used to have friends.",
        "A: Yes, I did. I felt it, maybe not personally, but I knew of a lot of incidents whereby either\nthey were small little -- I would call 1t -- we were separated, in other words, but hardly\ngot together, and there were incidents. Incidents, not pleasant incidents, because we were\ncalled in from the house, people regardless of how religious we were, did not believe that\nwe were really religious people.",
        "A: No, other than we were a lovely family.",
        "A: Yes there were Zionists in the city. There were Socialists, there were Communists, even\nthough at that time Communists had to go underground, and religious institutions.",
        "A: My parents were, I would say, Zionists, and very religious.",
        "A: I was aware what was going on even though I was a very young youngster. My father\nused to subscribe to many newspapers, Jewish in origin and non-Jewish papers, papers\nthat had nothing to do with us. However, my father and my brother and all the rest of\nthem we used to discuss those things. They used to discuss and I used to listen, and I\nknew what was going on. In fact, I remember when they were chasing out Jews from\nGermany, who were of Polish origin, my father took in some of them, a couple of them,\nto stay with them because they came out of there with nothing. They really went from\ncity to city amongst Jews. There were so many of them that people had to help. So, I\nwas aware, until the war, very much aware, what was going on.",
        "A: Definitely, yes. In a public school, since it was more or less a Jewish school, in other\nwords, we did not speak Jewish there, it was Polish, history, everything was Polish, and\nthe guy who was --what do you call it? He was not Polish, the guy who was running the\nschool, he was not Jewish, he was Polish. In other words, he was a Catholic, so we were\naware amongst us kids, because sometimes we were not greeted in the city very well.",
        "A: Yes, because people were aware that eventually Hitler will overrun Poland. It was\nknown between people that he's not going to stop at that time in Czechoslovakia. He had\ngreat -- in other words, he had great expansion ideas, and he asked the Polish government\nto give him almost everything they needed, or wanted. So, we knew it was going to be\nsooner or later. A few days before the war they already had black outs in Poland,\nbecause at that time, I would say the Russians and the Poles signed an agreement. It was\nabout a week before the war, and everyone was aware that there will be a war. We did\nnot know the particulars of what they signed. The Germans, the USSR, we anticipated\nthere would be a war.",
        "A: I don't think so. The Jewish people naturally were very anxious. They already knew\nwhat happened to the people. They were thrown out. They already heard of the burnings\nof the synagogues and everything, but they really thought it will pass if the Germans\ncome in. It will pass, and Jewish people really believed that Germany was going to be\ndefeated. We were aware and the preparation was made in a way. People used to hoard\nfood and everything, because they knew he was going to come. They had certain\nmemories, Jewish people had certain memories of World War I where it really was\nbenign. They occupied Poland or part of Poland and it was benign. In other words, the\noccupation, they were not harsh on Jews. On the other end, Jews were very friendly\nbecause our language, the Jewish language resembled German, so there were a lot of\nGermans in that town. They used to speak Jewish too, or Jews spoke German. So, the\nJews kind of figured it will go over. Maybe the war will take a little longer, but it's not\ngoing to be that bad. They did not expect anything very bad.",
        "A: At that time, it was more or less, I would say a partnership between Jews and Catholics,\nbecause they had a history, the catholics had a bad history of German occupations. The\nJews already knew what was going to happen, that they are putting Jews in concentration\ncamps and so on. That they are really against Jews, the Germans. So,\nnaturally at that point they were united.",
        "A: What I remember is one morning, I think it was on a Friday, we were all sleeping and all\nof a sudden, a great bang in that little town. A bomb was thrown. We did not know it\nwas a bomb. We all ran out and we saw planes going over. There was near the town, not\nfar from the town were German garrison (ph). They tried to bomb the garrison but they\nmissed. They bombed the city. At that time, radios whatever you could hear, they\nannounced already that the war had begun.",
        "A: No, it was a Polish Army garrison, which from what I guess, they wanted to bomb, but\nthey probably missed.",
        "A: Panic, immediately. There was great panic in town. People did not know what to do, to\nstay in that little town or escape to Warsaw. My parents they went to Warsaw. All the\nsix children and my mother. My father was in the militia. He was a young man. They\ntook him in the militia to watch black outs. Once the German planes came they either\nthrew out -- they didn't throw them out, but they let go certain soldiers in parachutes. His\naim, my father's aim, was to watch that a black outs and there were some people who\ncame in there to bomb some bridges. So my father was there, and my mother was in\nWarsaw. Finally, my mother got very lonely or she was afraid that something was going\nto happen to my father, since he wasn't far, so she took me and we went back to that little\ncity. Warsaw at that time was not spared, but they did not come yet, the Germans.",
        "A: I went back with that little city. My mother stayed with my father, otherwise he was in\nthe Reserves, the Military Reserves, but she watched after him and I was around there\nand watched after the mill, which we had.",
        "A: Yes. I stayed there. All of sudden we heard that Warsaw was surrounded, and here my\nmother and father were very anxious because five children were there. We heard that the\nGermans surrounded them and the artillery is going, and there was no food because there\nwere more than a million people in Warsaw. My father and mother decided that I should\ngo back to Warsaw to help the children. So, they loaded me up with flour, food, but it\nwas very tough, tough for me.",
        "A: I had to take some food to help because starvation in Warsaw my mother and father heard\nabout. And you know, they have four children left helter skeltor in Warsaw in a small\nroom. So, they loaded me up with all kinds of food and they said, maybe he'll make it\neven though Warsaw was surrounded. It was very heavy what they put on, and I\nremember my father and mother, my mother would say to my father, maybe we'll never\nsee him again. But I guess the urge to help the children was greater and my father kind\nof looked at me and probably thought the same way, will I go through it, because there\nwere horses and people on the street massacred, killed on the way to Warsaw. In other\nwords, out of town the Germans would also throw in a bomb, artillery, bombed it. Many\npeople would walk through the streets going to Warsaw you would see carnage. So, my\nmother kind of kissed me and says who knows if I'll ever see him to my father, and my\nfather clenched his hand and I turned around and I walked. I never saw them again.",
        "A: Well, I came back from Warsaw, that same day Warsaw capitulated. I want to tell you\nfirst. I made it into Warsaw. It was very hard. It was very hard, but when I came\nWarsaw was surrounded there was a time they had what you call -- they stopped fighting\nto collect the dead. The Germans were fighting the Poles, the Polish Army. They were\nsurrounding them and of course, the Polish Army had some fierce resistance. However,\nthere was a time when they got the Red Cross or whatever, they arranged a one hour to\nget the dead out of the way. Germans and Polish. At that time, kids like us could go\nthrough. I made it and somehow when I came to a certain bridge, since they bombarded\nthe bridge with artillery, I had flour in the bag and a piece of shrapnel went in there. The\nflour, we got out of it, but we had other food. The flour went on the floor and I made it\nand I brought it to my brother and sisters, because there was starvation. Artillery, there\nwere people killed, burned, fire was all over. However, the Poles at that time they put up\na tremendous heroic, what do you call it -- heroic resistance.",
        "A: I think I remember I was 12 years old.",
        "A: Not far.",
        "A: Only walking.",
        "A: It didn't take a day, I want you to know, because the carnage on the way was great. The\nartillery we had to go at midnight. Somehow I think it took two and half, three days until\nI made it in. It was like an inferno. Warsaw was an inferno.",
        "A: What do you think? I certainly was frightened.",
        "A: I was frightened because there were fires and we never knew running through the street\nwhether the building would collapse. And on top of it, since I was a little boy, after\ndelivery I was told by the Polish Army, and rightly so, to help dig ditches in case the\nGermans advance. They called anybody who could do something. I was frightened,\nthat's the answer.",
        "A: I helped do what?",
        "A: The Army in Warsaw was preparing ditches against tanks, in case they advanced so any\nable bodied, any kid, anybody that could see on the street, they made him come and do it.",
        "A: A party of one.",
        "A: Well, there was starvation, and the worst thing there was no water. We were hiding in\nbasements. It was really mayhem. People would stand in line for bread, and artillery\nwould just mow them down and kill them. It was an inferno, fires all over. The funny\nthing, it was during the Jewish holiday, but Jews no matter what it is, what is was,\nwhoever had enough religious upbringing would hide in the underground and have the\nservices. Some of them stayed down there and were buried alive by the artillery. Not\njust artillery, but planes, where they would just circle the city and fire whoever they saw\nor just at random at any building.",
        "A: I don't think so. No, I was impatient. I would have liked to go back, but somehow -- I\nhad other problems. We had no water and there was a river and we were all running for\nwater, to drink water. That's a very terrible deal when you have no water, and it was also\nvery dangerous because there were not the Germans. At that time they were\nshooting the people who came for water. So, some of them never came back. I was very\nlittle.",
        "A: Well, certainly. It wasn't shooting especially, it was bombarding, you know from the air.\nI either get trapped or I ran away. IfI get trapped, then I wait there.",
        "A: Jewish people were very scared at that time. I think, or I heard that most of the\nbombardment at that time was directed to the Jewish quarter, most of the bombardment\nand I guess Jews were very much congregated in one area and the Germans were aware --\nin fact they were aware of everything, but this in Warsaw.",
        "A: Yes, I was hiding in the Jewish area wherever I could.",
        "A: I think it was very much -- there were cold sufferers and they used to meet at the river if\nthey get water, and it didn't make at that point in time, it didn't make any difference\nwhether you were Jewish, Polish, catholic. At that point we were all Poles against the\nGermans. I want you to know the Jews were more interested to fight the Germans\nbecause they knew that they anticipated bad days.",
        "A: At the time of bombardment, I think there was no animosity against each other because\nthere was normally a one enemy, which had to be scared of. There was no real\nanimosity. People would stand in line for bread whether they were Poles, Catholics,\nJews or anybody else. Each one was miserable.",
        "A: Not really, only after the war. It always changed later on.",
        "A: I did not experience anything like that.",
        "A: Let me tell you. As soon as the armistice was declared, the same day I picked up -- the\nrest of the children were still in Warsaw -- I picked up and got through the line, because\neven though there was an armistice, you didn't cross the line, the Germans. However,\nchildren they let through, and we went through, and we went up a few kilometers and all\nof sudden I found out what really happened. I went with another friend. He was not\nJewish, he was Catholic. We went back to the city and there was a German sentry and he\ncalled over because I did not know that they had at that time a curfew in the middle of the\nnight. So, the German soldier just grabbed me and slashed his throat. So, I understood\nright now that I have a lot of worries watching myself. In the morning I walked. I\ncouldn't go at night, in the evening. It took me another day to get through to see if I can\nmeet my parents. In the front of the city I had an uncle. He had a little restaurant. I\nwalked into this restaurant, nobody there. I got into that little city and all of a sudden I\nsee people that don't want to talk to me. Everytime I ask someone you know where are\nmy parents, they took off. That kind of feeling, maybe they escaped. So, I went into that\nlittle mill and people were robbing and I was just sitting until a man came over, a huge\nman, and he said \"These people are robbing this kid. He's just an orphan.\" I didn't\nunderstand him. Then my uncle came in and he says to me \"Don't you know about\n,\" that's the time I got immediately, and I couldn't believe\nit. I asked him where is it that they -- they are digging. I ran over and there was -- they\nwere trying to dig for the people. They were just not my parents, there were bombs and\nmaybe thirty people, twenty-five people in my uncle's restaurant's basement that were all\nkilled. They were all decimated. I took out and I recognized the skull and half of my\nfather's clothes, a little bit of my mother. I got very sick, and I walked out, then I knew\nfor sure that I didn't have any parents anymore. I got sick and dizzy and they took me to\nthe hospital. Then, of course, they were buried in a certain place. A few days later they\ntook the remains of all the people and I came there and I made a mark so I can find it and\nwell it comes later when I go fifty years later. That's how I met my parents again.",
        "A: The armistice from the beginning it was about 30 days, the whole war, and mind you,\nfrom what I found out there were killed about 36 hours before the armistice they were\nbombed.",
        "A: Yes, uncle, aunt, and other family, cousins.",
        "A: Not all, but most.",
        "A: Well, I was there, no communication with the children. They came about a week later\nand of course, we didn't know what to do. We were orphans.",
        "A: I happened to be the third. We were six. I was the third.",
        "A: We didn't know what to do, and we were very depressed. Somehow, we found also our\napartment was bombed. We had to go in a little room. My sister had nothing to survive\non -- my sister tried to make some food for people. Sometimes German soldiers used to\ncome by and she would make some food for them in order to earn something. We stayed\nthere, what I remember is all of a sudden my sister disappeared, and we were left. I did\nnot know why, and I was very mad at her. But later I found out that the German soldiers\ntried to attack her. She was then, I think she was 17 years old. She was six years older\nthan me, so she just took off one day, and run abroad to Russia. See, the Russians took\nhalf of Poland, and the Germans took the other one. This was the real pact, the map\nwhich separated Poland. So, my sister took off, somehow at that time it was chaos.\nAnybody who could run across even though -- it wasn't easy, but she made it.",
        "A: They tried, yes, but she was ashamed to tell us, and she escaped, and she left us five in\nthat city. She was the cook. Again, we were out of business I think about two months.\nWe had to get out of there, out of the city.",
        "A: I really don't know. Maybe she was just afraid, I don't know. I asked her and she would\nnever tell me, because she lives in San Francisco. I keep on asking.",
        "A: In which city?",
        "A: The people were still there, all of them, except those who were hurt by the bombs or\nthose who escaped to Warsaw. There were more or less -- 1t was right after the war and\nthey did not suffer too much. We suffered because we were orphans.",
        "A: It was just everyone for himself.",
        "A: We got together the first night, my brothers and sisters, went back to Warsaw, and me\nand my little brother were left behind we could sell anything we had, and then we went to\nWarsaw. We all went to Warsaw. And of course, there was no place to be. It was\nalready around December. Somehow my older brother, who was a university student got\ntogether with this professor to place us in an orphanage. He couldn't take care of us\neither. He was about 19 years old. So, he took us over. He had another one by the name\nof Adolf Therman who was the head of the Health and Children.",
        "A: I don't know. I knew him by the name of Adolf, because eventually I worked with him in\nGhetto. They took us over across to place, at that time, and they separated\nmy two little sisters. Also, at the place there was a place for girls and me\nand my younger brother over there. My older brother suffered probably\n, and I don't remember how he was existing, but later on I think he had a\njob.",
        "A: It was close to January already. I'm sorry the exact dates I just don't know. I could know\nif I could concentrate.",
        "A: It was a big building, many children over there. It was an organized like a government\ninside the orphanage. Each one had his own supposed to do certain things. They had a\ncourt, they had people older people who took care of the youngsters to see that they\nwashed, they cleaned. There were people who had to make up the beds. It was just like\nan internal -- they had a court, if someone deviated from certain things, he was punished.\nThe doctor was just going around. He knew that you're going to do it right. However, I\npersonally was a rebel in this, because most of the kids were just orphans since they were\nchildren. They knew their ways. I was very bitter. I was bitter that all of sudden my\nfather used to care about orphans, and all of a sudden I'm an orphan. So, I did not go\naccording to regulations. I used to run away to my brother's all the time, and I did not -- I\nwould say I was not a good boy there.",
        "A: We used to get jobs, you know, cleaning dishes. Cleaning . I don't\nremember. I don't recall, but I tried to get away from it because I was not used to the kids\nand them with the routines. To me it wasn't routine. It was like punishment.",
        "A: I was not punished, in fact they made me part of the court, because I was an older boy.\nSomehow, the regimentation down there, I wasn't too respected because I was fresh one,\nyou know. But they tried to give me some responsibilities.",
        "A: I really can't recall, but I would say it was over a hundred.",
        "A: Oh yes, with the older ones. We had beds of 30 to 40 in a room, and we had to have\nfriends at night. We tried to get into mischief. I know now, kids are mischievous. On\nthe signal to go to sleep, we pretended we were going to sleep, but we used to talk a lot. I\nhad friends.",
        "A: Well, let me tell you, mostly child talk, because these children down there, they were\nraised differently. I was born, I mean I was raised and I spoke Yiddish quite a bit, but\nthey spoke Polish only. Their vision of life was different because he taught them\nhe really taught them discipline. They were schooled and schooled in\ncertain areas, they were way ahead of me. A few friends I had.",
        "A: Well, from what I know now, officially we're not supposed to have schooling. There was\nno schooling any more, no school outside, but inside there were certain people who\nworked there for years and they were teachers and they gave us lesson. I wouldn't say\nthat I attended them, but I did.",
        "A: First of all the food. I appreciated the food because three times a day we were eating. It\nwas just the beginning of the war. America was not at war then and they used to ship\nfrom Switzerland or from other areas, they used to ship food, so there was no scarcity of\nfood, but I appreciated that because between the time I got into the orphanage and I lived\nin a room somewhere with my brothers and sisters, we had no food. That's what I\nappreciated.",
        "A: Yes, I had very good memories, very good memories, but I was bitter because I couldn't--\nI think I was bitter because I couldn't imagine that I'll ever be an orphan at one time. I\nused to know orphans, you know either the father died, or the mother died and they put\nthem in, but all of a sudden I had both gone, and what hurts me more is that I had a\ncouple of sisters there. I don't think the very young even knew that she didn't have.\nThere was a little girl, she must be four years old. She was taken in, but she was asking a\nlittle bit about her parents. That hurts me, but otherwise I think I was stronger at time. I\ntook it the way it was, because I was very happy they took me into that orphanage. I\nalready seen young kids going around and asking for bread, but whether I was happy or\nunhappy, I don't know, but I appreciated being there.",
        "A: I used to see him not very often because all of a sudden, my older sister was very\nknowledgeable -- my younger sister. But the rest of them, they were very young, they\ngot involved in playing, involved in the procedure of the place. They had little\ngirlfriends. That's it.",
        "A: I already told you it was run like a government. This guy, I didn't see him very often I\nwant you to know, but whenever I seen him, he was very lenient man. He if a kid was\nsick he would go by and pat him. He was very good, because I remember he even used\nto take out the excrement in the morning. He got up very early. I don't remember him\nvery well because I was a stranger down there. He figured that probably that I am not his\nin Polish they call it . He did not raise me, you understand? He more or\nless, he liked more the kids which he raised. Don't forget that he was the kind of a man\nhe read a lot of books which as I a child I was reading. Only of us children, all kinds of\nmysteries about how children behave and and we used to have theaters there\ntoo. We used to have what do you call , all kind of marionettes. In\nthe beginning of the war you could do almost a lot of things, but the Germans were not\norganized yet. They couldn't cope with a half a million Jews, and the Jews were not, at\nthat time, segregated.\nTape #2",
        "A: Other than seeing them go out, we were waiting for him a lot of times. He was busy\nalmost every day, going out and arranging for help. This orphanage was very organized.\nIt was, I think at that time, it was even run by the Polish, by the city, but there were\nmany, many orphanages at that time in Warsaw. I am going to run away from myself.\nThat's how we organized later when I had to leave. I haven't got too many memories of\nthat man because I was there only a short time. He would go around and check, ask if we\nhad enough to eat maybe comfort me once in a while, say everything will work out, and\nthe staff was very nice. The staff there understood that I was just a freshly baked orphan,\nso they were nice to me. They knew also that I had a brother, a little brother, my two\nsisters and so that's all I remember.",
        "A: Stephan, yes I saw her once in a while. An elderly lady who was very nice. That's all I\nknow, and I used to ask her how my little sisters are. She said don't worry about them.\nThey are fine. I used to come in and she's show me the little children were dancing. I\nthink my little one forgot all about my parents. She was involved in the life. The older\none --.",
        "A: The best that I can recall I would say almost two months.",
        "A: Then he organized, we must have organized it before, there was a place somewhere in\nWarsaw, in the Jewish district and they called that -- they took all the older boys down\nthere all the freshly orphans which they took in, boys only, and they organized what they\ncalled a House of Boys, under their supervision, but they had a different administrator.\nThat administrator was a professor, a Jewish professor. So, they took us, this guy would\nand other guys who were approximately over 11 years old, and they\norganized a new home. This home was, again, they tried to get us to gover -- which\nyou'll see in this little book and it was very nice, I want you to know.",
        "A: From what I remember, I did not remember, but my friend told me it was",
        "A: Eventually they took a lot of boys off the street, too, and I would think I would say\nbetween 70, around there, 80. My little brother could have stayed with him, but he didn't\nwant to stay. He wanted to go with me. We were both there",
        "A: It was completely different. The task of this place was we should be more or less\nresponsible even economically for everything. They used to send children like to barbers\nwhere they cleaned up. They used to send people to shoemakers they should help. They\nused to send people out, the little older boys, because they were up to 15, 16, some of\nthem even had a little children. Normally in Europe, if a kid finished school, he became\nan apprentice somewhere. So, people used to make money, kids used to make money and\nthey would take the money and buy food. In other words, you almost had to be self\nsufficient.",
        "A: I did all kinds of jobs. My first job was I worked with very responsible people who were\ndirecting the food distribution for all orphanages in Warsaw.",
        "A: Jewish people, only in the Jewish district. I can't tell you when it happened, but I can tell\nyou what happened, because we at that point, a Ghetto, I mean were all together. Jews\nwere separated, not completely yet, but they were separated. And we used to go out to all\nkinds of work. I worked with this -- he liked me this guy, and he directed the food\ndistribution. He directed the people, had to hide whatever they had, the Germans would\nconfiscate everything for free. So, they used to hide things in the cellars, wherever they\ncould and then bring it up, because the American was already working there\nfor orphanages, and I was there working. They used to bring all their wares, their\nsamples and they would distribute all the samples. They didn't give them any money, but\nthey gave them certain numbers in Switzerland that later on they'll be able to collect.\nNow, I know they never collected. But my job was . We used to -\n- we didn't have any horses or anything, we used to have a little buggy, long buggy, one\non the side and I on other side and we would pull from place to place and distribute food.\nThis I got so many bread. That was my first job. It lasted something like three months.\nThen I had other jobs.",
        "A: You keep asking me because the last job was the job where I could not come back to the\norphanage anymore.",
        "A: It was more responsible. We were older kids. We were reading newspapers. And I want\nyou to know, it went like a university. In this orphanage you had the biggest I would say\ndoctors, the Germans as a rule tried to kill whether they were Poles or Jews all the\nintelligent, all the professors, doctors and colleges, all of them, so at this orphanage we\nhad even though we knew who they were, but we had the very educated, most educated\nof Warsaw and surrounding. They were professors, they were the chief rabbis of a city\ncalled . They were they liked me, one guy wanted the best\nchore. There were other professors who were hiding there. They were cleaning, they\nwere cooking in order not to be discovered by these Germans. And since they worked in\norphanages, I don't think the Germans checked too well. There were a few times they\ntook out some. So, at night we were not allowed to go to school -- when night came after\nsupper, what I know now how education goes, we had a terrific lectures on everything.\nIn other words, it was something like a university. All the boys would sit down and they\nwould give us lectures in history, Jewish history and then they would always give us\ngeography and any other arithmetic every other night another professor would start\nteaching us. Then the rabbi would teach us Judaism. It was like a university.",
        "A: Very much. I wouldn't miss those things. I couldn't understand you know, I used to go\nto public school and I didn't finish, so I couldn't understand how nicely the interpreter\nwas.",
        "A: Yes 1t was on Gesha 6.",
        "A: Those who were officially -- there was like people who worked there and they were also\nvery educated people because they tried to -- you had to a lot of influence to get off the\nstreet of Warsaw and work in orphanages. But at that same time they had to have a\ncertain amount of education.",
        "A: I really cannot recall names, but I know some of them didn't even give their real names\nbecause they were hiding. They didn't want to be killed by the Gestapo.",
        "A: Why certainly, definitely. We were all Jewish kids and there was a chief rabbi down\nthere.",
        "A: It was special. We maybe had a little more bread and we were singing the songs.",
        "A: Not all of us. Those who had to work, and even some of them worked with the Germans\noutside the area and they had to go.",
        "A: He supervised and he came by I would say very often. He would stop by and check with\nthe and he would recognize us. He would check to see with they guys who\nwere running it. He felt that this was his responsibility, because a lot of them other than\nme they were also his kids who were brought up by him.",
        "A: I would say about a year and a half.",
        "A: My little brother, too.",
        "A: Oh yes. In fact, they used to bring new ones from the area, very nice educated kids, those\nwho were qualified they brought into work.",
        "A: I don't know anything about before the war, but I'll tell you they did not they couldn't get\ninto our place because the rooms, the area was very small and we had 30 40 people in a\nroom. I don't think they could absorb more but they did not have a place for them.",
        "A: I have heard at that time that he was very influential even with the city who was catholic,\nbut they respected him and I think he did open a few more somewhere. If he didn't open\nofficially, he took them off the streets.",
        "A: Well, I would compare him to a hippie, I want you to know. He never dressed, you\nknow, and he wasn't really sophisticated. He was just like a hippie.",
        "A: What they tried to do 1n this orphanage, they tried to make human beings out of us under\nthe worst circumstances because inside we were like an island. Outside it was hell, a real\nhell. People were dying of starvation and even in the beginning they were dying of\nstarvation, people some of their parents left for Russia, left the wife with the children. It\nwas very bad outside. Here you tried to organize it in such a way that everyone either\nworked or if you couldn't find work give him a trade inside. Little kids became shoe\nmakers, cabinet makers. They brought up old tools.",
        "A: Yes, and this was my downfall. I had other jobs where they used to send me I guess what\nhappened is I wasn't strong enough to pull the buggy so they sent me they had other jobs,\nto send me to people in factories where they were making clothes. But my last job, that\nwas my downfall. That was my downfall. They sent me to a factory outside the Ghetto.\nI had to go at 5:00 in the morning. You had to go with the German sentries. If they\nwanted to warm themselves up, they would chase me around just for exercise. They\nwould chase me around and around and made me run. It was bad. So, I went through it\nwas a problem in Ghetto a big foundry, a big factory run by Germans and some Jews who\nbefore the war were foremen. I used to get up in the morning hoping that I would get to\neat something. But somehow they didn't give me any food and the job was very horrid. I\nhad to pick up 30 or 40 pounds of burned up steel and throw them into the fire walking\non the . I was very week. I couldn't do the job. I was always thinking to\nescape. It was horrible. So eventually some Polish people who worked with me, they\ngive me a piece of bread. I was still hungry. The orphanage -- the people were still\nsleeping while I was going to work. I wasn't the only one, in other places they woke up\nearly. So, around noon time -- this was my downfall, maybe you should understand, I\nwas very hungry, hard work for now I know for a boy was terrible. I had to walk up with\na load of 40 or 50 pounds. Finally around noon time it wasn't arranged for me to have\nfood and the Poles give me a little bread but they didn't have themselves. They were\nworking people, hard working people, and I explained I came from the orphanage\nbecause I had to keep up with them and I couldn't keep up. I think I was about 14 years\nold, and I wasn't too strong either. So, they took pity on me and they helped me a little\nbit, but I was still hungry. What my downfall is, it started with a dog. These people who\nran the place they had their own big house next to it. They were German soldiers and\nGerman civilians because most of this was going for the armaments. They were making\npresses there and everything. Somehow they were always happened, but I noticed that\nthe dog gets a lot of food after lunch. The dog got a lot of food but I couldn't reach it.\nEverytime I went by I wanted to grab something. Finally I got acquainted over a week\nor two he would finish eating I would grab some. He was happy, and it was good stuff\nfor the dog. I ate it and I felt good. So one day, I could always get after he was finished.\nIf not, he would growl. That was one day one of the foreman, I don't know if he was\nJewish or non-Jewish, came out and grabbed me and slapped me and hit me. You go\ntaking away the food of the dog. Don't you get enough food. I was working there for\ntwo weeks, I had no food. Nevertheless, he called a couple of other Germans over and he\nshamed me in front of them. Because I know it wasn't the first time I got hurt that way,\nbut , he had engineering place, all kinds of instruments and a Polish\nengineer was there and he started hitting me again. Aren't you ashamed he said. You're a\nJewish boy, to do those things. When he hit me very hard, I got very excited and figured\nthat's the end of me. I grabbed a inch by inch a steel ruler and I grabbed it\ninstantly without thinking and hit him in the glasses and I think I blinded him. I escaped.\nI could run through before the assessment checked by paper I was gone already anyhow,\nbut I had legitimate papers anyhow to go from the Ghetto, and I was afraid to go back in.\nThen my little brother came out at night. I was I think sleeping over at my brother's. He\nsaid, don't go there. The Jewish police are looking for you and if you go in there you\nmight compromise the whole place. I don't know to this day what happened to that man,\nbut I know the glasses and blood was running out. From then on I became what we call\nin the Ghetto, a wild boy. My brother didn't have enough food, so to tell you it was\nhorrible. I used to wake up 5:00 in the morning hoping there would be a lot of dead\npeople on the street. Hoping I don't know maybe it was just that I wanted to live, but\neveryday hundreds of people would lay down and die. They couldn't either take it\nanymore or sick or just froze to death or gave up. I used to wake up 5:00 in the morning,\nI wasn't the only one I want you to know, and kind of stuffed my hands in the pockets of\nthose half dead or dead people and whatever bread -- in Warsaw everybody you couldn't\ngo away without a piece of bread. I got a piece of bread here, a piece of bread here.\nSometimes a dead person I would even take off a watch too, to help myself. That's how I\ngot breakfast, and some of it I had for lunch. Some of the time I was beaten up. They\nused to smuggle in potatoes. If something fell I would grab and they would run after me\nand beat the hell out of me. Hygiene, very dirty. There was no place to take a shower\nany more. You go around desperate. So, finally I decided I'm going to go out to the\nother side. I didn't run away but to go out for some food. One incident I want to tell you.\nSo, the situation was very bad. Children, especially elderly people would be laying\ndown there dead either of typhus or any other sickness or just frozen to death because\nthey had no place to stay or they gave up. I decided with other kids we're going to take a\nchance. They used to take out groups to work outside the Ghetto so we were to get in\nthere and as soon as we passed, the Germans did not especially check those who went\nout, they only checked those who came back, so we used to go and beg for food. One\ntime, very early, I and two more friends, I'm sorry do you want me to tell you this is just\nthe gist of one event. We're trying to get in and beg for food. We have learned already a\nlittle bit how to greet catholic people in their way. So, it was about a four or five story\nbuilding and right after the curfew we got in there the superintendent opened there's a\ncertain gate, and each one of us went to a different floor. I knocked on the door. A\nwoman looks and me and I try to cross myself and say whatever I knew and say what I\nhad to. She said to me, \"Look, you don't have to do that. I know who you are.\" I\nprobably wasn't the first boy to beg for food, but she was all messed up. A nice woman\nand the first thing she asked me to take off my clothes and she prepared some hot water\nand especially we had so many lice on us they were eating us alive. We did not look\ngood. That's how they recognized us anyhow. So, she said don't worry about it. Take it\noff and I'll burn it. I will cook it. Then she was cooking for me something like\nbuckwheat. And they were poor themselves. She didn't have anything to give other than\nto cook something. And I was hungrier than hell. She sat down with me and I think she\nwas a good woman, but all of a sudden she started talking religion to me. She said it's\nsuch a pity that you Jewish children can not go to kingdom of heaven and he had to bring\nHitler a man, the destroyer. I kind of looked at her and I figured I was brought up\nreligious in other ways, but I figured she's good, so I said okay. Well, I understand, but\nwhat can we do we're hungry. All of a sudden we were sitting down there and I didn't eat\nyet. I hear a shot. The superintendent of the building must have called up the police, the\nlocal police and I looked down and one of my friends was shot. He was shot in the leg\nand he fell. I didn't know what happened yet to the guy on the second floor, but that\nwoman, we realized first I said hide me somewhere. So, she took me in a closet, in\nEurope they have, like you have hear, where you hang your clothes, inside they have\noutside, and she put me in there and she locked me up. She covered me with all kinds of\nfurs, whatever was in there and took the key out and went to the neighbors. She was\nafraid that if they catch me down there, they'll kill her too. So, she went to the neighbors,\nand I was lucky she took out the key with her so I didn't have any air. I was holding my\nnose against, and I was sweating and I thought this is the end. They'll probably ask the\nother kid on the second floor what happened, where I am who is the other one because\nthe superintendent saw three kids coming, three Jewish kids. Well, I was there, running\nwas water, I thought this is the end of me. I couldn't breath. I think I passed out for a\nwhile. All of a sudden I hear a scream and I thought it was German, but it wasn't, it was\na husband and coming back and screaming. He was a good man, he says look you have\nto kill us. He was a railroad man, but don't suffocate him. When they took me out, I\ndidn't go out, I fell out. But he was a good man, and he hid me with neighbors. Gave me\nnew clothes because my clothes were wet. He was still cooking and food and everything\nand at night he took me through because he worked with the German Army and he was\nvery connected with the police and I went through with a lot of food. He gave me food\nand everything I brought in I think two weeks I ate. I had food for two weeks. What I'm\ntrying to tell you is an accident again, I had to hide because the other kid was beaten to\nhell, almost dead. The guy on the second floor. I don't know what happened to the first\nfloor whether they took him back to the hospital or not. I never met him. This kid, the\nother one, told on me and again I had to change clothes. I had to make myself all kind of\ndirty things on it because I was cleaned up already, and they didn't recognize me. But I\nwas sought again by the Jewish police because the German gave him the description, who\nIam. Finally I think it's impossible for me to be there. I am going to die there. I went\nover to my brother. I didn't even bother telling my younger brother, because we were\nclose. I said to my older brother, I said look I want on the other side, some of them\nrecognized, some of them didn't recognize. I am going to escape. Whatever happens,\nhappens, but I'm not going to die here like the rest of the kids. So, he says look, tell me\nsomething, you go because there's no hope here. I'll take you through. The way they\ntook through people was they went to work outside and they could squeeze me, but he\nwas already an educated guy. He belonged to a group they were revisionists, a group, a\nZionist group and I guess he was more or less in underground already. They had certain\nconnections with people in Slovakia so he kind of drew up a map for me if I get over\nthere. He drew up amap. You take this boat. There was a boat going. There was a rive\nin Poland which goes through the whole country. When you hit under the\ntry to go across and we have connections with these people who are saving Jews. So, he\ngave me a map and everything, gave me a few dollars, whatever he had and whatever I\nhad, not much, and to go and get a ticket. I walked out of the group which went to work\nand ran away. I want to tell you, he helped me, my brother he gave me whatever money\nhe had. He bought a little jacket for me and a little hat and proper shoes, not too good but\nshoes. I went out there and I went to get a ticket and I went to get a ticket and I hesitated,\nI was moving back, because there was a line of people, to go or not to go, because I think\nonly older people go and I was just a little kid in between. So, I moved out, all of\nsudden, with a German he asked me he says to me he grabbed me he says listen to me,\ndon't go in there in German they said they'll you. They will finish you off\nin German. I pretended I didn't know a word of German. So I was saying again in Czech\nagain. He got mad and he started talking in Polish. He knew both languages. He said\nyou get the hell away from here. They will kill you. I have an idea after today, he was\nan angel and he saved me. But where do I go. I had a map, about a journey of two days\nhit the in Poland, and 1 don't know where to go so I went to the Central\nStation. I went to Central Station but my heart was pumping. I didn't know whether they\nwould recognize me, if they want to recognize me, but it looked like nobody paid\nattention to me. I had a piece of bread. This was early in the morning when I got out,\nand where do you go. Finally, I was afraid to go because to go into that Central Station\nentrance because there were so many German SS around there checking for ;\nwhich means you had to have some kind of a -- something who you are. They called\nthem , and I had nothing. Where do you go, so I was just roaming around\nthe street and I reminded myself my father used to go once in a while took me with him\nto a rabbi, a big they had those semitic groups and they used to he was maybe 60\nkilometers outside of Warsaw. But they had a little train there. It wasn't large rails and\nsmall and it sort of dragged into that little city. So I said maybe down there there won't\nbe so many soldiers. And sure enough, I went down there, it was near dusk, I figured if it\nget a little dusk nobody will recognize me anyhow. So, I got up, but I was afraid to buy a\nticket. I got up without a ticket and I figured if they catch me I'll take out some money\nand give the conductor. They weren't Germans, they were just Polish workers. So, I sat\ndown amongst the women. They were smugglers. They would smuggle in food to\nWarsaw and buy clothes there. This was their job. So amongst them I sat between them\nthey asked me where do you come from? What are you doing here? I told them, listen\nmy father was a soldier -- I made it up-- I father was in the army and he was killed. I am\nlooking for my mother because my father lived in the German occupied area and my\nmother took off and she's supposed to be around this area. So, they started giving me\nsalami, food, anything what I wanted. When the conductor came he, they said you don't\ntouch that kid. In other words, they felt sorry for me because my father was killed. I\ndon't know how I got that idea, but it came into me the last minute when I asked me what\nam I doing. I didn't have a ticket. I was still scared. When the rail -- the locomotive\nslowed down and the front of that city 1t was called and in the front of\nthat city there were a lot of Germans waiting I guess checking on those people who were\nsmuggling and when it was slowing up, it was dark already, and I jumped off. Where do\nyou go now? I was just running in the direction of the end of the train. Dark, I went\nthrough a little river up to here, and down across was a forest and I didn't know, you\nwouldn't believe it, I was hoping to God and I was sorry I left Warsaw. I was real sorry,\nbecause I didn't know where to go. It was dark, cold, wet. I couldn't sleep. In the\nmorning some elderly lady, a woman, was carrying a can of milk to distribute. I asked\nhere where am I. I spoke very good Polish. I was very good at it. She says, first she\ngave me a little bit milk. She says you're so wet, what happened? I said I got in in that\nriver and I don't know where -- I got lost. There's a little city called Varka (ph), not far,\nyou go there. I think it was Sunday morning, I figured I'm going to go. What do you do?\nI went to that little city in the morning and the sun came out and I dried out and I see all\nthe people are going to church, so I went down there to. I was afraid to stay behind\nsomeone else's house, and I seen a lot of those very old ladies sat down begging and\npeople would give them. I sat down too, but on the side I wanted to dry out. One woman\ncame over and said, \"What are you doing little boy here between all these old people?\" I\nsaid I don't know. I haven't got any money and I have a family. My father was killed. I\nused it, I knew it worked. My father was killed -- they took out pieces of bread they gave\nme. Other people said this was an orphan. His father was killed. They gave me bread\nand little pieces of sausage. In the meantime I dried out and they gave me a few dollars,\na few . The first few dollars I had. They were selling crosses down there in\nfront of the church. I gave the few dollars to that guy, and I got myself a very large size\nof across. I figured it's going to help. And I continued that day, I stuck around in that\ncity. I went again, I was afraid to stay there. I was always worried if they ar going to\nrecognize me or not. I figured if I keep going, I'll be dried out. It's a small village. So, I\nwent through like a forest, and in this forest the German firm was cutting trees, I think for\nthe coal mines, the mines. There was a sign that was two days later -- there was sign\nwhoever works will get so many marks. In the mill in the forest they had like a trailer\nthere and it wasn't army. These were people, 1t was a company with Germans who were\npreparing those trees, and a lot of Poles were working there. I went over and I asked for\najob. I asked for a job and the woman she spoke German and Polish you know. To the\nGerman she spoke German, to me she spoke Polish. Don't you think you're a little bit too\nyoung. You had to be sixteen years old. But I was very skinny too on top of it. Don't\nyou think you're too young. You can't work because you're too young. So, one of the\nother Germans, a foreman said, and I understood what he was saying, tell me you'll take\nhim in and they'll let him clean up around us. Clean up the trailer. I'm telling you, as\nsoon as she said can you clean a little bit, nobody ever cleaned better than I did. I did a\ngood job. Then she asked me do you have anything to show who you are? I gave the\nsame story, my father was killed. I came from a certain city, North Poland, and I have\ngot nothing. She said, \"I'll tell you what. You work here next week. I'll go with you to\nanother village. We'll make a photograph of you, a picture and then I'll send it into the\ncity and they'll bring you a work card. I don't know, I think luck was with me at that\ntime. When she said I can have a work card, and she was good to me, because I really\nwashed and cleaned and helped. It so happened I got a work card, and I worked there for\nquite a while, maybe five or six weeks, until they liquidated the work place. We cut\nenough trees probably. They hauled them away in trucks. They hauled them away in\ntrucks. Now, where do you go now?",
        "A: Why certainly, at that time my name was , with a W. I figured I can't\nkeep my real name. I had to have a Polish name, a Christian Name, and they used to call\nme , So I didn't know what to do. Where do you go? Finally, they were\nasking, I went to another village. I already had a few dollars. The foreman gave me\nmoney. I was a polishing their boots, they had some horses, I was cleaning the horses, so\nI had quite a few marks at that time. So, I went to a small little village and then they had\na sign. I stayed by people. They slept on the floor and they told me there's a place where\nthey're looking for hands, working hands to help on the farm. And I have to go to the\nhead of the area, who was naturally a German, a commandant and these people used to\ncome and take the workers. They wanted them to have a lot of workers, because they\nwere supplying food for the Germans. The Germans were confiscating food at that time.\nSo, I came into a big place there, and I registered my name take a look I got working\npapers. They didn't ask me any questions. And a guy on a horse and buggy took me to\nhis farm, and I had to start working on a farm. They didn't know who I was, whether I\nwas Jewish. I had certain problems there. After a week or two I had to go to confession.\nNow, my father never went to confession, my grandfather neither, and I didn't know\nwhat to say either. I understood what it's all about because the son of the owner had to go\nand went with me. We went later than the people. He went in down there and I'm telling\nyou my heart is just pumping, what am I going to tell the priest. What do you tell a\npriest, you know, I didn't understand. I never did it. Somehow I heard it. I was so\nscared I put my ear to the little entrance. It was a little bit ajar and I understood what he\nsaid and I asked him, he said just tell him that you didn't do anything wrong. I went in\nthere and repeated the same thing. I repeated the same thing and somehow it didn't work.\nHe took me out, it was a man I would say over eighty for sure, a priest. And he asked\nme, tell me your parents were not from the old religion , L understood\nthat if you didn't say they were not Jews I understood right away that he was not such a\nbad man. If he would have been a bad man and said they were not Jews, but somehow he\nwas very delicate about it. I asked what kind of people are those , he\nkind of winked at me and said if you don't know, you don't know, but an old man wore\nthose long robes, and I think, today, he recognized me, I was Jewish. I did not do the\nright thing I know it, but he took advantage of me later, you know every time I had to\nclean up behind him in his room, he made me do it.\nTape #3",
        "A: He was a very nice man. He never bothered me. I think he recognized me and I did\nsome chores for him so I didn't have to go back to confessions. On a whole he was a\nheck of a nice man, because I used to go every other Sunday to him. And I worked on a\nfarm, and I did anything people had to do on a farm and of course, since I was not used to\nit, it was horrid, but I was very happy. I had food. The people down there treated me\nwell. I worked -- I think I ran out of work and to the best of my recollection I needed\nmoney because I didn't get too much money from the men but they gave me food,\nclothes, very nice catholic people. So, I worked for a baker. I went to work in a small\nlittle village not far. A little city for a baker, the place was called Garbutka (ph).\nWorking for the baker, he was a very nice man, and I worked all night. From what I can\nrecollect, that's the first time I found out of the Holocaust with him. Once we were\nthrough we sat down outside to rest. It was like it wasn't even daybreak yet. A train\nwent down not far. A train went down there not far from there and he said\nyou know something, these Germans are going to pay, and they're going to pay heavily\nfor the kind of barbarism they are doing now. He told me in Polish. He was mad. He\nwas a good man, and he said, you know something, these trains which you see going\nthrough, they are burning people alive and getting them through the chimneys and Jews.\nI heard that and everything inside of me started shaking. I did not believe it, you know. I\ndidn't believe it that this could happen, something like that. They're burning -- I looked\nat him but I said I got very good information that that's what they do to people. One day\nthey will pay for it. I was uneasy already, very uneasy. And I heard, not far from there\nthere was a little Jewish Ghetto. That Ghetto was --what they did the Germans got\ntogether shoemakers, what do you call it, tailors, other let's say people who were good in\ncertain trades. They got them together, and they worked for the Germans. This was\nalready after they liquidated most of the Ghettos, and these people were living maybe a\ncouple hundred of them and one man a shoemaker used to come to me the baker and he\nused to hide his shoes. I think he recognized me that I was Jewish. A very nice man, and\nhe told me about the Jewish Ghetto, because he used to get out of the Ghetto, all the\nshoes, bring them into Ghetto, make some money and brought them back to the village,\nmade some money and came back. One day, being in this little village, something must\nhave happened some provocation or something, the Polish people around there were\ndoing something, the underground which wasn't to the Gestapo liking. They must have\ndone something bad. I didn't know anything about it. All of a sudden, I want to tell you\nsomething, my mother comes to my dream she says listen -- everytime something\nhappened bad my mother came to my dream. She said in the morning you run away from\nthere, and with that kind of thought I wake up and I , they are shooting\npeople all over the village. They are shooting people in the village. I kind of remember,\nbut it was hard to escape.",
        "A: What I'm trying to tell you is they had some kind --from what I know now, I didn't know\nthen, there was a provocation, the underground, the Polish underground probably robbed\nor took a lot of food out of the trains which went to the front. So they brought some kind\nof punishment, a company of Ukrainian all kinds of real butchers and they started killing\npeople on the street. I look out and the priest was even taken in chains. I was looking\nout and I figured I'm going to run. And I think I was running better than Tarzan and I\nran, but the wheat was that high and in Poland they did not have big estates, just small\nlittle parcels of land. So, in between there was one parcel of land and the other, there was\nwhat they called in Polish , like little streets, and they were having a guns\nmachine guns down there. Anything moves, boom. I got in between and I want to tell\nyou I was going and I figured this is the end, and I kind of ducked every minutes. After\nthey shot, I got through. I finally got through and where do I go now. I remind myself\nabout that Jewish Ghetto. I'm going to run there, and it was about a couple kilometers\nthere. I was running away in my shorts. My whole body was full of blood from I was on\nmy chest walking on my chest because I was afraid if I put my head up that was the end.\nWell, I finally reached that place and they let me in. The Jewish people were watching\nthemselves too. They didn't know yet, but they had an idea. They heard all the shooting\nand I told them what happened. I told them listen I'm Jewish let me into this group, and I\ntold him about that man who used to hold my shoes down there. Sure enough they went\nin there and he came in and took me into his house. It was very early. I was a stranger.\nEverybody was sleeping yet. His wife, he woke up his wife to wash me up, because I\nwas full of blood, and I was sitting figuring, what kind of life was that. I was really\ndisgusted. I could have been killed a couple hours ago. All of a sudden I seen the same\nGerman marching in on this place. I was a stranger and sitting behind the door and\npeople were still sleeping behind every little house seven Germans, SS men would stand\nthere, their guns pulled out and one of them, all of a sudden I saw that this must be the\nend. But I was behind the door, a stranger, and they opened the door. They went to\nevery home, and all of a sudden one of them walks in and said all the men out. I never\nknew that so many men were in one little house. This guy -- so I look out through that\nwindow, through that opening, boom. Everybody that walks out boom, got a bullet right\nin the back of the head. At that moment, you wouldn't believe it, I saw myself dying\nthere, and I saw a film in front me, all my life, I saw like a fast film, my life and I figured\nthis is it there where I lay. Now, I turned into glue, I tell you. There was no escape. One\nguy was outside chasing out and the rest of them were shooting, one by one, in every\nhouse in front of them. The German who was chasing out, took me by my back and\npulled me and I didn't give a damn. I didn't want to go. I knew I'm going to be dead and\nI was half conscious. So, there was one of them in the front a tall SS man. I don't know\nwhat happened but he turns me around and says in German , he's a\nlittle boy. go back. He looked me in the eyes and go back. I want to go\nback, but I'll never forget that guy who chased out everybody from the house, a big\nGerman like this, and assessment aren't you killed yet? I started begging\nhim. He didn't shoot inside, he was holding the gun like that, but the women all of a\nsudden they saw what was happening they tore me out of his hand. The women, because\nthey -- they killed some women, I found out later, those who resisted killing their\nhusbands or their sons. Somehow there was scattering all those Germans so this German\nlet them tear me out and he went outside to shoot others and they told me in this little\nroom, the next room, the Germans were not there. They tore off the door and I go in\nthere. There was a lady there who started crying. To the other women you brought us an\nangle of death to me, that I am going to spoil it for them. And they had a\na little basement and one side was a bath the other side and a basement\nabout three by three. They must have been hiding food or something because it wasn't\nvery deep and the old man, the woman's husband was shaking he was afraid to go down.\nHe was an old man. And I got the idea if he go down I'll go down with him. There was\nno escape. These two girls, one that mentioned, the two girls one of them didn't let me in\nand the other one said let him in. Finally they pushed the father in because the SS, the\nGermans were running around looking for men to shoot. They got him, but the elder\nsister didn't let me in, so I kind of got in, the girl pushed her away. I got in with my head\ndown and my feet up. There wasn't enough space and I held the old man like this. When\nthey saw the Germans approaching, they closed it, closed it very fast. They went and the\nJewish people did resist at that time. They were looking around. I think they were\nscared themselves too. They were shooting in one bath if someone is not there, then the\nother bath, and I laid between and the little girl said I want to go with my Grandpa to that\nlittle basement and then I passed out. I honestly don't remember having any conscious. I\ndon't remember until about four hours later, these two girls with another woman they\npulled me up. They pulled up their father. The people were killed already. I could\nhardly regain my consciousness because my head was whirling. I didn't know whether I\nwas still alive or I'm dead. They pulled me out and there was a heap of dead people, like\n120. They pushed me in between and I took some and I bloodied myself to make sure\nthat the women had to go, they disappeared, most the SS went away. They did their job,\ncruelly. I was laying between the dead and a couple of old local Germans were to write\ndown how many. They pushed me up, I pretended I was dead. I was waiting. They took\nthe women to dig a big ditch for their husband and they put all kinds of lime in there.\nThat's what 1 heard. Then the women came back and they put us out. I was almost night,\nand they put us on a big horse and buggy. All the dead, I pretended I was dead too. They\nleft a couple of Jewish policeman or ordinals, they left them alive, they helped pull it up.\nOne of them squeezed me. I knew that he knew that I was alive. When we went\nsomewhere I remember because after the war I went to take a look down there. I was\nonly about 100 meters from the big ditch, and we made a turn after I decided to jump off.\nI don't think anybody did any shooting. Nobody did any shooting. I ran. I didn't know\nwhere I'm going. My head was whirling. All night I was running like a dead person. I\ndidn't know where I was going and what's going to happen. Until I finally saw a little\nman and I told him that I worked for this guy and this guy in this village where I worked\nfor the baker, so they gave me some clothes and they washed me, another farmer. That's\nhow I survived this massacre.",
        "A: It's called Garbutka.",
        "A: It was somewhere around either July or August 1942. At that time, we heard, because I\nrelated that that they were killing older Jews, or killing all the Jews in Warsaw. That's\nhow I remember that. Anyhow, that's was the event, and that's why I told you off camera\nabout this girl, that woman who saved me is in Montreal today, and I recognized it two\nyears ago in Italy.",
        "A: The woman who helped me get into the basement. She had another sister who did not\nwant me to get in there because they wanted to save their father. Anyhow I got out of\nthis mayhem and I went to work for another -- I think 1t was again a smaller little farmer.\nI was afraid to go back. Eventually I went back to the camp, but what happened is I ran\ninto another small little city and they took me to a camp. This was some kind of a camp\nfor Poles. There was some Jews too. Not far was called . I think I\nwas working there only two weeks. Also, they surrounded the people but supervision\nwas done by Russian P.O.W.s and they were working on -- they were crushing stone to\nmake some kind of a -- to go through some kind of a street. My job was -- again I was a\nlittle boy so they put me on a little lorry to hold the two -- to kind of brake and somehow\nI forgot my way and instead of braking I pulled the thing and naturally the guy, the\nforeman, he was German, started jumping and threatening me, and hitting me and\nbleeding me. He says I'll take care of you tonight. I want to tell you, an hour later I said\nI have to go to the bathroom, bloody, and I kept on walking and I escaped. That was a\nlittle camp I wasn't long there, a couple of weeks. Then I remember another event when I\nwas in that village and there I really literally found out about the holocaust. We were\ntaken to work down there near a train, and every week a train would come from Holland\nenclosed wagons, they had some wires across and there was a bag for water, and all the\nboys, including me, we were running to get some water, because these people I knew\nthey were Jewish people. They were screaming in Jewish. They couldn't talk Polish, half\nGerman, but they were from Holland. And they threw gold and money and give you\nwater. My heart was just the same thing. I was crying to myself. What the heck is going\non, and I knew which direction they were going already. The whole families and they\nwere crying and looking through the thing. Of course I didn't care about the money but\nsome of the kids cared about the money. I didn't want to be different. I picked up too.\nThis was going on for a few weeks. Every Thursday a train would come and I was\nwaiting with water and other boys were waiting with water too, for money, some of them\nI felt very sorry for those people. One day, a train comes and I waited. This was just an\nevent I must tell you. I'm holding a bucket of water and a train comes but not that kind of\na train, opened, and German police not SS, but police were talking to these people, stop\nthe train. They always had to stop. I don't know whether they had to fill up with water,\nthe locomotive, so it stopped and I looked in. Believe me I hold the bucket of water for I\nthought first class, all Germans and they talked to each other. I was smart enough to\nknow which is an SS man, which is a policeman. I had a kind of education over the\nyears. So, I was educated in this respect, so I go ahead and I take a look at it. I hide my\nwater and take a look what's going on and I look in there. They were wearing medals.\nThere were beautiful people, , so a German, I hesitated, he's going to get like\neverybody ten marks get in there and bring him the water. I took the water out and I\nstarted giving they had like little cubicles. I walked over to one man and he was\nreligious, religious Jews were they called it, and I recognized that he's\nJewish and all of a sudden I look at the rest of the people and all of a sudden I knew they\nwere Jewish, because the guy who was the head, a little guy next to him, he asked me in\nGerman , So I told me slowly , Means\na killing place in German. So, I kind of mentioned him. But I was very scared saying it\nwhen they said , | just jumped off the train with my empty bucket.\nI spilled the water and I ran as far as I could. I know my heart was crying because I\nknew in a couple two or three hours nothing will be out of them. They must have been\nVIPs from Vienna. Some of them had medals. In other words some of them must have\nbeen soldiers in the Austrian army. This was the last time I went through to the trains. I\nwas really afraid. But when I found out at this time really about the Holocaust.",
        "A: Where I'm going?",
        "A: I told you the first time I found out the truth the baker, he told me that in this direction,\ngoes down there to a place called and from there it goes down to\nand they knew. The local population knew. They were witnessing it.\nI don't think they were happy the Polish people regardless of their feeling. They still\nknew that human beings are being burned alive. I saw in the eyes of my baker, catholic, I\nsaw he was very angry. He said one day they are going to pay for that crime. I couldn't\nsay I was Jewish, but my heart and everything in me was whirling. I really didn't believe\nit. But slowly after the trains, and also there were runaways. Jews were hiding. Those\nwho jumped out of the trains. I can't go into in this interview all of the particulars, but\nthere were incidents -- there were incidents where I saw Russian escapes. I gave them\nbread, anything we had because somehow they were begging for food because they\nescaped and most of them were caught anyhow. But the Russians were really, really\ntreated bad by that time, the Russian POWs. They used tell me some of them. I worked\nin the fields and they would somehow run through those fields and ask me if I could\nbring in a piece of bread.",
        "A: From what I knew, do you mean sabotage the Jewish problem or sabotage against the\nGermans?",
        "A: There was quite a bit, I want you to know. From what I know and from what I observed\nthe Polish people were very patriotic, and they hated the Germans regardless and let me\ntell you the Germans, the SS, they did not treat the Poles nicely, not even nicely. They\nwere killing them off quite a bit. They were killing them off. And they had their\nunderground, which was run through London and some of them, most of them in the\nvillage by us were hiding and we were hiding all kinds of guns and ammunition and I\nused to be chased out sometimes in the village to find out what time the train goes to\nRussia to the front, because sometimes this underground would jump on one of the trains,\nbut on the edge of the train and steal whatever they could, food, ammunition. So, the\nPoles, they were putting up a hell of a resistance.",
        "A: Where they put on a resistance. Not a specific but I knew and I saw because the people I\nworked for, they were really engaged in that underground activity. I wasn't on a specific\ndid anything specifically because I was young.",
        "A: You want to know how much time. I was even late before, I was after that I worked in a\ngun powder factory, and also they had a lot of Jewish people down there working for\nthose good chemists. They got together all those people who they didn't liquidate if they\nasked look what did you do, if he was a good chemist of physicist they needed for\narmaments so these people worked in a big factory down there, and I happened to go in\nto them, to the Jewish people. Then I stayed with them a few months and then I escaped\nback to the villages, but to answer you how many -- what did you ask me again?",
        "A: Hiding through the rest of the war 1s the answer. I was never free. I either was inside,\njail was inside or I was hiding outside. I was not hiding because I had to hide, I was\nhiding because I was scared. Just about I would say a year before the end of the year, the\nPolish resistance was very great, and I was scared at that time they grabbed all youth I\nwas scared they were going to recognize me, so I escaped from there. I went back to\nwhere the factory was, not far, and I was hiding personally because there was another\nproblem. Amy boy whether they were Jewish or not Jewish, any boy was either arrested\nto kill because the Poles had an uprising in Warsaw and the people they I would say the\nPolish army was gathering to go help the people in Warsaw. I was afraid that they were\ngoing to -- I was with them really, it was called at that time ,a\nPolish Army, but I didn't want to go to Warsaw and I was afraid they were really\nmobiling young kids to go to Warsaw. However, I escaped. I was more afraid that they\nwere going to recognize me that I'm not Jewish, because being in the village somehow I\nknew the people, but strangers, groups, underground there were all kinds of people and\nsome of them were they were very good and recognizing Jews, I want you to know. So, I\nescaped the forest and then I was hiding wherever I could. But his was the real way I\nwas saved. I was hiding in the haystack and all of a sudden I see two guys. I was with\nanother fellow. Not to be killed the Germans were after him. Germans SS, Gestapo,\nthey had all kinds of you know, people who were looking to kill us. So, I was hiding and\nall of a sudden I seen two guys whom I recognized they worked in the gun powder\nfactory and they escaped from there. One guy knew the area very well. He's the one who\npractically saved me. He's in Toronto now. I was just with him in . His\nname is Silverman He knew the area and we tried to get across the lines, the lines\nmeaning the Russians were advancing. We were on the other side. The artillery was just\nunbearable from the Russian side. We tried to get through the to go to\nthe Russian side, but it was impossible. There were virtually hordes of German army\nwhich they retreated to this other side of the water so we couldn't. They had another line\nwhich they were preparing in case they had to retreat. So, we were between the first line\nand the second line of the German defense. It was horrible. It was bad. I used to inside I\ndid not look Jewish, I used to go out and somehow organize bread and water and we\nmade bunkers, deep bunkers, winter, deep bunkers and we begged, we got some food.\nWe were hungry all the time and that's how until the Army came across. It's a little\nharder for me, but it didn't take long. It was very hard because the German army with\ntheir dogs and all that they were retreating and they at that point they didn't especially\ncare who they killed. If we were in their way between both lines and that's how\neventually I survived. I think it's enough for me now. I'm getting tired.",
        "A: There's still a lot more for me to say, but it's very hard for me to go on.",
        "A: Why certainly.",
        "A: The Jewish Ghetto, no, but I saw Warsaw. I was aware of the burning and I was aware\nthat there was a Jewish uprising because it was full. Everybody was talking about it in\nthe villages and the cities. I came back down to Warsaw and Warsaw was completely\ndestroyed because after the Jewish uprising, after the Jewish uprising, then there was a\nPolish uprising before the Soviet Army came in, and they killed quite a bit of Poles, a\ncouple of hundred thousands. They guarded themselves pretty good, but the Germans\nwere overwhelming with tanks and everything. When I came back, Warsaw was burned\nto the ground.",
        "A: I didn't see the Russians, but that was about the time somewhere in 1945.",
        "A: Well, number one it was I wasn't too smart to think about those things. I was trying to\nsave myself. I knew that I'd never see my brothers and sisters. That I knew, yet the will\nto live and to one day survive and like now to tell people, it was a certain thought of it\nand I was lucky.",
        "A: Well, let me tell you, I went to church for quite a while, but whenever I could avoid,\ncould avoid. I never heard because the church never teaches anything harsh against Jews.\nI just felt strange amongst it because I was brought up in a Jewish religion, so I let it go\nby what the priests say with a grain. Let it go, okay, some of it I absorbed and some of it\nI forgot and that's it. But I felt Jewish --not that I felt Jewish, I felt very scared every\ntime I went from village to village and maybe they could recognize me. I felt Jewish, all\nright.",
        "A: I was resenting a lot of times. There were times when they took kids, in the villages, they\ntook them to Germany and I was very scared because I was circumcised and I thought\nthat whenever they had something like that surround and take the kids to Germany from\nthe villages, I was hiding and very fast because they used to say they take them a certain\nplace and because the Germans wanted only healthy people, so somewhere near\nthey would take them to quarantine and checked whether they don't have any\nt.b. They wanted healthy people. So I was afraid if I was going to undress before\ndoctors, they'll recognize that I was Jewish. So, I was very sure, at the risk of my life to\nescape those situations where they couldn't catch me to Germany. Funny thing,\nsometimes I figured I could have gone because one of my neighbor boy was caught then\nhe escaped from Germany he told me didn't have anything like that. They took us\nstraight in there. It would have been easier for me if I would have gone. I was aware that\nI was circumcised. Every moment of the day, it hit me.",
        "A: Let me tell you, during the war, I really thought that God as a German. I thought they'll\nnever be defeated, the kind of cruelties, the way they were. I would say the SS and all\nthe Gestapo and all the apparatus. I will tell you, you would never they were barbarians.\nThey were not human beings, these people who were running Poland at that time. The\nSS, the Gestapo, and all kinds of other names they had. I knew how strong they were.\nTo say that I was glad to be Jewish, I want to tell you something, and this is the truth, I\nwas just mad a my God, first of all mad at my father that he made me a Jew, and mad at\nmy God that we had to suffer so much, what for. That was my first feeling. A lot of time\nI talked to God. When you get desperate you start talking to something. You've got\nnothing. I would just put my eyes up and I asked why, why wasn't I born a dog, a bird\nwho could jump over the Ghetto walls or a catholic. Why was I Jewish. And there were\ntimes when I was really thinking that it's not good for me to be a Jew, if I ever live and if\nI have children, I said to myself, I would never let them be circumcised because this is\njust showing the enemy that you're not the same.",
        "A: Well, when I went to America, of course, in American I found out that I would not\ncircumcise my kids if it wouldn't be that they said in America they are circumcising\neverybody. I was Jewish. I got married and my in-laws they were Jewish too, and I let\nthem circumcise my two sons. If I were to live in Poland, in Europe, I would never let\nmy kids by circumcise, in fact I would even try to be a non-Jew, because what for?",
        "A: Believe me, I knew I was Jewish, because there was some persecution in Poland too,\nafter the war. And some of them came back from Russia or those who survived never\nmade it even amongst the Polish people. There were some Poles who were not happy yet\nwith Jews surviving. I wouldn't say some, majority were just people.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Eventually a year later I escaped from Poland and made my way to Germany.",
        "A: Definitely I went back. I was looking. I was trying to find out if anybody's 1s alive. I\nknow they're not, but maybe, of course, I was trying. I went from village to village and I\neven put my name in on certain areas because I was afraid I was taken into the ARmy. I\nwas afraid that somehow my sister by the writing on the wall knew that I'm alive. She\ncame back from Siberia, from Russia.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: To record I could just tell you one thing. The worst for me was the Ghetto Warsaw. It\nwas worse than hell. You couldn't imagine -- hell was worse. I can't imagine that the\npeople could be surrounded, not fed, children my age and worse was smaller children,\nwere just laying in the street begging for food, dying and no body even paid attention.\nThey just picked them up in groups, on lorries and they you know when I look I wonder\nright now, always my heart goes out for them. Because what I saw over there, I saw the\nreal stuff, I can relate that to what's happening. But the worst was the older people, the\nepidemic of typhus. I want you to know I had typhus at certain time, we skipped. I had\ntyphus too, but it was hell on earth. The worst was Ghetto, was hell on earth. To give\nyou an example, I want to say something. After the war I always looked in the eyes of\nGerman women. Why. You'll ask me because I saw one girl, one woman, I'm going to\nrelate it to an incident. I know already hungry kids, we knew which are good Germans,\nw which are bad Germans, who's going photograph us and they used to come into the\nGhetto, like tourist, show how Jewish people are dirty, how they live in poverty, how\nthey just are a heap of people who wouldn't be so bad to kill. That was their real idea.\nOne day like a little truck opened in small little like a pickup and I looked at it from far.\nEverytime a German pickup like this came into the Ghetto, everybody ran because you\nnever know when they're going to catch up, but I was a little from far I\ncould recognize these were airmen. They were airmen so I figured I'll wait and I'll beg\nfor bread. I wait up there and they stopped and they want to make pictures. I thought\nvery good come a little close. So, I said they can't photograph me unless they throw me a\npiece of bread. So one girl came a little close and she grabbed me and hit me right\nbetween the eyes. A girl, must have been a husband or boyfriend, a German soldier, says\n\"Now tell me why did you do that. He's just a little boy,\" to that woman, and I'll never\nforget her. After the war I was looking in the eyes of every German girl and I couldn't\nunderstand why a German woman, maybe she was 18, 19 you know something like this,\nwhy she would do it to me and I didn't get any bread and I wouldn't take any bread\nbecause to me shame was worse than hunger. Then they went on, but she really gave it\ntome. What got into those people. What kind of people were they? Either they were\nbarbarians or they were just got out of the caves and to go ahead and hate, make us\nmiserable, and on the contrary they tried to I would say prosper on our misery. They\nbrought in people to show our people are dirty people, loused, not really prepared I\nwould say prepare the stage where they could kill us because we are not worthy living\nand they are the ones who really brought this up because slowly they weakened\neverybody in the Ghetto. No food, dirty water, no hygienic anything which we could be\nclean nothing but sickness, people dying on the street, they weakened us and they made\nus like no humans and it's very hard for the majority of people to even resist however a\nlot of older people remember the Germans where they were good people from the first\nWorld War or they lived with them in Poland and they couldn't understand, they would\nnot believe that they could do it to us. They didn't believe that the German would\neventually kill all of them. They couldn't imagine, however, by slowly depriving the\npeople of everything taking away all their privileges, taking away their education,\nmaking them look like raggedy people they prepared, they were preparing they figured\nthat these people are unworthy to life, and it was their fault, because scientifically I'm\nsure they did it all scientifically to get rid of the Jewish people.",
