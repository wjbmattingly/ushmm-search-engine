        "Q:Good afternoon, Renata, it's nice to have you here.",
        "A:Hello.",
        "Q:Can you tell me the name that you were born with and where you were born and when?",
        "A:I was born Renate Laqueur and I was born on November 3, 1919, in Brieg, Germany. Today that\npart of Germany is Poland, because it\u2019s Silesia and it\u2019s near Breslau. I was shipped from\nGermany three weeks old to Holland because my father emigrated to Holland in 1919. So,\nthis is why I'm more Dutch than German.",
        "Q:Can you tell me about your early childhood and about your family?",
        "A:My early childhood, let\u2019s say, was of course in Holland. I grew up in Holland, went to school in\nHolland. My father and mother were both German and had their parents still in Germany.\nWe used to visit my grandmother in the summers because my grandmother's home in Brieg\nwas a jewel of a house. It was a big house with a beautiful garden and a tennis court and a\nswimming pool and in...in the twenties my mother's father was a...what do you call it? He\nwas making paper stuff, let\u2019s say, like folders and writing. There's a word for it, I forget\nwhat it is.\nAnyway, he made his money in this factory, or firm, in Brieg and she had the money.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMy father was an intellectual. He had studied medicine and was mainly interested at that point in\nmedicine and pharmacology. He never practiced medicine but was a Pharmacologist\nEndocrinologist and the interesting thing about this is that in the early twenties he starts in\nHolland to work for slaughter houses because he wants the hormonal products of horses and\ncows because they begin the first hormone preparation in his laboratory in Amsterdam. He\nwas first in Amsterdam and ended up as the Dean of the University in Amsterdam in the\nthirties and forties. Anyway, he... In his laboratory they discovered testosterone. So, he is\none of the first hormone researchers and I grew up when you asked me about childhood,\nthat my father would put Ponds Cold Cream on one cheek and another hormone cream on\nthe other cheek to see which one worked better. I think it was the Ponds. O.K. Early\nchildhood, what more do you want to know?",
        "Q:Brothers and sisters?",
        "A:Let me just quickly tell you about my mother because my mother was the artist in the family. She\nsang. She painted. She was a terrific painter and terrific singer also a good looking woman.\nTitian kind of reddish hair and lousy taste in everything except in art and music.",
        "Q:What do you mean?",
        "A:Lousy taste because she wouldn't throw out a thing and she would buy crap because she was\nstingy. So, we didn't grow up in a house full of beautiful objects. We grew up with whatever\nwas available. Never had a decent new bought dress in my youth because that's the way they\nwere brought up. You get hand me downs. We were five children. There was an older sister\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nand older brother. Me and my younger sister, so five. I think one of the reasons why I got\nvery orderly and very much into beautiful things, whatever, was a reaction to this kind of\nwild household.\nBut intellectually I think I owe both my parents the interest in literature, art, medicine, anything.\nAnything except politics. Politics did not play a role. Religion was a very strange situation\nbecause my father and mother were both Jewish racially,but had never, ever been in a\nsynagogue. Even in Germany, so my father was born 1880. My mother was born 1883. I've\npersonally never been in a synagogue except when I travel and if I'm in a group or if I'm in\nTurkey then the guide goes and shows me a synagogue.",
        "Q:Were you conscious of the background of being Jewish?",
        "A:I was conscious of this background and made more conscious of it by a sheer fluke. The schools\nin Holland are not like here, private or public. Every school was public. You went to public\nkindergarten, public lower grade, middle school, whatever and then high school is\nGymnasium. To go into a university you had to go at that time into a certain school which\nprepared you for the university. If you went into a trade, there was another school. But if\nyou had...If you didn't want to go to university, I couldn't make it to the university school, I\nwas too stupid. I jumped from what they call a girl's school into the second class of the\nGymnasium. I wasn't all that stupid I was just in protest. What made me very interested in\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nreligion, I was 11 or 12 and I had to go, let's say, into the school where you either go to\nuniversity to stay in a trade school or you could get a girl's education. At that time it was just\nnothing. And, I was a biker. Like all Dutch kids, you were born on a bike and I biked and I\nwas careless. And they wanted to put me in a certain school which was right around the\nneighborhood because then I wouldn't bike so far and come home with a broken leg or\nwhatever. I got put into that school.\nIt was a so called Hervormd Lyceum which is not only Lutheran but it is the Reformed Lutheran\nchurch, so the most Calvinistic sect of the Lutheran church you can be in. That was my\nschool, because it was in the neighborhood. Then the school moved out of the neighborhood\nand I was in the school anyway, but there comes my religion. My religious background was\nSunday school, Christian. It was prayer every morning and so and so on. And it had some\nJewish children. I wonder whether they were there because it was the neighborhood. I think\nthey were there because it was a very good school. And so, this is where the Christian\nbackground comes from. The other thing, there is a habit in my family which is very\nGerman that came Christmas around, number one we had a tree. Number two the kids were\nsupposed to recite the Christmas story under the Christmas tree. The oldest kid first and by\nthe time it reached me and my sister, it must have been close to the middle 30s, Hitler was\nthere already because I was born in '19. So this was the Christian background. Jews were\nnever mentioned except after '33. '33 the first immigrants came from Germany fleeing Hitler\nand my father immediately got into committees, helped and was on refugees committees.\nWe had refugees all over the place, and we were aware of it, how lucky we were that we did\nnot grow up in Germany but in Holland. I had also problems in school because they knew\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nthat my parents were Germans and the Dutch kids hated Germans. They had nicknames for\nthem like in France the Bosches and we called them the Moffen.\nI was always the child of a moff father, which was a German father. The problem was that he was a\nprofessor, that he lectured at the University and that he was so ungifted with language that\nhe never learned decent Dutch so that the students finally said, \u201cProfessor Laqueur do us a\nfavor, talk in German because we can't understand you.\u201d So, he lectured in German, but\nwrote in German, English, whatever they wrote in at the time. I think they all still wrote in\nGerman. Nobody wrote in English, in medical text. Dutch, you didn't write because nobody\ncould read it, but they wrote German. They changed it. Science was German.",
        "Q:Tell me about your brothers and sisters?",
        "A:Brothers and sisters. The oldest sister was a woman, was a girl and she died after Bergen-Belsen.\nNobody knows about this. I never mention her in the diary. She was over 40. She was born\nin 1906 so if the war was from 1943 to '45 she was over 40 or close to 40 and anybody who\ngot typhus died over 40 because of the high consistent fever for 15 to 16 days and whatever.\nShe lived outside of Holland for part of her married life. She was married to a doctor in\nCzechoslovakia and then came my second brother. My second brother, Peter, studied\nmedicine and biochemistry and also got into endocrinology. He immigrated to South\nAmerica just before 1940, in 1939 because there was a branch of the factory which made\nthe hormones, Organon, which was part of Hoffman La-Roche. So, there was a combination\nof pharmaceutical, endocrinology pharmacology on that side.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMy brother, Peter, was an M.D. and Ph.D. and in South America. He emigrated later on after the\nwar in 1946 to New York and switched to psychiatry because of the drugs. The third brother\nwas five years older than I. He did study medicine, but flunked out because he had the\nfeeling, you know, you studied medicine because your father and your brother studied\nmedicine. And he became a businessman, first photography and film in the 1930. Went to\nthe Berlin Olympiad to film. I just saw on PBS the other day and I realized that Hein my\nbrother was there for the Olympiad just to film. He was born in \u201814 so he was 22, 24. I\nguess. And the younger sister, Lilo, 1s the one who lives in Boston. She was born in 1922.\nWent to school in Amsterdam. All the other kids went to normal schools. They went to\npublic schools. Nobody went to this Lutheran Calvinistic outfit where I went. None of them\nwas as Christian as I was, because I saw it. I have to pray and I also tried to become a\nCatholic but that's a different story. I had a Catholic boyfriend, but never Jewish. So, Lilo\nmarried in Holland a German refugee who was in international insurance, marine insurance\nwith whom she immigrated in 1947 to New York and she lived in West Westchester and\nhad three children and is today retired in Boston. She's a registered nurse. Again, medicine,\nthere's always medicine somewhere. That's the kids.\nNow, my mother died in 1959 and my father died in 1967! in a very strange situation. He was with\n' Renata misspoke here; her father died in 1947 not 1967.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nhis girlfriend in Switzerland and he was somewhere in Zermatt near the very high\nmountains and the Swiss Post Auto, you know, one of those busses squeezed a woman who\nwas running against the wall and she died. And he, as a physician, was called in and while\nhe was administering help to this woman, he died of a heart attack. He had a bad heart, bad\nkidneys, bad heart, so this is the story of my father and there were write ups all over the\nNew York Times, all over Europe. Ernst Laqueur died while he was trying to help\nsomebody not to die. A question...",
        "Q:What was dinnertime like at your house with all these kids and your parents, what kind of a ...?",
        "A:That\u2019s an interesting question. First let me tell you about the food. The food was always too\nmuch and too heavy. Everybody was heavy. I learned. My people in New York told me I\nwant to be -- what do you want to be. I said, \u201cI want to be what I should be.\u201d She said,\n\u201cYou cut everything you eat in half.\u201d* I never went on a diet. I lost what I had to lose and\nstayed that way for the rest of my life. Father disciplined because children were brought up\nnot to talk unless they were asked questions. Children were there to be looked at, but not to\nbe heard. We were very well brought up. We also had nannies. We had a nanny, we had a\ncook, we had whatever and the nanny was, in many ways, more important than the mother.\nThe mother was there when you were sick and when you were in trouble with your father,\nshe would mediate.\n? RL: \u201cMy doctors asked me, \u2018What do you want to be.\u2019 I said, \u2018I want to be what I should be.\u2019\nMy doctor said...\u201d\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMy mother was called, surprisingly, an avalanche which rolls up the mountain. She was that\nforceful. She ran the house in many ways and my father was the guy behind the desk,\nalways on the phone, always public relations. I learned public relations from him. Public\nrelations before the word existed. Team work, working with people was my father. My\nmother was an individualist and totally you do what you feel like as long as you don't run\ninto trouble with the law, and that's it.",
        "Q:Was she warm?",
        "A:Was she what? Yes, very warm, but also very egocentric. If she was warm, you were warm., but\nif she was cold and she didn't understand you, she wanted you warm, and it wasn't that easy.\nThe sense of humor strangely enough was my father. He had a kind of a understated...he\ncouldn't have survived with that woman next to him if he wouldn't have had a kind of\ncertain distance and a kind of an ironization of his own position.",
        "Q:Did you think they were in love with each other?",
        "A:No, and I think this has been one of the traumatic things. I never talked about that because to me\nit's so natural that I always knew he had girlfriends, but I also knew that the girl friends were\nnot sexual and this is something which I never understood. Girlfriends were achievements.\nThey were either just -- I hope this doesn't go anywhere because this is purely personal --\nthey were either very beautiful or very famous or both or they needed him because he could\nprovide whatever they wanted. It wasn\u2019t persecution. It was a very complex relationship\nbecause I think sexually he didn't function. I found that out by talking to one of them. I\nmean, I was the one who became very...and there was another thing. I had tremendous\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nproblems as a teenager and as a young woman because my father was afraid of\ntemperament. Afraid of passion, afraid of sexual involvement and he warned me, he said\nyou're dark. I was dark. Today I'm gray. You look like a gypsy and you look aggressive. I\ndidn't even know what he was talking about but I understood much later that this was his\nfear. He loved me and he said, \u201cYou will never need to do anything except get married.\u201d I\nthink I started at the ripe old age between 40 and 51 to prove that I could do other things but\nget married.\nBut when you ask me, \u201cDid they love each other?\u201d They may have been in love for a very short\ntime, but again to give you the 19th century, when he married my mother, who was, of\ncourse, a virgin when he married her in 1905, he said, \u201cIf you don't have a son or a daughter\nin a year, it's over.\u201d So, in other words, he wanted to propagate and I don't know -- I don't\nknow whether these stories are true but this is what I remember in my family and there are\nother things that I remember which are not showing love. You're so long together, you stick\nit out.",
        "Q:Were you close to any of your brothers and sisters?",
        "A:I was very close to my middle brother who was five years older when he was very young and I\nbecame very much estranged from him in the last 20 years of his life because he was to my\nmind, too narrow minded. For instance, he never forgave me that I went back to Germany.\nHe never forgave me that I wrote the dissertation and that I kind of published our\nbackground in the sense of, from my grandparents already tried to escape. \u201cAnd now you\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\ndescribe this whole business again, what it was to be a German, now you get involved in the\nwhole Hitler aftermath.\u201d\nThat became very difficult because I thought, \u201cHow narrow minded can you be. You know damn\nwell it's not my problem.\u201d I am delighted that I survived and I had the guts to write a diary.\nThen somebody else picked it up and published it. I gave it to a publisher because it was\nthere in Holland, it was nothing. It was typed, but I never did anything with it. I have\nactually never done anything until now. This is the last time that I try to get this published in\nEnglish. I've had it. Let 1t sit somewhere.",
        "Q:What did you like in school, what subjects?",
        "A:You better say what did I not like. What I didn't like was science and math and anything to do\nwith that which wasn't language. I loved geology, geography and all that stuff but no\nmathematics, no science. Even when I came to New York and I wanted to study I talked\nColumbia and NYU into giving me a year off so I got instead of 128 points I only had to do\nwhatever and I said no science. I'm never going to go anything with science. I regret it today\nbecause I ended up in medicine at the age of 60, but anyway. I liked going to school. I liked\nto learn and I like kids and I like to be with people. I have no problems. I had a very good\nchildhood. I was strong, tough and I loved to just play. No, beef at all. I had a wonderful\nchildhood. I knew I didn't get the stuff I wanted in clothes. I knew I didn't get ever a room\nwhich was filled with beautiful objects. I always saw them but I knew I wouldn't get them.\nLater on I did get them, so what else?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "Q:When you graduated Gymnasium --?",
        "A:Eighteen. I was eighteen. I wanted to study and my father said no. It was 1938 and he said my\ndaughter doesn't go to university and he was right. He said, \u201cYou first learn something\nwhich you can do anywhere in the world.\u201d I mean this was '38. The war in Munich had\nhappened and peace was just a matter of negotiation and most likely never, and he said,\n\u201cYou can go to University maybe if you have done this, but go to secretarial school.\u201d He\nwas right. He said, \u201cYou're good in languages. You're good, learn shorthand, typing,\nbookkeeping, all this stuff.\u2019 He sent me to the best secretarial school, an international\nschool in Holland and I did this for a year and a half and I had a diploma. I ended working\nin Montreal when I immigrated in French, German and English in shorthand because I\ntranslated my Dutch into whatever and so on...I could make a living wherever I was.",
        "Q:When the Nazis took over in Germany --?",
        "A:That was in May 1940 the Nazis took over.",
        "Q:I know in Holland, but I'm talking about what was happening in Germany. Were you thinking\nabout what was going on in Germany? You had your grandparents --?",
        "A:I was constantly...Only one grandmother and the grandmother was brought to Amsterdam. I\nforget which year, but she certainly came--either in \u201830--after the Kristallnacht, so after\nNovember 1938. Maybe a year earlier but I don't remember that. But she was my mother's\nmother. She came. I was not concerned about family. I was concerned about, quote unquote,\n\"the immigrants,\" because we were made to feel guilty that we had to do something because\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nthere, but for the grace of God, would we be moving, so I resented them. If you have to do\nsomething, it doesn't come from the heart but it comes because your father said like they\nsaid later on, \u201cEat your stuff because the people in Europe are hungry.\u201d",
        "Q:So, what were your obligations?",
        "A:Obligations were to see and be with people who were in deep trouble. These were my\nobligations. We were told that tonight, let's say, a conductor or a professor or a this or a that\nis coming. You know, we had very many people who immigrated, who came via Holland\nand went on to America. I remember a house full of famous people who came through.",
        "Q:And they stayed with you?",
        "A:They stayed with my parents and the sponsorship was always the business about how do they get\nto America, because they have to have the guarantee of a sponsor and so on. You know, the\nfinding relations and connections and this is what I remember about immigration and\nwhether it was people they talked about whether it was a Thomas Mann or whether it was a\nBruno Walter or who was or whatever or chemist or musician, he was also into music\u2019.\n> R.L: Here Renata is referring to her father.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nHe was a board member of the \u201cConcertgebouw Orchestra\u2019, so this is Lincoln Center. So, we got\nall these people from the theater, from the concerts, from music and from science and I\nremember life was interesting but there was always this feeling of guilt. Guilt by what\nwould...I think I'm talking now with hindsight. I'm not sure that I thought this or I'm making\nit up. If you are a kid between, let's say, 10 and 16 and you're constantly surrounded by\npeople you would have been if your parents wouldn't have done this or that, that's it.",
        "Q:Do you remember any particular people or conversation, did they engage with you or were you\nalso sitting there being a very quiet young lady?",
        "A:No, I was never quiet. No, I asked questions but I remember fascinating, being fascinated by\nstories by the first -- honestly Joan, I don't know any more what is memory and what I'm\nmaking up. This is why I don't like this kind of interview. You talk about something which\nyou feel today. Iam not 100 percent. I am terribly aware of authenticity. This comes through\nmy research and the feeling of afterwards, pre, during, and afterwards and what you felt\nbefore something happened or while it happened or what had happened afterwards to\ndifferentiate which is the real thing. I can only swear to what I really remember almost\nphysically, but if it's purely mental, it's very difficult to remember a conversation. I\nremember all kinds of faces, all kinds of discussions about music, art, going to school, but I\ndon't know who said what, so I don't want to talk about it.",
        "Q:Were there ever any children that came through with these people or were these mainly men,\nfamous men, who were coming through?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A:There were families, but I don't remember any children. I only remember that they would come to\ndinner or that the word was said, \u201cThere's another one coming.\u201d So, it was -- I wish my\nsister were here, because my sister would say how come you remember the annoyance\nfactor. Joan, I have never thought about it. I have never voiced this. This is the first time,\nwhen you said, \u201cHave you ever talked about it?\u201d No. That's so interesting about it. The\ninteresting thing is that you go through it and you come out of it, and that is I think is not my\ndoing. It's sheer luck and chutzpah.",
        "Q:When the war starts in Poland in 1939 --?",
        "A:That I remember. September 3, you first get the declaration of war of the English. I'll never forget\nthat because the radio was on day and night, BBC, whatever. Holland was free. We were on\nthe radio. There was no television, but when Poland started, that was the beginning of the\nend.",
        "Q:Do you remember that a few months later or around the same time that Westerbork opened for\nillegal refugees?",
        "A:I don't remember but I know about it historically because I read about. I never heard about it,\nnever. I didn't hear about Westerbork. I don't know. I may have heard about it because I\nthink one of my \"cousins\" came via Hamberg where his parents were, he came through a\nchildren's camp into Westerbork, which was just before the war. So Westerbork was a kind\nof receptacle for immigrants.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "Q:Now, were you conscious of the Nazi party in Holland?",
        "A:No, never heard about it until May 1940, and not even then. Only I would say after the surrender\nwhen the queen had left and the NSB didn't kick up. We knew there was such a thing like it\nwas something in Britain. Also there was something in Holland. There were people who\nwere anti-Mussolini, we knew that. I\u2019m trying to think. I think in my Gymnasium class, I\ngraduated in '38, there was definitely a color line against the people from the colonies,\nJavanese, what you call the Katjang and there was Anti-Semitism and Anti-Catholicism.\nThere was a lot of anti- stuff. Protestant versus Catholics reminds of Ireland and Holland. You have\na very strong division line where the river, the Rhine, and the--anything below is Catholic\nand anything above is Protestant. So, the northern Frisians don't talk to the people of\nBrabant because they are Catholics versus Calvinists.",
        "Q:How did that affect you?",
        "A:It affected me very much because I was in a school which was pretty anti-Catholic because it was\npurely Calvinistic. I mean I learned about these things. It didn't affect me, but it didn't affect\nme except that I don't know how these things affect you. I have never gone to Spain except\nunder duress because I was raised in Holland. Because of the Duke of Alba and because of\nPhilip II and when I wanted to go to the Escorial in Madrid my husband said, \u201cAre you\ncrazy?\u201d\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nThis goes back to your history teaching of Holland between the age of six and the age of 12. I said,\n\u201cThat's it. Who wants to go to Spain.\u201d This biased we were. Because the 80 years war never\nstopped in Holland. That's why I understand the Irish so well.",
        "Q:When you say that there was Anti-Semitism as well as Anti-Catholicism --",
        "A:Anti-Semitism in the sense that they thought Jews were people who--Wall Street--didn't exist for\nus, but who were were either bankers or, usurers, medieval thing, or they were selling\noranges on the street or, what is it? Voddeman. Old clothes.*\nSo, Jews were either bankers... They were neither lawyers or doctors. Not like in New York or in\nAmerica. But there were these kind of medieval restrictive kind of thoughts and yet Holland\nis the place after all with Erasmus and the philosophy and the Jewish philosophers. So, it's a\nweird place to grow up. Very advanced and very restricted. Advanced in the sense that there\nwere sea farers and everything with the sea and broadening the horizon and going all over\nthe world and being Dutch meant that you traveled and at the same time being very narrow\nminded. Sitting behind a tiny little window and looking into the street. You know the look\nout corner of a window?\n*Voddeman: seller of old clothes, ragman.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "Q:Did you have any identification problems at this point given what was going on with the Jewish\nrefugees coming in? Did you identify with them, as much as you may have resented them?",
        "A:No, I didn't identify in the sense except for a feeling of gratefulness and thank God I'm in\nHolland. To me feeling that anything would happen in Holland didn't occur to me. That\ndidn't occur until we got the Wehrmacht, the orders from the occupational army to fill in\nforms that you had Jewish grandparents and I remember my wild resentment to my father.\nI said, \u201cDon't be such a goddamn Prussian, don't fill in anything.\u201d Ifhe wouldn't have filled it in we\nwould have been all okay. Because--That's why I kept saying Prussian prejudice and\nPrussian education. There's another problem that also comes out in the book Schreiben KZ\nin the introduction, because my German editors insisted that I give my story about my father\nand he said, \"If you don't give it we have it in the Frankfurter Allegemeine Zeitung\nArchives.\" So I said, \u201cOkay, here it is\u2019. He is born in 1880. He is a German. He 1s a medical\nprofessional. He is a teacher at the universities, various universities. The war breaks out in\n1914. He is a German. He volunteers into the army as a medical officer. Imagine growing\nup in Holland and having a father who was a volunteer in the German army. Okay, number\none, he is then, because he is a Pharmacologist he is being sent to Belgium. In Belgium the\nhave a Gas Schule, a Gas School in Berlin where they experiment with poisonous gas for\nthe war. From '14 to '18 Laqueur is in the gas schule. He only does research. He has no idea\nwhat the research is for, but he does research as a Pharmacologist. He's being sent to\nBelgium as an occupation army, you know, from '14 to '18. He ends up with a death\nsentence in Belgium because they say, \u201cIf you ever come back we'll kill you.\u201d So, for the\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nrest of his life, when we were children, he travels to Switzerland where we have a chalet in\nthe summer. He travels on the Belgium French side, we travel in the third railroad car with\nmy mother on the German side\u201d. These are the things they knew in Germany and my friend\nand editor Martina in Frankfurt said, \u201cRenata, if you don't tell us these stories we have them\nanyway because the Germans knew about this.\u201d I think it's only funny, but of course I don't\nblame my father. If you were an American and if ...we have never been occupied in\nAmerica, but if the occupational-- yes we have been occupiers. We have occupied\nGermany. We have occupied whatever. So, if you then do something because your\ngovernment tells you to do this or that, do you or don't you? But there are other things\nwhich made me nervous about this interview because my own bad conscience comes in, I\nhated to be my father's daughter in Holland.\nI never forget the last talk I had with my father in 1947 before he went to Switzerland and he was a\nsick man, he had cardio and kidney problems and I said, \u201c\u201cWhy did you go into the army?\u201d\nWhy this or that and he simply had no other explanation but, \u201cThis is my duty.\u201d Again the\nPrussian. Duty, honor, --ugh.",
        "Q:So when he puts down that he has Jewish parents --?",
        "A:Then he gets like everybody else, a \"J\" on his identity thing. My mother gets a \"J,\" and his\nchildren unless they were married to non-Jews and then they started working around it. My\n> R.L: Here Renata is referring to the third class railroad car.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nmiddle brother is exempted because my mother said, \u201cI had another guy and he's the son of\nanother guy.\u201d And this gets all taken into paper and it's all very complicated and so he is\nout of the story. My sister isn't married so she still has a \"J\" and she lives with my parents,\nand I am married and I married a Jewish boy who was baptized, Paul. We wanted to\ndisappear, you know, go underground and my father said, \u201cDon't do this because if you do\nthis you endanger my staying and, let\u2019s say, being tolerated.\u201d Because the Germans,\nbecause of his relationship to the industry, to the pharmacological industry, they wanted\nshares so badly of his outside involvement in South America and in America and they tried\nto pressure him into giving them access to his money. He never did.",
        "Q:To your father's money?",
        "A:They never succeeded but meanwhile they kept saying \"Laqueur, you can stay in your house.\nYou can do whatever you can do,\" but of course his job was gone because he had to be\nsacked as a professor because you couldn't stay in the university if you were Jewish.\nBut they left him until the end of the war. Of course there were stories about it that he sold his\nchildren to the concentration camp because he could stay home. Nonsense. It had nothing to\ndo with him. We were arrested because we were Jewish. We had a \"J\" and I had done some\nillegal stuff, and a...and stuff, documents. It's a very complicated story. Anyway I ended up\nin prison in Amsterdam and then a Dutch concentration camp which was worse than\nanything else. Then being shipped to Westerbork and then my father, with his good\nconnections in the Hague and with Berlin, got me out of Westerbork and I came back out.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nThen Paul and I said to my father, \u201cNow it's time that we go underground, because I don't\nwant to be shipped ever again to Westerbork.\u201d The transportations were going to the East.\nWe didn't know what happened there, but I didn't want to be shipped. He said, \u201cYou can't\ndo this. You just stay where you are. I will try to salvage whatever I can.\u201d He bought us\nEcuadorian passports. We got Venezuelan passports. We got immigration stuff to go to\nPalestine. We had everything, every paper in the world. Then we got picked up because\nwith the Germans there was always one word, Bis auf Wieteres, until further notice.\nSo, in other words, if you had an exemption that could explode from one hour to the next, and our\nso called Stempel, stamp had expired and we were shipped to a so called preference camp\nwhich was Bergen-Belsen. At that time it wasn't a concentration camp. It was for the\nchildren of notable people.",
        "Q:Can we go back? First I want to --",
        "A:I'm talking much too much.",
        "Q:No, that\u2019s the idea. Tell me how you met your husband. I want to get a little bit of a sense of who\nhe was.",
        "A:That also has to do with the war. I met Paul in May '40 when we were overrun by the Germans. I\nmeet him bicycling with a member of a family that I knew and I meet him and we fall in\nlove. It's May, June 1940. He's my first man and being well brought up you marry the first\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nman. We have a love affair and then I tell my father that I slept with him and he almost\nkilled me for that. I said, \u201cDon't worry, we'll get married.\u201d He said, \u201cYou shouldn't get\nmarried because you will get divorced right after.\u201d He was right, but he said, \u201cDo you want\nto marry?\u201d I said, \u201cYes, I want to marry because otherwise we can't live together.\u201d Because\nthere were certain orders from the Germans that you couldn't live in this city and in that city\nyou had to live together. They were making restrictions on where you lived and what you\ndid and so on. It was the ghetto mentality already. So, Paul and I got married and the two\nfathers, Father Goldschmidt, Paul Goldschmidt, his ancestry was German but he had been\nthree or four generations in Holland and Father Goldschmidt and Father Laqueur got\ntogether and said, \u201cThose kids are going to get divorced as soon as the war is over. What do\nwe do about our money?\u201d\nSo, they said that each kid whatever they brought into the marriage would go back into their own\nfamily, and boy did that happen. But this is really very personal. When Paul and I got\ndivorced in the 1950s, after I met my second husband -- this is a story I have to tell you, but\nit's purely personal. Anyway, to get to the money first, it got divided very nicely except that\nPaul said, \u201cI can never pay you for saving my life.\u201d I said, \u201cYou don't pay me. That\u2019s a\nnatural. I either saved your life or I let you rot.\u201d So, whatever it was we got very amicably\ndivorced. I gave him some share of my father\u2019s LaRoche Organon stuff and he gave me\nsome other stuff, but these are civilized marriages. \u00b0\n\u00b0 Renata Laqueur has added an addendum to her interview release form in regards to the words:\n\u201cLaRoche Organon.\u201d She does not permit these words to be used in any publication or production,\nincluding literary, print, audio, audio-visual, computer-based or any other medium now known or\nwhich may be created in the future.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nWe are still friends. The story of how I met Paul and how I met my second husband. Paul had been\na speech therapist. He had dyslexia and that way got into speech trouble and interested in\npsychology and psychiatry but he had never made the Gymnasium so he could never study\nmedicine. 1950, after the war, there were stories, there were children and also no children\nand all kinds of things. In 1950 the first international speech therapy congress convention 1s\nin Amsterdam and Paul says to me, \u201cDo you want to work for that? Do something because\nyou're good with people and good with money and all that.\u201d And I said, \u201cI will be the\ntreasurer.\u201d I'm the treasurer, the general secretary of that international convention comes\nfrom New York. He is Deso A. Weiss, M.D.\nHe has been Paul's teacher when he was a kid studying in Vienna, because he came from Austria,\nVienna, Prague, whatever. Paul knew him and admired him as his teacher and his professor.\nHe was 18 years older than me so he was also 13 years older than Paul. He said, \u201cDon't ever\nstart anything with him because one of these days I'm going to America and I don't want my\nwife to have a relationship with my professor.\u201d You only have to say, \u201cDon\u2019t start,\u2019 and\nRenata starts. A week after I meet this guy, ten days, I said to Paul, \"Paul, you're absolutely\nright.\" He doesn't know it yet, but I\u2019m going to get this guy. I'm going to marry him.\u201d He\nwas in a bad marriage, no children. I knew about that. It had nothing to do with anything. I\nachieved that after four years. He was my second husband. He was the great love of my life.\nThat\u2019s Paul, Deso, and Renata. Everything was very friendly, very whatever. How did I\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nmeet Paul, we were young. We had the first sex and he liked my family. He said it was the\ncraziest family he ever married into. I liked his too, but they were different. They were very\nformal, very -- totally different background. Totally business people, very rich. Not showy\nbut very established and we were so bohemian. I've been talking for an hour. You said you\nwanted to give me a break after half an hour. How much more do we have to do?",
        "Q:Where were you living when you got married?",
        "A:The first time or the second time?",
        "Q:The first time, we're back in the war?",
        "A:Amsterdam, and actually that is nice. I have a picture of that. Amsterdam, Burgerlijke Stand,\nwhich is the civil authority, no church, no nothing, no synagogue, no nothing, just a civil\nmarriage. We were married on the 24th of December 1941. Christmas 1941.",
        "Q:Who married you?",
        "A:I don't know. Some official in the -- what do you call it the registry where you're married?",
        "Q:A civil ceremony?",
        "A:A civil ceremony. I don't know who it was. I just remember the second time when they said,\n\u201cTwo dollars please\u201d in New York. That's all.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "Q:So, did you have a big party?",
        "A:No, but I remember what I wanted for my wedding meal?",
        "Q: What?",
        "A:I wanted frankfurters and I wanted sauerkraut and I wanted chocolate pudding. All things you\ncouldn't get, and I got them on the black market. My mother got it. I wanted frankfurters,\nmashed potatoes, sauerkraut. I mean my taste has changed.",
        "Q:Was this typically Dutch?",
        "A:It was Dutch. I mean, the frankfurters were not frankfurters, they were called something else. We\ndidn\u2019t put the word \u201c\u2018frankfurter\u2019\u201d to it. It was called Wiener Wurst, Viennese, and it was\npotatoes with gravy. You know as a kid you would have potatoes and you would make a\nhole in the middle and then the gravy would go in there and you would spoon this up\ninstead of a fork. And then they would always say, \u201cDon't eat the potatoes first. Eat your\nvegetables first.\u201d",
        "Q:Were there vegetables at this particular wedding?",
        "A:No, there were no vegetables. I wasn't yet a salad eater or veggie eater. I was still a meat eater.\nThat's it. But only frankfurters. I didn't like meat.",
        "Q:Did you go away after the wedding? Did you have a little honeymoon?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A:No. We had no honeymoon. We went... ah I forget where we went. We went to somebody's\napartment. We had been living together. It was no honeymoon. We said after the war we\nwould travel. I'd never been to Paris. So the things like that.",
        "Q:One last question and then I think we'll have to take a break. Did he have a J on his passport\nalso? On his identity card.",
        "A:I don't know. I don't know! I guess so. I'm not even sure that I did, because I don't know anymore\nwhether I had one or whether I just always hid it. I only know we had to wear that damn\nthing on the yellow star. That was the worst part. The feeling of always trying to hide it, that\nyou had the star. You know we had to wear it on our clothes when we went on the street.\nAnd the restrictions was one of the part I remember, was the restrictions. You couldn't do\nthis, you couldn't do that. You couldn't. You had no freedom. Taking away first your bike,\nand then no street car, and then no park and then this and then not this. And then all this, it's\nan unbelievable feeling. It has me, altered me so that I practically don't want to sign any\nform. I revolt against any signature on any paper, because of the effect of, if you put it\ndown somebody else is going to abuse it.",
        "Q:And let's take a break.",
        "A:Yes ma'am!",
        "Q:We'll start with the restrictions when we come back.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A:We start with the restrictions? I'm very comfortable by the way. I don't have to take my jacket--\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nTape #2",
        "Q:Renata, tell me about the movement of the restrictions that you felt because now you're identified\nas a Jew in some respects, yes?",
        "A:The restrictions I felt then or restrictions today? Today I feel no restrictions.",
        "Q:No, then.",
        "A:This is one of the reasons why I'm particularly happy in New York. There are no restrictions. It's\nthe freest city in the world.",
        "Q:No, I mean with the occupation of Holland?",
        "A:The occupation? What I felt is having grown up as a happy child and being with \"normal\npeople\" who went to school or into business or whatever they were doing to be singled out\nas something which is in somebody's eyes, now I'm going to get into the concentration camp\nagain, where you are vermin. Here we weren't vermin, we were just abnormal. We were\nsingled out because we were something they wanted to get rid of. And, to be singled out is\nsomething which I have never liked. If it's good, not, and if it's bad, not because I like to be\njust able to be free and choose the fact that I had no more choices. My choices were taken\naway, whether I wanted to go to the park or to the movies or take a street car or buy\nsomething not before 3:00 in the afternoon and not in a certain store. It is something that\nI've always objected to. Not having choice and it gets the worst when they imprison you,\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nbecause you have no choices.",
        "Q:How did you find the Dutch population, your friends that you had before, now that you're under\nthose restrictions and they're not?",
        "A:The interesting thing is, Joan, I thought about it but I just don't remember anything. I don't think\nthat I lost anybody. I don't think I saw anybody less. I don't know. I have no memory\nbecause I'm such an egocentric and selective memorizer. It's a good question. I don't know. I\nthink nobody really reacted wrong because I didn't know anybody who was in the pro-\nHitler. And don't forget that it is a very free and open society and democratic which is over\nrun by a tyrant so that they were all against him. And whether I was singled out, they were\nsingled out if they were Catholic or Communist or homosexual or whatever. There were so\nmany people singled out. It wasn't just Jews. You were a victim because, you were what do\nyou call it? Occupied. Occupied means they sit on top of you and you have restrictions.\nAlmost everybody had restrictions. The Jews had different restrictions than other people.\nThere was constant curfew. There was black out. It just occurs to me that the atmosphere\nbetween 1940, I was only there from 1940 to 1943 was one of constant interference with\npeople's lives. You couldn't just go to school and learn, you had to learn what they said was\nokay. You couldn't just sit in a street car because maybe there was a Wehrmacht, or a\ngeneral or whatever. Maybe there was a razzia\u2019 on the street and they were rounding up\npeople to go to work camps or Jews to go to whatever.\n\u2019 Razzia: a roundup (Italian).\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nThere was always something going on which had to do with the occupation. I cannot differentiate\noccupation from personal persecution because I didn't suffer really any personal\npersecution, never. I was very lucky. I wasn't dragged by my hair. I wasn't tortured. I wasn't\nthreatened except once during the first interrogation in the prison. That was no fun, but they\nsaid, \u201cIf you don't tell us where you have those papers from,\u201d I had false papers, I\u00ae said,\n\u201cWe're going to stick you in the water until you talk.\u201d I said, \u201c Then I can't talk.\u201d I mean to\ngive you examples. I have had situations where personal chutzpah has saved my life. One of\nthem is I think in the diary. I walked in Bergen Belsen on a very hot July afternoon. We\ncame back from work and I was working in the kitchen. I was working in the kitchen\nbecause not only could I eat, but I could steal for Paul and there was a can of pork meat. As\na Jew you don't like pork meat but when you're hungry who cares. And I take the pork meat,\nthe can and I turned it inside into my bra and I had work overalls and I walk through the\ngate where the SS is to count us, you know ,when we come back and I had no idea that there\nwas a fat stain from here to there over my left bosom and the SS man says, \u201cWas ist los?\nWhat's the matter with you? Ihnen geht wohl die Milch ab? You lose your milk?\u201d I said\nyes, \u201cThat's what it is, can I please go quickly back to the barrack and wash myself because\nthis is awful.\u201d At the same time I had under my hair which was long and I had a net under\nit, a half of pound of margarine or butter. So, if they would have caught me -- I mean I was\nlucky. But you see, when the guy says, \u201cWe stick you in the water until you talk,\u201d I said,\n\u201cThen I can't talk.\u201d I yelled right back and he also. I mean, I was lucky. But these are\npersonal things and I was terribly afraid of torture, terribly afraid of pain, terribly afraid of it.\nBut these are always things you hear or dream about and are scared -- still I\u2019m terrified of\ncertain things. But...\n* R.L.: Renata meant to say, \u201cThey.\u201d\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "Q:Were you connected with any underground groups?",
        "A:Only an underground group who was making false identifications and this came through my non-\nJewish family of Paul whose sister was married to a resistance fighter who was in prison\nand tortured and beaten and sent to Dachau and whatever, and we were involved with that\ngroup and we were lucky. Once again lucky. They found only my papers. They never found\nthe one of Paul and that is the reason why I was arrested alone without Paul first and sent\nalone to prison and alone to Westerbork and my father pulled me out. And Paul was home.\nAgain, sheer luck. His false papers were a little further under the floor boards and of course\nthey wanted to know whether I knew anything. I didn't know anything about it. I didn't\nknow where they were.",
        "Q:Where did they find these papers, at Paul's sister's?",
        "A:They found them in Paul's sister's husband's hide out. He was already wanted because he had\nbeen a director of the music conservatory and he was a famous young guy and he was a\nresistance fighter and, somehow there was...there were traitors that had betrayed him. They\nfound whatever his hideout and they found under the floorboards, false 1.d. cards. I mean\nproof of identity which were fake and which, of course, were given to Jews and to people\nwho were fleeing to England. There was always going something on in Holland. People are\nstill trying to get to France and to Spain and to England and so on. So, they found us. And\nthey had me with a picture.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "Q:So they came after you?",
        "A:They came after me.",
        "Q:How did they find you and where did they find you?",
        "A:They found me in the apartment we had rented very close to my parent's home and they came in\nand they were Dutch. They were not Germans. They were the Dutch police. This is what I\nremember and they said, \u201cWe have a warrant for your arrest.\u201d I said, \u201cWhat for?\u201d They\nsaid \u201cYou'll find out when we take you to our jail.\u201d So, I told myself, \u201cDutch jail, that's not\ntoo bad. That's not Gestapo.\u201d Dutch jail was under the Gestapo. I found out why there were\nGermans. And then they more or less -- I don't remember the thing because I've repressed\nthis whole thing so much. They confronted me with the fact that they had my papers and of\ncourse I was going to a concentration camp, if not worse, you know, whatever they\nthreatened and I ended up in jail and I ended up in jail with -- a Dutch jail -- with about six\nwomen in a one person cell. I only remember the smell, the closeness, and the fear. And I\ndon't know how many days but the whole thing lasted about ten days and then I was shipped\nto a Dutch concentration camp in the South of Holland and I had a stamp on my 1.d. card,\nwhich was not a regular...which says S, which means Straf Fall, so I was a punishment case.\nThis is how I was delivered into Vught and Vught would transmit me to Westerbork and\nWesterbork would transport me eventually to the east. We didn't know anything. This was\n1943. I was, I think, four weeks in Vught.",
        "Q:What was that like?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A:Vught was the name. V-U-G-H-T. Vught was the name. It's a concentration camp in Breda, near\nBrabant, Dutch.\u2019\nThen shipped in a train to Westerbork and then in Westerbork I was freed in July. So it was from\nFebruary to July. And in Westerbork I got pulled'\u00ae by connections. I don't know how\nanymore, how exactly out of this so called S barracks, where they would take the people and\nship them without any further procedures into the freight cars which were standing every\nTuesday and every Friday in Westerbork chugging along to the east. That's it. Then I came\nback and from July until November 1943, Paul and I lived with all the restrictions in\nAmsterdam and then there was...",
        "Q:Can I interrupt? What were those few months like? February to July is not just -- it's not even\none month. It's not two months.",
        "A:It\u2019s three months...somehow I forget whether it\u2019s...Eighteenth of February to -- almost five\nmonths.",
        "Q:Did you work there?\n\u201d R.L.: Renata would like this to read: \u201cVught, a Dutch concentration camp in Brabant.\u201d\n'\u00b0 R.L.: Renata meant to say, \u201cpulled out.\u201d\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A:I worked every where.",
        "Q:What did you do?",
        "A:I worked everywhere. Wherever...I always used my languages. I worked either as an, I don\u2019t\nknow, interpreter or as a secretary always trying to do something to do with what I could\nwrite down things. I always found a job. Or in Bergen-Belsen, in the kitchen to get food, or\nwherever.",
        "Q:What was it like in Westerbork then?",
        "A:Westerbork was a camp like a kind of internment camp in a very bad physical situation because it\nwas built on sand and mud. That was a good lesson before you got to Germany, horrible\nclimate and run by Dutch under Germans and with still a lot of freedom. You could still do\nall kinds of things. You could write. You could get packages. There was music. There was\ntheater. There were all kinds of things in Westerbork and always still the hope that you were\nstill in your own country that one of these days it would end and you would be home. You\nwere only let's say as far as Boston from Washington, if that far. It's a small country.",
        "Q:But you were there at the time that the transports were leaving every Tuesday?",
        "A:Yah. Tuesday and Friday, I think twice a week.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "Q:So, that must have been a very difficult situation in the camp?",
        "A:Yes, but we didn't know what they were leaving for. They were leaving very often, very\noptimistic because they were going to work. There were no transports yet of old people, sick\npeople. No, nothing. This was also, if I remember it well, I have to be careful now because\nI'm beginning to wonder whether I know it from what I read or what I really went through.\nTo my mind, \u2018til July 1943, there were no transportation yet of the people from mental\ninstitutions or the old people or -- there were always Straf transports, which is punishment\nand we wondered what happened to those people. Because we didn't know whether these\nguys were put to work let's say in the \"mines\" in Mauthausen. We knew that Mauthausen\nwas very bad. We knew about that. We knew about the mines. We knew about the chemical\nfactories in Germany. We knew a little about Poland. We knew mainly about Germany.\nDon't forget concentration camps were in Germany. Something which I also found out with\nthe dissertation, no real, what do you call it, annihilation, last solution with gas was in\nGermany. They're all in Poland. Not in Austria, not in Germany. They were built east of\nwhere I was born, in Silesia.\nI always wonder why. Did they really think it would make the difference. They would get points.\nIt's interesting. Anyway, where were we? The five months. Somewhere if I can improvise,\nthere was nothing quite as bad as the fear of being arrested. Once you were arrested, you\nwere rolling with the punches. Because what you imagine is all from my experiences 1s\nalmost worse, you can't imagine things which happened later on. I didn't know I would live\namong the dead and the sick and the hungry. I didn't know what hunger was. I didn't know\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nwhat dehumanization was. I didn't know. You can't imagine.",
        "Q:Since you didn't go to Westerbork with Paul --?",
        "A:Yes, I did.",
        "Q:No, no, the first time.",
        "A:The second time, we went.",
        "Q:Yes, the second time you were but the first time --?",
        "A:To me this was old hat. I said it isn't so bad and it wasn't bad.",
        "Q:But the first time, did you make friends?",
        "A:Yes, I immediately made friends and friends who later on were sent on. When I had left I know\nthat they were -- they never came back. They disappeared. And I don't know if they went to\nBirkenau or Auschwitz or wherever they went. Of course I made friends. But again this 1s\nall like a dark hole. I don't remember names. I don't remember faces. I only know of certain\ncircumstances. I think the whole thing about the camps to me is everything I wrote in\nBergen-Belsen are facts. Everything I did before and after are part of a mechanism where I\nsomewhere struggled to stay above it, not get involved again. Talking about friends, talking\nabout family, talking about pain or illness, about whatever, but I can tell you one thing, it all\ncame back. Under anesthesia and when I had cancer and I was at Sloan-Kettering, 1992,\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nthey find colon cancer, invasion of the lymph nodes, chemotherapy, the works at Sloan-\nKettering. I'm again dreaming and fighting being strapped, being tethered to a certain thing -\n- my fight with the chemotherapist that I had to be once a week at Sloan-Kettering for a\nyear. After five months they stopped it because I had too many side effects. But I tell you,\nthis is something that goes so deep that I fight anytime when I need anesthesia whatever,\neven at the dentist. Since the war, I will not go under unless they absolutely hit me. Because\nI'm out of control. I need control to survive. And that goes very deep because if you ask me\nabout friends, love, decency, everything stops because I went through so much which I\ndidn't like what I did.\nAmong other things I ate Paul's bread, Paul's ration. The guy was six foot three and I'm just a little\nperson in comparison and I ate his bread and I did things which are not -- it's sheer survival.\nOne thing I never done and I'm very proud of it, I've never done any prostitution. I had\noccasion, but I didn't do it. Not because of moral thing, because I told myself that's stupid.\nBecause you do it with one you have to do , it with a couple of other people. So, I have no\nmoral convictions and I came out totally an amoral person. It went so far that Paul said in\n1945 when we were back home, that he said, \u201cYou've got to see a psychiatrist because you\nare totally demoralized. You don't know anymore what is right or wrong. You pick up\nanything you like because you think they owe it to you. Whether it's an ashtray or a cigarette\nor a piece of meat or a piece of whatever, you steal, you organize. You have no values. You\nhave no respect for anything.\u201d I went into therapy. It took about six months and then he said\nto me, \"Renata, you can do it yourself.\" I said, \u201cWho's paying whom anyway?\u201d But\nwhatever, I learned. I learned because if you live in a normal life where not everything is\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\ntopsy turvy you better adjust because otherwise you can't survive. So, I survived the other\nway. But I'm very bitter. I'm very bitter about things and especially when people complain\nand when people say, \u201cOh, but if Hitler wouldn't have been there and if this and this and this\nwouldn't have happened and if I wouldn't have come to America and maybe I should have\ndone this...\u201d I say, \"It's all up to you. Don't blame anybody. You came through anything.\nThe only people you have to live with eventually is you. If you can look into the mirror in\nthe morning and say it's okay, I'm neither criminal nor an addict nor a this or a that, it's\nfine.\u201d\nBut what you do under I would say the ultimate circumstance of either being dead or alive, I have\nno judgment and no prejudice about that. I can understand that. I'm always afraid of torture\nin the sense that if I've been I would do anything and I wouldn't blame anybody who has\nbetrayed a secret or an organization or anything. Do you understand what I'm talking about?\nWhat I'm so worried about is I'm put in a position where I have to make a real decision\nwhat will happen to somebody else. Let's say a situation where you know that your husband\nor your child or your father or your mother or your friend is being tortured or beaten and\nthat you could save them but you know damn well you can't save them because they beat\nthem anyway and they will kill you too. Joan, I don't like this digging into the past. People\nhave very often said to me, \u201c Renata, why are you doing this? Why are you going to\nGermany. Why do you go now to the Holocaust Museum and give them an interview?\nHaven't you been through enough? Why do you have to do it at all?\u201d I said, \u201cGod knows\nsomebody else can learn something.\u201d If you ask me one question, I'm asking you as if I were\nyou. Would you do anything different than what I did. I would say \u201cYes.\u201d I would not have\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nstayed in Holland. I would have accepted an invitation in 1939 to go to Berkeley. I had a\nfriend who wanted me to go to Berkeley and who knows? But otherwise, I might not write\nanother diary although I still write diaries today. I can't do anything unless I write it down. I\nreally am like the person who says I haven't lived anything until I have written it down.\nBecause then you objectify. You're kind of above it, not any more in it. I never write in\nBergen-Belsen in order to sit 52 years later in Washington and talk about things because I\ndidn't think it would ever be read by anybody, not even by me. It was my survival\nmechanism if I write about it, I objectify. I rise above it because other people were drawing\nor reciting poetry or thinking about food or thinking about the past.

        "Q:Did you do that during the war before you were picked up?",
        "A:Yes, right, I always wrote, but not diaries. I never made notes. It was the writing mechanism. The\nmere fact that you try to do something which describes it so that it's not you but it.\n'| R.L.: Bergen-Belsen\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",

I only started it on the day we get to Bergen-\nBelsen. I think I know why. Because it was foreign. I was in Germany. I wasn't home\nanymore. That may have been the idea.

        "A:I guess so. Father and friends. He went to the Hague and I had a German friend, I had a German\nfriend who knew people in the Hague who were not Gestapo who were army and somehow\nthat did work. It was a connection business. Again PR.",
        "Q:Now you said when you got out you told your father you and Paul really wanted to go\nunderground.",
        "A:I didn't say it the same day I came home, but during the month we were home. I said, \"I think\nthings are getting very tough, and I don't want to want to get back into Westerbork.\" I never\nmentioned the idea of being shipped, because we didn't know. We really didn't know. But I\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nwanted to go under. I wanted to possibly try to get to Switzerland. You know the illegal\nroute. And of course Paul's brother was arrested and was killed on his way to Switzerland.\nAnd other people in the family tried it and got killed. They never came back. I mean they\ntried to get to Belgium or wherever and they were killed. Some people made it to England\nbut much much later or earlier.\nQ. So you decided to pay attention to what your father was saying and not go underground?",
        "A:Yes, we decided, we were set!*, \u201cBut then you bring me into danger. Because if you guys\ndisappear the Germans will wonder where you are because you're part of my, my\nreservation.\u201d Reserved until further notice. Reserved from persecution. Preserved, reserved\nyou name it.",

        "A:I don't know what I did. I suppose we tried to buy things on the black market and survive the best\nwe could and listen to the BBC. What do people do normally? I don't know. It would have\nbeen very interesting if Paul...and I want you to get to Paul in Germany. I have the address\nand the phone number.

        "Q:Tell me why the two of you were picked up the second time. Do you know why?",
        "A:The second time we were picked up, because it was a general tightening up on people in\nNovember in 1943. They were beginning to round up people and begin to ship them via\nWesterbork to the east. I don't know why we were picked up. I only know that they came in\nand say, \"You go to the Municipal Theater.\" That is the gathering point and then we, you\ngo to Westerbork. And then in Westerbork we were supposed to stay. Because we again had\nthe right kind of papers. And then in Westerbork we got the notice. That we were going to\nBergen-Belsen. We were in Westerbork from my birthday November 3 until the 15th of\nMarch 1944 and then we were told in Westerbork that we were going to Bergen-Belsen\nwhich was a so called preferential camp.\nAgain, through the connections of my dad because we were not being sent east.",

        "A:In Westerbork?",
        "Q:Yes.",

Yes, we were in communication and\nwe were not in communication but not like picking up a phone or sending a postcard, but\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nthere was some connection. We knew more or less that they were alive and they knew that\nwe were doing okay. We could also get parcels. We could also get parcels in Bergen-Belsen\nfor a while. That came through the Red Cross and that came again through connections in\nSweden and whatever connections one had.",
        "Q:Did both of you work when you were in Westerbork also at this time?",
        "A:I don't know. I think so. I think...I definitely worked in some administrative job and I don't know\nwhat Paul did. I don't know. He was still in good shape and I think he may have worked\neven in speech therapy, because wherever he worked he tried to do his professional thing.\nEven in Bergen-Belsen. People do what they are. So, but not officially. I mean, you don't get\na job and you don't get a pay check.",

        "Q:Yes.",
        "A:I thought I was still very, very angry that we were going to Germany. Depressed, I can't\nremember depression until much, much later in life. No, depression is not the word but\nangry, yes. Angry and kind of feeling the \u201cvictim\u201d that I'm being shipped like a parcel. The\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nimpersonal aspects of something. Later on in life I learned in America that this is where we\nare going here. The impersonal -- I worked 1n a big cancer center and the impersonal dealing\nwith government. And the people can't do anything. You're helpless. You're being managed.\nManaged care.",
        "Q:Paul said to you much later that you were amoral, that you became amoral?",
        "A:Yes, my second husband said, \u201cYou're a monster,\u201d and I had been in psychotherapy and Paul\nsaid, \u201cYou're amoral. You can't survive this way. You must learn manners. That's not the\npoint. You must learn you can't do certain things. There are the ten commandments. The\nonly thing you don't do is kill. Otherwise you steal, you --.\u201d",

        "A:I think that this is a terribly important thing. I call this \u201cvitamins\u201d. If you had a childhood with\nvitamins of diversity, you will never ever lose that because you will always play games.\nYou will always fantasize. You will do something. It's very interesting. One of the titles of\nthe diaries from Dachau is Jmagination as Weapon. So, in other words, I had a very\nimaginative, imaginative surrounding and imaginative childhood and parents and brothers\nand sisters who were serious but also playing with life. There were very few rules and very\nfew restrictions and as soon as the restrictions begin I get angry and I protest.\nStill, I think at age 76 I should have learned to keep my mouth shut and to behave.",
        "Q:Can I ask you whether you know why Westerbork in someway is vague to you in your memory?",
        "A:Why is it vague? I'm trying to think. The first answer is always what you should say. The first\nanswer was that it was so messy. It was so disorganized. There was nothing. It was not final.\nI think it has something to do with the fact that it was so close to the border with Germany\nphysically. It was a transit camp, transit to what...Transit forward, backwards, back home. I\nhad been there once and had gotten out. I felt in Westerbork that it was a kind of a\ncontinuation of the kind of...Bohemian is not the word. I don't know how to say it. It was\nstill not really restrictive. Yes, of course there were guards and there was barbed wire but\nvery far away. It wasn't right -- the guards were not all over the place like in Bergen-Belsen\nor in the concentration camp inVught. It was kind of a family interment camp. I think why I\nremember so little is that what came afterwards left its mark much more. And don't forget,\nphysically what I have been through since Westerbork, typhus, encephalitis, you name it I've\nhad it. The cancer hasn't helped, especially the chemotherapy, but that's over now. I see my\nsurgeon Friday.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",

        "A:My preparation? There was no preparation. I mean I can't -- maybe Paul remembers it. I don't. I\ndon't remember whether there was any preparation of what to take. You took everything you\nhad. You had a suitcase. You stuffed everything in it. I remember my preparation for jail.\nThat I'll never forget. On the 18th of February... Again, because it's very personal. On the\n18th of February they ring the bell in the evening. It must have been eight, ten o\u2019clock,\nbetween eight and ten in the evening. I had no idea. They are the Dutch police and they say,\n\u201cWe have a warrant for your arrest. You're going to jail.\u201d Now, it was right near the central\npart of Amsterdam. I said what can I take? He said you can take anything you want to for a\nfew days. I said to Paul, \u201cI'm going to take toilet water and perfume.\u201d He said, \u201cbetter take\na sweater.\u201d I said, \u201cT'll take a sweater. I'll take my best sweater. I'll take my best pants. I'll\ntake my toilet water and perfume.\u201d I was smoking at the time too. I started only smoking\nwhen there were no cigarettes, but that's what I remember. Now when you ask me what I\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\ndid for Bergen-Belsen --",
        "Q:Why did you think of taking perfume. What were you thinking about?",
        "A:Preservation of my -- why did, in Bergen-Belsen, did the French women fight more for the\nlipstick than for their -- I don't know. This is...It was the worst thing the people could do to\nyou and I remember that in one of the camps where the women had long hair and they took\naway the comb which would hold up -- at that time everything was walled, remember, and\nthey took it away. They took the bras away and they took the combs away because they\nknew that the women would suffer from that. Leave it to women. So anyway, I don't know\nwhy I took my lipstick. I don't know why I took perfume, but it was something that would\nremind me of the civilized world. Let me give you another example. When I had a test in\nEnglish at NYU Professor Edel the James scholar, gave us a question, \u201cWhat would you\ntake if you were on an uninhabited island and if you know you would never come back,\nwhich book?\u201d Most people had either the Bible or Hamlet or whatever. What did I have?\nMadame Bovary. So, Edel said , \u201cwhy?\u201d I said, \u201cThe food, the clothes, the ambiance, the\ndiscussions, the love, the whole thing. It's all so bourgeois and that I would miss. So, why\ndoes anybody take whatever it is that's very personal? Reaching back in order to stay on a\ncertain level. I don't think today I would take the toilet water, but I don't know. I think I\nwould take a thermometer.",

        "Q:That was on purpose?",
        "A:I had this feeling that being a writer you had to be very careful of whom you write and what you\nwrite about.

Your dissertation is much too\nscholarly and who cares. These are other people in the concentration camp,\u201d and so on and I\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\ngot a terrible critique. That is what made me totally desist from anything and that happened\nlong before the German guy found my diary in Germany. That was between '65 and, I\nwould say, '82.

Not in one barrack, but let's say Paul was in the male barrack and I was in\nthe female barrack but at least the families could see each other.

And when\nyou come into the camp there are these barracks which are dark, between dark green and\nbrown and nothing but sand and mud and it started raining of course. It always rains. The\nfirst impression was freedom is trees and a camp is mud and a barrack. And of course\nguards and dogs. That's the first impression. That was very different from Westerbork.\nAn interesting thing, they put me in 1985 on the so called train Rampe\u2019\u00ae, you know, the platform\nand filmed there and asked me, \u201cWhat do you remember of this?\u201d And there were\nCanadians from the NATO at that time and we were eating ice cream and I said I don't\nremember eating ice cream at the entrance where the trains came in.

But this feeling of it doesn't make any sense. Here I am in '43 I'm 23 years\nold at that point, and I'm only beginning to live and I'm somehow cut off from anything\nwhich I had hoped for and envisioned.

The only\nchoices I have at that point in Bergen-Belsen 1s to roll with the punches and try to come out.\nI didn't know how bad it would get but the whole thing doesn't make any sense. It's\nsenseless and futile. And we're wasting precious time, and I was brought up with a very\npuritanical idea of you don't waste time. I think this goes through my whole life, always\nhaving a bad conscience if I just do what they call in Dutch \u201cniksen\u201d.\u2019\u201d\n\u2019? niksen: Dutch jargon for doing nothing.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nYou don't do anything. You're niks. And here I was sitting in Bergen-Belsen. Why? What for?\nHow long? What's time? You will find this in all the diaries. You'll find the feeling of the\nsense of time. The urgency of time.",
        "Q:And that you're losing it?",
        "A:And losing it and losing it and losing it. And the fear of losing it.",
        "Q:Is it boring in a certain way because it's circular, it's the same thing every day in some respects?",
        "A: Interesting. First association when you say is boring, I said how can anything be boring which 1s\nso different from what you're used to? That's already almost a travel expansion. It is so\ndifferent that it isn't boring, but then if 1t remains the same with the appell and the wake up\ncalls and the harassment and the lack of this and the lack of that, it's up to you what you\nmake out of it whether it remains the same, or whether you found ways to, to change it. I\ndon't know. I don't think it's boring in the sense when we watch something on T.V.. and we\nsay it's boring, 1t means we know it already. There's nothing to learn. There's nothing\nexciting about it so why put it on T.V. or in a paper or you read a story and you Say it's\nboring. I know it already. Here I don't think it was ever boring, because you never knew\nwhat would happen from one minute to the next.",
        "Q:Was it then tedious?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A:Yes. The absence of color, the tedium of always the same. Tedious yes, but not boring. That's\nquite a difference. The absence of what you were used to or what you wanted, I want to say\nis painful, it's not true because if it's tedious it's not painful, it's just a drag. It's terribly\ndepressing and depressing means that you're being pushed down and under and in order to\ncome out from down under and to be on top you have to find ways and means either\norganizing stuff or writing about it or doing something connected with the past, living in\nimagination but you have to come out of it.",
        "Q:Were you in some sense more imaginative than Paul in this situation? You kept coming out and\nfinding ways --.",
        "A:Women are always more imaginative. No, No, I\u2019m serious. Was I? No. Paul is a different\nperson. Paul is not a recorder, an evaluator, an analytical person. In many ways, Paul said\noften to me he had the best time he ever had in camp because it was less depressing than\ncompeting with the outside. That is the real depressive. I missed the competition. I missed\nthe excitement of having to make it. He was happy because, he said, \u201cThe worst thing they\ncan do to me is beat me,\u201d and he once said to me, \u201cWhen they beat me at least I was warm\ninstead of freezing.\u201d So, he had a different approach, and this is why I want you to meet\nsomebody like Paul. You will hear the other side. No. I don't know. It's very interesting\nwhen you say the differences. He was also a better person because he cared more about\nwhat people felt and how they suffered. I pushed that all away. I didn't want to -- if I report\nabout it I don't feel it. So, you see this is where later on you are actually a monster. Because\nhe said, \u201cYou distantiate yourself from not being upset.\u201d Upset is not the word, but feeling\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\naghast and feeling guilty by documenting it and using the writing like people very often use\nphotography, you know, as a kind of a -- the instrument is between their own feeling and\nwhat they put on paper in a photograph or in writing.\nI was also so much left out in that diary. This is what the publisher said. It 1s not personal. Because\nthen I would have whined and complained and I'm not a whiner and a complainer. For that\nI'm too proud because then I get hit again if you whine. I say somewhere in the diary, I say I\nthink around the 15th of June, I said, \"There's another one who keeps talking about the\nconcentration camp. There's another whiner, another one who keeps telling us how awful it\nwas. Who wants to hear about it.\" I already felt that while I was in it so I wasn't about to\nwhine. Not even to myself.",
        "Q:Now at another point in the diary you say noone talked about homesickness but inside I hurt.",
        "A:Of course. I do. Of course, of course, you're homesick. I mean, I keep saying that I can smell the\nleather couch or can see this or that or this enormous desire for flowers, for beauty for air\nfor sea, for cleanliness, for all the things we take for granted. I tell you yesterday I arrive at\nthe Mayflower and the first thing I did is ask the guy who helped me open the window a\nlittle bit or whatever I said, \u201cCan I drink the water?\u201d He said, I don't drink it.\u201d I said,\n\u201cJesus,\u201d to myself, \u201cam I in Leningrad, St. Petersburg or am I in Washington DC?\u201d So, I\ncalled the front desk and I said, \u201cCan I drink the water?\u201d He said, \u201cI drink it.\u201d\u201d These are the\nthings we take so for granted that we have everything. We have food, we have water, we\nhave this. We have cleanliness. We don't have lice. We don't die of this or that of dysentery\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nor whatever and that is exciting.",
        "Q:You're always looking for a quiet place?",
        "A:Yeah.",
        "Q:You love sitting outside at Bergen-Belsen, right? Maybe you'll get a moment when you're not\nsmelling the stench or you\u2019re not hearing the noise?",
        "A:l've always liked quiet places. That's right, because how can you concentrate when there is\nbedlam all around you. And especially that early time in Bergen-Belsen, it was just being\nwith other people, just an inconvenience but it doesn't become a torture until 1t becomes so\nbad that you don't know how to defend yourself against one more exertion because you're so\nweak. I don't know. I don't know how I survived. I only know that I couldn't do it again.\nAnd that's now true either because when I got into situations later in life, and in the last four\nyears, people said, \u201cI don't know how you can do this.\u201d Get up and walk to chemotherapy\nand walk back to chemotherapy and these winters that we've had '93 and '94 and '95 and so\non, and not taking morphine and whatever, I just can't do it any other way because I'm still\nthe surviving rat.\nSo, 1t becomes kind of a bad habit. No, I'm very serious about this because it also implies that you\nhave practically, as the French say \u201c\u00e9gards,\u201d no regard, no consideration at all for anybody\nelse. When I got the cancer diagnosis and the operation at Sloan Kettering, it was Christmas\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nand my sister wanted to come and my other family wanted to come, I said, \u201cNobody comes\nuntil I am ready to see you guys.\u201d This goes back to the concentration camp. I cannot share\nmisery. I have to be alone. It has to be quiet and especially the sicker I am and the more in\npain Iam the more alone I want to be. Just like a dog.",
        "Q:But you can't be alone in Bergen-Belsen.",
        "A:You can never be alone, but on the other hand you can retire into yourself.",
        "Q:Is that why you don't talk about other people? Almost no one else is mentioned in the diary. You\nmention some people, but you don't mention people close to you in Bergen-Belsen except\nPaul. Is that because there isn't anybody or is that because you don't want somehow to speak\nabout them?",
        "A:I don't want to talk at all. I don't want to get involved. I have enough to survive myself with out\ngetting all their life stories meshed into mine. Of course I listened. Of course I knew people,\nbut I don't remember the facts of anybody. I have repressed it so much that people very\noften asked me, \u201cDid you meet such and such. But you were together in one barrack.\u201d And\nI said, \u201cI have not the vaguest idea of who she or he is.\u201d Paul has asked me questions when\nI met him. He said, \u201cDon't you remember this?\u201d I said, \u201cI have not the vaguest idea of what\nyou're talking about. You can give me the third degree. You can torture me. I have nothing\nto give.\u201d He said, \u201cWhere is it?\u201d I said, \u2019I don't know. Gone.\u201d",

        "Q:Record it?",
        "A:Didn\u2019t record it, didn't want to get involved in the sense of...You see I almost rarely talk in the\ndiary about what I really feel. There\u2019s very little hope in the diary. From are we ever going\nto get liberated. You know, you find this because I don't remember anymore whether I\nbelieve, really believed that we ever would get liberated. I don't think I did.",
        "Q:Especially towards the end you say --",
        "A:I think this is again...This 1s a very simple physiological explanation. I still have it today. I have\nto get something to eat. I don't care what it is, but I get these attacks of...If I get hungry I go\nwild. Standing in line in a cafeteria I always have something with me, candy, you saw I ate\none or two bites of the dessert because I needed it. I needed the sugar. I have no\nhypoglycemia. I've been going into that, but I need somewhere not to have to want and not\nget it. Then I go crazy.",
        "Q:Can you talk about food in Bergen-Belsen, because in the diary you talk about spinach. You talk\nabout spaghetti--",
        "A:Everybody else talked recipes all the time.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "Q:Did you?",
        "A:No. I wasn't a recipe person. No, I didn't. But I'm just thinking back one of the diaries says I read\ncook books like I used to read pornography and I must tell you, this is very nice. I don't\nremember whether I talked recipe. I'm sure that I talked, yes, also about white bread and\nchocolate and things we got especially as children. You always go back to your childhood.\nI'm sure that I dreamt about chocolate, and I taught myself not to like chocolate because it's\nbad for you. So.",
        "Q:What was the food like? You had trouble with turnips?",
        "A:I had trouble with the turnips because the turnips go into your gall bladder. Turnips are bad. Food\nwas...Food was food. If you had it, you ate it. There were some people who were really\nheroic. I remember there was a rabbi who wouldn't eat a piece of meat because he wasn't\nsure that it wasn't pork and he was dying of hunger. That is principle. I admire that, and I\nwas angry at the same time. I said, \u201cThen give it to Paul or give it to me.\u201d",
        "Q:Did you tell him that?",
        "A:Yes. He didn't give it. I think he didn't give it. He must have said something, \u201cIf you're a good\nJew you don't eat it,\u201d and I must have said, I'm not a good Jew, I want the pork.\u201d I don't\nknow but there were altercations about this. Paul knows these things. He told me when I\nmet him he said, \u201cDo you remember the guy who didn't want to eat his meat?\u2019 I said,\n\u201cVes.\u201d\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",

        "A:That I remember.",
        "Q:Do you remember working in the kitchen?",
        "A:Oh, yes, yes. That I even remember the smell. I remember this enormous big vats with something\nboiling hot. It was either soup or some thing with a vegetable in it and always seeing\nwhether there was any meat or a piece in it which you could eat like a potato or a piece of\nmeat or a whole carrot and working in the kitchen meant getting up before day and dawn at\nthree a.m. and being there until four in the afternoon or five in the afternoon and then taking\nsomething home, back to the barrack, and it wasn't always as dramatic as with the pork or\nthe hair or whatever, but I gained weight and I could give Paul things and that was\nimportant.",
        "Q:But it was difficult for you to work there. You worked there for about three weeks?",
        "A:So difficult that I had to give it up because I didn't get any sleep because I was too excited and\ntoo, you know, hepped up about getting to the kitchen and the whole tension of whether I'd\nbe able to take food out. I think I got very scared after that episode. If I remember it right, it\nwas too tiring and I told myself it isn't worth it. It's going to kill me, so I gave it up.",
        "Q:Now, I would imagine people might be surprised that you decide to switch jobs?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A:I didn't switch jobs. I just gave it up. I didn't switch jobs. I didn't go to an unemployment office\nand I didn't put a resume in and say, \u201cI can do this.\u201d No, but there were some other things\nthat I could do and I don't know what it is but this was July 1944. It depended on the\ncircumstances. In 1944 in September the barracks got more crowded, because people were\nbeing pushed with the Russian advance and Auschwitz being emptied, beginning to be\nemptied, and Birkenau and all these people came west and there was less work and less\nfood and finally we didn't do anything anymore. We vegetated.",
        "Q:But in the beginning you worked in the shoe command --",
        "A:I worked in the shoes. I worked administratively. I worked--I did all kinds of things.",
        "Q:What did you do administratively?",
        "A:There were always people who needed things written or they needed things explained, especially\ntranslations and I also worked in very often in a kind of a semi medical situation. I had a\nRed Cross diploma so I knew how to do a bandage. I knew something, and so I worked in\nthe hospital. I always worked in hospitals. Hospitals had more food so it wasn't because of\nthe sick you came here, the hospital was not because of the sick. I wanted to work there\nbecause maybe there was a scrap of food more. Always a motive.",
        "Q:You were very calculating.",
        "A:A bitch, a real bitch in the sense of-- if I wanted something I got it and I remember exchanging\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nthings for cigarettes because cigarettes were more important than the food because a\ncigarette was a moment of -- I don't know if you've ever been a smoker. I gave it up. I gave\nit up before Dachau in 1954\u00b0\u00b0 because I had to and then I started again in '70, smoked \u2018til\nabout '71 and then my husband died, and then I smoked very little but I gave it up the day\nbefore the cancer operation. They wouldn\u2019t have operated on me if I smoked. Forget it, and\nthey're night. But anyway, calculated in the sense that, yes, if I do this will I have a better\nchance. If I don't do this what's going to happen. Using common sense, if that's calculating.",
        "Q:Did you meet women who were coming in from Auschwitz Birkenau?",
        "A:I didn't meet them but I talked to them. I talked through the wire to them and I heard the first time\nabout the gassing from these people.",
        "Q:When was that, in August or September?",
        "A:No, that is a little later. That 1s the end of September 1944. The weather is beginning to get very\nbad. We couldn't stand it there, wire between us anymore because it was either pouring rain\nor too cold, or we were too sick and they were in tents. They came and they didn't have\nbarracks for them anymore and they started putting tents up.\n\u00b0\u00b0R.L: \u201cI gave it up in 1954 because I had to and then I started again in \u201870 during a visit to\nDachau KZ monument, while I was working in Munich on my dissertation. I smoked until about\n\u201871. then my husband died; and I smoked very little, but I gave it up the day before the cancer\noperation (in 1992).\u201d\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nWe called them the Zeltfrauen \u201ctent women\u201d and they were the ones who told us that there was gas\nand that people were killed and we didn't believe it.",
        "Q:You didn't believe it?",
        "A:We didn't believe it. We didn\u2019t believe it.",
        "Q:Did you think they were crazy?",
        "A:We thought they were crazy. They were so hungry, they were so underfed, they were so tired\nfrom marching all the way from wherever they came from Poland. We didn't believe them.\nPeople wouldn\u2019t do that, we said, even then.",
        "Q:So you weren't hearing with all the Jewish press agency, the rumor mill, you weren't hearing\nthat?",
        "A:We didn't hear anything officially, the Jewish press agency never had it right. We didn't hear\nanything about the invasion. We didn't hear anything about D-day. I mean there were rumor\nmills but the business and I can tell you that people who knew heard about it in Holland\nfrom people who returned from concentration camps didn't believe it. They simply said, \u201cIt's\nnot true.\u201d Like some people today say they don't believe it but that's different.",
        "Q:Do you remember that the camp changed when Joseph Kramer came and became Commandant\nor is that not a significant moment?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A:I forget who the guy was before him. There was Kramer and there was another one. I remember\nIrma Grese.",
        "Q:You do?",
        "A:Yah. The famous ward who was cruel and kind and nice to children, but I remember what she\nlooked like. She was a hefty blonde and I remember her stiefel, her boots and the whip and\nI'm not sure whether she was on our appell, we had to be counted, or whether it was in the\nnext camp, or whether she only came in on a Sunday, but I definitely saw her and knew who\nshe was. Now, Kramer -- oh God I don't think this is in the diary. I told this story to Peter\nWiebke*' when we were, in '86, making the movie and doing something. I said, \u201cI didn't\nonly work in the kitchen I also worked in the private quarters of the SS.\u201d Because that was\nnext to the kitchen as a cleaning person and I remember that I took the toothbrush and put\nthe toothbrush into the toilet. This was my private revenge. He would never know but I\nknew that he would brush his teeth in the shit. So you see these are the things and then Peter\nsaid, \u201cHow come it's not in the diary.\u201d I said, \u201cAre you crazy? If they would find that, that\nwas censorship.\u201d He said, \u201cHow come you only remember this now?\u201d I said, \u201cI don't know\nwhy something...,\u201d1t had something to do with kitchens. We were eating in kitchens of the\nNATO. You know, this was the army time in Germany. And we had a Dutch meal in a\nDutch kitchen and somehow the kitchen brought back memories of Bergen-Belsen and here\nI was discussing diaries and there comes the toothbrush situation and my wiping the wash\n*! Peter Wiebke: Renata\u2019s German translator.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nbasin of the SS with a dirty rag and ending up with the tooth brush into the toilet. This is\nmagnificent.

        "A:No, not ever personally, not in any way. Not hit, not...No.",
        "Q:Paul was beaten?",
        "A:Paul was very badly beaten and beaten because he was tall so he stood out and the guys were\ncold. They wanted to beat themselves warm as they were pulling out trees and stumps in\nthe winter. He was badly beaten. He wasn't tortured but he also was put at the entrance as a\npunishment and made to stand for hours and no food and that is the time when I ate his\nration. When I knew that he was standing there and practically fainting from exhaustion and\nhunger, and I ate his bread. They had given us two rations, one for him and one for me, and\nI ate it.",
        "Q:Still bothers you?",
        "A:Oh, God it bothers me. It didn\u2019t bother Paul because he said very often, he said, \u201cI got something\nthe next day and after all without you I wouldn't be around.\u201d I said. \u201cI know but I still ate\nit.\u2019 You don't eat stuff of a dying person. But then I'm so confused now because I\nremember my doing all my research and finding diaries and there's a guy I think in\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nwherever, Dachau, Neuengamme, who says, how come his porridge, or whatever they had,\nhis soup is still here. He must have died so he goes out of there. So, that feeling of if there is\nstill something left, I can eat it. And there are these unforgettable pictures of people\ngnawing on bones just to get something. Maybe there 1s something left somewhere which I\ncan eat. The stuff we ate is so unbelievable.",
        "Q:You describe maggots in the soup?",
        "A:I describe maggots but particularly in the train situation I described what we eat. We eat anything\nbecause we were starving.",
        "Q:Were people being cannibals, are you describing people eating human remains?",
        "A:No, not humans, but they ate around where there were human remains. They...I don't know of\nany cannibalism but I know that I'm sure of it. If you have nothing to eat -- I know of the\nurine drinking because they had no water. O.K. That we know. We all know that. We don't\nhave to talk about that. I didn\u2019t though. I ate anything.

        "A:Oh, the Kapos. I'm talking about the guys who had food. I don't think they were raping. I think\nthe people there they found were willing. There wasn't much rape. The Russians raped.

        "Q:So, this was a way for the women to get food?",
        "A:Yeh, right. This is the way I avoided, already, during the camp because I told myself I would\nhave to give the stuff to Paul. He would know. It wouldn't be our thing. I remember that.\nAnd a...That it wouldn't end with one. It would go on and on and on and on.",
        "Q:But you're also very non-judgmental?",

You wouldn't\nget sick. What the hell. But I didn't feel like it because it wasn't my choice. I think this is\nmore significant than anything else. I would really feel like a victim if I have to prostitute\nmyself for this. This is something, there comes a point when you just say to yourself short of\ntorture, I'll do anything. There came a point when I told myself no. I remember walking with\nthese guys behind the barracks and they gave me a cigarette and they said, \u201cLet's do it,\u201d and\nI said, \u201cNo way.\u201d They said but you can have this or that and I said, \"Sorry.\" I usually got\nsomething any way.

How was it for children and I said, \u201cI don't know.\u201d I'm\ndelighted that I didn't have a child in the camp because it's bad enough to have a husband.\nIt's bad enough to have a parent, but to have a child.

        "Q:When there was a family there, so that there was a husband and a wife and a child or more than\none child, was the woman having more responsibilities than the man usually?",
        "A:Yes, because the man was in a different barrack and the woman was with the child. The woman--\nLet's say the boys until they were a certain age, I don't remember the exact age, but I guess it\nwas the women who had the children with them and the men were in a different barrack and\nthe men came to visit or to do things or whatever. So, anyway, yes, because I don't think\nthere were men with sons only, maybe but not little ones, and there were tiny ones. They\nwere definitely in the so called \u201cfemale barrack.\u201d But again I'm talking more sense than\nmemory because I don't remember. I should. There are so many things I should have written\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nabout but who the hell knew.",
        "Q:How did you save Paul?",
        "A:Very simple. Being very nasty and still feeding him. How did I save him. We were 1n the train. In\nthe camp I couldn't save him. That was beyond. I mean I saved him, but I didn't save his life\nin the camp. I saved Paul's life really in the train. Because in the train he was dying.",
        "Q:The train 1s --",
        "A:The train is between Bergen-Belsen and near Leipzig where we get liberated, and those ten days I\nthink I remember everything. The other thing with Paul was that when we left Bergen-\nBelsen, when we were pushed out of the camp on whatever day it was, the ninth of April,\nwhatever, he wasn't with me. He couldn't walk fast enough. He was trailing behind so I lost\nhim. I told myself, I must have thought, \u201cGood riddance,\u201d and at the same time, \u201cGod now\nwhat.\u201d When we got to the train, I got somehow in the train. I was with the psychiatrist and\nhis son. The son's a psychiatrist who, I'll give you the address now, who survived, and I\nsaid, \"Where's Paul.\u201d He said, \u201cPaul is over there. Try to get him into the train\nsomewhere.\u201d So Paul got into a carriage, three or four carriages behind mine. And\nsomehow I used every connection, every possibility I had to get him into my carriage. And\nin my carriage he was lying on the floor near the door and near the toilet and I was still\nsitting and he was lying there and he couldn't move. He couldn't cough. He couldn't\nswallow. He was dying. And I told myself, \u201cYou better do something.\u201d\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAnd I began to do things. I began to find water. I began to find whatever I could find outside the\ncarriage, a raw potato, this or that. Once we got bread and so on. And I began to organize\nwith that psychiatrist\u2019s son, Louis M. Tas. We went and we went into the fields and you\nread the story about when we go into the mine fields and we try to get beets and carrots and\npotatoes and whatever and we go into German houses and we bring food back and I spoon\nfed Paul back into life. Then we get into the Russian liberation camp, the hospital and then I\nget typhus. And just...Just in that time Paul begins to sit up and he begins to spoon feed me\nsugar, tea because I have had this incredible high fever and encephalitis. I had these\ntremendous headaches and he feeds me and I have fed him and this becomes a relationship\nwhich has to stop because we basically hate each other. We hate each other. We have\nsurvived something we didn't want. He is at that time -- I'm 24 and he's going on 29 and I\nwant so many different things from him. He wants to get back to his \"speech therapy\" and\nmaybe finally get into medical school if he can ever get a diploma. I want to go and have\nfood and fun and Paris...., Paris for becoming a fashion designer. It never occurred to me to\ndo anything else. I had doodled in Bergen-Belsen. The doodles are in the diary by the way\nand they\u2019re in an exposition in Bergen-Belsen. But anyway, we are growing apart like this\nbecause we are totally different. He gets depressed again. I get--I have to get my morals\nagain. We grow apart and we try to stay together by having a family. So, I have one\nmiscarriage after another. Finally we have a child. The child is eight and half months\npregnant and it chokes itself inside my belly. It's born dead. That's the end of the marriage.\nThat is 1947 in the fall. He has his girlfriend and I have my boyfriends and we finally decide\nin '50 when Deso has arrived in '50, he said, \u201cThat's the man you should have married.\u201d\n\u00b03 RL: \u201cThe child is eight and a half months into my pregnancy.\u201d\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAnd we remained friends. The interesting thing is he always...he didn't want children. He\nsaid, \u201cI don't want children in this depressing world. What the hell. Maybe we adopt, maybe\nwe should have somebody else's child, an orphan from the war or whatever.\u201d I said, \u201cNo, if\nwe have a child, it's our child.\u201d He said, \u201cI don't want any children.\u201d He marries the second\ntime. He has four children.",
        "Q:Do you know his children?",
        "A:Not only do I know his children, I know his wife. I became very good friends with her. She was a\nyoung Dutch, half nobility, half whatever, totally Dutch. And she was the one whom I asked\nbefore I went to America in 1952 I said Helene you have been living with Paul...And we\ndivorced in '50, and in '52 I finally immigrated to Canada. I couldn't go to America because\nI was born in Germany and the German quota was full and I couldn't get out. So, I went to\nCanada on my Dutch passport. I went to Helene, and I said, \u201cWhy don't you marry Paul\nfinally. I am leaving.\u201d She said, \u201cI won't marry a Jew.\u201d I said, \u201cYou won't what?\u201d I said,\n\u201cYou've been living with the guy. He has been baptized. Already his father is this.\u201d She\nsaid, \u201cI won't marry him because my family wouldn't stand for it.\u201d I said, \u201cScrew you. I\ncan't do that. You can't live with a guy and fall in love with him and not marry him.\u201d She\nmarried him and she had four children with him. Finally she got breast cancer. She died. But\nthey were divorced already. He found a friend in Germany where he had moved because he\ncould easier find work in Germany in his field than in Holland. A long story, nothing to do\nwith me. And the interesting thing is that Paul always said, \u201cOne of the best things which\never happened to me is not that you saved my life but that we met and it was wonderful.\u201d\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nThat's nice. That is nice. \u201cYou saved my life, of course it's wonderful.\u201d But he is so\ndepressed that he sometimes feels, \u201cWhat's life?\u201d I don't know. Last question, what do you\nwant to know besides this? You must be dead tired. These are all stories of other people\nand how they relate, this is not necessarily a Holocaust story because it has nothing to do\nwith the horror of Auschwitz and Birkenau. If you're being shoved into the gas, it's much,\nmuch worse I think than being starved and diseased. I don't know. I think because this is the\nfinal victimization because even if you are dying of hunger, even though you're dying of\ndisease, you still have a certain control. If you're being pushed into a shower and it turns out\nto poison you...This is my fear of the anesthesia also. Anything which is done to me where I\ncan't be in control.",
        "Q:You don't feel like a victim, do you?",
        "A:No, that\u2019s why I also feel so guilty and that maybe also the reason why I feel almost frivolous.\nThe fact that I talk about and wear lipstick, the fact that Iam \"not looking my age\" is not an\neffort. It's just I'm a survivor. By the way, why do you look so good at age 57. That is a\nmatter of skin and haircut and also personality. I love your haircut. I hope it doesn\u2019t cost\n300 dollars, because mine cost 15.",
        "Q:What do you think that is about that you -- I understand that Bergen-Belsen is not Auschwitz\nBirkenau, but in reading your diary it's clear how difficult 1t was and one did not know\nwhether it was going to end?\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org",
        "A:Unbelievably difficult but not final.",
        "Q:But you didn't know that.",

        "Q:But you had a lot of death in Bergen-Belsen?",
        "A:Death?",
        "Q:Death.",
        "A:By the loaves. An unbelievable amount of dying percentage wise because people were dying of\ndisease and starvation, but that's a different death than by being pushed into -- I don't know.\nTo me it's much more horrible. Because it's so phony, it's so typical German. You tell them\nthey're going to have a shower. You tell them, \u201cYou're going to be disinfected.\u201d You're\nbeing killed. In Bergen-Belsen they didn't tell you that we're not going to kill you. They said\nwe don't give a shit whether you die.

It wasn't a fake. They weren't faking the people like I later\nget in the diaries where they make people up so that they have -- the women make\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nthemselves up so that they have rosy cheeks or rosy lips so they will not go to the left or to\nthe right. I mean I'm talking about something which 1s a totally different situation. It's\nalmost silken zores. As my Jewish husband said, my second one. He said, \u201cseidene zores.\u201d~*\nIf you compare this to going into poison gas.",
        "Q:It's interesting. Not everybody has that kind of perspective. You obviously have a perspective of\nbeing able to compare, and to...Do you know what I mean?",
        "A:This is what they call the impersonal...1mpersonal situation in my diary. To me this is that I kept\nthe perspective. And the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung writes about this, and he said, the\namazing thing is also the second book that I could write a dissertation about this crap. He\nsaid that, \u201cShe has the emotional distance to be able to objectify the horrible experience.\u201d\nTo me it is nothing else than survivorism. It's a mechanism.",
        "Q:Is it from your father's scientific perspective that you can some way think you don't have --?",

        "Q:Is there anything you'd like to say about your experiences that you don't think you've said?",

The mere fact that I\ncan say today is July 1969 on June 15,\"\u201d\u00b0 on Thursday, June 15, 1944 I am thinking a lot\n** seidene zores: silken worries\n\u00b0\u00b0R.L: This was a misspeaking. Renata meant to say here: \u201cJuly 16, 1996 and I am reading here\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nabout after the war. Will we ever be able to convey what these camp years have meant for\nus when we talk with someone who has not actually lived through a similar experience\nhimself. What it is like to see from behind barbed wire, tall, green fir trees and new\nvegetable crops growing along the camp road, what the constant pressure and coercion by\nSS guards and their perennial check ups really mean. How you try all the time to convince\nyourself that it does not touch you. All this shouting, cursing and kicking that you notice\nthat you're growing older and that you're used to slipping through your fingers in these long\nyears of waiting for the end of oppression. What the months mean when you count them in\nhours, days and weeks. And in which the only bright spots are sleep, warm soup, and\nsometimes a ray of sun on the way back to the barracks after another endless roll call in the\ndamp chill of the big center Appell fields. Good moments also, the thoughts and dreams\nabout before. Homesick and more homesick and whether it's the Frenchwomen who sing\nabout \u201cParee, Paree,\u201d or the Italians in their brightly patched Mediterranean get ups or the\nGreek, Spanish Jews from Salonika. They all think of and yearn for only one single thing:\nhome, going home after the war. And what is home? Will we be able to find our way back\nfrom the concentration camp universe into a world in which most of us have no longer any\nother possessions than the memories of before the war and in which we will live among\npeople to whom our years of imprisonment will only mean --\"Oh, there's another one of\nthose who only complain about lost things and tell horror stories.\" This is true. Now, if you\nput this while you're there how much have you written yourself out of the situation. I\nclimbed above it, out of it and was neither in the past or in the future but I was me. They\ncouldn't take it away and I think this is not only me, this is where I feel this camp diaries are\ncrucial to show what human beings could do with their brain.

        "A:I was born Renate Laqueur and I was born on November 3, 1919, in Brieg, Germany. Today that\npart of Germany is Poland, because it\u2019s Silesia and it\u2019s near Breslau. I was shipped from\nGermany three weeks old to Holland because my father emigrated to Holland in 1919. So,\nthis is why I'm more Dutch than German.",
        "A:My early childhood, let\u2019s say, was of course in Holland. I grew up in Holland, went to school in\nHolland. My father and mother were both German and had their parents still in Germany.\nWe used to visit my grandmother in the summers because my grandmother's home in Brieg\nwas a jewel of a house. It was a big house with a beautiful garden and a tennis court and a\nswimming pool and in...in the twenties my mother's father was a...what do you call it? He\nwas making paper stuff, let\u2019s say, like folders and writing. There's a word for it, I forget\nwhat it is.\nAnyway, he made his money in this factory, or firm, in Brieg and she had the money.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMy father was an intellectual. He had studied medicine and was mainly interested at that point in\nmedicine and pharmacology. He never practiced medicine but was a Pharmacologist\nEndocrinologist and the interesting thing about this is that in the early twenties he starts in\nHolland to work for slaughter houses because he wants the hormonal products of horses and\ncows because they begin the first hormone preparation in his laboratory in Amsterdam. He\nwas first in Amsterdam and ended up as the Dean of the University in Amsterdam in the\nthirties and forties. Anyway, he... In his laboratory they discovered testosterone. So, he is\none of the first hormone researchers and I grew up when you asked me about childhood,\nthat my father would put Ponds Cold Cream on one cheek and another hormone cream on\nthe other cheek to see which one worked better. I think it was the Ponds. O.K. Early\nchildhood, what more do you want to know?",
        "A:Let me just quickly tell you about my mother because my mother was the artist in the family. She\nsang. She painted. She was a terrific painter and terrific singer also a good looking woman.\nTitian kind of reddish hair and lousy taste in everything except in art and music.",
        "A:Lousy taste because she wouldn't throw out a thing and she would buy crap because she was\nstingy. So, we didn't grow up in a house full of beautiful objects. We grew up with whatever\nwas available. Never had a decent new bought dress in my youth because that's the way they\nwere brought up. You get hand me downs. We were five children. There was an older sister\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nand older brother. Me and my younger sister, so five. I think one of the reasons why I got\nvery orderly and very much into beautiful things, whatever, was a reaction to this kind of\nwild household.\nBut intellectually I think I owe both my parents the interest in literature, art, medicine, anything.\nAnything except politics. Politics did not play a role. Religion was a very strange situation\nbecause my father and mother were both Jewish racially,but had never, ever been in a\nsynagogue. Even in Germany, so my father was born 1880. My mother was born 1883. I've\npersonally never been in a synagogue except when I travel and if I'm in a group or if I'm in\nTurkey then the guide goes and shows me a synagogue.",
        "A:I was conscious of this background and made more conscious of it by a sheer fluke. The schools\nin Holland are not like here, private or public. Every school was public. You went to public\nkindergarten, public lower grade, middle school, whatever and then high school is\nGymnasium. To go into a university you had to go at that time into a certain school which\nprepared you for the university. If you went into a trade, there was another school. But if\nyou had...If you didn't want to go to university, I couldn't make it to the university school, I\nwas too stupid. I jumped from what they call a girl's school into the second class of the\nGymnasium. I wasn't all that stupid I was just in protest. What made me very interested in\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nreligion, I was 11 or 12 and I had to go, let's say, into the school where you either go to\nuniversity to stay in a trade school or you could get a girl's education. At that time it was just\nnothing. And, I was a biker. Like all Dutch kids, you were born on a bike and I biked and I\nwas careless. And they wanted to put me in a certain school which was right around the\nneighborhood because then I wouldn't bike so far and come home with a broken leg or\nwhatever. I got put into that school.\nIt was a so called Hervormd Lyceum which is not only Lutheran but it is the Reformed Lutheran\nchurch, so the most Calvinistic sect of the Lutheran church you can be in. That was my\nschool, because it was in the neighborhood. Then the school moved out of the neighborhood\nand I was in the school anyway, but there comes my religion. My religious background was\nSunday school, Christian. It was prayer every morning and so and so on. And it had some\nJewish children. I wonder whether they were there because it was the neighborhood. I think\nthey were there because it was a very good school. And so, this is where the Christian\nbackground comes from. The other thing, there is a habit in my family which is very\nGerman that came Christmas around, number one we had a tree. Number two the kids were\nsupposed to recite the Christmas story under the Christmas tree. The oldest kid first and by\nthe time it reached me and my sister, it must have been close to the middle 30s, Hitler was\nthere already because I was born in '19. So this was the Christian background. Jews were\nnever mentioned except after '33. '33 the first immigrants came from Germany fleeing Hitler\nand my father immediately got into committees, helped and was on refugees committees.\nWe had refugees all over the place, and we were aware of it, how lucky we were that we did\nnot grow up in Germany but in Holland. I had also problems in school because they knew\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nthat my parents were Germans and the Dutch kids hated Germans. They had nicknames for\nthem like in France the Bosches and we called them the Moffen.\nI was always the child of a moff father, which was a German father. The problem was that he was a\nprofessor, that he lectured at the University and that he was so ungifted with language that\nhe never learned decent Dutch so that the students finally said, \u201cProfessor Laqueur do us a\nfavor, talk in German because we can't understand you.\u201d So, he lectured in German, but\nwrote in German, English, whatever they wrote in at the time. I think they all still wrote in\nGerman. Nobody wrote in English, in medical text. Dutch, you didn't write because nobody\ncould read it, but they wrote German. They changed it. Science was German.",
        "A:Brothers and sisters. The oldest sister was a woman, was a girl and she died after Bergen-Belsen.\nNobody knows about this. I never mention her in the diary. She was over 40. She was born\nin 1906 so if the war was from 1943 to '45 she was over 40 or close to 40 and anybody who\ngot typhus died over 40 because of the high consistent fever for 15 to 16 days and whatever.\nShe lived outside of Holland for part of her married life. She was married to a doctor in\nCzechoslovakia and then came my second brother. My second brother, Peter, studied\nmedicine and biochemistry and also got into endocrinology. He immigrated to South\nAmerica just before 1940, in 1939 because there was a branch of the factory which made\nthe hormones, Organon, which was part of Hoffman La-Roche. So, there was a combination\nof pharmaceutical, endocrinology pharmacology on that side.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMy brother, Peter, was an M.D. and Ph.D. and in South America. He emigrated later on after the\nwar in 1946 to New York and switched to psychiatry because of the drugs. The third brother\nwas five years older than I. He did study medicine, but flunked out because he had the\nfeeling, you know, you studied medicine because your father and your brother studied\nmedicine. And he became a businessman, first photography and film in the 1930. Went to\nthe Berlin Olympiad to film. I just saw on PBS the other day and I realized that Hein my\nbrother was there for the Olympiad just to film. He was born in \u201814 so he was 22, 24. I\nguess. And the younger sister, Lilo, 1s the one who lives in Boston. She was born in 1922.\nWent to school in Amsterdam. All the other kids went to normal schools. They went to\npublic schools. Nobody went to this Lutheran Calvinistic outfit where I went. None of them\nwas as Christian as I was, because I saw it. I have to pray and I also tried to become a\nCatholic but that's a different story. I had a Catholic boyfriend, but never Jewish. So, Lilo\nmarried in Holland a German refugee who was in international insurance, marine insurance\nwith whom she immigrated in 1947 to New York and she lived in West Westchester and\nhad three children and is today retired in Boston. She's a registered nurse. Again, medicine,\nthere's always medicine somewhere. That's the kids.\nNow, my mother died in 1959 and my father died in 1967! in a very strange situation. He was with\n' Renata misspoke here; her father died in 1947 not 1967.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nhis girlfriend in Switzerland and he was somewhere in Zermatt near the very high\nmountains and the Swiss Post Auto, you know, one of those busses squeezed a woman who\nwas running against the wall and she died. And he, as a physician, was called in and while\nhe was administering help to this woman, he died of a heart attack. He had a bad heart, bad\nkidneys, bad heart, so this is the story of my father and there were write ups all over the\nNew York Times, all over Europe. Ernst Laqueur died while he was trying to help\nsomebody not to die. A question...",
        "A:That\u2019s an interesting question. First let me tell you about the food. The food was always too\nmuch and too heavy. Everybody was heavy. I learned. My people in New York told me I\nwant to be -- what do you want to be. I said, \u201cI want to be what I should be.\u201d She said,\n\u201cYou cut everything you eat in half.\u201d* I never went on a diet. I lost what I had to lose and\nstayed that way for the rest of my life. Father disciplined because children were brought up\nnot to talk unless they were asked questions. Children were there to be looked at, but not to\nbe heard. We were very well brought up. We also had nannies. We had a nanny, we had a\ncook, we had whatever and the nanny was, in many ways, more important than the mother.\nThe mother was there when you were sick and when you were in trouble with your father,\nshe would mediate.\n? RL: \u201cMy doctors asked me, \u2018What do you want to be.\u2019 I said, \u2018I want to be what I should be.\u2019\nMy doctor said...\u201d\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nMy mother was called, surprisingly, an avalanche which rolls up the mountain. She was that\nforceful. She ran the house in many ways and my father was the guy behind the desk,\nalways on the phone, always public relations. I learned public relations from him. Public\nrelations before the word existed. Team work, working with people was my father. My\nmother was an individualist and totally you do what you feel like as long as you don't run\ninto trouble with the law, and that's it.",
        "A:Was she what? Yes, very warm, but also very egocentric. If she was warm, you were warm., but\nif she was cold and she didn't understand you, she wanted you warm, and it wasn't that easy.\nThe sense of humor strangely enough was my father. He had a kind of a understated...he\ncouldn't have survived with that woman next to him if he wouldn't have had a kind of\ncertain distance and a kind of an ironization of his own position.",
        "A:No, and I think this has been one of the traumatic things. I never talked about that because to me\nit's so natural that I always knew he had girlfriends, but I also knew that the girl friends were\nnot sexual and this is something which I never understood. Girlfriends were achievements.\nThey were either just -- I hope this doesn't go anywhere because this is purely personal --\nthey were either very beautiful or very famous or both or they needed him because he could\nprovide whatever they wanted. It wasn\u2019t persecution. It was a very complex relationship\nbecause I think sexually he didn't function. I found that out by talking to one of them. I\nmean, I was the one who became very...and there was another thing. I had tremendous\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nproblems as a teenager and as a young woman because my father was afraid of\ntemperament. Afraid of passion, afraid of sexual involvement and he warned me, he said\nyou're dark. I was dark. Today I'm gray. You look like a gypsy and you look aggressive. I\ndidn't even know what he was talking about but I understood much later that this was his\nfear. He loved me and he said, \u201cYou will never need to do anything except get married.\u201d I\nthink I started at the ripe old age between 40 and 51 to prove that I could do other things but\nget married.\nBut when you ask me, \u201cDid they love each other?\u201d They may have been in love for a very short\ntime, but again to give you the 19th century, when he married my mother, who was, of\ncourse, a virgin when he married her in 1905, he said, \u201cIf you don't have a son or a daughter\nin a year, it's over.\u201d So, in other words, he wanted to propagate and I don't know -- I don't\nknow whether these stories are true but this is what I remember in my family and there are\nother things that I remember which are not showing love. You're so long together, you stick\nit out.",
        "A:I was very close to my middle brother who was five years older when he was very young and I\nbecame very much estranged from him in the last 20 years of his life because he was to my\nmind, too narrow minded. For instance, he never forgave me that I went back to Germany.\nHe never forgave me that I wrote the dissertation and that I kind of published our\nbackground in the sense of, from my grandparents already tried to escape. \u201cAnd now you\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\ndescribe this whole business again, what it was to be a German, now you get involved in the\nwhole Hitler aftermath.\u201d\nThat became very difficult because I thought, \u201cHow narrow minded can you be. You know damn\nwell it's not my problem.\u201d I am delighted that I survived and I had the guts to write a diary.\nThen somebody else picked it up and published it. I gave it to a publisher because it was\nthere in Holland, it was nothing. It was typed, but I never did anything with it. I have\nactually never done anything until now. This is the last time that I try to get this published in\nEnglish. I've had it. Let 1t sit somewhere.",
        "A:You better say what did I not like. What I didn't like was science and math and anything to do\nwith that which wasn't language. I loved geology, geography and all that stuff but no\nmathematics, no science. Even when I came to New York and I wanted to study I talked\nColumbia and NYU into giving me a year off so I got instead of 128 points I only had to do\nwhatever and I said no science. I'm never going to go anything with science. I regret it today\nbecause I ended up in medicine at the age of 60, but anyway. I liked going to school. I liked\nto learn and I like kids and I like to be with people. I have no problems. I had a very good\nchildhood. I was strong, tough and I loved to just play. No, beef at all. I had a wonderful\nchildhood. I knew I didn't get the stuff I wanted in clothes. I knew I didn't get ever a room\nwhich was filled with beautiful objects.

That\ndidn't occur until we got the Wehrmacht, the orders from the occupational army to fill in\nforms that you had Jewish grandparents and I remember my wild resentment to my father.\nI said, \u201cDon't be such a goddamn Prussian, don't fill in anything.\u201d Ifhe wouldn't have filled it in we\nwould have been all okay. Because--That's why I kept saying Prussian prejudice and\nPrussian education. There's another problem that also comes out in the book Schreiben KZ\nin the introduction, because my German editors insisted that I give my story about my father\nand he said, \"If you don't give it we have it in the Frankfurter Allegemeine Zeitung\nArchives.\" So I said, \u201cOkay, here it is\u2019. He is born in 1880. He is a German. He 1s a medical\nprofessional. He is a teacher at the universities, various universities. The war breaks out in\n1914. He is a German. He volunteers into the army as a medical officer. Imagine growing\nup in Holland and having a father who was a volunteer in the German army. Okay, number\none, he is then, because he is a Pharmacologist he is being sent to Belgium. In Belgium the\nhave a Gas Schule, a Gas School in Berlin where they experiment with poisonous gas for\nthe war. From '14 to '18 Laqueur is in the gas schule. He only does research. He has no idea\nwhat the research is for, but he does research as a Pharmacologist. He's being sent to\nBelgium as an occupation army, you know, from '14 to '18. He ends up with a death\nsentence in Belgium because they say, \u201cIf you ever come back we'll kill you.\u201d So, for the\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nrest of his life, when we were children, he travels to Switzerland where we have a chalet in\nthe summer. He travels on the Belgium French side, we travel in the third railroad car with\nmy mother on the German side\u201d. These are the things they knew in Germany and my friend\nand editor Martina in Frankfurt said, \u201cRenata, if you don't tell us these stories we have them\nanyway because the Germans knew about this.\u201d I think it's only funny, but of course I don't\nblame my father. If you were an American and if ...we have never been occupied in\nAmerica, but if the occupational-- yes we have been occupiers. We have occupied\nGermany. We have occupied whatever. So, if you then do something because your\ngovernment tells you to do this or that, do you or don't you? But there are other things\nwhich made me nervous about this interview because my own bad conscience comes in, I\nhated to be my father's daughter in Holland.\nI never forget the last talk I had with my father in 1947 before he went to Switzerland and he was a\nsick man, he had cardio and kidney problems and I said, \u201c\u201cWhy did you go into the army?\u201d\nWhy this or that and he simply had no other explanation but, \u201cThis is my duty.\u201d Again the\nPrussian. Duty, honor, --ugh.",
        "A:Then he gets like everybody else, a \"J\" on his identity thing. My mother gets a \"J,\" and his\nchildren unless they were married to non-Jews and then they started working around it. My\n> R.L: Here Renata is referring to the third class railroad car.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nmiddle brother is exempted because my mother said, \u201cI had another guy and he's the son of\nanother guy.\u201d And this gets all taken into paper and it's all very complicated and so he is\nout of the story. My sister isn't married so she still has a \"J\" and she lives with my parents,\nand I am married and I married a Jewish boy who was baptized, Paul. We wanted to\ndisappear, you know, go underground and my father said, \u201cDon't do this because if you do\nthis you endanger my staying and, let\u2019s say, being tolerated.\u201d Because the Germans,\nbecause of his relationship to the industry, to the pharmacological industry, they wanted\nshares so badly of his outside involvement in South America and in America and they tried\nto pressure him into giving them access to his money. He never did.",
        "A:They never succeeded but meanwhile they kept saying \"Laqueur, you can stay in your house.\nYou can do whatever you can do,\" but of course his job was gone because he had to be\nsacked as a professor because you couldn't stay in the university if you were Jewish.\nBut they left him until the end of the war. Of course there were stories about it that he sold his\nchildren to the concentration camp because he could stay home. Nonsense. It had nothing to\ndo with him. We were arrested because we were Jewish. We had a \"J\" and I had done some\nillegal stuff, and a...and stuff, documents. It's a very complicated story. Anyway I ended up\nin prison in Amsterdam and then a Dutch concentration camp which was worse than\nanything else. Then being shipped to Westerbork and then my father, with his good\nconnections in the Hague and with Berlin, got me out of Westerbork and I came back out.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nThen Paul and I said to my father, \u201cNow it's time that we go underground, because I don't\nwant to be shipped ever again to Westerbork.\u201d The transportations were going to the East.\nWe didn't know what happened there, but I didn't want to be shipped. He said, \u201cYou can't\ndo this. You just stay where you are. I will try to salvage whatever I can.\u201d He bought us\nEcuadorian passports. We got Venezuelan passports. We got immigration stuff to go to\nPalestine. We had everything, every paper in the world. Then we got picked up because\nwith the Germans there was always one word, Bis auf Wieteres, until further notice.\nSo, in other words, if you had an exemption that could explode from one hour to the next, and our\nso called Stempel, stamp had expired and we were shipped to a so called preference camp\nwhich was Bergen-Belsen. At that time it wasn't a concentration camp. It was for the\nchildren of notable people.",
        "A:I'm talking much too much.",
        "A:That also has to do with the war. I met Paul in May '40 when we were overrun by the Germans. I\nmeet him bicycling with a member of a family that I knew and I meet him and we fall in\nlove. It's May, June 1940. He's my first man and being well brought up you marry the first\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nman. We have a love affair and then I tell my father that I slept with him and he almost\nkilled me for that. I said, \u201cDon't worry, we'll get married.\u201d He said, \u201cYou shouldn't get\nmarried because you will get divorced right after.\u201d He was right, but he said, \u201cDo you want\nto marry?\u201d I said, \u201cYes, I want to marry because otherwise we can't live together.\u201d Because\nthere were certain orders from the Germans that you couldn't live in this city and in that city\nyou had to live together. They were making restrictions on where you lived and what you\ndid and so on. It was the ghetto mentality already. So, Paul and I got married and the two\nfathers, Father Goldschmidt, Paul Goldschmidt, his ancestry was German but he had been\nthree or four generations in Holland and Father Goldschmidt and Father Laqueur got\ntogether and said, \u201cThose kids are going to get divorced as soon as the war is over. What do\nwe do about our money?\u201d\nSo, they said that each kid whatever they brought into the marriage would go back into their own\nfamily, and boy did that happen. But this is really very personal. When Paul and I got\ndivorced in the 1950s, after I met my second husband -- this is a story I have to tell you, but\nit's purely personal. Anyway, to get to the money first, it got divided very nicely except that\nPaul said, \u201cI can never pay you for saving my life.\u201d I said, \u201cYou don't pay me. That\u2019s a\nnatural. I either saved your life or I let you rot.\u201d So, whatever it was we got very amicably\ndivorced. I gave him some share of my father\u2019s LaRoche Organon stuff and he gave me\nsome other stuff, but these are civilized marriages. \u00b0\n\u00b0 Renata Laqueur has added an addendum to her interview release form in regards to the words:\n\u201cLaRoche Organon.\u201d She does not permit these words to be used in any publication or production,\nincluding literary, print, audio, audio-visual, computer-based or any other medium now known or\nwhich may be created in the future.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nWe are still friends. The story of how I met Paul and how I met my second husband. Paul had been\na speech therapist. He had dyslexia and that way got into speech trouble and interested in\npsychology and psychiatry but he had never made the Gymnasium so he could never study\nmedicine. 1950, after the war, there were stories, there were children and also no children\nand all kinds of things. In 1950 the first international speech therapy congress convention 1s\nin Amsterdam and Paul says to me, \u201cDo you want to work for that? Do something because\nyou're good with people and good with money and all that.\u201d And I said, \u201cI will be the\ntreasurer.\u201d I'm the treasurer, the general secretary of that international convention comes\nfrom New York. He is Deso A. Weiss, M.D.\nHe has been Paul's teacher when he was a kid studying in Vienna, because he came from Austria,\nVienna, Prague, whatever. Paul knew him and admired him as his teacher and his professor.\nHe was 18 years older than me so he was also 13 years older than Paul. He said, \u201cDon't ever\nstart anything with him because one of these days I'm going to America and I don't want my\nwife to have a relationship with my professor.\u201d You only have to say, \u201cDon\u2019t start,\u2019 and\nRenata starts. A week after I meet this guy, ten days, I said to Paul, \"Paul, you're absolutely\nright.\" He doesn't know it yet, but I\u2019m going to get this guy. I'm going to marry him.\u201d He\nwas in a bad marriage, no children. I knew about that. It had nothing to do with anything. I\nachieved that after four years. He was my second husband. He was the great love of my life.\nThat\u2019s Paul, Deso, and Renata. Everything was very friendly, very whatever. How did I\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nmeet Paul, we were young. We had the first sex and he liked my family. He said it was the\ncraziest family he ever married into. I liked his too, but they were different. They were very\nformal, very -- totally different background. Totally business people, very rich. Not showy\nbut very established and we were so bohemian. I've been talking for an hour. You said you\nwanted to give me a break after half an hour. How much more do we have to do?",

Here we weren't vermin, we were just abnormal. We were\nsingled out because we were something they wanted to get rid of. And, to be singled out is\nsomething which I have never liked.

I\nthink nobody really reacted wrong because I didn't know anybody who was in the pro-\nHitler. And don't forget that it is a very free and open society and democratic which is over\nrun by a tyrant so that they were all against him. And whether I was singled out, they were\nsingled out if they were Catholic or Communist or homosexual or whatever. There were so\nmany people singled out. It wasn't just Jews. You were a victim because, you were what do\nyou call it? Occupied. Occupied means they sit on top of you and you have restrictions.\nAlmost everybody had restrictions. The Jews had different restrictions than other people.\nThere was constant curfew. There was black out. It just occurs to me that the atmosphere\nbetween 1940, I was only there from 1940 to 1943 was one of constant interference with\npeople's lives. You couldn't just go to school and learn, you had to learn what they said was\nokay. You couldn't just sit in a street car because maybe there was a Wehrmacht, or a\ngeneral or whatever. Maybe there was a razzia\u2019 on the street and they were rounding up\npeople to go to work camps or Jews to go to whatever.\n\u2019 Razzia: a roundup (Italian).\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nThere was always something going on which had to do with the occupation. I cannot differentiate\noccupation from personal persecution because I didn't suffer really any personal\npersecution, never. I was very lucky. I wasn't dragged by my hair. I wasn't tortured. I wasn't\nthreatened except once during the first interrogation in the prison. That was no fun, but they\nsaid, \u201cIf you don't tell us where you have those papers from,\u201d I had false papers, I\u00ae said,\n\u201cWe're going to stick you in the water until you talk.\u201d I said, \u201c Then I can't talk.\u201d I mean to\ngive you examples. I have had situations where personal chutzpah has saved my life. One of\nthem is I think in the diary. I walked in Bergen Belsen on a very hot July afternoon. We\ncame back from work and I was working in the kitchen. I was working in the kitchen\nbecause not only could I eat, but I could steal for Paul and there was a can of pork meat. As\na Jew you don't like pork meat but when you're hungry who cares. And I take the pork meat,\nthe can and I turned it inside into my bra and I had work overalls and I walk through the\ngate where the SS is to count us, you know ,when we come back and I had no idea that there\nwas a fat stain from here to there over my left bosom and the SS man says, \u201cWas ist los?\nWhat's the matter with you? Ihnen geht wohl die Milch ab? You lose your milk?\u201d I said\nyes, \u201cThat's what it is, can I please go quickly back to the barrack and wash myself because\nthis is awful.\u201d At the same time I had under my hair which was long and I had a net under\nit, a half of pound of margarine or butter. So, if they would have caught me -- I mean I was\nlucky. But you see, when the guy says, \u201cWe stick you in the water until you talk,\u201d I said,\n\u201cThen I can't talk.\u201d I yelled right back and he also. I mean, I was lucky.

Everything I did before and after are part of a mechanism where I\nsomewhere struggled to stay above it, not get involved again. Talking about friends, talking\nabout family, talking about pain or illness, about whatever, but I can tell you one thing, it all\ncame back. Under anesthesia and when I had cancer and I was at Sloan-Kettering, 1992,\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nthey find colon cancer, invasion of the lymph nodes, chemotherapy, the works at Sloan-\nKettering. I'm again dreaming and fighting being strapped, being tethered to a certain thing -\n- my fight with the chemotherapist that I had to be once a week at Sloan-Kettering for a\nyear. After five months they stopped it because I had too many side effects. But I tell you,\nthis is something that goes so deep that I fight anytime when I need anesthesia whatever,\neven at the dentist. Since the war, I will not go under unless they absolutely hit me. Because\nI'm out of control. I need control to survive. And that goes very deep because if you ask me\nabout friends, love, decency, everything stops because I went through so much which I\ndidn't like what I did.\nAmong other things I ate Paul's bread, Paul's ration. The guy was six foot three and I'm just a little\nperson in comparison and I ate his bread and I did things which are not -- it's sheer survival.\nOne thing I never done and I'm very proud of it, I've never done any prostitution. I had\noccasion, but I didn't do it. Not because of moral thing, because I told myself that's stupid.\nBecause you do it with one you have to do , it with a couple of other people. So, I have no\nmoral convictions and I came out totally an amoral person. It went so far that Paul said in\n1945 when we were back home, that he said, \u201cYou've got to see a psychiatrist because you\nare totally demoralized. You don't know anymore what is right or wrong. You pick up\nanything you like because you think they owe it to you. Whether it's an ashtray or a cigarette\nor a piece of meat or a piece of whatever, you steal, you organize. You have no values. You\nhave no respect for anything.\u201d I went into therapy. It took about six months and then he said\nto me, \"Renata, you can do it yourself.\" I said, \u201cWho's paying whom anyway?\u201d But\nwhatever, I learned. I learned because if you live in a normal life where not everything is\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\ntopsy turvy you better adjust because otherwise you can't survive. So, I survived the other\nway. But I'm very bitter. I'm very bitter about things and especially when people complain\nand when people say, \u201cOh, but if Hitler wouldn't have been there and if this and this and this\nwouldn't have happened and if I wouldn't have come to America and maybe I should have\ndone this...\u201d I say, \"It's all up to you. Don't blame anybody. You came through anything.\nThe only people you have to live with eventually is you. If you can look into the mirror in\nthe morning and say it's okay, I'm neither criminal nor an addict nor a this or a that, it's\nfine.\u201d\nBut what you do under I would say the ultimate circumstance of either being dead or alive, I have\nno judgment and no prejudice about that. I can understand that. I'm always afraid of torture\nin the sense that if I've been I would do anything and I wouldn't blame anybody who has\nbetrayed a secret or an organization or anything. Do you understand what I'm talking about?\nWhat I'm so worried about is I'm put in a position where I have to make a real decision\nwhat will happen to somebody else. Let's say a situation where you know that your husband\nor your child or your father or your mother or your friend is being tortured or beaten and\nthat you could save them but you know damn well you can't save them because they beat\nthem anyway and they will kill you too. Joan, I don't like this digging into the past. People\nhave very often said to me, \u201c Renata, why are you doing this? Why are you going to\nGermany. Why do you go now to the Holocaust Museum and give them an interview?\nHaven't you been through enough? Why do you have to do it at all?\u201d I said, \u201cGod knows\nsomebody else can learn something.\u201d If you ask me one question, I'm asking you as if I were\nyou. Would you do anything different than what I did. I would say \u201cYes.\u201d I would not have\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nstayed in Holland. I would have accepted an invitation in 1939 to go to Berkeley. I had a\nfriend who wanted me to go to Berkeley and who knows? But otherwise, I might not write\nanother diary although I still write diaries today. I can't do anything unless I write it down. I\nreally am like the person who says I haven't lived anything until I have written it down.\nBecause then you objectify. You're kind of above it, not any more in it. I never write in\nBergen-Belsen in order to sit 52 years later in Washington and talk about things because I\ndidn't think it would ever be read by anybody, not even by me. It was my survival\nmechanism if I write about it, I objectify. I rise above it because other people were drawing\nor reciting poetry or thinking about food or thinking about the past.

        "A:Why is it vague? I'm trying to think. The first answer is always what you should say. The first\nanswer was that it was so messy. It was so disorganized. There was nothing.

It was a transit camp, transit to what...Transit forward, backwards, back home. I\nhad been there once and had gotten out.

Yes, of course there were guards and there was barbed wire but\nvery far away. It wasn't right -- the guards were not all over the place like in Bergen-Belsen\nor in the concentration camp inVught.

They took the bras away and they took the combs away because they\nknew that the women would suffer from that. Leave it to women. So anyway, I don't know\nwhy I took my lipstick. I don't know why I took perfume, but it was something that would\nremind me of the civilized world. Let me give you another example. When I had a test in\nEnglish at NYU Professor Edel the James scholar, gave us a question, \u201cWhat would you\ntake if you were on an uninhabited island and if you know you would never come back,\nwhich book?\u201d Most people had either the Bible or Hamlet or whatever. What did I have?\nMadame Bovary. So, Edel said , \u201cwhy?\u201d I said, \u201cThe food, the clothes, the ambiance, the\ndiscussions, the love, the whole thing. It's all so bourgeois and that I would miss. So, why\ndoes anybody take whatever it is that's very personal? Reaching back in order to stay on a\ncertain level.

        "A:Of course. I do. Of course, of course, you're homesick. I mean, I keep saying that I can smell the\nleather couch or can see this or that or this enormous desire for flowers, for beauty for air\nfor sea, for cleanliness, for all the things we take for granted. I tell you yesterday I arrive at\nthe Mayflower and the first thing I did is ask the guy who helped me open the window a\nlittle bit or whatever I said, \u201cCan I drink the water?\u201d He said, I don't drink it.\u201d I said,\n\u201cJesus,\u201d to myself, \u201cam I in Leningrad, St. Petersburg or am I in Washington DC?\u201d So, I\ncalled the front desk and I said, \u201cCan I drink the water?\u201d He said, \u201cI drink it.\u201d\u201d These are the\nthings we take so for granted that we have everything.

        "A:l've always liked quiet places. That's right, because how can you concentrate when there is\nbedlam all around you. And especially that early time in Bergen-Belsen, it was just being\nwith other people, just an inconvenience but it doesn't become a torture until 1t becomes so\nbad that you don't know how to defend yourself against one more exertion because you're so\nweak. I don't know. I don't know how I survived. I only know that I couldn't do it again.\nAnd that's now true either because when I got into situations later in life, and in the last four\nyears, people said, \u201cI don't know how you can do this.\u201d Get up and walk to chemotherapy\nand walk back to chemotherapy and these winters that we've had '93 and '94 and '95 and so\non, and not taking morphine and whatever, I just can't do it any other way because I'm still\nthe surviving rat.\nSo, 1t becomes kind of a bad habit. No, I'm very serious about this because it also implies that you\nhave practically, as the French say \u201c\u00e9gards,\u201d no regard, no consideration at all for anybody\nelse. When I got the cancer diagnosis and the operation at Sloan Kettering, it was Christmas\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nand my sister wanted to come and my other family wanted to come, I said, \u201cNobody comes\nuntil I am ready to see you guys.\u201d This goes back to the concentration camp.

Try to get him into the train\nsomewhere.\u201d So Paul got into a carriage, three or four carriages behind mine. And\nsomehow I used every connection, every possibility I had to get him into my carriage. And\nin my carriage he was lying on the floor near the door and near the toilet and I was still\nsitting and he was lying there and he couldn't move. He couldn't cough. He couldn't\nswallow. He was dying. And I told myself, \u201cYou better do something.\u201d\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAnd I began to do things. I began to find water. I began to find whatever I could find outside the\ncarriage, a raw potato, this or that. Once we got bread and so on. And I began to organize\nwith that psychiatrist\u2019s son, Louis M. Tas. We went and we went into the fields and you\nread the story about when we go into the mine fields and we try to get beets and carrots and\npotatoes and whatever and we go into German houses and we bring food back and I spoon\nfed Paul back into life. Then we get into the Russian liberation camp, the hospital and then I\nget typhus. And just...Just in that time Paul begins to sit up and he begins to spoon feed me\nsugar, tea because I have had this incredible high fever and encephalitis. I had these\ntremendous headaches and he feeds me and I have fed him and this becomes a relationship\nwhich has to stop because we basically hate each other. We hate each other. We have\nsurvived something we didn't want. He is at that time -- I'm 24 and he's going on 29 and I\nwant so many different things from him. He wants to get back to his \"speech therapy\" and\nmaybe finally get into medical school if he can ever get a diploma. I want to go and have\nfood and fun and Paris...., Paris for becoming a fashion designer. It never occurred to me to\ndo anything else. I had doodled in Bergen-Belsen. The doodles are in the diary by the way\nand they\u2019re in an exposition in Bergen-Belsen. But anyway, we are growing apart like this\nbecause we are totally different. He gets depressed again. I get--I have to get my morals\nagain. We grow apart and we try to stay together by having a family. So, I have one\nmiscarriage after another. Finally we have a child. The child is eight and half months\npregnant and it chokes itself inside my belly. It's born dead. That's the end of the marriage.\nThat is 1947 in the fall. He has his girlfriend and I have my boyfriends and we finally decide\nin '50 when Deso has arrived in '50, he said, \u201cThat's the man you should have married.\u201d\n\u00b03 RL: \u201cThe child is eight and a half months into my pregnancy.\u201d\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nAnd we remained friends.

Maybe we adopt, maybe\nwe should have somebody else's child, an orphan from the war or whatever.\u201d I said, \u201cNo, if\nwe have a child, it's our child.\u201d He said, \u201cI don't want any children.\u201d He marries the second\ntime. He has four children.",
        "A:Not only do I know his children, I know his wife. I became very good friends with her. She was a\nyoung Dutch, half nobility, half whatever, totally Dutch. And she was the one whom I asked\nbefore I went to America in 1952 I said Helene you have been living with Paul...And we\ndivorced in '50, and in '52 I finally immigrated to Canada. I couldn't go to America because\nI was born in Germany and the German quota was full and I couldn't get out. So, I went to\nCanada on my Dutch passport. I went to Helene, and I said, \u201cWhy don't you marry Paul\nfinally. I am leaving.\u201d She said, \u201cI won't marry a Jew.\u201d I said, \u201cYou won't what?\u201d I said,\n\u201cYou've been living with the guy. He has been baptized. Already his father is this.\u201d She\nsaid, \u201cI won't marry him because my family wouldn't stand for it.\u201d I said, \u201cScrew you. I\ncan't do that. You can't live with a guy and fall in love with him and not marry him.\u201d She\nmarried him and she had four children with him. Finally she got breast cancer. She died. But\nthey were divorced already. He found a friend in Germany where he had moved because he\ncould easier find work in Germany in his field than in Holland. A long story, nothing to do\nwith me. And the interesting thing is that Paul always said, \u201cOne of the best things which\never happened to me is not that you saved my life but that we met and it was wonderful.\u201d\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nThat's nice. That is nice. \u201cYou saved my life, of course it's wonderful.\u201d But he is so\ndepressed that he sometimes feels, \u201cWhat's life?\u201d I don't know. Last question, what do you\nwant to know besides this? You must be dead tired. These are all stories of other people\nand how they relate, this is not necessarily a Holocaust story because it has nothing to do\nwith the horror of Auschwitz and Birkenau. If you're being shoved into the gas, it's much,\nmuch worse I think than being starved and diseased. I don't know. I think because this is the\nfinal victimization because even if you are dying of hunger, even though you're dying of\ndisease, you still have a certain control. If you're being pushed into a shower and it turns out\nto poison you...This is my fear of the anesthesia also. Anything which is done to me where I\ncan't be in control.",

An unbelievable amount of dying percentage wise because people were dying of\ndisease and starvation, but that's a different death than by being pushed into -- I don't know.\nTo me it's much more horrible. Because it's so phony, it's so typical German. You tell them\nthey're going to have a shower. You tell them, \u201cYou're going to be disinfected.\u201d You're\nbeing killed. In Bergen-Belsen they didn't tell you that we're not going to kill you. They said\nwe don't give a shit whether you die. Wir lassen Euch stehen bis Euch die Scheisse\nrunterlauft, \u201c\u201cwe let you stand here on the appell until the shit comes out of you.\u201d\nThey didn't give a damn, but they knew. It wasn't a fake. They weren't faking the people like I later\nget in the diaries where they make people up so that they have -- the women make\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nthemselves up so that they have rosy cheeks or rosy lips so they will not go to the left or to\nthe right. I mean I'm talking about something which 1s a totally different situation. It's\nalmost silken zores. As my Jewish husband said, my second one. He said, \u201cseidene zores.\u201d~*\nIf you compare this to going into poison gas.",
        "A:This is what they call the impersonal...1mpersonal situation in my diary. To me this is that I kept\nthe perspective. And the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung writes about this, and he said, the\namazing thing is also the second book that I could write a dissertation about this crap. He\nsaid that, \u201cShe has the emotional distance to be able to objectify the horrible experience.\u201d\nTo me it is nothing else than survivorism. It's a mechanism.",
        "A:You mean just because I grew up with appendixes in vinegar, experiments and stuff? No, No,\nNo. No, because I'm not a scientist but I'm very organized and I'm -- I don't know.",
        "A:Yes, I'd love to read that because this will bring back what I'm talking about. The mere fact that I\ncan say today is July 1969 on June 15,\"\u201d\u00b0 on Thursday, June 15, 1944 I am thinking a lot\n** seidene zores: silken worries\n\u00b0\u00b0R.L: This was a misspeaking. Renata meant to say here: \u201cJuly 16, 1996 and I am reading here\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nabout after the war. Will we ever be able to convey what these camp years have meant for\nus when we talk with someone who has not actually lived through a similar experience\nhimself. What it is like to see from behind barbed wire, tall, green fir trees and new\nvegetable crops growing along the camp road, what the constant pressure and coercion by\nSS guards and their perennial check ups really mean. How you try all the time to convince\nyourself that it does not touch you. All this shouting, cursing and kicking that you notice\nthat you're growing older and that you're used to slipping through your fingers in these long\nyears of waiting for the end of oppression. What the months mean when you count them in\nhours, days and weeks. And in which the only bright spots are sleep, warm soup, and\nsometimes a ray of sun on the way back to the barracks after another endless roll call in the\ndamp chill of the big center Appell fields. Good moments also, the thoughts and dreams\nabout before. Homesick and more homesick and whether it's the Frenchwomen who sing\nabout \u201cParee, Paree,\u201d or the Italians in their brightly patched Mediterranean get ups or the\nGreek, Spanish Jews from Salonika. They all think of and yearn for only one single thing:\nhome, going home after the war. And what is home? Will we be able to find our way back\nfrom the concentration camp universe into a world in which most of us have no longer any\nother possessions than the memories of before the war and in which we will live among\npeople to whom our years of imprisonment will only mean --\"Oh, there's another one of\nthose who only complain about lost things and tell horror stories.\" This is true. Now, if you\nput this while you're there how much have you written yourself out of the situation. I\nclimbed above it, out of it and was neither in the past or in the future but I was me. They\ncouldn't take it away and I think this is not only me, this is where I feel this camp diaries are\ncrucial to show what human beings could do with their brain. Write themselves above, out,\nmy Bergen-Belsen diary entry, made on Thursday, June 15, 1944.\u201d\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nand through it.",
