        "Question: It\u2019s the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington,\nD.C. It is Friday, 13 August 2010, 14:30 hours. We\u2019re interviewing Mr. Virgil\nMyers, who served in the 80\" infantry division, Patton\u2019s third army, 317\"\nregiment. Mr. Myers, can you briefly describe your childhood?",
        "Answer: I was \u2014 I was brought up on a farm, and I lived on a farm until I was 18\nyears of age, and then I began to work for Quaker Oats company, and to go to\njunior college at night. And I graduated from the junior college, and then I was\nmarried at 20 years of age. And I still worked for Quaker Oats company. And I\nstarted to work for \u2014 I started to go to business college, which Quaker Oats paid\nfor. And I graduated two years later, going to school at night, from business college.\nAnd I \u2014 my wife and I had a daughter a year and a half after we were first married.\nAnd so, the war came along. I was working at a job with Quaker, which was\nproviding food for the military. And they deferred me one time for a year, then my\nname came up again, and I s-said well, Pll probably go this time. They said no, you\nhave more important job here. And so they deferred me the second time. I was\ndowntown one day and a lady came by and she stopped me by pulling my arm. She\nsaid, are you in the military? And I said, no ma\u2019am, I work for Quaker Oats\ncompany. She said, well I have two sons and you look as healthy as they are. And I\ndon\u2019t understand why that they\u2019re in the military and you\u2019re not. And that began to\nworry me and to bear on my mind. And the next time when my deferment come up,\nthey asked me, and I said no, I don\u2019t want it. Which turned out to be a bad decision\non my part, I thought many, many times during the war.",
        "Q: So, when \u2014 when and where did you enter the army\u201d?",
        "A: I entered it Saint Joseph \u2014 well, actually at Leavenworth, Kansas. I was\ninducted from Saint Joe, Missouri and went into the army in Leavenworth,\nKansas. Was transferred from Leavenworth to Camp Hood, Texas. And I was one\nof the first groups that their training period was reduced from 18 weeks to 12\nweeks. And we had 12 weeks of basic training, which really amounted to one day of\nlooking at a weapon and being told what it was, the next day you would tear that\nweapon down, clean it and put it back together many, many times. The next day you\nwould spend a half a day in a schoolroom, showing videos of how that weapon was\nused in combat. And then the next day you would go on a different weapon. And\nthat\u2019s the way it was for the 12 weeks. And you learned to ha \u2014 you hadn\u2019t night\nproblems that you would use that weapon for a half a day, and then you were on a\ndifferent type of a weapon. At the end of, really the first week that we were there\nwas just being assigned, getting our billets, getting our clothes, and everything. So\nwhen it come right down to it, you only had 10 weeks of basic training, because the\nlast week you were there, they were giving you orders to go home, and then to\nwhere you were to go from there. So you \u2014 at the time I went through, you really\nonly had 10 weeks of basic training.",
        "Q: And when were those dates in \u2014 when \u2014 when \u2014 when were those inclusive\ndates?",
        "A: I we \u2014 I went in \u2014 in \u2014 on \u2014 on the \u2014 the first week in May, and the \u2014",
        "Q: Of year \u2014 year?",
        "A: Of 1944, and I came home for 10 days furlough. Then I was sent to Fort Mead,\nMaryland and we got on a ship, the \u2014 th-the \u2014 the first part of September of 1944.\nAnd from there we went to Liverpool, England, which took us 10 days to go\nacross the ocean in a c \u2014 big convoy. And then we landed in Liverpool, we got off\nof one boat, walked down the dock, got on another boat, or ship, and went across\nthe channel. And I got off at Omaha Beach on the 27\" of September. Went up on\nthe hill at Omaha Beach, which at that time was a replacement center. They had\ntwo men tents there. And each t \u2014 and it rained every hour that we were on Omaha\nBeach, and they would tell \u2014 they told us when we were assigned to our tent, there\nis a bulletin board right down here. You look at that bulletin board at least once\nevery four hours because your name will appear and you will be deployed from here\nto some unit. We had no idea where we were going to be deployed. On the second\nafternoon, they \u2014 we went to the bulletin board, and my name and elethe \u2014 and\neleven other names were on the bulletin board, and we were told to load on a truck\nat 12 o\u2019clock and at 12 o\u2019clock we \u2014 12 of us loaded on, and there was a sergeant on\nthe truck. He says, I will be in charge of you until you reach the deployment area\nwhere you\u2019ll be assigned. Six hours later we ended up at Pont A Mousson, France\non the Moselle river. And the 80\" \u2014 and when we got there, we actually unloaded\non the west side of the river. And a first sergeant by the name of Percy Smith came\nup, and he was just a small fellow, about five foot six, smoking a big stogie. And he\nsaid, I want you fellows to know that you have just been assigned to Company G, of\n317, the fightingest damned outfit in the United States Army. Well, maybe they all\ntold us that, I don\u2019t know. But that was our approach when we first reached there.\nLined up, he got our names, our serial number, and he said, is there anyone here that\nhas ever fired a 60 millimeter mortar? And Ken Mauer(ph), who happened to have\ntaken basic training in Fort Hood with me, was in the same group that I was in,\nwhich is a miracle for two people to be, but we were replacements. At that time we\nfound out that the 80\" had taken a lot of casualties, and that they needed\nreplacements. So Percy said, you see that bunch of trees about three blocks down\nthere? We said yes. He said, there\u2019s a sergeant by the name of Fadinas(ph). You\nreport to him, and he\u2019s really gonna be glad to see you, because he lost five of his\nsquad yesterday in an artillery barrage. So, that was our re \u2014 first experience to\nbeing near combat situation. And so we were assigned to the Company G, near\nDieulouard, France on the 29\" or 30\" of September of 1944.",
        "Q: I\u2019m sorry sir, I should have asked straight away, what is your date of birth?",
        "A: July 6\", 1918.",
        "Q: Thank you sir. I\u2019m sorry, carry on.",
        "A: No \u2014so, we went down and met Fadinas(ph), reported to him. Turned out he\nwas a Russian that had come over as a teenager, to get away from the Germans.\nAnd he had gotten his citizenship by volunteering to come into the United States\nArmy when he was 18 years old. And at that time he was about 20. And so, he was\na very dedicated American soldier, but he hated the Germans with a passion,\nbecause his parents and his grandparents both had been eliminated by the SS in\nRussia.",
        "Q: What was your first experience, your first personal direct experience with\ncombat?",
        "A: My first personal experience was the next day. We were to take a labor camp on\nthe east side of the Moselle river. We had then, after we landed, we went across the\nriver near Saint Genevieve. And Company G was near Saint Genevieve, France,\nand we were to take ov \u2014 a Polish labor camp that was supposed to be in some\nwoods, that were just beyond where we were. Well, as we started out, we started\nthrough these woods, and the Germans laid in an artillery barrage. And I can\nremember that Ken and I were so naive, that we were standing there and saying, oh\nlook, that artillery shell hit that tree and knocked the whole top out of it. Because\nwe'd never seen anything like that. And we were \u2014 were talking about how the\nshells were knocking the limbs off of these trees, never thinking about that we could\nget hit ourself. Well, after they k \u2014 shot about 12 shells, it seemed that the Germans\nwould traverse to another area, and our lieutenant said, c\u2019mon fellows, let\u2019s go.\nWell, we got up and we started and we walked about 50 yards. And here was the\nfellow laying on the ground with the medics, and he had the top of his helmet and\nhis head completely cut off with a piece of shrapnel. And I looked, and it was one\nof the fellows that rode up on the truck with me. Here\u2019s a guy that just got into\ncombat, didn\u2019t even have his rifle off his shoulder, and was killed before we even\ngot started. Well, the next time that shells started exploding in trees around us, Ken\nand I were the first ones to stick our heads into the roots of the trees, because we\ndidn\u2019t want that to happen to us. And it was a very vivid experience of finding out\nwhat happens in combat, in a hurry. But we took that labor camp that day, and freed\nabout 40 Polish labor \u2014 laborers out of a camp that were providing labor for an\nelectrical company in the area of Pont A Mousson.",
        "Q: Do you recall the name of the camp?",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t. I di \u2014 at that time I was so dumb, and so naive, that we didn\u2019t know\nanything. You know, thinking back to those days, compared to the army today, we\nwere so dumb, and so naive compared to what the soldiers are today, because\nthey\u2019ve been trained, they\u2019re professionals, they know what they\u2019re doing, they\nknow what their assignments are. And we didn\u2019t even have an assignment before\nwe came up that day before. And we were mortar men, and had had two days\nexperience on a mortar before we came up to that 1 \u2014 to that day.",
        "Q: Do you ver \u2014 do you remember the condition of the Polish prisoners, were they\nwell cared for, were they \u2014",
        "A: No, they were \u2014 they were, as I remember, wearing very ragged clothes, dirty\nclothes. And that they were very skinny, and I would say that they were not well\ntaken care of at all.",
        "Q: Did you communicate with any of them?",
        "A: No, no, we didn\u2019t. I didn\u2019t.",
        "Q: And, you said you were a mortar man?",
        "A: I was a 60 millimeter mortar man. Two days later \u2014",
        "Q: Hang \u2014 I\u2019m sorry \u2014",
        "A: Oh, okay.",
        "Q:\u2014I\u2019m sorry to interrupt you, I beg your pardon. Did \u2014 did you establish what sort\nof work were the prisoners engaged in?",
        "A: What kind \u2014 you \u2014 they were now \u2014 it was our understanding that they were\nworking an electrical plant in the area of Pont A Mousson, yeah.",
        "Q: Was it \u2014 was it a hydro-electric, or was it coal driven, or \u2014",
        "A: Oh, no you\u2019re dri \u2014 it \u2014 1t was one \u2014 there was no dams or anything around there,\nso it had to be some kind of a \u2014 a \u2014 like oil driven, or motor \u2014 some kind of motors.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: I\u2019m sorry. Carry on, please.",
        "A: Yeah. So, that \u2014 that day was our experience of \u2014 of going into \u2014 to that. And so\nthen we came back to the area of Saint Genevieve, and we then were assigned, our\nnext objective was to take a village and a road junction at Sivry, which was about\n10 miles east of the area that we were at that time. Now, you understand that\ncompanies of infantrymen, one company will take an area and go forward. There\nwill be two companies that usually will go forward, and one company in reserve.\nThat next day we were in reserve. These other two companies had gone forward\nfrom Dieulouard east into France. And then we were brought up from reserve, and\nsaid your objective is to take this little village of Sivry, s-i-v-r-y, France. There is a\nroad junction there that the Ge-Germans are using that comes down from the\nmountains of s \u2014 of Saint \u2014 Saint Jane, and Saint Mihiel, and coming down and\nfurnishing supplies to the Germans up around Metz. So we want to cut that road\noff. We went into the little village of Sivry, set up our road blocks, never had a fire\n\u2014 shot fired at us. We went into this little village, dug our foxholes, set up our\ndefenses in our \u2014 our area. At midnight that night, the Germans started firing from\nthe mountains. Now, these are not peaks, these are big hills. They had set up their\nartillery and mortars on top of these two big hills that overlooked this valley, and at\nmidnight they started firing on Company G because we were the only ones in this\nvillage at that time. And there\u2019s about 75 houses and a big church in this village. By\ndaybreak there was not one building in that little village that was still standing. We\nwent in that village that day, short of our component of [indecipherable] we had\n169 men. And they shelled us every time anybody would move outside of a foxhole.\nThey let us dig in, the oth \u2014 that afternoon before, and never fired on us. But that\nnight they started firing on that field, and the village. And by the next morning, all\nthose houses were completely flat. And they kept firing all morning. The afternoon\nfog moved in, and it began to get dark about 4:30 in the afternoon and we got notice\nto pull out. Out of the 159, the daily report of Company G shows that 40 men\nwalked out, and back up over the hill that night. Now, I don\u2019t know that all of them\ngot killed. We know that about 38 of them got captured in that village, but the rest\nof them were injured, and that was \u2014 that was my first day of real combat, and you\ncan become an experienced person of combat in a very short time.",
        "Q: Were you involved in the Battle of the Bulge as well?",
        "A: Yes. On \u2014 we were near Saint Avold, France, near a little \u2014 in a little village\ncalled Gunwaller(ph), and we had just finished the battle of Farebersviller on\nNovember the 27\", through the 29\". And we had come up to Saint Avold, and were\nin reserve. And we were there and we notice of a m \u2014 and about nine o\u2019clock in the\nmorning, there will be trucks here at 12 o\u2019clock to load us up, because we\u2019re gonna\ntake a trip up to Luxembourg. Well, nobody knew where the heck Luxembourg\nwas. We didn\u2019t \u2014 had never heard of it even. And so we, after \u2014 on the way up there,\nwell, we got talking about it and trying to figure out what we were gonna do. We\nhad heard that the Germans had broke through up there, and that we were supposed\nto go up and support the troops that were up there. Well, it\u2019s about 125 miles from\nSaint Avold up to where we were going. And that evening, or that night, we ended\nup just east of Luxembourg city at Gonderange, between Gonderange and\nJunglinster. And the next morning we got notice, Company G was to be\ntransferred, and we got in trucks and went up over \u2014 they call them mountains, we\ncall them big hills here \u2014 they went over the big hill to Steinsul(ph), a village of\nSteinsul(ph). And from Steinsul(ph) we went to the west. He wa \u2014 he ended up in\nMersch where headquarters company, but we were west of Mersch on the\nmountain west and going down the ridge north towards Ettelbruck. And we walked\nall evening, and up to about 10 o\u2019clock at night, and we found a big barn, and it was\nsn \u2014 it was beginning to sleet. And they put us up \u2014 we all got into that barn, and\nlaid down and slept til the next morning. But we could hear gunfire during the\nnight, so we knew that we were getting close to the \u2014 the front. But it was still about\nfive miles north before we ran into any activity at all, which was just west of\nEttelbruck. And from there we went to Niederfeulen, and we were at\nNiederfeulen and then it began to snow and got cold as hell. Cold as hell. And the\nnext day would have been the 234 \u2014 well, we were in Niederfeulen a couple a\u2014a\ncouple of days, and then we were supposed to go north of Niederfeulen to\nBourscheid and Walscheid and Kehmen. And as we went up the ridge, and got\njust south of Kehmen, they opened fire on us, and we didn\u2019t realize it, but they had\na mountain to the east and north of that area, that they could see the whole area, it \u2014\nit was like open country to them, and they could see us. And that was where what\nwas called Bloody Ridge, today, yet today to the Luxembourg people, because we\nwere tied down there for two days, and took severe \u2014 317 took severe casualties all\nthat two days, because every time anybody got out of a foxhole, they would get shot\nat, because they could see them from across the valley from that mountain in the\nwoods where they had their artillery and mortars dug in. And that\u2019s what most of it\nwas, was shrapnel from artillery, and 1t would hit the frozen ground, and it would\njust skip, and hit people, if you were exposed. And from there \u2014 we were there two\ndays. They drew us back, and then we went into Hiderscheid(ph), and into \u2014 we\nwent into Hiderscheid(ph), and replaced \u2014 319 had been in, that was another\nregiment of the 80\", and they \u2014 they pulled out and moved farther west, towards\nBastogne, and we then replaced them at Hiderscheid(ph). And we got\ncounterattacked that first night, and then we were able to save that. And then our\nobjective was to go across the \u2014 it\u2019s the cliff river in that area that goes on down.\nBut from there, we were on the front side of that mountain, near Tadler and Ringel\nand all that area, for almost two weeks, right in that area, because they were across\nthe valley firing back at us, and hell, we couldn\u2019t move. We \u2014 every time we \u2014 we\nwould move \u2014 plus the fact that supplies, we didn\u2019t have supplies, and then on the\n21% of January, we had \u2014 our objective was to start from Ringel to go down the\nvalley and up over the mountain to Bourscheid, and to help to take Bourscheid. I\nwas in what was called the weapons platoon, the fourth platoon, and I had 26 men\nthat morning. And Captain Namkowitz(ph), who was the company commander\nsaid, Myers, take your men and \u2014 and \u2014 and along with Heizer(ph) and his machine\ngun, you fellows walk up the \u2014 the fire alley in the forest, because, he said, you can\ncarry your weapons, we don\u2019t need you til you get to the top. Well, we didn\u2019t know\nit, but they had an 88 dug in up at the top, and there was 15 to 18 inches of snow on\nthe ground, and it was 18 below zero that morning, and \u2014 or that afternoon. As we\nwalked up the hill \u2014 now, out of my squad that \u2014 that day, of 12 men, I had nine\nmen that had just come up, because they were new replacements, just \u2014 and I \u2014 I\nwas an old man then, because I\u2019d had from October, November, December, so I had\n90 days of experience of \u2014 of that. I was 26 years old, and everybody wanted to get\ninto my squad because I was the oldest man there. And they thought that because I\nwas older that I was \u2014 I was \u2014 maybe could keep them safe. Well, tha-that didn\u2019t ha\n\u2014 that wasn\u2019t the way it was in combat. You just were lucky wherever you were.\nBut anyway, I had young men, inexperienced, and as the 88 started firing down the\nfirepath at us, they started running. We kept hollering, drop in the snow, drop in the\nsnow. Well, they didn't do it. They ran to get into the trees. And the Germans had\nwire traps all up the hill, with bouncing Betty booby traps that were half gallon\nbucket size, s-syrup bucket size, that would jump 40 inches in the air and explode,\nand they were filled with shrapnel. And they were devastating. Well, when we\nstarted to run, Heizer(ph) and I hit the ground in the center of the firepath, in the\nsnow. They were running, they hit these, and out of the 26 men, 22 of them got \u2014\nwere casualties. And that afternoon, that \u2014 after that afternoon, four o\u2019clock they\ncalled off the \u2014 the advance. About the fi \u2014 si \u2014 third or fourth shell that that 88\nfired, tanks started firing at that 88 and finally knocked it out. But that was \u2014 we\nonly had about four or five shells from that 88, and that was all because they\nknocked it out. But that evening, there were so many casualties in G Company, that\nthat evening, not only in G Company, but in the second battalion going up that hill,\nthat when they called it off, they\u2019ve all had \u2014 called for volunteers of 22 men from\nthe company, and two officers to carry the casualties to \u2014 back towards Ringel, so\nthey could be put in trucks and into ambulances to be taken back to the first aid.\nAnd that day, after that day, gi\u2014 G Company had less than 50 men in \u2014 in it that\nday, and we were attached then for three more days to another company, because\nwe were declared inoperative. So, until we could get more replacements up, why,\nwe were attached to another company and that \u2014 that was one day that you don\u2019t\nforget.",
        "Q: After \u2014 1-1t seems to me that in an extraordinarily compressed period of time, you\nexperienced a tremendous amount of combat, and saw a lot of losses and a lot of\nmen killed. At that point, did that experience change the way that you felt about the\nwar, and your role in it?",
        "A: Well, I went to Captain Namkowitz(ph), and I said, Captain, I had \u2014 by that time\nI had a squad of six men, myself, and then the other sergeant, Sergeant\nMagarlick(ph) had six men. We had lost so many men I went to Captain\nNamkowitz(ph) and I said, I think that I\u2019m bad luck, and that I hadn\u2019t b \u2014 outta be a\nsquad leader. He said, Myers, he said, it\u2019s not your fault. He said, work with me.\nHe said, you\u2019ve got more experience than anybody else around here now. He said,\ndon\u2019t do this to me. And so that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s the only reason I stayed, was because he \u2014\nhe asked me to, and he talked me out of it, because I really felt that I was bad luck.",
        "Q: Did you, as you were advancing, come across any concentration camps?",
        "A: No, not in that area.",
        "Q: When \u2014 after you moved into the Rhineland and what have you, wh-what was\nyour first experience o-of coming across a camp?",
        "A: The first experience, of course, was \u2014 was, for me was not until we got clear to\nboo \u2014 to Weimar.",
        "Q: And when was that? Da-Datewise?",
        "A: And that was April the 12\", the morning of April \u2014 when \u2014 when Company G,\nand the 80\" division came up to Weimar, and the 319\" came to Weimar and they\nsent a message to the mayor of Weimar, surrender the city, or we will attack it with\ntanks and artillery.",
        "Q: Yeah, 319 was armor, was it not?",
        "A: No, 319 was another \u2014 was another regiment of the 80\" division.",
        "Q: Okay, so it was infantry.",
        "A: It was infantry. And they came up and all of us, each regiment had an armored\nunit attached to it, like the 307. Three \u2014 307 tank battalion was attached to the\nsecond battalion of 317. But three wee \u2014 actually, 317 as we came \u2014 we had been in\nErfurt for three days fighting. And then we started and came to Weimar, and it\u2019s\nonly 10 miles to Weimar from Erfurt. And when we got to Erfurt, why 319 was\nahead of us, and 317 was in reserve. They call it reserve, we were held \u2014 we were\nall like a mile back of them, so that if they got in trouble, why we could be deployed\nup to help them. But we stopped and we sat there for \u2014 for quite a \u2014 for about three\nor four hours. And finally, why they gave the message to the mayor to surrender the\ncity, and he and a lady on a bicycle came out with a white flag, and they\nsurrendered the city. So, 319 went around the city, 317, with the second battalion,\ncame into Weimar and we were the only ones that was in Weimar from the 80\"\ndivision actually, because 319 skirted it and went around, and 318 followed them.\n317 was left in reserve so that we could \u2014 our \u2014 ou-our assignment was to do police\nwork and keep control of the city. And that\u2019s what we did. 317, the three \u2014 the\nsecond battalion walked right down the main street from the west, into Weimar. As\nwe walked down the street, we were on both sides of the street, about five, 10 yards\napart, each one of us, as we got downtown, the civilians that were on the street as\nwe walked by, would turn their back to us and face the walls of the stores, and\nwouldn\u2019t look at us. Wouldn\u2019t look at us at all. But the kids, the kids would run out\nand say, have you got any gumy(ph), gumy(ph), gumy(ph) chocolate. And so they\nwere just like kids back home. And when we got downtown, to Weimar, we went\ndown to the plaza that is right in the center of town by the city hall, and company G,\nCaptain Namkowitz(ph) set his headquarters up in a building right down on the \u2014\non the square. So he signed all the different ones. I had to s-set up on a street with\nmy mortars, near the railroad station, so that I could see down the railroad tracks, in\ncase that a train come, or something like that. So, we were there. We kept seeing\nthese people who were in striped suits. Not many, but we would see them once in\nawhile, walk by. Finally Captain Namkowitz(ph) told Percy Smith, who was the\nfirst sergeant of G Company, he said, Percy, he says, you take down Smith the\nJeep driver in a Jeep and get Myers, and you guys go see if you can find out where\nthe hell these guys are coming from. He said, wa \u2014 where are they coming from? He\nsaid, we\u2019d see \u2014 they must be a \u2014 a prison, or a jail around here that they\u2019re getting\nout of. So, we started, and we asked four different civilians, where are these\nprisoners? Nix(ph), nixt(ph), we don\u2019t know, we don\u2019t know. They didn\u2019t know\nwhere they were coming from. Well, we went down to the railroad st \u2014 track, or\ndown by the station and saw two boys that were about 10 - 12 years old. Percy\ncould speak a little bit of German, and Percy got out of the Jeep and he went over\nto these boys, he said, where are these prisoners coming from? And they said, oh,\nway out on the hill, way up on a hill, way out in the country. So, we started to drive\nout in that direction. We drove for about four miles, and we thi \u2014 and we got to\ntalking, we said, you know, those damn kids, they \u2014 they\u2019ve given us bad direction,\nthere can\u2019t be anything out here, and we still didn\u2019t see it. But we were on a\ncountry, a dirt road that had been traveled a lot. So, Don said, well, we\u2019ll just follow\nthis up around the hill. So we went up around the hill, and then right at the top of\nthis hill, here was a 10 foot wire fence. Guys were just leaning against it, just\nlooking. We drove up to the gate, and we didn\u2019t know what it was. We saw all these\nbuildings. Now, at the wi \u2014 at that time, we didn\u2019t realize that we were at the back\ngate of Buchenwald, which was down by where the museum is now. But there was\na fence all around that area on the west side of the camp, and we came up on the\nwest side of the camp. And Percy got out and he asked the guy, he said, what is this\nplace, anyway? And the guy says, ein minute, ein minute. He goes into a barracks\nand comes out with a little fellow that was five foot six. Skinny? God, he didn\u2019t\nweigh 70 pounds, he didn\u2019t weigh 60 pounds. He said, my name 1s so and so, and I\nam from Lithuania. He said, I\u2019ve been in this camp for four years. He could speak\nEnglish, very good English. He said, I been in this camp for four years, and he said,\nthis is Buchenwald work camp. Percy said, work camp, what the hell is a work\ncamp? He said, well, we furnish \u2014 he said, they come here and this 1s a big camp.\nHe said, there\u2019s other little camps all around, at the industries and out 1n the farms,\nthat furnish labor from here. And he said \u2014 Percy said, well, who\u2019s in charge here?\nHe said, well, the SSers were until last night, and they heard that you were headed\nthis way, and, he said, they ran. He said, there was about 3,000 of them here. We\nsaid, 3,000? And he said yes, he said, there was approximately 3,000 here before\nyou came here. He said, how many people are in this camp, anyway? Well, we\ncould see \u2014 now, where we came in, there were low one, just one story buildings\nthat looked like they had been put up in a hurry. They had just \u2014 I don\u2019t know\nwhether it was straw board, or what, but it wasn\u2019t \u2014 it \u2014 1t was \u2014 looked like\ntemporary buildings. And so he said, this camp here, is \u2014 is the west part \u2014 he said,\nthe main gate is over there. Well, we didn\u2019t know that there was a name \u2014 main\ngate. And later on, we found out that other people from 317 had come in on the\nfront side of the gate. But he said, there was some guys here yesterday in a\nmotorized vehicle, kind of like a tank, but he said, they didn\u2019t even come in. They\njust were here for a short time, and he said, they left. And we said, well, what did\nyou have to \u2014 what are you eating? And he said, well, he said, the SSers had some\npotato peelings that they had peeled yesterday and threw in the dump, and he said,\nwe got them and washed them, and then, he said, we went over there and got green\ngrass and brought over and put in with that, and he said, that\u2019s all we\u2019ve had to eat\ntoday. So, we went inside the camp, just to the first row of buildings, and in front of\nthe barracks, they had people laying out, and Percy says, what happened to them?\nOh, they just died. They just died. And about that time, here come six guys pulling a\ntwo wheel cart up from around the corner, down below. And they were picking\nthese dead guys up and putting them on this two wheel cart. And I don\u2019t know what\nthey were doing with them when they got them, you know. But Percy said, well, I\ndon\u2019t remember was Percy, me or Don said, what do they do with them? Well, he\nsays, they have a cremator \u2014 had \u2014 they have an oven up there. An oven? Yeah, he\nsaid, they burn them. He said, they burn the bodies. Well, come find out they had\ntwo crematories there with four ovens in each building, and they worked them 24\nhours a day, seven days a week. And \u2014 so Percy said, how many people are here?\nHe said, well, we think there is about 26,000 here now. And Percy said, who\u2019s in\ncharge? Well, we have a committee that\u2019s in charge, but, he said, really nobody\u2019s in\ncharge. He said, a bunch of them took off after the SSers. He said, they broke into\nthe armament, and they are after the SSers now. And he said, we\u2019ve got ninet \u2014 now\nI\u2019m \u2014I-\u2014I might be wrong, but he said \u2014 I think that he said, we have 19 of them\nlocked up on the other side in a building. And so Percy and I and Don went back to\ntown and Captain Namkowitz(ph), we told him what we\u2019d found. He said, well,\nI\u2019m going to call division and tell them what\u2019s there. So they said, well, we\u2019ll have\nsome trucks with some food and blankets and medicine up there tomorrow. So, I\nwas assigned with my five man \u2014 six man, I was assigned from the 13\", the 14\" and\nup until about noon on the 15\" to go around and pick up these guys that were in \u2014 s-\nstraggling in town, and to take them back out to camp for \u2014 so that they could get\nmedicine. And some of the fellows didn\u2019t want to go back out to camp. But we told\nthem that they were gonna be food out there, the best we could. Tried to tell them,\nbut we had one fellow that was at the edge of town, and he came out of a house\neating a potato that must have weighed a pound. And he was just eating that thing\njust like 1t was a candy bar. He walked out to \u2014 almost to where our je \u2014 truck was \u2014\nJeep, and he fell over. Well, we picked him up, put him in the Jeep and took him\nback out to the camp, and Dr. Bob out there, he was our battalion medic, he was out\nthere and by that time they had set up some medics also that had got there. And he\nsaid, this poor guy, he didn\u2019t weigh 60 pounds. He said, this poor guy was e \u2014 we\ntold him what happened, and he said, well, probably the starch in the potato was just\ntoo much for his system and he just can\u2019t handle it, he just couldn't handle it. So, on\nthe 15\", then, I was r \u2014 they \u2014 I was relieved by \u2014 now, I \u2014 I think it was people \u2014\nfellows from a cavalry that replaced us, but by that time then, our headquarter, our\ncompany headquarters had moved, and we went to Gina(ph). Gina(ph) was east of\nthere, and so we went to Gina(ph) from \u2014 from there.",
        "Q: When you said you su \u2014 you supplied them with blankets and medicine and \u2014\nand food and what have you, what sort of food did you provide? Were they K\nrations, was it [indecipherable] what was it?",
        "A: It da\u2014 da\u2014Iha-\u2014I?d\u2014Ihonestly don\u2019t know, because I didn\u2019t go into the camp\nto see, but I would assume, I would assume that it was probably K ra \u2014 K rations or\nsomething like that, the f\u2014 on that first truck.",
        "Q: Sure. And how long \u2014 how long of a di\u2014 did you spend actually inside the camp\nitself?",
        "A: I would say th \u2014 probably th \u2014 30 minutes maybe. Maybe 30 minutes that we\ntook and saw what was happening and everything. The guys never \u2014 they just\nlooked by us when we were in there. Now, some of them, four or five trailed along\nwith us, as we were walking in there. But other than that, they were so sick. And I\ndidn\u2019t realize it until this year, when we were in Weimar and was talking to fellows\nthat were in the camp, that the backside of Buchenwald was called the death camp.\nThat when they had people that were so sick and so emancipated that they thought\nthey were gonna die, they would bring them back to that part of the camp and \u2014 and\nput them there. They asked me in the evening if I would tell about finding the camp\nand what I had seen and such as this. One fellow, afterwards he said, he was in the\ncr \u2014 in the group, and he held his hand up, and I said, yes, sir? He said, what you\nhave just said, I can verify every word, because, he said, I was a 16 year old Jewish\nboy that had typhus fever, that they had put me into the death camp. I said, what do\nyou mean death camp? He said, that\u2019s what that part of the camp was called. If they\nexpected you to die in the next four or five days. And he said, I was destined to be\neliminated in four or five days, but you guys came along, and saved my life. And I\nsaid no, the SSers were gone. We didn\u2019t save you, we \u2014 we just happened to come\nup there. He said no, they knew that you were coming and they left. So, he said, I\nwant to come up and shake your hand. And he did, and he started crying, and so did\nI. And so, he said, my name is \u2014 my name is Klein. He said, I have been an\nAmerican citizen for over 45 years and I\u2019m ar \u2014 a\u2014a Jewish rabbi in California. |\nhave his picture with his wife and his son, that had been invited to come back to\nWeimar as one of the former prisoners. And he said, I just want to thank you,\nbecause you saved my life. And I said, no, we didn\u2019t. But, I said \u2014 he said, well, as\nfar as I\u2019m concerned, you did, because the next day I was in a hospital in Gina(ph),\nand two days after that, I was in England, and he said, then I was sent to the United\nStates to completely recover, and that\u2019s where I\u2019ve stayed.",
        "Q: As you pressed on, did you come across any of the subcamps, or any other\nconcentration camps as you [indecipherable]",
        "A: Now, they told us that there were subcamps all around, that they furnished labor\nout of there. Now, part of our 319 came by a camp called Orndorf(ph), which was\nto the west of there. And this year we went back to Orndorf(ph) and course all it is\nthere is the same way at \u2014 at Buchenwald, is just where the buildings were, and a\nmonument that they have there in a couple places. But at that time, it was a hellhole,\nbecause they didn\u2019t treat them as nice as they treated them even in Buchenwald,\nwhich it was horrible.",
        "Q: Having seen what you saw in the camps, in Buchenwald, did it alter your view\nof th \u2014 of the war, and your role in it?",
        "A: Well, 1t made me realize why that we were fighting. That \u2014 that solidified why\nwe were over there.",
        "Q: And did it alter the way that you dealt or interacted with the German populace?",
        "A: Not really, not really. Because I didn\u2019t \u2014 w-we were in the infantry in the line\ncompanies, and we weren\u2019t in headquarters and such as that. So, w-we only got\nbuildings that had been assigned to us. We weren\u2019t in the job of taking buildings, or\ntaking \u2014 making our own assignments. But I would say that this time, at the\nbanquet, the prime minister of [indecipherable] looked at we five guys that were\nthere, and he sa \u2014 when he started talking, he said, I want to thank you for freeing\nthe German people from the tyranny of the Nazi political regime, because he said,\nwe were prisoners and didn\u2019t realize it as well as these people here at Buchenwald\nwere. And I thought that was quite a statement. And \u2014 but it proves what can\nhappen to politicians when they get too much power.",
        "Q: When you first came across Buchenwald, did you have any idea what you were\nlooking at? Di \u2014 wa \u2014 wou \u2014 had you heard stories, had you heard reports about\nconcentration camps, or was \u2014 did it completely take you by surprise?",
        "A: Well, this took us by surprise, because we had heard of concentration camps, but\nwe didn\u2019t really know what they were. We hadn\u2019t seen any \u2014 I hadn\u2019t seen any\npictures of any, and I didn\u2019t know that they were as big as what Buchenwald was,\ndamn, that covered 400 acres. And the \u2014 the buildings that were there, there were\nthree story buildings, there were two story buildings, and then there were a lot of\nthese pre \u2014 kind of prefab buildings around the west side, the edge there, where we\ncame up. And that, I couldn\u2019t \u2014 \u2019'd \u2014 I was amazed, really, because I\u2019d \u2014 I didn\u2019t\nrealize that \u2014 that the labor camp, what the heck they were doing with that many\npeople for a labor camp, you know\u201d?",
        "Q: Sure. Did you stay on after the war, with the \u2014 with the unit in Germany\u201d",
        "A: In Germany, I stayed. I\u2014I\u2014I didn\u2019t come home until the 16\" of January of\n1946. After the war, or at the end of the \u2014 after the war was over, Percy Smith got\nto come home because he had enough points, and I took over as first sergeant of G\nCompany, and I was acting gi \u2014 first sergeant for almost five months. And so, from\n\u2014 we were at Shpital(ph) on the Russian line, and we were \u2014 we furnished guard\nduty fo \u2014 at [indecipherable] Goering and Hitler and all had the paintings and all\nof the beautiful things, artwork that was done, but I never got to go inside until 25\nyears after that, the wife and I went back and I got to go inside of the\nNeuschwateine(ph) castle there. And that was first time. I was on guard duty\noutside for almost a month, but I didn\u2019t get inside. But I did then, but \u2014",
        "Q: Do you remember receiving your orders home?",
        "A: Well, yes, because I gave them to myself. At the \u2014 we were \u2014 we were in\nBavaria up until November, then we went to Czechoslovakia when they had an\nelection of \u2014 in Czechoslovakia. Then we came back to Schongau, and at\nSchongau we were there probably \u2014 I said November, it was October when we\nwent to \u2014 to czechosl \u2014 or to \u2014 yeah, Czechoslovakia. And then we came back\nSchongau for a month, then we went to Aufschaffensburg(ph), Germany, which\nat that time was a deployment point. And our job was that they would send in G.L.s\nfrom all over Europe into Aufschaffensburg(ph) and each morning I would get\norders \u2014 well, when they would come in, I would get their orders, that they would \u2014\nthe name, and how many points they had, and their number. And then I would get\neach morning, an order, today you have to ship out so many people to f\u2014 to go\nhome, but they have to have so many points. So I would go through the rosters, and\npick out the \u2014 the rest of the guys were doing nothing, actually, ther \u2014 that were\nthere. But we knew that we were gonna get to come home pretty soon, so then I got\norders that the 80\" division was to move home on about the 29\" of December, I\nthink it was. So, we were replaced by another outfit that took over our job, and we\nthen went to LaHavre and got on a boat and came home.",
        "Q: What was that like, what was coming home like?",
        "A: Well, we got into one hell of a storm by the Azores. And the captain of the boat\nsaid, I\u2019ve been a captain of \u2014 in the navy for 31 years, and have never seen waves in\nthe English channel like this. The boat would go up and come down and hunks of\nenamel or paint would pop off of the side of the boat, like that. Guys in their bunks\n\u2014 they had bunks five high, you know, wrapped with rope and the ropes would\nactually break and the guys would fall, and everybody was seasick, my God,\neverybody was seasick. And he said, I\u2019ve never seen waves like this in my 31 years.\nAnd I thought, my God, I was in combat 210 days and I\u2019m going to go drown going\nhome. That\u2019s what I thought, I really did, but boy. But after five days it \u2014 it began to\nsmooth out. We came into New York and set outside of New York harbor for four\nhours in the dark and we couldn\u2019t figure out why. Well, they waited until daybreak\nto take us by the Statue of lemer \u2014 of Liberty. And man, everybody \u2014 everybody\nwas crying and f\u2014 happy and hollering and everything. And hello statue, and they\nall laughed, and it was \u2014 it was a very happy time. It was just wonderful. And then\nthey unloaded us at New York, took us over to Camp Kilmer and from Camp\nKilmer they took us into a big assembly hall, the first thing. When we got off of the\ntrain, we marched into there. When we got in there, on the stage was a big\nAmerican flag, and they had a \u2014 a big fan in back of that flag, and it was just a\nflopping, and they were playing the national anthem. And I can still do \u2014 I can still\nthink about that. That \u2014 that was a very emotional, it even is yet today, I\u2019m sorry.",
        "Q: What was seeing your family like, again?",
        "A: Well, my wife met me in Saint Louis. I was deployed to Saint Louis, and \u2014 to\nget discharged, and was supposed to meet her at a certain hotel. I got there, she\nwasn\u2019t there. They \u2014 for after, I\u2019d said to the clerk, and I went back about three\ndifferent times, and I said, she has to be here, because this is where we were to\nmeet. And they said, well, wait just a minute. So they went over and they looked\nthrough the thing, and they said, oh, we didn\u2019t have a room here. We had to put her\nup into a \u2014a hotel in the east \u2014 the west part of town. And so I took a taxi and went\n... and it was \u2014 it was a joy, because I hadn\u2019t seen her for two years. I hadn\u2019t really\nhad anything except just a letter, because you don\u2019t \u2014 you didn\u2019t have computers or\ncell phones, or anything like that today. I can\u2019t believe how the guys talk home\nevery day, you know? And it was \u2014 it was \u2014 we were married 70 years and I lost her\nlast year. But I have lot of wonderful, wonderful, wonderful memories.",
        "Q: Sir, this interview is for posterity. What would you most like future generations\nto know about your experiences? What would you most like them to learn?",
        "A: Never to let their damn politicians get enough power that they think that they are\nthe boss, instead of the people. And that worries me right now, because there isn\u2019t\nanyone listening to anyone in Washington. And this has to change. I talked to a lot\nof high school\u2019s history classes in Florida, I\u2019m \u2014 I happen to live in Florida. About\n\u2014 I never talked very much about my experiences until about 15 years ago, and my\ngranddaughter said, Grandpa, will you come to our history c \u2014 and tell us about\nWorld War II? I said, what can I tell you? She said, well \u2014 I said, why don\u2019t you\nhave your history teacher write me down some things that she would like for me to\ncover? So she did. And so from that, I talked to her class and told them \u2014 and then I\nopened it up and \u2014 for questions, and let them ask me questions about it. And from\nthat I started. And the year before my wife got sick, and I had to kind of quit this for\nawhile, I talked to 46 different schools in one year, about World War II, and the\nBattle of the Bulge, and this, and I bring it up to them, that if your parents aren\u2019t\nvoting, then you keep on them, and make sure that they vote for someone, and to\nstudy their \u2014 what they stand for before you let them go. And don\u2019t let them say,\nwell, I don\u2019t have time. Because they do have time, and it\u2019s their duty to you to see\nthat this country stays like it has been down through the centuries, up until this time.\nBecause this is the only country in the world like us, and we don\u2019t want it to be\nchanged. And so, I\u2019ve \u2014 I feel \u2014 and I\u2019ve been doing this now for almost 15 years,\nand Ill probably get back into it again.",
        "Q: I hope you do.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Any closing words, sir?",
        "A: No. We thank you, and I think what you have done here in this building 1s\nsomething that, it \u2014 it \u2014 1t has been needed, and the people need \u2014 more people need\nto see what happened, so that they won\u2019t let it happen here in this country, because\nit can happen. It can happen. You know, the German people, the only reason it\nhappened in Germany was because Hitler was such a charismic speaker that he\nconvinced people that he knew more than what they did, and that he was \u2014 his\ngroup of people were smarter than what they were. And that he had the answers to\nbring Germany back from 40 percent unemployment to what it was back before\nWorld War I. They fell for it. And the Senate rescinded their authority and let him\nhave a one man decision on all questions, problems and answers to what he thinks\nthat ger \u2014 is best for Germany. The first thing he did, so the people tell me, was\nafter he got this authority, was to eliminate everyone that disagreed with him, by\nbuilding up hate within the people for a specific problem that Hitler wanted to get\nrid of. That was religion, God, and his enemies. And he was successful in getting\nthe Senate to relinquish their power and to give it to him. But in the new\nconstitution of Germany, they no longer have that authority to relinquish that\npower to one person. It must stay in a vote in Germany. So I was told in Weimar\nthis time, because I ask them.",

        "Answer: I was \u2014 I was brought up on a farm, and I lived on a farm until I was 18\nyears of age, and then I began to work for Quaker Oats company, and to go to\njunior college at night. And I graduated from the junior college, and then I was\nmarried at 20 years of age. And I still worked for Quaker Oats company. And I\nstarted to work for \u2014 I started to go to business college, which Quaker Oats paid\nfor. And I graduated two years later, going to school at night, from business college.\nAnd I \u2014 my wife and I had a daughter a year and a half after we were first married.\nAnd so, the war came along. I was working at a job with Quaker, which was\nproviding food for the military. And they deferred me one time for a year, then my\nname came up again, and I s-said well, Pll probably go this time. They said no, you\nhave more important job here. And so they deferred me the second time. I was\ndowntown one day and a lady came by and she stopped me by pulling my arm. She\nsaid, are you in the military? And I said, no ma\u2019am, I work for Quaker Oats\ncompany. She said, well I have two sons and you look as healthy as they are. And I\ndon\u2019t understand why that they\u2019re in the military and you\u2019re not. And that began to\nworry me and to bear on my mind. And the next time when my deferment come up,\nthey asked me, and I said no, I don\u2019t want it. Which turned out to be a bad decision\non my part, I thought many, many times during the war.",
        "A: I entered it Saint Joseph \u2014 well, actually at Leavenworth, Kansas. I was\ninducted from Saint Joe, Missouri and went into the army in Leavenworth,\nKansas. Was transferred from Leavenworth to Camp Hood, Texas. And I was one\nof the first groups that their training period was reduced from 18 weeks to 12\nweeks. And we had 12 weeks of basic training, which really amounted to one day of\nlooking at a weapon and being told what it was, the next day you would tear that\nweapon down, clean it and put it back together many, many times. The next day you\nwould spend a half a day in a schoolroom, showing videos of how that weapon was\nused in combat. And then the next day you would go on a different weapon. And\nthat\u2019s the way it was for the 12 weeks. And you learned to ha \u2014 you hadn\u2019t night\nproblems that you would use that weapon for a half a day, and then you were on a\ndifferent type of a weapon. At the end of, really the first week that we were there\nwas just being assigned, getting our billets, getting our clothes, and everything. So\nwhen it come right down to it, you only had 10 weeks of basic training, because the\nlast week you were there, they were giving you orders to go home, and then to\nwhere you were to go from there. So you \u2014 at the time I went through, you really\nonly had 10 weeks of basic training.",
        "A: I we \u2014 I went in \u2014 in \u2014 on \u2014 on the \u2014 the first week in May, and the \u2014",
        "A: Of 1944, and I came home for 10 days furlough. Then I was sent to Fort Mead,\nMaryland and we got on a ship, the \u2014 th-the \u2014 the first part of September of 1944.\nAnd from there we went to Liverpool, England, which took us 10 days to go\nacross the ocean in a c \u2014 big convoy. And then we landed in Liverpool, we got off\nof one boat, walked down the dock, got on another boat, or ship, and went across\nthe channel. And I got off at Omaha Beach on the 27\" of September. Went up on\nthe hill at Omaha Beach, which at that time was a replacement center. They had\ntwo men tents there. And each t \u2014 and it rained every hour that we were on Omaha\nBeach, and they would tell \u2014 they told us when we were assigned to our tent, there\nis a bulletin board right down here. You look at that bulletin board at least once\nevery four hours because your name will appear and you will be deployed from here\nto some unit. We had no idea where we were going to be deployed. On the second\nafternoon, they \u2014 we went to the bulletin board, and my name and elethe \u2014 and\neleven other names were on the bulletin board, and we were told to load on a truck\nat 12 o\u2019clock and at 12 o\u2019clock we \u2014 12 of us loaded on, and there was a sergeant on\nthe truck. He says, I will be in charge of you until you reach the deployment area\nwhere you\u2019ll be assigned. Six hours later we ended up at Pont A Mousson, France\non the Moselle river. And the 80\" \u2014 and when we got there, we actually unloaded\non the west side of the river. And a first sergeant by the name of Percy Smith came\nup, and he was just a small fellow, about five foot six, smoking a big stogie. And he\nsaid, I want you fellows to know that you have just been assigned to Company G, of\n317, the fightingest damned outfit in the United States Army. Well, maybe they all\ntold us that, I don\u2019t know. But that was our approach when we first reached there.\nLined up, he got our names, our serial number, and he said, is there anyone here that\nhas ever fired a 60 millimeter mortar? And Ken Mauer(ph), who happened to have\ntaken basic training in Fort Hood with me, was in the same group that I was in,\nwhich is a miracle for two people to be, but we were replacements. At that time we\nfound out that the 80\" had taken a lot of casualties, and that they needed\nreplacements. So Percy said, you see that bunch of trees about three blocks down\nthere? We said yes. He said, there\u2019s a sergeant by the name of Fadinas(ph). You\nreport to him, and he\u2019s really gonna be glad to see you, because he lost five of his\nsquad yesterday in an artillery barrage. So, that was our re \u2014 first experience to\nbeing near combat situation. And so we were assigned to the Company G, near\nDieulouard, France on the 29\" or 30\" of September of 1944.",
        "A: July 6\", 1918.",
        "A: No \u2014so, we went down and met Fadinas(ph), reported to him. Turned out he\nwas a Russian that had come over as a teenager, to get away from the Germans.\nAnd he had gotten his citizenship by volunteering to come into the United States\nArmy when he was 18 years old. And at that time he was about 20. And so, he was\na very dedicated American soldier, but he hated the Germans with a passion,\nbecause his parents and his grandparents both had been eliminated by the SS in\nRussia.",
        "A: My first personal experience was the next day. We were to take a labor camp on\nthe east side of the Moselle river. We had then, after we landed, we went across the\nriver near Saint Genevieve. And Company G was near Saint Genevieve, France,\nand we were to take ov \u2014 a Polish labor camp that was supposed to be in some\nwoods, that were just beyond where we were. Well, as we started out, we started\nthrough these woods, and the Germans laid in an artillery barrage. And I can\nremember that Ken and I were so naive, that we were standing there and saying, oh\nlook, that artillery shell hit that tree and knocked the whole top out of it. Because\nwe'd never seen anything like that. And we were \u2014 were talking about how the\nshells were knocking the limbs off of these trees, never thinking about that we could\nget hit ourself. Well, after they k \u2014 shot about 12 shells, it seemed that the Germans\nwould traverse to another area, and our lieutenant said, c\u2019mon fellows, let\u2019s go.\nWell, we got up and we started and we walked about 50 yards. And here was the\nfellow laying on the ground with the medics, and he had the top of his helmet and\nhis head completely cut off with a piece of shrapnel. And I looked, and it was one\nof the fellows that rode up on the truck with me. Here\u2019s a guy that just got into\ncombat, didn\u2019t even have his rifle off his shoulder, and was killed before we even\ngot started. Well, the next time that shells started exploding in trees around us, Ken\nand I were the first ones to stick our heads into the roots of the trees, because we\ndidn\u2019t want that to happen to us. And it was a very vivid experience of finding out\nwhat happens in combat, in a hurry. But we took that labor camp that day, and freed\nabout 40 Polish labor \u2014 laborers out of a camp that were providing labor for an\nelectrical company in the area of Pont A Mousson.",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t. I di \u2014 at that time I was so dumb, and so naive, that we didn\u2019t know\nanything. You know, thinking back to those days, compared to the army today, we\nwere so dumb, and so naive compared to what the soldiers are today, because\nthey\u2019ve been trained, they\u2019re professionals, they know what they\u2019re doing, they\nknow what their assignments are. And we didn\u2019t even have an assignment before\nwe came up that day before. And we were mortar men, and had had two days\nexperience on a mortar before we came up to that 1 \u2014 to that day.",
        "A: No, they were \u2014 they were, as I remember, wearing very ragged clothes, dirty\nclothes. And that they were very skinny, and I would say that they were not well\ntaken care of at all.",
        "A: No, no, we didn\u2019t. I didn\u2019t.",
        "A: I was a 60 millimeter mortar man. Two days later \u2014",
        "A: Oh, okay.",
        "A: What kind \u2014 you \u2014 they were now \u2014 it was our understanding that they were\nworking an electrical plant in the area of Pont A Mousson, yeah.",
        "A: Oh, no you\u2019re dri \u2014 it \u2014 1t was one \u2014 there was no dams or anything around there,\nso it had to be some kind of a \u2014 a \u2014 like oil driven, or motor \u2014 some kind of motors.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah. So, that \u2014 that day was our experience of \u2014 of going into \u2014 to that. And so\nthen we came back to the area of Saint Genevieve, and we then were assigned, our\nnext objective was to take a village and a road junction at Sivry, which was about\n10 miles east of the area that we were at that time. Now, you understand that\ncompanies of infantrymen, one company will take an area and go forward. There\nwill be two companies that usually will go forward, and one company in reserve.\nThat next day we were in reserve. These other two companies had gone forward\nfrom Dieulouard east into France. And then we were brought up from reserve, and\nsaid your objective is to take this little village of Sivry, s-i-v-r-y, France. There is a\nroad junction there that the Ge-Germans are using that comes down from the\nmountains of s \u2014 of Saint \u2014 Saint Jane, and Saint Mihiel, and coming down and\nfurnishing supplies to the Germans up around Metz. So we want to cut that road\noff. We went into the little village of Sivry, set up our road blocks, never had a fire\n\u2014 shot fired at us. We went into this little village, dug our foxholes, set up our\ndefenses in our \u2014 our area. At midnight that night, the Germans started firing from\nthe mountains. Now, these are not peaks, these are big hills. They had set up their\nartillery and mortars on top of these two big hills that overlooked this valley, and at\nmidnight they started firing on Company G because we were the only ones in this\nvillage at that time. And there\u2019s about 75 houses and a big church in this village. By\ndaybreak there was not one building in that little village that was still standing. We\nwent in that village that day, short of our component of [indecipherable] we had\n169 men. And they shelled us every time anybody would move outside of a foxhole.\nThey let us dig in, the oth \u2014 that afternoon before, and never fired on us. But that\nnight they started firing on that field, and the village. And by the next morning, all\nthose houses were completely flat. And they kept firing all morning. The afternoon\nfog moved in, and it began to get dark about 4:30 in the afternoon and we got notice\nto pull out. Out of the 159, the daily report of Company G shows that 40 men\nwalked out, and back up over the hill that night. Now, I don\u2019t know that all of them\ngot killed. We know that about 38 of them got captured in that village, but the rest\nof them were injured, and that was \u2014 that was my first day of real combat, and you\ncan become an experienced person of combat in a very short time.",
        "A: Yes. On \u2014 we were near Saint Avold, France, near a little \u2014 in a little village\ncalled Gunwaller(ph), and we had just finished the battle of Farebersviller on\nNovember the 27\", through the 29\". And we had come up to Saint Avold, and were\nin reserve. And we were there and we notice of a m \u2014 and about nine o\u2019clock in the\nmorning, there will be trucks here at 12 o\u2019clock to load us up, because we\u2019re gonna\ntake a trip up to Luxembourg. Well, nobody knew where the heck Luxembourg\nwas. We didn\u2019t \u2014 had never heard of it even. And so we, after \u2014 on the way up there,\nwell, we got talking about it and trying to figure out what we were gonna do. We\nhad heard that the Germans had broke through up there, and that we were supposed\nto go up and support the troops that were up there. Well, it\u2019s about 125 miles from\nSaint Avold up to where we were going. And that evening, or that night, we ended\nup just east of Luxembourg city at Gonderange, between Gonderange and\nJunglinster. And the next morning we got notice, Company G was to be\ntransferred, and we got in trucks and went up over \u2014 they call them mountains, we\ncall them big hills here \u2014 they went over the big hill to Steinsul(ph), a village of\nSteinsul(ph). And from Steinsul(ph) we went to the west. He wa \u2014 he ended up in\nMersch where headquarters company, but we were west of Mersch on the\nmountain west and going down the ridge north towards Ettelbruck. And we walked\nall evening, and up to about 10 o\u2019clock at night, and we found a big barn, and it was\nsn \u2014 it was beginning to sleet. And they put us up \u2014 we all got into that barn, and\nlaid down and slept til the next morning. But we could hear gunfire during the\nnight, so we knew that we were getting close to the \u2014 the front. But it was still about\nfive miles north before we ran into any activity at all, which was just west of\nEttelbruck. And from there we went to Niederfeulen, and we were at\nNiederfeulen and then it began to snow and got cold as hell. Cold as hell. And the\nnext day would have been the 234 \u2014 well, we were in Niederfeulen a couple a\u2014a\ncouple of days, and then we were supposed to go north of Niederfeulen to\nBourscheid and Walscheid and Kehmen. And as we went up the ridge, and got\njust south of Kehmen, they opened fire on us, and we didn\u2019t realize it, but they had\na mountain to the east and north of that area, that they could see the whole area, it \u2014\nit was like open country to them, and they could see us. And that was where what\nwas called Bloody Ridge, today, yet today to the Luxembourg people, because we\nwere tied down there for two days, and took severe \u2014 317 took severe casualties all\nthat two days, because every time anybody got out of a foxhole, they would get shot\nat, because they could see them from across the valley from that mountain in the\nwoods where they had their artillery and mortars dug in. And that\u2019s what most of it\nwas, was shrapnel from artillery, and 1t would hit the frozen ground, and it would\njust skip, and hit people, if you were exposed. And from there \u2014 we were there two\ndays. They drew us back, and then we went into Hiderscheid(ph), and into \u2014 we\nwent into Hiderscheid(ph), and replaced \u2014 319 had been in, that was another\nregiment of the 80\", and they \u2014 they pulled out and moved farther west, towards\nBastogne, and we then replaced them at Hiderscheid(ph). And we got\ncounterattacked that first night, and then we were able to save that. And then our\nobjective was to go across the \u2014 it\u2019s the cliff river in that area that goes on down.\nBut from there, we were on the front side of that mountain, near Tadler and Ringel\nand all that area, for almost two weeks, right in that area, because they were across\nthe valley firing back at us, and hell, we couldn\u2019t move. We \u2014 every time we \u2014 we\nwould move \u2014 plus the fact that supplies, we didn\u2019t have supplies, and then on the\n21% of January, we had \u2014 our objective was to start from Ringel to go down the\nvalley and up over the mountain to Bourscheid, and to help to take Bourscheid. I\nwas in what was called the weapons platoon, the fourth platoon, and I had 26 men\nthat morning. And Captain Namkowitz(ph), who was the company commander\nsaid, Myers, take your men and \u2014 and \u2014 and along with Heizer(ph) and his machine\ngun, you fellows walk up the \u2014 the fire alley in the forest, because, he said, you can\ncarry your weapons, we don\u2019t need you til you get to the top. Well, we didn\u2019t know\nit, but they had an 88 dug in up at the top, and there was 15 to 18 inches of snow on\nthe ground, and it was 18 below zero that morning, and \u2014 or that afternoon. As we\nwalked up the hill \u2014 now, out of my squad that \u2014 that day, of 12 men, I had nine\nmen that had just come up, because they were new replacements, just \u2014 and I \u2014 I\nwas an old man then, because I\u2019d had from October, November, December, so I had\n90 days of experience of \u2014 of that. I was 26 years old, and everybody wanted to get\ninto my squad because I was the oldest man there. And they thought that because I\nwas older that I was \u2014 I was \u2014 maybe could keep them safe. Well, tha-that didn\u2019t ha\n\u2014 that wasn\u2019t the way it was in combat. You just were lucky wherever you were.\nBut anyway, I had young men, inexperienced, and as the 88 started firing down the\nfirepath at us, they started running. We kept hollering, drop in the snow, drop in the\nsnow. Well, they didn't do it. They ran to get into the trees. And the Germans had\nwire traps all up the hill, with bouncing Betty booby traps that were half gallon\nbucket size, s-syrup bucket size, that would jump 40 inches in the air and explode,\nand they were filled with shrapnel. And they were devastating. Well, when we\nstarted to run, Heizer(ph) and I hit the ground in the center of the firepath, in the\nsnow. They were running, they hit these, and out of the 26 men, 22 of them got \u2014\nwere casualties. And that afternoon, that \u2014 after that afternoon, four o\u2019clock they\ncalled off the \u2014 the advance. About the fi \u2014 si \u2014 third or fourth shell that that 88\nfired, tanks started firing at that 88 and finally knocked it out. But that was \u2014 we\nonly had about four or five shells from that 88, and that was all because they\nknocked it out. But that evening, there were so many casualties in G Company, that\nthat evening, not only in G Company, but in the second battalion going up that hill,\nthat when they called it off, they\u2019ve all had \u2014 called for volunteers of 22 men from\nthe company, and two officers to carry the casualties to \u2014 back towards Ringel, so\nthey could be put in trucks and into ambulances to be taken back to the first aid.\nAnd that day, after that day, gi\u2014 G Company had less than 50 men in \u2014 in it that\nday, and we were attached then for three more days to another company, because\nwe were declared inoperative. So, until we could get more replacements up, why,\nwe were attached to another company and that \u2014 that was one day that you don\u2019t\nforget.",
        "A: Well, I went to Captain Namkowitz(ph), and I said, Captain, I had \u2014 by that time\nI had a squad of six men, myself, and then the other sergeant, Sergeant\nMagarlick(ph) had six men. We had lost so many men I went to Captain\nNamkowitz(ph) and I said, I think that I\u2019m bad luck, and that I hadn\u2019t b \u2014 outta be a\nsquad leader. He said, Myers, he said, it\u2019s not your fault. He said, work with me.\nHe said, you\u2019ve got more experience than anybody else around here now. He said,\ndon\u2019t do this to me. And so that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s the only reason I stayed, was because he \u2014\nhe asked me to, and he talked me out of it, because I really felt that I was bad luck.",
        "A: No, not in that area.",
        "A: The first experience, of course, was \u2014 was, for me was not until we got clear to\nboo \u2014 to Weimar.",
        "A: And that was April the 12\", the morning of April \u2014 when \u2014 when Company G,\nand the 80\" division came up to Weimar, and the 319\" came to Weimar and they\nsent a message to the mayor of Weimar, surrender the city, or we will attack it with\ntanks and artillery.",
        "A: No, 319 was another \u2014 was another regiment of the 80\" division.",
        "A: It was infantry. And they came up and all of us, each regiment had an armored\nunit attached to it, like the 307. Three \u2014 307 tank battalion was attached to the\nsecond battalion of 317. But three wee \u2014 actually, 317 as we came \u2014 we had been in\nErfurt for three days fighting. And then we started and came to Weimar, and it\u2019s\nonly 10 miles to Weimar from Erfurt. And when we got to Erfurt, why 319 was\nahead of us, and 317 was in reserve. They call it reserve, we were held \u2014 we were\nall like a mile back of them, so that if they got in trouble, why we could be deployed\nup to help them. But we stopped and we sat there for \u2014 for quite a \u2014 for about three\nor four hours. And finally, why they gave the message to the mayor to surrender the\ncity, and he and a lady on a bicycle came out with a white flag, and they\nsurrendered the city. So, 319 went around the city, 317, with the second battalion,\ncame into Weimar and we were the only ones that was in Weimar from the 80\"\ndivision actually, because 319 skirted it and went around, and 318 followed them.\n317 was left in reserve so that we could \u2014 our \u2014 ou-our assignment was to do police\nwork and keep control of the city. And that\u2019s what we did. 317, the three \u2014 the\nsecond battalion walked right down the main street from the west, into Weimar. As\nwe walked down the street, we were on both sides of the street, about five, 10 yards\napart, each one of us, as we got downtown, the civilians that were on the street as\nwe walked by, would turn their back to us and face the walls of the stores, and\nwouldn\u2019t look at us. Wouldn\u2019t look at us at all. But the kids, the kids would run out\nand say, have you got any gumy(ph), gumy(ph), gumy(ph) chocolate. And so they\nwere just like kids back home. And when we got downtown, to Weimar, we went\ndown to the plaza that is right in the center of town by the city hall, and company G,\nCaptain Namkowitz(ph) set his headquarters up in a building right down on the \u2014\non the square. So he signed all the different ones. I had to s-set up on a street with\nmy mortars, near the railroad station, so that I could see down the railroad tracks, in\ncase that a train come, or something like that. So, we were there. We kept seeing\nthese people who were in striped suits. Not many, but we would see them once in\nawhile, walk by. Finally Captain Namkowitz(ph) told Percy Smith, who was the\nfirst sergeant of G Company, he said, Percy, he says, you take down Smith the\nJeep driver in a Jeep and get Myers, and you guys go see if you can find out where\nthe hell these guys are coming from. He said, wa \u2014 where are they coming from? He\nsaid, we\u2019d see \u2014 they must be a \u2014 a prison, or a jail around here that they\u2019re getting\nout of. So, we started, and we asked four different civilians, where are these\nprisoners? Nix(ph), nixt(ph), we don\u2019t know, we don\u2019t know. They didn\u2019t know\nwhere they were coming from. Well, we went down to the railroad st \u2014 track, or\ndown by the station and saw two boys that were about 10 - 12 years old. Percy\ncould speak a little bit of German, and Percy got out of the Jeep and he went over\nto these boys, he said, where are these prisoners coming from? And they said, oh,\nway out on the hill, way up on a hill, way out in the country. So, we started to drive\nout in that direction. We drove for about four miles, and we thi \u2014 and we got to\ntalking, we said, you know, those damn kids, they \u2014 they\u2019ve given us bad direction,\nthere can\u2019t be anything out here, and we still didn\u2019t see it. But we were on a\ncountry, a dirt road that had been traveled a lot. So, Don said, well, we\u2019ll just follow\nthis up around the hill. So we went up around the hill, and then right at the top of\nthis hill, here was a 10 foot wire fence. Guys were just leaning against it, just\nlooking. We drove up to the gate, and we didn\u2019t know what it was. We saw all these\nbuildings. Now, at the wi \u2014 at that time, we didn\u2019t realize that we were at the back\ngate of Buchenwald, which was down by where the museum is now. But there was\na fence all around that area on the west side of the camp, and we came up on the\nwest side of the camp. And Percy got out and he asked the guy, he said, what is this\nplace, anyway? And the guy says, ein minute, ein minute. He goes into a barracks\nand comes out with a little fellow that was five foot six. Skinny? God, he didn\u2019t\nweigh 70 pounds, he didn\u2019t weigh 60 pounds. He said, my name 1s so and so, and I\nam from Lithuania. He said, I\u2019ve been in this camp for four years. He could speak\nEnglish, very good English. He said, I been in this camp for four years, and he said,\nthis is Buchenwald work camp. Percy said, work camp, what the hell is a work\ncamp? He said, well, we furnish \u2014 he said, they come here and this 1s a big camp.\nHe said, there\u2019s other little camps all around, at the industries and out 1n the farms,\nthat furnish labor from here. And he said \u2014 Percy said, well, who\u2019s in charge here?\nHe said, well, the SSers were until last night, and they heard that you were headed\nthis way, and, he said, they ran. He said, there was about 3,000 of them here. We\nsaid, 3,000? And he said yes, he said, there was approximately 3,000 here before\nyou came here. He said, how many people are in this camp, anyway? Well, we\ncould see \u2014 now, where we came in, there were low one, just one story buildings\nthat looked like they had been put up in a hurry. They had just \u2014 I don\u2019t know\nwhether it was straw board, or what, but it wasn\u2019t \u2014 it \u2014 1t was \u2014 looked like\ntemporary buildings. And so he said, this camp here, is \u2014 is the west part \u2014 he said,\nthe main gate is over there. Well, we didn\u2019t know that there was a name \u2014 main\ngate. And later on, we found out that other people from 317 had come in on the\nfront side of the gate. But he said, there was some guys here yesterday in a\nmotorized vehicle, kind of like a tank, but he said, they didn\u2019t even come in. They\njust were here for a short time, and he said, they left. And we said, well, what did\nyou have to \u2014 what are you eating? And he said, well, he said, the SSers had some\npotato peelings that they had peeled yesterday and threw in the dump, and he said,\nwe got them and washed them, and then, he said, we went over there and got green\ngrass and brought over and put in with that, and he said, that\u2019s all we\u2019ve had to eat\ntoday. So, we went inside the camp, just to the first row of buildings, and in front of\nthe barracks, they had people laying out, and Percy says, what happened to them?\nOh, they just died. They just died. And about that time, here come six guys pulling a\ntwo wheel cart up from around the corner, down below. And they were picking\nthese dead guys up and putting them on this two wheel cart. And I don\u2019t know what\nthey were doing with them when they got them, you know. But Percy said, well, I\ndon\u2019t remember was Percy, me or Don said, what do they do with them? Well, he\nsays, they have a cremator \u2014 had \u2014 they have an oven up there. An oven? Yeah, he\nsaid, they burn them. He said, they burn the bodies. Well, come find out they had\ntwo crematories there with four ovens in each building, and they worked them 24\nhours a day, seven days a week. And \u2014 so Percy said, how many people are here?\nHe said, well, we think there is about 26,000 here now. And Percy said, who\u2019s in\ncharge? Well, we have a committee that\u2019s in charge, but, he said, really nobody\u2019s in\ncharge. He said, a bunch of them took off after the SSers. He said, they broke into\nthe armament, and they are after the SSers now. And he said, we\u2019ve got ninet \u2014 now\nI\u2019m \u2014I-\u2014I might be wrong, but he said \u2014 I think that he said, we have 19 of them\nlocked up on the other side in a building. And so Percy and I and Don went back to\ntown and Captain Namkowitz(ph), we told him what we\u2019d found. He said, well,\nI\u2019m going to call division and tell them what\u2019s there. So they said, well, we\u2019ll have\nsome trucks with some food and blankets and medicine up there tomorrow. So, I\nwas assigned with my five man \u2014 six man, I was assigned from the 13\", the 14\" and\nup until about noon on the 15\" to go around and pick up these guys that were in \u2014 s-\nstraggling in town, and to take them back out to camp for \u2014 so that they could get\nmedicine. And some of the fellows didn\u2019t want to go back out to camp. But we told\nthem that they were gonna be food out there, the best we could. Tried to tell them,\nbut we had one fellow that was at the edge of town, and he came out of a house\neating a potato that must have weighed a pound. And he was just eating that thing\njust like 1t was a candy bar. He walked out to \u2014 almost to where our je \u2014 truck was \u2014\nJeep, and he fell over. Well, we picked him up, put him in the Jeep and took him\nback out to the camp, and Dr. Bob out there, he was our battalion medic, he was out\nthere and by that time they had set up some medics also that had got there. And he\nsaid, this poor guy, he didn\u2019t weigh 60 pounds. He said, this poor guy was e \u2014 we\ntold him what happened, and he said, well, probably the starch in the potato was just\ntoo much for his system and he just can\u2019t handle it, he just couldn't handle it. So, on\nthe 15\", then, I was r \u2014 they \u2014 I was relieved by \u2014 now, I \u2014 I think it was people \u2014\nfellows from a cavalry that replaced us, but by that time then, our headquarter, our\ncompany headquarters had moved, and we went to Gina(ph). Gina(ph) was east of\nthere, and so we went to Gina(ph) from \u2014 from there.",
        "A: It da\u2014 da\u2014Iha-\u2014I?d\u2014Ihonestly don\u2019t know, because I didn\u2019t go into the camp\nto see, but I would assume, I would assume that it was probably K ra \u2014 K rations or\nsomething like that, the f\u2014 on that first truck.",
        "A: I would say th \u2014 probably th \u2014 30 minutes maybe. Maybe 30 minutes that we\ntook and saw what was happening and everything. The guys never \u2014 they just\nlooked by us when we were in there. Now, some of them, four or five trailed along\nwith us, as we were walking in there. But other than that, they were so sick. And I\ndidn\u2019t realize it until this year, when we were in Weimar and was talking to fellows\nthat were in the camp, that the backside of Buchenwald was called the death camp.\nThat when they had people that were so sick and so emancipated that they thought\nthey were gonna die, they would bring them back to that part of the camp and \u2014 and\nput them there. They asked me in the evening if I would tell about finding the camp\nand what I had seen and such as this. One fellow, afterwards he said, he was in the\ncr \u2014 in the group, and he held his hand up, and I said, yes, sir? He said, what you\nhave just said, I can verify every word, because, he said, I was a 16 year old Jewish\nboy that had typhus fever, that they had put me into the death camp. I said, what do\nyou mean death camp? He said, that\u2019s what that part of the camp was called. If they\nexpected you to die in the next four or five days. And he said, I was destined to be\neliminated in four or five days, but you guys came along, and saved my life. And I\nsaid no, the SSers were gone. We didn\u2019t save you, we \u2014 we just happened to come\nup there. He said no, they knew that you were coming and they left. So, he said, I\nwant to come up and shake your hand. And he did, and he started crying, and so did\nI. And so, he said, my name is \u2014 my name is Klein. He said, I have been an\nAmerican citizen for over 45 years and I\u2019m ar \u2014 a\u2014a Jewish rabbi in California. |\nhave his picture with his wife and his son, that had been invited to come back to\nWeimar as one of the former prisoners. And he said, I just want to thank you,\nbecause you saved my life. And I said, no, we didn\u2019t. But, I said \u2014 he said, well, as\nfar as I\u2019m concerned, you did, because the next day I was in a hospital in Gina(ph),\nand two days after that, I was in England, and he said, then I was sent to the United\nStates to completely recover, and that\u2019s where I\u2019ve stayed.",
        "A: Now, they told us that there were subcamps all around, that they furnished labor\nout of there. Now, part of our 319 came by a camp called Orndorf(ph), which was\nto the west of there. And this year we went back to Orndorf(ph) and course all it is\nthere is the same way at \u2014 at Buchenwald, is just where the buildings were, and a\nmonument that they have there in a couple places. But at that time, it was a hellhole,\nbecause they didn\u2019t treat them as nice as they treated them even in Buchenwald,\nwhich it was horrible.",
        "A: Well, 1t made me realize why that we were fighting. That \u2014 that solidified why\nwe were over there.",
        "A: Not really, not really. Because I didn\u2019t \u2014 w-we were in the infantry in the line\ncompanies, and we weren\u2019t in headquarters and such as that. So, w-we only got\nbuildings that had been assigned to us. We weren\u2019t in the job of taking buildings, or\ntaking \u2014 making our own assignments. But I would say that this time, at the\nbanquet, the prime minister of [indecipherable] looked at we five guys that were\nthere, and he sa \u2014 when he started talking, he said, I want to thank you for freeing\nthe German people from the tyranny of the Nazi political regime, because he said,\nwe were prisoners and didn\u2019t realize it as well as these people here at Buchenwald\nwere. And I thought that was quite a statement. And \u2014 but it proves what can\nhappen to politicians when they get too much power.",
        "A: Well, this took us by surprise, because we had heard of concentration camps, but\nwe didn\u2019t really know what they were. We hadn\u2019t seen any \u2014 I hadn\u2019t seen any\npictures of any, and I didn\u2019t know that they were as big as what Buchenwald was,\ndamn, that covered 400 acres. And the \u2014 the buildings that were there, there were\nthree story buildings, there were two story buildings, and then there were a lot of\nthese pre \u2014 kind of prefab buildings around the west side, the edge there, where we\ncame up. And that, I couldn\u2019t \u2014 \u2019'd \u2014 I was amazed, really, because I\u2019d \u2014 I didn\u2019t\nrealize that \u2014 that the labor camp, what the heck they were doing with that many\npeople for a labor camp, you know\u201d?",
        "A: In Germany, I stayed. I\u2014I\u2014I didn\u2019t come home until the 16\" of January of\n1946. After the war, or at the end of the \u2014 after the war was over, Percy Smith got\nto come home because he had enough points, and I took over as first sergeant of G\nCompany, and I was acting gi \u2014 first sergeant for almost five months. And so, from\n\u2014 we were at Shpital(ph) on the Russian line, and we were \u2014 we furnished guard\nduty fo \u2014 at [indecipherable] Goering and Hitler and all had the paintings and all\nof the beautiful things, artwork that was done, but I never got to go inside until 25\nyears after that, the wife and I went back and I got to go inside of the\nNeuschwateine(ph) castle there. And that was first time. I was on guard duty\noutside for almost a month, but I didn\u2019t get inside. But I did then, but \u2014",
        "A: Well, yes, because I gave them to myself. At the \u2014 we were \u2014 we were in\nBavaria up until November, then we went to Czechoslovakia when they had an\nelection of \u2014 in Czechoslovakia. Then we came back to Schongau, and at\nSchongau we were there probably \u2014 I said November, it was October when we\nwent to \u2014 to czechosl \u2014 or to \u2014 yeah, Czechoslovakia. And then we came back\nSchongau for a month, then we went to Aufschaffensburg(ph), Germany, which\nat that time was a deployment point. And our job was that they would send in G.L.s\nfrom all over Europe into Aufschaffensburg(ph) and each morning I would get\norders \u2014 well, when they would come in, I would get their orders, that they would \u2014\nthe name, and how many points they had, and their number. And then I would get\neach morning, an order, today you have to ship out so many people to f\u2014 to go\nhome, but they have to have so many points. So I would go through the rosters, and\npick out the \u2014 the rest of the guys were doing nothing, actually, ther \u2014 that were\nthere. But we knew that we were gonna get to come home pretty soon, so then I got\norders that the 80\" division was to move home on about the 29\" of December, I\nthink it was. So, we were replaced by another outfit that took over our job, and we\nthen went to LaHavre and got on a boat and came home.",
        "A: Well, we got into one hell of a storm by the Azores. And the captain of the boat\nsaid, I\u2019ve been a captain of \u2014 in the navy for 31 years, and have never seen waves in\nthe English channel like this. The boat would go up and come down and hunks of\nenamel or paint would pop off of the side of the boat, like that. Guys in their bunks\n\u2014 they had bunks five high, you know, wrapped with rope and the ropes would\nactually break and the guys would fall, and everybody was seasick, my God,\neverybody was seasick. And he said, I\u2019ve never seen waves like this in my 31 years.\nAnd I thought, my God, I was in combat 210 days and I\u2019m going to go drown going\nhome. That\u2019s what I thought, I really did, but boy. But after five days it \u2014 it began to\nsmooth out. We came into New York and set outside of New York harbor for four\nhours in the dark and we couldn\u2019t figure out why. Well, they waited until daybreak\nto take us by the Statue of lemer \u2014 of Liberty. And man, everybody \u2014 everybody\nwas crying and f\u2014 happy and hollering and everything. And hello statue, and they\nall laughed, and it was \u2014 it was a very happy time. It was just wonderful. And then\nthey unloaded us at New York, took us over to Camp Kilmer and from Camp\nKilmer they took us into a big assembly hall, the first thing. When we got off of the\ntrain, we marched into there. When we got in there, on the stage was a big\nAmerican flag, and they had a \u2014 a big fan in back of that flag, and it was just a\nflopping, and they were playing the national anthem. And I can still do \u2014 I can still\nthink about that. That \u2014 that was a very emotional, it even is yet today, I\u2019m sorry.",
        "A: Well, my wife met me in Saint Louis. I was deployed to Saint Louis, and \u2014 to\nget discharged, and was supposed to meet her at a certain hotel. I got there, she\nwasn\u2019t there. They \u2014 for after, I\u2019d said to the clerk, and I went back about three\ndifferent times, and I said, she has to be here, because this is where we were to\nmeet. And they said, well, wait just a minute. So they went over and they looked\nthrough the thing, and they said, oh, we didn\u2019t have a room here. We had to put her\nup into a \u2014a hotel in the east \u2014 the west part of town. And so I took a taxi and went\n... and it was \u2014 it was a joy, because I hadn\u2019t seen her for two years. I hadn\u2019t really\nhad anything except just a letter, because you don\u2019t \u2014 you didn\u2019t have computers or\ncell phones, or anything like that today. I can\u2019t believe how the guys talk home\nevery day, you know? And it was \u2014 it was \u2014 we were married 70 years and I lost her\nlast year. But I have lot of wonderful, wonderful, wonderful memories.",
        "A: Never to let their damn politicians get enough power that they think that they are\nthe boss, instead of the people. And that worries me right now, because there isn\u2019t\nanyone listening to anyone in Washington. And this has to change. I talked to a lot\nof high school\u2019s history classes in Florida, I\u2019m \u2014 I happen to live in Florida. About\n\u2014 I never talked very much about my experiences until about 15 years ago, and my\ngranddaughter said, Grandpa, will you come to our history c \u2014 and tell us about\nWorld War II? I said, what can I tell you? She said, well \u2014 I said, why don\u2019t you\nhave your history teacher write me down some things that she would like for me to\ncover? So she did. And so from that, I talked to her class and told them \u2014 and then I\nopened it up and \u2014 for questions, and let them ask me questions about it. And from\nthat I started. And the year before my wife got sick, and I had to kind of quit this for\nawhile, I talked to 46 different schools in one year, about World War II, and the\nBattle of the Bulge, and this, and I bring it up to them, that if your parents aren\u2019t\nvoting, then you keep on them, and make sure that they vote for someone, and to\nstudy their \u2014 what they stand for before you let them go. And don\u2019t let them say,\nwell, I don\u2019t have time. Because they do have time, and it\u2019s their duty to you to see\nthat this country stays like it has been down through the centuries, up until this time.\nBecause this is the only country in the world like us, and we don\u2019t want it to be\nchanged. And so, I\u2019ve \u2014 I feel \u2014 and I\u2019ve been doing this now for almost 15 years,\nand Ill probably get back into it again.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: No. We thank you, and I think what you have done here in this building 1s\nsomething that, it \u2014 it \u2014 1t has been needed, and the people need \u2014 more people need\nto see what happened, so that they won\u2019t let it happen here in this country, because\nit can happen. It can happen. You know, the German people, the only reason it\nhappened in Germany was because Hitler was such a charismic speaker that he\nconvinced people that he knew more than what they did, and that he was \u2014 his\ngroup of people were smarter than what they were. And that he had the answers to\nbring Germany back from 40 percent unemployment to what it was back before\nWorld War I. They fell for it. And the Senate rescinded their authority and let him\nhave a one man decision on all questions, problems and answers to what he thinks\nthat ger \u2014 is best for Germany. The first thing he did, so the people tell me, was\nafter he got this authority, was to eliminate everyone that disagreed with him, by\nbuilding up hate within the people for a specific problem that Hitler wanted to get\nrid of. That was religion, God, and his enemies. And he was successful in getting\nthe Senate to relinquish their power and to give it to him. But in the new\nconstitution of Germany, they no longer have that authority to relinquish that\npower to one person. It must stay in a vote in Germany. So I was told in Weimar\nthis time, because I ask them.",
