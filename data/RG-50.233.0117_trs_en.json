These letters,\nI\u2019ve heard it about these postcards. That was the only thing what we knew. Later, in\nAuschwitz, I heard --.",
        "Q: Talk about leaving your building.",
        "A: Then, it was just before the birthday of my mother. It was the 28\" of June that, do you know\nwhat this Hungarian junta (??) mean, have you ever heard it?",
        "Q: Hungarian --?",
        "A: Hungarian junta. Before every Jewish holiday, before every marked house was standing a\ngendarme that you couldn\u2019t leave and nobody could enter the house. Three days they were\nstanding there in the streets of and after --. We told that we should prepare for leaving\nthe house and we can take with us only a very few things. Some clothing and nothing special,\nno jewel, no food.",
        "Q: No food?",
        "A: Very, very -- just a small something to eat but not too much. After three days we had to leave;\nwe had to leave, we had to go. They collected all the Jewish people from Ujpest and from the\nsuburbs of Budapest because Budapest was encountered with small suburbs. They took all the\nJews from the suburbs. All the Jews were collected in a brick factory just outside of Budapest or\nvery close to Budapest. Budakalow. That\u2019s the name of the village. It belongs to Budapest\nnow. No, it exists even today. Everybody was collected in this brick factory.",
        "Q: How were you taken there? Were you driven in trucks?",

        "Q: Did you walk there?",
        "A: Walked. We saw the luggages through the whole town. It is a very long road which was called\nafter the war, Marketopoola because of this march. As I know the Hungarian people, they\nchanged it.",
        "Q: How long was it? A kilometer or --?",
        "A: Something like that. The street of the Marchers.",
        "Q: So your family was still all together. All four of you were still all together?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Your father had not; he was too old for forced labor, or --?",
        "A: He was not too old but he was exempt. He got an exemption because Hungary had, not Ujpest\nhad, the chief physician of the town who was responsible for the town, he was a very good man\nand a leftist. He told that every pharmacist must be exempt. So my father came back from the\nlabor camp. Because the pharmacy must be open, he told that, become , the\npharmacist.",
        "Q: How long was he in the labor camp?",
        "A: Maybe six weeks.",
        "Q: Do you know the name of the camp that he went to or where it was at?",
        "A: It was just very close to the town, very close to Ujpest and to Budapest. Never mind. I don\u2019t\nremember.",
        "Q: What did he do there?",
        "A: Nothing. It was just a camp for collecting people.",
        "Q: He didn\u2019t work?",

        "A: In 1940. No, later, later. That was later. It was 1941 or something like that. Then he was\nexempt.",
        "Q: Did your mother run the pharmacy while he was gone?",
        "A: No, no. We had help in the pharmacy. My mother couldn\u2019t run a pharmacy because she had no\ndegree. We had somebody, an employee. Later this employee had to go to the army and then\nfather was alone.",
        "Q: So, you\u2019re going to the railroad station to go to the brickyard?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: How long were you on this train?",
        "A: That was only some hours. That was very close to Budapest. It takes twenty minutes to go\nthere. We were several hours there but it is so close to Budapest. Then we went there and we\nstayed there for a week. That was the hell of everything, this brick factory, because we were in\nthe open air, nothing was there, no facilities, nothing. One or two wells for water, that was\ndrinking water and everything. You couldn\u2019t wash yourself, you had to sleep on the earth. If\nyou had some blanket, then you were lucky. As I remember, we had some blankets but it was\nsummer and it was no rain, but that was the hell of everything. Then they started to make the\nconvoys, or how to call it, the groups to Auschwitz. The Germans came --.",
        "Q: They were Germans?",
        "A: They were Germans, together with the Hungarians. Germans.",
        "Q: The SS?",
        "A: Yes, I think so. Then they put people in these wagons.",
        "Q: Were you and all your family still together?",
        "A: Yes, yes. We were in the last group who left this and it was the last transport. We lasted three\nor four days. This one bucket, it was two buckets. One bucket for water, one bucket for the\n. You could empty maybe two or three times, these buckets; we were all cramped in. As\nit was the last transport, 1t was not so crowded, these wagons, as usual, because there were not\nso many people -- already dead. We were only 70 or 80, not more but that was much too. I\nremember that my father told me during the first night, we were sitting so, that I never thought\nthat your first journey abroad will be like this. Because that was my first journey abroad. I was\nin my twenties.",
        "Q: Were you all still well when you were on the cars or were you sick or were you still well?",
        "A: No, I was still well.",
        "Q: And your parents were still well?",
        "A: Yes, everybody was.",
        "Q: You had some food to eat?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember. Maybe we had something to eat. I remember that we got something to eat\nthrough this week; that a neighbor brought us something to eat. From Budapest, somebody\nbrought some food for us.",
        "Q: Really, to the brickyard?",
        "A: To the brickyard. He was not allowed to come in but somehow he got in.",
        "Q: A Christian?",
        "A: A Christian, yes. For us and for the Reyicherds. We were together with this family, a friend of\nmy brother and with his parents until Auschwitz. But his parents were older, more older; he\nwas a late child. They were sick people; they were fat and sick. They never entered the camp.\nHe entered so they were, you know how it was.",
        "Q: Do you want to talk any more about the train or --?",
        "A: The train was awful, as I told you. Maybe, even at Kasha. Of course, at that time it was\nHungary but after the First World, 1t was Slovakia and it is Slovakia even today. A Hungarian\ngendarme came to the wagon and told we should give everything we have then, I think it was a\nprivate business that we should give everything which we have from Ladaad or if we have\nanything, water, somebody had nothing. Anyhow, the German will take everything from us and\nwe should give it to him. That was the last Hungarian I have spoken with.",
        "Q: Did you give him anything?",
        "A: No, we had nothing.",
        "Q: Where did you get the photos? How did you save the photos?",
        "A: From friends or from relatives. It was not with us -- I got it from relatives.",
        "Q: You had nothing with you?",
        "A: Nothing with us. We had some baskets with us. Everybody had a small luggage. Nothing\ninteresting.",
        "Q: No books or --?",
        "A: No. They didn\u2019t allow to take. In this apartment in Ujpest, they checked everything what you\ntake. Ifit was a better thing, or something, you are just not allowed to take it with you.",
        "Q: So you arrived at Auschwitz. Did you know you were in Auschwitz?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Was there a sign or anything?",
        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t know where you were when you stopped?",
        "A: No, no. We learned it very soon where we are. But the name didn\u2019t tell us anything yet.\nBecause Jewish people were working at the train as well. Then it was this selection. My whole\nfamily went into the -- father, brother were together and I was together with my mother. We\nentered camp.",
        "Q: None of you were selected out?",
        "A: We were not selected out.",
        "Q: But there were a lot of people, the older ones and the babies were immediately selected. They\nnever entered the camp?",
        "A: They never entered. I have to tell you that was my first, that is even today, one of my worst\nmemories. That we were all already -- Everybody had to bathe, to take a bath, that it was worth\nthat or it was the gas. Everybody had to take everything off and even the hair was cut. We\nwere already without anything. Then the German people were there; they realized that there\nwas a girl with an orthopedic shoe. So one leg was shorter than the other. They took and they\nrealized when she was naked. They took the naked girl out and took her away, naked as she\nwas, because of the foot. Now, I know, later I know that she was taken to the other room to be\nkilled. Because they realized that only when she was naked.",
        "Q: Did you know this girl?",
        "A: No, no. Only I remember the whole story. I have seen the whole story. At that time, I didn\u2019t\nunderstand, of course, what was happening. But I have the whole picture in my eyes. She was\ntaken naked and killed.",
        "Q: She was, how old?",
        "A: Eighteen. A nice young girl. At that time, I used to have very beautiful hair. It was more light\nthan now; it was a very nice color. Now, it is getting dark with age but you saw ---. It was fair\nand a bit reddish. My mother was very proud of it and when they cut my hair, she just thought,\noh your beautiful hair! I remember. Then we entered this thing and then we met the girls from\nCzechoslovakia who were there already three years. Only a few of them remained alive after\nthree years and they were the kapos, not kapo, lageraltester. They were who ruled the barrack.\nLageraltester that was the end of the whole lager.",
        "Q: They were Jewish?",
        "A: They were Jewish. Every barrack had a head. Lageraltester, that was the German name. They\nwere these Czechoslovakian girls. They were telling us just at the beginning, do you see the\nsmoke there? That is your relatives, your parents. I didn\u2019t want to believe it. I was a humanist\nlike my father. I remembered that we had a dead person in our wagon already when we arrived\nto Auschwitz. I told my mother, they are so, I\u2019m sure many people were dead during this long\njourney. Therefore the crematorium is running because they have to get rid of the dead people.\nI didn\u2019t believe that they were killing the people. But later on, very soon, I knew they were\nright.",
        "Q: Your father and brother had gone into a different part of the camp?",
        "A: Yes, because men were separated and women were separated. So I was together with my\nmother.",
        "Q: Did you see your brother and father again?",
        "A: I have seen my father once with some others. What we did with this lager where we go. That\nwas, in Birkenau, Auschwitz is the main lager and we can now six kilometers away. When the\nHungarian people came, these last transports of this brick factory, it was called the\nsigamnalaager, gypsy lager. The number of the lager was called 32C. Later, I learned that the\ngypsy people were living there with family. It was a family lager. They killed them before the\nHungarian Jews were brought there because they needed the place. Very few gypsies who were\nin Auschwitz survived Auschwitz. Most of them were killed at that time. We came there and\nthe second day or the third day, we were newcomers. We were very stupid. We didn\u2019t know the\nregulations. For instance, we got some bread. Then people were coming and telling if you give\nme a piece of bread, I give you this pot and you can eat from this pot. One of my friends\nbought a pot to have a pot from barrack. Later on came, not the Germans, Port, \u2018toot\u2019 and then\ncame another one and took it away because it was not allowed to have the pot. The pots were\ndistributed before getting the food and then it was collected again. You couldn\u2019t own a pot and\nthe people who sold the pot for bread knew it but she was hungry. Morika, that was Morika.\nWe were stupid and I don\u2019t know, somehow, they arranged a transport from Yangers and we\nwere standing there and one person was missing. I think one person was running away from\nthis transport and they needed somebody. We were standing there with mother and they just\ntook me and pushed me in this transport and we were separated. If I were not so stupid, some\ndays later, I would run away again but I didn\u2019t run away. That was the transport, I was\nseparated from mother. Then they took us to the next lager, took we to be which had only the\nwire, which was separated with this electrical wire from the other one where mother remained.\nI was there. I sleep and I heard they wanted to send for work, these transports. But it turned out\nthat somebody had scarlet. Scarlet fever from these transports. So they stopped all the\ntransports and we had to remain there. So mother was here and I was there. I could speak to\nher. It was not so easy but I have spoken to her every day, but in the very early morning\nbecause there were these towers in Auschwitz and in every tower was a German, an SS. If he\nthought that at the wire, there are too many people, he shot. I have seen with my eyes two girls\nwho were shot. One was speaking with her sister who was on the other side and one was\nspeaking with her mother. I have seen two girls who were shot.",
        "Q: It was risky?",
        "A: It was risky. So I told mother, I will come only in the very early morning when he 1s still\nsleeping and not awake. We spoke every day. Inthis _, to me it was better because this was\npeople whom they wanted to go to work. The circumstances were better here than with mother\nand I had more to eat and I could give to mother something to eat.",
        "Q: What was your mother doing?",
        "A: Nothing, very few people were working. We didn\u2019t work either in this other. There were very\nfew kommandos, that was the name of it, who were working. They were kommandos who\nmade the cleaning. They were big barracks as restrooms. I don\u2019t know how sees that,\nnot sees, look, pause. Clean the lageraltster, the roarinder, yes, to take the garbage. These were\nchariots, wagons pulled by people.",
        "Q: Oh, carts.",
        "A: Yes, carts pulled by people. These people worked, there were very few Ausen, it was called\nAusenkommando who went out of the lager to work but it was very, very few relatively. The\nmost did in Auschwitz, it was a fam , It was a killer. That they killed the people. In those\nlager, there was no --, nothing just to stay --. What is oppel what is oppel?, you know what is\noppel? Have you ever heard of ---?",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: They can eat twice a day, everybody. You had to stay there hours and hours until they finished\nit. That was twice a day and then nothing. They give food to us and that was ---. I asked the\nbroker , the head of the block realized --. We discussed with father that maybe we can get\ntogether before Auschwitz. If they ask what is my profession, I should answer that I am a\nstudent of pharmacy. Because I knew --.",
        "Q: Your father told you to say that?",
        "A: Yes, yes. That will be in that time that he will tell you that pharmacist, that maybe we can get\nfood together. That was the main idea.",
        "Q: You were very close to your father?",
        "A: Not -- the family could sort of -- that was a big hope of my father -- that the family can stay\ntogether through the profession. But it didn\u2019t work. This head of the block realized when\neverybody was asked what is the profession, I am, I told that I am a student of pharmacy. She\ntold me then that I should care of the hygiene and everything of the block, that was a job for me.\nIf somebody 1s ill, because in these -- there was a Jewish physician --. If somebody is ill, I\nshould take her to the doctor and so on. I got some medication. It was mainly aspirin. If\nsomebody needs aspirin, I should give her. I got from this doctor, something. They liked me\nvery much, these doctors. I remember that. I realized that if I give aspirin to somebody that she\nwill sell it for bread. Then I told her if you need aspirin, bring a glass of water or something\nand you have to take it before me. I would have give anything for bread, but I didn\u2019t want that I\ngave somebody an aspirin that she should sell it. Then I had --.",
        "Q: So you would watch them take it?",
        "A: Yes, yes. She had to take it before me, in front of me. If she really needs it, then she should\ntake it. That was this life, everyday life. I had this occupation, I had to go to the (r__--) and I\nhad to ask for aspirin. They had it because people were bringing you the . We had also\na small amount and they were taken away. They took everything at the end. Then in these\nstorage, they selected everything. You can see in the museum, even now big piles of glasses as\nit was selected. People who worked in the storage, that was the best occupation.",
        "Q: These people who took the aspirin, it probably didn\u2019t help them?",
        "A: If you had a headache, or if you had a back , 1t could help you, the aspirin.",
        "Q: Were there a lot of people sick? How long were you in this barracks?",
        "A: I was all the time, in Auschwitz.",
        "Q: How many months?",
        "A: That lasted till October. From July to October.",
        "Q: Do you remember the exact date that you entered?",
        "A: I think it was the 6\" of July. I don\u2019t know the exact date.",
        "Q: You were there until October __?",
        "A: These period when I was, how to tell it? When I had this duty and things and the people were\nthere.",
        "Q: Were all the people in your barracks, they weren\u2019t all Hungarians?",
        "A: They were all Hungarians, yes.",
        "Q: They were all Hungarian Jews?",
        "A: All Hungarian Jews from different parts of the country. It was a selected -- they were all young.\nMost of them were young.",
        "Q: How old was the oldest? I mean, the youngest?",
        "A: Maybe eighteen.",
        "Q: Oh, that old?",
        "A: That old. Fourteen was the youngest who could enter the lager and these very young people,\nthey were together. Once I met the friends of my brother, later on. They were working\ntogether, it was one group. Maybe the oldest was 40 in this group that I was",
        "Q: Did you have your own bed, or did you share a bed?",
        "A: Bed! There were no beds in Auschwitz. There was a sprrech. [\u201cWooden\u2019\u2019|",
        "Q: There were no bunks or anything like that?",
        "A: No.",

        "Q: They were like wooden --? That\u2019s what I mean -- bunks.",
        "A: Yes, three bunks. It was placed, something was on the --, some soft thing was on the platform.\nYou had some blankets. But, it was summer, it was not so bad. Maybe we were sleeping there\nsix or seven in a bunk. That was not too crowded because these bunks were big enough.",
        "Q: So you might have been sharing yours with another girl?",
        "A: Yes, we had a common blanket, this other girl.",
        "Q: Do you remember the girl you shared it with?",
        "A: Yes, but --.",
        "Q: She was there the whole time with you?",
        "A: No, no. I have to tell you the end of the story. Not end, continuation of the story. I remember\nmy twentieth birthday that was October 13\". It was a very ugly day because somehow later,\nthey brought Polish people to this . Polish people with children. I don\u2019t know from where\nthey came. For instance, the head of the barrack where I was, she gave -- she liked very much\none of these children. She was three years old, the child. She was born in a camp already. A\nbaby girl. She was there with her mother. Somehow, she like this child and she gave her food\nevery day for this three years old girl. That was my anniversary when they collected all these\nPolish children, to kill; to take them away and kill them. The child, this small child, whom I\nknew through this head of the barrack, whom I see often, she was taken away too. Then I asked\nthe head of the barrack, will they kill all the children? And she told, oh yes. Then we knew\nalready what is happening. The big head of the , when the selection was, the big trucks\ncame to the lager and people were just, were black. For instance, after a selection for which\nthey made, nude, the naked people were just thrown on the platform of this van and\ntaken away. These children were just thrown on this platform and taken away. They collected\nthe children, put in this and that was my twentieth birthday.",
        "Q: They separated, just took them from their mothers?",
        "A: Yes, yes. [\u201cWhere did they come from\u2019\u2019] I don\u2019t remember, from a camp, from a Polish camp\nwhere the family --. Jews born Polish, not all were Jews. The Polish people were not all Jews\nin Auschwitz, but I think they were Jews. You could, the political --, these three angles,\neverybody had a number and these three angles, you see my number. The people who were to\nbe lager, they all got numbers. My mother, never. That was also a distinction. That we were\nmore valuable people, we got numbers.",
        "Q: The children, did they --? How long were they in your barracks before they were taken away?",
        "A: These Polish children? How long were they --? Maybe several weeks, not long. Then I had\none very, an adventure? That was maybe in September. Do you know the name,\nSonderkommando? Have you ever heard it? No. The Sonderkommando, not Jewish but from\nthe camp, who were working at the crematortums. They had hard work but they got enough\nfood but that, after a while, they killed all the people of the Sonderkommando and they choose\nnew one. That was a regulation. That they must be killed because they have seen everything \u2014\nhow they keep people, how they gas them and so on. At one of the crematoriums, the\nSonderkommando knew that they will kill them. Somehow, they had, because it was a factory\nvery close to Auschwitz, that they made something, I don\u2019t know how to tell it, where they\nmade for the guns.",
        "Q: Ammunition?",
        "A: Yes, ammunition, yes. It was an ammunition factory and some people were there. Somehow,\nthis Sonderkommando through a girl who was working there, got ammunition. They blew up\nthe crematorium and tried to escape in the commotion. But they didn\u2019t succeed. I have seen it\nbecause it was so that; there were people in the block who had to bring the food for, the evening\nfood. I was just there in the barrack and had nothing to do and one of the girls told me, Eva\ncome and help us to bring the food for the evening. We will get fromesh, it was in boxes, you\nknow, you have to --.",
        "Q: Cheese.",
        "A: Cheese, we will get cheese and to help us to bring the cheese. I went there and we had to wait\nat the kitchen. Beside the kitchen was a small hill and we had to wait there. I went to the top of\nthis hill just tolook at.",
        "Q: On the top of the --?",
        "A: Of this small hill which was beside the kitchen; maybe it was from garbage.",
        "Q: Oh, hill, okay.",
        "Q: I have seen this --.",
        "A: It was a big explosion?",
        "A: A big explosion.",
        "Q: There were people killed in the explosion?",
        "A: No, no. Ihave seen the SS. It was very close, the road, the lager road. The kitchen was close\nto the lager road and I have seen how the SS people are running after the explosion to the\ncrematorium. They were so, it was so unexpected that they were just taken aback in running, do\nyou understand me?",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: It turned out that this was the revolution of the Sonderkommando. They could recollect\neverybody, nobody could escape. They even managed to know who was the girl who gave the\nammunition and they killed everybody, including the girl.",
        "Q: Was that done publicly?",
        "A: I\u2019m sure it was publicly. It was in a different area of the --.",
        "Q: Right.\nTape 2",
        "A: That is interesting. As I told you we were not, we hadn\u2019t seen the execution but all the news we\nget, we get to know all the news. It was a communication, how to tell it. . The girl\nwas taken and she was killed too and nobody could escape. That\u2019s it, what I wanted. That is\nwhat I wanted to tell you. It was so that it was the custom or how to tell it, that when they\nbrought new transport with the train, then 1t was blockspera, it means that you couldn\u2019t leave\nthe barrack where you were. You had to stay there all the day, not to see. But somehow, --. I\nremember when they brought new people. For instance, from Slovakia, they first, as ve told\nyou, only the girls were taken away. The unmarried girls. For instance, one, a cousin of mine\nwho used to live there was taken because she was unmarried but two others who were married\ncould stay there. They were taken later on in September from Slovakia to Auschwitz. I\nremember when they brought this transport, when the transport was coming and how few\npeople could enter the lager. Maybe, I don\u2019t know how many they brought. After my mother,\nbecause a sister of my mother used to live in Yeetro and the whole family. I told mother that\nthey were brought, I have spoken to people who entered the lager and so I knew that they were\ntaken and that nobody among them, entered the lager. I remember that I told mother that your\nsister came and her family, her two daughters and husbands, and grandchildren and nobody\nentered the lager.",
        "Q: When was that?",
        "A: That was in September. Later they brought from this mustalager from the , they brought\nlater people. Then in autumn, I don\u2019t know when they began to empty Auschwitz. They\nwanted to evacuate. They destroyed in the late -- that was later, they destroyed the\ncrematoriums. Only one is left. In the men\u2019s lager in the fall. Because in Birkenu there were\nfour crematoriums. They were not enough. They destroyed all the four crematoriums but that\nwas later. But they began to evacuate. In October, they took my mother from this _ lager. I\nremember it was this blocksperen this closed thing but I was so nervous because of the mother\nand I wanted to know what happens because it was a big selection. Who were found good\nenough, they were taken away and I was told that they will bring them to _ lager but that\nwasn\u2019t true. Who were not healthy enough, they were killed. I remember it was October, it was\nNocterine; the day was not yet cold, it was a nice day. I was sitting 1n a hole all the day. From\nthere I could see what happens in the C-lager where the mother was.",
        "Q: You were hiding in a hole?",
        "A: Yes, because I was so anxious to see what will happen to my mother. I wanted to see what\nhappens. I couldn\u2019t see much but it was a better feeling to sit in this hole. Then they took\nmother and she was taken to Bergen-Belsen that I knew.",
        "Q: How did you know that?",
        "A: She was not there any more. Maybe I have spoken to somebody who knew her but I knew that.\nBefore she was taken away, I have forgotten to tell you that it was a transport and all my friends\nwent with this transport from our block, everybody was taken to work. Some back to\nCzechoslovakia, I learned later. I was starting with them, I went, every transport was the same -\n- that you had to go to the main scrag of the lager and then they selected you and from then you\nwere taken away. I went with them to this place. Then I felt that I can\u2019t go away; the mother is\nhere. I can give her food, I can see her, I can\u2019t leave my mother here and I just escaped and\nwent back. I didn\u2019t went to the transport. Then I was smart then, at that time I was smart\nenough, I knew that nothing will happen. When the number 1s filled, they will take the\ntransport and finished.",
        "Q: They won\u2019t miss you?",
        "A: They won\u2019t miss me. In the evening, I told my mother I couldn\u2019t go away. I remain here.\nSomebody was with my mother and other mother who had three daughters in the group. She\nask me do you know anything about my three girls? I told her yes, they went. She said, oh they\nleft me here. To tell the truth, they were smart. Later it turned out, when I was at home, it was\nyears and years after, I met a girl, I met a girl with whom I slept under one blanket. She told me\nthat this transport was already good. They went to a small town somewhere in Czechoslovakia.\nThey worked in a factory. The work itself was not too hard. The people in these small towns\nwere very helpful. They gave them food whenever they could. Only one person died. It was\nsix hundred people and only one died, one of them with natural -- something happened to her.\nThat was not a bad trip. All the others came back.",
        "Q: Do you know what they were making in the factory?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know exactly. I was not so interested in that kind of factory. It was maybe a textile or\nsomething. She worked in Tunsaran. She was from Budapest but she worked in Tunsaran and\nso she was as the sister of your friend.. So she was taken away. It was not allowed to commute,\nthe Jewish people couldn\u2019t commute. They were exempt, they saw they are exempt and they\nworked in Tunsaran and they used to leave that. Then the German took everybody who was\nworking in Tunsaran. Tunsaran is a big factory which exists even now in Hungary. The bulbs,\nthey are making bulbs and --.",
        "Q: Oh, light bulbs.",
        "A: Yes and it was a very important thing and the first Jewish people who worked there were\nexempt. They can stay there and work.",
        "Q: This was in Budapest?",
        "A: It was Ujpest, the suburb. So that is that. It is one of the biggest factories in Hungary. So I\ncouldn\u2019t go away and some weeks later, mother was taken away. I told myself, now it is no\nreason to stay here any more and I go away with the next transport. The next transport where I\nwent, which was chosen, went from one part of the lager to the other part. That was the whole\ntransport. It was the oldest part and all the circumstances were much worse. It was\nAusenkommando, I told you, we had to work. We had to dig potatoes inthe pun __\u2014\u2014_\u2014\u00ab.~ We had\nto put potatoes in heaps and cover with earth. It was raining, everything was wet; all the\npotatoes got rotten. One day we were -- and it was a very heavy work because you had to carry\nit across; it was a hard work. You had to carry the potatoes. One day it was put there, the other\nday we had to remove them from there. It was silly work only it was very, very difficult, very\nhard work. In this potato, I got ill very soon. I was not so strong any more. I never was a\nstrong person and I got ill. In the meantime, the evacuation of the camp was continued and we\nwere taken from this old part of this lager back to where I used to be, back to this relatively new\npart, this B2B where I have known all the physicians. Them I felt ill and I was ill and I sent to\nthese physicians whom I knew and they put me in this rever , you know what arever __\nis, it was a small hospital where ill people could stay as long as they were not selected. At that\ntime, the selection was not as bad any more. After they knew the crematorium didn\u2019t work. I\nhoped that maybe if I can regain force andifI gotothe rev. _\u2014sthat wasintherev \u2018you\ndidn\u2019t have to stay this active (?) because that was awful, to stay and stay and it was cold and it\nwas dark in the evening. What happened to me during this potato work --one day we had\nblocksperesh where we had to stay in the barrack. We had to come back from the potato field to\nstay in the barrack. Ihad one only ___ to sleep, underwear. I hated it, you can imagine. I\nhated it, it was so --. I have worn it day and day and day after this one only thing. We were\nthere and I thought -- I washed it and it was wet. We went to sleep and the wet underwear was\nsomewhere there. It was stolen. So it was November and I had to stay the opel and I had no\nunderwear. Even today, I am very sensitive. I got cold, you notice, the weather and even today\nI suffer with it. Then, it was some days I was walking without this underwear and then we went\nsomewhere there was a bath, where there was warm water and you could take a bath, there and\nsomehow there, we manages to buy for me, I was with a friend together -- I always looked for a\nfriend to have somebody, not to be alone -- and this was a very good friend of mine. We went\nthere and we bought for a bread because we had, in this work, in this potato work, we got more\nbread than usual. We had bread and we bought for me underwear, warm underwear for one\nbread. We put together our -- and then I had it. I remember it was such a cold, I got such a bad\ncold, because to stay out as long without underwear, that I had diarrhea and I had to urinate\nalways, I was really ill. It was while we were standing in the opel and I found that I must go up.\nI told Markget, Pl sit down and I'll manage my work. She began to cry, Eva don\u2019t do it. If the\nGerman will see you, what you are doing, she will kill you. She will hit you, beat you until you\nare dead. I told her, I can\u2019t help, I must. I had the chance, I was not seen. It was dark already\nand so I could manage it. I felt that I must do it because otherwise -- it was stupidity because\nstanding is possible --but I hated it. To get dirty.",
        "Q: It sounds horrible. You stayed in Auschwitz --?",
        "A: Yes, then I -- I missed the schedule because that was during this potato work, all these things\nthat we bought for me the underwear and that we had to stand. What I thought then, decided to\never __ this old part of the lager and we went back to this B2B which was one of the best parts\nof the lager. Then the physicians who knew me took me to the revier, to the small hospital. But\nI missed you a very important -- I missed a very important detail of the potato. In this potato\nfield, we worked together, Ukrainian girls who were from the countryside, who were big and\nstrong and for whom this work was nothing special. We used to live in the same block together\nwith them. They were very, very rude with us. In the morning they took -- in Auschwitz you\nare not allowed to drink water, there is no drinking there, many people died because they drank\nthis water and typhus, I don\u2019t know what and died in diarrhea. They took the -- in the morning\nthey brought tea. It was not tea but it was something but it was boiled water. They took this hot\nwater and they washed themselves in it. We remained, we didn\u2019t get anything to drink in the\nmorning, so they were so rude. We had to go to the kitchen and steal tea which is a stupidity to\nsteal boiled water but we had to drink something. If the German see us, that we are stealing the\ntea from the kitchen, it would be a bad story. We had to do it because we knew we have to\ndrink and we are not allowed to drink the water. That was our drink for the whole day. Then\nthey carried a big -- these Ukrainian girls , they were strong -- and they carried many potatoes.\nWe can\u2019t keep up with potatoes in this carriage. She told the German officer, look, the Jew has\nso few potatoes and I am carrying so much. We managed to escape somehow from the German\nthat she couldn\u2019t observe that we are carrying a few, only on the bottom of this thing. But she\ntold the German, look what they are doing. Then we got hit. We were beaten, They were\nreally very, very -- [\u201cSo they were not Jewish\u201d] No, no. They were from the countryside. I\ncan\u2019t help but these are my memories from the Ukrainian girls. They were even worse than the\nGermans with us. That was the end of my working career in Auschwitz, when I got to this\nrevier. I don\u2019t know why, I could do eel and eel. I couldn\u2019t recall why.",
        "Q: It\u2019s still 1944?",
        "A: That was 1944, that was November, late November already. In Auschwitz, there were two\nreviers for ill people, not two parts, two sections. One was the E section for women, it was only\none and F section for men. In the small revier, in B2B, they couldn\u2019t help me and if you are\nmore serious ill, you had to be taken to this E section. I was taken to this E section and later I\nmet one girl of Ujpest, of my town, saw me when I was taken to the E section -- not alone, with\nseveral people. She told me later in Ujpest, I was sure that you are taken to be killed. I never\nthought that we will again meet each other here in our town because I was so upset and I was\nsure that you were taken away to be killed [\u201cWho?\u201d\u2019] I tell you later. I don\u2019t know only the name\nbut several times I have met her in Ujpest. I was taken to this E sector and that was maybe\nDecember already. In January, 18\" of January, and I was bad, and I had malaria because I had\ntemperature; the temperature rose suddenly disappeared. I had four or five of these and I was\nagain without a temperature. I was there with many other people. It is January. It was told that\neverybody who can run, who can walk have to go and to leave the camp. A transport will go\nand it was told that there are no trains, you have to walk. All my clothing was____ wrong, it\nwas greenish, something green and the very same one and a pair of shoes.",
        "Q: That\u2019s all you had?",
        "A: That\u2019s all what I had.",
        "Q: A dress and a pair of shoes?",
        "A: When you get ill, they take all your dresses.",
        "Q: Oh, so you just had the gown, the nightshirt?",
        "A: Nightshirt and a pair of shoes. But then we managed some and everybody in the revier had\nclothing. But somehow, we managed to get clothes. Then it was not the strict order anymore.\nMy friends brought me some clothes. It was a coat and a Jacket. I got some clothes. Then it\nwas a full day, everybody got a loaf of bread and it was told that everybody who can walk must\ngo. Then we were some young girls and we decided not to go. We thought we are not strong\nenough, we cannot walk. They will kill us 1f we can\u2019t walk. The only chance to survive 1s to\nstay here and to see what will happen. That\u2019s the only chance. If we go, we are sure that we\nwill be killed. We were maybe five girls. We decided to stay and we will see at that time, we\nhad the clothes __ and we will see what will happen. I remember it was a girl there from the\nfirst group whom I knew from the first group when I was first time in the B\u2019s, 2B, and she was\nrather ill. She wanted to go and she decided to go. I told her but you are ill, you can\u2019t walk.\nBut I want to be alive -- that was her answer. It was so funny, I didn\u2019t answer anything but it\nwas that I want to be alive as well. Therefore, I want to stay here and she went. I don\u2019t know\nwhat happened to her but it was so striking to me, I want to be alive. That was her answer. We\nstayed there and we were there more than one week alone.",
        "Q: Just the five of you?",
        "A: No, two thousand, seven hundred, I don\u2019t know how many, ill people. Everybody was ill and\nsick. Of course, there were other people who had the same idea then. It was a big battle, very\nclose to Auschwitz, a big battle, where Res _ is, very close. At the river, was a big battle. It\nlasted two days. It was on the 27\", we have seen and we have heard the battle. That was our\nchance. We had no electricity in the camp and we had no water. Itwas_\u2014s\u2014\u2014_\u2014sain. the case\nof fire, this water, because there was running water in the camp. It was not anymore running.\nWe had fuel, we had coal to heat, we could heat the barrack. Many people died during these ten\ndays. Because all of them were ill people who stayed there; some of them were well.",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t have very much to eat?",
        "A: We had this bread and then somehow, people managed to get from the storage, some food. I\nremember we got beans and we cooked it 24 hours in this fire. It never got soft, but we ate it. It\nwas so old that it -- we just wanted to cook it in water. We had something to eat. was a\nbig thing. On the 27\" when the cannon, in the morning everything it was silence, stopped, the\ncannon stopped and everything stopped. At noon, the first Russian soldiers arrived to the camp.\nThey were wearing this white gown, it was winter. At twelve o\u2019clock, I went to bring some coal\nto heat this, because it was a long, long oven along the whole barrack which could be heated. It\nwas not warm but it was not ice cold in the barrack and we could heat it some of. We went to\nbring fuel and then we have seen the first two soldiers who were coming. That was the first\ncamp where they found living people. People who were alive. They passed already, the\nRussian army, passed already Treblinka and Majdanek and nobody was there alive. It turned\nour that Auschwitz was undermanned too but I had no time anymore to do anything. They just\nrun away, the Wehrmacht army never came to the camp who were fighting back. The SS run\naway and the Wehrmacht didn\u2019t come. In the afternoon came a high ranking officer, a Russian\nofficer, early afternoon. He went in every barrack, it was only two parts of Birkenau. He told\nus that this is a surprise for them; that they can find here people who are living. They are not\nprepared for that. They can\u2019t give to eat anything else but tea and sweet. That they bring as\nmuch as we want and he will promise that in five days we will have everything to eat. That was\nour chance. Because these ill people who were starved, that they couldn\u2019t eat anything else but\ntea and sweet, that was the best solution for them. American and English soldiers made a big\nfault when, for instance in Bergen-Belsen, the English people gave food, rich food for these\npeople. We know it because a cousin of his was there and many people died because of the rich\nfood. Here in Auschwitz everybody had to eat because they had nothing. But in two days, we\ngot food already, not in five, in two days they could give us food. Then they took everybody\nfrom Birkenau to the main lager where the barracks were bleak. It was an old soldier camp\nfrom the Polish army, the main camp in Auschwitz. Everybody was taken there from these\nwooden barracks/ Everybody was -- it was a military hospital for at least ill people. Sorry to\nsay, there were many people who died later on because they were so ill, that they couldn\u2019t be\ncured. I must say that maybe they had not the best and the most up-to-date medication, but they\nwere very, very careful. I got the best treatment, the best care. I thought and I am -- and then\nafterwards I went down. You were elevated. They didn\u2019t have to keep me anymore and I was\nvery, very ill. When I went in my -- four people were very III afterwards and I was one of them.\nI was 27 kilos that was the lowest weight because I couldn\u2019t eat. I got more to eat and better\nthere than anybody else. They couldn\u2019t eat it. I got every day an egg and milk, it didn\u2019t help\nme. What was the most important, I got a weight gain. Somebody had to sit beside me, beside\nmy bed all the night and to tell the physician if I don\u2019t feel well. Somebody helped me, to call\nthe physician. One night, I was really very ill. I remember the physician was standing beside\nme. I don\u2019t remember when I lost consciousness but I remember that the physician stood beside\nme and was feeling,my pulse and asking me do you feel better now? I told her yes, now I feel\nbetter. Because in the evening, I told the person who had to sit beside me, he was a man. That I\nfeel very bad today. I had a very bad day today. I don\u2019t know when I lost my consciousness but\nthe doctor was there. In the morning came, it was called in Russian, a Stiab. It is a German\nname that it was a military staff and the head was a physician and he was a colonel and he knew\neverybody. That was in the night and at 8 o\u2019clock in the morning, he was at my bed and asked\nme what happened to you, in the daytime you were not so ill. I have seen you at noon and\neverything was okay with you and what happened to you in the night that you were so ill? He\nknew everybody and he visited and from that time, I remember, that several times at midnight, I\nawake that he 1s standing at my bed and feeling my pulse, my heart rate. He knew everybody,\nhe was an excellent person.",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t have any contact with your father, your brother there?",
        "A: They were taken away in September, from Auschwitz. I was there. I am the only person who\nremained in Auschwitz. They were taken to Mierdoff. It is in Southern Germany, Bavaria,\nSouthern Bavaria. I know because I got everything. My father was dead in December, my\nbrother survived him and my brother died in March, three weeks before they could liberate his\ncamp. Actually he fell asleep during the night. That\u2019s a typical test of the starvation. He fell\nasleep. I know that his heart was very -- because of the starvation and everything -- his heart\nwas not good.",
        "Q: Your father and brother left Auschwitz in September. Was this for labor or --?",
        "A: It was another camp. I don\u2019t know -- don\u2019t ask logic. There was no logic, one camp was like\nthe other. They don\u2019t wanted you to work; they wanted you to die. In these big camps, there\nwas very few work. It was, then it was like this .",
        "Q: Someone from Budapest told you later about what happened to your -- some survivors?",
        "A: Yes. Actually, a cousin who came from Transylvania and who found my brother dead in this\ncamp by chance. He was in camp and he could move. That is a good feeling, he was not\nalone and this cousin could give some food for him. He was very happy, the cousin told me that\nhe is not alone and he had somebody. So this was not so bad. The physicians who were there,\nthey have no wonder that he will die, he is so ill that he will die.",
        "Q: Your father was also ill? Did you know anything about --?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know how. In my opinion, I told you my father was a humanist. He died because of\nillness, that\u2019s my theory, but because that was such a great disappointment for him in mankind,\nthat such a thing could happen, that people can treat people like that, that this disappointment,\nbecause of this, he gave up.",
        "Q: You never saw your brother or your father after you entered Auschwitz?",
        "A: I told it at the beginning, I have seen once my father. I told you that was this kommando, this\ngarbage kommando that people, this cart was driven by people. It was at the place where they\ncollected garbage. My father was not in this garbage kommando but somehow he arranged that\nhe could go out from the lager with this garbage. The garbage of our lager was taken there. He\ntold this kapo who was from our lager that she should bring me. What happened because the\nnumber. If you leave, not the person was important, but the number. Ten people are driving the\ncart, they can go, eleven not, but ten can go. I was told go to the garbage kommando; they will\ntake you out and you can meet your father. I met my father. Unfortunately, with the previous\ntransport, my brother was there too, but then I was not there. I could see my father and I hardly\nrecognized my father because he looked like, before Auschwitz like on this photo, he looked so\nyoung, not white hair or nothing. Then he was white and very, very old. Therefore, I tell you\nthat was a disappointment in the whole mankind which took him away and not any of this. I\nmet him in the garbage.",
        "Q: How long did you talk to him?",
        "A: Five minutes. You had to bring the garbage and to take it.",
        "Q: You just exchanged news about your mother and brother?",
        "A: Yes, yes. Five minutes. This Auschwitz number is 8-13160.",
        "Q: Is there anything else that you want to tell about your experiences before the liberation?",
        "A: The story with my illness. I told you that I was one of the four most ill persons. This Russian\nmilitary hospital was dissolved in \u201945, September. In \u201945 September, I was certified (??)\ntuberculosis already and they took me to Krakow because I couldn\u2019t walk yet. They took me to\nKrakow, the university clinic. Ten more months, I had to stay there. I was there and I returned\nto Hungary \u00b046, the 1\u201c of August. It was very difficult for me to come back, I had no\ndocuments, only one small paper which I got from the Polish Red Cross that I was this number\nand with my name, that I was liberated in Auschwitz by the Russian army. It was written on\nthis paper that everybody is asked to help me get home. In \u201946, everybody was at home\nalready, or everybody died, and I had to walk to Ka____ to the Red Cross and they couldn\u2019t\narrange me to go home, the permission to go home. I went to the council, to a high- ranking\nofficer in Ka___ I know who he was. I was told if I give him sum, I can leave the camp. He\nwill give me document and I can go wherever I want but I have no money. He told me if I go,\nthat the paper that you have is nothing. If I go to the Russian people, I can get the same paper\nfrom them. It is nothing like you have. I was very angry. I decided that I will go to the State\nDepartment in Russian. I have to find somebody who will believe me, that I am Hungarian and\na Jew and I have to go home. From Ka ___, the Red Cross gave me fare, the , to go to\nRussia. I went to the State Department and I went and I found somebody who was responsible\nfor the east European countries. I told him that I am an Hungarian and he answered me\nHungarian. It turned out that during the war he was in Hungary and he had a Hungarian wife.\nHe spoke Hungarian and then he told me that he will arrange me. He began to call everybody\nand he told me that he will arrange for me permission to leave the country. I will get it from\nhim but I have to come back in ten days because he tried to arrange it at once but it doesn\u2019t\nwork. He needs time and I should return in ten days. I went back to Ka___ I was living there\nat the Red Cross. They had such a house there. In ten days, I went again to Russia and I got\nthis paper. Then I had to go to this country official again that he should give me the stamp on\nthis. Then he was very nice and he told me, I told you that you need a good document and that\nis a good document what you have now. Now you can leave the country. So he was very polite\nand very nice with me. I could come home, not so easily. It was funny because it was a group\nof Hungarian people. The most stupid story you have ever heard. It was a family with two\nchildren and I don\u2019t know, with somebody else with two other people who had the same\ndocument what I had. A couple, it turned out that he was a Jew and she was a Christian and he\nwas one of the men who hadn\u2019t got a Hungarian citizenship but he had a Polish citizenship.\nThese people from Hungary were taken away in \u00b041 to somewhere, to Ukraine. They all were\nkilled by the Germans there. Somehow, because the wife told that I don\u2019t leave him to go alone\nand I go with him, somehow, this very simple Christian woman, she could save his life. They\ncame back from Ukraine with the same paper that they got somehow, the same paper what I\nhad. I came home with this group. At the frontier, it was \u201946, the Russian officer didn\u2019t like us\nto enter the country. They say they will have to check who we are. We had to stay at the\nborder; it was joined there already, this Jewish organization from here, from the state. They\ngave us food, they gave us where to sleep. We had to wait there. That was on the Hungarian\nborder. I knew, somehow, these are Hungarian- speaking people who are living in this village.\nI spoke to somebody because in this village used to live the brother-in-law of this boy with his\nsister. They used to live in this village. What do you know about Mr. Mueller, this boyfriend\nwho disappeared in Russia. I asked the people, do you know Mr. Mueller? They told yes, he\u2019s\nliving, the wife is dead but he\u2019s still living. He is in the Hungarian part of the city which is\ncalled Est. I asked, how can I contact him, I asked this man. He told go to the riverside,\nthat is the Danube, everybody knows him in Est__, asked the smugglers. The smuggler\nwill take with pleasure your letter to Mueller because he is a rich man and he will give them\nmoney. If you write that you are here, he will manage somehow that you could cross the\nborder. I did it and it happened that next day came somebody from the other side and looked\nfor me in the joint. I told him that the check \u2014_ I\u2019m not allowed to know that he came to take\nme over. I should insist that I want to go and they will allow me without the permission but\nthey will allow me to go.

First we were forced to live\nthere two-family; then more and more families. At the end, before the deportation, I don\u2019t\nknow we were living there maybe twenty or twenty- four people were already living in this one\napartment. It was a family house.",

We passed by in Budapest later, there were\nhouses marked with David Star. The house where we used to live was un over these marked\nhouses. It seemed more better ever the choice to go to live with these friends in this family\nhouse as to live in this relatively big house.",
        "A: Yes, it was marked also. Then the marked houses were getting fewer and fewer and we were\ncollecting people with more and more deaths. I don\u2019t know exactly how many people were in\nthese relatively small family houses at the end.",

        "A: I thought I had life because -- not even one family had a room in this house. We were sleeping\nwith different people. I ate all the marmalades which my mother had with us. I was\nnever so fat in my life as before Auschwitz. Maybe that was my chance.",

Because that\nwas Auschwitz already. The people were forced to write these letters.",
        "A: They wrote, yes. They were forced. It was not letters, it was cards. It was cards and they were\nforced to write to friends and relatives who are still in Budapest or somewhere in the\ncountryside, that we are here and we are working and everything is okay with us. These letters,\nI\u2019ve heard it about these postcards. That was the only thing what we knew. Later, in\nAuschwitz, I heard --.",

Three days they were\nstanding there in the streets of and after --. We told that we should prepare for leaving\nthe house and we can take with us only a very few things. Some clothing and nothing special,\nno jewel, no food.",
        "A: Very, very -- just a small something to eat but not too much. After three days we had to leave;\nwe had to leave, we had to go. They collected all the Jewish people from Ujpest and from the\nsuburbs of Budapest because Budapest was encountered with small suburbs. They took all the\nJews from the suburbs. All the Jews were collected in a brick factory just outside of Budapest or\nvery close to Budapest. Budakalow. That\u2019s the name of the village. It belongs to Budapest\nnow. No, it exists even today. Everybody was collected in this brick factory.",
        "A: By the train. We had to go to the station of Ujpest which is a very small one.",
        "A: Walked. We saw the luggages through the whole town. It is a very long road which was called\nafter the war, Marketopoola because of this march. As I know the Hungarian people, they\nchanged it.",

        "A: Yes.",

He got an exemption because Hungary had, not Ujpest\nhad, the chief physician of the town who was responsible for the town, he was a very good man\nand a leftist. He told that every pharmacist must be exempt. So my father came back from the\nlabor camp. Because the pharmacy must be open, he told that, become , the\npharmacist.",
        "A: Maybe six weeks.",
        "A: It was just very close to the town, very close to Ujpest and to Budapest. Never mind. I don\u2019t\nremember.",
        "A: Nothing. It was just a camp for collecting people.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so. Probably he was only four weeks there.",
        "A: In 1940. No, later, later. That was later. It was 1941 or something like that. Then he was\nexempt.",
        "A: No, no. We had help in the pharmacy. My mother couldn\u2019t run a pharmacy because she had no\ndegree. We had somebody, an employee. Later this employee had to go to the army and then\nfather was alone.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: That was only some hours. That was very close to Budapest. It takes twenty minutes to go\nthere. We were several hours there but it is so close to Budapest. Then we went there and we\nstayed there for a week. That was the hell of everything, this brick factory, because we were in\nthe open air, nothing was there, no facilities, nothing. One or two wells for water, that was\ndrinking water and everything. You couldn\u2019t wash yourself, you had to sleep on the earth. If\nyou had some blanket, then you were lucky. As I remember, we had some blankets but it was\nsummer and it was no rain, but that was the hell of everything. Then they started to make the\nconvoys, or how to call it, the groups to Auschwitz. The Germans came --.",
        "A: They were Germans, together with the Hungarians. Germans.",
        "A: Yes, I think so. Then they put people in these wagons.",
        "A: Yes, yes. We were in the last group who left this and it was the last transport. We lasted three\nor four days. This one bucket, it was two buckets. One bucket for water, one bucket for the\n. You could empty maybe two or three times, these buckets; we were all cramped in. As\nit was the last transport, 1t was not so crowded, these wagons, as usual, because there were not\nso many people -- already dead. We were only 70 or 80, not more but that was much too. I\nremember that my father told me during the first night, we were sitting so, that I never thought\nthat your first journey abroad will be like this. Because that was my first journey abroad. I was\nin my twenties.",
        "A: No, I was still well.",
        "A: Yes, everybody was.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember. Maybe we had something to eat. I remember that we got something to eat\nthrough this week; that a neighbor brought us something to eat. From Budapest, somebody\nbrought some food for us.",
        "A: To the brickyard. He was not allowed to come in but somehow he got in.",
        "A: A Christian, yes. For us and for the Reyicherds. We were together with this family, a friend of\nmy brother and with his parents until Auschwitz. But his parents were older, more older; he\nwas a late child. They were sick people; they were fat and sick. They never entered the camp.\nHe entered so they were, you know how it was.",
        "A: The train was awful, as I told you. Maybe, even at Kasha. Of course, at that time it was\nHungary but after the First World, 1t was Slovakia and it is Slovakia even today. A Hungarian\ngendarme came to the wagon and told we should give everything we have then, I think it was a\nprivate business that we should give everything which we have from Ladaad or if we have\nanything, water, somebody had nothing. Anyhow, the German will take everything from us and\nwe should give it to him. That was the last Hungarian I have spoken with.",
        "A: No, we had nothing.",
        "A: From friends or from relatives. It was not with us -- I got it from relatives.",
        "A: Nothing with us. We had some baskets with us. Everybody had a small luggage. Nothing\ninteresting.",
        "A: No. They didn\u2019t allow to take. In this apartment in Ujpest, they checked everything what you\ntake. Ifit was a better thing, or something, you are just not allowed to take it with you.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No, no.",
        "A: No, no. We learned it very soon where we are. But the name didn\u2019t tell us anything yet.\nBecause Jewish people were working at the train as well. Then it was this selection. My whole\nfamily went into the -- father, brother were together and I was together with my mother. We\nentered camp.",
        "A: We were not selected out.",
        "A: They never entered. I have to tell you that was my first, that is even today, one of my worst\nmemories. That we were all already -- Everybody had to bathe, to take a bath, that it was worth\nthat or it was the gas. Everybody had to take everything off and even the hair was cut. We\nwere already without anything. Then the German people were there; they realized that there\nwas a girl with an orthopedic shoe. So one leg was shorter than the other. They took and they\nrealized when she was naked. They took the naked girl out and took her away, naked as she\nwas, because of the foot. Now, I know, later I know that she was taken to the other room to be\nkilled. Because they realized that only when she was naked.",
        "A: No, no. Only I remember the whole story. I have seen the whole story. At that time, I didn\u2019t\nunderstand, of course, what was happening. But I have the whole picture in my eyes. She was\ntaken naked and killed.",
        "A: Eighteen. A nice young girl. At that time, I used to have very beautiful hair. It was more light\nthan now; it was a very nice color. Now, it is getting dark with age but you saw ---. It was fair\nand a bit reddish. My mother was very proud of it and when they cut my hair, she just thought,\noh your beautiful hair! I remember. Then we entered this thing and then we met the girls from\nCzechoslovakia who were there already three years. Only a few of them remained alive after\nthree years and they were the kapos, not kapo, lageraltester. They were who ruled the barrack.\nLageraltester that was the end of the whole lager.",
        "A: They were Jewish. Every barrack had a head. Lageraltester, that was the German name. They\nwere these Czechoslovakian girls. They were telling us just at the beginning, do you see the\nsmoke there? That is your relatives, your parents. I didn\u2019t want to believe it. I was a humanist\nlike my father. I remembered that we had a dead person in our wagon already when we arrived\nto Auschwitz. I told my mother, they are so, I\u2019m sure many people were dead during this long\njourney. Therefore the crematorium is running because they have to get rid of the dead people.\nI didn\u2019t believe that they were killing the people. But later on, very soon, I knew they were\nright.",
        "A: Yes, because men were separated and women were separated. So I was together with my\nmother.",
        "A: I have seen my father once with some others. What we did with this lager where we go. That\nwas, in Birkenau, Auschwitz is the main lager and we can now six kilometers away. When the\nHungarian people came, these last transports of this brick factory, it was called the\nsigamnalaager, gypsy lager. The number of the lager was called 32C. Later, I learned that the\ngypsy people were living there with family. It was a family lager. They killed them before the\nHungarian Jews were brought there because they needed the place. Very few gypsies who were\nin Auschwitz survived Auschwitz. Most of them were killed at that time. We came there and\nthe second day or the third day, we were newcomers. We were very stupid. We didn\u2019t know the\nregulations. For instance, we got some bread. Then people were coming and telling if you give\nme a piece of bread, I give you this pot and you can eat from this pot. One of my friends\nbought a pot to have a pot from barrack. Later on came, not the Germans, Port, \u2018toot\u2019 and then\ncame another one and took it away because it was not allowed to have the pot. The pots were\ndistributed before getting the food and then it was collected again. You couldn\u2019t own a pot and\nthe people who sold the pot for bread knew it but she was hungry. Morika, that was Morika.\nWe were stupid and I don\u2019t know, somehow, they arranged a transport from Yangers and we\nwere standing there and one person was missing. I think one person was running away from\nthis transport and they needed somebody. We were standing there with mother and they just\ntook me and pushed me in this transport and we were separated. If I were not so stupid, some\ndays later, I would run away again but I didn\u2019t run away. That was the transport, I was\nseparated from mother. Then they took us to the next lager, took we to be which had only the\nwire, which was separated with this electrical wire from the other one where mother remained.\nI was there. I sleep and I heard they wanted to send for work, these transports. But it turned out\nthat somebody had scarlet. Scarlet fever from these transports. So they stopped all the\ntransports and we had to remain there. So mother was here and I was there. I could speak to\nher. It was not so easy but I have spoken to her every day, but in the very early morning\nbecause there were these towers in Auschwitz and in every tower was a German, an SS. If he\nthought that at the wire, there are too many people, he shot. I have seen with my eyes two girls\nwho were shot. One was speaking with her sister who was on the other side and one was\nspeaking with her mother. I have seen two girls who were shot.",
        "A: It was risky. So I told mother, I will come only in the very early morning when he 1s still\nsleeping and not awake. We spoke every day. Inthis _, to me it was better because this was\npeople whom they wanted to go to work. The circumstances were better here than with mother\nand I had more to eat and I could give to mother something to eat.",
        "A: Nothing, very few people were working. We didn\u2019t work either in this other. There were very\nfew kommandos, that was the name of it, who were working. They were kommandos who\nmade the cleaning. They were big barracks as restrooms. I don\u2019t know how sees that,\nnot sees, look, pause. Clean the lageraltster, the roarinder, yes, to take the garbage. These were\nchariots, wagons pulled by people.",
        "A: Yes, carts pulled by people. These people worked, there were very few Ausen, it was called\nAusenkommando who went out of the lager to work but it was very, very few relatively. The\nmost did in Auschwitz, it was a fam , It was a killer. That they killed the people. In those\nlager, there was no --, nothing just to stay --.

        "A: They can eat twice a day, everybody. You had to stay there hours and hours until they finished\nit. That was twice a day and then nothing. They give food to us and that was ---. I asked the\nbroker , the head of the block realized --. We discussed with father that maybe we can get\ntogether before Auschwitz. If they ask what is my profession, I should answer that I am a\nstudent of pharmacy. Because I knew --.",
        "A: Yes, yes. That will be in that time that he will tell you that pharmacist, that maybe we can get\nfood together. That was the main idea.",
        "A: Not -- the family could sort of -- that was a big hope of my father -- that the family can stay\ntogether through the profession. But it didn\u2019t work. This head of the block realized when\neverybody was asked what is the profession, I am, I told that I am a student of pharmacy. She\ntold me then that I should care of the hygiene and everything of the block, that was a job for me.\nIf somebody 1s ill, because in these -- there was a Jewish physician --. If somebody is ill, I\nshould take her to the doctor and so on. I got some medication. It was mainly aspirin. If\nsomebody needs aspirin, I should give her. I got from this doctor, something. They liked me\nvery much, these doctors. I remember that. I realized that if I give aspirin to somebody that she\nwill sell it for bread. Then I told her if you need aspirin, bring a glass of water or something\nand you have to take it before me. I would have give anything for bread, but I didn\u2019t want that I\ngave somebody an aspirin that she should sell it. Then I had --.",
        "A: Yes, yes. She had to take it before me, in front of me. If she really needs it, then she should\ntake it. That was this life, everyday life. I had this occupation, I had to go to the (r__--) and I\nhad to ask for aspirin. They had it because people were bringing you the . We had also\na small amount and they were taken away. They took everything at the end. Then in these\nstorage, they selected everything. You can see in the museum, even now big piles of glasses as\nit was selected. People who worked in the storage, that was the best occupation.",
        "A: If you had a headache, or if you had a back , 1t could help you, the aspirin.",
        "A: I was all the time, in Auschwitz.",
        "A: That lasted till October. From July to October.",
        "A: I think it was the 6\" of July. I don\u2019t know the exact date.",
        "A: These period when I was, how to tell it? When I had this duty and things and the people were\nthere.",
        "A: They were all Hungarians, yes.",
        "A: All Hungarian Jews from different parts of the country. It was a selected -- they were all young.\nMost of them were young.",
        "A: Maybe eighteen.",
        "A: That old. Fourteen was the youngest who could enter the lager and these very young people,\nthey were together. Once I met the friends of my brother, later on. They were working\ntogether, it was one group. Maybe the oldest was 40 in this group that I was",
        "A: Bed! There were no beds in Auschwitz. There was a sprrech. [\u201cWooden\u2019\u2019|",

        "A: Yes, we had a common blanket, this other girl.",
        "A: Yes, but --.",
        "A: No, no. I have to tell you the end of the story. Not end, continuation of the story. I remember\nmy twentieth birthday that was October 13\". It was a very ugly day because somehow later,\nthey brought Polish people to this . Polish people with children. I don\u2019t know from where\nthey came. For instance, the head of the barrack where I was, she gave -- she liked very much\none of these children. She was three years old, the child. She was born in a camp already. A\nbaby girl. She was there with her mother. Somehow, she like this child and she gave her food\nevery day for this three years old girl. That was my anniversary when they collected all these\nPolish children, to kill; to take them away and kill them. The child, this small child, whom I\nknew through this head of the barrack, whom I see often, she was taken away too. Then I asked\nthe head of the barrack, will they kill all the children? And she told, oh yes. Then we knew\nalready what is happening. The big head of the , when the selection was, the big trucks\ncame to the lager and people were just, were black. For instance, after a selection for which\nthey made, nude, the naked people were just thrown on the platform of this van and\ntaken away. These children were just thrown on this platform and taken away. They collected\nthe children, put in this and that was my twentieth birthday.",
        "A: Yes, yes. [\u201cWhere did they come from\u2019\u2019] I don\u2019t remember, from a camp, from a Polish camp\nwhere the family --. Jews born Polish, not all were Jews. The Polish people were not all Jews\nin Auschwitz, but I think they were Jews. You could, the political --, these three angles,\neverybody had a number and these three angles, you see my number. The people who were to\nbe lager, they all got numbers. My mother, never. That was also a distinction. That we were\nmore valuable people, we got numbers.",
        "A: These Polish children? How long were they --? Maybe several weeks, not long. Then I had\none very, an adventure? That was maybe in September. Do you know the name,\nSonderkommando? Have you ever heard it? No. The Sonderkommando, not Jewish but from\nthe camp, who were working at the crematortums. They had hard work but they got enough\nfood but that, after a while, they killed all the people of the Sonderkommando and they choose\nnew one. That was a regulation. That they must be killed because they have seen everything \u2014\nhow they keep people, how they gas them and so on. At one of the crematoriums, the\nSonderkommando knew that they will kill them. Somehow, they had, because it was a factory\nvery close to Auschwitz, that they made something, I don\u2019t know how to tell it, where they\nmade for the guns.",
        "A: Yes, ammunition, yes. It was an ammunition factory and some people were there. Somehow,\nthis Sonderkommando through a girl who was working there, got ammunition. They blew up\nthe crematorium and tried to escape in the commotion. But they didn\u2019t succeed. I have seen it\nbecause it was so that; there were people in the block who had to bring the food for, the evening\nfood. I was just there in the barrack and had nothing to do and one of the girls told me, Eva\ncome and help us to bring the food for the evening. We will get fromesh, it was in boxes, you\nknow, you have to --.",
        "A: Cheese, we will get cheese and to help us to bring the cheese. I went there and we had to wait\nat the kitchen. Beside the kitchen was a small hill and we had to wait there. I went to the top of\nthis hill just tolook at.",
        "A: Of this small hill which was beside the kitchen; maybe it was from garbage.",
        "A: It was a big explosion?",
        "A: A big explosion.",
        "A: No, no. Ihave seen the SS. It was very close, the road, the lager road. The kitchen was close\nto the lager road and I have seen how the SS people are running after the explosion to the\ncrematorium. They were so, it was so unexpected that they were just taken aback in running, do\nyou understand me?",
        "A: It turned out that this was the revolution of the Sonderkommando. They could recollect\neverybody, nobody could escape. They even managed to know who was the girl who gave the\nammunition and they killed everybody, including the girl.",
        "A: I\u2019m sure it was publicly. It was in a different area of the --.\nTape 2",
        "A: That is interesting. As I told you we were not, we hadn\u2019t seen the execution but all the news we\nget, we get to know all the news. It was a communication, how to tell it. . The girl\nwas taken and she was killed too and nobody could escape. That\u2019s it, what I wanted. That is\nwhat I wanted to tell you. It was so that it was the custom or how to tell it, that when they\nbrought new transport with the train, then 1t was blockspera, it means that you couldn\u2019t leave\nthe barrack where you were. You had to stay there all the day, not to see. But somehow, --. I\nremember when they brought new people. For instance, from Slovakia, they first, as ve told\nyou, only the girls were taken away. The unmarried girls. For instance, one, a cousin of mine\nwho used to live there was taken because she was unmarried but two others who were married\ncould stay there. They were taken later on in September from Slovakia to Auschwitz. I\nremember when they brought this transport, when the transport was coming and how few\npeople could enter the lager. Maybe, I don\u2019t know how many they brought. After my mother,\nbecause a sister of my mother used to live in Yeetro and the whole family. I told mother that\nthey were brought, I have spoken to people who entered the lager and so I knew that they were\ntaken and that nobody among them, entered the lager. I remember that I told mother that your\nsister came and her family, her two daughters and husbands, and grandchildren and nobody\nentered the lager.",
        "A: That was in September. Later they brought from this mustalager from the , they brought\nlater people. Then in autumn, I don\u2019t know when they began to empty Auschwitz. They\nwanted to evacuate. They destroyed in the late -- that was later, they destroyed the\ncrematoriums. Only one is left. In the men\u2019s lager in the fall. Because in Birkenu there were\nfour crematoriums. They were not enough. They destroyed all the four crematoriums but that\nwas later. But they began to evacuate. In October, they took my mother from this _ lager. I\nremember it was this blocksperen this closed thing but I was so nervous because of the mother\nand I wanted to know what happens because it was a big selection. Who were found good\nenough, they were taken away and I was told that they will bring them to _ lager but that\nwasn\u2019t true. Who were not healthy enough, they were killed. I remember it was October, it was\nNocterine; the day was not yet cold, it was a nice day. I was sitting 1n a hole all the day. From\nthere I could see what happens in the C-lager where the mother was.",
        "A: Yes, because I was so anxious to see what will happen to my mother. I wanted to see what\nhappens. I couldn\u2019t see much but it was a better feeling to sit in this hole. Then they took\nmother and she was taken to Bergen-Belsen that I knew.",
        "A: She was not there any more. Maybe I have spoken to somebody who knew her but I knew that.\nBefore she was taken away, I have forgotten to tell you that it was a transport and all my friends\nwent with this transport from our block, everybody was taken to work. Some back to\nCzechoslovakia, I learned later. I was starting with them, I went, every transport was the same -\n- that you had to go to the main scrag of the lager and then they selected you and from then you\nwere taken away. I went with them to this place. Then I felt that I can\u2019t go away; the mother is\nhere. I can give her food, I can see her, I can\u2019t leave my mother here and I just escaped and\nwent back. I didn\u2019t went to the transport. Then I was smart then, at that time I was smart\nenough, I knew that nothing will happen. When the number 1s filled, they will take the\ntransport and finished.",
        "A: They won\u2019t miss me. In the evening, I told my mother I couldn\u2019t go away. I remain here.\nSomebody was with my mother and other mother who had three daughters in the group. She\nask me do you know anything about my three girls? I told her yes, they went. She said, oh they\nleft me here. To tell the truth, they were smart. Later it turned out, when I was at home, it was\nyears and years after, I met a girl, I met a girl with whom I slept under one blanket. She told me\nthat this transport was already good. They went to a small town somewhere in Czechoslovakia.\nThey worked in a factory. The work itself was not too hard. The people in these small towns\nwere very helpful. They gave them food whenever they could. Only one person died. It was\nsix hundred people and only one died, one of them with natural -- something happened to her.\nThat was not a bad trip. All the others came back.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know exactly. I was not so interested in that kind of factory. It was maybe a textile or\nsomething. She worked in Tunsaran. She was from Budapest but she worked in Tunsaran and\nso she was as the sister of your friend.. So she was taken away. It was not allowed to commute,\nthe Jewish people couldn\u2019t commute. They were exempt, they saw they are exempt and they\nworked in Tunsaran and they used to leave that. Then the German took everybody who was\nworking in Tunsaran. Tunsaran is a big factory which exists even now in Hungary. The bulbs,\nthey are making bulbs and --.",
        "A: Yes and it was a very important thing and the first Jewish people who worked there were\nexempt. They can stay there and work.",
        "A: It was Ujpest, the suburb. So that is that. It is one of the biggest factories in Hungary. So I\ncouldn\u2019t go away and some weeks later, mother was taken away. I told myself, now it is no\nreason to stay here any more and I go away with the next transport. The next transport where I\nwent, which was chosen, went from one part of the lager to the other part. That was the whole\ntransport. It was the oldest part and all the circumstances were much worse. It was\nAusenkommando, I told you, we had to work. We had to dig potatoes inthe pun __\u2014\u2014_\u2014\u00ab.~ We had\nto put potatoes in heaps and cover with earth. It was raining, everything was wet; all the\npotatoes got rotten. One day we were -- and it was a very heavy work because you had to carry\nit across; it was a hard work. You had to carry the potatoes. One day it was put there, the other\nday we had to remove them from there. It was silly work only it was very, very difficult, very\nhard work. In this potato, I got ill very soon. I was not so strong any more. I never was a\nstrong person and I got ill. In the meantime, the evacuation of the camp was continued and we\nwere taken from this old part of this lager back to where I used to be, back to this relatively new\npart, this B2B where I have known all the physicians. Them I felt ill and I was ill and I sent to\nthese physicians whom I knew and they put me in this rever , you know what arever __\nis, it was a small hospital where ill people could stay as long as they were not selected. At that\ntime, the selection was not as bad any more. After they knew the crematorium didn\u2019t work. I\nhoped that maybe if I can regain force andifI gotothe rev. _\u2014sthat wasintherev \u2018you\ndidn\u2019t have to stay this active (?) because that was awful, to stay and stay and it was cold and it\nwas dark in the evening. What happened to me during this potato work --one day we had\nblocksperesh where we had to stay in the barrack. We had to come back from the potato field to\nstay in the barrack. Ihad one only ___ to sleep, underwear. I hated it, you can imagine. I\nhated it, it was so --. I have worn it day and day and day after this one only thing. We were\nthere and I thought -- I washed it and it was wet. We went to sleep and the wet underwear was\nsomewhere there. It was stolen. So it was November and I had to stay the opel and I had no\nunderwear. Even today, I am very sensitive. I got cold, you notice, the weather and even today\nI suffer with it. Then, it was some days I was walking without this underwear and then we went\nsomewhere there was a bath, where there was warm water and you could take a bath, there and\nsomehow there, we manages to buy for me, I was with a friend together -- I always looked for a\nfriend to have somebody, not to be alone -- and this was a very good friend of mine. We went\nthere and we bought for a bread because we had, in this work, in this potato work, we got more\nbread than usual. We had bread and we bought for me underwear, warm underwear for one\nbread. We put together our -- and then I had it. I remember it was such a cold, I got such a bad\ncold, because to stay out as long without underwear, that I had diarrhea and I had to urinate\nalways, I was really ill. It was while we were standing in the opel and I found that I must go up.\nI told Markget, Pl sit down and I'll manage my work. She began to cry, Eva don\u2019t do it. If the\nGerman will see you, what you are doing, she will kill you. She will hit you, beat you until you\nare dead. I told her, I can\u2019t help, I must. I had the chance, I was not seen. It was dark already\nand so I could manage it. I felt that I must do it because otherwise -- it was stupidity because\nstanding is possible --but I hated it. To get dirty.",
        "A: Yes, then I -- I missed the schedule because that was during this potato work, all these things\nthat we bought for me the underwear and that we had to stand. What I thought then, decided to\never __ this old part of the lager and we went back to this B2B which was one of the best parts\nof the lager. Then the physicians who knew me took me to the revier, to the small hospital. But\nI missed you a very important -- I missed a very important detail of the potato. In this potato\nfield, we worked together, Ukrainian girls who were from the countryside, who were big and\nstrong and for whom this work was nothing special. We used to live in the same block together\nwith them. They were very, very rude with us. In the morning they took -- in Auschwitz you\nare not allowed to drink water, there is no drinking there, many people died because they drank\nthis water and typhus, I don\u2019t know what and died in diarrhea. They took the -- in the morning\nthey brought tea. It was not tea but it was something but it was boiled water. They took this hot\nwater and they washed themselves in it. We remained, we didn\u2019t get anything to drink in the\nmorning, so they were so rude. We had to go to the kitchen and steal tea which is a stupidity to\nsteal boiled water but we had to drink something. If the German see us, that we are stealing the\ntea from the kitchen, it would be a bad story. We had to do it because we knew we have to\ndrink and we are not allowed to drink the water. That was our drink for the whole day. Then\nthey carried a big -- these Ukrainian girls , they were strong -- and they carried many potatoes.\nWe can\u2019t keep up with potatoes in this carriage. She told the German officer, look, the Jew has\nso few potatoes and I am carrying so much. We managed to escape somehow from the German\nthat she couldn\u2019t observe that we are carrying a few, only on the bottom of this thing. But she\ntold the German, look what they are doing. Then we got hit. We were beaten, They were\nreally very, very -- [\u201cSo they were not Jewish\u201d] No, no. They were from the countryside. I\ncan\u2019t help but these are my memories from the Ukrainian girls. They were even worse than the\nGermans with us. That was the end of my working career in Auschwitz, when I got to this\nrevier. I don\u2019t know why, I could do eel and eel. I couldn\u2019t recall why.",
        "A: That was 1944, that was November, late November already. In Auschwitz, there were two\nreviers for ill people, not two parts, two sections. One was the E section for women, it was only\none and F section for men. In the small revier, in B2B, they couldn\u2019t help me and if you are\nmore serious ill, you had to be taken to this E section. I was taken to this E section and later I\nmet one girl of Ujpest, of my town, saw me when I was taken to the E section -- not alone, with\nseveral people. She told me later in Ujpest, I was sure that you are taken to be killed. I never\nthought that we will again meet each other here in our town because I was so upset and I was\nsure that you were taken away to be killed [\u201cWho?\u201d\u2019] I tell you later. I don\u2019t know only the name\nbut several times I have met her in Ujpest. I was taken to this E sector and that was maybe\nDecember already. In January, 18\" of January, and I was bad, and I had malaria because I had\ntemperature; the temperature rose suddenly disappeared. I had four or five of these and I was\nagain without a temperature. I was there with many other people. It is January. It was told that\neverybody who can run, who can walk have to go and to leave the camp. A transport will go\nand it was told that there are no trains, you have to walk. All my clothing was____ wrong, it\nwas greenish, something green and the very same one and a pair of shoes.",
        "A: That\u2019s all what I had.",
        "A: When you get ill, they take all your dresses.",
        "A: Nightshirt and a pair of shoes. But then we managed some and everybody in the revier had\nclothing. But somehow, we managed to get clothes. Then it was not the strict order anymore.\nMy friends brought me some clothes. It was a coat and a Jacket. I got some clothes. Then it\nwas a full day, everybody got a loaf of bread and it was told that everybody who can walk must\ngo. Then we were some young girls and we decided not to go. We thought we are not strong\nenough, we cannot walk. They will kill us 1f we can\u2019t walk. The only chance to survive 1s to\nstay here and to see what will happen. That\u2019s the only chance. If we go, we are sure that we\nwill be killed. We were maybe five girls. We decided to stay and we will see at that time, we\nhad the clothes __ and we will see what will happen. I remember it was a girl there from the\nfirst group whom I knew from the first group when I was first time in the B\u2019s, 2B, and she was\nrather ill. She wanted to go and she decided to go. I told her but you are ill, you can\u2019t walk.\nBut I want to be alive -- that was her answer. It was so funny, I didn\u2019t answer anything but it\nwas that I want to be alive as well. Therefore, I want to stay here and she went. I don\u2019t know\nwhat happened to her but it was so striking to me, I want to be alive. That was her answer. We\nstayed there and we were there more than one week alone.",
        "A: No, two thousand, seven hundred, I don\u2019t know how many, ill people. Everybody was ill and\nsick. Of course, there were other people who had the same idea then. It was a big battle, very\nclose to Auschwitz, a big battle, where Res _ is, very close. At the river, was a big battle. It\nlasted two days. It was on the 27\", we have seen and we have heard the battle. That was our\nchance. We had no electricity in the camp and we had no water. Itwas_\u2014s\u2014\u2014_\u2014sain. the case\nof fire, this water, because there was running water in the camp. It was not anymore running.\nWe had fuel, we had coal to heat, we could heat the barrack. Many people died during these ten\ndays. Because all of them were ill people who stayed there; some of them were well.",
        "A: We had this bread and then somehow, people managed to get from the storage, some food. I\nremember we got beans and we cooked it 24 hours in this fire. It never got soft, but we ate it. It\nwas so old that it -- we just wanted to cook it in water. We had something to eat. was a\nbig thing. On the 27\" when the cannon, in the morning everything it was silence, stopped, the\ncannon stopped and everything stopped. At noon, the first Russian soldiers arrived to the camp.\nThey were wearing this white gown, it was winter. At twelve o\u2019clock, I went to bring some coal\nto heat this, because it was a long, long oven along the whole barrack which could be heated. It\nwas not warm but it was not ice cold in the barrack and we could heat it some of. We went to\nbring fuel and then we have seen the first two soldiers who were coming. That was the first\ncamp where they found living people. People who were alive. They passed already, the\nRussian army, passed already Treblinka and Majdanek and nobody was there alive. It turned\nour that Auschwitz was undermanned too but I had no time anymore to do anything. They just\nrun away, the Wehrmacht army never came to the camp who were fighting back. The SS run\naway and the Wehrmacht didn\u2019t come. In the afternoon came a high ranking officer, a Russian\nofficer, early afternoon. He went in every barrack, it was only two parts of Birkenau. He told\nus that this is a surprise for them; that they can find here people who are living. They are not\nprepared for that. They can\u2019t give to eat anything else but tea and sweet. That they bring as\nmuch as we want and he will promise that in five days we will have everything to eat. That was\nour chance. Because these ill people who were starved, that they couldn\u2019t eat anything else but\ntea and sweet, that was the best solution for them. American and English soldiers made a big\nfault when, for instance in Bergen-Belsen, the English people gave food, rich food for these\npeople. We know it because a cousin of his was there and many people died because of the rich\nfood. Here in Auschwitz everybody had to eat because they had nothing. But in two days, we\ngot food already, not in five, in two days they could give us food. Then they took everybody\nfrom Birkenau to the main lager where the barracks were bleak. It was an old soldier camp\nfrom the Polish army, the main camp in Auschwitz. Everybody was taken there from these\nwooden barracks/ Everybody was -- it was a military hospital for at least ill people. Sorry to\nsay, there were many people who died later on because they were so ill, that they couldn\u2019t be\ncured. I must say that maybe they had not the best and the most up-to-date medication, but they\nwere very, very careful. I got the best treatment, the best care. I thought and I am -- and then\nafterwards I went down. You were elevated. They didn\u2019t have to keep me anymore and I was\nvery, very ill. When I went in my -- four people were very III afterwards and I was one of them.\nI was 27 kilos that was the lowest weight because I couldn\u2019t eat. I got more to eat and better\nthere than anybody else. They couldn\u2019t eat it. I got every day an egg and milk, it didn\u2019t help\nme. What was the most important, I got a weight gain. Somebody had to sit beside me, beside\nmy bed all the night and to tell the physician if I don\u2019t feel well. Somebody helped me, to call\nthe physician. One night, I was really very ill. I remember the physician was standing beside\nme. I don\u2019t remember when I lost consciousness but I remember that the physician stood beside\nme and was feeling,my pulse and asking me do you feel better now? I told her yes, now I feel\nbetter. Because in the evening, I told the person who had to sit beside me, he was a man. That I\nfeel very bad today. I had a very bad day today. I don\u2019t know when I lost my consciousness but\nthe doctor was there. In the morning came, it was called in Russian, a Stiab. It is a German\nname that it was a military staff and the head was a physician and he was a colonel and he knew\neverybody. That was in the night and at 8 o\u2019clock in the morning, he was at my bed and asked\nme what happened to you, in the daytime you were not so ill. I have seen you at noon and\neverything was okay with you and what happened to you in the night that you were so ill? He\nknew everybody and he visited and from that time, I remember, that several times at midnight, I\nawake that he 1s standing at my bed and feeling my pulse, my heart rate. He knew everybody,\nhe was an excellent person.",
        "A: They were taken away in September, from Auschwitz. I was there. I am the only person who\nremained in Auschwitz. They were taken to Mierdoff. It is in Southern Germany, Bavaria,\nSouthern Bavaria. I know because I got everything. My father was dead in December, my\nbrother survived him and my brother died in March, three weeks before they could liberate his\ncamp. Actually he fell asleep during the night. That\u2019s a typical test of the starvation. He fell\nasleep. I know that his heart was very -- because of the starvation and everything -- his heart\nwas not good.",
        "A: It was another camp. I don\u2019t know -- don\u2019t ask logic. There was no logic, one camp was like\nthe other. They don\u2019t wanted you to work; they wanted you to die. In these big camps, there\nwas very few work. It was, then it was like this .",
        "A: Yes. Actually, a cousin who came from Transylvania and who found my brother dead in this\ncamp by chance. He was in camp and he could move. That is a good feeling, he was not\nalone and this cousin could give some food for him. He was very happy, the cousin told me that\nhe is not alone and he had somebody. So this was not so bad. The physicians who were there,\nthey have no wonder that he will die, he is so ill that he will die.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know how. In my opinion, I told you my father was a humanist. He died because of\nillness, that\u2019s my theory, but because that was such a great disappointment for him in mankind,\nthat such a thing could happen, that people can treat people like that, that this disappointment,\nbecause of this, he gave up.",
        "A: I told it at the beginning, I have seen once my father. I told you that was this kommando, this\ngarbage kommando that people, this cart was driven by people. It was at the place where they\ncollected garbage. My father was not in this garbage kommando but somehow he arranged that\nhe could go out from the lager with this garbage. The garbage of our lager was taken there. He\ntold this kapo who was from our lager that she should bring me. What happened because the\nnumber. If you leave, not the person was important, but the number. Ten people are driving the\ncart, they can go, eleven not, but ten can go. I was told go to the garbage kommando; they will\ntake you out and you can meet your father. I met my father. Unfortunately, with the previous\ntransport, my brother was there too, but then I was not there. I could see my father and I hardly\nrecognized my father because he looked like, before Auschwitz like on this photo, he looked so\nyoung, not white hair or nothing. Then he was white and very, very old. Therefore, I tell you\nthat was a disappointment in the whole mankind which took him away and not any of this. I\nmet him in the garbage.",
        "A: Five minutes. You had to bring the garbage and to take it.",
        "A: Yes, yes. Five minutes. This Auschwitz number is 8-13160.",
        "A: The story with my illness. I told you that I was one of the four most ill persons. This Russian\nmilitary hospital was dissolved in \u201945, September. In \u201945 September, I was certified (??)\ntuberculosis already and they took me to Krakow because I couldn\u2019t walk yet. They took me to\nKrakow, the university clinic. Ten more months, I had to stay there. I was there and I returned\nto Hungary \u00b046, the 1\u201c of August. It was very difficult for me to come back, I had no\ndocuments, only one small paper which I got from the Polish Red Cross that I was this number\nand with my name, that I was liberated in Auschwitz by the Russian army. It was written on\nthis paper that everybody is asked to help me get home. In \u201946, everybody was at home\nalready, or everybody died, and I had to walk to Ka____ to the Red Cross and they couldn\u2019t\narrange me to go home, the permission to go home. I went to the council, to a high- ranking\nofficer in Ka___ I know who he was. I was told if I give him sum, I can leave the camp. He\nwill give me document and I can go wherever I want but I have no money. He told me if I go,\nthat the paper that you have is nothing. If I go to the Russian people, I can get the same paper\nfrom them. It is nothing like you have. I was very angry. I decided that I will go to the State\nDepartment in Russian. I have to find somebody who will believe me, that I am Hungarian and\na Jew and I have to go home. From Ka ___, the Red Cross gave me fare, the , to go to\nRussia. I went to the State Department and I went and I found somebody who was responsible\nfor the east European countries. I told him that I am an Hungarian and he answered me\nHungarian. It turned out that during the war he was in Hungary and he had a Hungarian wife.\nHe spoke Hungarian and then he told me that he will arrange me. He began to call everybody\nand he told me that he will arrange for me permission to leave the country. I will get it from\nhim but I have to come back in ten days because he tried to arrange it at once but it doesn\u2019t\nwork. He needs time and I should return in ten days. I went back to Ka___ I was living there\nat the Red Cross. They had such a house there. In ten days, I went again to Russia and I got\nthis paper. Then I had to go to this country official again that he should give me the stamp on\nthis. Then he was very nice and he told me, I told you that you need a good document and that\nis a good document what you have now. Now you can leave the country. So he was very polite\nand very nice with me. I could come home, not so easily. It was funny because it was a group\nof Hungarian people. The most stupid story you have ever heard. It was a family with two\nchildren and I don\u2019t know, with somebody else with two other people who had the same\ndocument what I had. A couple, it turned out that he was a Jew and she was a Christian and he\nwas one of the men who hadn\u2019t got a Hungarian citizenship but he had a Polish citizenship.\nThese people from Hungary were taken away in \u00b041 to somewhere, to Ukraine. They all were\nkilled by the Germans there. Somehow, because the wife told that I don\u2019t leave him to go alone\nand I go with him, somehow, this very simple Christian woman, she could save his life. They\ncame back from Ukraine with the same paper that they got somehow, the same paper what I\nhad. I came home with this group. At the frontier, it was \u201946, the Russian officer didn\u2019t like us\nto enter the country. They say they will have to check who we are. We had to stay at the\nborder; it was joined there already, this Jewish organization from here, from the state. They\ngave us food, they gave us where to sleep. We had to wait there. That was on the Hungarian\nborder. I knew, somehow, these are Hungarian- speaking people who are living in this village.\nI spoke to somebody because in this village used to live the brother-in-law of this boy with his\nsister. They used to live in this village. What do you know about Mr. Mueller, this boyfriend\nwho disappeared in Russia. I asked the people, do you know Mr. Mueller? They told yes, he\u2019s\nliving, the wife is dead but he\u2019s still living. He is in the Hungarian part of the city which is\ncalled Est. I asked, how can I contact him, I asked this man. He told go to the riverside,\nthat is the Danube, everybody knows him in Est__, asked the smugglers. The smuggler\nwill take with pleasure your letter to Mueller because he is a rich man and he will give them\nmoney. If you write that you are here, he will manage somehow that you could cross the\nborder. I did it and it happened that next day came somebody from the other side and looked\nfor me in the joint. I told him that the check \u2014_ I\u2019m not allowed to know that he came to take\nme over. I should insist that I want to go and they will allow me without the permission but\nthey will allow me to go. They will tell that they don\u2019t let me back if I can\u2019t cross the border\nbut I should insist. The Hungarian said he will manage that I can enter the country. He came, I\ndon\u2019t know. We told the wife that he came here. It happened like that, that I crossed the border\nand that the Hungarian say that I was accepted.. He waited for me already for me at the border.\nThat is how I came home. In \u00b048 it turned out that I have -- I had relatives, and in \u201948 it turned\nout --. I always had some pain here and in \u201948, it turned out that itis TB. It was rather\nneglected as I walked with it two years long and I had to go to sanatorium and to lay for two\nyears.
