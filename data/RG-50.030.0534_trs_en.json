        "Question: This is the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview\nconducted by Peggy Frankston, with Joyce Mizrachi on July 23\", 2009, in New\nYork City, and it\u2019s for the Rivesaltes Internment Camp Memorial Museum. Thank\nyou for coming today. Would you introduce yourself, please?",
        "Answer: Okay. My name is Joyce Saltz Mizrachi, and I was born May 13\", 1941.\nWe\u2019re not quite sure; my mother says I was born May 11\", but she wanted me to\nhave my own birthday, so it became the 13\". My name was then given as\nJosefina(ph). Why, we don\u2019t know. I was \u2014 never was explained, except my mother\ndid tell my father to tell them that my name was Judith. He did what he wanted,\nand I became Josefina(ph) for nine years of my life. I don\u2019t remember Rivesaltes. I\nwas born in Rivesaltes, but I do not remember anything about it, of course. I know\nmy mother left Rivesaltes, and I stayed. I was the excuse for her to leave, and she\nalways told me that I\u2019m the one who saved them. The ta \u2014 I don\u2019t know how long I\nstayed \u2014 can you stop it?",
        "Q: Sure. Do you want us to put your glasses on the table?",
        "A: No, I need a prop.",
        "Q: Okay.\nJuly 23, 2009",
        "A: I don\u2019t know how long it took for her to get me back, but I know I must have\nbeen about one \u2014 one and a half? One? I\u2019m not sure. I have been trying to get\ninformation, but I haven\u2019t gotten anything so far. I do have a booklet that was given\nto my mother when they brought her \u2014 when they brought me to her, and it has the\npictures of the women who \u2014 the nurses who took care of me, who were Swiss Red\nCross nurses, and some pictures of different periods, which I still have. We \u2014 after ri\n\u2014 Rivesaltes, we went to Tres, and there I have very few memories. The first\nmemory I have is not feeling well, not being able to speak, and my mother going\nback and forth. I think it\u2019s my mother. And there must have been a little mirror,\nbecause I remem \u2014 that\u2019s the only thing I remember, and I know I was very young.\nAnd then I do remember Tres. Not Tres, Marseilles. We went to Marseilles, it was\nthe end of the war, and there were a lot of air raids, and we used to go to shelters.\nThe one I remember particularly well was the time I locked myself in the room, and\nthe air raids went on and my mother went hysterical and my father had to break\nopen the door. I remember getting a good spanking for that later, and I remember\nwe did go to the shelters. The shelters were very frightening, because they were\nvery dark, to me at the time, they were dark and cold. And I always cried. So there\nwas a gentleman that I remember that we always used to see. His wife was blind.\nThat I still remember. And he taught me how to \u2014 taught me different songs. And\nJuly 23, 2009\nthat, I guess, stopped my crying, which became a pain in the neck to everyone else.\nI remember that. And I remember the different things. I remember being very\nspoiled by a lot of very different people. And I never had what my sister and brother\nhad. I never remember hunger, because I was never hungry. I was frightened\nbecause no matter how young you are, people\u2019s emotions do \u2014 do penetrate, and\nfear 1s very, very noticeable and affective. It affects you. So I was always frightened\nof that. I was always afraid of being taken away. The other thing I remember is that\nI guess it was \u2014 it was a big Catholic organization, and in France the nuns had very\nbig headdresses. I don\u2019t know the order, but I remember we used to get hot\nchocolate there, or something like it. And my mother \u2014 I was so s \u2014 very afraid of\nmy mother leaving me, and being very \u2014 screaming very badly. Those are the things\nI remember, being very frightened. So remember being in back of a woman,\nbecause Marseilles was a very, very rough city, at that time especially, because it\nwas near the waterfront. And walking \u2014 and we were walking behind a couple, and\nshe had her bag over her wrist, and somebody just cutting the bag off. And she\nstood there with just the strap, screaming, and we were not far behind. I don\u2019t know\nif my father was there, because he usually was very good at running after anybody\nwho was \u2014 had to be caught. And that always, always stuck in my mind. There was\na couple who wanted to adopt me, and my mother said, no way. It was a friend of\nJuly 23, 2009\ntheirs, I\u2014 I don\u2019t know, they just figured my mother had two children and they had\nnone, and times were very bad. And she said, probably, I don\u2019t know who they\nwere. I know my friend \u2014 friends of ours that still live in Brussels told Lucie about\nit when she was in Brussels. I don\u2019t know who it was, someday I\u2019 Il go, in the near\nfuture, because they\u2019re rather old, and I have to go and see what they know. Then I\nremember coming to Belgium after the war, going to school. Things were very\ntough in Belgium after the war. Work was very difficult. The anti-Semitism was\nhorrible, very, very strong. I went to school in yeshiva, but because I was very\nrambunctious, not the greatest student, because I couldn\u2019t care less, and I didn\u2019t like\nit. There was an orphanage nearby of all the kids that had lost their parents during\nthe war, and they were sent to France and from France they were going to be sent\nto Israel, eventually, or some other place, or stay in France. And that made me\nvery frightened. And ultimately my mother was asked to find another school for me,\nbecause I was such a wonderful child. They were thrilled to see me go, and I was\nthrilled to get out. And the next school I went to was an all-girls school. It was not a\nHebrew school, it was very \u2014 it was mixed. Very few Jews, and I was one of them.\nAnd the antisis \u2014 anti-Semitism was very much felt when I was told, it\u2019s a shame\nthat they didn\u2019t get you too. And I didn\u2019t know what they were talking about,\nbecause my parents never spoke about it, not in front of me. My father never spoke\nJuly 23, 2009\nabout it til the day he died, til he had Alzheimer\u2019s, then he went back through\neverything. So he never spoke about anything. But I never understood what she was\ntalking about. It was \u2014 1t was tough. Then we came and what we did for\nentertainment was we went to the movies. And I decided that, since I entertained\neverybody anyway \u2014 I used to put on accents \u2014 I had to do that, I felt, because\neverybody was always so grouchy, and that made them laugh. So I entertained. And\ncoming to this country meant that I wanted to know where Hollywood was. I was\nnine on the boat, and it was \u2014 I was thrilled. I was thrilled to come, til I came and I\ndidn\u2019t particularly care for it. I was very homesick, I missed my friends. My parents\ndid not talk about their experience when I was young in front of me. It was all kept\nvery quietly. We came to this country, and my father, who did not want to come,\nonly wanted to go to Israel. My mother refused. She said that she was not going to\nhave us taken away any more, and he had a choice. He either could come \u2014 because\nshe had one sister left, that lived here \u2014 he had a choice; either he came with us, and\nshe was going and she was taking us, or th \u2014 he could go and he\u2019d never see us\nagain. So she blackmailed him into coming, which wasn\u2019t really the best thing for\nhim, because he could never adjust very well to this country. She loved it. And\nevery day I thank her. She did speak about it, ultimately, but he never, ever, ever\nspoke about it. I never knew he was in the resistance. I never knew that he had\nJuly 23, 2009\ngotten people out of the camp, because he was a plumber, and he knew the\nunderground works, where he had to fix things, and that\u2019s how he got people out. I\nnever knew all these things. Everything about him was a mystery, yet he was a\nwonderful father. He was wonderful when we were little, because he managed to\nplay with us like a child, and have the most wonderful stories for us. She \u2014 my\nmother was very depressed for most of the time that I remember when I was sma \u2014\nyoung. I remember her crying a lot. I remember her when her niece\u2019s birthday and\nher nephews, or whoever, always having \u2014 we didn\u2019t have very much money, but\nshe always managed to get flowers next to their picture. And I always think \u2014 I\nalways thought, I don\u2019t get flowers on my birthday, or anything like that. Why do\nthey\u201d? I always had a feeling \u2014 well, it\u2019s my own insecurity, but I was always afraid\nthat she was not my mother, because I used to think, if you \u2014 she got me out when I\nwas one or two, how did she know it was me? Who told her it was me? Children\nchange. How did she know? We stayed at the HIAS when we came, and that was\nreally a shelter. It was a lot of different people from a lot of different places, and it\nwas very much like a shelter, today, I would imagine. There were cots. And my\naunt felt that that really wasn\u2019t proper for me, and I stayed with her. And I was \u2014 as\nI said, I was always very \u2014 my sister and brother do not want to think that I\nexperienced anything. If I say I remember something, they\u2019re very fast to either say,\nJuly 23, 2009\nno you can\u2019t, you\u2019re too young. They \u2014 it\u2019s a form of protecting me, but it\u2019s the way\nthey were.",
        "Q: Sorry, that\u2019s my phone, sorry about that. Pll shut it off.",
        "A: Shall I wait?",
        "Q: Excuse me.",
        "A: For me the HIAS was very exciting, it was very different. And I thought, oh,\nwhat a different place, what a different world. But I soon \u2014 and then we moved to\nRiverside Drive and I went to school. But there were always things lingering, there\nwas always this heaviness that I remember. When I went to school, high school,\nthere were a lot of \u2014 which was Washington Heights, there were a lot of refugees\nthere, and it\u2019s funny how you click. And that\u2019s what you do. Even later on you do.\nAnd the frightening thing was, one of my friends found out when she was 16 that\nthat was not her parents, they were aunt and uncle. She was put up as a child. And\nthat reinforced my feeling that, oh I\u2014 I know she\u2019s not my mother. And I remember\nthinking \u2014 and I know, because I was such a difficult child. I was difficult also\nbecause she was 43 when she had me. I was not exactly what you call a planned\nchild. And I remember thinking, yeah, if I\u2019m gonna have a kid, I\u2019m gonna have\nsomebody like you. Til much later in life that I realized she is my mother because I\nlook just like her. But that could be with adopted child as well. I am ju \u2014 I am very\nJuly 23, 2009\nmuch like her, and I know, I know that who \u2014 that I\u2019m not. Not that it would matter\nanyway, after a certain age. As a mother she was a fantastic mother. She let me live\nand be who I am, which is more than I can say for a lot of children of \u2014 who are\nsurvive \u2014 children of survivors. Because they burden \u2014 there is a burden on you.\nThere is a\u2014 a very heavy burden on you that you have to protect, even when it\ncomes to your siblings, and you cannot do certain things that would upset them too\nmuch, because they were upset enough. But all in all they were \u2014 she really did a\nphenomenal job. She is the reason why we\u2019re alive. She is the one who\nmasterminded everything. But a lot of it was also a lot of luck, because she was\nstopped by Gestapo, and she was \u2014 and he looked at her and he said, I will let you\ngo this time, but if I catch you again, you will not survive. So things like that did\nhappen. She did not \u2014 one thing she did teach me, was not to dislike anybody for\nanything that happened before. And that I\u2019m thrilled about, because I do have\nfriends that are everything different. As I said, she didn\u2019t put all the ugliness on me,\nbut unfortunately we do that ourselves. I don\u2019t \u2014 I\u2019m very careful who I speak to\nabout it. I don\u2019t watch any movies with anyone around me, that pertain to the\nHolocaust. And you get your own things that you have to live through and work\nthrough, but I didn\u2019t have the hardship that they had. For that, I\u2019m lucky too. Okay.\nAnd that\u2019s my story.\nJuly 23, 2009",
        "Q: Thank you. You are happy that came to the United States, and you have a life\nhere. What you talked about, talent for entertaining, and \u2014 that might have come\nfrom the need to \u2014",
        "A: Of course.",
        "Q: Can you tell me one of the things you \u2014 what your career was, what \u2014 what you\ndid?",
        "A: I was a lab technician, hematology lab technician like my sister, because my\nmother wanted me to do that. But when I \u2014 as soon as I made a little money, I went\nto tech \u2014 I went \u2014 decided to try to do acting, cause I did it all along. So I went to \u2014\nhad a wonderful technique teacher, Anthony Menino, have you ever heard of him?\nAnthony Menino? And then I went to Herbert Berghof studios, and I studied with\nBill Hickey(ph). And I did plays. I did different things, nothing major. Then I got\nmarried and for some reason I thought that if I had children I had to be with them,\nwhich was stupid. But I also didn\u2019t have the need that I had before. I\u2019m sorry I\ndidn\u2019t pursue it more, but there were obstacles when I did. My brother, I remember\ntelling my father, you have to do something. She can\u2019t go to acting school. You\nknow what\u2019s in acting schools, they\u2019re all sick. And a few other things. And my\nfather smiled and let him talk and he says, you do what you want. And I did, and it\nwas wonderful, I loved it. I really enjoyed it. And I always said someday I\u2019Il do it\nJuly 23, 2009\nagain, and I just \u2014 I\u2019ve done small things, but nothing like I really wanted to do.\nThat\u2019s my fault, no one stopped me except me. But I found that it\u2019s a great thing to\ndo, especially when I was little, because it really made life so much more bearable. I\nused to go to the movies, watch what they did and I copied the whole thing. The\nonly thing that I remember that really I\u2019m thrilled about, when my father was in the\nhospital, when he was \u2014 had Alzheimer\u2019s, and he was pretty bad, I said, do you\nknow who I am? And he said yes \u2014 and this didn\u2019t happen very often \u2014 you\u2019re my\nchild. I remember how you \u2014 and I \u2014 I remember all the accents you used to do. And\none of them was the Hungarian accent, and of course we spoke Yiddish. So it was\nan imitation of the Hungarian Jewish neighbor, and he found it very funny. And\nstrange, when he was very ill, different things did come out, like sleeping with his\nshoes, because he\u2019d have to run and hide, used to tell us to hide. But that was \u2014 you\nknow, with every hardship and with every horrible thing, there is some good, and\nthere is some nice things that you can remember. For the longest time I couldn\u2019t\nthink of my father because I didn\u2019t want to think of him that way. Took a long time,\nand now I can think of it, and I can think of the nicer parts. For someone who did so\nmuch good, sad to think that that had to happen. But, you know, we\u2019re not\nprivileged. The only way I found out about his family was that we found a cousin in\nCalifornia who was really \u2014 who\u2019s like my third cousin or second cousin. And she\nJuly 23, 2009\nknew all about his grandmother and his \u2014 and my grandfather. I had no idea about\nthem. I had no idea about anything. I found out that my great-grandmother had a\nschool for girls and taught them how to read, in a ghetto structure. But I never knew\nall these things. I never knew anything. It\u2019s almost like being adopted, when you\ndon\u2019t know who your grandparents are really. You don\u2019t know \u2014 you don\u2019t have\nany aunts and uncles, you don\u2019t have any cousins. There\u2019s no one there. The reason\nwe\u2019re So close is because that\u2019s it, that was what we had. That\u2019s who we had to rely\non, that was it. There was no one else. And then we came to this country and I had\nan aunt, and she had \u2014 but her children were much older than \u2014 because she was my\nmother\u2019s oldest sister. And she decided that we were too European, she really didn\u2019t\nwant too much of us. She was a little mentally deranged. And we didn\u2019t see her that\nmuch. So there was never anyone until I got married, and I did marry into a very\nlarge family, and I found that very, very comforting, because my children always\nhad cousins and friends and \u2014 and the whole thing. And it was lovely.",

I never knew that he had\nJuly 23, 2009\ngotten people out of the camp, because he was a plumber, and he knew the\nunderground works, where he had to fix things, and that\u2019s how he got people out. I\nnever knew all these things. Everything about him was a mystery, yet he was a\nwonderful father. He was wonderful when we were little, because he managed to\nplay with us like a child, and have the most wonderful stories for us. She \u2014 my\nmother was very depressed for most of the time that I remember when I was sma \u2014\nyoung. I remember her crying a lot. I remember her when her niece\u2019s birthday and\nher nephews, or whoever, always having \u2014 we didn\u2019t have very much money, but\nshe always managed to get flowers next to their picture. And I always think \u2014 I\nalways thought, I don\u2019t get flowers on my birthday, or anything like that. Why do\nthey\u201d? I always had a feeling \u2014 well, it\u2019s my own insecurity, but I was always afraid\nthat she was not my mother, because I used to think, if you \u2014 she got me out when I\nwas one or two, how did she know it was me? Who told her it was me? Children\nchange. How did she know? We stayed at the HIAS when we came, and that was\nreally a shelter. It was a lot of different people from a lot of different places, and it\nwas very much like a shelter, today, I would imagine. There were cots. And my\naunt felt that that really wasn\u2019t proper for me, and I stayed with her. And I was \u2014 as\nI said, I was always very \u2014 my sister and brother do not want to think that I\nexperienced anything. If I say I remember something, they\u2019re very fast to either say,\nJuly 23, 2009\nno you can\u2019t, you\u2019re too young. They \u2014 it\u2019s a form of protecting me, but it\u2019s the way\nthey were.",
        "A: Shall I wait?",
        "A: For me the HIAS was very exciting, it was very different. And I thought, oh,\nwhat a different place, what a different world. But I soon \u2014 and then we moved to\nRiverside Drive and I went to school. But there were always things lingering, there\nwas always this heaviness that I remember. When I went to school, high school,\nthere were a lot of \u2014 which was Washington Heights, there were a lot of refugees\nthere, and it\u2019s funny how you click. And that\u2019s what you do. Even later on you do.\nAnd the frightening thing was, one of my friends found out when she was 16 that\nthat was not her parents, they were aunt and uncle. She was put up as a child. And\nthat reinforced my feeling that, oh I\u2014 I know she\u2019s not my mother. And I remember\nthinking \u2014 and I know, because I was such a difficult child. I was difficult also\nbecause she was 43 when she had me. I was not exactly what you call a planned\nchild. And I remember thinking, yeah, if I\u2019m gonna have a kid, I\u2019m gonna have\nsomebody like you. Til much later in life that I realized she is my mother because I\nlook just like her. But that could be with adopted child as well. I am ju \u2014 I am very\nJuly 23, 2009\nmuch like her, and I know, I know that who \u2014 that I\u2019m not. Not that it would matter\nanyway, after a certain age. As a mother she was a fantastic mother. She let me live\nand be who I am, which is more than I can say for a lot of children of \u2014 who are\nsurvive \u2014 children of survivors. Because they burden \u2014 there is a burden on you.\nThere is a\u2014 a very heavy burden on you that you have to protect, even when it\ncomes to your siblings, and you cannot do certain things that would upset them too\nmuch, because they were upset enough. But all in all they were \u2014 she really did a\nphenomenal job. She is the reason why we\u2019re alive. She is the one who\nmasterminded everything. But a lot of it was also a lot of luck, because she was\nstopped by Gestapo, and she was \u2014 and he looked at her and he said, I will let you\ngo this time, but if I catch you again, you will not survive. So things like that did\nhappen. She did not \u2014 one thing she did teach me, was not to dislike anybody for\nanything that happened before. And that I\u2019m thrilled about, because I do have\nfriends that are everything different. As I said, she didn\u2019t put all the ugliness on me,\nbut unfortunately we do that ourselves. I don\u2019t \u2014 I\u2019m very careful who I speak to\nabout it. I don\u2019t watch any movies with anyone around me, that pertain to the\nHolocaust. And you get your own things that you have to live through and work\nthrough, but I didn\u2019t have the hardship that they had. For that, I\u2019m lucky too. Okay.\nAnd that\u2019s my story.\nJuly 23, 2009",
        "A: Of course.",
        "A: I was a lab technician, hematology lab technician like my sister, because my\nmother wanted me to do that. But when I \u2014 as soon as I made a little money, I went\nto tech \u2014 I went \u2014 decided to try to do acting, cause I did it all along. So I went to \u2014\nhad a wonderful technique teacher, Anthony Menino, have you ever heard of him?\nAnthony Menino? And then I went to Herbert Berghof studios, and I studied with\nBill Hickey(ph). And I did plays. I did different things, nothing major. Then I got\nmarried and for some reason I thought that if I had children I had to be with them,\nwhich was stupid. But I also didn\u2019t have the need that I had before. I\u2019m sorry I\ndidn\u2019t pursue it more, but there were obstacles when I did. My brother, I remember\ntelling my father, you have to do something. She can\u2019t go to acting school. You\nknow what\u2019s in acting schools, they\u2019re all sick. And a few other things. And my\nfather smiled and let him talk and he says, you do what you want. And I did, and it\nwas wonderful, I loved it. I really enjoyed it. And I always said someday I\u2019Il do it\nJuly 23, 2009\nagain, and I just \u2014 I\u2019ve done small things, but nothing like I really wanted to do.\nThat\u2019s my fault, no one stopped me except me. But I found that it\u2019s a great thing to\ndo, especially when I was little, because it really made life so much more bearable. I\nused to go to the movies, watch what they did and I copied the whole thing. The\nonly thing that I remember that really I\u2019m thrilled about, when my father was in the\nhospital, when he was \u2014 had Alzheimer\u2019s, and he was pretty bad, I said, do you\nknow who I am? And he said yes \u2014 and this didn\u2019t happen very often \u2014 you\u2019re my\nchild. I remember how you \u2014 and I \u2014 I remember all the accents you used to do. And\none of them was the Hungarian accent, and of course we spoke Yiddish. So it was\nan imitation of the Hungarian Jewish neighbor, and he found it very funny. And\nstrange, when he was very ill, different things did come out, like sleeping with his\nshoes, because he\u2019d have to run and hide, used to tell us to hide. But that was \u2014 you\nknow, with every hardship and with every horrible thing, there is some good, and\nthere is some nice things that you can remember. For the longest time I couldn\u2019t\nthink of my father because I didn\u2019t want to think of him that way. Took a long time,\nand now I can think of it, and I can think of the nicer parts. For someone who did so\nmuch good, sad to think that that had to happen. But, you know, we\u2019re not\nprivileged. The only way I found out about his family was that we found a cousin in\nCalifornia who was really \u2014 who\u2019s like my third cousin or second cousin. And she\nJuly 23, 2009\nknew all about his grandmother and his \u2014 and my grandfather. I had no idea about\nthem. I had no idea about anything. I found out that my great-grandmother had a\nschool for girls and taught them how to read, in a ghetto structure. But I never knew\nall these things. I never knew anything. It\u2019s almost like being adopted, when you\ndon\u2019t know who your grandparents are really. You don\u2019t know \u2014 you don\u2019t have\nany aunts and uncles, you don\u2019t have any cousins. There\u2019s no one there. The reason\nwe\u2019re So close is because that\u2019s it, that was what we had. That\u2019s who we had to rely\non, that was it. There was no one else. And then we came to this country and I had\nan aunt, and she had \u2014 but her children were much older than \u2014 because she was my\nmother\u2019s oldest sister. And she decided that we were too European, she really didn\u2019t\nwant too much of us. She was a little mentally deranged. And we didn\u2019t see her that\nmuch. So there was never anyone until I got married, and I did marry into a very\nlarge family, and I found that very, very comforting, because my children always\nhad cousins and friends and \u2014 and the whole thing. And it was lovely.",
