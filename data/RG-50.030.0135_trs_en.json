        "Q: Would you tell me your name please?",
        "A: Eugene Lipman.",
        "Q: And where and when were you born?",
        "A: Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, October 13, 1919.",
        "Q: Okay. Uh...Gene, tell me something about your family and growing up in Pittsburgh.",
        "A: Uh...My father was a small jeweler in the mill district of Pittsburgh, my mother a\nPittsburgher by the way. My father was born in Europe...uh...had and raised children and\nwas the compliant homemaker. Uh...We never had any money. My grandparents,...uh...all\nfour, lived in Pittsburgh until my grandfather, my paternal went off to Palestine. In 1925\nor 6 came back for my Bar Mitzvah celebration, and then came back permanently during\nWorld War II because the idea of the Germans taking over Palestine was an unpleasant\nidea to him and so he came back and he died in Pittsburgh. We are a long lived family.\nMy paternal grandfather was 93 at the time of his death. Uh...I grew up in this mill\ndistrict of Pittsburgh to the age of 7, then moved to the ghetto of Squirrel Hill because I\nhad to go to Hebrew and all the synagogues and Hebrew schools were in Squirrel Hill,\nand I completed my high school education at High School, 40 percent Jewish\nand...uh...finished in 1936, by which time I had already decided to be a Rabbi. And\nstarted the Pitt because I could live at home and go to Pitt. This was depression time. And\nthen in 38...Solomon Freuhauf who was my mentor in this Rabbi business decided that I\nwas wasting my time in Pittsburgh and sent me off to Cincinnati. I went to Hebrew\nCollege in Cincinnati and the University of Cincinnati at the same time. They were across\nthe street from the other...from each other. They still are. And...uh...got my degree from\nUniversity of Cincinnati, finished 1t HUC in 1943, having accelerated a year because they\nneeded chaplains so badly. And...uh...so we went to school for 22 straight months in\norder to accomplish this. No professor would allow us to give up a course. How can you\nbe a chaplain without my course in mid rush five, one of them was known to say. Uh...It\nwas required by the military that you have a year of experience before you can go into\nchaplaincy, and so I replaced a Rabbi in Fort Worth, Texas, who went into the Navy and\nspent a very uncomfortable year there. I was 23 years old and everybody I met in the\nstreet 23 years old was in uniform. Uh...The entire American army was in Texas.\nAnd...uh...I was not in uniform so as soon as I could get into uniform, I got into uniform.\nUh...We had married...in...1943, the day after ordination. It was a long weekend,\nand...uh...by the time I went into the military, Esther was pregnant with our first child.",
        "Q: When and under...when did you go overseas. What were the circumstances?",
        "A: Well, I had decided very early on that my war in World War II was the European theater,\nnot the Pacific theatre, even though I wavered on that because of something I'll mention\nin a minute. But I had really decided that I wanted to go to Germany and I had asked the\nChief Chaplain's office to ship me to Germany. Going overseas was unavoidable. I knew\nthat. And so...uh...1n February of 1945, I got orders to go overseas and didn't get there\nuntil April because that's the war the army worked. The...uh...thing I didn't mention to\nyou was that while I was in Fort Worth, a member of my congregation who had\nrabbinical connections...uh..asked me, right after Yom Kippur services, as a matter of\nfact, if I had ever thought about becoming a pilot. Uh...He taught fairy pilots, the women\npilots.",
        "Q: Excuse me. I want to hold it. And can you stop the tape please? Alright, just hold the tape\nfor a minute and then we'll pick it up. We've had construction problems on the third floor.\nThe sound is coming through the roof. Okay. These people are just marvelous. What we\nwill do, we'll back it from the beginning of that story. I'll ask you to describe... Dean, tell\nme about...uh...the gentleman in Texas.",
        "A: His name was Stanley Herst, and he had rabbinical connections. He came up to me after\nservices on Yom Kippur and introduced himself. We had never met. I had been there all\nof about 4 weeks after all, and said that all his adult wanted to teach a Rabbi to fly and all\nRabbis were chicken. And being 23, I wasn't having any of that and I said, \"When do we\nstart.\" And he said, \"Tomorrow morning at 7 o'clock.\" And (laughter) I said, \"No. I can't\ndo it tomorrow. Give me a couple days.\" Because, among other things, I didn't have a\nflight jacket. And in those days, you had to wear a yellow jacket. You couldn't go up in\nan airplane. They were open. There were no closed airplanes. That's a long time ago. So\nhe taught me to fly in his little piper cub which went 70 miles an hour maximum, and I\nnotified the...uh...Jewish Welfare Board and the Chief Chaplain's office that I was doing\nthis in case it was of interest. And the Chief Chaplain's office was very interested, they\nsaid. So I got my license and...uh...after Chaplain's school, which was 5 weeks we got our\nassignments and I was signed to the armored force. And I thought, you know, \"Typical\nArmy screw up!\" But...uh...It was done deliberately. I found out that they just didn't want\nChaplains flying airplanes. They wanted Chaplains praying for troops. And so I did go to\nEurope instead of doing Island hopping in the Pacific was what they had been talking\nabout. So I arrived in Europe in...uh...April 1945. The...uh...voyage was of interest\nhistorically. I became the radio announcer on the plane...I...on the ship. I probably was\nthe only one who could read English, something of the sort. And several times a day I did\nnews broadcasts, which I had written from whatever material they could garner.\nUh...Historically, I guess the most important thing I did was announce the death of\nFranklin Roosevelt...uh...who died while we were on our way overseas. That was a very\ndiscouraging and depressing...uh...1dea. Who...who was Truman became a very important\nquestion to those of us who were on our way overseas. We also had a...uh... marathon\nbridge game going. It should be noted for historical record that nobody in my Army\ncareer ever suggested that we play bridge for money. Never did. There were eight of us in\nthis bridge game and we cut in and cut out for all kinds of necessary purposes, like sleep.\nAnd...uh...I didn't get a good hand (laughing) in 14 days. Several million points were\ninvolved in my losses. Uh...I also agreed to...uh...box for the only time in my life,\nbecause they were having a series of boxing matches and they couldn't find a heavy\nweight to fight against this lieutenant who was crazy enough to volunteer, but he had\nfought a couple of times before. We sort of sparred around for three rounds.\n[...uh...developed a strep ear toward the end of the voyage and was taken by ambulance\nfrom dockside to an Evac hospital just outside Lahov in France. And the rumor went\naround that this guy I had fought against had beaten me up so badly that I had been\nhospitalized. And...uh...rumor also went around that I was being sent back home again\nbecause I was so sick. I heard that long after I got into Germany. Couple...couple of\npeople were surprised to see me. I was in this hospital for 3 days. The hospital chaplain,\nwho was bored out of his mind,...uh... stole a couple of bicycles and he and I peddled\neach night into this little village where he had met a French couple, and we played bridge\nin French, which was fun. Uh...Eventually, though, that had to stop and I had to get to\nwork. So I...uh...was put onto a troop train headed for Germany. Typical 40 and 8 box car\nand I staked out my little piece of turf big enough for my pack and me, and then I was\nstanding at the entrance to this box car waiting for the train to start and some sergeant\nwas walking up and down yelling, \"Who can talk French? Who knows some French?\"\nSo, one never volunteers, but he wasn't getting anybody and I said,...uh... \"Will some\nFrench do?\" And he says, \"Three words will do. And Colonel needs a French translator.\"\nSo I went back to the Colonel, an old regular Army man, obviously unsuccessful because\nhe was in the transportation corps running these troop trains which didn't require much\nmilitary skill. And he was delighted to see me, and I was moved into his car which was\nnot a box car. It was a heated Pullman car and...uh...I lived very well for 5 days going\ninto France. Uh...My job was every time the...uh... train stopped to tear up to the other\nend to the engineer and ask him what was wrong. And he told me, \"Signal.\" (laughing)\nEvery time, it was \"Red Signal. I can't go.\" And I went back and told the Colonel who\nwas quite content to go on doing whatever he was doing. I had lots of bad books to read. I\nhad a fine, fine trip into Germany. Uh...wasn't wanted in Germany at that time. No one\nknew what to do with me. I was moved back to a town in Belgium called Verea,\nand...uh...as a casual. I did not have an assignment. And then V.E. day came, and we\ncelebrated V.E. day by going from our camp which was outside Verea into Verea to\nwatch the celebration and to celebrate. I was depressed. I didn't feel like celebrating. I\ndon't know why. I...Probably because I was alone, and...uh...couldn't think of much to\ncelebrate as a matter of fact. The world was over, but in the square in Verea, I saw some\nmen and women in concentration camp uniforms. Clearly! Uh...I knew what they were,\nand they were standing over there, and I walked over toward them. They recognized my\ninsignia and crowded around because I was the first American Jew that they had run into.\nThey were Buchenwald graduates, and they were the first survivors of the Holocaust\nwhom I met. Uh... They didn't want anything. I didn't have anything. Uh... But we talked,\nand...uh...they did a lot, my first concentration stories, my first Holocaust stories. They\nwere followed by thousands more Holocaust stories over the course of the next 3 years. I\ndid get an assignment to 22nd Corps Headquarters in the Rhineland. Our town was\nHildan, not to far from Cologne, and I moved in. Large territory, all of the Rhineland,\nincluding Cologne. A lot of troops. Theoretically, we were conducting services for all\nthose troops. I got a jeep and went to work. Early discovered that a lot of German Jews\nand a lot of East European Jews had come into the area not in displaced persons camps,\nbut living on their own where they could find a place to live, which many of them could\nnot do. So I began to do three things. First of all to push military government to find\nhousing for them; second, to see that they got food because they had no source of income\nand they did not get UNRRA food because they were not in a UNRRA installation.\nAnd...uh...some clothing because they were still wearing concentration camp uniforms,\nand that was not a very good idea. Uh...So my services with American soldiers consisted\nof a gang coming together. There were about 10 of these a week, and my saying to\nthem,...uh... \"Anybody need to say cottage, ...uh...there was frequently somebody who\nneeded to say cottage, so we had a short service cottage, and then I said, \"Let's go. We\nneed food. Let's go get it.\" And after the first time in each of these installations, anybody\nwho could beg, borrow or steal a truck...uh...came with truck, and we went to army\ndepots and we got food. Uh...Sometimes was able to sign for it. I have often had a\nnightmare about the army catching up with my memorandum receipts...uh...and they will\nsome day. My great, great, great grandchildren may have a problem with the army...uh...I\nknow that they catch up, because about 1947 or 48, my uncle who fought in France in\nWorld War I got a bill from the United States Army for $45 for a pistol that he had\nsigned a memorandum receipt for in France, and had never turned in. ...Uh...Actually, he\nhad turned it in, but the Army didn't think so. So he had a correspondence with the army\nfor many, many moons about that money for the...I think this was all those years later...so\nsomeday... Most of the time, though, we didn't bother to sign for it. We just stole it. And\nthere were millions of tons of supplies stashed in depots around the area and...uh...they\nshould be used. And they were. We also managed to get hold of some kinds of clothing.\nCouldn't use uniforms, of course, but there was underwear. There were socks. There were\nshoes. There were jackets and things like that. So, we were starting a pretty good system\ngoing when orders came out moving us. Uh...The British were taking over our area.\nThere had been negotiations and most of the Rhineland became British zone. And in\ntypical army fashion we were moved as far as you could get, which was Plezn,\nCzechoslovakia. We packed up and we started across Germany. Before that\nhappened...after we got the notice that the British were coming in and before we left, I\ndecided that I better do something in this part of Germany that needed doing for me. I\nwent to Dachau. Took a 3 day pass and took my jeep and went down to Dachau where\nAbe Klausner, my classmate, ...uh...was working fulltime, and Klausner's a story unto\nhimself, and we'll probably get around to it in the course of this thing. Uh...My reaction\nto Dachau was what exactly what you would expect somebody's reaction to Dachau to be.\nThere was still 30 odd thousand Jews there. Some were dying each day cause there was\nno way for them to make it. Most of them were going to live. They didn't look like they\nwere going to live, but the Army medical people, who are very good by the way, said\nthey were going to live. Abe was in the same business that I was in, only more so as he\nhad this fine clothing for them. I remember the day that he got 38 thousand pairs of shoes\nout of a German Army warehouse just by going in, opening the doors, and taking them.\nAnd...uh...Every day he had people to bury. I...uh...often have said to people who are\nskeptical about the size of the Holocaust that if they would like me to step off\napproximately how many...uh...feet of space it takes in full directions to make a rectangle\nthat would hold 70,000 dead Jews, I know how to do that because I have seen them.\nUh...I stayed those 3 days with Abe and then went back. On the way to Czechoslovakia,\nwe went through Buchenwald. And once and for all...uh...the myths got exploded that the\nGermans didn't know about concentration camps cause when we went into the marvelous\nold town of Yana, and into the wonderful former capitol of the German Republic of\nWeimar, I saw smoke. And I asked what it was, and those were the fires, not\nthe...uh...crematorium fires, but the fires at the Buchenwald concentration camp where\nthere were still people. You could see them. They were only 3, 4 miles away from each of\nthose two towns. I have a funny feeling that when the wind blew the right...blew the right\nway during those years...uh...you could smell Buchenwald without any trouble. We got to\nPlzen, and I settled into my room, and to my office. Uh...Two things happened in fairly\nshort order, one of which is...uh...just of historic interest. The other of which transformed\nmy life. I'll do the easy one first. I got a phone call. It was the Bishop of Plzen, a Catholic\nBishop who told me his name, which I don't remember. And I said to him, \"Sir, I.. (You\nsee he had some English)...that you want my Catholic colleague, Chaplain Straun,\" and\nhe said, \"No. You're the Rabbi, aren't you?\" And I said, \"Yes Sir.\" And he said, \"You're\nthe man I want to come to see, he said, \"You don't have to come out here.\" It was a\ncouple of miles from us to the center of town where the cathedral was. \"I am coming\ndown this evening. I'll stop in.\" And I went to see him. And I met for the first time a\nbishop who looked like a bishop. You know, the long robes, the pointed toes, shoes, the\nwhole business, and he greeted me very warmly and said that he wanted to take me\nsomewhere. Didn't want to explain too much, but that...uh...1t will be a great relief to one\nof his parishioners if I would go with him. I said, \"Alright,\" and we made a date for the\nnext afternoon. We went into the old part of Plzen, which is centuries old. These\nwonderful 4 and 5 story apartment buildings, which looked like a slum on the outside and\nare often very nice on the inside, and I was introduced to a man named Snyder, an\nengineer, who told me the following story. In the building in which he lived, a neighbor\nhad been...Rabbi Katz, the Rabbi of the congregation in Plzen. The synagogue, by the\nway, was still standing. We cleaned it out. It had been made a warehouse, of course, by\nthe Germans, and it was rededicated and used by the Jews who happened to be in Plzen\nduring that time. It may still be used. I have no idea. (Sigh) Rabbi Katz and Mr. Snyder,\nbecame very close friends because they both had an interest in French impressionist\npaintings, and they both collected what they could afford to collect. In 1938, when the\nNazis came in, the Rabbi said to Snyder, \"They are going to take our pictures because\nthey want paintings. They steal paintings. Let's hide them. Snyder, being an engineer,\nwas ingenious, and he took his living room which was 40 feet long, by the way. One of\nthese European saloon-type rooms, and he built a fake wall 3 feet in from the regular\nwall, and that wall was covered with book shelves and other nice things, with one a\ntypical spring door. He took me inside, and there were all the paintings which they had\nstashed away, both Rabbi Katz's and his. His agreement with Rabbi Katz was that,\nobviously, if Katz came back...uh...the paintings would be his...his paintings. If he did not\ncome back, all the paintings would be Snyder's. Uh...He also left some books, and that's\nwhy the Bishop had taken me. His most precious books. Rabbi Katz was killed in\nAuschwitz, his whole family, so there was nobody to inherit either the paintings or the\nbooks. And I took the books at Snyder's request. An interesting group of 4, 5 books. Not\nhis library, just the books he cared most about. One 2 volume set turns out to be precious.\nIt's now in the rare book room of our seminary in Cincinnati. It's one of two copies of this\n1520 Hebrew edition of one of the great classics... uh...1n the whole world. The other one\nis at Oxford. Uh...There were some German poems, beautiful edition, which I gave to\nSylvia. We'll come across Sylvia shortly, and...uh...a Hebrew New Testament, 17th\nCentury, which I gave to the Bishop. And...uh...for myself, I kept and sent home an\nalbum of Visidor Kaufman, a prince. Visidor Kaufman was a fine classical Jewish painter\nof the beginning of the 20th century who was himself Austrian and got interested in East\nEuropean types. And his paintings of East European Jews and East European scenes are\nclassics. And...uh...I have been distributing those to friends, and I have one or two of\nthem. That was my visit with the Bishop, and these books. The same day there was a\nknock on my door and a little woman walked in, in an American Red Cross uniform.\nUh...Sylvia was maybe 5 feet tall, a skinny little thing, very good looking, about 10 years\nolder than I, and she told me the following story. She was a social worker who had been\npart of the social work department at Steven Wise Free Synagogue, which was then just\ncalled Free Synagogue because Steven Wise was still living. And she had worked for\nWises, and told wonderful stories about Steven Wise. When America got into the war, he\nsaid to her, \"You have to go into the Red Cross.\" And she said, \"Why? To feed donuts to\nG.I.'s?\" And he said, \"Yes, because in Europe you are going to be in front line areas, and\nyou are going to be able to help Jews. There will be survivors, and they are going to need\nall kinds of help and you're just the type to do it.\" He was right. She was just the type.\nShe got into the Red Cross. She went to Europe, ...uh...opened one of the first\nconcentration camps in France...uh...organized all of the little kids, and middle sized kids\nwho survived, and that was the transport that went to Palestine legally...uh...after\nliberation. She landed in Czechoslovakia. I don't know how. And was the director of the\nRed Cross club in downtown Plzen. She had four other women working with her. And\nfrom early in the morning till 10 o'clock at night, she handed out donuts and coffee and\ntalked and chatted with American soldiers. Then they closed up for the night, and they\nopened the back door and the Jews started to come in for all sorts of things. Uh...Sylvia\nasked me if I wanted to help Jews. Since that's why I went to Europe, I agreed \"Yal,\"\nand...uh...asked her what was going on. She had been contacted by the Jewish Brigade\ngroup which was in Italy. They had been attached to the British army in Italy, had fought\nthrough the war, and at the end of the war were in town called Trevisio, way up in the\nItalian Alps. Immediately, they organized themselves to work with Jews and they sent\nambulances and they sent trucks over the hills into Austria and they began to move Jews\ninto Italy to get on ships, illegal of course, to go to Palestine, and would I help with this\nenterprise? We could send Jews from Czechoslovakia into Austria and the Brigade would\npick them up and take them to Italy. That sounded like a very intriguing idea to a 25 year\nold kid. Cops and robbers! And so Sylvia and I organized a movement out of the\nAmerican zone of Czechoslovakia. Actually, it was out of all of Czechoslovakia, because\nat that point the border between the American zone and the Russian zone was an open\nborder. We were still friendly. We mutually declared the Cold War only in August of\n1945. So I was given the 3rd language...uh...pass to go anywhere in Czechoslovakia I\nwanted to go for my purposes. And...uh...two things happened. First, Sylvia and I went\nover to Prague. There were 6,000 Jews in the Rothchild Hospital there without a place to\ngo, and new people were coming in all the time. Some from Theresienstadt. First time I\nhad heard of Theresienstadt. Others from further East coming West because they had no\nintentions of living in the East. Uh...Poland was not a place for Jews. Uh...They didn't\nwant to live in Hungary. They didn't want to Czech. They didn't want to live in Europe.\nThey wanted out. And they would come to a Jewish center hoping that somebody would\nhave some ideas about how to get out. They were also looking for relatives...uh...a very\nimportant function. We'll talk about that some more when we come back to Abe\nKlausner. We organized...uh...a way for these Jews in the Rothchild Hospital\nto...uh...receive railroad passes to come into the city of Plzen. From Prague to Plzen is\nonly about 40 or 50 miles. The only way to get there is by train. We then proceeded to\ntype one at a time...uh...passes, authorizing this person a United Nation's Stateless Person\nto travel from Prague to Plzen for the purpose of looking for relatives. We looked around\nPlzen for the biggest stamp we could find. I haven't any idea what it was about, but we\nfound one and got a little bunch of red stamp pads and we put big red stamps on this\nthing and signed the name of a non-existent American Colonel to this document.\nAnd...uh...We would collect them when the people came into Plzen and then take them\nback to Prague because I could travel. And...uh...leave them at our Headquarters, hospital\nand a new group would come. Uh...We wanted them to come a few at a time. We didn't\nwant large groups taking over trains, so they came in every day. And they reported to us\nat the Red Cross Club after 10 o'clock at night, and we drove them out to the Karlov\ndisplaced persons camp which was just on the edge of Plzen. It was an UNRRA camp.\nWe were able to do this because of a rather remarkable coincidence. I went out to the\ncamp to meet the Director and see if we could make a deal for our people to spend some\ntime in the camp. His name was Andrew C. Dunn, and when we met I said, \"Tell me.\nDoes the C stand for Carnegie?,\" and he said, \"How do you know?\" I said, \"Because\nanybody with named Dunn with the first name Andrew, the chances are fifty fifty that\nyour middle name would be Carnegie, and you have to be from Pittsburgh.\" And he said,\n\"Amazing.\" I said, \"Yal, So am I.\" And we talked and he said, \"Lipman. Lipman. Is your\nold man a jeweler?\" And I said, \"Yal.\" And he said, \"I bought my wedding ring from\nhim.\" His assistant, a woman named Fay Green, who many years later became his\nwife...uh...was intrigued by this whole business so he offered a five hundred in his camp..\nWe used for transportation to Austria and the answer was U.S. Army trucks. And who\ndrove them? U.S. Army personnel. Why did they do it? Scotch. And some money. We\ndid not want people doing us favors. We were commercial. Uh...We made a trip down to\nthe Austrian border and made the discovery that the only bridge across the\nDanu...Australian Rivers that we knew about was a military bridge and we weren't about\nto use that. So we went down the road looking for a way to get across that blasted river,\nand we found one. It was an old dam no longer in use, but serviceable and was just wide\nenough at the top for an Army 6-pode to get across with about 6 inches of play on each\nside. And that's the one we used. We went across the dam into Austria and found our way\neither to Lintz or to Gratz or to Saltsport, depending on whether the Brigade told us to\nbring this bunch of Jews. Others, 1t worked. But I have to tell you where we got the liquor\nbecause that involves one of my more favorite memories. I was entitled to a few bottles\nof Scotch a week as a... was a Captain by then. That wasn't enough because we needed at\nleast a dozen to 20 trucks or it wasn't worth taking the chance on the trip. Uh...One of the\nbreaks we got by the way...lots of breaks in this...Massel is not to be considered a minor\nthing. The...uh...sergeant in charge of our motor pool at Corps Headquarters. Now Corps\nHeadquarters has a lot of trucks. It just does. Uh...Corps a big thing. Was a sergeant\nnamed Katz, and he was from Brooklyn, and Sergeant Katz and I made a deal that he\nwould get truck drivers for me and trucks and we would pay with money and Scotch. As I\nrecall, it was 2 bottles per round trip or something like that. But where the Hell do you\nget Scotch in that kind of quantity? And I decided to take a real risk. I went to my senior\nchaplain, a Presbyterian from Kansas, Bird Colonel, full Colonel, but not regular army.\nHe was a reservist. A very, quiet, pleasant man. He said to me, \"You know, I haven't\nasked you any questions, but you travel a lot more than is comfortable for the Chief of\nStaff.\" Cause I was going to all the Jewish camps and communities and people I could\nfind all over Czechoslovakia. I was also going to Theresienstadt by then. We haven't\ncome to Theresienstadt yet. And he said...uh...Chief of Staff has asked...has asked me\nabout this and I said I would investigate it.\" He said, \"I can cover for you if I know where\nyou are going. And you haven't any reason to tell me where you are going, but you will\nhave to or I can't cover for you with the Chief of Staff,\" who is after all a 2-star General. I\nsaid, \"Okay. I'll make a deal with you. When I leave each day, I will put under your\nblotter a statement of where I am going, from town to town to town each day, and then\nI'll give you my trip ticket. And you validate it if you chose to do so.\" He said, \"Of\ncourse, I chose to do so. I know what you're doing and you got to do it.\" He did not know\nthat we were taking Jews to Austria, but he knew I was working with Jewish displaced\npersons and he thought that was absolutely essential. Bless him, said I. He says,\n\"Anything else I can do for you?\" And I said, \"Yal. You're a Bird Colonel. You get all the\nliquor you want, don't you?\" He said, \"I wouldn't know. I don't drink.\" I said, \"I knew\nthat, but you're about to.\" And he listened and he said a couple of people in supply are\ngoing to be awfully (laughing) surprised. I said, \"You don't have to explain what you're\ndoing with it. It's for charitable purposes that you getting into Protestant charities in\nCzechoslovakia which is your bound duty as a Christian.\" And he smiled and he thought\nthat made sense, and I got all the liquor I wanted from then on, on his tab. Bless his heart.\nI was...I heard of his death in the early 50s, and I was very sorry. He was a good, good\nman. He saved my life, and saved Jews. That operation worked very well until August\nwhen...uh...we got caught in one of the Austria towns. Red handed! The whole bunch of\nus! We had not yet transferred these people to the Jewish Brigade...uh...and we got\npicked up. And I got terrible reaming from a General who announced me that he was\ngoing to radio my General immediately, and I would be court-martialed.\nAnd...uh...General Hubner did not court martial me. General Hubner, who was known as\nthe little Patton, was a tough...uh...guy, but he wanted to get rid of Jews. He didn't want\nJews in his territory. I have to tell you the Jewish displaced persons were the only\ndisplaced persons who were difficult. All other displaced persons, and there were 20\nsome nationalities of displaced persons...Outer Mongolians, for example, that the\nGermans imported for labor purposes. They were grateful for being alive, for being fed\nby UNRRA where they ate better than they had eaten most of their lives, and they were\nno hurry to go home. The Jews were not grateful. The Jews were in terrible conflict over\nbeing alive, over having survived. They didn't like anybody very much and...uh...they\nwanted out, and nobody would let them out. And so they caused more trouble than\neverybody else put together. Some of us understood it. We tried to organize it so that it\nwasn't too difficult. In addition, of course, we had all the internal Jewish problems that\nwe always have. For example, within a month of liberation every Zionist party there was\nwas in business, and they all wanted paper for publications and they all wanted\neverything. It was not easy. And these were not pleasant people at that point, and I think\nthat should be understandable that they were not. So General Hubnere said, \"Get them out\nof here. I don't care.\" He didn't tell me that, but that's how he behaved. One incident will\nillustrate this. He called Sylvia and me in one day. Now I had never met General Hubner.\nUh...Captains don't monkey around much with 3-star generals. There are layers of\nbureaucracy in between, and certainly Red Cross women don't have a lot to do with\nGenerals, though Sylvia had had more to do with Hubner than most because she was\nalways making demands. Sylvia was a tough, tough lady. And Sylvia told the\nGeneral...uh...got what she wanted most of the time, because the General didn't want to\nmonkey with the Red Cross. He needed the Red Cross. Those donuts were very precious.\nDonuts and coffee kept American troops going. Uh...He called us in and said, \"I hear\nthere is going to be a Jewish meeting in London to talk about the future of all these\nJews.\" And we said, \"Yep.\" And he said, \"You're going. You go my plane. When does\nthe meeting start?\" And we told and he said, \"Okay. Two days before that, get out there\nand tell them for me to get all these Jews out of here. They should do everything they can\ndo to get them out fast. It's not good for them and it is not good for us either.\" And he\nsaid it not unkindly, but he wasn't smiling. And Sylvia and I flew to London to the special\nZionist Congress that was called in July in London, the chief purpose of which was to set\nthe course that would lead to...uh...Israel's independence 3 years later, which meant that\nBen-Gurion had a fight with Wietzman and Ben-Gurion wiped up the floor with\nWietzman in a 4 hour Yiddish speech which, for me, is pretty unforgettable. Uh...What\ndid he say? He did what Ben-Gurion always did. Ben-Gurion's idea of a speech was first\nto tell the history of the Jewish people, starting back with Abraham and working his way\nup. Sometimes I felt like he was going it minute by minute. Four hours was not his\nlongest speech. Uh...He has made longer. And then rehearsing the Zionist movement\nfrom Belu all the way up...uh...and then minute by minute the events of World War II,\nsubjectively stated so that Wietzman looked like an idiot who played the British and he\nwas the savior who was going to see to it that we had a Jewish State. And they believed\nhim. And Wietzman was really not in condition to do a proper answer. Wietzman aged 10\nyears in 5 days, and he became the old man, the inevitable person to the first President of\nthe State. Powerless and ceremonial. That's what Wietzman became as of that day. Ben-\nGurion became the leader of the Zionist movement. Uh...Sylvia and I did not spend much\ntime in sessions. We spent our time meeting people that Steven Wise told us to meet to\ntell them about Czechoslovakia, to tell them about displaced persons, to tell them about\nthe Haganah, and to urge certain kinds of support, none of which we had yet gotten. I met\nsome fascinating people. Uh...I discovered this Lord Reading. Rufus Isaacs had gout, and\nthat Lady Reading was really a lady and as passionate about...uh...Jewish things as any\nconvert could be and...uh...all the leaders of the Zionist movement wanted to hear from\nus. We were the only people there from the occupied territories. That is, from Germany,\nCzechoslovakia, Austria. Nobody else there. Because nobody could get there. It never\noccurred to them for some reason or other to send some displaced persons over to tell the\nthing first person. There wasn't a single one there. So we were busy. And the General\nmade that possible because that's how he wanted to get rid of the Jews. (Laughter)\nBenevolently! So he did not court martial me. He called me in. Actually, it was the Chief\nStaff who called me in and said, \"We got this TWX from Austria.\" \"Yes, Sir.\" \"What the\nHell have you been up to?\" \"TWX tells you what I have been up to.\" \"We can't allow\nthis.\" I said, \"No, I suppose not. What'll you do.\" He said, \"We're moving you so you\ncan't do it.\" Alright, that was fine. Sylvia could keep the thing going and then other\npeople took over. So far as I know some transports continued to go until the communists\ntook over Czechoslovakia.",
        "Q: I would like to halt a minute.",
        "A: Yal.",
        "A: Go back to London.",
        "A: Yal.",
        "Q: Uh...Something else happened, I believe, when you were in London. You met Leo Beck.",
        "A: Huh? That has to do with Theresienstadt so we have to start.",
        "Q: Let's go back. Go back and do Theresienstadt because that leads to Leo Beck*.b-HP",
        "A: Yal.",
        "A: When I got to Prague the first time, I discovered there had been a concentration camp at\nTheresienstadt, or as the Czechs call it Terezin, north and a little bit west of Prague. So I\nwent there. There was still 16,000 Jews there with a Russian unit...uh...running the camp\nbecause it was in a Russian zone. And...uh...Theresienstadt was exactly what...uh...all the\npictures have ever shown it to be. It was an army barracks...uh...and wasn't bad, because\nTheresienstadt, I remind you, was the show-off concentration camp. That was the place\nthat the Red Cross came to. The International Red Cross was not exactly heroic during\nWorld War II, but they would go to Theresienstadt and make inspection...inspections and\nthen send out a report saying the concentration camp was fine. They had a band and gave\nconcerts and they had classes and they did all sorts of things. What they didn't say is that\neveryday transports left for the east and that none of those people survived. Leo Beck had\nsurvived by accident, by the way. There was somebody else named Beck in the camp,\nand they got mixed up and they sent that Beck off to East instead of Leo Beck. Leo Beck\nhad left by the time I got there. The Russians had flown him into the British zone, and the\nBritish had flown him to London where his only child, a daughter, lived. And...uh...We\nproceeded, the Russian and I, to make a very simple deal. He wanted to close the camp.\nWe wanted to close the camp. UNRRA had agreed that they would take this people to a\ntown called Begendorf in the American zone. It was just a case of getting them there, and\nI had trucks. So we made a deal to move all the Jews out of Theresienstadt to Begendorf\nand here I have to tell you another one of those absolutely uncanny coincidences. All of\nour conferences, the camp commander and I, took place in the presence of a third person\nwearing a plain uniform who was the Commissar, the political leader, and he ran things.\nHe sat there. Fortunately, he knew virtually no German. The only language the\nCommander and I had in common was German. Mine was fairly bad, and his was even\nworse. So we were talking German to each other, making ourselves understood and then I\nheard a word in a sentence that this man was saying, which was not German. It was a\nYiddish word with a Hebrew origin. Aw, said I, He has just sent me a signal. So in my\nnext paragraph, I carefully used a Yiddish word that had a Hebrew origin. Neither of us\nblinked an eye lash, but we both knew why he was going to work his head off to get those\nJews out of there and he wanted me to know why. I had a Jewish camp commander.\nNever again in the whole time I was there...those...almost 3 months did he allude to it.\nWe were never alone. The Commissar never let us alone. If I went there for lunch, the\nCommissar had lunch with us. He was with us every minute that I was in Theresienstadt.\nCame the last day. The last transport leaving Theresienstadt for Dagendorf, trucks all\nlined up, my jeep ready, my driver excited, Vic, and...uh...suddenly was a scream toward\nthe back of the transport, somebody yelling \"Halt.\" And a woman, I remember her, a kind\nof heavy set lady climbed out of the truck and started to run toward one of the buildings.\nSo we followed her, the Camp President and I. She went into the building. She went\ndown some steps, around corners, down some more steps, way down into the bowels of\nthe earth, and came to a...what looked like a piece of metal covering the wall, only it\nwasn't. It was a door. And when we went through that door, we were in the\nTheresienstadt synagogue. And...uh...1t had not been completely cleaned out. There were\nsome things there, and we took them. One of the things was a Megillah, of Esther. And\nthey wanted to give it to me, and I said, \"No, that I thought it belonged to Leo Beck.\"\nWhether or not it was his, it should be his. They all agreed that was so. He was a hero in\nthe camp, by the way, because he had organized all those classes. He had insisted after\npulling his garbage truck all day that you could not let your mind go to waste, and he had\norganized what amounted to a university. Anybody who could teach anything taught it.\nAnd he taught it. And that was...uh...accepted by these people as terribly important. And\nso he was...there have...there has been some statements about Beck's status in the camp as\nbeing something less than heroic, but not in my conversations with people in that camp.\nThey really respected this old man. So I said I would take it to him, that one way or\nanother eventually I would be going to London or I'd send it or whatever. So when I went\nto the Zionist Congress in July, I took the Megillah with me, wrapped in a piece of\nplastic, and I called, spoke to his daughter and made an appointment to see him on a\nparticular day I don't remember. When I arrived, I was taken through the house to the\nback garden. It was a little back British gardens which are so nice. And...uh...Leo Beck\nwas a bit of a ham, and my later experiences with him confirmed the fact that he was a bit\nof a ham. He was sitting...uh... reading something in profile. He had a marvelous profile,\nand the sun was shining directly on to him. (Laughter) And we talked for awhile. I had to\ngive him condolences. His niece...uh...had been killed in a truck accident on the way out\nof Theresienstadt, the only on toward thing that we had in our Theresienstadt transports.\nA truck slid into the ditch and she was killed. His great niece was okay though. Her\ndaughter! And we talked about that for awhile, and this young lady's future and I gave\nhim the Megillahe. And he looked at it, and he looked at it, and he said, \"I don't want\nthis.\" I said, \"Why not? The people wanted you to have it.\" He said, \"No. If I have it, it's\na museum piece. The Megillah should not be a museum piece. It should be a living\ndocument. It should be read. It should be read by Jews. This one being the Theresienstadt\nMagila should be read under circumstances which connect the story of the Megillah with\nTheresienstadt. You take it. Only you promise me that that's how it will be used.\" And I\ntook it. I had a box made for it by a Holocaust survivor when I came back. Actually, I\ndidn't have it made until I got to Washington. And a woman named Friedal Blumenthal, a\nsuperb silversmith, made this box. The box 1s teac and she has ornamented it with\nappropriate symbols and the fact that it's a Megillah of Theresien. It is now going into its\nsecond generation. When I retired, I gave it to my son who happens to be a Rabbi, and he\nuses it in his congregation and he has made a...an arrangement with the Holocaust\nMuseum that it will be on display here for part of each year. That's my first meeting with\nLeo Beck. Later, he taught me. He came to Cincinnati in 1948, and from 1948 until his\ndeath in 55, I think it was, he taught one semester each year at the college institute in\nCincinnati and the rest of the year was in London where he lead the World Union For\nProgressive Judaism. First rate lecturer and a bit of a ham. Uh...Now where do we go\nfrom here?",
        "Q: What I want to do from here is to go back? Uh...I want to...I do not yet want to leave\nCzechoslovakia. Uh...And I would like to know... You worked so closely with the\nHaganah, and you worked with Berichah. I would like for you to talk a little bit about\nthat. Uh...Tell us who you worked with and what those relationships were like.",
        "A: Okay, then I'll have to talk about the girls too.",
        "Q: Yes. I want to do all of them.",
        "A: The people I worked with were primarily my American truck drivers. Andy Dunn and\nFaye Green at Camp Karlof...uh...1 don't remember the names of anybody from the\nRothchild Hospital, but there was an office there in which these documents...uh...which\nwe did about 4 or 5 hundred eventually, these one-page things with the red stamp, that\n...uh...got these people. They never had trouble getting from Prague to Plzen traveling.\nEven after the...uh...cold war was declared, and I had to go back roads my last couple of\ntrips to Theresienstadt, by the way. I could not just go across. I had to go through a back\nroad that I found to get to Theresin and then I could get to Prague and then I had to go\nback to my road to get back into the American zone because the Russians would no\nlonger let us travel. My 3\u201clanguage pass was no longer acceptable. Even after that, United\nNations displaced persons traveling from Prague to Plzen for the purpose of looking for\nrelatives had no trouble getting through the border crossing at Brockisoni. So I don't\nremember names very well. I remember nobody from the Jewish Brigade group. Sylvia\nhad made contact with a man named, who had been a Captain in the Jewish Brigade, and\n, an attorney and I heard of him subsequent over the years. I never met him. So I had no\ndealings directly with him. I dealt with whoever happened to come across with the\nambulances or the trucks or the combination that was taking our people from the town in\nAustria across to Italy. It was pretty much a...uh...two-person operation, Sylvia and me.\nSylvia worked day and night. She was absolutely incredible in that Red Cross thing of\nhers. Her four people, the other women knew exactly what was going on, and they helped\nas much as they could. They wanted to. They were nice, healthy American kids\nwho...uh...got a little bit bored listening to G.I. stories from 9 o'clock to 9 o'clock and\nhanding out donuts and coffee, which is all Red Cross...un...canteens served. They got\ntired making those donuts too. So...uh...I didn't have a great many...uh....Berichah\ncontacts then. Later it...uh...1t changed drastically. But, the Czechoslovakia thing was\npretty much as I have described it. Uh...One ...uh...group of people I really have to\nmention because they become so important to me. Shortly after we got to\nCzechoslovakia, I kept hearing about places where there were Jews and that's why the\nChaplain had such trouble with my trip tickets because I went to all these places. And\nincidentally managed to show up at all the American Headquarters I was supposed to go\nto. There was a town in, a town in the southern part of ... And I heard that there some\nJewish girls there. Women! And I went down there, and sure enough, there were. Nearly\n400 of them in a hospital. They had been in a labor camp in Germany and the Germans\nwho were really suicidal about Jews had put these women...more than 400, nearly a\nthousand.... on to a train and sent the train east. Toward the end of the war, they did that\nwith a lot of Jews. Their minds, I think, going like...we don't want the Americans to find\nthem. It will be better for us if the Americans don't find them. These women got as far as\nSuchita when they couldn't get any more fuel for the train. So the engineer abandoned the\ntrain, and there they were. Somebody opened it up because they heard screams\npresumably, and they buried the dead and put the rest of them into this hospital. I went\nthere and met these women. They wanted a service, so we had services, after which one\nyoung woman came up to me, introduced herself in quite good English, told me that she\nand her three sisters and three of their friends, all from Krakow, had been together\nthrough the war. Turns out that she mama'd this group and saved them through the war.\nAnd...uh...they wanted to get out of the hospital. Was there any place they could live?\nBecause she had been offered a job with UNRRA, and one of the others was going to\nthis, one of the others was going to do that. They all had plans for living in Suchison, so\nwe got them a house. And...uh...they became my kids. Uh...The word kid is funny\nbecause Erna is really only about 5 years younger than I am, and the man she married\nwas older than I. But...uh... They're my kinds. A little later...uh...the job situation was such\nthat they would do better in the Bavarian town of Tishinroit, so they were moved to a\nhouse in Tishinroit, where they lived until they came to...well, 1946, Bronya, now Betty,\nmarried Henry and they moved to Australia where his only living relative was, and they\nare still there and we still correspond. I have not seen them since 1946. Uh...Dora, who\nwas the housekeeper....she was the domesticated one of this crowd...married Borrof, and\nthey disappeared in the wilds of Brooklyn, where he is a Hasid and does not permit his\nwife to have much to do with the rest of us. But Dora manages to call Erna periodically to\nmake sure everybody is alright and to send her love. The other five have been together\nconstantly ever since. They all came to the United States. They all married. Two of\nthem...three of them married in Europe. I officiated at all three marriages.\nAnd...uh...some of the kids were born in Tirsenroit, including a pair of twins, who are\nnow both M.D., Ph.Ds doing extraordinary work. Uh...They've remained my family to\nthis day. Uh...Interestingly enough, the one who was not their sister...uh...married their\nuncle. They had a very uncle, and Maguska married him. So we've been through a lot of\nthings. Births, Bar Mitzvah and a couple of deaths. Remarkably few deaths, I am glad to\nsay. And we are still in routine communication. Uh...Erna's marriage was rather\nmiraculous because in the concentration camp, she had met a woman who had said to her\nthat she was absolutely perfect as a mate for her son. And after the war she married that\nson, a physician who had a successful practice in Syracuse. The coincidences are such.\nAnyhow, that's my ...",
        "Q: We need to break tape. Let's change tapes at this point.",
        "Q: Okay. Uh...We are still in Czechoslovakia, and you said there was a story that you\nwanted to tell me.",
        "A: Not everything that happened in Czechoslovakia (clearing throat) or anywhere else was\nupbeat. There were problems. There were tragedies and there were horrors. Uh...I'll tell\nyou a horror story just because it happened. The Karlov camp was our salvation, but there\nwere problems there too. One middle of the night, I got a frantic call from Andy Dunn to\ncome out immediately, so I went over to the camp. It seems...uh...a Kapo had turned up in\nthe camp. A Kapo was a Jew who worked for the Germans or Poles in the concentration\ncamp, and if the Jews hated anybody more than they hated Germans and Poles and other\npeople, they hated Kapos. Somebody recognized this Kapo in Karlov that night, and they\nhad killed him and they just tossed his body over the fence outside the camp, and the\nbody had been found. And poor Andy didn't know what to do with a dead Kapo, and that\nwas understandable. And...uh...It seemed to me that to inform the Czech authorities was a\nbad idea. So we just buried the guy. And...uh...he, like many other Jews, lies in an\nunmarked grave. My own feelings that night made that one of the low points of the entire\n3 year experience in Germany. Uh...It's not my only Kapo experience. We had another\none, but...that Jews could kill somebody, another Jew. No matter how terrible the other\nJew was, with no due process of any kind, outraged me and upset me and scared me.\nBut...uh..1t was another lesson to be learned. Let's go from that to a birth. A woman came\nto Sylvia, Hungarian Jewish girl who was very pregnant and who didn't want the baby.\nThe father of the baby was a concentration camp guard. Following liberation she had met\na man, a Hungarian, who wanted to marry her, only he wouldn't marry her with the baby.\nIt didn't bother him that she was pregnant. After all, she had nothing to do with that\nreally, but...uh... he wasn't going to raise that child and neither was she. What should we\ndo with this baby about to be born? Sylvia said, \"Give it to me. I will somehow get it to\nthe United States. I have a sister who does not have children. That will be her child.\" And\non June 1...July 1...July 1, 1945, this baby was born. A little girl. And the doctor who\ndelivered her, I remember his name. Interestingly enough his son, who was very young at\nthe time, became my friend because of this incident and the son died in California just\nabout 2 weeks ago to my sorrow. Uh...Here was this baby. The mother agreed that she\nwould keep the child until she was ready to leave for Hungary. Five days later she came\ninto the club after 10 o'clock one night and said, \"I can't do this. I have no interest in this\nbaby. Why should I waste time looking after this kid? Here.\" And handed a baby to\nSylvia. Sylvia and four Red Cross girls found themselves the mother of a 5 day old baby,\nand I became it's sort of surrogate father. The child lived in the Red Cross Club. The five\nwomen took care of her. The...uh...story of how we found... Well, bottles were easy.\nCoke bottles worked fine. You sterilize a coke bottle, and we had lots of coke bottles\naround. Nipples were harder to find. It took almost a whole day of tearing around\nCzechoslovakia until we found one nipple for this kid that would fit a coke bottle. That's\npart of the problem. (Laughter) It was big enough for a calf as a matter of fact, but the\nbaby thrived on it which is what mattered. We had no trouble with the other necessities\nfor a young baby. And then in very dramatic fashion...uh...Sylvia had to come home on\nemergency in the summer of 1945. Her father was desperately sick and did, in fact, die.\nSo she got emergency leave to go home and she packed up the baby in a bed roll and took\nher along with her. When she got to Scotland to get on the Transatlantic plane they\nwanted...uh...baby's not on the manifest. And Sylvia said, \"Who puts 2 month old babies\non a manifest?\" \"Where did you get the child.\" \"It's my child. I had a baby.\" And she\nbluffed her way through immigration into the United States. And her sister got the child\nand the child is, I understand, very healthy and alive. We changed her birthdate. On the\nbirth certificate, which...uh...happened under extreme circumstances also, it must have\nbeen...oh...a year later, I guess. No....a year and a half later, I got a frantic letter from the\nchild's mother saying, \"We're trying to complete the adoption and the court will not put\nthrough the adoption without a birth certificate. Get me a birth certificate.\" The\ncommunist had taken over in Czechoslovakia and I wasn't about to go to Plzen trying to\nget a birth certification. So I went to my Commanding Officer and I said to him,\n\"Colonel, is it true that all camp commanders and post commanders are notaries.\" \"Yes.\"\n\"Would you notarize a document for me?\" \"Yes.\" So in my name, I wrote a statement\nabout the circumstances of this child's birth, never alluding to the child's name or mother\nbecause I wasn't going to lie...uh...not in a sworn affidavit. I'm a funny American...uh...in\nview of the stories I am telling you, it sounds strange that I would lie in an affidavit, but I\ndidn't want to. So I wrote it very carefully. Told the circumstances of the child's birth and\nthe movement to the United States, and...uh...civil affairs were not exactly in order Plzen\nin July of 1945 and there was no birth certificate, and would the court please accept this\nsworn affidavit in lieu of a birth certificate, and they did. And so the adoption was\ncompleted. Uh...That's one of my nice stories. I hope you can get to Sylvia to get the rest\nof it because she tells it beautifully and I don't want to tell more because the young lady\nis around. The young lady and I have no contact whatsoever. I have not tried to keep\nthese kinds of contacts. Okay. Let's now go to the USO. We'll finish up Czechoslovakia.\nUSO tours were very important, especially during the occupation period. American\nsoldiers were bored, and these entertainers came and...uh...you know, you've seen\ntelevision pictures of Bob Hope and the crowd he gets. Well, every group that came over,\nno matter how mediocre got this kind of reception. I was called in by our special services\nofficer in Plzen and asked if I could do them a favor. I said, \"What do you want?\" He\nsaid, \"Well, we have a strange USO group coming over. They have let it be known that\nthey will not under any circumstances do the job they're being sent here to do, namely to\nentertain American troops, unless they can also go to Jewish displaced persons groups.\nAnd they're important people. So I want to indulge them. Can you help me.\" I said, \"Yal.\nI can help you. I can make arrangement for concerts and appearances in Jewish DP\ncamps.\" \"Alright, they are arriving day after tomorrow. WIII you meet them at the hotel?\"\n\"Yes.\" And I walked into a room which contained, and now I am name dropping, the\nonly time I shall do this I hope, Ingrid Bergman, Jack Benny, Larry Addler, the world's\ngreatest harmonica player and Martha Tilton of whom I had never heard till then, but who\nturns out to be a very good pop singer. And...uh...they said to me that they wanted to do\nthis. I said, \"What do you want to do for these Jews?\" \"Leave that up to us.\" And I took\nthem in a command car for one solid week during the day. After all American troops\ncould not be entertained...until 11:00 in the morning or 2:00 in the afternoon, they were\nsupposed to be working. But Jews were sitting around. They spent their days entertaining\nJews, and their evenings entertaining American troops. And they were magnificent. They\nwere absolutely superb. Jack Benny's Yiddish was quite good. Larry Addler's Yiddish\nwas quite good. Uh...Ingrid Bergman talked to them 1n a broken kind of German which\nshe broke deliberately so they wouldn't think it was Yiddish, and (laughter) they knew it\nwasn't and...uh...I[ had a wonderful time for a week. I really did. I was...uh...the only\nspectator at about | o'clock one morning to a recital in which Jack Benny played the\npiano and Larry Addler played the violin. I wish I had a tape of that one. I wish the world\nhad a tape of it. It was a really spectacular experience, and I developed enormous regard\nfor those four people because they really knocked themselves out for these Jews.",
        "Q: Okay. Uh... You were done with your Czech tour in Czechoslovakia and you were sent to\nGermany?",
        "A: I was exiled to Germany.",
        "Q: You were exiled to Germany.",
        "A: Yes. I was...uh...assigned to the 4th Armored Division, one of its combat commands. In\nthose days a armored division consisted of three combat commands. I was assigned to\none of them in a little town not far from Regensburg. And...uh...1t didn't take long to find\nJews. There were 2,000 of them in Regensburg, not under UNRRA auspices, which\nmeans they needed everything in the world and we had to work there. One of the things\nwe got them was a building, a Jewish Center. It had an auditorium. It had offices cause\nthey organized. Two thousand Jews are either organized or you have chaos. One or the\nother! By this time, incidentally, it's the very end of August 1945. And I was very\nworried. We had inadequate food for these people and no money to get food. I had\nwritten to the JVC in Paris, trying to get money and we could buy food, and...uh...was\ntold no, this was not the way they wanted to do business, that they would be coming in\nwith their people and they would take care of everything. Meanwhile, we had hungry\nJews. Uh...I guess the first thing to tell you 1s the meeting of Chaplains, which happened\nshortly after I got to Regensburg or... I am going to call it Regensburg. It was really a\nlittle town called Zoul, but it doesn't matter. Uh...Got instructions to be Munich at a\ncertain time to meet with the Chair of the Commission of Army and Navy Chaplaincy of\nthe Jewish Welfare Board of the late Rabbi Joseph Lipstein, an orthodox rabbi, and with\nRabbi who was a director of that commission, who was a reform rabbi. And we all\ngathered in this hotel room in Munich. My guess is there were probably 30 or 40 of us.\nUh...There were about 90 Jewish Chaplains in the American Zones, but they weren't...he\ndidn't meet them all at once. He had met some in Frankfurt and he met them...I don't\nknow where else. But he met us in Munich, and that was the first time I had seen\nKlausner...uh...since Dachau because I had just gotten back to Germany, and had not had\na chance to go down in Munich to see him. And...uh...I'll never forget Lipstein. He\ngreeted us and he said, \"Now Gentlemen, my report to the Jewish Welfare Board on\nChaplain activities, I wrote on the plane coming over. It was easy. Now I want to know,\nand if you trust me, don't hold back. Tell me what's going on.\" And we looked at one\nanother, and we decided we'd tell him. So we told him. We had lots of problems, and\nnothing to deal with them with. Uh...Abe was the most outspoken and said the most\nbecause he had the most experience by then. I should tell you that by then, you see, he\nhad organized the Central Committee of Displaced Persons in the U.S. zone of which he\nwas the president. And he had departments set up. They were doing health work. They\nwere getting food and clothing where they could scrounge it, and I guess most of\nimportant of all, they were doing a relative search. Uh...Abe published five volumes of\nnames of survivors which sat in Munich in the old Dorchus museum which was his office\nthen and on the walls of this building...I wish we had pictures of it...I think he does...are\nthe names of thousands of Jews and where to find them so they could find relatives. And\nrelatives were found this way. It was a very inefficient way, but it was the only way we\nhad so we used it. And...uh.. during that meeting with Lipstein not participating, the\nchaplains decided that our people had a right to clothing, and they weren't getting it and\nthere was no indication that when JDC or anybody else would come in to give people\nclothing who weren't in DP camps. And even in some DP camps they didn't have\nclothing. They particularly didn't have clothing for children. Our people were beginning\nto have kids if you can count. And...uh...we decided we would use a technique which was\nlegal which the Army permitted. You in the United States could send to any soldier\nanywhere in the world a 11-pound package of food and or clothing...uh...to his A.P.O.\nnumber, and you could send as many as you wanted. So each of us wrote letters, and we\nsent them to everybody we knew. I sent them to every Rabbi I knew. I sent them to my\nfamily. I have a large family, and all my friends and everybody else I could think of.\nSend packages. And God helps us, they began to come in. Tons. By the end of October\n1945, I had 80 people working full time in a warehouse in Regensburg on just the stuff\naddressed to me, sorting this clothing, throwing away some of it I am sorry to say or\nusing it for smotas and fixing that which was repairable and getting it cleaned and once a\nweek I visited all of the 31 camps and communities in my part of north Bavaria\ndelivering sacks of this stuff. I began to worry about my post office. So I went to my\npostal officer and I said, \"People in the United States are sending me a lot of stuff as you\nknow.\" He said, \"Yes, Chaplain, I am aware of it.\" I said, \"How about it if I make it easy\non you and I send a truck down here everyday to pick up the stuff so you don't have to\ndeliver it.\" \"Oh, that will be wonderful. Thank you.\" He didn't ask a question. I didn't\ngive him any information. (laughing) I just sent the truck, and we got our stuff.\nAbsolutely incredible quantities. Tons and tons of clothing. Now people began to ask\nquestions. We give contributions to the Joint Distribution Committee which is supposed\nto be doing relief work all over the world. How come we get asked by the Rabbis for\nthese packages? And that must have been....must have been embarrassing to JDC but by\nthat time, I am afraid we weren't very sympathetic. Uh...When they came in, they came\ninto my territory...uh...no...they came into Munch in August...three social workers. Not\ncarrying a stitch of anything with them, and no budget for anything. Klausner got them\nhim a house. As he had a house in Munich and he brought them into his house, and that\nbecame their headquarters cause they had no place to work. They were credited to\nUNRRA, but UNRRA didn't supply them with anything. It wasn't UNRRA's job. It was\ntheir job to be supplying. These people were absolutely unprepared for what they were\ngoing to do. They didn't know anything about relative search. They didn't know anything\nabout getting people out, if you could get people out. They had not been trained. Of\ncourse, neither had we. One of the astounding facts of my life is that those of us who\nwent to Europe got absolutely no orientation from anybody about what we were going to\nfind when we got there. None. Not from the JWB, which...whose job it wasn't, but not\nfrom the other agencies either who really might have gotten a hold of us before we left\nand said, \"Hey, you're going to run into A, B, C. and D, and contact so and so and so and\nso, and at least know the address of the JDC office in Paris which none of us had.\nSo...uh...those relationships...uh... were either strained or good, depending on the\npersonnel. Two of the three people who came to Munich were magnificent as people.\nCeil Wineburg, I shall always...married a man...uh...died in Detroit, was superb. And she\nwouldn't leave Europe. She got so attached to those people and their needs that she must\nhave stayed 5 years. Uh...The other one, a girl named Debbie, I am sorry to say died in\nEurope...uh...a defective heating stove...uh...in her room. This happened in 1946. So.",
        "A: Another thing we had to do...",
        "Q: Tell me more about JDC and this.",
        "A: (Sigh) Well, I was lucky. In late October, early November, there came to Regensburg, a\nfull time JDC person named Joe Levine, who now lives in Fort Wayne, Indiana, deeply\ndevoted, cared about these people and did everything in the world that could be done. He\neven learned how to scrounge, and he learned how to steal, and he learned how to send\nfor this and that not through JDC channels, and eventually JDC managed to get stuff in. I\nmean it didn't stay this way forever. But those...that first year was pretty horrendous and\nJoe was as frustrated as I was. Fortunately, we became very close friends and we were on\nthe same wave length from beginning to end. We are still good friends, by the way. High\nHolidays, 1945, I must tell you. Had to do something. Not only for soldiers, but for\ndisplaced persons as well. And I decided that they were decided...that they were entitled\nto have a break fast at the end of Yom Kippur which would be traditional. What do you\nneed for a break fast? Herring. You gotta have herring. Without herring you can't do it.\nHow do you get herring? There's no herring in Regensburg. Legal, illegal, no herring. So\nI cabled military to a Chaplain friend in England and said, I need a big barrel of salt\nherring, enough for 2,000 people for break fast. One day in August...late August, 1945,\nbeginning September, I don't remember the dates at this point, I got a phone call. Munich\nairstrip. \"Are you Chaplain Lipman?\" \"At the end of our runway is the biggest God Dam\nbarrel (you'll have to censor that) I have seen and it stinks.\" \"I'll be right down.\"\n(Laughter) I put my trailer on my jeep, and I went to the air strip and we unloaded what\nwas an enormous barrel. You think of a barrel as this big. It was three times that big. Was\nalmost as tall as I. We couldn't lift it. It had to be rolled. And I took it up to Ragensberg,\nand said, \"Now what do I do with it? How do I make this into pickled herring, because it\nwas old salt herring, in brine, untouched. It had its heads. It had had its scales. It had\neverything. Then I got an idea. My commanding officer was a Colonel Koen. We were\nnot friends, I am sorry to say. He should rest in peace. Harold Kone was not very Jewish.\nHe was part of the famous teams of Abrahams in Kone. The 4th Armored Division had\nbeen hell on wheels for the Germans. They had hated the 4th Armored, and they\nparticularly Abrahams and Koen. They thought they were both Jews. Abrahams was the\nlate General Kritein, Abrahams of Viet Nam fame who was then a Colonel, and was\nHarold Koen's commander. He commanded the combat command. Harold...No, he\ncommanded the regiment. Harold had the combat command. Harold Koen taught Kreitein\nAbrahams some Yiddish and to the extent they could on their walky talkies, they talked\nYiddish. And the Germans called them terrible names, these two Jews. But that was as\nJewish as Harold Koen got. He was not interested in me. He was not interested in what I\nwas doing, and so we kept away from each other. I went in to him and I said, \"Harold, I\nneed something, and maybe this will appeal to you. I need some PWs, a bunch of them\nfor a whole day.\" \"What for?\" I said, \"To clean herring.\" And he said, \"What?\" I said,\n\"Yal, I got a barrel of herring here, a big barrel for both our troops and for the Jews in\nRegensburg for Yom Kippur.\" And he said, \"Oh, how beautiful.\" We had a PW cage for\nhigh ranking officers. He gave me 10 Colonels, 10 Nazi Colonels, who arrived in step in\nuniform, and I said to them, \"Gentlemen, I suggest to you that you take off as much of\nyour uniforms as you can because the task you have is not going to be exactly...\" \"We are\nforbidden to do menial labor. We are officers.\" I said, \"I am aware of that, and we will\nkeep the Geneva Convention. We will not smash it. We may bend it a bit before the day\nis over.\" I sat them down on relatively low stools with big buckets in front of them, put\nthe barrel of herring in front of them, and said, \"Gentlemen, you are to cut off the heads.\nYou are scale it. You are to gut it. And then put it into these buckets of water.\" They\nrefused. And I said, \"Here's the written order from Colonel Koen. I am not sure what you\ncan do about it. You are, after all, prisoners of war.\" They sat down and they spent 10\nhours...it was a pretty hot day...cleaning herring. I loved every minute of it. I was a\nsadistic so and so. Koen must have come out 10 times to watch it. He had a marvelous\ntime that day. And then when they went back...uh...the herring having been cleaned, they\ndemanded baths. And the camp commander said, \"But it's not your bath day. You'll get\nyour bath day on your bath day.\" And so these guys walked around reeking of herring for\nI don't know how many days until their bath day came, and I must tell you I had no\ncompassion. I confess that I am not that human, or humane. So we made enormous\nquantities of pickled herring. I found some other things that the commissary or the... our\nsupply group was willing to let me steal and then I got 4,000 donuts from our Red Cross\npeople. Had lots and lots and lots of coffee and all the rest of it. And then I got a break.\nThe 4th Armored Division was a New York Division and organized at Camp Pine. And\nof its 10,000 people when it was full strength, almost 15 hundred were Jews. It had the\nhighest casualty rates in Jews of any unit in the United States Army I suspect because 4th\nArmored had been through very heavy combat. Between Rosh Hashanah and Yom\nKippur, the high point men got their orders to go home. I had over a thousand men at\nRosh Hashanah services. I had 80 at Yom Kippur services. They had left me. (Laughter)\nThey had gone home. I was delighted for them. I was delighted for another reason too. I\nhad that much more food for my DPs. We finished early. I deliberately started services\nearly and finished early, so we could all get into Regensburg. And all these guys that\nwanted to go...some of them drove trucks for me...had this food all loaded and we went\ninto Regensburg and we parked our trucks in front of the Jewish Center where the Jews\nwere dining. And...uh...somebody looked in one of the trucks. They didn't know I was\ncoming. I had not told them we were bringing a meal. And I am not sure they ever\nfinished the meal that day. They unloaded those trucks faster than I have ever seen trucks\nunloaded, and that food disappeared. I stood in there. I had such a wonderful time\nwatching these people break fast as you're supposed to break fast. It was a quite\nmemorable experience. Lots of other adventures in Regensburg.,...uh...including my\nsecond kapo. I came into the center one day, and they were screaming and yelling at this\npoor, bedraggled looking Jew who was a kapo, and I said, \"You are not going to do\nanything in this center.\" And we asked questions. The guy admitted that he had been a\nkapo, so we had no trouble with that. And I said to the Jews, \"Was being a kapo a war\ncrime?\" \"Yes.\" \"What do we do with war criminals? We try them. I am taking this Jew to\nmilitary government, and I am having him arrested as a war criminal and the Allied\nArmies will try this war criminal as we are trying war criminals and you won't touch\nhim.\" And they screamed and they yelled I was a traitor. They were going to kill this guy.\nThe least they could do was get there vengeance, etc., etc., etc. And I said to my assistant,\na wonderful Jew named Si Pova, who lives in Hartford, Connecticut. He's a social\nworker. He raised an orthodox family. He was 19 years old. They called him , Simon, the\nrighteous one. And he was. Si must have worked 20 hours a day, 6 days a week for these\npeople. He was absolutely magnificent. I said to Si, \"Si, you have to do something. Don't\nsay anything. Just go, unhook your carbine out of the rack in the jeep and bring it up\nhere.\" And he did. And I said to the Jews, \"Si, here has a gun. Wouldn't it be terrible if\nhe had to use it. But we want to use it rather than let you kill this Jew.\" And we marched\nthe Jew out and turned him over the military government, and I can't tell you what\nbecame of him. That was my war criminal. It took awhile for the people in Regensburg to\nforgive me. They were very angry, and I understand their anger. But that's what...our\nHasidic style. We changed hats and we danced and we went absolutely bananas and 5\no'clock in the afternoon when I went back to my hotel....I managed to stagger\nin...uh...they had finished yet because they had danced so long. And...uh...I had an\nincident with my anti*Hasidic grandfather as a result of that day. I made a mistake.\nBefore I sobered up, I wrote him a letter, telling him of the wonderful time I had had with\nthose people and that I wanted to see more of them. He wrote me back. We corresponded\nalways in Hebrew. From the time that I was 7 years old, I got only Hebrew letters from\nmy grandfather, who figured I was smart enough to get somebody to translate them for\nme for the parts I couldn't translate myself. And he had beautiful handwriting. So I got\nthis letter by return mail which sort of crinkled the edges of the paper in which he said, \"I\nhave your letter. I want to remind you of something. When you wrote me to Jerusalem\nthat you had decided to become a reform Rabbi I didn't argue with you. I thought about it.\nAfter all, your father was a businessman and an atheist. At least, you weren't going in\neither of those directions. To become a Rabbi, even a reform Rabbi you would have to\nstudy. You would know something, which is more than most Jews did, so remember I\ndidn't fight with you. But, if you become a Hasid, don't come home. And he signed the\nthing. (Laughter) One of my favorite all-time letters from the old man. Okay. We now\nmove into...uh... November. We got theater orders that any Chaplain who could was to\nreport to Paris in time for a theater wide memorial service on November 11, the speaker\nat which would be David Ben-Gurion, and it would be held in the Synagogue in Paris.\nAnd I didn't want to go. Joe and I had a lot of things going, 31 camps and\ncommunities...uh...the package system is working. I'll have to tell you about the mail\nsystem which was also working. I didn't really want to go. And my Senior Chaplain said,\n\"Gene, go.\" I said, \"Why?\" He said, \"You're too tired. You don't look good. Just don't\nlike the way you look.\" And Si Pava said, \"You're pain a neck these days. You're\nirritable. You're terrible. Go to Paris.\" said, '\"Pava, you just want to go to Paris.\" He says,\n\"I want to be at that service. I ought to be there.\" And I said, \"Pava, you've earned the\nright. Let's go.\" So we went. Snowed the whole bloody way across Europe. We had to go\nby jeep. There was no other way to go and...uh...1t was not exactly a happy, happy ride,\nbut we made it. And one of the most frigid experiences of my entire life was that service\nat the Synagogue. Not the atmosphere, but it was cold. There was no heat in this\nsynagogue. We were all sitting there in our gray coats, and Ben Gurion hung a on us. He\nmade a long, long speech. I had been instructed by my Berichah people to see Ruth\nKluger in Paris, at the Haganah office. Haganah had an office in Paris. European\nheadquarters. So I wondered in there, and we were talking, Ruth and I, about what was\ngoing on in Germany and Czechoslovakia and what we needed and how we could do a\nbetter job of moving Jews when her phone rang. And from the conversation at my...at our\nend, it was clear that she was talking to Judge Simon Riskin who had arrived...I don't\nremember how many weeks earlier...as the advisor to General Eisenhower on Jewish\nAffairs, with a rank of Lieutenant General. And they were talking about a deal which Ben\nGuron had made with Eisenhower just before Ben Guron came to Paris for the service.\nThe deal in which teachers would be sent from Palestine to the DP camps to teach\nHebrew, to teach agronomy. All of those teachers would be Haganah people, and the\nArmy would try to turn its back to the maximum possible extent to let them operate.\nEisenhower asked one thing. You will not bribe any American soldier. You will not\ncorrupt my men. I'll help you get around them, but you're not going through them. And\nBen-Gurion thought that made good sense. So they wanted to get going. The Army had\nan airplane ready to go to...uh...what is now Ben Guron airport, then called Luds to pick\nup the first group to bring them. And it suddenly occurred to Judge Riskin that an\nAmerican crew flying into Lud wouldn't know what to do with itself when it got there.\nThat some liaison person was necessary, and Ruth agreed that a liaison person was\nnecessary. And she looked at me and suddenly she said to Judge Riskin, \"I think I have\nthe person sitting right here. Shall I put him on the phone.\" And I introduced myself and\nJudge Riskine said, \"If Ruth thinks you're the person to do this, then it's alright with me.\nCan you be here tomorrow morning?\" I said, \"If I drive all night, I can.\" He said, \"So\ndrive all night.\" Lieutenant Generals are like this, and Simon Riskin is like this too. He's a\nvery blunt...uh...guy who had given up a place on a Federal District bench, a life\nappointment, to take on this temporary thing, to work for Eisenhower and do Jewish\nthings. He was wonderful. So I found Si with no trouble. We had a terrible time finding\nour other driver who was carousing Paris, but we caught up with him and we loaded him\nin the back of the jeep because he couldn't drive and the two of us drove all night. We\nreported to Judge Riskin in Frankfort the next morning. Uh...the morning following that, I\nwas on a B-17, with a crew of five Americans heading for... Uh...Bewildered. Excited. I\nhad my orders from General Walter Bedel Smith, and they were for 7 days. Okay? So I\ngot into Delist. Got to Jerusalem, and discovered nothing was ready. Uh...Our Israel\nfriends will all forgive me, but the Middle East is not exactly the most efficient place in\nthe world to do business. Not then and not now. Uh...I went to meetings and tried to get\nthings going. There was no way to get those people out in 7 days. But I got a lot of\nquestions that had to be answered in Germany. So we flew back to Germany, went into\nconference with the various people at headquarters that were going to deal with this thing\nand...uh...got answers and flew back again. I made two trips in about 2 weeks I guess it\nwas. My second trip was not long before Hanukkah. And...uh...while we were getting my\n14 people organized, a couple of incidents are worth mentioning. First, my 7 day orders,\nthe 7th day was a Shabbat. It was alright with me. I was under military orders and you do\nthings under military orders. But 4 of my 14 teachers so-called were orthodox Jews. They\nrefused to fly on Shabbat. And I said, \"What will give you permission to fly on Shabbat?\"\nAnd they said, \"Written authorization from the Chief Rabbi.\" I said, \"Okay.\" So I called\nthe Chief Rabbi's office and I talked with a gentleman who is now the President of Israel,\nthe Chief Rabbi's son, who was then his secretary. I told him what I wanted and he\nlaughed and he said, \"All of us are gonna have fun with that one.\" And...uh...he invited\nme for Shebot dinner and I didn't accept because I was having Shabbat dinner with the\nmen who was really the political head of the Haganah, the first foreign minister of Israel,\nwho I am delighted to say became Esther's and my very good friend. Uh...We loved him\ndearly. And I remember President Hertzog saying, isn't going to like that. You don't turn\ndown an invitation to the Rabbi's dish.\" And I said, \"One is also not rude. One has to\nhave . And I had accepted another invitation. Now would the Chief Rabbi call Sharet and\ngive him reasons for me not to go to Sharet's for Shabbat dinner?\" He said, \"No, the\nChief Rabbi will not do that.\" I said, \"Fine. You'll give my apologies to the Rabbi. I have\nno choice whatsoever.\" But I went there late Friday afternoon, and the Rabbi's little\nsynagogue and had an interview with him before . His first question to me...he spoke\nHebrew and English and Yiddish with an Irish accent. He had been Chief Rabbi in\nDublin before he went to Palestine. Charming, wonderful little man. His first question to\nme was, \"Is it true that you are Morris Neman's nephew?\" And I said, \"How did you ever\nhear of Morris Neman?\" And he said, \"We know things out here.\" I said, \"Yes. I am his\nnephew.\" And he said, \"You can't be all bad, even if you're a reform Rabbi.\" I said,\n\"Thank you for nothing.\" (Laughter) He gave me the piece of paper authorizing these\nguys to go on the grounds it was . Human life was involved, and they had to fly out on\nShabbat or not fly out. I would have to go without because I wasn't going to get court\nmartialed for this bunch or anybody else. So we left on Shabbat. Chief Rabbi was\nwonderful. I was carrying with me not only 14 somewhat scared Jews, but the most\npeculiar package I have ever carried in my life. I had been called and asked to come and\nsee aman named Caplan, who was the treasurer of the Jewish Agency, First Minister of\nFinance, with the Government of Israel in 1948. I walked into his office. This was before\nmy meeting with the Chief Rabbi. And he said, \"Are you really Morris Neman's\nnephew?\" I said, \"Yes,\" and he offered me condolences because as it happens Morris had\ndied in September of 45. One of the first things I did in Jerusalem was go to the walls and\nsay kottish for him. He was a great Zionist in Pittsburgh. A magnificent, magnificent\nman. My favorite uncle. So he said, \"Okay, then I'll trust you.\" He said, \"I want you to do\nsomething for me. I want you to take a package to Paris. I said, \"But I am not going to\nParis.\" He said, \"If you take this package you are.\" I said, \"What will be in the package?\"\nAnd he said, \"A quarter of a million dollars.\" I said, \"That's too big a package.\" (laughter)\nfor my purposes. He says, \"No, it will fit in your shaving kit.\" I said, \"How?\" He said,\n\"Because it's going to be in gold sovereigns. It's the budget for the Paris office for the\nnext period of time.\" And I said, \"Alright. So I'll get court martialed. What can I do?\"\nAnd he took me through a door and through another door into a room that consisted of\nshelves, each one of which was marked with a country. All currency. This was the Jewish\nAgency's private treasury of foreign currency. I don't know how much money was there.\nNo idea. All I know is that he was correct. I got a quarter of million dollars in gold\nsovereigns into my docket. Then I wondered, \"How'll I pull this off? I am going to have\nto trust one of my pilots. And I got hold of the Major and I said to him, \"Look. I am\ngoing to do something very dangerous. I am going to tell you something you don't want\nto know and I don't want to tell you, but I need you. I need you in two ways. I need you\nto protect me. I am going to be walking around for the rest of the time we are Palestine\nwith my dock kit in my hands, and I don't anybody to ask why. And I don't want anybody\nto take it because it is money in it. A lot of money.\" \"Okay, Chappy. It's alright with me.\"\nI said, \"Second of all, you are to arrange an emergency that makes us land in Paris for 1\nhour.\" \"That's not as easy,\" he said. I said, \"You'll do it though.\" I let them know\napproximately when we would be coming in, and we were met at the airport by a man\nwho became one of my most beloved friends, Efriam Decal who is second in command\nof the was the boss and Decal was his second. Decal has written extensively about the\nBerichah and about all sorts of things. He...uh...has died. His wife is still living I am glad\nto say. I just handed him this, and he, in effect, said thank you. (Laughter) That was our\nfirst meeting. We became friends later. And we flew back to Germany. And we got away\nwith it, which was alright. We had something else on board, about which I was very\nsentimental and still am. I was invited to a meeting of the Vodlume, which is the National\nassembly of the Ishuf, headed by...uh...Ben , who became the second President of Israel.\nAnd I met all the people who are legendary. You name them and they were all sitting\nthere, and I was introduced to all of them. And Ben said, \"I need a favor.\" \"What.\" The\nschool children of Israel had been making Hanukiyot for the children of the DP camps in\nGermany. We have 36,000 of them. And we have candles. We don't know how to get\nthem to Germany. Nobody ever thought of that. I understand, he said, that you are flying\nin a bomber. I said, \"Yes, and my bomber has bomb bays, and I think it would be very\nnice if we filled the bomb bays of a B-17 with Hanukiyot and candles.\" And we did. And\nI sent a military TWX to Si Pava to alert everybody he could alert to come to the airport\nat Piece boden and pick up their Hanukiyot and they did. All 36,000 of them got\ndistributed in about 24 hours to Jews all over Germany, all over the American zone of\nGermany. And...uh...that was some Hanukkah. By the way, I don't have one of them. We\ndistributed them all. (Laughing) I never got one. I would give much to have one of those\nHanukiyot but I don't have one, and I guess that's proper and just that I should not have. I\nnever went back to Regensburg to work. I spent the next period of time until April 46\nrunning around, doing I don't know what, but there were emergencies constantly. The\nAmerican headquarters in Frankfort would call...the G.5 sections civil affairs, or\nHiam...then called Hans Hoffman, later became Hiam Hoffman, later became , one of the\nfine people of Israel, and I had to do things. So I was on detached service at Frankfort\nHeadquarters for some months, but that had to end. You just can't keep doing that. So the\ntheater Chaplain, a man named Hunan, Catholic, Truman's Chaplain, he called himself,\nfrom the first World War, called me in and said, \"You gotta stop this monkeying around.\nThis isn't why you're in the Army. I am sending you to Berlin. That should be far enough\naway from all those displaced persons.\" And I said, \"Yes, Sir.\" Excited, because the Jews\nfrom Poland and Russia had just started to come in and we were routing them all through\nBerlin. We had one of the Haganah people stationed in Berlin, and that's where the action\nwas going to be. Break my heart. Send me to Berlin. Twenty four hours later, he called\nme in and he said, \"You're not going to Berlin. I just found out the stuff that's going on\nthere. You're going to Augsburg to the Ist Division.\" \"Yes, Sir.\" \"And,\" he said, \"when\nyou get there, find Chaplain Freedman, whom I assigned there, but who is now going to\nBerlin in your place.\" And I went to Augsburg and found Herb Freedman, whom I had\nnever met before. A young, first lieutenant, fresh into the Army, who was angry at me\nbecause Augsburg is near Munich, and in Munich is where the action was because he\nwanted to do Haganah work. He was busting to do this stuff. And I explained to him that\nBerlin was better and he should be made on me. (laughter) And he went to Berlin. Of\ncourse, Herb Freedman's career since then has been legendary. He and Phil Burstein did\nthings that people really shouldn't have been able to do. And...uh...1t was superb. I was\ndelighted to be in Augsburg. But my time was running out, because Hoffman was\nnegotiating with the Army to make me into a civilian because it was clear during this\nperiod from December when these 14 arrived that this , this Jewish agency for Palestine\ngroup, as it was called,...uh... was going to have constant dealings with the Army. And\nsome American had to be there to see to it that nothing got fouled up. And they decided I\nshould be that person, and I was not unwilling. My condition was that my wife and child\nbe allowed to come to Germany with me. I had two reasons for that. First of all, I been\naway 18 months and that's a lot longer than 2 years...those 2 years that I thought wouldn't\nbe so long, and second of all, I felt that Esther had to experience this or we weren't going\nto have much of a life because I was no longer the person who had gone overseas. An\nawtul lot had happened. Deeply, deeply transforming stuff. And they agreed. Somebody\nfouled up, and in April 1946, just before Passover...uh...I got orders to go home to be\ndemobilized and I asked Heim about it and he sort of shrugged and we talked to Ruth\nKluger in Paris who was theoretically making these arrangements and she sort of\nshrugged. So I came home. And I became a civilian. Uh...There was an Haganah office in\nNew York. It had been organized for a very simple purpose. Money. They had to buy\nships. Ships are expensive. The only place they really could buy ships was the United\nStates because they wanted larger ships. Ships for 2 or 3 hundred people were not going\nto be able to do this thing anymore. They needed big ships. So they were going to buy\nthem in the United States, and they sent 4 Palestinians over, led by who later became , the\nfirst chief of staff of the Israel army, later the President of the in Haifa. A marvelous,\nmarvelous man. When I got to New York, I went into the office, naturally, and asked me\nif I would go to work for them. As long as I had to be in the United States for a little\nwhile making speeches for the Haganah. So from the end of April 1946 until February\n1947, I was on the staff of the Haganah in the United States making speeches. Esther and\nI lived in New York. First in a hotel, but then we couldn't stand it. And Michael was\ngetting sick in this hotel. The food just wasn't for a 2 year old. And...uh...so we found an\napartment on Staten Island, and we lived over there. It was not a good time. I was away\nmore than I was there....uh... making the same speech over and over and over again to\nsecret meetings of Jews to get money. Was not my style, but it was what had to be done.\nThere was some compensation. There was a rainy night. I don't remember what month\nwhen I was allowed to go to Baltimore. And down on the docks was a ship, then called\nthe SS Warfield. The Warfield being the same person as the Duchess of Windsor because\nher daddy was the President of the steamboat company that ran steamboats up around the\nChesapeake Bay. This was a Chesapeake Bay steamer. Decrepit, messed up which the\nHaganah had bought, and we were sending off to Europe to transport Jews. We estimated\nthat maybe 25,000 Jews uncomfortable could get on it. When it sailed in June of 47 to\nPalestine from France as the exodus 1947, it had 52 hundred people on board, and we'll\npick that up later because I have more to do with the exodus. That night in Baltimore we\ncommissioned the exodus in a non-existent Jewish navy. Gave it flag, and all the rest of\nthe . A word ought to be said about Americans for Haganah. It was an astonishing\norganization. It's head was a multi-millionaire oil man named Rudolph Sonaborn, whose\nlast claim to fame was that he married Dorothy Shift, the publisher of the New York Post\nthen. But he gave at least half his time to Americans for Haganah. We met every Tuesday\nfor lunch in a hotel in New York, and...uh... books have been written about this operation,\nwhich was clandestine. The bank account was the bank account of the Palestine pavilion\nof the New York Worlds Fair. There had been a New York World's Fair in\n1930...what...8, 9, something like that, and they never closed the bank account of the...of\nthe Jewish pavilion or the Palestine Pavilion it was called. And that money was funneled\nthrough the Palestine Pavilion bank account, and we never got caught. Later, there was\ntrouble with armed shipments to the Haganah, but that was much later, after the\nFoundation was dated as a matter of fact. This group that met on Tuesdays was a\nremarkable bunch, and the fact that we raised several million dollars for the purchase of\nships is amazing because we were a small group and you couldn't talk about it. You\ncouldn't do the usual kinds of fund raising hoopla. We met in people's rumpus rooms,\nthey were called in those days. They are called family rooms today, I think.\nAnd...uh...everybody had to know everybody, and they couldn't talk about it, and they\nhad to get lots of money. It was a wild operation. I did not enjoy it. One of my tasks, for\nexample, was to go once a week for lunch to the 21 Club in New York because one of the\nKrinlers was interested in us, and he introduced me to all these degenerate people. He\nused to hang out at the 21 Club and I'd get money from them. Uh...Some of the ladies\nwere very frank about where they money came from and how it came. And I had a\nconscious problem about this, but it didn't last because buying the ships was more\nimportant than my Jewish conscious. But it was a tough time for my family and me. We\nwere relieved when finally, finally, finally the paperwork was done, and we could get\nback to Europe, we thought. I flew to Paris and went in back in to Germany immediately.\nGot us a house in Heidelberg, and then went to Paris to pick Esy up when she and\nMichael arrived. They got stuck in Paris for 4 week because the paperwork wasn't in\norder. She lived in a very fancy hotel in Paris for 4 weeks, and then we moved into\nHeidelberg and the next phase of this operation begins. bP HP",
        "Q: The tape 1s...",
        "A: Good place to break.",
        "Q: Yes. It's a good place to break.",
        "Q: Tell me about Manford.",
        "A: Uh...We went out to dinner at one day last week, and he was alert and he was alive and\nhe was fine.",
        "Q: Okay. We may begin. We're back on tape. Uh... Let us go back to Germany for a minute.\nUh...There were two people you wanted to tell us more about.",
        "A: One day in early Fall (clearing throat) 1945 I walked into our building in Regensburg and\nI went upstairs and I heard very loud sounds, kids stomping and shouting, and so I went\nto see what it was. There about 20 teenagers with this short, very short, heavy set, young,\nyoung man leading them in a dance...in a song. Uh. was the theme and stuff and he had\nthose kids going absolutely mad. And I watched this guy and said to myself, \"He's a\nleader. That man is a leader.\" So I met him. His name was Leon Retter from , a genius\nwho had been sent by the Russians to the language school in Moscow when he was 16.\nHe spoke then and still speaks somewhere between 10 and 15 languages quite fluently.\nHe was a captain in the Red Army during the war, and at the end of the war decided that\nhe wanted to get out. This was what he wanted that he wanted to live in Palestine. So he\nran away, and came into American zone in Germany. Landed in Regensburg. some\nmonths later his girlfriend joined him and they married. They are still married and they\nlived in Munich for reasons which will become clear. Uh...We had organized not only the\ncentral committee, but regional committees. More people involved the better. He became\na member of our regional committee, and then I...uh...let Klausner know, as a matter of\nfact, that I thought this guy was...uh...good material and Klausner met him, moved him\ndown to Munich and Irea which is the name he took instead of Leon,...uh...for reasons\nthat have to do with language. Leon means lion and Irea means lion. Their translation.\nAnd Redder became just because he wanted it to. He...uh...became the foreign secretary\nof the displaced persons. It was he who dealt with the big people who came in. It was he\nwho went to Frankfort headquarters to, as he said, make demands on behalf...on behalf of\nthe Jewish displaced persons. Tough minded,...uh...brilliant orator who in the spring of\n1946 was sent to the United States for his first UJA missions. And he has done UJA off\nand on ever since until his retirement about 2 years ago. He's 68 now. He...uh.. should\nhave become a major political figure, but...uh...Mr. Ben-Gurion was rather capricious\nabout his boys, as he called them, and when there was a revolt against Ben-Gurion within\nthe Labor Party, in the 50's, Irea joined the revolt. And the old man punished him and\nthen made him do projects for him afterwards. Irea decided that the way to get along in\nIsrael was to be independent, and so he become Israel's first management consultant on\nhuman relations. As new immigrant groups came in, there were all kinds of tensions and\nproblems and he would work with those. He's a remarkable fellows, still one of my very\nclosest friends. He had the right kind of hutspah in huge amounts. Uh...It was fun to\nwatch him telling General Clay what General Clay had to do. (Laughter) It was really\ngreat. He's also...was great with the Jews. I went with him one night to one of the DP\ncamps where we had just gotten a telephone call that there was a riot going on. The\nG...the American Army did some not very bright things. As we became friendly with the\nGermans, which we did by 1946, 47...Secretary Burns had led the way on that...they\nbegan to put German police in Jewish DP camps, and the Jews didn't like it much. And\nwe had that kind of situation, and the Jews went berserk. So Irea and I went. He got up on\nthe back of the truck and he hushed those Jews, and then he spoke to them with his kind\nof beery voice, and they went back to their room...home to behave themselves. I have\nnever seen one person stop a riot before, but he did. He had that kind of power.\nExtremely, extremely charismatic, powerful guy, who became my brother. And...uh...has\nremained very much a brother. (Sigh) I am trying to think of.... Well, we had a Congress\nof Displaced Persons...uh...1n the first year, and unquestionably, the most influential\nindividual there, besides Klausner, was Nesher. Okay, that's Nesher. That's who he is.\nThat's who he was. Uh...He went to Palestine in time for the War of Independence cause\nhe insisted on doing so. He and Lilly took a bunch of kids on a legal trip because there\nwere some... And both of them went into the Army, and I tease them to this day about the\nfact that she outranked him. He was a sergeant and she was a lieutenant. Lilly, his wife, is\none of the experts on Soviet Jewry. She was taking Jews out of the Soviet Union when\nnobody was taking Jews out of the Soviet Union. And...uh...still there was a great deal\nabout Soviet Jewry. Okay, so much for Nesher Klausner. When I saw Klausner at the\nChaplains\u2019 meeting, first time I had seen him since Dachau, and we made all the plans\nand started the package system. Uh...It was clear that any Chaplain who wanted to do the\njob right should do so in consultation with Abe. The leaders of the DPs were his. He was\nthe President. The processes of the central committee he was in the middle of. He tried\nnot to deal with the U.S. Army because he was absent without leave. He spent total of 8\nmonths absent without leave. He had no assignment. He didn't get paid. He also did not\ndo anything for the Army. He was unconnected to the American Army. He met every\nonce in awhile with some general, but he was unconnected with the American Army and\nnobody realized it. Uh...I knew it, but what the heck? It wasn't my business. One day I\nhad to go to 3rd Army Headquarters in . That was the day I saw all of General Patton's\ncars and jeeps and his private...uh...fleet. I went up to the Chaplain's office to get\nwhatever I went to get. I don't remember what. And I heard a voice call, \"Chaplain.\" So\neverybody in the room turned around because there must have been 15 chaplains in the\nroom, and this guy from inside the private office was pointing his finger at me. And I\nsaid, \"Yes, Sir.\" And I went in. A bird Colonel...uh...O'Reilley, he's Senior Chaplain of\nthe 3rd Army, regular Army Catholic, and he said, \"What's your name, Chaplain?\" I told\nhim my name. And he said, \"Tell me Lipman, do you happen to know a Chaplain named\nKlausner?\" I thought, \"Oh, boy!\" I said, \"Which one, Sir?\" And he crossed himself and\nsaid, \"Holy Mary, Mother of God. Don't tell me there are two of them.\" And I said, \"Yes,\nSir. There's Chaplain Berkland Klausner. There's Chaplain Abraham Klausner.\" What I\nknew that he didn't know was that Berk Klausner was in England, but that didn't matter. I\nwas telling the truth. He said, \"You know, I have been hearing rumors about a Chaplain\nKlausner in my area, but I don't get monthly reports from him. Do you ever see him.\"\nAnd I said, \"I suppose I could find him if I tried hard.\" He said, \"Would you do me a\nfavor?\" \"Of course, Sir.\" \"Would you please tell him that I am looking for him because I\nmust have his monthly reports?\" I said, \"I will certainly tell him.\" Next day, I had lunch\nwith Abe in Munich and I said to him, \"Here's your message from Chaplain O'Reilly.\"\nAnd he listened, and he said, \"Okay, message has been received.\" I said, \"No. Let's do it.\nLet's regularize you. It will be good for you, and it would enhance your status. It wouldn't\ndestroy your status with the Army.\" We sat down in his house on with the help of the\nJDC women sitting at the typewriters and we wrote 8 monthly reports. (Laughter)\nNumbers, statistics, services conducted, counseling sessions held, the works! And he\nsigned them, and we sent them in through channels with no note of any kind. We\narranged for one of the officers to see that they got into the mail system and they landed\nin the Chaplain's office. Next thing Abe heard was he got orders brought to him by a\nfinance officer who was bringing him 8 months pay. He hadn't been paid for 8 months.\nHe got this stack of occupation currency, and the finance officer said, \"While I was\ncoming here, the Adjutant General asked if I would bring you these. They are orders.\"\nAnd Abe looked and in the orders he was assigned to a hospital in Munich. And that's\nwhere he remained. He just kept right on going. Never moved into the hospital. Reported\nto the hospital. Spoke to the hospital Chaplain and said, \"If you have any Jews problems,\ncall me.\" (Laughter) And disappeared and never heard from again. That's how he\noperated. Abe opened DP camps. He started two hospitals. When they emptied out\nDachau, he took care of those people. There was a famous transport of twelve hundred\nHungarians who were supposed to go back to Hungary. The U.S. Army had a policy. It\nhad two parts. First, one was everybody goes home. No matter what. It's our job to\nrepatriate. It isn't our job to move people around and second of all, there are no Jews.\nThey are Poles. They are Hungarians. They are Rumanians. They are Germans. They are\nAustrians. There aren't any Jews. And at first, there were mixed DP camps. And the\nArmy couldn't understand why there were riots every night. People getting hurt every\nnight. Some of us wrote letters through channels to the Commanding General, a fellow\nnamed Eisenhower, saying, \"Can't do this. The Jews are in unique position, and you\nreally must somehow, Sir, ... uh...organize special camps for them.\" It wasn't until July\nthat orders came out (a) declaring Jews a nationality and (b) permitting separate facilities.\nSo we started...we... UNRRA blew it. They started Jewish DP camps. UNRRA was\nunable to do so. Well, Abe did it. He had this crazy capacity to do all sorts of things with\nvery few resources. Another funny story that happened to Abe, but it's not about him.\nObviously, the Jews wanted to leave. One day, he was in his office, still at the Dorchus\nMuseum, before he moved into... There was a knock on the door, and this little Jew came\nbursting in and, \"Herr Chaplain. Herr Chaplain.\" \"Yes.\" This was...conversation was\ncarried on in Yiddish although an instantaneous translation. Uh...\"I have a visa.\"\n\"Wonderful,\" said Abe. And they danced together and they pranced together, \"You have\na visa. Where are you going?\" \"Costa Rica.\" \"Marvelous, it's a beautiful country,\" and\nthey kibitzed around for a good...and the guy was about to leave and he turned to Abe and\nsaid, \"Herr Chaplain, May I ask a question?\" \"Of course.\" \"Where's Costa Rica?\" He had\nno idea what part of the world Costa Rica was in, and I suspect he didn't go there either.\nHe may have started for there, but he didn't land there. What else should I tell you about\nKlausner? Uh...The Army arranged for him to come home in 1946 too. He will give you\nall kinds of stories about how...how and why it happened, but it happened. As soon as he\ngot to the United States, he began to maneuver to get back because that's all he wanted to\ndo. He was a bachelor, and this was his life. And General Hilldring was Assistant\nSecretary of State for International Affairs. Good guy! And Abe went to him, and\nHilldring arranged for him to go back to Germany and he did go back. Did some\ninteresting things that had to do with the exodus people as a matter of fact and when I get\nto exodus we'll talk about that. And then, eventually, I came home and...uh...took up a\nRabbinical career. He's been in Yonkers, New York, for many, many years. He's just\nretiring.",
        "Q: Okay. We'll pick up with him later. Before we leave Regensburg, was it in Regensburg\nthat you had occasion to call upon a Nazi doctor.",
        "A: No. It was not in Regensburg, and it was later.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: It's from Heidelberg to another town.",
        "Q: Then let's pick up as it were chronologically again. We jump back. You have been\ncivilianized and returned to Heidelberg.",
        "A: Went to Heidelburg to live. And I did (sigh) three jobs. I was responsible for all routine\nliaison with the American Army. there was a Brigadier General in Frankfort\nHeadquarters, a good man, solid man, with whom I had the right to talk anytime I wanted\nto, or he would call me whenever he had something, and we talked a great deal. Second,\nany publicity or public relations that had to do with the underground, I was responsible\nfor and...uh...I'll come back to that in a minute. My third one was to lead transports with a\nguy who was then called Wolf, whose name was not and is not Wolf. Uh...His name is\nEfrian Franke. Uh...He lives in . He's an attorney, Israel's most distinguished restitution\nattorney. Married to a woman named Hanna, who was one of the members of this group\nin Germany, and they have an infinite number of grandchildren by now. It was the second\nmarriage for both of them. So, Efrian who was never called Efrian and I did transports\ntogether, as the leaders of them. I was called to Paris one day because a major American\nnewspaper person wanted an interview with the famous Colonel Wolf, and I arranged it.\nEfrian was in Paris, and we made this interview by agreeing to meet at a certain place.\nWe met at that place, got into a cab and went to another place. Got into a cab, and went to\na third place. I guess it was about the 4th place where Efrian finally walked in, and the\nreporter joined us. Because everybody assumed all the time that the British were looking\nfor us. That was one of my P.R. jobs. The most important P.R. job I guess I ever did had\nto do with the late M . We had a contact in the United States where reporters were\nconcerned. Let me tell you about one of the incidents and then I will come to . Uh...The\ndoor bell rang one day in Heidelberg, and a young, fresh faced guy said, \"My name is\nDick Dudman, and I want a story about the Haganah.\" And I said, \"Never heard of it,\"\nand I closed the door. And I sent a wire to the late I.F. Stone in New York. Isy Stone was\nour New York contact. He was working for P.M. newspaper then, and nobody could get\ninto Haganah for a story unless Stone sent him. And I in this cable said, \"What's this\nDudman guy? Do I let him in or not? He claims to be from the Denver Post.\" And I got a\nwire back saying, \"Yal, He's okay.\" So I managed to get word...uh...I don't remember\nhow I did it or whether Isy did it, but Dudman came to my door again. And we made him\ninto a displaced person. Gave him everything he needed to be a displaced person, and\nsent him on one of the trips. And he wrote a memorable series of articles for the Denver\nPost on being a displaced person, and what it was like to go on one of these illegal\ntrips...uh...for which he got a name and fellowship by the way. Later, we became friends\nagain here in Washington, because he was the head of the Washington Bureau, the St.\nLouis Post Dispatch, and...uh...now lives in Ellsworth, Maine. He and his wife decided\nthat it was a small town for them. They bought a radio station in Ellsworth. Dick also\nbecame famous because...uh...rcemember when we were not in Cambodia, he was\ncaptured...uh...with the American troops in Cambodia...with his press credentials, and he\nwas missing for several weeks and we all went out of our minds till he came back quite\nunharmed. Remarkable reporter, and those stories I think...uh...were very exciting and\nvery important in having Americans understand what this crazy underground was all\nabout. But...uh...I guess the longest lasting piece of P.R. has to do with a movie, which\nwas made by Myrlon in..starring his wife,, who is now his widow. She was a writer.\nUh...He came with full credentials, of course, and moved into our house 1n Heidelberg.\nHe was going to make a movie of one of our transports because the story of this movie\nwas this displaced person and how this displaced person got to Palestine. And obviously\nthis displaced person had to be out of Germany. And we decided to use one of our regular\ntransports. So one night, we applied all transports out of our part of German...the ones I\nwas responsible for left on Saturday night. Why, I hear you ask, Saturday night? Because\nas few American troops as possible were on duty Saturday night. Saturday night is\ngetting drunk night or having a beer night or reading a good book night, but you're not on\nduty Saturday night if you can avoid it, so it was easiest to get through the border on\nSaturday nights. We always had some kind of papers. We never tried just to sneak\nthrough a border. That was too risky. Uh... There were times when for small groups we\nwould go through borders, but we had a list of the constabulary units and their schedules,\nwhere they would be when General Mickelson always saw that we had those. That was\nthe guy at Frankfort Headquarters who was my contact, a Brigadier named Abraham\nMickelson. And he provided those. Uh...But the big transports, we had to go through\nroads and border points because we were in 6 by 6 trucks, and some German trucks,\nthough we never used wood burning ones. We bought trucks. We bought gasoline. If did\nnot have Army supplies unless we could steal them, and you couldn't steal large\nquantities of gasoline. That's hard to do. But by this time we had a budget and we were\ngetting money from the United States. This was a transport of about twelve hundred\npeople, leaving Saturday night from the town of Noowhom. We owned a barracks in\nNoowhom. We bought it. It was ours. And we could use it to get people ready to go. And\nwe would appear there on either Friday or sometime early Saturday, and the people\nwould arrive. How they were selected and how they got there is a story unto itself, but\nthat's what we eventually had 130 Palestinians doing out around the countryside. They\nhad political problems; they had age problems; they had all kinds of problems in making\nup these transports. How did we know how many to send? Uh...Let me ask myself the\nquestion when I finish the Myrlon Lynn story because it's a separate story which has its\nown kind of interest. We got instructions on my telephone. Saturday night we would have\nour people all ready. This was a well organized thing. We knew who was going to be in\nwhich trucks. If they were pregnant women, they were in the same truck, and there was a\nnurse with them. Sometimes the nurse was a woman named Esther Lipman, who was not\na nurse. But she was pregnant at the time, so she knew all about it. (Laughing) We were\ngoing to have our second child, so Esther a few pieces of equipment and she went on\nsome of these transports as transport nurse. We never delivered a baby on one of these\ntransports, I'm glad to say. It's just as well. The tough part of the trip was the night part\ninto the Black Forest. And so we left. Every 2 hours we would stop for relief. We left at\nmidnight so that we had two or three 2-hour periods before dawn. At dawn or shortly\nthereafter, we would arrive at what was known as the picnic area. We had been looking\nfor this for weeks, and when we found it, it was as though we had found Heaven. There\nwas a place in the middle of the Black Forest where a small road went off to the right.\nAnd they went about a half a mile and then there was a circle, at the end of which there\nwas a wine house. End of road. That's perfect. No traffic. On the side of the road was a\nlittle cabin. And there we got one of the great breaks of the entire era. When a DP named\nGittshuck, who worked for us, and I were looking for this place...and...for a place, and we\ncame to this, we decided we better check out that cabin. We knocked on the cabin door,\nand a lady answered wearing Bavarian costumes as everybody in the Black Forest did.\nThey wore old fashioned Bavarian costumes. And we talked to her and asked her if she\nwould have any objections if every once in awhile, every week, 10 days, some people\nwould come and rest on the side of the hill and use the stream at the bottom of the hill\njust to wash. And she said, \"I have no objection, but who are they?\" And I said, \"They're\nconcentration camp survivors who are going to their new homes, and we are moving\nthem.\" And she said, \"Oh, can I help?\" And I said, \"If you want to feed them, 1t would be\na great help. We often have children. It would be marvelous if we could leave cereal with\nyou and we could have hot gruel for these kids when they get here and hot tea for the\nadults. That would be absolutely marvelous.\" Nothing to that. Asked some more\nquestions, as I was interested. This woman was a Jew, who had married when she was at\nthe University a non*Jewish German. When the Nazi...when the war started, he was\npulled into the Army. She decided and he decided and his father decided that she should\nhide out in this cabin with the father because he lived there in the middle of the woods.\nHow many people would come into the Black Forest looking for somebody? Uh...She\nwas announced as his daughter-in-law, and her husband was off in the Army being a\nhero. Her husband was killed on the eastern front, so she stayed. Took care of the old\nman. She took care of the old man till he died about 1946, and because some of the\nneighbors knew that she was Jewish and nobody had turned her in, she decided to live out\nher life there. She had a job. She worked. She had her husband's pension from the Army,\nwhatever it was, and she was living there. So then we were able to tell her that these were\nJews. And this became our picnic area. Every transport going to Milhouse in France...uh\n...went through there, and this woman loved it. She was magnificent. I remember her with\ngreat affection. Any how, after resting at the picnic ground and having a meal, we got\nback into the trucks and headed for a place called Pompdecess, where the only bridge\nacross the Rhine was. It was a military bridge. And...uh..we got to Pompdecess, and we\nhad to be there at 4 o'clock. Not 5, not 3 because the French officer whom we owned, the\n, Immigration officer, was sure to be on duty then. Any day but Sunday. And he would\ntake our papers and pass them right through. So we got through the Duon easily. And\nthen from there to Milhouse in France was nothing to it, and there there was a big railroad\nyard and the French Haganah picked up the people at Mulhous and took them by train to\nsomewhere in the Marseilles area depending on where the ship was going to be sit, Port\nBoog or Marseilles itself, whatever. This particular transport had Tereska on board as a\nDP. She had DP papers. She had DP clothing. She was a DP. In front of this particular\ntransport just before my car was the camera car with Myra. And we had a terrible time\nwith Myer. It wasn't his fault. He had to make noise. He had to call something out to the\ncamera crew. You can't do it. He had to call this... There's simply no way to do it. You're\ngoing to shut up or you ain't going. You see you had to go through the American zone of\noccupation to the French zone of occupation. Pompdecess was in the French zone. The\nFrench zone was a small zone in the southwestern Germany. The French insisted on\nhaving a zone. It was a four-power power thing after all. So going from the American\nzone to the French zone was the dangerous one. And having the camera crew along was\ngreat, because we say the United Nations wanted to have records of all these transports of\nsurvivors as they go to their new homes and...uh..we have a crew with us, and want to\ntake your picture at the border as you do your duty, and we got through very fast. Uh...It\nwas very difficult for Myer. I am sure he suffered a lot. It's got the illegals. It is still\navailable in 16 millimeter. It still gets rented I understand by school groups and others\nwho want to see it. One minor tragedy in it which we laugh about in our family, but it\nisn't totally funny. Esther was along on that transport as transport nurse. The only time\nthat I appear in the film was at Pompdecess where I am standing with the Duan going\nover the papers and getting people ready to go through. And Esther was filmed there too.\nThere were other pictures of me in the...in my car and so forth. We had a car with a\nmoveable roof so that we could stand on the seat and watch what was going on.\nDangerous, but...uh...very effective because we had to see what was going on. We didn't\nwant to lose any trucks. They had to stay in line. Uh...We had to go through one or two\ntowns, went through Fribrook for example and in the streets of Fribrook, we did not want\nto lose trucks. But the only one that got printed and is in the film is me at the...there's\nnothing of Esy. All the shots of Esther got cut in the editing, and she never stopped\nteasing Myer about it. And whenever we met, he would come up and want to hug her\nhello and she would say, \"You don't want to hug me. You wouldn't even put me in your\nmovie.\" (Laughter) So...uh...that's our...Myer saga of The Illegal. Incidentally,\nthey...uh...filmed the...the boat. That part of the trip being caught by the British, going to\nCyprus. They got a complete record on the illegal. I forget how much of it is in the film.\nBut that was part of the P.R. job as well as taking transports. Uh...With one exception we\nhad no difficulty, with the transports to France. Uh...One night they got nasty at the\nborder and kept us there 5 hours, and it was only when we finally, finally found Paul\nEdwards... It being a Saturday night, he wasn't at home either. When he finally got\nhome...uh...just before dawn, that he was able to say to these guys, \"Are their papers in\norder? Is my signature on them? What do you want? Get them out of there? You've had\nthose peoples in there a long time. They're tired. They have to get where they're going.\"\nSo the soldiers backed down. And...uh..that had been the result of a tip from a CID\nCriminal Investigation Division of the Army, I am sorry to say, a young man I knew. The\nson of somebody I had grown up with in Pittsburgh who was stuck on his duty and he got\na...in his investigations or whatever, he heard that a bunch of Jews were going out on\nSaturday night and he notified the border station. But it happened. Not everybody\nwas...uh...all for what we were doing. There were people aside from the British who\ndidn't think we were...uh...behaving properly. Okay, that's transports. Oh, no, there's one\nmore thing about it that I must mention. How did we get the quotas and the number of\npeople who were going to take a transport? I had a telephone. Because I was a Lieutenant\nColonel, I had a telephone that could call outside the country. Whenever we were\nscheduled for a transport, at precisely 7 o'clock in the evening, my phone would ring. It\nwould be a female voice talking English with a heavy French accent who never identified\nherself and who gave me a list of agricultural implements and tools and God knows what\nall, that I was to copy down with numbers. And the code Hiamhead I didn't know what it\nsaid. I immediately called Munich and transmitted it to Munich, and that's how we knew\nabout our transports. Some years later, 48 or 9, I don't remember, I was asked by the UJA\nto go to the opening of the campaign in Nashville, Tennessee, at a posh country club and\nI went. Sitting next to me at dinner was a woman named Paulette Oppert O P PERT, a\nFrench Jew, whose husband had been killed in the resistance who had herself been in the\nresistance and who after the war worked for the French Haganah and for people in Paris.\nShe later married an American businessman named Fink, and lived in Minneapolis for\nmany, many years. I saw her once in awhile. I listened, and I said to her, \"Paulette. I\nknow your voice.\" And she said, \"I have been sitting here going crazy cause I know your\nvoice.\" It was she. She had been calling from Paris all those months, giving me all those\ninstructions out of order which she understood, not a word of which I understood, that\nmade it possible for the transports to go. We felt like blood brother and sister. Okay,\nthat's the...uh...that's the transport business. What's next?",
        "Q: Okay. Alright. Uh...How did you start preparing for the Exodus?",
        "A: Well, first of all we got a call from Paulette, telling us that we had to 52 hundred people\nin Marseilles on a certain date. The largest transport that had ever been contemplated.\nAnd the people in the camps did their job. And it was decided that two of the transports\nwould go by train, by way of Strasbourg, and three of them would go by truck and they\nwould be back to back and then we would go down, turn around and come back, load up,\nand do this three times. Two of them being Saturday nights, and one of them being mid-\nweek which we had never done before. But what're we going to do. Because we had to\nget these people on board. The British were watching this ship in sit where it was, and\nthey didn't have a heck of a lot of time, so we rushed it. All of these people had to get\nnew identities because we using a series of French transit visas that the Minister of the\nInterior people had kindly prepared for us, but they were...we would call in blank. They\nweren't really blank at all. They had names on them. They just weren't names of any\nliving people, and they all had ages and they all had birth places. So we prepared in\nadvance DP cards. Uh...All DPs had identity cards issued by UNRRA with military\nauthorization and we had tens of thousands of them that we had printed and...uh...we\nissued new ones to all of these people with the proper stamps on them and then we\nhanded them out at Nooam in the barracks 1n the stables there, and told them, \"You got a\nnew name. You got to know how old you are. You got to know where you were born. It\nhas nothing to do with you. It has to do with whatever that name is on that piece of\npiece.\" So they all had to learn them. And some of the old people had difficulties with\nthis. Kids had no trouble at all. There was one cute little kid with obviously orthodox\norigins was standing there holding these things and chuckling back and forth as he\nmemorized his name and his birthplace and his birth date. It was nice. And then we took\nthem. Normally, when we got Milhouse there was a little hotel there. A wonderful lady\nowned it who fed us a hot meal. This is the staff who had gone on the trip. The people\nwere on the train bound for Marseilles already...and...uh...we'd spend the night and part\nof the next day. Relax a little bit, have some fun, drink some good wine. I learned to eat\npate for the first time and...Milhouse 1s in...uh...SS Lorraine...that part of France and they\nmade wonderful pat\u00e9. So this time we got there early evening. We turned in. Didn't have\nall that wonderful hospitality. And in the middle of the night, we got back in our trucks\nand we went back to , and that night we loaded up and we did that three times in 8 days.\nEsy was not with me on the Exodus ones. I don't remember why not, but she wasn't.\nAnd...uh...when I left I said to her as I always did, \"I'll be back when I get here,\" and all\nshe would say to people who called was, \"I am sorry. He's out of town. Have you tried\nthe Munich office?\" Uh...This was the longest I had been away. And she allowed as how\nshe was a little bit apprehensive, but nothing we could do about it. That's how the people\ngot on the exodus. The French Haganah did a superlative job in getting all those trains.\nUh...That's a lot of bribery for the railway officials to... These were private trains. These\nweren't just seats on train. Twelve hundred people is a lot of...lot of people. So these were\nthree transports of between a thousand and twelve hundred each, and the other\napproximately two thousand went by train from Germany. Then the exodus story doesn't\nend there. It goes on because as people should know, the British sent that ship back. Not\nthe ship. The ship stayed in Haifa Harbor. It's still there. By the way, it's falling apart. It is\ndisintegrating and will not last forever. They've tried to preserve it. It's not working very\nwell. It's been in a museum for quite awhile. They sent the people back in three ships to a\nplace called Port Luke, where they went on a hunger strike. They wouldn't get off. The\nBritish took them off by force, and then put them back on again and shipped them around\nto Hamburger in the British zone where they were taken, by I think, truck or train to two\nconcentration camps. One 1s called Amistow and one is called Popendorf where they\nincarcerated them. One of the things Abe Klausner did was organize their escape with a\nbunch of the Haganah people, and they escaped. And one of my great stories was\ngreeting some of them again at Nooam when they went a second time. I don't know how\nmany of them went the second time by Haganah, but I had all transport of them one\nnight, twelve hundred of them who went. They landed on Cyprus. Cyprus requires\nspecific mention. We made jokes about Cyprus. We are going to have a Jewish State, but\nit's not going to be an ordinary state. It's already an empire. It has a colony. Cyprus.\nBecause we had tens of thousands of Jews interned on Cyprus by the British in\nconcentration camps. The first immigrants who came into Israel after independence were\nthe people from Cyprus. They had priorities. God knows they had earned them, and they\ncame through. That was Cyprus. I have never been to Cyprus. I should go there some\nday. What's next Linda?",
        "Q: Okay. Where did you...What did you do after the exodus transport or do you want to go\nback?",
        "A: Uh...I think we ought to do the baby before we forget it.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: A good friend of mine, displaced person, had a child. Called me from where they were,\ntold me that they were in terrible trouble. The child was born with infantile jaundice, and\nshe was getting dehydrated and they weren't sure she could live. It was particularly\npainful because they were displaced persons and looked forward to this child, even more\nparticularly painful for this father was a physician and didn't know how to save his child.\nSo Esther and I got into our truck...our car...1t was truck, and we went to that town to be\nwith them. When I got there the father told me in the most agonized tones I have ever\nheard that he had a decision to make and didn't know how to make it. That 30 or 40 miles\ndown the road, not in the country, was a very famous German...uh...obstetrician,\npediatrician, who was barred from practicing medicine because he had not only been a\nNazi, but he had done experiments on Jewish children. But, said the father, this man can\nsave my daughter if anybody can. He has unique information and methods that nobody in\nthis hospital knows about. I said, \"I don't think I am asking you. I think I am going to tell\nyou. Your daughter's life is more important than the fact that this man was a Nazi. If he\ncan save your daughter's life, that's saving the world for you. You gotta do it.\" So he\ndecided we better do that. So I went down in my jeep and met this doctor who was living\nin a little cabin in the woods. A very dignified, middle-aged man who spoke relatively\ngood English. I told him the circumstances and said we would pay him well to come and\ntake care of this child. And he said, \"Alright.\" And he got into the jeep with his bag and\nhe came. And he spent about 48 hours without sleep taking care of this baby. And he\nsaved her. After it was all over, I drove him back to his cabin and gave him German\nmoney, a large sum and I said, \"I trust that's enough for your services.\" He said, \"I don't\ncare about the money.\" He said, \"I want a letter from you addressed to military\ngovernment saying that you recommend that I be permitted to practice again because I\nsaved this Jewish child.\" Now I said, in effect, \"Doctor, you should live so long.\" And I\nleft the money, and I left with him not being very happy with me. The end of this story 1s\nnot a pleasant one. The child developed acute leukemia at the age of 4 and died. The\nfamily had other children, but that was a bad blow. That was in the United States. Okay.\nYou know who to talk to if you want more about that one, and if that person says to you,\n\"Cut it completely,\" I insist you have to do so. She has a perfect right to her privacy and\nif this 1s too much to identification it's got to go. Next, after the exodus we went into a\nbad time. Uh...First of all, all the stuff was going on at the United Nations. Would there\nbe a Jewish State, whether or not there would be a Jewish State, where they'd be\npartitioned, wouldn't there be partition and what should we be doing meanwhile. So I sat\nin my office day after day in Heidelberg doing not very much. Uh...Taught English to a\ncouple of medical students at Heildelberg University. Uh...This, I think, is worthwhile\nstory. Uh...The University gave 15 fellowship to Jewish survivors to study medicine. Full\ntuition and books. Three of them I still have communication with. One of them was my\nsecretary's husband, and...uh...he practices as an internist in New York, and we are good\nfriends. I taught him English. She was my secretary because she spoke Hebrew, German,\nYiddish, Hungarian, Russian, and was a remarkable woman. She still is. Her husband 1s a\ngood doctor. Two of them are my story really. It...uh...has to be told backwards. About\ntwo years ago, here in Washington, my wife attended a seminar at the Washington School\nof Psychiatry, being conducted by two very imminent psychiatrists from the University of\nCincinnati Medical School, named Ornstein. Anna and Paul Ornstein. They had the full\nday and Esther went up at the end to thank them, and Anna said to her, \"Tell me your\nname again. I want to remember you.\" She told her her name. Paul, who was standing\nabout 10 feet away, came over and said, \"What did you say your name was?\" She told\nhim. He said, \"Are you by any chance related to...to Chaplain Lipman.\" Anybody who\ncalls me Chaplan Lipman goes back to Germany. She said, \"Yes, I am married to him.\"\nAt which point, he bursts into tears, threw his arms around her and wouldn't let her go.\nHe and Anna had been two of those medical students in Heidelberg. Very poor. They had\na room in a German house. The Germans would do nothing for them. They lived, aside\nfrom going to medical school which they wanted to do, for Friday night for whenever I\nwas in town we had a Shabbat service, and if anybody else could conduct one when I\nwasn't there, they had a Shabbat service, followed by a Shabbat dinner for all the Jews in\nthe area. Displaced persons, G.I.s, the Palestinians who might be passing through because\nour house was a way station for any illegal going through. We had 4 bedrooms on the\nthird floor with 12 army cots and we had as many as 14 people on a given night.\nUh...And then of course the arms and the czar. They came and went without us. They had\na key to the cellar and they moved out. After the service and dinner, we sit around and\ntalked. And it was the only adult conversation these people had and they thought of the\nChaplain as somebody very special. The next night after this revelation, Paul gave a\nlecture in Washington and I went and then we went out afterwards to drink coffee and\nbegin to catch and he looked at me and he smiled and he said, \"You know. It's eerie.\" I\nsaid, \"Why?\" He said, \"You are only 4 years older than I am.\" I said, \"Oh, you're thinking\nof that Chaplain.\" He said, \"That's right. I have never quite gotten rid of that image.\" I\nsaid, \"Please get rid of it (laughter) real fast.\" And we have seen a great deal of one\nanother since then, and are good friends. The person who saved their lives in Heildelberg\nwas a Protestant minister. Herman Maus,...uh... whom I call the of Heildeberg. I read an\narticle about him once. He had been a very famous pastor...uh...before World War II was\npastor of the Holy Ghost Church of Heidelberg. He had become a Zionist in 1933\nbecause when he grew up in Titisay in the Black Forest, his father, a poor pastor, had not\nbeen able to send him to college. A Jew in Titisay came to him and said, \"Herman, you\nwant to be a pastor like a father don't you?\" And he said, \"Yes. You have to go to school,\ndon't you.\" \"Yes. Okay, you go to school and I will take care of the bills. You just be a\ngood pastor.\" The year he graduated and was ordained the Jewish friend said, \"Herman,\nyou've done well. Before you take up your first congregation, you have a vacation\ncoming. He handed him some money and told him to take a vacation. And he went to\nSwitzerland and he turned up in Bail during the 1903 Zionist Convention, the famous one\nat which the Uganda Resolution was turned down, and he met Hertzl and he met Nordau\nand he met all of those people, and he joined up. David Yellin became his particular\nfriend. He made his first trip to Palestine with his wife and daughter in 1933 this summer,\nand he said to David Yellin, \"I'm not going back. There is where I belong and this is\nwhere I want to stay.\" And Yellin said to him, \"Herman, you haven't earned the right to\nstay. You have to go back and to earn it.\" The daughter said, \"My father can go back. I\nam not going.\" And the daughter remained in Jerusalem, became a weaver, until after\nWorld War II. When her father got very old, she went back to care of them because the\nmother couldn't anymore. But she lived in Palestine the whole time. He came back and\nbecause he was a pacifist, he went to every peace meeting there was anywhere in Europe\ncarrying messages about how to get Jewish kids out, how to save this, how to save that,\nand he did that until 1941 when the Germans picked him up and put him in a\nconcentration camp. And he and his wife both spent the war years in a concentration\ncamp, and they both survived. He came back and became Dean of the Diocese, that's\nsecond to the Bishop and did several things which were characteristic of him. First of all,\nevery Yom Kippur, he spent all day in the synagogue and fasted as penance for the\nGermans. Second of all, he announced to his congregation, that is to the people he dealt\nwith, that for the rest of his life he would never preach a sermon on a New Testament\ntheme. That it was time that Christians went back to their origins and learned what they\nshould have been. He preached only out of the Hebrew bible for the rest of his life, and\nhe never missed. I know that. Third of all, every Jewish displaced person around he\nwould take food to. He visited all of these students at least once a week bringing them\nfood on condition that they tell nobody. My secretary never told me that she ever had a\nvisit from him. Anna and Paul told me last year about their relationship with Maus. Maus\nhad been to my home. I had been to his home. He took me to meet Carl Yasburs, and we\nhad an incomprehensible conversation one day (laughter) and...uh..but he never told me.\nNo one told me. They kept their promise. He looked after these people. I think it's\nabsolutely fitting that there is a large forest in Israel named for him, and it pleases me.\nYou know this 1s all part of the Heidelberg saga.",
        "Q: Yes. Let us break at this point. We're going to break and change tapes.",
        "A: You know what we ought to do?",
        "Q: What?",
        "A: It's a quarter after 2:00. My own suggestion would be that we break until you have a\nchance to read this stuff and I have a chance to go through the letters. I have mentioned a\nnumber of times the role that luck played in getting results and coincidence. Luck every\none in awhile reunited a family. I have one particular memory of being in my office in\nRegensburg, and a young woman came in, kind of agitated and excited. She had heard a\nrumor. She had no living relatives so far as she knew. Everybody had been killed, but she\nheard a rumor that maybe her younger brother had survived and was in Germany. And I\nsaid, \"Do you have any idea where?\" And she said, \"Yal. I think so.\" I said, \"The way to\nfind out is to go there. There's no point in trying to do it...uh...by any other way.\" So we\ngot in my jeep and we went. We got to this town and found a Jew and asked around and it\nwas her brother and he was there. And we really should have tape recorders in those days.\nEvery recording of the looks on their faces as they met each other, each\nbelieving...having been forced to believe that the other was dead. Every once in awhile a\ntragedy occurred however in this connection. I remember a case, sad case, which has\nsince been written up in the annals of Jews Law. I didn't decide it. A guy came in to one\nof our communities, lived there, and did not know what had become of his wife. Went on\nthe assumption that she was killed. We took a sort of informal position. Jewish law didn't\npermit it, but we took it informally that as a certain date there would be a presumption\nthat anybody who hadn't been heard from was dead. I don't remember whether it was 2\nyears or what length of time. And we...we knew this was an informal,\nnot...uh...sanctioned, position in Jewish law, but...uh...people had to get on with their\nlives. And a lot of people were just plain missing. There was no way to find out. And this\nman met a woman, wanted to marry her, and...uh...the time came and they married. And 6\nmonths later, his first wife turned up. She had been off in Soviet Union over in Siberia\nsomewhere and it had taken a long time for her to get out and to come to Germany.\nUnder Jewish law, of course, he had to divorce both of them. And as happens so often,\none does not hear the end of the story. I don't know with which one he ended up. I am not\nsure that it matters at this point. The dilemma...that was a very poignant one, and the fact\nthat I have only one story out of the many hundreds of people...uh...with whom I came\ninto contact during those 3 years is, I think, a marked statement of the propriety of\nmaking a decision that just set a date after which you have to gamble. You gamble. For\nmost of the people, they had a little mazal and the gamble was okay. When they married,\nthey could stay married. I don't think it's good luck that one's first spouse is dead, but\nthere it is",
        "Q: Under what circumstances did you leave Europe?",
        "A: We finished our work. We had a huge celebration in November when the partition plan\nwas announced...uh.......decided not to send transports thereafter because what was the\npoint of...of that, and then changed our minds because it was a good idea to keep pressure\non the British and have more people go to Cyprus. So we did somewhat. Not a great deal\nthough. Much of it by then was being done from Constansus or from Italy, not from\nFrance, and I simply don't know about those operations. One of the generalizations that\nyou have to know about is that none of us knew anything we didn't have to know. People\nkeep asking me did you know so and so who worked on this. One of my closest friends in\nthe kibitz in Israel 1s a man who was one of the leaders of the Berichah in Italy. I never\nmet him in Europe. I met him in 1960 when I got to the kibbutz because he was not my\nbusiness. I knew what I had to know and nothing else. In Washington, it's called \"need to\nknow.\" Uh...the doctrine of secrecy. But by February, March of 1948, it was clear that the\nState would come in to be, and that our work, Berichah, would end. There would be lots\nof people at the camps, a lot of to become Israelis would have to stay there. To help and\nto work and to teach and all the things that they were doing legally, but I was none of\nthose things. My operation would end. I turned down, with thanks, the suggestion, an\nurgent one, from of my...uh...I[sraeli friends that I take Esther and our one and half\nchildren and go to Israel and fly for the upcoming air force which at that point had one\nand a half piper cubs, I think. I said, \"No, Thanks, that...that isn't how I wanted to die,\" as\na matter (laughter) and decided very reluctantly to go home. Mostly because of the war.\nThat there was a war coming was clear, and...uh... I had had my war. So, in...uh...April of\n48, we tried to get out of Germany. It was almost as hard to get out of Germany as it was\nto get into Germany because the American Army had forms and you had to fill them out,\nand a pregnant wife caused problems. We wanted desperately to go to Norway. I have a\nthing for Scandinavia, and take the Oslo home. They wouldn't let us. The Oslo did not\nhave a full-time physician on board. Although my wife was having the healthiest\npregnancy in the history of the world, but there had to be a ship with a doctor. The Army\nwould not take responsibility. So we decided to come home on the SS America from\nLauf, and we close up the house and shipped everything home. Michael was very\ndisturbed because nothing he was ever going to see again. He was 3, and....uh...he\ncouldn't bring his dog, and I think that bothered him more than anything else. He...uh...he\nreally a mess. But we got to Paris, settled in for a couple of days and went to the boat .\nTwo of the people in the world closest to us were Eva Kaufman, now Eva Kaufman Penn,\nand her late husband, Rabbi Jay Kaufman. They had gone to Jerusalem in 1946 for Jay to\nget a doctorate at Hebrew University. Uh...They tried to leave the United States in the\nmiddle of the Maritime strike, and they got held up, and stayed at our house in Staten\nIsland. When they left they were allowed to go, but they couldn't take the car. They had\nPalestine and stayed with us until Paul was done. It was this kind of relationship. Then\nthey disappeared in the wilds of Jerusalem. What we heard about them once in awhile\nwas from Jay's parents who would drop us a note saying they got a letter. They were\nokay, and then we didn't get that any more for awhile because Jerusalem was under siege,\nand they were in the of Jerusalem. We were in Paris, and we went to to the and Michael\nwas riding a little kiddie car up and down the platform, and we suddenly heard a scream.\nIt was Eva. She and Jay had tickets for the same ship to come home. Coincidence. And\nshe was 2 weeks more pregnant than Esther, and we had a 5 day trip across the Atlantic\nwhich was an extraordinary experience, just trying to catch up with one another with\nthese two very pregnant ladies. Their son, their first child, was born on Israel's\nindependence day, and our second child was born 2 weeks later. I had had an offer from\nHenry Montaur, the head of the UJA, and the world's greatest fund raiser in all of history.\nI would add here that the 1948 UJA campaign raised a hundred and 80 million dollars. As\nof that date, that was the largest fund raising campaign in private hands in the history of\nthe world. And it was not surpassed for quite awhile. Now, of course, it sounds like small\nmoney thanks to inflation, but 1t was an absolutely amazing out-pouring of money.\nUh...And I spent 3 months doing speaking full time. One of my first speeches was on the\nnight of Israel's independence. I went to Norfolk, Virginia, to speak. Why was I sent to\nNorfolk? Because the featured speaker was the Senator from Kentucky, Alban Berkley,\nshortly to become Vice President of the United States. Now Barkley was one of the\nworld's worst speakers in terms of content, but he was an affable pleasant guy and he\nloved Jews. And he went around making speeches for Jews and for Israel and for Zionism\nall the time. So he was to be the featured speaker. He made a very short speech. He\nwalked over, wrapped himself in the Israel flag, and the cameras popped and I made a\nsort of content speech. Only later I discovered how much money he was paid for all the\nspeeches he made for the Zionist movement and for Israel and for the UJA and the rest.\nFortunately, I make it a practice not to have illusions about public figures, so I didn't get\ndisillusioned about him. Uh...He was not a pleasant experience. Most of them were very\npleasant experiences because to watch people give more money than they ought to\ngive...uh...has its beauties. And the statements they made. Uh...I didn't fight in the second\nWorld War. I was too old. I was not involved in the decimation of our people in Europe.\nTherefore, the least I can do is pay for it. And the money poured in. Unbelievable\namounts of money. I learned to respect sacrificial giving for the first time. There has been\nvery little of it, of course, but I respect 1t when I find it. I was invited to go to Hawaii to\nopen their campaign. That was exciting. Never been to Hawaii. And I understood that the\nHawaii Jewish community was all excited. When you're that far away, you get more\nexcitement. Excitement grows in direct proportion to the distance from the action.\nAnd...uh...Montra called, asked me to go. I said, \"What dates?\" And he said, \"Well, the\naffair is on June 2nd, but you would have to go a day or 2 early because it's a long way.\"\nAnd I said, \"Forget it. Not me. We're due to have a baby right on June 2nd.\" And...uh...he\nkinda said, \"So what?\" And I understood that. I said, \"Well, I wasn't there when the first\none was born, and I have solemn advice from my wife that if I am not there when the\nsecond one is born, there won't be a third and I won't have a wife. And I believe her.\"\nAnd he was a little bit upset, but he accepted that. As it happens, the child was born on\nJune the Ist so it was very sensible of me to stay home. Those 3 months were exhilarating\nand exhausting. And then I settled down for the first time since I had become a Rabbi to\nbe a Rabbi. I accepted a position at our seminary to teach and to get my doctorate and we\nmoved to Cincinnati and became people for the first time. No longer did our son Michael\nget into a pullman berth and say, \"Home,\" which he had done a number of times when he\nwas 2 years old and traveling constantly. I'm done. Finished.",

        "A: Eugene Lipman.",
        "A: Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, October 13, 1919.",
        "A: Uh...My father was a small jeweler in the mill district of Pittsburgh, my mother a\nPittsburgher by the way. My father was born in Europe...uh...had and raised children and\nwas the compliant homemaker. Uh...We never had any money. My grandparents,...uh...all\nfour, lived in Pittsburgh until my grandfather, my paternal went off to Palestine. In 1925\nor 6 came back for my Bar Mitzvah celebration, and then came back permanently during\nWorld War II because the idea of the Germans taking over Palestine was an unpleasant\nidea to him and so he came back and he died in Pittsburgh. We are a long lived family.\nMy paternal grandfather was 93 at the time of his death. Uh...I grew up in this mill\ndistrict of Pittsburgh to the age of 7, then moved to the ghetto of Squirrel Hill because I\nhad to go to Hebrew and all the synagogues and Hebrew schools were in Squirrel Hill,\nand I completed my high school education at High School, 40 percent Jewish\nand...uh...finished in 1936, by which time I had already decided to be a Rabbi. And\nstarted the Pitt because I could live at home and go to Pitt. This was depression time. And\nthen in 38...Solomon Freuhauf who was my mentor in this Rabbi business decided that I\nwas wasting my time in Pittsburgh and sent me off to Cincinnati. I went to Hebrew\nCollege in Cincinnati and the University of Cincinnati at the same time. They were across\nthe street from the other...from each other. They still are. And...uh...got my degree from\nUniversity of Cincinnati, finished 1t HUC in 1943, having accelerated a year because they\nneeded chaplains so badly. And...uh...so we went to school for 22 straight months in\norder to accomplish this. No professor would allow us to give up a course. How can you\nbe a chaplain without my course in mid rush five, one of them was known to say. Uh...It\nwas required by the military that you have a year of experience before you can go into\nchaplaincy, and so I replaced a Rabbi in Fort Worth, Texas, who went into the Navy and\nspent a very uncomfortable year there. I was 23 years old and everybody I met in the\nstreet 23 years old was in uniform. Uh...The entire American army was in Texas.\nAnd...uh...I was not in uniform so as soon as I could get into uniform, I got into uniform.\nUh...We had married...in...1943, the day after ordination. It was a long weekend,\nand...uh...by the time I went into the military, Esther was pregnant with our first child.",
        "A: Well, I had decided very early on that my war in World War II was the European theater,\nnot the Pacific theatre, even though I wavered on that because of something I'll mention\nin a minute. But I had really decided that I wanted to go to Germany and I had asked the\nChief Chaplain's office to ship me to Germany. Going overseas was unavoidable. I knew\nthat. And so...uh...1n February of 1945, I got orders to go overseas and didn't get there\nuntil April because that's the war the army worked. The...uh...thing I didn't mention to\nyou was that while I was in Fort Worth, a member of my congregation who had\nrabbinical connections...uh..asked me, right after Yom Kippur services, as a matter of\nfact, if I had ever thought about becoming a pilot. Uh...He taught fairy pilots, the women\npilots.",
        "A: His name was Stanley Herst, and he had rabbinical connections. He came up to me after\nservices on Yom Kippur and introduced himself. We had never met. I had been there all\nof about 4 weeks after all, and said that all his adult wanted to teach a Rabbi to fly and all\nRabbis were chicken. And being 23, I wasn't having any of that and I said, \"When do we\nstart.\" And he said, \"Tomorrow morning at 7 o'clock.\" And (laughter) I said, \"No. I can't\ndo it tomorrow. Give me a couple days.\" Because, among other things, I didn't have a\nflight jacket. And in those days, you had to wear a yellow jacket. You couldn't go up in\nan airplane. They were open. There were no closed airplanes. That's a long time ago. So\nhe taught me to fly in his little piper cub which went 70 miles an hour maximum, and I\nnotified the...uh...Jewish Welfare Board and the Chief Chaplain's office that I was doing\nthis in case it was of interest. And the Chief Chaplain's office was very interested, they\nsaid. So I got my license and...uh...after Chaplain's school, which was 5 weeks we got our\nassignments and I was signed to the armored force. And I thought, you know, \"Typical\nArmy screw up!\" But...uh...It was done deliberately. I found out that they just didn't want\nChaplains flying airplanes. They wanted Chaplains praying for troops. And so I did go to\nEurope instead of doing Island hopping in the Pacific was what they had been talking\nabout. So I arrived in Europe in...uh...April 1945. The...uh...voyage was of interest\nhistorically. I became the radio announcer on the plane...I...on the ship. I probably was\nthe only one who could read English, something of the sort. And several times a day I did\nnews broadcasts, which I had written from whatever material they could garner.\nUh...Historically, I guess the most important thing I did was announce the death of\nFranklin Roosevelt...uh...who died while we were on our way overseas. That was a very\ndiscouraging and depressing...uh...1dea. Who...who was Truman became a very important\nquestion to those of us who were on our way overseas. We also had a...uh... marathon\nbridge game going. It should be noted for historical record that nobody in my Army\ncareer ever suggested that we play bridge for money. Never did. There were eight of us in\nthis bridge game and we cut in and cut out for all kinds of necessary purposes, like sleep.\nAnd...uh...I didn't get a good hand (laughing) in 14 days. Several million points were\ninvolved in my losses. Uh...I also agreed to...uh...box for the only time in my life,\nbecause they were having a series of boxing matches and they couldn't find a heavy\nweight to fight against this lieutenant who was crazy enough to volunteer, but he had\nfought a couple of times before. We sort of sparred around for three rounds.\n[...uh...developed a strep ear toward the end of the voyage and was taken by ambulance\nfrom dockside to an Evac hospital just outside Lahov in France. And the rumor went\naround that this guy I had fought against had beaten me up so badly that I had been\nhospitalized. And...uh...rumor also went around that I was being sent back home again\nbecause I was so sick. I heard that long after I got into Germany. Couple...couple of\npeople were surprised to see me. I was in this hospital for 3 days. The hospital chaplain,\nwho was bored out of his mind,...uh... stole a couple of bicycles and he and I peddled\neach night into this little village where he had met a French couple, and we played bridge\nin French, which was fun. Uh...Eventually, though, that had to stop and I had to get to\nwork. So I...uh...was put onto a troop train headed for Germany. Typical 40 and 8 box car\nand I staked out my little piece of turf big enough for my pack and me, and then I was\nstanding at the entrance to this box car waiting for the train to start and some sergeant\nwas walking up and down yelling, \"Who can talk French? Who knows some French?\"\nSo, one never volunteers, but he wasn't getting anybody and I said,...uh... \"Will some\nFrench do?\" And he says, \"Three words will do. And Colonel needs a French translator.\"\nSo I went back to the Colonel, an old regular Army man, obviously unsuccessful because\nhe was in the transportation corps running these troop trains which didn't require much\nmilitary skill. And he was delighted to see me, and I was moved into his car which was\nnot a box car. It was a heated Pullman car and...uh...I lived very well for 5 days going\ninto France. Uh...My job was every time the...uh... train stopped to tear up to the other\nend to the engineer and ask him what was wrong. And he told me, \"Signal.\" (laughing)\nEvery time, it was \"Red Signal. I can't go.\" And I went back and told the Colonel who\nwas quite content to go on doing whatever he was doing. I had lots of bad books to read. I\nhad a fine, fine trip into Germany. Uh...wasn't wanted in Germany at that time. No one\nknew what to do with me. I was moved back to a town in Belgium called Verea,\nand...uh...as a casual. I did not have an assignment. And then V.E. day came, and we\ncelebrated V.E. day by going from our camp which was outside Verea into Verea to\nwatch the celebration and to celebrate. I was depressed. I didn't feel like celebrating. I\ndon't know why. I...Probably because I was alone, and...uh...couldn't think of much to\ncelebrate as a matter of fact. The world was over, but in the square in Verea, I saw some\nmen and women in concentration camp uniforms. Clearly! Uh...I knew what they were,\nand they were standing over there, and I walked over toward them. They recognized my\ninsignia and crowded around because I was the first American Jew that they had run into.\nThey were Buchenwald graduates, and they were the first survivors of the Holocaust\nwhom I met. Uh... They didn't want anything. I didn't have anything. Uh... But we talked,\nand...uh...they did a lot, my first concentration stories, my first Holocaust stories. They\nwere followed by thousands more Holocaust stories over the course of the next 3 years. I\ndid get an assignment to 22nd Corps Headquarters in the Rhineland. Our town was\nHildan, not to far from Cologne, and I moved in. Large territory, all of the Rhineland,\nincluding Cologne. A lot of troops. Theoretically, we were conducting services for all\nthose troops. I got a jeep and went to work. Early discovered that a lot of German Jews\nand a lot of East European Jews had come into the area not in displaced persons camps,\nbut living on their own where they could find a place to live, which many of them could\nnot do. So I began to do three things. First of all to push military government to find\nhousing for them; second, to see that they got food because they had no source of income\nand they did not get UNRRA food because they were not in a UNRRA installation.\nAnd...uh...some clothing because they were still wearing concentration camp uniforms,\nand that was not a very good idea. Uh...So my services with American soldiers consisted\nof a gang coming together. There were about 10 of these a week, and my saying to\nthem,...uh... \"Anybody need to say cottage, ...uh...there was frequently somebody who\nneeded to say cottage, so we had a short service cottage, and then I said, \"Let's go. We\nneed food. Let's go get it.\" And after the first time in each of these installations, anybody\nwho could beg, borrow or steal a truck...uh...came with truck, and we went to army\ndepots and we got food. Uh...Sometimes was able to sign for it. I have often had a\nnightmare about the army catching up with my memorandum receipts...uh...and they will\nsome day. My great, great, great grandchildren may have a problem with the army...uh...I\nknow that they catch up, because about 1947 or 48, my uncle who fought in France in\nWorld War I got a bill from the United States Army for $45 for a pistol that he had\nsigned a memorandum receipt for in France, and had never turned in. ...Uh...Actually, he\nhad turned it in, but the Army didn't think so. So he had a correspondence with the army\nfor many, many moons about that money for the...I think this was all those years later...so\nsomeday... Most of the time, though, we didn't bother to sign for it. We just stole it. And\nthere were millions of tons of supplies stashed in depots around the area and...uh...they\nshould be used. And they were. We also managed to get hold of some kinds of clothing.\nCouldn't use uniforms, of course, but there was underwear. There were socks. There were\nshoes. There were jackets and things like that. So, we were starting a pretty good system\ngoing when orders came out moving us. Uh...The British were taking over our area.\nThere had been negotiations and most of the Rhineland became British zone. And in\ntypical army fashion we were moved as far as you could get, which was Plezn,\nCzechoslovakia. We packed up and we started across Germany. Before that\nhappened...after we got the notice that the British were coming in and before we left, I\ndecided that I better do something in this part of Germany that needed doing for me. I\nwent to Dachau. Took a 3 day pass and took my jeep and went down to Dachau where\nAbe Klausner, my classmate, ...uh...was working fulltime, and Klausner's a story unto\nhimself, and we'll probably get around to it in the course of this thing. Uh...My reaction\nto Dachau was what exactly what you would expect somebody's reaction to Dachau to be.\nThere was still 30 odd thousand Jews there. Some were dying each day cause there was\nno way for them to make it. Most of them were going to live. They didn't look like they\nwere going to live, but the Army medical people, who are very good by the way, said\nthey were going to live. Abe was in the same business that I was in, only more so as he\nhad this fine clothing for them. I remember the day that he got 38 thousand pairs of shoes\nout of a German Army warehouse just by going in, opening the doors, and taking them.\nAnd...uh...Every day he had people to bury. I...uh...often have said to people who are\nskeptical about the size of the Holocaust that if they would like me to step off\napproximately how many...uh...feet of space it takes in full directions to make a rectangle\nthat would hold 70,000 dead Jews, I know how to do that because I have seen them.\nUh...I stayed those 3 days with Abe and then went back. On the way to Czechoslovakia,\nwe went through Buchenwald. And once and for all...uh...the myths got exploded that the\nGermans didn't know about concentration camps cause when we went into the marvelous\nold town of Yana, and into the wonderful former capitol of the German Republic of\nWeimar, I saw smoke. And I asked what it was, and those were the fires, not\nthe...uh...crematorium fires, but the fires at the Buchenwald concentration camp where\nthere were still people. You could see them. They were only 3, 4 miles away from each of\nthose two towns. I have a funny feeling that when the wind blew the right...blew the right\nway during those years...uh...you could smell Buchenwald without any trouble. We got to\nPlzen, and I settled into my room, and to my office. Uh...Two things happened in fairly\nshort order, one of which is...uh...just of historic interest. The other of which transformed\nmy life. I'll do the easy one first. I got a phone call. It was the Bishop of Plzen, a Catholic\nBishop who told me his name, which I don't remember. And I said to him, \"Sir, I.. (You\nsee he had some English)...that you want my Catholic colleague, Chaplain Straun,\" and\nhe said, \"No. You're the Rabbi, aren't you?\" And I said, \"Yes Sir.\" And he said, \"You're\nthe man I want to come to see, he said, \"You don't have to come out here.\" It was a\ncouple of miles from us to the center of town where the cathedral was. \"I am coming\ndown this evening. I'll stop in.\" And I went to see him. And I met for the first time a\nbishop who looked like a bishop. You know, the long robes, the pointed toes, shoes, the\nwhole business, and he greeted me very warmly and said that he wanted to take me\nsomewhere. Didn't want to explain too much, but that...uh...1t will be a great relief to one\nof his parishioners if I would go with him. I said, \"Alright,\" and we made a date for the\nnext afternoon. We went into the old part of Plzen, which is centuries old. These\nwonderful 4 and 5 story apartment buildings, which looked like a slum on the outside and\nare often very nice on the inside, and I was introduced to a man named Snyder, an\nengineer, who told me the following story. In the building in which he lived, a neighbor\nhad been...Rabbi Katz, the Rabbi of the congregation in Plzen. The synagogue, by the\nway, was still standing. We cleaned it out. It had been made a warehouse, of course, by\nthe Germans, and it was rededicated and used by the Jews who happened to be in Plzen\nduring that time. It may still be used. I have no idea. (Sigh) Rabbi Katz and Mr. Snyder,\nbecame very close friends because they both had an interest in French impressionist\npaintings, and they both collected what they could afford to collect. In 1938, when the\nNazis came in, the Rabbi said to Snyder, \"They are going to take our pictures because\nthey want paintings. They steal paintings. Let's hide them. Snyder, being an engineer,\nwas ingenious, and he took his living room which was 40 feet long, by the way. One of\nthese European saloon-type rooms, and he built a fake wall 3 feet in from the regular\nwall, and that wall was covered with book shelves and other nice things, with one a\ntypical spring door. He took me inside, and there were all the paintings which they had\nstashed away, both Rabbi Katz's and his. His agreement with Rabbi Katz was that,\nobviously, if Katz came back...uh...the paintings would be his...his paintings. If he did not\ncome back, all the paintings would be Snyder's. Uh...He also left some books, and that's\nwhy the Bishop had taken me. His most precious books. Rabbi Katz was killed in\nAuschwitz, his whole family, so there was nobody to inherit either the paintings or the\nbooks. And I took the books at Snyder's request. An interesting group of 4, 5 books. Not\nhis library, just the books he cared most about. One 2 volume set turns out to be precious.\nIt's now in the rare book room of our seminary in Cincinnati. It's one of two copies of this\n1520 Hebrew edition of one of the great classics... uh...1n the whole world. The other one\nis at Oxford. Uh...There were some German poems, beautiful edition, which I gave to\nSylvia. We'll come across Sylvia shortly, and...uh...a Hebrew New Testament, 17th\nCentury, which I gave to the Bishop. And...uh...for myself, I kept and sent home an\nalbum of Visidor Kaufman, a prince. Visidor Kaufman was a fine classical Jewish painter\nof the beginning of the 20th century who was himself Austrian and got interested in East\nEuropean types. And his paintings of East European Jews and East European scenes are\nclassics. And...uh...I have been distributing those to friends, and I have one or two of\nthem. That was my visit with the Bishop, and these books. The same day there was a\nknock on my door and a little woman walked in, in an American Red Cross uniform.\nUh...Sylvia was maybe 5 feet tall, a skinny little thing, very good looking, about 10 years\nolder than I, and she told me the following story. She was a social worker who had been\npart of the social work department at Steven Wise Free Synagogue, which was then just\ncalled Free Synagogue because Steven Wise was still living. And she had worked for\nWises, and told wonderful stories about Steven Wise. When America got into the war, he\nsaid to her, \"You have to go into the Red Cross.\" And she said, \"Why? To feed donuts to\nG.I.'s?\" And he said, \"Yes, because in Europe you are going to be in front line areas, and\nyou are going to be able to help Jews. There will be survivors, and they are going to need\nall kinds of help and you're just the type to do it.\" He was right. She was just the type.\nShe got into the Red Cross. She went to Europe, ...uh...opened one of the first\nconcentration camps in France...uh...organized all of the little kids, and middle sized kids\nwho survived, and that was the transport that went to Palestine legally...uh...after\nliberation. She landed in Czechoslovakia. I don't know how. And was the director of the\nRed Cross club in downtown Plzen. She had four other women working with her. And\nfrom early in the morning till 10 o'clock at night, she handed out donuts and coffee and\ntalked and chatted with American soldiers. Then they closed up for the night, and they\nopened the back door and the Jews started to come in for all sorts of things. Uh...Sylvia\nasked me if I wanted to help Jews. Since that's why I went to Europe, I agreed \"Yal,\"\nand...uh...asked her what was going on. She had been contacted by the Jewish Brigade\ngroup which was in Italy. They had been attached to the British army in Italy, had fought\nthrough the war, and at the end of the war were in town called Trevisio, way up in the\nItalian Alps. Immediately, they organized themselves to work with Jews and they sent\nambulances and they sent trucks over the hills into Austria and they began to move Jews\ninto Italy to get on ships, illegal of course, to go to Palestine, and would I help with this\nenterprise? We could send Jews from Czechoslovakia into Austria and the Brigade would\npick them up and take them to Italy. That sounded like a very intriguing idea to a 25 year\nold kid. Cops and robbers! And so Sylvia and I organized a movement out of the\nAmerican zone of Czechoslovakia. Actually, it was out of all of Czechoslovakia, because\nat that point the border between the American zone and the Russian zone was an open\nborder. We were still friendly. We mutually declared the Cold War only in August of\n1945. So I was given the 3rd language...uh...pass to go anywhere in Czechoslovakia I\nwanted to go for my purposes. And...uh...two things happened. First, Sylvia and I went\nover to Prague. There were 6,000 Jews in the Rothchild Hospital there without a place to\ngo, and new people were coming in all the time. Some from Theresienstadt. First time I\nhad heard of Theresienstadt. Others from further East coming West because they had no\nintentions of living in the East. Uh...Poland was not a place for Jews. Uh...They didn't\nwant to live in Hungary. They didn't want to Czech. They didn't want to live in Europe.\nThey wanted out. And they would come to a Jewish center hoping that somebody would\nhave some ideas about how to get out. They were also looking for relatives...uh...a very\nimportant function. We'll talk about that some more when we come back to Abe\nKlausner. We organized...uh...a way for these Jews in the Rothchild Hospital\nto...uh...receive railroad passes to come into the city of Plzen. From Prague to Plzen is\nonly about 40 or 50 miles. The only way to get there is by train. We then proceeded to\ntype one at a time...uh...passes, authorizing this person a United Nation's Stateless Person\nto travel from Prague to Plzen for the purpose of looking for relatives. We looked around\nPlzen for the biggest stamp we could find. I haven't any idea what it was about, but we\nfound one and got a little bunch of red stamp pads and we put big red stamps on this\nthing and signed the name of a non-existent American Colonel to this document.\nAnd...uh...We would collect them when the people came into Plzen and then take them\nback to Prague because I could travel. And...uh...leave them at our Headquarters, hospital\nand a new group would come. Uh...We wanted them to come a few at a time. We didn't\nwant large groups taking over trains, so they came in every day. And they reported to us\nat the Red Cross Club after 10 o'clock at night, and we drove them out to the Karlov\ndisplaced persons camp which was just on the edge of Plzen. It was an UNRRA camp.\nWe were able to do this because of a rather remarkable coincidence. I went out to the\ncamp to meet the Director and see if we could make a deal for our people to spend some\ntime in the camp. His name was Andrew C. Dunn, and when we met I said, \"Tell me.\nDoes the C stand for Carnegie?,\" and he said, \"How do you know?\" I said, \"Because\nanybody with named Dunn with the first name Andrew, the chances are fifty fifty that\nyour middle name would be Carnegie, and you have to be from Pittsburgh.\" And he said,\n\"Amazing.\" I said, \"Yal, So am I.\" And we talked and he said, \"Lipman. Lipman. Is your\nold man a jeweler?\" And I said, \"Yal.\" And he said, \"I bought my wedding ring from\nhim.\" His assistant, a woman named Fay Green, who many years later became his\nwife...uh...was intrigued by this whole business so he offered a five hundred in his camp..\nWe used for transportation to Austria and the answer was U.S. Army trucks. And who\ndrove them? U.S. Army personnel. Why did they do it? Scotch. And some money. We\ndid not want people doing us favors. We were commercial. Uh...We made a trip down to\nthe Austrian border and made the discovery that the only bridge across the\nDanu...Australian Rivers that we knew about was a military bridge and we weren't about\nto use that. So we went down the road looking for a way to get across that blasted river,\nand we found one. It was an old dam no longer in use, but serviceable and was just wide\nenough at the top for an Army 6-pode to get across with about 6 inches of play on each\nside. And that's the one we used. We went across the dam into Austria and found our way\neither to Lintz or to Gratz or to Saltsport, depending on whether the Brigade told us to\nbring this bunch of Jews. Others, 1t worked. But I have to tell you where we got the liquor\nbecause that involves one of my more favorite memories. I was entitled to a few bottles\nof Scotch a week as a... was a Captain by then. That wasn't enough because we needed at\nleast a dozen to 20 trucks or it wasn't worth taking the chance on the trip. Uh...One of the\nbreaks we got by the way...lots of breaks in this...Massel is not to be considered a minor\nthing. The...uh...sergeant in charge of our motor pool at Corps Headquarters. Now Corps\nHeadquarters has a lot of trucks. It just does. Uh...Corps a big thing. Was a sergeant\nnamed Katz, and he was from Brooklyn, and Sergeant Katz and I made a deal that he\nwould get truck drivers for me and trucks and we would pay with money and Scotch. As I\nrecall, it was 2 bottles per round trip or something like that. But where the Hell do you\nget Scotch in that kind of quantity? And I decided to take a real risk. I went to my senior\nchaplain, a Presbyterian from Kansas, Bird Colonel, full Colonel, but not regular army.\nHe was a reservist. A very, quiet, pleasant man. He said to me, \"You know, I haven't\nasked you any questions, but you travel a lot more than is comfortable for the Chief of\nStaff.\" Cause I was going to all the Jewish camps and communities and people I could\nfind all over Czechoslovakia. I was also going to Theresienstadt by then. We haven't\ncome to Theresienstadt yet. And he said...uh...Chief of Staff has asked...has asked me\nabout this and I said I would investigate it.\" He said, \"I can cover for you if I know where\nyou are going. And you haven't any reason to tell me where you are going, but you will\nhave to or I can't cover for you with the Chief of Staff,\" who is after all a 2-star General. I\nsaid, \"Okay. I'll make a deal with you. When I leave each day, I will put under your\nblotter a statement of where I am going, from town to town to town each day, and then\nI'll give you my trip ticket. And you validate it if you chose to do so.\" He said, \"Of\ncourse, I chose to do so. I know what you're doing and you got to do it.\" He did not know\nthat we were taking Jews to Austria, but he knew I was working with Jewish displaced\npersons and he thought that was absolutely essential. Bless him, said I. He says,\n\"Anything else I can do for you?\" And I said, \"Yal. You're a Bird Colonel. You get all the\nliquor you want, don't you?\" He said, \"I wouldn't know. I don't drink.\" I said, \"I knew\nthat, but you're about to.\" And he listened and he said a couple of people in supply are\ngoing to be awfully (laughing) surprised. I said, \"You don't have to explain what you're\ndoing with it. It's for charitable purposes that you getting into Protestant charities in\nCzechoslovakia which is your bound duty as a Christian.\" And he smiled and he thought\nthat made sense, and I got all the liquor I wanted from then on, on his tab. Bless his heart.\nI was...I heard of his death in the early 50s, and I was very sorry. He was a good, good\nman. He saved my life, and saved Jews. That operation worked very well until August\nwhen...uh...we got caught in one of the Austria towns. Red handed! The whole bunch of\nus! We had not yet transferred these people to the Jewish Brigade...uh...and we got\npicked up. And I got terrible reaming from a General who announced me that he was\ngoing to radio my General immediately, and I would be court-martialed.\nAnd...uh...General Hubner did not court martial me. General Hubner, who was known as\nthe little Patton, was a tough...uh...guy, but he wanted to get rid of Jews. He didn't want\nJews in his territory. I have to tell you the Jewish displaced persons were the only\ndisplaced persons who were difficult. All other displaced persons, and there were 20\nsome nationalities of displaced persons...Outer Mongolians, for example, that the\nGermans imported for labor purposes. They were grateful for being alive, for being fed\nby UNRRA where they ate better than they had eaten most of their lives, and they were\nno hurry to go home. The Jews were not grateful. The Jews were in terrible conflict over\nbeing alive, over having survived. They didn't like anybody very much and...uh...they\nwanted out, and nobody would let them out. And so they caused more trouble than\neverybody else put together. Some of us understood it. We tried to organize it so that it\nwasn't too difficult. In addition, of course, we had all the internal Jewish problems that\nwe always have. For example, within a month of liberation every Zionist party there was\nwas in business, and they all wanted paper for publications and they all wanted\neverything. It was not easy. And these were not pleasant people at that point, and I think\nthat should be understandable that they were not. So General Hubnere said, \"Get them out\nof here. I don't care.\" He didn't tell me that, but that's how he behaved. One incident will\nillustrate this. He called Sylvia and me in one day. Now I had never met General Hubner.\nUh...Captains don't monkey around much with 3-star generals. There are layers of\nbureaucracy in between, and certainly Red Cross women don't have a lot to do with\nGenerals, though Sylvia had had more to do with Hubner than most because she was\nalways making demands. Sylvia was a tough, tough lady. And Sylvia told the\nGeneral...uh...got what she wanted most of the time, because the General didn't want to\nmonkey with the Red Cross. He needed the Red Cross. Those donuts were very precious.\nDonuts and coffee kept American troops going. Uh...He called us in and said, \"I hear\nthere is going to be a Jewish meeting in London to talk about the future of all these\nJews.\" And we said, \"Yep.\" And he said, \"You're going. You go my plane. When does\nthe meeting start?\" And we told and he said, \"Okay. Two days before that, get out there\nand tell them for me to get all these Jews out of here. They should do everything they can\ndo to get them out fast. It's not good for them and it is not good for us either.\" And he\nsaid it not unkindly, but he wasn't smiling. And Sylvia and I flew to London to the special\nZionist Congress that was called in July in London, the chief purpose of which was to set\nthe course that would lead to...uh...Israel's independence 3 years later, which meant that\nBen-Gurion had a fight with Wietzman and Ben-Gurion wiped up the floor with\nWietzman in a 4 hour Yiddish speech which, for me, is pretty unforgettable. Uh...What\ndid he say? He did what Ben-Gurion always did. Ben-Gurion's idea of a speech was first\nto tell the history of the Jewish people, starting back with Abraham and working his way\nup. Sometimes I felt like he was going it minute by minute. Four hours was not his\nlongest speech. Uh...He has made longer. And then rehearsing the Zionist movement\nfrom Belu all the way up...uh...and then minute by minute the events of World War II,\nsubjectively stated so that Wietzman looked like an idiot who played the British and he\nwas the savior who was going to see to it that we had a Jewish State. And they believed\nhim. And Wietzman was really not in condition to do a proper answer. Wietzman aged 10\nyears in 5 days, and he became the old man, the inevitable person to the first President of\nthe State. Powerless and ceremonial. That's what Wietzman became as of that day. Ben-\nGurion became the leader of the Zionist movement. Uh...Sylvia and I did not spend much\ntime in sessions. We spent our time meeting people that Steven Wise told us to meet to\ntell them about Czechoslovakia, to tell them about displaced persons, to tell them about\nthe Haganah, and to urge certain kinds of support, none of which we had yet gotten. I met\nsome fascinating people. Uh...I discovered this Lord Reading. Rufus Isaacs had gout, and\nthat Lady Reading was really a lady and as passionate about...uh...Jewish things as any\nconvert could be and...uh...all the leaders of the Zionist movement wanted to hear from\nus. We were the only people there from the occupied territories. That is, from Germany,\nCzechoslovakia, Austria. Nobody else there. Because nobody could get there. It never\noccurred to them for some reason or other to send some displaced persons over to tell the\nthing first person. There wasn't a single one there. So we were busy. And the General\nmade that possible because that's how he wanted to get rid of the Jews. (Laughter)\nBenevolently! So he did not court martial me. He called me in. Actually, it was the Chief\nStaff who called me in and said, \"We got this TWX from Austria.\" \"Yes, Sir.\" \"What the\nHell have you been up to?\" \"TWX tells you what I have been up to.\" \"We can't allow\nthis.\" I said, \"No, I suppose not. What'll you do.\" He said, \"We're moving you so you\ncan't do it.\" Alright, that was fine. Sylvia could keep the thing going and then other\npeople took over. So far as I know some transports continued to go until the communists\ntook over Czechoslovakia.",
        "A: Yal.",
        "A: Go back to London.",
        "A: Yal.",
        "A: Huh? That has to do with Theresienstadt so we have to start.",
        "A: Yal.",
        "A: When I got to Prague the first time, I discovered there had been a concentration camp at\nTheresienstadt, or as the Czechs call it Terezin, north and a little bit west of Prague. So I\nwent there. There was still 16,000 Jews there with a Russian unit...uh...running the camp\nbecause it was in a Russian zone. And...uh...Theresienstadt was exactly what...uh...all the\npictures have ever shown it to be. It was an army barracks...uh...and wasn't bad, because\nTheresienstadt, I remind you, was the show-off concentration camp. That was the place\nthat the Red Cross came to. The International Red Cross was not exactly heroic during\nWorld War II, but they would go to Theresienstadt and make inspection...inspections and\nthen send out a report saying the concentration camp was fine. They had a band and gave\nconcerts and they had classes and they did all sorts of things. What they didn't say is that\neveryday transports left for the east and that none of those people survived. Leo Beck had\nsurvived by accident, by the way. There was somebody else named Beck in the camp,\nand they got mixed up and they sent that Beck off to East instead of Leo Beck. Leo Beck\nhad left by the time I got there. The Russians had flown him into the British zone, and the\nBritish had flown him to London where his only child, a daughter, lived. And...uh...We\nproceeded, the Russian and I, to make a very simple deal. He wanted to close the camp.\nWe wanted to close the camp. UNRRA had agreed that they would take this people to a\ntown called Begendorf in the American zone. It was just a case of getting them there, and\nI had trucks. So we made a deal to move all the Jews out of Theresienstadt to Begendorf\nand here I have to tell you another one of those absolutely uncanny coincidences. All of\nour conferences, the camp commander and I, took place in the presence of a third person\nwearing a plain uniform who was the Commissar, the political leader, and he ran things.\nHe sat there. Fortunately, he knew virtually no German. The only language the\nCommander and I had in common was German. Mine was fairly bad, and his was even\nworse. So we were talking German to each other, making ourselves understood and then I\nheard a word in a sentence that this man was saying, which was not German. It was a\nYiddish word with a Hebrew origin. Aw, said I, He has just sent me a signal. So in my\nnext paragraph, I carefully used a Yiddish word that had a Hebrew origin. Neither of us\nblinked an eye lash, but we both knew why he was going to work his head off to get those\nJews out of there and he wanted me to know why. I had a Jewish camp commander.\nNever again in the whole time I was there...those...almost 3 months did he allude to it.\nWe were never alone. The Commissar never let us alone. If I went there for lunch, the\nCommissar had lunch with us. He was with us every minute that I was in Theresienstadt.\nCame the last day. The last transport leaving Theresienstadt for Dagendorf, trucks all\nlined up, my jeep ready, my driver excited, Vic, and...uh...suddenly was a scream toward\nthe back of the transport, somebody yelling \"Halt.\" And a woman, I remember her, a kind\nof heavy set lady climbed out of the truck and started to run toward one of the buildings.\nSo we followed her, the Camp President and I. She went into the building. She went\ndown some steps, around corners, down some more steps, way down into the bowels of\nthe earth, and came to a...what looked like a piece of metal covering the wall, only it\nwasn't. It was a door. And when we went through that door, we were in the\nTheresienstadt synagogue. And...uh...1t had not been completely cleaned out. There were\nsome things there, and we took them. One of the things was a Megillah, of Esther. And\nthey wanted to give it to me, and I said, \"No, that I thought it belonged to Leo Beck.\"\nWhether or not it was his, it should be his. They all agreed that was so. He was a hero in\nthe camp, by the way, because he had organized all those classes. He had insisted after\npulling his garbage truck all day that you could not let your mind go to waste, and he had\norganized what amounted to a university. Anybody who could teach anything taught it.\nAnd he taught it. And that was...uh...accepted by these people as terribly important. And\nso he was...there have...there has been some statements about Beck's status in the camp as\nbeing something less than heroic, but not in my conversations with people in that camp.\nThey really respected this old man. So I said I would take it to him, that one way or\nanother eventually I would be going to London or I'd send it or whatever. So when I went\nto the Zionist Congress in July, I took the Megillah with me, wrapped in a piece of\nplastic, and I called, spoke to his daughter and made an appointment to see him on a\nparticular day I don't remember. When I arrived, I was taken through the house to the\nback garden. It was a little back British gardens which are so nice. And...uh...Leo Beck\nwas a bit of a ham, and my later experiences with him confirmed the fact that he was a bit\nof a ham. He was sitting...uh... reading something in profile. He had a marvelous profile,\nand the sun was shining directly on to him. (Laughter) And we talked for awhile. I had to\ngive him condolences. His niece...uh...had been killed in a truck accident on the way out\nof Theresienstadt, the only on toward thing that we had in our Theresienstadt transports.\nA truck slid into the ditch and she was killed. His great niece was okay though. Her\ndaughter! And we talked about that for awhile, and this young lady's future and I gave\nhim the Megillahe. And he looked at it, and he looked at it, and he said, \"I don't want\nthis.\" I said, \"Why not? The people wanted you to have it.\" He said, \"No. If I have it, it's\na museum piece. The Megillah should not be a museum piece. It should be a living\ndocument. It should be read. It should be read by Jews. This one being the Theresienstadt\nMagila should be read under circumstances which connect the story of the Megillah with\nTheresienstadt. You take it. Only you promise me that that's how it will be used.\" And I\ntook it. I had a box made for it by a Holocaust survivor when I came back. Actually, I\ndidn't have it made until I got to Washington. And a woman named Friedal Blumenthal, a\nsuperb silversmith, made this box. The box 1s teac and she has ornamented it with\nappropriate symbols and the fact that it's a Megillah of Theresien. It is now going into its\nsecond generation. When I retired, I gave it to my son who happens to be a Rabbi, and he\nuses it in his congregation and he has made a...an arrangement with the Holocaust\nMuseum that it will be on display here for part of each year. That's my first meeting with\nLeo Beck. Later, he taught me. He came to Cincinnati in 1948, and from 1948 until his\ndeath in 55, I think it was, he taught one semester each year at the college institute in\nCincinnati and the rest of the year was in London where he lead the World Union For\nProgressive Judaism. First rate lecturer and a bit of a ham. Uh...Now where do we go\nfrom here?",
        "A: Okay, then I'll have to talk about the girls too.",
        "A: The people I worked with were primarily my American truck drivers. Andy Dunn and\nFaye Green at Camp Karlof...uh...1 don't remember the names of anybody from the\nRothchild Hospital, but there was an office there in which these documents...uh...which\nwe did about 4 or 5 hundred eventually, these one-page things with the red stamp, that\n...uh...got these people. They never had trouble getting from Prague to Plzen traveling.\nEven after the...uh...cold war was declared, and I had to go back roads my last couple of\ntrips to Theresienstadt, by the way. I could not just go across. I had to go through a back\nroad that I found to get to Theresin and then I could get to Prague and then I had to go\nback to my road to get back into the American zone because the Russians would no\nlonger let us travel. My 3\u201clanguage pass was no longer acceptable. Even after that, United\nNations displaced persons traveling from Prague to Plzen for the purpose of looking for\nrelatives had no trouble getting through the border crossing at Brockisoni. So I don't\nremember names very well. I remember nobody from the Jewish Brigade group. Sylvia\nhad made contact with a man named, who had been a Captain in the Jewish Brigade, and\n, an attorney and I heard of him subsequent over the years. I never met him. So I had no\ndealings directly with him. I dealt with whoever happened to come across with the\nambulances or the trucks or the combination that was taking our people from the town in\nAustria across to Italy. It was pretty much a...uh...two-person operation, Sylvia and me.\nSylvia worked day and night. She was absolutely incredible in that Red Cross thing of\nhers. Her four people, the other women knew exactly what was going on, and they helped\nas much as they could. They wanted to. They were nice, healthy American kids\nwho...uh...got a little bit bored listening to G.I. stories from 9 o'clock to 9 o'clock and\nhanding out donuts and coffee, which is all Red Cross...un...canteens served. They got\ntired making those donuts too. So...uh...I didn't have a great many...uh....Berichah\ncontacts then. Later it...uh...1t changed drastically. But, the Czechoslovakia thing was\npretty much as I have described it. Uh...One ...uh...group of people I really have to\nmention because they become so important to me. Shortly after we got to\nCzechoslovakia, I kept hearing about places where there were Jews and that's why the\nChaplain had such trouble with my trip tickets because I went to all these places. And\nincidentally managed to show up at all the American Headquarters I was supposed to go\nto. There was a town in, a town in the southern part of ... And I heard that there some\nJewish girls there. Women! And I went down there, and sure enough, there were. Nearly\n400 of them in a hospital. They had been in a labor camp in Germany and the Germans\nwho were really suicidal about Jews had put these women...more than 400, nearly a\nthousand.... on to a train and sent the train east. Toward the end of the war, they did that\nwith a lot of Jews. Their minds, I think, going like...we don't want the Americans to find\nthem. It will be better for us if the Americans don't find them. These women got as far as\nSuchita when they couldn't get any more fuel for the train. So the engineer abandoned the\ntrain, and there they were. Somebody opened it up because they heard screams\npresumably, and they buried the dead and put the rest of them into this hospital. I went\nthere and met these women. They wanted a service, so we had services, after which one\nyoung woman came up to me, introduced herself in quite good English, told me that she\nand her three sisters and three of their friends, all from Krakow, had been together\nthrough the war. Turns out that she mama'd this group and saved them through the war.\nAnd...uh...they wanted to get out of the hospital. Was there any place they could live?\nBecause she had been offered a job with UNRRA, and one of the others was going to\nthis, one of the others was going to do that. They all had plans for living in Suchison, so\nwe got them a house. And...uh...they became my kids. Uh...The word kid is funny\nbecause Erna is really only about 5 years younger than I am, and the man she married\nwas older than I. But...uh... They're my kinds. A little later...uh...the job situation was such\nthat they would do better in the Bavarian town of Tishinroit, so they were moved to a\nhouse in Tishinroit, where they lived until they came to...well, 1946, Bronya, now Betty,\nmarried Henry and they moved to Australia where his only living relative was, and they\nare still there and we still correspond. I have not seen them since 1946. Uh...Dora, who\nwas the housekeeper....she was the domesticated one of this crowd...married Borrof, and\nthey disappeared in the wilds of Brooklyn, where he is a Hasid and does not permit his\nwife to have much to do with the rest of us. But Dora manages to call Erna periodically to\nmake sure everybody is alright and to send her love. The other five have been together\nconstantly ever since. They all came to the United States. They all married. Two of\nthem...three of them married in Europe. I officiated at all three marriages.\nAnd...uh...some of the kids were born in Tirsenroit, including a pair of twins, who are\nnow both M.D., Ph.Ds doing extraordinary work. Uh...They've remained my family to\nthis day. Uh...Interestingly enough, the one who was not their sister...uh...married their\nuncle. They had a very uncle, and Maguska married him. So we've been through a lot of\nthings. Births, Bar Mitzvah and a couple of deaths. Remarkably few deaths, I am glad to\nsay. And we are still in routine communication. Uh...Erna's marriage was rather\nmiraculous because in the concentration camp, she had met a woman who had said to her\nthat she was absolutely perfect as a mate for her son. And after the war she married that\nson, a physician who had a successful practice in Syracuse. The coincidences are such.\nAnyhow, that's my ...",
        "A: Not everything that happened in Czechoslovakia (clearing throat) or anywhere else was\nupbeat. There were problems. There were tragedies and there were horrors. Uh...I'll tell\nyou a horror story just because it happened. The Karlov camp was our salvation, but there\nwere problems there too. One middle of the night, I got a frantic call from Andy Dunn to\ncome out immediately, so I went over to the camp. It seems...uh...a Kapo had turned up in\nthe camp. A Kapo was a Jew who worked for the Germans or Poles in the concentration\ncamp, and if the Jews hated anybody more than they hated Germans and Poles and other\npeople, they hated Kapos. Somebody recognized this Kapo in Karlov that night, and they\nhad killed him and they just tossed his body over the fence outside the camp, and the\nbody had been found. And poor Andy didn't know what to do with a dead Kapo, and that\nwas understandable. And...uh...It seemed to me that to inform the Czech authorities was a\nbad idea. So we just buried the guy. And...uh...he, like many other Jews, lies in an\nunmarked grave. My own feelings that night made that one of the low points of the entire\n3 year experience in Germany. Uh...It's not my only Kapo experience. We had another\none, but...that Jews could kill somebody, another Jew. No matter how terrible the other\nJew was, with no due process of any kind, outraged me and upset me and scared me.\nBut...uh..1t was another lesson to be learned. Let's go from that to a birth. A woman came\nto Sylvia, Hungarian Jewish girl who was very pregnant and who didn't want the baby.\nThe father of the baby was a concentration camp guard. Following liberation she had met\na man, a Hungarian, who wanted to marry her, only he wouldn't marry her with the baby.\nIt didn't bother him that she was pregnant. After all, she had nothing to do with that\nreally, but...uh... he wasn't going to raise that child and neither was she. What should we\ndo with this baby about to be born? Sylvia said, \"Give it to me. I will somehow get it to\nthe United States. I have a sister who does not have children. That will be her child.\" And\non June 1...July 1...July 1, 1945, this baby was born. A little girl. And the doctor who\ndelivered her, I remember his name. Interestingly enough his son, who was very young at\nthe time, became my friend because of this incident and the son died in California just\nabout 2 weeks ago to my sorrow. Uh...Here was this baby. The mother agreed that she\nwould keep the child until she was ready to leave for Hungary. Five days later she came\ninto the club after 10 o'clock one night and said, \"I can't do this. I have no interest in this\nbaby. Why should I waste time looking after this kid? Here.\" And handed a baby to\nSylvia. Sylvia and four Red Cross girls found themselves the mother of a 5 day old baby,\nand I became it's sort of surrogate father. The child lived in the Red Cross Club. The five\nwomen took care of her. The...uh...story of how we found... Well, bottles were easy.\nCoke bottles worked fine. You sterilize a coke bottle, and we had lots of coke bottles\naround. Nipples were harder to find. It took almost a whole day of tearing around\nCzechoslovakia until we found one nipple for this kid that would fit a coke bottle. That's\npart of the problem. (Laughter) It was big enough for a calf as a matter of fact, but the\nbaby thrived on it which is what mattered. We had no trouble with the other necessities\nfor a young baby. And then in very dramatic fashion...uh...Sylvia had to come home on\nemergency in the summer of 1945. Her father was desperately sick and did, in fact, die.\nSo she got emergency leave to go home and she packed up the baby in a bed roll and took\nher along with her. When she got to Scotland to get on the Transatlantic plane they\nwanted...uh...baby's not on the manifest. And Sylvia said, \"Who puts 2 month old babies\non a manifest?\" \"Where did you get the child.\" \"It's my child. I had a baby.\" And she\nbluffed her way through immigration into the United States. And her sister got the child\nand the child is, I understand, very healthy and alive. We changed her birthdate. On the\nbirth certificate, which...uh...happened under extreme circumstances also, it must have\nbeen...oh...a year later, I guess. No....a year and a half later, I got a frantic letter from the\nchild's mother saying, \"We're trying to complete the adoption and the court will not put\nthrough the adoption without a birth certificate. Get me a birth certificate.\" The\ncommunist had taken over in Czechoslovakia and I wasn't about to go to Plzen trying to\nget a birth certification. So I went to my Commanding Officer and I said to him,\n\"Colonel, is it true that all camp commanders and post commanders are notaries.\" \"Yes.\"\n\"Would you notarize a document for me?\" \"Yes.\" So in my name, I wrote a statement\nabout the circumstances of this child's birth, never alluding to the child's name or mother\nbecause I wasn't going to lie...uh...not in a sworn affidavit. I'm a funny American...uh...in\nview of the stories I am telling you, it sounds strange that I would lie in an affidavit, but I\ndidn't want to. So I wrote it very carefully. Told the circumstances of the child's birth and\nthe movement to the United States, and...uh...civil affairs were not exactly in order Plzen\nin July of 1945 and there was no birth certificate, and would the court please accept this\nsworn affidavit in lieu of a birth certificate, and they did. And so the adoption was\ncompleted. Uh...That's one of my nice stories. I hope you can get to Sylvia to get the rest\nof it because she tells it beautifully and I don't want to tell more because the young lady\nis around. The young lady and I have no contact whatsoever. I have not tried to keep\nthese kinds of contacts. Okay. Let's now go to the USO. We'll finish up Czechoslovakia.\nUSO tours were very important, especially during the occupation period. American\nsoldiers were bored, and these entertainers came and...uh...you know, you've seen\ntelevision pictures of Bob Hope and the crowd he gets. Well, every group that came over,\nno matter how mediocre got this kind of reception. I was called in by our special services\nofficer in Plzen and asked if I could do them a favor. I said, \"What do you want?\" He\nsaid, \"Well, we have a strange USO group coming over. They have let it be known that\nthey will not under any circumstances do the job they're being sent here to do, namely to\nentertain American troops, unless they can also go to Jewish displaced persons groups.\nAnd they're important people. So I want to indulge them. Can you help me.\" I said, \"Yal.\nI can help you. I can make arrangement for concerts and appearances in Jewish DP\ncamps.\" \"Alright, they are arriving day after tomorrow. WIII you meet them at the hotel?\"\n\"Yes.\" And I walked into a room which contained, and now I am name dropping, the\nonly time I shall do this I hope, Ingrid Bergman, Jack Benny, Larry Addler, the world's\ngreatest harmonica player and Martha Tilton of whom I had never heard till then, but who\nturns out to be a very good pop singer. And...uh...they said to me that they wanted to do\nthis. I said, \"What do you want to do for these Jews?\" \"Leave that up to us.\" And I took\nthem in a command car for one solid week during the day. After all American troops\ncould not be entertained...until 11:00 in the morning or 2:00 in the afternoon, they were\nsupposed to be working. But Jews were sitting around. They spent their days entertaining\nJews, and their evenings entertaining American troops. And they were magnificent. They\nwere absolutely superb. Jack Benny's Yiddish was quite good. Larry Addler's Yiddish\nwas quite good. Uh...Ingrid Bergman talked to them 1n a broken kind of German which\nshe broke deliberately so they wouldn't think it was Yiddish, and (laughter) they knew it\nwasn't and...uh...I[ had a wonderful time for a week. I really did. I was...uh...the only\nspectator at about | o'clock one morning to a recital in which Jack Benny played the\npiano and Larry Addler played the violin. I wish I had a tape of that one. I wish the world\nhad a tape of it. It was a really spectacular experience, and I developed enormous regard\nfor those four people because they really knocked themselves out for these Jews.",
        "A: I was exiled to Germany.",
        "A: Yes. I was...uh...assigned to the 4th Armored Division, one of its combat commands. In\nthose days a armored division consisted of three combat commands. I was assigned to\none of them in a little town not far from Regensburg. And...uh...1t didn't take long to find\nJews. There were 2,000 of them in Regensburg, not under UNRRA auspices, which\nmeans they needed everything in the world and we had to work there. One of the things\nwe got them was a building, a Jewish Center. It had an auditorium. It had offices cause\nthey organized. Two thousand Jews are either organized or you have chaos. One or the\nother! By this time, incidentally, it's the very end of August 1945. And I was very\nworried. We had inadequate food for these people and no money to get food. I had\nwritten to the JVC in Paris, trying to get money and we could buy food, and...uh...was\ntold no, this was not the way they wanted to do business, that they would be coming in\nwith their people and they would take care of everything. Meanwhile, we had hungry\nJews. Uh...I guess the first thing to tell you 1s the meeting of Chaplains, which happened\nshortly after I got to Regensburg or... I am going to call it Regensburg. It was really a\nlittle town called Zoul, but it doesn't matter. Uh...Got instructions to be Munich at a\ncertain time to meet with the Chair of the Commission of Army and Navy Chaplaincy of\nthe Jewish Welfare Board of the late Rabbi Joseph Lipstein, an orthodox rabbi, and with\nRabbi who was a director of that commission, who was a reform rabbi. And we all\ngathered in this hotel room in Munich. My guess is there were probably 30 or 40 of us.\nUh...There were about 90 Jewish Chaplains in the American Zones, but they weren't...he\ndidn't meet them all at once. He had met some in Frankfurt and he met them...I don't\nknow where else. But he met us in Munich, and that was the first time I had seen\nKlausner...uh...since Dachau because I had just gotten back to Germany, and had not had\na chance to go down in Munich to see him. And...uh...I'll never forget Lipstein. He\ngreeted us and he said, \"Now Gentlemen, my report to the Jewish Welfare Board on\nChaplain activities, I wrote on the plane coming over. It was easy. Now I want to know,\nand if you trust me, don't hold back. Tell me what's going on.\" And we looked at one\nanother, and we decided we'd tell him. So we told him. We had lots of problems, and\nnothing to deal with them with. Uh...Abe was the most outspoken and said the most\nbecause he had the most experience by then. I should tell you that by then, you see, he\nhad organized the Central Committee of Displaced Persons in the U.S. zone of which he\nwas the president. And he had departments set up. They were doing health work. They\nwere getting food and clothing where they could scrounge it, and I guess most of\nimportant of all, they were doing a relative search. Uh...Abe published five volumes of\nnames of survivors which sat in Munich in the old Dorchus museum which was his office\nthen and on the walls of this building...I wish we had pictures of it...I think he does...are\nthe names of thousands of Jews and where to find them so they could find relatives. And\nrelatives were found this way. It was a very inefficient way, but it was the only way we\nhad so we used it. And...uh.. during that meeting with Lipstein not participating, the\nchaplains decided that our people had a right to clothing, and they weren't getting it and\nthere was no indication that when JDC or anybody else would come in to give people\nclothing who weren't in DP camps. And even in some DP camps they didn't have\nclothing. They particularly didn't have clothing for children. Our people were beginning\nto have kids if you can count. And...uh...we decided we would use a technique which was\nlegal which the Army permitted. You in the United States could send to any soldier\nanywhere in the world a 11-pound package of food and or clothing...uh...to his A.P.O.\nnumber, and you could send as many as you wanted. So each of us wrote letters, and we\nsent them to everybody we knew. I sent them to every Rabbi I knew. I sent them to my\nfamily. I have a large family, and all my friends and everybody else I could think of.\nSend packages. And God helps us, they began to come in. Tons. By the end of October\n1945, I had 80 people working full time in a warehouse in Regensburg on just the stuff\naddressed to me, sorting this clothing, throwing away some of it I am sorry to say or\nusing it for smotas and fixing that which was repairable and getting it cleaned and once a\nweek I visited all of the 31 camps and communities in my part of north Bavaria\ndelivering sacks of this stuff. I began to worry about my post office. So I went to my\npostal officer and I said, \"People in the United States are sending me a lot of stuff as you\nknow.\" He said, \"Yes, Chaplain, I am aware of it.\" I said, \"How about it if I make it easy\non you and I send a truck down here everyday to pick up the stuff so you don't have to\ndeliver it.\" \"Oh, that will be wonderful. Thank you.\" He didn't ask a question. I didn't\ngive him any information. (laughing) I just sent the truck, and we got our stuff.\nAbsolutely incredible quantities. Tons and tons of clothing. Now people began to ask\nquestions. We give contributions to the Joint Distribution Committee which is supposed\nto be doing relief work all over the world. How come we get asked by the Rabbis for\nthese packages? And that must have been....must have been embarrassing to JDC but by\nthat time, I am afraid we weren't very sympathetic. Uh...When they came in, they came\ninto my territory...uh...no...they came into Munch in August...three social workers. Not\ncarrying a stitch of anything with them, and no budget for anything. Klausner got them\nhim a house. As he had a house in Munich and he brought them into his house, and that\nbecame their headquarters cause they had no place to work. They were credited to\nUNRRA, but UNRRA didn't supply them with anything. It wasn't UNRRA's job. It was\ntheir job to be supplying. These people were absolutely unprepared for what they were\ngoing to do. They didn't know anything about relative search. They didn't know anything\nabout getting people out, if you could get people out. They had not been trained. Of\ncourse, neither had we. One of the astounding facts of my life is that those of us who\nwent to Europe got absolutely no orientation from anybody about what we were going to\nfind when we got there. None. Not from the JWB, which...whose job it wasn't, but not\nfrom the other agencies either who really might have gotten a hold of us before we left\nand said, \"Hey, you're going to run into A, B, C. and D, and contact so and so and so and\nso, and at least know the address of the JDC office in Paris which none of us had.\nSo...uh...those relationships...uh... were either strained or good, depending on the\npersonnel. Two of the three people who came to Munich were magnificent as people.\nCeil Wineburg, I shall always...married a man...uh...died in Detroit, was superb. And she\nwouldn't leave Europe. She got so attached to those people and their needs that she must\nhave stayed 5 years. Uh...The other one, a girl named Debbie, I am sorry to say died in\nEurope...uh...a defective heating stove...uh...in her room. This happened in 1946. So.",
        "A: Another thing we had to do...",
        "A: (Sigh) Well, I was lucky. In late October, early November, there came to Regensburg, a\nfull time JDC person named Joe Levine, who now lives in Fort Wayne, Indiana, deeply\ndevoted, cared about these people and did everything in the world that could be done. He\neven learned how to scrounge, and he learned how to steal, and he learned how to send\nfor this and that not through JDC channels, and eventually JDC managed to get stuff in. I\nmean it didn't stay this way forever. But those...that first year was pretty horrendous and\nJoe was as frustrated as I was. Fortunately, we became very close friends and we were on\nthe same wave length from beginning to end. We are still good friends, by the way. High\nHolidays, 1945, I must tell you. Had to do something. Not only for soldiers, but for\ndisplaced persons as well. And I decided that they were decided...that they were entitled\nto have a break fast at the end of Yom Kippur which would be traditional. What do you\nneed for a break fast? Herring. You gotta have herring. Without herring you can't do it.\nHow do you get herring? There's no herring in Regensburg. Legal, illegal, no herring. So\nI cabled military to a Chaplain friend in England and said, I need a big barrel of salt\nherring, enough for 2,000 people for break fast. One day in August...late August, 1945,\nbeginning September, I don't remember the dates at this point, I got a phone call. Munich\nairstrip. \"Are you Chaplain Lipman?\" \"At the end of our runway is the biggest God Dam\nbarrel (you'll have to censor that) I have seen and it stinks.\" \"I'll be right down.\"\n(Laughter) I put my trailer on my jeep, and I went to the air strip and we unloaded what\nwas an enormous barrel. You think of a barrel as this big. It was three times that big. Was\nalmost as tall as I. We couldn't lift it. It had to be rolled. And I took it up to Ragensberg,\nand said, \"Now what do I do with it? How do I make this into pickled herring, because it\nwas old salt herring, in brine, untouched. It had its heads. It had had its scales. It had\neverything. Then I got an idea. My commanding officer was a Colonel Koen. We were\nnot friends, I am sorry to say. He should rest in peace. Harold Kone was not very Jewish.\nHe was part of the famous teams of Abrahams in Kone. The 4th Armored Division had\nbeen hell on wheels for the Germans. They had hated the 4th Armored, and they\nparticularly Abrahams and Koen. They thought they were both Jews. Abrahams was the\nlate General Kritein, Abrahams of Viet Nam fame who was then a Colonel, and was\nHarold Koen's commander. He commanded the combat command. Harold...No, he\ncommanded the regiment. Harold had the combat command. Harold Koen taught Kreitein\nAbrahams some Yiddish and to the extent they could on their walky talkies, they talked\nYiddish. And the Germans called them terrible names, these two Jews. But that was as\nJewish as Harold Koen got. He was not interested in me. He was not interested in what I\nwas doing, and so we kept away from each other. I went in to him and I said, \"Harold, I\nneed something, and maybe this will appeal to you. I need some PWs, a bunch of them\nfor a whole day.\" \"What for?\" I said, \"To clean herring.\" And he said, \"What?\" I said,\n\"Yal, I got a barrel of herring here, a big barrel for both our troops and for the Jews in\nRegensburg for Yom Kippur.\" And he said, \"Oh, how beautiful.\" We had a PW cage for\nhigh ranking officers. He gave me 10 Colonels, 10 Nazi Colonels, who arrived in step in\nuniform, and I said to them, \"Gentlemen, I suggest to you that you take off as much of\nyour uniforms as you can because the task you have is not going to be exactly...\" \"We are\nforbidden to do menial labor. We are officers.\" I said, \"I am aware of that, and we will\nkeep the Geneva Convention. We will not smash it. We may bend it a bit before the day\nis over.\" I sat them down on relatively low stools with big buckets in front of them, put\nthe barrel of herring in front of them, and said, \"Gentlemen, you are to cut off the heads.\nYou are scale it. You are to gut it. And then put it into these buckets of water.\" They\nrefused. And I said, \"Here's the written order from Colonel Koen. I am not sure what you\ncan do about it. You are, after all, prisoners of war.\" They sat down and they spent 10\nhours...it was a pretty hot day...cleaning herring. I loved every minute of it. I was a\nsadistic so and so. Koen must have come out 10 times to watch it. He had a marvelous\ntime that day. And then when they went back...uh...the herring having been cleaned, they\ndemanded baths. And the camp commander said, \"But it's not your bath day. You'll get\nyour bath day on your bath day.\" And so these guys walked around reeking of herring for\nI don't know how many days until their bath day came, and I must tell you I had no\ncompassion. I confess that I am not that human, or humane. So we made enormous\nquantities of pickled herring. I found some other things that the commissary or the... our\nsupply group was willing to let me steal and then I got 4,000 donuts from our Red Cross\npeople. Had lots and lots and lots of coffee and all the rest of it. And then I got a break.\nThe 4th Armored Division was a New York Division and organized at Camp Pine. And\nof its 10,000 people when it was full strength, almost 15 hundred were Jews. It had the\nhighest casualty rates in Jews of any unit in the United States Army I suspect because 4th\nArmored had been through very heavy combat. Between Rosh Hashanah and Yom\nKippur, the high point men got their orders to go home. I had over a thousand men at\nRosh Hashanah services. I had 80 at Yom Kippur services. They had left me. (Laughter)\nThey had gone home. I was delighted for them. I was delighted for another reason too. I\nhad that much more food for my DPs. We finished early. I deliberately started services\nearly and finished early, so we could all get into Regensburg. And all these guys that\nwanted to go...some of them drove trucks for me...had this food all loaded and we went\ninto Regensburg and we parked our trucks in front of the Jewish Center where the Jews\nwere dining. And...uh...somebody looked in one of the trucks. They didn't know I was\ncoming. I had not told them we were bringing a meal. And I am not sure they ever\nfinished the meal that day. They unloaded those trucks faster than I have ever seen trucks\nunloaded, and that food disappeared. I stood in there. I had such a wonderful time\nwatching these people break fast as you're supposed to break fast. It was a quite\nmemorable experience. Lots of other adventures in Regensburg.,...uh...including my\nsecond kapo. I came into the center one day, and they were screaming and yelling at this\npoor, bedraggled looking Jew who was a kapo, and I said, \"You are not going to do\nanything in this center.\" And we asked questions. The guy admitted that he had been a\nkapo, so we had no trouble with that. And I said to the Jews, \"Was being a kapo a war\ncrime?\" \"Yes.\" \"What do we do with war criminals? We try them. I am taking this Jew to\nmilitary government, and I am having him arrested as a war criminal and the Allied\nArmies will try this war criminal as we are trying war criminals and you won't touch\nhim.\" And they screamed and they yelled I was a traitor. They were going to kill this guy.\nThe least they could do was get there vengeance, etc., etc., etc. And I said to my assistant,\na wonderful Jew named Si Pova, who lives in Hartford, Connecticut. He's a social\nworker. He raised an orthodox family. He was 19 years old. They called him , Simon, the\nrighteous one. And he was. Si must have worked 20 hours a day, 6 days a week for these\npeople. He was absolutely magnificent. I said to Si, \"Si, you have to do something. Don't\nsay anything. Just go, unhook your carbine out of the rack in the jeep and bring it up\nhere.\" And he did. And I said to the Jews, \"Si, here has a gun. Wouldn't it be terrible if\nhe had to use it. But we want to use it rather than let you kill this Jew.\" And we marched\nthe Jew out and turned him over the military government, and I can't tell you what\nbecame of him. That was my war criminal. It took awhile for the people in Regensburg to\nforgive me. They were very angry, and I understand their anger. But that's what...our\nHasidic style. We changed hats and we danced and we went absolutely bananas and 5\no'clock in the afternoon when I went back to my hotel....I managed to stagger\nin...uh...they had finished yet because they had danced so long. And...uh...I had an\nincident with my anti*Hasidic grandfather as a result of that day. I made a mistake.\nBefore I sobered up, I wrote him a letter, telling him of the wonderful time I had had with\nthose people and that I wanted to see more of them. He wrote me back. We corresponded\nalways in Hebrew. From the time that I was 7 years old, I got only Hebrew letters from\nmy grandfather, who figured I was smart enough to get somebody to translate them for\nme for the parts I couldn't translate myself. And he had beautiful handwriting. So I got\nthis letter by return mail which sort of crinkled the edges of the paper in which he said, \"I\nhave your letter. I want to remind you of something. When you wrote me to Jerusalem\nthat you had decided to become a reform Rabbi I didn't argue with you. I thought about it.\nAfter all, your father was a businessman and an atheist. At least, you weren't going in\neither of those directions. To become a Rabbi, even a reform Rabbi you would have to\nstudy. You would know something, which is more than most Jews did, so remember I\ndidn't fight with you. But, if you become a Hasid, don't come home. And he signed the\nthing. (Laughter) One of my favorite all-time letters from the old man. Okay. We now\nmove into...uh... November. We got theater orders that any Chaplain who could was to\nreport to Paris in time for a theater wide memorial service on November 11, the speaker\nat which would be David Ben-Gurion, and it would be held in the Synagogue in Paris.\nAnd I didn't want to go. Joe and I had a lot of things going, 31 camps and\ncommunities...uh...the package system is working. I'll have to tell you about the mail\nsystem which was also working. I didn't really want to go. And my Senior Chaplain said,\n\"Gene, go.\" I said, \"Why?\" He said, \"You're too tired. You don't look good. Just don't\nlike the way you look.\" And Si Pava said, \"You're pain a neck these days. You're\nirritable. You're terrible. Go to Paris.\" said, '\"Pava, you just want to go to Paris.\" He says,\n\"I want to be at that service. I ought to be there.\" And I said, \"Pava, you've earned the\nright. Let's go.\" So we went. Snowed the whole bloody way across Europe. We had to go\nby jeep. There was no other way to go and...uh...1t was not exactly a happy, happy ride,\nbut we made it. And one of the most frigid experiences of my entire life was that service\nat the Synagogue. Not the atmosphere, but it was cold. There was no heat in this\nsynagogue. We were all sitting there in our gray coats, and Ben Gurion hung a on us. He\nmade a long, long speech. I had been instructed by my Berichah people to see Ruth\nKluger in Paris, at the Haganah office. Haganah had an office in Paris. European\nheadquarters. So I wondered in there, and we were talking, Ruth and I, about what was\ngoing on in Germany and Czechoslovakia and what we needed and how we could do a\nbetter job of moving Jews when her phone rang. And from the conversation at my...at our\nend, it was clear that she was talking to Judge Simon Riskin who had arrived...I don't\nremember how many weeks earlier...as the advisor to General Eisenhower on Jewish\nAffairs, with a rank of Lieutenant General. And they were talking about a deal which Ben\nGuron had made with Eisenhower just before Ben Guron came to Paris for the service.\nThe deal in which teachers would be sent from Palestine to the DP camps to teach\nHebrew, to teach agronomy. All of those teachers would be Haganah people, and the\nArmy would try to turn its back to the maximum possible extent to let them operate.\nEisenhower asked one thing. You will not bribe any American soldier. You will not\ncorrupt my men. I'll help you get around them, but you're not going through them. And\nBen-Gurion thought that made good sense. So they wanted to get going. The Army had\nan airplane ready to go to...uh...what is now Ben Guron airport, then called Luds to pick\nup the first group to bring them. And it suddenly occurred to Judge Riskin that an\nAmerican crew flying into Lud wouldn't know what to do with itself when it got there.\nThat some liaison person was necessary, and Ruth agreed that a liaison person was\nnecessary. And she looked at me and suddenly she said to Judge Riskin, \"I think I have\nthe person sitting right here. Shall I put him on the phone.\" And I introduced myself and\nJudge Riskine said, \"If Ruth thinks you're the person to do this, then it's alright with me.\nCan you be here tomorrow morning?\" I said, \"If I drive all night, I can.\" He said, \"So\ndrive all night.\" Lieutenant Generals are like this, and Simon Riskin is like this too. He's a\nvery blunt...uh...guy who had given up a place on a Federal District bench, a life\nappointment, to take on this temporary thing, to work for Eisenhower and do Jewish\nthings. He was wonderful. So I found Si with no trouble. We had a terrible time finding\nour other driver who was carousing Paris, but we caught up with him and we loaded him\nin the back of the jeep because he couldn't drive and the two of us drove all night. We\nreported to Judge Riskin in Frankfort the next morning. Uh...the morning following that, I\nwas on a B-17, with a crew of five Americans heading for... Uh...Bewildered. Excited. I\nhad my orders from General Walter Bedel Smith, and they were for 7 days. Okay? So I\ngot into Delist. Got to Jerusalem, and discovered nothing was ready. Uh...Our Israel\nfriends will all forgive me, but the Middle East is not exactly the most efficient place in\nthe world to do business. Not then and not now. Uh...I went to meetings and tried to get\nthings going. There was no way to get those people out in 7 days. But I got a lot of\nquestions that had to be answered in Germany. So we flew back to Germany, went into\nconference with the various people at headquarters that were going to deal with this thing\nand...uh...got answers and flew back again. I made two trips in about 2 weeks I guess it\nwas. My second trip was not long before Hanukkah. And...uh...while we were getting my\n14 people organized, a couple of incidents are worth mentioning. First, my 7 day orders,\nthe 7th day was a Shabbat. It was alright with me. I was under military orders and you do\nthings under military orders. But 4 of my 14 teachers so-called were orthodox Jews. They\nrefused to fly on Shabbat. And I said, \"What will give you permission to fly on Shabbat?\"\nAnd they said, \"Written authorization from the Chief Rabbi.\" I said, \"Okay.\" So I called\nthe Chief Rabbi's office and I talked with a gentleman who is now the President of Israel,\nthe Chief Rabbi's son, who was then his secretary. I told him what I wanted and he\nlaughed and he said, \"All of us are gonna have fun with that one.\" And...uh...he invited\nme for Shebot dinner and I didn't accept because I was having Shabbat dinner with the\nmen who was really the political head of the Haganah, the first foreign minister of Israel,\nwho I am delighted to say became Esther's and my very good friend. Uh...We loved him\ndearly. And I remember President Hertzog saying, isn't going to like that. You don't turn\ndown an invitation to the Rabbi's dish.\" And I said, \"One is also not rude. One has to\nhave . And I had accepted another invitation. Now would the Chief Rabbi call Sharet and\ngive him reasons for me not to go to Sharet's for Shabbat dinner?\" He said, \"No, the\nChief Rabbi will not do that.\" I said, \"Fine. You'll give my apologies to the Rabbi. I have\nno choice whatsoever.\" But I went there late Friday afternoon, and the Rabbi's little\nsynagogue and had an interview with him before . His first question to me...he spoke\nHebrew and English and Yiddish with an Irish accent. He had been Chief Rabbi in\nDublin before he went to Palestine. Charming, wonderful little man. His first question to\nme was, \"Is it true that you are Morris Neman's nephew?\" And I said, \"How did you ever\nhear of Morris Neman?\" And he said, \"We know things out here.\" I said, \"Yes. I am his\nnephew.\" And he said, \"You can't be all bad, even if you're a reform Rabbi.\" I said,\n\"Thank you for nothing.\" (Laughter) He gave me the piece of paper authorizing these\nguys to go on the grounds it was . Human life was involved, and they had to fly out on\nShabbat or not fly out. I would have to go without because I wasn't going to get court\nmartialed for this bunch or anybody else. So we left on Shabbat. Chief Rabbi was\nwonderful. I was carrying with me not only 14 somewhat scared Jews, but the most\npeculiar package I have ever carried in my life. I had been called and asked to come and\nsee aman named Caplan, who was the treasurer of the Jewish Agency, First Minister of\nFinance, with the Government of Israel in 1948. I walked into his office. This was before\nmy meeting with the Chief Rabbi. And he said, \"Are you really Morris Neman's\nnephew?\" I said, \"Yes,\" and he offered me condolences because as it happens Morris had\ndied in September of 45. One of the first things I did in Jerusalem was go to the walls and\nsay kottish for him. He was a great Zionist in Pittsburgh. A magnificent, magnificent\nman. My favorite uncle. So he said, \"Okay, then I'll trust you.\" He said, \"I want you to do\nsomething for me. I want you to take a package to Paris. I said, \"But I am not going to\nParis.\" He said, \"If you take this package you are.\" I said, \"What will be in the package?\"\nAnd he said, \"A quarter of a million dollars.\" I said, \"That's too big a package.\" (laughter)\nfor my purposes. He says, \"No, it will fit in your shaving kit.\" I said, \"How?\" He said,\n\"Because it's going to be in gold sovereigns. It's the budget for the Paris office for the\nnext period of time.\" And I said, \"Alright. So I'll get court martialed. What can I do?\"\nAnd he took me through a door and through another door into a room that consisted of\nshelves, each one of which was marked with a country. All currency. This was the Jewish\nAgency's private treasury of foreign currency. I don't know how much money was there.\nNo idea. All I know is that he was correct. I got a quarter of million dollars in gold\nsovereigns into my docket. Then I wondered, \"How'll I pull this off? I am going to have\nto trust one of my pilots. And I got hold of the Major and I said to him, \"Look. I am\ngoing to do something very dangerous. I am going to tell you something you don't want\nto know and I don't want to tell you, but I need you. I need you in two ways. I need you\nto protect me. I am going to be walking around for the rest of the time we are Palestine\nwith my dock kit in my hands, and I don't anybody to ask why. And I don't want anybody\nto take it because it is money in it. A lot of money.\" \"Okay, Chappy. It's alright with me.\"\nI said, \"Second of all, you are to arrange an emergency that makes us land in Paris for 1\nhour.\" \"That's not as easy,\" he said. I said, \"You'll do it though.\" I let them know\napproximately when we would be coming in, and we were met at the airport by a man\nwho became one of my most beloved friends, Efriam Decal who is second in command\nof the was the boss and Decal was his second. Decal has written extensively about the\nBerichah and about all sorts of things. He...uh...has died. His wife is still living I am glad\nto say. I just handed him this, and he, in effect, said thank you. (Laughter) That was our\nfirst meeting. We became friends later. And we flew back to Germany. And we got away\nwith it, which was alright. We had something else on board, about which I was very\nsentimental and still am. I was invited to a meeting of the Vodlume, which is the National\nassembly of the Ishuf, headed by...uh...Ben , who became the second President of Israel.\nAnd I met all the people who are legendary. You name them and they were all sitting\nthere, and I was introduced to all of them. And Ben said, \"I need a favor.\" \"What.\" The\nschool children of Israel had been making Hanukiyot for the children of the DP camps in\nGermany. We have 36,000 of them. And we have candles. We don't know how to get\nthem to Germany. Nobody ever thought of that. I understand, he said, that you are flying\nin a bomber. I said, \"Yes, and my bomber has bomb bays, and I think it would be very\nnice if we filled the bomb bays of a B-17 with Hanukiyot and candles.\" And we did. And\nI sent a military TWX to Si Pava to alert everybody he could alert to come to the airport\nat Piece boden and pick up their Hanukiyot and they did. All 36,000 of them got\ndistributed in about 24 hours to Jews all over Germany, all over the American zone of\nGermany. And...uh...that was some Hanukkah. By the way, I don't have one of them. We\ndistributed them all. (Laughing) I never got one. I would give much to have one of those\nHanukiyot but I don't have one, and I guess that's proper and just that I should not have. I\nnever went back to Regensburg to work. I spent the next period of time until April 46\nrunning around, doing I don't know what, but there were emergencies constantly. The\nAmerican headquarters in Frankfort would call...the G.5 sections civil affairs, or\nHiam...then called Hans Hoffman, later became Hiam Hoffman, later became , one of the\nfine people of Israel, and I had to do things. So I was on detached service at Frankfort\nHeadquarters for some months, but that had to end. You just can't keep doing that. So the\ntheater Chaplain, a man named Hunan, Catholic, Truman's Chaplain, he called himself,\nfrom the first World War, called me in and said, \"You gotta stop this monkeying around.\nThis isn't why you're in the Army. I am sending you to Berlin. That should be far enough\naway from all those displaced persons.\" And I said, \"Yes, Sir.\" Excited, because the Jews\nfrom Poland and Russia had just started to come in and we were routing them all through\nBerlin. We had one of the Haganah people stationed in Berlin, and that's where the action\nwas going to be. Break my heart. Send me to Berlin. Twenty four hours later, he called\nme in and he said, \"You're not going to Berlin. I just found out the stuff that's going on\nthere. You're going to Augsburg to the Ist Division.\" \"Yes, Sir.\" \"And,\" he said, \"when\nyou get there, find Chaplain Freedman, whom I assigned there, but who is now going to\nBerlin in your place.\" And I went to Augsburg and found Herb Freedman, whom I had\nnever met before. A young, first lieutenant, fresh into the Army, who was angry at me\nbecause Augsburg is near Munich, and in Munich is where the action was because he\nwanted to do Haganah work. He was busting to do this stuff. And I explained to him that\nBerlin was better and he should be made on me. (laughter) And he went to Berlin. Of\ncourse, Herb Freedman's career since then has been legendary. He and Phil Burstein did\nthings that people really shouldn't have been able to do. And...uh...1t was superb. I was\ndelighted to be in Augsburg. But my time was running out, because Hoffman was\nnegotiating with the Army to make me into a civilian because it was clear during this\nperiod from December when these 14 arrived that this , this Jewish agency for Palestine\ngroup, as it was called,...uh... was going to have constant dealings with the Army. And\nsome American had to be there to see to it that nothing got fouled up. And they decided I\nshould be that person, and I was not unwilling. My condition was that my wife and child\nbe allowed to come to Germany with me. I had two reasons for that. First of all, I been\naway 18 months and that's a lot longer than 2 years...those 2 years that I thought wouldn't\nbe so long, and second of all, I felt that Esther had to experience this or we weren't going\nto have much of a life because I was no longer the person who had gone overseas. An\nawtul lot had happened. Deeply, deeply transforming stuff. And they agreed. Somebody\nfouled up, and in April 1946, just before Passover...uh...I got orders to go home to be\ndemobilized and I asked Heim about it and he sort of shrugged and we talked to Ruth\nKluger in Paris who was theoretically making these arrangements and she sort of\nshrugged. So I came home. And I became a civilian. Uh...There was an Haganah office in\nNew York. It had been organized for a very simple purpose. Money. They had to buy\nships. Ships are expensive. The only place they really could buy ships was the United\nStates because they wanted larger ships. Ships for 2 or 3 hundred people were not going\nto be able to do this thing anymore. They needed big ships. So they were going to buy\nthem in the United States, and they sent 4 Palestinians over, led by who later became , the\nfirst chief of staff of the Israel army, later the President of the in Haifa. A marvelous,\nmarvelous man. When I got to New York, I went into the office, naturally, and asked me\nif I would go to work for them. As long as I had to be in the United States for a little\nwhile making speeches for the Haganah. So from the end of April 1946 until February\n1947, I was on the staff of the Haganah in the United States making speeches. Esther and\nI lived in New York. First in a hotel, but then we couldn't stand it. And Michael was\ngetting sick in this hotel. The food just wasn't for a 2 year old. And...uh...so we found an\napartment on Staten Island, and we lived over there. It was not a good time. I was away\nmore than I was there....uh... making the same speech over and over and over again to\nsecret meetings of Jews to get money. Was not my style, but it was what had to be done.\nThere was some compensation. There was a rainy night. I don't remember what month\nwhen I was allowed to go to Baltimore. And down on the docks was a ship, then called\nthe SS Warfield. The Warfield being the same person as the Duchess of Windsor because\nher daddy was the President of the steamboat company that ran steamboats up around the\nChesapeake Bay. This was a Chesapeake Bay steamer. Decrepit, messed up which the\nHaganah had bought, and we were sending off to Europe to transport Jews. We estimated\nthat maybe 25,000 Jews uncomfortable could get on it. When it sailed in June of 47 to\nPalestine from France as the exodus 1947, it had 52 hundred people on board, and we'll\npick that up later because I have more to do with the exodus. That night in Baltimore we\ncommissioned the exodus in a non-existent Jewish navy. Gave it flag, and all the rest of\nthe . A word ought to be said about Americans for Haganah. It was an astonishing\norganization. It's head was a multi-millionaire oil man named Rudolph Sonaborn, whose\nlast claim to fame was that he married Dorothy Shift, the publisher of the New York Post\nthen. But he gave at least half his time to Americans for Haganah. We met every Tuesday\nfor lunch in a hotel in New York, and...uh... books have been written about this operation,\nwhich was clandestine. The bank account was the bank account of the Palestine pavilion\nof the New York Worlds Fair. There had been a New York World's Fair in\n1930...what...8, 9, something like that, and they never closed the bank account of the...of\nthe Jewish pavilion or the Palestine Pavilion it was called. And that money was funneled\nthrough the Palestine Pavilion bank account, and we never got caught. Later, there was\ntrouble with armed shipments to the Haganah, but that was much later, after the\nFoundation was dated as a matter of fact. This group that met on Tuesdays was a\nremarkable bunch, and the fact that we raised several million dollars for the purchase of\nships is amazing because we were a small group and you couldn't talk about it. You\ncouldn't do the usual kinds of fund raising hoopla. We met in people's rumpus rooms,\nthey were called in those days. They are called family rooms today, I think.\nAnd...uh...everybody had to know everybody, and they couldn't talk about it, and they\nhad to get lots of money. It was a wild operation. I did not enjoy it. One of my tasks, for\nexample, was to go once a week for lunch to the 21 Club in New York because one of the\nKrinlers was interested in us, and he introduced me to all these degenerate people. He\nused to hang out at the 21 Club and I'd get money from them. Uh...Some of the ladies\nwere very frank about where they money came from and how it came. And I had a\nconscious problem about this, but it didn't last because buying the ships was more\nimportant than my Jewish conscious. But it was a tough time for my family and me. We\nwere relieved when finally, finally, finally the paperwork was done, and we could get\nback to Europe, we thought. I flew to Paris and went in back in to Germany immediately.\nGot us a house in Heidelberg, and then went to Paris to pick Esy up when she and\nMichael arrived. They got stuck in Paris for 4 week because the paperwork wasn't in\norder. She lived in a very fancy hotel in Paris for 4 weeks, and then we moved into\nHeidelberg and the next phase of this operation begins. bP HP",
        "A: Good place to break.",
        "A: Uh...We went out to dinner at one day last week, and he was alert and he was alive and\nhe was fine.",
        "A: One day in early Fall (clearing throat) 1945 I walked into our building in Regensburg and\nI went upstairs and I heard very loud sounds, kids stomping and shouting, and so I went\nto see what it was. There about 20 teenagers with this short, very short, heavy set, young,\nyoung man leading them in a dance...in a song. Uh. was the theme and stuff and he had\nthose kids going absolutely mad. And I watched this guy and said to myself, \"He's a\nleader. That man is a leader.\" So I met him. His name was Leon Retter from , a genius\nwho had been sent by the Russians to the language school in Moscow when he was 16.\nHe spoke then and still speaks somewhere between 10 and 15 languages quite fluently.\nHe was a captain in the Red Army during the war, and at the end of the war decided that\nhe wanted to get out. This was what he wanted that he wanted to live in Palestine. So he\nran away, and came into American zone in Germany. Landed in Regensburg. some\nmonths later his girlfriend joined him and they married. They are still married and they\nlived in Munich for reasons which will become clear. Uh...We had organized not only the\ncentral committee, but regional committees. More people involved the better. He became\na member of our regional committee, and then I...uh...let Klausner know, as a matter of\nfact, that I thought this guy was...uh...good material and Klausner met him, moved him\ndown to Munich and Irea which is the name he took instead of Leon,...uh...for reasons\nthat have to do with language. Leon means lion and Irea means lion. Their translation.\nAnd Redder became just because he wanted it to. He...uh...became the foreign secretary\nof the displaced persons. It was he who dealt with the big people who came in. It was he\nwho went to Frankfort headquarters to, as he said, make demands on behalf...on behalf of\nthe Jewish displaced persons. Tough minded,...uh...brilliant orator who in the spring of\n1946 was sent to the United States for his first UJA missions. And he has done UJA off\nand on ever since until his retirement about 2 years ago. He's 68 now. He...uh.. should\nhave become a major political figure, but...uh...Mr. Ben-Gurion was rather capricious\nabout his boys, as he called them, and when there was a revolt against Ben-Gurion within\nthe Labor Party, in the 50's, Irea joined the revolt. And the old man punished him and\nthen made him do projects for him afterwards. Irea decided that the way to get along in\nIsrael was to be independent, and so he become Israel's first management consultant on\nhuman relations. As new immigrant groups came in, there were all kinds of tensions and\nproblems and he would work with those. He's a remarkable fellows, still one of my very\nclosest friends. He had the right kind of hutspah in huge amounts. Uh...It was fun to\nwatch him telling General Clay what General Clay had to do. (Laughter) It was really\ngreat. He's also...was great with the Jews. I went with him one night to one of the DP\ncamps where we had just gotten a telephone call that there was a riot going on. The\nG...the American Army did some not very bright things. As we became friendly with the\nGermans, which we did by 1946, 47...Secretary Burns had led the way on that...they\nbegan to put German police in Jewish DP camps, and the Jews didn't like it much. And\nwe had that kind of situation, and the Jews went berserk. So Irea and I went. He got up on\nthe back of the truck and he hushed those Jews, and then he spoke to them with his kind\nof beery voice, and they went back to their room...home to behave themselves. I have\nnever seen one person stop a riot before, but he did. He had that kind of power.\nExtremely, extremely charismatic, powerful guy, who became my brother. And...uh...has\nremained very much a brother. (Sigh) I am trying to think of.... Well, we had a Congress\nof Displaced Persons...uh...1n the first year, and unquestionably, the most influential\nindividual there, besides Klausner, was Nesher. Okay, that's Nesher. That's who he is.\nThat's who he was. Uh...He went to Palestine in time for the War of Independence cause\nhe insisted on doing so. He and Lilly took a bunch of kids on a legal trip because there\nwere some... And both of them went into the Army, and I tease them to this day about the\nfact that she outranked him. He was a sergeant and she was a lieutenant. Lilly, his wife, is\none of the experts on Soviet Jewry. She was taking Jews out of the Soviet Union when\nnobody was taking Jews out of the Soviet Union. And...uh...still there was a great deal\nabout Soviet Jewry. Okay, so much for Nesher Klausner. When I saw Klausner at the\nChaplains\u2019 meeting, first time I had seen him since Dachau, and we made all the plans\nand started the package system. Uh...It was clear that any Chaplain who wanted to do the\njob right should do so in consultation with Abe. The leaders of the DPs were his. He was\nthe President. The processes of the central committee he was in the middle of. He tried\nnot to deal with the U.S. Army because he was absent without leave. He spent total of 8\nmonths absent without leave. He had no assignment. He didn't get paid. He also did not\ndo anything for the Army. He was unconnected to the American Army. He met every\nonce in awhile with some general, but he was unconnected with the American Army and\nnobody realized it. Uh...I knew it, but what the heck? It wasn't my business. One day I\nhad to go to 3rd Army Headquarters in . That was the day I saw all of General Patton's\ncars and jeeps and his private...uh...fleet. I went up to the Chaplain's office to get\nwhatever I went to get. I don't remember what. And I heard a voice call, \"Chaplain.\" So\neverybody in the room turned around because there must have been 15 chaplains in the\nroom, and this guy from inside the private office was pointing his finger at me. And I\nsaid, \"Yes, Sir.\" And I went in. A bird Colonel...uh...O'Reilley, he's Senior Chaplain of\nthe 3rd Army, regular Army Catholic, and he said, \"What's your name, Chaplain?\" I told\nhim my name. And he said, \"Tell me Lipman, do you happen to know a Chaplain named\nKlausner?\" I thought, \"Oh, boy!\" I said, \"Which one, Sir?\" And he crossed himself and\nsaid, \"Holy Mary, Mother of God. Don't tell me there are two of them.\" And I said, \"Yes,\nSir. There's Chaplain Berkland Klausner. There's Chaplain Abraham Klausner.\" What I\nknew that he didn't know was that Berk Klausner was in England, but that didn't matter. I\nwas telling the truth. He said, \"You know, I have been hearing rumors about a Chaplain\nKlausner in my area, but I don't get monthly reports from him. Do you ever see him.\"\nAnd I said, \"I suppose I could find him if I tried hard.\" He said, \"Would you do me a\nfavor?\" \"Of course, Sir.\" \"Would you please tell him that I am looking for him because I\nmust have his monthly reports?\" I said, \"I will certainly tell him.\" Next day, I had lunch\nwith Abe in Munich and I said to him, \"Here's your message from Chaplain O'Reilly.\"\nAnd he listened, and he said, \"Okay, message has been received.\" I said, \"No. Let's do it.\nLet's regularize you. It will be good for you, and it would enhance your status. It wouldn't\ndestroy your status with the Army.\" We sat down in his house on with the help of the\nJDC women sitting at the typewriters and we wrote 8 monthly reports. (Laughter)\nNumbers, statistics, services conducted, counseling sessions held, the works! And he\nsigned them, and we sent them in through channels with no note of any kind. We\narranged for one of the officers to see that they got into the mail system and they landed\nin the Chaplain's office. Next thing Abe heard was he got orders brought to him by a\nfinance officer who was bringing him 8 months pay. He hadn't been paid for 8 months.\nHe got this stack of occupation currency, and the finance officer said, \"While I was\ncoming here, the Adjutant General asked if I would bring you these. They are orders.\"\nAnd Abe looked and in the orders he was assigned to a hospital in Munich. And that's\nwhere he remained. He just kept right on going. Never moved into the hospital. Reported\nto the hospital. Spoke to the hospital Chaplain and said, \"If you have any Jews problems,\ncall me.\" (Laughter) And disappeared and never heard from again. That's how he\noperated. Abe opened DP camps. He started two hospitals. When they emptied out\nDachau, he took care of those people. There was a famous transport of twelve hundred\nHungarians who were supposed to go back to Hungary. The U.S. Army had a policy. It\nhad two parts. First, one was everybody goes home. No matter what. It's our job to\nrepatriate. It isn't our job to move people around and second of all, there are no Jews.\nThey are Poles. They are Hungarians. They are Rumanians. They are Germans. They are\nAustrians. There aren't any Jews. And at first, there were mixed DP camps. And the\nArmy couldn't understand why there were riots every night. People getting hurt every\nnight. Some of us wrote letters through channels to the Commanding General, a fellow\nnamed Eisenhower, saying, \"Can't do this. The Jews are in unique position, and you\nreally must somehow, Sir, ... uh...organize special camps for them.\" It wasn't until July\nthat orders came out (a) declaring Jews a nationality and (b) permitting separate facilities.\nSo we started...we... UNRRA blew it. They started Jewish DP camps. UNRRA was\nunable to do so. Well, Abe did it. He had this crazy capacity to do all sorts of things with\nvery few resources. Another funny story that happened to Abe, but it's not about him.\nObviously, the Jews wanted to leave. One day, he was in his office, still at the Dorchus\nMuseum, before he moved into... There was a knock on the door, and this little Jew came\nbursting in and, \"Herr Chaplain. Herr Chaplain.\" \"Yes.\" This was...conversation was\ncarried on in Yiddish although an instantaneous translation. Uh...\"I have a visa.\"\n\"Wonderful,\" said Abe. And they danced together and they pranced together, \"You have\na visa. Where are you going?\" \"Costa Rica.\" \"Marvelous, it's a beautiful country,\" and\nthey kibitzed around for a good...and the guy was about to leave and he turned to Abe and\nsaid, \"Herr Chaplain, May I ask a question?\" \"Of course.\" \"Where's Costa Rica?\" He had\nno idea what part of the world Costa Rica was in, and I suspect he didn't go there either.\nHe may have started for there, but he didn't land there. What else should I tell you about\nKlausner? Uh...The Army arranged for him to come home in 1946 too. He will give you\nall kinds of stories about how...how and why it happened, but it happened. As soon as he\ngot to the United States, he began to maneuver to get back because that's all he wanted to\ndo. He was a bachelor, and this was his life. And General Hilldring was Assistant\nSecretary of State for International Affairs. Good guy! And Abe went to him, and\nHilldring arranged for him to go back to Germany and he did go back. Did some\ninteresting things that had to do with the exodus people as a matter of fact and when I get\nto exodus we'll talk about that. And then, eventually, I came home and...uh...took up a\nRabbinical career. He's been in Yonkers, New York, for many, many years. He's just\nretiring.",
        "A: No. It was not in Regensburg, and it was later.",
        "A: It's from Heidelberg to another town.",
        "A: Went to Heidelburg to live. And I did (sigh) three jobs. I was responsible for all routine\nliaison with the American Army. there was a Brigadier General in Frankfort\nHeadquarters, a good man, solid man, with whom I had the right to talk anytime I wanted\nto, or he would call me whenever he had something, and we talked a great deal. Second,\nany publicity or public relations that had to do with the underground, I was responsible\nfor and...uh...I'll come back to that in a minute. My third one was to lead transports with a\nguy who was then called Wolf, whose name was not and is not Wolf. Uh...His name is\nEfrian Franke. Uh...He lives in . He's an attorney, Israel's most distinguished restitution\nattorney. Married to a woman named Hanna, who was one of the members of this group\nin Germany, and they have an infinite number of grandchildren by now. It was the second\nmarriage for both of them. So, Efrian who was never called Efrian and I did transports\ntogether, as the leaders of them. I was called to Paris one day because a major American\nnewspaper person wanted an interview with the famous Colonel Wolf, and I arranged it.\nEfrian was in Paris, and we made this interview by agreeing to meet at a certain place.\nWe met at that place, got into a cab and went to another place. Got into a cab, and went to\na third place. I guess it was about the 4th place where Efrian finally walked in, and the\nreporter joined us. Because everybody assumed all the time that the British were looking\nfor us. That was one of my P.R. jobs. The most important P.R. job I guess I ever did had\nto do with the late M . We had a contact in the United States where reporters were\nconcerned. Let me tell you about one of the incidents and then I will come to . Uh...The\ndoor bell rang one day in Heidelberg, and a young, fresh faced guy said, \"My name is\nDick Dudman, and I want a story about the Haganah.\" And I said, \"Never heard of it,\"\nand I closed the door. And I sent a wire to the late I.F. Stone in New York. Isy Stone was\nour New York contact. He was working for P.M. newspaper then, and nobody could get\ninto Haganah for a story unless Stone sent him. And I in this cable said, \"What's this\nDudman guy? Do I let him in or not? He claims to be from the Denver Post.\" And I got a\nwire back saying, \"Yal, He's okay.\" So I managed to get word...uh...I don't remember\nhow I did it or whether Isy did it, but Dudman came to my door again. And we made him\ninto a displaced person. Gave him everything he needed to be a displaced person, and\nsent him on one of the trips. And he wrote a memorable series of articles for the Denver\nPost on being a displaced person, and what it was like to go on one of these illegal\ntrips...uh...for which he got a name and fellowship by the way. Later, we became friends\nagain here in Washington, because he was the head of the Washington Bureau, the St.\nLouis Post Dispatch, and...uh...now lives in Ellsworth, Maine. He and his wife decided\nthat it was a small town for them. They bought a radio station in Ellsworth. Dick also\nbecame famous because...uh...rcemember when we were not in Cambodia, he was\ncaptured...uh...with the American troops in Cambodia...with his press credentials, and he\nwas missing for several weeks and we all went out of our minds till he came back quite\nunharmed. Remarkable reporter, and those stories I think...uh...were very exciting and\nvery important in having Americans understand what this crazy underground was all\nabout. But...uh...I guess the longest lasting piece of P.R. has to do with a movie, which\nwas made by Myrlon in..starring his wife,, who is now his widow. She was a writer.\nUh...He came with full credentials, of course, and moved into our house 1n Heidelberg.\nHe was going to make a movie of one of our transports because the story of this movie\nwas this displaced person and how this displaced person got to Palestine. And obviously\nthis displaced person had to be out of Germany. And we decided to use one of our regular\ntransports. So one night, we applied all transports out of our part of German...the ones I\nwas responsible for left on Saturday night. Why, I hear you ask, Saturday night? Because\nas few American troops as possible were on duty Saturday night. Saturday night is\ngetting drunk night or having a beer night or reading a good book night, but you're not on\nduty Saturday night if you can avoid it, so it was easiest to get through the border on\nSaturday nights. We always had some kind of papers. We never tried just to sneak\nthrough a border. That was too risky. Uh... There were times when for small groups we\nwould go through borders, but we had a list of the constabulary units and their schedules,\nwhere they would be when General Mickelson always saw that we had those. That was\nthe guy at Frankfort Headquarters who was my contact, a Brigadier named Abraham\nMickelson. And he provided those. Uh...But the big transports, we had to go through\nroads and border points because we were in 6 by 6 trucks, and some German trucks,\nthough we never used wood burning ones. We bought trucks. We bought gasoline. If did\nnot have Army supplies unless we could steal them, and you couldn't steal large\nquantities of gasoline. That's hard to do. But by this time we had a budget and we were\ngetting money from the United States. This was a transport of about twelve hundred\npeople, leaving Saturday night from the town of Noowhom. We owned a barracks in\nNoowhom. We bought it. It was ours. And we could use it to get people ready to go. And\nwe would appear there on either Friday or sometime early Saturday, and the people\nwould arrive. How they were selected and how they got there is a story unto itself, but\nthat's what we eventually had 130 Palestinians doing out around the countryside. They\nhad political problems; they had age problems; they had all kinds of problems in making\nup these transports. How did we know how many to send? Uh...Let me ask myself the\nquestion when I finish the Myrlon Lynn story because it's a separate story which has its\nown kind of interest. We got instructions on my telephone. Saturday night we would have\nour people all ready. This was a well organized thing. We knew who was going to be in\nwhich trucks. If they were pregnant women, they were in the same truck, and there was a\nnurse with them. Sometimes the nurse was a woman named Esther Lipman, who was not\na nurse. But she was pregnant at the time, so she knew all about it. (Laughing) We were\ngoing to have our second child, so Esther a few pieces of equipment and she went on\nsome of these transports as transport nurse. We never delivered a baby on one of these\ntransports, I'm glad to say. It's just as well. The tough part of the trip was the night part\ninto the Black Forest. And so we left. Every 2 hours we would stop for relief. We left at\nmidnight so that we had two or three 2-hour periods before dawn. At dawn or shortly\nthereafter, we would arrive at what was known as the picnic area. We had been looking\nfor this for weeks, and when we found it, it was as though we had found Heaven. There\nwas a place in the middle of the Black Forest where a small road went off to the right.\nAnd they went about a half a mile and then there was a circle, at the end of which there\nwas a wine house. End of road. That's perfect. No traffic. On the side of the road was a\nlittle cabin. And there we got one of the great breaks of the entire era. When a DP named\nGittshuck, who worked for us, and I were looking for this place...and...for a place, and we\ncame to this, we decided we better check out that cabin. We knocked on the cabin door,\nand a lady answered wearing Bavarian costumes as everybody in the Black Forest did.\nThey wore old fashioned Bavarian costumes. And we talked to her and asked her if she\nwould have any objections if every once in awhile, every week, 10 days, some people\nwould come and rest on the side of the hill and use the stream at the bottom of the hill\njust to wash. And she said, \"I have no objection, but who are they?\" And I said, \"They're\nconcentration camp survivors who are going to their new homes, and we are moving\nthem.\" And she said, \"Oh, can I help?\" And I said, \"If you want to feed them, 1t would be\na great help. We often have children. It would be marvelous if we could leave cereal with\nyou and we could have hot gruel for these kids when they get here and hot tea for the\nadults. That would be absolutely marvelous.\" Nothing to that. Asked some more\nquestions, as I was interested. This woman was a Jew, who had married when she was at\nthe University a non*Jewish German. When the Nazi...when the war started, he was\npulled into the Army. She decided and he decided and his father decided that she should\nhide out in this cabin with the father because he lived there in the middle of the woods.\nHow many people would come into the Black Forest looking for somebody? Uh...She\nwas announced as his daughter-in-law, and her husband was off in the Army being a\nhero. Her husband was killed on the eastern front, so she stayed. Took care of the old\nman. She took care of the old man till he died about 1946, and because some of the\nneighbors knew that she was Jewish and nobody had turned her in, she decided to live out\nher life there. She had a job. She worked. She had her husband's pension from the Army,\nwhatever it was, and she was living there. So then we were able to tell her that these were\nJews. And this became our picnic area. Every transport going to Milhouse in France...uh\n...went through there, and this woman loved it. She was magnificent. I remember her with\ngreat affection. Any how, after resting at the picnic ground and having a meal, we got\nback into the trucks and headed for a place called Pompdecess, where the only bridge\nacross the Rhine was. It was a military bridge. And...uh..we got to Pompdecess, and we\nhad to be there at 4 o'clock. Not 5, not 3 because the French officer whom we owned, the\n, Immigration officer, was sure to be on duty then. Any day but Sunday. And he would\ntake our papers and pass them right through. So we got through the Duon easily. And\nthen from there to Milhouse in France was nothing to it, and there there was a big railroad\nyard and the French Haganah picked up the people at Mulhous and took them by train to\nsomewhere in the Marseilles area depending on where the ship was going to be sit, Port\nBoog or Marseilles itself, whatever. This particular transport had Tereska on board as a\nDP. She had DP papers. She had DP clothing. She was a DP. In front of this particular\ntransport just before my car was the camera car with Myra. And we had a terrible time\nwith Myer. It wasn't his fault. He had to make noise. He had to call something out to the\ncamera crew. You can't do it. He had to call this... There's simply no way to do it. You're\ngoing to shut up or you ain't going. You see you had to go through the American zone of\noccupation to the French zone of occupation. Pompdecess was in the French zone. The\nFrench zone was a small zone in the southwestern Germany. The French insisted on\nhaving a zone. It was a four-power power thing after all. So going from the American\nzone to the French zone was the dangerous one. And having the camera crew along was\ngreat, because we say the United Nations wanted to have records of all these transports of\nsurvivors as they go to their new homes and...uh..we have a crew with us, and want to\ntake your picture at the border as you do your duty, and we got through very fast. Uh...It\nwas very difficult for Myer. I am sure he suffered a lot. It's got the illegals. It is still\navailable in 16 millimeter. It still gets rented I understand by school groups and others\nwho want to see it. One minor tragedy in it which we laugh about in our family, but it\nisn't totally funny. Esther was along on that transport as transport nurse. The only time\nthat I appear in the film was at Pompdecess where I am standing with the Duan going\nover the papers and getting people ready to go through. And Esther was filmed there too.\nThere were other pictures of me in the...in my car and so forth. We had a car with a\nmoveable roof so that we could stand on the seat and watch what was going on.\nDangerous, but...uh...very effective because we had to see what was going on. We didn't\nwant to lose any trucks. They had to stay in line. Uh...We had to go through one or two\ntowns, went through Fribrook for example and in the streets of Fribrook, we did not want\nto lose trucks. But the only one that got printed and is in the film is me at the...there's\nnothing of Esy. All the shots of Esther got cut in the editing, and she never stopped\nteasing Myer about it. And whenever we met, he would come up and want to hug her\nhello and she would say, \"You don't want to hug me. You wouldn't even put me in your\nmovie.\" (Laughter) So...uh...that's our...Myer saga of The Illegal. Incidentally,\nthey...uh...filmed the...the boat. That part of the trip being caught by the British, going to\nCyprus. They got a complete record on the illegal. I forget how much of it is in the film.\nBut that was part of the P.R. job as well as taking transports. Uh...With one exception we\nhad no difficulty, with the transports to France. Uh...One night they got nasty at the\nborder and kept us there 5 hours, and it was only when we finally, finally found Paul\nEdwards... It being a Saturday night, he wasn't at home either. When he finally got\nhome...uh...just before dawn, that he was able to say to these guys, \"Are their papers in\norder? Is my signature on them? What do you want? Get them out of there? You've had\nthose peoples in there a long time. They're tired. They have to get where they're going.\"\nSo the soldiers backed down. And...uh..that had been the result of a tip from a CID\nCriminal Investigation Division of the Army, I am sorry to say, a young man I knew. The\nson of somebody I had grown up with in Pittsburgh who was stuck on his duty and he got\na...in his investigations or whatever, he heard that a bunch of Jews were going out on\nSaturday night and he notified the border station. But it happened. Not everybody\nwas...uh...all for what we were doing. There were people aside from the British who\ndidn't think we were...uh...behaving properly. Okay, that's transports. Oh, no, there's one\nmore thing about it that I must mention. How did we get the quotas and the number of\npeople who were going to take a transport? I had a telephone. Because I was a Lieutenant\nColonel, I had a telephone that could call outside the country. Whenever we were\nscheduled for a transport, at precisely 7 o'clock in the evening, my phone would ring. It\nwould be a female voice talking English with a heavy French accent who never identified\nherself and who gave me a list of agricultural implements and tools and God knows what\nall, that I was to copy down with numbers. And the code Hiamhead I didn't know what it\nsaid. I immediately called Munich and transmitted it to Munich, and that's how we knew\nabout our transports. Some years later, 48 or 9, I don't remember, I was asked by the UJA\nto go to the opening of the campaign in Nashville, Tennessee, at a posh country club and\nI went. Sitting next to me at dinner was a woman named Paulette Oppert O P PERT, a\nFrench Jew, whose husband had been killed in the resistance who had herself been in the\nresistance and who after the war worked for the French Haganah and for people in Paris.\nShe later married an American businessman named Fink, and lived in Minneapolis for\nmany, many years. I saw her once in awhile. I listened, and I said to her, \"Paulette. I\nknow your voice.\" And she said, \"I have been sitting here going crazy cause I know your\nvoice.\" It was she. She had been calling from Paris all those months, giving me all those\ninstructions out of order which she understood, not a word of which I understood, that\nmade it possible for the transports to go. We felt like blood brother and sister. Okay,\nthat's the...uh...that's the transport business. What's next?",
        "A: Well, first of all we got a call from Paulette, telling us that we had to 52 hundred people\nin Marseilles on a certain date. The largest transport that had ever been contemplated.\nAnd the people in the camps did their job. And it was decided that two of the transports\nwould go by train, by way of Strasbourg, and three of them would go by truck and they\nwould be back to back and then we would go down, turn around and come back, load up,\nand do this three times. Two of them being Saturday nights, and one of them being mid-\nweek which we had never done before. But what're we going to do. Because we had to\nget these people on board. The British were watching this ship in sit where it was, and\nthey didn't have a heck of a lot of time, so we rushed it. All of these people had to get\nnew identities because we using a series of French transit visas that the Minister of the\nInterior people had kindly prepared for us, but they were...we would call in blank. They\nweren't really blank at all. They had names on them. They just weren't names of any\nliving people, and they all had ages and they all had birth places. So we prepared in\nadvance DP cards. Uh...All DPs had identity cards issued by UNRRA with military\nauthorization and we had tens of thousands of them that we had printed and...uh...we\nissued new ones to all of these people with the proper stamps on them and then we\nhanded them out at Nooam in the barracks 1n the stables there, and told them, \"You got a\nnew name. You got to know how old you are. You got to know where you were born. It\nhas nothing to do with you. It has to do with whatever that name is on that piece of\npiece.\" So they all had to learn them. And some of the old people had difficulties with\nthis. Kids had no trouble at all. There was one cute little kid with obviously orthodox\norigins was standing there holding these things and chuckling back and forth as he\nmemorized his name and his birthplace and his birth date. It was nice. And then we took\nthem. Normally, when we got Milhouse there was a little hotel there. A wonderful lady\nowned it who fed us a hot meal. This is the staff who had gone on the trip. The people\nwere on the train bound for Marseilles already...and...uh...we'd spend the night and part\nof the next day. Relax a little bit, have some fun, drink some good wine. I learned to eat\npate for the first time and...Milhouse 1s in...uh...SS Lorraine...that part of France and they\nmade wonderful pat\u00e9. So this time we got there early evening. We turned in. Didn't have\nall that wonderful hospitality. And in the middle of the night, we got back in our trucks\nand we went back to , and that night we loaded up and we did that three times in 8 days.\nEsy was not with me on the Exodus ones. I don't remember why not, but she wasn't.\nAnd...uh...when I left I said to her as I always did, \"I'll be back when I get here,\" and all\nshe would say to people who called was, \"I am sorry. He's out of town. Have you tried\nthe Munich office?\" Uh...This was the longest I had been away. And she allowed as how\nshe was a little bit apprehensive, but nothing we could do about it. That's how the people\ngot on the exodus. The French Haganah did a superlative job in getting all those trains.\nUh...That's a lot of bribery for the railway officials to... These were private trains. These\nweren't just seats on train. Twelve hundred people is a lot of...lot of people. So these were\nthree transports of between a thousand and twelve hundred each, and the other\napproximately two thousand went by train from Germany. Then the exodus story doesn't\nend there. It goes on because as people should know, the British sent that ship back. Not\nthe ship. The ship stayed in Haifa Harbor. It's still there. By the way, it's falling apart. It is\ndisintegrating and will not last forever. They've tried to preserve it. It's not working very\nwell. It's been in a museum for quite awhile. They sent the people back in three ships to a\nplace called Port Luke, where they went on a hunger strike. They wouldn't get off. The\nBritish took them off by force, and then put them back on again and shipped them around\nto Hamburger in the British zone where they were taken, by I think, truck or train to two\nconcentration camps. One 1s called Amistow and one is called Popendorf where they\nincarcerated them. One of the things Abe Klausner did was organize their escape with a\nbunch of the Haganah people, and they escaped. And one of my great stories was\ngreeting some of them again at Nooam when they went a second time. I don't know how\nmany of them went the second time by Haganah, but I had all transport of them one\nnight, twelve hundred of them who went. They landed on Cyprus. Cyprus requires\nspecific mention. We made jokes about Cyprus. We are going to have a Jewish State, but\nit's not going to be an ordinary state. It's already an empire. It has a colony. Cyprus.\nBecause we had tens of thousands of Jews interned on Cyprus by the British in\nconcentration camps. The first immigrants who came into Israel after independence were\nthe people from Cyprus. They had priorities. God knows they had earned them, and they\ncame through. That was Cyprus. I have never been to Cyprus. I should go there some\nday. What's next Linda?",
        "A: Uh...I think we ought to do the baby before we forget it.",
        "A: A good friend of mine, displaced person, had a child. Called me from where they were,\ntold me that they were in terrible trouble. The child was born with infantile jaundice, and\nshe was getting dehydrated and they weren't sure she could live. It was particularly\npainful because they were displaced persons and looked forward to this child, even more\nparticularly painful for this father was a physician and didn't know how to save his child.\nSo Esther and I got into our truck...our car...1t was truck, and we went to that town to be\nwith them. When I got there the father told me in the most agonized tones I have ever\nheard that he had a decision to make and didn't know how to make it. That 30 or 40 miles\ndown the road, not in the country, was a very famous German...uh...obstetrician,\npediatrician, who was barred from practicing medicine because he had not only been a\nNazi, but he had done experiments on Jewish children. But, said the father, this man can\nsave my daughter if anybody can. He has unique information and methods that nobody in\nthis hospital knows about. I said, \"I don't think I am asking you. I think I am going to tell\nyou. Your daughter's life is more important than the fact that this man was a Nazi. If he\ncan save your daughter's life, that's saving the world for you. You gotta do it.\" So he\ndecided we better do that. So I went down in my jeep and met this doctor who was living\nin a little cabin in the woods. A very dignified, middle-aged man who spoke relatively\ngood English. I told him the circumstances and said we would pay him well to come and\ntake care of this child. And he said, \"Alright.\" And he got into the jeep with his bag and\nhe came. And he spent about 48 hours without sleep taking care of this baby. And he\nsaved her. After it was all over, I drove him back to his cabin and gave him German\nmoney, a large sum and I said, \"I trust that's enough for your services.\" He said, \"I don't\ncare about the money.\" He said, \"I want a letter from you addressed to military\ngovernment saying that you recommend that I be permitted to practice again because I\nsaved this Jewish child.\" Now I said, in effect, \"Doctor, you should live so long.\" And I\nleft the money, and I left with him not being very happy with me. The end of this story 1s\nnot a pleasant one. The child developed acute leukemia at the age of 4 and died. The\nfamily had other children, but that was a bad blow. That was in the United States. Okay.\nYou know who to talk to if you want more about that one, and if that person says to you,\n\"Cut it completely,\" I insist you have to do so. She has a perfect right to her privacy and\nif this 1s too much to identification it's got to go. Next, after the exodus we went into a\nbad time. Uh...First of all, all the stuff was going on at the United Nations. Would there\nbe a Jewish State, whether or not there would be a Jewish State, where they'd be\npartitioned, wouldn't there be partition and what should we be doing meanwhile. So I sat\nin my office day after day in Heidelberg doing not very much. Uh...Taught English to a\ncouple of medical students at Heildelberg University. Uh...This, I think, is worthwhile\nstory. Uh...The University gave 15 fellowship to Jewish survivors to study medicine. Full\ntuition and books. Three of them I still have communication with. One of them was my\nsecretary's husband, and...uh...he practices as an internist in New York, and we are good\nfriends. I taught him English. She was my secretary because she spoke Hebrew, German,\nYiddish, Hungarian, Russian, and was a remarkable woman. She still is. Her husband 1s a\ngood doctor. Two of them are my story really. It...uh...has to be told backwards. About\ntwo years ago, here in Washington, my wife attended a seminar at the Washington School\nof Psychiatry, being conducted by two very imminent psychiatrists from the University of\nCincinnati Medical School, named Ornstein. Anna and Paul Ornstein. They had the full\nday and Esther went up at the end to thank them, and Anna said to her, \"Tell me your\nname again. I want to remember you.\" She told her her name. Paul, who was standing\nabout 10 feet away, came over and said, \"What did you say your name was?\" She told\nhim. He said, \"Are you by any chance related to...to Chaplain Lipman.\" Anybody who\ncalls me Chaplan Lipman goes back to Germany. She said, \"Yes, I am married to him.\"\nAt which point, he bursts into tears, threw his arms around her and wouldn't let her go.\nHe and Anna had been two of those medical students in Heidelberg. Very poor. They had\na room in a German house. The Germans would do nothing for them. They lived, aside\nfrom going to medical school which they wanted to do, for Friday night for whenever I\nwas in town we had a Shabbat service, and if anybody else could conduct one when I\nwasn't there, they had a Shabbat service, followed by a Shabbat dinner for all the Jews in\nthe area. Displaced persons, G.I.s, the Palestinians who might be passing through because\nour house was a way station for any illegal going through. We had 4 bedrooms on the\nthird floor with 12 army cots and we had as many as 14 people on a given night.\nUh...And then of course the arms and the czar. They came and went without us. They had\na key to the cellar and they moved out. After the service and dinner, we sit around and\ntalked. And it was the only adult conversation these people had and they thought of the\nChaplain as somebody very special. The next night after this revelation, Paul gave a\nlecture in Washington and I went and then we went out afterwards to drink coffee and\nbegin to catch and he looked at me and he smiled and he said, \"You know. It's eerie.\" I\nsaid, \"Why?\" He said, \"You are only 4 years older than I am.\" I said, \"Oh, you're thinking\nof that Chaplain.\" He said, \"That's right. I have never quite gotten rid of that image.\" I\nsaid, \"Please get rid of it (laughter) real fast.\" And we have seen a great deal of one\nanother since then, and are good friends. The person who saved their lives in Heildelberg\nwas a Protestant minister. Herman Maus,...uh... whom I call the of Heildeberg. I read an\narticle about him once. He had been a very famous pastor...uh...before World War II was\npastor of the Holy Ghost Church of Heidelberg. He had become a Zionist in 1933\nbecause when he grew up in Titisay in the Black Forest, his father, a poor pastor, had not\nbeen able to send him to college. A Jew in Titisay came to him and said, \"Herman, you\nwant to be a pastor like a father don't you?\" And he said, \"Yes. You have to go to school,\ndon't you.\" \"Yes. Okay, you go to school and I will take care of the bills. You just be a\ngood pastor.\" The year he graduated and was ordained the Jewish friend said, \"Herman,\nyou've done well. Before you take up your first congregation, you have a vacation\ncoming. He handed him some money and told him to take a vacation. And he went to\nSwitzerland and he turned up in Bail during the 1903 Zionist Convention, the famous one\nat which the Uganda Resolution was turned down, and he met Hertzl and he met Nordau\nand he met all of those people, and he joined up. David Yellin became his particular\nfriend. He made his first trip to Palestine with his wife and daughter in 1933 this summer,\nand he said to David Yellin, \"I'm not going back. There is where I belong and this is\nwhere I want to stay.\" And Yellin said to him, \"Herman, you haven't earned the right to\nstay. You have to go back and to earn it.\" The daughter said, \"My father can go back. I\nam not going.\" And the daughter remained in Jerusalem, became a weaver, until after\nWorld War II. When her father got very old, she went back to care of them because the\nmother couldn't anymore. But she lived in Palestine the whole time. He came back and\nbecause he was a pacifist, he went to every peace meeting there was anywhere in Europe\ncarrying messages about how to get Jewish kids out, how to save this, how to save that,\nand he did that until 1941 when the Germans picked him up and put him in a\nconcentration camp. And he and his wife both spent the war years in a concentration\ncamp, and they both survived. He came back and became Dean of the Diocese, that's\nsecond to the Bishop and did several things which were characteristic of him. First of all,\nevery Yom Kippur, he spent all day in the synagogue and fasted as penance for the\nGermans. Second of all, he announced to his congregation, that is to the people he dealt\nwith, that for the rest of his life he would never preach a sermon on a New Testament\ntheme. That it was time that Christians went back to their origins and learned what they\nshould have been. He preached only out of the Hebrew bible for the rest of his life, and\nhe never missed. I know that. Third of all, every Jewish displaced person around he\nwould take food to. He visited all of these students at least once a week bringing them\nfood on condition that they tell nobody. My secretary never told me that she ever had a\nvisit from him. Anna and Paul told me last year about their relationship with Maus. Maus\nhad been to my home. I had been to his home. He took me to meet Carl Yasburs, and we\nhad an incomprehensible conversation one day (laughter) and...uh..but he never told me.\nNo one told me. They kept their promise. He looked after these people. I think it's\nabsolutely fitting that there is a large forest in Israel named for him, and it pleases me.\nYou know this 1s all part of the Heidelberg saga.",
        "A: You know what we ought to do?",
        "A: It's a quarter after 2:00. My own suggestion would be that we break until you have a\nchance to read this stuff and I have a chance to go through the letters. I have mentioned a\nnumber of times the role that luck played in getting results and coincidence. Luck every\none in awhile reunited a family. I have one particular memory of being in my office in\nRegensburg, and a young woman came in, kind of agitated and excited. She had heard a\nrumor. She had no living relatives so far as she knew. Everybody had been killed, but she\nheard a rumor that maybe her younger brother had survived and was in Germany. And I\nsaid, \"Do you have any idea where?\" And she said, \"Yal. I think so.\" I said, \"The way to\nfind out is to go there. There's no point in trying to do it...uh...by any other way.\" So we\ngot in my jeep and we went. We got to this town and found a Jew and asked around and it\nwas her brother and he was there. And we really should have tape recorders in those days.\nEvery recording of the looks on their faces as they met each other, each\nbelieving...having been forced to believe that the other was dead. Every once in awhile a\ntragedy occurred however in this connection. I remember a case, sad case, which has\nsince been written up in the annals of Jews Law. I didn't decide it. A guy came in to one\nof our communities, lived there, and did not know what had become of his wife. Went on\nthe assumption that she was killed. We took a sort of informal position. Jewish law didn't\npermit it, but we took it informally that as a certain date there would be a presumption\nthat anybody who hadn't been heard from was dead. I don't remember whether it was 2\nyears or what length of time. And we...we knew this was an informal,\nnot...uh...sanctioned, position in Jewish law, but...uh...people had to get on with their\nlives. And a lot of people were just plain missing. There was no way to find out. And this\nman met a woman, wanted to marry her, and...uh...the time came and they married. And 6\nmonths later, his first wife turned up. She had been off in Soviet Union over in Siberia\nsomewhere and it had taken a long time for her to get out and to come to Germany.\nUnder Jewish law, of course, he had to divorce both of them. And as happens so often,\none does not hear the end of the story. I don't know with which one he ended up. I am not\nsure that it matters at this point. The dilemma...that was a very poignant one, and the fact\nthat I have only one story out of the many hundreds of people...uh...with whom I came\ninto contact during those 3 years is, I think, a marked statement of the propriety of\nmaking a decision that just set a date after which you have to gamble. You gamble. For\nmost of the people, they had a little mazal and the gamble was okay. When they married,\nthey could stay married. I don't think it's good luck that one's first spouse is dead, but\nthere it is",
        "A: We finished our work. We had a huge celebration in November when the partition plan\nwas announced...uh.......decided not to send transports thereafter because what was the\npoint of...of that, and then changed our minds because it was a good idea to keep pressure\non the British and have more people go to Cyprus. So we did somewhat. Not a great deal\nthough. Much of it by then was being done from Constansus or from Italy, not from\nFrance, and I simply don't know about those operations. One of the generalizations that\nyou have to know about is that none of us knew anything we didn't have to know. People\nkeep asking me did you know so and so who worked on this. One of my closest friends in\nthe kibitz in Israel 1s a man who was one of the leaders of the Berichah in Italy. I never\nmet him in Europe. I met him in 1960 when I got to the kibbutz because he was not my\nbusiness. I knew what I had to know and nothing else. In Washington, it's called \"need to\nknow.\" Uh...the doctrine of secrecy. But by February, March of 1948, it was clear that the\nState would come in to be, and that our work, Berichah, would end. There would be lots\nof people at the camps, a lot of to become Israelis would have to stay there. To help and\nto work and to teach and all the things that they were doing legally, but I was none of\nthose things. My operation would end. I turned down, with thanks, the suggestion, an\nurgent one, from of my...uh...I[sraeli friends that I take Esther and our one and half\nchildren and go to Israel and fly for the upcoming air force which at that point had one\nand a half piper cubs, I think. I said, \"No, Thanks, that...that isn't how I wanted to die,\" as\na matter (laughter) and decided very reluctantly to go home. Mostly because of the war.\nThat there was a war coming was clear, and...uh... I had had my war. So, in...uh...April of\n48, we tried to get out of Germany. It was almost as hard to get out of Germany as it was\nto get into Germany because the American Army had forms and you had to fill them out,\nand a pregnant wife caused problems. We wanted desperately to go to Norway. I have a\nthing for Scandinavia, and take the Oslo home. They wouldn't let us. The Oslo did not\nhave a full-time physician on board. Although my wife was having the healthiest\npregnancy in the history of the world, but there had to be a ship with a doctor. The Army\nwould not take responsibility. So we decided to come home on the SS America from\nLauf, and we close up the house and shipped everything home. Michael was very\ndisturbed because nothing he was ever going to see again. He was 3, and....uh...he\ncouldn't bring his dog, and I think that bothered him more than anything else. He...uh...he\nreally a mess. But we got to Paris, settled in for a couple of days and went to the boat .\nTwo of the people in the world closest to us were Eva Kaufman, now Eva Kaufman Penn,\nand her late husband, Rabbi Jay Kaufman. They had gone to Jerusalem in 1946 for Jay to\nget a doctorate at Hebrew University. Uh...They tried to leave the United States in the\nmiddle of the Maritime strike, and they got held up, and stayed at our house in Staten\nIsland. When they left they were allowed to go, but they couldn't take the car. They had\nPalestine and stayed with us until Paul was done. It was this kind of relationship. Then\nthey disappeared in the wilds of Jerusalem. What we heard about them once in awhile\nwas from Jay's parents who would drop us a note saying they got a letter. They were\nokay, and then we didn't get that any more for awhile because Jerusalem was under siege,\nand they were in the of Jerusalem. We were in Paris, and we went to to the and Michael\nwas riding a little kiddie car up and down the platform, and we suddenly heard a scream.\nIt was Eva. She and Jay had tickets for the same ship to come home. Coincidence. And\nshe was 2 weeks more pregnant than Esther, and we had a 5 day trip across the Atlantic\nwhich was an extraordinary experience, just trying to catch up with one another with\nthese two very pregnant ladies. Their son, their first child, was born on Israel's\nindependence day, and our second child was born 2 weeks later. I had had an offer from\nHenry Montaur, the head of the UJA, and the world's greatest fund raiser in all of history.\nI would add here that the 1948 UJA campaign raised a hundred and 80 million dollars. As\nof that date, that was the largest fund raising campaign in private hands in the history of\nthe world. And it was not surpassed for quite awhile. Now, of course, it sounds like small\nmoney thanks to inflation, but 1t was an absolutely amazing out-pouring of money.\nUh...And I spent 3 months doing speaking full time. One of my first speeches was on the\nnight of Israel's independence. I went to Norfolk, Virginia, to speak. Why was I sent to\nNorfolk? Because the featured speaker was the Senator from Kentucky, Alban Berkley,\nshortly to become Vice President of the United States. Now Barkley was one of the\nworld's worst speakers in terms of content, but he was an affable pleasant guy and he\nloved Jews. And he went around making speeches for Jews and for Israel and for Zionism\nall the time. So he was to be the featured speaker. He made a very short speech. He\nwalked over, wrapped himself in the Israel flag, and the cameras popped and I made a\nsort of content speech. Only later I discovered how much money he was paid for all the\nspeeches he made for the Zionist movement and for Israel and for the UJA and the rest.\nFortunately, I make it a practice not to have illusions about public figures, so I didn't get\ndisillusioned about him. Uh...He was not a pleasant experience. Most of them were very\npleasant experiences because to watch people give more money than they ought to\ngive...uh...has its beauties. And the statements they made. Uh...I didn't fight in the second\nWorld War. I was too old. I was not involved in the decimation of our people in Europe.\nTherefore, the least I can do is pay for it. And the money poured in. Unbelievable\namounts of money. I learned to respect sacrificial giving for the first time. There has been\nvery little of it, of course, but I respect 1t when I find it. I was invited to go to Hawaii to\nopen their campaign. That was exciting. Never been to Hawaii. And I understood that the\nHawaii Jewish community was all excited. When you're that far away, you get more\nexcitement. Excitement grows in direct proportion to the distance from the action.\nAnd...uh...Montra called, asked me to go. I said, \"What dates?\" And he said, \"Well, the\naffair is on June 2nd, but you would have to go a day or 2 early because it's a long way.\"\nAnd I said, \"Forget it. Not me. We're due to have a baby right on June 2nd.\" And...uh...he\nkinda said, \"So what?\" And I understood that. I said, \"Well, I wasn't there when the first\none was born, and I have solemn advice from my wife that if I am not there when the\nsecond one is born, there won't be a third and I won't have a wife. And I believe her.\"\nAnd he was a little bit upset, but he accepted that. As it happens, the child was born on\nJune the Ist so it was very sensible of me to stay home. Those 3 months were exhilarating\nand exhausting. And then I settled down for the first time since I had become a Rabbi to\nbe a Rabbi. I accepted a position at our seminary to teach and to get my doctorate and we\nmoved to Cincinnati and became people for the first time. No longer did our son Michael\nget into a pullman berth and say, \"Home,\" which he had done a number of times when he\nwas 2 years old and traveling constantly. I'm done. Finished.",
