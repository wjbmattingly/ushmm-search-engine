        "Q: Can we begin by your stating your name, your date of birth and where you were born?",
        "A: Okay. My name is Michel Reynders, R-E-Y-N-D-E-R-S. Date of birth, June 29, 1931. Born\nin a suburb of Brussels, Belgium. Called Uccle, U-C-C-L-E.",
        "Q: Tell me a little bit about your family life before the war.",
        "A: My family on my father's side is a large family. My grandfather was a physician in one of the\nboroughs, if you want, of Brussels. They had eight children, my grandparents had eight\nchildren. My grandmother was, as we say, the strong woman of the Gospel. She was leading\nand reigning over that family like a headmistress. But, she was a very, very wonderful lady.\nMy parents, my father was a physician. My mother was a housewife. They met when my\nfather was a young doctor and their first encounter was actually when my mother was on the\noperating table when she had appendicitis. Then they got married in 1930 and I was born in\n1931. Ihave a brother, a sister who was born in 1935 and a brother who was born in 1938.\nAnd we had, we lived in a very nice house in Brussels which to me remains the epitome of a\nnice family house. My grandmother's house was also a very nice one. And we very\nfrequently met our cousins and uncles and all of that, the whole family, in her apartment in\nthat big house. Actually, we had a sort of a little reunion of the cousins who were around\npractically every week. Every Tuesday. And we gathered around the big table with sweets,\ncookies and breads and you would call them danish, but we didn't call them that. Then in\n1938, my parents bought another house which I didn't like and I never did like it. Even\nthough we lived in it for a long time. And, well, shall I tell you about our, the things we did\nfor entertainment?",
        "Q: Yes, but just one moment, please. Are you hearing the clock? Well, what I'm trying to get a\nsense of, of course, is your lifestyle, what was disrupted because, clearly, in 1940, things\nchanged.",
        "A: Oh, absolutely, yes.",
        "Q: And also a sense of your religious affiliation, all of that.",
        "A: Well, my, on my mother's side, let's say they were, theoretical Catholics. On my father's side,\nthey were very devout Catholics. Everybody went to church on Sunday, every Sunday. And\nto confession a few times a year. Just to get the load off their chest, I suppose. On my\nmother's side, they were the type of Catholics who went to church for a baptism, wedding\nand funeral. My, on my father's side, my grandmother was a practical religious person. She\ndidn't go for, you know, a lot of babbling and all that sort of thing. But, she thought religion\nshould be applied to your day-to-day life in a practical way. In other words, you know, it, she\ndidn't believe much in kneeling on bench and then going like this and so on. She said, do this\nthing right because that's the way God wants you to do it. And do that thing night and, you\nknow, you'll be rewarded in your other life. And, you know, she wanted to make religion a\nreal part of their, of her life and our lives. And she actually didn't spend all that much time,\nwell, just one, she, you know, didn't spend all that much time in church and that's the whole\nthing. Just because, as I say, she was much more of a pragmatic person. Very interesting\nlady, as a matter of fact. What else can I say? Well, we celebrated, of course, all the religious\nholidays in a very extensive way. Mostly, Christmas and Easter. But, you may know or not\nknow, that in Belgium, in addition to Christmas, the children celebrate St. Nicholas and that\nwas the big event for the children before World War II. We would all gather to, first in our\nown homes and then later to grandmother's home, and get all the toys and candies. That\nwould make us sick for two weeks. But they were delightful anyway. And we would\nsometimes go to the seaside. In fact, quite frequently. And the whole family would also meet\nthere. We wouldn't always stay in the same place, but since, you know, the Belgian sea coast\nis very small, it was always easy to go from one village to the other. And we would have big\npicnics and that sort of thing. We were a very closely knit family.",
        "Q: Now, there were other people, other relatives of yours, who were very involved with the\nCatholic church, yes?",
        "A: Yeah. My uncle, Father Bruno(ph), was a Benedictine Monk and he had three sisters, my\nthree aunts, who were nuns. Two of them were Benedictine Nuns in Liesch(ph), Belgium.\nThe third one was a Sister of Notre Dame, which is a teaching order. And she was, she\nmoved to various convents during her life. She is currently alive and well in Namure(ph),\nBelgium. She is 88 years old, almost 89. And clear as a bell, sharp as a tack. And she\nparticipated in Father Bruno's work quite a bit, too. As did the other sisters, who are now\ndeceased.",
        "Q: Did you go to religious school or to public school.",
        "A: No, it was traditional...\nPause in tape.",
        "Q: I was asking you if went to public or religious school.",
        "A: We went to religious schools. We, in Belgium, the diocese or, you know, the lay, not the lay,\nbut the nun, monastic schools, are called colleges. It has nothing to do with American\ncollege. You're in college from your first grade on. Until your 12th grade. So, yes, I did go\nto, first to a small school where the nuns were running the school and I was very privileged\nin having a very, very demanding, if you want, but very charming nun as a kindergarten\nteacher, and I've never forgot her. I still remember her as being a real guidance. And then I\nwent to the college, St. Bonefas(ph) in Brussels. Where my father had been, where my\nuncles had been. And it was almost a family tradition already. Still in existence now. And, in\nfact, my brother was there, too. And my, one of my cousins, oh, several of my cousins,\nactually, went through the same school. It was a very, very wonderful school. I had the best\nteachers you can imagine. And, you know, everybody keeps telling me, didn't you hate\nschool? No, I loved school. I just adored my teachers. In the seventh grade I had a very tall,\nvery powerful looking priest as a teacher. And I can still hear him talking. He was\nextraordinary. He made us live Julius Caesar's wars. Like you'd see a movie. And a couple of\nthree years later I had another teacher who was a strong, sturdy peasant from the Belgian\nAlden(ph), the south of Belgtum where the forests are and those people have their feet on the\nground. Solidly on the ground, and he did, too. And, again, I have such extraordinary\nmemories from my high school, you know, that I still relive them constantly.",
        "Q: Because you came from a family that at least was partly quite religious and you went to\nreligious schools, were there certain values that were instilled in you from an early age?",
        "A: Oh, absolutely. Oh, yes. As I told you, my grandmother was running the house even from a\ndistance, she was still running her children. Her children's houses with her strong principles\nthat, you know, of charity, of tolerance. Even though she was strict, she was tolerant. You\nknow, it sounds like a contradiction, but it really wasn't. She was strict in her tolerance, you\nsee what I mean? You, she thought you had to force yourself to be tolerant, even if you\ncouldn't feel 1t immediately. You just had to do it. And that was one of the principles that she\ninoculated into us from our very, very small childhood. And I think my, all my uncles and\naunts, and my father as well, have always lived by those principles. So, yes, mostly Christian\nvalues. And, you know, people keep asking me, but what did you think about the other non-\nChristian people? Like the Jews and so on. We didn't know anything. In Belgium, you didn't\nmake that distinction. I didn't know that we had Jewish neighbors where I lived until the SS\ncame and took them away. We were friends with them, we played in the park together. We,\nyou know, Belgium was not at all a discriminatory country or discriminating country. I'm\nbringing that up because I read not too long ago that when you immigrate to the United\nStates, you have to say, Iam Jewish. There is no such thing in Belgium. The identity cards\nthat were issued never, never mentioned race, religion or anything like that. It mentioned\nprofession, job, that they did. But it never mentioned anything that had the slightest hint of\ndiscriminatory inkling, if I may say. So, yes, we were, as I said, as you said and I said, high\nvalues were always proposed, if you want, by my parents and my grandparents and that\nincluded that, you know, that we accepted everybody as they were. Not because they had red\nhair or black eyes or dark skin or whatever. But, because they were just people. I think that is\nof extreme importance for what is going to follow.",
        "Q: Were you aware of anti-Semitism in Belgium at all?",
        "A: No, I was not. I'm sure there was a little, but not anywhere nearly as much as in France, for\nexample. France has always, for some reason, cultivated a certain ultra-right philosophy, if\nyou want. Which was definitely anti-Semitic. We didn't have that. Actually, it's to the point\nthat we were never able to tell exactly how many Jews lived in Belgium. Because we had no\nway of knowing. We had no records.",
        "Q: Were you, as a kid, involved with any social or political organizations?",
        "A: Not a political organization. I did, I was, first of all, I was a cub scout for awhile. In Belgium\nwe had, we did have, just after saying there was no discrimination, I have to say that there\nwere the public school cub scouts and the Christian cub scouts. They were friendly, but they\nwere different. I was part of the Christian cub scouts. Then, let's see now, I, yes, I think I was\npart of a small social group where we went to see puppet shows and that sort of things. But,\nit didn't amount to very much. Essentially, cub scouts and later on scouts, was my group\nactivity, let's say.",
        "Q: And, your family, while they believed very strongly in charity, was that ever on any\norganized basis before the war?",
        "A: My grandmother had a route, if you want to say, or route where she went and distributed\nfood on a certain day every month. Part of the St. Vincent DePaul general organization,\nwhich exists in France and exists in Belgium. And it consists of lay people who just get\ntogether and sort of, quote, unquote, adopt a few families. They visit them, and I think this is\nstill being done, I'm not sure, but I think so. Right now. They bring them food or clothes and\ntry to help them if they have difficulty with the welfare system and things like that. That was,\nin a way, organized, if you want. Oh, yes, my mother, actually, was part of the nationwide\norganization for the blind. And, yes, she did, she was, in fact, one of the board members of\nthat for quite some time. And the same thing occurred there, they would have poor blind\npeople assigned to them, if you want, to be visited and comforted and supplies brought as\nnecessary.",
        "Q: One other question. What kind of a child were you? If you had to sort of describe your\nenergy, your...",
        "A: I was, mine was to be very ornery, I'm sure. But, forgive me if I sound like I'm bragging, but\nI do remember that people were telling my parents, oh, he's well mannered, that child. So, I\nguess my mother was very, very proper and she came from a rather proper family and she\nwanted us to have good manners and that sort of thing. I think she taught me good social\nbehavior and, but other than that, I think I was very ornery. I was running up and down and\ndoing things and when my little sister was born, and we did very lots of very strange things.\nLike making mud pies and throwing them at each other. And one day my aunt visited us and\nmy mother just showed her out to the door and while they were gone, we decided to sample\nthe port wine which my aunt and my mother had sampled before and I never understood why\nthe house was spinning so much around me. And my little sister fell asleep and we woke up\nthe next day, I think it must have been with a headache, but I don't remember that for sure. In\nschool, as I say, I enjoyed school enormously. And, so it wasn't a chore, it wasn't a burden\nfor me to go to school. So, I studied with great pleasure and I guess I managed to have pretty\ndecent grades. That way. It wasn't any, you know, great effort. I didn't really force myself, I\njust studied because I thought it was fun. And particularly the literary branches, such as\nLatin, Greek. And during the war later on, German and English languages, to me were\nsomething where I literally basked in learning those.",
        "Q: What do you remember about your Uncle Bruno before the war?",
        "A: Well, we saw him very frequently because unlike most Benedictine Monks, he was not\nalways cloistered. In fact, he dubbed himself the most mobile Benedictine in Belgium. Even\nbefore the war. He taught catechism at the Belgian border to Nazi, no, I mean, non-Nazi\nchildren who would cross the border before World War II to learn catechism because it was\nforbidden in Germany and under Hitler. He went to Czechoslovakia during the sad events of\n1938 and so on. And he was frequently a visitor, a quick visitor, it was just come in and out\nfor, you know, an hour or two and I still have someplace, some pictures of me on his knee\nwhere he made me jump on his knee. And I liked him very, very much. He was the image of\nperfection to me. He was almost a semi-god. I had an excellent relationship with him and I\nkept that relation throughout until his death. Unfortunately, when I was here I didn't see him\nas much as I wanted to. But, I had an excellent relationship with him. He was a very warm,\noutgoing person, very funny, too. He told the funniest stories and had a great sense of humor.",
        "Q: What did you know about Hitler and Nazism before Belgium was occupied? Did you know\nmuch...",
        "A: Hardly anything.",
        "Q: ...German refugees coming in?",
        "A: We saw a few. And, as a matter of fact, this is not Hitler it's Mussolini, in 1938, my parents\ntook in a young Italian girl, about 14 or 15, to be our babysitter. Because her parents, her\nfather was an active Socialist and had to leave Italy under the Fascist regime, and fled to\nBelgium. And, just as an aside, I absolutely adored that lady and I lost track of her\ncompletely until 1986. I decided, I've got to find her again. So, I wrote a letter to the mayor\nof her town asking, 1s this lady still alive? Does she live 1n that town? I didn't get an answer\nfor about six months, but one day I got a letter from her. So, obviously, the mayor had passed\non the letter to her. She wrote me and said, I remember you as if 1t was yesterday. I went to\nsee her in Asti(ph) in the north of Italy. She came here. And we're still writing to each other\nevery month and the most adorable lady. So, that's one thing I did know. About Fascism. As\nyou Say, we did see a few, yes, a few refugees, but, you know, until 19, well, in 1940, I was\njust nine years old and at that time, I don't think I understood the full impact. But, you grow\nvery rapidly in a war, you know. It didn't take us more than a couple of years before we had\nit all assimilated and we understood what was going on. Well, not everything, but nobody\nelse did. But, we understood, I think, far more than we would have if we hadn't been\noccupied.",
        "Q: What do you remember about the German occupation? How it began? What were you\ndoing?",
        "A: 1940, May 10, 4:00 in the morning, my father came and shook me and said, boy, let's go to\nthe basement, it's war. And I heard anti-aircraft cannons, I heard airplanes flying overhead.\nAnd then we heard some bombs falling. Brussels wasn't severely bombed, but the Germans\ndid bomb Brussels the first day of the war. I guess, more as a scare tactic than actual, you\nknow, aim at destruction. And I remember that as if 1t was yesterday. And from then on, just\nabout everything that occurred during the occupation 1s in my computer. And it comes back\nwhen, you know, when I think about it. I remember being a very bad boy. Stealing my\nmother's very scarce sugar and putting it into the gas tanks of the German trucks that were\nparked in the street in the front of my school. We were a little group of kids and one of them\nwould be watching the sentry and he was going up the street, we would immediately go and\nunscrew the caps and pour the sugar in there. And, you know, that gums up the engines,\nmakes a mess of the engine. And I remember being kicked in the rear end by a couple of\nFemp(ph) Polezei(ph) who were searching us and, I guess, as I say, I must have been ornery\nbecause I probably talked back to him and he really, I can still feel the pain. And one time I\nwas on a Street car and there was, unfortunately, there were a few traitors as you know, in all\nthe occupied countries, including Belgtum. And it was the 21st of July, which is a Belgian\nnational day, and I was carrying a little black, yellow and red flag, which is the Belgian\ncolors, in my lapel. Very obvious. And one of those traitors came up on the street car and\nsaid, why do you have that on your lapel? And I said, why do you have it on that, I'm not\ngoing to say the word, but thats uniform that you're wearing? And he slapped me in the\nface and I fell out of the street car. I almost got killed by it, but I wasn't really injured. But, I\nthink the traitors were worse sometimes than the actual Germans. I couldn't stand his\narrogance, and I talked back, I must have been about 13 at that time. And, as I say, you learn\nvery fast during the war. And you learn things you maybe you shouldn't be learning, like bad\nwords and that sort of thing. But, yeah, I remember the occupation extremely vividly for\nsome reason. Maybe a half a block from where we were was a, one of the rare skyscrapers in\nBrussels and there lived three German generals there. And I remember very well going to\nschool and seeing those gentlemen, quote unquote, come down the steps there with their\ngreen capes that were lined in red, you know? Very, very flashy. Those were probably too\nimpressive for me to insult because for some reason, even an enemy general is still a general,\nI suppose, you don't say bad things to a general. But, I remember that as if it were yesterday.\nIt's something that stays with you.",
        "Q: Was their presence ominous?",
        "A: Yes. Yes. We had the same reflex that the Germans had in Germany under Hitler's day that\nalways look behind us to see if we weren't being followed. And, yeah, the presence was\nheavy. And they made their presence known. Like, every Saturday, they had a victory\nparade. Every Saturday. A victory parade in the streets of Brussels. And they would parade\nin front of the royal palace and then stop there and have a band concert. And they were pretty\nobvious. As I say, on the street cars, you had to be careful what you said because there were\nalways some ears that shouldn't hear what you were saying. Oh, I remember, for example,\none day I was, that was probably toward the end of the war, must have been '44, I was\nstanding on the platform there and a man was seated inside reading a newspaper and the\nstreet car stopped and the Germans came aboard and started searching people. And\neverybody had to put their hands up. And this man very, very casually, very quietly, took a\npistol out of his inside pocket, put it in his newspaper and went like this. The Germans\nsearched him but didn't look inside his newspaper. And he was never found out. But, you\nknow, you had to be very careful of what you said and what you didn't say.",
        "Q: Change the tape?\nEnd of Tape #1\nTape #2",
        "Q: Is this, I think my angle...Oh, yeah, that does make a big difference. I think he's, he's just sort\nof...",
        "A: Are you all right?",
        "Q: I want to learn more about how, what?",
        "A: Is he ready? Okay.",
        "Q: I want to get a better picture of what life was like once the Germans came into Belgium.\nHow your life, personally, changed.",
        "A: Well, the first few months, there really weren't that many changes. Because they tried to go\neasy. And, as I said to you previously, we had a military governor. We did not have a\nGolighter(ph). We didn't have an SS general at that time. We only had one general who was\nan anti-Nazi. General Alexander from Falkenhausen(ph). Who was an old Prussian aristocrat\nwho actually was pretty friendly to the Belgians. So, the first few months were not all that\nbad actually. Except for the obvious presence of the German army. The parades and all that\nsort of things. And, of course, the rationing. The scarcity of essentials. Which, actually,\nbecame much, much worse as of probably 1943. In 1940 and 1941, I can't say that we were\nthat miserable. But in 1942, then Berlin realized that the military governor was not being\nstrong enough, was not being harsh enough. And we received then, an SS man who sort of\ntook over the, quote, political aspect. In other words, diminishing all the powers of the army\nwhich in itself wasn't all that bad. That's when things began to change very drastically. The\nday-to-day life for us became pretty difficult as far as food is concerned. Various supplies.\nThere was no gasoline for my father's little car which he kept, as a doctor was able to keep.\nBut there was no fuel for it so that didn't do much good. And things like that. And then, we\nbegan to see things changing even more drastically. That's when we saw people being taken\naway. We hadn't quite yet realized why they were taken away. We thought maybe they had\ndone some bad things. And were being put in jail for that. And then, pretty quickly, it\nbecame obvious that they were mostly Jewish people, as well as Belgians who had either\nsomething to do with the Resistance or simply hostages. People who were not Jewish that\nhadn't really done anything bad, were taken as hostages in reprisal for various acts of\nresistance and that sort of thing. Or for having hidden resistance or people who were\nresistant to the forced labor that, of course, was imposed. That's another thing that didn't\ncome immediately. Forced labor. Young people taken to Germany forcibly to work. Not\nnecessarily to concentration camps, but to factories and that sort of thing. Being paid a\nmeasly salary and living in squalor and terrible conditions. And, of course, it didn't take long\nbefore the young people understood what was going on and they went into hiding. Electricity\nbecame limited. We would have power cut off after, say, 8:00 at night. Curfews, of course.\nThat began pretty early in the war. Curfews were established, but they weren't strictly\nenforced. Again, it was still the army at that time. But, as soon as the SS and Gestapo police\ncame, those things were strictly enforced. And if you were out in the street at 8:30, you\nimmediately went to jail. You know, not just getting a ticket or something. You were taken\nto jail. And, the trains were limited. There was hardly any coal for the locomotives. Except\nfor the German transports. And then I saw, with my own eyes, the first Jewish transports that\nI ever saw, at the end of 1942. At first I didn't realize what was going on. But, I saw lots of\npeople being packed in, they weren't yet using cattle cars. They were using very old third\nclass cars with, which were boarded, the windows were boarded up. And, but the people\nwere still sitting on benches. They weren't yet packed 100 or 120 in a cattle car. But, I saw\nthem because there was a railroad station only about three or four blocks from my house.\nAnd the tracks were down and so you could see from a little wall and there were iron gates,\nif you want, you could see through the gates what was going on down there. And I saw this\ntrain where people were pushed in with little package or suitcase or bundle of some sort.\nAnd then I was told by somebody who worked there, you know, who these are? No. Well,\nthese are Jewish people that are taken to Germany. That's the first time I ever saw a\ntransport. And I remember that as if it was yesterday. What else? Well, of course, the city\nwas down completely as far as activity is concerned. There were some movie theaters\nplaying German movies and propaganda, of course. All English or American or French\nmovies were outlawed. I don't think I ever went to a real movie until 1944. When, just after\nthe liberation. My father just didn't want us to go to, to go see that thing. Then after World\nWar II, interestingly enough, I was able to see a number of those propaganda movies, but\nthat's neither here nor there. During the war, there were no candies, you know, for kids that\nwas important. Chocolate was still being made, but taken by the German army, most of it. As\nI say, the food was tolerably abundant for the first two years, but then after 1942, things\nbegan to go very badly. We probably, we had a loaf of bread for the five of us for a day or\ntwo. Sometimes maybe twice a week. Meat was rarely, rarely available. We were extremely\nlucky in Belgium that, almost been called a miracle, in 1943, because for some reason, an\nenormous bank of herring began to swim right off the Belgian coast. Within a mile or so.\nThe fishing boats were allowed two lines, so they were allowed to go and fish those herring.\nAnd for about six months that sustained the Belgian people as far as protein is concerned.\nAnd I still remember my poor mother, you know, getting up at 4:00 in the morning, waiting\nuntil 10:00 or 11:00 in line, standing there. Sometimes I went with her when I wasn't in\nschool. And getting two or three measly herrings, but at least we had that. My mother had to\nlearn close to 100 different recipes so we would still eat those because after you've had\nherring every day for six months, you just don't want to ever see another herring in your life.\nBut it saved us.",
        "Q: What about school?",
        "A: School, at first there was no school for a few months. But it started again in September. You\nknow, the war began in May, it started again in September. And the first year it was school\nas usual. But then it didn't take long before all the books were censored and only the Nazi\ncontrolled versions were allowed. We were, that was mostly in high school later on. But, we\nwere allowed to learn English after we had learned German first. It sounded awful at the\ntime, but in a way it was blessing in disguise, because when I finished high school and all\nmy classmates the same way, we could speak Latin, Greek, French, Flemish, German and\nEnglish. Which has served me well, you know, later in my life. So, I guess I owe that to the\nNazis. But, I'm not grateful.",
        "Q: You've spoken about some of the ways in which your life was changed by the occupation.\nWere you aware of the different kinds of restrictions on Jewish people?",
        "A: As I say, after 1942, we began to realize what was going on. And we saw some of our\nfriends being taken away. And then it dawned upon us, oh, that's why they're, you know,\nthey're taken away. Because they are Jewish. As I told you before, we didn't even have an\ninkling before World War II. We didn't ask the people which, you know, where do you go?\nDo you go to a synagogue or do you go to a Catholic church or anything. If they went to a\nCatholic church, we would see them because they would go to the same one we did. But, the\nother people who were not in our church, we didn't ask them what they did or where they\nwent or what, and you know, if they had no religion at all, so what, that was fine, you know.\nYeah, we began to see and I have somewhere in my file, I have a picture of a transport taken\nby a friend of my father's who was a doctor, too, from his office window which was just\nabove the building where they took the people. So he took a picture, this was obviously\nforbidden, but he did anyway. They didn't catch him. We still have that picture.",
        "Q: Were they wearing the yellow star?",
        "A: Yeah. As of 1942, we began to see the yellow stars. And, of course, at that time, it became\nquite obvious. Then in the center of the city, for example, Jews were not allowed to walk on\nthe sidewalk. I have a picture of that, too. They were forced to walk in the gutter. And when\nit was dry it didn't matter that much, except it was humiliating. But when it was raining they\nhad their feet in the water which wasn't all that pleasant, particularly during the war when we\ndidn't have any good shoes anyway. Many shoes were made out of cardboard and they\nwould just fall apart in that water. If that had been the only misery, I suppose they might\nhave survived it, even though resenting it. But, that was only the beginning. The yellow star,\nthere were a number of people who in the street car, would ostentatiously get up and give\ntheir seat to a person wearing a yellow star. Particularly if there were German officers or\nGerman soldiers on the street car at that time. They would deliberately show, you know, say,\nplease take my seat. I wouldn't say everybody did that, but there were people who did it. I've\nseen it happen.",
        "Q: What was the reaction from the Germans?",
        "A: Very quiet. They wouldn't do anything. You know, actually, the individual German,\nparticularly the army people, were rather, I wouldn't say scared, but they weren't particularly\nageressive when alone. As I said before, the, this traitor there was probably more aggressive\nthan the German army people. Now, I'm not talking about the SS. But we didn't see the SS\nall that much. They were always in cars. They hardly ever were on foot. The people on foot\nwere mostly the soldiers and they were sort of well restrained in their attitudes, except when\nthey were asked to do a search. And, you know, to line people up against a wall and search\nthem and that sort of thing, which is how I got my kick in the butt. In general, the population\nwas very understanding and sympathetic. Now, there were a few bad ones. And I'm not\ngoing to deny that. I'm not proud of it. Nobody is. But, 1t wasn't as bad as in France. I can\nassure you of that. We could see that a number of shops where we had been shopping\nregularly for either food or clothes or that sort of thing, were closed. There was nobody there\nany more. And, actually, the Germans did not, as much as they did in their own country, take\nover the Jewish businesses.",
        "Q: So, you were telling me about the general climate.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And you said that most of the Belgian public was supportive of, I guess, the Jewish\npopulation?",
        "A: Yeah. And, as a matter of fact, anything that had to do with being against the Bosch(ph), as\nwe said, you know, was in favor of most of the Belgian population at that time. They, you\nwill hear people say that, oh, there were some very bad people and, as I said, it's true, the\nlargest newspaper in Brussels was actually Nazi controlled completely. But, interestingly\nenough, it was Jewish owned. But the owner went to England, so the paper was taken over\nby pro-Nazi people. The other large, the other two largest papers, the Socialist one and the\nCatholic ones, just shut down. They didn't publish any more. So the only paper we really had\nwas Neswah(ph) which is the evening, although it was published in the morning. Which was\nNazi controlled entirely. Interestingly, a little anecdote, on the 21st of July, I think it was in\n1943, which is the national day of Belgium, there was a false Swah(ph) distributed which\nhad been printed and put out by the resistance. And, at first, it was so well made that people\ndidn't realize it was not the real one. And they just took it and then you could see the people\npicking up the paper and their jaws dropping because all the things that were said there, you\nknow. We shall win and we'll crush the Bosch and naming all the traitors and that sort of\nthing, and people started reading and reading and sometimes giggling because some funny\nstories were written in there, too. And that was a day of levity during World War II when the\nentire city of Brussels was covered with Neswah, but not the real one. Which was, of course,\nmuch more real than the Nazi controlled one.",
        "Q: You speak of the resistance. How apparent was it?",
        "A: It became fairly, for me, it became fairly apparent because right in my house we had a\nhousekeeper who worked as a concierge(ph) 1f you want, cleaned the entrance hallway\nwhere my father's patients would come because in Europe, many doctors had their office in\ntheir house, it was very common. And so did my father. And her son was a career soldier in\nthe Belgian Army, was taken war prisoner, and when he came back, immediately joined one\nof the earliest resistant movements and it was impossible for her to hide it from her, from us,\nbecause he had to come home occasionally to get, you know, clothes and that sort of thing\nand he would come at night, sometimes after the curfew, but he never got caught there. So, I\nbecame quickly aware that there was something going on. And so did my sister and brother\nwho were much younger than I, but they knew, oh, Roger was here again. Roger, Roger.\nYeah, Roger was in the resistance and well, actually, Roger had a little brother who was\nexactly my age and slept on the third floor and at 4:00 one night, my mother came and shook\nme and said, hurry up, open the back windows and hurry up, the Germans are at the door.\nAnd Roger was in the house at that time with his brother, sleeping in the same bed. Which\nwas, of course, on purpose. He immediately ran out the roof windows, you know those roof\nwindows in Europe where you can lift like a trap, the window, and he ran out that way and\nwas able to escape and the Germans came and found the little brother in the warm bed, but,\nyou know, they had no way of telling there was another guy there. So, they searched the\nhouse, these were SS, it was Gestapo, actually. And they searched the house, didn't find\nanything, they were very careful not to leave any traces of his passage. And after that, he\nnever came home again. It must have been later in the war, 1t must have been 1943 or\nsomething like that. And, so we were quite aware of a resistance movement. I don't think we\nmade any distinction between the Jewish resistance and non-Jewish resistance. That\nprobably would have been a little too complicated for us to understand at that time. But then,\nwhen my uncle, when Father Bruno came into the picture, and that was late 1942 or early\n'43, for me, then we began to see things quite differently. We, he didn't say anything, you\nknow, he was very, very quiet and never said a word. He never said, I am helping Jewish\nchildren escape. But, after two or three or five had gone through my other uncle's house, and\nI was there quite often, you know, you can be 13 and still think, you know? And at that\npoint, I realized things were going on that were not at all, quote, normal. And I didn't say\nanything, but you put two and two together at age 12 or 13, just as you can when you're an\nadult. And it's from that time on that my uncle, Father Bruno, became perhaps less secretive\nwith me. I was one of the oldest nephews and I was, by far, the one he was closest to. And so\nhe became less secretive in the sense that he would give me a letter to take to a place or there\nwould be a child I had never seen and he said, oh, this is a friend of mine and his name is\nRobert, maybe his name was Abraham, I don't know. But, and, do you know where such and\nsuch street is? Yes, I do. Well, why don't you take the street car and go to such and such\nhouse there and tell them that Robert is looking for a place to stay. And that's all he ever\nsaid. You know, he never said, Robert is Jewish. And Robert always had a war name, a\ndifferent name. One of the kids that I knew particularly well, is alive and well and we called\nhim Roger. Roger Dumois(ph). And I actually lived with him, more or less, for at least six\nmonths. In my other uncle's house, my younger uncle, the dentist. Jean(ph), who worked in\nvery close cooperation with Father Bruno. That was my grandmother's house and he was the\nonly child of my grandmother's who stayed in the family home after he was married because\nhe occupied my grandfather's medical office as a dentist. So he didn't have to look for\nanother place and my grandmother just took the upper floor for herself. And so, the kids\nwere brought there frequently. I, one day I entered without warning into my grandmother's\napartment and there were eight kids sitting, seated there on eight chairs, she had a lot of\nchairs because she had a lot of children. Each of them had a glass of milk in his hand and, of\ncourse, I immediately put two and two together but nobody said anything. She says, Oh,\nwe're just having a little party. And there were eight Jewish kids. One of whom stayed and, it\nwas a funny incident because he was playing with matches and almost set fire to my\ngrandmother's curtains. But she got the fire under control pretty rapidly. But, this is how I,\nyou know, I realized what was going on. And then my uncle Bruno, Henry, Henry was his\nreal name. Father Bruno was his religion name, would come in civilian clothes. I had never\nseen him in civilian clothes, couldn't understand why he was doing that. But, after a while, of\ncourse, we realized he had to because the Germans were after him. And he had a bicycle and\nhe would occasionally ring the bell quite late at night and hide his bicycle inside and\ndisappear in the middle of the night while we were, I frequently slept at my younger uncle's\nhouse because he had a, there was a better heating system in his house than in my parent's\nsecond house, which I didn't like anyway. And, so I did get to see quite a number of the\nproteges, as my uncle used to call them. And, okay, what else?",
        "Q: Well, since you mentioned this boy that you actually lived with for quite some time, this\nJewish boy, I'm just curious if you, what it was like. Was he scared? Did you talk about\nthings?",
        "A: I must honestly say that life went on pretty normally. There was a feeling of security in that\nhouse. I don't know why. Everybody felt pretty safe and secure in that house. He went to\nschool with me to the College , of course, where else? It happens that that\nschool is only about three or four blocks away from my grandparent's house, which 1s the\nmain reason why everybody went there. And so we went to school together and sometimes\nwe didn't see each other during the day because we were not in the same class. But, usually\nat 4:00, which was dismissal time, we would wait for each other at the door and just go on\nhome as if nothing had happened, and as if nothing was going on. Jumping like kids do, you\nknow, and kicking a can once in awhile and that sort of thing. And he looked pretty happy.\nIt's only actually towards the very, very end of the war when I think he had an inkling that\nhis parents had disappeared, that he became a little more sad and more, less expansive, less\ntalkative. But, for a good while there, we were just like two old buddies and playing games\nlike you see kids do and doing our homework together and that sort of thing.",
        "Q: Did he talk about what happened to his parents?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Or why he was hiding?",
        "A: No. No. Actually, that was one thing that Father Bruno stressed upon them, to never talk\nabout, never, your name is Joe Blow now, you don't have any parents, you are not Jewish,\nyou are of Flemish descent, and your parents are travelling in France or something like that.\nOr your parents are dead, you know, or something. But, dead from other causes he meant.\nNo, that was one thing he was very, very strong and stern about. Do not ever talk about your\nfamily and things that happened. So, even in my grandmother's house, there was no such\ntalk.\nEnd of tape #2\nTape #3\n..down a little bit, they might be a little...",
        "A: Well, they're already down. No, I don't mean that, I mean, I'm saying you can tip it back a\nlittle.",
        "A: I was going to say, if I point them more down, they'll be... Yeah, I know they were too high.",
        "Q: I just wanted to pick up where we stopped for a moment, because it was at the end of the\ntape.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: You were telling me about this Jewish boy who was hiding at your house.",
        "A: Right. Roger.",
        "Q: Roger. And that while, when he maybe learned more about his family, he became...",
        "A: Sulky, you know.",
        "Q: But I was asking you whether, at any point, you ever talked to him about what was\nhappening?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: What was going on in the war.",
        "A: No. That was a no-no. And it was on specific instructions by Father Bruno to not talk about\nevents surrounding the children. Any child that was under his protection, 1f you want to say.\nIt just was too risky. You know, one unfortunate word and it could have caused the death,\nnot only of the child, but everybody around the child. So, no. As little talk as possible. How\ndo you say that? The enemy has ears everywhere? Or something like that. We were very\naware of that. And at that time, when I began to work a little closer to Father Bruno, I was\nalready, well, a young teenager at that time, I was mostly, well almost 13 and 13, and I began\nto understand, you just don't talk about things of importance during the war. Now, on the\ncontrary, we had a little club, if you want, of school kids, we thought of ourselves as very\nimportant. And we had a club which was our resistance club. It didn't do much resistance,\nbut we were organized as a military club. There was a colonel and there was a couple of\nmajors and a couple of captains and if you did well, 1f you, for example, you could report on\nseeing so many German trucks going by, then you got promoted. And if you had counted\nhow many B-17's are flying over our heads, then you got a promotion or a decoration or a\ncommendation of some sort. We had to know by heart, all the types of aircraft, enemy or\nfriendly, and we had exams given by the colonel, you know, and that sort of thing. It didn't\namount to anything, it was just games, but to give you the spirit of the war. You know. And\nwe would hide in the, somebody's basement so the Germans wouldn't hear us. It was very\nsecret. That was mostly, actually, before 1943, I think. When I was still a little more\ninnocent.",
        "Q: Did you every do any little, you mentioned putting the sugar in the gas tanks...",
        "A: Yeah. That was part of our assignments. If we did that, that was a great big promotion\nbecause, if you did that, you know, you took a bad risk. And you could be promoted from\nsecond lieutenant all the way to major for doing that. Yeah. And when my mother found out\nabout that, was she every unhappy. Not so much for the sugar, but for the risk I was taking.\nAnd even though these were not SS, I'm sure if they had caught us, they would have\ndefinitely called our parents, maybe put our parents in jail, and that sort of thing.",
        "Q: Were there other little sabotage activities?",
        "A: Well, yeah, flat tires and things like that. For some reason, a truck would suddenly develop a\nflat tire. I had a couple of friends who were specialists of that, they would have a little stick\nof wood and put that in the, what do you call this valve, you know? Where they inflate the\ntire? Push it in and there's a little peg in there that if you push it in, the air goes out. So, when\nnobody was looking, he would just push a little piece of wood in there and slowly the air\nwould go out. And the next morning the truck had a flat tire. And, but again, all that didn't\namount to much. But, it's just the spirit, you know. We, it was a spirit of resistance. In our\nchildish way, you know. Go ahead, I'm sorry.",
        "Q: Was that spirit of resistance fairly prevalent in Brussels?",
        "A: Well, I can only speak about my own environment. I would say that in my own environment,\nit was. It was, you know, in World War I, my grandparents had been very, very miserable\nand badly treated by the occupant, so that was still lingering. And, the eight children, except\nperhaps for the last one, had lived through that war with the spirit, let's get rid of the Bosch,\nyou know. And it was still there 25 years later. You just don't get rid of that sort of\nresentment so easily. And, so it wasn't at all difficult for us to pick up because that spirit had\nalready been imparted to us between the wars. You know, when they were telling stories, oh,\ndo you remember so and so? Do you remember when general so and so got beaten by the\nFrench and da, da, da. So, we were living, see Belgium has been occupied by foreign powers\never since Julius Caesar and, you know, Belgians have become, for that reason, exceedingly\nindependent minded people. And it's only since 1830, that Belgium has become a political\nentity of its own, a free, independent country. And then, but we, we have an ancestral\ntradition of hating the occupant. You know, from Julius Caesar to the Franks to the\nSpaniards to the Austrians, the French and then the Germans again. And, yeah, that spirit of\nanti-occupant was very prevalent in my environment. It's difficult for me to judge, you know,\nhow it was in other families. But, the families that we knew were on our side, if I may say.\nWe never, I never, never knew, personally, anyone who was not anti-Nazi. On the contrary,\nmy father had several excellent friends who suffered greatly during the war because of their\nanti-Nazi attitudes and actions. One of them died in a concentration camp, the other one was\nkilled by the SS on the last day of the occupation. He was, they came with a car and started\nshooting blindly around and he got hit by a machine gun bullet and was killed about five\nminutes after my father had said good-bye to him for the day. And then there was the\ngovernor of the national bank who was giving funds to Father Bruno for his children. And\none day, three or four Nazi thugs came and rang his doorbell and said, are you Mr.\nGallopan(ph)? And he said, yes, [machine gun sounds], they just machine gunned him right\non his doorstep, right in front of his wife.",
        "Q: Because of his efforts?",
        "A: Because of his support of the resistance. You know, Father Bruno needed enormous amounts\nof money to be able to feed and clothe his children. And he didn't have anything, of course.\nAnd so, he went to Mr. Gallopan who was a notorious anti-German, even though they had\nleft him as president of the national bank knowing that he was not, he didn't like them. So, he\nwent to this man and this man committed himself to giving him a certain sum of money, I\ndon't remember how much it was, every month. And my other uncle, one of my other uncles\nby marriage, Uncle Jack, was the one who collected the money from the bank every month\nand kept the books. Kept the accounting. And when Mr. Gallopan was killed, someone else\nin the bank honored his promise and they continued to deliver money until the end of the\nwat.",
        "Q: I do want to learn a lot more about this whole rescue effort, but I'd like you to tell me a bit\nmore about what you did. Your involvement.",
        "A: Well, I don't want to, you know, I've never been for self aggrandizement. All I ever did, as I\ntold you in this film before, 1s carry little letters and escort children from one point to the\nother. I was too young to do anything else at that time. So, that was my contribution, if you\nwant, being a messenger.",
        "Q: Do you remember specifically...",
        "A: And also being a school mate, which probably brought a little comfort to Roger, among\nothers.",
        "Q: Do you remember specifics of some of your messengering and escorting?",
        "A: Well, the one picture I keep is my standing on the rear platform of a street car with my arms\nstretched out on the railing, on the back thing, and a Jewish child looking at me with a cap on\nhis head, hiding his dark hair. And my hair was light blond, very light blond, I was a perfect\nAryan. And we were just playing, you know, being silly kids. With my blue eyes and my\nblond hair, the Germans would, there would be a few Germans on the street cars, but they\nwould probably just take one look at me and just, you know, ignore me. And that was one\npicture that I remember very, very well. Another incident was that, at that time, I was\ncarrying a letter, but I was with my aunt, the wife of the dentist. Of Jean, my aunt\nNinette(ph), one of the women I have most loved in my life. And I was there with her and we\nwere trying to find an address, and we couldn't find the house. And at one point, there were\nGermans 1n the street. They weren't looking for us, but she got scared and we ran away. And\nthen she said, you know, I shouldn't have run away because that may give us away. I should\nhave just said, and I said, well, let me go back by myself. They're not going to bother me.\nAnd I went back and I finally did find that house, rang the doorbell and delivered the letter,\nran like heck out of there to find my aunt again. And she was waiting around the corner on a\nbench somewhere. That's, those are two incidents I do remember.",
        "Q: How much did you know about what you were doing?",
        "A: Well, I've been trying to explain that, you know, it grew gradually. At first, we didn't really\nknow what was going on. Certainly not before 1942. And even in 1942, early in the game,\nwe were only sensing something was going on. And it was very important. But, we couldn't\npinpoint what it was. But even at, you know, the ripe old age of 12 or 13, during the war,\nthere are things that you perceive that you would not normally otherwise perceive. And it\ndidn't take very long, as I said I think previously on this tape, that, you know, I put two and\ntwo together and began to realize how important it was. And what was the purpose of all\nthese kids coming and going. And some I would never see again, some I would see again,\nmaybe two or three months later. That would be when a hiding place would be blown for\nexample, you know? Then Father Bruno had to go get the child back. People were talking or\nwhatever. Some unfortunate circumstance had taken place and, well, you know, I have my\nlittle six year old grandson here and I'm amazed at how much a little six year old can\nperceive already. So I'm sure that at 12 or 13, all of us were much more aware than people\nthought we were. Even though Father Bruno never said the word, you know.",
        "Q: So you weren't given much information? You didn't talk about it with your uncles or...",
        "A: No. No. The only thing that was talked to or talked about was where to go put a letter and\nwhere to take a child. That was all. No, no, no. Not at that time. Even though, you know, I'm\nsure that if I had been put under torture, I would have certainly said what I knew. You know,\nat 12 or 13, you don't resist torture, you have to talk. I'm sure I couldn't have withstood\ntorture. It never happened. I was very lucky. But I'm sure I would have given them more\ninformation than everybody else thought I knew. And I had a couple of cousins who were\nabout my age, who knew almost as much as I did, even though they weren't quite so close to\nFather Bruno because they lived in a different house in a different part of Brussels. But\nnevertheless, they weren't fools, they knew what was going on.",
        "Q: You said you were asked to escort some of these kids to hiding places. What kind of places\ndid you take them to?",
        "A: Just families. Just mostly families. Occasionally a convent, or occasionally a school, but\nmost of the time, families. And I cannot be sure of that, but I believe that one time I took a\nchild to this extraordinary lady who helped Father Bruno with at least 50 of the children, and\nwas, never asked for any payment except for her train fare and an occasional lunch. And I\nthink I met her then, but that's a little fuzzy in my mind. I can't be absolutely sure. Mostly,\nthese were families or private persons.",
        "Q: What did you talk about with the kids you were transporting? You were, how did you\ntransport them?",
        "A: On foot or in the street car, public transportation. The street cars were the only public\ntransportation available, there were no busses, no gasoline. And, I think we would just talk\nabout usual kid stuff, you know. School or maybe talk about the people around us. Talking\nabout, you know, games or whatever. I think we would just talk about ordinary things.\nNever, definitely never, about deportation, about camps or all that sort of thing. Of course,\nwe didn't know much about the camps anyway. But, not at that time we didn't, but we would\nnever say, oh, your uncle so and so went away. What happened to him? Never. That was\nforbidden.",
        "Q: Did you have a sense of their fear or trepidation or...",
        "A: Occasionally, some kids were pretty antsy, yeah. Occasionally. Some of them would be kind\nof, you know, looking around and checking to see if they were being followed and so on.\nMostly the older ones, I mean older, I mean 8, 9, 10 year olds. Not a four or five year olds.\nBut, I think that, yeah, some of the older kids were scared, obviously scared.",
        "Q: Did you have to say something to them so they wouldn't give themselves away?",
        "A: Well, we tried to, I don't know, what do you do when somebody's scared? You try to talk\nabout something else, distract them, you know. That's all we could do, you know. Or we\nwould just try to interrupt their train of thought by pointing at something, oh, look at that,\nyou know. Something like that. I had, this had nothing to do with Father Bruno, but I had a\nclassmate whose mother was killed in the bombing, bombing by the Americans, by the way.\nAnd every time there was an air raid, he would literally go into a trance, into hysterics. And\nthere was nothing we could do to, you know, to calm him down. He would just shake all\nover and perspire and moan and he never got over that. He never recovered. In fact, he died\nrather miserably ten years ago or something like that. And, so there were times where you\ncouldn't do anything. But this never actually happened to me with one of kids I was\nescorting. No.",
        "Q: What about the risk to you? Was this exciting? Was this like a big adventure? Or were you a\nlittle bit nervous? I mean, you were taking risks.",
        "A: You're 12, 13 year old. You don't think of risk. You don't think of, you think of it as, you\nthink of it as a new adventure. You think of it as something different, you know, outside of\ngoing to school and doing your homework and going to bed and have breakfast and so on\nand so on. Suddenly, there was something, and you had, you know, sort of a feeling of being\nuseful. Because they were calling upon you to do something. You know. You were no longer\nthe little child playing with his little cars and, toy cars in the corner. You know, you were\npart of the responsibility. So, no. Well, of course, we knew about some, something of the\nrisk. We knew to avoid the Germans as much as possible. But that was even before. I mean,\nwe tried to avoid the Germans, when we saw a group of Germans on the street corner, we\nimmediately changed course and took another street. Even before 1942. We just didn't want\nto, you know, that was, that kind of risk we knew we shouldn't take, we weren't supposed to\ntake a risk by going too close to the enemy. Oh, that's something we acquired immediately.\nAnd our parents certainly re-emphasized that, too. Sure. It's interesting because my first\nexposure with the Nazi military was before World War II and I was in Switzerland with my\nparents in a town that's right at the border, the German border, called Reinfelden(ph). There's\na lovely bridge there. And on one side is a Swiss guard and on the other side is a German\nguard. And I was, I think, seven or eight years old at that time. And, you know, like any kid,\nI ran on the bridge and the Swiss soldier stopped me and said in French, because he'd heard\nwe'd spoke French, he says, don't go there, this guy is bad on the other side. So, the Swiss\ndidn't like the Nazis any more than we did. Even though they spoke German in that area.",
        "Q: Did you, were your activities secret even from your parents?",
        "A: No. No, my parents knew about it. In fact, we had three Jewish people in our house in a row,\nI mean, success, 1n succession. We had first, I think the first one was a Polish girl. Blond,\nPolish girl who was a little ornery. She was a bit difficult. She didn't want to be cooped up.\nAnd, in fact, she left us. To go with a Belgian policeman. The last we heard, she was\nworking as a, I don't know what you call it, a call girl or something in a tavern. Not far from\nour house. Where German officers went. I guess that fact that she was blond and blue eyed\ndidn't tip off the Germans that she was Jewish. Then we had a large German, no, yes,\nGerman woman, but from East Germany. And she was very, very scared. She was very, very\nscared. She stayed with us for about, I think, three months and then Father Bruno came and\ntook her out and took her away. And then we had another woman and she told us all kinds of\nfunny stories. She told us the stories of Laurel and Hardy movies. In French. And on the\nLiberation Day, September 3, 1944, she ran to her room, picked up her suitcase, she only had\none suitcase, packed up, ran out the door and we never saw her again. I don't know what\nhappened to her. She was just so elated she was free again, that she just ran out the door. So\nthat was the last, the last one I ever saw actually.",
        "Q: So a number of, how many? Three.",
        "Q: Okay. A number of people in your families, in your family, hid Jews? Is that what you're\nsaying?",
        "A: Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. The nuns did in their convent in Liesch(ph). The other nun, who was at\nthat time in Brussels, no, no, she was in Schlovese(ph), another small town. That convent\nalso hid a couple of kids. My parents did. My father did surgery on a couple of Jewish kids.\nAnother anecdote. He had a small child who had appendicitis, put him in the open ward\nbecause that's the way hospitals were at that time. Maybe 20 patients in an open ward. And,\nbelieve it or not, a German soldier had a bad car accident right in front of the hospital. So,\ninstead of taking him to the military hospital which was the other side of the city, they took\nhim to my father's ward. So, at one end we had the Jewish child with appendicitis, at the\nother end we had an injured German soldier. But, you know what? It turned out to be a sort\nof a protection. Because this guy was there lying, he was there for at least a week before they\ntransported him to the military hospital, well, there was a constant flow of friends and\nofficers coming to comfort him and bring him candy and flowers and so on and so on. They\nwouldn't pay any attention to the rest of the ward. And there wouldn't be any searches during\nthat time.",
        "Q: I need to stop here because we're really...\nEnd of Tape #3\nTape #4",
        "Q: Are you ready? I'm rolling.",
        "Q: Oh, you are rolling. I just started. Just.",
        "Q: Are there other memories you have of your own personal experiences during the war, you're\nown involvement in trying to help people?",
        "A: Not specifically aimed at Father Bruno's network. More like the general population. Yes. For\nexample, we had a big house and I didn't like the house, but that's neither here nor there, it\nused to belong, a hundred years ago, no a hundred and fifty years ago, to twin brothers who\nwere wine merchants and they had cellars that were two level cellars, like in a sub-basement,\nif you want, basement and sub-basement. All of these were vaulted, almost like a cathedral.\nAnd because of that, we had the visit of the air defense people who came and looked at our\nplace and they said, well, this 1s a pretty safe basement. It can probably resist most of the\nnormal bombs that were available in those days. Would you be willing to open that up to the\npublic? And we did. And so, yes there were numbers of people from our neighborhood who\nwould come during air raids and, actually, it turned out sometimes to be a rather, rather fun.\nBecause they would bring their food and we would share their food and we would share with\nthem our food. And in that cellar, I must tell you, that there were still some bottle of wine.\nAnd I'm sure the neighbors enjoyed those quite a bit. And there was an air intake, a sort of a\ncolumn about a foot and a half in diameter which let the air in and opened up in our back\nyard and I was the air raid signaler. I was in charge of listening if I could hear the airplanes\nand if I did, I would say, they are coming, they are coming. And also to warn them when it\nwas the end of alarm signal, so everybody could go home. That was my duty at that time. So,\nthis is a memory I keep, you know, very vivid. And other than that, well, yeah, distributing\nwhatever little food we had to some other people who had even less. My mother did that, but\nshe did that mostly as part of her duties in that blind people organization. And my great aunt,\nwho was my mother's aunt, was also the president of that same organization. Took me\naround a number of times during the war to help her carry packages and that sort of thing.\nYeah. But that wasn't, you know, was not directly connected to saving the Jewish people.\nThat was mostly just ordinary being nice to people. Oh, I might mention that even though\nmy wife's family had no connection with the Jewish movement, they did hide non-Jewish\nresistance in their attic. That gave rise to a rather hair raising occasion because one of them\nalso got appendicitis, but how are you going to get that guy out of the attic when, you know,\nin a neighborhood where everyone knew everything about everybody. So, what they did,\nthey waited until it was dark, called the ambulance, had my wife's sister climb on the\nstretcher with the guy, covering both of them so that only her head would be visible, put the\nstretcher in the ambulance and took the whole thing to the hospital. So, of course, my sister-\nin-law had to stay away from the house for at least a week because they kept people in the\nhospital for at least a week after appendectomy in those days. And then to bring the man\nback was another thing because at that time he could walk so it wasn't so difficult, but again,\nthey had to be very careful at night. And there was an asthmatic woman living right across,\nbecause those were row houses, and she would always open her window during the night to\ntake a breath of fresh air. And they had to wait until she closed the window before any\nmovement could occur in the street.",
        "Q: Let's get back to your family. Your immediate family. You started to tell me who all was\ninvolved in this rescue operation.",
        "A: Who, well. Father Bruno was the driving force. The leader. He was also the person having\nno children who adamantly said that he was taking all the responsibility on his back.\nWhether that would have served, you know, or helped, I'm not sure because the Nazis were\nsmarter than that. But, at least he said, I want to take all the responsibility and I will have you\nhelp me, but I will never mention you or anything. But he got his mother involved, my\ngrandmother, my father, who was a surgeon. My younger uncle who was a dentist. My uncle\nby marriage who was the finance man. And his three sisters who were nuns. But, that was\nonly a very small part of the network. Because he had to have a lot more help than that. So,\nhe got quite a number of assistants either permanently or occasionally. Some of them were\nJewish, some of them were not. He did all kinds of visits himself to the families where he\nwanted the children to be hidden and in the little book that we wrote there is that famous\nstory of the University professor in Louvan(ph), Belgtum who was a devout Catholic and my\nuncle went to see him and told him all that was happening. And the man said, you know, I\nhonestly am not aware of this. But, my duty as a Christian is to help you. When are you\ngoing to bring me a child? And, you know, that sort of thing, of course, was very comforting\nfor him. He said when he went to Israel after the war, that no one actually shut the door on\nhim. So, he did have a few, well, misadventures where some kid didn't get along with a\nfamily or, particularly, adults sometimes were a little independent and the family would\nconsider them as being servants. And they wouldn't like that. So, there were a few, but I\nwould say not more than five or six such incidents occurred. And the vast majority of the\npeople were just welcoming and opened their arms, you know, and their families to Father\nBruno. But I would say that there were probably more than several hundred people involved\neventually. Because you know, three hundred twenty and maybe more children, we don't\nknow exactly how many there were, Flora thinks, Flora Singer, thinks there was about three\nhundred and fifty. That may be a little too much. We don't know. Because, obviously, for\nsecurity reasons, Father Bruno couldn't keep accurate records during the war. So all the\nrecords he had were little notes he made in a certain code which, after the war, he then\ntransferred to a more elaborate ledger. And so he lost track of a few of them. So we know for\nsure of about three hundred and twenty. And since each child probably had to be moved,\none, two, three, up to five times, well, just count and you'll see that would imply probably\nsomething like a thousand transfers. You know? Not, there were sometimes the same\nfamilies taking different children. But, most of the time they, you know when there was too\nmuch talking or too much something going on that might give it away, he had to find new\nfamilies all the time. And so, his personal network included probably the eight or nine people\nof his family and as many close collaborators or friends as that. Like eight or nine, maybe\nten. Close associates. But, then, you know, there were hundreds of families that were\ninvolved that should not be forgotten or neglected. You know?",
        "Q: How did he get into this? What, I mean, yes, he was a good man, but how did he initially get\ninvolved with this rescue operation?",
        "A: Well, that was sort of a happenstance because he was sent as a chaplain, he was requested to\ncome as a chaplain, in a small school for the blind in the southern part of Belgium called\nHodbomo(ph). And when he got there he discovered that there were some blind children, but\nthat most of the occupants there were Jewish. Including the director. And that, you know, it\njust, he just saw the light immediately. But, he had, in 1938, taken a trip in Germany. I told\nyou that he was a mobile Benedictine and he was in Frankfurt in a busy street and he saw\npeople just haggling and harassing or annoying and pushing someone. And he got closer and\nhe saw an old Jewish man who was dressed like most Orthodox people were with a big black\nhat and caftan and so on and you know what I mean. And they were spitting at him and\npushing him and that absolutely tore him apart. But, obviously, being in Germany, he\ncouldn't do a thing about it. You know? He couldn't go to the rescue of the man. If 1t had\nbeen in Belgium, he probably would have, but not in Germany. And he never forgot that\nincident. And when he got to Hodbomo, that little school for the blind, he said, well, now I\nrealize the full impact of what I saw in Germany and he decided to help. And he didn't help\nbecause they were Jews. He helped because they were people. He said, I don't care if they\nhad been Africans, if they had been Japanese, if they had been Papu(ph), I would have done\nthe same thing. He didn't, perhaps he knew more about the Jews than he did about other\npeople, which made it a little easier for him to understand. But, he was mostly concerned\nabout human beings, about people. And he said, you know, I have to do something to save\nthose people. I don't care what they are, who they are, I have to save those people. They are\noppressed. They are persecuted. My duty, as a Christian, is to help them and try to save them\nif I can. Then, at Hodbomo, he got in contact with Albert Vandenburg(ph) who was a lawyer\nin Liesch(ph) and was the executive director of the camps for sickly and destitute children of\nthe archdiocese of Liesch whose bishop was Bishop Kerkopfs(ph) at that time. And they\nstarted working together and Vandenburg was very happy to find someone like Father Bruno\nwho was, you know, free of family, in a way. Didn't have any children and so on, and was\nwilling to do anything to help. And then, unfortunately, Albert Vandenburg was taken by the\nGestapo. At first for having forged identity cards and that was actually under the jurisdiction\nof the military government. And he was condemned to three months in jail and he was very\nhappy that he didn't have more than that, get more than that. And he got out of jail and the\nGestapo was waiting outside. Took him again. Sent him to Bergen Belsen where he finally,\nwell, nobody exactly knows how or when he died, but he must have died, perhaps even, after\nthe liberation of the camp, of typhus. Which was, at that time and even now actually, is a\ndeadly disease. And so, Father Bruno took over and went on his own and started his network\nby contacting various people. Some of the people he already knew from the camps because\nthey were helpers in the camps and this way he was able to place a few children. But, the\nfirst month I think, he must have had four or five requests in addition to the, oh, I forgot to\nmention that the school became very unsafe because in the village people began talking, I'm\nsure quite innocently, there were no traitors, but they were talking. And talking, as I said, is\nvery dangerous. You know, the enemy has ears everywhere. So, the first thing that Father\nBruno and Albert, who was still alive then, had to do was move the children to other places.\nSo right there, they had 25 kids that they had to get rid of from that school. So they placed\nthose, the early ones, they placed in convents or, again, in the camps. But even that became\nunsafe because, again, people began talking and there were raids and in one of the raids,\nthere were some adults who were also in the camps and they were arrested and sent to\nconcentration camps. One of the adults who was there was the Grand Rabbi of Liesch, by the\nname of Lepkifka(ph). And he escaped but his parents went to and died in concentration\ncamp. And so after the war, he did a lot to publicize the work of Vandenburg and...I'm sorry.",
        "Q: That's okay, let it go.",
        "A: What's up?",
        "Q: It's okay, continue please.",
        "A: Alright. You know, to publicize the work of Vandenburg and, incidentally, of Father Bruno\nas well. They knew each other quite well. As a matter of fact, the sisters who were running\nthe camp were full of praise for the extreme righteousness and religiousness of this rabbi\nwho was very broad minded at the same time. So, that did a lot to smooth any possible\ndifferences that might have occurred under his guidance. And then you, I think you were\nasking me how he got to do that. Well, then people heard about his work and they came with\nrequests, you know. Oh, Mrs. so and so has two children and she would like to place them in\nsafety. And the first month he got maybe four, five or six of them. Eventually after a few\nmonths, I think it was in July of '43, his largest number was, I believe, 24 requests in a\nmonth. That doesn't sound like much, but when you realize that he had to go on his bicycle\nacross Belgium, you know, 24 times to find families to bring papers, to bring food, to bring\nthe child. It was a day and night job. You know, he worked 18 hours a day. And sometimes\nmore. He said after the war that he had crisscrossed Belgrum 40 times the distance that the\nbicycle racers do for the tour of Belgtum now. So, that give you an idea of how much\nbicycling he did.",
        "Q: What was the involvement of the, or support of the Catholic church in Belgium?",
        "A: Well, in Belgium, as opposed to some of the eastern European countries, the majority of the\nCatholic church was helpful. The Cardinal, the Primate of Belgium, Cardinal VanLouie(ph),\nhad directive, if you want, or directions that, to be very cautious. But he did several times,\nissue bulletins saying that, you know, I will not, I will close my eyes if you do this. I will do,\nI will not interfere if you do that. In other words, he was giving them free rein without\nsaying, I want you to save the Jews. Because that would immediately have put him in jail\nright there. And he couldn't do that. And it's the same thing that they said about Pope Pius\nXXII, this is maybe a controversial subject, but I'm very, very positive on that because my\nparents were married by Cardinal Mikar(ph) who became a very good friend of them and he\nbecame the Secretary of State of Pius XXII, and he told my parents and me, specifically, that\nthe Pope was very sympathetic and that according to the records, the Vatican itself saved\naround 20,000 Jewish people. Including the Grand Rabbi of Rome who was at the Vatican\nduring the war. Now there have been many books written and criticizing him a lot because\nhe didn't do enough. But, again, you know, you have to look at this from different angles. It,\nthere is no question that if he had been very, very strong, Hitler was all prepared to invade\nthe Vatican. And take the Pope prisoner. He couldn't have done anything any more at that\ntime. So, in other words, what he did 1n a concealed way, was probably more useful than if\nhe had spoken very loudly and been very outspoken about it. They said he was a friend of\nthe Germans. Yes, that's true. He had been the Ambassador of the Pope in Munich for\nseveral years and he really liked the people of Germany. But, he abhorred Nazism. In fact,\none of his encyclical(ph) letters was directed at the Nazis and condemning it without\nreservation.",
        "Q: One of the reasons I'm asking about Belgium in particular is that as we know in many\ninstances, there was a, there were traditional beliefs about Jewish people as traitors, as Christ\nkillers, as whatever. And the Catholic church was not always as supportive toward helping\nJewish people.",
        "A: Well, you know, let's say that in my environment, it wasn't the case. I cannot speak for all the\nBelgians, but in my environment, it was not the case. And from what I've been reading and\nfrom what I've heard and discussed with other people, this was a lot less prevalent in Holland\nand in Belgium than, for example, in Poland. Because in Poland, even now, there is still a\ngreat hostility between the non-Jews and the Jews. Let's face it. That was not the case in\nBelgium. It was not the case in Holland, either. I want to say here that we never knew\nexactly how many Jews were in Belgium because people were not registered as to their race,\nreligion, creed or anything else. We figure that there were probably, including all the\nrefugees from the east, in 1938, '39 and even early in 1940, there were probably something\nlike 70,000. Only about 30,000 survived. And that was better than Holland. Where only, I\nthink, only maybe 20 or 15 percent survived. So, the Dutch were not as lucky as we were.\nThey had this SS Golighter(ph) from the very beginning and that was very, very dramatic.\nVery sad, tragic.",
        "Q: Let's stop here for a few minutes.\nEnd of Tape #4\nTape #5",
        "Q: In this rescue network of your uncle's, who, was he involved with organizations? Did he get\nhelp or finances from different resistance organizations?",
        "A: As far as administration, you could say it was a one man operation. He did have assistants.\nHe had people helping him find families. He had people taking care of false identification\npapers and that sort of thing. But as far as administration, he was it. He had all the power and\nall the responsibility. As far as finance is concerned, he was a Benedictine Monk, and all his\npossessions were on his body. That is his cassock and maybe his handkerchief and that was\nabout it. He got support from various families who were not willing to take a child, but were\nwilling to contribute. But, of course, the biggest support he got was from the\n. The largest bank in Belgium whose director we called governor in\nthose days. Was Mr. Gallopan, he was fiercely anti-Nazi. And he committed himself to\ncontributing a large amount of money each month to Father Bruno. It may not have been\nquite enough to cover all the expenses, but it was an extremely significant help. Mr.\nGallopan guaranteed those payments monthly and the payments were collected by Jack\nDupon(ph) who was Father Bruno's brother-in-law. Another uncle of mine. And he\ncontinued doing that until the liberation. Unfortunately, poor Mr. Gallopan was a victim of\nNazi thugs who one day came and rang his doorbell and said, are you Mr. Gallopan? And he\nsaid, yes. And they just killed him on the spot with a blast of submachine gun, right in front\nof his wife. But the bank continued honoring his commitment all the way to the end of the\nwat.",
        "Q: What about other organizations such as the Jewish Defense Committee?",
        "A: Well, there was, of course, the CDJ, which was a committee for the defense of the Jews, the\ninitials are the same in English as in French, . Who was very active\nand collaborated very closely with Father Bruno. The problem with that is, like it was in\nFrance, some of the leaders of that group were, how shall I say, were persuaded by the\nGermans to cooperate with them. But, of course, the ultimate idea was not at all cooperation,\nit was to get all the information they could get. And so, Father Bruno was a little bit reluctant\nto associate directly with the CDJ because he knew there were files and reams of paper that\ncould be found and were found by the Gestapo leading to the arrest of quite a number of\npeople. Fortunately, most of the members of CDJ escaped death. Several went to various\ncamps, but they didn't die. One of them was Mrs. Jospa(ph) who was one of the closest\ncollaborators of Father Bruno and is still alive now, as a matter of fact. And there were\nseveral others who were both in the armed resistance and in the peaceful resistance. Because\nFather Bruno always said, I'm going to be resistance, but I'm going to be a peaceful\nresistance. I will never bear arms. Which he didn't. But some of the actual armed resistance\ndid cooperate with the peaceful resistance for various reasons and there were several of\nthose, one of them was killed in action and another one died, I believe, after the liberation in\nan unfortunate accident, in the army at that time.",
        "Q: What sort of coordination would there have been between this committee and your Uncle's\nnetwork?",
        "A: The coordination was on a person to person basis mostly. They were, the CDJ had visitors,\nor visiting people I should say, who visited the children at various places. And they would\nreport to the CDJ, but also to Father Bruno. And the CDJ had a committee that was\nspecifically organized to do that, to keep track of the kids that were placed. But that was\nprecisely one of the dangers that Father Bruno feared. That there was too much\ndocumentation. And so he tried to cooperate with them as close as he could, but without any\nwritten documentation, without papers. He would handle only cash, never checks. Or just,\nyou know, items, like butter or meat or something. But he would not use things that could be\ntraced, such as checks or various deposit slips and that sort of thing. He would meet with the\nrepresentatives of the CDJ in a neutral environment, but there were never any records written\nof their discussion, except when he was called to the committee of the CDJ as a guest. Then\nthey kept their records, but he always insisted, he said, don't put my name on your records.\nNot that I'm afraid for me, but if they catch me, my entire network is gone. So, they didn't put\nhis name on the records. This actually caused some confusion after the war because he said, I\nwas at that meeting. And they would pull the records and say, well, you're name is not on it.\nAnd, but that was deliberate. So, there was a loose cooperation, but there was cooperation.\nAnd in fact, a fairly extensive, but loose, if you see what I mean? It wasn't, you know, like in\nan army where the corporal refers to the sergeant, the sergeant refers to the second lieutenant\nand so on and so forth. It was a loose cooperation. They would have meetings that were\ninformal where decisions were made only verbally and that actually added to the security of\nthe network.",
        "Q: Were there Protestant groups who were also involved in this?",
        "A: There was some Protestants but, you know, Belgium has very few Protestants actually. But\nthere were several Protestant ministers involved. Indeed. But to go back to the Catholic\nclergy. There was a whole network of priests who worked either directly or indirectly with\nFather Bruno. One of the best known was Father Andre(ph) from Namir(ph) who, you know,\nat the greatest risk, always had something like 10, 12, 15, up to 25 kids in his own house in\nNamir. And here's another one of those extremely bizarre coincidences. Father Bruno did not\nhave a house or an apartment where he could, you know, which he could call his base. Until\na spinster of a certain age allowed him to use a little house she had on the square in the\nmiddle of Brussels. Because she wasn't using it and it wasn't being rented. It was a very\nsmall house. On the left side was a cafe with horse betting, what do you call that? You know\nwhat I mean. Anyway, horse betting. On the other side was a of the SS,\nwho was working on the Gestapo Jewish files of New Louise(ph) in Brussels. But that\nturned out, again, to be a sort of a protection. Because he was right next to this important\nNazi officer and they never ever considered the little house in between there. And the second\ncoincidence, Father Andre in Namir had, on his left, a cafe with horse betting and on his\nright a portion of the Commandant , which was not SS, but it was German\narmy. Can you imagine a more bizarre coincidence than that? Father Andre did an awful lot\nof work and he deserves all the credit. I think he is on the list at the museum, also. Deserves\nall the credit. And until the end of the war, he was constantly at risk of being caught. There\nwere many other priests, I won't give you all the names. First of all, I can't remember them\nright now, one of them was Count , who was an aristocrat of a very old\nBelgian family who was a pastor of a church in Brussels. He, too, took care of several kids.\nHe was a friend of my father's actually. And there were quite a number of other clergymen.\nAnd nuns, of course, too. Flora Singer was hidden in a convent of nuns. It wasn't always a\npleasant life because the nuns themselves don't have a very pleasant life. Very strict and\nduring the war there wasn't enough food for everybody and they had to, you know, to share\nwhat food they had with everybody, including the Jewish girls, usually girls, who were\nhidden there. So some of the girls have bad memories of having to wash the dishes and of\nbeing cold in their beds because the central heating wasn't working. There was no coal. And\nat that time, central heating was mostly coal fired. We didn't have any oil. Even if it had been\noil fired, they wouldn't have had any oil to put in there anyway. So, yeah, the conditions\nwere not always pleasant. But, what's the alternative?",
        "Q: When you mention the scarcity of food or coal, how did your uncle and his colleagues get\nenough food or clothing?",
        "A: You know, that was one of the most hair raising problems, of course. To get enough food\nand clothing. Partly it was contributions from people who had enough food, just enough and\nmaybe a little more than just enough. That was only a small part. I think most of the sources\nwere actually legal sources done illegally. In other words, there was, for example, the wife of\nthe same professor at the University of Louvan(ph) who at night went, would you believe, to\nburglarize the office of rationing, the rationing department. And stole reams of food stamps.\nNow, you couldn't have just food stamps because you also had to have a card to go with\nthem. That was a precaution the Germans took so that that very thing wouldn't happen. So,\nthey had to forge food cards. And in the book that, the new book that we wrote about Father\nBruno, there is a sample of one of those food cards. Strangely enough, one of the best forgers\nwas an old monk in Father Bruno's abbey, , very, very adorable old father\nwho would never have done a thing like that in his life if he hadn't been persuaded by Father\nBruno that he was doing humanitarian work. He said, I can't be a forger. But, he did and he\nwas probably the best of all. So, they forged hundreds of food cards. They also had to forge\nidentity cards to go along with food cards because, unlike the United States, most European\ncountries demand that their citizens bear an identity card on them all the time. At least after\nage 12. So, you know, they had to, we had to forge identity cards with false names, false\nplaces of birth and false dates of birth so that nothing could be traced. One time Father Bruno\nwas at an open market, there was an open flea market in Brussels in the center of the city,\nand he was looking, I think, for old clothes or something like that. And he had his briefcase\nwith him full of blank identity cards. And, sure enough, as he walked away, there was a\ncheck point with two , who were there and were searching peoples suitcases as\nwell as checking the papers. And he had a false identity card himself which said that he was\nan employee of the government. And he managed to persuade those numskulls that he was\ntaking work home because he needed to finish some cards for the next day. And they let him\ngo. Now, you had to be pretty thick to let that happen. But they did. That was one of his\nclose escapes. He had a few more, but that was one of them. And, so, ration cards, food\nstamps, stolen. It was very difficult to produce false food stamps, 1t was almost impossible.\nYou had to have the glue, you had to have special colors and so on and so on, so they were\nstolen, they were not falsified. Identity cards, on the other hand, were pre-printed and then\nthey filled in the name by hand. So once you had the pre-printed card, it wasn't too difficult\nto falsify a card as long as you had one of the city rubber stamps or one of those embossing\nstamps. That worked. If you were lucky. There was always a problem because, you know,\nyou had to have a signature on that and if somebody was pretty bright, which didn't often\nhappen in the SS, thank goodness, they could have made the person reproduce their\nsignature. You know, since many of those were young kids, maybe 14, 15 years old, they\ncould have done a bad job of reproducing their signature and that would have given away the\nfalsification. So, identity cards, food cards, ration stamps and mostly, occasionally a, what do\nyou call it, a welfare check. But he didn't like that because, again, that could be traced. Most\nof the time the money, as I said, came either from the bank or from private contributions.",
        "Q: Did he have cohorts in government offices?",
        "A: Yes. Yes. He had, fortunately, many, many of the Belgian civil service employees were\nfaithful, were reliable. They were anti-German and he knew which were and which were not.\nHe had a number of helpers, mostly in the municipal governments where it was most\nimportant. Because that's where the stamps and the cards were issued. One day he went in\nthis particular municipal office where he had an appointment with the assistant chief and a\nlady seemed to be in a hurry and, because he was very courteous, he said, okay, go in first.\nShe went in, took her time, and he saw two people just babbling or talking about various\npapers there and then it was his turn and one of the guys walked away, went away. Picked up\nhis suitcase, his briefcase, and went away. And when he got near the assistant chief, he said,\nyou don't know, but I'm sweating here. That man who just left was from the Gestapo. If you\nhad come in at your turn instead of letting the lady go in first, we would have been both\ncaught. So, another close escape. But, this was help he got from the civil service or the\nemployees of the government, various governments.",
        "Q: Were most of these people who helped him motivated by working with Father Bruno, anti-\nGerman, or really motivated to rescue Jewish children?",
        "A: I think all three. I think it varied on the person. You may even add one. Money. Because\nmany rescuers were given money. And during the war, money was very tight. And some\npeople would take this terrible risk just to get a little more money to survive. But, I would\nsay, all three. Idealism, you know, I want to save the Jewish children. Charisma from Father\nBruno. And, you know as you said, all these three possibilities plus, I think, a certain appeal\nfor money at times.",
        "Q: What other aspects of the logistics were very difficult?",
        "A: Transportation. Not to be caught. Because some kids had to be transported from one end of\nBelgium to the other. And even though Belgium is a small country, that still represented 200\nmiles sometimes and the trains during the war were extremely slow and rare. And so, it may\nhave taken a whole day to do 200 miles by train. You know, getting the children registered\nin a certain municipality with a false ID card. It was difficult unless you had cooperation\nfrom the local authorities. And once or twice, there was a close call because he would have\nhelp from one of the employees and then the mayor of that particular municipality would be\neither scared or maybe even pro-German. And they would get wind of the thing and\nimmediately the child would have to be moved away. That was one of the logistical\ndifficulties, too. And then as I say, as I said previously, the stealing food stamps, you didn't\njust barge in those municipal offices and pick your choice of stamps. You know, it had to be\ndone extremely carefully at night, sometimes it was done with the complicity of the\nemployee who would leave the door open, for example. Not lock the door. And pretend to go\nhome as usual. And then a few hours later, somebody else would come in and sneak in and\nsteal. And even getting the blank identity cards was sometimes difficult. Perhaps less\ndifficult than the food cards. Logistics. Getting clothing. Getting a child registered in school\nbecause these kids had to continue their education during the war. I mean, they couldn't just\nstay for a year or even two years without any schooling. So, to have them accepted in school\nwas not all that hard, but, there were school inspections and the authorities, the occupant\nauthorities would know how many kids had to be there, and where did the extra one come\nfrom? So when they suspected there would be an inspection, they would, perhaps either tell\nthe Jewish child to stay home or another child to stay home, or another child. You know, the\nteacher would say, oh, you've been sneezing three times today, why don't you go home? And\nthe kid would be most happy to do that and the parents say, oh, what's going on here? Well,\nwe think he may have a cold, keep him home for a day or two. So, that would bring the\nnumber back to normal. There were a few interesting incidents, too, because of the language\nproblem. Quite a number of these kids were from Eastern Europe. And even the Belgian\nJews sometimes spoke Yiddish. And one incident occurred in a school in the Waloon(ph)\npart of Belgium, in the southern part of Belgium, and the school inspector came who was,\nunfortunately, paid by the Germans and he checked the children and one of the Jewish kids\nwas there and the inspector spoke to him and he said, do you speak French? And the kid\nsaid, yeah, of course. Alright do you speak other languages? Oh, yeah, I speak Flemish. And\nthen the guy, sneaky as he was, said, well, what do you speak at home? Oh, Yiddish. [sharp\nintake of breath] That was it. He gave it away. But, apparently, as far as I know, the child\ndid not get taken. Because the teacher was fast enough to make him go away immediately\nbefore the authorities had the time to go and fill their papers and, you know, send another\ncrew to arrest him and so on. Somehow, apparently that incident could have been terrible,\nyou know, passed away without any major trouble. But, you never know, little children, even\nthough they've been trained and trained, they will do things that are beyond their control. A\nlittle girl in a train with one of the, what do you call them, the escorts, was talking to a nice\ngentleman across from her on the seat. And he said, what's your name? And she said, do you\nwant my real name or the other? And, fortunately, the gentleman, obviously was not\nsympathetic to the Germans because he didn't say anything, he just kept quiet. But, see how,\nyou know, alarms can just pop up like that without any warning.\nEnd of Tape #5\nTape #6",
        "Q: Other logistical consideration or challenges?",
        "A: Like what happens in an emergency, for example. Well, there really wasn't any set system.\nAgain, for obvious security reasons, there couldn't be a certain list where in this case, you\ncall this person, in that case, you call that person. It was strictly a word of mouth affair. And\none person would call the next person who would call the third person who would try to find,\nplease find Father Bruno, he's on his way to such and such town, as soon as he gets there, tell\nhim there is an emergency. And he would get back to the responsible person and see what to\ndo in that particular case. One of the cases that I mentioned in the book there, was a little girl\nwho, in spite of all the instructions, wrote a letter to her mother, who was still in Belgium.\nShe had not been deported. She wrote a letter, the mother found, oh before I go any further, I\nhave to tell you that the parents usually did not know where their kids were. Most of the time\nthey were not told. Obviously, again, for security reasons. For obvious security reasons. Well\nanyway, this little girl had written to her mother, the mother was so anxious to see her that\nshe took the train, went to Gent(ph) and, for some reason, had the foolish idea of taking two\nor three leather purses with her because her husband was a leather worker. And she was\nhoping to sell those to pay for her train trip. She walked into a purse, what do you call those\nstores where they sell purses? In French they call them . Anyway, she went\nin and offered her purses for sale to the man who, I think he even bought them. The man was\none of the representatives of the Flemish pro-German group in Gent. So, the mother went to\nthe convent which was strictly forbidden. And the sisters, in a panic, called two or three\npersons and the chain got into operation and the little girl was taken away after she did see\nher mother, I have to say, to a secret other place and the sisters simply had to give up\nkeeping Jewish girls because the mother had told this man why she was in Gent. You know,\nsometimes people's brains don't function too well. But, anyway, that kind of emergency\noccurred a fair number of times. One time, again you can read that if you want in the\nbiography, there were three kids who were in a home for Jewish children which was\ncompletely under German control. And Father Bruno wanted those kids to escape. And, well\nto make a long story short, he arranged for them to have diphtheria, quote unquote, and they\nwere immediately transferred to the hospital because of a call, again through the chain,\nsaying that, well, the Germans were terribly afraid of diphtheria, they had to take those\ncontagious children out of the home and isolate them. So they did that. And, again the chain\nworked, when they were so called cured, they never had been sick in the first place, Mrs.\nRuspa(ph) and a couple of other people took the three children, made a release letter in three\ncopies, gave one to the hospital, mailed one to the home, because the Germans had said, now\nit's time to go get those children, and have the doctor release them. Well, they mailed one,\nbut in the meantime, before the mail got to the home which would take at least 24 hours, the\nchildren were far away and they kept the third release copy. This was one of the most movie-\nlike episodes because they had to enlist the help of the doctors, of the nurses, of the\nbacteriologist who falsified the cultures. Of the bacteriologist, again, who had to say they\nwere cured. Of the person who made the release letter, who said they could be picked up.\nAnd knew perfectly well they were not going to be picked up because they were already\ngone. You know, all of these episodes, if one of them failed, that was the end of it. But,\nnothing failed, everything worked fine. What other logistical things were we talking about,\nagain?",
        "Q: Well, I'm sort of curious. This may be a dumb question, but, how did people find Father\nBruno and how did he find families to take care of the children?",
        "A: Oh, yes. Well, how did they find Father Bruno? Occasionally, through the CDJ, but most of\nthe time a simple word of mouth. Mrs. Abraham on this floor would talk to Sarah on the\nother floor and say, you know, I know this Catholic monk who took my cousin's little\ndaughter and hid her. You're in danger, they're looking after you there, they're trying to find\nyou. Why don't you ask him to hide your little daughter. And they would do that. Family\nmembers. Sometimes out of the blue. He would never know where or how those people\nwould have got his name. Which was a bit distressing because, he said, if some totally\nunknown person got my name, who else got my name? And, as a matter of fact, there was\none time when he was going 1n one of the streets in Brussels to go collect a little boy, I think,\nand as he was turning the corner, he saw a black car stopping in front there and he knew that\nwas the Gestapo. And they got the boy. He never had the boy. He never had this child, didn't\nput his hand on the child once. But, they got the child. That was very sad. That was one of\nhis most sad experiences, even though it wasn't really one of his proteges, he hadn't gotten\nthe child yet. But, someone had babbled and that was it. Then, we were talking about\nemotional issues. That was a big problem. Many of these children, of course, didn't want to\nleave their parents. Some of them were old enough to understand what was going on and\nthey would try to make do. The little ones, you know, the three or four or two year old ones,\nit was a very, very sad, very difficult thing to handle. Particularly for Father Bruno who had\nnever had any children of his own. And this was one of the reasons why he was known to\nkeep track of his, quote unquote, kids by going to visit them all the time. In addition to\nlooking for new places, he kept track of the old places. And one of the most intimate friends\nof Father Bruno, a friendship which continued after the war, was the Rotmeal(ph) brothers\nwho are now in this country. And they describe when he would come to the farm where they\nwere hidden, and one day he would come with his cassock and the next time he would come\nwith green pants, you know, those pants that they wear to play golf, I forget, knickers. With\ngreen knickers and then Bernard would say, why are you wearing that? Well, I'm not Father\nBruno any more, I'm Mr. so and so. He had several identities. And his last identity was Msr.\nRenau(ph), you know Renau in French means fox. And it was kind of play on words, of\ncourse, because he out-foxed them all the time. And he said, no, Iam Msr. Renau, you don't\nknow me as Father Bruno any more. And he would visit them as often as he could. But, of\ncourse, when there are 300 of them, he couldn't see them every day. But, he would keep\ntrack precisely for those emotional reasons. Because he had a charisma and he inspired\nconfidence to the, at least to the children old enough to understand. And they would really\nget very, very attached to him. And knowing that he was going to come back sort of soothed\ntheir anxieties. And made them, you know, accept the separation a little bit better. He made a\nbig point of that.",
        "Q: How do you find all of these families who would harbor the children?",
        "A: Well, again, it's word of mouth. And occasionally, as we said before, by the CDJ, the\nCommittee for the Defense of Jews. Frequently, Father Bruno himself would just go and talk\nto those people. Like the University professor I mentioned. He would just go in their house\nand say, I want you to help. And he had this way of talking to people that they couldn't say\nno. You know, when I was a little boy and I wasn't being very good, all he had to do 1s say,\nnow, you're going to have to do it. And we did. You know. Both my sister and my brother\nand I, all he had to say is, I want you to do this. And we would do it. Even if we had been\nvery bad with our parents.",
        "Q: But I mean, isn't there a whole issue of trust? In just approaching people?",
        "A: Yeah. Well, he approached people after, you know, carefully selecting them. People he knew\nwere trustworthy and people he had known for a long time. His close friends. Or people who\nwere guaranteed by others. There was always a risk. There was always a risk. Accepting a\nJewish child from a family was a risk. Not for the Germans, where the Germans were\nconcerned. But what if that person was a traitor? What if the child was not Jewish and was\njust being used as a, you know, a trap. You know? There was always a risk. But, for some\nreason, he must have had, he must have been a good judge of character, because the only\ntime he almost got caught was when this dreadful traitor, so called Captain Jackson who was\nnot a Captain Jackson, he was a Belgian by the name of Bziter(ph). Convened a so called\nresistance group and he refused to go because he smelled a rat. And all the people who went,\nwent to concentration camp. And he didn't go. Because he smelled a rat. So, you know, he\nhad a sixth sense that made him know when people were genuine or not.",
        "Q: Was this the time when there were arrests at Mossesar(ph)?",
        "A: No. That was, these arrests were made in Male(ph) in Belgium. Male(ph) Mechalen(ph)\nwhich is city between Brussels and Antwerp. No. And there were several of his assistants\nwho went there and they got caught. But I don't think they died in the concentration camp.\nBut, that's neither here nor there, I mean, they could have. They were trapped by this traitor\nwho was shot after the war. He was condemned by a military court and shot.",
        "Q: Wasn't there some close call at Mossesar, as well?",
        "A: Yeah. Well, that was early in the game, actually. Early in the game when he was only\nbeginning his network. He was still at the abbey and they came and searched the abbey at\nMossesar from top to bottom. He managed to hide a bunch of papers in a chimney and,\nagain, those numskulls didn't even think of looking in there. But, he hid them in a secret door\nor trap in the chimney and they never found anything. But that's when the superior of the\nabbey said, listen, I have 80 monks here and their my responsibility. I can't have you have\nyour base of work, I approve of what you're doing, but I can't let you have your base here at\nthe monastery. Because the next time they come, they will find something and we'll all go to\nBruckenvald(ph) or whatever. And, so, that's when he moved out of the abbey. But that was\nstill fairly early in the game, that was in 1942. And he then rented a small apartment in\nLuvan(ph) and that became unsafe, too. And he then rented another apartment 1n Brussels,\nwhich he kept for a few months. And then came the little house from that lady between the\nand the horse betting institution.",
        "Q: Did he have any time for traditional religious practice?",
        "A: Well, he was given dispensation from mandatory celebration of Mass every Sunday by his\nsuperiors. They realized that he couldn't do that. But, whenever he had a chance, he would\ngo to my grandmother's house and in the attic he had a tiny little alter which he built himself\nand he would celebrate Mass for us there. That's one of the very vivid memories I keep of all\nof us, you know, really tightly packed in that tiny little attic and him just having barely space\nto turn around and speak to us. That I remember very vividly. So, he did as much as he could\nbut it's quite obvious that sometimes he had to do without. You know, if on Sunday morning\nhe had an emergency, well, that went before celebrating Mass. And he had permission not to.",
        "Q: How did you feel as you learned more about this, probably afterwards, about being involved\nin this incredible network?",
        "A: Afterwards, after the war when I was old enough to really grasp the danger and the risk, I\nwas terrified. I said, my gosh, we did all that? And then when that time passed, I said, why,\nI'm very happy we did. I felt very good. I said, well, I didn't do much, but at least I was part\nof that and I'm so proud of having his name, bearing his name. You know, that's something\nthat is, 1t remains with you all your life because not so many people are given that\nopportunity to help. And to do it willingly. That, now I shouldn't be overly proud because I\ndid so little, but when I think of my family, I'm still pretty proud. You know, we all took\nrisks, especially the adults, they risked their lives of course, and there were close calls. We\nwere lucky. I guess we were blessed in our efforts.",
        "Q: What happened at the time of liberation?",
        "A: I'm not so sure. I don't want to elaborate too much on that because there were some slightly\nunpleasant moments. Most of them were very happy moments. Kids finding remainders of\ntheir families. There were very sad moments in that happiness because they knew that their\nparents and grandparents had died. But they were happy to return to a family. Some people\ndidn't even, some kids didn't have a family to go back to. Some of them were kept in\nconvents where they were and they were in slightly better condition because the rationing\nwas over. And some of them stayed in school. Some of them had requested to be baptized,\nbut that, oh, I want to insist on this point. This is a point that Father Bruno was\nextraordinarily touchy about. He absolutely refused to put any pressure on any Jewish child\nto change his religion. To convert, quote unquote. That he was adamant about. He said we\nare to save them, but their souls do not belong to us. That was one of his principles. And, but\nsome of them who were, you know, exposed to the liturgy and to maybe some slightly, you\nknow, warmer person in the Catholic church, wanted to, there were about five or six of them\nwho wanted to be baptized and that was a big point of contention. Because he actually did\nnot want to baptize them unless he had the total guarantee that first of all, the parents wanted\nit if they were still alive. Second, that they would have accepted it if they, none of them did,\nbut had previously made that allowance or permission if you want, and that his superiors\nwere in agreement, too. And I think there were about five out of the 320 or something who\nwere baptized and I think, two or maybe three remained in the Catholic church. The other\ntwo just went back to Judaism. And he found that fine. He said, first of all, you weren't\ntotally adult, you were not sure what you were doing. Now you saw your fellow Jews and\nyou wanted to be more close to them, fine, go back, that's alright. He never, never put any\nobstacle to that. And he always refused to put pressure. Now, I won't say that there wasn't an\noccasional old crotchety nun who thought that being non-Christian was the worst sin in the\nworld. And may have put some pressure on some of the kids, that's possible. That is, I'm not\ndenying that. Neither did Father Bruno. But, it was against his will and, actually, there is no\nrecord that any of those actually did change, so it was just an annoyance and was a little\nchild abuse, I would say. Moral child abuse. Which he certainly didn't approve of. Okay. I\ndigress now. What were you asking me?",
        "Q: We were talking about the difficulties after liberation.",
        "A: Right, that's right. It took months and months and, if not to say years, to find the surviving\nparents, if there were any. To find surviving family. Uncles, cousins, if there were any. And\nto find willing adoptive parents if there were no family members available. Some of the kids,\neven though they still remained Jewish, wanted to stay with the people who had harbored\nthem during the war. That became a little difficult because the CDJ, after the war, tried to\ngather all the kids back into the Jewish fold, which 1s fine, I mean, it was a legitimate\nconcern of them. The only thing where Father Bruno objected seriously is when a home for\nJewish kid was built and, supposedly, non-denominational, but it was only Jewish children.\nAnd some members of the CDJ wanted some of the kids to go there. But Father Bruno said, I\ndon't want that. I want them to go back to a good Jewish family, that's fine, but I don't want\nthem to go to a sterile, although Jewish, environment where they will not teach them\nreligion, or if they do it will be on an optional basis and where they will not be allowed to\npractice the Christian religion if they wanted to do so. And that was one of the points of\ncontention. Unfortunately. Another point of contention was some of the relatives who\nwanted to get the children back before any formalities had been completed. And I have,\nunfortunately, witnessed a very sad and dramatic incident where some uncles came to my\nyounger uncle's house the day after liberation and demanded to have one of the kids who was\nstaying there, without permission from anybody else. Not even the CDJ, by the way. You\nknow. They just came and took the child. Not knowing if the parents were alive or what.\nThey just wanted the kid. And they didn't even live in the same city. There were a few\nunpleasant incidents, but I would say on the whole, the vast majority, the replacement of\nthese children went pretty smoothly. Thanks to the help of people like Mrs. Jospa(ph), who\nmade a point of continuing Father Bruno's work yet working for the CDJ or the, I forget the\nnew name they get, they got after the war, but anyway, it's the CDJ, it's the same.",
        "Q: So, Father Bruno's work didn't end at liberation?",
        "A: No, it didn't. In fact, he continued to work for about two months and then had a bad accident.\nAnd had to be hospitalized for a full month. And during that time, he was unable to do\nanything. Most of his assistants took over. And took over the replacement functions and he\nkind of loosely supervised after that. Then he was re-drafted in the army because before the\nwar he was an army chaplain, yeah, he was a mobile Benedictine. He was an army chaplain\nduring the campaign of 1940. He was slightly wounded and was taken prisoner of war in\nGermany. Then after World War II, after his accident was healed, his superiors said it was\nokay for him to go back into the army. And he went back into the army for another three\nyears. And he went to Germany. And this is where he was able to see with his own eyes\nnumerous concentration camps. Particularly Neu , which he photographed\nextensively. And Bergen Belsen and several others. I forget which ones they were.\nEnd of Tape #6\nTape #7",
        "Q: From my reading, I understand that your uncle was a true intellectual, a scholar, and yet,\ncame time for the war, he had tremendous street smarts, pragmatic skills all of that.",
        "A: Yes, and people have all the qualities, don't they? He was a Benedictine. And in French we\nhad a saying for people who do enormous amounts of tedious, lengthy work.\n. The work of a Benedictine. And in addition to his action work during\nWorld War II, he did the same thing. He did that. He did the . He compiled very\nextensive studies on the works of some of the Catholic Church's early fathers. Like Saint\nIrinae(ph) who was one of the early writers of the Catholic Church, in the Fourth Century, I\nbelieve. Incidently, I received a call from a very erudite professor at one of the Eastern\nuniversities a few months ago saying, oh, I read in the bibliography for Saint Irinae that your\nuncle's work is the basic work for people who research Saint Irinae and I was very proud to\nhear that his name has appeared in this, I forget the name of the man, but I've got 1s\nsomeplace. Doctor so and so is doing studies on Saint Irinae himself. And he's basing his\nstudies on Father Bruno's work. He published one very extensive work in which he, a sort of\na dictionary, if you want, in four languages, Latin, Greek, Coptic(ph) and Aramian(ph).\nBecause Saint Irinae's writings were in various translations at that time already. And so that\nwhoever 1s doing studies on Saint Irinae can read them in either language. And he published\nan extensive study on the writings themselves. And then he had a continuous series of\narticles in one of the theological reviews in .",
        "Q: I'm just curious, this contrast between the man you're describing right now and this man of\naction who was so successful and so active.",
        "A: He was, after the war, he was pastor of a small village for several years and enjoyed that very\nmuch. His superior had released him from the abbey because he could see he just couldn't\nstay in the abbey any more. He had done so much work outside that to be cloistered again\nwould just kill him. So he sent him as pastor at a small village in the south of Belgium. I\nwent there several times and enjoyed it very much. He became totally enthralled by this\npastoral ministry which he hadn't actually done before. He became totally conquered by that.\nThe village people loved him a lot, too, and yet, he would close his door at a certain time and\nthey knew better than to bother him unless if it's for an emergency. And he would work on\nhis intellectual endeavors. So, he would spend two or three hours a day writing and\nresearching Saint Irinae again. And so he tried to always balance, you know. Of course,\nduring the war he did little intellectual work, but he did some. And I still remember my\ngrandmother transcribing some of his chicken scratch onto neat white paper. She has a\nbeautiful, had a beautiful handwriting. And she transcribed many, many pages of his works.\nSo it would be legible for the publisher. During the war.",
        "Q: As an individual, is religion important to you today?",
        "A: To me? Well, we have remained practicing Catholics and our children are, too. I perhaps\ndon't have the as we Say in France, the sacred fire, as much as Father\nBruno had. We try to remain, let's say reasonably close. We go to church every Sunday and\none of our very best friends is a Dutch priest who speaks, you know, a Dutch priest who is a,\nwho speaks several languages and we became very friendly with him. And he's one of the\ntotally adorable people. A little bit like Father Bruno. He has been teaching theology,\nlanguages and so on, and yet, he did all the garden work for the seminary at St. Thomas\nseminary. Again, a man of both action and cerebral work, if you want. So, yeah, we're, I\nwould say it's important. I won't claim and be dishonest and say that we are thinking about it\nevery minute. But, it is still important for us, yeah.",
        "Q: Are there certain lessons that you gained from that religious practice or observance that\nimpact the way you live, still.",
        "A: I should say so. I should say the concern for other people, the concern for\n, aS We Say in French. Our neighbor. You know, the things that our\ngrandmother taught us to be concerned about other people, to be practically practicing our\nreligion. Not just kneeling on the pew and babbling prayers that don't mean anything to us. I\nprobably don't remember the vast majority of prayers I learned by heart when I was young.\nBut, I don't think that's so important. It's much more important to be nice to your neighbor, to\ndo things to help, to be concerned about your neighbor. I would like, 1f you don't mind, I\nwould like to give you something that Father Bruno said when he was asked, why did you do\nthat? He said, the motives was a revolt against injustice and violence. A consciousness of our\ncommon past. Both historical and theological. He was very conscious of that. Personal\nfondness for encounters, quote, at the frontiers. Because in the '40's it was still considered the\nfrontiers, you know, Catholic priests didn't mingle so much with Jews. He loved it. Secondly,\nthe goals. To save human lives. To reconstitute or preserve families. To establish human\ncontacts between Judaism and Christianity. And the spirit is a spirit of respect of human life.\nRespect of human dignity. Expansion of mutual respect by reciprocal knowledge of values,\nculture and spiritual climate. That was his answer. He did not give very many interviews.\nCertainly not a four hour one. But this is one that he expected to give, to a Jewish\npublication. And I thought it resumed or it abstracted well what his ideas were.",
        "Q: Through yourself. These early experiences for you, when you grew up very fast, how do you\nthink they influenced you later in life?",
        "A: I would say that it was a little bit on the back burner for maybe, oh, 20 years after the end of\nthe war. Mostly because I didn't have time to do anything but study. I was in high school and\nthen in college and then in medical school. I graduated in 1959. We came here in a new\nenvironment. In 1961. I didn't have any books with me because I didn't know I was going to\nstay so long. I read and spoke English, but I didn't know much about the libraries here, so I\ndidn't have anything to go to to get more information. Gradually, on the other hand, after I\ntalked to my uncle a number of times, and I saw him again on my rare trips to Belgium, I,\nsuddenly it came back and I said, I've got to do something about that. And I became a\nfanatical history buff only about World War II and particularly the Holocaust. And I became\nso interested that I felt almost as Jewish as my Jewish friends at times. We had a reunion in\nWashington D.C. about two years ago where a good dozen of rescued people met with me\nand we gave a series of lectures through the ADL and so on in Washington. And at the end,\nwhen they asked me to say something about them, I said, I think I've got 12 new Jewish\ncousins. And, yeah, it did change my mind on a lot of things. I realized how close we could\nbe and, you know, which I probably wouldn't have known as well if I hadn't gone into that\nintensive study of the events. And then after I studied the Holocaust in general, then I dug\ninto Father Bruno's records which were not all that abundant because he destroyed much of\nthem after World War II. But I was able to collect a good number of things and, of course,\nthere were things I knew of personal knowledge. I got information from my other uncles and\naunts who had letters and had memories or, you know, in their minds. And helped me and\nwe all worked together on that. And when he finally died, we decided we had to do\nsomething. And then this nice young man, Mr. Johannes(ph) Bloom(ph), who was much to\nyoung to have known Father Bruno, was an Austrian Jew. Came to Brussels and heard about\nhim and said, we've got to do something to try to remember this person. And then he got in\ntouch with me, we wrote the biography, we got testimonies from a number of rescued\npeople, many of whom are still alive in Israel. One of his most favorite guys is still in a\nkibbutz there and his name is Svee(ph) Harlioff(ph). And he was one of the most vocal and\nbefore, actually, we started working on that, Israel invited Father Bruno, as a guest, in 1964,\nin August, 1964, he was made Righteous of the Nations at the Advashem(ph). And has a tree\nthere in his name. And he met a number of the kids who were no longer kids at that time, had\nchildren of their own, that he had rescued. And for him, of course, it was a most emotional\nmoment. This is a picture of him that was taken in Israel and it's been the picture that\neverybody has shown of him. It's a very good picture because it shows the twinkle in his eye\nand the half smile which was so typical of him. And he enjoyed his stay there. Then my\nsecond uncle, my younger uncle, the dentist, Jean(ph) , has recently also been\nmade Righteous of the Nations and so he appreciated that very much. He's 82 years old now,\nstill alive and doing well. So he was also honored by Israel for, actually, there were times\nwhen he had 25 kids in his house, and think of the risk.",
        "Q: Your family also helped save adults.",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "Q: Your family also saved some adults.",
        "A: Yeah, but not a great number. And those were most of the time, done by Father Bruno\nhimself. Except for three that were in my house, in my own house, a Polish girl, a young\nPolish girl, an older woman from Eastern Europe...",

        "Q: Is there anything else you'd like to add? I appreciate your...",
        "A: Well, I must say it's a great honor for me to be interviewed by the Museum. I've visited the\nMuseum and it was an extremely emotional experience. My wife, who was with me, had the\nsame experience. It was, I don't know what the word is, but it was quite an experience to see\nthat. Things that I, for the most part, had at least some idea of. Many things I knew rather\nwell, but to actually see all of that in one place and be totally surrounded by that, ooh, 1t was\nquite an experience. I think that's one of the most emotional experiences I've ever had in my\nlife. It was really something I will not forget. And I want to thank you for coming to Denver\nand you people who are filming and listening, I appreciate your cooperation and coping with\nmy old house with very little power.",

        "A: Okay. My name is Michel Reynders, R-E-Y-N-D-E-R-S. Date of birth, June 29, 1931. Born\nin a suburb of Brussels, Belgium. Called Uccle, U-C-C-L-E.",
        "A: My family on my father's side is a large family. My grandfather was a physician in one of the\nboroughs, if you want, of Brussels. They had eight children, my grandparents had eight\nchildren. My grandmother was, as we say, the strong woman of the Gospel. She was leading\nand reigning over that family like a headmistress. But, she was a very, very wonderful lady.\nMy parents, my father was a physician. My mother was a housewife. They met when my\nfather was a young doctor and their first encounter was actually when my mother was on the\noperating table when she had appendicitis. Then they got married in 1930 and I was born in\n1931. Ihave a brother, a sister who was born in 1935 and a brother who was born in 1938.\nAnd we had, we lived in a very nice house in Brussels which to me remains the epitome of a\nnice family house. My grandmother's house was also a very nice one. And we very\nfrequently met our cousins and uncles and all of that, the whole family, in her apartment in\nthat big house. Actually, we had a sort of a little reunion of the cousins who were around\npractically every week. Every Tuesday. And we gathered around the big table with sweets,\ncookies and breads and you would call them danish, but we didn't call them that. Then in\n1938, my parents bought another house which I didn't like and I never did like it. Even\nthough we lived in it for a long time. And, well, shall I tell you about our, the things we did\nfor entertainment?",
        "A: Oh, absolutely, yes.",
        "A: Well, my, on my mother's side, let's say they were, theoretical Catholics. On my father's side,\nthey were very devout Catholics. Everybody went to church on Sunday, every Sunday. And\nto confession a few times a year. Just to get the load off their chest, I suppose. On my\nmother's side, they were the type of Catholics who went to church for a baptism, wedding\nand funeral. My, on my father's side, my grandmother was a practical religious person. She\ndidn't go for, you know, a lot of babbling and all that sort of thing. But, she thought religion\nshould be applied to your day-to-day life in a practical way. In other words, you know, it, she\ndidn't believe much in kneeling on bench and then going like this and so on. She said, do this\nthing right because that's the way God wants you to do it. And do that thing night and, you\nknow, you'll be rewarded in your other life. And, you know, she wanted to make religion a\nreal part of their, of her life and our lives. And she actually didn't spend all that much time,\nwell, just one, she, you know, didn't spend all that much time in church and that's the whole\nthing. Just because, as I say, she was much more of a pragmatic person. Very interesting\nlady, as a matter of fact. What else can I say? Well, we celebrated, of course, all the religious\nholidays in a very extensive way. Mostly, Christmas and Easter. But, you may know or not\nknow, that in Belgium, in addition to Christmas, the children celebrate St. Nicholas and that\nwas the big event for the children before World War II. We would all gather to, first in our\nown homes and then later to grandmother's home, and get all the toys and candies. That\nwould make us sick for two weeks. But they were delightful anyway. And we would\nsometimes go to the seaside. In fact, quite frequently. And the whole family would also meet\nthere. We wouldn't always stay in the same place, but since, you know, the Belgian sea coast\nis very small, it was always easy to go from one village to the other. And we would have big\npicnics and that sort of thing. We were a very closely knit family.",
        "A: Yeah. My uncle, Father Bruno(ph), was a Benedictine Monk and he had three sisters, my\nthree aunts, who were nuns. Two of them were Benedictine Nuns in Liesch(ph), Belgium.\nThe third one was a Sister of Notre Dame, which is a teaching order. And she was, she\nmoved to various convents during her life. She is currently alive and well in Namure(ph),\nBelgium. She is 88 years old, almost 89. And clear as a bell, sharp as a tack. And she\nparticipated in Father Bruno's work quite a bit, too. As did the other sisters, who are now\ndeceased.",
        "A: No, it was traditional...\nPause in tape.",
        "A: We went to religious schools. We, in Belgium, the diocese or, you know, the lay, not the lay,\nbut the nun, monastic schools, are called colleges. It has nothing to do with American\ncollege. You're in college from your first grade on. Until your 12th grade. So, yes, I did go\nto, first to a small school where the nuns were running the school and I was very privileged\nin having a very, very demanding, if you want, but very charming nun as a kindergarten\nteacher, and I've never forgot her. I still remember her as being a real guidance. And then I\nwent to the college, St. Bonefas(ph) in Brussels. Where my father had been, where my\nuncles had been. And it was almost a family tradition already. Still in existence now. And, in\nfact, my brother was there, too. And my, one of my cousins, oh, several of my cousins,\nactually, went through the same school. It was a very, very wonderful school. I had the best\nteachers you can imagine. And, you know, everybody keeps telling me, didn't you hate\nschool? No, I loved school. I just adored my teachers. In the seventh grade I had a very tall,\nvery powerful looking priest as a teacher. And I can still hear him talking. He was\nextraordinary. He made us live Julius Caesar's wars. Like you'd see a movie. And a couple of\nthree years later I had another teacher who was a strong, sturdy peasant from the Belgian\nAlden(ph), the south of Belgtum where the forests are and those people have their feet on the\nground. Solidly on the ground, and he did, too. And, again, I have such extraordinary\nmemories from my high school, you know, that I still relive them constantly.",
        "A: Oh, absolutely. Oh, yes. As I told you, my grandmother was running the house even from a\ndistance, she was still running her children. Her children's houses with her strong principles\nthat, you know, of charity, of tolerance. Even though she was strict, she was tolerant. You\nknow, it sounds like a contradiction, but it really wasn't. She was strict in her tolerance, you\nsee what I mean? You, she thought you had to force yourself to be tolerant, even if you\ncouldn't feel 1t immediately. You just had to do it. And that was one of the principles that she\ninoculated into us from our very, very small childhood. And I think my, all my uncles and\naunts, and my father as well, have always lived by those principles. So, yes, mostly Christian\nvalues. And, you know, people keep asking me, but what did you think about the other non-\nChristian people? Like the Jews and so on. We didn't know anything. In Belgium, you didn't\nmake that distinction. I didn't know that we had Jewish neighbors where I lived until the SS\ncame and took them away. We were friends with them, we played in the park together. We,\nyou know, Belgium was not at all a discriminatory country or discriminating country. I'm\nbringing that up because I read not too long ago that when you immigrate to the United\nStates, you have to say, Iam Jewish. There is no such thing in Belgium. The identity cards\nthat were issued never, never mentioned race, religion or anything like that. It mentioned\nprofession, job, that they did. But it never mentioned anything that had the slightest hint of\ndiscriminatory inkling, if I may say. So, yes, we were, as I said, as you said and I said, high\nvalues were always proposed, if you want, by my parents and my grandparents and that\nincluded that, you know, that we accepted everybody as they were. Not because they had red\nhair or black eyes or dark skin or whatever. But, because they were just people. I think that is\nof extreme importance for what is going to follow.",
        "A: No, I was not. I'm sure there was a little, but not anywhere nearly as much as in France, for\nexample. France has always, for some reason, cultivated a certain ultra-right philosophy, if\nyou want. Which was definitely anti-Semitic. We didn't have that. Actually, it's to the point\nthat we were never able to tell exactly how many Jews lived in Belgium. Because we had no\nway of knowing. We had no records.",
        "A: Not a political organization. I did, I was, first of all, I was a cub scout for awhile. In Belgium\nwe had, we did have, just after saying there was no discrimination, I have to say that there\nwere the public school cub scouts and the Christian cub scouts. They were friendly, but they\nwere different. I was part of the Christian cub scouts. Then, let's see now, I, yes, I think I was\npart of a small social group where we went to see puppet shows and that sort of things. But,\nit didn't amount to very much. Essentially, cub scouts and later on scouts, was my group\nactivity, let's say.",
        "A: My grandmother had a route, if you want to say, or route where she went and distributed\nfood on a certain day every month. Part of the St. Vincent DePaul general organization,\nwhich exists in France and exists in Belgium. And it consists of lay people who just get\ntogether and sort of, quote, unquote, adopt a few families. They visit them, and I think this is\nstill being done, I'm not sure, but I think so. Right now. They bring them food or clothes and\ntry to help them if they have difficulty with the welfare system and things like that. That was,\nin a way, organized, if you want. Oh, yes, my mother, actually, was part of the nationwide\norganization for the blind. And, yes, she did, she was, in fact, one of the board members of\nthat for quite some time. And the same thing occurred there, they would have poor blind\npeople assigned to them, if you want, to be visited and comforted and supplies brought as\nnecessary.",
        "A: I was, mine was to be very ornery, I'm sure. But, forgive me if I sound like I'm bragging, but\nI do remember that people were telling my parents, oh, he's well mannered, that child. So, I\nguess my mother was very, very proper and she came from a rather proper family and she\nwanted us to have good manners and that sort of thing. I think she taught me good social\nbehavior and, but other than that, I think I was very ornery. I was running up and down and\ndoing things and when my little sister was born, and we did very lots of very strange things.\nLike making mud pies and throwing them at each other. And one day my aunt visited us and\nmy mother just showed her out to the door and while they were gone, we decided to sample\nthe port wine which my aunt and my mother had sampled before and I never understood why\nthe house was spinning so much around me. And my little sister fell asleep and we woke up\nthe next day, I think it must have been with a headache, but I don't remember that for sure. In\nschool, as I say, I enjoyed school enormously. And, so it wasn't a chore, it wasn't a burden\nfor me to go to school. So, I studied with great pleasure and I guess I managed to have pretty\ndecent grades. That way. It wasn't any, you know, great effort. I didn't really force myself, I\njust studied because I thought it was fun. And particularly the literary branches, such as\nLatin, Greek. And during the war later on, German and English languages, to me were\nsomething where I literally basked in learning those.",
        "A: Well, we saw him very frequently because unlike most Benedictine Monks, he was not\nalways cloistered. In fact, he dubbed himself the most mobile Benedictine in Belgium. Even\nbefore the war. He taught catechism at the Belgian border to Nazi, no, I mean, non-Nazi\nchildren who would cross the border before World War II to learn catechism because it was\nforbidden in Germany and under Hitler. He went to Czechoslovakia during the sad events of\n1938 and so on. And he was frequently a visitor, a quick visitor, it was just come in and out\nfor, you know, an hour or two and I still have someplace, some pictures of me on his knee\nwhere he made me jump on his knee. And I liked him very, very much. He was the image of\nperfection to me. He was almost a semi-god. I had an excellent relationship with him and I\nkept that relation throughout until his death. Unfortunately, when I was here I didn't see him\nas much as I wanted to. But, I had an excellent relationship with him. He was a very warm,\noutgoing person, very funny, too. He told the funniest stories and had a great sense of humor.",
        "A: Hardly anything.",
        "A: We saw a few. And, as a matter of fact, this is not Hitler it's Mussolini, in 1938, my parents\ntook in a young Italian girl, about 14 or 15, to be our babysitter. Because her parents, her\nfather was an active Socialist and had to leave Italy under the Fascist regime, and fled to\nBelgium. And, just as an aside, I absolutely adored that lady and I lost track of her\ncompletely until 1986. I decided, I've got to find her again. So, I wrote a letter to the mayor\nof her town asking, 1s this lady still alive? Does she live 1n that town? I didn't get an answer\nfor about six months, but one day I got a letter from her. So, obviously, the mayor had passed\non the letter to her. She wrote me and said, I remember you as if 1t was yesterday. I went to\nsee her in Asti(ph) in the north of Italy. She came here. And we're still writing to each other\nevery month and the most adorable lady. So, that's one thing I did know. About Fascism. As\nyou Say, we did see a few, yes, a few refugees, but, you know, until 19, well, in 1940, I was\njust nine years old and at that time, I don't think I understood the full impact. But, you grow\nvery rapidly in a war, you know. It didn't take us more than a couple of years before we had\nit all assimilated and we understood what was going on. Well, not everything, but nobody\nelse did. But, we understood, I think, far more than we would have if we hadn't been\noccupied.",
        "A: 1940, May 10, 4:00 in the morning, my father came and shook me and said, boy, let's go to\nthe basement, it's war. And I heard anti-aircraft cannons, I heard airplanes flying overhead.\nAnd then we heard some bombs falling. Brussels wasn't severely bombed, but the Germans\ndid bomb Brussels the first day of the war. I guess, more as a scare tactic than actual, you\nknow, aim at destruction. And I remember that as if 1t was yesterday. And from then on, just\nabout everything that occurred during the occupation 1s in my computer. And it comes back\nwhen, you know, when I think about it. I remember being a very bad boy. Stealing my\nmother's very scarce sugar and putting it into the gas tanks of the German trucks that were\nparked in the street in the front of my school. We were a little group of kids and one of them\nwould be watching the sentry and he was going up the street, we would immediately go and\nunscrew the caps and pour the sugar in there. And, you know, that gums up the engines,\nmakes a mess of the engine. And I remember being kicked in the rear end by a couple of\nFemp(ph) Polezei(ph) who were searching us and, I guess, as I say, I must have been ornery\nbecause I probably talked back to him and he really, I can still feel the pain. And one time I\nwas on a Street car and there was, unfortunately, there were a few traitors as you know, in all\nthe occupied countries, including Belgtum. And it was the 21st of July, which is a Belgian\nnational day, and I was carrying a little black, yellow and red flag, which is the Belgian\ncolors, in my lapel. Very obvious. And one of those traitors came up on the street car and\nsaid, why do you have that on your lapel? And I said, why do you have it on that, I'm not\ngoing to say the word, but thats uniform that you're wearing? And he slapped me in the\nface and I fell out of the street car. I almost got killed by it, but I wasn't really injured. But, I\nthink the traitors were worse sometimes than the actual Germans. I couldn't stand his\narrogance, and I talked back, I must have been about 13 at that time. And, as I say, you learn\nvery fast during the war. And you learn things you maybe you shouldn't be learning, like bad\nwords and that sort of thing. But, yeah, I remember the occupation extremely vividly for\nsome reason. Maybe a half a block from where we were was a, one of the rare skyscrapers in\nBrussels and there lived three German generals there. And I remember very well going to\nschool and seeing those gentlemen, quote unquote, come down the steps there with their\ngreen capes that were lined in red, you know? Very, very flashy. Those were probably too\nimpressive for me to insult because for some reason, even an enemy general is still a general,\nI suppose, you don't say bad things to a general. But, I remember that as if it were yesterday.\nIt's something that stays with you.",
        "A: Yes. Yes. We had the same reflex that the Germans had in Germany under Hitler's day that\nalways look behind us to see if we weren't being followed. And, yeah, the presence was\nheavy. And they made their presence known. Like, every Saturday, they had a victory\nparade. Every Saturday. A victory parade in the streets of Brussels. And they would parade\nin front of the royal palace and then stop there and have a band concert. And they were pretty\nobvious. As I say, on the street cars, you had to be careful what you said because there were\nalways some ears that shouldn't hear what you were saying. Oh, I remember, for example,\none day I was, that was probably toward the end of the war, must have been '44, I was\nstanding on the platform there and a man was seated inside reading a newspaper and the\nstreet car stopped and the Germans came aboard and started searching people. And\neverybody had to put their hands up. And this man very, very casually, very quietly, took a\npistol out of his inside pocket, put it in his newspaper and went like this. The Germans\nsearched him but didn't look inside his newspaper. And he was never found out. But, you\nknow, you had to be very careful of what you said and what you didn't say.\nEnd of Tape #1\nTape #2",
        "A: Are you all right?",
        "A: Is he ready? Okay.",
        "A: Well, the first few months, there really weren't that many changes. Because they tried to go\neasy. And, as I said to you previously, we had a military governor. We did not have a\nGolighter(ph). We didn't have an SS general at that time. We only had one general who was\nan anti-Nazi. General Alexander from Falkenhausen(ph). Who was an old Prussian aristocrat\nwho actually was pretty friendly to the Belgians. So, the first few months were not all that\nbad actually. Except for the obvious presence of the German army. The parades and all that\nsort of things. And, of course, the rationing. The scarcity of essentials. Which, actually,\nbecame much, much worse as of probably 1943. In 1940 and 1941, I can't say that we were\nthat miserable. But in 1942, then Berlin realized that the military governor was not being\nstrong enough, was not being harsh enough. And we received then, an SS man who sort of\ntook over the, quote, political aspect. In other words, diminishing all the powers of the army\nwhich in itself wasn't all that bad. That's when things began to change very drastically. The\nday-to-day life for us became pretty difficult as far as food is concerned. Various supplies.\nThere was no gasoline for my father's little car which he kept, as a doctor was able to keep.\nBut there was no fuel for it so that didn't do much good. And things like that. And then, we\nbegan to see things changing even more drastically. That's when we saw people being taken\naway. We hadn't quite yet realized why they were taken away. We thought maybe they had\ndone some bad things. And were being put in jail for that. And then, pretty quickly, it\nbecame obvious that they were mostly Jewish people, as well as Belgians who had either\nsomething to do with the Resistance or simply hostages. People who were not Jewish that\nhadn't really done anything bad, were taken as hostages in reprisal for various acts of\nresistance and that sort of thing. Or for having hidden resistance or people who were\nresistant to the forced labor that, of course, was imposed. That's another thing that didn't\ncome immediately. Forced labor. Young people taken to Germany forcibly to work. Not\nnecessarily to concentration camps, but to factories and that sort of thing. Being paid a\nmeasly salary and living in squalor and terrible conditions. And, of course, it didn't take long\nbefore the young people understood what was going on and they went into hiding. Electricity\nbecame limited. We would have power cut off after, say, 8:00 at night. Curfews, of course.\nThat began pretty early in the war. Curfews were established, but they weren't strictly\nenforced. Again, it was still the army at that time. But, as soon as the SS and Gestapo police\ncame, those things were strictly enforced. And if you were out in the street at 8:30, you\nimmediately went to jail. You know, not just getting a ticket or something. You were taken\nto jail. And, the trains were limited. There was hardly any coal for the locomotives. Except\nfor the German transports. And then I saw, with my own eyes, the first Jewish transports that\nI ever saw, at the end of 1942. At first I didn't realize what was going on. But, I saw lots of\npeople being packed in, they weren't yet using cattle cars. They were using very old third\nclass cars with, which were boarded, the windows were boarded up. And, but the people\nwere still sitting on benches. They weren't yet packed 100 or 120 in a cattle car. But, I saw\nthem because there was a railroad station only about three or four blocks from my house.\nAnd the tracks were down and so you could see from a little wall and there were iron gates,\nif you want, you could see through the gates what was going on down there. And I saw this\ntrain where people were pushed in with little package or suitcase or bundle of some sort.\nAnd then I was told by somebody who worked there, you know, who these are? No. Well,\nthese are Jewish people that are taken to Germany. That's the first time I ever saw a\ntransport. And I remember that as if it was yesterday. What else? Well, of course, the city\nwas down completely as far as activity is concerned. There were some movie theaters\nplaying German movies and propaganda, of course. All English or American or French\nmovies were outlawed. I don't think I ever went to a real movie until 1944. When, just after\nthe liberation. My father just didn't want us to go to, to go see that thing. Then after World\nWar II, interestingly enough, I was able to see a number of those propaganda movies, but\nthat's neither here nor there. During the war, there were no candies, you know, for kids that\nwas important. Chocolate was still being made, but taken by the German army, most of it. As\nI say, the food was tolerably abundant for the first two years, but then after 1942, things\nbegan to go very badly. We probably, we had a loaf of bread for the five of us for a day or\ntwo. Sometimes maybe twice a week. Meat was rarely, rarely available. We were extremely\nlucky in Belgium that, almost been called a miracle, in 1943, because for some reason, an\nenormous bank of herring began to swim right off the Belgian coast. Within a mile or so.\nThe fishing boats were allowed two lines, so they were allowed to go and fish those herring.\nAnd for about six months that sustained the Belgian people as far as protein is concerned.\nAnd I still remember my poor mother, you know, getting up at 4:00 in the morning, waiting\nuntil 10:00 or 11:00 in line, standing there. Sometimes I went with her when I wasn't in\nschool. And getting two or three measly herrings, but at least we had that. My mother had to\nlearn close to 100 different recipes so we would still eat those because after you've had\nherring every day for six months, you just don't want to ever see another herring in your life.\nBut it saved us.",
        "A: School, at first there was no school for a few months. But it started again in September. You\nknow, the war began in May, it started again in September. And the first year it was school\nas usual. But then it didn't take long before all the books were censored and only the Nazi\ncontrolled versions were allowed. We were, that was mostly in high school later on. But, we\nwere allowed to learn English after we had learned German first. It sounded awful at the\ntime, but in a way it was blessing in disguise, because when I finished high school and all\nmy classmates the same way, we could speak Latin, Greek, French, Flemish, German and\nEnglish. Which has served me well, you know, later in my life. So, I guess I owe that to the\nNazis. But, I'm not grateful.",
        "A: As I say, after 1942, we began to realize what was going on. And we saw some of our\nfriends being taken away. And then it dawned upon us, oh, that's why they're, you know,\nthey're taken away. Because they are Jewish. As I told you before, we didn't even have an\ninkling before World War II. We didn't ask the people which, you know, where do you go?\nDo you go to a synagogue or do you go to a Catholic church or anything. If they went to a\nCatholic church, we would see them because they would go to the same one we did. But, the\nother people who were not in our church, we didn't ask them what they did or where they\nwent or what, and you know, if they had no religion at all, so what, that was fine, you know.\nYeah, we began to see and I have somewhere in my file, I have a picture of a transport taken\nby a friend of my father's who was a doctor, too, from his office window which was just\nabove the building where they took the people. So he took a picture, this was obviously\nforbidden, but he did anyway. They didn't catch him. We still have that picture.",
        "A: Yeah. As of 1942, we began to see the yellow stars. And, of course, at that time, it became\nquite obvious. Then in the center of the city, for example, Jews were not allowed to walk on\nthe sidewalk. I have a picture of that, too. They were forced to walk in the gutter. And when\nit was dry it didn't matter that much, except it was humiliating. But when it was raining they\nhad their feet in the water which wasn't all that pleasant, particularly during the war when we\ndidn't have any good shoes anyway. Many shoes were made out of cardboard and they\nwould just fall apart in that water. If that had been the only misery, I suppose they might\nhave survived it, even though resenting it. But, that was only the beginning. The yellow star,\nthere were a number of people who in the street car, would ostentatiously get up and give\ntheir seat to a person wearing a yellow star. Particularly if there were German officers or\nGerman soldiers on the street car at that time. They would deliberately show, you know, say,\nplease take my seat. I wouldn't say everybody did that, but there were people who did it. I've\nseen it happen.",
        "A: Very quiet. They wouldn't do anything. You know, actually, the individual German,\nparticularly the army people, were rather, I wouldn't say scared, but they weren't particularly\nageressive when alone. As I said before, the, this traitor there was probably more aggressive\nthan the German army people. Now, I'm not talking about the SS. But we didn't see the SS\nall that much. They were always in cars. They hardly ever were on foot. The people on foot\nwere mostly the soldiers and they were sort of well restrained in their attitudes, except when\nthey were asked to do a search. And, you know, to line people up against a wall and search\nthem and that sort of thing, which is how I got my kick in the butt. In general, the population\nwas very understanding and sympathetic. Now, there were a few bad ones. And I'm not\ngoing to deny that. I'm not proud of it. Nobody is. But, 1t wasn't as bad as in France. I can\nassure you of that. We could see that a number of shops where we had been shopping\nregularly for either food or clothes or that sort of thing, were closed. There was nobody there\nany more. And, actually, the Germans did not, as much as they did in their own country, take\nover the Jewish businesses.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah. And, as a matter of fact, anything that had to do with being against the Bosch(ph), as\nwe said, you know, was in favor of most of the Belgian population at that time. They, you\nwill hear people say that, oh, there were some very bad people and, as I said, it's true, the\nlargest newspaper in Brussels was actually Nazi controlled completely. But, interestingly\nenough, it was Jewish owned. But the owner went to England, so the paper was taken over\nby pro-Nazi people. The other large, the other two largest papers, the Socialist one and the\nCatholic ones, just shut down. They didn't publish any more. So the only paper we really had\nwas Neswah(ph) which is the evening, although it was published in the morning. Which was\nNazi controlled entirely. Interestingly, a little anecdote, on the 21st of July, I think it was in\n1943, which is the national day of Belgium, there was a false Swah(ph) distributed which\nhad been printed and put out by the resistance. And, at first, it was so well made that people\ndidn't realize it was not the real one. And they just took it and then you could see the people\npicking up the paper and their jaws dropping because all the things that were said there, you\nknow. We shall win and we'll crush the Bosch and naming all the traitors and that sort of\nthing, and people started reading and reading and sometimes giggling because some funny\nstories were written in there, too. And that was a day of levity during World War II when the\nentire city of Brussels was covered with Neswah, but not the real one. Which was, of course,\nmuch more real than the Nazi controlled one.",
        "A: It became fairly, for me, it became fairly apparent because right in my house we had a\nhousekeeper who worked as a concierge(ph) 1f you want, cleaned the entrance hallway\nwhere my father's patients would come because in Europe, many doctors had their office in\ntheir house, it was very common. And so did my father. And her son was a career soldier in\nthe Belgian Army, was taken war prisoner, and when he came back, immediately joined one\nof the earliest resistant movements and it was impossible for her to hide it from her, from us,\nbecause he had to come home occasionally to get, you know, clothes and that sort of thing\nand he would come at night, sometimes after the curfew, but he never got caught there. So, I\nbecame quickly aware that there was something going on. And so did my sister and brother\nwho were much younger than I, but they knew, oh, Roger was here again. Roger, Roger.\nYeah, Roger was in the resistance and well, actually, Roger had a little brother who was\nexactly my age and slept on the third floor and at 4:00 one night, my mother came and shook\nme and said, hurry up, open the back windows and hurry up, the Germans are at the door.\nAnd Roger was in the house at that time with his brother, sleeping in the same bed. Which\nwas, of course, on purpose. He immediately ran out the roof windows, you know those roof\nwindows in Europe where you can lift like a trap, the window, and he ran out that way and\nwas able to escape and the Germans came and found the little brother in the warm bed, but,\nyou know, they had no way of telling there was another guy there. So, they searched the\nhouse, these were SS, it was Gestapo, actually. And they searched the house, didn't find\nanything, they were very careful not to leave any traces of his passage. And after that, he\nnever came home again. It must have been later in the war, 1t must have been 1943 or\nsomething like that. And, so we were quite aware of a resistance movement. I don't think we\nmade any distinction between the Jewish resistance and non-Jewish resistance. That\nprobably would have been a little too complicated for us to understand at that time. But then,\nwhen my uncle, when Father Bruno came into the picture, and that was late 1942 or early\n'43, for me, then we began to see things quite differently. We, he didn't say anything, you\nknow, he was very, very quiet and never said a word. He never said, I am helping Jewish\nchildren escape. But, after two or three or five had gone through my other uncle's house, and\nI was there quite often, you know, you can be 13 and still think, you know? And at that\npoint, I realized things were going on that were not at all, quote, normal. And I didn't say\nanything, but you put two and two together at age 12 or 13, just as you can when you're an\nadult. And it's from that time on that my uncle, Father Bruno, became perhaps less secretive\nwith me. I was one of the oldest nephews and I was, by far, the one he was closest to. And so\nhe became less secretive in the sense that he would give me a letter to take to a place or there\nwould be a child I had never seen and he said, oh, this is a friend of mine and his name is\nRobert, maybe his name was Abraham, I don't know. But, and, do you know where such and\nsuch street is? Yes, I do. Well, why don't you take the street car and go to such and such\nhouse there and tell them that Robert is looking for a place to stay. And that's all he ever\nsaid. You know, he never said, Robert is Jewish. And Robert always had a war name, a\ndifferent name. One of the kids that I knew particularly well, is alive and well and we called\nhim Roger. Roger Dumois(ph). And I actually lived with him, more or less, for at least six\nmonths. In my other uncle's house, my younger uncle, the dentist. Jean(ph), who worked in\nvery close cooperation with Father Bruno. That was my grandmother's house and he was the\nonly child of my grandmother's who stayed in the family home after he was married because\nhe occupied my grandfather's medical office as a dentist. So he didn't have to look for\nanother place and my grandmother just took the upper floor for herself. And so, the kids\nwere brought there frequently. I, one day I entered without warning into my grandmother's\napartment and there were eight kids sitting, seated there on eight chairs, she had a lot of\nchairs because she had a lot of children. Each of them had a glass of milk in his hand and, of\ncourse, I immediately put two and two together but nobody said anything. She says, Oh,\nwe're just having a little party. And there were eight Jewish kids. One of whom stayed and, it\nwas a funny incident because he was playing with matches and almost set fire to my\ngrandmother's curtains. But she got the fire under control pretty rapidly. But, this is how I,\nyou know, I realized what was going on. And then my uncle Bruno, Henry, Henry was his\nreal name. Father Bruno was his religion name, would come in civilian clothes. I had never\nseen him in civilian clothes, couldn't understand why he was doing that. But, after a while, of\ncourse, we realized he had to because the Germans were after him. And he had a bicycle and\nhe would occasionally ring the bell quite late at night and hide his bicycle inside and\ndisappear in the middle of the night while we were, I frequently slept at my younger uncle's\nhouse because he had a, there was a better heating system in his house than in my parent's\nsecond house, which I didn't like anyway. And, so I did get to see quite a number of the\nproteges, as my uncle used to call them. And, okay, what else?",
        "A: I must honestly say that life went on pretty normally. There was a feeling of security in that\nhouse. I don't know why. Everybody felt pretty safe and secure in that house. He went to\nschool with me to the College , of course, where else? It happens that that\nschool is only about three or four blocks away from my grandparent's house, which 1s the\nmain reason why everybody went there. And so we went to school together and sometimes\nwe didn't see each other during the day because we were not in the same class. But, usually\nat 4:00, which was dismissal time, we would wait for each other at the door and just go on\nhome as if nothing had happened, and as if nothing was going on. Jumping like kids do, you\nknow, and kicking a can once in awhile and that sort of thing. And he looked pretty happy.\nIt's only actually towards the very, very end of the war when I think he had an inkling that\nhis parents had disappeared, that he became a little more sad and more, less expansive, less\ntalkative. But, for a good while there, we were just like two old buddies and playing games\nlike you see kids do and doing our homework together and that sort of thing.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No. No. Actually, that was one thing that Father Bruno stressed upon them, to never talk\nabout, never, your name is Joe Blow now, you don't have any parents, you are not Jewish,\nyou are of Flemish descent, and your parents are travelling in France or something like that.\nOr your parents are dead, you know, or something. But, dead from other causes he meant.\nNo, that was one thing he was very, very strong and stern about. Do not ever talk about your\nfamily and things that happened. So, even in my grandmother's house, there was no such\ntalk.\nEnd of tape #2\nTape #3\n..down a little bit, they might be a little...",
        "A: Well, they're already down. No, I don't mean that, I mean, I'm saying you can tip it back a\nlittle.",
        "A: I was going to say, if I point them more down, they'll be... Yeah, I know they were too high.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Right. Roger.",
        "A: Sulky, you know.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No. That was a no-no. And it was on specific instructions by Father Bruno to not talk about\nevents surrounding the children. Any child that was under his protection, 1f you want to say.\nIt just was too risky. You know, one unfortunate word and it could have caused the death,\nnot only of the child, but everybody around the child. So, no. As little talk as possible. How\ndo you say that? The enemy has ears everywhere? Or something like that. We were very\naware of that. And at that time, when I began to work a little closer to Father Bruno, I was\nalready, well, a young teenager at that time, I was mostly, well almost 13 and 13, and I began\nto understand, you just don't talk about things of importance during the war. Now, on the\ncontrary, we had a little club, if you want, of school kids, we thought of ourselves as very\nimportant. And we had a club which was our resistance club. It didn't do much resistance,\nbut we were organized as a military club. There was a colonel and there was a couple of\nmajors and a couple of captains and if you did well, 1f you, for example, you could report on\nseeing so many German trucks going by, then you got promoted. And if you had counted\nhow many B-17's are flying over our heads, then you got a promotion or a decoration or a\ncommendation of some sort. We had to know by heart, all the types of aircraft, enemy or\nfriendly, and we had exams given by the colonel, you know, and that sort of thing. It didn't\namount to anything, it was just games, but to give you the spirit of the war. You know. And\nwe would hide in the, somebody's basement so the Germans wouldn't hear us. It was very\nsecret. That was mostly, actually, before 1943, I think. When I was still a little more\ninnocent.",
        "A: Yeah. That was part of our assignments. If we did that, that was a great big promotion\nbecause, if you did that, you know, you took a bad risk. And you could be promoted from\nsecond lieutenant all the way to major for doing that. Yeah. And when my mother found out\nabout that, was she every unhappy. Not so much for the sugar, but for the risk I was taking.\nAnd even though these were not SS, I'm sure if they had caught us, they would have\ndefinitely called our parents, maybe put our parents in jail, and that sort of thing.",
        "A: Well, yeah, flat tires and things like that. For some reason, a truck would suddenly develop a\nflat tire. I had a couple of friends who were specialists of that, they would have a little stick\nof wood and put that in the, what do you call this valve, you know? Where they inflate the\ntire? Push it in and there's a little peg in there that if you push it in, the air goes out. So, when\nnobody was looking, he would just push a little piece of wood in there and slowly the air\nwould go out. And the next morning the truck had a flat tire. And, but again, all that didn't\namount to much. But, it's just the spirit, you know. We, it was a spirit of resistance. In our\nchildish way, you know. Go ahead, I'm sorry.",
        "A: Well, I can only speak about my own environment. I would say that in my own environment,\nit was. It was, you know, in World War I, my grandparents had been very, very miserable\nand badly treated by the occupant, so that was still lingering. And, the eight children, except\nperhaps for the last one, had lived through that war with the spirit, let's get rid of the Bosch,\nyou know. And it was still there 25 years later. You just don't get rid of that sort of\nresentment so easily. And, so it wasn't at all difficult for us to pick up because that spirit had\nalready been imparted to us between the wars. You know, when they were telling stories, oh,\ndo you remember so and so? Do you remember when general so and so got beaten by the\nFrench and da, da, da. So, we were living, see Belgium has been occupied by foreign powers\never since Julius Caesar and, you know, Belgians have become, for that reason, exceedingly\nindependent minded people. And it's only since 1830, that Belgium has become a political\nentity of its own, a free, independent country. And then, but we, we have an ancestral\ntradition of hating the occupant. You know, from Julius Caesar to the Franks to the\nSpaniards to the Austrians, the French and then the Germans again. And, yeah, that spirit of\nanti-occupant was very prevalent in my environment. It's difficult for me to judge, you know,\nhow it was in other families. But, the families that we knew were on our side, if I may say.\nWe never, I never, never knew, personally, anyone who was not anti-Nazi. On the contrary,\nmy father had several excellent friends who suffered greatly during the war because of their\nanti-Nazi attitudes and actions. One of them died in a concentration camp, the other one was\nkilled by the SS on the last day of the occupation. He was, they came with a car and started\nshooting blindly around and he got hit by a machine gun bullet and was killed about five\nminutes after my father had said good-bye to him for the day. And then there was the\ngovernor of the national bank who was giving funds to Father Bruno for his children. And\none day, three or four Nazi thugs came and rang his doorbell and said, are you Mr.\nGallopan(ph)? And he said, yes, [machine gun sounds], they just machine gunned him right\non his doorstep, right in front of his wife.",
        "A: Because of his support of the resistance. You know, Father Bruno needed enormous amounts\nof money to be able to feed and clothe his children. And he didn't have anything, of course.\nAnd so, he went to Mr. Gallopan who was a notorious anti-German, even though they had\nleft him as president of the national bank knowing that he was not, he didn't like them. So, he\nwent to this man and this man committed himself to giving him a certain sum of money, I\ndon't remember how much it was, every month. And my other uncle, one of my other uncles\nby marriage, Uncle Jack, was the one who collected the money from the bank every month\nand kept the books. Kept the accounting. And when Mr. Gallopan was killed, someone else\nin the bank honored his promise and they continued to deliver money until the end of the\nwat.",
        "A: Well, I don't want to, you know, I've never been for self aggrandizement. All I ever did, as I\ntold you in this film before, 1s carry little letters and escort children from one point to the\nother. I was too young to do anything else at that time. So, that was my contribution, if you\nwant, being a messenger.",
        "A: And also being a school mate, which probably brought a little comfort to Roger, among\nothers.",
        "A: Well, the one picture I keep is my standing on the rear platform of a street car with my arms\nstretched out on the railing, on the back thing, and a Jewish child looking at me with a cap on\nhis head, hiding his dark hair. And my hair was light blond, very light blond, I was a perfect\nAryan. And we were just playing, you know, being silly kids. With my blue eyes and my\nblond hair, the Germans would, there would be a few Germans on the street cars, but they\nwould probably just take one look at me and just, you know, ignore me. And that was one\npicture that I remember very, very well. Another incident was that, at that time, I was\ncarrying a letter, but I was with my aunt, the wife of the dentist. Of Jean, my aunt\nNinette(ph), one of the women I have most loved in my life. And I was there with her and we\nwere trying to find an address, and we couldn't find the house. And at one point, there were\nGermans 1n the street. They weren't looking for us, but she got scared and we ran away. And\nthen she said, you know, I shouldn't have run away because that may give us away. I should\nhave just said, and I said, well, let me go back by myself. They're not going to bother me.\nAnd I went back and I finally did find that house, rang the doorbell and delivered the letter,\nran like heck out of there to find my aunt again. And she was waiting around the corner on a\nbench somewhere. That's, those are two incidents I do remember.",
        "A: Well, I've been trying to explain that, you know, it grew gradually. At first, we didn't really\nknow what was going on. Certainly not before 1942. And even in 1942, early in the game,\nwe were only sensing something was going on. And it was very important. But, we couldn't\npinpoint what it was. But even at, you know, the ripe old age of 12 or 13, during the war,\nthere are things that you perceive that you would not normally otherwise perceive. And it\ndidn't take very long, as I said I think previously on this tape, that, you know, I put two and\ntwo together and began to realize how important it was. And what was the purpose of all\nthese kids coming and going. And some I would never see again, some I would see again,\nmaybe two or three months later. That would be when a hiding place would be blown for\nexample, you know? Then Father Bruno had to go get the child back. People were talking or\nwhatever. Some unfortunate circumstance had taken place and, well, you know, I have my\nlittle six year old grandson here and I'm amazed at how much a little six year old can\nperceive already. So I'm sure that at 12 or 13, all of us were much more aware than people\nthought we were. Even though Father Bruno never said the word, you know.",
        "A: No. No. The only thing that was talked to or talked about was where to go put a letter and\nwhere to take a child. That was all. No, no, no. Not at that time. Even though, you know, I'm\nsure that if I had been put under torture, I would have certainly said what I knew. You know,\nat 12 or 13, you don't resist torture, you have to talk. I'm sure I couldn't have withstood\ntorture. It never happened. I was very lucky. But I'm sure I would have given them more\ninformation than everybody else thought I knew. And I had a couple of cousins who were\nabout my age, who knew almost as much as I did, even though they weren't quite so close to\nFather Bruno because they lived in a different house in a different part of Brussels. But\nnevertheless, they weren't fools, they knew what was going on.",
        "A: Just families. Just mostly families. Occasionally a convent, or occasionally a school, but\nmost of the time, families. And I cannot be sure of that, but I believe that one time I took a\nchild to this extraordinary lady who helped Father Bruno with at least 50 of the children, and\nwas, never asked for any payment except for her train fare and an occasional lunch. And I\nthink I met her then, but that's a little fuzzy in my mind. I can't be absolutely sure. Mostly,\nthese were families or private persons.",
        "A: On foot or in the street car, public transportation. The street cars were the only public\ntransportation available, there were no busses, no gasoline. And, I think we would just talk\nabout usual kid stuff, you know. School or maybe talk about the people around us. Talking\nabout, you know, games or whatever. I think we would just talk about ordinary things.\nNever, definitely never, about deportation, about camps or all that sort of thing. Of course,\nwe didn't know much about the camps anyway. But, not at that time we didn't, but we would\nnever say, oh, your uncle so and so went away. What happened to him? Never. That was\nforbidden.",
        "A: Occasionally, some kids were pretty antsy, yeah. Occasionally. Some of them would be kind\nof, you know, looking around and checking to see if they were being followed and so on.\nMostly the older ones, I mean older, I mean 8, 9, 10 year olds. Not a four or five year olds.\nBut, I think that, yeah, some of the older kids were scared, obviously scared.",
        "A: Well, we tried to, I don't know, what do you do when somebody's scared? You try to talk\nabout something else, distract them, you know. That's all we could do, you know. Or we\nwould just try to interrupt their train of thought by pointing at something, oh, look at that,\nyou know. Something like that. I had, this had nothing to do with Father Bruno, but I had a\nclassmate whose mother was killed in the bombing, bombing by the Americans, by the way.\nAnd every time there was an air raid, he would literally go into a trance, into hysterics. And\nthere was nothing we could do to, you know, to calm him down. He would just shake all\nover and perspire and moan and he never got over that. He never recovered. In fact, he died\nrather miserably ten years ago or something like that. And, so there were times where you\ncouldn't do anything. But this never actually happened to me with one of kids I was\nescorting. No.",
        "A: You're 12, 13 year old. You don't think of risk. You don't think of, you think of it as, you\nthink of it as a new adventure. You think of it as something different, you know, outside of\ngoing to school and doing your homework and going to bed and have breakfast and so on\nand so on. Suddenly, there was something, and you had, you know, sort of a feeling of being\nuseful. Because they were calling upon you to do something. You know. You were no longer\nthe little child playing with his little cars and, toy cars in the corner. You know, you were\npart of the responsibility. So, no. Well, of course, we knew about some, something of the\nrisk. We knew to avoid the Germans as much as possible. But that was even before. I mean,\nwe tried to avoid the Germans, when we saw a group of Germans on the street corner, we\nimmediately changed course and took another street. Even before 1942. We just didn't want\nto, you know, that was, that kind of risk we knew we shouldn't take, we weren't supposed to\ntake a risk by going too close to the enemy. Oh, that's something we acquired immediately.\nAnd our parents certainly re-emphasized that, too. Sure. It's interesting because my first\nexposure with the Nazi military was before World War II and I was in Switzerland with my\nparents in a town that's right at the border, the German border, called Reinfelden(ph). There's\na lovely bridge there. And on one side is a Swiss guard and on the other side is a German\nguard. And I was, I think, seven or eight years old at that time. And, you know, like any kid,\nI ran on the bridge and the Swiss soldier stopped me and said in French, because he'd heard\nwe'd spoke French, he says, don't go there, this guy is bad on the other side. So, the Swiss\ndidn't like the Nazis any more than we did. Even though they spoke German in that area.",
        "A: No. No, my parents knew about it. In fact, we had three Jewish people in our house in a row,\nI mean, success, 1n succession. We had first, I think the first one was a Polish girl. Blond,\nPolish girl who was a little ornery. She was a bit difficult. She didn't want to be cooped up.\nAnd, in fact, she left us. To go with a Belgian policeman. The last we heard, she was\nworking as a, I don't know what you call it, a call girl or something in a tavern. Not far from\nour house. Where German officers went. I guess that fact that she was blond and blue eyed\ndidn't tip off the Germans that she was Jewish. Then we had a large German, no, yes,\nGerman woman, but from East Germany. And she was very, very scared. She was very, very\nscared. She stayed with us for about, I think, three months and then Father Bruno came and\ntook her out and took her away. And then we had another woman and she told us all kinds of\nfunny stories. She told us the stories of Laurel and Hardy movies. In French. And on the\nLiberation Day, September 3, 1944, she ran to her room, picked up her suitcase, she only had\none suitcase, packed up, ran out the door and we never saw her again. I don't know what\nhappened to her. She was just so elated she was free again, that she just ran out the door. So\nthat was the last, the last one I ever saw actually.",
        "A: Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. The nuns did in their convent in Liesch(ph). The other nun, who was at\nthat time in Brussels, no, no, she was in Schlovese(ph), another small town. That convent\nalso hid a couple of kids. My parents did. My father did surgery on a couple of Jewish kids.\nAnother anecdote. He had a small child who had appendicitis, put him in the open ward\nbecause that's the way hospitals were at that time. Maybe 20 patients in an open ward. And,\nbelieve it or not, a German soldier had a bad car accident right in front of the hospital. So,\ninstead of taking him to the military hospital which was the other side of the city, they took\nhim to my father's ward. So, at one end we had the Jewish child with appendicitis, at the\nother end we had an injured German soldier. But, you know what? It turned out to be a sort\nof a protection. Because this guy was there lying, he was there for at least a week before they\ntransported him to the military hospital, well, there was a constant flow of friends and\nofficers coming to comfort him and bring him candy and flowers and so on and so on. They\nwouldn't pay any attention to the rest of the ward. And there wouldn't be any searches during\nthat time.\nEnd of Tape #3\nTape #4",
        "A: Not specifically aimed at Father Bruno's network. More like the general population. Yes. For\nexample, we had a big house and I didn't like the house, but that's neither here nor there, it\nused to belong, a hundred years ago, no a hundred and fifty years ago, to twin brothers who\nwere wine merchants and they had cellars that were two level cellars, like in a sub-basement,\nif you want, basement and sub-basement. All of these were vaulted, almost like a cathedral.\nAnd because of that, we had the visit of the air defense people who came and looked at our\nplace and they said, well, this 1s a pretty safe basement. It can probably resist most of the\nnormal bombs that were available in those days. Would you be willing to open that up to the\npublic? And we did. And so, yes there were numbers of people from our neighborhood who\nwould come during air raids and, actually, it turned out sometimes to be a rather, rather fun.\nBecause they would bring their food and we would share their food and we would share with\nthem our food. And in that cellar, I must tell you, that there were still some bottle of wine.\nAnd I'm sure the neighbors enjoyed those quite a bit. And there was an air intake, a sort of a\ncolumn about a foot and a half in diameter which let the air in and opened up in our back\nyard and I was the air raid signaler. I was in charge of listening if I could hear the airplanes\nand if I did, I would say, they are coming, they are coming. And also to warn them when it\nwas the end of alarm signal, so everybody could go home. That was my duty at that time. So,\nthis is a memory I keep, you know, very vivid. And other than that, well, yeah, distributing\nwhatever little food we had to some other people who had even less. My mother did that, but\nshe did that mostly as part of her duties in that blind people organization. And my great aunt,\nwho was my mother's aunt, was also the president of that same organization. Took me\naround a number of times during the war to help her carry packages and that sort of thing.\nYeah. But that wasn't, you know, was not directly connected to saving the Jewish people.\nThat was mostly just ordinary being nice to people. Oh, I might mention that even though\nmy wife's family had no connection with the Jewish movement, they did hide non-Jewish\nresistance in their attic. That gave rise to a rather hair raising occasion because one of them\nalso got appendicitis, but how are you going to get that guy out of the attic when, you know,\nin a neighborhood where everyone knew everything about everybody. So, what they did,\nthey waited until it was dark, called the ambulance, had my wife's sister climb on the\nstretcher with the guy, covering both of them so that only her head would be visible, put the\nstretcher in the ambulance and took the whole thing to the hospital. So, of course, my sister-\nin-law had to stay away from the house for at least a week because they kept people in the\nhospital for at least a week after appendectomy in those days. And then to bring the man\nback was another thing because at that time he could walk so it wasn't so difficult, but again,\nthey had to be very careful at night. And there was an asthmatic woman living right across,\nbecause those were row houses, and she would always open her window during the night to\ntake a breath of fresh air. And they had to wait until she closed the window before any\nmovement could occur in the street.",
        "A: Who, well. Father Bruno was the driving force. The leader. He was also the person having\nno children who adamantly said that he was taking all the responsibility on his back.\nWhether that would have served, you know, or helped, I'm not sure because the Nazis were\nsmarter than that. But, at least he said, I want to take all the responsibility and I will have you\nhelp me, but I will never mention you or anything. But he got his mother involved, my\ngrandmother, my father, who was a surgeon. My younger uncle who was a dentist. My uncle\nby marriage who was the finance man. And his three sisters who were nuns. But, that was\nonly a very small part of the network. Because he had to have a lot more help than that. So,\nhe got quite a number of assistants either permanently or occasionally. Some of them were\nJewish, some of them were not. He did all kinds of visits himself to the families where he\nwanted the children to be hidden and in the little book that we wrote there is that famous\nstory of the University professor in Louvan(ph), Belgtum who was a devout Catholic and my\nuncle went to see him and told him all that was happening. And the man said, you know, I\nhonestly am not aware of this. But, my duty as a Christian is to help you. When are you\ngoing to bring me a child? And, you know, that sort of thing, of course, was very comforting\nfor him. He said when he went to Israel after the war, that no one actually shut the door on\nhim. So, he did have a few, well, misadventures where some kid didn't get along with a\nfamily or, particularly, adults sometimes were a little independent and the family would\nconsider them as being servants. And they wouldn't like that. So, there were a few, but I\nwould say not more than five or six such incidents occurred. And the vast majority of the\npeople were just welcoming and opened their arms, you know, and their families to Father\nBruno. But I would say that there were probably more than several hundred people involved\neventually. Because you know, three hundred twenty and maybe more children, we don't\nknow exactly how many there were, Flora thinks, Flora Singer, thinks there was about three\nhundred and fifty. That may be a little too much. We don't know. Because, obviously, for\nsecurity reasons, Father Bruno couldn't keep accurate records during the war. So all the\nrecords he had were little notes he made in a certain code which, after the war, he then\ntransferred to a more elaborate ledger. And so he lost track of a few of them. So we know for\nsure of about three hundred and twenty. And since each child probably had to be moved,\none, two, three, up to five times, well, just count and you'll see that would imply probably\nsomething like a thousand transfers. You know? Not, there were sometimes the same\nfamilies taking different children. But, most of the time they, you know when there was too\nmuch talking or too much something going on that might give it away, he had to find new\nfamilies all the time. And so, his personal network included probably the eight or nine people\nof his family and as many close collaborators or friends as that. Like eight or nine, maybe\nten. Close associates. But, then, you know, there were hundreds of families that were\ninvolved that should not be forgotten or neglected. You know?",
        "A: Well, that was sort of a happenstance because he was sent as a chaplain, he was requested to\ncome as a chaplain, in a small school for the blind in the southern part of Belgium called\nHodbomo(ph). And when he got there he discovered that there were some blind children, but\nthat most of the occupants there were Jewish. Including the director. And that, you know, it\njust, he just saw the light immediately. But, he had, in 1938, taken a trip in Germany. I told\nyou that he was a mobile Benedictine and he was in Frankfurt in a busy street and he saw\npeople just haggling and harassing or annoying and pushing someone. And he got closer and\nhe saw an old Jewish man who was dressed like most Orthodox people were with a big black\nhat and caftan and so on and you know what I mean. And they were spitting at him and\npushing him and that absolutely tore him apart. But, obviously, being in Germany, he\ncouldn't do a thing about it. You know? He couldn't go to the rescue of the man. If 1t had\nbeen in Belgium, he probably would have, but not in Germany. And he never forgot that\nincident. And when he got to Hodbomo, that little school for the blind, he said, well, now I\nrealize the full impact of what I saw in Germany and he decided to help. And he didn't help\nbecause they were Jews. He helped because they were people. He said, I don't care if they\nhad been Africans, if they had been Japanese, if they had been Papu(ph), I would have done\nthe same thing. He didn't, perhaps he knew more about the Jews than he did about other\npeople, which made it a little easier for him to understand. But, he was mostly concerned\nabout human beings, about people. And he said, you know, I have to do something to save\nthose people. I don't care what they are, who they are, I have to save those people. They are\noppressed. They are persecuted. My duty, as a Christian, is to help them and try to save them\nif I can. Then, at Hodbomo, he got in contact with Albert Vandenburg(ph) who was a lawyer\nin Liesch(ph) and was the executive director of the camps for sickly and destitute children of\nthe archdiocese of Liesch whose bishop was Bishop Kerkopfs(ph) at that time. And they\nstarted working together and Vandenburg was very happy to find someone like Father Bruno\nwho was, you know, free of family, in a way. Didn't have any children and so on, and was\nwilling to do anything to help. And then, unfortunately, Albert Vandenburg was taken by the\nGestapo. At first for having forged identity cards and that was actually under the jurisdiction\nof the military government. And he was condemned to three months in jail and he was very\nhappy that he didn't have more than that, get more than that. And he got out of jail and the\nGestapo was waiting outside. Took him again. Sent him to Bergen Belsen where he finally,\nwell, nobody exactly knows how or when he died, but he must have died, perhaps even, after\nthe liberation of the camp, of typhus. Which was, at that time and even now actually, is a\ndeadly disease. And so, Father Bruno took over and went on his own and started his network\nby contacting various people. Some of the people he already knew from the camps because\nthey were helpers in the camps and this way he was able to place a few children. But, the\nfirst month I think, he must have had four or five requests in addition to the, oh, I forgot to\nmention that the school became very unsafe because in the village people began talking, I'm\nsure quite innocently, there were no traitors, but they were talking. And talking, as I said, is\nvery dangerous. You know, the enemy has ears everywhere. So, the first thing that Father\nBruno and Albert, who was still alive then, had to do was move the children to other places.\nSo right there, they had 25 kids that they had to get rid of from that school. So they placed\nthose, the early ones, they placed in convents or, again, in the camps. But even that became\nunsafe because, again, people began talking and there were raids and in one of the raids,\nthere were some adults who were also in the camps and they were arrested and sent to\nconcentration camps. One of the adults who was there was the Grand Rabbi of Liesch, by the\nname of Lepkifka(ph). And he escaped but his parents went to and died in concentration\ncamp. And so after the war, he did a lot to publicize the work of Vandenburg and...I'm sorry.",
        "A: What's up?",
        "A: Alright. You know, to publicize the work of Vandenburg and, incidentally, of Father Bruno\nas well. They knew each other quite well. As a matter of fact, the sisters who were running\nthe camp were full of praise for the extreme righteousness and religiousness of this rabbi\nwho was very broad minded at the same time. So, that did a lot to smooth any possible\ndifferences that might have occurred under his guidance. And then you, I think you were\nasking me how he got to do that. Well, then people heard about his work and they came with\nrequests, you know. Oh, Mrs. so and so has two children and she would like to place them in\nsafety. And the first month he got maybe four, five or six of them. Eventually after a few\nmonths, I think it was in July of '43, his largest number was, I believe, 24 requests in a\nmonth. That doesn't sound like much, but when you realize that he had to go on his bicycle\nacross Belgium, you know, 24 times to find families to bring papers, to bring food, to bring\nthe child. It was a day and night job. You know, he worked 18 hours a day. And sometimes\nmore. He said after the war that he had crisscrossed Belgrum 40 times the distance that the\nbicycle racers do for the tour of Belgtum now. So, that give you an idea of how much\nbicycling he did.",
        "A: Well, in Belgium, as opposed to some of the eastern European countries, the majority of the\nCatholic church was helpful. The Cardinal, the Primate of Belgium, Cardinal VanLouie(ph),\nhad directive, if you want, or directions that, to be very cautious. But he did several times,\nissue bulletins saying that, you know, I will not, I will close my eyes if you do this. I will do,\nI will not interfere if you do that. In other words, he was giving them free rein without\nsaying, I want you to save the Jews. Because that would immediately have put him in jail\nright there. And he couldn't do that. And it's the same thing that they said about Pope Pius\nXXII, this is maybe a controversial subject, but I'm very, very positive on that because my\nparents were married by Cardinal Mikar(ph) who became a very good friend of them and he\nbecame the Secretary of State of Pius XXII, and he told my parents and me, specifically, that\nthe Pope was very sympathetic and that according to the records, the Vatican itself saved\naround 20,000 Jewish people. Including the Grand Rabbi of Rome who was at the Vatican\nduring the war. Now there have been many books written and criticizing him a lot because\nhe didn't do enough. But, again, you know, you have to look at this from different angles. It,\nthere is no question that if he had been very, very strong, Hitler was all prepared to invade\nthe Vatican. And take the Pope prisoner. He couldn't have done anything any more at that\ntime. So, in other words, what he did 1n a concealed way, was probably more useful than if\nhe had spoken very loudly and been very outspoken about it. They said he was a friend of\nthe Germans. Yes, that's true. He had been the Ambassador of the Pope in Munich for\nseveral years and he really liked the people of Germany. But, he abhorred Nazism. In fact,\none of his encyclical(ph) letters was directed at the Nazis and condemning it without\nreservation.",
        "A: Well, you know, let's say that in my environment, it wasn't the case. I cannot speak for all the\nBelgians, but in my environment, it was not the case. And from what I've been reading and\nfrom what I've heard and discussed with other people, this was a lot less prevalent in Holland\nand in Belgium than, for example, in Poland. Because in Poland, even now, there is still a\ngreat hostility between the non-Jews and the Jews. Let's face it. That was not the case in\nBelgium. It was not the case in Holland, either. I want to say here that we never knew\nexactly how many Jews were in Belgium because people were not registered as to their race,\nreligion, creed or anything else. We figure that there were probably, including all the\nrefugees from the east, in 1938, '39 and even early in 1940, there were probably something\nlike 70,000. Only about 30,000 survived. And that was better than Holland. Where only, I\nthink, only maybe 20 or 15 percent survived. So, the Dutch were not as lucky as we were.\nThey had this SS Golighter(ph) from the very beginning and that was very, very dramatic.\nVery sad, tragic.\nEnd of Tape #4\nTape #5",
        "A: As far as administration, you could say it was a one man operation. He did have assistants.\nHe had people helping him find families. He had people taking care of false identification\npapers and that sort of thing. But as far as administration, he was it. He had all the power and\nall the responsibility. As far as finance is concerned, he was a Benedictine Monk, and all his\npossessions were on his body. That is his cassock and maybe his handkerchief and that was\nabout it. He got support from various families who were not willing to take a child, but were\nwilling to contribute. But, of course, the biggest support he got was from the\n. The largest bank in Belgium whose director we called governor in\nthose days. Was Mr. Gallopan, he was fiercely anti-Nazi. And he committed himself to\ncontributing a large amount of money each month to Father Bruno. It may not have been\nquite enough to cover all the expenses, but it was an extremely significant help. Mr.\nGallopan guaranteed those payments monthly and the payments were collected by Jack\nDupon(ph) who was Father Bruno's brother-in-law. Another uncle of mine. And he\ncontinued doing that until the liberation. Unfortunately, poor Mr. Gallopan was a victim of\nNazi thugs who one day came and rang his doorbell and said, are you Mr. Gallopan? And he\nsaid, yes. And they just killed him on the spot with a blast of submachine gun, right in front\nof his wife.

        "A: Well, there was, of course, the CDJ, which was a committee for the defense of the Jews, the\ninitials are the same in English as in French, . Who was very active\nand collaborated very closely with Father Bruno. The problem with that is, like it was in\nFrance, some of the leaders of that group were, how shall I say, were persuaded by the\nGermans to cooperate with them. But, of course, the ultimate idea was not at all cooperation,\nit was to get all the information they could get. And so, Father Bruno was a little bit reluctant\nto associate directly with the CDJ because he knew there were files and reams of paper that\ncould be found and were found by the Gestapo leading to the arrest of quite a number of\npeople. Fortunately, most of the members of CDJ escaped death. Several went to various\ncamps, but they didn't die. One of them was Mrs. Jospa(ph) who was one of the closest\ncollaborators of Father Bruno and is still alive now, as a matter of fact. And there were\nseveral others who were both in the armed resistance and in the peaceful resistance. Because\nFather Bruno always said, I'm going to be resistance, but I'm going to be a peaceful\nresistance. I will never bear arms. Which he didn't. But some of the actual armed resistance\ndid cooperate with the peaceful resistance for various reasons and there were several of\nthose, one of them was killed in action and another one died, I believe, after the liberation in\nan unfortunate accident, in the army at that time.",
        "A: The coordination was on a person to person basis mostly. They were, the CDJ had visitors,\nor visiting people I should say, who visited the children at various places. And they would\nreport to the CDJ, but also to Father Bruno. And the CDJ had a committee that was\nspecifically organized to do that, to keep track of the kids that were placed. But that was\nprecisely one of the dangers that Father Bruno feared. That there was too much\ndocumentation. And so he tried to cooperate with them as close as he could, but without any\nwritten documentation, without papers. He would handle only cash, never checks. Or just,\nyou know, items, like butter or meat or something. But he would not use things that could be\ntraced, such as checks or various deposit slips and that sort of thing. He would meet with the\nrepresentatives of the CDJ in a neutral environment, but there were never any records written\nof their discussion, except when he was called to the committee of the CDJ as a guest. Then\nthey kept their records, but he always insisted, he said, don't put my name on your records.\nNot that I'm afraid for me, but if they catch me, my entire network is gone. So, they didn't put\nhis name on the records. This actually caused some confusion after the war because he said, I\nwas at that meeting. And they would pull the records and say, well, you're name is not on it.\nAnd, but that was deliberate. So, there was a loose cooperation, but there was cooperation.\nAnd in fact, a fairly extensive, but loose, if you see what I mean? It wasn't, you know, like in\nan army where the corporal refers to the sergeant, the sergeant refers to the second lieutenant\nand so on and so forth. It was a loose cooperation. They would have meetings that were\ninformal where decisions were made only verbally and that actually added to the security of\nthe network.",
        "A: There was some Protestants but, you know, Belgium has very few Protestants actually. But\nthere were several Protestant ministers involved. Indeed. But to go back to the Catholic\nclergy. There was a whole network of priests who worked either directly or indirectly with\nFather Bruno. One of the best known was Father Andre(ph) from Namir(ph) who, you know,\nat the greatest risk, always had something like 10, 12, 15, up to 25 kids in his own house in\nNamir. And here's another one of those extremely bizarre coincidences. Father Bruno did not\nhave a house or an apartment where he could, you know, which he could call his base. Until\na spinster of a certain age allowed him to use a little house she had on the square in the\nmiddle of Brussels. Because she wasn't using it and it wasn't being rented. It was a very\nsmall house. On the left side was a cafe with horse betting, what do you call that? You know\nwhat I mean. Anyway, horse betting. On the other side was a of the SS,\nwho was working on the Gestapo Jewish files of New Louise(ph) in Brussels. But that\nturned out, again, to be a sort of a protection. Because he was right next to this important\nNazi officer and they never ever considered the little house in between there. And the second\ncoincidence, Father Andre in Namir had, on his left, a cafe with horse betting and on his\nright a portion of the Commandant , which was not SS, but it was German\narmy. Can you imagine a more bizarre coincidence than that? Father Andre did an awful lot\nof work and he deserves all the credit. I think he is on the list at the museum, also. Deserves\nall the credit. And until the end of the war, he was constantly at risk of being caught. There\nwere many other priests, I won't give you all the names. First of all, I can't remember them\nright now, one of them was Count , who was an aristocrat of a very old\nBelgian family who was a pastor of a church in Brussels. He, too, took care of several kids.\nHe was a friend of my father's actually. And there were quite a number of other clergymen.\nAnd nuns, of course, too. Flora Singer was hidden in a convent of nuns. It wasn't always a\npleasant life because the nuns themselves don't have a very pleasant life. Very strict and\nduring the war there wasn't enough food for everybody and they had to, you know, to share\nwhat food they had with everybody, including the Jewish girls, usually girls, who were\nhidden there. So some of the girls have bad memories of having to wash the dishes and of\nbeing cold in their beds because the central heating wasn't working. There was no coal. And\nat that time, central heating was mostly coal fired. We didn't have any oil. Even if it had been\noil fired, they wouldn't have had any oil to put in there anyway. So, yeah, the conditions\nwere not always pleasant. But, what's the alternative?",
        "A: You know, that was one of the most hair raising problems, of course. To get enough food\nand clothing. Partly it was contributions from people who had enough food, just enough and\nmaybe a little more than just enough. That was only a small part. I think most of the sources\nwere actually legal sources done illegally. In other words, there was, for example, the wife of\nthe same professor at the University of Louvan(ph) who at night went, would you believe, to\nburglarize the office of rationing, the rationing department. And stole reams of food stamps.\nNow, you couldn't have just food stamps because you also had to have a card to go with\nthem. That was a precaution the Germans took so that that very thing wouldn't happen. So,\nthey had to forge food cards. And in the book that, the new book that we wrote about Father\nBruno, there is a sample of one of those food cards. Strangely enough, one of the best forgers\nwas an old monk in Father Bruno's abbey, , very, very adorable old father\nwho would never have done a thing like that in his life if he hadn't been persuaded by Father\nBruno that he was doing humanitarian work. He said, I can't be a forger. But, he did and he\nwas probably the best of all. So, they forged hundreds of food cards. They also had to forge\nidentity cards to go along with food cards because, unlike the United States, most European\ncountries demand that their citizens bear an identity card on them all the time. At least after\nage 12. So, you know, they had to, we had to forge identity cards with false names, false\nplaces of birth and false dates of birth so that nothing could be traced. One time Father Bruno\nwas at an open market, there was an open flea market in Brussels in the center of the city,\nand he was looking, I think, for old clothes or something like that. And he had his briefcase\nwith him full of blank identity cards. And, sure enough, as he walked away, there was a\ncheck point with two , who were there and were searching peoples suitcases as\nwell as checking the papers. And he had a false identity card himself which said that he was\nan employee of the government. And he managed to persuade those numskulls that he was\ntaking work home because he needed to finish some cards for the next day. And they let him\ngo. Now, you had to be pretty thick to let that happen. But they did. That was one of his\nclose escapes. He had a few more, but that was one of them. And, so, ration cards, food\nstamps, stolen. It was very difficult to produce false food stamps, 1t was almost impossible.\nYou had to have the glue, you had to have special colors and so on and so on, so they were\nstolen, they were not falsified. Identity cards, on the other hand, were pre-printed and then\nthey filled in the name by hand. So once you had the pre-printed card, it wasn't too difficult\nto falsify a card as long as you had one of the city rubber stamps or one of those embossing\nstamps. That worked. If you were lucky. There was always a problem because, you know,\nyou had to have a signature on that and if somebody was pretty bright, which didn't often\nhappen in the SS, thank goodness, they could have made the person reproduce their\nsignature. You know, since many of those were young kids, maybe 14, 15 years old, they\ncould have done a bad job of reproducing their signature and that would have given away the\nfalsification. So, identity cards, food cards, ration stamps and mostly, occasionally a, what do\nyou call it, a welfare check. But he didn't like that because, again, that could be traced. Most\nof the time the money, as I said, came either from the bank or from private contributions.",
        "A: Yes. Yes. He had, fortunately, many, many of the Belgian civil service employees were\nfaithful, were reliable. They were anti-German and he knew which were and which were not.\nHe had a number of helpers, mostly in the municipal governments where it was most\nimportant. Because that's where the stamps and the cards were issued. One day he went in\nthis particular municipal office where he had an appointment with the assistant chief and a\nlady seemed to be in a hurry and, because he was very courteous, he said, okay, go in first.\nShe went in, took her time, and he saw two people just babbling or talking about various\npapers there and then it was his turn and one of the guys walked away, went away. Picked up\nhis suitcase, his briefcase, and went away. And when he got near the assistant chief, he said,\nyou don't know, but I'm sweating here. That man who just left was from the Gestapo. If you\nhad come in at your turn instead of letting the lady go in first, we would have been both\ncaught. So, another close escape. But, this was help he got from the civil service or the\nemployees of the government, various governments.",
        "A: I think all three. I think it varied on the person. You may even add one. Money. Because\nmany rescuers were given money. And during the war, money was very tight. And some\npeople would take this terrible risk just to get a little more money to survive. But, I would\nsay, all three. Idealism, you know, I want to save the Jewish children. Charisma from Father\nBruno. And, you know as you said, all these three possibilities plus, I think, a certain appeal\nfor money at times.",
        "A: Transportation. Not to be caught. Because some kids had to be transported from one end of\nBelgium to the other. And even though Belgium is a small country, that still represented 200\nmiles sometimes and the trains during the war were extremely slow and rare. And so, it may\nhave taken a whole day to do 200 miles by train. You know, getting the children registered\nin a certain municipality with a false ID card. It was difficult unless you had cooperation\nfrom the local authorities. And once or twice, there was a close call because he would have\nhelp from one of the employees and then the mayor of that particular municipality would be\neither scared or maybe even pro-German. And they would get wind of the thing and\nimmediately the child would have to be moved away. That was one of the logistical\ndifficulties, too. And then as I say, as I said previously, the stealing food stamps, you didn't\njust barge in those municipal offices and pick your choice of stamps. You know, it had to be\ndone extremely carefully at night, sometimes it was done with the complicity of the\nemployee who would leave the door open, for example. Not lock the door. And pretend to go\nhome as usual. And then a few hours later, somebody else would come in and sneak in and\nsteal. And even getting the blank identity cards was sometimes difficult. Perhaps less\ndifficult than the food cards. Logistics. Getting clothing. Getting a child registered in school\nbecause these kids had to continue their education during the war. I mean, they couldn't just\nstay for a year or even two years without any schooling. So, to have them accepted in school\nwas not all that hard, but, there were school inspections and the authorities, the occupant\nauthorities would know how many kids had to be there, and where did the extra one come\nfrom? So when they suspected there would be an inspection, they would, perhaps either tell\nthe Jewish child to stay home or another child to stay home, or another child. You know, the\nteacher would say, oh, you've been sneezing three times today, why don't you go home? And\nthe kid would be most happy to do that and the parents say, oh, what's going on here? Well,\nwe think he may have a cold, keep him home for a day or two. So, that would bring the\nnumber back to normal. There were a few interesting incidents, too, because of the language\nproblem. Quite a number of these kids were from Eastern Europe. And even the Belgian\nJews sometimes spoke Yiddish. And one incident occurred in a school in the Waloon(ph)\npart of Belgium, in the southern part of Belgium, and the school inspector came who was,\nunfortunately, paid by the Germans and he checked the children and one of the Jewish kids\nwas there and the inspector spoke to him and he said, do you speak French? And the kid\nsaid, yeah, of course. Alright do you speak other languages? Oh, yeah, I speak Flemish. And\nthen the guy, sneaky as he was, said, well, what do you speak at home? Oh, Yiddish. [sharp\nintake of breath] That was it. He gave it away. But, apparently, as far as I know, the child\ndid not get taken. Because the teacher was fast enough to make him go away immediately\nbefore the authorities had the time to go and fill their papers and, you know, send another\ncrew to arrest him and so on. Somehow, apparently that incident could have been terrible,\nyou know, passed away without any major trouble. But, you never know, little children, even\nthough they've been trained and trained, they will do things that are beyond their control. A\nlittle girl in a train with one of the, what do you call them, the escorts, was talking to a nice\ngentleman across from her on the seat. And he said, what's your name? And she said, do you\nwant my real name or the other? And, fortunately, the gentleman, obviously was not\nsympathetic to the Germans because he didn't say anything, he just kept quiet. But, see how,\nyou know, alarms can just pop up like that without any warning.\nEnd of Tape #5\nTape #6",
        "A: Like what happens in an emergency, for example. Well, there really wasn't any set system.\nAgain, for obvious security reasons, there couldn't be a certain list where in this case, you\ncall this person, in that case, you call that person. It was strictly a word of mouth affair. And\none person would call the next person who would call the third person who would try to find,\nplease find Father Bruno, he's on his way to such and such town, as soon as he gets there, tell\nhim there is an emergency. And he would get back to the responsible person and see what to\ndo in that particular case. One of the cases that I mentioned in the book there, was a little girl\nwho, in spite of all the instructions, wrote a letter to her mother, who was still in Belgium.\nShe had not been deported. She wrote a letter, the mother found, oh before I go any further, I\nhave to tell you that the parents usually did not know where their kids were. Most of the time\nthey were not told. Obviously, again, for security reasons. For obvious security reasons. Well\nanyway, this little girl had written to her mother, the mother was so anxious to see her that\nshe took the train, went to Gent(ph) and, for some reason, had the foolish idea of taking two\nor three leather purses with her because her husband was a leather worker. And she was\nhoping to sell those to pay for her train trip. She walked into a purse, what do you call those\nstores where they sell purses? In French they call them . Anyway, she went\nin and offered her purses for sale to the man who, I think he even bought them. The man was\none of the representatives of the Flemish pro-German group in Gent. So, the mother went to\nthe convent which was strictly forbidden. And the sisters, in a panic, called two or three\npersons and the chain got into operation and the little girl was taken away after she did see\nher mother, I have to say, to a secret other place and the sisters simply had to give up\nkeeping Jewish girls because the mother had told this man why she was in Gent. You know,\nsometimes people's brains don't function too well. But, anyway, that kind of emergency\noccurred a fair number of times. One time, again you can read that if you want in the\nbiography, there were three kids who were in a home for Jewish children which was\ncompletely under German control. And Father Bruno wanted those kids to escape. And, well\nto make a long story short, he arranged for them to have diphtheria, quote unquote, and they\nwere immediately transferred to the hospital because of a call, again through the chain,\nsaying that, well, the Germans were terribly afraid of diphtheria, they had to take those\ncontagious children out of the home and isolate them. So they did that. And, again the chain\nworked, when they were so called cured, they never had been sick in the first place, Mrs.\nRuspa(ph) and a couple of other people took the three children, made a release letter in three\ncopies, gave one to the hospital, mailed one to the home, because the Germans had said, now\nit's time to go get those children, and have the doctor release them. Well, they mailed one,\nbut in the meantime, before the mail got to the home which would take at least 24 hours, the\nchildren were far away and they kept the third release copy. This was one of the most movie-\nlike episodes because they had to enlist the help of the doctors, of the nurses, of the\nbacteriologist who falsified the cultures. Of the bacteriologist, again, who had to say they\nwere cured. Of the person who made the release letter, who said they could be picked up.\nAnd knew perfectly well they were not going to be picked up because they were already\ngone. You know, all of these episodes, if one of them failed, that was the end of it. But,\nnothing failed, everything worked fine. What other logistical things were we talking about,\nagain?",
        "A: Oh, yes. Well, how did they find Father Bruno? Occasionally, through the CDJ, but most of\nthe time a simple word of mouth. Mrs. Abraham on this floor would talk to Sarah on the\nother floor and say, you know, I know this Catholic monk who took my cousin's little\ndaughter and hid her. You're in danger, they're looking after you there, they're trying to find\nyou. Why don't you ask him to hide your little daughter. And they would do that. Family\nmembers. Sometimes out of the blue. He would never know where or how those people\nwould have got his name. Which was a bit distressing because, he said, if some totally\nunknown person got my name, who else got my name? And, as a matter of fact, there was\none time when he was going 1n one of the streets in Brussels to go collect a little boy, I think,\nand as he was turning the corner, he saw a black car stopping in front there and he knew that\nwas the Gestapo. And they got the boy. He never had the boy. He never had this child, didn't\nput his hand on the child once. But, they got the child. That was very sad. That was one of\nhis most sad experiences, even though it wasn't really one of his proteges, he hadn't gotten\nthe child yet. But, someone had babbled and that was it. Then, we were talking about\nemotional issues. That was a big problem. Many of these children, of course, didn't want to\nleave their parents. Some of them were old enough to understand what was going on and\nthey would try to make do. The little ones, you know, the three or four or two year old ones,\nit was a very, very sad, very difficult thing to handle. Particularly for Father Bruno who had\nnever had any children of his own. And this was one of the reasons why he was known to\nkeep track of his, quote unquote, kids by going to visit them all the time. In addition to\nlooking for new places, he kept track of the old places. And one of the most intimate friends\nof Father Bruno, a friendship which continued after the war, was the Rotmeal(ph) brothers\nwho are now in this country. And they describe when he would come to the farm where they\nwere hidden, and one day he would come with his cassock and the next time he would come\nwith green pants, you know, those pants that they wear to play golf, I forget, knickers. With\ngreen knickers and then Bernard would say, why are you wearing that? Well, I'm not Father\nBruno any more, I'm Mr. so and so. He had several identities. And his last identity was Msr.\nRenau(ph), you know Renau in French means fox. And it was kind of play on words, of\ncourse, because he out-foxed them all the time. And he said, no, Iam Msr. Renau, you don't\nknow me as Father Bruno any more. And he would visit them as often as he could. But, of\ncourse, when there are 300 of them, he couldn't see them every day. But, he would keep\ntrack precisely for those emotional reasons. Because he had a charisma and he inspired\nconfidence to the, at least to the children old enough to understand. And they would really\nget very, very attached to him. And knowing that he was going to come back sort of soothed\ntheir anxieties. And made them, you know, accept the separation a little bit better. He made a\nbig point of that.",
        "A: Well, again, it's word of mouth. And occasionally, as we said before, by the CDJ, the\nCommittee for the Defense of Jews. Frequently, Father Bruno himself would just go and talk\nto those people. Like the University professor I mentioned. He would just go in their house\nand say, I want you to help. And he had this way of talking to people that they couldn't say\nno. You know, when I was a little boy and I wasn't being very good, all he had to do 1s say,\nnow, you're going to have to do it. And we did. You know. Both my sister and my brother\nand I, all he had to say is, I want you to do this. And we would do it. Even if we had been\nvery bad with our parents.",
        "A: Yeah. Well, he approached people after, you know, carefully selecting them. People he knew\nwere trustworthy and people he had known for a long time. His close friends. Or people who\nwere guaranteed by others. There was always a risk. There was always a risk. Accepting a\nJewish child from a family was a risk. Not for the Germans, where the Germans were\nconcerned. But what if that person was a traitor? What if the child was not Jewish and was\njust being used as a, you know, a trap. You know? There was always a risk. But, for some\nreason, he must have had, he must have been a good judge of character, because the only\ntime he almost got caught was when this dreadful traitor, so called Captain Jackson who was\nnot a Captain Jackson, he was a Belgian by the name of Bziter(ph). Convened a so called\nresistance group and he refused to go because he smelled a rat. And all the people who went,\nwent to concentration camp. And he didn't go. Because he smelled a rat. So, you know, he\nhad a sixth sense that made him know when people were genuine or not.",
        "A: No. That was, these arrests were made in Male(ph) in Belgium. Male(ph) Mechalen(ph)\nwhich is city between Brussels and Antwerp. No. And there were several of his assistants\nwho went there and they got caught. But I don't think they died in the concentration camp.\nBut, that's neither here nor there, I mean, they could have. They were trapped by this traitor\nwho was shot after the war. He was condemned by a military court and shot.",
        "A: Yeah. Well, that was early in the game, actually. Early in the game when he was only\nbeginning his network. He was still at the abbey and they came and searched the abbey at\nMossesar from top to bottom. He managed to hide a bunch of papers in a chimney and,\nagain, those numskulls didn't even think of looking in there. But, he hid them in a secret door\nor trap in the chimney and they never found anything. But that's when the superior of the\nabbey said, listen, I have 80 monks here and their my responsibility. I can't have you have\nyour base of work, I approve of what you're doing, but I can't let you have your base here at\nthe monastery. Because the next time they come, they will find something and we'll all go to\nBruckenvald(ph) or whatever. And, so, that's when he moved out of the abbey. But that was\nstill fairly early in the game, that was in 1942. And he then rented a small apartment in\nLuvan(ph) and that became unsafe, too. And he then rented another apartment 1n Brussels,\nwhich he kept for a few months. And then came the little house from that lady between the\nand the horse betting institution.",
        "A: Well, he was given dispensation from mandatory celebration of Mass every Sunday by his\nsuperiors. They realized that he couldn't do that. But, whenever he had a chance, he would\ngo to my grandmother's house and in the attic he had a tiny little alter which he built himself\nand he would celebrate Mass for us there. That's one of the very vivid memories I keep of all\nof us, you know, really tightly packed in that tiny little attic and him just having barely space\nto turn around and speak to us. That I remember very vividly. So, he did as much as he could\nbut it's quite obvious that sometimes he had to do without. You know, if on Sunday morning\nhe had an emergency, well, that went before celebrating Mass. And he had permission not to.",
        "A: Afterwards, after the war when I was old enough to really grasp the danger and the risk, I\nwas terrified. I said, my gosh, we did all that? And then when that time passed, I said, why,\nI'm very happy we did. I felt very good. I said, well, I didn't do much, but at least I was part\nof that and I'm so proud of having his name, bearing his name. You know, that's something\nthat is, 1t remains with you all your life because not so many people are given that\nopportunity to help. And to do it willingly. That, now I shouldn't be overly proud because I\ndid so little, but when I think of my family, I'm still pretty proud. You know, we all took\nrisks, especially the adults, they risked their lives of course, and there were close calls. We\nwere lucky. I guess we were blessed in our efforts.",
        "A: I'm not so sure. I don't want to elaborate too much on that because there were some slightly\nunpleasant moments. Most of them were very happy moments. Kids finding remainders of\ntheir families. There were very sad moments in that happiness because they knew that their\nparents and grandparents had died. But they were happy to return to a family. Some people\ndidn't even, some kids didn't have a family to go back to. Some of them were kept in\nconvents where they were and they were in slightly better condition because the rationing\nwas over. And some of them stayed in school. Some of them had requested to be baptized,\nbut that, oh, I want to insist on this point. This is a point that Father Bruno was\nextraordinarily touchy about. He absolutely refused to put any pressure on any Jewish child\nto change his religion. To convert, quote unquote. That he was adamant about. He said we\nare to save them, but their souls do not belong to us. That was one of his principles. And, but\nsome of them who were, you know, exposed to the liturgy and to maybe some slightly, you\nknow, warmer person in the Catholic church, wanted to, there were about five or six of them\nwho wanted to be baptized and that was a big point of contention. Because he actually did\nnot want to baptize them unless he had the total guarantee that first of all, the parents wanted\nit if they were still alive. Second, that they would have accepted it if they, none of them did,\nbut had previously made that allowance or permission if you want, and that his superiors\nwere in agreement, too. And I think there were about five out of the 320 or something who\nwere baptized and I think, two or maybe three remained in the Catholic church. The other\ntwo just went back to Judaism. And he found that fine. He said, first of all, you weren't\ntotally adult, you were not sure what you were doing. Now you saw your fellow Jews and\nyou wanted to be more close to them, fine, go back, that's alright. He never, never put any\nobstacle to that. And he always refused to put pressure. Now, I won't say that there wasn't an\noccasional old crotchety nun who thought that being non-Christian was the worst sin in the\nworld. And may have put some pressure on some of the kids, that's possible. That is, I'm not\ndenying that. Neither did Father Bruno. But, it was against his will and, actually, there is no\nrecord that any of those actually did change, so it was just an annoyance and was a little\nchild abuse, I would say. Moral child abuse. Which he certainly didn't approve of. Okay. I\ndigress now. What were you asking me?",
        "A: Right, that's right. It took months and months and, if not to say years, to find the surviving\nparents, if there were any. To find surviving family. Uncles, cousins, if there were any. And\nto find willing adoptive parents if there were no family members available. Some of the kids,\neven though they still remained Jewish, wanted to stay with the people who had harbored\nthem during the war. That became a little difficult because the CDJ, after the war, tried to\ngather all the kids back into the Jewish fold, which 1s fine, I mean, it was a legitimate\nconcern of them. The only thing where Father Bruno objected seriously is when a home for\nJewish kid was built and, supposedly, non-denominational, but it was only Jewish children.\nAnd some members of the CDJ wanted some of the kids to go there. But Father Bruno said, I\ndon't want that. I want them to go back to a good Jewish family, that's fine, but I don't want\nthem to go to a sterile, although Jewish, environment where they will not teach them\nreligion, or if they do it will be on an optional basis and where they will not be allowed to\npractice the Christian religion if they wanted to do so. And that was one of the points of\ncontention. Unfortunately. Another point of contention was some of the relatives who\nwanted to get the children back before any formalities had been completed. And I have,\nunfortunately, witnessed a very sad and dramatic incident where some uncles came to my\nyounger uncle's house the day after liberation and demanded to have one of the kids who was\nstaying there, without permission from anybody else. Not even the CDJ, by the way. You\nknow. They just came and took the child. Not knowing if the parents were alive or what.\nThey just wanted the kid. And they didn't even live in the same city. There were a few\nunpleasant incidents, but I would say on the whole, the vast majority, the replacement of\nthese children went pretty smoothly. Thanks to the help of people like Mrs. Jospa(ph), who\nmade a point of continuing Father Bruno's work yet working for the CDJ or the, I forget the\nnew name they get, they got after the war, but anyway, it's the CDJ, it's the same.",
        "A: No, it didn't. In fact, he continued to work for about two months and then had a bad accident.\nAnd had to be hospitalized for a full month. And during that time, he was unable to do\nanything. Most of his assistants took over. And took over the replacement functions and he\nkind of loosely supervised after that. Then he was re-drafted in the army because before the\nwar he was an army chaplain, yeah, he was a mobile Benedictine. He was an army chaplain\nduring the campaign of 1940. He was slightly wounded and was taken prisoner of war in\nGermany. Then after World War II, after his accident was healed, his superiors said it was\nokay for him to go back into the army. And he went back into the army for another three\nyears. And he went to Germany. And this is where he was able to see with his own eyes\nnumerous concentration camps. Particularly Neu , which he photographed\nextensively. And Bergen Belsen and several others. I forget which ones they were.\nEnd of Tape #6\nTape #7",
        "A: Yes, and people have all the qualities, don't they? He was a Benedictine. And in French we\nhad a saying for people who do enormous amounts of tedious, lengthy work.\n. The work of a Benedictine. And in addition to his action work during\nWorld War II, he did the same thing. He did that. He did the . He compiled very\nextensive studies on the works of some of the Catholic Church's early fathers. Like Saint\nIrinae(ph) who was one of the early writers of the Catholic Church, in the Fourth Century, I\nbelieve. Incidently, I received a call from a very erudite professor at one of the Eastern\nuniversities a few months ago saying, oh, I read in the bibliography for Saint Irinae that your\nuncle's work is the basic work for people who research Saint Irinae and I was very proud to\nhear that his name has appeared in this, I forget the name of the man, but I've got 1s\nsomeplace. Doctor so and so is doing studies on Saint Irinae himself. And he's basing his\nstudies on Father Bruno's work. He published one very extensive work in which he, a sort of\na dictionary, if you want, in four languages, Latin, Greek, Coptic(ph) and Aramian(ph).\nBecause Saint Irinae's writings were in various translations at that time already. And so that\nwhoever 1s doing studies on Saint Irinae can read them in either language. And he published\nan extensive study on the writings themselves. And then he had a continuous series of\narticles in one of the theological reviews in .",
        "A: He was, after the war, he was pastor of a small village for several years and enjoyed that very\nmuch. His superior had released him from the abbey because he could see he just couldn't\nstay in the abbey any more. He had done so much work outside that to be cloistered again\nwould just kill him. So he sent him as pastor at a small village in the south of Belgium. I\nwent there several times and enjoyed it very much. He became totally enthralled by this\npastoral ministry which he hadn't actually done before. He became totally conquered by that.\nThe village people loved him a lot, too, and yet, he would close his door at a certain time and\nthey knew better than to bother him unless if it's for an emergency. And he would work on\nhis intellectual endeavors. So, he would spend two or three hours a day writing and\nresearching Saint Irinae again. And so he tried to always balance, you know. Of course,\nduring the war he did little intellectual work, but he did some. And I still remember my\ngrandmother transcribing some of his chicken scratch onto neat white paper. She has a\nbeautiful, had a beautiful handwriting. And she transcribed many, many pages of his works.\nSo it would be legible for the publisher. During the war.",
        "A: To me? Well, we have remained practicing Catholics and our children are, too. I perhaps\ndon't have the as we Say in France, the sacred fire, as much as Father\nBruno had. We try to remain, let's say reasonably close. We go to church every Sunday and\none of our very best friends is a Dutch priest who speaks, you know, a Dutch priest who is a,\nwho speaks several languages and we became very friendly with him. And he's one of the\ntotally adorable people. A little bit like Father Bruno. He has been teaching theology,\nlanguages and so on, and yet, he did all the garden work for the seminary at St. Thomas\nseminary. Again, a man of both action and cerebral work, if you want. So, yeah, we're, I\nwould say it's important. I won't claim and be dishonest and say that we are thinking about it\nevery minute. But, it is still important for us, yeah.",
        "A: I should say so. I should say the concern for other people, the concern for\n, aS We Say in French. Our neighbor. You know, the things that our\ngrandmother taught us to be concerned about other people, to be practically practicing our\nreligion. Not just kneeling on the pew and babbling prayers that don't mean anything to us. I\nprobably don't remember the vast majority of prayers I learned by heart when I was young.\nBut, I don't think that's so important. It's much more important to be nice to your neighbor, to\ndo things to help, to be concerned about your neighbor. I would like, 1f you don't mind, I\nwould like to give you something that Father Bruno said when he was asked, why did you do\nthat? He said, the motives was a revolt against injustice and violence. A consciousness of our\ncommon past. Both historical and theological. He was very conscious of that. Personal\nfondness for encounters, quote, at the frontiers. Because in the '40's it was still considered the\nfrontiers, you know, Catholic priests didn't mingle so much with Jews. He loved it. Secondly,\nthe goals. To save human lives. To reconstitute or preserve families. To establish human\ncontacts between Judaism and Christianity. And the spirit is a spirit of respect of human life.\nRespect of human dignity. Expansion of mutual respect by reciprocal knowledge of values,\nculture and spiritual climate. That was his answer. He did not give very many interviews.\nCertainly not a four hour one. But this is one that he expected to give, to a Jewish\npublication. And I thought it resumed or it abstracted well what his ideas were.",
        "A: I would say that it was a little bit on the back burner for maybe, oh, 20 years after the end of\nthe war. Mostly because I didn't have time to do anything but study. I was in high school and\nthen in college and then in medical school. I graduated in 1959. We came here in a new\nenvironment. In 1961. I didn't have any books with me because I didn't know I was going to\nstay so long. I read and spoke English, but I didn't know much about the libraries here, so I\ndidn't have anything to go to to get more information. Gradually, on the other hand, after I\ntalked to my uncle a number of times, and I saw him again on my rare trips to Belgium, I,\nsuddenly it came back and I said, I've got to do something about that. And I became a\nfanatical history buff only about World War II and particularly the Holocaust. And I became\nso interested that I felt almost as Jewish as my Jewish friends at times. We had a reunion in\nWashington D.C. about two years ago where a good dozen of rescued people met with me\nand we gave a series of lectures through the ADL and so on in Washington. And at the end,\nwhen they asked me to say something about them, I said, I think I've got 12 new Jewish\ncousins. And, yeah, it did change my mind on a lot of things. I realized how close we could\nbe and, you know, which I probably wouldn't have known as well if I hadn't gone into that\nintensive study of the events. And then after I studied the Holocaust in general, then I dug\ninto Father Bruno's records which were not all that abundant because he destroyed much of\nthem after World War II. But I was able to collect a good number of things and, of course,\nthere were things I knew of personal knowledge. I got information from my other uncles and\naunts who had letters and had memories or, you know, in their minds. And helped me and\nwe all worked together on that. And when he finally died, we decided we had to do\nsomething. And then this nice young man, Mr. Johannes(ph) Bloom(ph), who was much to\nyoung to have known Father Bruno, was an Austrian Jew. Came to Brussels and heard about\nhim and said, we've got to do something to try to remember this person. And then he got in\ntouch with me, we wrote the biography, we got testimonies from a number of rescued\npeople, many of whom are still alive in Israel. One of his most favorite guys is still in a\nkibbutz there and his name is Svee(ph) Harlioff(ph). And he was one of the most vocal and\nbefore, actually, we started working on that, Israel invited Father Bruno, as a guest, in 1964,\nin August, 1964, he was made Righteous of the Nations at the Advashem(ph). And has a tree\nthere in his name. And he met a number of the kids who were no longer kids at that time, had\nchildren of their own, that he had rescued. And for him, of course, it was a most emotional\nmoment. This is a picture of him that was taken in Israel and it's been the picture that\neverybody has shown of him. It's a very good picture because it shows the twinkle in his eye\nand the half smile which was so typical of him. And he enjoyed his stay there. Then my\nsecond uncle, my younger uncle, the dentist, Jean(ph) , has recently also been\nmade Righteous of the Nations and so he appreciated that very much. He's 82 years old now,\nstill alive and doing well. So he was also honored by Israel for, actually, there were times\nwhen he had 25 kids in his house, and think of the risk.",
        "A: Pardon?",
        "A: Yeah, but not a great number. And those were most of the time, done by Father Bruno\nhimself. Except for three that were in my house, in my own house, a Polish girl, a young\nPolish girl, an older woman from Eastern Europe...",
        "A: Yeah. And a third woman, yeah. That's right.",
        "A: Yeah, they came in succession. Right. That was at the very end of the war, actually. I would\nsay the second, well, 1944. The first nine months of 1944. And then, of course, the liberation\ntook place and, in September, so, our last one ran out the door screaming happiness.",
        "A: Well, I must say it's a great honor for me to be interviewed by the Museum. I've visited the\nMuseum and it was an extremely emotional experience. My wife, who was with me, had the\nsame experience. It was, I don't know what the word is, but it was quite an experience to see\nthat. Things that I, for the most part, had at least some idea of. Many things I knew rather\nwell, but to actually see all of that in one place and be totally surrounded by that, ooh, 1t was\nquite an experience. I think that's one of the most emotional experiences I've ever had in my\nlife. It was really something I will not forget. And I want to thank you for coming to Denver\nand you people who are filming and listening, I appreciate your cooperation and coping with\nmy old house with very little power.\nConclusion of interview.\n"
