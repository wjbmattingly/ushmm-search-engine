        "Q: Good morning, Chris. Welcome to Washington.",
        "A: Good morning, Joan.",
        "Q: Can you tell me the name that you were born with, and where and when you were born?",
        "A: I was born in Starachowice, Poland, March 5\", 1926. My Hebrew name was Rachel. My\ngiven name on the birth certificate reads Rozalia Laks. I also was known as Rozka or\nRosha Laks, and during the war, when we were brought from the Auschwitz camp to\nRavensbrick, I had decided that it would be easier to survive with an assumed Christian\nname, and due to the fact that no records have followed our departure from Auschwitz,\nwhen we were on the death march, once we arrived at the table where they registered the\nnew transports, we changed our names to a Christian name \u2014 last name and first name in\nmy case, the name Gorska \u2014 I assumed the name Krystyna for it to be a real Christian\nname.",
        "Q: So, you have many names...",
        "A: Many names.",
        "Q: ...1n your life?",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Can you tell us about your family \u2014 your father, your mother, what they were like, what\nthey did, and then about you and your two sisters?",
        "A: We were growing up 1n a small town, population about 35-40,000, and it was \u2014 I would\nsay that the Jewish population amounted to approximately ten percent, no more, due to\nthe fact that there were large factories in the city, in the town, which were government \u2014\nbelonged to the government, and the people who were employed in those factories \u2014 they\nwere manufacturing ammunitions, and also they had foundries and iron ore mines \u2014\nPeople who were employed in the factories were mostly Christian people, gentile people.\nJews were involved in predominately business and they were artisans and craftsmen, and\nthis was more or less the composition of the town. The town \u2014 the Jewish population in\ntown was very well organized. We had a lot of different organizations. And I as a child\ncould only get more or less from the conversation that I overheard at home, you know,\nabout my parents being involved in the community going to different meetings. They\nwere predominately involved with Zionist organizations. They were not orthodox or\nreligious people, but they were traditional Jews. My parents had a kosher home and I\nwould say that we observed the main holidays. I don\u2019t think that my father was going to\nsynagogue every day. I know he didn\u2019t. And as far as we were concerned, as youngsters,\nas soon as we were old enough, we too joined Zionist youth groups because this was sort\nof saying the whole idea that eventually we will all make our way to Palestine. As far as\nmy parents are concerned, they were very active in the community \u2014 Mother in particular,\nmore so, because Father was a lot away from home. Father\u2019s involvement in the\ncommunity never was as involved as was my mother\u2019s. He was what they call \u2014 I don\u2019t\nknow the name, there is no equivalent in the English language \u2014 but it is Brakaz. What\nthis \u2014 what he has \u2014 what he did, he was evaluating... How to say it? Actually he was an\nappraiser of large tracts of forest because he was representing a very large international\ncompanies that supplied timber to German companies and British companies. They used\nthe timber for support in mines. So, he was working for a company like this, and before\nthe companies went into the negotiation of the purchase of the timber, they had to have\nan idea more or less of what \u2014 how many trees they are, what it will yield, and so forth,\nbecause they had to pay tremendous amounts of money. So, my father\u2019s job was to travel\nto the forests and, in most cases, with the assistant of the forester, they went into the\nwoods and he was estimating, more or less, you know, how many trees there are on the\ntract, how thick they are, what the yield would be, and when he was coming home from\nthe trip, he used to sit and prepare specifications, and on the basis of his specifications,\nthe companies went into the negotiations for the purchase. So, he wasn\u2019t that much\naround because usually once he went away, it was like three to four, sometimes five\nweeks before he\u2019d return home, and when he\u2019d return home he used to sit, you know, for\nhours and hours and hours in his study preparing, you know, the specifications. So,\nMother was certainly in charge of the household and the children and seeing to our\ncomfort and overseeing our activities and education and she was a wonderful woman, and\nreally, as far as forming the character, it was Mother\u2019s responsibility. And, to her,\neducation was very, very important. So, outside of the fact that she was very involved\nwith community and the Zionist organization, she formed the WIZO in Starachowice.\nShe was the first president in the WIZO organization. She was a member of regional and\nthe national \u2014 no, what\u2019s the word I want to use? \u2014 she was a member of the\nregional...uh...",
        "Q: Office?",
        "A: ... Office, and she also formed for young unmarried women, the young WIZO in town.\nSo, every once in a while, you know, when I wanted to know a little bit more about my\nparents immediately after the war, I used to turn to those people who \u2014 the generation\nbetween my parents and my self that could tell me a little bit more about who my parents\nwere. Because basically, you know, to a child a parent is a parent. You don\u2019t think of\nthem as individuals. You just think of them as parents, and they\u2019re there to take care of\nyou and provide for you and make you comfortable whenever it\u2019s necessary. So, with the\nconversation \u2014 in conversations with those people, I found out a lot about my parents and\nespecially from women who were like eight, ten years older then myself who were, you\nknow, already teenagers or a little older who told me how wonderful my mother was and\nhow energetic she was and how inspiring she was in, some would say, in bringing the\nZionist idea and inspiring people and so forth and so on.",
        "Q: When you speak about your father being away, do you have any recollections of doing\nthings with your father? Going for walks with your father? Or going on a picnic? Or is\nthere some particular kind of recollection?",
        "A: Well...",
        "Q: Other than his working so hard.",
        "A: No, Father was a disciplinarian. He was the head of the family, a typical European head\nof the family. He was a disciplinarian and a no-nonsense man. And he was outgoing and\nhe was very nice, but still in all, you know, when he spent time with us, I would say that,\nif you were to compare with present days, you would say it was more quality time rather\nthan otherwise. And, Father was \u2014 had a beautiful singing voice. He was, he was born in\nSilesia, which at the time when he was born, it was German occupied part of Poland that\nwas occupied by Germany. So, I would say at the turn of the century, 1900, that was, his\n\u2014 his world was Vienna, 1900. So, the music, you know, by Strauss and Mahler and\nLehar \u2014 that was his world. He loved music. He had a beautiful singing voice. So, when\nwe get together, I remember how we used to \u2014 first of all, the taste for classical music I\ngot from my father \u2014 and we have been listening to his singing, and we sang along with\nhim. I mean, even in German, because his education was a German education. So, he\nspoke more, as far as foreign languages, he used more German then any other language.\nAnd so, he sang along with us, and he was teaching us voices in order to sing in different\nvoices so that we could sing in harmony. And, no matter where we went afterwards,\nwhen we were in a crowd, they knew that the three of us could sing in harmony. So, we\nwere always asked to sing any song, you know, and because we have learned what it\ntakes to sing in harmony, we could ourselves, later on, adapt to certain levels, whereby\nwe could create, even though not knowing whether we are doing it right or wrong, we\ncould sing in harmony one way or another, you know, in different voices. So, this was\nvery interesting. But, Father\u2019s culture, basically, the culture of experience, was more\nGerman. As a matter of fact, he had a study with a huge mahogany desk, and behind the\ndesk was like a secretary behind glass doors. He was a very neat man, very neat, very\nelegant gentleman. I\u2019m sorry I don\u2019t have the picture right now here. And, he used to\nhave everything placed all orderly including the huge German encyclopedia. I remember\nwhen I went to high school and I took German as the second language, he used to say to\nme, \u201cIf you ever need to use the encyclopedia, you are welcome to it, but don\u2019t bend the\npages, and please make sure that everything is placed back where it belongs.\u201d So, you\nknow, this is the kind of a person he was. He was a very orderly person with whom, you\nknow, things had to be always right. But I really developed a very close relationship with\nmy father after we had been taken to camp, when we lost our mother, because it just\nhappened so that we had been working together, and we had access to one another. It was\nthe slave labor camp in Starachowice, where we were not separated all the time and we\ncould have meals together and so forth and so on. It was at that time that I really realized\nwhat a caring and loving person he was, and inasmuch as he didn\u2019t have maybe the\npatience when we were little to be with us. This was the bonding sort of time when I\nreally felt how important he was in our lives, and how important we were in his life. So,\nthese are more or less, you know, the way I would think of my parents.",
        "Q: Tell me a little bit more about your mother. Was she very warm? Was she not so neat,\ngiven that she had to take care of all of you? That she was a little different then your\nfather? Or was she...?",
        "A: Mother was, I would say, the extreme opposite of my father. She was \u2014 first of all, she\nwas more of a people\u2019s person. She loved to be with people. She was the person who\norganized all social events. She was the person who was entertaining. She was the person\nwho welcomed everybody in the house, regardless of who they were. Poor, I remember\ndays when the local people who were destitute were coming to my mother asking for\nassistance, not only Jews but gentiles. It 1s a family \u2014 there was a family, I mean, nobody\nis alive anymore \u2014 a Christian family that came to settle in Starachowice at the time when\nthe revolution in Russia broke out. They used to live in Belarus, if I remember correctly,\nand they came to our town. They happened to be living in the same courtyard, you know,\nhow Europeans cities where it wasn\u2019t individual homes, but it was like one house and\nthere was a courtyard and in the courtyard were other houses and people lived all around.\nAnd, they were intelligent, very nice, wonderful people, parents and four women who\nwere more or less the age of my parents, a little younger. And Mother got to like them.\nAnd it was very difficult for them to get, some would say, accustomed. to go to town and\nto make a living and so forth and so on. So, Mother has encouraged them to open a, like,\na kinder care. I was three years old when I was already in that pre-nursery, nursery\nwhatever you call it, with my sister, you know, my older sister, and of course, Mother\nhad seen to it that other \u2014 that friends of hers would send their children. So, it gave them\nimmediately a little bit, kind of a source of income in addition to the father who was, he\nwas not a doctor, he was a medic, that Mr. Paliszewski. He was working as a medic in the\nRussian Army, I think, or whatever. He was so knowledgeable about medicine that\neventually when the hospital opened in our town, he was an accredited practitioner in the\nhospital without being a doctor. So, this tells you something, but you know it takes time\nfor any newcomer. So, my mother was doing all these things, and by the way, the\nPaliszewski family the most wonderful family to us. I mean, for us, they were a home\naway from home all the time. And I\u2019m skipping things, but I must tell you that after the\nwar, when I came back to my home town, if it wasn\u2019t for them, I would have been killed\nthe day I arrived back. But this is another story. So, I cherished the friendship that my\nparents had with the Paliszewski family. So, here we are, we were talking about my\nmother, what she was doing. So, she was trying to assist destitute people. She was trying\nto help people who were coming to the community to kind of get settled and start a new\nlife. She was, during the war \u2014 she was instrumental in creating the Hebrew school to\nwhich we went, a Hebrew Day School. My first four years of formal schooling were not\nin the public school system, but they were in the Hebrew schools, in the Hebrew school.\nEverything in that school was in Hebrew \u2014 math, geography \u2014 everything they taught us\nwas in Hebrew. I mean, we were learning Polish as well, but Polish was a language \u2014\nPolish history and Polish was taught in Polish. Everything else was taught in Hebrew.\nNow, I want you to know that in our home, we never spoke Yiddish, which was a\nlanguage that was used in everybody\u2019s house. My parents both were educated. They\nspoke four languages fluently \u2014 Polish, and German, and Russian, because Father was\neducated in German schools, Mother was educated in Russian schools, and Yiddish, of\ncourse, they spoke fluently. Sometimes they spoke Yiddish so that if they wanted to say\nsomething we shouldn\u2019t understand. Mother comes from a family that was, I would say,\nvery educated due to the fact that even my grandma, I remember Grandma Sara, had a\nhigh school diploma, and I want you to know that in those days, nobody considered an\neducation for a woman necessary. She had thirteen children, mind you. Nine survived;\nfour died either in childbirth or whatever it was. That was \u2014 she married \u2014 she comes\nfrom a family of bankers, Fefers, from Ostoriwiec and she married a man who was come\nfrom Sandomierz. He was in the printing business. So, again, in order to be in the printing\nbusiness, you had to be very literate, because otherwise you could not run a successful\nprinting business. That was my mother\u2019s side of the family. All my aunts are \u2014 graduated\nfrom high school. The youngest one went to the university and she became a pharmacist,\nand she worked, I think it was the year before the war; it was her first year of\nemployment. She was the youngest, you know, and that was her first year of employment\nand she was somewhere near Bialystok, and we never found out what happened to her.\nWe thought that maybe, because she was so close to the territory that it was eventually\noccupied by the Russians \u2014 you know, in 1939, when Poland was divided between the\nGerman occupants and the Russian occupants \u2014 but we couldn\u2019t find her. So, out of the\nfamily of nine on my mother\u2019s side, there was a set of three sisters, first. They all had\nchildren. My mother is the last one from the first set of three girls. They have children\nwho have married with children already. Like my oldest aunt had two sons who had been\nmarried before the war, and they already had little babies. One of them had two, and one\nof them had one, while the youngest sister was just graduated from the university. And in\nthe middle were three brothers who at the time of the Russian revolution made their way\nto the United States and Canada. So, there were the first three women in the family, then\nthere were the three men in the family, and there were the three youngest girls, sisters of\nmy mother\u2019s, in the family, who were still single. One of them got married right \u2014 I\nwould say during the war, maybe in 1940s, and I don\u2019t remember whether she had a\nfamily or not. I just can\u2019t recall that, and this is it. So, I was very fortunate to have some\nmembers of my mother\u2019s family here in the United States and in Canada that, at least,\nyou know, makes you feel good that there 1s somebody around who can tell you who you\nare, when you were, and what was life like for them when they were around. Another\ninteresting thing about my parents, if you want to know, is I mentioned to you before that\nthey were very instrumental, always trying to assist other people. I remember, you know,\nwhoever, as I said before, whoever knocked on the door, they were always, always more\nthan willing to help, but beggars came around, you know, they used to give me like a coin\nand said, \u201cGo out and give it to them.\u201d They were never asked to come in. And there\nwere many people who were coming begging, you know, in those days. But then in 1937\nmaybe \u00b038, I was a little older, there was \u2014 I could see new faces that were coming in and\nthey spoke German, and when my parents \u2014 my parents used to say that if they are not\nhome and there is somebody who is coming in and doesn\u2019t speak Polish but speaks\nGerman, be sure to ask them to come in. Those were the German Jews who were being\nso-called \u201cresettled\u201d from the German territories. And they, when they were coming to\nthe different communities in Poland, and they just happened to be come to our town, to\nStarachowice, due to the fact that Father was, spoke German so well and could\ncommunicate with them and understand their needs and Mother was so being having all\nthese contacts and connections being so, so to say, as they say in America, a Macher, you\nknow, trying to be of assistance to others, that I could see, you know, how they really\nspent a lot of time in order to assist them. And I didn\u2019t understand that much at the time\nyet, but somebody knocked on the door and they used to say in German \u201c/s Herr Laks zu\nHause?\u201d And J used to run to mom and say, \u201cMommy, a Deutsche Jude 1s there.\u201d You\nknow, I remember, I did it once and Mother said, \u201cI don\u2019t want you to talk like this.\u201d If\nanybody\u2019s asking about dad or about me, open the door and ask them in. You know, you\nare a child, you don\u2019t know what to do. You don\u2019t know how to behave. So, what they\ndid for the people, in what way they assisted them, I don\u2019t know, but the mere fact that I\nhad observed that those people were welcome in our home and that my parents cared to\nlisten to them, I\u2019m sure that they have done something to make their life easier.",
        "Q: Were you wealthy? Was the family wealthy or well off in some way?",
        "A: Well, let me tell you about this aspect of the family. From the pictures that I have seen in\nthe albums, from the early childhood, I think that we were quite comfortable because the\npictures were from different resorts, areas like the Baltic Sea, you know, and from the\nmountains, the Bezkidy, and there was a spa in Busko Zdroj that my mother was going,\nand we always had either the maid or a nanny that came along, you know, to take care of\nus. But at the time of the depression, when America, you know, after the crash and when\nEurope was attracted by the American depression, which was 1933 or whatever, I don\u2019t\nremember in Poland at the time, Father\u2019s services were not needed anymore due to the\nfact that neither Germany nor England could afford to come and purchase timber in\nPoland because they themselves, you know, they had to make do with whatever they had,\nand utilize what they had. You know, it was a very, very difficult time. So, I remember\nFather was looking, I mean, he had to support the family. He stopped going away from\nhome and he was around home base. So, I remember he had a job with the same company\nthat he was representing before, but here, too, he had to be channeled into a different\naspect of the operation of the lumber company, and there was only part-time work for\nhim. So, he also assumed a kind of a half, semi-position with a credit company because\nwe lived in, as I said before, in an industrial area, and people were buying things on\ncredit, you know. So, let\u2019s say if somebody wanted to buy an item which was expensive,\nand I\u2019m not talking about thousands of zlotys, but whatever, but they needed a coat or a\nnew suit, and whatever. You know, he couldn\u2019t walk into the store and buy it. So, the\nman who was on the job in the factories, in the munitions factories, used to go to the store\nand establish a credit and he was paying so much a month, a week, I have no idea. But\nFather was doing the research in order to give them the credit reference. So, that was\nanother thing. But we were growing up and we had to go to school, and my older sister in\nparticular was about ready for high school, and that was an expensive thing. So, my\nmother decided to learn a trade. We had, I mean, things were difficult, so we subletted a\nroom, and we subletted a room in our house to a woman who was a corset maker. And\nthe woman said to my mother, after she was half a year in town, she says, \u201cYou know\nwhat? You have such connections.\u201d You know because she was trying to assist her, \u201cYou\nhave such great connections, and I\u2019m a single woman, and I don\u2019t think I like to stay here\nfor too long.\u201d She says, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you learn it? And why don\u2019t you run a corset shop?\u201d\nSo, of course, Mother figured she\u2019s there, so she might as well learn. Mother didn\u2019t know\nhow to use a Sewing machine or anything like this. I remember, in the beginning, she\nused to cry because the wheel was turning the other way around instead of forward. But\nshe has learned and, of course, with all her connections in the community, you know, the\nnon-Jewish and the Jewish population, she developed a wonderful business. She was\nreally, and you know she had the respect of everybody, and therefore, so you know that\nwas another source of income for us, which was easier. And then in 1937, finally, Father\ngot back on his feet, and he became a representative of a wholesaler from abroad. I don\u2019t\nknow. One company I think was in Lithuania that was sending different cheeses, so it\nwas importing different cheeses from Lithuania, and canned fish either from Denmark or\nHolland, I don\u2019t know. So, he had these two franchises that kind of brought him back on\nhis feet and things were looking up, and we were growing up and ready for school and...",
        "Q: I want to ask you some questions about your sisters, but I\u2019m curious, when you all were\nsinging, was there someone playing the piano? Was there a piano in the house?",
        "A: No, we didn\u2019t have \u2014 yeah, it was always a capella. We never had a piano. As a matter of\nfact, you know, Mother had a very good voice, too, but 1t was Father who really loved it,\nand as a matter of fact, my uncle from the United States who was the next to follow my\nmother and, Uncle Moish, and in the family of the nine children, they were the two\nclosest siblings. So, when Uncle Moish, when I met him, he always was telling me how\nUncle Moish played the banjo and sang. So, he used to tell me how they used to get\ntogether and they used to form like the little theater and perform for people in the\ncommunity, you know, get together and they had other people, you know, who were like\nthemselves kind of artistic and with good singing voices and everything. So, Uncle Moish\nwas telling, filling me on those little things that were at home as far as singing 1s\nconcerned. So, they all had this, this musical ear. In our family, my son, who is\nresembling my dad very, very much, is the one who has a good voice. Miles has a terrible\nvoice, and Jeanette is just like him. They are always off-key. They love to sing, but they\nare always off-key.",
        "Q: And you still sing?",
        "A: I do sing, yes, but of course, it\u2019s not \u2014 it\u2019s not the same voice. I used to have the voice of\nsoprano, you know, and very high, and I really sing very, very well without any particular\nvoice training or anything like this, but I love to sing. I remember when we used to get\ntogether, always, the parents used to say, \u201cLet\u2019s sing.\u201d And all the pop songs and the\nnational songs and Hebrew songs, when we were traveling with the children in the United\nStates on long trips, to kind of keep them busy, keep them occupied, so they wouldn\u2019t\nfight with one another in the back seat, we used to engage them in singing, you know,\nand we had a very favorite Hebrew song, \u201cYalda Yafa\u201d\u2019, because you could also sing it in\nthe harmony, you know, different ways, and I thought that this is going to make them\nkind of involved, more involved than otherwise. So, they used to get very upset when\nMiles started because Miles never, I mean he loved to sing, and he knew the song just as\nwell. You know \u201cYalda Yafa\u201d, means a pretty girl in Hebrew, and they loved the song.\nWe all loved the song, but if I started we could continue to vocalize and sing in harmony.\nWhen Miles started, no way. They still talk about it the trips, you know, to Canada,\nwhich took like 13, 14 hours before you got from Vineland to Toronto, about the long\ntrips and how dad used to sing \u201cYalda Yafa\u201d",
        "Q: Tell us about your two sisters. You have an older sister and a younger sister. The younger\nsister is three years younger than you are.",
        "A: Close to four.",
        "Q: Close to four.",
        "A: I was born at the beginning of the year, and she was born at the end of the year.",
        "Q: So, you were born in 1926, and Regina\u2019s born in 1929.",
        "A: But, I was born in March, beginning of March, and she was born middle of December.",
        "Q: And, the older sister, when was she born?",
        "A: She was born two years before me, in January.",
        "Q: So, you\u2019re all... You\u2019re... Well...?",
        "Q: But it\u2019s that difference in age, 1t was tremendous, so to say, when you think in terms of\nchildhood, was between my oldest sister and my little sister. I used to adore my older\nsister. Whatever she did, nobody could do it as good as she did. She was my role model,\nand I would do anything for her, whether she took advantage of it, I would say yes, like\nany other sibling.",
        "Q: Can you describe how she took advantage?",
        "A: Well, if she needed errands, you know, and if she didn\u2019t want, she was too busy to do\nwhat she was supposed to do, like take care of uniform, you know. We went to school in\nuniform regardless whether we were in elementary school or in high school. In\nelementary school, we used to wear like a smock, which was, we called it an apron, you\nknow, with a little white collar, and for it to be fresh we used to change \u2014 like a Peter Pan\naround, kind of \u2014 for it to be nice and fresh we used to put everyday a fresh collar, you\nknow, lots and lots of collar in a drawer that were always washed and starched. It was a\nmatter of pasting it to the collar. My sister she wouldn\u2019t do it. She used to pin it, and it\nwas always crooked. So, she used to have me do those things for her. Like, she was too\nbusy with homework and she was too busy with her so to say, involvement with school\nand she read books. She read constantly, constantly. I mean, have developed a liking for\nbooks and for reading, especially classics, because of her due to the fact that I was the\nyounger one. She was the older one. So, of course, I couldn\u2019t read the same books at the\nsame time as she did, but when she was coming home from high school and some of her\nfriends came along for a visit, and they were sitting around and talking, discussing books,\nI used to be so envious that I didn\u2019t know anything about it. So, of course, I was reaching\nout. How much I have gotten out of the reading at the time, like okay, let me give you a\nbook like Les Mis\u00e9rables. I could understand that because it was about \u2014 from the\nhistorical point of view, I could understand. The social nuances of the book, I don\u2019t think\nthat I understood then as much as I can understand now. Now, if they were, let\u2019s say, if\nthey were discussing The Bauhaus, Ibsen, it was beyond me. And, I took it, and I looked\nit, and I read it for the fact that I wanted to get acquainted with it, but with how much I\nhad gotten, I don\u2019t remember. I still read Anna Karenina and Tolstoy, you know, and\nsome of it I have gotten. When I sat and listened to the conversations, it kind of made a\nlittle more sense. My problem was that I did not read the book before the discussions. I\nhad read the book after the discussions. So, therefore, I could only apply just so much\nwhat I overheard and no more. I mean, and don\u2019t forget that it\u2019s not like right now, I\nwould open a book and it would be quite clear to me, you know? Basically those days\nwere \u2014 what interested me was the story and the people involved and the plot. But, in\nbetween the lines, how much I have seen there, I don\u2019t think I did.",
        "Q: Would she talk about books with you? Was she patient with you?",
        "A: No. No. She only had friends... She wasn\u2019t \u2014 you see, when she was ready to go to high\nschool, there was no high school in our town. So, she had to go out of town to a larger\ncity, to Radom. There were private schools in Radom, and there was like a federal school\nin Radom. That was the Gymnasium Chalubinskiego was the number one school in\nRadom. And in order to get into that school, you had to be a very excellent student. So,\nwhen she came \u2014 and they were accepting I don\u2019t remember 25 or 30 students annually \u2014\nthe school was predominately for local people from the city, and it was a non-Jewish\nschool. So, the number of Jews was limited. You had to go through an exam, entrance\nexam, regardless of how good a student you were, you still had to have an entrance exam,\nentry exam? Whatever. So, when Mother brought her for the exam in Radom, Mother\nwas nervous, not my sister, because Mother knew that she\u2019s not going to pass it. Not only\nbeing from out of town, but being Jewish, there is no place where she can take her. So,\nthat was like in June, early June and the results were like...",
        "Q: What year was that?",
        "A: 1937, no 1935. She six grades of elementary school \u2014 somewhere around there. So,\nMother took her for the exam, and a few weeks later were the results, and the school was\nclosed already, so what they had is they had like a blackboard on which they posted all\nthe people who had been accepted, not alphabetically, but on the basis of how they scored\nin the exam, and my sister was number five, and accepted. Do you realize that\nachievement? Now, that was very difficult times for us. That was the time when \u2014 she\nmust have gone in 1935 because I was in high school already in \u201937. When she went to\nschool, financially, my parents weren\u2019t doing so well, and tuition was expensive. Not\nonly that she was accepted to school, but she received a scholarship, a 50 percent\nreduction in tuition. So, she was really brilliant, and I love her, she\u2019s so special, she\u2019s so\nspecial. She\u2019s having health problems now, unfortunately, and she lost her husband. So,\nit\u2019s difficult for her, very, very difficult. But, she\u2019s a very special person, and I always\ntried to emulate her, always. I mean, she stood there and she was reciting poetry. I mean,\nshe was, she was just a very unusual girl. As I told you, she was my role model. I was \u2014 if\nI thought of myself trying to do whatever, whatever she did, I always thought that I\u2019m a\nklutz, I don\u2019t come near her.",
        "Q: And your younger sister? Were you to your younger sister what your older sister was to\nyou?",
        "A: No. No, different, because I didn\u2019t want to have anything to do with my little sister, not\neven use her for anything. She was too young. You know, there was \u2014 here it was like the\ndifference in age was two years. There, it\u2019s almost four, and you know, we were little\nkids, and she kind of \u2014 I felt that she belongs with the sissies. I wanted to be what my\nother sister was. So, we kind of treated her like the baby in the family, you know. To play\nwith her, play games and do things, you know, whenever she wants. She always had such\na curiosity for things. Renia was an unbelievable person. When it came to learning about\nany little thing, nothing missed her ear or eye. And also the one thing about Renia was,\nwhen she heard a new expression, she put it to use immediately. We used to laugh at her\nbecause sometimes she couldn\u2019t say it properly. So, she used the word, but it was kind of,\nthe word that she wanted to use, she kind of changed it around. I don\u2019t mean by changing\nit around, it\u2019s like, let\u2019s say, a child would say instead of a napkin, they would say\n\u201cnapik\u201d or whatever, you know, this kind of a thing. They will leave out one syllable or\nwhatever because, you know, it\u2019s either difficult for them to say it, or 1s 1t because they\ndidn\u2019t hear the exact thing. But every word that was new to her, she used it immediately.\nWhat was the word that we used to make so much fun of her? I can\u2019t remember right\nnow. It may come back to me. It was a \u2014 it had to do with intellect, and the way she used\nit was very, very funny. I just don\u2019t remember right now. I should\u2019ve asked her.",
        "Q: You describe, and when you talk about everybody, there\u2019s a kind of security about your\nhousehold and your family for you. Is that accurate, that sense that you were very\ngrounded in a family that supported you and...?",
        "A: We were a very close-knit family. Even as much as Father was away, but when he was\naround, as I said, he was a typical head of the family. He cared, he provided for the\nfamily, he did things with the family. But I would say that now that I am a parent and I\nam a grandparent and I can observe how people behave at certain stages in their life, that\nI can see that with the exception of the present generation, where both parents are on jobs\nand are away from home, where both parents are involved in the actual running of the\nhousehold. In the olden days, the father was not too involved with the children. Maybe if\nwe had boys in the family, it would have been different. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know. I\nmay be wrong. I may be right. You know, maybe there would be a different tie. As a\nmatter of a fact, I didn\u2019t mention it to you, but my parents had four children. The first\nborn was a boy, and he was a very bright boy. He was four years old when my father\nwent on a trip to the East, I mean to \u2014 you know, for the job, how you say on his duties\non the job, and he took sick, and Mother received a telegram that Father was sick and\nhe\u2019s in the hospital. So, she left the maid with the baby and she told the maid to take the\nbaby, get on the train and go to my grandmother\u2019s \u2014 Grandmother lived only 30\nkilometers away. So, the maid \u2014 1t was wintertime and the maid dressed the baby up and\nwhatever and it was hot on the train and cold outside. What happened, I don\u2019t know, but\nthe baby got pneumonia and a week later my mother got a telegram to come immediately\nback from my grandma, and by the time she got back the baby was dead. He was the first\nborn who before even my oldest sister was born. So, I could remember seeing in my\nmother\u2019s purse either fresh grass or wilted grass which must have been from the grave\nevery time she went to the cemetery, but she always used to carry a little bit of something\nin her purse. His name was Juziu, Jusef was his name. So, now you are asking me about\ncloseness with Father. I don\u2019t know. Remarkable, another thing that\u2019s rather remarkable\nis that Mother used to say to us when we asked her about him \u2014 we were children so we\nwere curious because there was a picture of a little boy, very pretty boy \u2014 I\u2019m so sorry\nthat I don\u2019t have a picture of him. Little sailor collar, little white shirt and all that. And\nshe used to tell us and then she says that during the First World War I think he was born.\nNo, if my sister was born in \u201924, he must have died in \u201923 or \u201922. It was still wartime.\nAnd Mother was with him on a train and he was asking all kinds of questions. He saw the\npeople in uniform and the buttons and the hats and all that, and she used to \u2014 he used to\nask all the questions, and there was a woman sitting on the opposite of my mother and\nshe looked at the little boy and she says to my mother, \u201cThat boy\u2019s not going to live too\nlong. He\u2019s too smart.\u201d And, you know, Mother repeated to us when we were a little older\nand we started to ask more and more questions. It must have been tragic for her. I mean,\nshe didn\u2019t want to dwell on it, I\u2019m sure, because she had the responsibility to her family\nand it was a very \u2014 it must have been a very painful and sad experience for her to go\nthrough with this. So, this is the answer. You know, God giveth and God taketh away,\nand you never know when.",
        "Q: Well, why don\u2019t we take a break now?",
        "A: Okay.\nEnd of Tape #1\nTape #2",
        "Q: Chris, do you remember the first time you ever heard anything about the Nazis? Was it\nbefore 1939, before the war? Did you know anything politically that was going on?",
        "A: The only \u2014 the first time really that that I was aware of something happening was when\nthe German Jews were arriving, and when they came to our town and, as they were\ncoming every once in a while to our house to visit with my parents, who were trying to\nassist them. So, the reference that I had made before as to always referring to the people\nas the Deutsche Juden, because in the community the Jews of the community used to\nrefer to the newcomers, to the new Jews from Germany, as the Deutsche Juden, to\ndistinguish between the local Jewish population and the Jews that were coming to town.\nAnd, of course, their plight which was kind of obvious because I could see the extent of\nmy parents\u2019 involvement, but at the same time, this was happening in Germany and\nGermany, in the mind of the young person, is very far away. So, there is no immediate\ndanger inasmuch as to my parents, I\u2019m sure that they could see the whole picture in a\ndifferent way. To us, we were still at home, we were still at school, we were secure in our\nenvironment, and therefore, we didn\u2019t pay much attention, and it has never been\ndiscussed. I\u2019m sure that my parents inasmuch as they could have known or not, would not\nbring it up at all. We were, I feel, maybe \u2014 I\u2019m sure we were too young to comprehend it,\nand it was no use of burdening us with additional fears, because you live in a world\nwhere antisemitism was quite prevalent and we had enough to deal with the hooligans in\ntown who used to call us \u201cdirty Jews\u201d and throw rocks at you on occasion whenever they\ncould, you know, and I was accepted. I mean, my friends that I went to school with used\nto refer to me \u201ctheyeste shenasha\u201d (ph), as if to say \u201cYou are ours, our own\u201d so to Say,\nbecause I was just like them. You know, I spoke the language in the same manner, and\nwe Started together and we worked together on school projects and all that, but\nnevertheless, on the way to school, we had to pass by the area where the factories were,\nand they were kind of closed in by a very big fence all around, and for about, I would say,\none kilometer, there were no homes but just that huge, huge, huge fence. And on that\nfence there were \u2014 they used whitewash, they called that thing? \u2014 all kinds of sign, anti-\nSemitic signs. For example, they said, \u201cBe zyd\u201d (ph) \u2014 not to kill the Jews, but hit the\nJew, or there was a sign \u201cZyd to Pijawka\u201d \u2014 the Jew 1s a leach, or they used to say, \u201cZydy\ndo Palestyny\u201d \u2014 Jew, go to Palestine. And, you know, it wasn\u2019t pleasant. I don\u2019t know\nwho has put, you know, all that stuff on the fences, but they were never removed. They\nwere there all the time. But if you live in this type of environment and you expect to see it\nall the time, you know, on the way to school and on the way home from school, it kind of\n\u2014 you don\u2019t pay any attention anymore to it. So...",
        "Q: Did your Christian friends, your Polish Christian friends, ever comment on that? That\u2019s\nterrible, or...?",
        "A: No, they never commented, and we didn\u2019t even talk about it. But you know it was an\naggravating kind of a thing, that a twelve year old one or a thirteen year old one, you\nknow, we wouldn\u2019t \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 let me put it this way, that I could understand it better my\nmother\u2019s desire to plan the eventual immigration to Palestine based on this kind of a\nsituation. This is why she insisted that we learn Hebrew, and this is why she insisted to\ninstill in us the Zionist idea and this is why she was helpful in creating a Zionist youth\nmovement, and we joined, and, you know, we didn\u2019t have leaders in the community, so\nthey used to bring leaders from larger towns who were coming once a month to kind of\ngive us a definite direction more so from a contemporary point of view rather then be\nlead by some adult. And, but you felt it, you felt it, and there is \u2014 there were little\nincidents that were kind of always there. And, I remember walking with my father. Father\ncame and the railroad station wasn\u2019t far from our home. It was like a five minute\ndistance, you know? So, I used to \u2014 knowing that Father was coming, I used to run to the\nstation to kind of welcome him and walk home with him. And one time, there was \u2014 it\nwas during the time of the depression, and the Polish workers were very unhappy because\nthey went on strike, they weren\u2019t paid well enough, and it was a very bad situation in\ntown. And every time something like that occurred, there was a much stronger anti-\nSemitic reaction because it was \u2014 somebody had to be blamed for things that went wrong.\nSo, I remember, as we went approaching the main entrance to our courtyard, there was a\nguy that we knew well and Father knew well, and he was standing there and he was\ngiving out leaflets and he was repeating \u201cBe zyda, be zyda\u201d (ph) \u2014 hit the Jew, hit the\nJew. And as we came close, I\u2019Il never forget that, he took the leaflets in his hand and put\nthem behind his back, and he already uttered the word \u201cBe zyda\u201d (ph) and he says\n\u2018\u201cEkonomiczie\u201d, aS we were crossing, he says, \u201cEkonomiczie.\u201d As if to say, not outright\nhit the Jew, but hit the Jew economically, which was more of a legitimized way to say it\nfor my father not to get offended, but he had expressed it. And...",
        "Q: So, you were extremely young at that point?",
        "A: Well, I was ten years old. You know, I could understand it.",
        "Q: Do you have any recollection whether your parents thought of going to Palestine before\nthe war broke out or this was...?",
        "A: This was a \u2014 no, it was a plan that I\u2019m sure that they thought a lot about it. And maybe if\nat the time, they would have been in a better financial situation, maybe they would have\ndone something about it, but due to the fact that up until 1937, as I mentioned to you\nbefore, things were difficult between \u201933 and \u201937, four years, you know, that you can\nonly plan on the things that are needed rather than the long term for the future, and then\nof course the war broke out so, solved all the problems.",
        "Q: Now, you\u2019ve been using the words \u201cfather\u201d and \u201cmother\u201d but we haven\u2019t given them a\nname. So, before we go on. Let\u2019s give your father and mother their names.",
        "A: Okay, my mother was Pola, her maiden name was Tannenblum, and she was from\nOstrowiec, was Isaac, or Isaac in English, Laks. He was from Sosnowiec, which 1s in the\nPolish Slask or Silesia as it is now in the German language. They met, I don\u2019t know\nexactly when, but they had a very happy life. They really had a very happy life, and we\nhad a very warm and happy, loving family.",
        "Q: When you describe the anti-Semitic taunts and these things on the fences, do you have a\nrecollection that it got worse the closer the war came? Or does it appear to you to be just\nthe same, the same stuff all the time? Do friends start moving away from you?",
        "A: Well, my school friends were one group, and my other friends were another group. Due\nto the fact that I lived in Wierzbnik, which was basically the community where the Jews\nlived before the consolidation of the two. Very early, there was a community called\nWierzbnik and there was a community called Starachowice. Wierzbnik was so to say the\nearlier where all Jews lived and some of the non-Jews who even were involved with the\nbusiness or in city administration or in jobs, you know, but most people who worked in\nthe factories lived in Starachowice. As a matter of fact, in Starachowice they had two\nstreets, two main streets. One street was named Ulica Robotnieza, which means the street\nfor the blue-collar clerks, and the other one was Ulica Urzednicza, which was the street\nfor the white-collar clerks, and as you passed the streets, you could see the difference in\nthe living quarters and they were not too far apart, side by side, but in order to bring in\nthe skilled engineers and the technicians that were needed in the factories, they had to\ngive them something more than just the average housing. While the workers, you know,\ndue to the fact that we were like three or four kilometers away from the factories, they\nsettled closer to the factories so that they didn\u2019t have to travel that long of a distance. So,\nnow, when they consolidated the two communities, we became one, and it was called\nStarachowice. Wierzbnik was where the Jews lived. Starachowice was \u2014 the school, when\nI went to high school, was Starachowice. And this is when I had to pass from home all\nthe way, you know, three kilometers each way, and as we were getting closer and closer\nto school, more and more children joined the group, you know, because there was one\nroute that we use, you know. So, actually, we were three \u2014 in my class, there were three\nJews, four Jews, three boys, myself and another girl and in the class above me was\nanother Jewish girl. School opened the first two classes of high school at the time when I\nwas ready to go to school. And in this my mother, too, had her finger. She was also very\nhelpful in convincing the community that it\u2019s about time that the population of 40,000,\nwhich was right before the war, should have a school of higher education, not to have to\nsend the children away from home. So, she organized a group, you know, and they\ndiscussed it long enough, and it took two years before the school was finally opened and\nit was just in time for me. So, now, I have these friends from Hebrew school that are my\nold friends, from Wierzbnik, with whom I feel very, very comfortable, then I have my\nfriends from high school who do not live in Wierzbnik, very few. Most of them are living\nnear the factories because their parents are working there, and our connections are more\nbased on our school work. You know, every once in a while in addition to homework you\nhave projects that you have to work together on, whatever it was, whether it was in math\nor whether it was in social studies, or whatever. One of us got an assignment, who was in\ncharge, and we had to kind of a create a nucleus, a group of people who were responsible\nfor different things and we kind of made a presentation when, let\u2019s say, a commission\ncame from Warsaw from the National Board of Education to see the progress that we are\nmaking. Usually, they had come for accreditation and, you know, to evaluate the level of\neducation in the schools, and we had a very wonderful school. We had a really great high\nschool. So, I had friends from there with whom after school I had hardly contact, but it\u2019s\ninteresting that, when I went to school, things were not so good yet at home, and I had to\nenter \u2014 I mean, as I said before, any high school that you applied to you had to have an\nexam. So, I came out, I mean, very well on my exam. I was accepted to school. I was also\ngiven a 50 percent reduction in the tuition, but my tuition was twice as high as my sister\u2019s\nbecause hers was a federal school, and mine was a private school. But I was very\nfortunate that the teachers and the director of the school liked me a lot, and they\nrecommended to me for tutoring younger children. So, I went to school, and from school\nusually the kids were the kids of the white-collar clerks in Starachowice who were just\nabout ready to go to high school and they needed the preparatory exam and so, I was the\none who was spending like an hour twice a week tutoring them, preparing them for the\nexam, and I was getting paid for it. So, this in a way defrayed the cost of my education.\nSo, it was really interesting because on the one hand I was very secure and very accepted\nand comfortable, but if you were to say whether I was really seeking outright to be in\ntheir company, no, and for this reason, I don\u2019t know whether I would have been very\ncomfortable or I would have been uncomfortable, but I was well liked and respected. I\nam felt that I am very \u2014I mean, with the school friends, I had never felt any anti-Semitic\nthings directed at me personally. To the contrary, we were very, very friendly.",
        "Q: So, the war comes. Do you recall any preparation? Did you parents say what they think\nwas going to happen? Was it a complete shock? Do bombs go off - I mean, what\nhappens?",
        "A: It was very strange because we were for the new school year. And in addition to being a\nmember of a Zionist youth group, I was a member of a kind of a scout group. It was more\nthan a scout group. It was kind of a patriotic Polish group. I don\u2019t remember even the\nname, that when you entered high school, you were kind of elevated to a position of\nresponsibility, where you had to show your love for the country and responsibility, so\nforth and so on. So, being already in high school, I was a member of this particular group,\nand I loved Poland. I mean, to me, Poland was my country. I mean, I was a great patriot. I\nwas \u2014 to me, if you would think in terms of how much do you love the country, I mean,\nto feel really good and comfortable, I really loved Poland. Everything, Polish literature\nand whatever was Polish was the best thing in the world. There was nothing better. I\nreally enjoyed it. So, I remember that rather than to \u2014 like, a week earlier, before school\nstarted. We were called to come to school, and I can\u2019t recall who was the person who has\naddressed as members of this particular youth group, and they said to us \u2014 usually we\nwore the uniforms during May Day parades, you know, and we represented, carrying the\nflag of our school, and marched in the parade. So, they told us that we have to put on the\nuniforms and we have to gather not far from the factories because we have to dig trenches\nfor protection from attacks that may come from airplanes, that there may be a war and\nthere is a danger of being bombed due to the fact that we have these factories and that it\nis our duty of young people who love the country to do it. So, you know, I was so eager,\nyou know. We all went to the place where they gave us the spades and we walk along\nwith adults and we built the trenches and all that. Of course, they didn\u2019t drop the bombs\non our town. They just threw two bombs on the railroad station. They whole town, the\nwhole community left for the woods. Everybody was afraid that they\u20191l bomb us to\nsmithereens, and then I get, after the war, a Kalendarium, what they\u2019re called, from my\nhometown because I wanted to know more of what it was all about, you know. I went\nfrom childhood to adulthood and left the country. So, in the Kalendarium, I found out\nthat the chief executive officer of the factory that was appointed or whatever, placed \u2014\nwho has gotten this position three years before the war, was a German, a spy, who not\nonly spied for the Germans to let them know what is the operation like in this particular \u2014\nbecause that was a whole region, not just Starachowice. There was Skarzysko-Kamienna;\nthere was Radon; there was Pionki. They used to call it the central industrial area. So, we\nwere just one part of that whole region, and we found out this particular guy was a\nGerman who was maybe a Volks Deutsch, you know? But basically he was operating\nwith Germany, and he told them that to destroy that would be ridiculous. They needed it\nfor their war effort. So, I found out about it, you know, like in 1980, ten years ago, when\nI was finally established a very comfortable contact with my hometown, because I just\ndidn\u2019t want to think about Poland, you know? I came to the United States and what the\nUnited States represents cannot compare with any country in the world, and for this\nreason I kind of felt that don\u2019t forget the past, but don\u2019t live in the past. Whether it was\ngood or whether it was bad, it just doesn\u2019t make any difference, the past is the past, and\nfor as long as you live you have to look towards \u2014 deal with the present and look toward\nthe future. That\u2019s all to it.",
        "Q: So, you evacuated. You dug the ditches, no bombs came, and the whole town leaves.\nNow, did you \u2014 were you back at home when the evacuation happened? So, you went\nwith your parents and your sisters together?",
        "A: We all went, we all went into the woods, the forest, you know? And we could hear the\ntroops fighting, and we could hear the airplanes zooming by and bombs being dropped,\nbut we were like about eight kilometers from town, you know, in the woods, and when\neverything calmed down and it was quiet, we returned to town. So, we returned to town\nto find the situation like that. All the stores were looted. There was no food available.\nHomes were plundered. Whatever was, whatever was of value was taken away. Whether\nit was done by the Germans or whether it was done by the Polish neighbors, I don\u2019t\nknow, but that was the situation. I remember carrying the silver in a knapsack on my back\nto the woods and back, because Mother gave everybody something else to carry that was\nimportant. And we came back to home and our home, since we lived \u2014 by then we had\nmoved to a modern apartment, because the home where I grew up was an old home, and\nthe landlord didn\u2019t want to do much anymore in the repairing it and so forth and so on.\nSo, we moved to another apartment that was built like \u201937, and it was built by a Christian,\nby a Pole, Wierzchowski, and he occupied the upper floor, and we were living on the\nground floor, and so it wasn\u2019t really a Jewish courtyard anymore, you know, it was kind\nof a mix. There were some stores. I remember there was a Polish butcher who lived\nnearby in a small house, and I can\u2019t recollect because it was a short period of time that we\nlived there. So, due to the fact that we were not in a Jewish kind of \u2014 because some\ncourtyards, they had 20, 30 families, and mostly Jewish, you know, so if the homes were\nplundered, you know who did it. But here, due to the fact there weren\u2019t too many, and so,\nwe found everything in perfect order when I got home. So, there was nothing really that\nwas broken or removed or glass broken. I\u2019m sure that they wouldn\u2019t have dared, you\nknow? So... Because it was not a Jewish house. It was the property of a Pole, so they\ncouldn\u2019t break windows in order to get in or whatever. And so it was hard because there\nwas no food available and things were difficult to get.",
        "Q: Chris, can I interrupt you for a moment?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: When you came back, what was your first meal in the house? Can you describe what\nyour father asked you all to do when you first came back?",
        "A: Well, we came back, and of course, when we were out in the woods, you know, we didn\u2019t\nhave much food. We took some bread with us and maybe a salami if I remember\ncorrectly, but we couldn\u2019t get any food. So, it was September and we were very close.\nWe actually stayed in an agricultural school. Basically, it was a school, and also a kind of\na laboratory, research laboratory where they were trying to introduce, you know, new\nways of maybe growing things. So, there were a lot of cucumbers and a lot of tomatoes in\nthe field, which I imagine that they had been gathered and sold at the market normally,\nbut the war broke out and the students didn\u2019t come to school, so everything was left there.\nSo, we ate them. You know, you sit in the dirt and you ate and you don\u2019t have water to\nwash your hands and so forth and so on. We got back home, and we had some potatoes\nleft in the dark cellar because this is where you kept your roots for the winter, your root\nvegetables for the winter, and Mother went to the dark cellar and she brought up potatoes\nand Father says to set the table. So, we were kind of figuring on why does he insist on\nsetting the table. He says, \u201cI want the tablecloths on the table. I want the china on table.\u201d\nHe says, \u201cI want the silverware on the table, and the napkins and lace because, just\nbecause there is a war doesn\u2019t mean that we have to eat like animals. We have to\nremember that we are people and we have to conduct ourselves in this manner.\u201d And,\nthat\u2019s the kind of person that he was. That no matter what kind of a situation you\nencountered, first you have to always remember that you are a human being and you have\nto watch the way \u2014 you have to be aware of how you conduct yourself, and your behavior\nand there was always the priority, stressed on the importance of being civil and acting in\nproper manner, no matter what. So, we had our meal: that dry potato on a big plate. But\neverybody was happy. Father was happy. We washed the dishes afterwards. Everything\nwas fine.",
        "Q: Did the three of you as children find it odd, even after the meal? Or did you...?",
        "A: No, but that\u2019s the way it always has been. I mean, there was no kitchen table. The kitchen\nwas a working place, and in the kitchen, we had a huge table, but it was a table that had\nlike sides all around that was used like a work space where they were kneading the bread\nand cutting up the meat and doing all kinds of things, and you know, and baking and\ncooking and washing laundry and everything. That was what the kitchen was for. The\ndining room was where we ate, and it was this mahogany big table with the carved legs\nand the carved chairs around it, and whether it was breakfast or lunch or dinner, I mean,\nwe didn\u2019t eat in the same manner as we do in the United States. You know, breakfast was\nfast because we all had to go to school, and Mother packed a little lunch to take along,\nand dinner was usually when we returned from school. That was the main meal around\ntwo-thirty, and then in the evening was just a small bite for supper, you know. So, it was\njust a sandwich with cheese or whatever, but the main meal was always during the day.\nAnd, it wasn\u2019t like here in the United States when you have meat or fish every day for\nyour meal. I mean, a lot of times you make do with whatever was available, and mind\nyou, it\u2019s not availability depended not so much on how money you had, but on the\nseasons. If, let\u2019s say, there was at one time, there was one product in abundance, let\u2019s say,\nand then the summer there are other products in abundance, and 1n the fall different\nthings, and you kind of geared your whole planning around what was available in the\nparticular season. So, I remember, like, Cornish hens, young chickens, we used to have in\nthe summer, and the geese and ducks were in the fall and the winter, and then for springs\nthere were turkeys, I mean, but they were not every day on the table. We used to have\nlike maybe twice, three times a week meat. Otherwise, it was dairy products and you had\nto be very, very kind of inventive in order to create meals and my mother was a gourmet\ncook and she really \u2014 when she entertained, it was unbelievable. When she set that table,\nit was fit for a king. I have this craze now \u2014 I have four sets of dishes and with stemware\nand with everything and different tablecloths because I have to \u2014 when I set the table it\nhas to be \u2014 it has to have a very special touch. It\u2019s not just what\u2019s sitting there in the\ncloset, I?ll make an effort. Pll go to the back. Ill pull them out to set a certain mood. I\ndon\u2019t do it as much lately because the kids are older, I mean, our children are older. They\nare out of the house. And Renia is like that, too, you know. And my daughter is like this,\ntoo, now, very much aware of what the table should be like, regardless of the meal. But,\nto make an attractive table all by itself makes the whole meal so much more pleasant.\nWhether you eat a dry potato or whether you have a gourmet meal, it doesn\u2019t matter, but\nit is when you enter the dining room, what you create artistically about the looks\nenhances the food you eat like that, too.",
        "Q: Did you have a favorite food?",
        "A: Not really. I loved bread up until now \u2014 bread is my most favorite thing, but not really,\nnot really. I mean, when we were young, we didn\u2019t need food, and when we were in\ncamp, we didn\u2019t get food. So, however, speaking of food, while we are on the subject, I\nremember that when we finally were making our way home after the liberation, I turned\nto my older sister Hania, and I said, \u201cWhenever I have the opportunity to cook a soup.\u201d\nThe soups in camp were hardly \u2014 I mean, you couldn\u2019t call it soup because it was water\nwith some on the bottom, and some floating potato peels may be in it\nat the most. So, I used to say, \u201cWhen I cook a soup, it\u2019s going to be thick that when I put\na spoon into it, it will stand all on its own.\u201d That was my dream. And, Hania said to me, I\nremember what she said, she said, \u201cAnd I\u2019m going and I would like to have a whole loaf\nof bread and not to have to share it with anyone.\u201d",
        "Q: So, did you live up to that? Is that how you cook soup?",
        "A: Oh, I cook great soups. Bean and barley is the most favorite because it\u2019s the thickest. The\nspoon doesn\u2019t stand up on its own. It doesn\u2019t stand on its own, it needs support, but it\u2019s\ngood.",
        "Q: Chris, the first meal that you have when you come back, that meal, and the war had\nstarted, is there conversation around the table? Are you all frightened or do you feel\nfrightened? Or, I mean, nothing?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember. I don\u2019t remember, but you know, we felt so secure with our parents\naround us. You know, we never had to worry or plan our future. You know? We were in\na home where the parents supervised our activities. I mean, they planned our schooling,\nthey planned where we go to school, and we were very obedient children because we\nknew that whatever our parents are planning for us, for our future, that they know what\nthey want and what we should be like from their own personal experience. And it\u2019s not\njust, you know, in some cases, where there were a lot of people that were totally illiterate\nbefore the war. There were people whose literacy was very limited. Some people had two\nyears of education, three years of education. They felt the need of education. They didn\u2019t\nhave the opportunity. Therefore they wanted to give their children the opportunity to\nknow more then they did. And the compulsory years of study in school, in elementary\nschools in Poland, was kindergarten through seventh grade. After seventh grade, you had\nenough. It could carry you through life, you know, and you were literate and you could\nread the paper, and you knew math and you knew everything. But if you went to high\nschool, then you were only in school for six years. And, it is like the junior high schools\nhere, that was your first year of high school education, because we went from six years of\nelementary schools to four years of high school and then two years of Litsonian (ph)\nwhich prepared you for the study at the university. So, if you think in terms of years of\nschooling, it was like 12 years from beginning to end, from grade one to entering the\nuniversity, if you so desired. So, in my parents case, you know they were both educated,\nand education was very important to them and there was no question. I mean, there was\nno question whether we want or we don\u2019t want. It\u2019s like, you get up in the morning and\nyou have to brush your teeth and wash your face and have breakfast, and so you have to\nstudy, that\u2019s it. That\u2019s part of your daily activity.",
        "Q: So, if you\u2019re not feeling fear at that moment, when do things start changing in some\nradical way as far as you remember?",
        "A: Things start changing as soon as we see the action of the Nazi military in town. In the\nbeginning, you know, when the marched into town, nothing happened. Nobody greeted\nthem with flowers, that\u2019s for sure.",
        "Q: Not the Poles, not the Jews...?",
        "A: No, because you see in areas where they had \u2014 since the borders were constantly shifting.\nSo, whether or not, you know, after the plebiscite, this is the right word in English, as\nwell?",
        "Q: Plebiscite.",
        "A: Plebiscite, thank you. Depending on where you lived, you know, once the border was\ndrawn, whether you originally German or originally Polish, wherever you lived, you\nbecame the citizens of this particular country. So, since the borders had been shifting\nconstantly, there were a lot of German families who, after the First World War, after the\npact in Versailles, were separated from their families and so forth and so on, and\nremained on the new Polish territories. So, some of them spoke Polish because in their\nfamilies there were Poles and there were Germans and Poles and Germans, and they were\nintermarried so it didn\u2019t really matter that much. But, in some cases, the people felt very\nstrong attachment to Germany, and they con-, inasmuch as they did in Poland, and they\nsend the children to Polish schools, they considered themselves Germans. So, when the\nGermans entered Poland, of course, they were more then happy to welcome them because\nthis is what they always wanted. We lived in central Poland, so we were far removed\nfrom both influences, the Russians and the Germans and even the Austrians from the\nsouth; because we were part of that heart of Poland that Napoleon has created in a way,\nthat Kongrasuvka (ph) that he called. So, this 1s why they came, the Germans came,\nmarched through town and sang the songs and all that, with victorious people, came. And\nit took about two or three weeks before they had organized the whole thing. And they\nstarted to catch Jews in the street to do work. Actually, not so much for work as to\nhumiliate the Jew. So, I remember, I was walking with my father in the street, and he was\nan elegant man, as I said before, and always proper and always neat, always neat, and he\nwas wearing a hat and a suit and we walking on the sidewalk, and a German walks by\nfrom the opposite direction, and he says, \u201cYou\u2019re a Jew! You have no right to walk on\nthe sidewalk. The sidewalks are not meant for the Jews.\u201d And, he pushed him.\nUnexpectedly \u2014 I mean when somebody attacks you like that \u2014 and he pushed him in the\ngutter. Really, he fell into the gutter and he was wearing glasses, and his hat fell off. He\nwas wearing a hat not because he was religious, but that was part of that elegance of his\nkind of a demeanor. And his glasses fell and he felt so horrible, so humiliated, and the\nguy kicked him over and over again, and he wanted to pick himself up. I remember, he\nspoke, no, he was asked him, \u201cBist du ein Jude?\u201d - Are you a Jew? And he said, \u201cYes!\u201d\nAnd since my father had a lot of dealings with German people, I mean, at the time he had\nbusiness contacts. Before the war, he was representing an international company and the\npeople at the time he dealt were also business people from also large companies. So,\nthere has never been in my father\u2019s, I imagine, mind a disrespect for him being a Jew.\nAnd just from the soldier walking and at the mere fact that he was honest and said he was\na Jew, to be pushed off the sidewalk into the gutter and to be kicked when he tried to pick\nhimself up, and his glasses broke, and he was bruised on his face, and he got all dirty and\neverything, that was the first indication. I mean, this is for the first time that I understood\nwhat the war was all about. Up until that time, I don\u2019t think I could comprehend what war\nreally means because the stories that I have heard from either my parents or my grandma\nabout wars before, like the First World War, they had experienced, was basically\ncontained in the area in which they \u2014 through which the front went through. Fifty\nkilometers away from the front, life has not been disturbed in any way whatsoever. Only,\nif you happen to find yourself in the path of marching troops or battles or whatever, that\nyou knew that there was a war. But, in that Blitzkrieg that the Nazis created, there was no\nsuch thing as so to say limiting to one specific area or having battles in one area. They\njust went through the whole country - within one week, there was no Polish government\nanymore, and immediately the Nazi occupation took over.",
        "Q: Did this man hurt you, as well?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: He didn\u2019t touch you?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: So, did you yell at him? I mean, do you have any recollection?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember exactly. I didn\u2019t remember whether I ran home and left my father to tell\nmy mother maybe. You know, it is something that I only remember how hurt he was\nwhen he came in. I don\u2019t remember, maybe, I think that I was with him. But anyhow, I\nremember how distraught he was when he came home from being treated in such a\nmanner. He could speak with them and converse, you know, and I am sure that he would\nhave expected to kind of say something. But with a soldier that carries a gun in his hand\nand beats you and kicks you, I mean, there isn\u2019t much you can do. So, that was his first\nhumiliation, and I think that this was an experience that made me aware that times have\nchanged or are just about to change.",
        "Q: Do you remember sharing this with your older sister?",
        "A: I really don\u2019t remember. I just know that Father was so bruised and so beaten and he had\nbroken glasses, you know. He was wearing eyeglasses, that there wasn\u2019t anything to ask\nabout. I\u2019m sure that everybody realized what that situation was like. Of course, we didn\u2019t\ngo out in the street anymore, and the Judenrat was formed, and they came around and\nconfiscated valuable things from everybody\u2019s home.",
        "Q: Did they take away your encyclopedia?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember. I don\u2019t remember. I don\u2019t think so. We lived already in the new\napartment, and Father had a desk. We didn\u2019t have this extra room for him. So, Father\u2019s\ndesk was placed in the living room, and I think that \u2014 I don\u2019t remember what ever\nhappened to the books.",
        "Q: Do you remember Germans coming in and confiscating things?",
        "A: I remember Germans came in and looked around, and of course, you know, everybody\nwas aware that they are coming and asking for things. They were elegant. They were not\njust soldiers who were coming; they were officers who were coming to different homes.\nAnd they used to look around and if they liked something, they just asked to be wrapped.\nI remember a friend of mine used to say - he came in and he saw that \u00e9pini\u00e9re on the\ntable, and he says to my mother, \u201cOh, das ist schoen. Bitte mir das einpacken,\u201d as if to\nsay, \u201cThis is beautiful. Please wrap it for me.\u201d You know? So, this is one of the sayings\nthat I remember from confiscating things. Again, I think that due to the fact that we were\nnot really \u2014 the second, the new apartment that we were in, since it has not been\nnecessarily an all-together Jewish courtyard, that I don\u2019t remember the Germans coming,\nreally coming in. But what I remember from the second apartment that we lived is the\nwar Started, there was no school for Jewish children, none whatsoever. We were all\nschool age. And again, I\u2019m going to bring in my parents, you don\u2019t leave children\nhanging around doing nothing. So, again, my mother\u2019s ingenuity, she says, \u201cListen, it\u2019s\nwar. You cannot go to school. This does not mean that you\u2019re going to sit idle.\u201d Hania is\nolder than you. In 1940, we already had a lot of Jews from large and from Lodz and from\nPoznan (ph), you know, from the regions that were incorporated into the Reich. And from\nthe large cities, people were displaced and were brought to our town with children who\nwere our contemporaries, and they were educated people, and they were sophisticated\npeople. So, my mother, in order for me to not to kind of be my sister\u2019s student, where she\nwould kind of do whatever she wants with me, maybe, has gotten three other youngsters\nwho were my contemporaries, and my older sister was teaching us every day as if we\nwere to go to a regular school, okay? When I was done with my classes \u2014 they were in the\nafternoon \u2014 in the morning, I was teaching younger children. And here we have in the\nnew apartment, we already had a small kitchen table. So, while my older sister was with\nsome student in the living room, I was sitting on the window, I remember, on the ledge. It\nwas summertime. It was so nice and warm in the forties, and I loved the sun \u2014 and I had\naround the table these little kids who I taught to read and taught to write. And it was that\nthing that we continued, you know, to keep ourselves busy, number one, to continue with\nour educations, number two, and even Renia used to play with the little kids. These were\nnot even of school age, but just to give her something to do. So, we had this kind of a\nfeeling of responsibility to ourselves, and to others as well. So, it was all the kids in the\nneighborhood and mostly children of our friends younger then us.",
        "Q: Didn\u2019t Hania also teach Renia?",
        "A: Yes, that\u2019s what I said. Because Hania was teaching Renita in the morning \u2014 when I was\nteaching my class, Hania was teaching in the morning, but I was her student. And, in the\nafternoon, because some of the boys who were coming to class were working, I think \u2014\nyou know, there was an obligatory labor that you had to submit to every day. I mean, if\nyou were called, not every day, but there were all kinds of jobs that required on the part\nof the German Nazi administration that needed to be done, and the boys who were at the\ntime 15 or 16, instead of having their fathers go and do the job, they went to work. So, we\nwould really study later on in the afternoon when they came back from work.",
        "Q: Okay, let\u2019s take a break.\nEnd of Tape #2\nTape #3",
        "Q: Did you not go out very much in those months when you were...?",
        "A: No, we went very little. First of all, we were very busy. I mean, Mother saw to it that we\nwere kept busy, and constructive busy, which was very important. But, we used to get\ntogether with friends, you know, and since our ghetto was not closed ghetto, 1t was an\nopen ghetto, it means that part of the town where there was a large concentration of Jews\nwas, got to be a little more crowded with the fact that there were newcomers coming\nthrough from territories that were incorporated in the Reich, and also the few who lived\nnot really in Jewish sections were forced to move out and to move into the designated\nghetto area, and this is what happened to us in the \u201940s. We left everything behind in the\napartment because we just \u2014 instead of having a three-bedroom, three-bedroom \u2014 a four-\nroom apartment, we move into a one-room apartment. It was large enough, you know, for\nus to put beds at one end and tables, and a table at the other. We kind of had some space;\nwe were not crowded. But we still had Polish people living near us, you know. So, some\nsections of town were completely eliminated from Jews, but other sections with Jews and\nnon-Jews lived together. Of course, the more people were coming in, the more we were\ncrowded, and we had to kind of accept another family to live with us. And when you live\nwith a family and you are limited to the space and you lose some privacy, it\u2019s all right\nwhen you were only with your own family. But when another family comes in that you\ndon\u2019t know, that is totally strange, whose living habits are different from yours, and who\nare uprooted and who are strange, and it had this problem with adjustment. No matter\nhow hospitable you are, you still have to have a certain amount of privacy, and this\ncoexistence with strangers was a very difficult thing to overcome. Oh, it was okay. And\nthen we find an apartment which was the last apartment before the ghetto was liquidated,\nwhich was a house on the border of \u2014 almost out of town \u2014 which was the borderline, but\nthe end of the ghetto. And there was a property and this property was kind of a duplex. It\nwas on the river. It was a duplex, and in one part of the house was the owner, who was\nPolish, on the side of the non-ghetto side, and this was kind of still considered to be part\nof the ghetto. So, in this house, we had a bedroom and a kitchen, and we didn\u2019t have\nanybody to live with us because he wouldn\u2019t allow \u2014 the Polish owner would not allow\nany more than just one family. So, in a way, this gave us, you know, again, a better\nfeeling of a family unit, you know, that we had a little more privacy. But, we were\ngathering with our friends. Some of them had on the outskirts, like, I had a friend who\nwent to school with me and they also were in the lumber business that was established by\ntheir grandfather. They were well-to-do people, and we used to go. They had the river,\nand they were, you know \u2014 because they needed the water for the processing of wood,\nthey were \u2014 like Bentwood for chairs, you know, this was their business. So, it was really\nwonderful. It was secluded, and they had like a little beach area. So, this 1s where we\nused to go Saturdays, and just sit around and talk and have time, you know, with our\nfriends to ourselves. And, Saturdays usually was a quite time, you know, and Sundays,\ntoo. So, her parents were very, very religious. So, she liked to be with us. We had this\nfreedom. We used to sit on the beach and enjoy the sunshine and talk, and everybody was\ndoing something important. I remember one friend was a terrific knitter. She could knit\nanything in the world, and she used to sit and knit sweaters, you know, and this is the\nway how she was supporting herself during the war because I think she lost her mother.\nHer father was in Israel. They were supposed to go to Israel, and I don\u2019t know how it\ncame about, but she was alone and she lived, so to say, with the cousins, and she was\nsitting always and knitting, and this is how she used to support herself. She used to make\nthe most beautiful hand-knitted sweaters and everything. But, those days you don\u2019t have\nno yarn. So, you used to rip apart old scarves, and old sweaters, and caps and whatever,\nand make a new garment and you have to be a genius to match the colors, to come up\nwith an interesting product, which she always did. She was wonderful. And we used to\nspend time, and that was our free time, you know. Again, it was always in the company\nof the friends with who I went to Hebrew school and who were my, so to say, also\nmembers of the Zionist youth group and we were recollecting, you know, reminiscing the\nwonderful days that we had. We had a leader in the youth group. At first, we had a group\nwhen we were very young; we belonged to Hano\u2019ar Ha\u2019t Zioni. That was the Zionist\nchildren\u2019s group. And then, when we got a little bit older, there was a kind of another\nbranch of the same organization, but 1t was more on an intellectual level, and it was\ncalled Akiba and Akiba used to be, I mean, we didn\u2019t have anyone in town who could\nreally supervise us at this level. So, Krakow was the center or Akiba, and they were\nsending to us leaders who were coming once a week to spend time with, once a month,\nI\u2019m sorry \u2014 to spend time and teach us songs and lecture and discuss Hebrew writers and\nHachman Bialik and all those things. So, we \u2014 I remember one leader who was with us in\n1939 and her name was Vushka Liebeskind and she was, during the war, she married\nDolek Liebeskind, who was the head of the resistance movement in Krakow. So, to us\nshe was everything in the world. We couldn\u2019t wait long enough for her, you know, from\none month to the other to come. And mind you that in Auschwitz, she found us. She was\nin prison too. And what she has done to our spirit in one hour, in Auschwitz, when we\nwere really \u2014 it was Yom Kippur. We were \u2014 we arrived in July and we lost completely\ntrack of time, and I don\u2019t know whether the holidays fell in September or October, but\nsomewhere around there. I don\u2019t remember exactly. She has been in prison since 1943,\nand because she was the kind of a person she was, and had outside contacts due to the\nfact that they were part of the resistance movement in Krakow, that she had connections\nwhich allowed her to kind of move around the camp a lot freer, let\u2019s say, than a person\nwithout connections. And I understand now that she was the one who put the emphasis in\nthe spiritual aspect of that survival in concentration camp, and from what I heard about\nher was that she was finding little pieces of candles that were \u2014 you know, in the\nbeginning, there was no electricity in camp, so they used candles, or whenever they were\nnot allowed to use electricity and they still needed in the barracks a light, you know, for\nthe work, for the administrative work, they had the candles. So, when the candle was\nalmost at the end, you know, it was discarded. So, from what I understand, she used to\ncollect the pieces of candles and bring them to people on Friday night, right before the\nLagerruhe, you know, before people were not allowed to leave the barracks. And she\nused to say the blessings and people \u2014 it did not make to her any difference which\nbarracks she went to, wherever there were women \u2014 and that\u2019s what she did. And we\nwere already, so to say, with a noose around our necks, in such a bad situation, because it\nwas already three months that we already arrived in Birkenau, and you know, that it was,\nso to say, a point where we didn\u2019t say any chance for survival or anything. And I\nremember we came from the ward, and a very pretty woman with a striped uniform and a\nkerchief around her hair, you know, her hair was cropped short. She was not \u2014 her head\nwas not shaved like ours, but she had this and she had very good shoes on her feet, and I\nthought, \u201cWell, you have to be well connected to kind of look this way when you were in\ncamp.\u201d And she started to ask around. It was after the Zahlappel, after we had been\ncounted. Sometimes we had like half an hour before we were allowed to the barracks, or\nsometimes we were immediately forced to go into the barracks, and she says, \u201cAre any\ngirls her from Starachowice?\u201d So, there were five or six of us that were members of the\nyouth movement, and she told us who she was. Of course, we were unrecognizable at the\ntime. I mean, from hunger and from beating and from the condition that we were and the\nclothes that we wore, we all looked like skeletons already and ridiculous really. So, she\nsays, \u201cGirls, don\u2019t worry.\u201d She says, \u201cI\u2019m going to visit you again,\u201d and she says, \u201cIt\u2019s\nlate now. I must run to the barracks before they catch me after the allowed time to be\noutside.\u201d\u2019 And, then she came. And it was the eve of Yom Kippur, Kol Nidre night. And\nshe came with candles, and she got up on the bunk bed and the candles were lit, and\nnobody knew Kol Nidre by heart. I mean, we were \u2014 how could we remember? We\nremembered the chanting, just the melody. So, we were chanting the Kol Nidre melody,\nand it was kind of an outpour of a feeling for unity, because it was something that we had\nin common from not from this period in Auschwitz, but from another time. And, of\ncourse, we couldn\u2019t have that much time to spend with her so, she just brought the spirit\nof the holiday to us, and kissed and she says, \u201cDon\u2019t give up.\u201d I remember, \u201cDon\u2019t give\nup.\u201d And we parted company. And when we stopped our chanting, the barracks was\ndivided in four sections, and the extreme left of our barracks, there was a group of\nwomen from Italy, Jewish women from Italy. And when we stopped the Kol Nidre, they\nstarted to sing \u201cMama Son Tanta Felice\u2019, like an expression of their longing to the life\nthat they had been deprived of just like we. Ours was a religious expression of some thing\nthat was meaningful and traditional. They maybe did not understand. I\u2019m sure they were\nJews. They should have been familiar, but their reaction to this chanting in a very quiet\nvoice coming from the other side was just so overwhelming that I will never forget it. So,\nwhat I think about it is that in the worse times, when you have a little spark of normalcy,\nwhen you can\u2019t think what life is really like in normal existence, when you think in terms\nof the holiday and observing the holiday and preparing for it, or whatever connection you\nhave, you know, with something that is near and dear to you, if you can create it in the\nmost horrible situation, it still can be very, very uplifting. I shouldn\u2019t...cry.",
        "Q: Do you know that Italian song?",
        "A: I know it, yes, but I don\u2019t know the whole thing. I know...",
        "Q: Can you sing a little bit of it?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know if I can sing now after all this crying. I don\u2019t know the words. I know it goes\nlike this: [Sings first part] I don\u2019t know the words really. [Sings on \u2018la\u2019]. And then it\nstarts [Sings on \u2018la\u2019]. And, then it was a beautiful very beautiful song, and the word\n\u201cMama\u201d. Mama, you know, inasmuch as it starts \u201cMama Son Tanta Felice\u2019, which\nmeans Mama, I\u2019m so happy, but you know when I think of this melody and when I heard\nit for the first time, you know, and it kind of reminds me of Mein Yiddishe Mame to a\ncertain extent, it\u2019s a different mama, it\u2019s a different situation, but it\u2019s the longing for\nhome. It\u2019s the longing for mother. It\u2019s the mother who, in my opinion, that it represents\nthe home, and the security and everything, and this is what they really needed and this is\nwhat they wanted. So, Pll wipe my eyes.",
        "Q: Are you okay?",
        "A: I\u2019m fine.",
        "Q: So, if we can go back to the ghetto now, for... If you can explain to people, because they\ndon\u2019t \u2014 there are different ways in which ghettos function, different ways people moved.\nWhen you have to move from your apartment that you were living underneath the gentile,\nthe Polish Catholic, were you forced to moved out and forced to move into a particular\nplace or did you choose the place?",
        "A: Well, we couldn\u2019t choose much really. You see the Judenrat was formed, and then\nJudenrat was basically the administration of the ghetto and the people, and they were\nresponsible for all the demands made by the Nazi authorities or whatever. Whether it was\na demand for contributions or whether it was a demand for labor or whether it was \u2014\nwhatever the demand was. So, my father, due to the fact that he was very familiar with\nfigures and very familiar with the German language was asked by the Judenrat to\nsupervise the working groups that were coming daily to work. They gave him this job,\nyou know, he was not part of the Judenrat. He was not a member of the Judenrat, but\nrather than to have the soldiers come every morning and catch people in the street,\nwhoever was available and most of the people who were caught in the street where not\neven fit for the work that they wanted them to do. So, the Judenrat came to the conclusion\nthat it would be much better if there was like an employment office where the authority,\nthe Nazi authorities would come and say, \u201cWe need that many, so-and-so people\ntomorrow for work.\u201d And, that this number of people should be sent for the daily work\nand eliminate this Lapaniki, as they call them, that they can \u2014 Lapac means to drag, to\ndrag people off the street. So, they gave my father the job. My father \u2014 they gave him a\nlist of all the people who were registered because food was rationed, so in order to\nreceive food you have to register with the Judenrat, whether you were a local person or\nwhether you were a person who was brought from a different area to town. All those\npeople had to be registered. So, the first job my father was given is to register all the\npeople who are able to perform work. Now, in the open ghetto, there were still people\nconducting business, because once things had settled down there wasn\u2019t that much\nbusiness. You didn\u2019t deal in extraordinary things, but you know, the guy who was selling\nshoes and galoshes, as long as he had a supplier who provided the merchandise to him, he\ncould do it, or the guy was selling sweaters or whatever. The bakery had to be run, you\nknow, and all that. So, first of all, the Judenrat gave my father the entire list of people\nwho were able to work, and on this basis, my father could prepare a list. Let\u2019s say there\nwas a demand for 200 people or 100 people whatever it was, and he has arranged it in\nsuch a way that everybody had to perform the work once a week in the beginning.\nAssuming that you were designated to come to work on Tuesday, and either you were too\nbusy or you didn\u2019t want to, as long as you were able to pay another person to fill in for\nyou, it was okay. And there were \u2014 those people who didn\u2019t want or couldn\u2019t go and were\nable to afford it were more than happy to pay for the day\u2019s work to another person, and in\nmost cases, the people who were filling for this person were people who were displaced,\nwho needed the day\u2019s work, because when they went to work they got paid from the man\nwhose place they have taken, and they have gotten a bowl of soup and some bread on the\njob. So, this worked extremely well, and it was calm due to the fact that Father could \u2014\nwhat do I want to say \u2014 he communicated with them and there were no beatings and there\nwas no chasing and there was no running, and it was calm and it was good. As a matter of\nfact, you know, he sometimes used to come home and say, \u201cIt\u2019s such a shame,\u201d he says,\n\u2018T had so many eager people today who wanted to go and work, and there was none of\ndemand for them to be sent.\u201d It was just \u2014 that was in the beginning, because later on the\nwhole thing didn\u2019t matter, you know, no matter how orderly you were. But there were\nreally people coming there every morning and sitting there waiting for someone who\ncame in and say, \u201cI\u2019m not going to work today. Who\u2019s the guy who\u2019s going to be in my\nplace and take it for the day?\u201d It was a perfect kind of an arrangement, and it was peace\nand calm and wonderful, and it went on like this because the jobs were meaningless in\nthe beginning. All they did was to humiliate the people, to get them out, the permanent\npeople in the community, and kick them and beat them, just like the incident with my\nfather, and just make life difficult. But when things began to kind of become more or less\norderly, they came to the conclusion that they needed the Jews not just for the manual\nwork of sweeping the street, giving the permanent people a broom to sweep or whatever\nto humiliate them, but they can use them performing manual work in factories. They\nstarted to make demands for labor force for the factory. So, this whole thing changed\nabout, too, because, from that group that was trying to kind of find other people to fill for\nthem at work, they realized what 1s going on in other parts of the country, where people,\nif they are not employed, are been resettled, taken away, that they seek themselves\nemployment and in order to have the arbeitskarte, they went to work. So, there\u2019s this\narbeitskarte, which is the certificate of employment, protected you from being deported\nlater on. So, you know, everything was kind of a gradual change from a bad situation into\na worse situation, and constantly changing because the demands were greater and greater\nand greater. First they took away your money, and then they took away your valuables\nand your furs \u2014 do you know that as a child in my picture with my two sisters, I\u2019m\nwearing like a three-quarter coat that already I was growing and it was time for me to get\na new coat. And then the war broke out and I still had that coat. It was very warm\nbecause it had a lining, a fur lining, that I was walking in that jacket in the street and a\nGerman soldier ripped off the fur collar of my coat, telling me that a Jew does not wear\nfur. It was not a fur piece. He did not even know the lining there was like a shell would\nyou say, right? But just by ripping off a collar of my coat... So, you know, they were\nimposing all kinds of things every day, every day. First, you know, that they confiscated\nthe valuables from you. They took everything you had. Then they made you wear the\narmband with \u2014 the white armband with the blue star, the Star of David, and no matter\nhow old you were, whether you were ten years old or whether you were an old person,\nyou had to be identified as a Jew. And if they caught you without the armband and, even\nthough for us to mix in with the Polish population wasn\u2019t so difficult because we weren\u2019t\nreally locked in or fenced in, but nobody, nobody dared to even to take off the armband.\nWe kind of felt that this 1s what we have to, and this is how we have to work, and it\u2019s\ngoing to be all right, and the Judenrat really, the people who were in the Judenrat were\npeople who were leaders of the community before the war. They were decent, nice,\nelegant people who were friends of my parents, who were members of the Zionist\norganization, who worked together, you know, and they just assumed this responsibility\nto have a peaceful Jewish community, for it to continue. But you never knew, every\nmorning was a different demand for the special assessment of funds. They came that\nunless the community\u2019s going to produce so and so many zlotys, you know, for whatever\nwithin 24 hours, there are going to be measures taken that everybody\u2019s going to regret.\nSo, of course, each and every family was assessed with some contribution 1n order to\ncreate the funds that were demanded. So, life wasn\u2019t easy, but Father was pleased that he\ncould occupy peacetime in a very constructive way, and he was instrumental in creating,\nso to say, a controlled atmosphere in the ghetto, where Jews did not have to be grabbed in\nthe morning, you know, whether they were on their way to a morning service or running\n\u2014 there was no synagogue, anyhow, because the synagogue was burned on Yom Kippur\nday in our town. They thought that Kol Nidre night \u2014 they didn\u2019t realize that Kol Nidre\nwas the eve before Yom Kippur, and they knew that the Jews are going to be congregated\non Yom Kippur in the synagogue. So, they came in the evening hoping that the\nsynagogue is going to be full of Jews, and torched it. But nobody was there and nobody\nprayed in the synagogue anyhow; everybody had their prayers in home in, you know, and\ngathered in private homes or in the quarters of different organizations that they had, like\nsmall little clubs. They weren\u2019t really \u201cclubs\u201d as we know them in the United States, but,\nyou know, a gathering place for different organizations because there was the general\nZionists and there was the Betar and there was the revisionists and, you know, that was\nthe group of Jabotinsky and there was an orthodox group of Jews who I don\u2019t remember\nthe name of their organization. So, you know, it was more like gathering out of sight\nwhere you couldn\u2019t be too obvious and not too many people at the same time could be\nfound in one particular place.",
        "Q: Do you remember approximately what year the synagogue was burned?",
        "A: That was 1939.",
        "Q: It was 1939, right at the beginning.",
        "A: First Yom Kippur.",
        "Q: So, let me go back to my question about the moving. When you moved from the house to\nthis more modern place...",
        "A: That was very modern by comparison with what was available. So, we moved and this\napartment has been given to us by the Judenrat because they knew which homes were 1n\nthe ghetto where you were permitted to live and, on the basis of how large the family\nwas, they were so to say \u2014 it\u2019s like my father, who was running the department of\nsupplying the labor force to the factories, there was a person who was in charge of\nallocating living quarters for people. So, I really don\u2019t know who was in charge, but\nanyhow, when we were forced to move from that apartment, we went to live in that one\nroom which was a large room, a very large room, but it was not \u2014 it must have been a\nstore at one time or another because I vaguely remember seeing a stove or anything like\nthat. It was kind of \u2014 it was a large space, but nothing to it, and then when we had to\nshare it with another family because it was such a large space, it was not a home of any\nkind. This is why my memories are so... not quite clear. All I remember 1s that it was a\nlarge space. It was our second move. It was our \u2014 we had another move yet. From there,\nwe had to move to another one which was a courtyard also full of Jews, and there, it was\nall very, very hard, because we were so many families. Not just in our apartment, we\nalways had to share an apartment with another family, but there were \u2014 every single\napartment had additional people and depending on the size, you know, you were allowed\nto a room and then you shared the kitchen facilities or whatever. So, that was the third\nmove, and then finally, this for the last year or so in the ghetto, this apartment on the\nborder of the ghetto and the outside of the ghetto was available, and this is, I\u2019m sure that\nit\u2019s, it has been wonderful, it has been a blessing to be able to be by ourselves, but then\nMother was working, and every apartment has something that was so painful and so\nhorrible. Mother was working with people as I told you before, and she was the one who\nhad helped to organize the soup kitchens for the people who were coming, brought to the\nghetto and they were bringing constantly people because they needed people to work in\nthe factories. So, and there were a lot of destitute people who had nothing so, providing\nfor them, everyone to live, was one of the most important things. Providing for them a\njob where they could go to the factory and even though at the time we weren\u2019t paid\nanything, anymore \u2014 once you went to the factory, you were not paid a penny, and by that\ntime, everybody was anxious to have an employment card. So, nobody was willing to\ngive the destitute people any help. So, they organized the soup kitchen, and Mother was\nthere working every day, and one day she came home and she was sick with Typhoid.",
        "Q: Typhoid? Typhus or Typhoid?",
        "A: Typhus, typhus from lice. She must have been bitten by a lice working with the poor\npeople, by a louse, and she got very, very sick. And I was always there, in no matter what\nsituation, I was the one who was the most trained to be of assistance, and I\u2019Il tell you\nwhy. A very logical thing \u2014 my oldest sister was not home. She was away in school when\nshe was growing up. She left home very early at the age of twelve. So, she wasn\u2019t around\nhome base, you know, to be taught or to observe or to learn. Renia, my little sister, was a\nlittle thing. So, I always \u2014 it seems like my parents kind of felt that I am of more help to\nthem than anyone of us. So, I remember that when Mother got very sick and the doctor\ncame to see her \u2014 you know, we had Jewish doctors in town and they all were friends. It\u2019s\nnot just like \u2014 they didn\u2019t come as a doctor. They came to help you because they were\ndoctors and they had the medical knowledge. And I remember how the doctor sat down\nwith me and he said to me \u2014 it was like the fourth or the fifth day, and it takes like six\ndays, twelve days from the time when you get sick until you go through the crisis. So, in\nthe beginning, you know, he just was coming in every day to look after her and gave her\nwhatever kind of medication he had available. I don\u2019t know. But then, towards the eighth\nday, he sat me down and he said to me, \u201cIt\u2019s going to be very, very difficult for your\nmother for the next four days, and I want you to know that you, that it\u2019s up to you how\nmuch attention you are going to pay and how much time you are going to spend with her\nin order to assist her and pull through this difficult period.\u201d And, he explained to me what\nkind of symptoms to look for, that her fever is going to get very, very high, and there is\nvery little medication that can be acquired because, you know, it\u2019s not normal times, and\nhe will try his very best but he doesn\u2019t know how much he can do, that I have to always\nbe at my mother\u2019s bedside, that she does not need food, but she needs that constant\npresence by her side, because the fever is going to be very, very high and I have to watch\nher very carefully and I have to have a basin of cold water and I have to have washcloths\nto change her compress on her head. That was the only thing you could do to kind of\nbring down the temperature. And, you know, I listened. You know, somebody said to me\nthat I am very good in doing thing, you know, the right way. I am always following\ninstructions very carefully because what I am taught; I was always told very carefully\nhow to proceed in doing things. So, if you follow instructions, you follow instructions.\nBut, anyhow, this was his advice and I didn\u2019t know what to anticipate really, but I\nlistened very carefully and I got prepared. And the tenth day was not so bad. Mother was\nstill aware of the fact that I was around, and the doctor told me that nobody should be in\nthe room with her, just I, and to keep the shades 1n the window closed so that the room is\ndark. It should not disturb her, so that she has a lot of sleep, because this is very, very\nimportant, but at the same time, I shouldn\u2019t allow her to sleep for too long, because this is\nvery bad for her. Mind you, I\u2019m only fifteen years old or sixteen, whatever \u2014 and, you\nknow, the worst day was the night of the eleventh, the eleventh day of her sickness.\nWhen I touched her, the heat was unbelievable and she \u2014 she was kind of delirious, she\ndidn\u2019t know what was happening, and she was talking and she was saying, \u201cTake her\naway from me. I just don\u2019t like her. She is so ugly. She is so horrible with the black\nclothes on.\u201d I\u2019m sitting there with the person that I love so much, and here is this horrible\nresponsibility on my shoulders, and the doctors gave strict orders to everybody. He said,\n\u201cPull the mattress out of this room, put it in the kitchen somewhere, and stay if you want.\nIf you want your mother to live, you have got to give her total and complete peace and\nquiet.\u201d It was something that I\u2019ll never forget because, if you think in terms of fighting\nback, you know, and having that strength to realize that this is the moment, and asking\nfor this death to be taken away. I mean, after all, who is there in the black thing looking\nhorrible? You know, and that was very, very difficult \u2014 later afternoon, usually the\ntemperature was rising. In the morning, the temperature was not as high, but as the\nafternoon set in it was always very, very high and it was getting higher and very bad, and\nI was changing her compresses and holding my hand on her hand to just give her\ncomfort, for her to know that somebody is with her, and finally the following morning,\nshe opened her eyes. And I could see that she feels better because for two days, she didn\u2019t\neven \u2014 her eyes were just almost, not completely closed, but I could see that the\ntemperature was really getting her down. And, you know, then she got well. I felt good\nthat I have a mother. That was wonderful, very happy, that I was capable to do the job.\nMy sisters, of course, no doubt, were just as happy as I was, and Mother went right back\nto work as soon as she felt better, she resumed her obligations that was the community\nand the people in the community and so forth and so on. Then, more and more people had\nto be employed in the factories so everybody who lived in town outside of the very old\nand the very sick had to go to work, and Mother was working also in the factories in a\ndepartment, and my little sister was working in the factory, and Hania, my older sister,\nand myself were working in the beginning in a brick factory because they needed brick\nfor construction of new space for the manufacture of arms, and Father was in charge of\nthe arbeitsamt, making sure that if somebody was sick and couldn\u2019t go to work, that he\nfound someone who went to work that day, and then came the liquidation of the ghetto.",
        "Q: Can I ask you something?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: You were fifteen or sixteen years old taking care of your mother. That must have been\nreally frightening.",
        "A: It was. It was very frightening.",
        "Q: Who took care of you once that was over? Did anybody think about this happening?",
        "A: No, as a matter of fact, I remember, when the doctor came and she felt better, and the\ndoctor came and he says \u2014 as I said before, the doctor was a friend. He didn\u2019t come\nbecause we could afford the luxury of a doctor, you know. He came by because he was a\nfriend and he wanted to assist her. So, I say to him, \u201cShe didn\u2019t eat in two days. What\nshould I give her?\u201d Not that we had that much food, but the food was Russian and so we\nhave bread and we have a jam and saccharin, and Ersatz coffee and stuff like that. He\nsays, \u201cShe shouldn\u2019t be eating anything heavy, and I know that you can not cook her soup\nor anything like that. I\u2019m going to see to it that I get for you a little bit of farina, like, grits\nor whatever.\u201d And, he says, \u201cAnd, Ill show you how to cook it, because you cannot\nprepare anything that she won\u2019t be able to eat.\u201d I still remember how I pulled out that\nlittle pot and he told me how much water to put it in and put it on the stove, and he\nmeasured it with a teaspoon or a tablespoon, I don\u2019t remember, and how he taught me\nhow to prepare that tablespoon of farina. When to put it in, \u201cWhen the water comes to a\nboil,\u201d he says, \u201cPut it in. Stir it. Cook it for about two or three minutes until 1t becomes\nthicker in its consistency. Let it cool a little bit, and feed your mother, and give it to her\nthree times a day.\u201d And, then he said to me, \u201cAnd when she feels a little better...\u201d I still\nremember the order of the food that she was supposed to eat. He says, \u201cAnd when she\nfeels a little better, make sure that you get hold of some beets and because if you cook the\nbeets the beet juice is going to be very helpful for her blood circulation with that.\u201d Beets\nare for blood, whether it was circulation or anything, to strengthen her. This is how much\nI remember. It was a responsibility, but 1t was nothing. It wasn\u2019t a burden. It was\nsomething I did with the greatest of love to make sure that Mother survived. Well,\nMother was the best, in my opinion, in the world. There haven\u2019t been too many people\nlike her who have done so much for others, and yet she was the first one to be taken away\nfrom us, and she was the first one to go to Treblinka, by some freak accident. So, what\nam I to tell you? Then, three years later, or a year later, when we were in camp already,\nmy two sisters got sick with Typhus, but by then I was already experienced. Then my\nfather got sick, and then I got sick. So, 1t was \u2014 I was the nurse going from one to the\nother, but the cases, as they were coming along, there was a lot less to work with, and\nthere was no advice from a doctor anymore because the doctor wasn\u2019t there anymore.\nAnd, but somehow we managed, and somehow we survived. So, the ghetto was\nliquidated in October 1942. Up to that point, things were not the best, but things were not\nthe worst, because when you went to work, you received some food at the factory. There\nwas always soup served during, you know, we worked 12 hours. There were two shifts\nfor the Jews. Normally, the factory worked on three shifts for the regular workers. The\nJews were working 12-hour shifts. So, there was always food, a bowl of soup, that was\nserved during the working hours. So, in a way, you know, you didn\u2019t have much to eat in\nthe morning when you left for work, but somehow somewhere along the line, your soup\ncame along and a little coffee and it was okay. It\u2019s, it\u2019s the kind of existence where you\nreally are so limited to what you can do, and what you can say and what you can think,\nand it isn\u2019t like I\u2019m going to rebel or I\u2019m going to strike or anything. You had no choices.\nThere are no choices. All you had to do was just kind of constantly submit to everything\nthat is imposed on you and you have to do and do and do, and try to deal with it in a way\nthat you don\u2019t break down emotionally or physically, because I could see that anybody\nwho couldn\u2019t deal with it didn\u2019t last too long. They didn\u2019t have to be in Auschwitz.\nAuschwitz was the worst experience, but even here. There were two friends of mine who\ncame from Lodz ghetto, twin sisters, beautiful girls. One was a redhead, I mean, there\nwasn\u2019t a person in the world who wouldn\u2019t notice her, you know? She had the wonderful\npersonality. She was friendly and pretty and everything, and the other was very dark \u2014\ndark hair, but bright, well brought up, nice, wonderful two girls. And up until the time\nthey were in ghetto, their parents were with them, and from the ghetto they were\nemployed, and for one reason or another, the people \u2014 their parents \u2014 did not survive.\nThose two girls didn\u2019t last long at all. First of all, they came from most likely a wealthy\nhome and therefore they didn\u2019t know how to take care of themselves. So, outside of being\nhungry and having very little to eat and not having their parents around to care for them,\nthey didn\u2019t even know how to wash their underwear that they were wearing. I mean, all\nyou had was one set. If you\u2019re lucky, you have two, right, for a change, but no matter\nwhat, if you have one or two, we always managed somehow to keep ourselves clean.\nThose two girls, you could see them fade away. There was nothing. They just couldn\u2019t\nmanage. They had each other and they couldn\u2019t help one another because they were both\nhelpless.\nEnd of Tape #3\nTape #4",
        "Q: You spoke a few minutes ago, prior to telling the story of the two sisters who could not\nwithstand what was going on, and you said people had no choices, but in some ways you\nreally describe choices. You chose to have a certain relationship to what was happening,\nor didn\u2019t you? It was that you chose not to be defeated in what was going on, in so far as\none could choose those kinds of things.",
        "A: I wouldn\u2019t call it choices. I don\u2019t think that choices would be the right application in this\nparticular case because you couldn\u2019t predict what is going to happen, not from one day to\nanother. From one morning to the end of the day, you never know, you couldn\u2019t\nanticipate what is going to take place. So, I wouldn\u2019t say that, that choice 1s the right\ndescription of the situation. I feel that you have to have a very strong desire to live, and if\nyou have a strong desire to live, I think that one can manage, under the most adverse\ncondition, to live or try to kind of survive in a way that one doesn\u2019t break down and one\ndoesn\u2019t emotionally. The worst thing was breaking down emotionally. Physically, from\none day to another, we were really losing our strength and it was quite obvious, but no\nmatter what your physical condition was if you were not outright sick, and you did not\ngive in, but you had this feeling that you would overcome the difficulties because you\nwant to survive, then this was, in a way, your strength that gave you hope. Hope was the\nmost important thing because, if you had hope, you didn\u2019t breakdown emotionally. Once\nyou broke down emotionally and you were resigned completely that life is not\nworthwhile living, or you would find yourself in a situation that who needs it anymore to\nsuffer so much. Everybody that one loved is gone and to just remain alone in this world.\nThere were many situations like such situations like this. Some people did not survive\nbecause they didn\u2019t know how to manage. Some people did not survive because they\nwere too aggressive and for this they were punished by being killed or clobbered to death.\nSome people did not survive due to the fact that they were physically so exhausted that\nthey came to the conclusion that, whether they go to work that day and drop dead on the\njob or whether they will not get out of bed, but quote-unquote-unquote, it was always\nthey \u2014 what do you call it? The bunk bed or the berth or whatever that you slept in, it just\ndidn\u2019t make any difference at all. And it was women who were older who had families\nwhose children were taken away from them like in Auschwitz, who didn\u2019t know whether\ntheir husband survived or not, to them life was meaningless. It took a very, very strong\nindividual really to have this very strong desire to live when it came to who had the\nfamily life or already had responsibility to a husband and children. And, it is, I think,\nyoung people like ourselves who \u2014 maybe that was that instinct of a survival, like a\nyoung puppy who Is in a situation that 1s not familiar with and the momma dog 1s not\naround, and they have to somehow either hide or whatever to get out of the situation.\nQuite often I think about it, in such a way, that instinctive in a way animalistic, which is\nmaybe not the right expression. The desire to survive, without logic, without anything,\nbut just that instinct, that feeling that I have to manage, I have to be aware that it 1s a very\ndangerous situation, and somehow I must get out if it. So, this was very important, and\nthen it was very important to have someone who was able to assist you, and there were\npeople who were willing to assist you \u2014 not because they knew you, not because they\nwanted to, it was just that it was \u2014 it just happened. It happened so that you were at the\nright place at the right time, and somebody who was right there near you who was willing\nto help you. And this kind of a situation we found ourselves in Auschwitz. We came in\n1944, in July. By the middle of October, it was a pathetic thing to look at us. We were\nhungry. We were beaten. We didn\u2019t have any clothes. I worked in a detail where they\ntook us out to a river to cut underbrush because it was the beginning of underground\nactivities in Auschwitz and people were escaping, so in order to clear the view for the\nwatchtowers, there was marshland, so they took us out to work there. And I still have my\nshoes on my feet that I came in, which were good shoes, and I remember I left the shoes\n\u2014 I was working in the marshes and I sunk to my feet, and I came out of it with the tops\nof the shoes because the bottom were so rotten already that they got stuck in that mud.\nAnd it was October, and I was strong when I came in, you know. People that were good \u2014\nthey were all good. There were no bad people because we really had to depend on one\nanother so much that nobody had much, but still, if they saw you in that situation that you\nreally needed help, they were trying to assist you. So, I remember coming back in from\nwork and it was very cold, and somebody gave me clogs, wooden clogs, and I couldn\u2019t\nwalk in them. They were rubbing my feet and I walked barefoot, and it was just horrible.\nAnd when we came to the barracks, somebody gave me a regular boot, which was a very\ngood, laced up boot. It was too big for me. It must have been a man\u2019s shoe, but all she\nhad was that one boot so she gave it to me and then somebody else gave me a high heeled\npump, ladies\u2019 shoes. It\u2019s a funny story. It was ridiculous, but if you think in terms of the\nsituation I found myself in. October, which is very, very cold, and you have to stand \u2014 it\u2019s\nan uphill, and you can stand with bare feet because you\u2019ll have pneumonia, plain and\nsimple. So, I was like this, one leg up and one leg down. It was funny. We laughed, but I\nwasn\u2019t cold, and those days were kind of very, very bad. There was an underground\nactivity already. The Nazi supervisors were very aware of something going on in camp,\nand due to the fact that there were special work details where they employed only\nChristian Poles who were political prisoners, they were afraid that by leaving them on\ntheir own, that they would establish a contact with the underground activities, I mean,\nthose who were with the underground, and there\u2019s going to be an uprising. This was the\ntime when the front was nearing, of course, because we were moved to Auschwitz from\nthe ghetto to, at the time when the Russian forces were already close to Warsaw, but the\nfront didn\u2019t move until later on in the fall, and for this reason, you know, we remained in\nAuschwitz. Here, the Nazis were afraid of the underground activities, of the Russian front\napproaching and everything, so they came to the conclusion that they ought to take and\nbreak up the Polish work details \u2014 work units and bring some Jews in for them not to be\nas comfortable and not to be able to do the work that they were afraid of, as far as\nuprising. We were supposed to go to work one morning and the barracks were\nadministered by three people. There was a Block Alteste, and there was her assistant, and\nthere was a Shreiberin, who was a secretary kind of, who was counting the people in the\nmorning when they went to work, and counting the people in the evening, and they were\nall old-timers. Do you know what I mean? Old-timers is that they were brought, for\nexample, the Czech \u2014 the two girls, the Block Alteste and the assistant, was from Slovakia\nand their transport was, I think, the very early transport, because one of them was so\nhorrible. She was so horrible. She was just so full of hate for everything and everyone\nthat she was just so rude and she \u2014 the Nazis didn\u2019t have the Aufsehers, who were\noverseeing the work and who were taking, and the guards were taking us to work did not\nhave to worry about so much about punishing us, because half of the job was done by this\nparticular woman. I mean, she \u2014 on the one hand, you know, I can think of her as\nsuffering so much for two and a half years prior to our arrival or two years, whatever it is,\nand the first group, I think, was of 500 women and very few survived. So, she must have\nlost everybody who dear and near to her, and therefore, you know, she was afflicting all\nher anger and the pain on everybody who was coming, and to be tough and rough kind of\ngave her the security of the job indoors. She didn\u2019t have to go to work, and the story that\nI have to read is kind of describing of what life was like in one day, because I called it\n\u201cOne Ordinary Day in Auschwitz.\u201d So, anyhow why I\u2019m talking about it is because by\nthen this Sonderkommando had uprising, one of the crematoriums was damaged, and the\nNazis came to the conclusion that most of the gas chambers should \u2014 no, most of the\ncrematoriums should be dismantled because there is \u2014 they don\u2019t \u2014 I mean, the front is so\nclose and they didn\u2019t want to leave any evidence. And, this woman who was the secretary\nof the block went with a report to the main offices, because after each counting in the\nmorning and in the evening, she had to report to the headquarters on the amount of the\npeople who was in the barrack because food was allocated on this basis. And, usually we\nwent to work, you know, and we had not seen her. On that particular morning, she\nreturned immediately and she kind of walked over where we were like nine people\nsleeping in my section, in an upper berth, and I was like close to the end, and she pulled\nme and she says, \u201cTake your two sisters and follow me and don\u2019t say a word.\u201d So, I\nmean, she was a Polish girl, and when we came to Auschwitz, she asked us where we are\nfrom, and I told her, and we had, knew some people \u2014 she had some friends who came to\nlive in our town before the war, and they lived in the neighborhood. So, kind of there was\na little bit of a contact right there that we had established. And she says, \u201cDon\u2019t say a\nword. Take your sisters and follow me.\u201d So, I pull my sisters and I say, \u201cLet\u2019s follow.\u201d\nWe follow her and we come to where the main office is and there on that big square are\nwoman, maybe a hundred, well-dressed in good garments, jackets, decent shoes, I mean\nnot \u2014 I mean well-dressed in the sense that they had good clothes on. You know, they had\na warm jacket and a warm skirt or whatever and good shoes on, and here we come in\nshreds, and I come with the high-heeled shoe and a combat boot, what I called it, and\nthere was a German and she says like this, \u201cI cannot be with you. Go join the group of the\nwomen. There is going to be \u2014 they need 20 women or 22 women...\u201d I don\u2019t remember,\nit\u2019s around 20, but 21, 22, it\u2019s not important. \u201c...to work in offices. Remember, whatever\nshe asks you whether you know, you do know,\u201d and she says, \u201cAnd, Renia\u2019s going to\nstay here with me. And, you go with Hania.\u201d I mean, \u201cThe two of you go.\u201d That\u2019s what\nshe said to us. So, we go and we have a dress on. We don\u2019t have any undergarments\nwhatsoever. In Auschwitz, we did not get any undergarments. Whatever entlausung, you\nknow we went through that, how do you call it, entlausung, the process of getting rid of\nthe lice, when they took you to the shower room, and they took off your clothes and\ndumped it in a big vat of disinfectant water and they dried it somewhere, I don\u2019t know\nwhere, and when you came out from the shower the threw at you a garment regardless\nwhether it was something that fits you or doesn\u2019t fit you. You know, we were running\nnude through the whole camp to go through to that shower room, and then of course,\nfortunately, you know, we managed, because we used to look at each other and kind of\nwhoever was taller has exchanged the dress or whatever was thrown at you with a person\nthat could wear it. And so in this respect, the whole group was aware and very\ncooperative; but never undergarments. At the time, when we came in, we had nothing,\noutright nothing. So, I\u2019m in a dress. I can remember a long cotton dress and these shoes,\nand we are standing with my sister. We looked like two set of stepsisters, like Cinderella\nnext to the stepsisters, who were always so dressed up. And, I think to myself, \u201cHow in\nthe world are we going to get a job here?\u201d And, that SS man who came to look for\nworkers walks through the group. He told us to line up, you know, and we lined up and I\nwas standing next to my sister and he\u2019s asking my sister what kind of qualifications she\nhas for an office job and she speaks German very well, and she says that she worked in\nthe office when we were in camp and Father was working in the arbeitsamt, whenever\nthere was no transport and he couldn\u2019t manage to have all the lists for the following\nmorning, one of us always went to assist him so that he could \u2014 you know, he was not a\nyoung man anymore. I mean, he wasn\u2019t an old man, but you know, being alone and so\nforth, it was very difficult. So, we kind of were acquainted with office work. So, my\nsister tells him yes, yes, whatever he\u2019s asking her, whether she can do this and this, and\nshe says yes, yes, and she speaks a very fluent German, and fine. So, he tells her to go\nhere, and he is asking. I just happened to be next to her, but there were other women\nbefore her. So, he puts one on this side, one on this side, one on this side, one on this side.\nThen he says to me, \u201cDo you know how to type on a shreibeshim?\u201d \u2014 on a typewriter. So\nI look at him, and I say, \u201cJch bein eine sehr gute machinenschreiberin.\u201d And, whatever.\nAnd, he looks at me, and he waves to go next to Hania. So, I figured okay, whatever\u2019s\ngoing to happen isn\u2019t going to matter, but I\u2019m next to my sister and everything 1s okay.\nAnd, he goes back and forth, back and forth, back and forth, back and forth, then he looks\nat our group and he starts counting and he says, \u201cGenug.\u201d And he tells everybody go, and\nwe all went, which genug means enough. So, he counted and we were 20 \u2014 I don\u2019t know\n20, we were 20 or 25. Whatever we were, but this was the number because we were to\nreplace 25 Polish political prisoners in that work group that was dealing only with\nproperty that was brought to camp by political prisoners. The political prisoners\u2019\nproperty, whether it was a dress a sweater a hairpin, when they were taken, put in\nAuschwitz concentration camp and given a uniform, every little item they brought with\nthem had to be registered and stored, so in case they were transferred to a different camp,\nthat each and every item had to follow them or, if they died, that their property was\nreturned to the family. So, they had to keep a very close account of the property of the\nwomen political Polish prisoners. While the property of the Jews who were brought to\ncamp, to Auschwitz, was confiscated, and the good things were stored in Kanada, which\nwas this unit known, you know, where they stored the stuff, and selected the good things\nto be sent to the Reich, including all valuables and everything, and the rest of the things\nwere distributed to the prisoners, you know, when they ran out of uniforms. So, we are\nthere and he\u2019s just about to march us off, and I know already but we are qualified for the\njob. Now, the job is not anymore where we have been. The job 1s all together in a\ndifferent area and very close to Kanada and we are being marched out somewhere else,\nand my sister Renia is not with us. And, then I see fellows standing in the back with my\nsister Renia, and the Block Alteste, the woman who was in charge of the block, and they\nkind of push my sister Renia and the Block Alteste comes running with her and she says\nto the man who was selecting the people for work, she says, \u201cPlease take her with you.\nHer two sisters are there, and she can make a very good Lieferant (ph)\u2019 A Lieferant (ph)\ndue to the fact that there were no phones in camp, only the headquarters had phones, any\nmessages that had to be carried between barracks were done by people who were the so-\ncalled runners between the - how do you say that? \u2014 those who, that made it possible for\nthe barracks to communicate with the main office and other departments. But, \u201cShe\u2019s a\nvery good Lieferant (ph),\u201d and he looks at her and he sees the pathetic-looking thing and\nhe looks at us, and he says, \u201cOkay.\u201d And, he pounds and he marches us off. Now, we are\ncoming to the new place to work, and there is no room for us yet because the other\nwomen whom we are replacing are still there. They have not been transported to another\nplace and it is their job to acquaint us with the work that they have been doing. So, as we\nwere entering, the girl who stood guard to the entrance of Kanada, a little girl whose\nname was Fela (ph), she saw the difference between the other women, the way what they\nlooked like, and us, and she knew that this is like, you know, like something non-existent,\nbecause the people who worked in Kanada, they have access to food because the food\nwas brought with the transport. So, it\u2019s not really that \u2014 1t was confiscated. It was taken\nout of the trains. It was brought to Kanada, anyhow. So, they had good clothes and they\nhad \u2014 so, as we were walking by she says, at break, she says, \u201cYou come to me. I\u2019ve got\nto see you.\u201d So, we nodded our heads and we said, \u201cFine. We are going to come.\u201d You\nknow, in a situation like this, when you see that somebody wants to see you, you knew\nthat somebody wants to see you for a different reason, for an important one, let\u2019s put it\nthis way. So, at break, we went to the barracks and by then, she had a whole crew waiting\nfor us. She had good coats, painted with a red stripe, because if you didn\u2019t have a\nuniform, a striped uniform, you had a red stripe painted on the back. So, they took us like\nto a little enclosure. There were four women. I never saw them in my life including that\nlittle girl who stood at the gate. They dressed us with everything, panties and bras and\nsocks and shoes and skirts and jackets, took off our numbers from the tattered clothes and\nput them on the new jacket, because we had to return back to the barracks that same day.\nThere was no room for us to stay here. Well, we worked all day. We got acquainted with\nthe job. It was a job inside, office work, \u201coffice\u201d quote, unquote, but still it was indoors,\nand working indoors made a great deal of a difference, and we went back to the barracks,\nto the original barracks to the group from Starachowice, and when we came in nobody\ncould recognize us, nobody. Because we looked so different. We had all these clothes and\neverything. So, you know what we did? We undressed and we shared our clothes. Mind\nyou, three people \u2014 everybody had something different of a different size. We took\neverything that we had on and gave it \u2014 shared it with the people who were in the\nbarracks because we knew that we are going back the next morning and the girls told us,\n\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid to leave those things to anyone you want to. We\u2019ll have new things for\nyou tomorrow.\u201d They didn\u2019t know that we were going to be back and forth, but they\nknew that for one week, we\u2019ll be moving around because it was a small area, you know,\nit was kind of a camp that was pretty much separated from the rest of the camp, and they\nknew that it would take about a week before the other women who were training us for\nthe job will leave. So, that was such a blessing because within this week, in the morning,\nwe were leaving the barracks in the worst clothes there was, and coming back in the\nevening, and we went through the same routine every day. And, you know, it was just the\nmost wonderful thing. We didn\u2019t help much. The group was, I don\u2019t know how many we\nwere, about 200, and you can do just so much, but somebody has gotten something, you\nknow, that was helpful, and that was the most wonderful thing. There you are. Here is a\nwoman that we don\u2019t know, that was a kind of a, you know, an acquaintance that you run\ninto, and just a conversation with a person that you know some people that she knows or\nthat she was fond of who were from her hometown, and that was all. I mean it was not a\nfriendship of any kind. She was not even willing to show any kind of friendly association\nbecause, in order for her to keep her job, she was a barker is what I call her. She never hit\nanybody like the other one, but she barked. She was yelling and yelling and calling you\nthe worse names in the world, but this is about the extent of her being tough. This was her\ntoughness, and when she had this opportunity, mind you, and to be there and then to go\nand bring the Block Alteste to make sure that Renia\u2019s going to get in with us, a miracle,\nthat\u2019s my mother watching over us, and I\u2019m not kidding, because after the war when I\nreturned back to Poland and I went to see my hometown to find out if there 1s anybody\nleft from the family \u2014 because people were coming, maybe somebody was seeing,\nsomebody had, and there were about twenty Jews who had come back and settled back in\ntheir homes in one area, but the Paliszewski family, with whom my parents were so\nfriendly, with whom we had kind of always a home away from home, insisted that since\nthey didn\u2019t see us for such a long time, that we can stay a whole day with the people, but\nfor the night we should come to them and we should spend the night with them and\nthey\u2019Il give us an opportunity to talk and, one of the women, I had a picture of her with\nme when I went back to Poland, you know, when we went to Treblinka, she went with us.\nThat was in fact a finding mission in 1979. She said to us in 1945 \u2014 I was with my sister\nHania in their home and I sat around and I could see the Christmas tree, the corner where\nthe Christmas tree was and all the presents that they prepared for us. You know, they\ndidn\u2019t have small children, so, you know, that whole fun of the holiday, we were their\nchildren. So, it was kind of coming back, and she says to me, \u201cI want you to remember\nmy children. Two days before the liquidation of the ghetto, your mother was here. She\nbrought with her your Passover silver, and your Passover wine cups, and she said, \u2018I\nknow that I cannot burden you with any property, but if you don\u2019t mind, I would like you\nto hold them. I know that we have almost no chance to survive, but I am willing to give\nmy life with the knowledge that my three girls will survive the war.\u201d And, you know,\nsince what we had in 1945, right after the war, and I feel that all the difficult situations\nthat we went through, in moments where we really felt that 1t\u2019s the end, we reached a\npoint of no return, that it was really my mother who was watching over us. It\u2019s a miracle\nhow three young girls, with such a difference in age between the oldest and the youngest,\ncould hold on and go through the same period, and yet survive. So, I feel that it\u2019s not only\nthat, you know, some people say divine providence. I believe in divine providence, you\nknow? But at the same time, I also feel that these last words that the Paliszewsk1\u2019s who\nwere her friends had heard from her were so true, and the mother went down and she\nbrought me the silver and the wine cups, the Passover wine cups that I still have. This is\nthe only thing I have from home, because everything else that was placed with different\npeople are gone, and thing, you know, there were some things that they had taken that\nwere not such a tremendous responsibility. They didn\u2019t want to take anything of value,\nbecause they figured in case they are compelled to leave their home, they shouldn\u2019t have\nthis obligation to worry about our property. So, the warm sweaters and the coats that we\nleft with them because, once we went to work and we were coming back to the ghetto, we\nmet with Polish people at work, and if we knew people who were willing to take a\nmessage to them, they have seen to it that something was sent to us, even in this slave\nlabor camp in Starachowice, even after the ghetto, you know. Even, they could, whatever\nthey could afford to send us and assist us in any way they were very, very helpful. But\nyou had to have willing people who took the message to them, and trust them so that they\nwould not endanger the safety of the family. So, you had to be very, very careful, and\nthat\u2019s the way it is. But that very night when we were in Starachowice, let me finish this \u2014\nis there were about 20 Jews and five children who survived Auschwitz from my\nhometown, and they were coming back to town, and in the middle of the night a group of\nradical Poles, and there were many of them in this particular region, the NSZ, the most\nradical, not Communist, but fascist group in Starachowice, attacked that community, that\nlittle group of people who were there, and two of those children that survived Auschwitz\nwere killed that night, two adults, I think \u2014 I don\u2019t remember exactly. I know that there is\na record made of the amount of people who were injured, even with the names, I didn\u2019t\ncommend it to my memory, just recollecting. I know that there were five children who\nsurvived Auschwitz and two of them were killed that very night. That was June 1945.\nAnd then they came knocking at the door at the Paliszewski\u2019s house, and they said,\n\u201cOpen the door.\u201d It was like two o\u2019clock in the morning. And they said, \u201cWe know that\nthe Laks sisters are here with you, and we want them.\u201d And, the lady of the house, who\nwas in the other bedroom, and \u2014 because the friends were basically her young daughters,\nshe was a widow by then \u2014 walked over to the door and she said, \u201cHow dare you to\ndisturb my sleep. Yes, they are with me, but as long as they\u2019re under my roof you are not\ngoing to lay your hands on them, and please leave us alone.\u201d You know, they were a very\nrespected family. I mean, they weren\u2019t just anybody. They were a very respected family.\nSo, it was quiet and we didn\u2019t know what happened. We just knew that somebody was\nknocking in the middle night, demanding that we are, so to say, given to for whatever\nreason they wanted us. And, the following morning, one of the young women, before she\nwent to work, went to find out what happened that night, and she came running back. She\nwas like a ghost, as pale as a ghost, and she says, \u201cGirls, please don\u2019t leave the house,\njust stay here. There is something terrible that has happened, and the people who were\nhere looking for you have attacked that small group of Jews.\u201d And, she didn\u2019t have the\nexact number or anything, but \u201cthere are people and children killed, and just stay until the\nsituation clears.\u201d And, we stayed there for the whole day, and in the evening, when she\ncame back from work \u2014 they lived also very close to the railroad station, within walking\ndistance. It wasn\u2019t that far away. She came \u2014 in a small town everything 1s close. So, she\ncame from work and she went straight to the station and she bought tickets for us to go\nback to Lodz because we just came for the day to find out what\u2019s happening, and for the\ntrain, she knew exactly when the train will be coming, and she asked the man who was \u2014\nthe head of Doroszka. You know what the Doroszka 1s? It\u2019s like a horse and buggy that\nyou put the hood up to protect himself from \u2014 like in Central Park they have those\nbuggies \u2014 and she placed us, when we heard the whistle of the train in the distance \u2014 she\ntook us into Doroszka, covered up, took us to the train station was when the train was\nalready standing on the track, put us in the train, and was waiting there until the moment\nthe train started to move, to ascertain that we are safe, and that we can live in safety. And\nthis is how I left Starachowice, and promised myself never to return. It\u2019s again, we are\ntalking about things that we are jumping back and forth, but it\u2019s... I don\u2019t know. I think\nthat talking about the things that are very important at certain particular moments is better\nthen to kind of go in a chronological order that I may forget later on to speak about tt.\nAnd, by the way, that job lasted from the end of October and until the middle of January,\nwhich was two and a half months, and that was two and a half months in an environment\nthat was working under the roof, in the company of very intelligent Polish women, and\nafter the war, I found out that 50 percent were Jews, Jewish woman under assumed\nChristian names, that showed you concern and care and shared with you the packages\nthey were getting from home and created, not only a home environment for you, but a\nkind of an intellectual environment, as well, where after work, because we were a small\ngroup of 50, it must have been 25 women, because we were a small group of 50, we\ndidn\u2019t have to stand and Zahlappel. Everything was right there within this unit, which\nwas separate and apart from anything that was going on in Auschwitz. We were only\nresponsible for clothes and the suitcases and the pocketbooks and everything that was\nbrought by the Polish political prisons. So, in the evening, we used to sit and discuss and\ntalk and sing and kind of create a kind of a lighter situation, and also having a little extra\nfood and not being outdoors working in November and December, when conditions were\nhorrible, outright horrible, or be transported like everybody else to another camp at the\ntime, you know, they were mostly transporting people to different camps, and us they\nkept until the very last moments when the liquidating completely, abandoning Auschwitz.\nSo, in a way those two and a half months gave us self-esteem, brought us back to kind of\na little bit of a normal life. We had a little bit of extra food, and we had this group of\nwomen who were not as... desperate. I mean, they were political prisoners, they suffered.\nThey suffered. They were not treated, you know, a lot better than the Jews, but the mere\nfact that we didn\u2019t have to go with the command and morning count, and we didn\u2019t have\nthe dogs, and we didn\u2019t have the \u2014 no, the SS that led us to work, no \u2014 the soldiers who\nwere watching us, you know, and we didn\u2019t walk in the rain, and we didn\u2019t stand in the\nrain \u2014 that whole combination kind of gave us an opportunity to kind of become human\nagain. Human in a sense that if you regained a little bit of your self-esteem, because you\nwere not beaten, and you were treated like an equal and you were not called those\nhorrible names that sounded so terrible for a 15-year-old person, to be beaten and be\ncalled a whore and stuff like this, that I wouldn\u2019t even have dared to bring it out in the\npresence of my parents, expressions like this, and this is what was, so to say, a daily\nroutine. So, this kind of a thing was really a turning point that prepared us for the death\nmarch and then for all these next six months that were not so good, but on the other hand,\nthey were not so terrible that we gave up hope. So, you know, it\u2019s like a good month and\na bad month, and a good period and a bad period, and if you combine it all together and\nyou have this support, so to say, of someone that loves you and you love them and you\nare aware of the fact that you have to help each other, I think that this is a secret of\nsurvival.",
        "Q: I don\u2019t know how long we have. I have a feeling that maybe we should stop here.",
        "A: That will be fine.",
        "Q: And go back when we meet again. Do you really want me to continue with the camera?",
        "A: It\u2019s fine. Whatever you want. If you feel that it is good to continue and worthwhile.",
        "Q: No, I think it\u2019s important...",
        "A: Pll make myself available.",
        "Q: ...that we continue and start again with the liquidation of the ghetto, especially given the\nstory you\u2019ve told about your sense of your mother and what you learned about what she\nsaid. We need to go back there and know what happened and what that break, which was\nreally significant for all of you, cause that really changed everything.",
        "A: So, you want to do it nght now?",
        "Q: No, no, we won\u2019t do it now. I think that when we meet again, that\u2019s where we\u2019ll begin.\nThank you very much.",
        "A: All right. Thank you.\nEnd of Tape #4\nTape #5",
        "Q: Good morning again, Chris. Welcome back to Washington.",
        "A: Good morning.",
        "Q: What I'd like us to do is start with your \u2014 a few months before the liquidation of the\nghetto. Somebody had escaped from Treblinka and came back. Can you talk about what\nhappened?",
        "A: Yes, of course. That was about in the summer of 1942 when transports to Treblinka were\nbeing sent en masse from Warsaw ghetto. They just started the evacuation of ghettos, and\nI think it was Warsaw that was the first one \u2014 the first transport. It was like, I would say,\nSeptember \u2014 not September, but August 1942, when on one afternoon, we were sitting 1n\nthe backyard with some friends talking, spending some time together, when all of a\nsudden out of the bushes, a young man appeared and he was very disheveled. He was\nunshaven and he was filthy, and he was very, very frightened. And when he saw us, he\nwasn\u2019t quite certain whether he should come out or not, but when he saw us, he somehow\ndared to come out and say, \u201cAmhat\u2019 (ph). Amhat was like a password at the time for\nmaking sure that the people you\u2019re encounter are also Jews. Actually, we used to say not\namhat, but amhut, with a \u201cu\u2019\u2019. I mean like, and of course, we answered immediately\n\u201cAmhut\u2019 to him, and this kind of got him a little relaxed, but he was still, very, very\nnervous and he was just so strange looking. We had never seen anybody in this kind of a\ncondition. We asked him who he was and he started to tell us this story how he came with\nhis parents to Treblinka, how they were brought on the transport to Treblinka, and how\nhis parents were separated from him immediately upon arrival, how he was put to work to\nunload the belongings of the people that were brought to camp, and how he realized that\nthat was the end of the road, so to say, that it was an extermination camp. So, he\nsomehow managed after the work to get under a cattle car and he suspended himself, I\nmean, he went under the cattle car, got a hold of the axis \u2014 whatever \u2014 and when the train\nstarted to roll out, because the trains were bringing in people, unloading and leaving the\ncamp site, going back for more transport, he got himself under the car and held on to the\nchassis and when he realized that the train was already out of the camp compound, that\nhe dropped to the ground. It was already evening, and he remained lying there on the\ntracks for a while to ascertain that nobody was around, that he was not going to be\npursued and he walked to the woods nearby, not knowing exactly where he was and\nwhich direction to take, and he just walked, and he walked mostly at night because during\nthe day he was frightened. He didn\u2019t know really, you know, what kind of a situation he\nmay be confronted with. Therefore, he walked at night which was very difficult for him\nto know exactly where he was going, but it didn\u2019t really matter. All he wanted was to\nescape, and it was, like, on the second day or the third day that he came to us and he was\nvery hungry and very thirsty and he asked for some food. We sat there, you know, we\nwere teenagers, and we watched him, and he himself wasn\u2019t much older. He must have\nbeen seventeen or eighteen years old, and he had that wild look on him, you know. We\nknew something shocking \u2014 he must have gone through something very, very shocking.\nSo, we went home and entered the house, and we told my parents that there 1s a guy there\nwho acts like crazy, and he\u2019s telling us stories that we just don\u2019t believe. So, my parents\ncame out and asked him to come in, and he sat down. They gave him some food to eat\nand then they started a conversation, and once he got into details my parents told us to\nleave. Most likely, they didn\u2019t want us to be aware or know exactly the details that were\ntaking place, you know, in camps like Treblinka. So, I would say that after this encounter\nwe kind of began to realize that something is happening, that inasmuch as living in the\nghetto was so different from the normal life that we led before, and being forced to work\nin factories was also something that we have never planned on doing, especially forced\nlabor. There was another aspect to our lives that was unpredictable that may come into\nthe picture soon, and of course, within a few months which was from August to October,\nour town has gone through the same thing. The Nazis came to liquidate our ghetto in\nStarachowice; that was in October of 1942.",
        "Q: Can I ask you something? Did your parents ask all three of you to leave, all three sisters\nor did Renia stay also?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember, because we were basically... We\u2019re friends. You know, like you live\nin a neighborhood so, it\u2019s summertime and you are confined always to the small\napartment. You like to be outdoors especially in the summertime. You need it and you\nwant to be with your friends. So, we were like a bunch of kids, I don\u2019t know six or seven.\nI don\u2019t know whether both of my sisters were there, one of my sisters was there, but this\nis what happened at the time, and this is how we came to know that there is a camp, an\nextermination camp, at Treblinka where they are gassing Jews.",
        "Q: Do you have any recollection that when your parents asked you to leave the house, you\nhad said to your parents we don\u2019t believe him. You knew something had happened\nbecause of how he was acting, because he was so strange, right? But given that they\nasked you to leave, do you have any recollection of when they asked you, you thought,\n\u201cWell, maybe this is really true\u2019? Did you talk to each other?",
        "A: We kind of sensed something, but you really don\u2019t want to believe it, and it\u2019s maybe, you\nknow, a mature mind can comprehend much better then a young person. And sometimes\nin a lot of cases, even grown ups didn\u2019t want to believe. People sometimes would say,\n\u201cWell, it must have been such a shocking experience for an individual to be separated\nfrom his parents, not knowing where they are or what has happened to them that all of a\nsudden they lose their mind.\u201d So, you can\u2019t really tell. To us, the story was very, very\nstrange. You know, when you believe in humanity and you believe in goodness and you\nare brought in a way that you have to conduct yourself properly and behave in a certain\nway, those things are unbelievable because things like this were never done before, even\nif you grew up in an environment that was anti-Semitic does not mean that you were\nbeing murdered. There hasn\u2019t been such a thing before. So, considering that we were all\ntoo young yet, one on hand it seemed crazy on the other hand, it was very real, because\nthe manner he ate that potato that was given to him \u2014 I mean, we shared with him\nwhatever we had \u2014 that he was gulping it down. You could see how hungry he was.",
        "Q: The day of the liquidation of the ghetto, do you remember what kind of a day it was?\nWas it cold? Was the sun shining?",
        "A: This, too, has been a different experience for me and my older sister than for anybody\nelse because, as I said before, we were working in a factory and that was the brick factory\nthat we were working. Usually, there were two shifts, so it was a twelve hour working\nshift, and that very day, we left for work for the night shift. So, actually what happened 1s\nthat like the day before, we left home, and went to work without knowing that that was\nthe last time that we were together as family, that it was the last time that we had seen our\nmother, and it was the last time that we functioned as a family unit, because the night of \u2014\nwhile we were in the factory, SS groups with collaborators from \u2014 they were uniformed\nLatvian soldiers \u2014 came to liquidate the ghetto. They took all the people out, chased\neverybody out of their homes into the marketplace, and there was a selection. The people\nwho had employment cards were put to one side. People who were without employment\ncards \u2014 children, and elderly and mothers \u2014 they were put to another side, and they were\nbeaten, of course, and those who remained in their homes who refused to leave the house\nwere shot to death either in their beds or at home. So, everybody was out in the\nmarketplace in the middle of the night, and my sister and myself were at work in the\nfactory. So, actually only Renia and both of my parents were there while the action took\nplace. So, the details that I know of what has happened at the time came from my sister\nRenia and from my father. The replacement for the shift on which we were did not arrive\nin the morning to the factory because they were still segregating people. Therefore, we\nhad to remain in the factory for another twelve hours of work. So, we worked that day a\ndouble shift, and we didn\u2019t know what happened. We just couldn\u2019t understand, and in the\nmorning, the factory was like on the ground floor, and on the upper levels were offices,\nand in one of the \u2014 in the office there was a school friend of mine, a Christian, a Pole,\nwho lived not far in the neighborhood and he knew the Jews are working two shifts. He\ndidn\u2019t know who was at work, and he came a little earlier and he came down and he says,\n\u201cSomething horrible happened in town. They are taking away the Jews.\u201d And, he looked\nand when I saw him, I walked over and I said, \u201cTell me what happened.\u201d So, he says,\n\u201cCome up to the window upstairs and you will see it by yourself.\u201d The window was\nfacing a railroad siding from where the cattle cars where standing and where the people\nwere brought from the marketplace, and of course, it was such a shock, when I looked out\nthe window, that I will never forget it because the people were crying, they were beaten,\nthey were chased. You could see mothers, you know, holding their babies. You could see\nmen carrying bundles on their backs, and for that fleeting moment, for that minute or two,\nwhatever, because I didn\u2019t want to jeopardize his job, and he for sure, you know,\nwouldn\u2019t want to anyone to realize that he made it possible for me to come and look out\nthe window. So, for that one moment, all I could see was like a chain of human bodies\nmoving in one direction, you know, beaten and pushed into the cars, and I was trying so\nhard to look and see whether I see a familiar face, I couldn\u2019t see anything. I just couldn\u2019t\nsee, whether it was because I was so shocked, or because I was \u2014 I mean, it was too far of\na distance for me to see, but just a feeling of that mass of people being driven and being\npushed into the cars and listen to the cries and the moaning and it was horrible. I came\nback to work \u2014 you know, we worked the conveyor, like a conveyor where we were\nplacing wet bricks on the conveyor belt and they were sent to the kiln upstairs \u2014 and I\nknew that something has taken place. I only hope that whatever has taken place, that it\nwill bring us back together. That was the morning. We came after work, they never took\nus back to the ghetto. They took us to the camp in Majowka, and there we found Father,\nand we found Renia, and Mother was not around. They just couldn\u2019t find Mother\nanywhere. But Mother was employed in an electric plant, which at the time had it\u2019s own\nfacility, like a little small barracks for the people who worked around there. So, we were\nhoping that, due to the fact that this was her place of employment, that she could have\nbeen taken to the other facility, and it took a whole week to inquire. You know, it wasn\u2019t\nso easy to make contact. It took a whole week to inquire who was sent where, you know,\nwhich camp, because there were three camps. There were the camps Strzelnica and then\nMayjowka, and this was the electric plant, which eventually, you know, they took the\npeople from the electric plant and brought them to one of the two camps. And we found\nout that Mother wasn\u2019t around. And talking to people afterwards, trying to find out what\nhappened to Mother, we were told that she had a friend who was a widow and she was all\nby herself, and she got very hysterical because she had nobody and she was so lost, and\nMother kept her company and she tried to keep her calm, and she told her \u201cDon\u2019t worry,\nI\u2019m with you. I\u2019m with you; I\u2019m going to take care of you.\u201d So, she took care of her and\nthey both went to Treblinka, just to show that she died the way she did, trying to help\nother people. This was 1942. So, she was the first victim in the family, so to say, and I\nhave difficulties to kind of understand why a person who has done so much good for\nothers has been taken away from us, and she was the first victim. We came to the camp.\nOf course, the group was not sent immediately to the camp. We had to go through\ninspection. They had to check what we had on us. Not that we carried a lot to work with\nus, but due to the fact that my parents met that young men at the time, Mother insisted,\nespecially since it was getting a little colder, that we wear three outer layers of clothes\nand good shoes that we have a good coat when we go to work because normally, she\nwouldn\u2019t have even thought about it. So, we came in and, of course, whatever we had, a\nwatch or whatever, a little ring, or whatever \u2014 what does a teenager have? \u2014 it was taken\naway from us, and we remained with the clothes at least we had, some extra clothes to\nwear and we had good shoes on our feet. So, they took away the valuables from us and\nthey placed us in different, different, in the barracks. There was barracks for men and\nthere were barracks for women, and then the following day, they separated the group,\nbecause the people who worked in the munition factories went to the camp at Strzelnica,\nwhich was much closer to the factory, while the rest of us went to Majowka, which was a\nlarger camp, and from there people were sent to many different places of employment,\nwhether they needed in the steel mill, whether they were needed in the brick factory\nwhere I was in the beginning or whether in the electric plant or wherever. So, this is \u2014 we\nwere separated. Father and I had remained in Majowka, and Hania and Renia were sent to\nStrzelnica, and as I mentioned to you that due to the fact that Father was running that\nemployment office in the ghetto, he was put in charge because he was familiar with the\nwork in Majowka, and Hania was assigned the same job in Strzelnica. Whatever Father\nwas doing in Majowka, she was running the office there and the work usually \u2014 I mean,\nthe assignment of the work came from the Jewish management, came from the Judenrat\nwhich was very, very helpful because at least, you know, we had more contact with her,\nand it was easier to maintain the contact between one camp site and the other. So, that\nwas the liquidation of the ghetto. It was such a sad sight. I must have been at the window\nfor a minute or maybe for two, but to just watch that like moving bodies, you know, a\ngroup, a chain, an unending chain, and we were \u2014 I don\u2019t know whether we were five\nthousand Jews, or - usually it was like ten percent of the population in a small town like\nours was Jewish \u2014 and Wierzbnik and Starachowice were two communities, separate\ncommunities until the consolidation. So, Wierzbnik was predominately Jewish, and I\nwould say that there must have been, I don\u2019t know, at least five thousand Jews living in\nthe community. Fortunately, because of the need for employment and the Jews were\nworking free of charge, you know. There was no pay or no compensation whatsoever for\nwork. We were magnificent cheap labor force, that a lot of people were saved from \u2014\nespecially those who were young and able to work, and survived due to the fact that from\n1942 until 1944, until the time when they took us to Auschwitz, that we were working.\nAnd of course, the mere fact that you lived in the same community and that you knew\npeople, Christians and in some cases, Christians who were willing to assist you on their\nvery own, and in some cases, Christians with whom some people left valuables, and they\nwere kind of disposing of the valuables and helping and sending to the people some extra\nfood or some clothes or whatever they needed. So, that was very helpful because those\npeople \u2014 those Jews were brought from large Lodz or from Plotsk or from the other\nplaces, in the beginning to our ghetto, they had nobody to assist them. They had nobody\nto help them. They were total strangers and they depended on the assistance of the Jewish\ncommunity, but once the Jewish community was decimated, they didn\u2019t have anyone to\nturn to.",
        "Q: Can I ask you something?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Because I think people \u2014 I think it would be very interesting for people to understand\nwhat it was like to try and find out what happened to your mother. Do you remember who\ntold you? Did your father tell you? Was your father the one who actually found out? Or\ndid all four of you...?",
        "A: No, Father was \u2014 Father definitely, Father was the one who found out. I mean, I could see\n\u2014I could see how terribly, how he felt, how terribly affected he was by the loss of\nMother, and due to the fact that we weren\u2019t there, you know, sometimes I thought to\nmyself, \u201cIf we only would be there.\u201d Because when you separate men from women, and\nyou go through a selection, I can\u2019t imagine that Renia wasn\u2019t of much help to Mother,\nand she kind of depended on Mother to take care of her, and Mother was taking care of\nher friend, and Father wasn\u2019t even there to know what was happening, and I don\u2019t even\nknow in what way Renia managed to be later on in camp. I don\u2019t know, and she never\ntold me. I don\u2019t even know how this happened. I mean, it isn\u2019t like that Father was\nholding on to her and brought her with him.",
        "Q: Because he wasn\u2019t there?",
        "A: I mean, he was there, but he was on one side of the marketplace with the men, and the\nwomen were on the other side. So, every once in a while when I think about it, I feel that\nmaybe if we were there with Hania, we kind of could have managed to get her with us. I\nthink so. I don\u2019t know whether it was destiny. I don\u2019t know whether it was just meant to\nbe that way.",
        "Q: Did you get very depressed when you heard this? Did you get anguished? Did you...?",
        "A: Of course, we missed her. And every time I think about it, I always see it in one way: that\nI never said goodbye to my mother. Whether I was anguished, I don\u2019t know. We were \u2014\nwe had to get up in the morning and go to work, and when we came back from work, we\nhad \u2014 we just had to have a meal and go to sleep and we were lucky to have a parent, and\nin one way or another, in the beginning, I didn\u2019t give up hope. Somehow in the back of\nmy mind, I was hoping that, no matter what, that Mother is going to somehow appear.\nWe all knew \u2014 we all knew that what is happening when people are taken away from the\nghettos. We all knew, but when 1t comes to someone who is dear and you love dearly,\nyou have hopes that it\u2019s not \u2014 they did not \u2014 this kind of thing could not have happened to\nyour parent or your sibling or whoever. That maybe by some chance they wound up in a\ncamp somewhere and maybe after the war you will be reunited. From what we heard, is\nthat she was put on the train with her friend, and everybody knew that the train went\nstraight to Treblinka. So, inasmuch as, on the one hand, we knew what has happened, on\nthe other hand, in my own mind, I was still hoping that a good person like her deserves to\nlive.",
        "Q: So, by that time, Treblinka meant something like what this person was telling you?",
        "A: By that time, Treblinka remained a reality. I mean, it became a reality. We knew that this\nis the end of the road.",
        "Q: One of the reasons why I ask you that question 1s because, when people in ordinary\ncircumstances in normal life lose somebody, the time of the funeral and the mourning is a\ntime when \u2014 people need a certain kind of time. But 1n traumatic situations and in\nsituations like you were in, there is no time. So, there is no space.",
        "A: There is no time. There is no space. There 1s no assurance that this 1s what happened, and\nthat it happened when it did happen. But one thing was certain: when the war was over\nand the people who survived from the community got together and they kind of gathered\nall the information that was available, everybody knew that the transport from\nStarachowice wound up in Treblinka. Treblinka nowadays 1s a very kind of very\nawesome place where you don\u2019t have any barracks, and you don\u2019t have any\ncrematoriums. It\u2019s just an architectural artistic, architecturally interpretation which\nreceived the prize from the Polish government, and what it consists of is huge rocks and\nlittle rocks that are supposed to represent communities from which the people were\nbrought for extermination, and there is a huge, huge stone \u2014 not a granite stone, but a\nwhatever the stone is, with the carved name on it \u201cStarachowice\u201d and it\u2019s huge. It\u2019s\nalmost up to my shoulder. And every time I go to, to Poland, I make my way to Treblinka\nwith a little flower. That stone is the only thing that I have to remember Mother, just\nremember her and remember the people who, our neighbors and our friends and\neverybody else who lived around and found the same fate as she did. So, you have to\nmake peace and you have to go on living. It\u2019s really tragic because it\u2019s not only my\nmother, but think of all the wonderful people who lived in the community and think of all\nthe little children and they did not survive the war because of the Nazi madness. [pause]\nThen, of course, we had to be confronted with another thing. We went to work every day\njust like before, but the living conditions were different. As long as we were in the ghetto,\nwe had a family life, not as comfortable as before, but still 1n all we were a family unit\nand that was very, very important. Here, we were separated. My two sisters were\nsomewhere else, and I was with my father somewhere else. We maintained our contact,\nwhich was wonderful, and due to the fact that, as I said before, we were in our hometown\nand we knew the people who were involved, who were assigned to different jobs, you\nknow, in administrating the camp, but if anything we needed very badly; they were\nalways cooperating. But, life was all together different. We lived in barracks. The food\nwas prepared in the kitchen. So, we had to have the meal whenever it was available. We\ndidn\u2019t starve, not like in Auschwitz, but we certainly get enough food, but in comparison\nwith Auschwitz, the slave labor camp, was much, much better and you kind of have to\naccept whatever the situation was like.",
        "Q: Where did you eat? In the barracks, or...?",
        "A: No, there was like a mess hall near where the kitchen facility was, and they were\npreparing meals for people as they were coming and leaving for work, you know? So,\nthere was an advantage to that because Father was always waiting for me to return from\nwork so we could have a meal together. Inasmuch there was separate area where the\nbarracks for men were situated and the women were, it\u2019s still, you know, meals we could\nhave together. At the time, the camp, the Nazi commandants who were in charge of the\ncamps, were changing all the time. I don\u2019t know why, whether it was due to the war\neffort, or whether they were sent out to the front, or due to the fact it kind of was tied in\nwith the munition factories, and depending on the job that they had to do, you know, that\nthey were also in charge of the camp. We were guarded by Ukrainians, and the camp,\ninasmuch as it was a labor camp, was also fenced in and we had watchtowers, and the\nUkrainian guards were in the watchtowers. We were led to work always guarded by the\nUkrainians and brought back from the work. If the distance was a very long distance,\nthen they put us on trucks, and they took us to work. Otherwise, they marched us to work.\nSometimes, the camp commandant was a kinder individual. Sometimes, it was a vicious\nindividual. And in 1943, spring of 1943, a typhus epidemic broke out in the camp, and\npeople got very, very sick, and they lost a lot of people. They didn\u2019t have enough people\nto send to the factories. Inasmuch as they were bringing more people from different\nsmaller plants that they were liquidating. And I remember one day, Hania was with Renia\nin Strzelnica, and I was with my father and the epidemic broke out first in Strzelnica, and\nboth of my sisters took sick, but Renia was first. And when the camp commandant, who\nwas at the time, his name was Meir, and there was an ubershtopfuhrer (ph), who was over\nthis camp commandant. His name was Aldoph, came in one day to Strzelnica, and they\ntold everybody to leave the barracks, and whoever remained in the beds, they were\nwalking with machine guns, both of them, and shooting people who did not live the beds\nbecause they were not able to get up. And the rest, they put outside and they told the\npeople to run, and those who couldn\u2019t run were shot either shot on the spot or they were\nput on a truck and taken outside \u2014 outside of the camp to the woods and they were shot\nthere in the woods, and then buried in a mass grave. And Renia was already sick with\nfever and Hania sent her to the laundry room where there was a lot of steam, and Renia\nand another friend of Renia\u2019s who was more or less her age, the two of them were told to\ngo to the laundry room, because there nobody came in to look, and it was kind of steamy\nand hot and all that, and two days later, they told me to go over to Strzelnica because \u2014\nafter they took out the dead people, and they cleaned up the barracks, and I was told to go\nand take over the office in Strzelnica. Hania was sick and Renia was sick. So, I took care\nof the office and I took care of them. And it wasn\u2019t easy. It was not easy, but with God\u2019s\nhelp, they pulled through.",
        "Q: Can you give us some details what you had to do?",
        "A: Well...",
        "Q: Did you feed them?",
        "A: There wasn\u2019t that much food really, but it\u2019s water and I had the experience from taking\ncare of my mother before. So, in a way, I was familiar with the routine what to do. I think\nFather got in touch with the Paliszewskis, and they send out some medication, and so this\nhelped quite a bit. So, they got on their feet, and no sooner Hania returned back to work,\nand everything was well, I came back to Majowka, and my father took sick. So, it\u2019s from\none situation into the next. So, I took care of my father and, because he was working in\nthe office, so his quarters, his living quarters, were with the head of the administration of\nthe camp and the barber in the camp, and my father and the man who was in charge of the\nkitchen, I think, there were four or five beds in that smaller room. So, if you was in the\nbarracks, I wouldn\u2019t have been allowed to go into a regular barracks, but due to the fact\nthat he shared this small living space with other people, they wanted to keep them apart\nfrom the rest of the camp to protect them from diseases that otherwise you were\nsusceptible when you lived with a lot of people together. So, I took care of him, and there\nwas still medication left over, and that was good. And he pulled through, and I was so\npleased when the crisis was over because I was more worried about him than about my\nsisters. And I don\u2019t have to tell you that I was the last one, right?, to get sick. I must have\nbeen already like into the fourth day of my typhus fever when Father returned to work.\nAnd I slept \u2014 we had a women\u2019s barrack, and I had a friend who was also a neighbor, and\nshe was like ten or fifteen years older, and she was a very meticulous person, and she\nalways told me, \u201cI want you to be right next to me. I don\u2019t want \u2014 I don\u2019t want you to\nhave a straw sick (ph) and I don\u2019t because the bed bugs, and their lice and everything 1s\nsitting in them. You are going to be sleeping on bare boards, just like I am, so we don\u2019t\ninvite any problems or any diseases and this will keep out \u2014 this way we\u2019ll keep ourselves\nclean.\u2019 Her name was Fania Hershtein (ph), and she was really wonderful to me because\nshe kind of taught me how to survive under such circumstances, and so we had the corner\nbed on the upper level. But people were going to work, so there was not all the time the\nsame person around you, and this was the only place that you could stay. They had an\ninfirmary, but who wanted to go to the infirmary. You knew that once you are going to\ngo to the infirmary, you'll never come out, whether it was in our camp, the slave labor\ncamp, or in Auschwitz. So, I was there in that corner on that bed, and I remember the last\ntwo days of my sickness. I had a terrible throbbing in my head, and the pain was right\nhere and I felt it in my temples, and I thought that my whole head is going to just break\nopen from that pain. I was aware of what was happening because I remember what was\nbeing done to me. On the other side of the space where we slept were two sisters and they\nwere from a village not too far away, and they were working on a different shift that\nFania was working, and because I was crying that my head hurt so badly, one of the\nsisters was holding my \u2014 put her hands on my temples and was kind of pressing against\nmy temples, holding it tight, and this seemed to be relieving that throbbing, that terrible\npain, and I remember when she did it and I felt so comfortable, and that I felt so much\nbetter. And then I do not remember anything at all until the next day when, all of a\nsudden, I felt that somebody came into the barracks and pulled me out from that bed,\nfrom that spot where I slept, and put me \u2014 you see, I was like in the corner and facing the\nentrance to the barracks was a window, and there was also a bed down there. Somebody\npulled me out from the top, because I heard yelling, \u201cEverybody out of the barracks!\u201d and\nI just wasn\u2019t in a position to get out bed. I figured whatever\u2019s going to happen most likely\nwill happen, I figured. I didn\u2019t figure \u2014 I don\u2019t remember, but I remember that I did not\nleave the barracks, and somebody pulled me out and placed me somewhere else, and then\nI felt like straw sticks (ph) were being thrown on top of me. You know, it was like that\nsack filled with straw, and then I heard this German yelling, \u201cdus, aus!\u2019\u2019 That means get\nup, get out. And, then they came in most likely with bayonets and the rifles because I\ncould hear above me that poking in the spaces to make sure that nobody is around, and\nthen I could hear some poking in front of me, around me, but I didn\u2019t \u2014 nobody hit me\nand nobody hurt me. And, when the day was over, the following day, and I felt better and\nI was aware of what \u2014 I was told of what took place, that it\u2019s the same thing as in\nStrzelnica, that people were shot, those who couldn\u2019t run fast enough, and were taken\naway to be shot in the woods. I just couldn\u2019t figure out what happened. About eight years\nago, a guy from Israel came for a visit to Vineland, and he was in charge of a federation\nproject. It was a sister city of Vineland that we were supporting in Israel, and his children\nwere also very involved in the rehabilitation of the community. So, he was brought to\nVineland to speak about what was accomplished with the money that Vineland\ncommunity was sending to Israel, and he came with the chairman of the campaign here to\nus because, once he knew that it was Vineland and I live in Vineland, he says, \u201cI\nremember Rozka Laks. I would like to see her.\u201d So, you know, when they discussed that\nwhole idea in Israel, so he was promised that when he comes to Vineland, he\u2019s going to\nsee me. We were sitting at the table. I had served coffee and cake, and his name is\nPenhurst Hoffnitz (ph). Unfortunately, he passed away three years ago. And he turns to\nme and he says like this, \u201cDo you remember,\u201d he says, \u201cduring that typhus period in the\ncamp when they came to Majowka and they told everybody to leave the barracks and you\nwere So sick?\u201d he says. \u201cI came to look for my sister, and I saw you, and I pulled you off\nthat bed and I placed you on the lower bed, hoping that you will be much safer in front of\nthe window than somewhere in the corner hiding.\u201d Now, this revelation was something. I\nmean, in front of Miles and in front of the local chairman of the JA Campaign. It was\nsuch an unbelievable story. I knew that somebody had done something for me, but I\nnever knew who the person was, and it was Penhurst, and I didn\u2019t know about it until he\ncame to the United States. So, those are situations beyond one\u2019s control, without even\nknowing why they happen, how they happen, and in what circumstances they are. I don\u2019t\nknow, I have many interpretations when I think about it. When I think about Mother and\nher dedication and work for Israel, and this being connected with federation and Israel, I\njust don\u2019t know. I really don\u2019t want to get that mystical. But, I'll never forget it. I mean\nthis 1s such an eye-opener. So many people used to ask me, you know, after the war,\nmany people asked me, \u201cSo, who was the person who did it?\u201d I can\u2019t remember, but\nsomebody did it, and it was Penhurst, and you know, it just came out so naturally. He\nsays, \u201cDo you remember?\u201d So, when people say, \u201cHow did you survive?\u201d Now, how do\nyou explain what survival meant? There are no words to describe, I mean, why and how.\nAnd in what way, whether it was up to a total stranger or to a friend. When I think about\nit, | always feel that there must have been like an angel, a guardian angel watching over\nus that kept us together all three sisters throughout. I mentioned last time about Fela \u2014\nFela Berlant (ph), who made it possible for us to be transferred from Auschwitz to better\nworking conditions. Now, Fela Berlant was a Jewish girl from home, and she didn\u2019t\nreally know us from Adam before, and it just happened so that she made it possible to\ntake us from the worst conditions where we were almost, so to say, reaching a point of\ntotal starvation and give us \u2014 place us \u2014 in a situation for the next three months that made\nus feel like human beings all over again, that gave us self esteem all over again, gave us\nthe opportunity to kind of go on with what was meant to become \u2014 with the things that we\nwere confronted with in the following months, and so it\u2019s destiny, maybe, or for sure.\nEnd of Tape #5\nTape #6",
        "Q: Chris, you were in some ways alone with your father. I mean, there were other people\naround with whom you were friends, but you indicated that your relationship with your\nfather changed somewhat in the context of that camp, that in some way you got closer to\nhim then you had before. Can you describe that relationship with how you understand\nwhat happened between you?",
        "A: Well, Father was, so to say, the head of the family like in most European homes, and he\nwas a disciplinarian. He was a very meticulous individual \u2014 everything had to be just\nperfect with him. He didn\u2019t spend much time with us when we were younger. So,\nbasically, I only thought of him as a parental figurehead, you know, that is a parent. That\nwe have certain responsibility as children, and he has responsibilities of a father. So, the\ntime we spent together \u2014 I mean, the time that we experienced as children, speaking of\nparents were more so with my mother than with Dad. Father was away a lot from home,\nand when he came home he was busy also preparing the work that he was doing. And\nalso, we were much too young for him to really be involved with us. When we got a little\nolder, I said he was in the free time that he had with us, we were singing and we were\nharmonizing and we were discussing things, you know, because we were a little older, he\nalways wanted to know what we are reading and he was kind of interested more so in our\ndevelopment as people rather than to give us guidance. It\u2019s Mother who did the job. And,\nit was during the job when we were together especially in Majowka where I was with\nhim, that I could see him as a person, as a person who has the patience and who does care\nand who was loving, and who was concerned with our well-being and on occasion he\nmentioned Mother, I remember. But I\u2019m sure that it must have been very painful for him\nto speak about it. I used to always say to him that we\u2019ll find Mother, Dad, don\u2019t worry.\nWe\u2019 ll find her somewhere. She must be somewhere. So, I don\u2019t know whether I believed\nin it or whether it was just that hope, but this could have kind of encouraged him to on\noccasion speak about it. He was very, very busy because he had a very responsible job.\nPeople were dying, and people were sick, and some people were shot, and he had to\nprovide the work force every morning, regardless of how many people were available. It\nwas his responsibility. So, it\u2019s not like under normal circumstances where you get up in\nthe morning and there you go out and the people were waiting to go to work. Every once\nin awhile there were five missing, ten missing and he had to find them, you know? And\nthen, of course, he had to discuss those things with the administration of the camp, the\nJewish administration of the camp, and they in turn discussed it most likely with the Nazi\nauthorities and when there was a shortage of people, people were being brought from\nother camps to Starachowice, to Majowka or Strzelnica. When the transports came, and a\nfew hundred people at a time, and he had to get everything ready for the following\nmorning because there was really, there were a few hundred people. There was really a\nshortage in manpower that I used to be with him in the office until very late to make sure\nthat he concluded his work, because cross-indexing the files and putting everything in\nplace and who arrived and from where and who was gone and, you know, it wasn\u2019t easy\nfor just one person to do it. So, in addition to the work that I have been doing, I have been\nalso helping him to the extent that I could. So, I had this comfort of being around him and\nto really get to know him. He was just a wonderful person, and because I kind of was\noptimistic about Mother being somewhere in life, that we\u2019ll someday be reunited, I guess\nmaybe it was a comfort not only for me, but for him as well. We didn\u2019t have much time\nfor fun or anything like that, but the moments that we had together were very, very\nimportant. You also mentioned something about culture or spending culturally the time in\ncamp. Another kind of a semi-private facility was of the dentist, where he had his\nequipment that he brought from the ghetto \u2014 actually from his office from before the war\n\u2014 and all he had really was that drill that was operated with a pedal; it wasn\u2019t electric.\nAnd a chair, of course, and he didn\u2019t fill cavities, but if you had a toothache, he pulled the\ntooth out and that was it. So, he had this office in one barracks, a separate area. I think it\nwas not far from the other barracks where my father was. And next to it, he had his living\nquarters. So, in the evening on occasion, when we felt the need for some kind of a\ncultural thing, that was the best place to meet. So, we used to there to his office, and he\nhad a friend, a very lovely lady. No, she was his wife! Right, Leona was his wife. And we\nused to get together and there were people who were singing, and there were people who\nwere reciting poetry. So, on occasion we used to have like an evening of this nature.\nThere was a fellow, I don\u2019t know where he was from, but he was \u2014 whether he had a\nsinging voice or not, I don\u2019t know, but he was whistling \u201cZigeunerweisen\u2019, not singing \u2014\nbut to a point that every note was perfect, just from the whistling. The whole thing from\nbeginning to end, and that was the biggest treat of all because the music you are familiar\nwith \u201cZigeunerweisen\u2019\u2019? It\u2019s a very sentimental song. \u201cZigeunerweisen\u201d means gypsy\nairs, so actually there is a nostalgia for the freedom of being out in the open, you know,\nthe life of gypsies. So, there is this beautiful music, there is the longing for the open\nspaces, and it was to me \u2014 it was just like putting myself into a dream world without\ndreaming of something beautiful. There was no future whatsoever. If we could not dream,\nor if we could not think of pleasant things, we would not have survived. Some people\nwere thinking forever about a good meal. Some people had different things on their mind.\nMost people were thinking about the family they lost, and still to be able not to give up\nhope and to dream was one of the important aspects of survival. So, those evenings were\nvery, very important. We couldn\u2019t do them too often. We had to be very comfortable with\nourselves and knowing that whoever was in charge, the commandant, whether he was a\nUkrainian \u2014 in most cases a Ukrainian \u2014 or the commandant in charge of the camp\nguards, I mean, that even if he were to come in, that he would not get angry and disperse,\nmake sure that we are punished in one way or another. So, some of them came in and\nthey just sat around and listened.",
        "Q: How many would get into the office? Was it a big office?",
        "A: I would say twenty, thirty people.",
        "Q: And, it was men and women. I mean, people came from the men\u2019s barracks.",
        "A: Right. Right.",
        "Q: For people who don\u2019t know the gypsy air, \u201cZigeunerweisen\u2019\u2019, could you just sing the first\ncouple of bars? You don\u2019t have to whistle it.",
        "A: Well, it goes like this. [Sings on \u2018la\u2019.] And so on and so on. I mean, I just love it. It\u2019s one\nof my favorite songs.",
        "Q: But you haven\u2019t learned to whistle it yet.",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t.",
        "Q: Do you remember, when you were sleeping, did you have bad dreams in Majowka?",
        "A: I have bad dreams now. I don\u2019t remember, but I have the bad dreams now.",
        "Q: You have bad dreams now about?",
        "A: I have bad dreams now a lot of times. I wake up and I scream \u201cMomma\u201d. I mean, that\u2019s\nthe first thing. I usually wake up, I sit up in the bed, and I scream \u201cMomma,\u201d but it takes\nme so much to bring it out that I must be going through tortures before I bring it out.\nOnce I bring it out, then I\u2019m awake. I dream about running away from dangerous\nsituations. I feel I\u2019m being chased by the Nazis. But for one strange reason, I\u2019m always\nrunning with my two little children, with Jeanette and David as little children in my arms.\nI can\u2019t interpret it in any way as feeling that I have to protect my children as a parent\nfrom a dangerous situation, but basically it was my fears of the Nazis that my children\ndid not have to be involved. It\u2019s maybe because, knowing that the responsibility of a\nparent is to guard your own children, so this is why I\u2019m always running. Quite often, you\nknow, when people in the beginning used to ask me how come I don\u2019t have any more\nchildren, in a joking way I used to say, \u201cBecause I only have two arms.\u201d If I had a few\nmore arms, maybe I would have more children, but for running away from difficult\nsituations when I am threatened with being in camp or being \u2014 that Nazis are always after\nme, I\u2019m running with my kids, two little kids.",
        "Q: If you don\u2019t remember dreams, were you always tired in Majowka? Did you feel as if you\ngot rest?",
        "A: No. You don\u2019t feel tired when you\u2019re in situations like that. You are driven. You are\ndriven because you are driven because \u2014 actually, because you are driven physically by\nwhoever supervisors the work because you have to make sure that everything 1s done on\ntime. If you fall behind, you either punished or there is another whatever outcome of the\nsituation \u2014 in most cases punishment or beating or whatever. And when you are young, I\nthink that you can manage a lot easier with difficult situations than when you are older. I\ncould see that women who were five or ten years older, no more, let\u2019s say we were fifteen\nor sixteen, they were twenty or twenty-five and they were already married or had a\nfamily, and the family was taken away from them, that they did not have that drive to\nsurvive. Especially when they were alone, if they didn\u2019t know what happened to the rest\nof the family. For them, life was very, very difficult, very difficult, and the working\nconditions were very bad. People used to work in front of machines in heat that was\nburning through their garments. We couldn\u2019t get other things to wear. Food wasn\u2019t\nadequate. Bed bugs were all over. They were falling off the ceiling in the middle of the\nnight with like parachutes. Lice were on your body and in your clothes, in the seams of\nyour clothes \u2014 no matter how hard you tried to maintain a certain degree of hygiene, you\ncouldn\u2019t manage. So, you tried your very best. We had like long troughs with running\nwater in the barracks and outside of the barracks. So, during the summertime, we used to\nwash ourselves outdoors because it was so much better, but in the wintertime we used to\nbring the \u2014 I don\u2019t think that we had the running troughs in the barracks, but we had a pan\nof water and we used to wash ourselves and on occasion if anybody had contact with the\noutside, because when went to work in the factory, you met with the Christian population\nof the town, and there were people who maybe weren\u2019t willing to give you outright\nsomething as a gift, but they were willing to take a message to someone who was willing\nto help you and by getting something in return they would bring it to you to the factory.\nAnd some people even if they didn\u2019t know you at all, but they felt that if it can help you\nthat they were willing to do it as well. So, there were all kinds of different situations. So,\non occasion you had a piece of soap and so you could launder your undergarments and\nkeep yourself clean that way. What we used to do 1s when we worked on the night shift in\nthe summertime, we used to sleep outdoors instead of in the barracks during the day\nbecause \u2014 in the summertime only, not in the winter, of course, it was cold. But, we came\nback from work in the morning. So, we took a blanket or whatever was there on the bed\nand spread it out outdoors on the grass, right under the fence and we slept outdoors. So, at\nleast we didn\u2019t have to cope with the bedbugs. It was better sleep and we got some\nsunshine on our bodies, got a suntan free of charge.",
        "Q: Did it smell?",
        "A: Smell what?",
        "Q: The people the barracks because people could not wash very much. Was that something\ndistinctive that you remember?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Noise in the barracks?",
        "A: No. We had to be very quiet because once you entered the barracks, everybody was tired.\nEverybody had to sleep after a day\u2019s work. I mean, I used to go to sleep on occasion and\nif my father needed me I was always ready.",
        "Q: Besides this woman Fenia \u2014 Fania, rather, who was helpful to you, since you have contact\nwith your two sisters, did you see them?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t.",
        "A: Not too often.",
        "Q: But you were able to see them?",
        "A: Not too often.",
        "Q: And you were separated from them for a year, two years?",
        "A: For about a year, and then they \u2014 the situation was constantly changing depending on\nwhere they needed the labor force. So eventually, they eliminated completely the electric\nplant. They eliminated completely the brick factory, and they were concentrating mainly\non the ammunition aspect of it, because the main production was the manufacture of\nshells for \u2014 anti-aircraft shells and, you know, the very large shells. So, the men worked\nwith the big shells, and the women, you know, they had to be cut \u2014 I don\u2019t know how to\nsay it in English \u2014 but they were placed like in a machine that was sized to the millimeter\nand there was like \u2014 it was turning the metal shell for the exact size to file it down to\nperfection, and this is was what women were doing. Also, women were working on the\npremises in camp, you know, cleaning the barracks, taking care of the laundry \u2014 not\npersonal laundry, but whatever, you know, the kitchen stuff and all that, and for example,\nlater on, when I stopped going to the factory, to the brick factory, and I was helping\nFather quite often, he used to send me to work wherever there was a shortage of people. I\nmean, I was the standby \u2014 wherever another person was needed and he didn\u2019t have it. So,\nthis is how I was filling in, and because of that I had a very nice, very pleasant experience\none time. It was like maybe two weeks before they send us to Auschwitz, an order came\nfrom the office \u2014 from the factory main office \u2014 that they needed someone who knows\nhow to type. Father didn\u2019t have a typist on hand to send to the factory. So, he says to me,\n\u201cT would like you to go because it\u2019s for a day until the find someone. They need a typist\nfor tomorrow.\u201d So, he says, \u201cWhatever you do will be all right. I have to send a person.\u201d\nSo, I go with the group in the morning to work and they tell me where to go, and I come\nin and I enter this room and it has like in a classroom, small desks, and in front there is\nlike a glassed in area and there 1s this head of the office. I don\u2019t know who he was, I\nnever saw him in my life, in uniform you know \u2014 a Nazi \u2014 and I come in and I\u2019m very\nstrange and I don\u2019t know where to go, and the guard who brought me in is taking me to\nthe front right in front of the glassed in office, and there\u2019s this huge, huge type machine,\nand with paper inserted in it and all that, and as I walk, I can hear like people call my\nname, and I turn here, there is a friend from school, there is a friend from school. I just\ndidn\u2019t know whether it was real or not, and I come to that big typewriter and the German\ncomes out and he says to me do I know how to type, and I tell him yes, I do. And, he tells\nme that I have to prepare all this for today. So, I sat down, and fortunately he wasn\u2019t there\nfor too long, you know, he just came to organize the work and make sure that everybody\nis at their desks, and I worked. I don\u2019t know how good I was or how bad I was. It was\nonly for one day, so I never returned. But during a break, those two guys with whom I\nwas in high school came running to me and they threw me up in the air. I mean, from\nhappiness, they just picked me up and threw me like a ball, and they said, \u201cYou are alive.\nHow wonderful to see you!\u201d Now, you will ask me the names of those guys. There isn\u2019t a\nsingle name I remember. I only remember that in the very back, at the last desk in that\nroom, was my professor who taught me Latin. I couldn\u2019t stand his guts, and I don\u2019t think\nhe liked me either, and he wanted to fail me because I didn\u2019t like him. He was teaching\nhistory for one year and then he was teaching Latin. And every professor in school liked\nme a lot and they saw a potential in me, and he always looked for the negative, and he\nalways said that I am not a sincere student. And everybody else... None of the professors\nwhere really as vindictive when it came to an exam as he was. I remember when \u2014 every\nonce in a while he\u2019d ask questions, especially vocabulary, new words \u2014 so, when I got up,\nhe used to keep people for two minutes, for three minutes. He used to keep me sometimes\nfor fifteen minutes. He kept me as long as I couldn\u2019t give him an answer. I used to come\nhome and cry and Mother would say, \u201cLook, the only way to overcome this is for you to\nbe very, very prepared, not just prepared. There is nothing because if he made up his\nmind that he\u2019s going to fail you, you better be prepared for it.\u201d His name was Kaifash\n(ph), this I remember, his name I\u2019ll remember forever, and he was sitting there in the\nback, and I hadn\u2019t given him the courtesy to even say hello or look at him. Well, he was\njust awful. Even the director of the Gymnasium liked me a lot and he was so helpful in\ngetting me tutoring jobs and everything, and everybody believed in me. Just this one he\nwanted to fail me. So, I don\u2019t want to say he was anti-Semite maybe he had a different \u2014\nwhatever. Anyhow, he was the one that I wasn\u2019t even excited to see, but with the other\ntwo fellows, it was just so wonderful. And of course after that day, I never came back to\nthis particular place of employment because most likely it was only a temporary kind of a\nneed for whatever it was for the job, and a week later the camp was closed completely.\nThere was a breakout from the camp at night. People tried to escape because, once they\nclosed the camp, we knew that we are not going to be going to work anymore. So, young\npeople cut through the fence and cut the fence and tried to get it out, and in a very short\nwhile the watchtowers noticed it, and they threw all the reflectors in that direction and\nthey were shooting and a lot of people were killed, a lot of people escaped, but we lived\nin a very wooded area where the reactionary Polish partisan groups were operating, and\nJewish escapees had hardly a chance to survive, and those who were caught not only\nwere they pursued by the Nazis and the Ukrainian guards, but the Poles hardly gave a\nsympathetic ear to the place of the Jews and they were sending them away if they did not\nturn them over to the Nazis, so a lot of people lost their lives this way. Quite a number\nsurvived. Among them was my future brother-in-law, Hania\u2019s husband, who was able to\nmake it and he joined the partisan group and he survived the war.",
        "Q: That\u2019s Victor, right?",
        "A: No, Victor is my other one.",
        "Q: That\u2019s right, I reversed them. So, they \u2014 did they know each other in the camp?",
        "A: They were from the same town.",
        "Q: Was that an organized breakout?",
        "A: No. It just, of course, people knew. If\u2014 As I mentioned to you before, we lived in the\nsame community. So, there were contacts to be made, whether contacts for extra food, or\ncontacts for a garment, for a coat or a pair of shoes, or whatever. There were also contact\nwith underground activities, and that Zydowska Organizacja Bojowa, JOB, what they\ncalled it, the Jewish Fighting Organization, was operating at the time after the uprising of\nthe Warsaw ghetto because this was already the end of 1943. So, they were reaching out\nto different camps to let the people know what is happening and not to give in and if you\nhave any way of survival, I mean, any way of escaping from camp, that this is something\nthat you should do, and there\u2019s no doubt in my mind that there were people who knew\nwhat was going on because even the group from Krakow that I knew \u2014 Vushka\nLiebeskind (ph) and her husband was one of those people that were involved with the\nunderground activities \u2014 and their main job was sending out messenger to still existing\nJewish communities, whether it was in camps or in forced labor camps or even in\nAuschwitz, they were trying to make contact with those people and tell them to try to\nescape because this is the only way, and they were very instrumental in even sending\nfalse documents if you provided for them a photograph, they send a document for you. I\nremember, when we were asked to send photographs to \u2014 I mean, to make sure that we\nhave photographs for documents, and I remember somehow I managed for all of us to\nhave photographs taken and I had given it to somebody, but it was such a short period\nfrom the time when there was the breakout at camp and two weeks later, when they put\nus on the train to take us to Auschwitz, that we never received the documents. When I\nthink back about it, I\u2019m not so sure if we would have really tried to escape. Knowing that\nFather is somewhere else, that he was not with us \u2014 if it was just the three of us, maybe it\nwould have been a different situation, although for one person it was a lot easier than for\nthree \u2014 but having Father in addition to it who, always being male was always away, a\ndistance away, sometimes a greater distance, and sometimes a very short distance, but\nnever together, that this would have been a good decision. And in July of 1944, they took\nus to Auschwitz because by then the Russian troops were already on the other side of the\nVistula River and, of course, it was... by then they were liquidating most of the camps\nthat were still in existence. Majdanek was already liberated, and the world I\u2019m sure\nbecame aware of the atrocities that were committed in camps, and we were never told\nthat we were going to Auschwitz, we just were loaded on trains and to an unknown\ndestination.",
        "Q: When your sisters came back, when Hania and Renta came back, were you living in the\nsame barrack, the three of you?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: So, you were all put on a train. Were the men and women separated at that point? Your\nfather is in another part of the train?",
        "A: Yes. Father is in one with the men, and we are with the women.",
        "Q: And your father is about how old at this point, because you are what? Sixteen?\nSeventeen\u2019?",
        "A: No, close to eighteen by then. So, Father is, I think, Father was born in 1892? They were\nmarried \u2014 he was an adult during the Second \u2014 First World War. So, I imagine\nsomewhere around there.",
        "Q: So, at this point, did you ...",
        "A: He could have been what, forty-five, fifty.",
        "Q: Well, that\u2019s almost fifty.",
        "A: Fifty. Right. Fifty. Something like that, right.",
        "Q: Chris, underneath what you were experiencing \u2014 you know really terrible things are\nhappening \u2014 do you have any idea that there are other extermination camps, that people\nare being killed. You know in certain circumstances they get killed indiscriminately, in\nthe hospital if they\u2019re doing a selection or liquidating, but do you have any idea in your\nhead, or did you put that out?",
        "A: No, it\u2019s not that we put it out. We knew that there is no way out for us anymore. And no\nmatter where we were, whether we were in this camp or whether we were to be taken to\nanother camp \u2014 because up to this point for whenever we were \u2014 when we were in\nStarachowice, whenever a group was brought from a different camp to us, they were to\ndo exactly what we did, so we thought that this was the way, that if we are transferred to\nanother camp, we will be taken out of the familiar environment where we had still some\nhelp from the outside, to a totally strange environment, that things will definitely get\nworse, but it will be again a slave labor camp. We did not know yet at this point that\npeople who are working are exterminated. We only knew that people \u2014 those who were\ntaken to Treblinka or those who were taken to Belzec \u2014 that those people were\nexterminated.",
        "Q: You knew that?",
        "A: Well, we knew from that man who came in 1942.",
        "Q: Did you also have an idea where the Russians were? You mentioned a couple of minutes\nago that...",
        "A: We knew where the Russians were because there was an uprising in Warsaw, the Polish\nuprising, not the uprising in the ghetto, but the Polish population. They were hoping that\nthe Russians are going to cross the river. And when we were brought to Auschwitz in\nJuly 1944, within three weeks there were a lot of Christian Poles who were brought from\nWarsaw to Auschwitz, and as a matter of fact, that was the first time when in there were a\nlot of Christian Poles in Birkenau, because up until that time they were mostly political\nprisoners, and they were placed, the men in particular, in Auschwitz. They were\ninterrogated in Auschwitz. They were killed in Auschwitz. They worked in Auschwitz.\nOnly women were in separate part of Birkenau of which I had mentioned before that we\nworked for a brief period, for three months. But a large group of Polish Christian women\nfrom the ghetto \u2014 not ghetto, but the Warsaw uprising was brought to Birkenau at the\ntime, which was August, end of August into September, and from them, we found out\nwhat was happening.",
        "Q: So, there was the uprising in the camp and clearly some kind of liquidation, and a group\nof you \u2014 about how many people were in Majowka that you can remember?",
        "A: I couldn\u2019t tell towards the end. I don\u2019t really \u2014 I would say that there was either one\ncarload of women or two maybe twice as many for men.",
        "Q: So, there were more men in the camp?",
        "A: Of course, there was always more men than women in camp.",
        "Q: A significant difference, do you think?",
        "A: No. I would say maybe women represented one-half, not one half of total, but let\u2019s say if\nwe were to categorize a group as a whole, I would say, like, one-third and two-thirds, that\nkind of thing.",
        "Q: How do you remember that day that you were put on the train to go to Auschwitz? You\ndon\u2019t know where you\u2019re going.",
        "A: Well, I remember it in so many different ways. I remember \u2014 I mean, I don\u2019t know what\nhappened to other people, but I remember very well what happened to me. We were not\nallowed to \u2014 I mean, we\u2019re closed up and the people who tried to escape were either \u2014\nsome of them were killed on one side of the fence, some were killed on the other side of\nthe fence, some were killed in the woods. And the rest of us had remained in camp, and\nthere was a woman whose husband worked in the infirmary, and she was with us, and\nthey were from Plotzk or from another town. There was a husband and a wife, and he was\neither a doctor \u2014 he had some knowledge of medicine because he was working in the\ninfirmary. So, I really don\u2019t know if he was a doctor or he was not a doctor. And he came\nto the barracks \u2014 that was thing about the slave labor camp: on occasion they allowed you\nto go to see the family, you know, if there was a husband and a wife, or a brother and a\nsister, or whatever. So, he comes in. It was like two days prior to taking the transport to\nAuschwitz of which we don\u2019t know anything, I mean, where we were destined to go. He\ncomes in and he brings to his wife a vial with cyanide, and he pulls out of the pockets\nseveral vials and he says to me, \u201cI don\u2019t know where we are going, but I know for sure\nthat we are going to die,\u201d he says. \u201cNow, I brought it for anyone who wants it. I am going\nto use it myself. I am going to give it to my wife. If you want one, you can have it.\u201d It\nwas a little thing, you know. And I remember, I couldn\u2019t \u2014 I just \u2014 it didn\u2019t register\nimmediately, and I thought, \u201cWhat is he talking about? What do I need that for?\u201d And,\nthen I say, \u201cNo, no thank you. I don\u2019t want it.\u201d And it\u2019s not because I wanted to live. It\u2019s\nnot because I knew better. It\u2019s because I knew that I cannot do away with myself if I have\na father and I have two sisters. And here I had an opportunity and people did take their\nlives in the cattle cars on the way to Auschwitz.",
        "Q: You saw that?",
        "A: I didn\u2019t see it, but from the people that we met after the war, when they started to talk\nabout this one and that one and this one. But here I was given the outright opportunity to\nhave that little vial with cyanide in it.",
        "Q: Do you think you actually would have taken it had you not \u2014 if your family wasn\u2019t there,\nif you had been alone?",
        "A: I have no idea. I don\u2019t think so. I wanted to live. I wanted to live in the worst possible\nway. I was young and I never gave up the idea that somewhere, somehow there is a future\nfor us. I believed so strongly, and I think this is what really gave us this courage to\nmanage in the worst situations. In that world of helplessness and hopelessness, if you did\nnot have that desire, 1t just \u2014 you just gave in and that was it. It \u2014 you needed courage for\nthat. I feel that the courage that I had was from my two sisters and I think that they had\nthis responsibility. We all had this responsibility for one another, all the time. And, it\u2019s\nnot \u2014 it\u2019s this being together, and worrying about another, because once we got off the\ntrain in Auschwitz, when we were brought \u2014 we were told to step out of the cattle cars\nand we stood there on the ramp \u2014 it wasn\u2019t a big transport. It was a small group of people.\nAnd being a working unit, not a group, a transport from a ghetto that was liquidated, they\nmost likely felt that they are going to utilize us as labor force in Auschwitz, as well. We\nwere not destined immediately to go to the gas chamber. So, Father stepped out and his\ncar was like the car, the last car, and ours was the first car, where the women were. So we\nwere separated, and I still remember waving to Father, saying goodbye, and he was\nwaving to us. It was such a strange encounter coming to Auschwitz. It was just so awful.\nWe were traveling for about two days. We had several stops because every time a\nmilitary train had to go by and they needed the tracks, they put us on the side track in\nsmall communities. We never knew where we were until finally, we came in. We pulled\ninto a brightly lighted area, and it was like the middle of the night or a little later, and\nthere was always such a mist around Auschwitz because it was - you know, there was a\nlot of humidity. So, we couldn\u2019t see the fences or the electrically charged poles, but all\nwe could see was the big, big light and the mist, a mist all around. The mist was kind of\nlike in a dream. You didn\u2019t \u2014 you saw shapes, but yet you couldn\u2019t see them clearly, and\nnot until daybreak did they take us out \u2014 I mean, they opened the doors and we left the\ncattle cars, and they took us to the barracks. No, before they took us to the barracks, of\ncourse, we had to go through the routine. So, we took our \u2014 all we had, like a little\nknapsack that they let us carry, because that\u2019s all we came with. It\u2019s not like we were\ncoming from home like most of the transports that they brought a lot of personal\nbelongings. We came from a camp. We didn\u2019t have much. So, it was like a knapsack or\nsomething very small where we carried a few personal things, and they brought us to this\nhuge room, I remember, and there were the girls at one desk for registration, and then at\nthe next desk the girls who were tattooing the number, and then there was the next desk\nwhere they were shaving or cutting hair. So, first we went through this \u2014 I mean, we went\nthrough this routine. We had to say where we came from and our names, our age, and\neverything, and this is how the process started. From your name, you become a number.\nSo, they tattooed this number on my arm, and we stood all three one behind the other, and\nit was A14176 for my older sister Hania, 1t was A14177 for me, and it was A14178 for\nRenia. Now, after the war, we found out that the A was a new series, because the\nnumbers were so tremendous by then, that they couldn\u2019t manage anymore. So, they\nintroduced the A and then they introduced the B, I think, for the men, when they\nintroduced the A for the women. We always stood next to one another. So, therefore, now\nif we \u2014 just in case we forget which number is ours, we have on following the next one.",
        "Q: Did you also get a number that you had to sew on to your uniform?",
        "A: Yes. I remember. So, this was the next stage. And I was very, very upset, and I just didn\u2019t\nknow, and I started to cry. I started to cry and the girl who was tattooing the number held\nmy skin tight, and she says, \u201cI\u2019m going to give you such a pretty number,\u201d she says, \u201cthat\nyou'll never regret that you had it.\u201d Because, if you remember, some people had their\nnumber right here on this side of the arm, and the numbers are so big that they start at the\nelbow and end at the wrist, because in those days, people who were tattooing weren\u2019t\nexperienced enough. When we came, which was still towards the end, it was July 1944,\nthe people who \u2014 the women who worked at certain jobs, they were very, very\nexperienced. So, this was the next thing. From there, we went to the benches where they\nwere cutting hair and shaving hair, depending on the individual. I mean, they stood with\nclippers and they also had scissors, and here I am crying, and the girl who puts me down\non the bench and she pushes my hair back, and she says, \u201cDon\u2019t cry. \u2019'm not going to\nshave your head. I'll just cut it short.\u201d So, my hair wasn\u2019t cut short \u2014 I mean, my hair was\ncut short, kind of cropped because I had very long hair. My sister was so gorgeous. She\nhad such beautiful waving hair. She was just such a beautiful, beautiful woman \u2014 girl, and\nthey cut her hair short and Renia has always curly hair so whatever they did was okay.\nAnd as my older sister gets up from the bench, there was a door with a glass in it, and she\nwalked by and she kind of put her hand on her hair and kind of pushed a wave in place,\nand there was a German guard right behind her. He grabbed her by the collar and he put\nher down back on the bench and he said to the girl who was cutting hair, \u201cShave it off.\u201d\nSo, there she is. She had her hair short, and because she dared to look at herself, to see\nlike any human being when there 1s a change that\u2019s coming about you, that you want to\nsee what it looks like, so for this, she had her hair cut \u2014 I mean, shaven. Now, from there,\nwe had to leave everything behind.",
        "Q: I\u2019m sorry, we have to interrupt because the tape is through. We have to go to the next\ntape.\nEnd of Tape #6\nTape #7",
        "Q: Chris, when we stopped the tape the last \u2014 a few minutes ago, you were talking about\nyour sister who had gotten a short hair cut, and then had looked in the mirror and the SS\nofficer grabbed her and said, \u201cReally cut her hair.\u201d",
        "A: Shave it.",
        "Q: Shave it. So, she was shaved then?",
        "A: Right. It was not a mirror. It was just like a glass in a door that was open, and you could\nsee the reflection in it. And he grabbed her with such anger and sat her down back on the\nbench and he said, \u201cShave her head.\u201d So, her is the beautiful girl who is tall and\nattractive, and the hair is the crown of her, so to say, and she\u2019s completely without hair.\nSo, we are pushed from this point into the next room which 1s the shower room. Now, we\ndon\u2019t know where we are going. We heard stories about gas chambers. We never knew\nwhat they looked like. Nobody could describe what a gas chamber was like inside. We\nonly knew stories that people are being gassed and that they are shower heads to make\nbelieve that it\u2019s a shower room. So, from this point, we are driven into that room with\nshower heads in it. If I remember correctly, we have to undress right then, or maybe\nbefore, right after the registration when we reached the next step. It\u2019s not quite vivid in\nmy head, you know, and we had to be undressed.",
        "Q: Can I interrupt for a minute? When your hair was shaved, was your bodily hair shaved\nalso or only your head?",
        "A: At the time only the hair, hair was cut, nothing else, and then we were without clothes,\nwhich means that either we had to undressed right before entering or maybe before the\nhair being cut. It seems to me right before entering. And we entered that room where the\nshower heads, and all of a sudden, you know, while we were inside, the cold water came\nfrom above and it was really very, very cold and we all screamed because it was just\npiercing through your body, and the water didn\u2019t run too long, and we forced out of this\narea into the next area, and there we came to a large room and there were women sitting\nbehind a huge table with all kinds of dresses piled up on top of the table, and you were\nnot handed a garment to wear. Things were thrown at you. So, each of us received a\ndress, a print dress. They did not have uniforms at the time that we arrived. I don\u2019t think\nthey were giving out uniforms anymore. There were so much clothes that was confiscated\nfrom the transport of the arriving people who were put to the gas chambers that they\ndidn\u2019t see any need for uniforms anymore. So, they threw dresses at us. And those were\ninmates, those were girls who were working there in the sauna, in that shower room. We\nnever \u2014 as I mentioned before, size \u2014 there was never a question of whether it was your\nsize, the right size, the wrong size. So, no sooner did we get our clothes thrown at us, if\nsomebody was tall and had a very short dress while another person was very short and\nhad a long dress, and someone was very skinny and had a big dress or vice versa, a\nheavier women a very tightly fitting dress, that we were exchanging among one another,\nwith each other, so that at least we made those things fit. They were smelly dresses\nbecause all they did is they took the discarded clothes and they put it in \u2014 they had such\nhuge vats with disinfectant fluid in it. I don\u2019t think they ever washed the dresses. I think\nthat all they did was they soaked them in that and then they dried them because I\nremember that the dress was kind of damp, whether it was damp because it wasn\u2019t dried\nenough or whether it was damp because the dampness was always there and it was lying\nsomewhere, you know, where it didn\u2019t dry out completely. I don\u2019t know, but we didn\u2019t\nget any undergarments whatsoever. The only thing we have gotten was just a dress to\nwear and nothing else. They allowed us to wear the shoes that we brought with us. Now,\nin most cases, we recognize each other. I couldn\u2019t find Hania. Not only that she didn\u2019t\nlook the way I knew her to look and to be, she was wearing a crazy print dress and\nbecause she had no hair whatsoever and she was very tall and very slim. So, it was like a\npin, a long stem with a head, a small head on top. It was heartbreaking to see that\ntransformation that only was like within a half hour no more, from such a beautiful girl\nthat she was, so attractive and so pretty, to see such a pathetic looking creature. I mean it\nwas just horrible. It was just horrible, my heart was breaking, and we were handed\n[coughs] Excuse me. We were handed like white pieces of cloth with the number that was\nprinted on our arms, and under that white cloth with the number was a triangle. In our\ncase, 1t was a yellow because it was for the Jewish prisoners. So, my number A14177,\nand we had to sew it on, on the garment, and the dresses also had a big, red, wide stripe\non the back. From this point on, we were taken to the barracks, but all morning was\nbasically from the unloading of the train and going through the process until we were\nbrought to the barracks.",
        "Q: Can I interrupt for a minute? The sauna, was it a big room, a small room, were there were\na lot of people?",
        "A: It was a big room. It was a big room. There were people in there, and the fear of the\nunknown when you come into something that you are not familiar with and you don\u2019t\nknow what to expect. So, basically if you are there with other people around you, you\nonly see that far, and nothing beyond. I don\u2019t think that it was in anybody\u2019s mind to stand\nthere and try to figure out, you know, the size of the room or whatever it is. We were\nafraid as we entered. We were frightened by the blast of cold water that came on us. It\nstopped just as fast as it came. So, basically it was a big shock to the mind and to the\nbody simulatenously, you know, because first you don\u2019t know what to expect and then\nthe big shock of that icy cold water coming at you. That was the way we were brought to\nthe barracks, and more or less on our way from the sauna to the barracks, sized up the\nsituation \u2014 what the camp looks like. I mentioned before that we arrived and it was dark\nand between the mist and the lights, you really couldn\u2019t figure out where you were. In\ndaytime, it was a sunshiny day so we could see that there were different areas fenced in,\nwhich meant that there were different sections of the camp. We were also passing by an\narea where there were men. A lot of people during the day when the saw others moving\nalong the roads, they used to come close to the fences to look whether they will spot\nsomeone who is familiar or whatever, and we were brought to the barracks, where Fela\nBerlant (ph) was the schreiberen, and she, of course, counted the group, accepted the\ngroup, made sure that everything was in order, you know, and they brought us to the\ndesignated part of the barracks that our group was to occupy, and we were told so-and-so\nmany women to a space, and that was it. Now, there was no official introduction of what,\nhow and when because this was a very simple thing, you know. Towards the end of the\nday we heard the voice of the woman who was in charge of \u2014 the assistant to the\nbarracks\u2019 Alteste, the girl in charge of the barracks, her assistant, to Zdhlappel, to get out\nof the barracks, outside for counting, and counting was twice a day, in the morning and in\nthe evening, before we had to return back to the barracks. In the beginning, they kept us\nfor a whole month in a quarantine, as if to say that we were bringing some kind of disease\nfrom the outside, to protect the people who were on the inside. It was ridiculous.",
        "Q: Were you in a separate barrack?",
        "A: No, that whole barracks was for all the people. Some of them must have arrived earlier\nthan \u2014 a few weeks or a few days or whatever earlier \u2014 because we were only placed in\none small section, and the barracks were divided in four sections. There were bunk beds.\nThere were aisles and bunk beds in each side. In the middle was a small stove with a\npipe, and then to the sides, there were like four wings, and each wing had an aisle and\nthere were bunk beds on both sides. So, we were taken, as we entered the barracks to the\nright, the first aisle. This is where the whole group was placed.",
        "Q: So, the entire barrack was a quarantine barrack?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And does that mean you had to stay in the barrack all the time?",
        "A: No, we were allowed to go outside, and we weren\u2019t working the first two weeks. We\nweren\u2019t working at all. We were sitting outside. There was nothing to look at, not a blade\nof grass growing in front. It\u2019s dust, when it was dried and it was mud that you were\nsinking in, because it was a clay ground, and we used to sit sometimes trying to take care\nof our clothes 1n order to get the lice out of it, because the dresses that we have gotten,\ninasmuch as they were disinfected, they were full of body lice. Fortunately, we went\nthrough typhus already so we were immune already at least to one disease that we didn\u2019t\nneed. After two weeks, they took us to a place to work and there were huge rocks, and\nthey told us to take the rocks and transfer them to the other side of the big field. So, we\ndid, and the couples who were German inmates, German women inmates, they were\nbeating us. They were always in charge of the working units, and hollering and cursing in\nlanguage, in a kind of a language that we never heard of, we were never exposed to, you\nknow, the names that we were called \u2014 the worst possible names. But, this wasn\u2019t, you\nknow, you accept when you find yourself in a situation like this \u2014 to survive, people were\ndoing all kinds of things that, sometimes to protect their own lives maybe, by being\nmean, mean, bad or whatever to others, by mistreating other people, that they felt that\nthey are going to be protected, that it will give them a certain security and that they will\nsurvive. So, I don\u2019t know the motives why certain people behaved like human beings\nwhile the others behaved like beasts, and the assistant to the Block Alteste was a very,\nvery mean woman. She was beating everybody and she cursing and she was hollering and\nfrom the moment we entered the barracks, she told us, \u201cYou\u2019re never going to get out\nalive of here. Whoever gets out of here 1s through the chimneys.\u201d That was degrading,\nyou know? And the chimneys were quite visible because there were five crematories in\nAuschwitz and you could see them, and you could smell the burning of the human bodies\nand the smoke, it was permeating the air, because in 1944, the transports were coming\nfrom all over and predominately from Hungary, and those people, most of the people,\nwent straight to the gas chambers and to the crematorium. So, you have to kind of\ncondition yourself to a new situation, and on one hand, you are shocked and on the other\nhand you are trying to kind of make peace with yourself that, well, this is the next stage,\nand not to give up hope, that you survived the other situations, that you are going to\nsurvive this one, as well. Yet there was \u2014 inasmuch as there was a lot more hope maybe\nin a way, as you were really fooling yourself to a certain extent, here you had the answers\nright before you that there\u2019s hardly any hope. You were hoping against yourself. I\nremember one night, it was a clear night and they didn\u2019t allow us to get out of the\nbarracks right after the Zahlappel, the counting. Normally, we had a very brief time to go\nto the bathroom, to visit a little bit with each other outside before we entered, but that was\ntime that they were bringing a lot of transports and burning the people, and they just\ndidn\u2019t want for us to be outdoors and witness too many activities. So, I remember it was a\nvery clear night and the smoke, the dark smoke, was coming all day long. I could see it. It\nwas the time of the quarantine yet, and we weren\u2019t yet taken out of the camp to work\nsomewhere else, and the smoke was always there, coming out of the chimneys, and then\nat night you could also see fire \u2014 not the smoke so much as during the day, but you could\nsee fire. And, you know, I was looking out this little window and I thought to myself,\nsuch little tongues of fire were escaping towards the sky, and I thought myself, \u201cIt\u2019s like\nhuman souls trying to go to Heaven.\u201d Fortunately, I didn\u2019t have \u2014 I wasn\u2019t separated upon\nthe arrival from my sisters, and I hoped that Father, who was in good health, if he was put\nto work, that he\u2019s okay. So, I didn\u2019t have this immediate fear that somebody very close\nthat we loved was burned in the crematorium, and yet it was so horrible to think, so\nhorrible to think of how many people who never experienced life, who were either\nteenagers or even little children who came to this world never had a future, and it\u2019s just\nheartbreaking, now that I\u2019m an adult and I am a mother and a parent, and I see how many\ninnocent lives have been lost because of Nazi madness. It\u2019s just terrible. It\u2019s just terrible.\nAnd, this was their way of breaking you down spiritually \u2014 I mean, physically due to the\nfact that they didn\u2019t feed you enough, but spiritually. And also, you know, you kind of\nlost that feeling of \u2014 how am I going to say it \u2014 of self-worth. I mean, there was no future\nwhatsoever. I mean, you were like a pawn in somebody\u2019s hands who was to determine\nwhether you are going to live or whether you are going to die, and you were a pawn\nwithout committing any crime. You were not there because you committed a crime or\nyou because you had done something wrong, or because whatever reason, but because\nyou were a Jew and that was the Final Solution and Auschwitz and Birkenau was the\nplace to bring the Jews for the Final Solution. When they finally started to take us out\nafter the month of isolation, where they called it \u2014 I\u2019m getting upset \u2014 quarantine, and\nthey took us to the front, outside of the camp to different places of work, we could see\ngroups that were passing by as we were marching to work, and in some cases \u2014 among\nthem there were women \u2014 we usually tried to communicate 1n passing to find out where\nthe people were from, so that if they mentioned a familiar name, you called somebody\u2019s\nname from that town that you knew, and if they were among them, they answered and\nthis is how we found my aunt who was from Radom. They were coming from the\nopposite direction and they asked, \u201cWhere are you from?\u201d And we said, \u201cStarachowice.\u201d\nAnd, she started to call our names, and she says, \u201cRemember, I\u2019m here, too, and I\u2019m still\nalive.\u201d That was my aunt Rosha Laks from, she had the same name as I, from Radon. She\nsurvived the war, by the way. And so, there was always the unexpected, sometimes good\nand sometimes bad. When we were coming back from work, we had enough time to go to\nthe bathroom. You know, the bathroom was also a barracks that, that you only were\nallowed a certain number of minutes at a certain time, because it was just one facility for\ntwenty barracks that were in that particular area, and if people had diarrhea and they\nneeded to stay a little longer, the couple was always running back and forth. You know, it\nwas like \u2014 it really wasn\u2019t a bathroom. It was a \u2014 what do they call it in the military, those\nplaces where there are holes in the ground? I don\u2019t know what to call it.",
        "Q: A latrine?",
        "A: A latrine yes, but a latrine \u2014 there is a name for it. I don\u2019t remember. It will come to me\neventually. So, she was running back and forth, and if any one woman needed to use the\nbathroom a little longer. She was hitting, outright hitting, clobbering the people with the\nrubber hose or whatever she had in her hand. But again, there was an advantage in this\nadvantage because when you went to the washroom or you went to the bathroom, there\nwas always a queue because, you know, this was your time and five minutes later was a\ntime for another barracks, and because there were so many new transports coming at that\ntime, 1944 in July, that we could inquire of where the people are from and whether they\nknow anybody that we were looking for. So, sometimes people used to find cousins or\naunts like in our particular case. Not that we had seen my aunt anymore in Auschwitz. It\nwas just the one time when our paths had crossed. So, that was the advantage, inasmuch\nas you were beaten. Food was delivered daily to the work place, and in the evening at\nZahlappel, we were getting our bread and the coffee in the morning. We did not have\nindividual dishes, but they had these bowls that they filled and since we always marched\nfive abreast, five, you know, that a bowl full of food was given to one person and we had\nto pass it around and everybody took a gulp and passed it to the next one, so there was an\norderly distribution of whatever was given in that bowl, whether it was soup or the coffee\nin the morning, quote-unquote, you know. God knows what they had in there.",
        "Q: With that distribution of food, did you all decide we\u2019ll each take on sip until it\u2019s all\nthrough?",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: So you talked amongst each other?",
        "A: Not really. It was kind of an accepted thing that that\u2019s the way it should be, not to take\ntwo gulps when the other person \u2014 for the other person to be deprived of it. But\ndistribution of food, for example, of bread was \u2014 they did Zahlappel in the evening before\nwe entered the barracks. And the piece of bread was mostly sawdust, and I would say a\nsize of maybe two inches by an inch: an inch thick, an inch wide and two inches long. I\nwrote the story about a day in Auschwitz which I called \u201cOne Ordinary Day\u2019, and it\u2019s a\nvery \u2014 it was a very typical difficult day, and we went to work and we worked cutting\ndown marshes along the river to clear the view of the watchtowers because it was\nOctober already of 1944, and there were underground activities, and people were\nescaping and some people were successful, and some people were not, and those who\nwere not successful were brought back to camp and there was a public hanging or they\nwere shot or whatever, but we were cutting the marshes and it was pouring all day and we\nstood in Zahlappel and got wet and went to work and even got wetter, and we stood in\nthe mud that was coming up to our knees and the capo was in a horrible mood and the\nGerman SS men who were escorting the group with the dogs were horrible, and after\nreturning from work, we were told to sing, and we couldn\u2019t sing. I mean, we sang but not\nfor marching, and they wanted us to march in good step with the clay and everything on\nour legs. So, they sicked the dogs on us, and the dogs tore the clothes off the people who\nwere on the outside of the columns. It was just a horrible, horrible day, and then we came\nto our barracks and we lined up for Zahlappel and it 1s still raining and my sister Hania 1s\nin front of the column of the five girls because it was always right in front of the\nbarracks. It was a long line, always five abreast. So, 1f we were marching, we were facing\nthis way, but when we were standing in front of the barracks, there was one in the front\nand four people in the back. And Hania was complaining that she\u2019s dizzy and that she\u2019s\nnot feeling well and that she has a headache and this and that. And we were counted, the\nfood was brought, and Saranka (ph), the woman who was so rough and rude, was the one\nwho was distributing the food. So she was placing five portions of bread in the hands of\nthe person that was in line up front and the person in the front was to pass the bread over\nto the people in the back, and Hania was up front that day, and as the bread was placed in\nher hands, instead of turning around and passing the bread to others, she took the bread \u2014\nthe five portions of bread \u2014 and she brought it to her mouth. She was hungry and she had\nall the bread in her hand, and when I saw it I was right behind her, I started to scream. I\nsaid, \u201cHania, don\u2019t do it. It\u2019s not yours. It belongs to all of us.\u201d And, it wasn\u2019t a matter of\nnot wanting her to eat my bread, but we were only three. There were two girls that were\nno relation whatsoever to us, and I kind of scared her so that all of a sudden, I could see\nthat her eyes have turned like this in her head. She looked at me, and I could see how her\neyes turned around and she became pale and she fell to the ground. And when I looked at\nher lying there on the ground with her hairless head, and by then it was already almost\nthree months in camp where we didn\u2019t look anymore like we looked three months earlier\nwhen we came from the camp. So, between her lying there with a shaved head and her\nface as, you know \u2014 without much flesh, she looked like \u2014 her face was like a skull, and I\nthought that she had died. So, I fell to my knees and I started to cry, and I tried to shake\nher, and I held her hand, and I said to her, \u201cPlease don\u2019t die.\u201d I said to her, \u201cI'll give you\nmy bread. I'll give it to you today. [Il give it to you every day.\u201d And she did not respond,\nand then the woman who was distributing the bread saw a commotion at our end and she\ncame running and she saw what happened. So, she started to holler for someone to bring\na bucket of water, and she poured a bucket of water in Hania\u2019s face. So, when Hania\nopened her eyes \u2014 because she basically fainted from hunger and from exhaustion and\neverything \u2014 and she opened her eyes and I was holding onto her hands, and she had this\nsmile on her face, not knowing at all what has happened to her. So, I picked her up, and I\npropped her up, so to say. I was holding on to her from one side and Renia from the\nother. And at Zahlappel, you have got to stay in line, be in perfect alignment, and\ninasmuch as she was rude and ugly and unbelievable, that assistant to the Block Alteste,\nshe didn\u2019t say anything. She didn\u2019t reprimand us. She didn\u2019t holler. She did nothing. We\njust stood for the rest of Zahlappel, and then when we went to the barracks, we all went\nto bed and lied down in our wet dresses. There was no way how to dry them and where to\nhang them, but we were nine people in that space, so we kind of cuddled together, hoping\nthat the clothes on our bodies will be dry the next morning when we have to get up and\ngo to work again. So, these were the different experiences. From Father we didn\u2019t hear at\nall, inasmuch as we were hoping that somehow no matter what, we would be able to\nmake contact with him. People told us that there was a way of contact men, because there\nwere always male inmates that were coming as electricians, as plumbers, to the camp. So,\nthat if we were to know where he is, because there were different villages around. There\nwere different factories where they employed people. That if we know exactly which\ncampsite that he is at, that maybe there would be a chance for us to find out. While we\nwere in Birkenau in that barrack, we couldn\u2019t know anything about Father, and we\nourselves were already reaching a point where even our feelings and emotions were\ndying in us. Forget about everything else. You know, you have compassion for people,\nyou try to assist others, and so forth and so on, and then you reach a point that not only\nyour body gives up physically, but even your emotions and your feelings. That\u2019s why so\nmany people tried to end their lives and ran to the electrically charged fences. Because if\nthey were alone, they couldn\u2019t cope with this life anymore. That was enough for them.\nSo, it was at a point now that there was almost no hope, and it is Fela Berlant (ph), the\nschreiberen, who went with a report to the headquarters and found out that they need\nclerks, office clerks, and came running and told us to follow her without a word, without\ntoo much commotion that we were able to secure a better position that brought us into a\nnew life \u2014 a new life that we didn\u2019t even know that existed in Birkenau. So, we recovered\nphysically, mentally, for a short duration. So, we had three months of horrible experience,\nand then we had about two and a half months \u2014 November, December, until January 14\"\n\u2014 that put us back on our feet and we were able to again withstand the difficulties of the\ndeath march that followed. And this, too, was a difficult thing inasmuch as we were in a\nmuch better situation than anybody else because we had good shoes and we had a warm\ncoat and we had gloves and we had scarves and we had hats and we had clothes on us. It\nwas not like the situation when we first came, the first three months, that outside of one\ndress, we didn\u2019t have anything. And another thing that helped us to pull through that\nperiod of the death march was that the Polish women with whom we worked had some\nsupplies because they were always getting some food from home. So, they had a little bit\nof sugar that they divided between the people as we were leaving the camp, and it 1s the\ncombination of snow \u2014 it was snowing, it was cold, it was terrible \u2014 but it was the snow\nthat kept us going because no matter how tired you were, you rubbed your face with the\ncold snow, you were more alert, and by mixing the snow with a little bit of sugar, it gave\nyou a little bit of energy, which was also very good. But here we had a problem with\nRenia because she just could not walk. She was very sleepy and we knew that no sooner\nwill she sit down at the edge of the road \u2014 there were so many people driven at the time\nfrom every field, from the men\u2019s area and the women, so it was whoever sat down or bent\nover or ran into the field to relieve themselves or whatever were shot to death \u2014 and\nRenia couldn\u2019t walk and she started \u2014 she was delirious \u2014 and she started hallucinating.\nSo, Hania and I grabbed her under her arms and we dragged her. As bad as the snow was,\nbecause it was very cold, it was very convenient for walking because we didn\u2019t really\nhave \u2014 we weren\u2019t forced march and sing like when we were going out to work in the\nfields. We were all kind of sliding on that snow, and Renia didn\u2019t have to walk. She was\njust sliding along. And they brought us to a huge barn. I remember that, and the barn was\n\u2014I mean, it was supposed to be a shelter, but it wasn\u2019t really a shelter. It was as huge\nbarn where the Nazi soldiers, the SS men, could keep us contained in one area, locked in,\nbut the boards were missing and there was no roof, you know, and the wind was howling\nand blowing and it was snowing. But we were kind of together for the night, and then we\nmarched for another two or three days. And dead bodies were strewn all over the road, all\nalong the road. It was men and women, because so many thousands of people were\ndriven out of Auschwitz. Only those who were not able to get out of bed remained, but\neverybody else was just driven out of Auschwitz until, I think, about 40 kilometers from\nAuschwitz. They put us on a train. It was a flatbed, and it was full of snow, and we\ntraveled from that town, I don\u2019t remember the name of it, but I know it was about 40\nkilometers from Auschwitz, and they took us to Ravensbriick",
        "Q: Let me go back to Auschwitz for just a moment. You so often express a very powerful\ndrive to live when you describe who you were then. Were the three of you, since this was\nthe center of your lives, I\u2019m sure each of you had other friends or people that you knew,\nbut I\u2019m assuming that this is closest, that group.",
        "A: That was a family.",
        "Q: Were you all sharing equally in that hope, or did one of you get less hopeful and the other\none pull them out? Do you have any recollection how you operated emotionally together?",
        "A: There was never a discussion about it. It was an instinctive kind of a reaction to situation.\nIf I was \u2014 if I was \u2014 if I could be of more help to one particular situation, I did it. If Hania\nwas in a situation where she could be of help to the others, it was the same thing. I don\u2019t\nknow what was on my sisters\u2019 minds. We didn\u2019t have conversations. We had each other,\nthe physical being. There was no conversation. I mean, on occasion, yes, when we could,\nwhen we were allowed and we were not beaten and we were not exhausted and when our\nmind was functioning in a way that you needed, but what you thought about basically\nwere the immediate needs and how are you going to manage the next day, to pull through\nit, and in what way this is going to happen. I know that at one point I developed a boil in\nmy leg, and they took me to the infirmary and I was in the infirmary for several days \u2014 I\ndon\u2019t know whether it was a week or whatever \u2014 and it was a friend of my mother\u2019s who\nsaw my name, who was working in that infirmary, who was a nurse in that infirmary, and\nwhen she saw my name and asked whether I know Pola Laks, I told her, \u201cI\u2019m her\ndaughter.\u201d That she saw to it that I was returned back, when I was through, that I was\nreturned back to the same barracks from which I came. Because normally they never send\nyou back. They send you to the crematorium if you did not recover, and in most cases\npeople did not recover, but due to the fact that she kind of found out that I\u2019m the daughter\nof someone she knew or was fond of, that she took care of me and she sent me back to\nthe barracks. So, I was very fortunate to be reunited with my sisters. There was a\nsituation where my little sister disappeared completely and we didn\u2019t see her for 24\nhours, and I don\u2019t even know where she was. And, then all of a sudden she appeared,\nbut... And whenever I ask her, she says, \u201cI don\u2019t know. I just don\u2019t know what happened,\nwhere I was.\u201d So, there was this constant fear of \u201care we going to be together? Is\nsomething going to happen to us that we are going to be separated? What is going to\nhappen?\u201d For one reason or another, whatever the situation developed good or bad, we\nsomehow managed to remain together. It wasn\u2019t that we were so smart or that we knew\nhow to manage. It was really without knowing, without knowing, and still I\u2019m told today,\nI think it\u2019s providence. I think there is nothing else that one could really explain why\nthings happened to us the way they did.",
        "Q: You would not describe the three of you as having a leader in some way \u2014 that one of you\nwas more...",
        "A: Well, I think that we all shared a certain responsibility. On my part, I felt that my\nresponsibility is to take care of my two sisters. I\u2019m sure that they felt the same way about\nme, but there was never a division of duties or whatever. I mean, we had our portion of\nfood that we shared, and we did not \u2014 fortunately, we were not confronted with any kind\nof a disease that would have separated us for a long period, only the boil on my leg,\nwhich fortunately healed fast and I was returned, but otherwise, in the three months that\nwe were in Auschwitz \u2014 Renia was beaten once very, very badly because she dared to dip\nher pan into a cauldron with soup as it was delivered to the barracks. The deliverers were\npeople who went to the kitchen and two people carried the cauldron of soup. So, she was\nnearby and she had a cup in her hand, and she dipped it, and she was beaten terribly.",
        "Q: Did she have to go to the infirmary?",
        "A: No. She was black and blue and swollen, but she didn\u2019t have to go.",
        "Q: The day \u2014 I can\u2019t remember was it you and Hania who were going to the new job \u2014 and\nRenia was behind, right? The Block Alteste, who you described as an extremely brutal\nterrible woman, or am I wrong? Was it only the assistant?",
        "A: The assistant was so brutal. It was different. The Block Alteste was also a Jewish girl\nfrom Slovakia, but she was a different type. She was very \u2014 maybe she had\nunderstanding, but we did not come into contact with her that much. In the administration\nof the barracks, there were those three women \u2014 the Block Alteste \u2014 they were all Jewish\nwomen who came in at the very early stage. So, it was 1942, 1943, you know. Fela was\nthe schreiberen. She had a big mouth, and she hollered all day, but she didn\u2019t hit and she\ndidn\u2019t beat and her toughness was expressed, you know, as I said barking, because this is\nlike some dogs barks and they don\u2019t bite. So, basically she didn\u2019t do any harm to anybody\noutside of hollering and then was this other women who never held her arms steady, but\nlike a windmill. Her arms were going and whoever was in the way got beat up. And she\nwas the one who was insulting and was calling us horrible names, and calling us whores,\nand God knows what. So, when I think about it now, and I know that she came with the\nfirst transport of women to Auschwitz, and they were 500 or whatever the number was,\nand small number of them remained, you know, survived and at the point when we came,\nthat she must have been very bitter and because she lost everybody. She felt that this \u2014\nthat we have to go through the same kind of a suffering that her group did and she was\ninflicting the pain on us, which gave her the security of the job that she had. But there\nwas a human aspect to her that I see now that I\u2019m older, that basically she didn\u2019t have to\nbe so helpful when Hania fainted. She could\u2019ve just walked by without any reaction\nwhatsoever, and yet she made sure that she revived her by throwing the bucket of water\nand allowing us to stand there, and not being sympathetic or having any kind words or\nanything. It was all in the same manner, in a rude, hollering manner. But I explain it, so\nto say as, the human side of her by sheer demonstrating her willingness to assist.",
        "Q: Okay, let\u2019s change the tape.\nEnd of Tape #7\nTape #8",
        "Q: Before we say more about after the death march to Ravensbrick and your experiences up\nuntil liberation, Chris, explain what the Effektenkammer was, this new job that the three\nof you had. You \u2014 the last time, you talked about how important it was for you, what it\ndid in terms of changing your self-image, and feelings of self-esteem with the people you\nwere working for. I also want to know whether you understood the place of that work\nkommando in the structure of Auschwitz, how Auschwitz was being organized, or did\nyou simply know the structure of that particular kommando?",
        "A: I wasn\u2019t even familiar \u2014 I didn\u2019t even know that a kommando like this exists. About\nKanada we heard, because of all the belongings of the Jewish transports were going to\nKanada, where the good things were separated from the worn things and sent to Nazi\nGermany. But I never knew there was such a thing of Effektenkammer, where Christian\nPolish women were employed and they were in charge of the belongings of political\nprisoners that were brought. Everybody had a different assignment. There were groups.\nLike, there was, again, the administrative part of the operation; there was the group that\nwas storing the clothes; there was the group that was... kept whatever other belongings\nwere. My job was with another girl, a Christian girl \u2014 her name was Ioasha, Ioasha\nHaborra (ph) \u2014 and we were in charge of suitcases. So, I walked into the room, a large\nroom that had lots and lots of shelves, and the shelves were full of different sizes\nsuitcases. None of them were real large. Some were satchels, some were like knapsack\nkind of canvas bags, and some were a small suitcase and all of that. We were very\nwelcome by the group, the 20 Jewish women, or 25 Jewish women who were sent to\nreplace the other \u2014 other Polish women who were sent on transport, and they treated us\nvery, very well. I think I mentioned before that they were mostly intelligent women,\neducated women and they were very kind to us. We found out later on that there were\nmany among them who were Jews on assumed papers. So, I would say that we were like\n50/50 or maybe even more Jews, but some of them were under false papers and\nconsidered themselves Christian, I mean, considered themselves as Poles rather than\nPolish Jews. The job we had to do was, when a person was released from Auschwitz, a\nPolish political prisoner, that we had to make sure that the belongings she brought, that\nher personal belongings that she brought \u2014 her clothes and so forth and so \u2014 were\ntransferred with her, or if she was released from the camp, that everything went with her\nas well. During this period that we worked together, we had to gain the confidence of the\nPolish women that were there before because, as we were getting more and more\nacquainted, and as the underground activities were kind of increasing and there was more\ncontact with the outside, that we had to be part and parcel of what was happening, and I'll\ngive you an example. There were women who were working in very important\ndepartments, and it\u2019s only there that we found out what was happening. There were\nwomen who had access to the lists of daily transports. There were women who worked in\nthe laboratory were Dr. Mengele was doing experiments on the children, and they had\nevery record what was being done to the children and so forth, and other very important\noperations performed by the Nazi on the campsite to which nobody was privy and it\nnever left the camp. And yet, through this Effektenkammer, every once in a while, a list\ncame in, a piece of paper came in that I never witnessed openly where I would be able to\nread or see what was written, but let\u2019s say on two occasions Ioasha and I had to rip apart\na suitcase and glue in a letter, an envelope, into the lining of the suitcase or place an\nenvelope once in the bottom of a pocketbook. And it went with the person that was\nreleased from camp. Now, how did I know what we were doing? We were just told that\nthis is a mission that we have to fulfill and that we should not ask any questions. How did\nthey find out about it? I remember, there was a woman Krystyna Jevulska (ph), an\ninmate, and she was a Jewish woman from the Lodz. But she came to Auschwitz under\nan assumed name as a political \u2014 Krystyna Jevulska (ph) \u2014 as a political prisoner, and she\nhad contacts on the outside. The family that she maintained contact with was sending to\nher packages, food packages, monthly so nobody could suspect that she was Jewish,\nbecause if you have family outside and they send you food packages, then you definitely\n\u2014 Jews did not have anybody who was sending daily packages. And I remember one day\n\u2014 we ate together most of the time. We didn\u2019t have to stand on Zahlappel, and sometimes\nwe didn\u2019t eat the food for the camp, but they give us some provisions that we could\nprepare a meal by ourselves. We were a small group. So, I remember one day, a package\ncame for Krysia Jevulska (ph), and in the package was a hard-boiled egg, and the joy and\nthe happiness was indescribable. I mean we didn\u2019t know why was everybody so excited.\nWell, after a while when things had simmered down, we were told that in that letter \u2014 in\none of the letters, I don\u2019t know which one, whether the one in the suitcase or the one in\nthe pocketbook that was sent out, a message was sent to the family that was sending to\npackages to Krysia that if they receive this letter \u2014 because of course there was important\ninformation that had to be sent out in that concealed envelope \u2014 that if they receive this\ninformation that should include in the food package that they are sending one hard-boiled\negg, which will be an indication that they know what is going on and that they received\nit. So, in a way, it was so important to know that in all that horrible experience that each\nand every person that was incarcerated went through, that some news about what was\ngoing on in camp was reaching the outside world. I mean, I\u2019m only talking about the\ndepartment of the suitcases. In what other ways things were smuggled out, I don\u2019t know.\nI\u2019m sure that they never used the same system, because they would be caught sooner or\nlater. So, there must have been different departments. Departments must have been\nsending news out. That was, so to say, the only possible way of contacting \u2014 for the\ninmates to contact the outside, the outside world.",
        "Q: But, it must have been very complicated because, if you are only having the property of\ninmates who are there, and they get them back when they leave, so whoever in the\nunderground or the resistance in Auschwitz wants to get information out, they have to\nknow who\u2019s leaving.",
        "A: No, the idea was that the person who was leaving, they would never put something with a\nperson who was not trustworthy. And the woman was told that, once you are out of camp,\nthis 1s \u2014 you have something in the suitcase or in the pocketbook or wherever. They never\n\u2014 for her not to be afraid, I\u2019m sure they didn\u2019t tell her where exactly it is, I mean, in\nwhich place and how to do it, but they must have told her that somewhere \u2014 I mean, it\u2019s\nnot that I did, you know, it\u2019s how I knew about it \u2014 that she was aware of taking out of\ncamp something that was very important for the people who were outside to know, and\nthis is how we got the hard-boiled egg. That was only one time in my being in that\nEffektenkammer which was just unbelievable. But we had a wonderful three months that,\nas I said before, that we regained not only our physical strength but our self-esteem, and\nit gave us hope that somehow there is a chance that we\u2019ll be able to come out of this hell.",
        "Q: Do you remember you and your friend being told by a particular person to put this letter\ninto this purse?",
        "A: Oh, sure.",
        "Q: Do you know who it was?",
        "A: It was \u2014 always, there were people who were in charge. There was Maria, who was the\ncapo, she was a Polish \u2014 she was a Polish political prisoner, a very wonderful person.",
        "Q: What was her last name? Do you remember?",
        "A: [Shakes head. ]",
        "Q: She was the head of the Effektenkammer, or she was...\u201d",
        "A: She was the head of the Effektenkammer, of the fifty women who worked there. Maria,\nand she \u2014 why I know Maria because Krystyna Jevulska (ph) was writing poetry, and she\nwrote a poem about all the people who were involved in different jobs, and she described\nthem \u2014 who they were and what they did, and her poetry was also sent out. She passed\naway. She lived in Germany after the war. She\u2019s gone, too. It\u2019s a shame, you know? I had\nthe last interview with her that was done in the \u201880s. She was sick by then with cancer,\nand she really gave the interview of her life, you know, who she was \u2014 the Jewish girl\nfrom Lodz, Landa was her name, her last name, and she came to live in Warsaw and how\nshe was arrested in Warsaw and her contacts with all the people. I think she was a\nCommunist, a member of the Communist party. She was like \u2014 I would say she was the\ninverse of a university student right before the war, and university students had all kinds\nof organizations and Jews were not very welcome in too many organizations, university\norganizations. So, most of the young Jewish people were so infatuated with the ideology\nof Communism that I think she was one of the members. She speaks about it briefly in\nthat interview, but not much. Beautiful woman, just great personality.",
        "Q: Were there ever selections in the Effektenkammer?",
        "A: Never.",
        "Q: So you very quickly felt safe?",
        "A: Immediately, there was never a selection. There was only a fear of being transferred to a\ndifferent camp. And, there was no guarantee because the other, the Polish women who\nwe replaced, they felt very secure there. There were no selections, but they took them out\nbecause they wanted to bring a new element so they shouldn\u2019t feel so very comfortable\nwith each other. The Nazis must have suspected that something is going on there. Plus\nthey had contact with the men outside of the camp. The Effektenkammer was near\nKanada and therefore, the unloading of the... There was a lot of moving around there.",
        "Q: Did you ever \u2014 a woman by the name of Katya Songer ever come into your\nEffektenkammer? She was head of the camp offices.",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Or a woman names Tsip1?",
        "A: [Shakes head]",
        "Q: Did you ever hear the camp orchestra?",
        "A: Sure. We they were playing when we were marching out and marching in.",
        "Q: Did that anger you, bother you, was it good music? Do you remember anything?",
        "A: You know, when you are kind of brainwashed that this is the way to function and you get\nused to that routine and you hear that orchestra already and you know that you are\napproaching the barracks and pretty soon you\u2019ll get your ration of bread. That was the\nmost welcome thing I would say. I don\u2019t know whether it was or it wasn\u2019t, but that\u2019s\nanother thing, the orchestra. They performed for the Nazis with concerts of Wagner and\nthen they played marches for the groups leaving the camps. I don\u2019t really remember\nexactly. I remember the orchestra, I remember the marches, but that\u2019s all I remember\nabout it. I remember when Mala committed, cut her veins, when she was caught after she\nescaped and she was brought back, because they called everybody to witness her\nhanging. When we were in Effektenkammer, or no, when we were in Effektenkammer,\nthere was another hanging of the courageous four women who were bringing in Rosa\nRobota, and Sapirstein, and Weisblum, the four girls who were working with the\nexplosives and they were bringing each day to camp and giving it to and giving it to the\nSonderkommando, so they could build a bomb and blow up the crematorium. But we did\nnot really actually witness it. So, you know, there were so many different activities of\ncourage and trying to make the world aware what is happening and what is taking place.\nSome of the news came out, because after all, young Karski came to the United States,\nand I love that man. I mean it\u2019s unbelievable how courageous that man was to be able to\nbe smuggled into a camp and out and be an eyewitness and bring the news to Britain and\nbring the news to Roosevelt in the United States without a note on him. He had to commit\neverything to memory because he couldn\u2019t do it any other way. And the courage of that\nman to do it and then to be so disappointed that it took so long before some action was\ntaken on the part of the British and the American government to somehow assist and help\nin this situation or find an answer to whatever or to send airplanes to bomb or whatever.\nIt wouldn\u2019t have mattered if some of the inmates would have been killed in the process,\nbecause we were all dying. One way or another we would have been dead. But they\nwould have discovered in 1944 about the atrocities and how many millions of people\nwere killed and they could have stopped, even if they had done it in 1944, you know,\nhundreds of thousands of people could have lived.",
        "Q: Did you think when you were there, why isn\u2019t the world doing something?",
        "A: Yeah, I thought about it \u2014 why the world isn\u2019t doing something, why God allows for it to\nhappen. I mean, there\u2019s all kinds of things that go through your mind. Again, I\u2019m going to\nsay that you just have so much time to think. Otherwise, you are like a robot.",
        "Q: You just keep going. Or you don\u2019t.",
        "A: That\u2019s it. I mean, one track mind. If I do such and such, maybe I'll get to the end of the\ntunnel.",
        "Q: In you description, it appears as if you \u2014 if you and your sisters hadn\u2019t gotten a job in the\nEffektenkammer, who knows? You wete ...",
        "A: We wouldn\u2019t have survived.",
        "Q: You wouldn\u2019t have survived?",
        "A: No, definitely not, because at this point another two weeks, and I don\u2019t know who would\nhave broken down first, but anyone of us, if one of us was gone then the other two would\nhave followed, and it doesn\u2019t really matter in which order.",
        "Q: Was there anything else about the Effektenkammer that you wanted to?",
        "A: I think that this is pretty much what we want to cover and the mere fact that when we left\nthe the Effektenkammer, we were dressed warmer and so forth, and it\nwas easier to cope with the death march which was not easy again, and was very difficult\nemotionally and physically and all that, and finally, when we arrived in Ravensbrick, I\ndon\u2019t know whether the trip on the train was for two days or for three days or whatever it\nwas, we were brought again for registration, because there were not normally a transport\nthat was transferred, had papers and the number of inmates and so forth. This was such a\ndisarray that no documents followed us. So, we had to register again, and as we\napproached the registration desk, right then and there, we decided we are going to change\nour names to Christian names. So, we became \u2014 we assumed the last name Gorska, and\nthe first name \u2014 Hania and Reina remained the same \u2014 and I changed my name to\nKrystina because I wanted to have a true Christian name, and my sisters called me Krysia\nbecause it\u2019s a nickname for Krystina, and until this day I\u2019m Krysia to my sisters and\nKrysia to my nieces and nephews and to my grandchildren, because they hear \u201cKrysia,\nKrysia\u201d and they like the sound of it.",
        "Q: Did other Jewish women do the same thing?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. It just happened. Sometimes all those things \u2014 you don\u2019t plan anything. We\ndidn\u2019t plan anything. We didn\u2019t have a strategy to follow. Everything was on an impulse.\nYou either took advantage of a situation, maybe, 1f you knew what was happening or just\nsheer coincidence, but here we knew that, after we were with the Polish women, the\nPolish kommando, we knew that Polish political prisoners have a better chance to survive\nthan the Jews, but it didn\u2019t matter when we came to Ravensbrtick. Ravensbrtick was\ndesigned for 20,000 women and there were 80,000 of us when we came in. The\nconditions were deplorable. There was no standing room. It was something awful, and\nafter the death march, even though we had warmer clothes and everything, we wouldn\u2019t\nhave lasted more than two weeks in Ravensbritck, between the beating and no food\nwhatsoever and the tortures that were inflicted on us by the camp inmates, by the capos,\nby the Aufseherinnen, the SS women in uniform \u2014 it was just unbelievable. So, I kind of\nblock out completely Ravensbrick from my mind because it was of short duration and\nthe only thing that I remember of Ravensbrick was that we changed our names. That\u2019s\nthe only thing. And the next thing I remember from Ravensbrick is that the uniformed\nmen walked into the barracks and asked for 50 volunteers. And because, as I said, there\nwas standing room only and we were always \u2014 we never pushed like other people, so we\nwere always the last ones to come in, always in the draft and near door and God knows\nwhere. So we were sitting on the floor and I turn to Hania and I say, \u201cWhat do you\nthink?\u201d And she says, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d And then we came to the conclusion, because he said\nhe\u2019s coming the following morning for the volunteers, he took everybody\u2019s name and\nthat\u2019s it, and then I said to Hania, \u201cWell, do you think we did the right thing?\u201d And we\ncame to the conclusion that if we remain in Ravensbruck, we are for sure dying within\ntwo or three weeks. If this 50 volunteers are going to be taken to die or to be killed, then\nit will happen immediately, but there is also a chance that they need 50 volunteers to go\nto work somewhere else. And he came in the morning and picked up the 50 volunteers,\nthey put us on the truck, and they were all women from all over. There was a woman\nfrom Hungary, and a woman from Yugoslavia, and from Czechoslovakia, and we were\nPolish from Poland, and they were German women, I mean Jewish German women, and\nwe all were on the truck and we were traveling for a half hour, for an hour, and we were\nstill on the truck. Nobody stopped the truck. So, after two hours, we came to the\nconclusion, we looked at each other and we came to the conclusion that they didn\u2019t have\nto drag us for that long to kill us, that we are going somewhere where they want to make\nuse of us one way or another. So, they brought us to Retzow. Retzow was a military\ncamp. It was a Luftwaffe, the air force, that was brought back because it was in\nMecklenberg, which was the northern part of Germany close to the Baltic Sea between\nLiibeck and Hamburg, and they needed people to work in the airfield to dig ditches \u2014 not\nditches, but trenches and so forth, and do the work and cleaning. So, the first transport\nthat arrived was basically for administrative jobs or for cleaning offices. So, they were\nthe ones like the girls from Slovakia who were experienced administrators, so they got\nthe good jobs, and we took whatever it was. Hania was cleaning offices and Renia was\nlike a valet to a German SS woman, and I was also cleaning offices, and Hania tells this\nvery nice story from Retzow that she was cleaning offices. Among the space that she had\nto clean was the office of one of the officers, and he always left papers, and he had the\nradio there and everything. And Hania, realizing the situation, that papers are always\nthere, pretended that she doesn\u2019t speak any German. So, he\u2019s talking to her and he\u2019s\ntelling her what to do. So, she says, \u201cNicht verstein\u201d (ph) and \u2014 Hania tells this story and\nI always laugh about it \u2014 \u201cNicht verstein\u201d (ph), which means in kind of a broken way, \u201cI\ndon\u2019t understand anything.\u201d Because no sooner did he go out, she went to look at what\nwas on the desk or she listened to the radio. So, one day he was still suspicious. He\nwanted to know what\u2019s going on. So, he comes in and she\u2019s there on the floor scrubbing\nthe floor with a brush, and mopping up the floor, and he says to her, you know, he wanted\nto catch her, \u201cDid you hear what they announced on the radio?\u201d And she says, \u201cNicht\nverstein.\u201d So, he looks at her with contempt and she says, \u201cSo gross ker faxen and so\ndom\u201d (ph) which means, \u201cSo gross ker faxen\u201d (ph) \u2014 so tall, because \u2014 and so stupid. So,\nthis is Hania\u2019s favorite story from it, but she heard every bit of news every day. When she\ncame in the morning, that was the first room she had to clean. So, she heard the news and\nthen she went to work. And Renia, because she was kind of a valet to the SS woman who\nwas in charge of the entire group of supervising women in camp, so she liked Renia a lot,\nand she says, \u201cHow can I help you? Would you like to have some food? Are you\nhungry?\u201d And this, and, Renia says to her, \u201cNot really. I don\u2019t want you to give me\nanything, but my middle sister is a very good cook, and if you just could see to it that my\nmiddle sister gets a job in the kitchen, then it will be just wonderful.\u201d So, she went to the\nchef and she told him that she has a girl that she would like to work in the kitchen, that\nshe\u2019s a very good cook and that she knows how to prepare good food, and for the food\nespecially that \u2014 not for the camp food, but for the SS people. So, they gave me a job in\nthe kitchen, and the kitchen was whatever had to be done. Either I was in charge of the\nbig kettle where we cooked for camp, or I was preparing hamburgers for the German men\nin uniform that were in the Air Force, or we used to cook that farina every morning for\nbreakfast for the military. So, that was good because you couldn\u2019t be hungry anymore,\nand we were cutting up the bread that was rationed for the eventual groups of people that\ncame after us. We were the first ones. We were there for a few days, and they brought\nabout a few thousand women to do the outside work. I remember once there were girls\nsweeping the floor outside and I was standing and frying hamburgers for lunch or for\ndinner for the Germans, and I saw the girls outside the fence. It wasn\u2019t very far and the\nwindow was big and wide open, and I was flipping the hamburgers and I was every once\nin a while flipping one outside, and so help me, I still remember, there is a woman who\nlives in Miami and she\u2019s Hania, also Hania, and she always says, \u201cI grabbed one of those\nhamburgers you threw out the window.\u201d So, you know, you didn\u2019t have to \u2014 you just had\nto be there to take advantage of every little situation, and you know, it didn\u2019t do \u2014 I mean,\nI haven\u2019t done any heroic deeds. I saw people are there. I figured whoever grabs it will\ngrab it.",
        "Q: What would any...?",
        "A: The chef was not in.",
        "Q: So, nobody saw?",
        "A: So, nobody saw, and whoever was in charge was an inmate like myself. So, if she was\nangry or mean, she could have done me in, but the chef wasn\u2019t there. So, I figured, all\nright.",
        "Q: Of course, some functionary could have been watching a hamburger fly out the window.",
        "A: Could have been, but I don\u2019t think that I would have taken that much of a risk if I would\nhave seen there is a danger because, I mean, there 1s a little logic to doing things, and it\nwasn\u2019t happening every day. It just \u2014 this particular situation, because there\u2019s still this girl\nwho always reminds how I was throwing out the hamburger, and how she was lucky to\ngrab one off the ground.",
        "Q: Were you able to somehow get food so you could bring it to your two sisters?",
        "A: Always, that was my job. That was really my job because in the beginning, I was in\ncharge of the kettle, the big kettle. So, what we did is we were lighting the fire \u2014 there\nwas like a huge, huge metal container, and under it was where the fire was burning, and\nwe had to all night we had to feed \u2014 I mean, the wood, place the wood so that the kettle\nwould be cooking. So, this meat, to prepare a meat base for a soup, you had to cook it for\nhours and hours because I don\u2019t think it was beef, I think it was horse meat at the time.\nAnd that was prepared for the soldiers. So, there were several of us who remained in the\nkitchen all night, not all the time because there were shifts, you know, sometimes one\ngroup of women and sometimes another group of women. The week that I was working\nat night with the other women, then at four o\u2019clock in the morning, we were separated\nfrom the camps because, due to the fact that we were cooking for the soldiers and\ncleaning for the soldiers, they didn\u2019t want us to live in the campsite. But under the\nkitchen in the basement, they set up cots for us to sleep in and wash and keep ourselves\nclean. So, in the morning, like at four o\u2019clock in the morning, before the chef came in, we\nused to have aprons \u2014 big, heavy canvas aprons \u2014 so one of the girls was standing there\nwith a hook fishing out the tongs and the other small parts of the meat that we were able\nto get out, and put it in the apron, in one of the aprons, and two of us were on the look-out\neach way, and one was running with that hot stuff in that canvas apron. We used to come\nin \u2014 We were all in one room, the 50 of us, all in one room. So, we dumped it like on\nwhatever it was, I don\u2019t remember, whether on the bed or on the table and we started to\nrip it apart and eat it.",
        "Q: So, all 50 of you, as many as could share would share?",
        "A: Yes. There was always enough. Then, I mean, when I wasn\u2019t in the kitchen at night, I\nremember how we worked \u2014 but there were other girls that were on that shift, you know,\nthen they did it. So, this is the way we survived in Retzow. And then, of course, we\nstarted to see the airplanes flying, and I remember when they threw leaflets, and they\nwere announced that Roosevelt passed away and Harry Truman became President,\nbecause we came to Retzow in February. We came at the end of January to Ravensbrick,\nand two weeks later, like end of February, and this must have been March or April. I\ndon\u2019t remember when Roosevelt passed away. This I remember, and they were always\nsounding the sirens because of the fear of the attacks from the air, and so, I was watching\nthe women. We were all so happy when we saw those silver planes. It was such a\ndelightful thing, and especially when it was on a weekend, on a Sunday, when we didn\u2019t\nwork, because there was no personnel there. And the way people reacted to situations,\nyou know? Hania used to get a hold of any food that was available and she was eating\nand eating and eating and eating like there was no tomorrow. There wasn\u2019t a problem\nanymore with food, as I mentioned to you, because I was working near food and we were\nnot that starved. There was another girl \u2014 this was also a very unusual kind of a thing \u2014\nbut she used to fill a bucket with water, undressed completely, and she stood there and\nshe was washing her body. For the duration of that period, from the time when the alarms\nsounded until the alarm sounded again that it\u2019s over, she stood there and she was washing\nfrom head to toe, just pouring water on her as if to cleanse herself from God knows what.\nAnd you watch people behave in situations that are so strange, and you can\u2019t figure out\nwhy people would do such things, a nervous reaction of one kind or another. Hania\u2019s\neating was not because she was hungry. It was a nervous reaction, and of course, before\nlong, we find out that the war was over. It was the beginning of May \u2014 fourth or fifth of\nMay \u2014 when we could see that the whole thing is getting out of control, even the people\nwho were in charge of the camp were not paying much attention, and everybody was\ntrying to kind of escape. We were getting packages by then the Count Bernadotte has\narranged through the Red Cross to send packages to inmates in different campsites like\nBergen-Belsen and whatever was close by. So, they were care packages that came, and in\nthe care packages was chocolate and cigarettes. So, the Nazis took out the cigarettes and\nchocolate and distributed the rest of the food \u2014 crackers, sardines, whatever was there,\nwhich was okay, maybe it was better, because otherwise we would have gotten sick, God\nknows what, and then Renia, Hania knowing what was going on and Renia sensing from\nthat woman for whom she worked that something is going to happen soon, all of a sudden\nis very patronized by that woman. The war may end soon, and after all, it hasn\u2019t been so\nbad in camp, and if a question comes up that \u2014 how the Germans behaved, I hope you are\ngoing to give a kind word - this kind of a thing, these kinds of conversations. By then,\nthey were trying to kind of save their own skin. Then, they came in the morning and they\nsaid the came is being evacuated. Now, where evacuated, nobody knew. Now, I find out\nthat this constant moving from one camp to the other was for the Nazis to save their own\nskin, because if they wouldn\u2019t have had the prisoners to move them around, they would\nhave been compelled to go to the front, and they wanted to save their lives. So, as long as\nthey were in charge of the prisoners, they had a very legitimate excuse why they have to\nremain. But by then, when we saw they were losing control of anything that is happening,\nand we were taken out from the camp and we came to that main road that led to this\ncommunity, there was so much going on. People from everywhere going in every\ndirection with little wagons loaded with household belongings and God knows, and you\ncould see uniforms, German uniforms, thrown along the road. People were trying to get\ninto civilian clothes to escape, not to be caught in uniform. So, it was just a horrible thing\nand we were driven and driven and driven and then, and the Aufseherin for whom Renia\nworked, she had that knapsack full of cigarettes, and she had her big cape and she had\nother things that she carried, and we all had a little bag with whatever. We had some\nsardines and some crackers, as I said before. And she says to Renia that it\u2019s hot and she\nwould like for her to carry the cape for her. So, Renia took the cape from her and threw it\nover her arm and we were just marching. And in the group that left Retzow was Helen \u2014\nHelena, and I don\u2019t know from where she was or we didn\u2019t know her for too long of a\ntime, but she was a tall, blonde woman named Helena, and she too had a big mouth, and\nshe spoke German very well. So, she saw Renia holding on to that cape. So, she made\nsure that we lagged behind a bit, and before we had a chance to look around, she had the\ncape over her camp clothes and she was hollering \u201cGet out, and get out of my way and\nget out of my way.\u201d And, she was pushing and pushing and pushing, pushing us towards\nthe woods, the small group of women. There was like a little forest, and because there\nwere civilians and there were the camp prisoners and there were the Germans who were\ntrying, some in uniform and some already in civilian clothes, there was such a\ncommotion, there was so much coming and going, you couldn\u2019t figure out what was\nhappening. But we wound up in the middle of the forest by night. So, we made a fire, a\nvery small fire so that it wasn\u2019t visible. We were very deep in the forest by then, and we \u2014\nI don\u2019t remember \u2014 to keep ourselves warm. How we opened the sardines I don\u2019t\nremember, but we had some of the sardines and in the morning, we got up and we\nwalked. By then, it was quiet already. We kind of wound up on the other side of the\nforest instead of near the road. And there was a huge, huge estate with a magnificent\nhome on top, and people were working in the field. And we came out of the forest and we\nsaw the people, so we figured well, if there are workers in the field, maybe they will help\nus in whatever way. Usually the fieldworkers were also either prisoners from a camp, but\nfrom the distance, we didn\u2019t know who they really were. And they noticed us and they\nsaw us with the tags with the numbers and everything. So, they came running and they\nasked where we are from, and there was a guy who was from Kielce, and Kielce was the\ncity to where Starachowice belonged; it was part of the district. And of course he says,\n\u201cNosha polachki!\u201d (ph) \u201cOur Polish girls,\u201d you know? So, when we heard that, we didn\u2019t\neven admit that we are not Polish, that we are Jewish, Jewish Poles, I mean, Polish Jews,\nand due to the fact that we already had our names changed, so we could pretend that. So,\nI was Krysia and Hania and Renia, and there must have been maybe twenty men and\nwomen working in the field, and this man from Kielce he was in charge of the working\ngroup, and he says, \u201cOh, did you come from camp? Poor girls, poor girls. You must have\nsuffered so much. Come with me to the house.\u201d And we went up to the house, and the\nhouse \u2014 the only person who was left in the house was the German woman who was in\ncharge of the operation, because the graph (ph) or whatever was down there \u2014 I mean, it\nwas a mansion. It was such a huge estate that it didn\u2019t belong just to a wealthy man. It\nbelonged to a very, very important, I would say, kind of individual. So, he comes in and\nbrings us and we are dirty and tired and I don\u2019t have to tell you what it\u2019s like being on the\nroad for so long. And he says to her, \u201cThese are my girls, and you make sure that they are\n\u2014 that they get clean and washed and prepare for them the best meal there is.\u201d An outright\norder from a person that was only a field worker, but because nobody was around and he\nsaw most likely what was happening, so that woman was very, very frightened. We were\nthree and there was a Russian girl and there was Helen and I think there were two more\ngirls, I don\u2019t remember exactly how many of us were in there. Now, I had a piece of soap\nto \u2014 and got into a bathtub with such fancy fittings and all that and a terrycloth towel to\nwipe myself, and then we were brought into the dining room, after we were all cleaned up\nand we walked around a little in the field. And the people who were working in the field\nwere not allowed to come into the house. It was off limits to them, but this man somehow\nfelt that now he\u2019s in charge because he was the head of the working crew and the owners\nwere not around and the whole place was empty with the exception of this one woman.\nSo then we come into the dining room and \u2014 this is funny, but you know how things\nchange from one to the next \u2014 so, here\u2019s that huge dining room with a banquet table with\nthe upholstered furniture and the heavy drapes, beautiful white drapes hanging from the\nhuge, huge windows. It\u2019s a beautiful estate, and that woman is so frightened and she\u2019s\nbringing bread sliced up and then she\u2019s bringing butter in, and the butter is laid out in\nlittle patties with the family crest. [Bursts out laughing. | I\u2019m laughing because it\u2019s\nridiculous. It seems like it\u2019s in the movies. With the crest of the family on the butter...\nAnd then she brings the food. I don\u2019t remember what we ate but what strikes me very\nfunny 1s here I am again in the dining room with her with a damask cloths on the table\nwith the fancy china and with the napkins and even the family crest on the butter, which\nwe did not have at home but the table was always set for eating in a proper manner. So,\nhere, in addition to what I remembered from home from a way back, was that butter\nwhich was cut in small pieces with the family crest on it. In my home we had a beautiful\nbutter dish with a cover. It was because the butter came in a block. So, it was a personal\ndish with the block of butter in it. It was either a block or an oval, depending on where\nyou bought it. If you bought it in the market fresh from the peasant, it was always like an\negg, a large egg-shaped thing they kept in leaves for it to stay cold, you know, when they\nbrought it from the village and it had a cover over it. So, that was kind of a remembrance\nof what it was last being at home and finding ourselves in this environment all over\nagain. And we were there for about four or five days, because we were liberated by the\nRussians, I mean, this area was liberated by the Russians. And the Russian officers came\nto check on the inventory, to take over as far as livestock is concerned and everything\nelse, and they found us and inasmuch as the officers. So, jabusky (ph) \u2014 immediately,\nthey wanted to make sure that we come to work for them. So, the man who was in charge\nof the working group came and said, \u201cWe are going to home and you are coming with us.\nWe are all going to make our way back to Poland.\u201d So, that was May \u2014 first week in May\nof 1945.",
        "Q: So, your first meal after the war starts, when you go back home, is a formal meal with\nwhatever you had, and then you end your experience in even more...?",
        "A: In Germany. The war experience, and then the journey home starts. Also, not an\nuneventful \u2014 a very eventful journey home.",
        "Q: We have to change the tapes.",
        "A: Don\u2019t tell me that [laughs].\nEnd of Tape #8\nTape #9",
        "Q: Chris, can you tell us who\u2019s in this picture?",
        "A: In the back row, from the left, is my Aunt Lodza (ph), who was my father\u2019s sister. She\nmarried a man during the war, and they both died \u2014 they were both taken to camps and\nkilled. Next to her, leaning on my father\u2019s shoulder, is Aunt Regina. She was a beautiful\nwoman. She was a wonderful, wonderful, full of verve and just an exciting person. She\nwas just beautiful. She too was married during the war, and she and her husband perished\nalso. There is my father who, when we were brought to Auschwitz, he was separated\nfrom us. He lived until the end of October, and the day he was taken \u2014 after his selection\n\u2014 to the gas chamber, we finally located him. Unfortunately, it was too late. Inasmuch as\nwe sent him the letter to him to let him know that we are alive. I guess that if he knew\nthat we were still around, maybe he would have had the strength to live through the war\nas well. That was October 1944 when we were already in Effektenkommer and we had the\nability to make contact with him. Then further down is my Aunt Rosha. She was the\nyoungest of my mother\u2019s sisters. Regina was also my mother\u2019s sister. Rosha was my\nmother\u2019s sister. She attended the university. She was a student of \u2014 she was a pharmacist\nwhen she graduated from college, and she too perished. Next to her is Dora who \u2014 the\ndark lady \u2014 who was my father\u2019s sister. She survived the war. She was in camp in\nPlaszow. She lived in Sosnowiec and went to Plaszow camp. Now, below here is my\nAunt Angia, who again is my mother\u2019s sister, and she was a single woman and she also\nperished in the war. Then comes my Grandma Sarah, who was widowed in the \u201830s, and\nthis is the mother of my mother, and she was a very intelligent woman, and a very\neducated woman, and when she married my grandpa, Leibush (ph) Tannenblum, she\nbecame very, very religious, and anything about religion that I know is because, in\nkatshrut (ph), in observances, is because she always wanted to know how much I know\nabout being Jewish and leading a Jewish life and she was always teaching me whenever I\nwas coming for a visit. And next to her is my sister Hania, who is sitting in my mother\u2019s\nlap, and Hania must have been a year, a little older maybe, my mother holding onto her.\nAnd, that\u2019s the family. So, as you see from the whole group, there is Dora on the extreme\nright in the standing row behind and Hania who is the baby. Everybody else perished.",
        "Q: And, this one?",
        "A: In this one is my father, Isaac Laks, and my mother, Pola Tannenblum Laks. It must have\nbeen at the very early stage, could have been at the time that they were engaged maybe or\nmaybe right after the wedding, but that was when they were very, very young. Even my\nmother\u2019s hair kind of tells me she could have still been a maiden at that time rather than a\nmarried woman.",
        "Q: And this picture?",
        "A: In this picture are the three girls, the three sisters, Hania is of course the tall one. She was\nalways very tall and very attractive, and she \u2014 that was in the wintertime, of course. It\nmust have been a Hanukkah present or something \u2014 a new sweater and a new hat and a\nnew scarf \u2014 and she refused to wear a coat; she wanted to wear the sweater. And then it\u2019s\nme. I\u2019m the one in the middle, and then it\u2019s Renia the youngest sister.",
        "Q: Can you tell us \u2014 do you know how old you each are there?",
        "A: Well, I would say somewhere around \u2014 I could have been ten, I guess. There is no date on\nit. That picture was sent to our Uncle Moish in the United States, and I don\u2019t have the\noriginal. My cousins made a copy for us, and they sent it to me. So, maybe the original\nhas some kind of inscription on it with a date, but this one doesn\u2019t have it. So, I\u2019m not\ncertain, but Renia is \u2014 I guess that Renia is about six. So, I am about ten \u2014 Renita is about\nsix and a half, and so I\u2019m ten and a half, and Hania is three years old.",
        "Q: And, this picture?",
        "A: This picture \u2014 this is the old house that we lived in, I would say, up to 1935 or 36 or\nsomething like that. And we moved out of this house to a new apartment because this was\nreally in a bad condition by then. I mean, inasmuch as it was very comfortable on the\noutside, but it needed a lot of work \u2014 comfortable on the inside, it needed a lot of work on\nthe outside. So, here\u2019s my father and my older sister Hania and my mother and then\nRenia and I. I think that picture was taken later than the three sisters, because we all seem\nto be much older here in it. \u00b036? I don\u2019t know, but anyhow it was still in the old house\nand I don\u2019t remember exactly when we moved. I know that we moved right before the\nwar. Three years, you know, you don\u2019t remember exactly which way it went.",
        "Q: Go ahead.",
        "A: This is Hania on the left side and I\u2019m on the right side, and we were reading something or\nwhatever. It must have been taken already during the war, either right before we went to\nthe ghetto or in the ghetto, but this 1s a war picture of the two of us.",
        "Q: Do you think you\u2019re thirteen or fourteen, something like that?",
        "A: No, I\u2019m older here.",
        "Q: Older?",
        "A: Right, I\u2019m older here. It\u2019s not 1939. It could be 1940, \u201941 maybe, but it\u2019s definitely not\nfrom before the war.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: This is in Buscostruitz (ph). It\u2019s a park where my mother was going every year, and the\ngate 1s to that beautiful park where the facilities where she was taking sulfur bags. She\nwas suffering from rheumatoid arthritis, and she\u2019s in black because this must have been\nthe year that her father passed away \u2014 my grandfather. She was with him when he died.\nHe died in her arms. She took him to Krakow to see a specialist, and they came back to\nthe hotel room and he just passed away in her arms. He asked her to be brought to the\nwindow for some fresh air and that was the end of Grandpa. So, she never forgot that\neither \u2014 the loss of her father. And I am with her, standing right there. Every once in a\nwhile, I went with my mother or went to visit Grandma. It all depended whose turn it was\nto come along with Mother. She always took one of us with her and the other two went to\nGrandma, because my aunts were just wonderful us. They loved when we came for a\nvisit.",
        "Q: Chris, this is what year? 1930?",
        "A: I\u2019m what here? Six years old, seven years old \u2014 I don\u2019t know. Is it 1930? If it\u2019s 1930, then\nI\u2019m six years old here.",
        "Q: Go ahead.",
        "A: This is my handsome husband, Miles Lerman and myself. This is the wedding picture.\nWe, of course, while I was not the bride in white, I was glad I had a blue dress, which\nwas pretty to get married in. It was right after the war. It was December 1945. We met.\nWe fell in love. We got married, and thank God, we are still together, and I hope for\nmany years. Now, we have a wonderful family to be proud of.\n[new picture shown]",
        "Q: This picture?",
        "A: We came to Poland on the fact-finding mission, and there was a group from the museum.\nAt the time it was no museum, just a council, and the members of the council were from\ndifferent walks of life, different groups, different religions. So, Miles came up with the\nidea that in order for them to know what the council is all about, it would be worthwhile\ngoing to Poland, and Eli Weisel was the chairman at the time, and Miles took the\nchairmanship of organizing that trip. So, we were in Poland visiting the places of\nannihilation and, due to the fact that one of the Paliszewski sisters was still alive and this\nis Maria Paliszewska, we took her with us. We went to visit her and we brought her with\nus to Warsaw. I just wanted to present her to the group, for her to meet the Americans\nwho came to visit Poland to learn about the terrible story of the Holocaust and to present\nher to the group in her kindness and her generosity and her understanding that she\nshowed her family. So, she went along with us everywhere we went, include Treblinka.\nShe insisted that she comes to Treblinka, because she, too, felt that she wants to visit the\nplace where Mother lost her life. Her mother was killed. So, her we are with Miles on the\nleft and then Mrs. Paliszewska is in the middle, and I\u2019m on the right, and the name of the\ncommunity 1s right on the big rock, it\u2019s like chiseled in the rock. It says \u201cStarachowice.\u201d\nAnd around you can see small rocks and bigger rocks and smaller rocks and each\nrepresents a community, a destroyed community.",
        "Q: What year was that?",
        "A: That was in 1979, when the council was \u2014 or \u201980 \u2014 I think it was. It was right in the\nbeginning of the formation of the council.\nEnd of Tape #9\nConclusion of Interview\n"

        "Q: Are you okay?",
        "Q: So, if we can go back to the ghetto now, for... If you can explain to people, because they\ndon\u2019t \u2014 there are different ways in which ghettos function, different ways people moved.\nWhen you have to move from your apartment that you were living underneath the gentile,\nthe Polish Catholic, were you forced to moved out and forced to move into a particular\nplace or did you choose the place?",
        "Q: Do you remember approximately what year the synagogue was burned?",
        "Q: It was 1939, right at the beginning.",
        "Q: So, let me go back to my question about the moving. When you moved from the house to\nthis more modern place...",
        "Q: Typhoid? Typhus or Typhoid?",
        "Q: Can I ask you something?",
        "Q: You were fifteen or sixteen years old taking care of your mother. That must have been\nreally frightening.",
        "Q: Who took care of you once that was over? Did anybody think about this happening?",
        "Q: You spoke a few minutes ago, prior to telling the story of the two sisters who could not\nwithstand what was going on, and you said people had no choices, but in some ways you\nreally describe choices. You chose to have a certain relationship to what was happening,\nor didn\u2019t you? It was that you chose not to be defeated in what was going on, in so far as\none could choose those kinds of things.",
        "Q: I don\u2019t know how long we have. I have a feeling that maybe we should stop here.",
        "Q: And go back when we meet again. Do you really want me to continue with the camera?",
        "Q: No, I think it\u2019s important...",
        "Q: ...that we continue and start again with the liquidation of the ghetto, especially given the\nstory you\u2019ve told about your sense of your mother and what you learned about what she\nsaid. We need to go back there and know what happened and what that break, which was\nreally significant for all of you, cause that really changed everything.",
        "Q: No, no, we won\u2019t do it now. I think that when we meet again, that\u2019s where we\u2019ll begin.\nThank you very much.",
        "Q: Good morning again, Chris. Welcome back to Washington.",
        "Q: What I'd like us to do is start with your \u2014 a few months before the liquidation of the\nghetto. Somebody had escaped from Treblinka and came back. Can you talk about what\nhappened?",
        "Q: Can I ask you something? Did your parents ask all three of you to leave, all three sisters\nor did Renia stay also?",
        "Q: Do you have any recollection that when your parents asked you to leave the house, you\nhad said to your parents we don\u2019t believe him. You knew something had happened\nbecause of how he was acting, because he was so strange, right? But given that they\nasked you to leave, do you have any recollection of when they asked you, you thought,\n\u201cWell, maybe this is really true\u2019? Did you talk to each other?",
        "Q: The day of the liquidation of the ghetto, do you remember what kind of a day it was?\nWas it cold? Was the sun shining?",
        "Q: Can I ask you something?",
        "Q: Because I think people \u2014 I think it would be very interesting for people to understand\nwhat it was like to try and find out what happened to your mother. Do you remember who\ntold you? Did your father tell you? Was your father the one who actually found out? Or\ndid all four of you...?",
        "Q: Because he wasn\u2019t there?",
        "Q: Did you get very depressed when you heard this? Did you get anguished? Did you...?",
        "Q: So, by that time, Treblinka meant something like what this person was telling you?",
        "Q: One of the reasons why I ask you that question 1s because, when people in ordinary\ncircumstances in normal life lose somebody, the time of the funeral and the mourning is a\ntime when \u2014 people need a certain kind of time. But 1n traumatic situations and in\nsituations like you were in, there is no time. So, there is no space.",
        "Q: Where did you eat? In the barracks, or...?",
        "Q: Can you give us some details what you had to do?",
        "Q: Did you feed them?",
        "Q: Chris, you were in some ways alone with your father. I mean, there were other people\naround with whom you were friends, but you indicated that your relationship with your\nfather changed somewhat in the context of that camp, that in some way you got closer to\nhim then you had before. Can you describe that relationship with how you understand\nwhat happened between you?",
        "Q: How many would get into the office? Was it a big office?",
        "Q: And, it was men and women. I mean, people came from the men\u2019s barracks.",
        "Q: For people who don\u2019t know the gypsy air, \u201cZigeunerweisen\u2019\u2019, could you just sing the first\ncouple of bars? You don\u2019t have to whistle it.",
        "Q: But you haven\u2019t learned to whistle it yet.",
        "Q: Do you remember, when you were sleeping, did you have bad dreams in Majowka?",
        "Q: You have bad dreams now about?",
        "Q: If you don\u2019t remember dreams, were you always tired in Majowka? Did you feel as if you\ngot rest?",
        "Q: Did it smell?",
        "Q: The people the barracks because people could not wash very much. Was that something\ndistinctive that you remember?",
        "Q: Noise in the barracks?",
        "Q: Besides this woman Fenia \u2014 Fania, rather, who was helpful to you, since you have contact\nwith your two sisters, did you see them?",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t.",
        "Q: But you were able to see them?",
        "Q: And you were separated from them for a year, two years?",
        "Q: That\u2019s Victor, right?",
        "Q: That\u2019s right, I reversed them. So, they \u2014 did they know each other in the camp?",
        "Q: Was that an organized breakout?",
        "Q: When your sisters came back, when Hania and Renta came back, were you living in the\nsame barrack, the three of you?",
        "Q: So, you were all put on a train. Were the men and women separated at that point? Your\nfather is in another part of the train?",
        "Q: And your father is about how old at this point, because you are what? Sixteen?\nSeventeen\u2019?",
        "Q: So, at this point, did you ...",
        "Q: Well, that\u2019s almost fifty.",
        "Q: Chris, underneath what you were experiencing \u2014 you know really terrible things are\nhappening \u2014 do you have any idea that there are other extermination camps, that people\nare being killed. You know in certain circumstances they get killed indiscriminately, in\nthe hospital if they\u2019re doing a selection or liquidating, but do you have any idea in your\nhead, or did you put that out?",
        "Q: You knew that?",
        "Q: Did you also have an idea where the Russians were? You mentioned a couple of minutes\nago that...",
        "Q: So, there was the uprising in the camp and clearly some kind of liquidation, and a group\nof you \u2014 about how many people were in Majowka that you can remember?",
        "Q: So, there were more men in the camp?",
        "Q: A significant difference, do you think?",
        "Q: How do you remember that day that you were put on the train to go to Auschwitz? You\ndon\u2019t know where you\u2019re going.",
        "Q: You saw that?",
        "Q: Do you think you actually would have taken it had you not \u2014 if your family wasn\u2019t there,\nif you had been alone?",
        "Q: Did you also get a number that you had to sew on to your uniform?",
        "Q: I\u2019m sorry, we have to interrupt because the tape is through. We have to go to the next\ntape.",
        "Q: Chris, when we stopped the tape the last \u2014 a few minutes ago, you were talking about\nyour sister who had gotten a short hair cut, and then had looked in the mirror and the SS\nofficer grabbed her and said, \u201cReally cut her hair.\u201d",
        "Q: Shave it. So, she was shaved then?",
        "Q: Can I interrupt for a minute? When your hair was shaved, was your bodily hair shaved\nalso or only your head?",
        "Q: Can I interrupt for a minute? The sauna, was it a big room, a small room, were there were\na lot of people?",
        "Q: Were you in a separate barrack?",
        "Q: So, the entire barrack was a quarantine barrack?",
        "Q: And does that mean you had to stay in the barrack all the time?",
        "Q: A latrine?",
        "Q: With that distribution of food, did you all decide we\u2019ll each take on sip until it\u2019s all\nthrough?",
        "Q: So you talked amongst each other?",
        "Q: Let me go back to Auschwitz for just a moment. You so often express a very powerful\ndrive to live when you describe who you were then. Were the three of you, since this was\nthe center of your lives, I\u2019m sure each of you had other friends or people that you knew,\nbut I\u2019m assuming that this is closest, that group.",
        "Q: Were you all sharing equally in that hope, or did one of you get less hopeful and the other\none pull them out? Do you have any recollection how you operated emotionally together?",
        "Q: You would not describe the three of you as having a leader in some way \u2014 that one of you\nwas more...",
        "Q: Did she have to go to the infirmary?",
        "Q: The day \u2014 I can\u2019t remember was it you and Hania who were going to the new job \u2014 and\nRenia was behind, right? The Block Alteste, who you described as an extremely brutal\nterrible woman, or am I wrong? Was it only the assistant?",
        "Q: Okay, let\u2019s change the tape.",
        "Q: Before we say more about after the death march to Ravensbrick and your experiences up\nuntil liberation, Chris, explain what the Effektenkammer was, this new job that the three\nof you had. You \u2014 the last time, you talked about how important it was for you, what it\ndid in terms of changing your self-image, and feelings of self-esteem with the people you\nwere working for. I also want to know whether you understood the place of that work\nkommando in the structure of Auschwitz, how Auschwitz was being organized, or did\nyou simply know the structure of that particular kommando?",
        "Q: But, it must have been very complicated because, if you are only having the property of\ninmates who are there, and they get them back when they leave, so whoever in the\nunderground or the resistance in Auschwitz wants to get information out, they have to\nknow who\u2019s leaving.",
        "Q: Do you remember you and your friend being told by a particular person to put this letter\ninto this purse?",
        "Q: Do you know who it was?",

        "Q: She was the head of the Effektenkammer, or she was...\u201d",
        "Q: Were there ever selections in the Effektenkammer?",
        "Q: So you very quickly felt safe?",
        "Q: Did you ever \u2014 a woman by the name of Katya Songer ever come into your\nEffektenkammer? She was head of the camp offices.",
        "Q: Or a woman names Tsip1?",
        "Q: Did you ever hear the camp orchestra?",
        "Q: Did that anger you, bother you, was it good music? Do you remember anything?",

        "Q: You just keep going. Or you don\u2019t.",

        "A: Good morning, Joan.",
        "A: I was born in Starachowice, Poland, March 5\", 1926. My Hebrew name was Rachel. My\ngiven name on the birth certificate reads Rozalia Laks. I also was known as Rozka or\nRosha Laks, and during the war, when we were brought from the Auschwitz camp to\nRavensbrick, I had decided that it would be easier to survive with an assumed Christian\nname, and due to the fact that no records have followed our departure from Auschwitz,\nwhen we were on the death march, once we arrived at the table where they registered the\nnew transports, we changed our names to a Christian name \u2014 last name and first name in\nmy case, the name Gorska \u2014 I assumed the name Krystyna for it to be a real Christian\nname.",
        "A: Many names.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: We were growing up 1n a small town, population about 35-40,000, and it was \u2014 I would\nsay that the Jewish population amounted to approximately ten percent, no more, due to\nthe fact that there were large factories in the city, in the town, which were government \u2014\nbelonged to the government, and the people who were employed in those factories \u2014 they\nwere manufacturing ammunitions, and also they had foundries and iron ore mines \u2014\nPeople who were employed in the factories were mostly Christian people, gentile people.\nJews were involved in predominately business and they were artisans and craftsmen, and\nthis was more or less the composition of the town. The town \u2014 the Jewish population in\ntown was very well organized. We had a lot of different organizations. And I as a child\ncould only get more or less from the conversation that I overheard at home, you know,\nabout my parents being involved in the community going to different meetings. They\nwere predominately involved with Zionist organizations. They were not orthodox or\nreligious people, but they were traditional Jews. My parents had a kosher home and I\nwould say that we observed the main holidays. I don\u2019t think that my father was going to\nsynagogue every day. I know he didn\u2019t. And as far as we were concerned, as youngsters,\nas soon as we were old enough, we too joined Zionist youth groups because this was sort\nof saying the whole idea that eventually we will all make our way to Palestine. As far as\nmy parents are concerned, they were very active in the community \u2014 Mother in particular,\nmore so, because Father was a lot away from home. Father\u2019s involvement in the\ncommunity never was as involved as was my mother\u2019s. He was what they call \u2014 I don\u2019t\nknow the name, there is no equivalent in the English language \u2014 but it is Brakaz. What\nthis \u2014 what he has \u2014 what he did, he was evaluating... How to say it? Actually he was an\nappraiser of large tracts of forest because he was representing a very large international\ncompanies that supplied timber to German companies and British companies. They used\nthe timber for support in mines. So, he was working for a company like this, and before\nthe companies went into the negotiation of the purchase of the timber, they had to have\nan idea more or less of what \u2014 how many trees they are, what it will yield, and so forth,\nbecause they had to pay tremendous amounts of money. So, my father\u2019s job was to travel\nto the forests and, in most cases, with the assistant of the forester, they went into the\nwoods and he was estimating, more or less, you know, how many trees there are on the\ntract, how thick they are, what the yield would be, and when he was coming home from\nthe trip, he used to sit and prepare specifications, and on the basis of his specifications,\nthe companies went into the negotiations for the purchase. So, he wasn\u2019t that much\naround because usually once he went away, it was like three to four, sometimes five\nweeks before he\u2019d return home, and when he\u2019d return home he used to sit, you know, for\nhours and hours and hours in his study preparing, you know, the specifications. So,\nMother was certainly in charge of the household and the children and seeing to our\ncomfort and overseeing our activities and education and she was a wonderful woman, and\nreally, as far as forming the character, it was Mother\u2019s responsibility. And, to her,\neducation was very, very important. So, outside of the fact that she was very involved\nwith community and the Zionist organization, she formed the WIZO in Starachowice.\nShe was the first president in the WIZO organization. She was a member of regional and\nthe national \u2014 no, what\u2019s the word I want to use? \u2014 she was a member of the\nregional...uh...",
        "A: ... Office, and she also formed for young unmarried women, the young WIZO in town.\nSo, every once in a while, you know, when I wanted to know a little bit more about my\nparents immediately after the war, I used to turn to those people who \u2014 the generation\nbetween my parents and my self that could tell me a little bit more about who my parents\nwere. Because basically, you know, to a child a parent is a parent. You don\u2019t think of\nthem as individuals. You just think of them as parents, and they\u2019re there to take care of\nyou and provide for you and make you comfortable whenever it\u2019s necessary. So, with the\nconversation \u2014 in conversations with those people, I found out a lot about my parents and\nespecially from women who were like eight, ten years older then myself who were, you\nknow, already teenagers or a little older who told me how wonderful my mother was and\nhow energetic she was and how inspiring she was in, some would say, in bringing the\nZionist idea and inspiring people and so forth and so on.",
        "A: Well...",
        "A: No, Father was a disciplinarian. He was the head of the family, a typical European head\nof the family. He was a disciplinarian and a no-nonsense man. And he was outgoing and\nhe was very nice, but still in all, you know, when he spent time with us, I would say that,\nif you were to compare with present days, you would say it was more quality time rather\nthan otherwise. And, Father was \u2014 had a beautiful singing voice. He was, he was born in\nSilesia, which at the time when he was born, it was German occupied part of Poland that\nwas occupied by Germany. So, I would say at the turn of the century, 1900, that was, his\n\u2014 his world was Vienna, 1900. So, the music, you know, by Strauss and Mahler and\nLehar \u2014 that was his world. He loved music. He had a beautiful singing voice. So, when\nwe get together, I remember how we used to \u2014 first of all, the taste for classical music I\ngot from my father \u2014 and we have been listening to his singing, and we sang along with\nhim. I mean, even in German, because his education was a German education. So, he\nspoke more, as far as foreign languages, he used more German then any other language.\nAnd so, he sang along with us, and he was teaching us voices in order to sing in different\nvoices so that we could sing in harmony. And, no matter where we went afterwards,\nwhen we were in a crowd, they knew that the three of us could sing in harmony. So, we\nwere always asked to sing any song, you know, and because we have learned what it\ntakes to sing in harmony, we could ourselves, later on, adapt to certain levels, whereby\nwe could create, even though not knowing whether we are doing it right or wrong, we\ncould sing in harmony one way or another, you know, in different voices. So, this was\nvery interesting. But, Father\u2019s culture, basically, the culture of experience, was more\nGerman. As a matter of fact, he had a study with a huge mahogany desk, and behind the\ndesk was like a secretary behind glass doors. He was a very neat man, very neat, very\nelegant gentleman. I\u2019m sorry I don\u2019t have the picture right now here. And, he used to\nhave everything placed all orderly including the huge German encyclopedia. I remember\nwhen I went to high school and I took German as the second language, he used to say to\nme, \u201cIf you ever need to use the encyclopedia, you are welcome to it, but don\u2019t bend the\npages, and please make sure that everything is placed back where it belongs.\u201d So, you\nknow, this is the kind of a person he was. He was a very orderly person with whom, you\nknow, things had to be always right. But I really developed a very close relationship with\nmy father after we had been taken to camp, when we lost our mother, because it just\nhappened so that we had been working together, and we had access to one another. It was\nthe slave labor camp in Starachowice, where we were not separated all the time and we\ncould have meals together and so forth and so on. It was at that time that I really realized\nwhat a caring and loving person he was, and inasmuch as he didn\u2019t have maybe the\npatience when we were little to be with us. This was the bonding sort of time when I\nreally felt how important he was in our lives, and how important we were in his life. So,\nthese are more or less, you know, the way I would think of my parents.",
        "A: Mother was, I would say, the extreme opposite of my father. She was \u2014 first of all, she\nwas more of a people\u2019s person. She loved to be with people. She was the person who\norganized all social events. She was the person who was entertaining. She was the person\nwho welcomed everybody in the house, regardless of who they were. Poor, I remember\ndays when the local people who were destitute were coming to my mother asking for\nassistance, not only Jews but gentiles. It 1s a family \u2014 there was a family, I mean, nobody\nis alive anymore \u2014 a Christian family that came to settle in Starachowice at the time when\nthe revolution in Russia broke out. They used to live in Belarus, if I remember correctly,\nand they came to our town. They happened to be living in the same courtyard, you know,\nhow Europeans cities where it wasn\u2019t individual homes, but it was like one house and\nthere was a courtyard and in the courtyard were other houses and people lived all around.\nAnd, they were intelligent, very nice, wonderful people, parents and four women who\nwere more or less the age of my parents, a little younger. And Mother got to like them.\nAnd it was very difficult for them to get, some would say, accustomed. to go to town and\nto make a living and so forth and so on. So, Mother has encouraged them to open a, like,\na kinder care. I was three years old when I was already in that pre-nursery, nursery\nwhatever you call it, with my sister, you know, my older sister, and of course, Mother\nhad seen to it that other \u2014 that friends of hers would send their children. So, it gave them\nimmediately a little bit, kind of a source of income in addition to the father who was, he\nwas not a doctor, he was a medic, that Mr. Paliszewski. He was working as a medic in the\nRussian Army, I think, or whatever. He was so knowledgeable about medicine that\neventually when the hospital opened in our town, he was an accredited practitioner in the\nhospital without being a doctor. So, this tells you something, but you know it takes time\nfor any newcomer. So, my mother was doing all these things, and by the way, the\nPaliszewski family the most wonderful family to us. I mean, for us, they were a home\naway from home all the time. And I\u2019m skipping things, but I must tell you that after the\nwar, when I came back to my home town, if it wasn\u2019t for them, I would have been killed\nthe day I arrived back. But this is another story. So, I cherished the friendship that my\nparents had with the Paliszewski family. So, here we are, we were talking about my\nmother, what she was doing. So, she was trying to assist destitute people. She was trying\nto help people who were coming to the community to kind of get settled and start a new\nlife. She was, during the war \u2014 she was instrumental in creating the Hebrew school to\nwhich we went, a Hebrew Day School. My first four years of formal schooling were not\nin the public school system, but they were in the Hebrew schools, in the Hebrew school.\nEverything in that school was in Hebrew \u2014 math, geography \u2014 everything they taught us\nwas in Hebrew. I mean, we were learning Polish as well, but Polish was a language \u2014\nPolish history and Polish was taught in Polish. Everything else was taught in Hebrew.\nNow, I want you to know that in our home, we never spoke Yiddish, which was a\nlanguage that was used in everybody\u2019s house. My parents both were educated. They\nspoke four languages fluently \u2014 Polish, and German, and Russian, because Father was\neducated in German schools, Mother was educated in Russian schools, and Yiddish, of\ncourse, they spoke fluently. Sometimes they spoke Yiddish so that if they wanted to say\nsomething we shouldn\u2019t understand. Mother comes from a family that was, I would say,\nvery educated due to the fact that even my grandma, I remember Grandma Sara, had a\nhigh school diploma, and I want you to know that in those days, nobody considered an\neducation for a woman necessary. She had thirteen children, mind you. Nine survived;\nfour died either in childbirth or whatever it was. That was \u2014 she married \u2014 she comes\nfrom a family of bankers, Fefers, from Ostoriwiec and she married a man who was come\nfrom Sandomierz. He was in the printing business. So, again, in order to be in the printing\nbusiness, you had to be very literate, because otherwise you could not run a successful\nprinting business. That was my mother\u2019s side of the family. All my aunts are \u2014 graduated\nfrom high school. The youngest one went to the university and she became a pharmacist,\nand she worked, I think it was the year before the war; it was her first year of\nemployment. She was the youngest, you know, and that was her first year of employment\nand she was somewhere near Bialystok, and we never found out what happened to her.\nWe thought that maybe, because she was so close to the territory that it was eventually\noccupied by the Russians \u2014 you know, in 1939, when Poland was divided between the\nGerman occupants and the Russian occupants \u2014 but we couldn\u2019t find her. So, out of the\nfamily of nine on my mother\u2019s side, there was a set of three sisters, first. They all had\nchildren. My mother is the last one from the first set of three girls. They have children\nwho have married with children already. Like my oldest aunt had two sons who had been\nmarried before the war, and they already had little babies. One of them had two, and one\nof them had one, while the youngest sister was just graduated from the university. And in\nthe middle were three brothers who at the time of the Russian revolution made their way\nto the United States and Canada. So, there were the first three women in the family, then\nthere were the three men in the family, and there were the three youngest girls, sisters of\nmy mother\u2019s, in the family, who were still single. One of them got married right \u2014 I\nwould say during the war, maybe in 1940s, and I don\u2019t remember whether she had a\nfamily or not. I just can\u2019t recall that, and this is it. So, I was very fortunate to have some\nmembers of my mother\u2019s family here in the United States and in Canada that, at least,\nyou know, makes you feel good that there 1s somebody around who can tell you who you\nare, when you were, and what was life like for them when they were around. Another\ninteresting thing about my parents, if you want to know, is I mentioned to you before that\nthey were very instrumental, always trying to assist other people. I remember, you know,\nwhoever, as I said before, whoever knocked on the door, they were always, always more\nthan willing to help, but beggars came around, you know, they used to give me like a coin\nand said, \u201cGo out and give it to them.\u201d They were never asked to come in. And there\nwere many people who were coming begging, you know, in those days. But then in 1937\nmaybe \u00b038, I was a little older, there was \u2014 I could see new faces that were coming in and\nthey spoke German, and when my parents \u2014 my parents used to say that if they are not\nhome and there is somebody who is coming in and doesn\u2019t speak Polish but speaks\nGerman, be sure to ask them to come in. Those were the German Jews who were being\nso-called \u201cresettled\u201d from the German territories. And they, when they were coming to\nthe different communities in Poland, and they just happened to be come to our town, to\nStarachowice, due to the fact that Father was, spoke German so well and could\ncommunicate with them and understand their needs and Mother was so being having all\nthese contacts and connections being so, so to say, as they say in America, a Macher, you\nknow, trying to be of assistance to others, that I could see, you know, how they really\nspent a lot of time in order to assist them. And I didn\u2019t understand that much at the time\nyet, but somebody knocked on the door and they used to say in German \u201c/s Herr Laks zu\nHause?\u201d And J used to run to mom and say, \u201cMommy, a Deutsche Jude 1s there.\u201d You\nknow, I remember, I did it once and Mother said, \u201cI don\u2019t want you to talk like this.\u201d If\nanybody\u2019s asking about dad or about me, open the door and ask them in. You know, you\nare a child, you don\u2019t know what to do. You don\u2019t know how to behave. So, what they\ndid for the people, in what way they assisted them, I don\u2019t know, but the mere fact that I\nhad observed that those people were welcome in our home and that my parents cared to\nlisten to them, I\u2019m sure that they have done something to make their life easier.",
        "A: Well, let me tell you about this aspect of the family. From the pictures that I have seen in\nthe albums, from the early childhood, I think that we were quite comfortable because the\npictures were from different resorts, areas like the Baltic Sea, you know, and from the\nmountains, the Bezkidy, and there was a spa in Busko Zdroj that my mother was going,\nand we always had either the maid or a nanny that came along, you know, to take care of\nus. But at the time of the depression, when America, you know, after the crash and when\nEurope was attracted by the American depression, which was 1933 or whatever, I don\u2019t\nremember in Poland at the time, Father\u2019s services were not needed anymore due to the\nfact that neither Germany nor England could afford to come and purchase timber in\nPoland because they themselves, you know, they had to make do with whatever they had,\nand utilize what they had. You know, it was a very, very difficult time. So, I remember\nFather was looking, I mean, he had to support the family. He stopped going away from\nhome and he was around home base. So, I remember he had a job with the same company\nthat he was representing before, but here, too, he had to be channeled into a different\naspect of the operation of the lumber company, and there was only part-time work for\nhim. So, he also assumed a kind of a half, semi-position with a credit company because\nwe lived in, as I said before, in an industrial area, and people were buying things on\ncredit, you know. So, let\u2019s say if somebody wanted to buy an item which was expensive,\nand I\u2019m not talking about thousands of zlotys, but whatever, but they needed a coat or a\nnew suit, and whatever. You know, he couldn\u2019t walk into the store and buy it. So, the\nman who was on the job in the factories, in the munitions factories, used to go to the store\nand establish a credit and he was paying so much a month, a week, I have no idea. But\nFather was doing the research in order to give them the credit reference. So, that was\nanother thing. But we were growing up and we had to go to school, and my older sister in\nparticular was about ready for high school, and that was an expensive thing. So, my\nmother decided to learn a trade. We had, I mean, things were difficult, so we subletted a\nroom, and we subletted a room in our house to a woman who was a corset maker. And\nthe woman said to my mother, after she was half a year in town, she says, \u201cYou know\nwhat? You have such connections.\u201d You know because she was trying to assist her, \u201cYou\nhave such great connections, and I\u2019m a single woman, and I don\u2019t think I like to stay here\nfor too long.\u201d She says, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you learn it? And why don\u2019t you run a corset shop?\u201d\nSo, of course, Mother figured she\u2019s there, so she might as well learn. Mother didn\u2019t know\nhow to use a Sewing machine or anything like this. I remember, in the beginning, she\nused to cry because the wheel was turning the other way around instead of forward. But\nshe has learned and, of course, with all her connections in the community, you know, the\nnon-Jewish and the Jewish population, she developed a wonderful business. She was\nreally, and you know she had the respect of everybody, and therefore, so you know that\nwas another source of income for us, which was easier. And then in 1937, finally, Father\ngot back on his feet, and he became a representative of a wholesaler from abroad. I don\u2019t\nknow. One company I think was in Lithuania that was sending different cheeses, so it\nwas importing different cheeses from Lithuania, and canned fish either from Denmark or\nHolland, I don\u2019t know. So, he had these two franchises that kind of brought him back on\nhis feet and things were looking up, and we were growing up and ready for school and...",
        "A: No, we didn\u2019t have \u2014 yeah, it was always a capella. We never had a piano. As a matter of\nfact, you know, Mother had a very good voice, too, but 1t was Father who really loved it,\nand as a matter of fact, my uncle from the United States who was the next to follow my\nmother and, Uncle Moish, and in the family of the nine children, they were the two\nclosest siblings. So, when Uncle Moish, when I met him, he always was telling me how\nUncle Moish played the banjo and sang. So, he used to tell me how they used to get\ntogether and they used to form like the little theater and perform for people in the\ncommunity, you know, get together and they had other people, you know, who were like\nthemselves kind of artistic and with good singing voices and everything. So, Uncle Moish\nwas telling, filling me on those little things that were at home as far as singing 1s\nconcerned. So, they all had this, this musical ear. In our family, my son, who is\nresembling my dad very, very much, is the one who has a good voice. Miles has a terrible\nvoice, and Jeanette is just like him. They are always off-key. They love to sing, but they\nare always off-key.",
        "A: I do sing, yes, but of course, it\u2019s not \u2014 it\u2019s not the same voice. I used to have the voice of\nsoprano, you know, and very high, and I really sing very, very well without any particular\nvoice training or anything like this, but I love to sing. I remember when we used to get\ntogether, always, the parents used to say, \u201cLet\u2019s sing.\u201d And all the pop songs and the\nnational songs and Hebrew songs, when we were traveling with the children in the United\nStates on long trips, to kind of keep them busy, keep them occupied, so they wouldn\u2019t\nfight with one another in the back seat, we used to engage them in singing, you know,\nand we had a very favorite Hebrew song, \u201cYalda Yafa\u201d\u2019, because you could also sing it in\nthe harmony, you know, different ways, and I thought that this is going to make them\nkind of involved, more involved than otherwise. So, they used to get very upset when\nMiles started because Miles never, I mean he loved to sing, and he knew the song just as\nwell. You know \u201cYalda Yafa\u201d, means a pretty girl in Hebrew, and they loved the song.\nWe all loved the song, but if I started we could continue to vocalize and sing in harmony.\nWhen Miles started, no way. They still talk about it the trips, you know, to Canada,\nwhich took like 13, 14 hours before you got from Vineland to Toronto, about the long\ntrips and how dad used to sing \u201cYalda Yafa\u201d",
        "A: Close to four.",
        "A: I was born at the beginning of the year, and she was born at the end of the year.",
        "A: But, I was born in March, beginning of March, and she was born middle of December.",
        "A: She was born two years before me, in January.",
        "A: Well, if she needed errands, you know, and if she didn\u2019t want, she was too busy to do\nwhat she was supposed to do, like take care of uniform, you know. We went to school in\nuniform regardless whether we were in elementary school or in high school. In\nelementary school, we used to wear like a smock, which was, we called it an apron, you\nknow, with a little white collar, and for it to be fresh we used to change \u2014 like a Peter Pan\naround, kind of \u2014 for it to be nice and fresh we used to put everyday a fresh collar, you\nknow, lots and lots of collar in a drawer that were always washed and starched. It was a\nmatter of pasting it to the collar. My sister she wouldn\u2019t do it. She used to pin it, and it\nwas always crooked. So, she used to have me do those things for her. Like, she was too\nbusy with homework and she was too busy with her so to say, involvement with school\nand she read books. She read constantly, constantly. I mean, have developed a liking for\nbooks and for reading, especially classics, because of her due to the fact that I was the\nyounger one. She was the older one. So, of course, I couldn\u2019t read the same books at the\nsame time as she did, but when she was coming home from high school and some of her\nfriends came along for a visit, and they were sitting around and talking, discussing books,\nI used to be so envious that I didn\u2019t know anything about it. So, of course, I was reaching\nout. How much I have gotten out of the reading at the time, like okay, let me give you a\nbook like Les Mis\u00e9rables. I could understand that because it was about \u2014 from the\nhistorical point of view, I could understand. The social nuances of the book, I don\u2019t think\nthat I understood then as much as I can understand now. Now, if they were, let\u2019s say, if\nthey were discussing The Bauhaus, Ibsen, it was beyond me. And, I took it, and I looked\nit, and I read it for the fact that I wanted to get acquainted with it, but with how much I\nhad gotten, I don\u2019t remember. I still read Anna Karenina and Tolstoy, you know, and\nsome of it I have gotten. When I sat and listened to the conversations, it kind of made a\nlittle more sense. My problem was that I did not read the book before the discussions. I\nhad read the book after the discussions. So, therefore, I could only apply just so much\nwhat I overheard and no more. I mean, and don\u2019t forget that it\u2019s not like right now, I\nwould open a book and it would be quite clear to me, you know? Basically those days\nwere \u2014 what interested me was the story and the people involved and the plot. But, in\nbetween the lines, how much I have seen there, I don\u2019t think I did.",
        "A: No. No. She only had friends... She wasn\u2019t \u2014 you see, when she was ready to go to high\nschool, there was no high school in our town. So, she had to go out of town to a larger\ncity, to Radom. There were private schools in Radom, and there was like a federal school\nin Radom. That was the Gymnasium Chalubinskiego was the number one school in\nRadom. And in order to get into that school, you had to be a very excellent student. So,\nwhen she came \u2014 and they were accepting I don\u2019t remember 25 or 30 students annually \u2014\nthe school was predominately for local people from the city, and it was a non-Jewish\nschool. So, the number of Jews was limited. You had to go through an exam, entrance\nexam, regardless of how good a student you were, you still had to have an entrance exam,\nentry exam? Whatever. So, when Mother brought her for the exam in Radom, Mother\nwas nervous, not my sister, because Mother knew that she\u2019s not going to pass it. Not only\nbeing from out of town, but being Jewish, there is no place where she can take her. So,\nthat was like in June, early June and the results were like...",
        "A: 1937, no 1935. She six grades of elementary school \u2014 somewhere around there. So,\nMother took her for the exam, and a few weeks later were the results, and the school was\nclosed already, so what they had is they had like a blackboard on which they posted all\nthe people who had been accepted, not alphabetically, but on the basis of how they scored\nin the exam, and my sister was number five, and accepted. Do you realize that\nachievement? Now, that was very difficult times for us. That was the time when \u2014 she\nmust have gone in 1935 because I was in high school already in \u201937. When she went to\nschool, financially, my parents weren\u2019t doing so well, and tuition was expensive. Not\nonly that she was accepted to school, but she received a scholarship, a 50 percent\nreduction in tuition. So, she was really brilliant, and I love her, she\u2019s so special, she\u2019s so\nspecial. She\u2019s having health problems now, unfortunately, and she lost her husband. So,\nit\u2019s difficult for her, very, very difficult. But, she\u2019s a very special person, and I always\ntried to emulate her, always. I mean, she stood there and she was reciting poetry. I mean,\nshe was, she was just a very unusual girl. As I told you, she was my role model. I was \u2014 if\nI thought of myself trying to do whatever, whatever she did, I always thought that I\u2019m a\nklutz, I don\u2019t come near her.",
        "A: No. No, different, because I didn\u2019t want to have anything to do with my little sister, not\neven use her for anything. She was too young. You know, there was \u2014 here it was like the\ndifference in age was two years. There, it\u2019s almost four, and you know, we were little\nkids, and she kind of \u2014 I felt that she belongs with the sissies. I wanted to be what my\nother sister was. So, we kind of treated her like the baby in the family, you know. To play\nwith her, play games and do things, you know, whenever she wants. She always had such\na curiosity for things. Renia was an unbelievable person. When it came to learning about\nany little thing, nothing missed her ear or eye. And also the one thing about Renia was,\nwhen she heard a new expression, she put it to use immediately. We used to laugh at her\nbecause sometimes she couldn\u2019t say it properly. So, she used the word, but it was kind of,\nthe word that she wanted to use, she kind of changed it around. I don\u2019t mean by changing\nit around, it\u2019s like, let\u2019s say, a child would say instead of a napkin, they would say\n\u201cnapik\u201d or whatever, you know, this kind of a thing. They will leave out one syllable or\nwhatever because, you know, it\u2019s either difficult for them to say it, or 1s 1t because they\ndidn\u2019t hear the exact thing. But every word that was new to her, she used it immediately.\nWhat was the word that we used to make so much fun of her? I can\u2019t remember right\nnow. It may come back to me. It was a \u2014 it had to do with intellect, and the way she used\nit was very, very funny. I just don\u2019t remember right now. I should\u2019ve asked her.",
        "A: We were a very close-knit family. Even as much as Father was away, but when he was\naround, as I said, he was a typical head of the family. He cared, he provided for the\nfamily, he did things with the family. But I would say that now that I am a parent and I\nam a grandparent and I can observe how people behave at certain stages in their life, that\nI can see that with the exception of the present generation, where both parents are on jobs\nand are away from home, where both parents are involved in the actual running of the\nhousehold. In the olden days, the father was not too involved with the children. Maybe if\nwe had boys in the family, it would have been different. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know. I\nmay be wrong. I may be right. You know, maybe there would be a different tie. As a\nmatter of a fact, I didn\u2019t mention it to you, but my parents had four children. The first\nborn was a boy, and he was a very bright boy. He was four years old when my father\nwent on a trip to the East, I mean to \u2014 you know, for the job, how you say on his duties\non the job, and he took sick, and Mother received a telegram that Father was sick and\nhe\u2019s in the hospital. So, she left the maid with the baby and she told the maid to take the\nbaby, get on the train and go to my grandmother\u2019s \u2014 Grandmother lived only 30\nkilometers away. So, the maid \u2014 1t was wintertime and the maid dressed the baby up and\nwhatever and it was hot on the train and cold outside. What happened, I don\u2019t know, but\nthe baby got pneumonia and a week later my mother got a telegram to come immediately\nback from my grandma, and by the time she got back the baby was dead. He was the first\nborn who before even my oldest sister was born. So, I could remember seeing in my\nmother\u2019s purse either fresh grass or wilted grass which must have been from the grave\nevery time she went to the cemetery, but she always used to carry a little bit of something\nin her purse. His name was Juziu, Jusef was his name. So, now you are asking me about\ncloseness with Father. I don\u2019t know. Remarkable, another thing that\u2019s rather remarkable\nis that Mother used to say to us when we asked her about him \u2014 we were children so we\nwere curious because there was a picture of a little boy, very pretty boy \u2014 I\u2019m so sorry\nthat I don\u2019t have a picture of him. Little sailor collar, little white shirt and all that. And\nshe used to tell us and then she says that during the First World War I think he was born.\nNo, if my sister was born in \u201924, he must have died in \u201923 or \u201922. It was still wartime.\nAnd Mother was with him on a train and he was asking all kinds of questions. He saw the\npeople in uniform and the buttons and the hats and all that, and she used to \u2014 he used to\nask all the questions, and there was a woman sitting on the opposite of my mother and\nshe looked at the little boy and she says to my mother, \u201cThat boy\u2019s not going to live too\nlong. He\u2019s too smart.\u201d And, you know, Mother repeated to us when we were a little older\nand we started to ask more and more questions. It must have been tragic for her. I mean,\nshe didn\u2019t want to dwell on it, I\u2019m sure, because she had the responsibility to her family\nand it was a very \u2014 it must have been a very painful and sad experience for her to go\nthrough with this. So, this is the answer. You know, God giveth and God taketh away,\nand you never know when.",
        "A: Okay.\nEnd of Tape #1\nTape #2",
        "A: The only \u2014 the first time really that that I was aware of something happening was when\nthe German Jews were arriving, and when they came to our town and, as they were\ncoming every once in a while to our house to visit with my parents, who were trying to\nassist them. So, the reference that I had made before as to always referring to the people\nas the Deutsche Juden, because in the community the Jews of the community used to\nrefer to the newcomers, to the new Jews from Germany, as the Deutsche Juden, to\ndistinguish between the local Jewish population and the Jews that were coming to town.\nAnd, of course, their plight which was kind of obvious because I could see the extent of\nmy parents\u2019 involvement, but at the same time, this was happening in Germany and\nGermany, in the mind of the young person, is very far away. So, there is no immediate\ndanger inasmuch as to my parents, I\u2019m sure that they could see the whole picture in a\ndifferent way. To us, we were still at home, we were still at school, we were secure in our\nenvironment, and therefore, we didn\u2019t pay much attention, and it has never been\ndiscussed. I\u2019m sure that my parents inasmuch as they could have known or not, would not\nbring it up at all. We were, I feel, maybe \u2014 I\u2019m sure we were too young to comprehend it,\nand it was no use of burdening us with additional fears, because you live in a world\nwhere antisemitism was quite prevalent and we had enough to deal with the hooligans in\ntown who used to call us \u201cdirty Jews\u201d and throw rocks at you on occasion whenever they\ncould, you know, and I was accepted. I mean, my friends that I went to school with used\nto refer to me \u201ctheyeste shenasha\u201d (ph), as if to say \u201cYou are ours, our own\u201d so to Say,\nbecause I was just like them. You know, I spoke the language in the same manner, and\nwe Started together and we worked together on school projects and all that, but\nnevertheless, on the way to school, we had to pass by the area where the factories were,\nand they were kind of closed in by a very big fence all around, and for about, I would say,\none kilometer, there were no homes but just that huge, huge, huge fence. And on that\nfence there were \u2014 they used whitewash, they called that thing? \u2014 all kinds of sign, anti-\nSemitic signs. For example, they said, \u201cBe zyd\u201d (ph) \u2014 not to kill the Jews, but hit the\nJew, or there was a sign \u201cZyd to Pijawka\u201d \u2014 the Jew 1s a leach, or they used to say, \u201cZydy\ndo Palestyny\u201d \u2014 Jew, go to Palestine. And, you know, it wasn\u2019t pleasant. I don\u2019t know\nwho has put, you know, all that stuff on the fences, but they were never removed. They\nwere there all the time. But if you live in this type of environment and you expect to see it\nall the time, you know, on the way to school and on the way home from school, it kind of\n\u2014 you don\u2019t pay any attention anymore to it. So...",
        "A: No, they never commented, and we didn\u2019t even talk about it. But you know it was an\naggravating kind of a thing, that a twelve year old one or a thirteen year old one, you\nknow, we wouldn\u2019t \u2014 it\u2019s \u2014 let me put it this way, that I could understand it better my\nmother\u2019s desire to plan the eventual immigration to Palestine based on this kind of a\nsituation. This is why she insisted that we learn Hebrew, and this is why she insisted to\ninstill in us the Zionist idea and this is why she was helpful in creating a Zionist youth\nmovement, and we joined, and, you know, we didn\u2019t have leaders in the community, so\nthey used to bring leaders from larger towns who were coming once a month to kind of\ngive us a definite direction more so from a contemporary point of view rather then be\nlead by some adult. And, but you felt it, you felt it, and there is \u2014 there were little\nincidents that were kind of always there. And, I remember walking with my father. Father\ncame and the railroad station wasn\u2019t far from our home. It was like a five minute\ndistance, you know? So, I used to \u2014 knowing that Father was coming, I used to run to the\nstation to kind of welcome him and walk home with him. And one time, there was \u2014 it\nwas during the time of the depression, and the Polish workers were very unhappy because\nthey went on strike, they weren\u2019t paid well enough, and it was a very bad situation in\ntown. And every time something like that occurred, there was a much stronger anti-\nSemitic reaction because it was \u2014 somebody had to be blamed for things that went wrong.\nSo, I remember, as we went approaching the main entrance to our courtyard, there was a\nguy that we knew well and Father knew well, and he was standing there and he was\ngiving out leaflets and he was repeating \u201cBe zyda, be zyda\u201d (ph) \u2014 hit the Jew, hit the\nJew. And as we came close, I\u2019Il never forget that, he took the leaflets in his hand and put\nthem behind his back, and he already uttered the word \u201cBe zyda\u201d (ph) and he says\n\u2018\u201cEkonomiczie\u201d, aS we were crossing, he says, \u201cEkonomiczie.\u201d As if to say, not outright\nhit the Jew, but hit the Jew economically, which was more of a legitimized way to say it\nfor my father not to get offended, but he had expressed it. And...",
        "A: Well, I was ten years old. You know, I could understand it.",
        "A: This was a \u2014 no, it was a plan that I\u2019m sure that they thought a lot about it. And maybe if\nat the time, they would have been in a better financial situation, maybe they would have\ndone something about it, but due to the fact that up until 1937, as I mentioned to you\nbefore, things were difficult between \u201933 and \u201937, four years, you know, that you can\nonly plan on the things that are needed rather than the long term for the future, and then\nof course the war broke out so, solved all the problems.",
        "A: Okay, my mother was Pola, her maiden name was Tannenblum, and she was from\nOstrowiec, was Isaac, or Isaac in English, Laks. He was from Sosnowiec, which 1s in the\nPolish Slask or Silesia as it is now in the German language. They met, I don\u2019t know\nexactly when, but they had a very happy life. They really had a very happy life, and we\nhad a very warm and happy, loving family.",
        "A: Well, my school friends were one group, and my other friends were another group. Due\nto the fact that I lived in Wierzbnik, which was basically the community where the Jews\nlived before the consolidation of the two. Very early, there was a community called\nWierzbnik and there was a community called Starachowice. Wierzbnik was so to say the\nearlier where all Jews lived and some of the non-Jews who even were involved with the\nbusiness or in city administration or in jobs, you know, but most people who worked in\nthe factories lived in Starachowice. As a matter of fact, in Starachowice they had two\nstreets, two main streets. One street was named Ulica Robotnieza, which means the street\nfor the blue-collar clerks, and the other one was Ulica Urzednicza, which was the street\nfor the white-collar clerks, and as you passed the streets, you could see the difference in\nthe living quarters and they were not too far apart, side by side, but in order to bring in\nthe skilled engineers and the technicians that were needed in the factories, they had to\ngive them something more than just the average housing. While the workers, you know,\ndue to the fact that we were like three or four kilometers away from the factories, they\nsettled closer to the factories so that they didn\u2019t have to travel that long of a distance. So,\nnow, when they consolidated the two communities, we became one, and it was called\nStarachowice. Wierzbnik was where the Jews lived. Starachowice was \u2014 the school, when\nI went to high school, was Starachowice. And this is when I had to pass from home all\nthe way, you know, three kilometers each way, and as we were getting closer and closer\nto school, more and more children joined the group, you know, because there was one\nroute that we use, you know. So, actually, we were three \u2014 in my class, there were three\nJews, four Jews, three boys, myself and another girl and in the class above me was\nanother Jewish girl. School opened the first two classes of high school at the time when I\nwas ready to go to school. And in this my mother, too, had her finger. She was also very\nhelpful in convincing the community that it\u2019s about time that the population of 40,000,\nwhich was right before the war, should have a school of higher education, not to have to\nsend the children away from home. So, she organized a group, you know, and they\ndiscussed it long enough, and it took two years before the school was finally opened and\nit was just in time for me. So, now, I have these friends from Hebrew school that are my\nold friends, from Wierzbnik, with whom I feel very, very comfortable, then I have my\nfriends from high school who do not live in Wierzbnik, very few. Most of them are living\nnear the factories because their parents are working there, and our connections are more\nbased on our school work. You know, every once in a while in addition to homework you\nhave projects that you have to work together on, whatever it was, whether it was in math\nor whether it was in social studies, or whatever. One of us got an assignment, who was in\ncharge, and we had to kind of a create a nucleus, a group of people who were responsible\nfor different things and we kind of made a presentation when, let\u2019s say, a commission\ncame from Warsaw from the National Board of Education to see the progress that we are\nmaking. Usually, they had come for accreditation and, you know, to evaluate the level of\neducation in the schools, and we had a very wonderful school. We had a really great high\nschool. So, I had friends from there with whom after school I had hardly contact, but it\u2019s\ninteresting that, when I went to school, things were not so good yet at home, and I had to\nenter \u2014 I mean, as I said before, any high school that you applied to you had to have an\nexam. So, I came out, I mean, very well on my exam. I was accepted to school. I was also\ngiven a 50 percent reduction in the tuition, but my tuition was twice as high as my sister\u2019s\nbecause hers was a federal school, and mine was a private school. But I was very\nfortunate that the teachers and the director of the school liked me a lot, and they\nrecommended to me for tutoring younger children. So, I went to school, and from school\nusually the kids were the kids of the white-collar clerks in Starachowice who were just\nabout ready to go to high school and they needed the preparatory exam and so, I was the\none who was spending like an hour twice a week tutoring them, preparing them for the\nexam, and I was getting paid for it. So, this in a way defrayed the cost of my education.\nSo, it was really interesting because on the one hand I was very secure and very accepted\nand comfortable, but if you were to say whether I was really seeking outright to be in\ntheir company, no, and for this reason, I don\u2019t know whether I would have been very\ncomfortable or I would have been uncomfortable, but I was well liked and respected. I\nam felt that I am very \u2014I mean, with the school friends, I had never felt any anti-Semitic\nthings directed at me personally. To the contrary, we were very, very friendly.",
        "A: It was very strange because we were for the new school year. And in addition to being a\nmember of a Zionist youth group, I was a member of a kind of a scout group. It was more\nthan a scout group. It was kind of a patriotic Polish group. I don\u2019t remember even the\nname, that when you entered high school, you were kind of elevated to a position of\nresponsibility, where you had to show your love for the country and responsibility, so\nforth and so on. So, being already in high school, I was a member of this particular group,\nand I loved Poland. I mean, to me, Poland was my country. I mean, I was a great patriot. I\nwas \u2014 to me, if you would think in terms of how much do you love the country, I mean,\nto feel really good and comfortable, I really loved Poland. Everything, Polish literature\nand whatever was Polish was the best thing in the world. There was nothing better. I\nreally enjoyed it. So, I remember that rather than to \u2014 like, a week earlier, before school\nstarted. We were called to come to school, and I can\u2019t recall who was the person who has\naddressed as members of this particular youth group, and they said to us \u2014 usually we\nwore the uniforms during May Day parades, you know, and we represented, carrying the\nflag of our school, and marched in the parade. So, they told us that we have to put on the\nuniforms and we have to gather not far from the factories because we have to dig trenches\nfor protection from attacks that may come from airplanes, that there may be a war and\nthere is a danger of being bombed due to the fact that we have these factories and that it\nis our duty of young people who love the country to do it. So, you know, I was so eager,\nyou know. We all went to the place where they gave us the spades and we walk along\nwith adults and we built the trenches and all that. Of course, they didn\u2019t drop the bombs\non our town. They just threw two bombs on the railroad station. They whole town, the\nwhole community left for the woods. Everybody was afraid that they\u20191l bomb us to\nsmithereens, and then I get, after the war, a Kalendarium, what they\u2019re called, from my\nhometown because I wanted to know more of what it was all about, you know. I went\nfrom childhood to adulthood and left the country. So, in the Kalendarium, I found out\nthat the chief executive officer of the factory that was appointed or whatever, placed \u2014\nwho has gotten this position three years before the war, was a German, a spy, who not\nonly spied for the Germans to let them know what is the operation like in this particular \u2014\nbecause that was a whole region, not just Starachowice. There was Skarzysko-Kamienna;\nthere was Radon; there was Pionki. They used to call it the central industrial area. So, we\nwere just one part of that whole region, and we found out this particular guy was a\nGerman who was maybe a Volks Deutsch, you know? But basically he was operating\nwith Germany, and he told them that to destroy that would be ridiculous. They needed it\nfor their war effort. So, I found out about it, you know, like in 1980, ten years ago, when\nI was finally established a very comfortable contact with my hometown, because I just\ndidn\u2019t want to think about Poland, you know? I came to the United States and what the\nUnited States represents cannot compare with any country in the world, and for this\nreason I kind of felt that don\u2019t forget the past, but don\u2019t live in the past. Whether it was\ngood or whether it was bad, it just doesn\u2019t make any difference, the past is the past, and\nfor as long as you live you have to look towards \u2014 deal with the present and look toward\nthe future. That\u2019s all to it.",
        "A: We all went, we all went into the woods, the forest, you know? And we could hear the\ntroops fighting, and we could hear the airplanes zooming by and bombs being dropped,\nbut we were like about eight kilometers from town, you know, in the woods, and when\neverything calmed down and it was quiet, we returned to town. So, we returned to town\nto find the situation like that. All the stores were looted. There was no food available.\nHomes were plundered. Whatever was, whatever was of value was taken away. Whether\nit was done by the Germans or whether it was done by the Polish neighbors, I don\u2019t\nknow, but that was the situation. I remember carrying the silver in a knapsack on my back\nto the woods and back, because Mother gave everybody something else to carry that was\nimportant. And we came back to home and our home, since we lived \u2014 by then we had\nmoved to a modern apartment, because the home where I grew up was an old home, and\nthe landlord didn\u2019t want to do much anymore in the repairing it and so forth and so on.\nSo, we moved to another apartment that was built like \u201937, and it was built by a Christian,\nby a Pole, Wierzchowski, and he occupied the upper floor, and we were living on the\nground floor, and so it wasn\u2019t really a Jewish courtyard anymore, you know, it was kind\nof a mix. There were some stores. I remember there was a Polish butcher who lived\nnearby in a small house, and I can\u2019t recollect because it was a short period of time that we\nlived there. So, due to the fact that we were not in a Jewish kind of \u2014 because some\ncourtyards, they had 20, 30 families, and mostly Jewish, you know, so if the homes were\nplundered, you know who did it. But here, due to the fact there weren\u2019t too many, and so,\nwe found everything in perfect order when I got home. So, there was nothing really that\nwas broken or removed or glass broken. I\u2019m sure that they wouldn\u2019t have dared, you\nknow? So... Because it was not a Jewish house. It was the property of a Pole, so they\ncouldn\u2019t break windows in order to get in or whatever. And so it was hard because there\nwas no food available and things were difficult to get.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Well, we came back, and of course, when we were out in the woods, you know, we didn\u2019t\nhave much food. We took some bread with us and maybe a salami if I remember\ncorrectly, but we couldn\u2019t get any food. So, it was September and we were very close.\nWe actually stayed in an agricultural school. Basically, it was a school, and also a kind of\na laboratory, research laboratory where they were trying to introduce, you know, new\nways of maybe growing things. So, there were a lot of cucumbers and a lot of tomatoes in\nthe field, which I imagine that they had been gathered and sold at the market normally,\nbut the war broke out and the students didn\u2019t come to school, so everything was left there.\nSo, we ate them. You know, you sit in the dirt and you ate and you don\u2019t have water to\nwash your hands and so forth and so on. We got back home, and we had some potatoes\nleft in the dark cellar because this is where you kept your roots for the winter, your root\nvegetables for the winter, and Mother went to the dark cellar and she brought up potatoes\nand Father says to set the table. So, we were kind of figuring on why does he insist on\nsetting the table. He says, \u201cI want the tablecloths on the table. I want the china on table.\u201d\nHe says, \u201cI want the silverware on the table, and the napkins and lace because, just\nbecause there is a war doesn\u2019t mean that we have to eat like animals. We have to\nremember that we are people and we have to conduct ourselves in this manner.\u201d And,\nthat\u2019s the kind of person that he was. That no matter what kind of a situation you\nencountered, first you have to always remember that you are a human being and you have\nto watch the way \u2014 you have to be aware of how you conduct yourself, and your behavior\nand there was always the priority, stressed on the importance of being civil and acting in\nproper manner, no matter what. So, we had our meal: that dry potato on a big plate. But\neverybody was happy. Father was happy. We washed the dishes afterwards. Everything\nwas fine.",
        "A: No, but that\u2019s the way it always has been. I mean, there was no kitchen table. The kitchen\nwas a working place, and in the kitchen, we had a huge table, but it was a table that had\nlike sides all around that was used like a work space where they were kneading the bread\nand cutting up the meat and doing all kinds of things, and you know, and baking and\ncooking and washing laundry and everything. That was what the kitchen was for. The\ndining room was where we ate, and it was this mahogany big table with the carved legs\nand the carved chairs around it, and whether it was breakfast or lunch or dinner, I mean,\nwe didn\u2019t eat in the same manner as we do in the United States. You know, breakfast was\nfast because we all had to go to school, and Mother packed a little lunch to take along,\nand dinner was usually when we returned from school. That was the main meal around\ntwo-thirty, and then in the evening was just a small bite for supper, you know. So, it was\njust a sandwich with cheese or whatever, but the main meal was always during the day.\nAnd, it wasn\u2019t like here in the United States when you have meat or fish every day for\nyour meal. I mean, a lot of times you make do with whatever was available, and mind\nyou, it\u2019s not availability depended not so much on how money you had, but on the\nseasons. If, let\u2019s say, there was at one time, there was one product in abundance, let\u2019s say,\nand then the summer there are other products in abundance, and 1n the fall different\nthings, and you kind of geared your whole planning around what was available in the\nparticular season. So, I remember, like, Cornish hens, young chickens, we used to have in\nthe summer, and the geese and ducks were in the fall and the winter, and then for springs\nthere were turkeys, I mean, but they were not every day on the table. We used to have\nlike maybe twice, three times a week meat. Otherwise, it was dairy products and you had\nto be very, very kind of inventive in order to create meals and my mother was a gourmet\ncook and she really \u2014 when she entertained, it was unbelievable. When she set that table,\nit was fit for a king. I have this craze now \u2014 I have four sets of dishes and with stemware\nand with everything and different tablecloths because I have to \u2014 when I set the table it\nhas to be \u2014 it has to have a very special touch. It\u2019s not just what\u2019s sitting there in the\ncloset, I?ll make an effort. Pll go to the back. Ill pull them out to set a certain mood. I\ndon\u2019t do it as much lately because the kids are older, I mean, our children are older. They\nare out of the house. And Renia is like that, too, you know. And my daughter is like this,\ntoo, now, very much aware of what the table should be like, regardless of the meal. But,\nto make an attractive table all by itself makes the whole meal so much more pleasant.\nWhether you eat a dry potato or whether you have a gourmet meal, it doesn\u2019t matter, but\nit is when you enter the dining room, what you create artistically about the looks\nenhances the food you eat like that, too.",
        "A: Not really. I loved bread up until now \u2014 bread is my most favorite thing, but not really,\nnot really. I mean, when we were young, we didn\u2019t need food, and when we were in\ncamp, we didn\u2019t get food. So, however, speaking of food, while we are on the subject, I\nremember that when we finally were making our way home after the liberation, I turned\nto my older sister Hania, and I said, \u201cWhenever I have the opportunity to cook a soup.\u201d\nThe soups in camp were hardly \u2014 I mean, you couldn\u2019t call it soup because it was water\nwith some on the bottom, and some floating potato peels may be in it\nat the most. So, I used to say, \u201cWhen I cook a soup, it\u2019s going to be thick that when I put\na spoon into it, it will stand all on its own.\u201d That was my dream. And, Hania said to me, I\nremember what she said, she said, \u201cAnd I\u2019m going and I would like to have a whole loaf\nof bread and not to have to share it with anyone.\u201d",
        "A: Oh, I cook great soups. Bean and barley is the most favorite because it\u2019s the thickest. The\nspoon doesn\u2019t stand up on its own. It doesn\u2019t stand on its own, it needs support, but it\u2019s\ngood.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember. I don\u2019t remember, but you know, we felt so secure with our parents\naround us. You know, we never had to worry or plan our future. You know? We were in\na home where the parents supervised our activities. I mean, they planned our schooling,\nthey planned where we go to school, and we were very obedient children because we\nknew that whatever our parents are planning for us, for our future, that they know what\nthey want and what we should be like from their own personal experience. And it\u2019s not\njust, you know, in some cases, where there were a lot of people that were totally illiterate\nbefore the war. There were people whose literacy was very limited. Some people had two\nyears of education, three years of education. They felt the need of education. They didn\u2019t\nhave the opportunity. Therefore they wanted to give their children the opportunity to\nknow more then they did. And the compulsory years of study in school, in elementary\nschools in Poland, was kindergarten through seventh grade. After seventh grade, you had\nenough. It could carry you through life, you know, and you were literate and you could\nread the paper, and you knew math and you knew everything. But if you went to high\nschool, then you were only in school for six years. And, it is like the junior high schools\nhere, that was your first year of high school education, because we went from six years of\nelementary schools to four years of high school and then two years of Litsonian (ph)\nwhich prepared you for the study at the university. So, if you think in terms of years of\nschooling, it was like 12 years from beginning to end, from grade one to entering the\nuniversity, if you so desired. So, in my parents case, you know they were both educated,\nand education was very important to them and there was no question. I mean, there was\nno question whether we want or we don\u2019t want. It\u2019s like, you get up in the morning and\nyou have to brush your teeth and wash your face and have breakfast, and so you have to\nstudy, that\u2019s it. That\u2019s part of your daily activity.",
        "A: Things start changing as soon as we see the action of the Nazi military in town. In the\nbeginning, you know, when the marched into town, nothing happened. Nobody greeted\nthem with flowers, that\u2019s for sure.",
        "A: No, because you see in areas where they had \u2014 since the borders were constantly shifting.\nSo, whether or not, you know, after the plebiscite, this is the right word in English, as\nwell?",
        "A: Plebiscite, thank you. Depending on where you lived, you know, once the border was\ndrawn, whether you originally German or originally Polish, wherever you lived, you\nbecame the citizens of this particular country. So, since the borders had been shifting\nconstantly, there were a lot of German families who, after the First World War, after the\npact in Versailles, were separated from their families and so forth and so on, and\nremained on the new Polish territories. So, some of them spoke Polish because in their\nfamilies there were Poles and there were Germans and Poles and Germans, and they were\nintermarried so it didn\u2019t really matter that much. But, in some cases, the people felt very\nstrong attachment to Germany, and they con-, inasmuch as they did in Poland, and they\nsend the children to Polish schools, they considered themselves Germans. So, when the\nGermans entered Poland, of course, they were more then happy to welcome them because\nthis is what they always wanted. We lived in central Poland, so we were far removed\nfrom both influences, the Russians and the Germans and even the Austrians from the\nsouth; because we were part of that heart of Poland that Napoleon has created in a way,\nthat Kongrasuvka (ph) that he called. So, this 1s why they came, the Germans came,\nmarched through town and sang the songs and all that, with victorious people, came. And\nit took about two or three weeks before they had organized the whole thing. And they\nstarted to catch Jews in the street to do work. Actually, not so much for work as to\nhumiliate the Jew. So, I remember, I was walking with my father in the street, and he was\nan elegant man, as I said before, and always proper and always neat, always neat, and he\nwas wearing a hat and a suit and we walking on the sidewalk, and a German walks by\nfrom the opposite direction, and he says, \u201cYou\u2019re a Jew! You have no right to walk on\nthe sidewalk. The sidewalks are not meant for the Jews.\u201d And, he pushed him.\nUnexpectedly \u2014 I mean when somebody attacks you like that \u2014 and he pushed him in the\ngutter. Really, he fell into the gutter and he was wearing glasses, and his hat fell off. He\nwas wearing a hat not because he was religious, but that was part of that elegance of his\nkind of a demeanor. And his glasses fell and he felt so horrible, so humiliated, and the\nguy kicked him over and over again, and he wanted to pick himself up. I remember, he\nspoke, no, he was asked him, \u201cBist du ein Jude?\u201d - Are you a Jew? And he said, \u201cYes!\u201d\nAnd since my father had a lot of dealings with German people, I mean, at the time he had\nbusiness contacts. Before the war, he was representing an international company and the\npeople at the time he dealt were also business people from also large companies. So,\nthere has never been in my father\u2019s, I imagine, mind a disrespect for him being a Jew.\nAnd just from the soldier walking and at the mere fact that he was honest and said he was\na Jew, to be pushed off the sidewalk into the gutter and to be kicked when he tried to pick\nhimself up, and his glasses broke, and he was bruised on his face, and he got all dirty and\neverything, that was the first indication. I mean, this is for the first time that I understood\nwhat the war was all about. Up until that time, I don\u2019t think I could comprehend what war\nreally means because the stories that I have heard from either my parents or my grandma\nabout wars before, like the First World War, they had experienced, was basically\ncontained in the area in which they \u2014 through which the front went through. Fifty\nkilometers away from the front, life has not been disturbed in any way whatsoever. Only,\nif you happen to find yourself in the path of marching troops or battles or whatever, that\nyou knew that there was a war. But, in that Blitzkrieg that the Nazis created, there was no\nsuch thing as so to say limiting to one specific area or having battles in one area. They\njust went through the whole country - within one week, there was no Polish government\nanymore, and immediately the Nazi occupation took over.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember exactly. I didn\u2019t remember whether I ran home and left my father to tell\nmy mother maybe. You know, it is something that I only remember how hurt he was\nwhen he came in. I don\u2019t remember, maybe, I think that I was with him. But anyhow, I\nremember how distraught he was when he came home from being treated in such a\nmanner. He could speak with them and converse, you know, and I am sure that he would\nhave expected to kind of say something. But with a soldier that carries a gun in his hand\nand beats you and kicks you, I mean, there isn\u2019t much you can do. So, that was his first\nhumiliation, and I think that this was an experience that made me aware that times have\nchanged or are just about to change.",
        "A: I really don\u2019t remember. I just know that Father was so bruised and so beaten and he had\nbroken glasses, you know. He was wearing eyeglasses, that there wasn\u2019t anything to ask\nabout. I\u2019m sure that everybody realized what that situation was like. Of course, we didn\u2019t\ngo out in the street anymore, and the Judenrat was formed, and they came around and\nconfiscated valuable things from everybody\u2019s home.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember. I don\u2019t remember. I don\u2019t think so. We lived already in the new\napartment, and Father had a desk. We didn\u2019t have this extra room for him. So, Father\u2019s\ndesk was placed in the living room, and I think that \u2014 I don\u2019t remember what ever\nhappened to the books.",
        "A: I remember Germans came in and looked around, and of course, you know, everybody\nwas aware that they are coming and asking for things. They were elegant. They were not\njust soldiers who were coming; they were officers who were coming to different homes.\nAnd they used to look around and if they liked something, they just asked to be wrapped.\nI remember a friend of mine used to say - he came in and he saw that \u00e9pini\u00e9re on the\ntable, and he says to my mother, \u201cOh, das ist schoen. Bitte mir das einpacken,\u201d as if to\nsay, \u201cThis is beautiful. Please wrap it for me.\u201d You know? So, this is one of the sayings\nthat I remember from confiscating things. Again, I think that due to the fact that we were\nnot really \u2014 the second, the new apartment that we were in, since it has not been\nnecessarily an all-together Jewish courtyard, that I don\u2019t remember the Germans coming,\nreally coming in. But what I remember from the second apartment that we lived is the\nwar Started, there was no school for Jewish children, none whatsoever. We were all\nschool age. And again, I\u2019m going to bring in my parents, you don\u2019t leave children\nhanging around doing nothing. So, again, my mother\u2019s ingenuity, she says, \u201cListen, it\u2019s\nwar. You cannot go to school. This does not mean that you\u2019re going to sit idle.\u201d Hania is\nolder than you. In 1940, we already had a lot of Jews from large and from Lodz and from\nPoznan (ph), you know, from the regions that were incorporated into the Reich. And from\nthe large cities, people were displaced and were brought to our town with children who\nwere our contemporaries, and they were educated people, and they were sophisticated\npeople. So, my mother, in order for me to not to kind of be my sister\u2019s student, where she\nwould kind of do whatever she wants with me, maybe, has gotten three other youngsters\nwho were my contemporaries, and my older sister was teaching us every day as if we\nwere to go to a regular school, okay? When I was done with my classes \u2014 they were in the\nafternoon \u2014 in the morning, I was teaching younger children. And here we have in the\nnew apartment, we already had a small kitchen table. So, while my older sister was with\nsome student in the living room, I was sitting on the window, I remember, on the ledge. It\nwas summertime. It was so nice and warm in the forties, and I loved the sun \u2014 and I had\naround the table these little kids who I taught to read and taught to write. And it was that\nthing that we continued, you know, to keep ourselves busy, number one, to continue with\nour educations, number two, and even Renia used to play with the little kids. These were\nnot even of school age, but just to give her something to do. So, we had this kind of a\nfeeling of responsibility to ourselves, and to others as well. So, it was all the kids in the\nneighborhood and mostly children of our friends younger then us.",
        "A: Yes, that\u2019s what I said. Because Hania was teaching Renita in the morning \u2014 when I was\nteaching my class, Hania was teaching in the morning, but I was her student. And, in the\nafternoon, because some of the boys who were coming to class were working, I think \u2014\nyou know, there was an obligatory labor that you had to submit to every day. I mean, if\nyou were called, not every day, but there were all kinds of jobs that required on the part\nof the German Nazi administration that needed to be done, and the boys who were at the\ntime 15 or 16, instead of having their fathers go and do the job, they went to work. So, we\nwould really study later on in the afternoon when they came back from work.\nEnd of Tape #2\nTape #3",
        "A: No, we went very little. First of all, we were very busy. I mean, Mother saw to it that we\nwere kept busy, and constructive busy, which was very important. But, we used to get\ntogether with friends, you know, and since our ghetto was not closed ghetto, 1t was an\nopen ghetto, it means that part of the town where there was a large concentration of Jews\nwas, got to be a little more crowded with the fact that there were newcomers coming\nthrough from territories that were incorporated in the Reich, and also the few who lived\nnot really in Jewish sections were forced to move out and to move into the designated\nghetto area, and this is what happened to us in the \u201940s. We left everything behind in the\napartment because we just \u2014 instead of having a three-bedroom, three-bedroom \u2014 a four-\nroom apartment, we move into a one-room apartment. It was large enough, you know, for\nus to put beds at one end and tables, and a table at the other. We kind of had some space;\nwe were not crowded. But we still had Polish people living near us, you know. So, some\nsections of town were completely eliminated from Jews, but other sections with Jews and\nnon-Jews lived together. Of course, the more people were coming in, the more we were\ncrowded, and we had to kind of accept another family to live with us. And when you live\nwith a family and you are limited to the space and you lose some privacy, it\u2019s all right\nwhen you were only with your own family. But when another family comes in that you\ndon\u2019t know, that is totally strange, whose living habits are different from yours, and who\nare uprooted and who are strange, and it had this problem with adjustment. No matter\nhow hospitable you are, you still have to have a certain amount of privacy, and this\ncoexistence with strangers was a very difficult thing to overcome. Oh, it was okay. And\nthen we find an apartment which was the last apartment before the ghetto was liquidated,\nwhich was a house on the border of \u2014 almost out of town \u2014 which was the borderline, but\nthe end of the ghetto. And there was a property and this property was kind of a duplex. It\nwas on the river. It was a duplex, and in one part of the house was the owner, who was\nPolish, on the side of the non-ghetto side, and this was kind of still considered to be part\nof the ghetto. So, in this house, we had a bedroom and a kitchen, and we didn\u2019t have\nanybody to live with us because he wouldn\u2019t allow \u2014 the Polish owner would not allow\nany more than just one family. So, in a way, this gave us, you know, again, a better\nfeeling of a family unit, you know, that we had a little more privacy. But, we were\ngathering with our friends. Some of them had on the outskirts, like, I had a friend who\nwent to school with me and they also were in the lumber business that was established by\ntheir grandfather. They were well-to-do people, and we used to go. They had the river,\nand they were, you know \u2014 because they needed the water for the processing of wood,\nthey were \u2014 like Bentwood for chairs, you know, this was their business. So, it was really\nwonderful. It was secluded, and they had like a little beach area. So, this 1s where we\nused to go Saturdays, and just sit around and talk and have time, you know, with our\nfriends to ourselves. And, Saturdays usually was a quite time, you know, and Sundays,\ntoo. So, her parents were very, very religious. So, she liked to be with us. We had this\nfreedom. We used to sit on the beach and enjoy the sunshine and talk, and everybody was\ndoing something important. I remember one friend was a terrific knitter. She could knit\nanything in the world, and she used to sit and knit sweaters, you know, and this is the\nway how she was supporting herself during the war because I think she lost her mother.\nHer father was in Israel. They were supposed to go to Israel, and I don\u2019t know how it\ncame about, but she was alone and she lived, so to say, with the cousins, and she was\nsitting always and knitting, and this is how she used to support herself. She used to make\nthe most beautiful hand-knitted sweaters and everything. But, those days you don\u2019t have\nno yarn. So, you used to rip apart old scarves, and old sweaters, and caps and whatever,\nand make a new garment and you have to be a genius to match the colors, to come up\nwith an interesting product, which she always did. She was wonderful. And we used to\nspend time, and that was our free time, you know. Again, it was always in the company\nof the friends with who I went to Hebrew school and who were my, so to say, also\nmembers of the Zionist youth group and we were recollecting, you know, reminiscing the\nwonderful days that we had. We had a leader in the youth group. At first, we had a group\nwhen we were very young; we belonged to Hano\u2019ar Ha\u2019t Zioni. That was the Zionist\nchildren\u2019s group. And then, when we got a little bit older, there was a kind of another\nbranch of the same organization, but 1t was more on an intellectual level, and it was\ncalled Akiba and Akiba used to be, I mean, we didn\u2019t have anyone in town who could\nreally supervise us at this level. So, Krakow was the center or Akiba, and they were\nsending to us leaders who were coming once a week to spend time with, once a month,\nI\u2019m sorry \u2014 to spend time and teach us songs and lecture and discuss Hebrew writers and\nHachman Bialik and all those things. So, we \u2014 I remember one leader who was with us in\n1939 and her name was Vushka Liebeskind and she was, during the war, she married\nDolek Liebeskind, who was the head of the resistance movement in Krakow. So, to us\nshe was everything in the world. We couldn\u2019t wait long enough for her, you know, from\none month to the other to come. And mind you that in Auschwitz, she found us. She was\nin prison too. And what she has done to our spirit in one hour, in Auschwitz, when we\nwere really \u2014 it was Yom Kippur. We were \u2014 we arrived in July and we lost completely\ntrack of time, and I don\u2019t know whether the holidays fell in September or October, but\nsomewhere around there. I don\u2019t remember exactly. She has been in prison since 1943,\nand because she was the kind of a person she was, and had outside contacts due to the\nfact that they were part of the resistance movement in Krakow, that she had connections\nwhich allowed her to kind of move around the camp a lot freer, let\u2019s say, than a person\nwithout connections. And I understand now that she was the one who put the emphasis in\nthe spiritual aspect of that survival in concentration camp, and from what I heard about\nher was that she was finding little pieces of candles that were \u2014 you know, in the\nbeginning, there was no electricity in camp, so they used candles, or whenever they were\nnot allowed to use electricity and they still needed in the barracks a light, you know, for\nthe work, for the administrative work, they had the candles. So, when the candle was\nalmost at the end, you know, it was discarded. So, from what I understand, she used to\ncollect the pieces of candles and bring them to people on Friday night, right before the\nLagerruhe, you know, before people were not allowed to leave the barracks. And she\nused to say the blessings and people \u2014 it did not make to her any difference which\nbarracks she went to, wherever there were women \u2014 and that\u2019s what she did. And we\nwere already, so to say, with a noose around our necks, in such a bad situation, because it\nwas already three months that we already arrived in Birkenau, and you know, that it was,\nso to say, a point where we didn\u2019t say any chance for survival or anything. And I\nremember we came from the ward, and a very pretty woman with a striped uniform and a\nkerchief around her hair, you know, her hair was cropped short. She was not \u2014 her head\nwas not shaved like ours, but she had this and she had very good shoes on her feet, and I\nthought, \u201cWell, you have to be well connected to kind of look this way when you were in\ncamp.\u201d And she started to ask around. It was after the Zahlappel, after we had been\ncounted. Sometimes we had like half an hour before we were allowed to the barracks, or\nsometimes we were immediately forced to go into the barracks, and she says, \u201cAre any\ngirls her from Starachowice?\u201d So, there were five or six of us that were members of the\nyouth movement, and she told us who she was. Of course, we were unrecognizable at the\ntime. I mean, from hunger and from beating and from the condition that we were and the\nclothes that we wore, we all looked like skeletons already and ridiculous really. So, she\nsays, \u201cGirls, don\u2019t worry.\u201d She says, \u201cI\u2019m going to visit you again,\u201d and she says, \u201cIt\u2019s\nlate now. I must run to the barracks before they catch me after the allowed time to be\noutside.\u201d\u2019 And, then she came. And it was the eve of Yom Kippur, Kol Nidre night. And\nshe came with candles, and she got up on the bunk bed and the candles were lit, and\nnobody knew Kol Nidre by heart. I mean, we were \u2014 how could we remember? We\nremembered the chanting, just the melody. So, we were chanting the Kol Nidre melody,\nand it was kind of an outpour of a feeling for unity, because it was something that we had\nin common from not from this period in Auschwitz, but from another time. And, of\ncourse, we couldn\u2019t have that much time to spend with her so, she just brought the spirit\nof the holiday to us, and kissed and she says, \u201cDon\u2019t give up.\u201d I remember, \u201cDon\u2019t give\nup.\u201d And we parted company. And when we stopped our chanting, the barracks was\ndivided in four sections, and the extreme left of our barracks, there was a group of\nwomen from Italy, Jewish women from Italy. And when we stopped the Kol Nidre, they\nstarted to sing \u201cMama Son Tanta Felice\u2019, like an expression of their longing to the life\nthat they had been deprived of just like we. Ours was a religious expression of some thing\nthat was meaningful and traditional. They maybe did not understand. I\u2019m sure they were\nJews. They should have been familiar, but their reaction to this chanting in a very quiet\nvoice coming from the other side was just so overwhelming that I will never forget it. So,\nwhat I think about it is that in the worse times, when you have a little spark of normalcy,\nwhen you can\u2019t think what life is really like in normal existence, when you think in terms\nof the holiday and observing the holiday and preparing for it, or whatever connection you\nhave, you know, with something that is near and dear to you, if you can create it in the\nmost horrible situation, it still can be very, very uplifting. I shouldn\u2019t...cry.",
        "A: I know it, yes, but I don\u2019t know the whole thing. I know...",
        "A: I don\u2019t know if I can sing now after all this crying. I don\u2019t know the words. I know it goes\nlike this: [Sings first part] I don\u2019t know the words really. [Sings on \u2018la\u2019]. And then it\nstarts [Sings on \u2018la\u2019]. And, then it was a beautiful very beautiful song, and the word\n\u201cMama\u201d. Mama, you know, inasmuch as it starts \u201cMama Son Tanta Felice\u2019, which\nmeans Mama, I\u2019m so happy, but you know when I think of this melody and when I heard\nit for the first time, you know, and it kind of reminds me of Mein Yiddishe Mame to a\ncertain extent, it\u2019s a different mama, it\u2019s a different situation, but it\u2019s the longing for\nhome. It\u2019s the longing for mother. It\u2019s the mother who, in my opinion, that it represents\nthe home, and the security and everything, and this is what they really needed and this is\nwhat they wanted. So, Pll wipe my eyes.",
        "A: I\u2019m fine.",
        "A: Well, we couldn\u2019t choose much really. You see the Judenrat was formed, and then\nJudenrat was basically the administration of the ghetto and the people, and they were\nresponsible for all the demands made by the Nazi authorities or whatever. Whether it was\na demand for contributions or whether it was a demand for labor or whether it was \u2014\nwhatever the demand was. So, my father, due to the fact that he was very familiar with\nfigures and very familiar with the German language was asked by the Judenrat to\nsupervise the working groups that were coming daily to work. They gave him this job,\nyou know, he was not part of the Judenrat. He was not a member of the Judenrat, but\nrather than to have the soldiers come every morning and catch people in the street,\nwhoever was available and most of the people who were caught in the street where not\neven fit for the work that they wanted them to do. So, the Judenrat came to the conclusion\nthat it would be much better if there was like an employment office where the authority,\nthe Nazi authorities would come and say, \u201cWe need that many, so-and-so people\ntomorrow for work.\u201d And, that this number of people should be sent for the daily work\nand eliminate this Lapaniki, as they call them, that they can \u2014 Lapac means to drag, to\ndrag people off the street. So, they gave my father the job. My father \u2014 they gave him a\nlist of all the people who were registered because food was rationed, so in order to\nreceive food you have to register with the Judenrat, whether you were a local person or\nwhether you were a person who was brought from a different area to town. All those\npeople had to be registered. So, the first job my father was given is to register all the\npeople who are able to perform work. Now, in the open ghetto, there were still people\nconducting business, because once things had settled down there wasn\u2019t that much\nbusiness. You didn\u2019t deal in extraordinary things, but you know, the guy who was selling\nshoes and galoshes, as long as he had a supplier who provided the merchandise to him, he\ncould do it, or the guy was selling sweaters or whatever. The bakery had to be run, you\nknow, and all that. So, first of all, the Judenrat gave my father the entire list of people\nwho were able to work, and on this basis, my father could prepare a list. Let\u2019s say there\nwas a demand for 200 people or 100 people whatever it was, and he has arranged it in\nsuch a way that everybody had to perform the work once a week in the beginning.\nAssuming that you were designated to come to work on Tuesday, and either you were too\nbusy or you didn\u2019t want to, as long as you were able to pay another person to fill in for\nyou, it was okay. And there were \u2014 those people who didn\u2019t want or couldn\u2019t go and were\nable to afford it were more than happy to pay for the day\u2019s work to another person, and in\nmost cases, the people who were filling for this person were people who were displaced,\nwho needed the day\u2019s work, because when they went to work they got paid from the man\nwhose place they have taken, and they have gotten a bowl of soup and some bread on the\njob. So, this worked extremely well, and it was calm due to the fact that Father could \u2014\nwhat do I want to say \u2014 he communicated with them and there were no beatings and there\nwas no chasing and there was no running, and it was calm and it was good. As a matter of\nfact, you know, he sometimes used to come home and say, \u201cIt\u2019s such a shame,\u201d he says,\n\u2018T had so many eager people today who wanted to go and work, and there was none of\ndemand for them to be sent.\u201d It was just \u2014 that was in the beginning, because later on the\nwhole thing didn\u2019t matter, you know, no matter how orderly you were. But there were\nreally people coming there every morning and sitting there waiting for someone who\ncame in and say, \u201cI\u2019m not going to work today. Who\u2019s the guy who\u2019s going to be in my\nplace and take it for the day?\u201d It was a perfect kind of an arrangement, and it was peace\nand calm and wonderful, and it went on like this because the jobs were meaningless in\nthe beginning. All they did was to humiliate the people, to get them out, the permanent\npeople in the community, and kick them and beat them, just like the incident with my\nfather, and just make life difficult. But when things began to kind of become more or less\norderly, they came to the conclusion that they needed the Jews not just for the manual\nwork of sweeping the street, giving the permanent people a broom to sweep or whatever\nto humiliate them, but they can use them performing manual work in factories. They\nstarted to make demands for labor force for the factory. So, this whole thing changed\nabout, too, because, from that group that was trying to kind of find other people to fill for\nthem at work, they realized what 1s going on in other parts of the country, where people,\nif they are not employed, are been resettled, taken away, that they seek themselves\nemployment and in order to have the arbeitskarte, they went to work. So, there\u2019s this\narbeitskarte, which is the certificate of employment, protected you from being deported\nlater on. So, you know, everything was kind of a gradual change from a bad situation into\na worse situation, and constantly changing because the demands were greater and greater\nand greater. First they took away your money, and then they took away your valuables\nand your furs \u2014 do you know that as a child in my picture with my two sisters, I\u2019m\nwearing like a three-quarter coat that already I was growing and it was time for me to get\na new coat. And then the war broke out and I still had that coat. It was very warm\nbecause it had a lining, a fur lining, that I was walking in that jacket in the street and a\nGerman soldier ripped off the fur collar of my coat, telling me that a Jew does not wear\nfur. It was not a fur piece. He did not even know the lining there was like a shell would\nyou say, right? But just by ripping off a collar of my coat... So, you know, they were\nimposing all kinds of things every day, every day. First, you know, that they confiscated\nthe valuables from you. They took everything you had. Then they made you wear the\narmband with \u2014 the white armband with the blue star, the Star of David, and no matter\nhow old you were, whether you were ten years old or whether you were an old person,\nyou had to be identified as a Jew. And if they caught you without the armband and, even\nthough for us to mix in with the Polish population wasn\u2019t so difficult because we weren\u2019t\nreally locked in or fenced in, but nobody, nobody dared to even to take off the armband.\nWe kind of felt that this 1s what we have to, and this is how we have to work, and it\u2019s\ngoing to be all right, and the Judenrat really, the people who were in the Judenrat were\npeople who were leaders of the community before the war. They were decent, nice,\nelegant people who were friends of my parents, who were members of the Zionist\norganization, who worked together, you know, and they just assumed this responsibility\nto have a peaceful Jewish community, for it to continue. But you never knew, every\nmorning was a different demand for the special assessment of funds. They came that\nunless the community\u2019s going to produce so and so many zlotys, you know, for whatever\nwithin 24 hours, there are going to be measures taken that everybody\u2019s going to regret.\nSo, of course, each and every family was assessed with some contribution 1n order to\ncreate the funds that were demanded. So, life wasn\u2019t easy, but Father was pleased that he\ncould occupy peacetime in a very constructive way, and he was instrumental in creating,\nso to say, a controlled atmosphere in the ghetto, where Jews did not have to be grabbed in\nthe morning, you know, whether they were on their way to a morning service or running\n\u2014 there was no synagogue, anyhow, because the synagogue was burned on Yom Kippur\nday in our town. They thought that Kol Nidre night \u2014 they didn\u2019t realize that Kol Nidre\nwas the eve before Yom Kippur, and they knew that the Jews are going to be congregated\non Yom Kippur in the synagogue. So, they came in the evening hoping that the\nsynagogue is going to be full of Jews, and torched it. But nobody was there and nobody\nprayed in the synagogue anyhow; everybody had their prayers in home in, you know, and\ngathered in private homes or in the quarters of different organizations that they had, like\nsmall little clubs. They weren\u2019t really \u201cclubs\u201d as we know them in the United States, but,\nyou know, a gathering place for different organizations because there was the general\nZionists and there was the Betar and there was the revisionists and, you know, that was\nthe group of Jabotinsky and there was an orthodox group of Jews who I don\u2019t remember\nthe name of their organization. So, you know, it was more like gathering out of sight\nwhere you couldn\u2019t be too obvious and not too many people at the same time could be\nfound in one particular place.",
        "A: That was 1939.",
        "A: First Yom Kippur.",
        "A: That was very modern by comparison with what was available. So, we moved and this\napartment has been given to us by the Judenrat because they knew which homes were 1n\nthe ghetto where you were permitted to live and, on the basis of how large the family\nwas, they were so to say \u2014 it\u2019s like my father, who was running the department of\nsupplying the labor force to the factories, there was a person who was in charge of\nallocating living quarters for people. So, I really don\u2019t know who was in charge, but\nanyhow, when we were forced to move from that apartment, we went to live in that one\nroom which was a large room, a very large room, but it was not \u2014 it must have been a\nstore at one time or another because I vaguely remember seeing a stove or anything like\nthat. It was kind of \u2014 it was a large space, but nothing to it, and then when we had to\nshare it with another family because it was such a large space, it was not a home of any\nkind. This is why my memories are so... not quite clear. All I remember 1s that it was a\nlarge space. It was our second move. It was our \u2014 we had another move yet. From there,\nwe had to move to another one which was a courtyard also full of Jews, and there, it was\nall very, very hard, because we were so many families. Not just in our apartment, we\nalways had to share an apartment with another family, but there were \u2014 every single\napartment had additional people and depending on the size, you know, you were allowed\nto a room and then you shared the kitchen facilities or whatever. So, that was the third\nmove, and then finally, this for the last year or so in the ghetto, this apartment on the\nborder of the ghetto and the outside of the ghetto was available, and this is, I\u2019m sure that\nit\u2019s, it has been wonderful, it has been a blessing to be able to be by ourselves, but then\nMother was working, and every apartment has something that was so painful and so\nhorrible. Mother was working with people as I told you before, and she was the one who\nhad helped to organize the soup kitchens for the people who were coming, brought to the\nghetto and they were bringing constantly people because they needed people to work in\nthe factories. So, and there were a lot of destitute people who had nothing so, providing\nfor them, everyone to live, was one of the most important things. Providing for them a\njob where they could go to the factory and even though at the time we weren\u2019t paid\nanything, anymore \u2014 once you went to the factory, you were not paid a penny, and by that\ntime, everybody was anxious to have an employment card. So, nobody was willing to\ngive the destitute people any help. So, they organized the soup kitchen, and Mother was\nthere working every day, and one day she came home and she was sick with Typhoid.",
        "A: Typhus, typhus from lice. She must have been bitten by a lice working with the poor\npeople, by a louse, and she got very, very sick. And I was always there, in no matter what\nsituation, I was the one who was the most trained to be of assistance, and I\u2019Il tell you\nwhy. A very logical thing \u2014 my oldest sister was not home. She was away in school when\nshe was growing up. She left home very early at the age of twelve. So, she wasn\u2019t around\nhome base, you know, to be taught or to observe or to learn. Renia, my little sister, was a\nlittle thing. So, I always \u2014 it seems like my parents kind of felt that I am of more help to\nthem than anyone of us. So, I remember that when Mother got very sick and the doctor\ncame to see her \u2014 you know, we had Jewish doctors in town and they all were friends. It\u2019s\nnot just like \u2014 they didn\u2019t come as a doctor. They came to help you because they were\ndoctors and they had the medical knowledge. And I remember how the doctor sat down\nwith me and he said to me \u2014 it was like the fourth or the fifth day, and it takes like six\ndays, twelve days from the time when you get sick until you go through the crisis. So, in\nthe beginning, you know, he just was coming in every day to look after her and gave her\nwhatever kind of medication he had available. I don\u2019t know. But then, towards the eighth\nday, he sat me down and he said to me, \u201cIt\u2019s going to be very, very difficult for your\nmother for the next four days, and I want you to know that you, that it\u2019s up to you how\nmuch attention you are going to pay and how much time you are going to spend with her\nin order to assist her and pull through this difficult period.\u201d And, he explained to me what\nkind of symptoms to look for, that her fever is going to get very, very high, and there is\nvery little medication that can be acquired because, you know, it\u2019s not normal times, and\nhe will try his very best but he doesn\u2019t know how much he can do, that I have to always\nbe at my mother\u2019s bedside, that she does not need food, but she needs that constant\npresence by her side, because the fever is going to be very, very high and I have to watch\nher very carefully and I have to have a basin of cold water and I have to have washcloths\nto change her compress on her head. That was the only thing you could do to kind of\nbring down the temperature. And, you know, I listened. You know, somebody said to me\nthat I am very good in doing thing, you know, the right way. I am always following\ninstructions very carefully because what I am taught; I was always told very carefully\nhow to proceed in doing things. So, if you follow instructions, you follow instructions.\nBut, anyhow, this was his advice and I didn\u2019t know what to anticipate really, but I\nlistened very carefully and I got prepared. And the tenth day was not so bad. Mother was\nstill aware of the fact that I was around, and the doctor told me that nobody should be in\nthe room with her, just I, and to keep the shades 1n the window closed so that the room is\ndark. It should not disturb her, so that she has a lot of sleep, because this is very, very\nimportant, but at the same time, I shouldn\u2019t allow her to sleep for too long, because this is\nvery bad for her. Mind you, I\u2019m only fifteen years old or sixteen, whatever \u2014 and, you\nknow, the worst day was the night of the eleventh, the eleventh day of her sickness.\nWhen I touched her, the heat was unbelievable and she \u2014 she was kind of delirious, she\ndidn\u2019t know what was happening, and she was talking and she was saying, \u201cTake her\naway from me. I just don\u2019t like her. She is so ugly. She is so horrible with the black\nclothes on.\u201d I\u2019m sitting there with the person that I love so much, and here is this horrible\nresponsibility on my shoulders, and the doctors gave strict orders to everybody. He said,\n\u201cPull the mattress out of this room, put it in the kitchen somewhere, and stay if you want.\nIf you want your mother to live, you have got to give her total and complete peace and\nquiet.\u201d It was something that I\u2019ll never forget because, if you think in terms of fighting\nback, you know, and having that strength to realize that this is the moment, and asking\nfor this death to be taken away. I mean, after all, who is there in the black thing looking\nhorrible? You know, and that was very, very difficult \u2014 later afternoon, usually the\ntemperature was rising. In the morning, the temperature was not as high, but as the\nafternoon set in it was always very, very high and it was getting higher and very bad, and\nI was changing her compresses and holding my hand on her hand to just give her\ncomfort, for her to know that somebody is with her, and finally the following morning,\nshe opened her eyes. And I could see that she feels better because for two days, she didn\u2019t\neven \u2014 her eyes were just almost, not completely closed, but I could see that the\ntemperature was really getting her down. And, you know, then she got well. I felt good\nthat I have a mother. That was wonderful, very happy, that I was capable to do the job.\nMy sisters, of course, no doubt, were just as happy as I was, and Mother went right back\nto work as soon as she felt better, she resumed her obligations that was the community\nand the people in the community and so forth and so on. Then, more and more people had\nto be employed in the factories so everybody who lived in town outside of the very old\nand the very sick had to go to work, and Mother was working also in the factories in a\ndepartment, and my little sister was working in the factory, and Hania, my older sister,\nand myself were working in the beginning in a brick factory because they needed brick\nfor construction of new space for the manufacture of arms, and Father was in charge of\nthe arbeitsamt, making sure that if somebody was sick and couldn\u2019t go to work, that he\nfound someone who went to work that day, and then came the liquidation of the ghetto.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: It was. It was very frightening.",
        "A: No, as a matter of fact, I remember, when the doctor came and she felt better, and the\ndoctor came and he says \u2014 as I said before, the doctor was a friend. He didn\u2019t come\nbecause we could afford the luxury of a doctor, you know. He came by because he was a\nfriend and he wanted to assist her. So, I say to him, \u201cShe didn\u2019t eat in two days. What\nshould I give her?\u201d Not that we had that much food, but the food was Russian and so we\nhave bread and we have a jam and saccharin, and Ersatz coffee and stuff like that. He\nsays, \u201cShe shouldn\u2019t be eating anything heavy, and I know that you can not cook her soup\nor anything like that. I\u2019m going to see to it that I get for you a little bit of farina, like, grits\nor whatever.\u201d And, he says, \u201cAnd, Ill show you how to cook it, because you cannot\nprepare anything that she won\u2019t be able to eat.\u201d I still remember how I pulled out that\nlittle pot and he told me how much water to put it in and put it on the stove, and he\nmeasured it with a teaspoon or a tablespoon, I don\u2019t remember, and how he taught me\nhow to prepare that tablespoon of farina. When to put it in, \u201cWhen the water comes to a\nboil,\u201d he says, \u201cPut it in. Stir it. Cook it for about two or three minutes until 1t becomes\nthicker in its consistency. Let it cool a little bit, and feed your mother, and give it to her\nthree times a day.\u201d And, then he said to me, \u201cAnd when she feels a little better...\u201d I still\nremember the order of the food that she was supposed to eat. He says, \u201cAnd when she\nfeels a little better, make sure that you get hold of some beets and because if you cook the\nbeets the beet juice is going to be very helpful for her blood circulation with that.\u201d Beets\nare for blood, whether it was circulation or anything, to strengthen her. This is how much\nI remember. It was a responsibility, but 1t was nothing. It wasn\u2019t a burden. It was\nsomething I did with the greatest of love to make sure that Mother survived. Well,\nMother was the best, in my opinion, in the world. There haven\u2019t been too many people\nlike her who have done so much for others, and yet she was the first one to be taken away\nfrom us, and she was the first one to go to Treblinka, by some freak accident. So, what\nam I to tell you? Then, three years later, or a year later, when we were in camp already,\nmy two sisters got sick with Typhus, but by then I was already experienced. Then my\nfather got sick, and then I got sick. So, 1t was \u2014 I was the nurse going from one to the\nother, but the cases, as they were coming along, there was a lot less to work with, and\nthere was no advice from a doctor anymore because the doctor wasn\u2019t there anymore.\nAnd, but somehow we managed, and somehow we survived. So, the ghetto was\nliquidated in October 1942. Up to that point, things were not the best, but things were not\nthe worst, because when you went to work, you received some food at the factory. There\nwas always soup served during, you know, we worked 12 hours. There were two shifts\nfor the Jews. Normally, the factory worked on three shifts for the regular workers. The\nJews were working 12-hour shifts. So, there was always food, a bowl of soup, that was\nserved during the working hours. So, in a way, you know, you didn\u2019t have much to eat in\nthe morning when you left for work, but somehow somewhere along the line, your soup\ncame along and a little coffee and it was okay. It\u2019s, it\u2019s the kind of existence where you\nreally are so limited to what you can do, and what you can say and what you can think,\nand it isn\u2019t like I\u2019m going to rebel or I\u2019m going to strike or anything. You had no choices.\nThere are no choices. All you had to do was just kind of constantly submit to everything\nthat is imposed on you and you have to do and do and do, and try to deal with it in a way\nthat you don\u2019t break down emotionally or physically, because I could see that anybody\nwho couldn\u2019t deal with it didn\u2019t last too long. They didn\u2019t have to be in Auschwitz.\nAuschwitz was the worst experience, but even here. There were two friends of mine who\ncame from Lodz ghetto, twin sisters, beautiful girls. One was a redhead, I mean, there\nwasn\u2019t a person in the world who wouldn\u2019t notice her, you know? She had the wonderful\npersonality. She was friendly and pretty and everything, and the other was very dark \u2014\ndark hair, but bright, well brought up, nice, wonderful two girls. And up until the time\nthey were in ghetto, their parents were with them, and from the ghetto they were\nemployed, and for one reason or another, the people \u2014 their parents \u2014 did not survive.\nThose two girls didn\u2019t last long at all. First of all, they came from most likely a wealthy\nhome and therefore they didn\u2019t know how to take care of themselves. So, outside of being\nhungry and having very little to eat and not having their parents around to care for them,\nthey didn\u2019t even know how to wash their underwear that they were wearing. I mean, all\nyou had was one set. If you\u2019re lucky, you have two, right, for a change, but no matter\nwhat, if you have one or two, we always managed somehow to keep ourselves clean.\nThose two girls, you could see them fade away. There was nothing. They just couldn\u2019t\nmanage. They had each other and they couldn\u2019t help one another because they were both\nhelpless.\nEnd of Tape #3\nTape #4",
        "A: I wouldn\u2019t call it choices. I don\u2019t think that choices would be the right application in this\nparticular case because you couldn\u2019t predict what is going to happen, not from one day to\nanother. From one morning to the end of the day, you never know, you couldn\u2019t\nanticipate what is going to take place. So, I wouldn\u2019t say that, that choice 1s the right\ndescription of the situation. I feel that you have to have a very strong desire to live, and if\nyou have a strong desire to live, I think that one can manage, under the most adverse\ncondition, to live or try to kind of survive in a way that one doesn\u2019t break down and one\ndoesn\u2019t emotionally. The worst thing was breaking down emotionally. Physically, from\none day to another, we were really losing our strength and it was quite obvious, but no\nmatter what your physical condition was if you were not outright sick, and you did not\ngive in, but you had this feeling that you would overcome the difficulties because you\nwant to survive, then this was, in a way, your strength that gave you hope. Hope was the\nmost important thing because, if you had hope, you didn\u2019t breakdown emotionally. Once\nyou broke down emotionally and you were resigned completely that life is not\nworthwhile living, or you would find yourself in a situation that who needs it anymore to\nsuffer so much. Everybody that one loved is gone and to just remain alone in this world.\nThere were many situations like such situations like this. Some people did not survive\nbecause they didn\u2019t know how to manage. Some people did not survive because they\nwere too aggressive and for this they were punished by being killed or clobbered to death.\nSome people did not survive due to the fact that they were physically so exhausted that\nthey came to the conclusion that, whether they go to work that day and drop dead on the\njob or whether they will not get out of bed, but quote-unquote-unquote, it was always\nthey \u2014 what do you call it? The bunk bed or the berth or whatever that you slept in, it just\ndidn\u2019t make any difference at all. And it was women who were older who had families\nwhose children were taken away from them like in Auschwitz, who didn\u2019t know whether\ntheir husband survived or not, to them life was meaningless. It took a very, very strong\nindividual really to have this very strong desire to live when it came to who had the\nfamily life or already had responsibility to a husband and children. And, it is, I think,\nyoung people like ourselves who \u2014 maybe that was that instinct of a survival, like a\nyoung puppy who Is in a situation that 1s not familiar with and the momma dog 1s not\naround, and they have to somehow either hide or whatever to get out of the situation.\nQuite often I think about it, in such a way, that instinctive in a way animalistic, which is\nmaybe not the right expression. The desire to survive, without logic, without anything,\nbut just that instinct, that feeling that I have to manage, I have to be aware that it 1s a very\ndangerous situation, and somehow I must get out if it. So, this was very important, and\nthen it was very important to have someone who was able to assist you, and there were\npeople who were willing to assist you \u2014 not because they knew you, not because they\nwanted to, it was just that it was \u2014 it just happened. It happened so that you were at the\nright place at the right time, and somebody who was right there near you who was willing\nto help you. And this kind of a situation we found ourselves in Auschwitz. We came in\n1944, in July. By the middle of October, it was a pathetic thing to look at us. We were\nhungry. We were beaten. We didn\u2019t have any clothes. I worked in a detail where they\ntook us out to a river to cut underbrush because it was the beginning of underground\nactivities in Auschwitz and people were escaping, so in order to clear the view for the\nwatchtowers, there was marshland, so they took us out to work there. And I still have my\nshoes on my feet that I came in, which were good shoes, and I remember I left the shoes\n\u2014 I was working in the marshes and I sunk to my feet, and I came out of it with the tops\nof the shoes because the bottom were so rotten already that they got stuck in that mud.\nAnd it was October, and I was strong when I came in, you know. People that were good \u2014\nthey were all good. There were no bad people because we really had to depend on one\nanother so much that nobody had much, but still, if they saw you in that situation that you\nreally needed help, they were trying to assist you. So, I remember coming back in from\nwork and it was very cold, and somebody gave me clogs, wooden clogs, and I couldn\u2019t\nwalk in them. They were rubbing my feet and I walked barefoot, and it was just horrible.\nAnd when we came to the barracks, somebody gave me a regular boot, which was a very\ngood, laced up boot. It was too big for me. It must have been a man\u2019s shoe, but all she\nhad was that one boot so she gave it to me and then somebody else gave me a high heeled\npump, ladies\u2019 shoes. It\u2019s a funny story. It was ridiculous, but if you think in terms of the\nsituation I found myself in. October, which is very, very cold, and you have to stand \u2014 it\u2019s\nan uphill, and you can stand with bare feet because you\u2019ll have pneumonia, plain and\nsimple. So, I was like this, one leg up and one leg down. It was funny. We laughed, but I\nwasn\u2019t cold, and those days were kind of very, very bad. There was an underground\nactivity already. The Nazi supervisors were very aware of something going on in camp,\nand due to the fact that there were special work details where they employed only\nChristian Poles who were political prisoners, they were afraid that by leaving them on\ntheir own, that they would establish a contact with the underground activities, I mean,\nthose who were with the underground, and there\u2019s going to be an uprising. This was the\ntime when the front was nearing, of course, because we were moved to Auschwitz from\nthe ghetto to, at the time when the Russian forces were already close to Warsaw, but the\nfront didn\u2019t move until later on in the fall, and for this reason, you know, we remained in\nAuschwitz. Here, the Nazis were afraid of the underground activities, of the Russian front\napproaching and everything, so they came to the conclusion that they ought to take and\nbreak up the Polish work details \u2014 work units and bring some Jews in for them not to be\nas comfortable and not to be able to do the work that they were afraid of, as far as\nuprising. We were supposed to go to work one morning and the barracks were\nadministered by three people. There was a Block Alteste, and there was her assistant, and\nthere was a Shreiberin, who was a secretary kind of, who was counting the people in the\nmorning when they went to work, and counting the people in the evening, and they were\nall old-timers. Do you know what I mean? Old-timers is that they were brought, for\nexample, the Czech \u2014 the two girls, the Block Alteste and the assistant, was from Slovakia\nand their transport was, I think, the very early transport, because one of them was so\nhorrible. She was so horrible. She was just so full of hate for everything and everyone\nthat she was just so rude and she \u2014 the Nazis didn\u2019t have the Aufsehers, who were\noverseeing the work and who were taking, and the guards were taking us to work did not\nhave to worry about so much about punishing us, because half of the job was done by this\nparticular woman. I mean, she \u2014 on the one hand, you know, I can think of her as\nsuffering so much for two and a half years prior to our arrival or two years, whatever it is,\nand the first group, I think, was of 500 women and very few survived. So, she must have\nlost everybody who dear and near to her, and therefore, you know, she was afflicting all\nher anger and the pain on everybody who was coming, and to be tough and rough kind of\ngave her the security of the job indoors. She didn\u2019t have to go to work, and the story that\nI have to read is kind of describing of what life was like in one day, because I called it\n\u201cOne Ordinary Day in Auschwitz.\u201d So, anyhow why I\u2019m talking about it is because by\nthen this Sonderkommando had uprising, one of the crematoriums was damaged, and the\nNazis came to the conclusion that most of the gas chambers should \u2014 no, most of the\ncrematoriums should be dismantled because there is \u2014 they don\u2019t \u2014 I mean, the front is so\nclose and they didn\u2019t want to leave any evidence. And, this woman who was the secretary\nof the block went with a report to the main offices, because after each counting in the\nmorning and in the evening, she had to report to the headquarters on the amount of the\npeople who was in the barrack because food was allocated on this basis. And, usually we\nwent to work, you know, and we had not seen her. On that particular morning, she\nreturned immediately and she kind of walked over where we were like nine people\nsleeping in my section, in an upper berth, and I was like close to the end, and she pulled\nme and she says, \u201cTake your two sisters and follow me and don\u2019t say a word.\u201d So, I\nmean, she was a Polish girl, and when we came to Auschwitz, she asked us where we are\nfrom, and I told her, and we had, knew some people \u2014 she had some friends who came to\nlive in our town before the war, and they lived in the neighborhood. So, kind of there was\na little bit of a contact right there that we had established. And she says, \u201cDon\u2019t say a\nword. Take your sisters and follow me.\u201d So, I pull my sisters and I say, \u201cLet\u2019s follow.\u201d\nWe follow her and we come to where the main office is and there on that big square are\nwoman, maybe a hundred, well-dressed in good garments, jackets, decent shoes, I mean\nnot \u2014 I mean well-dressed in the sense that they had good clothes on. You know, they had\na warm jacket and a warm skirt or whatever and good shoes on, and here we come in\nshreds, and I come with the high-heeled shoe and a combat boot, what I called it, and\nthere was a German and she says like this, \u201cI cannot be with you. Go join the group of the\nwomen. There is going to be \u2014 they need 20 women or 22 women...\u201d I don\u2019t remember,\nit\u2019s around 20, but 21, 22, it\u2019s not important. \u201c...to work in offices. Remember, whatever\nshe asks you whether you know, you do know,\u201d and she says, \u201cAnd, Renia\u2019s going to\nstay here with me. And, you go with Hania.\u201d I mean, \u201cThe two of you go.\u201d That\u2019s what\nshe said to us. So, we go and we have a dress on. We don\u2019t have any undergarments\nwhatsoever. In Auschwitz, we did not get any undergarments. Whatever entlausung, you\nknow we went through that, how do you call it, entlausung, the process of getting rid of\nthe lice, when they took you to the shower room, and they took off your clothes and\ndumped it in a big vat of disinfectant water and they dried it somewhere, I don\u2019t know\nwhere, and when you came out from the shower the threw at you a garment regardless\nwhether it was something that fits you or doesn\u2019t fit you. You know, we were running\nnude through the whole camp to go through to that shower room, and then of course,\nfortunately, you know, we managed, because we used to look at each other and kind of\nwhoever was taller has exchanged the dress or whatever was thrown at you with a person\nthat could wear it. And so in this respect, the whole group was aware and very\ncooperative; but never undergarments. At the time, when we came in, we had nothing,\noutright nothing. So, I\u2019m in a dress. I can remember a long cotton dress and these shoes,\nand we are standing with my sister. We looked like two set of stepsisters, like Cinderella\nnext to the stepsisters, who were always so dressed up. And, I think to myself, \u201cHow in\nthe world are we going to get a job here?\u201d And, that SS man who came to look for\nworkers walks through the group. He told us to line up, you know, and we lined up and I\nwas standing next to my sister and he\u2019s asking my sister what kind of qualifications she\nhas for an office job and she speaks German very well, and she says that she worked in\nthe office when we were in camp and Father was working in the arbeitsamt, whenever\nthere was no transport and he couldn\u2019t manage to have all the lists for the following\nmorning, one of us always went to assist him so that he could \u2014 you know, he was not a\nyoung man anymore. I mean, he wasn\u2019t an old man, but you know, being alone and so\nforth, it was very difficult. So, we kind of were acquainted with office work. So, my\nsister tells him yes, yes, whatever he\u2019s asking her, whether she can do this and this, and\nshe says yes, yes, and she speaks a very fluent German, and fine. So, he tells her to go\nhere, and he is asking. I just happened to be next to her, but there were other women\nbefore her. So, he puts one on this side, one on this side, one on this side, one on this side.\nThen he says to me, \u201cDo you know how to type on a shreibeshim?\u201d \u2014 on a typewriter. So\nI look at him, and I say, \u201cJch bein eine sehr gute machinenschreiberin.\u201d And, whatever.\nAnd, he looks at me, and he waves to go next to Hania. So, I figured okay, whatever\u2019s\ngoing to happen isn\u2019t going to matter, but I\u2019m next to my sister and everything 1s okay.\nAnd, he goes back and forth, back and forth, back and forth, back and forth, then he looks\nat our group and he starts counting and he says, \u201cGenug.\u201d And he tells everybody go, and\nwe all went, which genug means enough. So, he counted and we were 20 \u2014 I don\u2019t know\n20, we were 20 or 25. Whatever we were, but this was the number because we were to\nreplace 25 Polish political prisoners in that work group that was dealing only with\nproperty that was brought to camp by political prisoners. The political prisoners\u2019\nproperty, whether it was a dress a sweater a hairpin, when they were taken, put in\nAuschwitz concentration camp and given a uniform, every little item they brought with\nthem had to be registered and stored, so in case they were transferred to a different camp,\nthat each and every item had to follow them or, if they died, that their property was\nreturned to the family. So, they had to keep a very close account of the property of the\nwomen political Polish prisoners. While the property of the Jews who were brought to\ncamp, to Auschwitz, was confiscated, and the good things were stored in Kanada, which\nwas this unit known, you know, where they stored the stuff, and selected the good things\nto be sent to the Reich, including all valuables and everything, and the rest of the things\nwere distributed to the prisoners, you know, when they ran out of uniforms. So, we are\nthere and he\u2019s just about to march us off, and I know already but we are qualified for the\njob. Now, the job is not anymore where we have been. The job 1s all together in a\ndifferent area and very close to Kanada and we are being marched out somewhere else,\nand my sister Renia is not with us. And, then I see fellows standing in the back with my\nsister Renia, and the Block Alteste, the woman who was in charge of the block, and they\nkind of push my sister Renia and the Block Alteste comes running with her and she says\nto the man who was selecting the people for work, she says, \u201cPlease take her with you.\nHer two sisters are there, and she can make a very good Lieferant (ph)\u2019 A Lieferant (ph)\ndue to the fact that there were no phones in camp, only the headquarters had phones, any\nmessages that had to be carried between barracks were done by people who were the so-\ncalled runners between the - how do you say that? \u2014 those who, that made it possible for\nthe barracks to communicate with the main office and other departments. But, \u201cShe\u2019s a\nvery good Lieferant (ph),\u201d and he looks at her and he sees the pathetic-looking thing and\nhe looks at us, and he says, \u201cOkay.\u201d And, he pounds and he marches us off. Now, we are\ncoming to the new place to work, and there is no room for us yet because the other\nwomen whom we are replacing are still there. They have not been transported to another\nplace and it is their job to acquaint us with the work that they have been doing. So, as we\nwere entering, the girl who stood guard to the entrance of Kanada, a little girl whose\nname was Fela (ph), she saw the difference between the other women, the way what they\nlooked like, and us, and she knew that this is like, you know, like something non-existent,\nbecause the people who worked in Kanada, they have access to food because the food\nwas brought with the transport. So, it\u2019s not really that \u2014 1t was confiscated. It was taken\nout of the trains. It was brought to Kanada, anyhow. So, they had good clothes and they\nhad \u2014 so, as we were walking by she says, at break, she says, \u201cYou come to me. I\u2019ve got\nto see you.\u201d So, we nodded our heads and we said, \u201cFine. We are going to come.\u201d You\nknow, in a situation like this, when you see that somebody wants to see you, you knew\nthat somebody wants to see you for a different reason, for an important one, let\u2019s put it\nthis way. So, at break, we went to the barracks and by then, she had a whole crew waiting\nfor us. She had good coats, painted with a red stripe, because if you didn\u2019t have a\nuniform, a striped uniform, you had a red stripe painted on the back. So, they took us like\nto a little enclosure. There were four women. I never saw them in my life including that\nlittle girl who stood at the gate. They dressed us with everything, panties and bras and\nsocks and shoes and skirts and jackets, took off our numbers from the tattered clothes and\nput them on the new jacket, because we had to return back to the barracks that same day.\nThere was no room for us to stay here. Well, we worked all day. We got acquainted with\nthe job. It was a job inside, office work, \u201coffice\u201d quote, unquote, but still it was indoors,\nand working indoors made a great deal of a difference, and we went back to the barracks,\nto the original barracks to the group from Starachowice, and when we came in nobody\ncould recognize us, nobody. Because we looked so different. We had all these clothes and\neverything. So, you know what we did? We undressed and we shared our clothes. Mind\nyou, three people \u2014 everybody had something different of a different size. We took\neverything that we had on and gave it \u2014 shared it with the people who were in the\nbarracks because we knew that we are going back the next morning and the girls told us,\n\u201cDon\u2019t be afraid to leave those things to anyone you want to. We\u2019ll have new things for\nyou tomorrow.\u201d They didn\u2019t know that we were going to be back and forth, but they\nknew that for one week, we\u2019ll be moving around because it was a small area, you know,\nit was kind of a camp that was pretty much separated from the rest of the camp, and they\nknew that it would take about a week before the other women who were training us for\nthe job will leave. So, that was such a blessing because within this week, in the morning,\nwe were leaving the barracks in the worst clothes there was, and coming back in the\nevening, and we went through the same routine every day. And, you know, it was just the\nmost wonderful thing. We didn\u2019t help much. The group was, I don\u2019t know how many we\nwere, about 200, and you can do just so much, but somebody has gotten something, you\nknow, that was helpful, and that was the most wonderful thing. There you are. Here is a\nwoman that we don\u2019t know, that was a kind of a, you know, an acquaintance that you run\ninto, and just a conversation with a person that you know some people that she knows or\nthat she was fond of who were from her hometown, and that was all. I mean it was not a\nfriendship of any kind. She was not even willing to show any kind of friendly association\nbecause, in order for her to keep her job, she was a barker is what I call her. She never hit\nanybody like the other one, but she barked. She was yelling and yelling and calling you\nthe worse names in the world, but this is about the extent of her being tough. This was her\ntoughness, and when she had this opportunity, mind you, and to be there and then to go\nand bring the Block Alteste to make sure that Renia\u2019s going to get in with us, a miracle,\nthat\u2019s my mother watching over us, and I\u2019m not kidding, because after the war when I\nreturned back to Poland and I went to see my hometown to find out if there 1s anybody\nleft from the family \u2014 because people were coming, maybe somebody was seeing,\nsomebody had, and there were about twenty Jews who had come back and settled back in\ntheir homes in one area, but the Paliszewski family, with whom my parents were so\nfriendly, with whom we had kind of always a home away from home, insisted that since\nthey didn\u2019t see us for such a long time, that we can stay a whole day with the people, but\nfor the night we should come to them and we should spend the night with them and\nthey\u2019Il give us an opportunity to talk and, one of the women, I had a picture of her with\nme when I went back to Poland, you know, when we went to Treblinka, she went with us.\nThat was in fact a finding mission in 1979. She said to us in 1945 \u2014 I was with my sister\nHania in their home and I sat around and I could see the Christmas tree, the corner where\nthe Christmas tree was and all the presents that they prepared for us. You know, they\ndidn\u2019t have small children, so, you know, that whole fun of the holiday, we were their\nchildren. So, it was kind of coming back, and she says to me, \u201cI want you to remember\nmy children. Two days before the liquidation of the ghetto, your mother was here. She\nbrought with her your Passover silver, and your Passover wine cups, and she said, \u2018I\nknow that I cannot burden you with any property, but if you don\u2019t mind, I would like you\nto hold them. I know that we have almost no chance to survive, but I am willing to give\nmy life with the knowledge that my three girls will survive the war.\u201d And, you know,\nsince what we had in 1945, right after the war, and I feel that all the difficult situations\nthat we went through, in moments where we really felt that 1t\u2019s the end, we reached a\npoint of no return, that it was really my mother who was watching over us. It\u2019s a miracle\nhow three young girls, with such a difference in age between the oldest and the youngest,\ncould hold on and go through the same period, and yet survive. So, I feel that it\u2019s not only\nthat, you know, some people say divine providence. I believe in divine providence, you\nknow? But at the same time, I also feel that these last words that the Paliszewsk1\u2019s who\nwere her friends had heard from her were so true, and the mother went down and she\nbrought me the silver and the wine cups, the Passover wine cups that I still have. This is\nthe only thing I have from home, because everything else that was placed with different\npeople are gone, and thing, you know, there were some things that they had taken that\nwere not such a tremendous responsibility. They didn\u2019t want to take anything of value,\nbecause they figured in case they are compelled to leave their home, they shouldn\u2019t have\nthis obligation to worry about our property. So, the warm sweaters and the coats that we\nleft with them because, once we went to work and we were coming back to the ghetto, we\nmet with Polish people at work, and if we knew people who were willing to take a\nmessage to them, they have seen to it that something was sent to us, even in this slave\nlabor camp in Starachowice, even after the ghetto, you know. Even, they could, whatever\nthey could afford to send us and assist us in any way they were very, very helpful. But\nyou had to have willing people who took the message to them, and trust them so that they\nwould not endanger the safety of the family. So, you had to be very, very careful, and\nthat\u2019s the way it is. But that very night when we were in Starachowice, let me finish this \u2014\nis there were about 20 Jews and five children who survived Auschwitz from my\nhometown, and they were coming back to town, and in the middle of the night a group of\nradical Poles, and there were many of them in this particular region, the NSZ, the most\nradical, not Communist, but fascist group in Starachowice, attacked that community, that\nlittle group of people who were there, and two of those children that survived Auschwitz\nwere killed that night, two adults, I think \u2014 I don\u2019t remember exactly. I know that there is\na record made of the amount of people who were injured, even with the names, I didn\u2019t\ncommend it to my memory, just recollecting. I know that there were five children who\nsurvived Auschwitz and two of them were killed that very night. That was June 1945.\nAnd then they came knocking at the door at the Paliszewski\u2019s house, and they said,\n\u201cOpen the door.\u201d It was like two o\u2019clock in the morning. And they said, \u201cWe know that\nthe Laks sisters are here with you, and we want them.\u201d And, the lady of the house, who\nwas in the other bedroom, and \u2014 because the friends were basically her young daughters,\nshe was a widow by then \u2014 walked over to the door and she said, \u201cHow dare you to\ndisturb my sleep. Yes, they are with me, but as long as they\u2019re under my roof you are not\ngoing to lay your hands on them, and please leave us alone.\u201d You know, they were a very\nrespected family. I mean, they weren\u2019t just anybody. They were a very respected family.\nSo, it was quiet and we didn\u2019t know what happened. We just knew that somebody was\nknocking in the middle night, demanding that we are, so to say, given to for whatever\nreason they wanted us. And, the following morning, one of the young women, before she\nwent to work, went to find out what happened that night, and she came running back. She\nwas like a ghost, as pale as a ghost, and she says, \u201cGirls, please don\u2019t leave the house,\njust stay here. There is something terrible that has happened, and the people who were\nhere looking for you have attacked that small group of Jews.\u201d And, she didn\u2019t have the\nexact number or anything, but \u201cthere are people and children killed, and just stay until the\nsituation clears.\u201d And, we stayed there for the whole day, and in the evening, when she\ncame back from work \u2014 they lived also very close to the railroad station, within walking\ndistance. It wasn\u2019t that far away. She came \u2014 in a small town everything 1s close. So, she\ncame from work and she went straight to the station and she bought tickets for us to go\nback to Lodz because we just came for the day to find out what\u2019s happening, and for the\ntrain, she knew exactly when the train will be coming, and she asked the man who was \u2014\nthe head of Doroszka. You know what the Doroszka 1s? It\u2019s like a horse and buggy that\nyou put the hood up to protect himself from \u2014 like in Central Park they have those\nbuggies \u2014 and she placed us, when we heard the whistle of the train in the distance \u2014 she\ntook us into Doroszka, covered up, took us to the train station was when the train was\nalready standing on the track, put us in the train, and was waiting there until the moment\nthe train started to move, to ascertain that we are safe, and that we can live in safety. And\nthis is how I left Starachowice, and promised myself never to return. It\u2019s again, we are\ntalking about things that we are jumping back and forth, but it\u2019s... I don\u2019t know. I think\nthat talking about the things that are very important at certain particular moments is better\nthen to kind of go in a chronological order that I may forget later on to speak about tt.\nAnd, by the way, that job lasted from the end of October and until the middle of January,\nwhich was two and a half months, and that was two and a half months in an environment\nthat was working under the roof, in the company of very intelligent Polish women, and\nafter the war, I found out that 50 percent were Jews, Jewish woman under assumed\nChristian names, that showed you concern and care and shared with you the packages\nthey were getting from home and created, not only a home environment for you, but a\nkind of an intellectual environment, as well, where after work, because we were a small\ngroup of 50, it must have been 25 women, because we were a small group of 50, we\ndidn\u2019t have to stand and Zahlappel. Everything was right there within this unit, which\nwas separate and apart from anything that was going on in Auschwitz. We were only\nresponsible for clothes and the suitcases and the pocketbooks and everything that was\nbrought by the Polish political prisons. So, in the evening, we used to sit and discuss and\ntalk and sing and kind of create a kind of a lighter situation, and also having a little extra\nfood and not being outdoors working in November and December, when conditions were\nhorrible, outright horrible, or be transported like everybody else to another camp at the\ntime, you know, they were mostly transporting people to different camps, and us they\nkept until the very last moments when the liquidating completely, abandoning Auschwitz.\nSo, in a way those two and a half months gave us self-esteem, brought us back to kind of\na little bit of a normal life. We had a little bit of extra food, and we had this group of\nwomen who were not as... desperate. I mean, they were political prisoners, they suffered.\nThey suffered. They were not treated, you know, a lot better than the Jews, but the mere\nfact that we didn\u2019t have to go with the command and morning count, and we didn\u2019t have\nthe dogs, and we didn\u2019t have the \u2014 no, the SS that led us to work, no \u2014 the soldiers who\nwere watching us, you know, and we didn\u2019t walk in the rain, and we didn\u2019t stand in the\nrain \u2014 that whole combination kind of gave us an opportunity to kind of become human\nagain. Human in a sense that if you regained a little bit of your self-esteem, because you\nwere not beaten, and you were treated like an equal and you were not called those\nhorrible names that sounded so terrible for a 15-year-old person, to be beaten and be\ncalled a whore and stuff like this, that I wouldn\u2019t even have dared to bring it out in the\npresence of my parents, expressions like this, and this is what was, so to say, a daily\nroutine. So, this kind of a thing was really a turning point that prepared us for the death\nmarch and then for all these next six months that were not so good, but on the other hand,\nthey were not so terrible that we gave up hope. So, you know, it\u2019s like a good month and\na bad month, and a good period and a bad period, and if you combine it all together and\nyou have this support, so to say, of someone that loves you and you love them and you\nare aware of the fact that you have to help each other, I think that this is a secret of\nsurvival.",
        "A: That will be fine.",
        "A: It\u2019s fine. Whatever you want. If you feel that it is good to continue and worthwhile.",
        "A: Pll make myself available.",
        "A: So, you want to do it nght now?",
        "A: All right. Thank you.\nEnd of Tape #4\nTape #5",
        "A: Good morning.",
        "A: Yes, of course. That was about in the summer of 1942 when transports to Treblinka were\nbeing sent en masse from Warsaw ghetto. They just started the evacuation of ghettos, and\nI think it was Warsaw that was the first one \u2014 the first transport. It was like, I would say,\nSeptember \u2014 not September, but August 1942, when on one afternoon, we were sitting 1n\nthe backyard with some friends talking, spending some time together, when all of a\nsudden out of the bushes, a young man appeared and he was very disheveled. He was\nunshaven and he was filthy, and he was very, very frightened. And when he saw us, he\nwasn\u2019t quite certain whether he should come out or not, but when he saw us, he somehow\ndared to come out and say, \u201cAmhat\u2019 (ph). Amhat was like a password at the time for\nmaking sure that the people you\u2019re encounter are also Jews. Actually, we used to say not\namhat, but amhut, with a \u201cu\u2019\u2019. I mean like, and of course, we answered immediately\n\u201cAmhut\u2019 to him, and this kind of got him a little relaxed, but he was still, very, very\nnervous and he was just so strange looking. We had never seen anybody in this kind of a\ncondition. We asked him who he was and he started to tell us this story how he came with\nhis parents to Treblinka, how they were brought on the transport to Treblinka, and how\nhis parents were separated from him immediately upon arrival, how he was put to work to\nunload the belongings of the people that were brought to camp, and how he realized that\nthat was the end of the road, so to say, that it was an extermination camp. So, he\nsomehow managed after the work to get under a cattle car and he suspended himself, I\nmean, he went under the cattle car, got a hold of the axis \u2014 whatever \u2014 and when the train\nstarted to roll out, because the trains were bringing in people, unloading and leaving the\ncamp site, going back for more transport, he got himself under the car and held on to the\nchassis and when he realized that the train was already out of the camp compound, that\nhe dropped to the ground. It was already evening, and he remained lying there on the\ntracks for a while to ascertain that nobody was around, that he was not going to be\npursued and he walked to the woods nearby, not knowing exactly where he was and\nwhich direction to take, and he just walked, and he walked mostly at night because during\nthe day he was frightened. He didn\u2019t know really, you know, what kind of a situation he\nmay be confronted with. Therefore, he walked at night which was very difficult for him\nto know exactly where he was going, but it didn\u2019t really matter. All he wanted was to\nescape, and it was, like, on the second day or the third day that he came to us and he was\nvery hungry and very thirsty and he asked for some food. We sat there, you know, we\nwere teenagers, and we watched him, and he himself wasn\u2019t much older. He must have\nbeen seventeen or eighteen years old, and he had that wild look on him, you know. We\nknew something shocking \u2014 he must have gone through something very, very shocking.\nSo, we went home and entered the house, and we told my parents that there 1s a guy there\nwho acts like crazy, and he\u2019s telling us stories that we just don\u2019t believe. So, my parents\ncame out and asked him to come in, and he sat down. They gave him some food to eat\nand then they started a conversation, and once he got into details my parents told us to\nleave. Most likely, they didn\u2019t want us to be aware or know exactly the details that were\ntaking place, you know, in camps like Treblinka. So, I would say that after this encounter\nwe kind of began to realize that something is happening, that inasmuch as living in the\nghetto was so different from the normal life that we led before, and being forced to work\nin factories was also something that we have never planned on doing, especially forced\nlabor. There was another aspect to our lives that was unpredictable that may come into\nthe picture soon, and of course, within a few months which was from August to October,\nour town has gone through the same thing. The Nazis came to liquidate our ghetto in\nStarachowice; that was in October of 1942.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember, because we were basically... We\u2019re friends. You know, like you live\nin a neighborhood so, it\u2019s summertime and you are confined always to the small\napartment. You like to be outdoors especially in the summertime. You need it and you\nwant to be with your friends. So, we were like a bunch of kids, I don\u2019t know six or seven.\nI don\u2019t know whether both of my sisters were there, one of my sisters was there, but this\nis what happened at the time, and this is how we came to know that there is a camp, an\nextermination camp, at Treblinka where they are gassing Jews.",
        "A: We kind of sensed something, but you really don\u2019t want to believe it, and it\u2019s maybe, you\nknow, a mature mind can comprehend much better then a young person. And sometimes\nin a lot of cases, even grown ups didn\u2019t want to believe. People sometimes would say,\n\u201cWell, it must have been such a shocking experience for an individual to be separated\nfrom his parents, not knowing where they are or what has happened to them that all of a\nsudden they lose their mind.\u201d So, you can\u2019t really tell. To us, the story was very, very\nstrange. You know, when you believe in humanity and you believe in goodness and you\nare brought in a way that you have to conduct yourself properly and behave in a certain\nway, those things are unbelievable because things like this were never done before, even\nif you grew up in an environment that was anti-Semitic does not mean that you were\nbeing murdered. There hasn\u2019t been such a thing before. So, considering that we were all\ntoo young yet, one on hand it seemed crazy on the other hand, it was very real, because\nthe manner he ate that potato that was given to him \u2014 I mean, we shared with him\nwhatever we had \u2014 that he was gulping it down. You could see how hungry he was.",
        "A: This, too, has been a different experience for me and my older sister than for anybody\nelse because, as I said before, we were working in a factory and that was the brick factory\nthat we were working. Usually, there were two shifts, so it was a twelve hour working\nshift, and that very day, we left for work for the night shift. So, actually what happened 1s\nthat like the day before, we left home, and went to work without knowing that that was\nthe last time that we were together as family, that it was the last time that we had seen our\nmother, and it was the last time that we functioned as a family unit, because the night of \u2014\nwhile we were in the factory, SS groups with collaborators from \u2014 they were uniformed\nLatvian soldiers \u2014 came to liquidate the ghetto. They took all the people out, chased\neverybody out of their homes into the marketplace, and there was a selection. The people\nwho had employment cards were put to one side. People who were without employment\ncards \u2014 children, and elderly and mothers \u2014 they were put to another side, and they were\nbeaten, of course, and those who remained in their homes who refused to leave the house\nwere shot to death either in their beds or at home. So, everybody was out in the\nmarketplace in the middle of the night, and my sister and myself were at work in the\nfactory. So, actually only Renia and both of my parents were there while the action took\nplace. So, the details that I know of what has happened at the time came from my sister\nRenia and from my father. The replacement for the shift on which we were did not arrive\nin the morning to the factory because they were still segregating people. Therefore, we\nhad to remain in the factory for another twelve hours of work. So, we worked that day a\ndouble shift, and we didn\u2019t know what happened. We just couldn\u2019t understand, and in the\nmorning, the factory was like on the ground floor, and on the upper levels were offices,\nand in one of the \u2014 in the office there was a school friend of mine, a Christian, a Pole,\nwho lived not far in the neighborhood and he knew the Jews are working two shifts. He\ndidn\u2019t know who was at work, and he came a little earlier and he came down and he says,\n\u201cSomething horrible happened in town. They are taking away the Jews.\u201d And, he looked\nand when I saw him, I walked over and I said, \u201cTell me what happened.\u201d So, he says,\n\u201cCome up to the window upstairs and you will see it by yourself.\u201d The window was\nfacing a railroad siding from where the cattle cars where standing and where the people\nwere brought from the marketplace, and of course, it was such a shock, when I looked out\nthe window, that I will never forget it because the people were crying, they were beaten,\nthey were chased. You could see mothers, you know, holding their babies. You could see\nmen carrying bundles on their backs, and for that fleeting moment, for that minute or two,\nwhatever, because I didn\u2019t want to jeopardize his job, and he for sure, you know,\nwouldn\u2019t want to anyone to realize that he made it possible for me to come and look out\nthe window. So, for that one moment, all I could see was like a chain of human bodies\nmoving in one direction, you know, beaten and pushed into the cars, and I was trying so\nhard to look and see whether I see a familiar face, I couldn\u2019t see anything. I just couldn\u2019t\nsee, whether it was because I was so shocked, or because I was \u2014 I mean, it was too far of\na distance for me to see, but just a feeling of that mass of people being driven and being\npushed into the cars and listen to the cries and the moaning and it was horrible. I came\nback to work \u2014 you know, we worked the conveyor, like a conveyor where we were\nplacing wet bricks on the conveyor belt and they were sent to the kiln upstairs \u2014 and I\nknew that something has taken place. I only hope that whatever has taken place, that it\nwill bring us back together. That was the morning. We came after work, they never took\nus back to the ghetto. They took us to the camp in Majowka, and there we found Father,\nand we found Renia, and Mother was not around. They just couldn\u2019t find Mother\nanywhere. But Mother was employed in an electric plant, which at the time had it\u2019s own\nfacility, like a little small barracks for the people who worked around there. So, we were\nhoping that, due to the fact that this was her place of employment, that she could have\nbeen taken to the other facility, and it took a whole week to inquire. You know, it wasn\u2019t\nso easy to make contact. It took a whole week to inquire who was sent where, you know,\nwhich camp, because there were three camps. There were the camps Strzelnica and then\nMayjowka, and this was the electric plant, which eventually, you know, they took the\npeople from the electric plant and brought them to one of the two camps. And we found\nout that Mother wasn\u2019t around. And talking to people afterwards, trying to find out what\nhappened to Mother, we were told that she had a friend who was a widow and she was all\nby herself, and she got very hysterical because she had nobody and she was so lost, and\nMother kept her company and she tried to keep her calm, and she told her \u201cDon\u2019t worry,\nI\u2019m with you. I\u2019m with you; I\u2019m going to take care of you.\u201d So, she took care of her and\nthey both went to Treblinka, just to show that she died the way she did, trying to help\nother people. This was 1942. So, she was the first victim in the family, so to say, and I\nhave difficulties to kind of understand why a person who has done so much good for\nothers has been taken away from us, and she was the first victim. We came to the camp.\nOf course, the group was not sent immediately to the camp. We had to go through\ninspection. They had to check what we had on us. Not that we carried a lot to work with\nus, but due to the fact that my parents met that young men at the time, Mother insisted,\nespecially since it was getting a little colder, that we wear three outer layers of clothes\nand good shoes that we have a good coat when we go to work because normally, she\nwouldn\u2019t have even thought about it. So, we came in and, of course, whatever we had, a\nwatch or whatever, a little ring, or whatever \u2014 what does a teenager have? \u2014 it was taken\naway from us, and we remained with the clothes at least we had, some extra clothes to\nwear and we had good shoes on our feet. So, they took away the valuables from us and\nthey placed us in different, different, in the barracks. There was barracks for men and\nthere were barracks for women, and then the following day, they separated the group,\nbecause the people who worked in the munition factories went to the camp at Strzelnica,\nwhich was much closer to the factory, while the rest of us went to Majowka, which was a\nlarger camp, and from there people were sent to many different places of employment,\nwhether they needed in the steel mill, whether they were needed in the brick factory\nwhere I was in the beginning or whether in the electric plant or wherever. So, this is \u2014 we\nwere separated. Father and I had remained in Majowka, and Hania and Renia were sent to\nStrzelnica, and as I mentioned to you that due to the fact that Father was running that\nemployment office in the ghetto, he was put in charge because he was familiar with the\nwork in Majowka, and Hania was assigned the same job in Strzelnica. Whatever Father\nwas doing in Majowka, she was running the office there and the work usually \u2014 I mean,\nthe assignment of the work came from the Jewish management, came from the Judenrat\nwhich was very, very helpful because at least, you know, we had more contact with her,\nand it was easier to maintain the contact between one camp site and the other. So, that\nwas the liquidation of the ghetto. It was such a sad sight. I must have been at the window\nfor a minute or maybe for two, but to just watch that like moving bodies, you know, a\ngroup, a chain, an unending chain, and we were \u2014 I don\u2019t know whether we were five\nthousand Jews, or - usually it was like ten percent of the population in a small town like\nours was Jewish \u2014 and Wierzbnik and Starachowice were two communities, separate\ncommunities until the consolidation. So, Wierzbnik was predominately Jewish, and I\nwould say that there must have been, I don\u2019t know, at least five thousand Jews living in\nthe community. Fortunately, because of the need for employment and the Jews were\nworking free of charge, you know. There was no pay or no compensation whatsoever for\nwork. We were magnificent cheap labor force, that a lot of people were saved from \u2014\nespecially those who were young and able to work, and survived due to the fact that from\n1942 until 1944, until the time when they took us to Auschwitz, that we were working.\nAnd of course, the mere fact that you lived in the same community and that you knew\npeople, Christians and in some cases, Christians who were willing to assist you on their\nvery own, and in some cases, Christians with whom some people left valuables, and they\nwere kind of disposing of the valuables and helping and sending to the people some extra\nfood or some clothes or whatever they needed. So, that was very helpful because those\npeople \u2014 those Jews were brought from large Lodz or from Plotsk or from the other\nplaces, in the beginning to our ghetto, they had nobody to assist them. They had nobody\nto help them. They were total strangers and they depended on the assistance of the Jewish\ncommunity, but once the Jewish community was decimated, they didn\u2019t have anyone to\nturn to.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: No, Father was \u2014 Father definitely, Father was the one who found out. I mean, I could see\n\u2014I could see how terribly, how he felt, how terribly affected he was by the loss of\nMother, and due to the fact that we weren\u2019t there, you know, sometimes I thought to\nmyself, \u201cIf we only would be there.\u201d Because when you separate men from women, and\nyou go through a selection, I can\u2019t imagine that Renia wasn\u2019t of much help to Mother,\nand she kind of depended on Mother to take care of her, and Mother was taking care of\nher friend, and Father wasn\u2019t even there to know what was happening, and I don\u2019t even\nknow in what way Renia managed to be later on in camp. I don\u2019t know, and she never\ntold me. I don\u2019t even know how this happened. I mean, it isn\u2019t like that Father was\nholding on to her and brought her with him.",
        "A: I mean, he was there, but he was on one side of the marketplace with the men, and the\nwomen were on the other side. So, every once in a while when I think about it, I feel that\nmaybe if we were there with Hania, we kind of could have managed to get her with us. I\nthink so. I don\u2019t know whether it was destiny. I don\u2019t know whether it was just meant to\nbe that way.",
        "A: Of course, we missed her. And every time I think about it, I always see it in one way: that\nI never said goodbye to my mother. Whether I was anguished, I don\u2019t know. We were \u2014\nwe had to get up in the morning and go to work, and when we came back from work, we\nhad \u2014 we just had to have a meal and go to sleep and we were lucky to have a parent, and\nin one way or another, in the beginning, I didn\u2019t give up hope. Somehow in the back of\nmy mind, I was hoping that, no matter what, that Mother is going to somehow appear.\nWe all knew \u2014 we all knew that what is happening when people are taken away from the\nghettos. We all knew, but when 1t comes to someone who is dear and you love dearly,\nyou have hopes that it\u2019s not \u2014 they did not \u2014 this kind of thing could not have happened to\nyour parent or your sibling or whoever. That maybe by some chance they wound up in a\ncamp somewhere and maybe after the war you will be reunited. From what we heard, is\nthat she was put on the train with her friend, and everybody knew that the train went\nstraight to Treblinka. So, inasmuch as, on the one hand, we knew what has happened, on\nthe other hand, in my own mind, I was still hoping that a good person like her deserves to\nlive.",
        "A: By that time, Treblinka remained a reality. I mean, it became a reality. We knew that this\nis the end of the road.",
        "A: There is no time. There is no space. There 1s no assurance that this 1s what happened, and\nthat it happened when it did happen. But one thing was certain: when the war was over\nand the people who survived from the community got together and they kind of gathered\nall the information that was available, everybody knew that the transport from\nStarachowice wound up in Treblinka. Treblinka nowadays 1s a very kind of very\nawesome place where you don\u2019t have any barracks, and you don\u2019t have any\ncrematoriums. It\u2019s just an architectural artistic, architecturally interpretation which\nreceived the prize from the Polish government, and what it consists of is huge rocks and\nlittle rocks that are supposed to represent communities from which the people were\nbrought for extermination, and there is a huge, huge stone \u2014 not a granite stone, but a\nwhatever the stone is, with the carved name on it \u201cStarachowice\u201d and it\u2019s huge. It\u2019s\nalmost up to my shoulder. And every time I go to, to Poland, I make my way to Treblinka\nwith a little flower. That stone is the only thing that I have to remember Mother, just\nremember her and remember the people who, our neighbors and our friends and\neverybody else who lived around and found the same fate as she did. So, you have to\nmake peace and you have to go on living. It\u2019s really tragic because it\u2019s not only my\nmother, but think of all the wonderful people who lived in the community and think of all\nthe little children and they did not survive the war because of the Nazi madness. [pause]\nThen, of course, we had to be confronted with another thing. We went to work every day\njust like before, but the living conditions were different. As long as we were in the ghetto,\nwe had a family life, not as comfortable as before, but still 1n all we were a family unit\nand that was very, very important. Here, we were separated. My two sisters were\nsomewhere else, and I was with my father somewhere else. We maintained our contact,\nwhich was wonderful, and due to the fact that, as I said before, we were in our hometown\nand we knew the people who were involved, who were assigned to different jobs, you\nknow, in administrating the camp, but if anything we needed very badly; they were\nalways cooperating. But, life was all together different. We lived in barracks. The food\nwas prepared in the kitchen. So, we had to have the meal whenever it was available. We\ndidn\u2019t starve, not like in Auschwitz, but we certainly get enough food, but in comparison\nwith Auschwitz, the slave labor camp, was much, much better and you kind of have to\naccept whatever the situation was like.",
        "A: No, there was like a mess hall near where the kitchen facility was, and they were\npreparing meals for people as they were coming and leaving for work, you know? So,\nthere was an advantage to that because Father was always waiting for me to return from\nwork so we could have a meal together. Inasmuch there was separate area where the\nbarracks for men were situated and the women were, it\u2019s still, you know, meals we could\nhave together. At the time, the camp, the Nazi commandants who were in charge of the\ncamps, were changing all the time. I don\u2019t know why, whether it was due to the war\neffort, or whether they were sent out to the front, or due to the fact it kind of was tied in\nwith the munition factories, and depending on the job that they had to do, you know, that\nthey were also in charge of the camp. We were guarded by Ukrainians, and the camp,\ninasmuch as it was a labor camp, was also fenced in and we had watchtowers, and the\nUkrainian guards were in the watchtowers. We were led to work always guarded by the\nUkrainians and brought back from the work. If the distance was a very long distance,\nthen they put us on trucks, and they took us to work. Otherwise, they marched us to work.\nSometimes, the camp commandant was a kinder individual. Sometimes, it was a vicious\nindividual. And in 1943, spring of 1943, a typhus epidemic broke out in the camp, and\npeople got very, very sick, and they lost a lot of people. They didn\u2019t have enough people\nto send to the factories. Inasmuch as they were bringing more people from different\nsmaller plants that they were liquidating. And I remember one day, Hania was with Renia\nin Strzelnica, and I was with my father and the epidemic broke out first in Strzelnica, and\nboth of my sisters took sick, but Renia was first. And when the camp commandant, who\nwas at the time, his name was Meir, and there was an ubershtopfuhrer (ph), who was over\nthis camp commandant. His name was Aldoph, came in one day to Strzelnica, and they\ntold everybody to leave the barracks, and whoever remained in the beds, they were\nwalking with machine guns, both of them, and shooting people who did not live the beds\nbecause they were not able to get up. And the rest, they put outside and they told the\npeople to run, and those who couldn\u2019t run were shot either shot on the spot or they were\nput on a truck and taken outside \u2014 outside of the camp to the woods and they were shot\nthere in the woods, and then buried in a mass grave. And Renia was already sick with\nfever and Hania sent her to the laundry room where there was a lot of steam, and Renia\nand another friend of Renia\u2019s who was more or less her age, the two of them were told to\ngo to the laundry room, because there nobody came in to look, and it was kind of steamy\nand hot and all that, and two days later, they told me to go over to Strzelnica because \u2014\nafter they took out the dead people, and they cleaned up the barracks, and I was told to go\nand take over the office in Strzelnica. Hania was sick and Renia was sick. So, I took care\nof the office and I took care of them. And it wasn\u2019t easy. It was not easy, but with God\u2019s\nhelp, they pulled through.",
        "A: Well...",
        "A: There wasn\u2019t that much food really, but it\u2019s water and I had the experience from taking\ncare of my mother before. So, in a way, I was familiar with the routine what to do. I think\nFather got in touch with the Paliszewskis, and they send out some medication, and so this\nhelped quite a bit. So, they got on their feet, and no sooner Hania returned back to work,\nand everything was well, I came back to Majowka, and my father took sick. So, it\u2019s from\none situation into the next. So, I took care of my father and, because he was working in\nthe office, so his quarters, his living quarters, were with the head of the administration of\nthe camp and the barber in the camp, and my father and the man who was in charge of the\nkitchen, I think, there were four or five beds in that smaller room. So, if you was in the\nbarracks, I wouldn\u2019t have been allowed to go into a regular barracks, but due to the fact\nthat he shared this small living space with other people, they wanted to keep them apart\nfrom the rest of the camp to protect them from diseases that otherwise you were\nsusceptible when you lived with a lot of people together. So, I took care of him, and there\nwas still medication left over, and that was good. And he pulled through, and I was so\npleased when the crisis was over because I was more worried about him than about my\nsisters. And I don\u2019t have to tell you that I was the last one, right?, to get sick. I must have\nbeen already like into the fourth day of my typhus fever when Father returned to work.\nAnd I slept \u2014 we had a women\u2019s barrack, and I had a friend who was also a neighbor, and\nshe was like ten or fifteen years older, and she was a very meticulous person, and she\nalways told me, \u201cI want you to be right next to me. I don\u2019t want \u2014 I don\u2019t want you to\nhave a straw sick (ph) and I don\u2019t because the bed bugs, and their lice and everything 1s\nsitting in them. You are going to be sleeping on bare boards, just like I am, so we don\u2019t\ninvite any problems or any diseases and this will keep out \u2014 this way we\u2019ll keep ourselves\nclean.\u2019 Her name was Fania Hershtein (ph), and she was really wonderful to me because\nshe kind of taught me how to survive under such circumstances, and so we had the corner\nbed on the upper level. But people were going to work, so there was not all the time the\nsame person around you, and this was the only place that you could stay. They had an\ninfirmary, but who wanted to go to the infirmary. You knew that once you are going to\ngo to the infirmary, you'll never come out, whether it was in our camp, the slave labor\ncamp, or in Auschwitz. So, I was there in that corner on that bed, and I remember the last\ntwo days of my sickness. I had a terrible throbbing in my head, and the pain was right\nhere and I felt it in my temples, and I thought that my whole head is going to just break\nopen from that pain. I was aware of what was happening because I remember what was\nbeing done to me. On the other side of the space where we slept were two sisters and they\nwere from a village not too far away, and they were working on a different shift that\nFania was working, and because I was crying that my head hurt so badly, one of the\nsisters was holding my \u2014 put her hands on my temples and was kind of pressing against\nmy temples, holding it tight, and this seemed to be relieving that throbbing, that terrible\npain, and I remember when she did it and I felt so comfortable, and that I felt so much\nbetter. And then I do not remember anything at all until the next day when, all of a\nsudden, I felt that somebody came into the barracks and pulled me out from that bed,\nfrom that spot where I slept, and put me \u2014 you see, I was like in the corner and facing the\nentrance to the barracks was a window, and there was also a bed down there. Somebody\npulled me out from the top, because I heard yelling, \u201cEverybody out of the barracks!\u201d and\nI just wasn\u2019t in a position to get out bed. I figured whatever\u2019s going to happen most likely\nwill happen, I figured. I didn\u2019t figure \u2014 I don\u2019t remember, but I remember that I did not\nleave the barracks, and somebody pulled me out and placed me somewhere else, and then\nI felt like straw sticks (ph) were being thrown on top of me. You know, it was like that\nsack filled with straw, and then I heard this German yelling, \u201cdus, aus!\u2019\u2019 That means get\nup, get out. And, then they came in most likely with bayonets and the rifles because I\ncould hear above me that poking in the spaces to make sure that nobody is around, and\nthen I could hear some poking in front of me, around me, but I didn\u2019t \u2014 nobody hit me\nand nobody hurt me. And, when the day was over, the following day, and I felt better and\nI was aware of what \u2014 I was told of what took place, that it\u2019s the same thing as in\nStrzelnica, that people were shot, those who couldn\u2019t run fast enough, and were taken\naway to be shot in the woods. I just couldn\u2019t figure out what happened. About eight years\nago, a guy from Israel came for a visit to Vineland, and he was in charge of a federation\nproject. It was a sister city of Vineland that we were supporting in Israel, and his children\nwere also very involved in the rehabilitation of the community. So, he was brought to\nVineland to speak about what was accomplished with the money that Vineland\ncommunity was sending to Israel, and he came with the chairman of the campaign here to\nus because, once he knew that it was Vineland and I live in Vineland, he says, \u201cI\nremember Rozka Laks. I would like to see her.\u201d So, you know, when they discussed that\nwhole idea in Israel, so he was promised that when he comes to Vineland, he\u2019s going to\nsee me. We were sitting at the table. I had served coffee and cake, and his name is\nPenhurst Hoffnitz (ph). Unfortunately, he passed away three years ago. And he turns to\nme and he says like this, \u201cDo you remember,\u201d he says, \u201cduring that typhus period in the\ncamp when they came to Majowka and they told everybody to leave the barracks and you\nwere So sick?\u201d he says. \u201cI came to look for my sister, and I saw you, and I pulled you off\nthat bed and I placed you on the lower bed, hoping that you will be much safer in front of\nthe window than somewhere in the corner hiding.\u201d Now, this revelation was something. I\nmean, in front of Miles and in front of the local chairman of the JA Campaign. It was\nsuch an unbelievable story. I knew that somebody had done something for me, but I\nnever knew who the person was, and it was Penhurst, and I didn\u2019t know about it until he\ncame to the United States. So, those are situations beyond one\u2019s control, without even\nknowing why they happen, how they happen, and in what circumstances they are. I don\u2019t\nknow, I have many interpretations when I think about it. When I think about Mother and\nher dedication and work for Israel, and this being connected with federation and Israel, I\njust don\u2019t know. I really don\u2019t want to get that mystical. But, I'll never forget it. I mean\nthis 1s such an eye-opener. So many people used to ask me, you know, after the war,\nmany people asked me, \u201cSo, who was the person who did it?\u201d I can\u2019t remember, but\nsomebody did it, and it was Penhurst, and you know, it just came out so naturally. He\nsays, \u201cDo you remember?\u201d So, when people say, \u201cHow did you survive?\u201d Now, how do\nyou explain what survival meant? There are no words to describe, I mean, why and how.\nAnd in what way, whether it was up to a total stranger or to a friend. When I think about\nit, | always feel that there must have been like an angel, a guardian angel watching over\nus that kept us together all three sisters throughout. I mentioned last time about Fela \u2014\nFela Berlant (ph), who made it possible for us to be transferred from Auschwitz to better\nworking conditions. Now, Fela Berlant was a Jewish girl from home, and she didn\u2019t\nreally know us from Adam before, and it just happened so that she made it possible to\ntake us from the worst conditions where we were almost, so to say, reaching a point of\ntotal starvation and give us \u2014 place us \u2014 in a situation for the next three months that made\nus feel like human beings all over again, that gave us self esteem all over again, gave us\nthe opportunity to kind of go on with what was meant to become \u2014 with the things that we\nwere confronted with in the following months, and so it\u2019s destiny, maybe, or for sure.\nEnd of Tape #5\nTape #6",
        "A: Well, Father was, so to say, the head of the family like in most European homes, and he\nwas a disciplinarian. He was a very meticulous individual \u2014 everything had to be just\nperfect with him. He didn\u2019t spend much time with us when we were younger. So,\nbasically, I only thought of him as a parental figurehead, you know, that is a parent. That\nwe have certain responsibility as children, and he has responsibilities of a father. So, the\ntime we spent together \u2014 I mean, the time that we experienced as children, speaking of\nparents were more so with my mother than with Dad. Father was away a lot from home,\nand when he came home he was busy also preparing the work that he was doing. And\nalso, we were much too young for him to really be involved with us. When we got a little\nolder, I said he was in the free time that he had with us, we were singing and we were\nharmonizing and we were discussing things, you know, because we were a little older, he\nalways wanted to know what we are reading and he was kind of interested more so in our\ndevelopment as people rather than to give us guidance. It\u2019s Mother who did the job. And,\nit was during the job when we were together especially in Majowka where I was with\nhim, that I could see him as a person, as a person who has the patience and who does care\nand who was loving, and who was concerned with our well-being and on occasion he\nmentioned Mother, I remember. But I\u2019m sure that it must have been very painful for him\nto speak about it. I used to always say to him that we\u2019ll find Mother, Dad, don\u2019t worry.\nWe\u2019 ll find her somewhere. She must be somewhere. So, I don\u2019t know whether I believed\nin it or whether it was just that hope, but this could have kind of encouraged him to on\noccasion speak about it. He was very, very busy because he had a very responsible job.\nPeople were dying, and people were sick, and some people were shot, and he had to\nprovide the work force every morning, regardless of how many people were available. It\nwas his responsibility. So, it\u2019s not like under normal circumstances where you get up in\nthe morning and there you go out and the people were waiting to go to work. Every once\nin awhile there were five missing, ten missing and he had to find them, you know? And\nthen, of course, he had to discuss those things with the administration of the camp, the\nJewish administration of the camp, and they in turn discussed it most likely with the Nazi\nauthorities and when there was a shortage of people, people were being brought from\nother camps to Starachowice, to Majowka or Strzelnica. When the transports came, and a\nfew hundred people at a time, and he had to get everything ready for the following\nmorning because there was really, there were a few hundred people. There was really a\nshortage in manpower that I used to be with him in the office until very late to make sure\nthat he concluded his work, because cross-indexing the files and putting everything in\nplace and who arrived and from where and who was gone and, you know, it wasn\u2019t easy\nfor just one person to do it. So, in addition to the work that I have been doing, I have been\nalso helping him to the extent that I could. So, I had this comfort of being around him and\nto really get to know him. He was just a wonderful person, and because I kind of was\noptimistic about Mother being somewhere in life, that we\u2019ll someday be reunited, I guess\nmaybe it was a comfort not only for me, but for him as well. We didn\u2019t have much time\nfor fun or anything like that, but the moments that we had together were very, very\nimportant. You also mentioned something about culture or spending culturally the time in\ncamp. Another kind of a semi-private facility was of the dentist, where he had his\nequipment that he brought from the ghetto \u2014 actually from his office from before the war\n\u2014 and all he had really was that drill that was operated with a pedal; it wasn\u2019t electric.\nAnd a chair, of course, and he didn\u2019t fill cavities, but if you had a toothache, he pulled the\ntooth out and that was it. So, he had this office in one barracks, a separate area. I think it\nwas not far from the other barracks where my father was. And next to it, he had his living\nquarters. So, in the evening on occasion, when we felt the need for some kind of a\ncultural thing, that was the best place to meet. So, we used to there to his office, and he\nhad a friend, a very lovely lady. No, she was his wife! Right, Leona was his wife. And we\nused to get together and there were people who were singing, and there were people who\nwere reciting poetry. So, on occasion we used to have like an evening of this nature.\nThere was a fellow, I don\u2019t know where he was from, but he was \u2014 whether he had a\nsinging voice or not, I don\u2019t know, but he was whistling \u201cZigeunerweisen\u2019, not singing \u2014\nbut to a point that every note was perfect, just from the whistling. The whole thing from\nbeginning to end, and that was the biggest treat of all because the music you are familiar\nwith \u201cZigeunerweisen\u2019\u2019? It\u2019s a very sentimental song. \u201cZigeunerweisen\u201d means gypsy\nairs, so actually there is a nostalgia for the freedom of being out in the open, you know,\nthe life of gypsies. So, there is this beautiful music, there is the longing for the open\nspaces, and it was to me \u2014 it was just like putting myself into a dream world without\ndreaming of something beautiful. There was no future whatsoever. If we could not dream,\nor if we could not think of pleasant things, we would not have survived. Some people\nwere thinking forever about a good meal. Some people had different things on their mind.\nMost people were thinking about the family they lost, and still to be able not to give up\nhope and to dream was one of the important aspects of survival. So, those evenings were\nvery, very important. We couldn\u2019t do them too often. We had to be very comfortable with\nourselves and knowing that whoever was in charge, the commandant, whether he was a\nUkrainian \u2014 in most cases a Ukrainian \u2014 or the commandant in charge of the camp\nguards, I mean, that even if he were to come in, that he would not get angry and disperse,\nmake sure that we are punished in one way or another. So, some of them came in and\nthey just sat around and listened.",
        "A: I would say twenty, thirty people.",
        "A: Right. Right.",
        "A: Well, it goes like this. [Sings on \u2018la\u2019.] And so on and so on. I mean, I just love it. It\u2019s one\nof my favorite songs.",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t.",
        "A: I have bad dreams now. I don\u2019t remember, but I have the bad dreams now.",
        "A: I have bad dreams now a lot of times. I wake up and I scream \u201cMomma\u201d. I mean, that\u2019s\nthe first thing. I usually wake up, I sit up in the bed, and I scream \u201cMomma,\u201d but it takes\nme so much to bring it out that I must be going through tortures before I bring it out.\nOnce I bring it out, then I\u2019m awake. I dream about running away from dangerous\nsituations. I feel I\u2019m being chased by the Nazis. But for one strange reason, I\u2019m always\nrunning with my two little children, with Jeanette and David as little children in my arms.\nI can\u2019t interpret it in any way as feeling that I have to protect my children as a parent\nfrom a dangerous situation, but basically it was my fears of the Nazis that my children\ndid not have to be involved. It\u2019s maybe because, knowing that the responsibility of a\nparent is to guard your own children, so this is why I\u2019m always running. Quite often, you\nknow, when people in the beginning used to ask me how come I don\u2019t have any more\nchildren, in a joking way I used to say, \u201cBecause I only have two arms.\u201d If I had a few\nmore arms, maybe I would have more children, but for running away from difficult\nsituations when I am threatened with being in camp or being \u2014 that Nazis are always after\nme, I\u2019m running with my kids, two little kids.",
        "A: No. You don\u2019t feel tired when you\u2019re in situations like that. You are driven. You are\ndriven because you are driven because \u2014 actually, because you are driven physically by\nwhoever supervisors the work because you have to make sure that everything 1s done on\ntime. If you fall behind, you either punished or there is another whatever outcome of the\nsituation \u2014 in most cases punishment or beating or whatever. And when you are young, I\nthink that you can manage a lot easier with difficult situations than when you are older. I\ncould see that women who were five or ten years older, no more, let\u2019s say we were fifteen\nor sixteen, they were twenty or twenty-five and they were already married or had a\nfamily, and the family was taken away from them, that they did not have that drive to\nsurvive. Especially when they were alone, if they didn\u2019t know what happened to the rest\nof the family. For them, life was very, very difficult, very difficult, and the working\nconditions were very bad. People used to work in front of machines in heat that was\nburning through their garments. We couldn\u2019t get other things to wear. Food wasn\u2019t\nadequate. Bed bugs were all over. They were falling off the ceiling in the middle of the\nnight with like parachutes. Lice were on your body and in your clothes, in the seams of\nyour clothes \u2014 no matter how hard you tried to maintain a certain degree of hygiene, you\ncouldn\u2019t manage. So, you tried your very best. We had like long troughs with running\nwater in the barracks and outside of the barracks. So, during the summertime, we used to\nwash ourselves outdoors because it was so much better, but in the wintertime we used to\nbring the \u2014 I don\u2019t think that we had the running troughs in the barracks, but we had a pan\nof water and we used to wash ourselves and on occasion if anybody had contact with the\noutside, because when went to work in the factory, you met with the Christian population\nof the town, and there were people who maybe weren\u2019t willing to give you outright\nsomething as a gift, but they were willing to take a message to someone who was willing\nto help you and by getting something in return they would bring it to you to the factory.\nAnd some people even if they didn\u2019t know you at all, but they felt that if it can help you\nthat they were willing to do it as well. So, there were all kinds of different situations. So,\non occasion you had a piece of soap and so you could launder your undergarments and\nkeep yourself clean that way. What we used to do 1s when we worked on the night shift in\nthe summertime, we used to sleep outdoors instead of in the barracks during the day\nbecause \u2014 in the summertime only, not in the winter, of course, it was cold. But, we came\nback from work in the morning. So, we took a blanket or whatever was there on the bed\nand spread it out outdoors on the grass, right under the fence and we slept outdoors. So, at\nleast we didn\u2019t have to cope with the bedbugs. It was better sleep and we got some\nsunshine on our bodies, got a suntan free of charge.",
        "A: Smell what?",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No. We had to be very quiet because once you entered the barracks, everybody was tired.\nEverybody had to sleep after a day\u2019s work. I mean, I used to go to sleep on occasion and\nif my father needed me I was always ready.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Not too often.",
        "A: Not too often.",
        "A: For about a year, and then they \u2014 the situation was constantly changing depending on\nwhere they needed the labor force. So eventually, they eliminated completely the electric\nplant. They eliminated completely the brick factory, and they were concentrating mainly\non the ammunition aspect of it, because the main production was the manufacture of\nshells for \u2014 anti-aircraft shells and, you know, the very large shells. So, the men worked\nwith the big shells, and the women, you know, they had to be cut \u2014 I don\u2019t know how to\nsay it in English \u2014 but they were placed like in a machine that was sized to the millimeter\nand there was like \u2014 it was turning the metal shell for the exact size to file it down to\nperfection, and this is was what women were doing. Also, women were working on the\npremises in camp, you know, cleaning the barracks, taking care of the laundry \u2014 not\npersonal laundry, but whatever, you know, the kitchen stuff and all that, and for example,\nlater on, when I stopped going to the factory, to the brick factory, and I was helping\nFather quite often, he used to send me to work wherever there was a shortage of people. I\nmean, I was the standby \u2014 wherever another person was needed and he didn\u2019t have it. So,\nthis is how I was filling in, and because of that I had a very nice, very pleasant experience\none time. It was like maybe two weeks before they send us to Auschwitz, an order came\nfrom the office \u2014 from the factory main office \u2014 that they needed someone who knows\nhow to type. Father didn\u2019t have a typist on hand to send to the factory. So, he says to me,\n\u201cT would like you to go because it\u2019s for a day until the find someone. They need a typist\nfor tomorrow.\u201d So, he says, \u201cWhatever you do will be all right. I have to send a person.\u201d\nSo, I go with the group in the morning to work and they tell me where to go, and I come\nin and I enter this room and it has like in a classroom, small desks, and in front there is\nlike a glassed in area and there 1s this head of the office. I don\u2019t know who he was, I\nnever saw him in my life, in uniform you know \u2014 a Nazi \u2014 and I come in and I\u2019m very\nstrange and I don\u2019t know where to go, and the guard who brought me in is taking me to\nthe front right in front of the glassed in office, and there\u2019s this huge, huge type machine,\nand with paper inserted in it and all that, and as I walk, I can hear like people call my\nname, and I turn here, there is a friend from school, there is a friend from school. I just\ndidn\u2019t know whether it was real or not, and I come to that big typewriter and the German\ncomes out and he says to me do I know how to type, and I tell him yes, I do. And, he tells\nme that I have to prepare all this for today. So, I sat down, and fortunately he wasn\u2019t there\nfor too long, you know, he just came to organize the work and make sure that everybody\nis at their desks, and I worked. I don\u2019t know how good I was or how bad I was. It was\nonly for one day, so I never returned. But during a break, those two guys with whom I\nwas in high school came running to me and they threw me up in the air. I mean, from\nhappiness, they just picked me up and threw me like a ball, and they said, \u201cYou are alive.\nHow wonderful to see you!\u201d Now, you will ask me the names of those guys. There isn\u2019t a\nsingle name I remember. I only remember that in the very back, at the last desk in that\nroom, was my professor who taught me Latin. I couldn\u2019t stand his guts, and I don\u2019t think\nhe liked me either, and he wanted to fail me because I didn\u2019t like him. He was teaching\nhistory for one year and then he was teaching Latin. And every professor in school liked\nme a lot and they saw a potential in me, and he always looked for the negative, and he\nalways said that I am not a sincere student. And everybody else... None of the professors\nwhere really as vindictive when it came to an exam as he was. I remember when \u2014 every\nonce in a while he\u2019d ask questions, especially vocabulary, new words \u2014 so, when I got up,\nhe used to keep people for two minutes, for three minutes. He used to keep me sometimes\nfor fifteen minutes. He kept me as long as I couldn\u2019t give him an answer. I used to come\nhome and cry and Mother would say, \u201cLook, the only way to overcome this is for you to\nbe very, very prepared, not just prepared. There is nothing because if he made up his\nmind that he\u2019s going to fail you, you better be prepared for it.\u201d His name was Kaifash\n(ph), this I remember, his name I\u2019ll remember forever, and he was sitting there in the\nback, and I hadn\u2019t given him the courtesy to even say hello or look at him. Well, he was\njust awful. Even the director of the Gymnasium liked me a lot and he was so helpful in\ngetting me tutoring jobs and everything, and everybody believed in me. Just this one he\nwanted to fail me. So, I don\u2019t want to say he was anti-Semite maybe he had a different \u2014\nwhatever. Anyhow, he was the one that I wasn\u2019t even excited to see, but with the other\ntwo fellows, it was just so wonderful. And of course after that day, I never came back to\nthis particular place of employment because most likely it was only a temporary kind of a\nneed for whatever it was for the job, and a week later the camp was closed completely.\nThere was a breakout from the camp at night. People tried to escape because, once they\nclosed the camp, we knew that we are not going to be going to work anymore. So, young\npeople cut through the fence and cut the fence and tried to get it out, and in a very short\nwhile the watchtowers noticed it, and they threw all the reflectors in that direction and\nthey were shooting and a lot of people were killed, a lot of people escaped, but we lived\nin a very wooded area where the reactionary Polish partisan groups were operating, and\nJewish escapees had hardly a chance to survive, and those who were caught not only\nwere they pursued by the Nazis and the Ukrainian guards, but the Poles hardly gave a\nsympathetic ear to the place of the Jews and they were sending them away if they did not\nturn them over to the Nazis, so a lot of people lost their lives this way. Quite a number\nsurvived. Among them was my future brother-in-law, Hania\u2019s husband, who was able to\nmake it and he joined the partisan group and he survived the war.",
        "A: No, Victor is my other one.",
        "A: They were from the same town.",
        "A: No. It just, of course, people knew. If\u2014 As I mentioned to you before, we lived in the\nsame community. So, there were contacts to be made, whether contacts for extra food, or\ncontacts for a garment, for a coat or a pair of shoes, or whatever. There were also contact\nwith underground activities, and that Zydowska Organizacja Bojowa, JOB, what they\ncalled it, the Jewish Fighting Organization, was operating at the time after the uprising of\nthe Warsaw ghetto because this was already the end of 1943. So, they were reaching out\nto different camps to let the people know what is happening and not to give in and if you\nhave any way of survival, I mean, any way of escaping from camp, that this is something\nthat you should do, and there\u2019s no doubt in my mind that there were people who knew\nwhat was going on because even the group from Krakow that I knew \u2014 Vushka\nLiebeskind (ph) and her husband was one of those people that were involved with the\nunderground activities \u2014 and their main job was sending out messenger to still existing\nJewish communities, whether it was in camps or in forced labor camps or even in\nAuschwitz, they were trying to make contact with those people and tell them to try to\nescape because this is the only way, and they were very instrumental in even sending\nfalse documents if you provided for them a photograph, they send a document for you. I\nremember, when we were asked to send photographs to \u2014 I mean, to make sure that we\nhave photographs for documents, and I remember somehow I managed for all of us to\nhave photographs taken and I had given it to somebody, but it was such a short period\nfrom the time when there was the breakout at camp and two weeks later, when they put\nus on the train to take us to Auschwitz, that we never received the documents. When I\nthink back about it, I\u2019m not so sure if we would have really tried to escape. Knowing that\nFather is somewhere else, that he was not with us \u2014 if it was just the three of us, maybe it\nwould have been a different situation, although for one person it was a lot easier than for\nthree \u2014 but having Father in addition to it who, always being male was always away, a\ndistance away, sometimes a greater distance, and sometimes a very short distance, but\nnever together, that this would have been a good decision. And in July of 1944, they took\nus to Auschwitz because by then the Russian troops were already on the other side of the\nVistula River and, of course, it was... by then they were liquidating most of the camps\nthat were still in existence. Majdanek was already liberated, and the world I\u2019m sure\nbecame aware of the atrocities that were committed in camps, and we were never told\nthat we were going to Auschwitz, we just were loaded on trains and to an unknown\ndestination.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yes. Father is in one with the men, and we are with the women.",
        "A: No, close to eighteen by then. So, Father is, I think, Father was born in 1892? They were\nmarried \u2014 he was an adult during the Second \u2014 First World War. So, I imagine\nsomewhere around there.",
        "A: He could have been what, forty-five, fifty.",
        "A: Fifty. Right. Fifty. Something like that, right.",
        "A: No, it\u2019s not that we put it out. We knew that there is no way out for us anymore. And no\nmatter where we were, whether we were in this camp or whether we were to be taken to\nanother camp \u2014 because up to this point for whenever we were \u2014 when we were in\nStarachowice, whenever a group was brought from a different camp to us, they were to\ndo exactly what we did, so we thought that this was the way, that if we are transferred to\nanother camp, we will be taken out of the familiar environment where we had still some\nhelp from the outside, to a totally strange environment, that things will definitely get\nworse, but it will be again a slave labor camp. We did not know yet at this point that\npeople who are working are exterminated. We only knew that people \u2014 those who were\ntaken to Treblinka or those who were taken to Belzec \u2014 that those people were\nexterminated.",
        "A: Well, we knew from that man who came in 1942.",
        "A: We knew where the Russians were because there was an uprising in Warsaw, the Polish\nuprising, not the uprising in the ghetto, but the Polish population. They were hoping that\nthe Russians are going to cross the river. And when we were brought to Auschwitz in\nJuly 1944, within three weeks there were a lot of Christian Poles who were brought from\nWarsaw to Auschwitz, and as a matter of fact, that was the first time when in there were a\nlot of Christian Poles in Birkenau, because up until that time they were mostly political\nprisoners, and they were placed, the men in particular, in Auschwitz. They were\ninterrogated in Auschwitz. They were killed in Auschwitz. They worked in Auschwitz.\nOnly women were in separate part of Birkenau of which I had mentioned before that we\nworked for a brief period, for three months. But a large group of Polish Christian women\nfrom the ghetto \u2014 not ghetto, but the Warsaw uprising was brought to Birkenau at the\ntime, which was August, end of August into September, and from them, we found out\nwhat was happening.",
        "A: I couldn\u2019t tell towards the end. I don\u2019t really \u2014 I would say that there was either one\ncarload of women or two maybe twice as many for men.",
        "A: Of course, there was always more men than women in camp.",
        "A: No. I would say maybe women represented one-half, not one half of total, but let\u2019s say if\nwe were to categorize a group as a whole, I would say, like, one-third and two-thirds, that\nkind of thing.",
        "A: Well, I remember it in so many different ways. I remember \u2014 I mean, I don\u2019t know what\nhappened to other people, but I remember very well what happened to me. We were not\nallowed to \u2014 I mean, we\u2019re closed up and the people who tried to escape were either \u2014\nsome of them were killed on one side of the fence, some were killed on the other side of\nthe fence, some were killed in the woods. And the rest of us had remained in camp, and\nthere was a woman whose husband worked in the infirmary, and she was with us, and\nthey were from Plotzk or from another town. There was a husband and a wife, and he was\neither a doctor \u2014 he had some knowledge of medicine because he was working in the\ninfirmary. So, I really don\u2019t know if he was a doctor or he was not a doctor. And he came\nto the barracks \u2014 that was thing about the slave labor camp: on occasion they allowed you\nto go to see the family, you know, if there was a husband and a wife, or a brother and a\nsister, or whatever. So, he comes in. It was like two days prior to taking the transport to\nAuschwitz of which we don\u2019t know anything, I mean, where we were destined to go. He\ncomes in and he brings to his wife a vial with cyanide, and he pulls out of the pockets\nseveral vials and he says to me, \u201cI don\u2019t know where we are going, but I know for sure\nthat we are going to die,\u201d he says. \u201cNow, I brought it for anyone who wants it. I am going\nto use it myself. I am going to give it to my wife. If you want one, you can have it.\u201d It\nwas a little thing, you know. And I remember, I couldn\u2019t \u2014 I just \u2014 it didn\u2019t register\nimmediately, and I thought, \u201cWhat is he talking about? What do I need that for?\u201d And,\nthen I say, \u201cNo, no thank you. I don\u2019t want it.\u201d And it\u2019s not because I wanted to live. It\u2019s\nnot because I knew better. It\u2019s because I knew that I cannot do away with myself if I have\na father and I have two sisters. And here I had an opportunity and people did take their\nlives in the cattle cars on the way to Auschwitz.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t see it, but from the people that we met after the war, when they started to talk\nabout this one and that one and this one. But here I was given the outright opportunity to\nhave that little vial with cyanide in it.",
        "A: I have no idea. I don\u2019t think so. I wanted to live. I wanted to live in the worst possible\nway. I was young and I never gave up the idea that somewhere, somehow there is a future\nfor us. I believed so strongly, and I think this is what really gave us this courage to\nmanage in the worst situations. In that world of helplessness and hopelessness, if you did\nnot have that desire, 1t just \u2014 you just gave in and that was it. It \u2014 you needed courage for\nthat. I feel that the courage that I had was from my two sisters and I think that they had\nthis responsibility. We all had this responsibility for one another, all the time. And, it\u2019s\nnot \u2014 it\u2019s this being together, and worrying about another, because once we got off the\ntrain in Auschwitz, when we were brought \u2014 we were told to step out of the cattle cars\nand we stood there on the ramp \u2014 it wasn\u2019t a big transport. It was a small group of people.\nAnd being a working unit, not a group, a transport from a ghetto that was liquidated, they\nmost likely felt that they are going to utilize us as labor force in Auschwitz, as well. We\nwere not destined immediately to go to the gas chamber. So, Father stepped out and his\ncar was like the car, the last car, and ours was the first car, where the women were. So we\nwere separated, and I still remember waving to Father, saying goodbye, and he was\nwaving to us. It was such a strange encounter coming to Auschwitz. It was just so awful.\nWe were traveling for about two days. We had several stops because every time a\nmilitary train had to go by and they needed the tracks, they put us on the side track in\nsmall communities. We never knew where we were until finally, we came in. We pulled\ninto a brightly lighted area, and it was like the middle of the night or a little later, and\nthere was always such a mist around Auschwitz because it was - you know, there was a\nlot of humidity. So, we couldn\u2019t see the fences or the electrically charged poles, but all\nwe could see was the big, big light and the mist, a mist all around. The mist was kind of\nlike in a dream. You didn\u2019t \u2014 you saw shapes, but yet you couldn\u2019t see them clearly, and\nnot until daybreak did they take us out \u2014 I mean, they opened the doors and we left the\ncattle cars, and they took us to the barracks. No, before they took us to the barracks, of\ncourse, we had to go through the routine. So, we took our \u2014 all we had, like a little\nknapsack that they let us carry, because that\u2019s all we came with. It\u2019s not like we were\ncoming from home like most of the transports that they brought a lot of personal\nbelongings. We came from a camp. We didn\u2019t have much. So, it was like a knapsack or\nsomething very small where we carried a few personal things, and they brought us to this\nhuge room, I remember, and there were the girls at one desk for registration, and then at\nthe next desk the girls who were tattooing the number, and then there was the next desk\nwhere they were shaving or cutting hair. So, first we went through this \u2014 I mean, we went\nthrough this routine. We had to say where we came from and our names, our age, and\neverything, and this is how the process started. From your name, you become a number.\nSo, they tattooed this number on my arm, and we stood all three one behind the other, and\nit was A14176 for my older sister Hania, 1t was A14177 for me, and it was A14178 for\nRenia. Now, after the war, we found out that the A was a new series, because the\nnumbers were so tremendous by then, that they couldn\u2019t manage anymore. So, they\nintroduced the A and then they introduced the B, I think, for the men, when they\nintroduced the A for the women. We always stood next to one another. So, therefore, now\nif we \u2014 just in case we forget which number is ours, we have on following the next one.",
        "A: Yes. I remember. So, this was the next stage. And I was very, very upset, and I just didn\u2019t\nknow, and I started to cry. I started to cry and the girl who was tattooing the number held\nmy skin tight, and she says, \u201cI\u2019m going to give you such a pretty number,\u201d she says, \u201cthat\nyou'll never regret that you had it.\u201d Because, if you remember, some people had their\nnumber right here on this side of the arm, and the numbers are so big that they start at the\nelbow and end at the wrist, because in those days, people who were tattooing weren\u2019t\nexperienced enough. When we came, which was still towards the end, it was July 1944,\nthe people who \u2014 the women who worked at certain jobs, they were very, very\nexperienced. So, this was the next thing. From there, we went to the benches where they\nwere cutting hair and shaving hair, depending on the individual. I mean, they stood with\nclippers and they also had scissors, and here I am crying, and the girl who puts me down\non the bench and she pushes my hair back, and she says, \u201cDon\u2019t cry. \u2019'm not going to\nshave your head. I'll just cut it short.\u201d So, my hair wasn\u2019t cut short \u2014 I mean, my hair was\ncut short, kind of cropped because I had very long hair. My sister was so gorgeous. She\nhad such beautiful waving hair. She was just such a beautiful, beautiful woman \u2014 girl, and\nthey cut her hair short and Renia has always curly hair so whatever they did was okay.\nAnd as my older sister gets up from the bench, there was a door with a glass in it, and she\nwalked by and she kind of put her hand on her hair and kind of pushed a wave in place,\nand there was a German guard right behind her. He grabbed her by the collar and he put\nher down back on the bench and he said to the girl who was cutting hair, \u201cShave it off.\u201d\nSo, there she is. She had her hair short, and because she dared to look at herself, to see\nlike any human being when there 1s a change that\u2019s coming about you, that you want to\nsee what it looks like, so for this, she had her hair cut \u2014 I mean, shaven. Now, from there,\nwe had to leave everything behind.\nEnd of Tape #6\nTape #7",
        "A: Shave it.",
        "A: Right. It was not a mirror. It was just like a glass in a door that was open, and you could\nsee the reflection in it. And he grabbed her with such anger and sat her down back on the\nbench and he said, \u201cShave her head.\u201d So, her is the beautiful girl who is tall and\nattractive, and the hair is the crown of her, so to say, and she\u2019s completely without hair.\nSo, we are pushed from this point into the next room which 1s the shower room. Now, we\ndon\u2019t know where we are going. We heard stories about gas chambers. We never knew\nwhat they looked like. Nobody could describe what a gas chamber was like inside. We\nonly knew stories that people are being gassed and that they are shower heads to make\nbelieve that it\u2019s a shower room. So, from this point, we are driven into that room with\nshower heads in it. If I remember correctly, we have to undress right then, or maybe\nbefore, right after the registration when we reached the next step. It\u2019s not quite vivid in\nmy head, you know, and we had to be undressed.",
        "A: At the time only the hair, hair was cut, nothing else, and then we were without clothes,\nwhich means that either we had to undressed right before entering or maybe before the\nhair being cut. It seems to me right before entering. And we entered that room where the\nshower heads, and all of a sudden, you know, while we were inside, the cold water came\nfrom above and it was really very, very cold and we all screamed because it was just\npiercing through your body, and the water didn\u2019t run too long, and we forced out of this\narea into the next area, and there we came to a large room and there were women sitting\nbehind a huge table with all kinds of dresses piled up on top of the table, and you were\nnot handed a garment to wear. Things were thrown at you. So, each of us received a\ndress, a print dress. They did not have uniforms at the time that we arrived. I don\u2019t think\nthey were giving out uniforms anymore. There were so much clothes that was confiscated\nfrom the transport of the arriving people who were put to the gas chambers that they\ndidn\u2019t see any need for uniforms anymore. So, they threw dresses at us. And those were\ninmates, those were girls who were working there in the sauna, in that shower room. We\nnever \u2014 as I mentioned before, size \u2014 there was never a question of whether it was your\nsize, the right size, the wrong size. So, no sooner did we get our clothes thrown at us, if\nsomebody was tall and had a very short dress while another person was very short and\nhad a long dress, and someone was very skinny and had a big dress or vice versa, a\nheavier women a very tightly fitting dress, that we were exchanging among one another,\nwith each other, so that at least we made those things fit. They were smelly dresses\nbecause all they did is they took the discarded clothes and they put it in \u2014 they had such\nhuge vats with disinfectant fluid in it. I don\u2019t think they ever washed the dresses. I think\nthat all they did was they soaked them in that and then they dried them because I\nremember that the dress was kind of damp, whether it was damp because it wasn\u2019t dried\nenough or whether it was damp because the dampness was always there and it was lying\nsomewhere, you know, where it didn\u2019t dry out completely. I don\u2019t know, but we didn\u2019t\nget any undergarments whatsoever. The only thing we have gotten was just a dress to\nwear and nothing else. They allowed us to wear the shoes that we brought with us. Now,\nin most cases, we recognize each other. I couldn\u2019t find Hania. Not only that she didn\u2019t\nlook the way I knew her to look and to be, she was wearing a crazy print dress and\nbecause she had no hair whatsoever and she was very tall and very slim. So, it was like a\npin, a long stem with a head, a small head on top. It was heartbreaking to see that\ntransformation that only was like within a half hour no more, from such a beautiful girl\nthat she was, so attractive and so pretty, to see such a pathetic looking creature. I mean it\nwas just horrible. It was just horrible, my heart was breaking, and we were handed\n[coughs] Excuse me. We were handed like white pieces of cloth with the number that was\nprinted on our arms, and under that white cloth with the number was a triangle. In our\ncase, 1t was a yellow because it was for the Jewish prisoners. So, my number A14177,\nand we had to sew it on, on the garment, and the dresses also had a big, red, wide stripe\non the back. From this point on, we were taken to the barracks, but all morning was\nbasically from the unloading of the train and going through the process until we were\nbrought to the barracks.",
        "A: It was a big room. It was a big room. There were people in there, and the fear of the\nunknown when you come into something that you are not familiar with and you don\u2019t\nknow what to expect. So, basically if you are there with other people around you, you\nonly see that far, and nothing beyond. I don\u2019t think that it was in anybody\u2019s mind to stand\nthere and try to figure out, you know, the size of the room or whatever it is. We were\nafraid as we entered. We were frightened by the blast of cold water that came on us. It\nstopped just as fast as it came. So, basically it was a big shock to the mind and to the\nbody simulatenously, you know, because first you don\u2019t know what to expect and then\nthe big shock of that icy cold water coming at you. That was the way we were brought to\nthe barracks, and more or less on our way from the sauna to the barracks, sized up the\nsituation \u2014 what the camp looks like. I mentioned before that we arrived and it was dark\nand between the mist and the lights, you really couldn\u2019t figure out where you were. In\ndaytime, it was a sunshiny day so we could see that there were different areas fenced in,\nwhich meant that there were different sections of the camp. We were also passing by an\narea where there were men. A lot of people during the day when the saw others moving\nalong the roads, they used to come close to the fences to look whether they will spot\nsomeone who is familiar or whatever, and we were brought to the barracks, where Fela\nBerlant (ph) was the schreiberen, and she, of course, counted the group, accepted the\ngroup, made sure that everything was in order, you know, and they brought us to the\ndesignated part of the barracks that our group was to occupy, and we were told so-and-so\nmany women to a space, and that was it. Now, there was no official introduction of what,\nhow and when because this was a very simple thing, you know. Towards the end of the\nday we heard the voice of the woman who was in charge of \u2014 the assistant to the\nbarracks\u2019 Alteste, the girl in charge of the barracks, her assistant, to Zdhlappel, to get out\nof the barracks, outside for counting, and counting was twice a day, in the morning and in\nthe evening, before we had to return back to the barracks. In the beginning, they kept us\nfor a whole month in a quarantine, as if to say that we were bringing some kind of disease\nfrom the outside, to protect the people who were on the inside. It was ridiculous.",
        "A: No, that whole barracks was for all the people. Some of them must have arrived earlier\nthan \u2014 a few weeks or a few days or whatever earlier \u2014 because we were only placed in\none small section, and the barracks were divided in four sections. There were bunk beds.\nThere were aisles and bunk beds in each side. In the middle was a small stove with a\npipe, and then to the sides, there were like four wings, and each wing had an aisle and\nthere were bunk beds on both sides. So, we were taken, as we entered the barracks to the\nright, the first aisle. This is where the whole group was placed.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: No, we were allowed to go outside, and we weren\u2019t working the first two weeks. We\nweren\u2019t working at all. We were sitting outside. There was nothing to look at, not a blade\nof grass growing in front. It\u2019s dust, when it was dried and it was mud that you were\nsinking in, because it was a clay ground, and we used to sit sometimes trying to take care\nof our clothes 1n order to get the lice out of it, because the dresses that we have gotten,\ninasmuch as they were disinfected, they were full of body lice. Fortunately, we went\nthrough typhus already so we were immune already at least to one disease that we didn\u2019t\nneed. After two weeks, they took us to a place to work and there were huge rocks, and\nthey told us to take the rocks and transfer them to the other side of the big field. So, we\ndid, and the couples who were German inmates, German women inmates, they were\nbeating us. They were always in charge of the working units, and hollering and cursing in\nlanguage, in a kind of a language that we never heard of, we were never exposed to, you\nknow, the names that we were called \u2014 the worst possible names. But, this wasn\u2019t, you\nknow, you accept when you find yourself in a situation like this \u2014 to survive, people were\ndoing all kinds of things that, sometimes to protect their own lives maybe, by being\nmean, mean, bad or whatever to others, by mistreating other people, that they felt that\nthey are going to be protected, that it will give them a certain security and that they will\nsurvive. So, I don\u2019t know the motives why certain people behaved like human beings\nwhile the others behaved like beasts, and the assistant to the Block Alteste was a very,\nvery mean woman. She was beating everybody and she cursing and she was hollering and\nfrom the moment we entered the barracks, she told us, \u201cYou\u2019re never going to get out\nalive of here. Whoever gets out of here 1s through the chimneys.\u201d That was degrading,\nyou know? And the chimneys were quite visible because there were five crematories in\nAuschwitz and you could see them, and you could smell the burning of the human bodies\nand the smoke, it was permeating the air, because in 1944, the transports were coming\nfrom all over and predominately from Hungary, and those people, most of the people,\nwent straight to the gas chambers and to the crematorium. So, you have to kind of\ncondition yourself to a new situation, and on one hand, you are shocked and on the other\nhand you are trying to kind of make peace with yourself that, well, this is the next stage,\nand not to give up hope, that you survived the other situations, that you are going to\nsurvive this one, as well. Yet there was \u2014 inasmuch as there was a lot more hope maybe\nin a way, as you were really fooling yourself to a certain extent, here you had the answers\nright before you that there\u2019s hardly any hope. You were hoping against yourself. I\nremember one night, it was a clear night and they didn\u2019t allow us to get out of the\nbarracks right after the Zahlappel, the counting. Normally, we had a very brief time to go\nto the bathroom, to visit a little bit with each other outside before we entered, but that was\ntime that they were bringing a lot of transports and burning the people, and they just\ndidn\u2019t want for us to be outdoors and witness too many activities. So, I remember it was a\nvery clear night and the smoke, the dark smoke, was coming all day long. I could see it. It\nwas the time of the quarantine yet, and we weren\u2019t yet taken out of the camp to work\nsomewhere else, and the smoke was always there, coming out of the chimneys, and then\nat night you could also see fire \u2014 not the smoke so much as during the day, but you could\nsee fire. And, you know, I was looking out this little window and I thought to myself,\nsuch little tongues of fire were escaping towards the sky, and I thought myself, \u201cIt\u2019s like\nhuman souls trying to go to Heaven.\u201d Fortunately, I didn\u2019t have \u2014 I wasn\u2019t separated upon\nthe arrival from my sisters, and I hoped that Father, who was in good health, if he was put\nto work, that he\u2019s okay. So, I didn\u2019t have this immediate fear that somebody very close\nthat we loved was burned in the crematorium, and yet it was so horrible to think, so\nhorrible to think of how many people who never experienced life, who were either\nteenagers or even little children who came to this world never had a future, and it\u2019s just\nheartbreaking, now that I\u2019m an adult and I am a mother and a parent, and I see how many\ninnocent lives have been lost because of Nazi madness. It\u2019s just terrible. It\u2019s just terrible.\nAnd, this was their way of breaking you down spiritually \u2014 I mean, physically due to the\nfact that they didn\u2019t feed you enough, but spiritually. And also, you know, you kind of\nlost that feeling of \u2014 how am I going to say it \u2014 of self-worth. I mean, there was no future\nwhatsoever. I mean, you were like a pawn in somebody\u2019s hands who was to determine\nwhether you are going to live or whether you are going to die, and you were a pawn\nwithout committing any crime. You were not there because you committed a crime or\nyou because you had done something wrong, or because whatever reason, but because\nyou were a Jew and that was the Final Solution and Auschwitz and Birkenau was the\nplace to bring the Jews for the Final Solution. When they finally started to take us out\nafter the month of isolation, where they called it \u2014 I\u2019m getting upset \u2014 quarantine, and\nthey took us to the front, outside of the camp to different places of work, we could see\ngroups that were passing by as we were marching to work, and in some cases \u2014 among\nthem there were women \u2014 we usually tried to communicate 1n passing to find out where\nthe people were from, so that if they mentioned a familiar name, you called somebody\u2019s\nname from that town that you knew, and if they were among them, they answered and\nthis is how we found my aunt who was from Radom. They were coming from the\nopposite direction and they asked, \u201cWhere are you from?\u201d And we said, \u201cStarachowice.\u201d\nAnd, she started to call our names, and she says, \u201cRemember, I\u2019m here, too, and I\u2019m still\nalive.\u201d That was my aunt Rosha Laks from, she had the same name as I, from Radon. She\nsurvived the war, by the way. And so, there was always the unexpected, sometimes good\nand sometimes bad. When we were coming back from work, we had enough time to go to\nthe bathroom. You know, the bathroom was also a barracks that, that you only were\nallowed a certain number of minutes at a certain time, because it was just one facility for\ntwenty barracks that were in that particular area, and if people had diarrhea and they\nneeded to stay a little longer, the couple was always running back and forth. You know, it\nwas like \u2014 it really wasn\u2019t a bathroom. It was a \u2014 what do they call it in the military, those\nplaces where there are holes in the ground? I don\u2019t know what to call it.",
        "A: A latrine yes, but a latrine \u2014 there is a name for it. I don\u2019t remember. It will come to me\neventually. So, she was running back and forth, and if any one woman needed to use the\nbathroom a little longer. She was hitting, outright hitting, clobbering the people with the\nrubber hose or whatever she had in her hand. But again, there was an advantage in this\nadvantage because when you went to the washroom or you went to the bathroom, there\nwas always a queue because, you know, this was your time and five minutes later was a\ntime for another barracks, and because there were so many new transports coming at that\ntime, 1944 in July, that we could inquire of where the people are from and whether they\nknow anybody that we were looking for. So, sometimes people used to find cousins or\naunts like in our particular case. Not that we had seen my aunt anymore in Auschwitz. It\nwas just the one time when our paths had crossed. So, that was the advantage, inasmuch\nas you were beaten. Food was delivered daily to the work place, and in the evening at\nZahlappel, we were getting our bread and the coffee in the morning. We did not have\nindividual dishes, but they had these bowls that they filled and since we always marched\nfive abreast, five, you know, that a bowl full of food was given to one person and we had\nto pass it around and everybody took a gulp and passed it to the next one, so there was an\norderly distribution of whatever was given in that bowl, whether it was soup or the coffee\nin the morning, quote-unquote, you know. God knows what they had in there.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Not really. It was kind of an accepted thing that that\u2019s the way it should be, not to take\ntwo gulps when the other person \u2014 for the other person to be deprived of it. But\ndistribution of food, for example, of bread was \u2014 they did Zahlappel in the evening before\nwe entered the barracks. And the piece of bread was mostly sawdust, and I would say a\nsize of maybe two inches by an inch: an inch thick, an inch wide and two inches long. I\nwrote the story about a day in Auschwitz which I called \u201cOne Ordinary Day\u2019, and it\u2019s a\nvery \u2014 it was a very typical difficult day, and we went to work and we worked cutting\ndown marshes along the river to clear the view of the watchtowers because it was\nOctober already of 1944, and there were underground activities, and people were\nescaping and some people were successful, and some people were not, and those who\nwere not successful were brought back to camp and there was a public hanging or they\nwere shot or whatever, but we were cutting the marshes and it was pouring all day and we\nstood in Zahlappel and got wet and went to work and even got wetter, and we stood in\nthe mud that was coming up to our knees and the capo was in a horrible mood and the\nGerman SS men who were escorting the group with the dogs were horrible, and after\nreturning from work, we were told to sing, and we couldn\u2019t sing. I mean, we sang but not\nfor marching, and they wanted us to march in good step with the clay and everything on\nour legs. So, they sicked the dogs on us, and the dogs tore the clothes off the people who\nwere on the outside of the columns. It was just a horrible, horrible day, and then we came\nto our barracks and we lined up for Zahlappel and it 1s still raining and my sister Hania 1s\nin front of the column of the five girls because it was always right in front of the\nbarracks. It was a long line, always five abreast. So, 1f we were marching, we were facing\nthis way, but when we were standing in front of the barracks, there was one in the front\nand four people in the back. And Hania was complaining that she\u2019s dizzy and that she\u2019s\nnot feeling well and that she has a headache and this and that. And we were counted, the\nfood was brought, and Saranka (ph), the woman who was so rough and rude, was the one\nwho was distributing the food. So she was placing five portions of bread in the hands of\nthe person that was in line up front and the person in the front was to pass the bread over\nto the people in the back, and Hania was up front that day, and as the bread was placed in\nher hands, instead of turning around and passing the bread to others, she took the bread \u2014\nthe five portions of bread \u2014 and she brought it to her mouth. She was hungry and she had\nall the bread in her hand, and when I saw it I was right behind her, I started to scream. I\nsaid, \u201cHania, don\u2019t do it. It\u2019s not yours. It belongs to all of us.\u201d And, it wasn\u2019t a matter of\nnot wanting her to eat my bread, but we were only three. There were two girls that were\nno relation whatsoever to us, and I kind of scared her so that all of a sudden, I could see\nthat her eyes have turned like this in her head. She looked at me, and I could see how her\neyes turned around and she became pale and she fell to the ground. And when I looked at\nher lying there on the ground with her hairless head, and by then it was already almost\nthree months in camp where we didn\u2019t look anymore like we looked three months earlier\nwhen we came from the camp. So, between her lying there with a shaved head and her\nface as, you know \u2014 without much flesh, she looked like \u2014 her face was like a skull, and I\nthought that she had died. So, I fell to my knees and I started to cry, and I tried to shake\nher, and I held her hand, and I said to her, \u201cPlease don\u2019t die.\u201d I said to her, \u201cI'll give you\nmy bread. I'll give it to you today. [Il give it to you every day.\u201d And she did not respond,\nand then the woman who was distributing the bread saw a commotion at our end and she\ncame running and she saw what happened. So, she started to holler for someone to bring\na bucket of water, and she poured a bucket of water in Hania\u2019s face. So, when Hania\nopened her eyes \u2014 because she basically fainted from hunger and from exhaustion and\neverything \u2014 and she opened her eyes and I was holding onto her hands, and she had this\nsmile on her face, not knowing at all what has happened to her. So, I picked her up, and I\npropped her up, so to say. I was holding on to her from one side and Renia from the\nother. And at Zahlappel, you have got to stay in line, be in perfect alignment, and\ninasmuch as she was rude and ugly and unbelievable, that assistant to the Block Alteste,\nshe didn\u2019t say anything. She didn\u2019t reprimand us. She didn\u2019t holler. She did nothing. We\njust stood for the rest of Zahlappel, and then when we went to the barracks, we all went\nto bed and lied down in our wet dresses. There was no way how to dry them and where to\nhang them, but we were nine people in that space, so we kind of cuddled together, hoping\nthat the clothes on our bodies will be dry the next morning when we have to get up and\ngo to work again. So, these were the different experiences. From Father we didn\u2019t hear at\nall, inasmuch as we were hoping that somehow no matter what, we would be able to\nmake contact with him. People told us that there was a way of contact men, because there\nwere always male inmates that were coming as electricians, as plumbers, to the camp. So,\nthat if we were to know where he is, because there were different villages around. There\nwere different factories where they employed people. That if we know exactly which\ncampsite that he is at, that maybe there would be a chance for us to find out. While we\nwere in Birkenau in that barrack, we couldn\u2019t know anything about Father, and we\nourselves were already reaching a point where even our feelings and emotions were\ndying in us. Forget about everything else. You know, you have compassion for people,\nyou try to assist others, and so forth and so on, and then you reach a point that not only\nyour body gives up physically, but even your emotions and your feelings. That\u2019s why so\nmany people tried to end their lives and ran to the electrically charged fences. Because if\nthey were alone, they couldn\u2019t cope with this life anymore. That was enough for them.\nSo, it was at a point now that there was almost no hope, and it is Fela Berlant (ph), the\nschreiberen, who went with a report to the headquarters and found out that they need\nclerks, office clerks, and came running and told us to follow her without a word, without\ntoo much commotion that we were able to secure a better position that brought us into a\nnew life \u2014 a new life that we didn\u2019t even know that existed in Birkenau. So, we recovered\nphysically, mentally, for a short duration. So, we had three months of horrible experience,\nand then we had about two and a half months \u2014 November, December, until January 14\"\n\u2014 that put us back on our feet and we were able to again withstand the difficulties of the\ndeath march that followed. And this, too, was a difficult thing inasmuch as we were in a\nmuch better situation than anybody else because we had good shoes and we had a warm\ncoat and we had gloves and we had scarves and we had hats and we had clothes on us. It\nwas not like the situation when we first came, the first three months, that outside of one\ndress, we didn\u2019t have anything. And another thing that helped us to pull through that\nperiod of the death march was that the Polish women with whom we worked had some\nsupplies because they were always getting some food from home. So, they had a little bit\nof sugar that they divided between the people as we were leaving the camp, and it 1s the\ncombination of snow \u2014 it was snowing, it was cold, it was terrible \u2014 but it was the snow\nthat kept us going because no matter how tired you were, you rubbed your face with the\ncold snow, you were more alert, and by mixing the snow with a little bit of sugar, it gave\nyou a little bit of energy, which was also very good. But here we had a problem with\nRenia because she just could not walk. She was very sleepy and we knew that no sooner\nwill she sit down at the edge of the road \u2014 there were so many people driven at the time\nfrom every field, from the men\u2019s area and the women, so it was whoever sat down or bent\nover or ran into the field to relieve themselves or whatever were shot to death \u2014 and\nRenia couldn\u2019t walk and she started \u2014 she was delirious \u2014 and she started hallucinating.\nSo, Hania and I grabbed her under her arms and we dragged her. As bad as the snow was,\nbecause it was very cold, it was very convenient for walking because we didn\u2019t really\nhave \u2014 we weren\u2019t forced march and sing like when we were going out to work in the\nfields. We were all kind of sliding on that snow, and Renia didn\u2019t have to walk. She was\njust sliding along. And they brought us to a huge barn. I remember that, and the barn was\n\u2014I mean, it was supposed to be a shelter, but it wasn\u2019t really a shelter. It was as huge\nbarn where the Nazi soldiers, the SS men, could keep us contained in one area, locked in,\nbut the boards were missing and there was no roof, you know, and the wind was howling\nand blowing and it was snowing. But we were kind of together for the night, and then we\nmarched for another two or three days. And dead bodies were strewn all over the road, all\nalong the road. It was men and women, because so many thousands of people were\ndriven out of Auschwitz. Only those who were not able to get out of bed remained, but\neverybody else was just driven out of Auschwitz until, I think, about 40 kilometers from\nAuschwitz. They put us on a train. It was a flatbed, and it was full of snow, and we\ntraveled from that town, I don\u2019t remember the name of it, but I know it was about 40\nkilometers from Auschwitz, and they took us to Ravensbriick",
        "A: That was a family.",
        "A: There was never a discussion about it. It was an instinctive kind of a reaction to situation.\nIf I was \u2014 if I was \u2014 if I could be of more help to one particular situation, I did it. If Hania\nwas in a situation where she could be of help to the others, it was the same thing. I don\u2019t\nknow what was on my sisters\u2019 minds. We didn\u2019t have conversations. We had each other,\nthe physical being. There was no conversation. I mean, on occasion, yes, when we could,\nwhen we were allowed and we were not beaten and we were not exhausted and when our\nmind was functioning in a way that you needed, but what you thought about basically\nwere the immediate needs and how are you going to manage the next day, to pull through\nit, and in what way this is going to happen. I know that at one point I developed a boil in\nmy leg, and they took me to the infirmary and I was in the infirmary for several days \u2014 I\ndon\u2019t know whether it was a week or whatever \u2014 and it was a friend of my mother\u2019s who\nsaw my name, who was working in that infirmary, who was a nurse in that infirmary, and\nwhen she saw my name and asked whether I know Pola Laks, I told her, \u201cI\u2019m her\ndaughter.\u201d That she saw to it that I was returned back, when I was through, that I was\nreturned back to the same barracks from which I came. Because normally they never send\nyou back. They send you to the crematorium if you did not recover, and in most cases\npeople did not recover, but due to the fact that she kind of found out that I\u2019m the daughter\nof someone she knew or was fond of, that she took care of me and she sent me back to\nthe barracks. So, I was very fortunate to be reunited with my sisters. There was a\nsituation where my little sister disappeared completely and we didn\u2019t see her for 24\nhours, and I don\u2019t even know where she was. And, then all of a sudden she appeared,\nbut... And whenever I ask her, she says, \u201cI don\u2019t know. I just don\u2019t know what happened,\nwhere I was.\u201d So, there was this constant fear of \u201care we going to be together? Is\nsomething going to happen to us that we are going to be separated? What is going to\nhappen?\u201d For one reason or another, whatever the situation developed good or bad, we\nsomehow managed to remain together. It wasn\u2019t that we were so smart or that we knew\nhow to manage. It was really without knowing, without knowing, and still I\u2019m told today,\nI think it\u2019s providence. I think there is nothing else that one could really explain why\nthings happened to us the way they did.",
        "A: Well, I think that we all shared a certain responsibility. On my part, I felt that my\nresponsibility is to take care of my two sisters. I\u2019m sure that they felt the same way about\nme, but there was never a division of duties or whatever. I mean, we had our portion of\nfood that we shared, and we did not \u2014 fortunately, we were not confronted with any kind\nof a disease that would have separated us for a long period, only the boil on my leg,\nwhich fortunately healed fast and I was returned, but otherwise, in the three months that\nwe were in Auschwitz \u2014 Renia was beaten once very, very badly because she dared to dip\nher pan into a cauldron with soup as it was delivered to the barracks. The deliverers were\npeople who went to the kitchen and two people carried the cauldron of soup. So, she was\nnearby and she had a cup in her hand, and she dipped it, and she was beaten terribly.",
        "A: No. She was black and blue and swollen, but she didn\u2019t have to go.",
        "A: The assistant was so brutal. It was different. The Block Alteste was also a Jewish girl\nfrom Slovakia, but she was a different type. She was very \u2014 maybe she had\nunderstanding, but we did not come into contact with her that much. In the administration\nof the barracks, there were those three women \u2014 the Block Alteste \u2014 they were all Jewish\nwomen who came in at the very early stage. So, it was 1942, 1943, you know. Fela was\nthe schreiberen. She had a big mouth, and she hollered all day, but she didn\u2019t hit and she\ndidn\u2019t beat and her toughness was expressed, you know, as I said barking, because this is\nlike some dogs barks and they don\u2019t bite. So, basically she didn\u2019t do any harm to anybody\noutside of hollering and then was this other women who never held her arms steady, but\nlike a windmill. Her arms were going and whoever was in the way got beat up. And she\nwas the one who was insulting and was calling us horrible names, and calling us whores,\nand God knows what. So, when I think about it now, and I know that she came with the\nfirst transport of women to Auschwitz, and they were 500 or whatever the number was,\nand small number of them remained, you know, survived and at the point when we came,\nthat she must have been very bitter and because she lost everybody. She felt that this \u2014\nthat we have to go through the same kind of a suffering that her group did and she was\ninflicting the pain on us, which gave her the security of the job that she had. But there\nwas a human aspect to her that I see now that I\u2019m older, that basically she didn\u2019t have to\nbe so helpful when Hania fainted. She could\u2019ve just walked by without any reaction\nwhatsoever, and yet she made sure that she revived her by throwing the bucket of water\nand allowing us to stand there, and not being sympathetic or having any kind words or\nanything. It was all in the same manner, in a rude, hollering manner. But I explain it, so\nto say as, the human side of her by sheer demonstrating her willingness to assist.\nEnd of Tape #7\nTape #8",
        "A: I wasn\u2019t even familiar \u2014 I didn\u2019t even know that a kommando like this exists. About\nKanada we heard, because of all the belongings of the Jewish transports were going to\nKanada, where the good things were separated from the worn things and sent to Nazi\nGermany. But I never knew there was such a thing of Effektenkammer, where Christian\nPolish women were employed and they were in charge of the belongings of political\nprisoners that were brought. Everybody had a different assignment. There were groups.\nLike, there was, again, the administrative part of the operation; there was the group that\nwas storing the clothes; there was the group that was... kept whatever other belongings\nwere. My job was with another girl, a Christian girl \u2014 her name was Ioasha, Ioasha\nHaborra (ph) \u2014 and we were in charge of suitcases. So, I walked into the room, a large\nroom that had lots and lots of shelves, and the shelves were full of different sizes\nsuitcases. None of them were real large. Some were satchels, some were like knapsack\nkind of canvas bags, and some were a small suitcase and all of that. We were very\nwelcome by the group, the 20 Jewish women, or 25 Jewish women who were sent to\nreplace the other \u2014 other Polish women who were sent on transport, and they treated us\nvery, very well. I think I mentioned before that they were mostly intelligent women,\neducated women and they were very kind to us. We found out later on that there were\nmany among them who were Jews on assumed papers. So, I would say that we were like\n50/50 or maybe even more Jews, but some of them were under false papers and\nconsidered themselves Christian, I mean, considered themselves as Poles rather than\nPolish Jews. The job we had to do was, when a person was released from Auschwitz, a\nPolish political prisoner, that we had to make sure that the belongings she brought, that\nher personal belongings that she brought \u2014 her clothes and so forth and so \u2014 were\ntransferred with her, or if she was released from the camp, that everything went with her\nas well. During this period that we worked together, we had to gain the confidence of the\nPolish women that were there before because, as we were getting more and more\nacquainted, and as the underground activities were kind of increasing and there was more\ncontact with the outside, that we had to be part and parcel of what was happening, and I'll\ngive you an example. There were women who were working in very important\ndepartments, and it\u2019s only there that we found out what was happening. There were\nwomen who had access to the lists of daily transports. There were women who worked in\nthe laboratory were Dr. Mengele was doing experiments on the children, and they had\nevery record what was being done to the children and so forth, and other very important\noperations performed by the Nazi on the campsite to which nobody was privy and it\nnever left the camp. And yet, through this Effektenkammer, every once in a while, a list\ncame in, a piece of paper came in that I never witnessed openly where I would be able to\nread or see what was written, but let\u2019s say on two occasions Ioasha and I had to rip apart\na suitcase and glue in a letter, an envelope, into the lining of the suitcase or place an\nenvelope once in the bottom of a pocketbook. And it went with the person that was\nreleased from camp. Now, how did I know what we were doing? We were just told that\nthis is a mission that we have to fulfill and that we should not ask any questions. How did\nthey find out about it? I remember, there was a woman Krystyna Jevulska (ph), an\ninmate, and she was a Jewish woman from the Lodz. But she came to Auschwitz under\nan assumed name as a political \u2014 Krystyna Jevulska (ph) \u2014 as a political prisoner, and she\nhad contacts on the outside. The family that she maintained contact with was sending to\nher packages, food packages, monthly so nobody could suspect that she was Jewish,\nbecause if you have family outside and they send you food packages, then you definitely\n\u2014 Jews did not have anybody who was sending daily packages. And I remember one day\n\u2014 we ate together most of the time. We didn\u2019t have to stand on Zahlappel, and sometimes\nwe didn\u2019t eat the food for the camp, but they give us some provisions that we could\nprepare a meal by ourselves. We were a small group. So, I remember one day, a package\ncame for Krysia Jevulska (ph), and in the package was a hard-boiled egg, and the joy and\nthe happiness was indescribable. I mean we didn\u2019t know why was everybody so excited.\nWell, after a while when things had simmered down, we were told that in that letter \u2014 in\none of the letters, I don\u2019t know which one, whether the one in the suitcase or the one in\nthe pocketbook that was sent out, a message was sent to the family that was sending to\npackages to Krysia that if they receive this letter \u2014 because of course there was important\ninformation that had to be sent out in that concealed envelope \u2014 that if they receive this\ninformation that should include in the food package that they are sending one hard-boiled\negg, which will be an indication that they know what is going on and that they received\nit. So, in a way, it was so important to know that in all that horrible experience that each\nand every person that was incarcerated went through, that some news about what was\ngoing on in camp was reaching the outside world. I mean, I\u2019m only talking about the\ndepartment of the suitcases. In what other ways things were smuggled out, I don\u2019t know.\nI\u2019m sure that they never used the same system, because they would be caught sooner or\nlater. So, there must have been different departments. Departments must have been\nsending news out. That was, so to say, the only possible way of contacting \u2014 for the\ninmates to contact the outside, the outside world.",
        "A: No, the idea was that the person who was leaving, they would never put something with a\nperson who was not trustworthy. And the woman was told that, once you are out of camp,\nthis 1s \u2014 you have something in the suitcase or in the pocketbook or wherever. They never\n\u2014 for her not to be afraid, I\u2019m sure they didn\u2019t tell her where exactly it is, I mean, in\nwhich place and how to do it, but they must have told her that somewhere \u2014 I mean, it\u2019s\nnot that I did, you know, it\u2019s how I knew about it \u2014 that she was aware of taking out of\ncamp something that was very important for the people who were outside to know, and\nthis is how we got the hard-boiled egg. That was only one time in my being in that\nEffektenkammer which was just unbelievable. But we had a wonderful three months that,\nas I said before, that we regained not only our physical strength but our self-esteem, and\nit gave us hope that somehow there is a chance that we\u2019ll be able to come out of this hell.",
        "A: Oh, sure.",
        "A: It was \u2014 always, there were people who were in charge. There was Maria, who was the\ncapo, she was a Polish \u2014 she was a Polish political prisoner, a very wonderful person.",
        "A: [Shakes head. ]",
        "A: She was the head of the Effektenkammer, of the fifty women who worked there. Maria,\nand she \u2014 why I know Maria because Krystyna Jevulska (ph) was writing poetry, and she\nwrote a poem about all the people who were involved in different jobs, and she described\nthem \u2014 who they were and what they did, and her poetry was also sent out. She passed\naway. She lived in Germany after the war. She\u2019s gone, too. It\u2019s a shame, you know? I had\nthe last interview with her that was done in the \u201880s. She was sick by then with cancer,\nand she really gave the interview of her life, you know, who she was \u2014 the Jewish girl\nfrom Lodz, Landa was her name, her last name, and she came to live in Warsaw and how\nshe was arrested in Warsaw and her contacts with all the people. I think she was a\nCommunist, a member of the Communist party. She was like \u2014 I would say she was the\ninverse of a university student right before the war, and university students had all kinds\nof organizations and Jews were not very welcome in too many organizations, university\norganizations. So, most of the young Jewish people were so infatuated with the ideology\nof Communism that I think she was one of the members. She speaks about it briefly in\nthat interview, but not much. Beautiful woman, just great personality.",
        "A: Never.",
        "A: Immediately, there was never a selection. There was only a fear of being transferred to a\ndifferent camp. And, there was no guarantee because the other, the Polish women who\nwe replaced, they felt very secure there. There were no selections, but they took them out\nbecause they wanted to bring a new element so they shouldn\u2019t feel so very comfortable\nwith each other. The Nazis must have suspected that something is going on there. Plus\nthey had contact with the men outside of the camp. The Effektenkammer was near\nKanada and therefore, the unloading of the... There was a lot of moving around there.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: [Shakes head]",
        "A: Sure. We they were playing when we were marching out and marching in.",
        "A: You know, when you are kind of brainwashed that this is the way to function and you get\nused to that routine and you hear that orchestra already and you know that you are\napproaching the barracks and pretty soon you\u2019ll get your ration of bread. That was the\nmost welcome thing I would say. I don\u2019t know whether it was or it wasn\u2019t, but that\u2019s\nanother thing, the orchestra. They performed for the Nazis with concerts of Wagner and\nthen they played marches for the groups leaving the camps. I don\u2019t really remember\nexactly. I remember the orchestra, I remember the marches, but that\u2019s all I remember\nabout it. I remember when Mala committed, cut her veins, when she was caught after she\nescaped and she was brought back, because they called everybody to witness her\nhanging. When we were in Effektenkammer, or no, when we were in Effektenkammer,\nthere was another hanging of the courageous four women who were bringing in Rosa\nRobota, and Sapirstein, and Weisblum, the four girls who were working with the\nexplosives and they were bringing each day to camp and giving it to and giving it to the\nSonderkommando, so they could build a bomb and blow up the crematorium. But we did\nnot really actually witness it. So, you know, there were so many different activities of\ncourage and trying to make the world aware what is happening and what is taking place.\nSome of the news came out, because after all, young Karski came to the United States,\nand I love that man. I mean it\u2019s unbelievable how courageous that man was to be able to\nbe smuggled into a camp and out and be an eyewitness and bring the news to Britain and\nbring the news to Roosevelt in the United States without a note on him. He had to commit\neverything to memory because he couldn\u2019t do it any other way. And the courage of that\nman to do it and then to be so disappointed that it took so long before some action was\ntaken on the part of the British and the American government to somehow assist and help\nin this situation or find an answer to whatever or to send airplanes to bomb or whatever.\nIt wouldn\u2019t have mattered if some of the inmates would have been killed in the process,\nbecause we were all dying. One way or another we would have been dead. But they\nwould have discovered in 1944 about the atrocities and how many millions of people\nwere killed and they could have stopped, even if they had done it in 1944, you know,\nhundreds of thousands of people could have lived.",
        "A: Yeah, I thought about it \u2014 why the world isn\u2019t doing something, why God allows for it to\nhappen. I mean, there\u2019s all kinds of things that go through your mind. Again, I\u2019m going to\nsay that you just have so much time to think. Otherwise, you are like a robot.",
        "A: That\u2019s it. I mean, one track mind. If I do such and such, maybe I'll get to the end of the\ntunnel.",
        "A: We wouldn\u2019t have survived.",
        "A: No, definitely not, because at this point another two weeks, and I don\u2019t know who would\nhave broken down first, but anyone of us, if one of us was gone then the other two would\nhave followed, and it doesn\u2019t really matter in which order.",
        "A: I think that this is pretty much what we want to cover and the mere fact that when we left\nthe the Effektenkammer, we were dressed warmer and so forth, and it\nwas easier to cope with the death march which was not easy again, and was very difficult\nemotionally and physically and all that, and finally, when we arrived in Ravensbrick, I\ndon\u2019t know whether the trip on the train was for two days or for three days or whatever it\nwas, we were brought again for registration, because there were not normally a transport\nthat was transferred, had papers and the number of inmates and so forth. This was such a\ndisarray that no documents followed us. So, we had to register again, and as we\napproached the registration desk, right then and there, we decided we are going to change\nour names to Christian names. So, we became \u2014 we assumed the last name Gorska, and\nthe first name \u2014 Hania and Reina remained the same \u2014 and I changed my name to\nKrystina because I wanted to have a true Christian name, and my sisters called me Krysia\nbecause it\u2019s a nickname for Krystina, and until this day I\u2019m Krysia to my sisters and\nKrysia to my nieces and nephews and to my grandchildren, because they hear \u201cKrysia,\nKrysia\u201d and they like the sound of it.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. It just happened. Sometimes all those things \u2014 you don\u2019t plan anything. We\ndidn\u2019t plan anything. We didn\u2019t have a strategy to follow. Everything was on an impulse.\nYou either took advantage of a situation, maybe, 1f you knew what was happening or just\nsheer coincidence, but here we knew that, after we were with the Polish women, the\nPolish kommando, we knew that Polish political prisoners have a better chance to survive\nthan the Jews, but it didn\u2019t matter when we came to Ravensbrtick. Ravensbrtick was\ndesigned for 20,000 women and there were 80,000 of us when we came in. The\nconditions were deplorable. There was no standing room. It was something awful, and\nafter the death march, even though we had warmer clothes and everything, we wouldn\u2019t\nhave lasted more than two weeks in Ravensbritck, between the beating and no food\nwhatsoever and the tortures that were inflicted on us by the camp inmates, by the capos,\nby the Aufseherinnen, the SS women in uniform \u2014 it was just unbelievable. So, I kind of\nblock out completely Ravensbrick from my mind because it was of short duration and\nthe only thing that I remember of Ravensbrick was that we changed our names. That\u2019s\nthe only thing. And the next thing I remember from Ravensbrick is that the uniformed\nmen walked into the barracks and asked for 50 volunteers. And because, as I said, there\nwas standing room only and we were always \u2014 we never pushed like other people, so we\nwere always the last ones to come in, always in the draft and near door and God knows\nwhere. So we were sitting on the floor and I turn to Hania and I say, \u201cWhat do you\nthink?\u201d And she says, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d And then we came to the conclusion, because he said\nhe\u2019s coming the following morning for the volunteers, he took everybody\u2019s name and\nthat\u2019s it, and then I said to Hania, \u201cWell, do you think we did the right thing?\u201d And we\ncame to the conclusion that if we remain in Ravensbruck, we are for sure dying within\ntwo or three weeks. If this 50 volunteers are going to be taken to die or to be killed, then\nit will happen immediately, but there is also a chance that they need 50 volunteers to go\nto work somewhere else. And he came in the morning and picked up the 50 volunteers,\nthey put us on the truck, and they were all women from all over. There was a woman\nfrom Hungary, and a woman from Yugoslavia, and from Czechoslovakia, and we were\nPolish from Poland, and they were German women, I mean Jewish German women, and\nwe all were on the truck and we were traveling for a half hour, for an hour, and we were\nstill on the truck. Nobody stopped the truck. So, after two hours, we came to the\nconclusion, we looked at each other and we came to the conclusion that they didn\u2019t have\nto drag us for that long to kill us, that we are going somewhere where they want to make\nuse of us one way or another. So, they brought us to Retzow. Retzow was a military\ncamp. It was a Luftwaffe, the air force, that was brought back because it was in\nMecklenberg, which was the northern part of Germany close to the Baltic Sea between\nLiibeck and Hamburg, and they needed people to work in the airfield to dig ditches \u2014 not\nditches, but trenches and so forth, and do the work and cleaning. So, the first transport\nthat arrived was basically for administrative jobs or for cleaning offices. So, they were\nthe ones like the girls from Slovakia who were experienced administrators, so they got\nthe good jobs, and we took whatever it was. Hania was cleaning offices and Renia was\nlike a valet to a German SS woman, and I was also cleaning offices, and Hania tells this\nvery nice story from Retzow that she was cleaning offices. Among the space that she had\nto clean was the office of one of the officers, and he always left papers, and he had the\nradio there and everything. And Hania, realizing the situation, that papers are always\nthere, pretended that she doesn\u2019t speak any German. So, he\u2019s talking to her and he\u2019s\ntelling her what to do. So, she says, \u201cNicht verstein\u201d (ph) and \u2014 Hania tells this story and\nI always laugh about it \u2014 \u201cNicht verstein\u201d (ph), which means in kind of a broken way, \u201cI\ndon\u2019t understand anything.\u201d Because no sooner did he go out, she went to look at what\nwas on the desk or she listened to the radio. So, one day he was still suspicious. He\nwanted to know what\u2019s going on. So, he comes in and she\u2019s there on the floor scrubbing\nthe floor with a brush, and mopping up the floor, and he says to her, you know, he wanted\nto catch her, \u201cDid you hear what they announced on the radio?\u201d And she says, \u201cNicht\nverstein.\u201d So, he looks at her with contempt and she says, \u201cSo gross ker faxen and so\ndom\u201d (ph) which means, \u201cSo gross ker faxen\u201d (ph) \u2014 so tall, because \u2014 and so stupid. So,\nthis is Hania\u2019s favorite story from it, but she heard every bit of news every day. When she\ncame in the morning, that was the first room she had to clean. So, she heard the news and\nthen she went to work. And Renia, because she was kind of a valet to the SS woman who\nwas in charge of the entire group of supervising women in camp, so she liked Renia a lot,\nand she says, \u201cHow can I help you? Would you like to have some food? Are you\nhungry?\u201d And this, and, Renia says to her, \u201cNot really. I don\u2019t want you to give me\nanything, but my middle sister is a very good cook, and if you just could see to it that my\nmiddle sister gets a job in the kitchen, then it will be just wonderful.\u201d So, she went to the\nchef and she told him that she has a girl that she would like to work in the kitchen, that\nshe\u2019s a very good cook and that she knows how to prepare good food, and for the food\nespecially that \u2014 not for the camp food, but for the SS people. So, they gave me a job in\nthe kitchen, and the kitchen was whatever had to be done. Either I was in charge of the\nbig kettle where we cooked for camp, or I was preparing hamburgers for the German men\nin uniform that were in the Air Force, or we used to cook that farina every morning for\nbreakfast for the military. So, that was good because you couldn\u2019t be hungry anymore,\nand we were cutting up the bread that was rationed for the eventual groups of people that\ncame after us. We were the first ones. We were there for a few days, and they brought\nabout a few thousand women to do the outside work. I remember once there were girls\nsweeping the floor outside and I was standing and frying hamburgers for lunch or for\ndinner for the Germans, and I saw the girls outside the fence. It wasn\u2019t very far and the\nwindow was big and wide open, and I was flipping the hamburgers and I was every once\nin a while flipping one outside, and so help me, I still remember, there is a woman who\nlives in Miami and she\u2019s Hania, also Hania, and she always says, \u201cI grabbed one of those\nhamburgers you threw out the window.\u201d So, you know, you didn\u2019t have to \u2014 you just had\nto be there to take advantage of every little situation, and you know, it didn\u2019t do \u2014 I mean,\nI haven\u2019t done any heroic deeds. I saw people are there. I figured whoever grabs it will\ngrab it.",
        "A: The chef was not in.",
        "A: So, nobody saw, and whoever was in charge was an inmate like myself. So, if she was\nangry or mean, she could have done me in, but the chef wasn\u2019t there. So, I figured, all\nright.",
        "A: Could have been, but I don\u2019t think that I would have taken that much of a risk if I would\nhave seen there is a danger because, I mean, there 1s a little logic to doing things, and it\nwasn\u2019t happening every day. It just \u2014 this particular situation, because there\u2019s still this girl\nwho always reminds how I was throwing out the hamburger, and how she was lucky to\ngrab one off the ground.",
        "A: Always, that was my job. That was really my job because in the beginning, I was in\ncharge of the kettle, the big kettle. So, what we did is we were lighting the fire \u2014 there\nwas like a huge, huge metal container, and under it was where the fire was burning, and\nwe had to all night we had to feed \u2014 I mean, the wood, place the wood so that the kettle\nwould be cooking. So, this meat, to prepare a meat base for a soup, you had to cook it for\nhours and hours because I don\u2019t think it was beef, I think it was horse meat at the time.\nAnd that was prepared for the soldiers. So, there were several of us who remained in the\nkitchen all night, not all the time because there were shifts, you know, sometimes one\ngroup of women and sometimes another group of women. The week that I was working\nat night with the other women, then at four o\u2019clock in the morning, we were separated\nfrom the camps because, due to the fact that we were cooking for the soldiers and\ncleaning for the soldiers, they didn\u2019t want us to live in the campsite. But under the\nkitchen in the basement, they set up cots for us to sleep in and wash and keep ourselves\nclean. So, in the morning, like at four o\u2019clock in the morning, before the chef came in, we\nused to have aprons \u2014 big, heavy canvas aprons \u2014 so one of the girls was standing there\nwith a hook fishing out the tongs and the other small parts of the meat that we were able\nto get out, and put it in the apron, in one of the aprons, and two of us were on the look-out\neach way, and one was running with that hot stuff in that canvas apron. We used to come\nin \u2014 We were all in one room, the 50 of us, all in one room. So, we dumped it like on\nwhatever it was, I don\u2019t remember, whether on the bed or on the table and we started to\nrip it apart and eat it.",
        "A: Yes. There was always enough. Then, I mean, when I wasn\u2019t in the kitchen at night, I\nremember how we worked \u2014 but there were other girls that were on that shift, you know,\nthen they did it. So, this is the way we survived in Retzow. And then, of course, we\nstarted to see the airplanes flying, and I remember when they threw leaflets, and they\nwere announced that Roosevelt passed away and Harry Truman became President,\nbecause we came to Retzow in February. We came at the end of January to Ravensbrick,\nand two weeks later, like end of February, and this must have been March or April. I\ndon\u2019t remember when Roosevelt passed away. This I remember, and they were always\nsounding the sirens because of the fear of the attacks from the air, and so, I was watching\nthe women. We were all so happy when we saw those silver planes. It was such a\ndelightful thing, and especially when it was on a weekend, on a Sunday, when we didn\u2019t\nwork, because there was no personnel there. And the way people reacted to situations,\nyou know? Hania used to get a hold of any food that was available and she was eating\nand eating and eating and eating like there was no tomorrow. There wasn\u2019t a problem\nanymore with food, as I mentioned to you, because I was working near food and we were\nnot that starved. There was another girl \u2014 this was also a very unusual kind of a thing \u2014\nbut she used to fill a bucket with water, undressed completely, and she stood there and\nshe was washing her body. For the duration of that period, from the time when the alarms\nsounded until the alarm sounded again that it\u2019s over, she stood there and she was washing\nfrom head to toe, just pouring water on her as if to cleanse herself from God knows what.\nAnd you watch people behave in situations that are so strange, and you can\u2019t figure out\nwhy people would do such things, a nervous reaction of one kind or another. Hania\u2019s\neating was not because she was hungry. It was a nervous reaction, and of course, before\nlong, we find out that the war was over. It was the beginning of May \u2014 fourth or fifth of\nMay \u2014 when we could see that the whole thing is getting out of control, even the people\nwho were in charge of the camp were not paying much attention, and everybody was\ntrying to kind of escape. We were getting packages by then the Count Bernadotte has\narranged through the Red Cross to send packages to inmates in different campsites like\nBergen-Belsen and whatever was close by. So, they were care packages that came, and in\nthe care packages was chocolate and cigarettes. So, the Nazis took out the cigarettes and\nchocolate and distributed the rest of the food \u2014 crackers, sardines, whatever was there,\nwhich was okay, maybe it was better, because otherwise we would have gotten sick, God\nknows what, and then Renia, Hania knowing what was going on and Renia sensing from\nthat woman for whom she worked that something is going to happen soon, all of a sudden\nis very patronized by that woman. The war may end soon, and after all, it hasn\u2019t been so\nbad in camp, and if a question comes up that \u2014 how the Germans behaved, I hope you are\ngoing to give a kind word - this kind of a thing, these kinds of conversations. By then,\nthey were trying to kind of save their own skin. Then, they came in the morning and they\nsaid the came is being evacuated. Now, where evacuated, nobody knew. Now, I find out\nthat this constant moving from one camp to the other was for the Nazis to save their own\nskin, because if they wouldn\u2019t have had the prisoners to move them around, they would\nhave been compelled to go to the front, and they wanted to save their lives. So, as long as\nthey were in charge of the prisoners, they had a very legitimate excuse why they have to\nremain. But by then, when we saw they were losing control of anything that is happening,\nand we were taken out from the camp and we came to that main road that led to this\ncommunity, there was so much going on. People from everywhere going in every\ndirection with little wagons loaded with household belongings and God knows, and you\ncould see uniforms, German uniforms, thrown along the road. People were trying to get\ninto civilian clothes to escape, not to be caught in uniform. So, it was just a horrible thing\nand we were driven and driven and driven and then, and the Aufseherin for whom Renia\nworked, she had that knapsack full of cigarettes, and she had her big cape and she had\nother things that she carried, and we all had a little bag with whatever. We had some\nsardines and some crackers, as I said before. And she says to Renia that it\u2019s hot and she\nwould like for her to carry the cape for her. So, Renia took the cape from her and threw it\nover her arm and we were just marching. And in the group that left Retzow was Helen \u2014\nHelena, and I don\u2019t know from where she was or we didn\u2019t know her for too long of a\ntime, but she was a tall, blonde woman named Helena, and she too had a big mouth, and\nshe spoke German very well. So, she saw Renia holding on to that cape. So, she made\nsure that we lagged behind a bit, and before we had a chance to look around, she had the\ncape over her camp clothes and she was hollering \u201cGet out, and get out of my way and\nget out of my way.\u201d And, she was pushing and pushing and pushing, pushing us towards\nthe woods, the small group of women. There was like a little forest, and because there\nwere civilians and there were the camp prisoners and there were the Germans who were\ntrying, some in uniform and some already in civilian clothes, there was such a\ncommotion, there was so much coming and going, you couldn\u2019t figure out what was\nhappening. But we wound up in the middle of the forest by night. So, we made a fire, a\nvery small fire so that it wasn\u2019t visible. We were very deep in the forest by then, and we \u2014\nI don\u2019t remember \u2014 to keep ourselves warm. How we opened the sardines I don\u2019t\nremember, but we had some of the sardines and in the morning, we got up and we\nwalked. By then, it was quiet already. We kind of wound up on the other side of the\nforest instead of near the road. And there was a huge, huge estate with a magnificent\nhome on top, and people were working in the field. And we came out of the forest and we\nsaw the people, so we figured well, if there are workers in the field, maybe they will help\nus in whatever way. Usually the fieldworkers were also either prisoners from a camp, but\nfrom the distance, we didn\u2019t know who they really were. And they noticed us and they\nsaw us with the tags with the numbers and everything. So, they came running and they\nasked where we are from, and there was a guy who was from Kielce, and Kielce was the\ncity to where Starachowice belonged; it was part of the district. And of course he says,\n\u201cNosha polachki!\u201d (ph) \u201cOur Polish girls,\u201d you know? So, when we heard that, we didn\u2019t\neven admit that we are not Polish, that we are Jewish, Jewish Poles, I mean, Polish Jews,\nand due to the fact that we already had our names changed, so we could pretend that. So,\nI was Krysia and Hania and Renia, and there must have been maybe twenty men and\nwomen working in the field, and this man from Kielce he was in charge of the working\ngroup, and he says, \u201cOh, did you come from camp? Poor girls, poor girls. You must have\nsuffered so much. Come with me to the house.\u201d And we went up to the house, and the\nhouse \u2014 the only person who was left in the house was the German woman who was in\ncharge of the operation, because the graph (ph) or whatever was down there \u2014 I mean, it\nwas a mansion. It was such a huge estate that it didn\u2019t belong just to a wealthy man. It\nbelonged to a very, very important, I would say, kind of individual. So, he comes in and\nbrings us and we are dirty and tired and I don\u2019t have to tell you what it\u2019s like being on the\nroad for so long. And he says to her, \u201cThese are my girls, and you make sure that they are\n\u2014 that they get clean and washed and prepare for them the best meal there is.\u201d An outright\norder from a person that was only a field worker, but because nobody was around and he\nsaw most likely what was happening, so that woman was very, very frightened. We were\nthree and there was a Russian girl and there was Helen and I think there were two more\ngirls, I don\u2019t remember exactly how many of us were in there. Now, I had a piece of soap\nto \u2014 and got into a bathtub with such fancy fittings and all that and a terrycloth towel to\nwipe myself, and then we were brought into the dining room, after we were all cleaned up\nand we walked around a little in the field. And the people who were working in the field\nwere not allowed to come into the house. It was off limits to them, but this man somehow\nfelt that now he\u2019s in charge because he was the head of the working crew and the owners\nwere not around and the whole place was empty with the exception of this one woman.\nSo then we come into the dining room and \u2014 this is funny, but you know how things\nchange from one to the next \u2014 so, here\u2019s that huge dining room with a banquet table with\nthe upholstered furniture and the heavy drapes, beautiful white drapes hanging from the\nhuge, huge windows. It\u2019s a beautiful estate, and that woman is so frightened and she\u2019s\nbringing bread sliced up and then she\u2019s bringing butter in, and the butter is laid out in\nlittle patties with the family crest. [Bursts out laughing. | I\u2019m laughing because it\u2019s\nridiculous. It seems like it\u2019s in the movies. With the crest of the family on the butter...\nAnd then she brings the food. I don\u2019t remember what we ate but what strikes me very\nfunny 1s here I am again in the dining room with her with a damask cloths on the table\nwith the fancy china and with the napkins and even the family crest on the butter, which\nwe did not have at home but the table was always set for eating in a proper manner. So,\nhere, in addition to what I remembered from home from a way back, was that butter\nwhich was cut in small pieces with the family crest on it. In my home we had a beautiful\nbutter dish with a cover. It was because the butter came in a block. So, it was a personal\ndish with the block of butter in it. It was either a block or an oval, depending on where\nyou bought it. If you bought it in the market fresh from the peasant, it was always like an\negg, a large egg-shaped thing they kept in leaves for it to stay cold, you know, when they\nbrought it from the village and it had a cover over it. So, that was kind of a remembrance\nof what it was last being at home and finding ourselves in this environment all over\nagain. And we were there for about four or five days, because we were liberated by the\nRussians, I mean, this area was liberated by the Russians. And the Russian officers came\nto check on the inventory, to take over as far as livestock is concerned and everything\nelse, and they found us and inasmuch as the officers. So, jabusky (ph) \u2014 immediately,\nthey wanted to make sure that we come to work for them. So, the man who was in charge\nof the working group came and said, \u201cWe are going to home and you are coming with us.\nWe are all going to make our way back to Poland.\u201d So, that was May \u2014 first week in May\nof 1945.",
        "A: In Germany. The war experience, and then the journey home starts. Also, not an\nuneventful \u2014 a very eventful journey home.",
        "A: Don\u2019t tell me that [laughs].\nEnd of Tape #8\nTape #9",
        "A: In the back row, from the left, is my Aunt Lodza (ph), who was my father\u2019s sister. She\nmarried a man during the war, and they both died \u2014 they were both taken to camps and\nkilled. Next to her, leaning on my father\u2019s shoulder, is Aunt Regina. She was a beautiful\nwoman. She was a wonderful, wonderful, full of verve and just an exciting person. She\nwas just beautiful. She too was married during the war, and she and her husband perished\nalso. There is my father who, when we were brought to Auschwitz, he was separated\nfrom us. He lived until the end of October, and the day he was taken \u2014 after his selection\n\u2014 to the gas chamber, we finally located him. Unfortunately, it was too late. Inasmuch as\nwe sent him the letter to him to let him know that we are alive. I guess that if he knew\nthat we were still around, maybe he would have had the strength to live through the war\nas well. That was October 1944 when we were already in Effektenkommer and we had the\nability to make contact with him. Then further down is my Aunt Rosha. She was the\nyoungest of my mother\u2019s sisters. Regina was also my mother\u2019s sister. Rosha was my\nmother\u2019s sister. She attended the university. She was a student of \u2014 she was a pharmacist\nwhen she graduated from college, and she too perished. Next to her is Dora who \u2014 the\ndark lady \u2014 who was my father\u2019s sister. She survived the war. She was in camp in\nPlaszow. She lived in Sosnowiec and went to Plaszow camp. Now, below here is my\nAunt Angia, who again is my mother\u2019s sister, and she was a single woman and she also\nperished in the war. Then comes my Grandma Sarah, who was widowed in the \u201830s, and\nthis is the mother of my mother, and she was a very intelligent woman, and a very\neducated woman, and when she married my grandpa, Leibush (ph) Tannenblum, she\nbecame very, very religious, and anything about religion that I know is because, in\nkatshrut (ph), in observances, is because she always wanted to know how much I know\nabout being Jewish and leading a Jewish life and she was always teaching me whenever I\nwas coming for a visit. And next to her is my sister Hania, who is sitting in my mother\u2019s\nlap, and Hania must have been a year, a little older maybe, my mother holding onto her.\nAnd, that\u2019s the family. So, as you see from the whole group, there is Dora on the extreme\nright in the standing row behind and Hania who is the baby. Everybody else perished.",
        "A: In this one is my father, Isaac Laks, and my mother, Pola Tannenblum Laks. It must have\nbeen at the very early stage, could have been at the time that they were engaged maybe or\nmaybe right after the wedding, but that was when they were very, very young. Even my\nmother\u2019s hair kind of tells me she could have still been a maiden at that time rather than a\nmarried woman.",
        "A: In this picture are the three girls, the three sisters, Hania is of course the tall one. She was\nalways very tall and very attractive, and she \u2014 that was in the wintertime, of course. It\nmust have been a Hanukkah present or something \u2014 a new sweater and a new hat and a\nnew scarf \u2014 and she refused to wear a coat; she wanted to wear the sweater. And then it\u2019s\nme. I\u2019m the one in the middle, and then it\u2019s Renia the youngest sister.",
        "A: Well, I would say somewhere around \u2014 I could have been ten, I guess. There is no date on\nit. That picture was sent to our Uncle Moish in the United States, and I don\u2019t have the\noriginal. My cousins made a copy for us, and they sent it to me. So, maybe the original\nhas some kind of inscription on it with a date, but this one doesn\u2019t have it. So, I\u2019m not\ncertain, but Renia is \u2014 I guess that Renia is about six. So, I am about ten \u2014 Renita is about\nsix and a half, and so I\u2019m ten and a half, and Hania is three years old.",
        "A: This picture \u2014 this is the old house that we lived in, I would say, up to 1935 or 36 or\nsomething like that. And we moved out of this house to a new apartment because this was\nreally in a bad condition by then. I mean, inasmuch as it was very comfortable on the\noutside, but it needed a lot of work \u2014 comfortable on the inside, it needed a lot of work on\nthe outside. So, here\u2019s my father and my older sister Hania and my mother and then\nRenia and I. I think that picture was taken later than the three sisters, because we all seem\nto be much older here in it. \u00b036? I don\u2019t know, but anyhow it was still in the old house\nand I don\u2019t remember exactly when we moved. I know that we moved right before the\nwar. Three years, you know, you don\u2019t remember exactly which way it went.",
        "A: This is Hania on the left side and I\u2019m on the right side, and we were reading something or\nwhatever. It must have been taken already during the war, either right before we went to\nthe ghetto or in the ghetto, but this 1s a war picture of the two of us.",
        "A: No, I\u2019m older here.",
        "A: Right, I\u2019m older here. It\u2019s not 1939. It could be 1940, \u201941 maybe, but it\u2019s definitely not\nfrom before the war.",
        "A: This is in Buscostruitz (ph). It\u2019s a park where my mother was going every year, and the\ngate 1s to that beautiful park where the facilities where she was taking sulfur bags. She\nwas suffering from rheumatoid arthritis, and she\u2019s in black because this must have been\nthe year that her father passed away \u2014 my grandfather. She was with him when he died.\nHe died in her arms. She took him to Krakow to see a specialist, and they came back to\nthe hotel room and he just passed away in her arms. He asked her to be brought to the\nwindow for some fresh air and that was the end of Grandpa. So, she never forgot that\neither \u2014 the loss of her father. And I am with her, standing right there. Every once in a\nwhile, I went with my mother or went to visit Grandma. It all depended whose turn it was\nto come along with Mother. She always took one of us with her and the other two went to\nGrandma, because my aunts were just wonderful us. They loved when we came for a\nvisit.",
        "A: I\u2019m what here? Six years old, seven years old \u2014 I don\u2019t know. Is it 1930? If it\u2019s 1930, then\nI\u2019m six years old here.",
        "A: This is my handsome husband, Miles Lerman and myself. This is the wedding picture.\nWe, of course, while I was not the bride in white, I was glad I had a blue dress, which\nwas pretty to get married in. It was right after the war. It was December 1945. We met.\nWe fell in love. We got married, and thank God, we are still together, and I hope for\nmany years. Now, we have a wonderful family to be proud of.\n[new picture shown]",
        "A: We came to Poland on the fact-finding mission, and there was a group from the museum.\nAt the time it was no museum, just a council, and the members of the council were from\ndifferent walks of life, different groups, different religions. So, Miles came up with the\nidea that in order for them to know what the council is all about, it would be worthwhile\ngoing to Poland, and Eli Weisel was the chairman at the time, and Miles took the\nchairmanship of organizing that trip. So, we were in Poland visiting the places of\nannihilation and, due to the fact that one of the Paliszewski sisters was still alive and this\nis Maria Paliszewska, we took her with us. We went to visit her and we brought her with\nus to Warsaw. I just wanted to present her to the group, for her to meet the Americans\nwho came to visit Poland to learn about the terrible story of the Holocaust and to present\nher to the group in her kindness and her generosity and her understanding that she\nshowed her family. So, she went along with us everywhere we went, include Treblinka.\nShe insisted that she comes to Treblinka, because she, too, felt that she wants to visit the\nplace where Mother lost her life. Her mother was killed. So, her we are with Miles on the\nleft and then Mrs. Paliszewska is in the middle, and I\u2019m on the right, and the name of the\ncommunity 1s right on the big rock, it\u2019s like chiseled in the rock. It says \u201cStarachowice.\u201d\nAnd around you can see small rocks and bigger rocks and smaller rocks and each\nrepresents a community, a destroyed community.",
        "A: That was in 1979, when the council was \u2014 or \u201980 \u2014 I think it was. It was right in the\nbeginning of the formation of the council.\nEnd of Tape #9\nConclusion of Interview\n"
