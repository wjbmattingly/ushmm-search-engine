        "Question: This is the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum volunteer\ncollection interview with Alfred Lakritz, conducted by Gail Schwartz on April 3\",\n2008, in Washington, D.C.. What is your full name?",
        "Answer: My full name is Alfred Julian Lakritz.",
        "Q: And what was the name you were born with?",
        "A: Alfred Julius Weber.",
        "Q: When were you born?",
        "A: June 1, 1934.",
        "Q: And where were you born?",
        "A: In the city of Kiel, K-i-e-l, Germany.",
        "Q: Now let\u2019s talk a little bit about your family, your parents, your grandparents.",
        "A: Okay, in order to understand my history, I have to begin with my paternal\ngrandfather. He was the first, on my paternal side immigrant from Galicia to the city\nof Kiel. He then helped to bring the rest of his family. He and my grandmother\nMirel, M-i-r-e-I had seven children. My father was the sixth child of that family.\nAnd my father\u2019s name is Simche, S-i-m-c-h-e Weber. They changed his name also\nto Lakritz. He was also known as Simon Weber, or Simon Lakritz. My mother\u2019s\nname is Marjem, M-a-r-j-e-m, also known as Mary, in the United States. She was\nApril 3, 2008\nborn Fass, F-a-s-s. She a-and my father were both born in Galicia. They both\nimmigrated to Germany and a-arrived and lived in different city, my father in Kiel,\nmy mother in Cologne. I was the first of three children born of my parents. I was\nborn, as I said, on June 1, 1934 in Kiel. After th -- me was my sister Rosa, R-o-s-a\nWeber, and her name also was subsequently changed to Lakritz. She was born on\nJuly 28, 1935 in Kiel, and she died I think the first or second day of her -- her first\nday of her life. She is the only member of the family who 1s buried in Kiel, who has\nin fact a burial place, other than my mother in the United States. My brother then\nfollowed and he was born on September the second 1936 and he was born also in the\ncity of Kiel. That is the extent of my immediate family. I will go into the extended\nfamily when I\u2019m asked.",
        "Q: Okay. Tell me a little bit about your parents. What did your father do, what kind\nof work did he do?",
        "A: My father worked for his father. My grandfather, Artur, otherwise known as\nArthur Weber, had established a business in the city of Kiel. From what I\nunderstand -- I don\u2019t really know the whole nature of it but at -- at -- after the f --\nend of the first World War, when he arrived -- whenever he arrived in -- in Kiel, I\u2019m\nnot sure when, he established a -- a wholesale business, and I believe initially it was\nof material after the war. In any event, he then changed that business to basically a\nApril 3, 2008\nbusiness of collecting during the -- th-the beginning of the Nazi regime, of collecting\nitems that the German economy needed; raw material, reusable material. And so he\nbecame a wholesaler of schmatter and of all types of metal and all kinds o-of things\nthat they could recycle. And he, during the time when Jews couldn\u2019t find\nemployment, he employed many, many Jews of Kiel in this business, and they\nwould go through the streets of Kiel with a handcart and call out something. And\nI\u2019m -- I\u2019m relating basically what I -- what I understand. And these people would\nbuy the used material that was recyclable, that Germany needed and then they\nwould sell it to my grandfather, my grandfather was their employer and I guess he\nwas the contributor to the livelihood of many, many Jews who also came from\nGalicia and -- like he had. And they formed a community in Kiel, which is\nimportant to understand, I mean the history of my family, which is recorded in Kiel\nand in books and in theses. His relationship to the other Jews, and to his own kind of\nJews who immigrated to Germany is important. He was a very devout Jew. A\nHassidic Jew, and -- as I think most of them were when they moved to Galicia, from\nGalicia to Germany. And he was a member of the one synagogue in -- in -- in -- in\nKiel. And as a devoted and daily religious man such as my father was also, he\nbelonged to that synagogue. But the Jews of Germany who were integrated Jews,\nand my gr-grandfather kind of Jews, clashed. And they clashed culturally, they\nApril 3, 2008\nclashed religiously in their dress, in their manner, in their form of employment,\neconomically, in -- in -- in all the other way. So those two groups in Kiel, separated.\nAnd my grandfather, having a compound property an-and -- and a -- and a big\nwarehouse, and it was a big business, anyway, he created his own synagogue, and I\ntake pride in the father -- in the fact that my grandfather, whenever I\u2019ve told that\nstory, 1s the only person that I know who had his own synagogue and his own\ncongregation. And that synagogue, and the photograph of his synagogue 1s\nreproduced in the books -- in the history books, published by the state where I was\nborn and by the city of Kiel, and I was given the books, an-and -- and the\nphotograph of that particular synagogue is repeated over and over, even in the\nmuseum of -- of Kiel and -- which is outside the -- Kiel. And it is a example, I\nsuppose of that there were Jews, and that there was an existence. Anyway, tha -- I\nwant to lead up to why this is significant in my family, because I come from these\npeople. They are ordinary people, they are very religious people, they are very good\npeople. They are very honest people, hardworking people, family people, loving\npeople. And all of these people were killed during the Holocaust. Thirty-one\nmembers of my father immediate -- im-immediate I\u2019m -- I\u2019m speaking now,\nmembers of my father\u2019s family were killed in the co -- various concentration camps\nof the Nazis. All of that is verified by documents that I have collected. And I\u2019m\nApril 3, 2008\ntalking now of my paternal grandfather, my paternal grandmother, all seven of their\nchildren, all seven, if any ha -- were married, and all of them but one were married --\nall of them had children and of all of those children in the -- in this compilation that\nI made of the records of my family, I have the whole family tree. I have all of their\nnames and birthdates and places of where they were killed, and all those children but\n-- seven of those children, survived. Seven children of this large family survived the\nwar. And one of the survivor had been interned in Auschwitz. He -- he is the only\none who survived the concentration camp of -- of all of my immediate cousins. All\nof my cousins otherwise, but the other -- my brother and I and I think four, survived.\nAnd the survival of these other cousins is interesting. Two or three of them went\nfrom Kiel o-or Cologne, or wherever they were living, right now I don\u2019t recall, and\nthey went on the Kindertransport to England, okay? Of those, one, Max\nWiedman, who is my -- also my first cousin, served in the British army and then in\nthe Intelligence, because he spoke, of course, very well the language of Germany.\nHe served in Germany an -- as a -- an Intelligence officer after the war an-and after\n-- before the [indecipherable]. Two of them were in England, one then emigrated\nto the United States and that\u2019s where we stayed when we first came. Anyway, the\none who survived Auschwitz then married another survivor of the concentration\ncamp and they were shipped out to then Palestine, and he established a sausage\nApril 3, 2008\nstore or whatever in -- in -- in -- probably in Haifa if I remember correctly. And he\ndied, and one of -- and one of his child -- his son is the -- a -- a vice president or\nsome position like that in the Weizmann Institute in Belgium. And --",
        "Q: Weizmann Institute in Israel?",
        "A: Yeah, that institute, but they have offices in -- in Belgium --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- and Europe and he is the vice president of one of them. I think it\u2019s the vice\npresident of that, in Belgium. Now, one of my cousins grew up in Cologne, and she\nwas sent by her parents to Palestine in 1937. She -- I think her name is Ruth, right\nnow. She became one of the early kibbutzim in then Palestine. She became a labor\nleader. She was extremely active in -- 1n politics in -- 1n -- in -- and in the kibbutz\nmovement in -- in Palestine. And she, like the son of the Auschwitz survivor, and\nMax Weidman who was in England, us four were the surviving children of this\nfamily, other than my brother. But those four reunited in Kiel when we invited by\nthe city of Kiel and by the state of where -- which we were born, to return. So those\nfour, okay. The only one of the surviving children who were born in Kiel who were\nnot killed, was my brother Herbert and he chose not to accept the invitation and not\nto go to Germany, to our birthplace.\nApril 3, 2008",
        "Q: Tell me why -- let\u2019s get back to your immediate family. Why did your family\nchoose to come to Kiel? Was there something about that city particularly that\nattracted them?",
        "A: Okay, well, my grandfather, as I said, had his wife and -- and -- and six children,\nseven children at the -- you know, okay, in Galicia in this little town on the\n[indecipherable] I -- I can\u2019t pronounce it. Anyway, I have the record, however it\u2019s\nspelled. And for some reason his family sent him in advance to go to -- away from\nGalicia. Apparently the lines of the Jews in Galicia at that time was becoming too\noverwhelming, too threatening, too whatever it is and he, because he was the most\nintelligent or the best, or what -- I don\u2019t know, whatever skills they gave him -- and\nhe was, obviously, a great man -- he was sent to Germany -- I mean, not to\nGermany, he was going to Denmark. So, on his way to Denmark he stopped in the\ncity of Kiel. And Kiel, he fell in love with that city. It\u2019s a beautiful city, a university\ncity on the -- on the Atlantic, on I think it was on the Baltic Sea --",
        "Q: Baltic --",
        "A: -- [indecipherable] Baltic Sea, okay. He just fell in love with the city. And so\nrather than going to Denmark, which was a little bit further up, he stopped in Kiel --",
        "Q: Kiel.\nApril 3, 2008",
        "A: -- and he establish in Kiel and he did -- I mean, he did fairly well, you know, for\nan immigrant, you know, particularly one with the long beard, the real Jewish\ntradition, a very Jewish looking man. Incidentally, his photo and that of th-the\nseventh child, my uncle, is also reproduced in the books of Kiel, over and over in th\n-- in the history books and it\u2019s the only picture I have of him with his long beard. I\nhave the picture of my other grandparents, my maternal grandfather and\ngrandmother and they also were of the same breed. Very religious. In fact, my\nmaternal grandmother -- I mean the father, was a -- a man who studied the -- the --\nthe -- the -- the -- the -- the -- the books, I\u2019m not sure which one right now that he\nstudied, but anyway, he studied them on a daily basis, was v -- extremely religious.\nAnd my mother lived in -- in -- in -- in -- in -- in Kiel -- I mean, in Cologne. Now\nthere\u2019s a time when my mother and her family lived in Holland, in -- I\u2019ve forgotten\nnow where. Now, when that happened, I don\u2019t know, but I assume it was during the\nfirst World War. And why they then moved to Cologne, I don\u2019t know, I didn\u2019t ask,\nI\u2019m afraid, and -- but she lived in Holland, then she moved as a child to Cologne.\nShe remained there until she met my father and they were engaged and they were\nmarried there. And then she moved, of course, with her husband to Kiel.",
        "Q: All right. We\u2019re -- so then they got married and you were their first child?",
        "A: I\u2019m the oldest one, yes, I\u2019m the first one.\nApril 3, 2008",
        "Q: And -- right. And what do you know about their beginning of their married life --",
        "A: Well, okay --",
        "Q: -- in Kiel and where they lived and so forth.",
        "A: All right. I believe --",
        "Q: We know you were -- you were an infant, and obviously this is what you\u2019ve been\ntold.",
        "A: Yeah, but I -- I -- I -- I can tell --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: -- whatever I -- I know --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: -- or recall. I believe that they were introduced through a -- what was a tradition -",
        "Q: [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yes, and I believe that\u2019s how they were introduced. And I believe that the -- of\nthe s -- a few surviving pictures that I have of my family, immediate family and of\nmy father and mother, I believe I have two things. I have their pictures that maybe\nwere exchanged, possibly. Maybe that\u2019s -- would explain those pictures. And I have,\nin the picture of my father and my mother, both taken alone, right, obviously by an\nofficial photographer --\nApril 3, 2008",
        "Q: What -- what year did they get married?",
        "A: They got married in 1933, in April. In their announcement -- I even have their\nlittle teeny announcement of their engagement, and the name that she has in the in --\nis Marjem Willener, W-i-I-l-e-n-e-r , and that is her father\u2019s real name, Willener.\nAnd I have a copy of his business -- I -- I don\u2019t know, since I don\u2019t read German,\nbut I have their wedding picture, I have their ketubah, and I had it translated. I have\ntheir wedding picture and I have their announcement. And the announcement of\ntheir -- their engagement was in January 1933 and they were married on the 11\" day\nof August 1933, and in th -- Cologne. And it -- it says that he is the son of Artur --\nArtur Weber and she is the son of -- I mean, she is the daughter Miriam, right, an-\nand Marjem is Miriam, daughter of Israel and according to the law of Moses and\nso forth, and that\u2019s when they were married.",
        "Q: Yes, okay.",
        "A: Now, I don\u2019t know what you asked me any more, but what -- you asked me --",
        "Q: Well, let\u2019s -- so now you are born. What is your first memory?",
        "A: Okay, all right.",
        "Q: What is your very first memory?",
        "A: All right. Now, you were asking me about my -- the type of people that they\nwere, Okay. They were engaged, I believe in that fashion, they got married. I believe\nApril 3, 2008\nabsolutely completely that my parents were totally, completely in love with one\nanother. Tough part is coming. One of the things that hurts I think the most about\nwhat happened to my family, and I\u2019m sure many families, 1s that they were totally,\ncompletely innocent, because they were totally good people. And the injustice of\nwhat happens to my family, as it is to thousands and maybe millions of others, who\nwere just as innocent, just as good, just as nice, is what makes, in my view, the\nHolocaust such a monstrous crime. Now, my parents as I said, right, my father\nworked directly for his father. A good son, a loving son. His parents, my\ngrandparents were wonderful, loving, religious, good people. My father and mother\nwere tremendously good people. And they didn\u2019t do anything -- and I have to say\nthis at the beginning -- anything to deserve anything of what happened to them. And\nso in this context let me tell you what I remember. I remember pushing my brother\u2019s\nbaby carriage and walking with my mother in the streets of Kiel, I remember that.",
        "Q: What language did you speak?",
        "A: German. And -- both of us did. And I remember getting lost with a girl in the\nstreets of Kiel, and some good people -- and we went towards the harbor, cause\nwhere I live was only three or four blocks from the -- from the harbor. And we got\nlost and -- and with the neighbor girl, and she was about my age, I suppose --\nanyway, and then we -- they were -- some kind people found us and -- and -- and\nApril 3, 2008\nbrought us back or restored us to our parents. Then my memory in-involves a time\nwhen my parents went out on an evening and -- and they left us without a babysitter\nand I remember that I -- I totally obviously panicked, and I turned on all the lights.\nAnd maybe that was the time also that my brother and I were playing and I was\njumping on the bed and I fell and hit my head against an end table in their bedroom\nand I have a little mark on my forehead because of that. Now, I also remember a\nliving room. In a -- in the living room we had a tapestry in the wall and there was a -\n- a deer and the main -- that was the main attribute of this tapestry, and I was\nfascinated that he kept looking at me. Wherever I moved, back and forth, this guy,\nthis deer, he kept looking at me. That was fascinating. The next thing that I\nremember is having Pesach on the floor of our living room.",
        "Q: Were you in an apartment or a house?",
        "A: Well, 1 -- 1 -- 1-- okay, my grandfather\u2019s property, a-as I recall involved, I\nbelieve, three buildings or four buildings. But anyway, from my memory, there is\nthe front building, you know the address of 25 Cuba -- kooba -- koober, forgot\nanyway, its name, little something. Anyway, so we lived in the front building on the\nsecond floor. Underneath that was the family of my cousins, uncle and aunt, they\u2019re\ncalled Weidman, right, they had several children. They lived there, we lived above.\nOkay. My grandfather lived over here, right, the entrance to the -- to the compound\nApril 3, 2008\nwas over here, and in the back was this warehouse, his big building. All right. Now,\nI remember being in that apartment, right? And it was, it was an upstairs apartment.\nAnd in the living room an -- we had one of the nights of Seder. And my father was\nall dressed in white and we were on the floor, we had pillows, and we had -- okay, I\nremember that. Now, the next thing I remember is an event that was very, very\ntraumatic to me. My mother was hanging up new drapes that she had made for our\napartment and she fell. And I rememb -- I remember the ambulance to take her\naway. And of course, I was three or f-four years old at the most. And I thought for\nsure they would take my mother away.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And it\u2019s interesting how children perceive different thing and understand,\nobviously a limited amount, and that\u2019s what I was afraid of, and --",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: -- the next event that I remember I believe was on Kristallnacht. And on\nKristallnacht, which I believe occurred in October --",
        "Q: November.",
        "A: -- 1938, yeah --",
        "Q: November.\nApril 3, 2008",
        "A: Right. The Nazis came to destroy as much as they could of the synagogue of my\ngrandfather. And I remember looking out the window with my father, you know,\n[indecipherable] down and they were burning things in front of the entrance to this\ncompound, and I remember that. And I am sure that that was Kristallnacht. Then I\nremember, and there may have been a separate day or was the same day, again my\nfather and I were crouched down the window so we wouldn\u2019t been seen, you know,\nand there were all kinds of soldiers lined up in front of our street there. Now, that\nmay have been a different time and there may have been parades that they were\ndoing, but in any event, I remember that.",
        "Q: Was that a frightening experience for you?",
        "A: Yes, both experiences.",
        "Q: Well, the burning yes, but the -- just th -- seeing the soldiers marching?",
        "A: Yes, that was frightening.",
        "Q: And then the next memory that I have is us being arrested to be shipped to\nPoland. And this followed, I understand from history, the Kristallnacht deportation\nwhere the Nazis tried to ship the refugee Jews in Germany to Poland. And so1 -- I\nremember the soldiers coming to our house with their gun, ordering my mother to\npack, and she went an-and packed her wet clothes that were on th -- hanging on the\nroof, and she put them in a big bag or -- a duffle bag, I remember that. I remember\nApril 3, 2008\nthe soldier with his gun, you know, standing there and I was so fascinated by the\nsoldier and the gun and th -- tha -- and I remember that. And then I remember in --\nin this state of arrest by the German, whether they were soldier, Gestapo, I don\u2019t\nknow. Then we were transported -- were arrest -- I -- I believe that we spent maybe a\nnight in prison, I\u2019m not sure, but I know what I remember. I remember being on the\ntrain, right, with these German Jews that they were shipping out of Germany, and I\nremember the men -- I was with the men what -- I remember. They were praying,\nthey had their tallis, they were crying and we were shipped to Poland and then\nPoland closed its border that day.\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\nvolunteer collection interview with Alfred Lakritz. This is tape number one, side B,\nand you were talking about when you were arrested and then taken away.",
        "A: Thank you. Okay, on this train ride, I remember getting off the train with my\nmother, so that I could make, okay, on the side of the -- siding on the plane -- I\nmean, of the train. And I remember doing that.",
        "Q: To relieve yourself, you mean?",
        "A: Yeah, right.\nApril 3, 2008",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: I remember also that at some stop, some people brought candy, ca -- chocolate\nand so forth to -- to be distributed and I remember that, and I\u2019m sure it was\ndistributed to the German. Okay, at that time of course, I was with my father and\nmother and my brother Herbert.",
        "Q: And you are a little over four year --",
        "A: Iam a little over four years old, yeah.",
        "Q: -- over four, you\u2019re about -- four, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, this 1s just a little over four.",
        "Q: What -- what did you take with you? Do you remember? Did you take anything\nspecial with you --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- as a four year old child?",
        "A: Lam -- yes, I am telling you, I -- what I am telling you, I remember. I absolutely\nremember. God has given me the gift, right, to be able to remember so that I can\ntestify to what I saw and experienced, what happened to of -- my family, of course,\nand others. On the train, as I explained to you, I remember this tremendous impact to\nme, of seeing men praying -- which of course I had seen, you know, I saw my father\npray every day, I went to the synagogue of my grandfather. I don\u2019t know how many\nApril 3, 2008\ntimes, but I went there. I\u2019m sure [indecipherable] in the company of my mother.\nBut here was something that really struck me as a four year old child, here were\nthese men standing with their tallis and their hats and their yarmulkes praying and\ncrying. They all understood that the German government, the German rulers had\ndecided to -- because they came and arrested all these people, right, and said all you\ncan do is take whatever, yo-you know, you can carry it in hand. You\u2019re leaving\neverything behind, right? You\u2019re abandoning everything, we\u2019re transporting you,\nwe\u2019re shipping you back to where you belong in Poland. And they were crying. And\nto a four year old child, right, the sight of men, right, that obviously a child only\nunderstands, you know, the strength and the absolute of parents, here were these\nmen crying. And I\u2019m sure maybe my father was crying. And I -- this was a real\nshock to me, yes. And later I-I was told -- of course I didn\u2019t understand anything that\nwas going on -- later on I was told by my mother -- not then, of course, years later,\nthat that day Poland had had it. It did not want to accept any more Jews being\ntransported or expelled, you know, from Germany into their country for whatever\nreasons they decided to do that. And our train, as far as my mother is concerned, our\ntrain was the train that was not allowed into Germany and it was sent back. So we\nwere sent back to Kiel. Now, the second phase, right, of -- of my story has to do\nwith how long, right, and this -- the legal system, both in Germany, then in\nApril 3, 2008\nBelgium, then in France, came and played a part on how Jews were treated. And so\nI understand, right. When I was born the Aryan laws were established, right, okay,\nwith all its limitation and so forth. But I also wi -- and I believe, I\u2019m informed that\nafter Kristallnacht further laws were imposed and restrictions on Jews, you know,\nwhich limited their employment, their op-opportunity to survive, you know,\neverything was done obviously, to make it as difficult, you know, for them in\nhardship. Okay, so in my family, what happened 1s, I believe that early 1n this\nballgame, the persecution of Jews was directed against my family as it was against\nothers, and I will tell you why. For some reason my mother became very concern\nabout their -- the future. For herself and for her children and for her husband. So she\nwrote -- I had a great heeha -- a great-uncle, her uncle, Uncle Max Fass, who lived\nin Oakland, California. And he had become a very successful businessman. And\nshe wrote to him, and I have one of her letters that she wrote to him, asking him to\nsponsor us to immigrate to the United States. His application was approved, visas\nand -- and our permission to enter the United States was approved in 1935. He had\npaid for the transportation with the Hamburg America line. We had everything.\nThe only thing we didn\u2019t have is the final stamp of the exit from Germany.",
        "Q: This is for the three of you, your mother, your father and you?",
        "A: Yes, in 1935.\nApril 3, 2008",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: That\u2019s before my brother was born.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And the little bit that \u2019'm told over the years, the story is something like this. My\nparents, of course, lived in Kiel. They had to go to Hamburg to get these exit visas\nstamped and approved. I believe that the story is this, is that my father, being a\nreligious Jew did not on the Shabbas or on this [indecipherable] holiday, carry any\nmoney. And so he didn\u2019t know, as smart as he was he did not know that they would\nrequire some payment for the exit permit. That\u2019s what I understand. He did not have\nit. So he asked them when he found out, Pll come back tomorrow when I can bring\nmoney. I have money. They had everything, okay, including the Hamburg line, you\nknow, confirmation, you know, wh-which I have a copy of. Okay. The Nazi said no.\nOkay, now you have to understand, I was born in the city that I believe was one of\nthe ultra-nationalistic Nazi cities, that\u2019s what I believe. That was where all the you --\nthe German si -- U-boats, submarines were located. That\u2019s where German armament\nships an-an-and submarines were manufactured, I believe that by slave labor, right,\nwho were gathered from wherever. I believe that was owned by Krup, okay, I am\nnot certain, but I am. Okay. In -- if I spoke and read German I could tell you better,\nyou know, than what I believe. But among the books that were given to me by the\nApril 3, 2008\ncity of Kiel -- you know, they proudly displayed, you know, their pre-World War II\nhistory, their World War II history and the post-World War history. And my family\nis there in the pre-war, my -- my cousins, you know, in the -- in the Hebrew schools\nare all over, you know, in their book. Their pictures are all over, hanging in the\nmuseum of Kiel, which is outside the city, you know, gigantic photographs of\nmembers of my family. In fact, Max Weidman, when we were going touring that --\nthat -- that museum, he said to me, see, that\u2019s my picture, that\u2019s me. He says, how\ncould it be that I\u2019m in a museum? We\u2019re looking at my face on the wall? That is\nabnormal. Anyway, but seven of my cousins are in these photographs in the Jewish\nschools of Kiel. Okay, that\u2019s -- all right, now let\u2019s see, where was I? Oh --",
        "Q: Can you -- can we just -- can you just take a diversion now and tell me why the\nnames are different?",
        "A: Yeah, my name --",
        "Q: Your name.",
        "A: -- okay, yeah, okay. I was telling you what I believe, right, was a -- a\nconcentrated effort by the Nazis, you know, to intimidate, to humiliate, to debase, to\ndeprive Jews in the city of Kiel, you know, of -- of a normal living and so forth. And\nthat had started, and that\u2019s where it was at. It started early in the ballgame, because\nour denial of exiting Germany in 1935, when we had everything approved by the\nApril 3, 2008\nUnited States an-and e-e-everything, right, was denied because he was in the -- an\nobservant Jew and he did not carry money. And they didn\u2019t give him the opportunity\neven to come back the next day when he would bring it, okay. I don\u2019t know of any\nindecency, you know, that\u2019s greater than to deny somebody even their right to\nreligious observance. And that\u2019s what that is. Okay, now the next story is a story that\nis also very personal to me, and it is part of this pattern. I believe that it became part\nof the -- our request to immigrate in -- in 1935 in -- I believe. I am not a hundred\npercent certain, but I am 95 minimum certain that the Germans demanded, as part of\nthe exit permits and identi -- they demanded a copy of the birth certificate of my\nfather a-and since he was born in Galicia, a -- what I understand 1s that these people\nwho -- who -- these Jews who lived in Galicia in these small little hamlets or\nvillages or whatever it is, that the --",
        "Q: Shetls?",
        "A: -- y-yeah, that the only marriage that they had was a religious marriage. They\nwere all religious, okay, and the record of their marriages and birth were recorded in\nthe synagogues, but not -- they didn\u2019t marry civilly in that area. Now, in Germany\nthe requirement is that you marry civilly and religiously, but that the only marriage\nwhich is valid and recorded and recognized is the civil marriage. Well, I\u2019m giving\ncredit to the bastards, okay? No, no, I have better words for them, but I am giving\nApril 3, 2008\nthis much as a lawyer, right? A little bit of credit that -- th-that they used the law to\nthen follow up and do the following monstrosity. They demanded, I believe, this\nevidence, the evidence that my -- my father\u2019s birth certificate. Now, I don\u2019t know\nthat he had any kind of evidence, so they -- he didn\u2019t have it, let\u2019s assume, okay,\nbecause obviously he wasn\u2019t civilly registered at his birth. So then they demanded\nproof that his parents were civilly married and they had not been, apparently. So\nwhat they did is this: they demanded of my grandfather that he sign an affidavit, and\nI have a copy of it. I have the original an -- I mean, I have a -- a -- a -- a copy of it.\nAnd in that affidavit, okay I cannot describe totally every word, but what I\nunderstand from this affidavit that he was forced to sign, he was forced to say that\nmy father was his bastard child. Remember, this was the sixth child of his wife and\nhimself, right? This is a devout, you know, couple. My -- my grandmother didn\u2019t\neven have her -- you know, she followed the -- the Jewish Orthodox custom of\nwearing, you know, a wig. I mean, this is about as gross a monstrosity, you know,\nother than -- to debase human being, right. And this affidavit that I have a copy of,\nright, attests to the fact that his son Simche, right, is his bastard child. So now, what\nthey did is they forced a -- a -- a family name change of my father, my mother,\nmyself and my brother. No, not my brother. No, he wasn\u2019t born then. This was in\n1935. So my pursuit and obsession is, to some degree it is to know who we were,\nApril 3, 2008\nwhat we were, where we come from, you know, wh-why -- who were we. Who were\nthese people who were killed in this unjustified manner? So I, in 1988 went to the\nconsulate of Germany in Los Angeles and I was received by -- and I explained to\nthem on the telephone -- and I explained to whoever I-I spoke to, and I suppose it\nwas the legal officer on the -- of the consulate, what I was after. And what I was\nafter in 19 dia -- \u201988 is the beginning of my pursuit to try to prove what happened to\nmy family, so that I could understand, so that I could know, but also so that I could\ntell my wife, my children and my grandchildren and so on, whatever future we have\nin this earth, of what happened to their fore-parents and how wrong this was and\nhow this should never happen again, to anybody. So I went to the consulate, I was\nreceived with extreme courtesy, both by the legal officer and the vice-consul. Both\nwere extremely nice to me, I -- and I explained to them who -- of course, who I was,\nan-and what my interest was, you know, and as a lawyer, you know, practicing in\nLos Angeles, they were extremely professionally connected to me. They were\nconnected also intellectually, I mean, they -- you know, and they were young, you\nknow, people, as I was. And so our discussions were very frank. And so they asked\nme a little bit of my history and I told them, you know, where I come from, where\nmy family comes from, you know, and what happened. And so they se -- I told\nApril 3, 2008\nthem, what I want to do is to establi -- I want a copy of my original birth certificate.\nI want to know why my name was changed.",
        "Q: From --",
        "A: From Weber, which was the name of my father, right. His father, right,\noriginally was born by the name of Weizner. He, when he went to Germany\nchanged it to Weber. Now, I-I will tell you how horrible this is. In the documents\nthat I later obtained from the city of Kiel, the records of the city of Kiel, when he\nbought his different parcels, different l-land ac-acquisition to build this compound,\nthe record -- the record, you know, is there, you know, of his name, of his changed\nname and so forth.",
        "Q: From Weber to Lakritz?",
        "A: From -- no, from my grandfather, from Weizner to Weber.",
        "Q: Oh, Weizner to Weber, right.",
        "A: Right, okay, but from then on he is referred always, you know, from 1914, 19\nwhatever it is, you know, in those records throughout, he\u2019s always referred to as\nArtur Weber.",
        "Q: Weber.",
        "A: Always, always. Never was his name changed, never. So when I ask that my -- I\nwanted a inquiry and obtain the -- the -- my birth certificate, and why was my name\nApril 3, 2008\nchanged? So the German consulate, what they did -- and I couldn\u2019t speak German, I\ncouldn\u2019t write German and I didn't know what to write. So they were absolutely\nwonderful to me. They handwrote the letters, and they, you know, o-of -- of who I\nshould write to. So then I brought it to my secretary and she didn\u2019t speak German\nany more than me. Anyway, we pounded away, you know, the letter and we mailed\nit to Kiel with the proper money that they told me I should send, and I did send it.\nThen -- and they -- they said to me, those two guys, they said, you know, the\nGerman nation, the German people did many horrible things to the Jews, but that it\ndidn\u2019t do. And I said, okay, I want to find out if they did or didn\u2019t do. So I sent for\nthe information and I received information back. And the information I received\nback from Kiel is my new birth certificate and two judgments of two courts in Kiel,\nGermany. One of them 1s a police court, and one is a -- another kind of court, a civil\ncourt, and both of them are judgments ordering the name change of my parents and\nmyself from the last name of Weber, which was our name, to Lakritz.",
        "Q: So you were -- 0-on your original birth certificate it said Weber?",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And then they changed it to Lakritz --",
        "Q: To Lakritz.\nApril 3, 2008",
        "A: -- okay. And I will tell you in a second why, but anyway, these two judgments\nnot only ordered the name change, but they also named the judgments in order that\nmy parents were forbidden to use the name of Weber under penalty of\nimprisonment and imprison -- and -- and fines, something li -- to that effect, okay,\nand again I have limited -- I have no understanding or knowledge of the German\nlanguage, so I -- but I have the documents. So once I had the judgments, I called the\nlegal officer and I had a second meeting with them and I showed them. And they\ncouldn\u2019t believe it, that now I had the judgments of the two German courts, right,\nwhere I was born, right? My father was raised in Kiel, educated in Kiel. They were\nliving there and my grandfather had property there and my God, they were about as\nhonest a people as they obviously could be, compared to their comparative and their\ncontemporaries. And they said they couldn\u2019t believe it, that this had officially been\ndone. And they said well, you know, I mean, there\u2019s nothing to it, you know, just\nchange your name back. And so I said, I don\u2019t know if I can do it, and I don\u2019t know\nthat I\u2019m allowed to do it. I don\u2019t know that my brother will agree to do it. I don\u2019t\nknow what I can do.",
        "Q: Where did the name Lakritz come from?",
        "A: All right. Now, the name of Lakritz is my paternal grandmother\u2019s name.",
        "Q: Okay.\nApril 3, 2008",
        "A: In other words, what these bastards did is they refused to recognize the validity of\nthe marriage between my grandfather and my grandmother and they said, okay,\nyou're the bastard son of this Artur Weber --",
        "Q: [indecipherable] mother\u2019s name --",
        "A: -- do you understand? Now -- then, your legitimate name --",
        "Q: Is your mother --",
        "A: -- 1s your grandmother\u2019s name, Lakritz. Okay, Lakritz, incidentally, in German\nmeans licorice, you know, which is a favorite candy in Germany, particularly in the\nnorthern part and also in Denmark and Sweden. And I had a story to tell about that,\nbut anyway -- but Lakritz is the family name, okay. And my brother, when I had the\nevidence and I asked him in front of his children and my children, come on, we can\nchange our name. And he says, it\u2019s too late. By then, of course, we were grown men\nwith our own children and -- and -- and he says, you know, our name and our history\nis fixed, you know. So we didn\u2019t, and I haven\u2019t. But this is something I carry with\ntremendous resentment. I have resented that they changed my name. I resent it\ntoday, I si -- resent it every day. This is one of the burning things that burns to me.\nSo th-the fact that they denied employment, that they denied exit, that they denied\nmy name, that they imprison us and wanted to deport us with anything and that\nultimately the only thing left was for us to escape, which they did -- we did, of\nApril 3, 2008\ncourse 1-illegally from Germany into Belgium. These were the beginning of part of\nthe picture, I believe, that affected of course, many, many Jews, right, many\nordinary Jews. We were ordinary people, right. And this is the beginning of my life.\nAnd it is something that I have to say, that I am sure has marked my personality and\nmy attitudes and maybe my choice of profession and my relationship to wife and\nchildren and others, because I believe that a child who 1s treated 1n this way, and in\nwhat follows, including the two years of being hidden in France and thinking we\nhad been -- we had no longer had any parents, I believe that this is one of the most\nmonstrous of crimes that\u2019s committed. The rapes and the killing that is done and was\ndone, and is done today, right, against 1-innocent people, you know, in different\nparts of the world I won\u2019t name now, but -- but we\u2019ve had several genocides and one\nor two are going on right now. The aftereffect of what this has to those people who\nare the victim is something that unfortunately is not understood, maybe rightfully so,\nand is not, I think, shared. And I don\u2019t think it\u2019s gi -- ging -- giving credit to these\npoor people. So it\u2019s not just because it happened to me, but I am speaking, you\nunderstand that, for them, you know. It was real for me, it is real for me now and it\nwill be real for them, you know, whether they are over there in Africa, you know, or\nin Asia where it happened, or in other places. So we should not and cannot think of\nthe Holocaust or the other genocides that have occurred simply in the numbers,\nApril 3, 2008\nright. This has to be measured by the effect on people, and that effect is for a\nlifetime.",
        "Q: Mm, yeah. Let\u2019s get back to your particular story now.",
        "A: Yes, but that\u2019s part of -- of the --",
        "Q: No, I understand.",
        "A: -- aftereffect of the story.",
        "Q: Yeah, I know, I-I do understand. So you returned to Kiel, you said?",
        "A: Right, so we return --",
        "Q: Did you go back to your house?",
        "A: Yes, because they couldn\u2019t -- a-according to German law, obviously they could\nnot just take it, right? I mean, the original decree of expulsion, you know, with --\nfollowing the Kristallnacht, you know, arrested us and shipped us, but that failed.\nSo since that wa -- that failed, we -- obviously we had a right to our property, okay?\nAnd yeah, we went back.",
        "Q: You went back to --",
        "A: Right. But from that point on, all right, my mother, who is a very strong woman,\nI\u2019m sure, told my father this is it.",
        "Q: Yeah.\nApril 3, 2008",
        "A: Right. And there\u2019s no more, you know, we\u2019re not staying here, no matter what.\nAnd then, in some ways, they arranged for our exit, our escape from Germany into\nBelgium, and that I remember also.",
        "Q: Do you know how they did it? They ever fi --",
        "A: No. No, no, I mean, th-they -- we were smuggled at nighttime.",
        "Q: When was that?",
        "A: In -- in 1939.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Okay. Exactly when, I am not sure, but it was in 1939 that we were smuggle. I\nremember going under barbed wire, I remember that. I remember the -- the -- the big\ncloud in the sky that I thought it was God. That\u2019s what I remember. And I remember\nthen we landed in Antwerp.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: In -- in Belgium.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And that\u2019s where we landed.",
        "Q: Yeah. Wha -- wha -- and -- and we will, of course, get to that. What did it mean\nto you as a young four or five year old child with all this happening to you? I mean,\nyou\u2019re on a train, then your parents tell you you\u2019re going back home again.\nApril 3, 2008",

        "Q: At that -- at that point.",
        "A: Yes, I\u2019m talking about that point. Look, when the soldier came -- you know, the\nsoldiers that I remember, the soldier --",

I\u2019m sure that\nwas -- the fact that my father [indecipherable] you know, was -- okay. But I also\nbelieve that my parents, being good parents like so many and most good parents,\nright, kept, you know, what was going on, an-and I don\u2019t know that I could\nunderstand. But I did understand that we were going through some rather a-a-\nabnormal, you know, obviously, I mean, I had a very calm, quiet, you know, loving\nfamily, you know?

        "A: -- because the Poles --\nApril 3, 2008",

        "A: -- closed their border that day to our train. So, a miracle happened, as several\nothers happened to those who survived. [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Right. But then you said your mother knew that it was time to leave.",
        "A: Time to leave, yes. And so she, I\u2019m sure, was very instrumental to convince my\nfather, you know, look, a-as difficult as it is to leave our family and -- and our -- and\ny-y-you know, our place in Kiel, you know, with family, we have to protect\nourselves, we have to protect our children, we have to leave this hellhole. Because\nlife obviously, in Germany had become a hell for these remaining Jews. And the\nfuture, you know, offered to my parents obviously, nothing but bad and despair. So\nmy father, who obviously was a very loving father -- I mean son to his father, you\nknow, I\u2019m sure with great pain, you know, this time, left. And this time without the -\n- the dream to go to the -- to the dreamland of California and its golden paved\nstreets. I\u2019m not saying he believed that, but I\u2019m just saying that that was the -- the\nrosy image I\u2019m sure, that must have prevailed at the time. Anyway, I mean,\nsomething convinced my mother to a-ask my -- her uncle for the visa to exit\nGermany and obviously my father consented. And so 1 -- 1 -- you know, obviously\nin 1935, life and its future for a young couple was such that they had decided that\nthey had to uproot.\nApril 3, 2008",
        "Q: But now we\u2019re at 1938.",
        "A: I understand.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: So now there is a totally different set mind or -- or -- or mindset, forgive me, of\nmy parents. Now it\u2019s simply, purely not a matter of choice or -- between degrees,\nright. Now it\u2019s a matter of life and death, and they understood that. So, to protect\ntheir children, right, they smuggled -- they paid for being smuggled out of\nGermany. They left property behind, their parents, his parents, family, everybody\nbehind to do that. Now, this is important to demonstrate the character of my parents.\nAt that time they did everything they could to save their children and they left to\nprotect and to save their children, not to save themselves. And again we see the\nsame repetition of their actions in August of 1942, and the title of the movie, one\nmovie was, \u201cInto the Arms of Strangers\u201d, they are the absolute example of\nsending their children into the arms of stranger, of an unknown, to save them. And if\nthey had not done that we would all have perished in August 1942 when they were\narrested and put in concentration camp in France.",
        "Q: Okay, we-we\u2019ll get to that, let\u2019s [indecipherable]",
        "A: Now, I unde-understand, but the things have to tie if they do tie. And the type of\npeople that my parents were, as other people\u2019s parents were, who attempted to save\nApril 3, 2008\ntheir children, even at the peril of their own lives is one of the recorded evidence of\nwhat happened to people. At some point some people actually had a choice, and the\nchoice was made to save the children. And I am one of those. I am an -- a survivor\nsolely because of that, only because of that.

We were learning Jewish songs and I don\u2019t know,\nwhatever it is, I wasn\u2019t learning the alphabet well enough, I wasn\u2019t learning the\nsongs well enough, I -- there was something I didn\u2019t --",
        "Q: Can you sing one or two lines of a song?",
        "A: No, I -- right now -- it\u2019s something about around -- being around the fireplace or\nthe fire. It was something around the fire --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- or fireplace. I don\u2019t remember it now [indecipherable]. But anyway that was\none [indecipherable] I mean, God, th-there were many others, I\u2019m sure. In any\nevent, if you want to know my recollection that I have of Antwerp, the -- they\u2019re\ninteresting too. I remember going to a synagogue with my mother, upstairs right, we\nwere there, I remember that. I remember one time seeing a funeral in Antwerp and I\nhad never seen such a thing. And here was this horse draped in black and the whole\nhearse was black and people were following this hearse in black and I, for some\nApril 3, 2008\nreason, was walking on the street by myself and I saw this, I was fascinated and I\nremember watching it. I remember that. I also remember that we lived upstairs in\nthis apartment in Antwerp and there was one time I was with my father and going\ndownstairs and he didn\u2019t really want me to look at what was there. There was blood\non the walls, and I was curious, I say what di -- what di -- what -- you know, why 1s\nthere blood in the hall? And my father, he -- he -- he was fumbling, I think to\nexplain to me that a man living in the building had an accident and he fell down the\nstairs and you know, obviously he had a bad scene.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: But anyway, so the struggle of my father trying to protect his son, you know,\nfrom a horrible scene, you know, again it underscores, you know, the tremendous\nhumanity, you know, of people even in the worst of circumstances. Anyway, I\nremember my mother\u2019s sister, who also had fled from Cologne, she -- they had fled\nin Mathus and Anver.",
        "Q: Did your -- did your mother ever tell you later why they went to Antwerp?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: You -- so you don\u2019t know -- was it the resistance that got them out to Antwerp?",
        "A: No, I -- I --",
        "Q: Yo-You don\u2019t know why --\nApril 3, 2008",
        "A: -- I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: All right. All I know is that we were smuggle into Germany -- I mean to\nBelgium --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- and that\u2019s what I mean, and we ended up in Anver.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: I also know that my mother\u2019s sister and her husband and two of her sons --",
        "Q: Were there.",
        "A: -- they were there in Anver, as well as us.",
        "Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.",
        "A: And I remember them, ma -- my aunt and uncle and her two sons who were very\ntall in my eyes, visiting us. I remember sitting on the lap of my uncle and that I had\na real good time with him and that he --",
        "Q: So you were not afraid dur -- as a little boy --",
        "A: Oh no.",
        "Q: -- at that time --",
        "A: No, no, no --",
        "Q: -- it was just an adventure or something.\nApril 3, 2008",
        "A: -- no, no, no, no. My father had become nervous and easy for him to get upset\nand I remember him scolding me about the way that I was making too much noise\neating. So I -- th-there\u2019s no question that my father was a changed person, in that the\nevents which follow, you know, created more of a change in him, but not towards\nmy mother, not towards his children, but the way he behaved and -- and he would\nget angry easily, something that -- that was totally strange to me, and so this 1s part\nof th-th-the whole episode.",
        "Q: When you were in school in Antwerp with the other little Jewish children --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- they were just -- you were just playing like little children.",
        "A: Yeah, there was nothing.",
        "Q: Yeah, nothing to indicate what was happening.",
        "A: Nothing, no, nothing.",
        "Q: Okay, now it\u2019s May 1940.",
        "A: Okay, now, before it -- yeah, it\u2019s May 1940, okay --",
        "Q: What happened?",
        "A: -- and I remember the following. I remember my aunt and uncle coming to say\ngoodbye to us, okay, and I-I don\u2019t remember if they came upstairs, cause they\nprobably did, but I -- you know, I assume that. But anyway, I remember them\nApril 3, 2008\nspecifically looking down, you know, from the second story, third story of this\nbuilding that we lived in and looking at them and saying goodbye. Of course -- I\nshouldn\u2019t say of course, but that the last that we ever saw of them, the four of them.\nAnd they were leaving and we shortly were also leaving Antwerp, so were others.\nAnd I assume, but I\u2019m not certain that the city had already been bombed, that the\nbombing had started by the German Air Force. But in any event I know from later,\nthese people, my aunt and uncle had a young daughter, n -- and not to depart, but at\nleast to -- and that daughter was left with a couple in Holland. Why -- I don\u2019t know\nall the circumstances. My cousin, her name is Adele Mendelssohn, and she is alive,\nand she is in -- she\u2019s older than me but not by that much. And she was hidden by this\nfamily in Holland, a Christian family in -- who had another girl, right, a daughter,\nyou know. And they, throughout the war saved my cousin Adele, s-saying publicly\nthat this was th-their second child, you understand, and they raised er -- er -- you\nknow, both children. She survived the war. After the war my uncle, Michael Fass,\nwho went in our place when we couldn\u2019t go in 1935 to Oakland to emigrate, then\nmy great-uncle sponsored my -- her brother, my mother\u2019s brother, my Uncle Fass,\nand they, the whole family emigrated, went to Oakland in our place. And -- so after\nthe war, when Adele was left er -- as total -- as an orph -- orphan, they -- Uncle\nMike sponsored her and they got her to emigrate to Oakland and she lived with\nApril 3, 2008\nthem until she married, and -- which I witnessed, and she still lives in Oakland.\nAnyway, so she survive in that manner. And how and why she was separated from\nher family, I don\u2019t know, I-I only know that she was.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And I know that she was raised and saved by this Christian couple in Holland,\nwhom she has honored in many, many ways, including designating them as the\nrighteous -- as Righteous Jews.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Which they deserve. Anyway, where was I? Oh yeah, we\u2019re leaving.",
        "Q: Where -- you\u2019re leaving.",
        "A: Okay, we\u2019re leaving Antwerp, okay. What I remember is being on the train and I\nremember hearing bombing, all right, that I didn\u2019t understand, right, but I remember\ndistinctly, you know, as a child. I am now five and three quarters --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: -- years of age, right, and I remember hearing the bombing. Then the next thing\nthat I know is we land in the city called Marmande, M-a-r-m-a-n-d-e, we li -- end\nup there.",
        "Q: This is in France.\nApril 3, 2008",
        "A: In France. It\u2019s in the department of Lot-et-Garonne. It is very close to the\nDordogne, to Bergerac. It is very close to Bordeaux and the wine country, and\nthere\u2019s a very agricultural, beautiful part of France and that I love greatly. And we\nend up in a big warehouse, that\u2019s what I remember. And I remember we were\nsleeping on straw, and hundreds --",
        "Q: This is the four of you?",
        "A: Yeah, the four of us. The four of us lan -- and we, among other other other --\nmaybe a few hundred people who fled with us from Belgium were housed in this\nwarehouse, and sleep there and provided some food, you know, I\u2019m sure. And by\nGod\u2019s choice, later on, after the war, my mother is able to rent an apartment which is\nright across the street from this warehouse. And there\u2019s another coincidence of\nsignificance in my history that also happens --",
        "Q: Did you know what was happening as this almost six year old child, what -- what\nwas [indecipherable]",
        "A: Well, you know --",
        "Q: Again that sense of danger, that sense --",
        "A: A-And that -- let me tell you, the only thing I can remember, all right, and what\nfollows has significant emotional feelings. I knew things were wrong. I knew things\nwere not right. I knew things that whatever stability was born into this world, and I\nApril 3, 2008\nwas, I was in a very stable family and environment, and I thank God -- this was no\nlonger stable. Of course I didn\u2019t understand the circumstance --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- I didn\u2019t understand the enormity of what was happening to us. But in the\nbottom line of what was happening to us, must be recorded. We, along with\nthousands and thousands of Belg, fled Belgium because of the invasion of the\nGerman armies into Holland, into Belgium, and Luxembourg. They ultimately\nwent back home to their homes and to their businesses and their jobs and so forth\nand families. We remained. We were total and absolute refugees. We were total\nstateless people. We had totally no rights. We had no property, we had no money,\nwe had nothing. We had no rights. And we were able to remain in France only by\npolice authority and permits, which had to be renewed every 30 days. We were\nliving the life of people who have no rights to be, to live, to aspire, to hope,\nanything. We were returned to a state where you are now totally dependent on the\nwhim, the laws, the rudity, the -- the -- the anti whatever 1s, you know, whether --\nthat existed at France at that time. Obviously I didn\u2019t understand all of that.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Obviously I didn\u2019t know the history of France, I had no knowledge of why we\nwere even there. I didn\u2019t understand anything. But what follows is I began to\nApril 3, 2008\nunderstand that we were not very stable, that we were not -- and yet, I was stable. I\nhad a mother and father who were the marvel -- marvel of the world. And I had a\nbrother, and of course we were the boys and we lived in -- as boys do. I have two\nbeautiful, magnificent grandsons and I see them growing up and I was no different,\nyou know, in terms of fighting and playing with each other, you know -- you know.\nAnd my brother and I were magnificent as -- as brothers. So the fact that we had\neach other and I wasn\u2019t an only child was very important. The fact that we had such\nloving, caring and responsible and protective parents was [indecipherable]. But the\ntruth of our lives were really terrible. And so from this warehouse, living on straws,\nthe others left, and I experienced this abandonment again and again in my life. We\nremained. And I don\u2019t know how, but anyway, they allowed us to have an apartment\nand my father went as a laborer to work for the city of Marmande. And he was a\nhealthy guy and he was strong and he was able, and -- not that he was very big, he --\nI\u2019m sure he was a little bit shorter than me, but about the same height. And I\nremember one of the things that he worked on. And he worked on setting up the --\nthe -- in the -- in the plaza, a big plaza in -- in Oakland, called the Plaza de Marie,\nwhere we later on lived --",
        "Q: In Oakland? What do you mean?",
        "A: No, I mean, not in Oakland. Did I say Oakland? No, no, this is in Marmande --\nApril 3, 2008",
        "Q: Marmande",
        "A: Marmande -- ma -- no, no, this is Marmande, okay. And he helped to erect, you\nknow, the -- the -- the -- the walls that was -- that were to surround this celebration.\nAnd this celebration was one of the games of the German and the Vichy\ngovernment. In this little city of 15,000 people, thereabouts, there was to be a\nnationalistic event to celebrate how France, right, had a future and France survived\nand France was in honor in f -- 1n spite of its defeat, in f -- in spite of its -- that they\nhad cut th-the country in God knows what, the portion. The Vichy government was,\nof course, the southern parts of -- of France. I was then in the Vichy government\nsection of France and Germany had taken say two-thirds a-as far as their dependent\nstate. And that Vichy government supposedly was an independent part of France,\nokay. Under the Vichy government, Vichy is simply because that\u2019s where the -- the\ngovernment of Marshal Petain was allowed to -- to be. There\u2019s two parts to this\nstory, neither one of them good, about France. This prefect, or this government\nemployee came to this city for this national celebration, and what was the purpose of\nit? The purpose was to invigorate the people, that their lot, being a defeated people,\nconquered people now, under the boot of the Germans, whom they hated, right,\nwhom they had fought 1n two wars, in the 1870 wars and the 1914-18 wars. France\n-- French people did not like the Germans, the boche they called them, that\u2019s the\nApril 3, 2008\nhated term, right, equal to the pigs. Now, the pigs, the boche now were in charge of\nFrance, and they had taken two-thirds of France. They had taken, you know, the\nbig city, Paris in the north and then all the industrial wealth and the coal, and all of\nthe -- the -- in the east, Normandy and -- and -- and -- and th-the glory. And they\nleft a little southern part, which was agricultural, you know, and wine country and\nthen the Cote d\u2019Azur and then the access to Spain. Basically a region without\npower, without economy, other than agricultural, and you know, where th-there was\nnot th-th-the great population, you know, that you have in Paris, and with Lyon and\nso forth, so forth. Okay, now, this guy came for one purpose and that purpose was to\nreinvigorate these people out of the sense of defeat and so forth, and they had this\nbig celebration. So my father was one of those employed to set this party up, okay.\nWhat followed either preceded this or followed this is the imposition now of French\nlaws, which equaled and in some ca -- exceeded the anti-Semitism of the German\nlaws. Now, as a lawyer, you know, throughout my history, and the purpose of my\ngiving this testimony is not merely to relate, you know, pain and suffering and death\nand numbers. It is to relate the context. The context, what happened, right, to the\nJews of -- of my family, is the persecution, the anti-Semitism, the hate, right, the\nmonstrosity, right, that they created. The Germans created, right -- these guys\nfantasized and invented a system of super race and super -- you know the history,\nApril 3, 2008\nyou don\u2019t want me to talk, but it is important in my part of the story that now French\nlaws follows and equates, right, in its anti-Semitism and a -- and its limitation on --\non -- on the rights of Jews, and certainly absolutely on the rights of immigrant Jews.\nAnd in France, with a history of anti-Semitism, of Catholicism, of teaching of the\nhatred of the Jewish people, right. We were the damned people, the condemned\npeople, even though we were the -- the creators of their religion and supposedly, you\nknow, ours was the-the-their chosen God, you know. Anyway, the French, not just\nin the Dreyfus Affair, but had a history of anti-sem -- Semitism and that history,\neven though it was not, you know, on the surface, it existed in reality. And I became\nnow a part of that history. And my history is how these people dealt with all of these\nformulas, all of these factors that were facing them, the Christian, right, French. And\nI now am in this milieu, in this -- and how these people deal with the world as it\u2019s\nevolving out of their control, and the minimal amount of their choice, or the choices\nthat they make either actively or passively, with regard to people like me, is part of\nthe reflection of their religious education, their family education, right, and their\nlaws. And the laws of France, to the shame of France, right, went to adopt German\nanti-Semitic laws and gave to the -- to the Germans the right to dictate to the Vichy\ngovernment what the French police, the French states and the French functionary\nwould do to the Jews, particularly the refugee -- refugee Jews.\nApril 3, 2008\nEnd of Tape Two, Side A\nBeginning Tape Two, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\nvolunteer collection interview with Alfred Lakritz. This is tape two, side B, and\nyou were telling about after May 1940 --",
        "A: Right --",
        "Q: -- in Marmande --",
        "A: -- okay, now --",
        "Q: -- France.",
        "A: -- what I remember is I said is my father working to set up this f\u00e9te, they call it --",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: -- in France. And I also remember a little thing like I remember walking and\nsmelling the roses. I remember being fascinated by snails after the rain. And I\nremember one lady telling me to go collect snails for her and I did, and so she gave\nme some money. And again, an act of kindness that again I wa -- re-repeated later.\nAnyway, that\u2019s what I remember basically of Marmande and I remember where\nthat apartment was. Again it was an upstairs apartment. I know that it was close to\nthe tomato -- tomato factory.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.\nApril 3, 2008",
        "A: Marmande is a city that is famous for its tomato, and the Marmande tomato\nwas very, very famous in France.",
        "Q: Hm.",
        "A: In fact, on the -- on the streets of Paris where they sell the produce, my brother\nsaid that he found, you know, stands that said Marmande tomato, and later on I\nfound out that in the recent years they change the tomato, an -- and anyway -- to\naccommodate machinery. But in any event -- yeah -- but anyway, that\u2019s what I\nremember about Marmande. But then comes a change. We are no longer allowed to\nlive in Marmande. We are now forced to take up residence in the little hamlet\noutside of Marmande, seven or eight kilometers from Marmande. And this little\nhamlet is called Saint-Pardoux-du-Breuil. Saint-Pardoux-du-Breuil now is of\nimportant development in my memory because then I really understand. My eyes are\nopen, I really remember, I really see.",
        "Q: How old are you now? This is when? This is --",
        "A: This is sometime in the 1940, I mean, or \u00b041.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: I believe it\u2019s in the 40\u2019s. I -- I don\u2019t think that we live in Marmande very long,\nbecause the city, the police, would not allow us to stay there longer. I don\u2019t know,\nbut I suspect that because -- and I suspect this because of the fact that I learned when\nApril 3, 2008\nI visited Saint-Pardoux again -- and I\u2019ve done that several times after the war, I\nlearned then that there were several Jewish families in -- that lived around or in the\nhamlet, around the hamlet. And I suspect that there was probably a good French\nchoice in that. I believe that they kicked us out of Marmande to put us in an area\nwhere collectively we were separated, but we were separated from the city, but we\nwere easy picking for when they wanted to --",
        "Q: So it was the French that determined where you moved?",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: The French. The French police, the French city hall. A -- they made --",
        "Q: Ordered you to go to this next --",
        "A: -- y -- oh yeah, yeah, and they -- and -- okay. Now, I forgot one incident in\nMarmande which is very important in my life, and I have to go back to just this one\npoint. I remember my father conducting the high holiday services in Marmande.",
        "Q: So this is fall of 1940?",
        "A: Yes. And I remember my father also blowing the Shofar during the service, and I\nremember the room, th-the -- the -- the -- some parts of the ceremony, you know,\nthat I remember. He, of course, was a very religious Jew, and a very intelligent man.\nAnyway, so he conducted the service. Well, as God would have it, when we were\nApril 3, 2008\nreunited with my mother in November 1944, the city of Marmande allocated to her\nthat apartment, and we lived in that apartment in -- 1t was 1-1-in -- that building was a\nhistoric building, it 1s a historic building and street. It is a magnificent building,\nwhich comes from the Middle Ages, right, and it stands t-today, and it -- it\u2019s\nbeautiful, it\u2019s --",
        "Q: What is the address?",
        "A: The address is on a little street that I cannot remember the name of, but it is -- I\nmean, it\u2019s probably, I think probably the only really historical street of Marmande,\nright, and I\u2019m sure those buildings were available because they were historical\ndocument to the city -- I mean, buildings to the city. And we lived again on the\nsecond story, seemed to live in second story. And we were given that building. And\nthat building, I don\u2019t know that it had electricity, and it had dark staircases and entry\nhall. The building was made up of mud and wood, you know, an-and -- and wheat --\nI mean, and -- and a -- you know, the remains of -- of -- of wheat. I-In other words,\nthis was the construction. But it\u2019s beautiful, you know, it\u2019s very authentic, you\nknow, and -- and there are other buildings like that down this little narrow street of\nOakland, which they preserved, you know --",
        "Q: Of Marmande.\nApril 3, 2008",
        "A: Of Marmande. Of Marmande. It is Marmande, I am not talking about\nOakland, I haven\u2019t gotten to Oakland. But anyway -- and I remember we living in\nthat apartment after. But anyway -- so, before we go to Saint-Pardoux-du-Breuil,\nthis is what I remember, my father conducting the religious services, and I probably\n-- it would be a guess, but I would bet you that everybody there is dead, that died,\narrested by the French police, turned over to the Nazis all [indecipherable] which\nraises the other question, the question which is, you know, how can God have\nabandoned all his people?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: If we were in fact the chosen people, this is what we were chosen for? So there 1s\nlegitimate religious dialog which is another of the [indecipherable] in my history.\nMy -- law is on one s -- hand, family and love and -- and -- and -- and -- and -- and\nthe sense of obligation and commitment and protection to the children, of your\nchildren, to preserve them. And now comes this other question of, you know, where\nis God 1n all of this? Where is God we\u2019re in the trenches, right? Where is God, you\nknow? What have we done, God, to deserve this ultimate punishment? We are\ndamned, condemned, hated, despised, you know, abandoned in every sense of the\nword. We have no rights, we have no property, everything is taken from us. God,\nwhy? You chose us according to our religion to be the chosen people. Did you also\nApril 3, 2008\nchoose us to be this ultimate suffer -- and if we have been chosen, right, for that,\nthen my story is the testament that I want to leave to my children, grandchildren an-\nand generations forever, because if there is a truth here, then there 1s an equal truth\nhere. But if there 1s a lie here, then there is another one, right? In other words, if\nthere is no God, if there 1s no religion, obviously then there\u2019s no commitment, there\nis no covenant, there is no obligation, right, and religion is a farce. But if there 1s,\nwhy did this happen to us, you know? And so this is a dialog, a philosophical\nquestion which has to be posed, right, and maybe it has no answer, and that\u2019s okay.\nNor is there proof that there is a God. But the point 1s, all of these things intersect,\nintellectually, morally, religiously, philosophically, in my life. And then what\nhappens? Okay, anyway, we end up in this village of Saint-Pardoux. It\u2019s not a\nvillage, it\u2019s a hamlet. The people there are magnificent people. We are given a\nhabitat and that habitat, and I will call it that, is a mud floor, it is a chicken coop and\non the other side there\u2019s the -- the cows, and -- and that\u2019s there whatever it is, I\u2019ve\nforgotten now. Okay, and we live in this chicken coop, two rooms, mud, no\nelectricity, of course. And it had the little well and the little area for a garden that\nlater my father creates. And this was given to us by the Marshal Feron. The\nMarshal Feron lived across the street, this 1s his property, the -- the property is of\nhis mother across the street, but the cows are hers, right. And this Marshal Feron is\nApril 3, 2008\na very devout Catholic. One of his sons is in the seminary at the time to become a --\na -- amonk. And we\u2019re given -- we\u2019re loan -- we\u2019re given this place, without, of\ncourse, charge.",

        "Q: To each other?",
        "A: No. My parents speak German to us. Okay, well, I will tell you about this. This is\nanother of these anomalies or -- you know. First, this man and his wife are very,\nApril 3, 2008\nvery religious Catholics. They give us this place to live. This was the same place\nthey gave to people who escaped Spain in the Spanish war. And people -- those\npeople fled from there to Saint-Pardoux-du-Breuil. Why, I don\u2019t know. They\noccupied the same place and they left later on back to Spain. Well now comes, right,\nthis part of history, right, which is connected to the other history, right, to the -- this,\nand now they\u2019re refugees again. And so these people again, with their good hearts\nand their good attitude and their good intention, they lend it to us and they help. N --\nthis 1s part of the Berny, B-e-r-n-y family, and these people, the little street up to --\nlittle bit of a hill from where we lived to where they -- their homes and his -- his --\nhis shop where he makes the metal horses and the metal -- I mean, the -- the shoe for\nthe horses and he makes hoes and he makes hammers and he makes all these things,\nthis wonderful guy. And up the street is the school. And in -- the two room school,\nand I go to school. And I -- my first el -- schooling -- wait a minute, hold on a\nminute. I also went to school in Marmande for a short time. I started school in\nMarmande, yes, the very, very first grade, whatever it 1s, right, that I am -- I am six\nyears old --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- so the first grade. Yeah, I remember. Ah -- yeah. My first day in school was in\nMarmande, okay? So we still there October, November, okay, maybe December,\nApril 3, 2008\nbut anyway -- but I\u2019m in the school. And I remember raising my hand in the class to\ngo to the bathroom. I needed to go to the bathroom and the teacher didn\u2019t see me, so\nI pissed in my pants, okay. I ri -- and maybe she didn\u2019t understand because I didn\u2019t\nunderstand, but I remember raising my hand, and I remember that. I also remember\nthat we were learning a French poem, with -- a very famous poem from La\nFountain, | think or -- about the hare and the rabbit, and I remember that in that\nclass. That\u2019s all I remember in that class. But anyway, then we go back to my story\nin the hamlet, in -- in that par -- Saint-Pardoux-du-Breuil. Okay, now, this is a\nvery, very, very interesting and traumatic episode in my life. The Berny family\nowned a lot, an empty lot across from the schoolhouse. And they gave my father the\ntask, the job to raise a garden for them in this lot. And I remember going up to him\nand bringing him lunch, and I remember him kissing me. He was all sweaty and had\nbeard and all of that. Oh, that re -- that reminds me. I remember also the city of\nMarmande had given us a garden. A place where we co -- where each family could\nhave its own little garden and cultivate their own vegetable. I remember that now.\nSo maybe we were in Marmande maybe a little bit longer, you know. But anyway,\nI remember that and there is a connect to that one. Gee, I didn\u2019t remember that in\nawhile. Okay, anyway, he was there. Okay, now I went to that school, and I\nremember learning to count with sticks, and so we had sticks, packs of 10, right, and\nApril 3, 2008\nwe had a rubber band around them an-and that -- we learned to count there. Okay, I\nremember that, but I also remember something else that was not so nice. I remember\nthe other boys -- other boys, they grabbed me and they tied me or something to the\nfence and they said that I was the Christ killer and that they wanted to punish me or\nwhatever it 1s, and -- I told this story also to this French historian and she reported it\nin her book, and I am sure this happened. That\u2019s why she reported it in her book.\nThat in this environment of Saint-Pardoux-du-Breuil, you have this play of\nattitudes of people. Here is this family being helped and sheltered, allowed to\nsurvive, when nobody was allowed to give work to the refugee Jews, and yet they\ndid. And at the same time, the children of others of the age of six and seven, equal to\nme, target me as a Christ killer. And obviously they didn\u2019t come up on this on their\nown. Obviously this was taught to them. Obviously this underlines what was\nhappening and the crimes of the Catholic church are now descended on me. And\nthey descend on my father, because what follows, right, is a choice made by French\npolice, and French government and French -- and I have that whole testimony laying\naround that I will tell, about one of the men who had the power and didn\u2019t exercise it\nto save my father\u2019s life, but who confessed to me that if he had known that the chief\nof police, his friend, right, he was the exec -- my friend Guyaux, right? Gerard\nGuyaux, a man of extremely great kindness and character. This man, at -- one of the\nApril 3, 2008\ntimes I went back to France, and this time to reward him for what he did for my\nmother, my father\u2019s memory and for us. I gave him a plaque as I gave to others. And\nthis man said to me -- admitted something to me, and he says, there\u2019s nothing they\ncan do to me any more, I\u2019m too old, but I could have saved your father\u2019s life. And if\nyou blew a bomb right there in front of me, I -- I don\u2019t think -- among the many,\nmany shocks that I\u2019ve had in life, this was one. And he -- and he explained to me\nwhy. He said to me, when they ordered the arrest of your father, and I participated in\nthe arrest -- cause he was the chief officer of the city of Marmande, and Saint-\nPardoux is within the -- the -- the -- the -- the -- the power and the sphere -- the\nspace -- the jurisdictional surrounding of Marmande, under its jurisdiction. He said,\nI could have saved him, but I didn\u2019t know that the police, the chief of police, was of\nthe same mind as I, that we didn\u2019t want this killing of innocent Jews. We didn\u2019t want\nto make the choice between refugee Jews and French-born Jews. But I didn\u2019t know\nthat, and he didn\u2019t know I could trust him, and I didn\u2019t know I could trust him. And\nso when your father was ordered to be arrested in March 1942, he was arrested,\nobviously, with the consent and the cooperation of the city of Kiel, and the police of\nKiel and of him.",
        "Q: Kiel?\nApril 3, 2008",
        "A: I mean of -- of -- of Marmande. I am sure that the things that he did for my\nmother after the war and for my brother and I was to repent and to atone for what he\nhad done. I\u2019m telling you, my father\u2019s name stands on the war memorial of -- of\nMarmande. My father\u2019s name also is in another memorial farther in France, I don\u2019t\nknow where [indecipherable], course he is in there and the memorial to the Jews\nthat were deported from France, which is in Paris, that they have built in recent\nyears. But the one in Marmande is the one that means something. He became the\nmajor of the city of Marmande. He became the representative from that region to\nthe assem -- French assembly. He was a -- a man of tremendous personality and\ncharacter, and again, a very religious man, a very French man. And again, they --\nthis interplay, you know, of -- of -- of what they feel, what they do, and what they --\nand who they are, all right? It -- 1t plays into this whole -- you know? And what\nfollows again 1s this conflict, between others who are obeying orders, others who are\nwillingly passive, others who are willingly complicit and others who are morally --\na-a-a-a-abhor, and afraid or you know, feel impotent to do anything. And so all of\nthese people, I meet all of them. So, when I\u2019m in school I\u2019m treated well by the\nteacher and a -- you know, I\u2019m allowed in school, and I\u2019m just a normal kid. But the\nkids in the playground, I\u2019m not the normal kid, I\u2019m a Jew, dirty Jew, right? The\nBerny family, one of their son is the guy who is the vicar to the church. The church\nApril 3, 2008\nis -- in this hamlet there is a very prominent church, a very beautiful church\n[indecipherable] in the Marshal Feron, right, and the rest of it are farms, and this\nis a very, you know, beautiful, other than the school. Anyway, I remember many\nthings. And one time I went back and the son of Berny, right, who had quit the\nmonastery, you know, when I met him, I did -- you know, when the -- you know. So\nhe didn\u2019t become a full fledged priest or monk, or you know. He chose not to. So\nwhen we revisited one time, my wife and I, the first time we went there, I took my\nchildren, and I couldn\u2019t enter the building, that chicken coop, it was locked and there\nwas nobody around, you know. But another time we came back and they were there,\nthe Bernys. And so they -- he took me around. And he said to me, you were an\nextraordinary child. He says, you learned the patois, which is the local French. You\nlearned it in no time at all, you could speak it as well as anybody. And he says, you\nused to sit on my lap and I would read you stories, you know. He says, I was amazed\nthat you could speak French, you know, you could speak the patois, and obviously I\nunderstood my parents who spoke German. And they were learning, you know,\nFrench too. And so, I guess he really liked me, and well, a lot of people, you know,\na-as a child that I was liked. But above all, my brother was liked more. You know,\nhe was a very loving and the second child in family, or the second boy in the family,\nthey\u2019re always innocent, they\u2019re always sweet, right? And so he was. Now, for some\nApril 3, 2008\nreason my mother, to help us 1n our survival, got a sewing machine and she started\nto sew. And because of the hard work of my father, you know, toiling in -- in other\npeople\u2019s jardin -- gardens, my mother started to do seamstress work. And because\nof that she was able to survive, through that skill. Now, the life for us in -- in Saint-\nPardoux-du-Breuil is a very interesting -- it\u2019s very pastoral, it\u2019s very country, it\u2019s a\nlittle hamlet. Everything -- you walk. If there is any transportation it is by either\ncamp -- two cows pulling a wagon, or one horse pulling a wagon. I remember many\nmen many times -- my mother would send me to this farm to buy some milk or to\nsend me someplace to get bread and you had to go there, walk there. And once in\nawhile, you know, people would give me rides, you know, on these wagon. I\nremember everybody was so nice, they would give you a ride, you know. And I\nremember walking on this little street and they grew watercress, and that was\nwonderful. I remember. But anyway -- and my father cultivated a garden and -- in\nour -- 1n our -- in the side yard. And I remember that he used human excrement as\npart of the fertilizer, and we were together. And a lot of it was happy, and some of it\n-- Iremember my father getting mad at me and yelling at me, and my mother\nprotecting me and I was running around my mother\u2019s skirts, and holding onto her\nskirt when he was yelling at me and my mother was yelling back at my father to shut\nup and whatever. Anyway, here comes June, July, 1942. I am just eight years old,\nApril 3, 2008\nand I am now condemned to become an adult. My parents decide, through some\nJewish agency, whatever, to send us to a summer camp. And we leave Marmande,\nSaint-Pardoux-du-Breuil. | remember the railroad station, my parents bringing us\nto the railroad station. I remember the last look I had of my father ever, there waiting\non the quay, or the -- what we call -- what do we call? Well, whatever we call now,\nwith my mother --",
        "Q: The platform?",
        "A: -- wa -- platform, right, waving us goodbye and I remember waving them\ngoodbye, of course never thinking that anything was in the offing. But that\u2019s the last\ntime we ever saw our father. I was just eight years old, my brother was less than six\nyears old. And on this train we went, and I believe we went to a summer camp in the\nCreuse. The Creuse is the C-r-e-u-s-e of southwest France. And we are in this\nsummer camp, operated by some Jewish organization. It could be the OSE, okay, I\nam not certain, but I believe that it -- it is them.\nEnd of Tape Two, Side B\nApril 3, 2008\nBeginning Tape Three, Side A",
        "Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\nvolunteer collection interview with Alfred Lakritz. This is tape number three, side\nA, and you were talking about going to the summer camp 1n the s -- 1942.",
        "A: Right. Now, we\u2019re in this camp with Jewish children, run by Jewish adult leaders\nand -- and everything is wonderful and normal and so forth, as far as a child 1s\nconcerned. It\u2019s play, it\u2019s hiking, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s everything, it\u2019s games. Suddenly there is a\nday that I can never forget. I\u2019m brought in with my brother to the office of Mr.\nKohn. [ only know his name by the fact that I have four of the letters of my father of\nwhat prompted that particular meeting. And this Mr. Kohn says to me and my\nbrother that our parents want us to stay with them. And I then develop terror. I don\u2019t\nthink there is any other word to describe what I felt then. I saw out of the window\nthat other children were leaving with their baggage, whatever th-they ha -- they had\nand here is me and my brother in this dark office and this man at this desk telling me\nthat my parents don\u2019t want us to go home, that they want us to stay. And I have a\nbrother who is not even six years old. I am just eight years old, and I am now put in\na position that I have to understand, or cope and deal with the idea that somehow our\nparents don\u2019t want us to come home, but other children are going home to their\nparents. I am not going. That\u2019s impossible. There is no way you can explain my\nApril 3, 2008\nabsolute connect. This is the first time I\u2019d ever left my parents, ever, and they -- they\nsend me on the summer camp with other children, to play and have fun. That\u2019s --\nokay? Other children were there to play and to f -- have fun, too. But that they\nshould go home to their parent, and I -- they want us to stay? That is a moment of\nabsolute terror. Total incomprehension. Th-There is nothing that can describe it,\nnothing that can describe my feeling at that moment. I am paralyzed, I am horrified,\nI am scared, I cannot comprehend. This is one moment in my life where nothing\nmakes any sense. And believe me, that has impacted my life forever. That moment.\nThat revelation. And of course I had no understanding what, why, but the total\nincomprehension. I mean how could my parents, you understand, make this\njudgment? They -- it\u2019s impossible. Anyway, I remember being there, and from that\nmoment, for the next two and a half years, I became the guardian of my brother.\nAnd I became obsessed that he should never be separated from me for a moment,\nbecause I was afraid of what was going to happen. If he was separated they may take\nhim away from me, an-and no way. So, I succeeded in most terms, but there was a\nperiod of time when he was housed someplace and I was housed in another one, but\nthat became an obsession with me, that I would go into freaky periods if they\nsuggested anything that I should be separated from my brother, or my brother should\nbe separated from me. So these other children went home, and a few children stayed.\nApril 3, 2008\nAnd we stayed with these, some of the Jewish -- for lack of another term, I mean\nthey were adult supervisor, guardians, whatever you want to call them, in this camp.\nNow, they then proceeded on a plan, and the plan I can only describe is a plan of\nsurvival of our people. They put us through the ritual of every holiday, we had to\nobserve them absolutely. We had to put handkerchiefs on our wrist on Shabbas, we\nhad to observe every holiday religiously. I remember the last one we observed was\nSukkoth. I -- 1-1-1n that place in -- in -- in -- one of them had drawn a map of -- of\nIsrael -- Palestine on -- on a -- a thing with a light bulb behind it, and this was in\nblue, th-the -- the whole region. I remember that very well. I remember games being\nplayed, you know, then they would toss us in -- in blankets, you understand, I mean,\nwe were little kids.",
        "Q: How many children were with you?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember, but there were very few.",
        "Q: Very few?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: And you\u2019re still in the camp --",
        "A: It\u2019s not a camp in the sense -- I -- it\u2019s fenced. It\u2019s on a little, you know, a little\ncountry house --",
        "Q: Really?\nApril 3, 2008",
        "A: -- you know, it\u2019s a country house.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Okay, and I have pictures after the fact, a few.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: But in this camp I have the absolute conviction that these Jews had a sense of\nimpending doom. That they were teaching us only about Judaism, only about our\nreligion, only about the Promised Land, only about the -- I remember that. And I\nhave the absolute conviction that these people were trying to preserve our religion\nand our people in th -- whatever means they had, and that -- in the hope that some of\nus would survive. Now, I remember several incidents, but let me tell you one. And\nthis incident is recalled by another child, not necessarily in the same place, but the\nsame event happened to him. And of course I don\u2019t know him, and I didn't know,\nbut in the French book that was written by this French historian of the Jews, what\nhappened, the Jews in the Lot-et-Garonne of France that she researched, among\nthe many people she interviewed, she interviewed another survivor who told her the\nvery same story. And I don\u2019t know him, he doesn\u2019t know me. But the story basically\nis this. I remember that those people change our names. And so my name was\nchanged from Lakritz to LaCroix. LaCroix means the cross. It\u2019s a very French\nname. And one day they told me, and the other children too, we\u2019re going to have\nApril 3, 2008\nthese people visiting and they\u2019re going to ask you some questions, and when they\ndo, when they ask for your name, make sure, don\u2019t forget, give them your new name\nof LaCroix. So now I am eight years old, I have a new name and now there are\npeople coming to interrogate us. And so sure enough these people came. I remember\na woman, very well dressed, and some other man, but I remember the woman, she\ntalked to me. And I told this story to the French historian, among many stories that I\ntold her -- not many, but anyway -- and she reported that story in her book, right.\nAnd she gives credit to someone else telling her the same story, some guy who now\nlives in -- in San Diego, and who also had the same kind of -- the same people.\nWell, these people were Quakers, and this was an organization of Quaker, where\nthey tried to save some of the children from France and to ship them to England or\nAmerica, and I remember that afterwards, you understand, we understood that these\npeople were there to try to save us an-and ship us by -- by ship, but that became too\ndangerous and we could not leave. But I also remember that by that time I was a bed\nwetter and boys, other boys were making fun of me and they were trying to get me\nto stop and -- and the way they hope was they wouldn\u2019t allow me to change my bed,\nand so every night I had to sleep in a bed that was full of, to put it in plain\nvernacular, piss, right. Smelled like hell. A-And that was my punishment, my sort of\n-- they\u2019re trying to teach me not to do it. Now, I\u2019m sure e-everybody that has any\nApril 3, 2008\neducation about children understand what I didn\u2019t know, is that I was so\ntraumatized, I was so terrorized, I was in such pain, right, that that\u2019s how it is. And\nobviously no child should be treated this way. But of course it was not their doing,\nobviously they were saving us, protecting us, hoping that we could survive and --\nand continue our people. To that extent, they succeeded. These were heroes. I owe\nthem everything. Even though later I gave some of that to the nuns who sheltered me\nalso, Catholic nuns, I give credit and my life wouldn\u2019t be what it is or could have\nbeen if it wasn\u2019t for my parents, and if 1t wasn\u2019t for them and if it wasn\u2019t for\nChristians that [indecipherable] follow my story. Numerous human beings who\nbehaved at the risk of their lives and their liberties. And this is no speech, this 1s a\nfact. Anyway, from the Creuse, from that -- we went to another place and when I\nsaw a few years ago a movie called, \u201cThe Children of Chabanne\u2019, | said, I\nremember that place. I was there. I was one of the children that was sheltered in that\nchateau of the French journalist and these two, also all Christian teachers who\nsheltered Jewish children, orphan children, who had to fight off, you know, th-the --\nthe police who wanted or were curious, who -- wh-what are you doing with these\nchildren? What did -- where\u2019d they come from? And of course if they were Jewish\nchildren they were to be arrested and turned over to the French police who would\nApril 3, 2008\nthen turn them over to the -- to the Nazi. And I remember one night we were told\nthat we had to leave. This --",
        "Q: Now up to that point, did you have any correspondence with your parents?",
        "A: All right, let me just tell you this. This photo that I have of my brother and I with\nberet and wooden shoes, I believe was taken while I was at Chabanne. I know I was\n-- | had a problem with the dentist, I had pain and so I was taken to a dentist. I know\nthis photograph was taken. This photograph was mailed to my mother, right.",
        "Q: Yeah, but did you get any letters from your parents while you --",
        "A: No, not that I\u2019m aware of, none.",
        "Q: Y-You never -- you never heard anything --",
        "A: None, no, I never -- I --",
        "Q: -- once you went away?",
        "A: -- I never heard anything, but my mother did hear.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And she -- this picture of this little boy was shipped to her. This picture of both\nof her boys --",
        "Q: Yeah, this is an audio tape, so it\u2019s --",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, but I -- I understand, but I mean, I have it.",
        "Q: Yeah.\nApril 3, 2008",
        "A: I intend to leave this --",
        "Q: You have pictures.",
        "A: -- I intend to leave this particular book that I created --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- so far, all right, in the documents of this museum.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And she got these photographs. And so there were one, two, three, four\nphotographs that were mailed to her by this Jewish organization --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: -- I believe it\u2019s OSE, of the different camps where we were hidden --",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: -- from place to place. They weren\u2019t camps, they were homes.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Okay, and they were -- so one place was the Chabanne, and I absolutely believe\nthat, and these other places were again in the Creuse and then later were in the\n[indecipherable] and then we shipped then to the Pyrenees. So from the Switz --\nthe border with Switzerland there -- they -- they sent us there in an attempt to get --\nto smuggle us into Switzerland and that didn\u2019t work. And then they shipped us\ndown to Lourdes where thousands and thousands of French war orphans were there,\nApril 3, 2008\nand that\u2019s located near the border with Spain and so they sent us there for sure, to\nput us among this great mass of orphan children that we would be saved in that\nprocess. So --",
        "Q: Now how of -- y-you obviously went by train all -- to all these places?",
        "A: Yeah. So the time -- I left off a moment ago was, we\u2019re in Chabanne okay, it\u2019s a\nnight and they suddenly now get the notion they have to evacuate the children, and\nthat\u2019s part of the movie, you understand. Well finally they goi -- the police is going\nto arrest everybody and we are smuggled out, right, into -- I go to a train and God\nknows where ts --",
        "Q: With your brother. You were --",
        "A: With my brother, oh --",
        "Q: You were always with your brother.",
        "A: -- hysterical with my brother.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Yeah, okay. And we go to another place, right, again with Jewish children. And\namong these pictures that I have --",
        "Q: Mm-hm.\nApril 3, 2008",
        "A: -- right, are pictures of other children and it\u2019s a matter of judging from picture to\npicture which w -- you know, how old I am. But in one picture, my brother and I are\n-- are the youngest. In another picture we are also the group of youngest --",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: -- children there and then the oldest are older children. And again we are -- right.\nAnd we then spend two and a half years moving from place to place with other\nJewish children. Of course, 1-1-in a -- a house in -- however strange that may be, we\ndon\u2019t go to school, we don\u2019t do anything, we just play. And people are watching us,\nfeeding us, and --",
        "Q: Are you with the same group of children all the way through, or do you meet new\nchildren?",
        "A: No, I\u2019m sure that we -- we are basically with some of the same children, yeah.\nAnd -- because I absolutely remember when I look at the picture, I remember some\nof these people, and I remember them, they are in this picture, and they are in this\npicture. So, it\u2019s the same people.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Were these children also from Germany\u201d",
        "A: I-I don\u2019t know where they\u2019re from. I mean, they could be -- you know, th -- in\nFrance at that time, from what I understand of the research that\u2019s done, I mean, you\nhad refugees from all over --\nApril 3, 2008",

        "A: Yeah. Okay. Now, let me now say for the record why my parents abandoned us\ninto the arms of strangers. I have four letters, signed by my mother and father, which\nwere saved by my Great-Uncle Max in Oakland and his daughter gave them to me\nwhen she learned that I was collecting whatever I could collect about my history, my\nfamily, my -- now these four letters are written by my father. Two of them I think\nwritten to the director of the camp, and one of them is dated August 30, 1942, it\u2019s\nwritten in German.\nApril 3, 2008",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: So I don\u2019t know every word, or everything he said, okay. These, among other\ndocuments, and I have many of them, will have to be translated. I have not had them\ntranslated, but they basically describe, in this letter to Mr. Kohn about us, my\nbrother and I, about my uncle in Oakland. My father sends this camp director 50\nfrancs for our care. Obviously he asks them to save us. I don\u2019t know if he says why,\nI don\u2019t know what he says, cause I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s all German. But I know what I\ndidn\u2019t know, and I know now what I didn\u2019t know 10 years ago. And what I know is\nthe following; that the French government on orders of Vichy had established under\nFrench law, certain conditions for arrest of Jews.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: With a preference of arrest of refugee Jews. And they made various choices,\nsome totally idiotic, you know, doesn\u2019t make any sense, but -- so some people were\nallowed to keep children, and others were -- the children were to be arrested with\ntheir parents and sent to this camp in Casanuri. Casanuri was in the department of\nLot-et-Garonne. And shortly after my father and mother sent these letters to the\ncamp director and to my uncle, great-uncle in Oakland, they were arrested by the\nFrench police, the both of them were put in this camp at Casanuri. And among the\nidiosyncrasies of the French, one of the exceptions that they made for th-the\nApril 3, 2008\nincarcerated Jews was that if a woman was pregnant, they would release the couple.\nSo my mother, in her usual good sense and courage, told them she was pregnant. So\nshe was examined by the doctor and the nurses and the doctor and nurses said she\nwas pregnant. The book researched by this wonderful Christian writer of the history\nof the Jews -- and I came at the tail end of her research. I came just before the\npublication. So obviously she didn't record this from my say-so. She had recorded\nall of this. Her name is Marie-Juliette Vielcazat Petitcol. Her book is, Terre de --\nd\u2019Exile, Terre d\u2019 Asile. It was pe -- published in 2006 and she -- she was telling me\nshe was finishing and the books was going to get printed. Among the many things\nthat she had discovered, well before me, was where my parents were incarcerated in\na ca -- I didn\u2019t know where they were. And when I told her I don\u2019t know where they\nwere, she said, but I know. And I said, this is what I know happened in the camp,\ncause my mother told me. You know, she feigned to be pregnant and that th-the\ndoctor of the camp and the nurse said the -- they confirmed that, even though she\nwasn\u2019t. And as a result, my parents were allowed out of the camp. I\u2019m going to tell\nyou a historical fact, that if we had been with my parents in Casanuri at the time\nthey were arrested, we would all be dead, because the French categorization of who\nis going to be shipped in to Drancy and then to -- to Auschwitz, at the time, in\n1942, and then th-the enormous amount of Jews who were, and were shipped, th-\nApril 3, 2008\nthey were all wiped out. They were all killed in the concentration camp. The only\nthing that saved us was these two events. The fact that my parents, right, decided\nthat we should not come home, and that strangers had a better chance to save us than\nthey did, cause they were helpless. And then comes this other story, that my mother,\nyou know, tells this story to the doctor, and the doctor says, yes, you are pregnant,\nconfirmed that. And this fine human being with these fine nurses -- they are named\nin here, in this book. And you know, if I said it privately to you before the start, or I\nsaid it otherwise, I think I have come to a time where almost every important event\nin the history of the persecution of my family, and I\u2019m talking about my immediate\nfamily, that I have gotten the evidence. And you will hear, as we go along that that\nhistory goes to today. That there is a memorial now in Kiel, Germany, where there\nwas no memorial, only because of me. Because when I visited Germany, I asked\nthem, you know, I -- the only memorial that you have that remains, of the presence,\nand the persecution of Jews in Kiel is a little marker on the side of the curb of the\nstreet where the synagogue was burned, the main synagogue of Kiel. Other than that\nthey had no memorial to the Jews or to the -- to the concentration camp, or to the --\nthe whole Holocaust, nothing. So when I went there, I asked them, I will pay for it. I\nwill pay, you know, if you make a memorial. And what that memorial should consist\nof -- I understood the environment -- I said, it is a plaque like you did for the\nApril 3, 2008\nTemple, except with the plaque, plant a living tree. And I want you to know that the\ngovernor of the state wrote to me in 2005 -- I went there in 2000 -- and they have\nsuch a memorial and a living tree. And two of my cousins were invited to come to\nthe inauguration, and the one who 1s the vice president of the Weizmann Institute,\nthe son of the Eichmann survivor, is the one who spoke, right. And again, in the --\nin the -- in the stories that were published, again it\u2019s of my family, right, and all of it\ntracing to the -- my grandfather and th-the -- the photos of the ceremony, of the\nmonument on the back of -- of the -- one of the buildings, the synagogue of my\ngrandfather, and here 1s also in one of the other newspapers, several of them, you\nknow, were sent to me, is this Christian couple. And this Christian couple is the\nreasons we were invited to Kiel. They are the ones who sa -- researched the\ndocuments for me in Kiel, other than what I obtained on my own. They are another\nevidence of the -- th-the -- the goodness and -- and the fact that people do care, and\nthey care immensely, because they -- they suggested to the city that they should\nhonor those Jews who survived and who were born in the city of Kiel. So they\ninvited my surviving cousins --\nEnd of Tape Three, Side A\nBeginning Tape Three, Side B\nApril 3, 2008",
        "Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\nvolunteer collection interview with Alfred Lakritz. This is tape number three, side\nB. When you were ch -- those two and a ha -- two years, two and a half years you\nwere with your brother, alone with him, did you talk about your parents a lot? You\nsaid you had no communication in the beginning even, from your parents.",
        "A: Okay, there are many things I remember about that period. It\u2019s difficult for me to\nrecall any particular conversation I had with my brother. It 1s not difficult for me to\nrecall a number of events that I remember very specifically. The one thing I\nexpressed earlier, and I say it again because it helps to explain; I had an obsession\nand fear, absolute fear, that I would be separated from my brother and he from me. I\nmean, this was an absolute fear. And obviously that fear is clearly tempered and\nexplained by the fact that we were suddenly separated from our parents, right,\nwithout any comprehension or explanation by anybody. So now what happens in\nthis episode to my brother and I for two and a half years 1s that we are in the\ncompany of other Jewish children, so they are contemporaries. Some are older, right,\nmany years older, cause we\u2019re very little, and some of them are about our age, and\nwe play and -- and -- and do things like little children. One of the frightful memories\nthat I remember is my wife and I went for two weeks to a place in -- in the south -- I\nmean in the west -- I mean the east part of France call -- a city called Anisy. We\nApril 3, 2008\nwent there to attend a French school provided to foreigners and we thought that\nwould be really fun for her and I to go to French school, and she would learn a little\nFrench. In the meantime we have two weeks of vacation. And during that two week\nperiod, one day -- I mean, every weekend I would take her and we would go around.\nAnd one of the points that I tried to find, I tried to find where I loo -- I was hidden in\nthe upper plateau of a big city called Evian, on the lake -- on the shore of the lake\nGeneva. And so one of them was this big house in -- in -- which is in one of the\npictures, and I wanted to find this place. Now anyway, so one of those weekends we\nwent someplace else, and this very nice woman w -- we had to find lodging, we had\nno reservation, so she offered us a room in -- in her big house, whatever it was, a\nhostel and so on. And some story about that her son -- I was looking to locate this\nplace and that her son might know something, you understand, that he was cognizant\nof the history and th -- and th-the -- during the wartime and the resistance that\noccurred there and the -- the Jews. And so we went to her place, and she showed us\nthe room, and it was terrible. Anyway, so we didn\u2019t want to stay there. But as we\nwalked out, there was a queue -- a line of little children going to dinner, I guess, or\ncoming from dinner, I don\u2019t remember exactly, my wife will remember. And I was\nabsolutely thrown back to that time when this reminded me about me, about me and\nthe other children, that this is how we were, we went on line, everything, everything\nApril 3, 2008\nwe did was in part of the others and that we had little pajamas in this little house and\nI guess they were going to bed. I guess that\u2019s where they were. And I -- it was one of\nthose moments where you\u2019re taken back to this memory. Anyway, these were times\nwhere we had the company of other children. Other children who were in the same\nboat as we were, and we knew we were in danger. We knew that we weren\u2019t allowed\nto go out and play, we were not allowed to do anything in the exterior, everything\nwas done in the interior. In the Ault Sevoir we did something on the exterior, there\nyes. We went on hikes like in this one picture. I remember going 1n forests, I loved\nhiking, I loved forests, I loved nature. I remember those things. Then they sent us to\nLourdes. Lourdes is, of course, the home of the historic religious event of\nBernadette and there at first we were all together, placed in the pensionne and next\nto this pensionne were lodged these German Luftwaffe pilots. And we knew they\nwere our enemy. And so I remember one day we had a snowball fight with these\npilots. And I remember putting rocks, and the other boys did too, rocks 1n the middle\nof our snowball and sending them, you know. We knew these were --",

In the town of Lourdes the Germans were in total\ncontrol of the town, okay. You couldn't walk, you understand, they had barriers,\nbarbed wire with guards, you know, everywhere.

I don\u2019t know how\nwe coped. I don\u2019t have any idea really, to understand, you know. The only thing that\nallowed us to survive 1s the fact that there were other children around who were in\nsimilar circumstances --",
        "Q: Similar circumstances --",
        "A: -- as us. And -- and so in that sense, you know, the will to survive is very strong,\nobviously in everybody.

        "Q: Right.",

        "Q: Yeah, but the adult --",
        "A: In the main, the children remained. In the main.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And -- but some of the older children also remained, and -- and some of them, I\nmean I -- I see their faces --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: -- in these photographs, okay. But some of the others absolutely did not stay with\nus, or we with them. What happened to them I -- I have absolutely no knowledge.",
        "Q: Right. Well, now you\u2019re in Lourdes.",
        "A: Now I\u2019m in Lourdes. So I know that first we were in this ma -- in this\npensionne, right next to the Luftwaffe office. So then we are moved into a hotel.\nThe hotel is built around th -- tourism, and all their hotels everywhere. By the\nhundreds of thousands they have rooms, you know. Th-They all cater to the -- to the\nCatholic --",
        "Q: Right.\nApril 3, 2008",
        "A: -- you know, who come to pray for cures.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: The Pope, John Paul the second, he went there for a cure. And so have there --\nby -- for over 150 years have they gone there, for sure. Now after, in the hotel -- up\nto then we\u2019re together, and then they move my brother. So now I -- I\n[indecipherable] okay, I cry, I scream, I -- God knows what I did. Anyway, but they\nassure me that I will see him and I will be with him and that I shouldn\u2019t worry, that\nhe is going to be fine and I\u2019m going to be fine, but they have to separate us. And I\nam certain that they separated us because there was a danger, because our French\nmaybe wasn\u2019t perfect, and he was younger, and he was innocent and he could speak\nup and give his real name and identity and then be discovered, then we both die. So I\nthink they separated us there. In other place before that we were all with Jewish\nchildren, so it didn\u2019t matter. But there it matter, because we were hidden with all of\nthese orphan Christian children, by the thousands, you understand. And I\u2019m sure that\nit was an act of preservation, to protect us. So they put him in this place and they put\nme in the convent, and I was in the convent on the grounds of the Basilica of\nLourdes. The [indecipherable] magnifique and I was, I believe, the only child that\nwas hid -- Jewish child hidden by these nuns on that -- in that convent. Now, it\u2019s\nreally not a convent. What it really is, is a hospice. And it is the place where this\nApril 3, 2008\norder of nun take care of the medically invalid visitors to the city of Lourdes and\nthey come there and these nuns are nurses and they nurse these people during their\nstay, right, which is provided for free, I\u2019m sure. And now comes the war, there\u2019s no\ntravel, right, nobody can move, and now they have nothing to do and these children\nare being brought in, you know, by the government. Rounded up from France and --\nand brought into the city cause it\u2019s -- they\u2019ve got the road, they got the hotels\nunoccupied. The state takes over all of those hotels, and they offered, obviously, to\nshelter some children. Incidentally, I want to go back to tell you one part of the\nstory. Among -- and I haven\u2019t -- I haven\u2019t come to the further development of what\nhappened to my mother and father, but one thing has to be said, is that my parents\nwere totally, completely trapped. They had no means, no right, no power to move.\nThey had no papers, and police, French police would stop people, you know, for\nidentification and you know, identity card, you know, with photograph. I mean,\nthere\u2019s no way you could move. So my mother one time told me about that they had\nto go somewhere, all right, even at the risk of their lives, but 1t was that important.\nWhat it was, I don\u2019t know. And so she described to me the -- the -- the -- the episode\nfor my father and I. They would walk at night on the road and if they saw two lights,\nthey knew they were policemens with their bicycle lights, and so they would jump\ninto the --\nApril 3, 2008",
        "Q: Ditch? A ditch?",
        "A: -- the ditch next to the road to hide. And that\u2019s how they travel, right, to wherever\nthey were going, I don\u2019t know where, but anyway, the point that I\u2019m making is that\nwhen they were shipped from Marmande, they were not allowed to live there any\nmore, and we were in this little hamlet. I said earlier that in my understanding of it,\nthey were put there for easy picking, all right, by the French police. And the whole\nsystem was geared around keeping them there, locked in, with no escape and no\nmeans of escape. So now you can understand this couple, right. Now they say, oh\nmy God, we have sent our children away and they\u2019re going to come arrest us. Now,\nokay, then comes the second judgment, well better they stay there in the protection\nof this organization then, cause we are trapped. We cannot escape, right. So they are\nlike animals in the cage and the French are inhospitable. The police 1s absolutely\ntheir enemy, right, and hunt -- their hunter, right, and they know it. They\u2019re going to\nbe arrested at the whim of -- of the police. They have no power whatsoever. So the\ntotal abandonment, you know, of these people, the total fact that they\u2019re totally left\nwith no escape --",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: -- right, explains how bad things were to them. Okay, now back to my -- I\u2019m in\nLourdes, I\u2019m in this convent. I\u2019m the only child there and I have experiences there\nApril 3, 2008\nthat are very life long. I remember on the ground of the basilica by myself, I would\ngo and visit the grotto. I was alone and I remember praying there. What I prayed for\nwas for my parents. So the question you asked me about my parents, there I know. I\nknow what I prayed for. That\u2019s what I prayed for. And so I never lost hope. I never\ngive up, no. There I went to pray, and not once, but quite a few times. And today\nwhen I revisited Lourdes in the year 2000, of course there are hundreds, thousands\nof people with candles an-and the whole paraphernalia. But here\u2019s a grotto, I was the\nonly occupant. It was just me.",
        "Q: So you were there -- you said you were the only child sheltered there.",

And I remember one day walking with him, the grounds\nof this long basilica, this long walkway, and I told him that I resented that I had to\ngo to -- to church every Sunday morning and that I was not allowed to kneel.",
        "Q: Did he know you were Jewish?",
        "A: Oh yeah, oh. No question. And he said to me in retort, and I remember it, never,\nnever, never will forget. He was the nicest guy, he really loved me. And he says,\nwell at least I don\u2019t make you go to catechism. So now, the way he said it, catechism\nwas absolutely something terrible.

I was treated like one of the children, you\nknow, we did whatever the hell we did. I remember that we went on hikes all the\ntime, singing songs, you know, I remember that.",
        "Q: What was the contact with your brother?",
        "A: Okay. With my brother, I had contact with him from time to time. And one day\nthe liberation, and I was -- before the liberation came, and some woman -- the\nFrench had organized some kind of system to ask local habitants of Lourdes to\nprovide a home for these orphan children, you know, to give them a little bit of a\nfamily, a little bit of that type of experience. So a woman volunteered to have me,\nyou know, that she would be -- okay, she was unmarried, that I would be her, you\nknow, like big brother, so to speak, you know, that idea. And she turned out to be a\nApril 3, 2008\nwonderful Jewish woman. By some choice of the Almighty, maybe, it turned out she\nwas a Jewish French woman, and I was to be her little boy. So she treated me,\nobviously with tremendous love.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Okay. And I said that -- that I would not continue to come unless my brother\ncame.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: And she didn\u2019t want to, but she agreed. And so then we spent time with her. And\nI remember when I was leaving her, and she was talking to another woman in my\npresence, and the other woman was complaining to her that here she had cared for\nthis child, a child, and that child had never written to her. And so this woman who\ncared for me, she said, I bet you will do the same. Oh no, no, no, I promise, I\npromise, I won\u2019t forget you. I will write to you. But I didn\u2019t. I never did. And that\u2019s\none of my many regrets, you know. This was a wonderful, wonderful woman.",
        "Q: What was her name?",
        "A: Ah, God knows, I don\u2019t, you know. But again, you know, maybe children are\nmore blessed and maybe they are protected and -- and babies and little children, of\ncourse, are loved by everybody. But I had all these privileges, you know, in different\ntime, and I have to say, you know, throughout my story, it\u2019s a human story.\nApril 3, 2008",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: It\u2019s a human story of survival of children who, not by their own doings are able\nto physically survive, but by their own doing emotionally, psychologically survive.\nAnd what 1s the price? What is the price of people who didn\u2019t do it? Who saw it,\nwho remained passive.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Or -- actively or inactively. And this story of survival, right, has to record all of\nthese people\u2019s attitude, cause nothing happened here in a vacuum.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Nothing happened in isolation, nothing happened by itself. There was always\ncause and effect, right. And -- so here 1s this magnificent woman.

Certainly not as\nmuch as I\u2019m doing here, but some, she records what happened in -- in Lot-et-\nGaronne, right, the apartment. And she, in chapter 12 for example, speaks of the\norganization, the Jewish organization that were in [indecipherable], that -- who did,\nyou know, the different work, okay. Now, chapter 12 deals with it, chapter 13 deals\nwith it and there are several organizations, many of them funded by American Jews.",

        "Q: But my point is you never heard while you were --\nApril 3, 2008",
        "A: Exactly the -- which organization, I don\u2019t, but I have to make a point here, that\ndeals with what happened to us. How 1s it that American Jews knew and contributed\nmoney to these organization in 1942 to save Jews, and that the rest of America\nclaimed to have no knowledge of what was happening? No, I mean, th-th-this 1s\nmonstrous. I mean, I was saved by American money with -- with French Jewish\nlives who were willing to do it. This was in \u00b042 - \u00b043 - \u00b044.",

We are then placed, Herb and I, in a Catholic family in\nthe town of Tarbes, T-a-r-b-e-s, which is close to Lourdes.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.\nApril 3, 2008",
        "A: And they become our foster parents, so to speak, right, for a time. My brother\nrecalls that they were mean to me, but they were nice to him. And in that sense,\nobviously, the effect of all this longing for my parents, the abandonment, or the\nseparation from my parents, obviously in me created a difference of personality for\nme and my brother.\nEnd of Tape Three, Side B\nApril 3, 2008\nBeginning Tape Four, Side A",

        "A: Tarbes, right. In Tarbes, my brother and I are ne -- housed with this family of fa\n-- French Christians. I know this is not a pleasant time for me, and my brother, he\nremembers very well that they didn\u2019t treat me very well, but they treated him okay.\nOne day I remember an event I can never forget. This woman from a Jewish agency\ncomes to visit and she has me sit down with her and she looks 1n my eyes ... 1s a\nmoment I never, never, never, never, never could forget. She looks in my eyes and\nshe says, we have found your mother.",
        "Q: Mm.",
        "A: I tell you, no human being can have greater, you know, pain and -- and joy at the\nsame moment. The obvious 1-1s that obviously I had despaired for two, say two and\na half years. Obviously I had prayed and hoped, and now this hope was bringing this\nmoment and this news. Now this was in the context that other children or other\npeople had told me that they planned on shipping us to Palestine. That they were\ngoing to ship us to Palestine, which meant, obviously, that they all assumed that we\nwere orphans and that our parents had been killed. And I knew that. And now this\n100April 3, 2008\nwoman brought this news. This was the first word I had on my parents for two and a\nhalf years, almost. And I tell you, I told the story to these two French journalists, and\nI know one of them published it in his newspaper as the lead, you know, in his\narticle and they reported when I came to thank the Italian farmers, I didn\u2019t talk about\nyet, about my mother, what happened to my mother. Well, they had hidden her for\nth -- a lot of that two and a half year period. And I went to publicly thank this family\nthat I visited many, many, many times. I consider myself a part of their family, they\nconsider me and my brother part of their family, certainly. They consider my mother\npart of their family. Anyway, I told these newsmen this, and -- and newspaper men\nand they considered that to be what I consider it, th -- not fully appreciating the\ncontent. Anyway, so shortly after that, by this Jewish organization we were taken\nand reunited with my mother. And I remember my mother there on the same\nplatform of the same railroad station, standing just about exactly the same spot that I\nlast saw her, say two and a half years before, with her close friend that she\ndeveloped, this Madame Rozinsky, and her son, who became my close friend. And\nthey were Jews of -- from Alsace-Lorraine and they were spared. They were spared\nin the town of ma -- Marmande, and two doors down was another Jewish family by\nthe name of Alco, all of these were our friends after the war, and they were spared\nbecause they were French born. So in France that\u2019s another thing that happened.\n101April 3, 2008\nThere was a very, very, very, you know, factual difference of who survived and who\nwas not allowed to survive. And we, the refugees Jews in France were the ones that\nwere handed for slaughter. Knowingly, obligingly by the French. And the other one,\nthey spared.",
        "Q: Tell me what it was like when you saw your mother.",
        "A: Well, it was a shock, because she had gained weight and I was conscious of that,\nbut it was my mother, and that I recognized, and there was no problem from that\nmoment. That\u2019s it, I will tell you.",
        "Q: Do you remember what she said to you, right away?",
        "A: No, I\u2019m sure she cried. I\u2019m sure I cried.",

        "Q: He was too little when he left, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, he was too little. And he had no memory of his father either.",
        "Q: Right.\n102April 3, 2008",
        "A: You know. I had two years on him, and I have very, very strong, you know, very,\nvery strong memories of my parents, you know. And so I don\u2019t think we needed to\nsay any words.",
        "Q: Right. And then where --",
        "A: Now -- I don\u2019t think there were any words.",
        "Q: Words.",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: And then where did you go with her?",
        "A: Well, she had gotten this apartment. She was allocated by the city, right, through\nthe Secretaire Generale, the -- th-the administrative chief of the city hall, who\nadministered that apartment that I referred to --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- where my father had performed the -- the high holiday services, and we stayed\nthere. And I remember being in that apartment when the liberation of Paris came,\nand I remember making little flags of America and so for -- and Britain and -- and\nFrance, you know, and I hung them on the window, and I remember that. You\nknow, we, as opposed to children today who have everything handed to them and\nmade for them, right, they have to use their talents in different ways. I was a creator.\n103April 3, 2008\nI created my own toys, right, and the flag was my la -- you know, and so yes,\nFrance was there in a very happy state at that moment.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And so was I. And so after we stayed there a -- you know a short time, you know,\nin that apartment, then we were given the apartment I said on the Boulevard de\nMarie, opposite the warehouse and there we lived. And my brother and I went to\nschool, and he became a closest friend to a boy named Saresh Guyaux, whose\nfather was Gerard Guyaux, that man -- they lived just down the street, the side\nstreet. And he helped us to survive, you know. And my mother\u2019s story is an\nimportant story. She was left with my father and they struggled, right, until --\ntogether after they were released from the camp at Casanuri. Then they lived in that\nsame mud chicken coop, as my wife calls it. And one day the police came, as\nexpected, and they arrested my father. And his arrest is also recorded in the books\nthat I have. I mean, I have every evidence of why he was arrested on the orders of\nEichmann, for the -- as ar -- act of ret -- retribution against the killing of two\nGerman officer in Paris. And Eichmann declared that there should be a punishment\nfor this, 2000 Jews were to be arrested throughout France and turned over to them\nat Drancy, and the French complied. My father was one of those who was arrested\nand he was put in the camp of Gurs, G-u-r-s, and for transportation to Drancy, and\n104April 3, 2008\nfrom Drancy at fra -- Drancy on the night that he was being shipped out to go to his\ndestiny, he didn\u2019t know where, but anyway went from Auschwitz to Majdanek, and\nhe was allowed one goodbye, farewell postcard, that he mailed to my mother. And\nthis I have, and it\u2019s dated March the third, 1943, and instead -- instead of saying au\nrevoir, or instead of saying something else, he misspelled but says the word, adieu\nwith an exclamation mark, underscored twice, in big letters. He knew he was headed\nfor death. And he said that we should have bon courage, you know, strength to deal\nwith it, and he sent us his love.",

        "Q: Right, right.",
        "A: -- the information. I have the original. I have an original copy or I have the\noriginal affidavit of my grandfather, right. These are original documents, yes.",
        "Q: Tell me about your mother\u2019s story.",
        "A: Her story is -- and I will tell you now, because a story -- history should know not\njust what she endured, but how I look at how she endured. I consider her about as\ngreat a woman, a mother as there can be, in fact, I call her an angel. After my\nfather\u2019s arrest in February, at the end of February, 1943, she is left alone. She has no\nidea if her children are alive or dead, except th-there are a few photographs that are\ngiven to her. And she, of course, knows nothing of what happened to her husband.\nAnd so she is left there alone, right. And she speaks the language cause she picks up\nApril 3, 2008\nthe language fast. She\u2019s a seamstress, she is known by the farming families, you\nknow, who use her. And one day she 1s asked by this Italian farmer\u2019s family, the\nRos family, R-o-s to make a wedding dress for their one -- their second oldest\ndaughter. So my mother makes this wedding dress for her, and she did, I guess, a\nreasonably good job. Then they ask her to make the suit for the groom. So she\nmakes that. And from then on they are totally connected, and they become her\nprotectors. So, they take her away, she is all alone, right, obviously a woman in\ntremendous pain and they give her a family and a home and a place. So this is two\npeople who had immigrated from Italy when things were bad in northern Italy in\nthe early 30\u2019s. And they became tenant farmers in -- in the southwest of France at a\nchateau called LeCook, and -- by a woman who was Madame deFerrier, a noble\nlady of -- not noble in act, of course she was noble in act, but her name was of the\nnobility. And the tenant farmers that they have 1s this family, Ros. And this couple,\nthe Ros\u2019 are two magnificent -- magnificent human beings. They are farmers with a\nlittle education. They have six or seven children, right now I\u2019m not counting them,\nand they have this farm. And so they take her in and from time to time, you know,\none of their son, you know transports my mother by bicycle to their farm, which is\nup on this hill, at the mas dejeuner. And she is all alone so they adopt her and they\nhide her. Their oldest son is ordered into Germany as part of the -- the -- the -- the\n107April 3, 2008\nGerman orders, it takes one child from certain families, you know, to -- as laborers\nin Germany, and he is one of them, and he\u2019s not there. So I guess in the sense they\nconsoled themselves because they have some connect in that sense. Anyway, she\nspends a lot of time there, and they even hide her. One time I was taken through\nwhen I returned. When I was a child growing up there I wasn\u2019t interested in any of\nthis, but when I returned with my wife and -- and children to LeCook, LeCook had\nbeen sold to a German couple, but they were -- they allowed us to come and visit\nthat site. And I was then taken through the chateau, as I had been as a child, we used\nto play there all the time after the war. But I was shown a room in this chateau that\nhad a secret wall, and my mother was hidden in that wall. So when police came to\nLeCook to check what\u2019s what, and so forth, so forth, they would hide her in this\nwall, you know, which was a fake wall. So, in my family so many things happened\nthat happened to other Jews in other places and so on, even that happened. Anyway,\nthese wonderful people kept her, nourished her, gave her support, moral and\nphysical in that sense and helped her over this period. A photograph that I have of\nmy mother shows her extreme pain. And she is in one picture shown, that\u2019s all I\nhave, when she is with her sewing machine [indecipherable]. Then the next picture\nI have of her is two and a half years later when we\u2019re reunited with her. And she\ntakes us with joy and pride, you know, to visit this family, to bring her sons. And the\nApril 3, 2008\npain in her eyes 1s so clear and her pride is so clear. And I have two photographs,\nyou know, of that particular event, where she even made the clothes that we wear.\nAnd she is bringing her boys. And this family that I went and thanked and -- and so\nforth, called just two or three weeks ago. We haven\u2019t heard from you, where are\nyou, what\u2019s happening? Why aren\u2019t you here, you know? And -- a-a-anyway --",
        "Q: So you stayed --",
        "A: These people, we would go during -- we, of course immediately applied to\nemigrate to the United States with the help of my uncle --",
        "Q: Yeah. Mm-hm.",
        "A: -- now, not -- not my great-uncle, but my uncle.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Right. And as fate has tha -- an-and justice not, we -- presumably one of the\nreasons that the United States of America went to war against Hitler was about the\nhorror that he was committing against the Jews. We, who already had been given\nentry into th -- America in 1935 --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- when my mother applied, that was an unrecalled event. We were then placed in\nthe quota, the most extreme quota that United States immigrant quotas had\nestablished. And that was in 1945 --\n109April 3, 2008",

        "A: We -- we stayed in Marmande until we emigrated to United States in 1950.",
        "Q: Oh, oh, okay.",
        "A: So for those five years we lived in Marmande. Well, my mother applied\nimmediately for -- a-after the war was over, she applied immediately for pro -- visa,\nwith the -- of course with the sponsorship of my uncle, and we were placed in the\nquota of Poland, which was then behind the Iron Curtain --",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: -- that they had raised, and now instead of being in the favored status, we were in\nthe most un-favored status and we had to wait five years to a -- be allowed to\nemigrate to the United States. Now, on the ship that we took to emigrate, were\nGermans. Germans who had applied for the right to live in the United States six\nmonths ago. And I, the victim of the Holocaust, the horror for which this country\nsupposedly went to war, I had to wait five years. Now that same crime was repeated\nover and over since that time, to now. People are allowed on fantasy, and made up\nand so forth, so forth, I\u2019m being persecuted, I am -- so therefore all the Iranians, the\nCubans, the Vietnamese, the -- anybody anywhere in the world is allowed to enter\n110April 3, 2008\nthe United States on the say-so, violating their tourist visa, you understand, and so\nforth. We, who were the absolute victims of the war, right, from whom everything\nwas taken, the property, the inheritance, the families, the rights, our father,\neverything. We were treated in the most, right, abject, the most reyected. We had to\nwait five years for the privilege and the right to emigrate to this country, right, this\ncountry to whom we had been sponsored, and this country had already, right,\ngranted us entry in 1935. That promise was broken. Now, I love this country and I\ncondemn this country. You know, I have one understanding, you know, in the recent\npolitical thing that\u2019s going on and they\u2019re condemning this Reverend Wright, right?\nAnd I do, I condemn him too, for what he said. I don\u2019t think he has a right to say\nwhat he said. On the other hand, there is a level of understanding on my part. And\nthat is, when a person, right, is part of an environment where this country denies to\none group the rights and privileges guaranteed under the Constitution and the law,\nand it denies them indirectly or otherwise, by use of the law, then somebody has a\nright to be angry. I am angry. I truly resent the fact that Mexican and others from\nLatin America daily, you know, cross our borders without any permission, any\npermits, anything. I had to go through every demands. We had to prove we were\nhonest, healthy, able people, that we would be able to survive in this country without\ncharity. We had to swear at the point of entry in New York -- I remember my\nApril 3, 2008\nmother had to sign an affidavit she didn\u2019t come here to kill the president. I thought\nthen, I\u2019m 16 years old, this is a joke. How can that be a demand, you know, on\nsomebody who\u2019s entering here? Yet it was. So, as wonderful as this place 1s, 1t was\nthe promised land to me from the time I was one years old, that\u2019s where I wanted to\ngo. Germany was no longer my home, I had no home. France was not my home, I\nnever accepted it, right. I knew I didn\u2019t fit there. I didn\u2019t belong there. They hadn\u2019t\noffered, they hadn\u2019t extended, you know. Yeah, they were tolerating us, and they\ndidn\u2019t persecute us and they didn\u2019t harm us, other than what they did, right. But this\nwasn\u2019t my home, and it wasn\u2019t my mother\u2019s home. My brother wanted to be -- h-he\nwanted it to be his home, cause he had grown up there. He didn\u2019t know anything\nelse.

And\nthey told me that what they did 1s, they knew that he had been killed, or at least they\npremised that it was, so they distributed among them, the Catholic habits, as an\nomen of good, and so this prayer book was torn by them, right, and only certain\npieces remained, and they gave them to me.

        "A: Okay, I wanted -- I wanted to say one thing --\n117April 3, 2008",
        "Q: Yeah?",
        "A: -- before I do, because I don\u2019t know how much time we\u2019re going to spend, that\nI\u2019m available. But one thing I want to say is this, because it ties into the first part,\nbefore I get to what happens here. One time I went to Jerusalem, to the Yad\nVashem, again to find my roots. And this was 20 years ago, I think. It was -- well, it\nwas on the anniversary of the state of Israel, so thi -- I know that. And I -- I think it\nwas 20 years ago, but anyway -- and I went to the Yad Vashem to ask -- you know,\nto apply for -- I-I wanted to connect to my family, to my roots. And so I filled out a\ncard and I went to hand it to the man at the counter, and the man looked at it and he\nsaid to me, the information for you isn\u2019t here. So I looked. He says, I have the\ninformation that you need. So I said, yeah? He says, I\u2019m going to bring it to you. In\na little while he came back with these two gigantic books, and he says, there 1s what\nhappened to your family. I didn\u2019t know what it was. I open the book and it\u2019s called\nGedanta volume one and two, the collection of the Jews of West Germany killed\nby the Nazis as reported and recorded by the Nazi -- I mean, post-war by -- and in\nthis book I looked under Lakritz and I don\u2019t find my father. So I decided to go\nunder Weber, and I will tell you, 1f you would have exploded an atomic bomb, I\ndon\u2019t think I would have been more shocked, more surprised, more in a state of total\nemotional disconnect and connect, ya -- total. I opened the book, I go to Weber, and\n118April 3, 2008\nthe first thing I read is the name of Mirel Weber, geb Lakritz, from Kiel. That\u2019s\nmy grandmother. So I run down, the next name I find is Simon, initial S, Lakritz\nWeber. And they put his place of residence and where he died, Majdanek, Lublin,\nsometime in 43. How in the world they restored to him his name of Weber as a\nmemorial to him is -- I -- I totally without any comprehension. How they went\nthrough the records and restored to him his name, is unbelievable. So the connection\nto my pursuit of my name, my identity, my roots, here it is confirmed in the\nGedanta book, handed to me in the Yad Vashem. And so I said -- and I looked then\nfor the other relatives, the Weizmanns, and they\u2019re all recorded, anyway, everybody\nin the Weizner is in, they are recorded. Aunts and uncles and cousins whose deaths\nare recorded. Anyway, so now let me come to what happens in United States of\nAmerica.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: We come to Oakland, right, and we stayed with my Uncle M-Mike and my\nAunt Eda and her -- her three children. They\u2019re my cousins, these are my uncle and\naunt. We are welcomed in New York by an -- a niece, a cousin of mine, Friedel\nKnesh.",
        "Q: What was it like to step down on American soil?",
        "A: I will tell you. Imagine for a moment that a child has a dream, that California in\n119April 3, 2008\nAmerica is the dream. I remember docking -- well, no, first I remember coming --\nentering into the port of New York.",
        "Q: What boat were you on?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. It was a port that left -- m-my mother arranged for us, before we\nleft Europe that she wanted to see Paris. She hadn\u2019t seen -- we hadn\u2019t been there,\nand she wanted to go to Rome. And so she arranged to -- from a -- through a Jewish\nagency, right, that we could have these periods. Remember, we didn\u2019t have much of\nanything, everything was taken from us. And we were not poor people in Germany,\nbut we didn\u2019t own the -- th-the -- the -- the -- the retail store, you know. We owned a\nwholesale schmutter, okay. Well, we were good anyway, not rich. And here we are\nand so she\u2019s getting help, you know, for us to immigrate to United States. So we\nleave from Naples. What was it you asked me?",
        "Q: The name of the boat. That\u2019s okay.",
        "A: Yeah, I -- I knew the name of the boat.",
        "Q: That\u2019s okay.",
        "A: Anyway, it was an ordinary commercial boat.",
        "Q: Yeah, I get it",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: And I asked you then what it was like to put your foot down on American soil.\n120April 3, 2008",
        "A: Right. So I remember docking, but before docking, we passed by the Statue of\nLiberty. And when we were in Paris, before we left, and we were sightseeing and so\nforth, we found the replica of the Statue of Liberty, you know, by the guy who --\nwho made th-the thing. So I saw it, and mm, look at that thing, huh? Yeah, it\u2019s not\nso big. Anyway, but it was nice, an-and you know, and gave you that umph, you\nknow, hope, you know. Next time I see you, I'll see your big sister. And there I was,\nI saw the big sister. You know, here was the promised land, you know. Here was my\nlife, all right. A boy who had very little given to him by France, right, and\neverything hoped for in the United States. So the Statue of Liberty was a moment I\ncried. When we docked, then we disembarked and there were people crowded\naround and whate -- and behind the fence, you know, and my mother found her\nbrother and her sister-in-law, who were there. And of course I didn\u2019t know them, but\nof course I found out right away who they were. Anyway, so after we -- we cleared\nthe -- everything else, I think I had to go to the bathroom. And so somebody, you\nunderstand, it was Friedel\u2019s husband, who was -- the husband 1s a -- was a tax1\ndriver, I remember in -- in Brooklyn. They lived in Brooklyn. My aunt and uncle\nhad come from Oakland across the United States. I know those four people were\nthere. And it must have been him, he took me to a bar to go to the toilet. And I saw a\njukebox in this -- I had never seen a jukebox. I was amazed. This thing plays music.\n121April 3, 2008\nI was totally amazed. The only thing I knew about music was the phonograph, you\nknow, so forth, you -- okay, so that was one thing. Then I saw them selling Frosties,\nyou know, that ice cream. So, he bought me one. I tasted it; 1t was so rich, so\nwonderful, so magnificent. In France the ice cream is sort of watery and -- an-and\nicy, but here was -- it\u2019s so rich. So they had a boy, wha -- we stayed with them for a\nweek, and this boy was a little fat, and we were thin. And I saw the amount of food\nthat they had, of milk and butter and cheese and -- and a [indecipherable] I said, no\nwonder he\u2019s fat.",
        "Q: Did you speak English at that point?",
        "A: Not a word. And I had done something in preparation of coming here. I had\nwritten to the embassy in Paris, right, the French embassy -- I mean the American\nembassy and I\u2019d say we\u2019re going to immigrate, you know, an-and I wanted\nsomething cause in -- in Marmande there was nothing about learning English.\nThere was no book in the library, there was nothing. I had French books, you know,\nyeah. And so they sent me a book, right, nice they were, to learn about English. So\non my own, you know, I learned a few words in the little thing, but on my own I\ncouldn\u2019t do anything, I couldn\u2019t learn anything, I ma -- it was -- so that\u2019s the\nbeginning, right, so, where -- with -- with Friedel and -- and -- and so forth, so forth.\nThat fat little boy, he\u2019s a lawyer in New Jersey. Anyway, and he\u2019s one -- and he is\n122April 3, 2008\nthe one who finally, my other relatives that were looking for me, right, for this trip\nto Germany, he\u2019s the one who connected with me and found me, you know, cause\nhe -- they knew I was a lawyer, and he\u2019s a lawyer, so he said, I -- I can find him. He\ndid that. Anyway --",
        "Q: So how long did you stay in New York?",

        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: And one of the things they had -- they shipped us, was corned beef. You know\n[indecipherable]. So I saw the word corn, so I pointed to the waiter, black guy, I\nremember, or maybe he was white, any -- whatever. And I pointed this word corn,\nokay? So I figure we\u2019 re --",

        "A: My father was a very observant Jew. I mean he -- he -- he put on the Tefillin\nevery day. They kept kosher. They kept kosher in France during the occupation\nwhen we had nothing to eat. When there was no meat, you understand and the only\navailable meat was pork, they gave it to my brother and I, but not -- they wouldn\u2019t\neat it, okay. To the extent that she could -- my mother could keep kosher, you\nunderstand, in -- in this kind of horrible, you know, living conditions, you know,\ncertainly no -- no way you can, you know, maintain dietary laws, but anyway -- but\nas soon as we came to America, she did. And so did my Uncle Mike and Eda, they\n132April 3, 2008\nwere here -- they came here in our place, I mean -- no, I did not feel a sense of either\nshame or resentment about being a Jew, right. And th-that speaks to the -- to the -- to\nthe attitude and feelings that you have. Now, was I glad to be a target and a -- and a -\n- and a victim? No. I mean, obviously that made me very angry. And when I came to\nunderstand how the process had happened to my family and to me and to so forth, so\nforth, no, I became very angry.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: But -- and then I learned more and more, even about the complicity of the United\nStates and I call 1t what it is because it 1s a complixa -- complicity in the murder of\nsix million Jews, and I say it now, forever it should be remembered that they -- the\nGermans were complicit, the French were complicit, so was America. FDR was\ncomplicit. The State Department was complicit. And not -- they didn\u2019t stop their\ncomplicity with this monstrous period of crime. They didn\u2019t even redeem it by honor\nus, you understand, to -- to allow us to immigrate the United States before the worst\nquota imposed. I can\u2019t forgive that. I can\u2019t forget that. This can never be forgotten,\nall right. And so people -- when I , you know, speak of -- of the intolerance, you\nknow, oh -- and -- and the dysfunctional treatment of -- of millions of Mexicans and\nLatin Americans, of the Cubans and -- and the Vietnamese and th -- all these\nimmigrants from everywhere, why 1s it that Jews were treated differently? And it\n133April 3, 2008\nseems -- and you can take that view, that Jews always have to be the ones who have\nto pierce whatever it is. They are in front. They are the -- the target. And maybe\nthat\u2019s it, again. We are the chosen ones.",
        "Q: Did --",
        "A: And we\u2019re not only chosen for what we would want to be chosen for, but we\nwere. And I use the word describing what the United States did, and this comes\nfrom a person who loves his country, this is my dream. This is a place where no\nhuman being, right, could have -- could have expected more than I got out of it. This\nis a country I would kiss the ground. I kissed the ground when I landed in New\nYork, I kissed the ground on the [indecipherable]. I kissed the dra -- on my knees I\nkissed it. But I also kissed the ground of Sather Gate which is the entrance port of -\n- to the University of California, Berkeley. And every time I walk under that gate\nand every time I answer -- enter the grounds of that university, I thank God, I thank\nAmerica, | thank California for having allowed me and given me this unbelievable\nprivilege that I never, never would have had in France or Germany. I and my\nbrother were allowed with nothing, not even speaking the language, but at the end of\nthree years of residence in this country, we were admitted to the University of\nCalifornia at Berkeley, the most pra -- predominant public institution in the world,\nright, and certainly predominant against an -- a-at that time against any university in\n134April 3, 2008\nthe country. We were allowed to go there and to attend and to graduate. And he\nwould have, if he wanted to, he would have gone the di -- post-graduate school, as I\ndid. I went to Berkeley, to Bolt Hall. We were treated totally equally, fairly, justly.\nSo in every sense the United States gave to -- every opportunity to us. We owe\nevery bit of gratitude, you know, and thanks to the United States. I mean, look, we\ncame here with nothing, with hope. And this beautiful land, this beautiful country,\nright, gave us every opportunity. But we had to earn it. And we lived through three\nyears of high school without tutors, without aid, without assistance. We had to earn\nit. We earned it. And you know what, the rest of the way also we earned, without\nassistance, without help, right. This is a sink or swim society. Well, we survived.\nThank God. But it is only in this beautiful land, right, that gives opportunity to so\nmany people, and has, and does, you know. So I make a judgment on this country. I\ncondemn for what happened during the war and the immediate post-war period, and\nI praise this country for the period since then.\nEnd of Tape Four, Side B\n135April 3, 2008\nBeginning Tape Five, Side A",
        "Q: This is a continuation of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\nvolunteer collection interview with Alfred Lakritz. This is tape number five, side\nA. How did your experience of your childhood and your life affect the raising or\nyour children? Or did it?",
        "A: It a -- and I would tell you in truth two things. I was a very caring and -- and\nloving father. I am still, but I had my faults. And part of my fault was that I grew up\nwith a certain amount of insecurity and that insecurity strived for security to\ncounterbalance. And as I evolve there was a mixture as a person, both of striving for\ncertain security in terms of at least economic security, and striving to deal with\nanger. Throughout my life I think that the experience of my childhood has affected\nmy personality in the sense that I am much more explosive or ex -- more explosive\nthan I would have been otherwise. I\u2019m easy to get upset and I am -- once I explode,\nwhich 1s -- doesn\u2019t happen often, cause I -- I control it, or 1t doesn\u2019t give me rise to\nanger. But when I do explode, I explode. And so I was a father who was loving and\ncaring an-and -- and -- and they could depend on. But if something went wrong or\nsomething was not right, they would hear about it plenty. And so in that sense my\nchildren have a certain amount of resentment to when I wasn\u2019t as kind or as\nconsiderate or as sensitive or as -- you know, I -- as I should have been. On the other\n136April 3, 2008\nhand, my children see -- at least my daughter does, because her two sons, our\ngrandsons live close to us and we see them often, once a week at least, and we take\nthem on vacation and so forth, so on. Then I\u2019m probably one of their best\ngrandfathers that there is. So as much as I, in my pursuit of s -- trying to strive for\nsecurity for them, once I achieved that, I also was the greatest -- oh -- th -- I -- what\nam I talking about with my [tape break]. Hold on, let\u2019s start over, cause I --",
        "Q: No, you can keep talking. Oh --",
        "A: All right. In any event, so the question you ask is did it affect me as I grew up\nand matured, and it definitely does. As a trial lawyer I also see it, you know, that I\ncan easily fire up and take intellectual insult or attack, you understand, by\nsomebody\u2019s -- I think -- and I do it -- once I am attacked in that way, I become very\nforaci -- ferocious, I become like the bulldog who -- at your ankle. And I will have\nthe last word. So, yes, in one sense, you understand, I have this anger. One thing that\nhas helped me, truly, is many years ago I started to write some of my history, some\nof my memories, and that became a -- like a psychological therapy for me, in many\nways. To recount for myself -- this is strictly, you know, me, some of these events,\nsome of these experiences, some of those feelings, you know, that I have. And part\nof retelling and reminding myself and crying along the story, I think has helped me\nto -- to reconcile myself with the injustices that happened to my family. And I will\n137April 3, 2008\nsay that I believe the reason I became a lawyer was to spend my life, to ensure to\nwhatever degree I had, in capability of opportunity, to make sure that other people\nare treated fairly, according to deeds, not according to religion or not according to\nfate or chance. And after 47 years of -- as a lawyer, continuous practice of law in the\nstate of California, I think I have done that with honor and -- so the aftereffect of\nthe experience of the war is I haven\u2019t gone out and -- and -- and get a gun and shoot\nthe Nazis or the Germans. I have not taken retaliation against them or others. I have\naccepted the fate that we had, never to forgive, never to forget. And that\u2019s an\nabsolute. And I remember having lunch with this nun who was the as -- who was the\nassistant of the Cardinal Mahoney, the guy who is the Cardinal of all of southern\nCalifornia, one of the preeminent Cardinals in this country, and they had selected\nme for their -- I was the poster child for the 2000 -- the year 2000 of the\nreunification, or the year redemption between the Catholics and the Jews. And they\nhad one edition that was devoted, and I was the centerfold story, in full color, in full\neverything. And a -- after it was done, she came and visited me in my office and we\nwent to lunch together, and I expressed some of this feeling of my anger. My anger\nat what Pope Pius 12\" didn\u2019t do. What the Catholic archdi -- hierarchy did not do.\nThe choices they made, and other Catholics eminence and nuns and -- and\n[indecipherable] you know. Sheltered and hid, saved Jews and the others did the\n138April 3, 2008\nopposite. And I told her about these, you know, these mixed feelings. And she says -\n- and I said never to forgive, never to forget. She said, of course you should never\nforget. But she says, for your own soul, for yourself, you should forgive. So I have\nto say that between my own therapy in writing about it and talking about it and\nmyself and -- and so forth, and the message that she gave to me, somehow I matured\nand so I could bring myself to go back and accept the invitation of the state I was\nborn, the city where I was born, to visit. And I did it. I was very curious to see where\nI was born, where I come from, you know, this part of my trip, you know, to get my\nroots. And I got it and I was very happy. I had no resentment, on the contrary. The\nmayor was a perfect English speaking person, who had married an English girl. All\nthe people there spoke English perfectly.",
        "Q: Did you feel very German when you were there?",
        "A: No, not at all. No, no, no, no, I didn't feel German at all. This was my birthplace,\nI am honored that I was born there, in a university town that my grandfather\nselected. It\u2019s a beautiful town, I just went to my granddaughter\u2019s Bat Mitzvah, and\namong the guests there 1s her -- h-her -- one of her uncles, and he works for the\nPentagon, you know, in a secret, secret job. And he s-said he didn't know where I\nwas born, and I told him, you know, cause I showed him this book, they all wanted\nto see it. So he said, Kiel, I was in Kiel. You know, as part of the Pentagon, the -- he\nApril 3, 2008\nvisited, and he was th -- you know, toured everywhere and he was taken\neverywhere. He says -- he said to me, that\u2019s a beautiful city. I said yeah. And it\u2019s a\nuniversity city. I said yeah. You know, anyway, I am amazed that many other\nsurvivors of the Holocaust that I have met over this period of my life survive what\nhappened to them, and instead of quitting, instead of crying, instead of feeling sorry\nfor themselves, they picked up, right, and said I\u2019m going forward, I\u2019m gonna live, I\nhave to live. Right. They, you know, perished, you know, not by choice but by the\nhands of criminals and monsters. You know, whether they were the complicit one or\nthe active one, but I\u2019m going to live. And so I met a number of them, including one\nwho survived Auschwitz in the -- in a -- that Nazi symbol that was carved on his\nforehead, and he became one of the early establisher in Australia of the -- the mini-\nshopping malls. A very rich guy. And many others. They survived. They -- they\nsomehow adjusted, you know, and they became husbands and fathers and uncles and\n-- and grandfathers. I think I have the best of all relationship with my grandsons. My\nchildren love me and so forth, but they remember times when I was not too kind to\nthem, right, when I got angry.",

We create\nour own environment. And that is what\u2019s to be remembered, right? That we the\nvictim do not accept ourselves as victim, cause we are stronger and better than those\nwho persecuted us. They were criminals but we are the righteous ones. And the ones\nwho helped to save us are the righteous ones. And yes, maybe a miracle saved us.\nMaybe God did, or maybe he forgot us, but in any event, we didn't quit, and my\nchildren haven\u2019t quit and my grandchildren will not quit.

When I say normally, I say it in the\n-- in the context that all I overcame, whatever disadvantages, pain and suffering I\nwent through; for example, the fact that I was not educated for many years, right?\nFor some reason, whatever happened, in high school I applied myself to the extent\nnecessary to be able to get grades to get into Berkeley. Okay, it came.

And it\u2019s only certain time when I get angry and pushed, you know,\n144April 3, 2008\nor I allow myself to, that I lose that equilibrium. But even if I do, once I express it,\nit\u2019s out of me, right, that\u2019s one of the things, the attributes of my personality. That\nonce I let out -- I have to let things out. I\u2019m not an introvert, I\u2019m an extrovert, and so\nonce I let it out, it\u2019s gone. I\u2019m past whatever, you know, the moment is. So yes, I am\nsusceptible to get attacked or angry, and to become defensive, I think faster than\nmost people. I react trigger-like, you understand, to certain attacks. More ferociously\nthan most people, and most trial lawyers. I am not an easy adversary. If you attack --\nas long as you\u2019re civil and professional, hallelujah, [indecipherable].

He, right, who did all that, was accorded just the opposite. Every\ncourtesy, every legal rights, every right to defense, everything. So I am, on that\nsense, I felt justice was done.

So I -- you know, I don\u2019t -- I know -- no, thank God they -- they\nfound him, they caught him, they tried him, they -- they gave him every chance and\nthe guy confessed, with his damn set of excuses. You know, it\u2019s the same with the\nGermans today. When I was invited to Kiel with my cousins and I -- we were the\nguests of honor of Kiel [indecipherable] for seven or eight days, the time the -- the\ntime that they invite thousands, I believe, of people who man different -- the ships,\nwhat are they called? With the -- sailboats, they come to regatta in -- in Kiel. Kiel is\nthe, you know, so we were there during the whole week, the guest of honor. We\nwere taken to every function, to meet everybody. And -- okay. When we had the\nreception there with the mayor and we had dinner with him, we had several things\nwith him, and all -- all the other. So I was asked to, like my cousin, you know, we all\nwere invited to write in the book, the city. There\u2019s pictures of me writing. When I\nwas done writing, both good and bad, the mayor turned to me and he says, I want to\ngive you something. And he went and got out of a drawer, a picture. And the picture\n146April 3, 2008\nis part of the aftermath of the war to the city of Kiel, and it shows, you know, a very\n-- | have a copy I have included here -- a destroyed city during the winter in a very\nheavy snow, and you\u2019ve got a bunch of people who are walking on foot 1n this\ndesolate, terrible, abysmal area of the remains of the city of Kiel. Well, of course,\nthe whole city was not destroyed by the British and the American bombers. The\naccess to the port were -- the property of my grandfather it was. But he gave me that\nso that I would get the other side of the coin, to which I\u2019m very sensitive. Well, we\nhad dinner one night, he and I an-and my cousin. I asked him, wh-why did you\npeople invite us? And he says, because when we have done it in the past, the\ngoodwill that happened paid for whatever happened on both sides. But when we\nwent, the newspaper reported our visit and I -- again, I did not read the whole thing,\nbut the Christian couple who were responsible for bringing attention to us and\ngetting the city and the state to invite us and to give us what I could say is a hundred\nand five percent, 10 percent, you know, anything that you could expect. I mean, I wa\n-- it was magnificent. We had interpreter. The -- the Jewish historian Kristina\nGoldberg who is a professor there interviewed us and she wrote a whole thesis on it.\nShe had written the history of our family, which is recorded in these books, right,\nmy grandfather and -- and -- and the rest of us are all part of -- of -- you know, thesis\nand -- and -- and research that she did. But the newspaper wrote an article that the\n147April 3, 2008\nChristian couple, right, begrudge the expenditure by the city and the state for such a\nlavish state for us. So, you know, the Jewish people are very honored in the sense\nthat we have survived by our own means and our own ability to survive. Mentally,\nemotionally, economically, my family did not ask for money --",
        "Q: Reparations?",
        "A: Reparation. France paid her some money. We received my inheritance of my\ngrandparents, you know, I mean the property was evaluated 1950 or \u201951. The seven\nof us all received the then appraised value of the land. That land is one of the most\nexpensive, income producing land in the city of Kiel. Today the stadium was being\nrebuilt, you know, on that land. Of course, other land too, because it\u2019s very big and\nour property wasn\u2019t that big. And it is a place in Kiel, which is 1n the northern part\nof Germany, it\u2019s very cold. And all of the sports activity, conventions, or --\neverything of income producing to the city occurs in that -- in that plaza. So we\nreceived an appraised value of 1950, of raw land. Thirty years later, 40 years later,\nas a lawyer I wanted to know. I wasn\u2019t interested then of the money, in fact, I hated\nthem. I don\u2019t hate them more, you know, those who live in Germany today. I hate\nthose who -- who sit back, committed all these crimes, yeah, I hated them. But not\nthese that are here. And I ask because my cousins wanted to know, aren\u2019t we entitled\nto a proper inheritance, given the value of our property that was taken from us? And\n148April 3, 2008\nI asked attorneys for a Jewish, so forth, t-to advise me as to whether not we had\nrights. And I asked through the Christian couple for a set of lawyers in Kiel. I was\nwilling to pay whatever it costs. And I had these meetings and I had these reviews\nand they told me to -- you waited too long.

But I do want to say this, that the\ncover of the book, some of the books made by the city of Kiel, and the state that I\nwas born in, Germany, recites and refers and relates the history of my family, my\ngrandfather in particular. The -- Kristina Goldberg is a -- who is a professor over\nthere outside of Kiel, or in Kiel, or by the other town, I\u2019ve forgotten which, but\nanyway, it\u2019s written about, incented about our family and Kiel and what happened to\nus. She interviewed also after she did it, then she found out we were coming. So she,\n150April 3, 2008\nwith the permission of the city and the state went along with us, interviewed us and\nthen she wrote another --",
        "Q: What -- what year did you go back to Kiel?",
        "A: Kiel we went -- was it 2001?",
        "Q: Okay, okay.",
        "A: I went back to France, I mean, on the thank you trip to the nuns and to the Ros\nfamily and to the Guyaux family and the Rozinsky family. I went to thank them. I\nmade a -- a decision to do it. The Catholic archdiocese of southern California\nhelped me to locate this -- these -- these nuns, this order of -- turned out to be the\norder where Bernadette was a member, and they utilized the Catholic archives in\nFrance and elsewhere. Incidentally, that congregation was th-the congregation of\nnuns in La Soeur de la Charit\u00e9 [speaks French]. Well, I\u2019m sure nobody will\ntranslate that properly. Anyway, they have acknowledged my -- my -- my being\nhidden by them. They have included me in their -- in their archive. Now, everything\nI have said, all right, the arrest and -- and detention and death of my father is\nrecorded by the French government. It is recorded by the German government. It 1s\nattested to by [indecipherable] in his research, including the very shipment that he\nwas in, and his death, ultimate death in -- in Majdanek, by Lublin. The fact that I\nrecited, that I was honored by the Catholic archdiocese to be their poster child, right,\n151\nApril 3, 2008\nis a recorded event. It was published in their distributed publication called, \u201cThe\nTidings\u201d, and this was published in January 2001, because of the second Vatican\nand because of Pope pi -- Pope Pius -- John Paul th-the -- the -- the second. I have\nincluded m-many of the pages of the -- the 1 -- the historical research done by the\nFrench historian that I referred to in -- of the Jews of ther -- Lot-et-Garonne, which\nconfirms that what happened to my parents an-and to me. The German state where I\nwas born, not only did acknowledge what happened to us, but they also\nacknowledge the -- the death of my grandfather, my paternal grandfather and the --\nthe -- the last of my uncles, where they were sent and they were killed, at Riga. And\nthe memorial is there, they are listed 1-in the deaths of that camp, right, and I was\nsent all that documentation and th-the -- the efforts that they -- they are -- the city of\nKiel is one of the sponsor of that particular monument and maintenance, in\nperpetuity they told me. As I said, the city of Kiel, at my request created finally, a\nmemorial to the Jews which basically I have to say that all of these efforts,\nthroughout, that what\u2019s happened in Kiel has centered basically on my family,\nbecause the museum in Kiel is center -- as I said, of -- of memorial and photos and\nso forth, which ha-has my -- my cousins, my family in it. So, I have to say that my\nfamily is honored. It\u2019s sad to have that as an inheritance, but we don\u2019t feel sorry for\nourselves. We move forward, we prevail, all right. We -- we meet the challenges,\n152April 3, 2008\nand | -- I say that not as as -- matter of speech, but this is a matter of absolute fact.\nSo in what you ask, you know, the question of how did you emotionally, as I\nunderstand, I mean, cope with different thing? Well, I'll give you the proof. The\nproof of the pudding is what is the bottom of the balance sheet, right. What is it that\nyou did with your life? What is it that your brother did? What is it your mother did?\nWell, Pll tell you what my mother did. She sacrificed everything for her two sons.\nShe worked like hell. Every day she would travel, you understand, by the bus, you\nknow, from Oakland to San Francisco. Every day of her life, right, until she\nretired. Every day she worked to earn enough money, right, so we could go to\nschool, you know? Not depend on -- on charity, on poverty, or anything, you know.\nWe -- she did it. Now sure, we had a little bit of help from my inheritance, we had a\nlittle help that was given to her 1n-in -- in some reparation, you know, by the\nGerman government. Some by a pension of France, right, cause they were ab-\nabsolutely guilty of complicity, you know, to the murder of my father. I mean, that\u2019s\nabsolute. I condemn them as total accomplices, okay. The fact that my father\u2019s name\nis on the memorial of the dead in my town, right, the only Jew that is so honored,\nyou know, 1-1s -- 1s a -- 1s -- 1s a proof of the fact that some French people\nrecognized the enormity of their complicity. But to some degree, we have to\nunderstand, you know, they had limited choices. They could only act at the peril of\n153April 3, 2008\ntheir own life, and they had to depend on everybody else. So, you know, in this\nwhole ballgame, right, who are the only real, real monster? Of course, it\u2019s the\nGerman. This educated, right, most advanced culture of all became induced and\nseduced by these -- these -- these monsters. So they\u2019re all accomplices, they\u2019re all\nmurderers. Under the laws the way we have it in the United States, if you are an\naccomplice before the fact or after the fact to a murder, you are guilty of murder.\nThey are guilty of murder, period. All of them. That\u2019s it. Now, again, the -- the -- the\nimportance of my statement here is that there is balance. And those who survived,\nsome of them have survived that they can see, still see the evil and the dark of what\nhappened, and yet live a beautiful life, without forgiving, without forgetting. I will\nnever forget the murderers of my father. Never forget the pain and suffering they\ninflicted on my mother. And it would be a dishonor to me or anybody who lived\nthrough what I lived through, not to honor their mother and father, or their relatives,\nright, for their horrible, horrible death, you know. And that is the legacy. And I ask\nmyself, why was I allowed to live? You know, why was I spared? Well, I believe\nthis is one of the reasons. This collection of work, my testimony here, right. I didn\u2019t\ngive it earlier because I didn\u2019t have all the documents that I wanted, right. Now I\nhave it. Now I give it, and I give my judgments, too. I answer your inquiry, but I\u2019m\nwilling to give it to you in a sense of saying I condemn what should be condemned.\n154April 3, 2008\nOkay, there is one other point that I need to make. The United States of America,\nto its credit, has learned from the serious, horrible injustices that were done to the\nJews of Europe. And in its greatness and kindness and generosity, as was true in the\npast but not to the Jew, they became very generous to others. And that 1s a credit,\nbecause in the United States, after they recognized what they had done wrong or\nbeen complicit with, they were among the first, if not the first to recognize the state\nof Israel. They are, and stood, often alone between 1945 and -- and now -- or \u00b048, to\nbe more correct, and now, to stand and protect Israel, provide them arms and money\nand -- and support, politi -- many, many, many time the lone country, the lone voice.\nMany, many time France and England, right, who should have supported, right,\nIsrael, they voted the other way or they remained silent. The United States of\nAmerica, to its great credit, also grew up and learned. And the fact that we today\neven consider that a black could be president of the United States, or a woman\nbecome president of the United States finally, I think in great part is the lessons that\nwere learned by the United States to the wrongs that they committed to the Jews. So\nthe generosity of this country, and it is a generous country, I think in part, is a debt\nof repayment to what they didn\u2019t do to the Jews. But that doesn\u2019t diminish my love\nfor this country.",

        "Answer: My full name is Alfred Julian Lakritz.",
        "A: Alfred Julius Weber.",
        "A: June 1, 1934.",
        "A: In the city of Kiel, K-i-e-l, Germany.",
        "A: Okay, in order to understand my history, I have to begin with my paternal\ngrandfather. He was the first, on my paternal side immigrant from Galicia to the city\nof Kiel. He then helped to bring the rest of his family. He and my grandmother\nMirel, M-i-r-e-I had seven children. My father was the sixth child of that family.\nAnd my father\u2019s name is Simche, S-i-m-c-h-e Weber. They changed his name also\nto Lakritz. He was also known as Simon Weber, or Simon Lakritz. My mother\u2019s\nname is Marjem, M-a-r-j-e-m, also known as Mary, in the United States. She was\nApril 3, 2008\nborn Fass, F-a-s-s. She a-and my father were both born in Galicia. They both\nimmigrated to Germany and a-arrived and lived in different city, my father in Kiel,\nmy mother in Cologne. I was the first of three children born of my parents. I was\nborn, as I said, on June 1, 1934 in Kiel. After th -- me was my sister Rosa, R-o-s-a\nWeber, and her name also was subsequently changed to Lakritz. She was born on\nJuly 28, 1935 in Kiel, and she died I think the first or second day of her -- her first\nday of her life. She is the only member of the family who 1s buried in Kiel, who has\nin fact a burial place, other than my mother in the United States. My brother then\nfollowed and he was born on September the second 1936 and he was born also in the\ncity of Kiel. That is the extent of my immediate family. I will go into the extended\nfamily when I\u2019m asked.",
        "A: My father worked for his father. My grandfather, Artur, otherwise known as\nArthur Weber, had established a business in the city of Kiel. From what I\nunderstand -- I don\u2019t really know the whole nature of it but at -- at -- after the f --\nend of the first World War, when he arrived -- whenever he arrived in -- in Kiel, I\u2019m\nnot sure when, he established a -- a wholesale business, and I believe initially it was\nof material after the war. In any event, he then changed that business to basically a\nApril 3, 2008\nbusiness of collecting during the -- th-the beginning of the Nazi regime, of collecting\nitems that the German economy needed; raw material, reusable material. And so he\nbecame a wholesaler of schmatter and of all types of metal and all kinds o-of things\nthat they could recycle. And he, during the time when Jews couldn\u2019t find\nemployment, he employed many, many Jews of Kiel in this business, and they\nwould go through the streets of Kiel with a handcart and call out something. And\nI\u2019m -- I\u2019m relating basically what I -- what I understand. And these people would\nbuy the used material that was recyclable, that Germany needed and then they\nwould sell it to my grandfather, my grandfather was their employer and I guess he\nwas the contributor to the livelihood of many, many Jews who also came from\nGalicia and -- like he had. And they formed a community in Kiel, which is\nimportant to understand, I mean the history of my family, which is recorded in Kiel\nand in books and in theses. His relationship to the other Jews, and to his own kind of\nJews who immigrated to Germany is important. He was a very devout Jew. A\nHassidic Jew, and -- as I think most of them were when they moved to Galicia, from\nGalicia to Germany. And he was a member of the one synagogue in -- in -- in -- in\nKiel. And as a devoted and daily religious man such as my father was also, he\nbelonged to that synagogue. But the Jews of Germany who were integrated Jews,\nand my gr-grandfather kind of Jews, clashed. And they clashed culturally, they\nApril 3, 2008\nclashed religiously in their dress, in their manner, in their form of employment,\neconomically, in -- in -- in all the other way. So those two groups in Kiel, separated.\nAnd my grandfather, having a compound property an-and -- and a -- and a big\nwarehouse, and it was a big business, anyway, he created his own synagogue, and I\ntake pride in the father -- in the fact that my grandfather, whenever I\u2019ve told that\nstory, 1s the only person that I know who had his own synagogue and his own\ncongregation. And that synagogue, and the photograph of his synagogue 1s\nreproduced in the books -- in the history books, published by the state where I was\nborn and by the city of Kiel, and I was given the books, an-and -- and the\nphotograph of that particular synagogue is repeated over and over, even in the\nmuseum of -- of Kiel and -- which is outside the -- Kiel. And it is a example, I\nsuppose of that there were Jews, and that there was an existence. Anyway, tha -- I\nwant to lead up to why this is significant in my family, because I come from these\npeople. They are ordinary people, they are very religious people, they are very good\npeople. They are very honest people, hardworking people, family people, loving\npeople. And all of these people were killed during the Holocaust. Thirty-one\nmembers of my father immediate -- im-immediate I\u2019m -- I\u2019m speaking now,\nmembers of my father\u2019s family were killed in the co -- various concentration camps\nof the Nazis. All of that is verified by documents that I have collected. And I\u2019m\nApril 3, 2008\ntalking now of my paternal grandfather, my paternal grandmother, all seven of their\nchildren, all seven, if any ha -- were married, and all of them but one were married --\nall of them had children and of all of those children in the -- in this compilation that\nI made of the records of my family, I have the whole family tree. I have all of their\nnames and birthdates and places of where they were killed, and all those children but\n-- seven of those children, survived. Seven children of this large family survived the\nwar. And one of the survivor had been interned in Auschwitz. He -- he is the only\none who survived the concentration camp of -- of all of my immediate cousins. All\nof my cousins otherwise, but the other -- my brother and I and I think four, survived.\nAnd the survival of these other cousins is interesting. Two or three of them went\nfrom Kiel o-or Cologne, or wherever they were living, right now I don\u2019t recall, and\nthey went on the Kindertransport to England, okay? Of those, one, Max\nWiedman, who is my -- also my first cousin, served in the British army and then in\nthe Intelligence, because he spoke, of course, very well the language of Germany.\nHe served in Germany an -- as a -- an Intelligence officer after the war an-and after\n-- before the [indecipherable]. Two of them were in England, one then emigrated\nto the United States and that\u2019s where we stayed when we first came. Anyway, the\none who survived Auschwitz then married another survivor of the concentration\ncamp and they were shipped out to then Palestine, and he established a sausage\nApril 3, 2008\nstore or whatever in -- in -- in -- probably in Haifa if I remember correctly. And he\ndied, and one of -- and one of his child -- his son is the -- a -- a vice president or\nsome position like that in the Weizmann Institute in Belgium. And --",
        "A: Yeah, that institute, but they have offices in -- in Belgium --",
        "A: -- and Europe and he is the vice president of one of them. I think it\u2019s the vice\npresident of that, in Belgium. Now, one of my cousins grew up in Cologne, and she\nwas sent by her parents to Palestine in 1937. She -- I think her name is Ruth, right\nnow. She became one of the early kibbutzim in then Palestine. She became a labor\nleader. She was extremely active in -- 1n politics in -- 1n -- in -- and in the kibbutz\nmovement in -- in Palestine. And she, like the son of the Auschwitz survivor, and\nMax Weidman who was in England, us four were the surviving children of this\nfamily, other than my brother. But those four reunited in Kiel when we invited by\nthe city of Kiel and by the state of where -- which we were born, to return. So those\nfour, okay. The only one of the surviving children who were born in Kiel who were\nnot killed, was my brother Herbert and he chose not to accept the invitation and not\nto go to Germany, to our birthplace.\nApril 3, 2008",
        "A: Okay, well, my grandfather, as I said, had his wife and -- and -- and six children,\nseven children at the -- you know, okay, in Galicia in this little town on the\n[indecipherable] I -- I can\u2019t pronounce it. Anyway, I have the record, however it\u2019s\nspelled. And for some reason his family sent him in advance to go to -- away from\nGalicia. Apparently the lines of the Jews in Galicia at that time was becoming too\noverwhelming, too threatening, too whatever it is and he, because he was the most\nintelligent or the best, or what -- I don\u2019t know, whatever skills they gave him -- and\nhe was, obviously, a great man -- he was sent to Germany -- I mean, not to\nGermany, he was going to Denmark. So, on his way to Denmark he stopped in the\ncity of Kiel. And Kiel, he fell in love with that city. It\u2019s a beautiful city, a university\ncity on the -- on the Atlantic, on I think it was on the Baltic Sea --",
        "A: -- [indecipherable] Baltic Sea, okay. He just fell in love with the city. And so\nrather than going to Denmark, which was a little bit further up, he stopped in Kiel --",
        "A: -- and he establish in Kiel and he did -- I mean, he did fairly well, you know, for\nan immigrant, you know, particularly one with the long beard, the real Jewish\ntradition, a very Jewish looking man. Incidentally, his photo and that of th-the\nseventh child, my uncle, is also reproduced in the books of Kiel, over and over in th\n-- in the history books and it\u2019s the only picture I have of him with his long beard. I\nhave the picture of my other grandparents, my maternal grandfather and\ngrandmother and they also were of the same breed. Very religious. In fact, my\nmaternal grandmother -- I mean the father, was a -- a man who studied the -- the --\nthe -- the -- the -- the -- the -- the books, I\u2019m not sure which one right now that he\nstudied, but anyway, he studied them on a daily basis, was v -- extremely religious.\nAnd my mother lived in -- in -- in -- in -- in -- in Kiel -- I mean, in Cologne. Now\nthere\u2019s a time when my mother and her family lived in Holland, in -- I\u2019ve forgotten\nnow where. Now, when that happened, I don\u2019t know, but I assume it was during the\nfirst World War. And why they then moved to Cologne, I don\u2019t know, I didn\u2019t ask,\nI\u2019m afraid, and -- but she lived in Holland, then she moved as a child to Cologne.\nShe remained there until she met my father and they were engaged and they were\nmarried there. And then she moved, of course, with her husband to Kiel.",

And I believe that the -- of\nthe s -- a few surviving pictures that I have of my family, immediate family and of\nmy father and mother, I believe I have two things. I have their pictures that maybe\nwere exchanged, possibly. Maybe that\u2019s -- would explain those pictures.

        "A: Now, I don\u2019t know what you asked me any more, but what -- you asked me --",
        "A: Okay, all right.",
        "A: All right. Now, you were asking me about my -- the type of people that they\nwere, Okay. They were engaged, I believe in that fashion, they got married. I believe\nApril 3, 2008\nabsolutely completely that my parents were totally, completely in love with one\nanother. Tough part is coming. One of the things that hurts I think the most about\nwhat happened to my family, and I\u2019m sure many families, 1s that they were totally,\ncompletely innocent, because they were totally good people. And the injustice of\nwhat happens to my family, as it is to thousands and maybe millions of others, who\nwere just as innocent, just as good, just as nice, is what makes, in my view, the\nHolocaust such a monstrous crime. Now, my parents as I said, right, my father\nworked directly for his father. A good son, a loving son. His parents, my\ngrandparents were wonderful, loving, religious, good people. My father and mother\nwere tremendously good people. And they didn\u2019t do anything -- and I have to say\nthis at the beginning -- anything to deserve anything of what happened to them. And\nso in this context let me tell you what I remember. I remember pushing my brother\u2019s\nbaby carriage and walking with my mother in the streets of Kiel, I remember that.",
        "A: German. And -- both of us did. And I remember getting lost with a girl in the\nstreets of Kiel, and some good people -- and we went towards the harbor, cause\nwhere I live was only three or four blocks from the -- from the harbor. And we got\nlost and -- and with the neighbor girl, and she was about my age, I suppose --\nanyway, and then we -- they were -- some kind people found us and -- and -- and\nApril 3, 2008\nbrought us back or restored us to our parents. Then my memory in-involves a time\nwhen my parents went out on an evening and -- and they left us without a babysitter\nand I remember that I -- I totally obviously panicked, and I turned on all the lights.\nAnd maybe that was the time also that my brother and I were playing and I was\njumping on the bed and I fell and hit my head against an end table in their bedroom\nand I have a little mark on my forehead because of that. Now, I also remember a\nliving room. In a -- in the living room we had a tapestry in the wall and there was a -\n- a deer and the main -- that was the main attribute of this tapestry, and I was\nfascinated that he kept looking at me. Wherever I moved, back and forth, this guy,\nthis deer, he kept looking at me. That was fascinating. The next thing that I\nremember is having Pesach on the floor of our living room.",
        "A: Well, 1 -- 1 -- 1-- okay, my grandfather\u2019s property, a-as I recall involved, I\nbelieve, three buildings or four buildings. But anyway, from my memory, there is\nthe front building, you know the address of 25 Cuba -- kooba -- koober, forgot\nanyway, its name, little something. Anyway, so we lived in the front building on the\nsecond floor. Underneath that was the family of my cousins, uncle and aunt, they\u2019re\ncalled Weidman, right, they had several children. They lived there, we lived above.\nOkay. My grandfather lived over here, right, the entrance to the -- to the compound\nApril 3, 2008\nwas over here, and in the back was this warehouse, his big building. All right. Now,\nI remember being in that apartment, right? And it was, it was an upstairs apartment.\nAnd in the living room an -- we had one of the nights of Seder. And my father was\nall dressed in white and we were on the floor, we had pillows, and we had -- okay, I\nremember that. Now, the next thing I remember is an event that was very, very\ntraumatic to me. My mother was hanging up new drapes that she had made for our\napartment and she fell. And I rememb -- I remember the ambulance to take her\naway. And of course, I was three or f-four years old at the most. And I thought for\nsure they would take my mother away.",
        "A: And it\u2019s interesting how children perceive different thing and understand,\nobviously a limited amount, and that\u2019s what I was afraid of, and --",
        "A: -- the next event that I remember I believe was on Kristallnacht. And on\nKristallnacht, which I believe occurred in October --",
        "A: -- 1938, yeah --\nApril 3, 2008",
        "A: Right. The Nazis came to destroy as much as they could of the synagogue of my\ngrandfather. And I remember looking out the window with my father, you know,\n[indecipherable] down and they were burning things in front of the entrance to this\ncompound, and I remember that. And I am sure that that was Kristallnacht. Then I\nremember, and there may have been a separate day or was the same day, again my\nfather and I were crouched down the window so we wouldn\u2019t been seen, you know,\nand there were all kinds of soldiers lined up in front of our street there. Now, that\nmay have been a different time and there may have been parades that they were\ndoing, but in any event, I remember that.",
        "A: Yes, both experiences.",
        "A: Yes, that was frightening.\nApril 3, 2008\nthe soldier with his gun, you know, standing there and I was so fascinated by the\nsoldier and the gun and th -- tha -- and I remember that. And then I remember in --\nin this state of arrest by the German, whether they were soldier, Gestapo, I don\u2019t\nknow. Then we were transported -- were arrest -- I -- I believe that we spent maybe a\nnight in prison, I\u2019m not sure, but I know what I remember. I remember being on the\ntrain, right, with these German Jews that they were shipping out of Germany, and I\nremember the men -- I was with the men what -- I remember. They were praying,\nthey had their tallis, they were crying and we were shipped to Poland and then\nPoland closed its border that day.\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "A: Thank you. Okay, on this train ride, I remember getting off the train with my\nmother, so that I could make, okay, on the side of the -- siding on the plane -- I\nmean, of the train. And I remember doing that.",
        "A: Yeah, right.\nApril 3, 2008",
        "A: I remember also that at some stop, some people brought candy, ca -- chocolate\nand so forth to -- to be distributed and I remember that, and I\u2019m sure it was\ndistributed to the German. Okay, at that time of course, I was with my father and\nmother and my brother Herbert.",
        "A: Iam a little over four years old, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, this 1s just a little over four.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Lam -- yes, I am telling you, I -- what I am telling you, I remember. I absolutely\nremember. God has given me the gift, right, to be able to remember so that I can\ntestify to what I saw and experienced, what happened to of -- my family, of course,\nand others. On the train, as I explained to you, I remember this tremendous impact to\nme, of seeing men praying -- which of course I had seen, you know, I saw my father\npray every day, I went to the synagogue of my grandfather. I don\u2019t know how many\nApril 3, 2008\ntimes, but I went there. I\u2019m sure [indecipherable] in the company of my mother.\nBut here was something that really struck me as a four year old child, here were\nthese men standing with their tallis and their hats and their yarmulkes praying and\ncrying. They all understood that the German government, the German rulers had\ndecided to -- because they came and arrested all these people, right, and said all you\ncan do is take whatever, yo-you know, you can carry it in hand. You\u2019re leaving\neverything behind, right? You\u2019re abandoning everything, we\u2019re transporting you,\nwe\u2019re shipping you back to where you belong in Poland. And they were crying. And\nto a four year old child, right, the sight of men, right, that obviously a child only\nunderstands, you know, the strength and the absolute of parents, here were these\nmen crying. And I\u2019m sure maybe my father was crying. And I -- this was a real\nshock to me, yes. And later I-I was told -- of course I didn\u2019t understand anything that\nwas going on -- later on I was told by my mother -- not then, of course, years later,\nthat that day Poland had had it. It did not want to accept any more Jews being\ntransported or expelled, you know, from Germany into their country for whatever\nreasons they decided to do that. And our train, as far as my mother is concerned, our\ntrain was the train that was not allowed into Germany and it was sent back. So we\nwere sent back to Kiel. Now, the second phase, right, of -- of my story has to do\nwith how long, right, and this -- the legal system, both in Germany, then in\nApril 3, 2008\nBelgium, then in France, came and played a part on how Jews were treated. And so\nI understand, right. When I was born the Aryan laws were established, right, okay,\nwith all its limitation and so forth. But I also wi -- and I believe, I\u2019m informed that\nafter Kristallnacht further laws were imposed and restrictions on Jews, you know,\nwhich limited their employment, their op-opportunity to survive, you know,\neverything was done obviously, to make it as difficult, you know, for them in\nhardship. Okay, so in my family, what happened 1s, I believe that early 1n this\nballgame, the persecution of Jews was directed against my family as it was against\nothers, and I will tell you why. For some reason my mother became very concern\nabout their -- the future. For herself and for her children and for her husband. So she\nwrote -- I had a great heeha -- a great-uncle, her uncle, Uncle Max Fass, who lived\nin Oakland, California. And he had become a very successful businessman. And\nshe wrote to him, and I have one of her letters that she wrote to him, asking him to\nsponsor us to immigrate to the United States. His application was approved, visas\nand -- and our permission to enter the United States was approved in 1935. He had\npaid for the transportation with the Hamburg America line. We had everything.\nThe only thing we didn\u2019t have is the final stamp of the exit from Germany.",
        "A: Yes, in 1935.\nApril 3, 2008",
        "A: That\u2019s before my brother was born.",
        "A: And the little bit that \u2019'm told over the years, the story is something like this. My\nparents, of course, lived in Kiel. They had to go to Hamburg to get these exit visas\nstamped and approved. I believe that the story is this, is that my father, being a\nreligious Jew did not on the Shabbas or on this [indecipherable] holiday, carry any\nmoney. And so he didn\u2019t know, as smart as he was he did not know that they would\nrequire some payment for the exit permit. That\u2019s what I understand. He did not have\nit. So he asked them when he found out, Pll come back tomorrow when I can bring\nmoney. I have money. They had everything, okay, including the Hamburg line, you\nknow, confirmation, you know, wh-which I have a copy of. Okay. The Nazi said no.\nOkay, now you have to understand, I was born in the city that I believe was one of\nthe ultra-nationalistic Nazi cities, that\u2019s what I believe. That was where all the you --\nthe German si -- U-boats, submarines were located. That\u2019s where German armament\nships an-an-and submarines were manufactured, I believe that by slave labor, right,\nwho were gathered from wherever. I believe that was owned by Krup, okay, I am\nnot certain, but I am. Okay. In -- if I spoke and read German I could tell you better,\nyou know, than what I believe. But among the books that were given to me by the\nApril 3, 2008\ncity of Kiel -- you know, they proudly displayed, you know, their pre-World War II\nhistory, their World War II history and the post-World War history. And my family\nis there in the pre-war, my -- my cousins, you know, in the -- in the Hebrew schools\nare all over, you know, in their book. Their pictures are all over, hanging in the\nmuseum of Kiel, which is outside the city, you know, gigantic photographs of\nmembers of my family. In fact, Max Weidman, when we were going touring that --\nthat -- that museum, he said to me, see, that\u2019s my picture, that\u2019s me. He says, how\ncould it be that I\u2019m in a museum? We\u2019re looking at my face on the wall? That is\nabnormal. Anyway, but seven of my cousins are in these photographs in the Jewish\nschools of Kiel. Okay, that\u2019s -- all right, now let\u2019s see, where was I? Oh --",
        "A: Yeah, my name --",
        "A: -- okay, yeah, okay. I was telling you what I believe, right, was a -- a\nconcentrated effort by the Nazis, you know, to intimidate, to humiliate, to debase, to\ndeprive Jews in the city of Kiel, you know, of -- of a normal living and so forth. And\nthat had started, and that\u2019s where it was at. It started early in the ballgame, because\nour denial of exiting Germany in 1935, when we had everything approved by the\nApril 3, 2008\nUnited States an-and e-e-everything, right, was denied because he was in the -- an\nobservant Jew and he did not carry money. And they didn\u2019t give him the opportunity\neven to come back the next day when he would bring it, okay. I don\u2019t know of any\nindecency, you know, that\u2019s greater than to deny somebody even their right to\nreligious observance. And that\u2019s what that is. Okay, now the next story is a story that\nis also very personal to me, and it is part of this pattern. I believe that it became part\nof the -- our request to immigrate in -- in 1935 in -- I believe. I am not a hundred\npercent certain, but I am 95 minimum certain that the Germans demanded, as part of\nthe exit permits and identi -- they demanded a copy of the birth certificate of my\nfather a-and since he was born in Galicia, a -- what I understand 1s that these people\nwho -- who -- these Jews who lived in Galicia in these small little hamlets or\nvillages or whatever it is, that the --",
        "A: -- y-yeah, that the only marriage that they had was a religious marriage. They\nwere all religious, okay, and the record of their marriages and birth were recorded in\nthe synagogues, but not -- they didn\u2019t marry civilly in that area. Now, in Germany\nthe requirement is that you marry civilly and religiously, but that the only marriage\nwhich is valid and recorded and recognized is the civil marriage. Well, I\u2019m giving\ncredit to the bastards, okay? No, no, I have better words for them, but I am giving\nApril 3, 2008\nthis much as a lawyer, right? A little bit of credit that -- th-that they used the law to\nthen follow up and do the following monstrosity. They demanded, I believe, this\nevidence, the evidence that my -- my father\u2019s birth certificate. Now, I don\u2019t know\nthat he had any kind of evidence, so they -- he didn\u2019t have it, let\u2019s assume, okay,\nbecause obviously he wasn\u2019t civilly registered at his birth. So then they demanded\nproof that his parents were civilly married and they had not been, apparently. So\nwhat they did is this: they demanded of my grandfather that he sign an affidavit, and\nI have a copy of it. I have the original an -- I mean, I have a -- a -- a -- a copy of it.\nAnd in that affidavit, okay I cannot describe totally every word, but what I\nunderstand from this affidavit that he was forced to sign, he was forced to say that\nmy father was his bastard child. Remember, this was the sixth child of his wife and\nhimself, right? This is a devout, you know, couple. My -- my grandmother didn\u2019t\neven have her -- you know, she followed the -- the Jewish Orthodox custom of\nwearing, you know, a wig. I mean, this is about as gross a monstrosity, you know,\nother than -- to debase human being, right. And this affidavit that I have a copy of,\nright, attests to the fact that his son Simche, right, is his bastard child. So now, what\nthey did is they forced a -- a -- a family name change of my father, my mother,\nmyself and my brother. No, not my brother. No, he wasn\u2019t born then. This was in\n1935. So my pursuit and obsession is, to some degree it is to know who we were,\nApril 3, 2008\nwhat we were, where we come from, you know, wh-why -- who were we. Who were\nthese people who were killed in this unjustified manner? So I, in 1988 went to the\nconsulate of Germany in Los Angeles and I was received by -- and I explained to\nthem on the telephone -- and I explained to whoever I-I spoke to, and I suppose it\nwas the legal officer on the -- of the consulate, what I was after. And what I was\nafter in 19 dia -- \u201988 is the beginning of my pursuit to try to prove what happened to\nmy family, so that I could understand, so that I could know, but also so that I could\ntell my wife, my children and my grandchildren and so on, whatever future we have\nin this earth, of what happened to their fore-parents and how wrong this was and\nhow this should never happen again, to anybody. So I went to the consulate, I was\nreceived with extreme courtesy, both by the legal officer and the vice-consul. Both\nwere extremely nice to me, I -- and I explained to them who -- of course, who I was,\nan-and what my interest was, you know, and as a lawyer, you know, practicing in\nLos Angeles, they were extremely professionally connected to me. They were\nconnected also intellectually, I mean, they -- you know, and they were young, you\nknow, people, as I was. And so our discussions were very frank. And so they asked\nme a little bit of my history and I told them, you know, where I come from, where\nmy family comes from, you know, and what happened. And so they se -- I told\nApril 3, 2008\nthem, what I want to do is to establi -- I want a copy of my original birth certificate.\nI want to know why my name was changed.",
        "A: From Weber, which was the name of my father, right. His father, right,\noriginally was born by the name of Weizner. He, when he went to Germany\nchanged it to Weber. Now, I-I will tell you how horrible this is. In the documents\nthat I later obtained from the city of Kiel, the records of the city of Kiel, when he\nbought his different parcels, different l-land ac-acquisition to build this compound,\nthe record -- the record, you know, is there, you know, of his name, of his changed\nname and so forth.",
        "A: From -- no, from my grandfather, from Weizner to Weber.",
        "A: Right, okay, but from then on he is referred always, you know, from 1914, 19\nwhatever it is, you know, in those records throughout, he\u2019s always referred to as\nArtur Weber.",
        "A: Always, always. Never was his name changed, never. So when I ask that my -- I\nwanted a inquiry and obtain the -- the -- my birth certificate, and why was my name\nApril 3, 2008\nchanged? So the German consulate, what they did -- and I couldn\u2019t speak German, I\ncouldn\u2019t write German and I didn't know what to write. So they were absolutely\nwonderful to me. They handwrote the letters, and they, you know, o-of -- of who I\nshould write to. So then I brought it to my secretary and she didn\u2019t speak German\nany more than me. Anyway, we pounded away, you know, the letter and we mailed\nit to Kiel with the proper money that they told me I should send, and I did send it.\nThen -- and they -- they said to me, those two guys, they said, you know, the\nGerman nation, the German people did many horrible things to the Jews, but that it\ndidn\u2019t do. And I said, okay, I want to find out if they did or didn\u2019t do. So I sent for\nthe information and I received information back. And the information I received\nback from Kiel is my new birth certificate and two judgments of two courts in Kiel,\nGermany. One of them 1s a police court, and one is a -- another kind of court, a civil\ncourt, and both of them are judgments ordering the name change of my parents and\nmyself from the last name of Weber, which was our name, to Lakritz.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: And then they changed it to Lakritz --",
        "A: -- okay. And I will tell you in a second why, but anyway, these two judgments\nnot only ordered the name change, but they also named the judgments in order that\nmy parents were forbidden to use the name of Weber under penalty of\nimprisonment and imprison -- and -- and fines, something li -- to that effect, okay,\nand again I have limited -- I have no understanding or knowledge of the German\nlanguage, so I -- but I have the documents. So once I had the judgments, I called the\nlegal officer and I had a second meeting with them and I showed them. And they\ncouldn\u2019t believe it, that now I had the judgments of the two German courts, right,\nwhere I was born, right? My father was raised in Kiel, educated in Kiel. They were\nliving there and my grandfather had property there and my God, they were about as\nhonest a people as they obviously could be, compared to their comparative and their\ncontemporaries. And they said they couldn\u2019t believe it, that this had officially been\ndone. And they said well, you know, I mean, there\u2019s nothing to it, you know, just\nchange your name back. And so I said, I don\u2019t know if I can do it, and I don\u2019t know\nthat I\u2019m allowed to do it. I don\u2019t know that my brother will agree to do it. I don\u2019t\nknow what I can do.",
        "A: All right. Now, the name of Lakritz is my paternal grandmother\u2019s name.\nApril 3, 2008",
        "A: In other words, what these bastards did is they refused to recognize the validity of\nthe marriage between my grandfather and my grandmother and they said, okay,\nyou're the bastard son of this Artur Weber --",
        "A: -- do you understand? Now -- then, your legitimate name --",
        "A: -- 1s your grandmother\u2019s name, Lakritz. Okay, Lakritz, incidentally, in German\nmeans licorice, you know, which is a favorite candy in Germany, particularly in the\nnorthern part and also in Denmark and Sweden. And I had a story to tell about that,\nbut anyway -- but Lakritz is the family name, okay. And my brother, when I had the\nevidence and I asked him in front of his children and my children, come on, we can\nchange our name. And he says, it\u2019s too late. By then, of course, we were grown men\nwith our own children and -- and -- and he says, you know, our name and our history\nis fixed, you know. So we didn\u2019t, and I haven\u2019t. But this is something I carry with\ntremendous resentment. I have resented that they changed my name. I resent it\ntoday, I si -- resent it every day. This is one of the burning things that burns to me.\nSo th-the fact that they denied employment, that they denied exit, that they denied\nmy name, that they imprison us and wanted to deport us with anything and that\nultimately the only thing left was for us to escape, which they did -- we did, of\nApril 3, 2008\ncourse 1-illegally from Germany into Belgium. These were the beginning of part of\nthe picture, I believe, that affected of course, many, many Jews, right, many\nordinary Jews. We were ordinary people, right. And this is the beginning of my life.\nAnd it is something that I have to say, that I am sure has marked my personality and\nmy attitudes and maybe my choice of profession and my relationship to wife and\nchildren and others, because I believe that a child who 1s treated 1n this way, and in\nwhat follows, including the two years of being hidden in France and thinking we\nhad been -- we had no longer had any parents, I believe that this is one of the most\nmonstrous of crimes that\u2019s committed. The rapes and the killing that is done and was\ndone, and is done today, right, against 1-innocent people, you know, in different\nparts of the world I won\u2019t name now, but -- but we\u2019ve had several genocides and one\nor two are going on right now. The aftereffect of what this has to those people who\nare the victim is something that unfortunately is not understood, maybe rightfully so,\nand is not, I think, shared. And I don\u2019t think it\u2019s gi -- ging -- giving credit to these\npoor people. So it\u2019s not just because it happened to me, but I am speaking, you\nunderstand that, for them, you know. It was real for me, it is real for me now and it\nwill be real for them, you know, whether they are over there in Africa, you know, or\nin Asia where it happened, or in other places. So we should not and cannot think of\nthe Holocaust or the other genocides that have occurred simply in the numbers,\nApril 3, 2008\nright. This has to be measured by the effect on people, and that effect is for a\nlifetime.",
        "A: Yes, but that\u2019s part of -- of the --",
        "A: -- aftereffect of the story.",
        "A: Right, so we return --",
        "A: Yes, because they couldn\u2019t -- a-according to German law, obviously they could\nnot just take it, right? I mean, the original decree of expulsion, you know, with --\nfollowing the Kristallnacht, you know, arrested us and shipped us, but that failed.\nSo since that wa -- that failed, we -- obviously we had a right to our property, okay?\nAnd yeah, we went back.",
        "A: Right. But from that point on, all right, my mother, who is a very strong woman,\nI\u2019m sure, told my father this is it.",
        "A: Right. And there\u2019s no more, you know, we\u2019re not staying here, no matter what.\nAnd then, in some ways, they arranged for our exit, our escape from Germany into\nBelgium, and that I remember also.",
        "A: No. No, no, I mean, th-they -- we were smuggled at nighttime.",
        "A: In -- in 1939.",
        "A: Okay. Exactly when, I am not sure, but it was in 1939 that we were smuggle. I\nremember going under barbed wire, I remember that. I remember the -- the -- the big\ncloud in the sky that I thought it was God. That\u2019s what I remember. And I remember\nthen we landed in Antwerp.",
        "A: In -- in Belgium.",
        "A: And that\u2019s where we landed.\nApril 3, 2008",
        "A: That --",

        "A: Well, I'd -- I tell you when I sense danger, that I know of, right? Obviously --",
        "A: Yes, I\u2019m talking about that point. Look, when the soldier came -- you know, the\nsoldiers that I remember, the soldier --",
        "A: -- to the house, and ordered my mother, you know, to pack her --",
        "A: -- her -- her clothes, our clothes that we had to leave, you know, that -- you know,\nthat was a -- a -- a grand thing, to watch the burning of the Torahs, and the prayer\nbooks and the prayer shawls and so forth, you know, that I witnessed. I\u2019m sure that\nwas -- the fact that my father [indecipherable] you know, was -- okay. But I also\nbelieve that my parents, being good parents like so many and most good parents,\nright, kept, you know, what was going on, an-and I don\u2019t know that I could\nunderstand. But I did understand that we were going through some rather a-a-\nabnormal, you know, obviously, I mean, I had a very calm, quiet, you know, loving\nfamily, you know? What was happening was not something I could understand.\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nApril 3, 2008\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "A: Okay. Incidentally, I did not spell my bother -- my -- my father\u2019s birthplace. If\nyou want I can spell that, if it\u2019s important. Anyway -- oh, we\u2019re back --",
        "A: -- in my --",

        "A: -- and were not deported --",
        "A: -- because the Poles --\nApril 3, 2008",
        "A: -- closed their border that day to our train. So, a miracle happened, as several\nothers happened to those who survived. [indecipherable]",
        "A: Time to leave, yes. And so she, I\u2019m sure, was very instrumental to convince my\nfather, you know, look, a-as difficult as it is to leave our family and -- and our -- and\ny-y-you know, our place in Kiel, you know, with family, we have to protect\nourselves, we have to protect our children, we have to leave this hellhole. Because\nlife obviously, in Germany had become a hell for these remaining Jews. And the\nfuture, you know, offered to my parents obviously, nothing but bad and despair. So\nmy father, who obviously was a very loving father -- I mean son to his father, you\nknow, I\u2019m sure with great pain, you know, this time, left. And this time without the -\n- the dream to go to the -- to the dreamland of California and its golden paved\nstreets. I\u2019m not saying he believed that, but I\u2019m just saying that that was the -- the\nrosy image I\u2019m sure, that must have prevailed at the time. Anyway, I mean,\nsomething convinced my mother to a-ask my -- her uncle for the visa to exit\nGermany and obviously my father consented. And so 1 -- 1 -- you know, obviously\nin 1935, life and its future for a young couple was such that they had decided that\nthey had to uproot.\nApril 3, 2008",
        "A: I understand.",
        "A: So now there is a totally different set mind or -- or -- or mindset, forgive me, of\nmy parents. Now it\u2019s simply, purely not a matter of choice or -- between degrees,\nright. Now it\u2019s a matter of life and death, and they understood that. So, to protect\ntheir children, right, they smuggled -- they paid for being smuggled out of\nGermany. They left property behind, their parents, his parents, family, everybody\nbehind to do that. Now, this is important to demonstrate the character of my parents.\nAt that time they did everything they could to save their children and they left to\nprotect and to save their children, not to save themselves. And again we see the\nsame repetition of their actions in August of 1942, and the title of the movie, one\nmovie was, \u201cInto the Arms of Strangers\u201d, they are the absolute example of\nsending their children into the arms of stranger, of an unknown, to save them. And if\nthey had not done that we would all have perished in August 1942 when they were\narrested and put in concentration camp in France.",
        "A: Now, I unde-understand, but the things have to tie if they do tie. And the type of\npeople that my parents were, as other people\u2019s parents were, who attempted to save\nApril 3, 2008\ntheir children, even at the peril of their own lives is one of the recorded evidence of\nwhat happened to people. At some point some people actually had a choice, and the\nchoice was made to save the children. And I am one of those. I am an -- a survivor\nsolely because of that, only because of that. Only because my parents, right, knew\nthey were helpless, I -- without means to have any other choice. They knew that\nothers had more choice than they.",

We were learning Jewish songs and I don\u2019t know,\nwhatever it is, I wasn\u2019t learning the alphabet well enough, I wasn\u2019t learning the\nsongs well enough, I -- there was something I didn\u2019t --",

In any\nevent, if you want to know my recollection that I have of Antwerp, the -- they\u2019re\ninteresting too. I remember going to a synagogue with my mother, upstairs right, we\nwere there, I remember that. I remember one time seeing a funeral in Antwerp and I\nhad never seen such a thing. And here was this horse draped in black and the whole\nhearse was black and people were following this hearse in black and I, for some\nApril 3, 2008\nreason, was walking on the street by myself and I saw this, I was fascinated and I\nremember watching it. I remember that. I also remember that we lived upstairs in\nthis apartment in Antwerp and there was one time I was with my father and going\ndownstairs and he didn\u2019t really want me to look at what was there. There was blood\non the walls, and I was curious, I say what di -- what di -- what -- you know, why 1s\nthere blood in the hall?

        "A: -- and I remember the following. I remember my aunt and uncle coming to say\ngoodbye to us, okay, and I-I don\u2019t remember if they came upstairs, cause they\nprobably did, but I -- you know, I assume that. But anyway, I remember them\nApril 3, 2008\nspecifically looking down, you know, from the second story, third story of this\nbuilding that we lived in and looking at them and saying goodbye. Of course -- I\nshouldn\u2019t say of course, but that the last that we ever saw of them, the four of them.\nAnd they were leaving and we shortly were also leaving Antwerp, so were others.\nAnd I assume, but I\u2019m not certain that the city had already been bombed, that the\nbombing had started by the German Air Force. But in any event I know from later,\nthese people, my aunt and uncle had a young daughter, n -- and not to depart, but at\nleast to -- and that daughter was left with a couple in Holland. Why -- I don\u2019t know\nall the circumstances. My cousin, her name is Adele Mendelssohn, and she is alive,\nand she is in -- she\u2019s older than me but not by that much. And she was hidden by this\nfamily in Holland, a Christian family in -- who had another girl, right, a daughter,\nyou know. And they, throughout the war saved my cousin Adele, s-saying publicly\nthat this was th-their second child, you understand, and they raised er -- er -- you\nknow, both children. She survived the war. After the war my uncle, Michael Fass,\nwho went in our place when we couldn\u2019t go in 1935 to Oakland to emigrate, then\nmy great-uncle sponsored my -- her brother, my mother\u2019s brother, my Uncle Fass,\nand they, the whole family emigrated, went to Oakland in our place. And -- so after\nthe war, when Adele was left er -- as total -- as an orph -- orphan, they -- Uncle\nMike sponsored her and they got her to emigrate to Oakland and she lived with\nApril 3, 2008\nthem until she married, and -- which I witnessed, and she still lives in Oakland.\nAnyway, so she survive in that manner. And how and why she was separated from\nher family, I don\u2019t know, I-I only know that she was.",
        "A: And I know that she was raised and saved by this Christian couple in Holland,\nwhom she has honored in many, many ways, including designating them as the\nrighteous -- as Righteous Jews.",
        "A: Which they deserve. Anyway, where was I? Oh yeah, we\u2019re leaving.",
        "A: Okay, we\u2019re leaving Antwerp, okay. What I remember is being on the train and I\nremember hearing bombing, all right, that I didn\u2019t understand, right, but I remember\ndistinctly, you know, as a child. I am now five and three quarters --",
        "A: -- years of age, right, and I remember hearing the bombing. Then the next thing\nthat I know is we land in the city called Marmande, M-a-r-m-a-n-d-e, we li -- end\nup there.\nApril 3, 2008",
        "A: In France. It\u2019s in the department of Lot-et-Garonne. It is very close to the\nDordogne, to Bergerac. It is very close to Bordeaux and the wine country, and\nthere\u2019s a very agricultural, beautiful part of France and that I love greatly. And we\nend up in a big warehouse, that\u2019s what I remember. And I remember we were\nsleeping on straw, and hundreds --",
        "A: Yeah, the four of us. The four of us lan -- and we, among other other other --\nmaybe a few hundred people who fled with us from Belgium were housed in this\nwarehouse, and sleep there and provided some food, you know, I\u2019m sure. And by\nGod\u2019s choice, later on, after the war, my mother is able to rent an apartment which is\nright across the street from this warehouse. And there\u2019s another coincidence of\nsignificance in my history that also happens --",
        "A: Well, you know --",
        "A: A-And that -- let me tell you, the only thing I can remember, all right, and what\nfollows has significant emotional feelings. I knew things were wrong. I knew things\nwere not right. I knew things that whatever stability was born into this world, and I\nApril 3, 2008\nwas, I was in a very stable family and environment, and I thank God -- this was no\nlonger stable. Of course I didn\u2019t understand the circumstance --",
        "A: -- I didn\u2019t understand the enormity of what was happening to us. But in the\nbottom line of what was happening to us, must be recorded. We, along with\nthousands and thousands of Belg, fled Belgium because of the invasion of the\nGerman armies into Holland, into Belgium, and Luxembourg. They ultimately\nwent back home to their homes and to their businesses and their jobs and so forth\nand families. We remained. We were total and absolute refugees. We were total\nstateless people. We had totally no rights. We had no property, we had no money,\nwe had nothing. We had no rights. And we were able to remain in France only by\npolice authority and permits, which had to be renewed every 30 days. We were\nliving the life of people who have no rights to be, to live, to aspire, to hope,\nanything. We were returned to a state where you are now totally dependent on the\nwhim, the laws, the rudity, the -- the -- the anti whatever 1s, you know, whether --\nthat existed at France at that time. Obviously I didn\u2019t understand all of that.",
        "A: Obviously I didn\u2019t know the history of France, I had no knowledge of why we\nwere even there. I didn\u2019t understand anything. But what follows is I began to\nApril 3, 2008\nunderstand that we were not very stable, that we were not -- and yet, I was stable. I\nhad a mother and father who were the marvel -- marvel of the world. And I had a\nbrother, and of course we were the boys and we lived in -- as boys do. I have two\nbeautiful, magnificent grandsons and I see them growing up and I was no different,\nyou know, in terms of fighting and playing with each other, you know -- you know.\nAnd my brother and I were magnificent as -- as brothers. So the fact that we had\neach other and I wasn\u2019t an only child was very important. The fact that we had such\nloving, caring and responsible and protective parents was [indecipherable]. But the\ntruth of our lives were really terrible. And so from this warehouse, living on straws,\nthe others left, and I experienced this abandonment again and again in my life. We\nremained. And I don\u2019t know how, but anyway, they allowed us to have an apartment\nand my father went as a laborer to work for the city of Marmande. And he was a\nhealthy guy and he was strong and he was able, and -- not that he was very big, he --\nI\u2019m sure he was a little bit shorter than me, but about the same height. And I\nremember one of the things that he worked on. And he worked on setting up the --\nthe -- in the -- in the plaza, a big plaza in -- in Oakland, called the Plaza de Marie,\nwhere we later on lived --",
        "A: No, I mean, not in Oakland. Did I say Oakland? No, no, this is in Marmande --\nApril 3, 2008",
        "A: Marmande -- ma -- no, no, this is Marmande, okay. And he helped to erect, you\nknow, the -- the -- the -- the walls that was -- that were to surround this celebration.\nAnd this celebration was one of the games of the German and the Vichy\ngovernment. In this little city of 15,000 people, thereabouts, there was to be a\nnationalistic event to celebrate how France, right, had a future and France survived\nand France was in honor in f -- 1n spite of its defeat, in f -- in spite of its -- that they\nhad cut th-the country in God knows what, the portion. The Vichy government was,\nof course, the southern parts of -- of France. I was then in the Vichy government\nsection of France and Germany had taken say two-thirds a-as far as their dependent\nstate. And that Vichy government supposedly was an independent part of France,\nokay. Under the Vichy government, Vichy is simply because that\u2019s where the -- the\ngovernment of Marshal Petain was allowed to -- to be. There\u2019s two parts to this\nstory, neither one of them good, about France. This prefect, or this government\nemployee came to this city for this national celebration, and what was the purpose of\nit? The purpose was to invigorate the people, that their lot, being a defeated people,\nconquered people now, under the boot of the Germans, whom they hated, right,\nwhom they had fought 1n two wars, in the 1870 wars and the 1914-18 wars. France\n-- French people did not like the Germans, the boche they called them, that\u2019s the\nApril 3, 2008\nhated term, right, equal to the pigs. Now, the pigs, the boche now were in charge of\nFrance, and they had taken two-thirds of France. They had taken, you know, the\nbig city, Paris in the north and then all the industrial wealth and the coal, and all of\nthe -- the -- in the east, Normandy and -- and -- and -- and th-the glory. And they\nleft a little southern part, which was agricultural, you know, and wine country and\nthen the Cote d\u2019Azur and then the access to Spain. Basically a region without\npower, without economy, other than agricultural, and you know, where th-there was\nnot th-th-the great population, you know, that you have in Paris, and with Lyon and\nso forth, so forth. Okay, now, this guy came for one purpose and that purpose was to\nreinvigorate these people out of the sense of defeat and so forth, and they had this\nbig celebration. So my father was one of those employed to set this party up, okay.\nWhat followed either preceded this or followed this is the imposition now of French\nlaws, which equaled and in some ca -- exceeded the anti-Semitism of the German\nlaws. Now, as a lawyer, you know, throughout my history, and the purpose of my\ngiving this testimony is not merely to relate, you know, pain and suffering and death\nand numbers. It is to relate the context. The context, what happened, right, to the\nJews of -- of my family, is the persecution, the anti-Semitism, the hate, right, the\nmonstrosity, right, that they created. The Germans created, right -- these guys\nfantasized and invented a system of super race and super -- you know the history,\nApril 3, 2008\nyou don\u2019t want me to talk, but it is important in my part of the story that now French\nlaws follows and equates, right, in its anti-Semitism and a -- and its limitation on --\non -- on the rights of Jews, and certainly absolutely on the rights of immigrant Jews.\nAnd in France, with a history of anti-Semitism, of Catholicism, of teaching of the\nhatred of the Jewish people, right. We were the damned people, the condemned\npeople, even though we were the -- the creators of their religion and supposedly, you\nknow, ours was the-the-their chosen God, you know. Anyway, the French, not just\nin the Dreyfus Affair, but had a history of anti-sem -- Semitism and that history,\neven though it was not, you know, on the surface, it existed in reality. And I became\nnow a part of that history. And my history is how these people dealt with all of these\nformulas, all of these factors that were facing them, the Christian, right, French. And\nI now am in this milieu, in this -- and how these people deal with the world as it\u2019s\nevolving out of their control, and the minimal amount of their choice, or the choices\nthat they make either actively or passively, with regard to people like me, is part of\nthe reflection of their religious education, their family education, right, and their\nlaws. And the laws of France, to the shame of France, right, went to adopt German\nanti-Semitic laws and gave to the -- to the Germans the right to dictate to the Vichy\ngovernment what the French police, the French states and the French functionary\nwould do to the Jews, particularly the refugee -- refugee Jews.\nApril 3, 2008\nEnd of Tape Two, Side A\nBeginning Tape Two, Side B",
        "A: Right --",
        "A: -- okay, now --",
        "A: -- what I remember is I said is my father working to set up this f\u00e9te, they call it --",
        "A: -- in France. And I also remember a little thing like I remember walking and\nsmelling the roses. I remember being fascinated by snails after the rain. And I\nremember one lady telling me to go collect snails for her and I did, and so she gave\nme some money. And again, an act of kindness that again I wa -- re-repeated later.\nAnyway, that\u2019s what I remember basically of Marmande and I remember where\nthat apartment was. Again it was an upstairs apartment. I know that it was close to\nthe tomato -- tomato factory.\nApril 3, 2008",
        "A: Marmande is a city that is famous for its tomato, and the Marmande tomato\nwas very, very famous in France.",
        "A: In fact, on the -- on the streets of Paris where they sell the produce, my brother\nsaid that he found, you know, stands that said Marmande tomato, and later on I\nfound out that in the recent years they change the tomato, an -- and anyway -- to\naccommodate machinery. But in any event -- yeah -- but anyway, that\u2019s what I\nremember about Marmande. But then comes a change. We are no longer allowed to\nlive in Marmande. We are now forced to take up residence in the little hamlet\noutside of Marmande, seven or eight kilometers from Marmande. And this little\nhamlet is called Saint-Pardoux-du-Breuil. Saint-Pardoux-du-Breuil now is of\nimportant development in my memory because then I really understand. My eyes are\nopen, I really remember, I really see.",
        "A: This is sometime in the 1940, I mean, or \u00b041.",
        "A: I believe it\u2019s in the 40\u2019s. I -- I don\u2019t think that we live in Marmande very long,\nbecause the city, the police, would not allow us to stay there longer. I don\u2019t know,\nbut I suspect that because -- and I suspect this because of the fact that I learned when\nApril 3, 2008\nI visited Saint-Pardoux again -- and I\u2019ve done that several times after the war, I\nlearned then that there were several Jewish families in -- that lived around or in the\nhamlet, around the hamlet. And I suspect that there was probably a good French\nchoice in that. I believe that they kicked us out of Marmande to put us in an area\nwhere collectively we were separated, but we were separated from the city, but we\nwere easy picking for when they wanted to --",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "A: The French. The French police, the French city hall. A -- they made --",
        "A: -- y -- oh yeah, yeah, and they -- and -- okay. Now, I forgot one incident in\nMarmande which is very important in my life, and I have to go back to just this one\npoint. I remember my father conducting the high holiday services in Marmande.",
        "A: Yes. And I remember my father also blowing the Shofar during the service, and I\nremember the room, th-the -- the -- the -- some parts of the ceremony, you know,\nthat I remember. He, of course, was a very religious Jew, and a very intelligent man.\nAnyway, so he conducted the service. Well, as God would have it, when we were\nApril 3, 2008\nreunited with my mother in November 1944, the city of Marmande allocated to her\nthat apartment, and we lived in that apartment in -- 1t was 1-1-in -- that building was a\nhistoric building, it 1s a historic building and street. It is a magnificent building,\nwhich comes from the Middle Ages, right, and it stands t-today, and it -- it\u2019s\nbeautiful, it\u2019s --",
        "A: The address is on a little street that I cannot remember the name of, but it is -- I\nmean, it\u2019s probably, I think probably the only really historical street of Marmande,\nright, and I\u2019m sure those buildings were available because they were historical\ndocument to the city -- I mean, buildings to the city. And we lived again on the\nsecond story, seemed to live in second story. And we were given that building. And\nthat building, I don\u2019t know that it had electricity, and it had dark staircases and entry\nhall. The building was made up of mud and wood, you know, an-and -- and wheat --\nI mean, and -- and a -- you know, the remains of -- of -- of wheat. I-In other words,\nthis was the construction. But it\u2019s beautiful, you know, it\u2019s very authentic, you\nknow, and -- and there are other buildings like that down this little narrow street of\nOakland, which they preserved, you know --\nApril 3, 2008",
        "A: Of Marmande. Of Marmande. It is Marmande, I am not talking about\nOakland, I haven\u2019t gotten to Oakland. But anyway -- and I remember we living in\nthat apartment after. But anyway -- so, before we go to Saint-Pardoux-du-Breuil,\nthis is what I remember, my father conducting the religious services, and I probably\n-- it would be a guess, but I would bet you that everybody there is dead, that died,\narrested by the French police, turned over to the Nazis all [indecipherable] which\nraises the other question, the question which is, you know, how can God have\nabandoned all his people?",
        "A: If we were in fact the chosen people, this is what we were chosen for? So there 1s\nlegitimate religious dialog which is another of the [indecipherable] in my history.\nMy -- law is on one s -- hand, family and love and -- and -- and -- and -- and -- and\nthe sense of obligation and commitment and protection to the children, of your\nchildren, to preserve them. And now comes this other question of, you know, where\nis God 1n all of this? Where is God we\u2019re in the trenches, right? Where is God, you\nknow? What have we done, God, to deserve this ultimate punishment? We are\ndamned, condemned, hated, despised, you know, abandoned in every sense of the\nword. We have no rights, we have no property, everything is taken from us. God,\nwhy? You chose us according to our religion to be the chosen people. Did you also\nApril 3, 2008\nchoose us to be this ultimate suffer -- and if we have been chosen, right, for that,\nthen my story is the testament that I want to leave to my children, grandchildren an-\nand generations forever, because if there is a truth here, then there 1s an equal truth\nhere. But if there 1s a lie here, then there is another one, right? In other words, if\nthere is no God, if there 1s no religion, obviously then there\u2019s no commitment, there\nis no covenant, there is no obligation, right, and religion is a farce. But if there 1s,\nwhy did this happen to us, you know? And so this is a dialog, a philosophical\nquestion which has to be posed, right, and maybe it has no answer, and that\u2019s okay.\nNor is there proof that there is a God. But the point 1s, all of these things intersect,\nintellectually, morally, religiously, philosophically, in my life. And then what\nhappens? Okay, anyway, we end up in this village of Saint-Pardoux. It\u2019s not a\nvillage, it\u2019s a hamlet. The people there are magnificent people. We are given a\nhabitat and that habitat, and I will call it that, is a mud floor, it is a chicken coop and\non the other side there\u2019s the -- the cows, and -- and that\u2019s there whatever it is, I\u2019ve\nforgotten now. Okay, and we live in this chicken coop, two rooms, mud, no\nelectricity, of course. And it had the little well and the little area for a garden that\nlater my father creates. And this was given to us by the Marshal Feron. The\nMarshal Feron lived across the street, this 1s his property, the -- the property is of\nhis mother across the street, but the cows are hers, right. And this Marshal Feron is\nApril 3, 2008\na very devout Catholic. One of his sons is in the seminary at the time to become a --\na -- amonk. And we\u2019re given -- we\u2019re loan -- we\u2019re given this place, without, of\ncourse, charge.",
        "A: Yes. Now, the --",
        "A: My parents?",
        "A: Unfortunately my father long ago left us.",
        "A: Yes, they are learning French, oh, oh -- oh yeah, at the time. I\u2019m going to tell you",
        "A: -- that\u2019s the -- raises an interesting question.",
        "A: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Now --",
        "A: No. My parents speak German to us. Okay, well, I will tell you about this. This is\nanother of these anomalies or -- you know. First, this man and his wife are very,\nApril 3, 2008\nvery religious Catholics. They give us this place to live. This was the same place\nthey gave to people who escaped Spain in the Spanish war. And people -- those\npeople fled from there to Saint-Pardoux-du-Breuil. Why, I don\u2019t know. They\noccupied the same place and they left later on back to Spain. Well now comes, right,\nthis part of history, right, which is connected to the other history, right, to the -- this,\nand now they\u2019re refugees again. And so these people again, with their good hearts\nand their good attitude and their good intention, they lend it to us and they help. N --\nthis 1s part of the Berny, B-e-r-n-y family, and these people, the little street up to --\nlittle bit of a hill from where we lived to where they -- their homes and his -- his --\nhis shop where he makes the metal horses and the metal -- I mean, the -- the shoe for\nthe horses and he makes hoes and he makes hammers and he makes all these things,\nthis wonderful guy. And up the street is the school. And in -- the two room school,\nand I go to school. And I -- my first el -- schooling -- wait a minute, hold on a\nminute. I also went to school in Marmande for a short time. I started school in\nMarmande, yes, the very, very first grade, whatever it 1s, right, that I am -- I am six\nyears old --",
        "A: -- so the first grade. Yeah, I remember. Ah -- yeah. My first day in school was in\nMarmande, okay? So we still there October, November, okay, maybe December,\nApril 3, 2008\nbut anyway -- but I\u2019m in the school. And I remember raising my hand in the class to\ngo to the bathroom. I needed to go to the bathroom and the teacher didn\u2019t see me, so\nI pissed in my pants, okay. I ri -- and maybe she didn\u2019t understand because I didn\u2019t\nunderstand, but I remember raising my hand, and I remember that. I also remember\nthat we were learning a French poem, with -- a very famous poem from La\nFountain, | think or -- about the hare and the rabbit, and I remember that in that\nclass. That\u2019s all I remember in that class. But anyway, then we go back to my story\nin the hamlet, in -- in that par -- Saint-Pardoux-du-Breuil. Okay, now, this is a\nvery, very, very interesting and traumatic episode in my life. The Berny family\nowned a lot, an empty lot across from the schoolhouse. And they gave my father the\ntask, the job to raise a garden for them in this lot. And I remember going up to him\nand bringing him lunch, and I remember him kissing me. He was all sweaty and had\nbeard and all of that. Oh, that re -- that reminds me. I remember also the city of\nMarmande had given us a garden. A place where we co -- where each family could\nhave its own little garden and cultivate their own vegetable. I remember that now.\nSo maybe we were in Marmande maybe a little bit longer, you know. But anyway,\nI remember that and there is a connect to that one. Gee, I didn\u2019t remember that in\nawhile. Okay, anyway, he was there. Okay, now I went to that school, and I\nremember learning to count with sticks, and so we had sticks, packs of 10, right, and\nApril 3, 2008\nwe had a rubber band around them an-and that -- we learned to count there. Okay, I\nremember that, but I also remember something else that was not so nice. I remember\nthe other boys -- other boys, they grabbed me and they tied me or something to the\nfence and they said that I was the Christ killer and that they wanted to punish me or\nwhatever it 1s, and -- I told this story also to this French historian and she reported it\nin her book, and I am sure this happened. That\u2019s why she reported it in her book.\nThat in this environment of Saint-Pardoux-du-Breuil, you have this play of\nattitudes of people. Here is this family being helped and sheltered, allowed to\nsurvive, when nobody was allowed to give work to the refugee Jews, and yet they\ndid. And at the same time, the children of others of the age of six and seven, equal to\nme, target me as a Christ killer. And obviously they didn\u2019t come up on this on their\nown. Obviously this was taught to them. Obviously this underlines what was\nhappening and the crimes of the Catholic church are now descended on me. And\nthey descend on my father, because what follows, right, is a choice made by French\npolice, and French government and French -- and I have that whole testimony laying\naround that I will tell, about one of the men who had the power and didn\u2019t exercise it\nto save my father\u2019s life, but who confessed to me that if he had known that the chief\nof police, his friend, right, he was the exec -- my friend Guyaux, right? Gerard\nGuyaux, a man of extremely great kindness and character. This man, at -- one of the\nApril 3, 2008\ntimes I went back to France, and this time to reward him for what he did for my\nmother, my father\u2019s memory and for us. I gave him a plaque as I gave to others. And\nthis man said to me -- admitted something to me, and he says, there\u2019s nothing they\ncan do to me any more, I\u2019m too old, but I could have saved your father\u2019s life. And if\nyou blew a bomb right there in front of me, I -- I don\u2019t think -- among the many,\nmany shocks that I\u2019ve had in life, this was one. And he -- and he explained to me\nwhy. He said to me, when they ordered the arrest of your father, and I participated in\nthe arrest -- cause he was the chief officer of the city of Marmande, and Saint-\nPardoux is within the -- the -- the -- the -- the -- the power and the sphere -- the\nspace -- the jurisdictional surrounding of Marmande, under its jurisdiction. He said,\nI could have saved him, but I didn\u2019t know that the police, the chief of police, was of\nthe same mind as I, that we didn\u2019t want this killing of innocent Jews. We didn\u2019t want\nto make the choice between refugee Jews and French-born Jews. But I didn\u2019t know\nthat, and he didn\u2019t know I could trust him, and I didn\u2019t know I could trust him. And\nso when your father was ordered to be arrested in March 1942, he was arrested,\nobviously, with the consent and the cooperation of the city of Kiel, and the police of\nKiel and of him.\nApril 3, 2008",
        "A: I mean of -- of -- of Marmande. I am sure that the things that he did for my\nmother after the war and for my brother and I was to repent and to atone for what he\nhad done. I\u2019m telling you, my father\u2019s name stands on the war memorial of -- of\nMarmande. My father\u2019s name also is in another memorial farther in France, I don\u2019t\nknow where [indecipherable], course he is in there and the memorial to the Jews\nthat were deported from France, which is in Paris, that they have built in recent\nyears. But the one in Marmande is the one that means something. He became the\nmajor of the city of Marmande. He became the representative from that region to\nthe assem -- French assembly. He was a -- a man of tremendous personality and\ncharacter, and again, a very religious man, a very French man. And again, they --\nthis interplay, you know, of -- of -- of what they feel, what they do, and what they --\nand who they are, all right? It -- 1t plays into this whole -- you know? And what\nfollows again 1s this conflict, between others who are obeying orders, others who are\nwillingly passive, others who are willingly complicit and others who are morally --\na-a-a-a-abhor, and afraid or you know, feel impotent to do anything. And so all of\nthese people, I meet all of them. So, when I\u2019m in school I\u2019m treated well by the\nteacher and a -- you know, I\u2019m allowed in school, and I\u2019m just a normal kid. But the\nkids in the playground, I\u2019m not the normal kid, I\u2019m a Jew, dirty Jew, right? The\nBerny family, one of their son is the guy who is the vicar to the church. The church\nApril 3, 2008\nis -- in this hamlet there is a very prominent church, a very beautiful church\n[indecipherable] in the Marshal Feron, right, and the rest of it are farms, and this\nis a very, you know, beautiful, other than the school. Anyway, I remember many\nthings. And one time I went back and the son of Berny, right, who had quit the\nmonastery, you know, when I met him, I did -- you know, when the -- you know. So\nhe didn\u2019t become a full fledged priest or monk, or you know. He chose not to. So\nwhen we revisited one time, my wife and I, the first time we went there, I took my\nchildren, and I couldn\u2019t enter the building, that chicken coop, it was locked and there\nwas nobody around, you know. But another time we came back and they were there,\nthe Bernys. And so they -- he took me around. And he said to me, you were an\nextraordinary child. He says, you learned the patois, which is the local French. You\nlearned it in no time at all, you could speak it as well as anybody. And he says, you\nused to sit on my lap and I would read you stories, you know. He says, I was amazed\nthat you could speak French, you know, you could speak the patois, and obviously I\nunderstood my parents who spoke German. And they were learning, you know,\nFrench too. And so, I guess he really liked me, and well, a lot of people, you know,\na-as a child that I was liked. But above all, my brother was liked more. You know,\nhe was a very loving and the second child in family, or the second boy in the family,\nthey\u2019re always innocent, they\u2019re always sweet, right? And so he was. Now, for some\nApril 3, 2008\nreason my mother, to help us 1n our survival, got a sewing machine and she started\nto sew. And because of the hard work of my father, you know, toiling in -- in other\npeople\u2019s jardin -- gardens, my mother started to do seamstress work. And because\nof that she was able to survive, through that skill. Now, the life for us in -- in Saint-\nPardoux-du-Breuil is a very interesting -- it\u2019s very pastoral, it\u2019s very country, it\u2019s a\nlittle hamlet. Everything -- you walk. If there is any transportation it is by either\ncamp -- two cows pulling a wagon, or one horse pulling a wagon. I remember many\nmen many times -- my mother would send me to this farm to buy some milk or to\nsend me someplace to get bread and you had to go there, walk there. And once in\nawhile, you know, people would give me rides, you know, on these wagon. I\nremember everybody was so nice, they would give you a ride, you know. And I\nremember walking on this little street and they grew watercress, and that was\nwonderful. I remember. But anyway -- and my father cultivated a garden and -- in\nour -- 1n our -- in the side yard. And I remember that he used human excrement as\npart of the fertilizer, and we were together. And a lot of it was happy, and some of it\n-- Iremember my father getting mad at me and yelling at me, and my mother\nprotecting me and I was running around my mother\u2019s skirts, and holding onto her\nskirt when he was yelling at me and my mother was yelling back at my father to shut\nup and whatever. Anyway, here comes June, July, 1942. I am just eight years old,\nApril 3, 2008\nand I am now condemned to become an adult. My parents decide, through some\nJewish agency, whatever, to send us to a summer camp. And we leave Marmande,\nSaint-Pardoux-du-Breuil. | remember the railroad station, my parents bringing us\nto the railroad station. I remember the last look I had of my father ever, there waiting\non the quay, or the -- what we call -- what do we call? Well, whatever we call now,\nwith my mother --",
        "A: -- wa -- platform, right, waving us goodbye and I remember waving them\ngoodbye, of course never thinking that anything was in the offing. But that\u2019s the last\ntime we ever saw our father. I was just eight years old, my brother was less than six\nyears old. And on this train we went, and I believe we went to a summer camp in the\nCreuse. The Creuse is the C-r-e-u-s-e of southwest France. And we are in this\nsummer camp, operated by some Jewish organization. It could be the OSE, okay, I\nam not certain, but I believe that it -- it is them.\nEnd of Tape Two, Side B\nApril 3, 2008\nBeginning Tape Three, Side A",
        "A: Right. Now, we\u2019re in this camp with Jewish children, run by Jewish adult leaders\nand -- and everything is wonderful and normal and so forth, as far as a child 1s\nconcerned. It\u2019s play, it\u2019s hiking, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s everything, it\u2019s games. Suddenly there is a\nday that I can never forget. I\u2019m brought in with my brother to the office of Mr.\nKohn. [ only know his name by the fact that I have four of the letters of my father of\nwhat prompted that particular meeting. And this Mr. Kohn says to me and my\nbrother that our parents want us to stay with them. And I then develop terror. I don\u2019t\nthink there is any other word to describe what I felt then. I saw out of the window\nthat other children were leaving with their baggage, whatever th-they ha -- they had\nand here is me and my brother in this dark office and this man at this desk telling me\nthat my parents don\u2019t want us to go home, that they want us to stay. And I have a\nbrother who is not even six years old. I am just eight years old, and I am now put in\na position that I have to understand, or cope and deal with the idea that somehow our\nparents don\u2019t want us to come home, but other children are going home to their\nparents. I am not going. That\u2019s impossible. There is no way you can explain my\nApril 3, 2008\nabsolute connect. This is the first time I\u2019d ever left my parents, ever, and they -- they\nsend me on the summer camp with other children, to play and have fun. That\u2019s --\nokay? Other children were there to play and to f -- have fun, too. But that they\nshould go home to their parent, and I -- they want us to stay? That is a moment of\nabsolute terror. Total incomprehension. Th-There is nothing that can describe it,\nnothing that can describe my feeling at that moment. I am paralyzed, I am horrified,\nI am scared, I cannot comprehend. This is one moment in my life where nothing\nmakes any sense. And believe me, that has impacted my life forever. That moment.\nThat revelation. And of course I had no understanding what, why, but the total\nincomprehension. I mean how could my parents, you understand, make this\njudgment? They -- it\u2019s impossible. Anyway, I remember being there, and from that\nmoment, for the next two and a half years, I became the guardian of my brother.\nAnd I became obsessed that he should never be separated from me for a moment,\nbecause I was afraid of what was going to happen. If he was separated they may take\nhim away from me, an-and no way. So, I succeeded in most terms, but there was a\nperiod of time when he was housed someplace and I was housed in another one, but\nthat became an obsession with me, that I would go into freaky periods if they\nsuggested anything that I should be separated from my brother, or my brother should\nbe separated from me. So these other children went home, and a few children stayed.\nApril 3, 2008\nAnd we stayed with these, some of the Jewish -- for lack of another term, I mean\nthey were adult supervisor, guardians, whatever you want to call them, in this camp.\nNow, they then proceeded on a plan, and the plan I can only describe is a plan of\nsurvival of our people. They put us through the ritual of every holiday, we had to\nobserve them absolutely. We had to put handkerchiefs on our wrist on Shabbas, we\nhad to observe every holiday religiously. I remember the last one we observed was\nSukkoth. I -- 1-1-1n that place in -- in -- in -- one of them had drawn a map of -- of\nIsrael -- Palestine on -- on a -- a thing with a light bulb behind it, and this was in\nblue, th-the -- the whole region. I remember that very well. I remember games being\nplayed, you know, then they would toss us in -- in blankets, you understand, I mean,\nwe were little kids.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember, but there were very few.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, yeah.",
        "A: It\u2019s not a camp in the sense -- I -- it\u2019s fenced. It\u2019s on a little, you know, a little\ncountry house --\nApril 3, 2008",
        "A: -- you know, it\u2019s a country house.",
        "A: Okay, and I have pictures after the fact, a few.",
        "A: But in this camp I have the absolute conviction that these Jews had a sense of\nimpending doom. That they were teaching us only about Judaism, only about our\nreligion, only about the Promised Land, only about the -- I remember that. And I\nhave the absolute conviction that these people were trying to preserve our religion\nand our people in th -- whatever means they had, and that -- in the hope that some of\nus would survive. Now, I remember several incidents, but let me tell you one. And\nthis incident is recalled by another child, not necessarily in the same place, but the\nsame event happened to him. And of course I don\u2019t know him, and I didn't know,\nbut in the French book that was written by this French historian of the Jews, what\nhappened, the Jews in the Lot-et-Garonne of France that she researched, among\nthe many people she interviewed, she interviewed another survivor who told her the\nvery same story. And I don\u2019t know him, he doesn\u2019t know me. But the story basically\nis this. I remember that those people change our names. And so my name was\nchanged from Lakritz to LaCroix. LaCroix means the cross. It\u2019s a very French\nname. And one day they told me, and the other children too, we\u2019re going to have\nApril 3, 2008\nthese people visiting and they\u2019re going to ask you some questions, and when they\ndo, when they ask for your name, make sure, don\u2019t forget, give them your new name\nof LaCroix. So now I am eight years old, I have a new name and now there are\npeople coming to interrogate us. And so sure enough these people came. I remember\na woman, very well dressed, and some other man, but I remember the woman, she\ntalked to me. And I told this story to the French historian, among many stories that I\ntold her -- not many, but anyway -- and she reported that story in her book, right.\nAnd she gives credit to someone else telling her the same story, some guy who now\nlives in -- in San Diego, and who also had the same kind of -- the same people.\nWell, these people were Quakers, and this was an organization of Quaker, where\nthey tried to save some of the children from France and to ship them to England or\nAmerica, and I remember that afterwards, you understand, we understood that these\npeople were there to try to save us an-and ship us by -- by ship, but that became too\ndangerous and we could not leave. But I also remember that by that time I was a bed\nwetter and boys, other boys were making fun of me and they were trying to get me\nto stop and -- and the way they hope was they wouldn\u2019t allow me to change my bed,\nand so every night I had to sleep in a bed that was full of, to put it in plain\nvernacular, piss, right. Smelled like hell. A-And that was my punishment, my sort of\n-- they\u2019re trying to teach me not to do it. Now, I\u2019m sure e-everybody that has any\nApril 3, 2008\neducation about children understand what I didn\u2019t know, is that I was so\ntraumatized, I was so terrorized, I was in such pain, right, that that\u2019s how it is. And\nobviously no child should be treated this way. But of course it was not their doing,\nobviously they were saving us, protecting us, hoping that we could survive and --\nand continue our people. To that extent, they succeeded. These were heroes. I owe\nthem everything. Even though later I gave some of that to the nuns who sheltered me\nalso, Catholic nuns, I give credit and my life wouldn\u2019t be what it is or could have\nbeen if it wasn\u2019t for my parents, and if 1t wasn\u2019t for them and if it wasn\u2019t for\nChristians that [indecipherable] follow my story. Numerous human beings who\nbehaved at the risk of their lives and their liberties. And this is no speech, this 1s a\nfact. Anyway, from the Creuse, from that -- we went to another place and when I\nsaw a few years ago a movie called, \u201cThe Children of Chabanne\u2019, | said, I\nremember that place. I was there. I was one of the children that was sheltered in that\nchateau of the French journalist and these two, also all Christian teachers who\nsheltered Jewish children, orphan children, who had to fight off, you know, th-the --\nthe police who wanted or were curious, who -- wh-what are you doing with these\nchildren? What did -- where\u2019d they come from? And of course if they were Jewish\nchildren they were to be arrested and turned over to the French police who would\nApril 3, 2008\nthen turn them over to the -- to the Nazi. And I remember one night we were told\nthat we had to leave. This --",
        "A: All right, let me just tell you this. This photo that I have of my brother and I with\nberet and wooden shoes, I believe was taken while I was at Chabanne. I know I was\n-- | had a problem with the dentist, I had pain and so I was taken to a dentist. I know\nthis photograph was taken. This photograph was mailed to my mother, right.",
        "A: No, not that I\u2019m aware of, none.",
        "A: None, no, I never -- I --",
        "A: -- I never heard anything, but my mother did hear.",

        "A: -- so far, all right, in the documents of this museum.",
        "A: And she got these photographs. And so there were one, two, three, four\nphotographs that were mailed to her by this Jewish organization --",
        "A: -- I believe it\u2019s OSE, of the different camps where we were hidden --",
        "A: -- from place to place. They weren\u2019t camps, they were homes.",
        "A: Okay, and they were -- so one place was the Chabanne, and I absolutely believe\nthat, and these other places were again in the Creuse and then later were in the\n[indecipherable] and then we shipped then to the Pyrenees. So from the Switz --\nthe border with Switzerland there -- they -- they sent us there in an attempt to get --\nto smuggle us into Switzerland and that didn\u2019t work. And then they shipped us\ndown to Lourdes where thousands and thousands of French war orphans were there,\nApril 3, 2008\nand that\u2019s located near the border with Spain and so they sent us there for sure, to\nput us among this great mass of orphan children that we would be saved in that\nprocess. So --",
        "A: Yeah. So the time -- I left off a moment ago was, we\u2019re in Chabanne okay, it\u2019s a\nnight and they suddenly now get the notion they have to evacuate the children, and\nthat\u2019s part of the movie, you understand. Well finally they goi -- the police is going\nto arrest everybody and we are smuggled out, right, into -- I go to a train and God\nknows where ts --",
        "A: With my brother, oh --",
        "A: -- hysterical with my brother.",
        "A: Yeah, okay. And we go to another place, right, again with Jewish children. And\namong these pictures that I have --\nApril 3, 2008",
        "A: -- right, are pictures of other children and it\u2019s a matter of judging from picture to\npicture which w -- you know, how old I am. But in one picture, my brother and I are\n-- are the youngest. In another picture we are also the group of youngest --",
        "A: -- children there and then the oldest are older children. And again we are -- right.\nAnd we then spend two and a half years moving from place to place with other\nJewish children. Of course, 1-1-in a -- a house in -- however strange that may be, we\ndon\u2019t go to school, we don\u2019t do anything, we just play. And people are watching us,\nfeeding us, and --",
        "A: No, I\u2019m sure that we -- we are basically with some of the same children, yeah.\nAnd -- because I absolutely remember when I look at the picture, I remember some\nof these people, and I remember them, they are in this picture, and they are in this\npicture. So, it\u2019s the same people.",
        "A: I-I don\u2019t know where they\u2019re from. I mean, they could be -- you know, th -- in\nFrance at that time, from what I understand of the research that\u2019s done, I mean, you\nhad refugees from all over --\nApril 3, 2008",

        "A: So I don\u2019t know every word, or everything he said, okay. These, among other\ndocuments, and I have many of them, will have to be translated. I have not had them\ntranslated, but they basically describe, in this letter to Mr. Kohn about us, my\nbrother and I, about my uncle in Oakland. My father sends this camp director 50\nfrancs for our care. Obviously he asks them to save us. I don\u2019t know if he says why,\nI don\u2019t know what he says, cause I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s all German. But I know what I\ndidn\u2019t know, and I know now what I didn\u2019t know 10 years ago. And what I know is\nthe following; that the French government on orders of Vichy had established under\nFrench law, certain conditions for arrest of Jews.",
        "A: With a preference of arrest of refugee Jews. And they made various choices,\nsome totally idiotic, you know, doesn\u2019t make any sense, but -- so some people were\nallowed to keep children, and others were -- the children were to be arrested with\ntheir parents and sent to this camp in Casanuri. Casanuri was in the department of\nLot-et-Garonne. And shortly after my father and mother sent these letters to the\ncamp director and to my uncle, great-uncle in Oakland, they were arrested by the\nFrench police, the both of them were put in this camp at Casanuri. And among the\nidiosyncrasies of the French, one of the exceptions that they made for th-the\nApril 3, 2008\nincarcerated Jews was that if a woman was pregnant, they would release the couple.\nSo my mother, in her usual good sense and courage, told them she was pregnant. So\nshe was examined by the doctor and the nurses and the doctor and nurses said she\nwas pregnant. The book researched by this wonderful Christian writer of the history\nof the Jews -- and I came at the tail end of her research. I came just before the\npublication. So obviously she didn't record this from my say-so. She had recorded\nall of this. Her name is Marie-Juliette Vielcazat Petitcol. Her book is, Terre de --\nd\u2019Exile, Terre d\u2019 Asile. It was pe -- published in 2006 and she -- she was telling me\nshe was finishing and the books was going to get printed. Among the many things\nthat she had discovered, well before me, was where my parents were incarcerated in\na ca -- I didn\u2019t know where they were. And when I told her I don\u2019t know where they\nwere, she said, but I know. And I said, this is what I know happened in the camp,\ncause my mother told me. You know, she feigned to be pregnant and that th-the\ndoctor of the camp and the nurse said the -- they confirmed that, even though she\nwasn\u2019t. And as a result, my parents were allowed out of the camp. I\u2019m going to tell\nyou a historical fact, that if we had been with my parents in Casanuri at the time\nthey were arrested, we would all be dead, because the French categorization of who\nis going to be shipped in to Drancy and then to -- to Auschwitz, at the time, in\n1942, and then th-the enormous amount of Jews who were, and were shipped, th-\nApril 3, 2008\nthey were all wiped out. They were all killed in the concentration camp. The only\nthing that saved us was these two events. The fact that my parents, right, decided\nthat we should not come home, and that strangers had a better chance to save us than\nthey did, cause they were helpless. And then comes this other story, that my mother,\nyou know, tells this story to the doctor, and the doctor says, yes, you are pregnant,\nconfirmed that. And this fine human being with these fine nurses -- they are named\nin here, in this book. And you know, if I said it privately to you before the start, or I\nsaid it otherwise, I think I have come to a time where almost every important event\nin the history of the persecution of my family, and I\u2019m talking about my immediate\nfamily, that I have gotten the evidence. And you will hear, as we go along that that\nhistory goes to today. That there is a memorial now in Kiel, Germany, where there\nwas no memorial, only because of me. Because when I visited Germany, I asked\nthem, you know, I -- the only memorial that you have that remains, of the presence,\nand the persecution of Jews in Kiel is a little marker on the side of the curb of the\nstreet where the synagogue was burned, the main synagogue of Kiel. Other than that\nthey had no memorial to the Jews or to the -- to the concentration camp, or to the --\nthe whole Holocaust, nothing. So when I went there, I asked them, I will pay for it. I\nwill pay, you know, if you make a memorial. And what that memorial should consist\nof -- I understood the environment -- I said, it is a plaque like you did for the\nApril 3, 2008\nTemple, except with the plaque, plant a living tree. And I want you to know that the\ngovernor of the state wrote to me in 2005 -- I went there in 2000 -- and they have\nsuch a memorial and a living tree. And two of my cousins were invited to come to\nthe inauguration, and the one who 1s the vice president of the Weizmann Institute,\nthe son of the Eichmann survivor, is the one who spoke, right. And again, in the --\nin the -- in the stories that were published, again it\u2019s of my family, right, and all of it\ntracing to the -- my grandfather and th-the -- the photos of the ceremony, of the\nmonument on the back of -- of the -- one of the buildings, the synagogue of my\ngrandfather, and here 1s also in one of the other newspapers, several of them, you\nknow, were sent to me, is this Christian couple. And this Christian couple is the\nreasons we were invited to Kiel. They are the ones who sa -- researched the\ndocuments for me in Kiel, other than what I obtained on my own. They are another\nevidence of the -- th-the -- the goodness and -- and the fact that people do care, and\nthey care immensely, because they -- they suggested to the city that they should\nhonor those Jews who survived and who were born in the city of Kiel. So they\ninvited my surviving cousins --\nEnd of Tape Three, Side A\nBeginning Tape Three, Side B\nApril 3, 2008",
        "A: Okay, there are many things I remember about that period. It\u2019s difficult for me to\nrecall any particular conversation I had with my brother. It 1s not difficult for me to\nrecall a number of events that I remember very specifically. The one thing I\nexpressed earlier, and I say it again because it helps to explain; I had an obsession\nand fear, absolute fear, that I would be separated from my brother and he from me. I\nmean, this was an absolute fear. And obviously that fear is clearly tempered and\nexplained by the fact that we were suddenly separated from our parents, right,\nwithout any comprehension or explanation by anybody. So now what happens in\nthis episode to my brother and I for two and a half years 1s that we are in the\ncompany of other Jewish children, so they are contemporaries. Some are older, right,\nmany years older, cause we\u2019re very little, and some of them are about our age, and\nwe play and -- and -- and do things like little children. One of the frightful memories\nthat I remember is my wife and I went for two weeks to a place in -- in the south -- I\nmean in the west -- I mean the east part of France call -- a city called Anisy. We\nApril 3, 2008\nwent there to attend a French school provided to foreigners and we thought that\nwould be really fun for her and I to go to French school, and she would learn a little\nFrench. In the meantime we have two weeks of vacation. And during that two week\nperiod, one day -- I mean, every weekend I would take her and we would go around.\nAnd one of the points that I tried to find, I tried to find where I loo -- I was hidden in\nthe upper plateau of a big city called Evian, on the lake -- on the shore of the lake\nGeneva. And so one of them was this big house in -- in -- which is in one of the\npictures, and I wanted to find this place. Now anyway, so one of those weekends we\nwent someplace else, and this very nice woman w -- we had to find lodging, we had\nno reservation, so she offered us a room in -- in her big house, whatever it was, a\nhostel and so on. And some story about that her son -- I was looking to locate this\nplace and that her son might know something, you understand, that he was cognizant\nof the history and th -- and th-the -- during the wartime and the resistance that\noccurred there and the -- the Jews. And so we went to her place, and she showed us\nthe room, and it was terrible. Anyway, so we didn\u2019t want to stay there. But as we\nwalked out, there was a queue -- a line of little children going to dinner, I guess, or\ncoming from dinner, I don\u2019t remember exactly, my wife will remember. And I was\nabsolutely thrown back to that time when this reminded me about me, about me and\nthe other children, that this is how we were, we went on line, everything, everything\nApril 3, 2008\nwe did was in part of the others and that we had little pajamas in this little house and\nI guess they were going to bed. I guess that\u2019s where they were. And I -- it was one of\nthose moments where you\u2019re taken back to this memory. Anyway, these were times\nwhere we had the company of other children. Other children who were in the same\nboat as we were, and we knew we were in danger. We knew that we weren\u2019t allowed\nto go out and play, we were not allowed to do anything in the exterior, everything\nwas done in the interior. In the Ault Sevoir we did something on the exterior, there\nyes. We went on hikes like in this one picture. I remember going 1n forests, I loved\nhiking, I loved forests, I loved nature. I remember those things. Then they sent us to\nLourdes. Lourdes is, of course, the home of the historic religious event of\nBernadette and there at first we were all together, placed in the pensionne and next\nto this pensionne were lodged these German Luftwaffe pilots. And we knew they\nwere our enemy. And so I remember one day we had a snowball fight with these\npilots. And I remember putting rocks, and the other boys did too, rocks 1n the middle\nof our snowball and sending them, you know. We knew these were --",

All I know 1s that these\nGermans were our enemies, the German -- now in -- in the town of Lourdes, it was\neasy, Okay, it was very easy. In the town of Lourdes the Germans were in total\ncontrol of the town, okay. You couldn't walk, you understand, they had barriers,\nbarbed wire with guards, you know, everywhere.

        "A: It -- 1t is not just that we were very young, it\u2019s that ...J am not sure. I am not sure\nhow we supported one another. I don\u2019t know how we survived. I don\u2019t know how\nwe coped. I don\u2019t have any idea really, to understand, you know. The only thing that\nallowed us to survive 1s the fact that there were other children around who were in\nsimilar circumstances --",
        "A: -- as us. And -- and so in that sense, you know, the will to survive is very strong,\nobviously in everybody. Also to be normal children, to play like -- I mean, we were\nlooking for the four leaf clover, I remember that. We -- we played all kinds of game\nwith the -- with the string --",
        "A: -- on our finger. That was our toy, you know, I mean this was a toy that we used\nevery day, cause that\u2019s the only toys we had.",

        "A: -- in these photographs, okay. But some of the others absolutely did not stay with\nus, or we with them. What happened to them I -- I have absolutely no knowledge.",
        "A: Now I\u2019m in Lourdes. So I know that first we were in this ma -- in this\npensionne, right next to the Luftwaffe office. So then we are moved into a hotel.\nThe hotel is built around th -- tourism, and all their hotels everywhere. By the\nhundreds of thousands they have rooms, you know. Th-They all cater to the -- to the\nCatholic --\nApril 3, 2008",
        "A: -- you know, who come to pray for cures.",
        "A: The Pope, John Paul the second, he went there for a cure. And so have there --\nby -- for over 150 years have they gone there, for sure. Now after, in the hotel -- up\nto then we\u2019re together, and then they move my brother. So now I -- I\n[indecipherable] okay, I cry, I scream, I -- God knows what I did. Anyway, but they\nassure me that I will see him and I will be with him and that I shouldn\u2019t worry, that\nhe is going to be fine and I\u2019m going to be fine, but they have to separate us. And I\nam certain that they separated us because there was a danger, because our French\nmaybe wasn\u2019t perfect, and he was younger, and he was innocent and he could speak\nup and give his real name and identity and then be discovered, then we both die. So I\nthink they separated us there. In other place before that we were all with Jewish\nchildren, so it didn\u2019t matter. But there it matter, because we were hidden with all of\nthese orphan Christian children, by the thousands, you understand. And I\u2019m sure that\nit was an act of preservation, to protect us. So they put him in this place and they put\nme in the convent, and I was in the convent on the grounds of the Basilica of\nLourdes. The [indecipherable] magnifique and I was, I believe, the only child that\nwas hid -- Jewish child hidden by these nuns on that -- in that convent. Now, it\u2019s\nreally not a convent. What it really is, is a hospice. And it is the place where this\nApril 3, 2008\norder of nun take care of the medically invalid visitors to the city of Lourdes and\nthey come there and these nuns are nurses and they nurse these people during their\nstay, right, which is provided for free, I\u2019m sure. And now comes the war, there\u2019s no\ntravel, right, nobody can move, and now they have nothing to do and these children\nare being brought in, you know, by the government. Rounded up from France and --\nand brought into the city cause it\u2019s -- they\u2019ve got the road, they got the hotels\nunoccupied. The state takes over all of those hotels, and they offered, obviously, to\nshelter some children. Incidentally, I want to go back to tell you one part of the\nstory. Among -- and I haven\u2019t -- I haven\u2019t come to the further development of what\nhappened to my mother and father, but one thing has to be said, is that my parents\nwere totally, completely trapped. They had no means, no right, no power to move.\nThey had no papers, and police, French police would stop people, you know, for\nidentification and you know, identity card, you know, with photograph. I mean,\nthere\u2019s no way you could move. So my mother one time told me about that they had\nto go somewhere, all right, even at the risk of their lives, but 1t was that important.\nWhat it was, I don\u2019t know. And so she described to me the -- the -- the -- the episode\nfor my father and I. They would walk at night on the road and if they saw two lights,\nthey knew they were policemens with their bicycle lights, and so they would jump\ninto the --\nApril 3, 2008",
        "A: -- the ditch next to the road to hide. And that\u2019s how they travel, right, to wherever\nthey were going, I don\u2019t know where, but anyway, the point that I\u2019m making is that\nwhen they were shipped from Marmande, they were not allowed to live there any\nmore, and we were in this little hamlet. I said earlier that in my understanding of it,\nthey were put there for easy picking, all right, by the French police. And the whole\nsystem was geared around keeping them there, locked in, with no escape and no\nmeans of escape. So now you can understand this couple, right. Now they say, oh\nmy God, we have sent our children away and they\u2019re going to come arrest us. Now,\nokay, then comes the second judgment, well better they stay there in the protection\nof this organization then, cause we are trapped. We cannot escape, right. So they are\nlike animals in the cage and the French are inhospitable. The police 1s absolutely\ntheir enemy, right, and hunt -- their hunter, right, and they know it. They\u2019re going to\nbe arrested at the whim of -- of the police. They have no power whatsoever. So the\ntotal abandonment, you know, of these people, the total fact that they\u2019re totally left\nwith no escape --",
        "A: -- right, explains how bad things were to them. Okay, now back to my -- I\u2019m in\nLourdes, I\u2019m in this convent. I\u2019m the only child there and I have experiences there\nApril 3, 2008\nthat are very life long. I remember on the ground of the basilica by myself, I would\ngo and visit the grotto. I was alone and I remember praying there. What I prayed for\nwas for my parents. So the question you asked me about my parents, there I know. I\nknow what I prayed for. That\u2019s what I prayed for. And so I never lost hope. I never\ngive up, no. There I went to pray, and not once, but quite a few times. And today\nwhen I revisited Lourdes in the year 2000, of course there are hundreds, thousands\nof people with candles an-and the whole paraphernalia. But here\u2019s a grotto, I was the\nonly occupant. It was just me.",
        "A: Ye -- I was -- I was -- no. There were -- there were other children sheltered in the\nconvent, maybe 30 - 40 or whatever they sheltered, but not many more than that,\nyou know.",
        "A: Maybe fewer than that.",

        "A: But I don\u2019t remember.",
        "A: Okay. Okay, I don\u2019t remember that. I do remember that this convent had a priest\nand he was a young priest. And I remember one day walking with him, the grounds\nof this long basilica, this long walkway, and I told him that I resented that I had to\ngo to -- to church every Sunday morning and that I was not allowed to kneel.",
        "A: Oh yeah, oh. No question. And he said to me in retort, and I remember it, never,\nnever, never will forget. He was the nicest guy, he really loved me. And he says,\nwell at least I don\u2019t make you go to catechism. So now, the way he said it, catechism\nwas absolutely something terrible.

        "A: Okay. With my brother, I had contact with him from time to time. And one day\nthe liberation, and I was -- before the liberation came, and some woman -- the\nFrench had organized some kind of system to ask local habitants of Lourdes to\nprovide a home for these orphan children, you know, to give them a little bit of a\nfamily, a little bit of that type of experience. So a woman volunteered to have me,\nyou know, that she would be -- okay, she was unmarried, that I would be her, you\nknow, like big brother, so to speak, you know, that idea. And she turned out to be a\nApril 3, 2008\nwonderful Jewish woman. By some choice of the Almighty, maybe, it turned out she\nwas a Jewish French woman, and I was to be her little boy.

        "A: Tarbes, right. In Tarbes, my brother and I are ne -- housed with this family of fa\n-- French Christians. I know this is not a pleasant time for me, and my brother, he\nremembers very well that they didn\u2019t treat me very well, but they treated him okay.\nOne day I remember an event I can never forget. This woman from a Jewish agency\ncomes to visit and she has me sit down with her and she looks 1n my eyes ... 1s a\nmoment I never, never, never, never, never could forget. She looks in my eyes and\nshe says, we have found your mother.",
        "A: I tell you, no human being can have greater, you know, pain and -- and joy at the\nsame moment. The obvious 1-1s that obviously I had despaired for two, say two and\na half years. Obviously I had prayed and hoped, and now this hope was bringing this\nmoment and this news. Now this was in the context that other children or other\npeople had told me that they planned on shipping us to Palestine. That they were\ngoing to ship us to Palestine, which meant, obviously, that they all assumed that we\nwere orphans and that our parents had been killed. And I knew that. And now this\n100April 3, 2008\nwoman brought this news. This was the first word I had on my parents for two and a\nhalf years, almost. And I tell you, I told the story to these two French journalists, and\nI know one of them published it in his newspaper as the lead, you know, in his\narticle and they reported when I came to thank the Italian farmers, I didn\u2019t talk about\nyet, about my mother, what happened to my mother. Well, they had hidden her for\nth -- a lot of that two and a half year period. And I went to publicly thank this family\nthat I visited many, many, many times. I consider myself a part of their family, they\nconsider me and my brother part of their family, certainly. They consider my mother\npart of their family. Anyway, I told these newsmen this, and -- and newspaper men\nand they considered that to be what I consider it, th -- not fully appreciating the\ncontent. Anyway, so shortly after that, by this Jewish organization we were taken\nand reunited with my mother. And I remember my mother there on the same\nplatform of the same railroad station, standing just about exactly the same spot that I\nlast saw her, say two and a half years before, with her close friend that she\ndeveloped, this Madame Rozinsky, and her son, who became my close friend. And\nthey were Jews of -- from Alsace-Lorraine and they were spared. They were spared\nin the town of ma -- Marmande, and two doors down was another Jewish family by\nthe name of Alco, all of these were our friends after the war, and they were spared\nbecause they were French born. So in France that\u2019s another thing that happened.\n101April 3, 2008\nThere was a very, very, very, you know, factual difference of who survived and who\nwas not allowed to survive. And we, the refugees Jews in France were the ones that\nwere handed for slaughter. Knowingly, obligingly by the French. And the other one,\nthey spared.",
        "A: Well, it was a shock, because she had gained weight and I was conscious of that,\nbut it was my mother, and that I recognized, and there was no problem from that\nmoment. That\u2019s it, I will tell you.",
        "A: No, I\u2019m sure she cried. I\u2019m sure I cried.",
        "A: My brother was a different number, you know. He left her and I don\u2019t think he\nrecog --",
        "A: -- a-and he did not recognize her, he did not. And I think my mother said that,\nyou know, that he didn\u2019t recognize --",
        "A: Yeah, he was too little. And he had no memory of his father either.\n102April 3, 2008",
        "A: You know. I had two years on him, and I have very, very strong, you know, very,\nvery strong memories of my parents, you know. And so I don\u2019t think we needed to\nsay any words.",
        "A: Now -- I don\u2019t think there were any words.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Well, she had gotten this apartment. She was allocated by the city, right, through\nthe Secretaire Generale, the -- th-the administrative chief of the city hall, who\nadministered that apartment that I referred to --",
        "A: -- where my father had performed the -- the high holiday services, and we stayed\nthere. And I remember being in that apartment when the liberation of Paris came,\nand I remember making little flags of America and so for -- and Britain and -- and\nFrance, you know, and I hung them on the window, and I remember that. You\nknow, we, as opposed to children today who have everything handed to them and\nmade for them, right, they have to use their talents in different ways. I was a creator.\n103April 3, 2008\nI created my own toys, right, and the flag was my la -- you know, and so yes,\nFrance was there in a very happy state at that moment.",
        "A: And so was I. And so after we stayed there a -- you know a short time, you know,\nin that apartment, then we were given the apartment I said on the Boulevard de\nMarie, opposite the warehouse and there we lived. And my brother and I went to\nschool, and he became a closest friend to a boy named Saresh Guyaux, whose\nfather was Gerard Guyaux, that man -- they lived just down the street, the side\nstreet. And he helped us to survive, you know. And my mother\u2019s story is an\nimportant story. She was left with my father and they struggled, right, until --\ntogether after they were released from the camp at Casanuri. Then they lived in that\nsame mud chicken coop, as my wife calls it. And one day the police came, as\nexpected, and they arrested my father. And his arrest is also recorded in the books\nthat I have. I mean, I have every evidence of why he was arrested on the orders of\nEichmann, for the -- as ar -- act of ret -- retribution against the killing of two\nGerman officer in Paris. And Eichmann declared that there should be a punishment\nfor this, 2000 Jews were to be arrested throughout France and turned over to them\nat Drancy, and the French complied. My father was one of those who was arrested\nand he was put in the camp of Gurs, G-u-r-s, and for transportation to Drancy, and\n104April 3, 2008\nfrom Drancy at fra -- Drancy on the night that he was being shipped out to go to his\ndestiny, he didn\u2019t know where, but anyway went from Auschwitz to Majdanek, and\nhe was allowed one goodbye, farewell postcard, that he mailed to my mother. And\nthis I have, and it\u2019s dated March the third, 1943, and instead -- instead of saying au\nrevoir, or instead of saying something else, he misspelled but says the word, adieu\nwith an exclamation mark, underscored twice, in big letters. He knew he was headed\nfor death. And he said that we should have bon courage, you know, strength to deal\nwith it, and he sent us his love.",
        "A: He was born in 1907.",
        "A: In 19 --",
        "A: He was not 36, he was 35, to be 36.",
        "A: His birthday is in June, like mine, like my son.",
        "A: All born in June.\n105April 3, 2008",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: And his card is there and I have it in --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yeah, oh yeah. I have the original card, I have the original letters that he wrote,\nof abandonment. [indecipherable]",
        "A: -- the information. I have the original. I have an original copy or I have the\noriginal affidavit of my grandfather, right. These are original documents, yes.",
        "A: Her story is -- and I will tell you now, because a story -- history should know not\njust what she endured, but how I look at how she endured. I consider her about as\ngreat a woman, a mother as there can be, in fact, I call her an angel. After my\nfather\u2019s arrest in February, at the end of February, 1943, she is left alone. She has no\nidea if her children are alive or dead, except th-there are a few photographs that are\ngiven to her. And she, of course, knows nothing of what happened to her husband.\nAnd so she is left there alone, right. And she speaks the language cause she picks up\nApril 3, 2008\nthe language fast. She\u2019s a seamstress, she is known by the farming families, you\nknow, who use her. And one day she 1s asked by this Italian farmer\u2019s family, the\nRos family, R-o-s to make a wedding dress for their one -- their second oldest\ndaughter. So my mother makes this wedding dress for her, and she did, I guess, a\nreasonably good job. Then they ask her to make the suit for the groom. So she\nmakes that. And from then on they are totally connected, and they become her\nprotectors. So, they take her away, she is all alone, right, obviously a woman in\ntremendous pain and they give her a family and a home and a place. So this is two\npeople who had immigrated from Italy when things were bad in northern Italy in\nthe early 30\u2019s. And they became tenant farmers in -- in the southwest of France at a\nchateau called LeCook, and -- by a woman who was Madame deFerrier, a noble\nlady of -- not noble in act, of course she was noble in act, but her name was of the\nnobility. And the tenant farmers that they have 1s this family, Ros. And this couple,\nthe Ros\u2019 are two magnificent -- magnificent human beings. They are farmers with a\nlittle education. They have six or seven children, right now I\u2019m not counting them,\nand they have this farm. And so they take her in and from time to time, you know,\none of their son, you know transports my mother by bicycle to their farm, which is\nup on this hill, at the mas dejeuner. And she is all alone so they adopt her and they\nhide her. Their oldest son is ordered into Germany as part of the -- the -- the -- the\n107April 3, 2008\nGerman orders, it takes one child from certain families, you know, to -- as laborers\nin Germany, and he is one of them, and he\u2019s not there. So I guess in the sense they\nconsoled themselves because they have some connect in that sense. Anyway, she\nspends a lot of time there, and they even hide her. One time I was taken through\nwhen I returned. When I was a child growing up there I wasn\u2019t interested in any of\nthis, but when I returned with my wife and -- and children to LeCook, LeCook had\nbeen sold to a German couple, but they were -- they allowed us to come and visit\nthat site. And I was then taken through the chateau, as I had been as a child, we used\nto play there all the time after the war. But I was shown a room in this chateau that\nhad a secret wall, and my mother was hidden in that wall. So when police came to\nLeCook to check what\u2019s what, and so forth, so forth, they would hide her in this\nwall, you know, which was a fake wall. So, in my family so many things happened\nthat happened to other Jews in other places and so on, even that happened. Anyway,\nthese wonderful people kept her, nourished her, gave her support, moral and\nphysical in that sense and helped her over this period. A photograph that I have of\nmy mother shows her extreme pain. And she is in one picture shown, that\u2019s all I\nhave, when she is with her sewing machine [indecipherable]. Then the next picture\nI have of her is two and a half years later when we\u2019re reunited with her. And she\ntakes us with joy and pride, you know, to visit this family, to bring her sons. And the\nApril 3, 2008\npain in her eyes 1s so clear and her pride is so clear. And I have two photographs,\nyou know, of that particular event, where she even made the clothes that we wear.\nAnd she is bringing her boys. And this family that I went and thanked and -- and so\nforth, called just two or three weeks ago. We haven\u2019t heard from you, where are\nyou, what\u2019s happening? Why aren\u2019t you here, you know? And -- a-a-anyway --",
        "A: These people, we would go during -- we, of course immediately applied to\nemigrate to the United States with the help of my uncle --",
        "A: -- now, not -- not my great-uncle, but my uncle.",
        "A: Right. And as fate has tha -- an-and justice not, we -- presumably one of the\nreasons that the United States of America went to war against Hitler was about the\nhorror that he was committing against the Jews. We, who already had been given\nentry into th -- America in 1935 --",
        "A: -- when my mother applied, that was an unrecalled event. We were then placed in\nthe quota, the most extreme quota that United States immigrant quotas had\nestablished. And that was in 1945 --\n109April 3, 2008",
        "A: I was then living in Marmande. I -- we left it --",
        "A: We -- we stayed in Marmande until we emigrated to United States in 1950.",
        "A: So for those five years we lived in Marmande. Well, my mother applied\nimmediately for -- a-after the war was over, she applied immediately for pro -- visa,\nwith the -- of course with the sponsorship of my uncle, and we were placed in the\nquota of Poland, which was then behind the Iron Curtain --",
        "A: -- that they had raised, and now instead of being in the favored status, we were in\nthe most un-favored status and we had to wait five years to a -- be allowed to\nemigrate to the United States. Now, on the ship that we took to emigrate, were\nGermans. Germans who had applied for the right to live in the United States six\nmonths ago. And I, the victim of the Holocaust, the horror for which this country\nsupposedly went to war, I had to wait five years. Now that same crime was repeated\nover and over since that time, to now. People are allowed on fantasy, and made up\nand so forth, so forth, I\u2019m being persecuted, I am -- so therefore all the Iranians, the\nCubans, the Vietnamese, the -- anybody anywhere in the world is allowed to enter\n110April 3, 2008\nthe United States on the say-so, violating their tourist visa, you understand, and so\nforth. We, who were the absolute victims of the war, right, from whom everything\nwas taken, the property, the inheritance, the families, the rights, our father,\neverything. We were treated in the most, right, abject, the most reyected. We had to\nwait five years for the privilege and the right to emigrate to this country, right, this\ncountry to whom we had been sponsored, and this country had already, right,\ngranted us entry in 1935. That promise was broken. Now, I love this country and I\ncondemn this country. You know, I have one understanding, you know, in the recent\npolitical thing that\u2019s going on and they\u2019re condemning this Reverend Wright, right?\nAnd I do, I condemn him too, for what he said. I don\u2019t think he has a right to say\nwhat he said. On the other hand, there is a level of understanding on my part. And\nthat is, when a person, right, is part of an environment where this country denies to\none group the rights and privileges guaranteed under the Constitution and the law,\nand it denies them indirectly or otherwise, by use of the law, then somebody has a\nright to be angry. I am angry. I truly resent the fact that Mexican and others from\nLatin America daily, you know, cross our borders without any permission, any\npermits, anything. I had to go through every demands. We had to prove we were\nhonest, healthy, able people, that we would be able to survive in this country without\ncharity. We had to swear at the point of entry in New York -- I remember my\nApril 3, 2008\nmother had to sign an affidavit she didn\u2019t come here to kill the president. I thought\nthen, I\u2019m 16 years old, this is a joke. How can that be a demand, you know, on\nsomebody who\u2019s entering here? Yet it was. So, as wonderful as this place 1s, 1t was\nthe promised land to me from the time I was one years old, that\u2019s where I wanted to\ngo. Germany was no longer my home, I had no home. France was not my home, I\nnever accepted it, right. I knew I didn\u2019t fit there. I didn\u2019t belong there. They hadn\u2019t\noffered, they hadn\u2019t extended, you know. Yeah, they were tolerating us, and they\ndidn\u2019t persecute us and they didn\u2019t harm us, other than what they did, right. But this\nwasn\u2019t my home, and it wasn\u2019t my mother\u2019s home. My brother wanted to be -- h-he\nwanted it to be his home, cause he had grown up there. He didn\u2019t know anything\nelse. And he was doing good in school and I wasn\u2019t. I had no interest in going to\nschool.",

        "A: Okay, I wanted -- I wanted to say one thing --\n117April 3, 2008",
        "A: -- before I do, because I don\u2019t know how much time we\u2019re going to spend, that\nI\u2019m available. But one thing I want to say is this, because it ties into the first part,\nbefore I get to what happens here. One time I went to Jerusalem, to the Yad\nVashem, again to find my roots. And this was 20 years ago, I think. It was -- well, it\nwas on the anniversary of the state of Israel, so thi -- I know that. And I -- I think it\nwas 20 years ago, but anyway -- and I went to the Yad Vashem to ask -- you know,\nto apply for -- I-I wanted to connect to my family, to my roots. And so I filled out a\ncard and I went to hand it to the man at the counter, and the man looked at it and he\nsaid to me, the information for you isn\u2019t here. So I looked. He says, I have the\ninformation that you need. So I said, yeah? He says, I\u2019m going to bring it to you. In\na little while he came back with these two gigantic books, and he says, there 1s what\nhappened to your family. I didn\u2019t know what it was. I open the book and it\u2019s called\nGedanta volume one and two, the collection of the Jews of West Germany killed\nby the Nazis as reported and recorded by the Nazi -- I mean, post-war by -- and in\nthis book I looked under Lakritz and I don\u2019t find my father. So I decided to go\nunder Weber, and I will tell you, 1f you would have exploded an atomic bomb, I\ndon\u2019t think I would have been more shocked, more surprised, more in a state of total\nemotional disconnect and connect, ya -- total. I opened the book, I go to Weber, and\n118April 3, 2008\nthe first thing I read is the name of Mirel Weber, geb Lakritz, from Kiel. That\u2019s\nmy grandmother. So I run down, the next name I find is Simon, initial S, Lakritz\nWeber. And they put his place of residence and where he died, Majdanek, Lublin,\nsometime in 43. How in the world they restored to him his name of Weber as a\nmemorial to him is -- I -- I totally without any comprehension. How they went\nthrough the records and restored to him his name, is unbelievable. So the connection\nto my pursuit of my name, my identity, my roots, here it is confirmed in the\nGedanta book, handed to me in the Yad Vashem. And so I said -- and I looked then\nfor the other relatives, the Weizmanns, and they\u2019re all recorded, anyway, everybody\nin the Weizner is in, they are recorded. Aunts and uncles and cousins whose deaths\nare recorded. Anyway, so now let me come to what happens in United States of\nAmerica.",
        "A: We come to Oakland, right, and we stayed with my Uncle M-Mike and my\nAunt Eda and her -- her three children. They\u2019re my cousins, these are my uncle and\naunt. We are welcomed in New York by an -- a niece, a cousin of mine, Friedel\nKnesh.",
        "A: I will tell you. Imagine for a moment that a child has a dream, that California in\n119April 3, 2008\nAmerica is the dream. I remember docking -- well, no, first I remember coming --\nentering into the port of New York.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. It was a port that left -- m-my mother arranged for us, before we\nleft Europe that she wanted to see Paris. She hadn\u2019t seen -- we hadn\u2019t been there,\nand she wanted to go to Rome. And so she arranged to -- from a -- through a Jewish\nagency, right, that we could have these periods. Remember, we didn\u2019t have much of\nanything, everything was taken from us. And we were not poor people in Germany,\nbut we didn\u2019t own the -- th-the -- the -- the -- the retail store, you know. We owned a\nwholesale schmutter, okay. Well, we were good anyway, not rich. And here we are\nand so she\u2019s getting help, you know, for us to immigrate to United States. So we\nleave from Naples. What was it you asked me?",
        "A: Yeah, I -- I knew the name of the boat.",
        "A: Anyway, it was an ordinary commercial boat.",
        "A: Okay.\n120April 3, 2008",
        "A: Right. So I remember docking, but before docking, we passed by the Statue of\nLiberty. And when we were in Paris, before we left, and we were sightseeing and so\nforth, we found the replica of the Statue of Liberty, you know, by the guy who --\nwho made th-the thing. So I saw it, and mm, look at that thing, huh? Yeah, it\u2019s not\nso big. Anyway, but it was nice, an-and you know, and gave you that umph, you\nknow, hope, you know. Next time I see you, I'll see your big sister. And there I was,\nI saw the big sister. You know, here was the promised land, you know. Here was my\nlife, all right. A boy who had very little given to him by France, right, and\neverything hoped for in the United States. So the Statue of Liberty was a moment I\ncried. When we docked, then we disembarked and there were people crowded\naround and whate -- and behind the fence, you know, and my mother found her\nbrother and her sister-in-law, who were there. And of course I didn\u2019t know them, but\nof course I found out right away who they were. Anyway, so after we -- we cleared\nthe -- everything else, I think I had to go to the bathroom. And so somebody, you\nunderstand, it was Friedel\u2019s husband, who was -- the husband 1s a -- was a tax1\ndriver, I remember in -- in Brooklyn. They lived in Brooklyn. My aunt and uncle\nhad come from Oakland across the United States. I know those four people were\nthere. And it must have been him, he took me to a bar to go to the toilet. And I saw a\njukebox in this -- I had never seen a jukebox. I was amazed. This thing plays music.\n121April 3, 2008\nI was totally amazed. The only thing I knew about music was the phonograph, you\nknow, so forth, you -- okay, so that was one thing. Then I saw them selling Frosties,\nyou know, that ice cream. So, he bought me one. I tasted it; 1t was so rich, so\nwonderful, so magnificent. In France the ice cream is sort of watery and -- an-and\nicy, but here was -- it\u2019s so rich. So they had a boy, wha -- we stayed with them for a\nweek, and this boy was a little fat, and we were thin. And I saw the amount of food\nthat they had, of milk and butter and cheese and -- and a [indecipherable] I said, no\nwonder he\u2019s fat.",
        "A: Not a word. And I had done something in preparation of coming here. I had\nwritten to the embassy in Paris, right, the French embassy -- I mean the American\nembassy and I\u2019d say we\u2019re going to immigrate, you know, an-and I wanted\nsomething cause in -- in Marmande there was nothing about learning English.\nThere was no book in the library, there was nothing. I had French books, you know,\nyeah. And so they sent me a book, right, nice they were, to learn about English. So\non my own, you know, I learned a few words in the little thing, but on my own I\ncouldn\u2019t do anything, I couldn\u2019t learn anything, I ma -- it was -- so that\u2019s the\nbeginning, right, so, where -- with -- with Friedel and -- and -- and so forth, so forth.\nThat fat little boy, he\u2019s a lawyer in New Jersey. Anyway, and he\u2019s one -- and he is\n122April 3, 2008\nthe one who finally, my other relatives that were looking for me, right, for this trip\nto Germany, he\u2019s the one who connected with me and found me, you know, cause\nhe -- they knew I was a lawyer, and he\u2019s a lawyer, so he said, I -- I can find him. He\ndid that. Anyway --",
        "A: I think we stayed just a week.",
        "A: And then -- then my mother wanted to cross the country, you know, and see the\ncountry, you know, and so for five days we went by train.",
        "A: On this train, again, you know, we meet all these wonderful people. And so we\nmet this guy and he befriended, you know, Herb and I. And, you know, he -- he\nwould talk to us. But on that train, something happened. So my mother sent us to the\n-- to the cart, you know, th -- to the car, the food car, whatever it\u2019s called. The\ncatering tru -- the catering --",
        "A: The dining car. And so he and I are in the dining car. Here it is the United States,\nthey bring us a menu and we\u2019re looking at this menu and we cannot understand\nanything, nothing. But there 1s one thing I understood, because my aunt and uncle\nApril 3, 2008\nwould send us a food parcel, you know, during the time that we were in France after\nthe -- you know, the war ended, they would send us these wonderful packages, you\nknow?",
        "A: And one of the things they had -- they shipped us, was corned beef. You know\n[indecipherable]. So I saw the word corn, so I pointed to the waiter, black guy, I\nremember, or maybe he was white, any -- whatever. And I pointed this word corn,\nokay? So I figure we\u2019 re --",
        "A: -- ordering corned beef.",
        "A: And that we knew we liked. So here comes the waiter with two plates and on\neach plate is an ear of corn. We look at this, what is this? This is a joke. In France\nthe only people who ate corn were pigs.",
        "A: It was raised strictly for feeding of pigs and geese, right, that you fatten up for\ntheir livers in the southwest of France.\n124April 3, 2008",
        "A: Right. An -- no, this is like an insult, you know. I mean, this 1s terrible, you\nunderstand? And obviously no harm was ever intended. But it\u2019s one of the moments,\nyou know, that somebody who doesn\u2019t speak the language and -- and -- and, you\nknow, when I meet people like that --",
        "A: -- you know, and they don\u2019t know, and they don\u2019t comprehend, you know. I say\nwell, I went through that --",
        "A: -- you know. Okay, I didn't know a word of English. I mean, blue and you know,\nokay, I knew the word corn. Okay, anyway, we went across the United States -- I\nmean across the United States by train and befriended this guy. When we came to\nOakland he was visiting his family, it was across the bay and he wanted to take us\nthere, but my mother wouldn\u2019t allow our -- cause she -- you know. So he took us out\nfor dinner anyway, in Oakland. And that my mother will allow, that\u2019s all, she\nwouldn\u2019t allow any more besides. Anyway, so in Oakland we lived with my uncle -",
        "A: -- until my mother got a job.\n125April 3, 2008",
        "A: And she got a job working for I. Magnin, which was the high culture department\nstore in San Francisco. And she became a -- a simst -- a seamstress there, and she\nworked there until she retired, you know. And they loved her and everybody who\nworked there loved her, cause she was a -- a ma -- I mean, really, everybody loved\nmy mother. She was gentle and soft-spoken, you know. She didn\u2019t parade her pain\nor her suffering, you know. She was just, I me -- I mean, a hundred percent good, in\nevery sense.",
        "A: So we were in Oakland, okay. So now my cousins, you know, who are very\nactive and graduated, you know, from the Oakland schools, you know, th-they tried\nto enroll us, okay. And so they got us enrolled in Oakland Technical High School.\nAnd the high school is trying to figure out what to do with us, cause we don\u2019t speak\nEnglish and there\u2019s nobody there, no tutors, nothing. The only person who speaks\nFrench in the whole school is the French teacher. Obviously she wasn\u2019t about to,\nyou know, be our full time teacher about anything. So what they decide to do, my\nbrother is two years younger than me, so what they did is they put us together --",
        "A: -- right, and me a year behind whatever is th-the required age and him a year\nahead. So they were -- okay, so we had somebody to talk to. So here we entered high\nApril 3, 2008\nschool at the same time, okay. He and I learned the English language within six\nmonths.",
        "A: And that 1s for sure.",
        "A: Within that time period I got a job working in the market, right in the par -- in a\ngrocery store, taking out groceries. We graduated -- I became the head yell leader of\nmy high school. I was on the board, of course, the student board. I was in other club,\nI was on the swimming team. We were both admitted to University of California at\nBerkeley. We both graduated and then I went to law school at the University of\nCalifornia Berkeley, Bolt Hall, which is about as -- as premier a law school as\nHarvard, right. At the time they were the premier law schools in the United States.\nMy brother became a CPA, he went to work for the IRS, then he got tired of that\nand he opened his practice and he owns now a Toyota agency that he bought from\none of his clients many, many years ago. He has got three sons, one 1s a par -- pair of\ntwins. They run that agency, they\u2019re about to enlarge it now, and so he 1s in the city\ncalled Novato, which is in Marin County, just a little ways between San Rafael\nand Petaluma, you know, very close to the wine country, Napa, okay. That\u2019s where\nhe lives and to my regret I had to move down south to L.A. because while I was in\n127\nApril 3, 2008\nlaw school I met my wife and there was my downfall, I stopped studying. But\nanyway, I made the grades anyway to graduate, and suddenly, you know, I had\nregular food, and regular living and I had a wonderful wife and everything was\ngreat.",
        "A: Yeah.",

I had four assistant, you know. I was one of the important\nguys in the school. All the -- all the -- all th-the --",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Other -- they all -- the only thing they knew about us was that we were\nimmigrants from France. And they treated us -- and they loved us, and they called\nme Frenchie, right. And then they -- then they -- once I involved in the school then\nthey didn't call me Frenchie any more, they called me Al, and everybody called me\nAl. Anyway, so we did not talk about the war experience. We didn\u2019t talk about what\nwe were, who we were, what happened to us, none of that. We had such a desire, a\ndrive, to mingle, to -- to be accepted, to conform, to -- all right, this 1s the 1950\u2019s,\nyou know. Th-The whole society, you know, was a society of conformists. We -- we\n129April 3, 2008\nall wanted, from 1950 -- I graduated in high school \u201953, we both in June of \u201953. This\nwas a time when this country was going through the -- the -- the immediate post-war\nexperience that wa -- suddenly the United States was th-the leader of the world. The\nmost productive, the richest country. Everything th -- everybody saw everything just\ngoing upw -- upward. I-I-It was only one direction for this country. It was u-upward.\nAnd we were the only foreigners in the -- in the whole high school of say more than\n3,000 students. There were four or five Jewish kids in the school. We were totally\naccepted, right, even though we were Jewish. And I -- I -- I had -- I had no problem\nbecoming the head yell leader, being elected. As I said, we were friends to the, you\nknow, elite students of the school, th-the -- the -- the students --",
        "A: Well, there it was different, okay. Incidentally, I want you to know, I sent a thank\nyou, you know, to the students of my -- of our s -- class, through the reunion, and\nthey published that thank you. And for the first time, they learned that we had been\nvictim of the Holocaust. They had no idea. And close friends, th-the head of the --\nthe -- the -- the reunion committee, I mean, she had a long talk with me on the\nphone. She couldn\u2019t believe it, because I thanked them, you know, for integrating us,\nallowing us -- this the front of my high school. This is the article that I wrote, on this\n130April 3, 2008\nbook. This was reproduced by a subsequent y-y-year, you know. Sharing memory, a\nspecial thank you to Tech, which was Oakland Tech, you know, that they recopy\nwith my -- with my thanks, I mean, you know, I was happy they did. And here is --\nwas the article an-and in -- in the news, you know, when we had this school reunion.\nThat\u2019s the first time they ever learned of this.",
        "A: No, no, no. My mother did not talk of that time. She --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: No. Of that time? No way. No, no. This was not a subject of discussion. That\u2019s\none of the things that it\u2019s difficult to understand maybe, but we wanted to survive,\nwe wanted to adapt.",
        "A: We wanted to become integrated in this land where we were -- were we belong.\nWe belong here. We didn't belong in Germany, we didn\u2019t belong in France, okay?",
        "A: Oh yeah. Oh, that absolutely. Oh, very, very Jewish. Right.\n131\nApril 3, 2008",
        "A: No. I was never angry, or regretted --",
        "A: -- as a child, I was never angry that a-a -- that I don\u2019t think ever, ever crossed my\nmind. I was -- always felt -- m-made to feel good about being a Jewish boy. I was --\nI-I had nothing but pride in being a Jew.",
        "A: I -- understand, I understand. Remember, my grandfather had his own\nsynagogue.",
        "A: My father was a very observant Jew. I mean he -- he -- he put on the Tefillin\nevery day. They kept kosher. They kept kosher in France during the occupation\nwhen we had nothing to eat. When there was no meat, you understand and the only\navailable meat was pork, they gave it to my brother and I, but not -- they wouldn\u2019t\neat it, okay. To the extent that she could -- my mother could keep kosher, you\nunderstand, in -- in this kind of horrible, you know, living conditions, you know,\ncertainly no -- no way you can, you know, maintain dietary laws, but anyway -- but\nas soon as we came to America, she did. And so did my Uncle Mike and Eda, they\n132April 3, 2008\nwere here -- they came here in our place, I mean -- no, I did not feel a sense of either\nshame or resentment about being a Jew, right. And th-that speaks to the -- to the -- to\nthe attitude and feelings that you have. Now, was I glad to be a target and a -- and a -\n- and a victim? No. I mean, obviously that made me very angry. And when I came to\nunderstand how the process had happened to my family and to me and to so forth, so\nforth, no, I became very angry.",
        "A: But -- and then I learned more and more, even about the complicity of the United\nStates and I call 1t what it is because it 1s a complixa -- complicity in the murder of\nsix million Jews, and I say it now, forever it should be remembered that they -- the\nGermans were complicit, the French were complicit, so was America. FDR was\ncomplicit. The State Department was complicit. And not -- they didn\u2019t stop their\ncomplicity with this monstrous period of crime. They didn\u2019t even redeem it by honor\nus, you understand, to -- to allow us to immigrate the United States before the worst\nquota imposed. I can\u2019t forgive that. I can\u2019t forget that. This can never be forgotten,\nall right. And so people -- when I , you know, speak of -- of the intolerance, you\nknow, oh -- and -- and the dysfunctional treatment of -- of millions of Mexicans and\nLatin Americans, of the Cubans and -- and the Vietnamese and th -- all these\nimmigrants from everywhere, why 1s it that Jews were treated differently? And it\n133April 3, 2008\nseems -- and you can take that view, that Jews always have to be the ones who have\nto pierce whatever it is. They are in front. They are the -- the target. And maybe\nthat\u2019s it, again. We are the chosen ones.",
        "A: And we\u2019re not only chosen for what we would want to be chosen for, but we\nwere. And I use the word describing what the United States did, and this comes\nfrom a person who loves his country, this is my dream. This is a place where no\nhuman being, right, could have -- could have expected more than I got out of it. This\nis a country I would kiss the ground. I kissed the ground when I landed in New\nYork, I kissed the ground on the [indecipherable]. I kissed the dra -- on my knees I\nkissed it. But I also kissed the ground of Sather Gate which is the entrance port of -\n- to the University of California, Berkeley. And every time I walk under that gate\nand every time I answer -- enter the grounds of that university, I thank God, I thank\nAmerica, | thank California for having allowed me and given me this unbelievable\nprivilege that I never, never would have had in France or Germany. I and my\nbrother were allowed with nothing, not even speaking the language, but at the end of\nthree years of residence in this country, we were admitted to the University of\nCalifornia at Berkeley, the most pra -- predominant public institution in the world,\nright, and certainly predominant against an -- a-at that time against any university in\n134April 3, 2008\nthe country. We were allowed to go there and to attend and to graduate. And he\nwould have, if he wanted to, he would have gone the di -- post-graduate school, as I\ndid. I went to Berkeley, to Bolt Hall. We were treated totally equally, fairly, justly.\nSo in every sense the United States gave to -- every opportunity to us. We owe\nevery bit of gratitude, you know, and thanks to the United States. I mean, look, we\ncame here with nothing, with hope. And this beautiful land, this beautiful country,\nright, gave us every opportunity. But we had to earn it. And we lived through three\nyears of high school without tutors, without aid, without assistance. We had to earn\nit. We earned it. And you know what, the rest of the way also we earned, without\nassistance, without help, right. This is a sink or swim society. Well, we survived.\nThank God. But it is only in this beautiful land, right, that gives opportunity to so\nmany people, and has, and does, you know. So I make a judgment on this country. I\ncondemn for what happened during the war and the immediate post-war period, and\nI praise this country for the period since then.\nEnd of Tape Four, Side B\n135April 3, 2008\nBeginning Tape Five, Side A",
        "A: It a -- and I would tell you in truth two things. I was a very caring and -- and\nloving father. I am still, but I had my faults. And part of my fault was that I grew up\nwith a certain amount of insecurity and that insecurity strived for security to\ncounterbalance. And as I evolve there was a mixture as a person, both of striving for\ncertain security in terms of at least economic security, and striving to deal with\nanger. Throughout my life I think that the experience of my childhood has affected\nmy personality in the sense that I am much more explosive or ex -- more explosive\nthan I would have been otherwise. I\u2019m easy to get upset and I am -- once I explode,\nwhich 1s -- doesn\u2019t happen often, cause I -- I control it, or 1t doesn\u2019t give me rise to\nanger. But when I do explode, I explode. And so I was a father who was loving and\ncaring an-and -- and -- and they could depend on. But if something went wrong or\nsomething was not right, they would hear about it plenty. And so in that sense my\nchildren have a certain amount of resentment to when I wasn\u2019t as kind or as\nconsiderate or as sensitive or as -- you know, I -- as I should have been. On the other\n136April 3, 2008\nhand, my children see -- at least my daughter does, because her two sons, our\ngrandsons live close to us and we see them often, once a week at least, and we take\nthem on vacation and so forth, so on. Then I\u2019m probably one of their best\ngrandfathers that there is. So as much as I, in my pursuit of s -- trying to strive for\nsecurity for them, once I achieved that, I also was the greatest -- oh -- th -- I -- what\nam I talking about with my [tape break]. Hold on, let\u2019s start over, cause I --",
        "A: All right. In any event, so the question you ask is did it affect me as I grew up\nand matured, and it definitely does. As a trial lawyer I also see it, you know, that I\ncan easily fire up and take intellectual insult or attack, you understand, by\nsomebody\u2019s -- I think -- and I do it -- once I am attacked in that way, I become very\nforaci -- ferocious, I become like the bulldog who -- at your ankle. And I will have\nthe last word. So, yes, in one sense, you understand, I have this anger. One thing that\nhas helped me, truly, is many years ago I started to write some of my history, some\nof my memories, and that became a -- like a psychological therapy for me, in many\nways. To recount for myself -- this is strictly, you know, me, some of these events,\nsome of these experiences, some of those feelings, you know, that I have. And part\nof retelling and reminding myself and crying along the story, I think has helped me\nto -- to reconcile myself with the injustices that happened to my family. And I will\n137April 3, 2008\nsay that I believe the reason I became a lawyer was to spend my life, to ensure to\nwhatever degree I had, in capability of opportunity, to make sure that other people\nare treated fairly, according to deeds, not according to religion or not according to\nfate or chance. And after 47 years of -- as a lawyer, continuous practice of law in the\nstate of California, I think I have done that with honor and -- so the aftereffect of\nthe experience of the war is I haven\u2019t gone out and -- and -- and get a gun and shoot\nthe Nazis or the Germans. I have not taken retaliation against them or others. I have\naccepted the fate that we had, never to forgive, never to forget. And that\u2019s an\nabsolute. And I remember having lunch with this nun who was the as -- who was the\nassistant of the Cardinal Mahoney, the guy who is the Cardinal of all of southern\nCalifornia, one of the preeminent Cardinals in this country, and they had selected\nme for their -- I was the poster child for the 2000 -- the year 2000 of the\nreunification, or the year redemption between the Catholics and the Jews. And they\nhad one edition that was devoted, and I was the centerfold story, in full color, in full\neverything. And a -- after it was done, she came and visited me in my office and we\nwent to lunch together, and I expressed some of this feeling of my anger. My anger\nat what Pope Pius 12\" didn\u2019t do. What the Catholic archdi -- hierarchy did not do.\nThe choices they made, and other Catholics eminence and nuns and -- and\n[indecipherable] you know. Sheltered and hid, saved Jews and the others did the\n138April 3, 2008\nopposite. And I told her about these, you know, these mixed feelings. And she says -\n- and I said never to forgive, never to forget. She said, of course you should never\nforget. But she says, for your own soul, for yourself, you should forgive. So I have\nto say that between my own therapy in writing about it and talking about it and\nmyself and -- and so forth, and the message that she gave to me, somehow I matured\nand so I could bring myself to go back and accept the invitation of the state I was\nborn, the city where I was born, to visit. And I did it. I was very curious to see where\nI was born, where I come from, you know, this part of my trip, you know, to get my\nroots. And I got it and I was very happy. I had no resentment, on the contrary. The\nmayor was a perfect English speaking person, who had married an English girl. All\nthe people there spoke English perfectly.",
        "A: No, not at all. No, no, no, no, I didn't feel German at all. This was my birthplace,\nI am honored that I was born there, in a university town that my grandfather\nselected. It\u2019s a beautiful town, I just went to my granddaughter\u2019s Bat Mitzvah, and\namong the guests there 1s her -- h-her -- one of her uncles, and he works for the\nPentagon, you know, in a secret, secret job. And he s-said he didn't know where I\nwas born, and I told him, you know, cause I showed him this book, they all wanted\nto see it. So he said, Kiel, I was in Kiel. You know, as part of the Pentagon, the -- he\nApril 3, 2008\nvisited, and he was th -- you know, toured everywhere and he was taken\neverywhere. He says -- he said to me, that\u2019s a beautiful city. I said yeah. And it\u2019s a\nuniversity city. I said yeah. You know, anyway, I am amazed that many other\nsurvivors of the Holocaust that I have met over this period of my life survive what\nhappened to them, and instead of quitting, instead of crying, instead of feeling sorry\nfor themselves, they picked up, right, and said I\u2019m going forward, I\u2019m gonna live, I\nhave to live. Right. They, you know, perished, you know, not by choice but by the\nhands of criminals and monsters. You know, whether they were the complicit one or\nthe active one, but I\u2019m going to live. And so I met a number of them, including one\nwho survived Auschwitz in the -- in a -- that Nazi symbol that was carved on his\nforehead, and he became one of the early establisher in Australia of the -- the mini-\nshopping malls. A very rich guy. And many others. They survived. They -- they\nsomehow adjusted, you know, and they became husbands and fathers and uncles and\n-- and grandfathers. I think I have the best of all relationship with my grandsons. My\nchildren love me and so forth, but they remember times when I was not too kind to\nthem, right, when I got angry.",

Okay, cause she was not raised in a Jewish -- she comes\nfrom Jewish parents, but they were not active, religious Jews. They were Jews, yes,\nbut not observant Jews. So she complies with my requirement, the minimum\nrequirement. We are Conservative Jews, we go synagogue, right, twice or three\ntimes a year, and our children are Bar Mitzvah and Bat Mitzvah, so are my\ngrandchildren. We are proud to be Jews, we are educated on what Judaism is about\nand our history and our heritage. At least I profoundly honor our people. I\nprofoundly proclaim, you know, our history.

The years of pain and suffering that she endured, you\nknow. That, you understand, I -- I -- I can never forgive what they did to her, or\nwhat they did to him.

        "A: No, no. Okay, let me put this in -- in the context. I think that I grew up and\ndeveloped very normally in the sense that --",
        "A: Well, 1-1-1-1 -- le -- let me explain something. When I say normally, I say it in the\n-- in the context that all I overcame, whatever disadvantages, pain and suffering I\nwent through; for example, the fact that I was not educated for many years, right?\nFor some reason, whatever happened, in high school I applied myself to the extent\nnecessary to be able to get grades to get into Berkeley. Okay, it came. And in\nBerkeley I became very enthusiastic about the discovery of real education, and I\nbecame in love with learning, I became in love with the libraries, I -- I became -- I --\nthe best time I have is when I go to law library. You know, I -- I love it. But Iam an\nextrovert, you know, I\u2019m out there, you know. And I\u2019m not in pain from the\nexperience, and yet I am. So I am in this balance, you understand, but I am holding\nit in equilibrium. And it\u2019s only certain time when I get angry and pushed, you know,\n144April 3, 2008\nor I allow myself to, that I lose that equilibrium. But even if I do, once I express it,\nit\u2019s out of me, right, that\u2019s one of the things, the attributes of my personality. That\nonce I let out -- I have to let things out. I\u2019m not an introvert, I\u2019m an extrovert, and so\nonce I let it out, it\u2019s gone. I\u2019m past whatever, you know, the moment is. So yes, I am\nsusceptible to get attacked or angry, and to become defensive, I think faster than\nmost people. I react trigger-like, you understand, to certain attacks. More ferociously\nthan most people, and most trial lawyers. I am not an easy adversary. If you attack --\nas long as you\u2019re civil and professional, hallelujah, [indecipherable]. I may even\nbecome meek in the process. But once you attack, psshht.",

        "A: Epitomize, you understand, for Israel, for the Jews, you know. Here is a living\nsymbol of all our hate and anger and need for revenge, okay. I -- I fully shared\nwhatever was going on. I full shared everything Israel did. I commend them, I\npraise them, they are heroes to the world. In the manner that they did it, in the\n145April 3, 2008\nfairness and justice that was handed to the man, right, who again, with the use and\nabuse of the law, right, who had ordered the arrest, the incarceration, the liquidation\nof six million Jews. He, right, who did all that, was accorded just the opposite. Every\ncourtesy, every legal rights, every right to defense, everything. So I am, on that\nsense, I felt justice was done. Just as much he denied justice to my father. But to him\njustice was done. So I -- you know, I don\u2019t -- I know -- no, thank God they -- they\nfound him, they caught him, they tried him, they -- they gave him every chance and\nthe guy confessed, with his damn set of excuses. You know, it\u2019s the same with the\nGermans today. When I was invited to Kiel with my cousins and I -- we were the\nguests of honor of Kiel [indecipherable] for seven or eight days, the time the -- the\ntime that they invite thousands, I believe, of people who man different -- the ships,\nwhat are they called? With the -- sailboats, they come to regatta in -- in Kiel. Kiel is\nthe, you know, so we were there during the whole week, the guest of honor. We\nwere taken to every function, to meet everybody. And -- okay. When we had the\nreception there with the mayor and we had dinner with him, we had several things\nwith him, and all -- all the other. So I was asked to, like my cousin, you know, we all\nwere invited to write in the book, the city. There\u2019s pictures of me writing. When I\nwas done writing, both good and bad, the mayor turned to me and he says, I want to\ngive you something. And he went and got out of a drawer, a picture. And the picture\n146April 3, 2008\nis part of the aftermath of the war to the city of Kiel, and it shows, you know, a very\n-- | have a copy I have included here -- a destroyed city during the winter in a very\nheavy snow, and you\u2019ve got a bunch of people who are walking on foot 1n this\ndesolate, terrible, abysmal area of the remains of the city of Kiel. Well, of course,\nthe whole city was not destroyed by the British and the American bombers. The\naccess to the port were -- the property of my grandfather it was. But he gave me that\nso that I would get the other side of the coin, to which I\u2019m very sensitive. Well, we\nhad dinner one night, he and I an-and my cousin. I asked him, wh-why did you\npeople invite us? And he says, because when we have done it in the past, the\ngoodwill that happened paid for whatever happened on both sides. But when we\nwent, the newspaper reported our visit and I -- again, I did not read the whole thing,\nbut the Christian couple who were responsible for bringing attention to us and\ngetting the city and the state to invite us and to give us what I could say is a hundred\nand five percent, 10 percent, you know, anything that you could expect. I mean, I wa\n-- it was magnificent. We had interpreter. The -- the Jewish historian Kristina\nGoldberg who is a professor there interviewed us and she wrote a whole thesis on it.\nShe had written the history of our family, which is recorded in these books, right,\nmy grandfather and -- and -- and the rest of us are all part of -- of -- you know, thesis\nand -- and -- and research that she did. But the newspaper wrote an article that the\n147April 3, 2008\nChristian couple, right, begrudge the expenditure by the city and the state for such a\nlavish state for us. So, you know, the Jewish people are very honored in the sense\nthat we have survived by our own means and our own ability to survive. Mentally,\nemotionally, economically, my family did not ask for money --",
        "A: Reparation. France paid her some money. We received my inheritance of my\ngrandparents, you know, I mean the property was evaluated 1950 or \u201951. The seven\nof us all received the then appraised value of the land. That land is one of the most\nexpensive, income producing land in the city of Kiel. Today the stadium was being\nrebuilt, you know, on that land. Of course, other land too, because it\u2019s very big and\nour property wasn\u2019t that big. And it is a place in Kiel, which is 1n the northern part\nof Germany, it\u2019s very cold. And all of the sports activity, conventions, or --\neverything of income producing to the city occurs in that -- in that plaza. So we\nreceived an appraised value of 1950, of raw land. Thirty years later, 40 years later,\nas a lawyer I wanted to know. I wasn\u2019t interested then of the money, in fact, I hated\nthem. I don\u2019t hate them more, you know, those who live in Germany today. I hate\nthose who -- who sit back, committed all these crimes, yeah, I hated them. But not\nthese that are here. And I ask because my cousins wanted to know, aren\u2019t we entitled\nto a proper inheritance, given the value of our property that was taken from us? And\n148April 3, 2008\nI asked attorneys for a Jewish, so forth, t-to advise me as to whether not we had\nrights. And I asked through the Christian couple for a set of lawyers in Kiel. I was\nwilling to pay whatever it costs. And I had these meetings and I had these reviews\nand they told me to -- you waited too long. The Statute of Limitation barred any --\nbut we did inherit, so -- not much, but it helped to pay for our education.\nEnd of Tape Five, Side A\nBeginning Tape Five, Side B",
        "A: Okay, I -- I wanted to add something. I have collected in these 20 years, with\nsome help, with this Christian couple and also some luck, the confirmation of the\nevents that I have related. Everything I have related in terms of factual event is\nconfirmed by documents, records that I\u2019ve collected and I\u2019m sure others, by French\nhistorian, by German historian, by the work of -- the records of the German\ngovernment, of the French government. And I want at least the future to understand\nthat what I have stated 1s the truth. Part of that is in this collection of documents and\ncopies of confirmation by these historians and the acts of the state of Germany and\nthe Republic of France.\nApril 3, 2008",
        "A: Well, I\u2019m referring to not one, I\u2019m referring to a number.",
        "A: The book that I am referring to, which is my collection that I put together so far,\nwhich 1s a work in progress, I have entitled, \u201cHolocaust documentation to the\nsuffering of the Lakritz - Weber family, 1934 to 1945.\u201d On the cover is a page of\nmy family, my father, my mother, my brother and I on the beach in the city of Kiel,\nGermany when I was a little over two years old and my brother was a -- a few\nmonths old. I have very few pictures of my family because my mother and my father\nwere afraid that when they would be searched, arrested, that their identity as Jews\nwould be discovered, well -- in this collection that I\u2019m going to leave with the\nHolocaust Museum, I intend to supplement it by an index of each page and each\ndocument and each photograph and each so forth. But I do want to say this, that the\ncover of the book, some of the books made by the city of Kiel, and the state that I\nwas born in, Germany, recites and refers and relates the history of my family, my\ngrandfather in particular. The -- Kristina Goldberg is a -- who is a professor over\nthere outside of Kiel, or in Kiel, or by the other town, I\u2019ve forgotten which, but\nanyway, it\u2019s written about, incented about our family and Kiel and what happened to\nus. She interviewed also after she did it, then she found out we were coming. So she,\n150April 3, 2008\nwith the permission of the city and the state went along with us, interviewed us and\nthen she wrote another --",
        "A: Kiel we went -- was it 2001?",
        "A: I went back to France, I mean, on the thank you trip to the nuns and to the Ros\nfamily and to the Guyaux family and the Rozinsky family. I went to thank them. I\nmade a -- a decision to do it. The Catholic archdiocese of southern California\nhelped me to locate this -- these -- these nuns, this order of -- turned out to be the\norder where Bernadette was a member, and they utilized the Catholic archives in\nFrance and elsewhere. Incidentally, that congregation was th-the congregation of\nnuns in La Soeur de la Charit\u00e9 [speaks French]. Well, I\u2019m sure nobody will\ntranslate that properly. Anyway, they have acknowledged my -- my -- my being\nhidden by them. They have included me in their -- in their archive. Now, everything\nI have said, all right, the arrest and -- and detention and death of my father is\nrecorded by the French government. It is recorded by the German government. It 1s\nattested to by [indecipherable] in his research, including the very shipment that he\nwas in, and his death, ultimate death in -- in Majdanek, by Lublin. The fact that I\nrecited, that I was honored by the Catholic archdiocese to be their poster child, right,\n151\nApril 3, 2008\nis a recorded event. It was published in their distributed publication called, \u201cThe\nTidings\u201d, and this was published in January 2001, because of the second Vatican\nand because of Pope pi -- Pope Pius -- John Paul th-the -- the -- the second. I have\nincluded m-many of the pages of the -- the 1 -- the historical research done by the\nFrench historian that I referred to in -- of the Jews of ther -- Lot-et-Garonne, which\nconfirms that what happened to my parents an-and to me. The German state where I\nwas born, not only did acknowledge what happened to us, but they also\nacknowledge the -- the death of my grandfather, my paternal grandfather and the --\nthe -- the last of my uncles, where they were sent and they were killed, at Riga. And\nthe memorial is there, they are listed 1-in the deaths of that camp, right, and I was\nsent all that documentation and th-the -- the efforts that they -- they are -- the city of\nKiel is one of the sponsor of that particular monument and maintenance, in\nperpetuity they told me. As I said, the city of Kiel, at my request created finally, a\nmemorial to the Jews which basically I have to say that all of these efforts,\nthroughout, that what\u2019s happened in Kiel has centered basically on my family,\nbecause the museum in Kiel is center -- as I said, of -- of memorial and photos and\nso forth, which ha-has my -- my cousins, my family in it. So, I have to say that my\nfamily is honored. It\u2019s sad to have that as an inheritance, but we don\u2019t feel sorry for\nourselves. We move forward, we prevail, all right. We -- we meet the challenges,\n152April 3, 2008\nand | -- I say that not as as -- matter of speech, but this is a matter of absolute fact.\nSo in what you ask, you know, the question of how did you emotionally, as I\nunderstand, I mean, cope with different thing? Well, I'll give you the proof. The\nproof of the pudding is what is the bottom of the balance sheet, right. What is it that\nyou did with your life? What is it that your brother did? What is it your mother did?\nWell, Pll tell you what my mother did. She sacrificed everything for her two sons.\nShe worked like hell. Every day she would travel, you understand, by the bus, you\nknow, from Oakland to San Francisco. Every day of her life, right, until she\nretired. Every day she worked to earn enough money, right, so we could go to\nschool, you know? Not depend on -- on charity, on poverty, or anything, you know.\nWe -- she did it. Now sure, we had a little bit of help from my inheritance, we had a\nlittle help that was given to her 1n-in -- in some reparation, you know, by the\nGerman government. Some by a pension of France, right, cause they were ab-\nabsolutely guilty of complicity, you know, to the murder of my father. I mean, that\u2019s\nabsolute. I condemn them as total accomplices, okay. The fact that my father\u2019s name\nis on the memorial of the dead in my town, right, the only Jew that is so honored,\nyou know, 1-1s -- 1s a -- 1s -- 1s a proof of the fact that some French people\nrecognized the enormity of their complicity. But to some degree, we have to\nunderstand, you know, they had limited choices. They could only act at the peril of\n153April 3, 2008\ntheir own life, and they had to depend on everybody else. So, you know, in this\nwhole ballgame, right, who are the only real, real monster? Of course, it\u2019s the\nGerman. This educated, right, most advanced culture of all became induced and\nseduced by these -- these -- these monsters. So they\u2019re all accomplices, they\u2019re all\nmurderers. Under the laws the way we have it in the United States, if you are an\naccomplice before the fact or after the fact to a murder, you are guilty of murder.\nThey are guilty of murder, period. All of them. That\u2019s it. Now, again, the -- the -- the\nimportance of my statement here is that there is balance. And those who survived,\nsome of them have survived that they can see, still see the evil and the dark of what\nhappened, and yet live a beautiful life, without forgiving, without forgetting. I will\nnever forget the murderers of my father. Never forget the pain and suffering they\ninflicted on my mother. And it would be a dishonor to me or anybody who lived\nthrough what I lived through, not to honor their mother and father, or their relatives,\nright, for their horrible, horrible death, you know. And that is the legacy. And I ask\nmyself, why was I allowed to live? You know, why was I spared? Well, I believe\nthis is one of the reasons. This collection of work, my testimony here, right. I didn\u2019t\ngive it earlier because I didn\u2019t have all the documents that I wanted, right. Now I\nhave it. Now I give it, and I give my judgments, too. I answer your inquiry, but I\u2019m\nwilling to give it to you in a sense of saying I condemn what should be condemned.\n154April 3, 2008\nOkay, there is one other point that I need to make. The United States of America,\nto its credit, has learned from the serious, horrible injustices that were done to the\nJews of Europe. And in its greatness and kindness and generosity, as was true in the\npast but not to the Jew, they became very generous to others. And that 1s a credit,\nbecause in the United States, after they recognized what they had done wrong or\nbeen complicit with, they were among the first, if not the first to recognize the state\nof Israel. They are, and stood, often alone between 1945 and -- and now -- or \u00b048, to\nbe more correct, and now, to stand and protect Israel, provide them arms and money\nand -- and support, politi -- many, many, many time the lone country, the lone voice.\nMany, many time France and England, right, who should have supported, right,\nIsrael, they voted the other way or they remained silent. The United States of\nAmerica, to its great credit, also grew up and learned. And the fact that we today\neven consider that a black could be president of the United States, or a woman\nbecome president of the United States finally, I think in great part is the lessons that\nwere learned by the United States to the wrongs that they committed to the Jews. So\nthe generosity of this country, and it is a generous country, I think in part, is a debt\nof repayment to what they didn\u2019t do to the Jews. But that doesn\u2019t diminish my love\nfor this country.\n155\nApril 3, 2008",
