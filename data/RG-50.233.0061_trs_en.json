His parents had many\nsiblings, and only one aunt survived. The family was Orthodox but not as strict as the older\nrelatives who were Hasids. The family spoke Yiddish at home and Polish with visitors. His\nfather acted quickly for the few problems they had with anti-Semitism. The only prohibition was\n, against higher education. He was close to his great-grandparents who had a bakery. Kishel",
        "completed elementary school at age 14 and attended trade school in Warsaw for six months.\nThen he worked in the family business and saw his friends in the evening, including a girl friend.\nIn the summer he attended camp with other teenagers. His grandmother ran a newspaper kiosk.\nSome of the family emigrated to Argentina, France, and Israel (were Zionists). He went to the\nRussian border for a short time and soon after he returned, the Germans occupied the town.\nThey ordered a Judenrat be formed, and Kishel\u2019s father was one of the 10 men chosen.\nWherever Jews lived was an open ghetto. They learned that Warsaw was worse, so they got\npermission to bring some of their former residents back to Kaluszyn. Kishel was on the sanitary\ncommittee to prevent typhus, but he caught it once. He and his brother got a passport to live on\nthe Aryan side of Warsaw. Soon they moved in with their cousins in the ghetto and were caught\nup with a deportation on a cattle car to Treblinka. They succeeded in jumping out of the train\nand returning to their cousins. When the Germans came, they hid in a basement bunker that\nexited into the sewers. Soon the Germans gassed the bunker, and they were deported to\nMajdanek. Kishel went into the hospital when he got sick and recuperated; and soon was\ndeported to Auschwitz where he remained for two years, until the war ended. He was beaten\nnumerous times, was transferred to various subcamps, including the coal mines, and finally on\nJanuary 18, 1945 was evacuated. He was on the road until May 8\" when he was liberated and\nreturned to Kaluszyn. He shows pictures of his relatives and indicates a Yizkor book was written\nof Kaluszyn. He came to the United States in 1948, and around January 9, 1949 he married a\nPolish woman who emigrated to Costa Rica. They have two daughters and reside in Queens. He\nwas in the export business with his brother until they retired in 1988. He believes that his father\nhelped him survive.\nMichael Kishel: My name is Michael Kishel. I was born Kisielnicki. At my bris I was",

        "kilometers east of Warsaw, on the way to Brest Litovsk (Brest, Brest",
        "Litowsk) (6). The first years when I was a young boy I was attending\nCheder, and later I was attending Beta Safer, which was a Hebrew school\nonly to learn Hebrew and public school to the seventh grade. My family\nconsisted of parents, my father, Mojsze (Moishe, Moshe, Majsze); my\nmother, Raizel; my brother, Abram and my sister, Chaie (Chai) Sura. We\nhad lived very well, and in the late 1920\u2019s or early 1930\u2019s my father had a\nbusiness of retail and wholesale groceries. In the early 30\u2019s my father got\nto make a gasoline station, as the town that we lived in was a main road\nfrom Warsaw to the east, which was very heavy in traffic. He also made a\nrestaurant that was open 24 hours a day, practically 365 days a year. Of\ncourse we only had closed on major holidays. Saturdays we closed the\nfront, but things were done in the back. We also had a business in\nwholesale kosher products, such as petroleum, nafta, coal, rice, sugar, salt,\nand many products that had to be brought in from Warsaw to sell to the\nlocal grocery stores. We were well off in many ways. (23-25) no voice.\nMy father was born also in Kaluszyn, and I believe it was in 1895, and my\nmother born in 1904 in Kaluszyn. They were young people when they got\nmarried. My mother was 17 or 18 years old.",
        "Interviewer: Could you tell me a little bit about your people, your parents\u2019 family. Did\nyour father have a lot of siblings?",
        "Michael Kishel: My father\u2019s family consisted of, there were two brothers and two sisters.\nOne sister immigrated to Argentina in the 20\u2019s, and another sister\nimmigrated to France, also in the 20\u2019s; and he also had a brother who also\nlived in Poland. And my father\u2019s brother had a family, consisted of him\nand his wife, and they had 9 children; and they all perished. My mother\nhad, there were four sisters and two brothers. One sister lives now in\nIsrael, that she is the only one that remains. One sister died in Russia after\nshe run away from the Germans in 1939; and one sister and my mother\ndied in the Holocaust in September 1942, when they were taken to\nTreblinka.",
        "Interviewer: What did your father\u2019s father do? Was he also in business?",
        "Michael Kishel: I don\u2019t remember what my father\u2019s father did, cause he died in the 20\u2019s,\nand I don\u2019t recall exactly what he was doing. I believe he was dealing in\nproduce they brought in from Kaluszyn to Warsaw during market days,",
        "| and from there he brought back merchandise for stores that ordered certain\nmerchandise.",
        "Interviewer: So he was kind of a wholesaler?",
        "Michael Kishel: Sometimes it would be called like a supplier of things, whatever someone\nneeded. My mother\u2019s father, I was told, used to work for someone that\nlived in the forest, like the princes or very rich gentiles, and they used to\nsell their woods and he used to be, I suppose, their accountant, or\nsomething like that, in that respect. My grandfather died at an early age.",
        "Interviewer: What kind of education did your parents have?",
        "Michael Kishel: My mother had an education; she was attending during the First World\nWar in the Russian schools and of course Jewish education. My father\nonly had a Jewish education.",
        "Interviewer: Do you know what age he was when he went to school?",
        "Michael Kishel: No, this I don\u2019t know. I do not know when my father left school or my\nmother. But I do know that they could go along with knowledge of many,\nmany different things.",
        "Interviewer: What languages did you speak in the household?",
        "Michael Kishel: In the household, we spoke mainly Yiddish. Occasionally when there are\npeople, gentiles, that came to visit us, we spoke Polish.",
        "Interviewer: Did your parents ever discuss the circumstances of their meeting?",
        "Michael Kishel: I believe my parents did not discuss with us the circumstances of their\nmeeting, but we know that my mother wanted to marry my father because",
        "| he was very industrious, although the family of my mother was more\nprominent than my father\u2019s.",
        "Interviewer: You think they just met through friends?",
        "Michael Kishel: No, they did not meet by friends, they were about the same age, although\nit was a difference of about five years, but when it comes to marry, this 1s\nthe ages that you marry, between four to six, seven years apart.",
        "Interviewer: And did you always live in the same house as a child?",
        "Michael Kishel: As a child I remember until 1929 or 30, we lived in an apartment, which\nwas a one-bedroom apartment; and we were three children, which was a\nlittle too tight in today\u2019s standards. But in those years, the more the\nmerrier. There was no such thing as there is no space; you cannot sleep\nhere or sleep there. There was no such thing. And if somebody came to\nvisit, there was always a place to find for them. And later on when we had\nbusiness in the late 20\u2019s, there was a house that my father rented in the",
        "beginning, which later on we bought. Was on a lot that you consider here\n, like 75\u2019 by 200\u201d in the length, or maybe 60\u2019 wide and about 200\u201d long.\nAnd there was the house that we lived, and the house had a store, and the\nback of the store we had the living quarters. We also had an attic which a\ntenant lived there before, and then because we needed the apartment we\npaid them to move out and we occupied that apartment also. Because of\nthe space that we needed more, my family rented an apartment which we\n| used only for a bedroom, and about two houses away, which it was only\nabout 10 steps away. The back of the lot was a warehouse. Of course, all\nthe things that was necessary for the business, and there was\u2014sometimes\nthere was a lot of space we used to plant fruits, like onions or potatoes or\nstrawberries or whatever my mother or the people that worked for us liked\n| to do for us; because we always had people helping us out in many, many\nways.\nInterviewer: Non-Jewish people?\nMichael Kishel: That\u2019s right. I don\u2019t want to mention it over there.\nInterviewer: So, you remember growing up in this environment?\nMichael Kishel: Yes.\nInterviewer: What kind of a street or neighborhood was it?\n: Michael Kishel: Well, it was \u2014 the neighborhood, our town was a town of a population of\n| about 10,000, and we had about 75, 80 percent Jewish. Maybe not exactly\n75, but it was about 65 percent Jewish. And that I remember for many,\nmany years. The town lived from mainly from different trades. There\nwere a lot of people that had a trade making prayer shawls, Tallisim.\nThere were also a lot of people that made sheepskin coats. There were a\nfew people that dealt in skin-making leather, like tannery. And, of course,\nshoemakers and tailors were abundant. And the majority of it, the rest,\nwere mostly, I would say about 30 percent of the people who did have\nbusinesses, businesses of textile, like selling materials for suits. There was\nno such thing as ready-made suits here. There were tailors that made\nready-made suits, but they were making them for out-of-town, for business\npeople in Warsaw or other ones. But if you wanted to have a suit, you\nwent to the store to buy three yards or three meters of material, and give it\nto a tailor who made it for you. I remember that we always had two suits a\nyear, for Passover and for High Holidays. After that year, the following\nyear, my mother gave the suits away to relatives who were less fortunate,\nand if they were still good in the same condition, they wore it that way,",
        "and if not, they turned it over on the other side, the material, and remade it\n, , so it looked like new. The same thing was with shoes and other things.",
        "Interviewer: How would you describe the relation between the Jewish families and the\nnon-Jewish? Were they Catholic?",
        "Michael Kishel: The Gentiles in our town were 99 percent Catholics. The relations\nbetween the Gentiles and the Jews, officially were supposedly good. We\nparticularly had no problem, because all the Gentiles that used to come\naround had respect for my father. And especially the precinct, the police,\nwere practically stationed in our house because it was a station that the\ntrucks and buses that used to pass by our town made a stopover, taking\ngas, filling with gas, and all the passengers came into our restaurant to eat,\nand for this it was very lively in our area. And the town was\u2014every\nevening young people used to stroll along the street, especially the main\nstreet, it was called Warsaw Street, or Warszawa (Warszawska) (132,\nPolish name of street). And especially when it came Friday night and\nSaturday night, you could not pass a certain area without bumping into\none another because they were walking four or five in the width. And old\nfriends and young people and everybody was very happy. Of course, there\nwere occasionally were anti-Semitic slogans, not to buy from Jews,\nbecause this came from other places that instigated against Jews and, of\ncourse, it dropped off among other populations or areas, and the same\nthing dropped off on Jews in our area.",
        "Interviewer: So there were local fascists, youths?",
        "Michael Kishel: Yes, there were fascists, but officially they did not come up to say exactly\nwhat they are. But in a group they were barking. But many times the\nGentiles had very much respect for my family, for my father, and there\nwas no hesitation that if someone came into our house and said something\nagainst the Jews, that my father could take him by his neck and throw him\nout with a kick in the back, in the rear end, and it was o.k.",
        "Interviewer: And, as the decade of the 30\u2019s progressed, did things get tougher?",
        "Michael Kishel: Well, it started to get a little tougher after Hitler came to power, and it was\na lot of writings about how he was treating the Jews. And, of course, there\nwas a Polish anti-Semitic party, it was called, NDEC (?), the National\nPolish Party. I don\u2019t remember exactly what they are called, but there\nwere a few of them. And they had their newspapers, and they used to\nwrite many articles about how bad the Jews are; and what the Jews did bad\nto Poland, and what they do to this and what they do to that. And, of",
        "course, many Poles did not have anything, or did not have any incentives\nto go out and work and better themselves; only saw that the Jews take\neverything away and the Jews have everything. And this made anti-\nSemitism a little more.",
        "Interviewer: So there were more incidents?",
        "Michael Kishel: Actually, there were no incidents. The only incident that was once was in\nthe county, I don\u2019t remember exactly if there was someone that killed\nsomeone in the county, or if it was at a time when a German ambassador\nor counselor was killed in Paris. That person that killed him was from\nMinsk-Mazowiecki (165 \u2014 name of town). I don\u2019t remember exactly if\nthis was the case, but there was some incident in Minsk-Mazowiecki and,\nof course, did not do much good. But people still lived, and there was no\nother choice to do but you had to live with them, to make the best you can.",
        "Interviewer: But your freedom of movement or opportunity was restricted?",
        "Michael Kishel: No. Freedom of movement was not restricted, and of course, there was\nrestriction on higher education in schools. There was no higher education\nin our town. Our town was only public school up to the seventh grade.",
        "Interviewer: Tell me again what your schooling was?",
        "Michael Kishel: My schooling was that when I was a boy, let\u2019s say 4 or 5 years old, the",
        "| first thing he would attend was a Cheder. I remember during my time of\nJewish education I went to four different rabbis; from the one that started\nwith small children and bigger children and so on and do forth. And then\nwhen I was about 11 or 12 years old I was attending a school which taught\nonly Hebrew, because my father was a Zionist, and he wanted us to know\nHebrew. So we went, and that day, 11, 12 and 13, I was going to that\nHebrew school in the morning, let\u2019s say from 9:00 to 12:00; from 1:00 to\n6:00 I went to public school; and from 7:00 to 8:00 or 7:00 to 9:00, a rabbi\ncame to the house to finish my religious education. So for a time we were\nbusy educating ourselves.",
        "Interviewer: And you were Bar Mitzvah when you were 13?",
        "Michael Kishel: - And I was Bar Mitzvah when I was 13.",
        ", Interviewer: What was the ceremony like?\nMichael Kishel: Well, the Bar Mitzvah ceremony was new to me, when I came to the\nUnited States. There was no such thing as elaborate Bar Mitzvahs that",
        "they have here that was there. There was only at a time when I was Bar\nMitzvah came on a Saturday, I was given an Aliyah and I was reading\nfrom the Torah\u2014I don\u2019t remember exactly what I read, the part that I was\nsupposed to, but after that there was a big Kiddush in the synagogue and a\nlot of friends came to the house and we had a separate party in the house.",
        "Interviewer: But were you, -----? little kid put on a pedestal?",

        "her. She also made boxes for Tefillin. She died in 1934 at the age over\n100. I was told a story here in the States when I came in 1947, through\nher son, that her son run away from Kaluszyn as a young boy, maybe 16\nor 17 years old. He came to America; his name was Wallis (?) Gilbert and\nhe told... When he contacted after the war to some Kaluszyn landsmans, |\nwas told by some landsmans that went away before First World War or\nright after the First World War that when her son run away to the United\nStates, run away from home, she did not know where he is, and she almost\nforgot him.

The owner of this was losing\nmoney, and a man that used to be the conductor of the train bought\nhimself a horse; and he was riding with the horse on the rails with that\ntrain to Mrozy. But it did not do good enough because he didn\u2019t have\nenough money to feed the horse; so he stopped going. So that kiosk was\ntransferred to another part of town, and she had that kiosk in the town.\nThen we had to bring in the newspapers from Mrozy to Kaluszyn with the\nregular drivers, with the regular carriage, horse and carriage that was\nrunning. But because there was competition, there was another man that\nhad a kiosk; we as grandchildren, my brother or I, or my grandmother\u2019s",

Who brings faster the\nnewspapers is able to sell it to those who are interested to read. Because\nnot everybody wants to buy a paper. There was\u2014if one bought a paper,\nhe used to give it to all his neighbors to read it. Or two of them bought the",

        "Interviewer: So when\u2014\u2014please talk about what happened after Germany invaded\nPoland.",
        "Michael Kishel: After Germany invaded Poland on September 1, 1939, we were under the\nbelief, as we were told by the Polish government, that the war will not take\nlong; that the German armaments are made out of wood and cardboard\nthings, and things will fall apart, and they will not last long. But soon\nafterwards, maybe two or three days in the war, a plane passed by, and we\nall thought that this is a friendly plane because it came in so low. What it\ndid, it just threw down a little bomb in our town; as there was a line in\nfront of a bakery to buy bread, and a lot of people got killed. After this\nhad happened, we realized that all the propaganda that we were taught\nabout before is not as true as it seems to be. Being that we had trucks and\nsome other people and friends of our family had trucks, we decided that\nwe\u2019 ll take two trucks and go away to the east, towards the Russia. In the\nmeantime things will slow down and stabilize itself. The reason why we\nwent away is because the older people knew from the First World War\nthat when Germans come in, the first thing they do is they take the men;\nthe young men and the older men to work, and they tell them to work on\nthe roads and\u2014forced labor to work for them. Being that Hitler came to\npower, the fright was a little bit more than before. So everyone said for\nthe young people to move away.",
        "Interviewer: But in 1938, after Kristallnacht in Germany, nothing happened at that\ntime?",
        "Michael Kishel: After 1938, we were only frightened but we did not think that this thing\nwould come up. Because when Hitler went to war with Poland, was only\nthat he wanted to have the corridor to go through to Danzig, to take away\nthat right and so on. But nobody knew that this is going to come so far.\nLater on, everything\u2014his propaganda was that the Poles want to attack\nhim, and so on. But when the war came, all was towards how to escape\nfrom Hitler that they\u2019re coming in. Because their radio and the news came\nin that the Germans have entered Poland, and they are pushing in certain\nareas into the country more and more. So my father and his friends took",
        ". ",
        "two trucks, and we went away about 20 people. We took some food with\nus towards the Russian border.\nInterviewer: Your whole immediate family?\nMichael Kishel: No, only my father, my brother and I and friends of ours and friends of",
        "other people\u2014their families. My mother and sister, at that time, my",
        "mother and sister and my grandmother, my father\u2019s mother, was living\nwith us as her husband passed away some eight, ten years before--. They\nremained because nothing was taught that they will do anything to the\nwomen. So they remained. After we went back about 200 kilometers\nfrom our town, we heard that a town has already been taken, but we did\nnot realize at what cost. We waited later on to go further and further\naway. We were up to the Russian border, about 3 kilometers from the\nRussian border. The name of the town was Mzorich (ph) (c.018). It\u2019s a\ntown pastRo___\u2014,___\u2014S\u2014s(c.019) and so on. Then on September 17, the\nRussians came in. The Russians came in from the other side, started to\ntake occupied Russian area. At the same time, also came news that the\npact that the Russians made with the Germans was that the Russians will\ngo up to the Vistula (Wisla), and the Germans will go up to the Vistula;\nand that will be the dividing line. Being that we were on the east side of\nthe Vistula, we presumed, which is logically, that we will belong to the\nRussians. So while the Russians were pushing forward, we were behind\nthe Russians going with our trucks; going home to see our parents, to see\nour mother and sister and the family. When we came to a town, 33\nkilometers from Kaluszyn, which town\u2019s name is Siedlce, we were told\nthat the Russians are not going to occupy until the Vistula. They\u2019re going\nback to the Bug (ph) (c.035), which is another demarcation line. At that\ntime we heard the news that the town of Kaluszyn was bombed out\u2014all\u2014\neverything. Was a big fight there because there were many groups of\nsoldiers were there congregating, put up a big fight against the Germans,\nso the only thing the Germans could take revenge was to burn down the\nwhole town. Our house was on the outskirts of the city. Actually we were\ncoming from Warsaw to our town; we were the first or the second house\nentering the city. So the outskirts of the towns were remains; our house\nremained standing. Being that we were in Siedlce, we heard the bad news\nabout it; we decided that no matter what, we will go back to see our\nmother and sister and the other relatives and see what happened. When\nwe came, we saw the very bad situation with the town burned out and\nwere told how the fight happened; that they took all the Jews and other\npeople into the church, and were closing the doors; I supposed they",
        "wanted to kill all the people. Well, anyhow, we came in, we started to\nrealize that many people were living in our house, because they did not\nhave any place else to live. So we see more strangers than our own. So\nwe start to negotiate with the people that were there, to either to go to their\nrelatives to live there, as we had our relatives to take into our house; or to\nsome people to give money to go to other towns, because they did not\nhave anything. Slowly, it took about maybe a week, maybe ten days, |\ndon\u2019t remember exactly, that the people vacated our house. We took in\nour relatives to stay with us at the time. Then the town was without any\n- government. The Germans weren\u2019t in; the Russians did not come in, and\nthe Poles did not know what to do. But there were militia, the civil\u2014\nInterviewer: Wait, the Germans did not occupy the town?\nMichael Kishel: The Germans, being that the Russian was supposed to go to-\u2014after the\nVistula, the Germans moved out. The Russians did not go in, were very\n| close, did not go in, so the Russians didn\u2019t come in there. So the town was\nby itself. But there was civilian employees of the town hall, the town\ngovernment, they patrolled; the city should remain and see what happened.\nA few days after we returned, the Germans start to come in. They started\nto come in, and they told the mayor of the city, which was a neighbor of\nours, to order the Jews to get a\u2014to make a Judenrat, to make a Jewish\ngovernment to attend to the Jewish things. But what they had in mind was\nnot so much as to attend to the Jewish problems, as to supply them with\nwhatever they want. Their appetite became bigger and bigger. They\nwanted for the Jews to supply them with furniture for their occupation,\nthat they\u2019re going to be there. Being that they did not have a place in the\ntown because the town was burned out, they moved into a town, five\nkilometers from our town, which is Mrozy. They settled there, and the\nJewish Judenrat (c.097), the Jewish community, had to supply with all the\nfurniture, tables and chairs and beds and everything there. They also\nordered the mayor of the town which his names was Pliwaczewsk1\n(Plywaczewsky) (ph) (c.101) to nominate ten Jews, ten rich Jews, that they\nshould be responsible for anything they will want to. Among the ten Jews\nwas my father also. I wrote a separate article in Yiddish about the\nfunction of the Judenrat. This article I wrote in request of some Jews that\ncame back from Russia and settled in Israel. That being that we were very\nfew from our town that remained alive, he wrote to me, and I responded to\nhim. I wrote an article in Yiddish, sent to them to Israel, to publish it.\nThey took out a lot of items that needed and put it in the book, of a Yiskor",
        "' ",
        "book, a commemoration book for our town. Maybe they have it. Evo (\u2019)\nhas it. It\u2019s in Yiddish. I brought it with me here.\nInterviewer: All right. We\u2019ll deposit that in our archives.___(c. 124).\nMichael Kishel: To be exactly\u2014what happened how it went through, through the time the\nJews lived in the German occupation until 1942 is mostly described in this\narticle. Being that my father was in Judenrat and doing all the things what\nthe Germans wanted\u2014\nInterviewer: What specifically did he do---?\nMichael Kishel: Specifically, his main object was to make the laws, or their requests, or\n| their orders smaller; which he many times succeeded, most of the time\nsucceeded. For instance, although the town was living mainly in the\ncenter of the town before the war, when the town was burnt, all the Jews\u2014\nthere were older people that lived on the outskirts of the town. When the\nghetto was made, the Germans ordered that all the Jews should go into the\ncenter, they should have more of them. What my father did is to make the\nJews live the way they are in the outskirts of the town. Wherever they\nwere before, make it like that. When they closed the ghetto, because the\nghetto was an open ghetto\u2014that means you could go in you could go out\n\u2014when they closed the ghetto, it also remained the way it was. Jews had\nno right to go out of town. Most of the Jews that lived there, that\nremained there, made their livelihood from the villages; from the farmers\nthat lived on the outskirts. They used to go out and sell them a shirt, buy\nfrom them the cheese or the eggs or anything. This was their business.\nThis is how they\u2014their livelihood. The orders were not to go, because\nthey will be shot. Of course, there were many instances that some were\nshot going to the railroad. My father succeeded in getting many permits\nfor those people to go out during the daytime. There were many things,\nfor instance, for the community itself. There were ...\n(Tape 2)\nThere were many orders that the Germans came in requesting that they\nwant to have for their families\u2014rings and earrings and dresses and things\n. like that. The first thing they did is they came in to ask, because we were\nthe first house, almost in town. My father was the person that used to deal\nwith them. They came in and gave always orders. They need this, and\nthey need that. If not, they will do this, and they will do that as\npunishment. Most of the time, he succeeded in all this to come down with\nthe orders that they wanted, and sometimes it happened that they couldn't",
        "do it either. They killed a family of two children and a friend of one of\nthem\u2014a very bad situation. But most of the time, although it was very\npainful, it did succeed a lot of them.",
        "Interviewer: There was no wired ghetto then?",
        "Michael Kishel: No.",
        "Interviewer: Just a designated area ?",
        "Michael Kishel: Was a designated\u2014the ghetto was wherever the Jew lived. In Kaluszyn\nwas the ghetto.",
        "Interviewer: It was not closed in?",
        "Michael Kishel: There was no closed in like you have\u2014you had in Warsaw ghetto with a\ngate\u2014closed around. There was no closed in. But the closing of the\nghetto meant that they cannot go beyond the area where they lived\u2014they\ncan only go in the town. They are not allowed to go to the village, not\nallowed to go out of the city without a permit. There was also succeeded,\nmy father succeeded is to bring back food from the county. Because the\ngendarmes, the police, the German police used to confiscate from the\nfarmers\u2014they used to bring to take food to sell in Warsaw and other\nplaces. When they passed by, they did not allow to do it, they used to\nconfiscate it. They used to give out to the churches and to different areas.",
        ", So my father used to go there and ask them to give some of them to the\ntown where they made a kitchen to feed the poor people and children. My\nmother was attending this kitchen for a long time to see that the supplies\nare enough.",
        "Interviewer: But your father\u2019s business was totally disrupted, or did he continue to\npump gas?",
        "Michael Kishel: There was no\u2014the business was disrupted in 1939 because there was no\ngas. Jews could not have no gas business, and the trucks were not\navailable; and we did not have any supplies. The only thing is what we\nhad was a store that we could still have like the restaurant going for us\npart-time and some groceries to sell. But most of the time my father was",
        "| busy, because they made my father busy with the Judenrat business.",
        "Interviewer: What did you do?",
        "Michael Kishel: I was also getting---. They also requested that the Judenrat gets Jewish\npolice and Jewish sanitation people, people that help out to keep clean the",
        "houses because--. On top of that our town was destroyed in 1939. They\nsend in a transport of Jews from two other towns that the Germans\nannexed to Germany. It was a town called Pabianice (c.37) and Kalisz\n(c.37). A few hundred people from each of those towns were brought into\nKaluszyn, and they were settled there; said this is where they have to live.\nThey had to be given a place to live into other families and some to live\u2014\nto repair in the buildings that were destroyed. Many of them couldn't do\n, it, and they felt that to go away someplace else better or their relatives\nlived and that remained. Then to be able to keep the apartments or the\nhouses clean, there was no facilities to bathe. There was only one mikvah\nand to have these people\u2014they did not have much\u2014and to ask these\npeople to have clean, where to take them preferably by inducing them with\nbread or with other things they should go and take it. Because they were\nafraid that going to the mikvah or something, being that it is an order from\nthe Germans, will be something wrong. Being that everything was closed,\nthe city became infected with typhus. I was one of the men going to the\nsanitary committee. About a dozen friends and non-friends, other people\nthat were designated to go out to those houses to see that the people keep\nclean. There were times that we used to take a brush and clean up. There\nwere SO many\u2014you could see on the floors so many lice working like\nbugs, was terrible. Slowly, we had to induce the people to come, to get\nclean. Every day of the week, we had other groups of people to take into\nthe mikvah so they can go in there and take baths and get clean. In the\nmeantime some people left over, while they were in the baths, to cleanout\nthe houses. They come on back clean.",
        "Interviewer: What were the non-Jewish ?",
        "Michael Kishel: The non-Jewish population, they did not do anything. They were\nstaying\u2014they still lived there because many of them, they were older-got\nburned out. But they had the right o go anywhere they wanted. They\nwere not restricted. It was only the Jews that were restricted. That went\non and on. Then came the German companies.",
        "Interviewer: What was your sister doing?",
        "Michael Kishel: My sister wasn\u2019t doing anything.

So he went to live in that town, and he\n| took along my grandmother. My aunt, with her husband, took along my\ngrandmother. She lived there until 1942 or even before, 1941. Because\nmy aunt did not have an apartment large enough, so they sent in my\ngrandmother to live with us. My grandmother, my mother\u2019s mother lived\nwith us.

They used to go for days, grab every day some other\npeople to come to work\u2014take them away four or five kilometers from the\nhouse\u2014from the town, and they used to work on the roads.

Although before, no\npeople wanted to go to work because they got beaten up, and they didn\u2019t\nget paid. After it was an arrangement that they are to pay, a lot of people\nwanted to go to work, but it still was not enough payment what they\nwanted to pay. Because at that time, they paid five zlotys a day, which a\nkilo bread which is about 2 % pounds, cost ten. So all they could make is\na half a kilo bread; so how could they go to work? So being that the\nJudenrat wanted to have the people work and do in something, so the\nJudenrat supplied with the bread. With each worker that goes to work,\nwill get a half kilo bread. The money what he will get for the day\u2019s work,\nhe will have for other things. There was also some other supplies that\nused to bring in from Sec (c.124), merchandise, the potatoes, onions\nor salad or some vegetables; used to bring in for the kitchen.

This is how we got out of it. But a lot of people got out from\nthe hospital; it\u2019s the luck, it\u2019s the attention and everything. More\nexplanations is in the story that I wrote in Yiddish. Different sections of\ndifferent times what the Judenrat had to do, and how they did it, and who\nwas responsible, where and how and so on. How many people were\nworking in what work was there. If it would work out on the pages, would\nbe if you have someone that reads Yiddish...if you'll make the copies, so\nif there\u2019s any question, you\u2019 ll tell me which page it is, then you call on the\nphone and Ill talk to the person exactly what it is. Then when it came in\n1942, when they started to send the Jews to the gas chambers and\nsupposedly to work in the east\u2014first they started at Warsaw. Then we get\ncloser and closer\u2014they came to Minsk, and they came to Kaluszyn.",

As a matter of fact, we had news because there was a\ntime that we could get a permit from the German authorities to allow us to\nbring in the family from Warsaw. There was also many German\nWehrmacht, soldiers, that were drivers that were there. That was in 1941,\n41 or 42. They were working on the\u2014to dismantling the synagogue. So\nwe used to induce him to go to Warsaw and bring out some people. So\nmy brother used to go out with him to Warsaw and bring out the relatives\nand some other relatives of other people used to be there. Of course, we\ntook them out from there, but then they came into us, and they perished\nthrough\u2014later on. Was very hard but this is what happened.",

They knew\u2014they\nguarding the Jews not to go out. Or many Germans that were just in the\nWehrmacht, just in the army, did not know; they just knew that the Jews\nare their enemies, but they didn\u2019t tell them anything. But those that used\nto take care of all these resettlements are mostly SS, and their helpers were\nmostly Ukrainians, Lithuanians, Estonians, Latvians, from Latvia, and\nPoles.

But that was\nonly for the reason to make another settlement. Instead of taking\u2014\nsending for each one from 15 different places, they got it everybody in one\nplace and sent them out together.

I was just getting breakfast and dinner. In the morning |\ngot a piece of bread, and at night I got the soup. Nobody took me to work.\nA whole group of us, because we were so undernourished that they\ncouldn\u2019t do anything with us. And why did they do that to us, I don\u2019t\nknow. They could have as well send us to the crematorium. There I got,\nthey sent me into a place where they start to take us to work. I was\nworking on a place they called Kandbiegvirg (ph) (c.835).

Then we started to walk on the roads. While walking we came\ninto a place called Waldenburg (ph) (c.889). Today it belongs to Poland,\ncalled Waljick.

When we walked in, they closed the doors, and we were maybe\n1000 people, maybe more. From the heat, a lot of people got\u2014heat and\nhunger and everything; they collapsed. I had two friends that were with\nme. Although I was very poor in\u2014at that time we walked out of Buna, it\nwasn\u2019t that bad because we had the\u2014the situation was bad but not as bad\nas at Birkenau or in other places.

Each wagon had about 15 or 20\nprisoners. Those that were on the sides and the back were beaten up by\nthe Germans to push, to go faster. Those that were in the front to pull,\nwere beaten up why you\u2019re running so fast, to pull back. So no matter\nwhat, if you went to the wagon, you were a dead man.

A\nseparate story about my father is written in the story that I gave about how\nthe ghetto works which you will see it. I will just mention one particular\ninstance of my father, what happened in 1940. Sometimes in 1940, the\nGermans came with an order that the Jews, Kaluszyn must supply 150\nmen to be sent to Biala Podlaska (c.12).

My father, being that he\u2019s under practically all the\narrangements, all the things to get things done, he took a trip to Biala\nPodlaska (c.26) to see if he could bring the boys back by himself. He had\nto receive a permit from the county Germany, from the county Germans,\nto go there, as Jews were not permitted to go by train. When he came\nthere, he got all the story from the boys, what they were doing. He could\nonly see 12 of them. The other ones, either they were at work, or they\nweren\u2019t allowed to be seen. He was talking to the Germans in that camp,\nto release them, to let them go home because we need them at home; we\nhave industries that work for German, for the German Wehrmacht, for the\nGerman army. For the nerve to tell the Germans to let them out, he got so\nbeaten up that he could not do anything and luckily he came home, was in\nbed; laid in bed for about two weeks, till it came back to him. Seeing the\nconditions that were there in Biala Podlaska (c.37) he decided that he must\ncdo something; he cannot leave those boys there. He went to the authorities\nin the county again with a story that why don\u2019t they give us a paper that\nwe need those boys in a factory that is producing products for the German\narmy, like the sheepskin coats which the Germans need for winter clothing\nand other things. This helped. Again he made a trip to Biala Podlaska\n(c.43) with that letter, and he brought the boys back. As you can\nsometimes see Moses going out of Egypt?
