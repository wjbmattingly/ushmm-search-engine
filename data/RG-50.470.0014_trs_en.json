You couldn't use the hypo because\nthere was no place\n[INTERRUPTION]\nPAT LYNCH: We were in an evacuation hospital close by. I\nwas in a small hospital it moved a lot. And this was\nprobably one of the subcamps. We'd been to Rhine first and\nthen we moved around, moved on down south, and this was a\nsubcamp. There were a few of us who went over there,\nbecause we couldn't, not all the nurses and doctors could go\nbecause we had, somebody had to take care of our patients at\nour hospital, so they'd take a few each day and go over and\nit was just terrible. I couldn't believe it. Absolutely.\nI stood there for a while, and some of the girls walked out,\nand I thought to myself, if I walk out I'm not getting back\nin here, I've got to stay. I can't walk out. They walked\nout and made a circle around and came back in. So I [sighs]\noh, am I gonna be able to this, and I thought, for a little\nwhile, I don't think I can do this, and then I got busy and\nstarted in working.",
        "SWB: How did it compare to what you had been doing.\nPAT LYNCH: Oh, no comparison at all.\nSWB: Tell me. I've never been in one of those... I don't\neven know what, you were Saving men who were wounded... so\ntell me the contrast.\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/8/95 NURSE PAT LYNCH Page\n2\nPAT LYNCH: Oh, well, first, our patients had the best of\ncare, and they weren't neglected, I mean, even though we\nwere out in the field, we did everything we could for them,\nand we were kind to them. But here we go in this\u2019 place\nwhere these people have been abused. And they didn't have\nmedical care, they didn't have anything. And it was a real\nSharp contrast. While we didn't have the best of equipment,\nwe had the best that we could have out in the field\nhospital. But they were fed and we took good care of them,\nthen we go someplace where people had no care at all, nobody\ncared for them, no one was interested in them, and they were\njust lying on concrete, some of them, with temperatures of",
        "108. And they hadn't been fed. They had some wooden rolls\nabout so big around with some soup in, and I noticed that\nparticularly and the patients were too weak to reach over\nand get it. That was the only pretense that they made of\nfeeding them. And uh, they were so thin. I couldn't pick\nany of them up, I tried to, but if I really picked them up I\nwould tear the skin. So we had to be very very careful\nmoving them out. The skin was just so terrible. So it\nwould take, about, at least three people, one person take\nthe head, one person take the legs, and very carefully lift\nthem up and get them outside, go ahead and get them outside\nof that place. We put up tents outside, we had cots\u2019 and\nclean bedding. So we'd take them out there. Or if there\nwas a hospital nearby, we'd go and take over that hospital\nand move them in there. But, uh, we couldn't, for typhus,\nthat was the main thing, there was no medication, just\nSupportive treatment, and get fluids down them, well they\ncouldn't drink anything, so we had to feed them with\nmedicine droppers, and we couldn't give them hypos because\nthere was no place to stick them. There was no skin at all,\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/8/95 NURSE PAT LYNCH Page\n3",
        "no muscle, just skin and bone, there was no place to give\nthem a hypo. So, it was, I was just weak, I couldn't\nbelieve it happened. And then I was so afraid, I thought,\nwhat else are we gonna run into. Is this gonna go on? And\nthen, later on, I think we were all just infuriated, and\noutraged at what had happened. But right in the beginning\nwe were so afraid, first we didn't believe it.\nSWB: How many-- What were the numbers like, that you were\nconfronted with. How many of you were there and how many\npeople were you trying to help?\nPAT LYNCH: Oh, see, those that were able to be moved, now\nthey went to DP camps from the concentration camps. And if\nthey were able to be moved, they hurried up and moved them\nover there, and I don't know what the DP camps were, whether\nthey were buildings, or to me it sounded like they were\ncamps, outdoors someplace. But nevertheless, they were much\nbetter than what they had. And so they moved those, and\nthose that were really too sick to move, we had to find a\nbuilding, or put a tent up outside. We had to get them out\nof the camps, it was too dirty in there. And so we put\ntents up, and we knew how to run a hospital under tents\nbecause that's what we'd been doing. The evacuation\nhospital that I was with was all tents. Even surgery. So\nwe knew how to run a hospital under tents. So we put\u2019 the\nup, put tents outside and got clean bedding for them, and\nthey were bathed, and took care of them there, until we\ncould move them someplace else. But mainly to get them out",
        "of those buildings, they were just terrible. They were\ninfested with mites, and oh, just awful. If they didn't\nhave typhus, well they'd get it if they didn't get out.\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/8/95 NURSE PAT LYNCH Page\n4\nSWB: How did you guys protect yourselves?\nPAT LYNCH: Oh we had, I'd had training in communicable\ndiseases, that's what I did, and that's one reason they sent\nme there. Because I'd had some training in communicable\ndiseases. We had DDT powder that we used, and it was in a\nthing that looks like an old flint gun, you know, they used\nto spray flies, we had a canister with a pump on it, so we\nput the powder and then we would stick it down our _ slacks\nand socks and under our arms, and get inside of our\nfatigues. I don't know what we did about our hair. That's\none thing I've been trying to figure out how did we, we must\nhave dusted some kind of a cap, and then put that on, or\nmaybe we had a, we may have tied it up with a cloth, dusted\nthe cloth and then tied our hair up, because if the mite\nwould get on us, we'd get it too. So, that's about the only",
        "thing that we did, that I remember, and try to get as much\nrest as we could, of course that wasn't very easy because\nwe'd been working sixteen hours a day, but keep well rested.\nOur food wasn't very good. It was K rations and C rations,\nno fresh fruit, no milk. No fresh potatoes, no vegetables.\nEverything was powdered. I never had any fruit all the time\nI was there, no milk. But anyway we managed to stay\nhealthy. Where these people hadn't had anything to eat\nexcept bread crusts and coffee grounds. Our general health\nwas good, our resistance was good, so that's probably what\nkept us from getting it.\nSWB: Were things well organized, or was it pretty chaotic,\nand how did you see light at the end of the tunnel, or did\nyou ever?\nPAT LYNCH: I thought that when they got organized, it was\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/8/95 NURSE PAT LYNCH Page\n5\npretty well organized, because all the leaders came forth,\namong the people in the camps, the survivors, the leaders\nall came forth and helped out. See, we didn't get there",
        "first, the American soldiers got there first, so the\nsoldiers and the people in the camps started running the\ncamps, and I thought they did pretty well. And then they\nrecruited German people to do the laundry, to do the\ncooking, to clean, and do all sorts of things. So, pretty\nsoon it was, things were going pretty well. It was a matter\nof just taking care of these desperately ill patients. And\nthen we started getting better supplies. Also, after we\ntook over a town, after the infantry or tank corps got in\nthere, they'd go to the burgermeister of the town and tell\nhim what we needed. So they just, said we need so many beds\nand need so much clean linen, we brought what we had, what\nwe could spare from our hospital, but we did tell him what\nwe want, and they'd hurry up and find it. So, in that way,\nit wasn't too bad. It was primitive, but we got by, I'll\nsay.\nSWB: What was the attitude of the Germans that helped?\nPAT LYNCH: They hung on to us and hugged us like they\nthought we were gonna go away. Oh, the German people, oh\nnot this, excuse me, oh, they were very submissive for the\nmost part. They were very cooperative. And then the\nburgermeister would send whatever we wanted, if he possibly\ncould find it, of course [2?2?2???7??] with the German\nefficiency, go find it, get what we need. But as far as the\nSurvivors were concerned, they just hung to us, those that\ncould, many of them were too weak, they couldn't lift their\narms up. They hung on to us and grabbed our clothes for",
        "fear we're gonna leave. But, no, the people who came in to\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/8/95 NURSE PAT LYNCH Page\n6\nwork, for the most part, were cooperative. They probably\ndidn't want to be there, but they, it was only one nurse\nthat I didn't get along with, at one hospital we had taken\nover, and we had taken the survivors in there. And she was\na little abrupt. She's a good nurse, German nurse, but she\nwas abrupt, and she would, I'd hear her talking to the\npatients, she'd say 'Swallow that,' \"Drink that,' kind of\nbarking at them so I took her aside and told her she'd have\nto be more caring. I said, you can't talk to these peo-,\nthose people that way. Well, she didn't like me very well,\nso every time she went by me she'd give me a dirty look.\nOtherwise, I got along fine. There was another nurse there,\nher name was Margaret, and I got along fine with her. She\nwas a little bit older. The people we had the trouble with\nwere the Hitler youth, the young ones. They were starting\nup again. And some of our officers and our men found them\nout in a cemetery, starting up all over again, marching\naround, Heil Hitler, so, I don't know what they did, and I\nguess they call the MP's and told them to take them on home.",

But the Hitler youth, they were\nvery bold, and I think they, I was really afraid of them.\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/8/95 NURSE PAT LYNCH Page\n7\nAfter the war was over and we could ride around, maybe go,\nwe couldn't go anyplace before without an armed escort. And\nof course the doctors weren't armed, we had to find somebody\nif we wanted to go to another little town if we wanted to\nvisit a friend or something, we had to find an armed escort\nto go with us, but I was always afraid of that Hitler youth",

What\nabout the Germans.\nPAT LYNCH: Oh, they said that they didn't, now, now, they\nsay they didn't know that it was going on, but... They just\ndidn't say too much of anything. They just went about their\nwork. But I'm sure they knew what was going on, they were\nprobably in there helping. And the German citizens probably\nwere in there. I always thought they were probably in there\nhelping.\nSWB: What about, did you, did the townspeople have to bury\nsome of the people, tell me in detail about that.\nPAT LYNCH: Uh, the soldiers told them that they would have\nto bury these people and give them a decent burial with the\nstar of David and all. I happened to be going through a",
        "Working transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/8/95 NURSE PAT LYNCH Page\n8\nlittle village one day and I saw these ladies carrying the\ncaskets. And they did look remorseful, with dark circles\nunder their eyes, and dressed in black, they looked pretty\nsad. There weren't too many of them because, well, I\nwouldn't say there weren't more than 30 or 40 that I = Saw,\nwalking along to the cemetery, carrying the caskets, but our\nsoldiers made them do that. They probably didn't want to,\nbut I think that's the only time I saw them look ae little\nbit remorseful.\nSWB: Did you talk to some of the survivors that you helped?\nTell me what you remember of that.\nPAT LYNCH: Oh, they just hang on to us and grab us, they\ndidn't want us to leave, and then they were going to. the,\nsome that were going to the DP camps, I remember one group\ngoing, and uh, we did all sorts of things for them that day,\nI helped one man, or maybe several, their feet were just cut\nup something terrible. They wore wooden shoes, so_ I\nbandaged them all up and put socks on them, and all other\nthings. They had sore throatsand whatever and they went to\nget in this, the truck or ambulances, and they were all",
        "crying. Then I said, where you're going, they'll be nice to\nyou too. And, uh, they were so grateful. I'll never forget\nthey were saying auf wiedersehen, auf wiedersehen, crying as\nthey left. I said well they'll be real nice to you in the\ncamps, and if you get sick, if anything happens, if they\ncan't take care of you, they'll send you back to our\nhospital which was 123rd evac. We'd be set up and they'll\nbring you back there if anything happens and that's. what\nthey did. See later on, this typhus, I thought the typhus\nepidemic was pretty well under control towards summer and it\nwasn't. And uh, we were back at our hospital and we had\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/8/95 NURSE PAT LYNCH Page\n9\ngotten into a permanent building by that time, because we\nwere generally in tents. And we were getting an awful lot\nof people from the DP camps in, with typhus, and uh, I\nthought by that time the epidemic was under control.\nSWB: Tell me how you dealt with this personally. I mean,\ndid you feel guilt, you must have been a young women,\nhealthy and, tell me how you felt.\nPAT LYNCH: I felt very guilty, because I thought, here I",
        "am, well, why did we let this happen? Why didn't somebody\nstop it, we all, you know, we should have put a stop to it\nand nobody did, and then I felt like, here I am living over\nin a tent, and I don't, and we, with the minimum, eating C\nrations and K rations, but if I get sick, somebody's going\nto take care of me, I'm gonna be treated nice. Where those\npeople were treated so terrible. And I felt guilty, here,\nI'll always be taken care of, but look what's happened to\nthem, they're so disgraceful. We had a lot of guilt\nfeelings. Why did we survive, and... why are we treated so\nwell, and here these peopel have nothing, they're starving.\nWe certainly didn't have very much but we had a lot better\nthan what they had. And uh, I think the guilt was why in\nthe world did anyone let this happen. We just couldn't\nbelieve it.\nSWB: Did you pray?\nPAT LYNCH: Oh, I guess. I'm still wearing my St. Jude\nmedal. I prayed all the time.

In fact I still have one\nin my purse, it's a new one. The other one is all dog\neared. We all prayed.\nSWB: Tell me again what you had to deal with medically with\nthese people. Describe it to me, thinking that I'm not a\nnurse, how difficult it was to get an IV started, for\nexample...\nPAT LYNCH: Well, starting IV's was almost impossible,\nbecause here they were starving, and if you start shooting\nfluid in, it would be just a little bit too much in _ the\nheart and lungs, you know, start shooting all that in them,\nhere they... they hadn't, they couldn't even swallow, but we\nstarted IV's very very carefully, and very slowly, but we\nfed them with medicine droppers, and I tried to prop them\nup, and if you give them a little piece of a cracker or\nsomething, that wouldn't go down. And uh, they hadn't\nSwallowed anything for so long, but, I used to rup this way,\ngive them a little bit on a spoon, of a little fluid, and\nthen rub this way, and, and then finally get it, get them to\nSwallow it, but uh. They had big old bowls of, I don't know\nwhat, some kind of soup, sitting around, like the pretense\nof feeding them, big old wooden bowls and a big tablespoon.",
        "Well they were too weak to reach over and pick up that\nspoon, and they couldn't get it in their mouth anyway, cause\ntheir mouth was just kind of set and drawn, and so. they\ncouldn't have opened their mouth to eat whatever this, I\nthink it had been there about three days, it was just\nterrible. But, they had this food sit, this soup or\nwhatever, under the pretense of having fed them. See most\nof them weren't getting anything but, uh, um, old crust of\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/8/95 NURSE PAT LYNCH Page\n11\nbread every day. The people who were going out work got a\ncrust of bread and some coffee grounds, and they'd try and\nsave a little bit of bread for the next day. I don't know\nhow they worked.\nSWB: Now, why don't you tell me about the one woman in\ncharge of the camp that you got to see that time.\nPAT LYNCH: Oh, she was terrible, I'll never forget her.\nThey, I used to get her because of the people from the, see\nthe soldiers, the German soldiers in the camps and =the\npeople that were running the camp, they knew that the",
        "Americans were coming pretty soon. They were figured that\nout. So they just took off to the villages. Well then the\nSurvivors in the camp kind of took over and then when the\nAmerican soldiers got there, well between the American\nsoldiers and the survivors, they were running the camps.\nBut they got this woman and put her up on the third floor in\na cell. This was in Rhine. And that place was more like a\njail. It had catwalks and little tiny cells but they're\nmore like, they looked like animal cages to me. But they\nhad her up there, locked, and she was just terrible. Worst\nlooking thing I have ever seen. Mean, and so she would be\ntried for war crimes of course. But they couldn't wait to\nget us up there to see her. They said, don't you want to\nsee her, I said well I can't right now but before the day is\nover I'll go up and see her. And the man who was in charge\nthere was from Holland. He knew nothing about his\u2019 family,\nhe had daughters and his wife, but he said he had no idea\nwhere they were. And he had kind of taken over and uh, he\nspoke beautiful English, and uh, so he came around several\ntimes that day I was working, and said, don't you want to go\nupstairs, and I said, well, when I'm through I'll, I'm gonna\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/8/95 NURSE PAT LYNCH Page\n12",

I talked to other soldiers after\nthat, and one in particular, a fellow from our town, he just\ndied, but he had gone into Buchenwald and the nurses didn't\ngo in there, they said, I heard that they said it was just\nso terrible they couldn't let us go in there. But he said,\nthe women in charge of the camps were worse than the men.\nHe'd been in several and been in some of the subcamps, and\nhe managed to see some of these women. He said they were\nworse than the men. They were meaner. And oh she was mean\nlooking. Just terrible.\nSWB: Did you see any survivors have reunions with other\npeople they knew or family members?\nPAT LYNCH: Not really, I didn't um, they were having a hard\ntime finding their family members. So many of them had been\nkilled, and uh, I didn't, after they left there I didn't see\ntoo much of them unless they got sick again, and then they\ncame back to our hospital that following summer. And _ they\ncame back with typhus, and tuberculosis, and oh any number\nof things. We even had maternity cases where we set up a\nmaternity ward. Some of the people were pregnant when they\nwent to DP camps and then they brought them over to our\nhospital to deliver the babies. And uh, so I got to _ see\nthem again. And spend more time with them, I wasn't so busy\nthen so I got to spend a little more time with them. There\nwere a lot of ladies in, they came in with typhus. One",

And\nif there's any way that they had any flesh at all under the\nSkin, we'd inject water, they call it hyperdemoclasis,\nsometimes in the shoulder there'd be a little fatty tissue\nthere, muscle, then we'd inject some water into them because\nthey were all dehydrated.

I don't know how they\nsurvived. Well, many didn't, of course. But some we were\nable to help.\nSWB: Do you know about the, um, the overeating and people\ndying from overeating when the camps were open, did you see\nany?\nPAT LYNCH: I heard about it, the GI's, of course the GI's\nalways had a candy bar someplace and they want to be kind,\nand these people who were up and around but hadn't had much\nto eat but they were still able to walk around, they were\nworking, well they gave them candy bars and they got very\nsick.

The eyes were all\nsunken in, and uh, terribly thin, just skin and bones. But\nyou try and get them to eat, it was just terrible. You know\nthey just could not swallow things. So we used the medicine\ndroppers, little by little they started to improve, but the\nskin gets so terrible, no nutrition, the skin is terrible,\nand break out in rashes, and then, they said, you know, you\ncouldn't lift them up because if I'd go like so, I'd tear\ntheir skin.

Well I remember going back to\nRhine, the first camp I was in, and we put patients, I think\nthere must have been a staff room where the soldiers lived,\nor, I don't know, a dining room or, we put a lot of them\ndown there and set up a hospital. And went I went back two\nor there months later they looked so much different, you\nwouldn't believe it. They had changed a lot. By that time,\nthey were eating and their color was good, and they were\nlaughing, and, they were too sick to be out of bed, they'd\nhad, had typhus and they were much too sick, but, they\nlooked much different.\nSWB: So you saw a huge change in those months between March\nand say August.\nPAT LYNCH: Oh yeah, definitely.\nSWB: Tell me about that. How did it make you feel?\nPAT LYNCH: Oh it made me feel marvelous, it was so\nrewarding. It was the most rewarding thing I've ever done.\nWe did, you know we were able to do something for those\npeople. And uh, one regret that I have that I didn't, I was",

I always think about I wish I knew\nwho some of them were. And, but I do, think about that a\nlot. And I wish I'd spent just a little more time but I\ndidn't, I couldn't.\nSWB: How long hours did you work?\nPAT LYNCH: Oh, we weren't supposed to work more than\nSixteen, but, or twelve, but I think that was about the\nlimit. We had a pretty strict rule on that. Because if,\nour chief nurse said if we got sick, well then we'd be no\nvalue to her, we'd just, be, more or less of a burden = on\nher, so she expect, she wanted us to sleep eight hours in\n24, not to just stay on duty 24 hours a day but sometimes we\nstayed longer than that. That's the only thing I was ever\nreprimanded for. She came around one morning and said how,\nshe goes to me and says, how come. And I said I just can't\nleave, it was too much work to do. And she says well you'll",

And she says, well I'll take care of that. But\nyou have got to go. So that's the only time I was ever\nreprimanded for anything. Staying on duty too long. Nobody\nwanted to go, actually, that was hard. They didn't, if\nthere was work to do they didn't want to leave, under stress\npeople always work much harder. And uh, they didn't want to\ngo off duty, they could see too many things to be done.\nWorking transcript: not spell checked or verified for accuracy.\nWentworth Films LIBERATION/DP PROJ. 2/8/95 NURSE PAT LYNCH Page\n18\nSWB: So you got up at dawn, and...\nPAT LYNCH: Generally, we were up at six and uh, had\nbreakfast and were on duty at seven, and uh, we worked from\nseven to seven, and the night nurse would come from _ seven\nand work till seven the next morning.

I\nthink there's probably some more specific treatment now, but\nat that time there wasn't much that we could do for them.\nJust supportive treatment. This high fever, sevre headache,\nand sometimes rash. And of course they couldn't eat, they'd\nstarved them anyway, but when we got there it was terribly\nhard for them to eat. And many of them died. That was the\nmain cause of death in the camps. That and tuberculosis.\nCause the mites got started, got in there and, they were\njust all over. They slept on old, like, burlap bags stuffed\nwith straw. So you can imagine that was full of the bugs.\nAnd uh, there just wasn't much chance.

And there were children around\nthere and I remember one of our doctors was playing with the\nchildren, ...this little girl and say, pat her on the head\nand say, have you had the brump test today, and, they were\nusing the brump test to diagnose it.
