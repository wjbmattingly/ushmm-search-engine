        "A:Okay. My name is Israel Ipson. I've been born in Lithuanian in 1911, March 15th, 1911.\nAnd my father was a worker, worked in the brewery. The brewery was in Slobodka.\nWhy is it the brewery was in a place in Slobodka? You know, the Lithuanians didn't\nwant to have the industry, what coming up, to the Lithuanians, that they should have it.\nThe Jews were not allowed to go to work in Kovno, which Kovno was the capital city of\nLithuania, so we had to go to work in Slobodka. Slobodka was a suburb. In Slobodka\nlives around 10,000 Jews. Mostly the poor. They didn't have nothing to eat, and it was a\npity. For where I come from a very, very poor family. My grandfather worked in the\nbrewery with Golswolf Ingleman (ph). My father worked in the brewery. My uncle --\nalmost everybody in the poor Jews in Lithuanian worked for the brewery. Why? The\nowner from the brewery was the Wolfs, Wolf brothers. There were six brothers. The\nfamily were the Wolfs, and they were a very philanthropic family. And they support the\nJews. How? They build the brewery, and everybody almost work for the brewery. They\nalso invent a time -- used to be a time where full of snowing. In Lithuanian 1s a lot of full\nof snow, and they used to be covered up and drowned in snow. Was sending in with\nhorses for the brewery to get the people, bring them back to the place of work. That's\nhow heavy the snow it was. And my father was liked by the brewmeister (ph). The\nbrewmeister was a German from Bavaria, and he was his helper. Anything -- the war got\nto be -- now my father used to do in the brewery, the brewmeister done only sit and got\nthe taste of the beer, the color. I remember father used to -- I used to bring my father\nlunch every day. My mother used to send me potato sweet herring. It would want that\nmy father should be thirsty, be able to drink the beer and save the tune for the beer, they\ncall it. And the pilsner and all the names, they funny. And it's the way the poor Jews in\nSlobodka, they make their living. Later on when Lithuania become an independent\nnation run by a school teacher, or the name Smetona, he gave the Jews more right. What\nhe done, he brought the Jews away from the brewery. The brewery was filled with ;\nbut it opened up more industries to the Lithuanians to make him happy. Smetona was a\nsmart -- very -- was such a nice man. Tried to help also the Jews to participate in the\nindustry. It shouldn't be any fights between the Jews and the Lithuanians, try to avoid it.\nBut still after, there's still was plenty bad feeling between one and the other. And what\nhas happened, the biggest problem I think what it was, the Lithuanians start taking out --\nthe German took the Lithuanian out and send them to camps to work. They also, the\nRussians, the communists, was being picked, like the school teachers, manufacturers, the\nricher element of people, they used to be sent to Siberia, blaming them for the things\nwhich not happened. But also the Jews didn't knew nothing about it, but they should be\nsaying that the Jews kill their own, that take no other Lithuanians to Siberia. Siberia was\na -- the camp, a labor camp. It is a very, very, very miserable place to be. But mostly 90\npercent from the people who be sent to Siberia been dead because they didn't seem to\ncome back alive.",
        "Question: What era are you talking about right now?",
        "A:Siberia.",
        "Q:When you're talking about the Germans and the communists, what year are you talking?",
        "A:Oh, it was in 1941.",
        "Q:You're talking later?",
        "A:Right.",
        "Q:Okay. Let's go back a little. And I want to ask you a little bit more about your family life as a\nboy, your religious background.",
        "A:Oh, I see.",
        "Q:Just the lifestyle in Slobodka.",
        "A:Right. Well, I was also came in time when we didn't have any telephones; we didn't have any\nlights. Iused to goinschool___ they call 1t.. What was the -- ever was the old person,\nknowledgeable, been pitching for pay to the boys to go to hayda (ph), we used to call it.\nAnd at the hayda we used to come in and stay there until, in wintertime, 7:00, 8:00\no'clock at night until it get dark and bring them home. And that was our education to\npeople. Like my wife was just saying, she speaks good Jewish, the Jewish language. The\nJewish language was a language from childhood you got it up. And I had two rabbis,\nbecause one rabbi was the Hebrew language, another was Jewish. And then we had in\nSlobodka a rabbinical seminary. The biggest rabbinical seminary in the world, because\nin that time, in 1914, -17, the only thing they knew 1s to learn the bible. The people was\npoor. There was nothing to eat. They were sitting there all day long in the seera (ph),\nthey call it, it is a rabbinical seminary. And people from all over the world would be\nsending their youth to that seminary in Slobodka. It was not only later on -- the later\nyears grew up, itwas__ with their also young kids been going there to teach to\nbecome a rabbi. But it is really -- the big leaving to be a rabbi at that time, they couldn't\ndo nothing. They couldn't make it. But they been supported by the American people,\neven in World\u2019 War'I. They already been sending help to the Jews in Slobodka. The\nchief rabbis used to come in here and in speeches speaking through the American Jew to\nhelp the Jews in Slobodka, because all it be these weddings used to come between rabbis\nand -- and then the rabbi had a daughter who had got to get married, used to take along\nwith him the comment of a trip to America and find -- go to the seera to pick a boka (ph),\nto pick a learning young man that they should get married and been supported by the\nJews in America. It was a tradition to help the orthodox. And it is still rnght now in\nSlobodka. The seera is in existence now in Israel. They know more in Slobodka, but\nafter the war they move the chief rabbi, moved him to Israel.",
        "Q:So your boyhood was very involved with religious learning and --",
        "A:Right. And then I was -- after the learning, the religious learning, I went in high\u2019school. It\nbecame the Jews decided to open up a hipper (ph) high\u2019school. And it became the\nGermans in 1917 they had a lot of educated people in the army and they decided to stay\nin Lithuanian to teach us, and then we had enough people to get a private school going.\nAnd it was like one famous teacher, Karlbah (ph), and he -- in his name was created a\nhigh\u2019school, and it called Karlbah . And then we had also in the Russian language\na high\u2019school. And we had in Lithuanian we had three high\u2019schools. And then we had\nthe orthodox school was in Kovno. And everybody been happy until Hitler come to\nbeing.",
        "Q:Okay. What -- tell me a little bit about your family. Did you have brothers and sisters?",
        "A:I have -- I had two sisters -- didn't have any brothers -- and they perished in the Holocaust.\nAnd one was married, and the other one was still a girl. She was married, but she was a\nfamous -- how you call it? Painting. She was a oil painting. She had a name. They ask\nher to come to Paris, and she was staying for three months in Paris and learning the\npainting guys. She come back with the famous paint pieces and all that stuff.",
        "Q:Do you have memories of your family life together?",
        "A:Oh, I have, yeah.",
        "Q:Nice family life?",
        "A:Very nice. Well, we been all together until I married. I was staying home with my parents.\nAnd my father, he was a orthodox Jew, and everything -- we used to come to holidays.\nWe took it together, like the Passover holidays, the high holidays, and we been meet\ntogether. Everybody would come. And the woman -- it was orthodox fashion, the prayer\nseparate. They have a separation between men and woman. But that reminds me\ndifferent moments that they -- I don't know what you call it. A helper who helps the\nsynagogue. Summis (ph), is that how you call it? Hell. I'll have to skip it. I don't know\nhow to say in English. They call them a special -- used to go out on every Friday night\nand say, \"Jews, you got to close the stores. There's all this = =~ coming around. Don't\ndo any business anymore.\" So someone got to stop them, and they used to stop it. But\neverything was fine until 2042 when the war started with Hitler and Stalin and Churchill.\nI used to like to listen to the shortwave radio. And the Jews which was locked up in the\nghetto, we used to come to my place where I lived to hear what's going on in the fronts.\nWell, how is Hitler doing? Well, Hitler is winning the war or losing the war? And we\nwas very interested in this. They come from my working place, which was the airport,\nand talking till the group, which used to come to listen to me, what's happened on the\nfront, how Hitler is doing. And they used to come up. To explain the truth, I was already\nscared. They could lock me up and find out about it, because if you were a Kraut. And I\nbe begging them they shouldn't come no more, because -- and I -- they didn't have a place\nnowhere to go, and they still -- I said, \"Tell them it's very important.\" And they were\nvery interested, like they would be generals, they used to tell me. One would sit here this\nway and one would sit that way, and they knew what they were talking about and they\nbeen leading the war.",
        "Q:Okay. Let's -- I don't want to get quite there yet. I still want a few more questions about\nbefore the war began; okay?",
        "A:Uh-huh.",
        "Q:Now, were you -- were there all kinds of sort of -- I'm still trying to learn more about the life\nin Slobodka. You got married at what time?",
        "A:I got married in 1931.",
        "Q:And what -- I'm trying to get a sense about the sort of political atmosphere, the cultural\natmosphere. Did you have contact with Lithuanian people? All of that.",
        "A:Let's see. Well, I went -- in Lithuanian after I finished highschool, I went to college, and in\ncollege I took up law. And I was -- liked to stay with law. And I was doing all right. I\nhave a nice trade, because the law -- Lithuanians who have been all together in groups\nmostly going out together and discussing together, going to the -- every evening we used\nto come to one or to the other . And until Celingus (ph) was the ringstat (ph) or\njustice that come out with the decree that not one Jew cannot practice law until -- not no\nJew. I'm sorry. He didn't mention Jew. He said not one young man who graduated from\ncollege in Lithuania cannot practice law before he got to go in court who working for five\nyears. After the five years working in the court, he can practice law. I didn't have no\nchoice, but I still did not have any choice. I couldn't get in to work in the court, because\nthey answer -- when I used to send application to the courts and ask them for a job in\ncourt, to open it up that I should be able to become a lawyer, the answer used to be all the\ntime, \"Sorry. We don't have any vacancies. We cannot help you.\" And I couldn't get in\nin law.",
        "Q:What year was this?",
        "A:It was in 1932. And then one day it was -- it was a lucky moment with the courts. I had to get\na job already. Jay was born and I got married, I had to make a living. My father was\npoor. And I took a job as accountant and worked in a big concern (ph). And I worked\nthere, and one of my buddies, my friends from college, he recognized me that I came to\nthe government bank to pay a bill, I don't remember, for the company I work through,\nbecause the company asked me to make a deposit and I'm paying. That he was a\nLithuanian. He worked with chief of police. But he also went to the college. He come to\nme and say, \"Ipson, look. I got something.\" My name was Ipson. Iposon (ph) in\nLithuanian. \"I got something -- good news for you. Don't tell nobody, but I can give you\na tip now.\" Lithuanian didn't have any mechanical business, like cars, trucks, machinery.\nIt was a poor farm country, like 87 percent of the Lithuanians was farmer. Then they\ndidn't have nothing. And now already the countries like -- like now the Balkans, already\nthey are Czechoslovakia started in their time, Bulgaria. Here no one with fighting with\nall that stuff. And Hitler's told this Czechoslovakian, told the League of Nations -- was in\nat that time. Like the United Nations, it was the League of Nations. He told the League\nof Nations that he wanted Czechoslovakia, said that Czechoslovakia was his. And that\nstart already in that time beginning all the fights. But -- and I worked at the factory -- at\nthe company as accountant. And another one came to me, also. He say that's what me a\ngood job to be is the distributor of Belgian-made motorcycles. That was the F.N. F.N.\nstand for __\u2014.~ And I got the job for -- I like the motorcycles. I went to work for the\nmotorcycles, and that was lucky. I started making money. But it didn't last long. I had\nstarted and the war started and Stalin got in. They divided Europe in two halves: half\nHitler and half Stalin. And they divided that between themselves, and we didn't have\nnothing but what we had in the bank. We lost everything. Stalin took away all the few\npennies which we got it together. And I went on a trip to Belgium because of the fact\nthat they asked me. They want I should could come there. They want to talk with me\nabout a new contract. Because I am doing good and all that, I had to go to Berlin. And I\ncame in Berlin. I have relatives. My mother had a aunt living in Berlin, and she was a\nbeautiful girl. And the owner, her son, from the tobacco factory --___ \u2014=\u2014=\u2014s who was a\nfactory -- fell in love with her and they got married, and she became a rich girl. Then\nwhen my mother send her a letter said want I should became a doctor and she should give\nme aroom in her house. Well, and nothing could be worked out with all that, with all the\nwoman. And then in 1939, September 8th, I was in Belgium. I was in Belgium to the\nfactory. I was making a contract for the Karmann Ghia. Kristallnacht. You heard about\nKristallnacht? It was the night of Kristallnacht. I didn't know for nothing. I came, and\nmother told me and say I should take for her aunt a kilo bada (ph) and to take some -- a\nfew cheese, and she felt sorry for you, poor relatives they had. But I took it with me and\ngave it to them, to my mother's aunt, and I run in not knowingly in the Holocaust in the --\nnot in the Holocaust, in the Kristallnacht. What means -- Kristallnacht means crystal,\nbreaking windows, breaking in, the burning stores. Was a tremendous big store I was --\nbefore the war I used to go there, and in house father owned in Germany. And in that\nstore I used to -- anything -- they used to mark -- anybody who wants to make money\ngets $5 when he comes in here -- in Israel and goes to the colby (ph) store -- and go in the\nstore and ask for a product and can't find it, gets 5 mark. A premium for that. That's how\nproud they were with each other. And it was the next year I came there, but it was when\nit was Kristallnacht. All ready all over the streets \"Juden_\u2014\u2014s Traboden\" (ph) for the\nJews, the Jews not welcome. The Jews cannot come no more into the store. So we didn't\ngo there no more, because they took away the cars from the Jews and they took away the\nbusinesses, took away the bank accounts. Anything they had, they lost it. Then we\nstopped going. And then Hitler -- I mean Churchill used to -- on shortwave radio used to\nand tell Stalin, \"Be careful, Stalin, you're going to lose your head.\" And then, \"Your\ngood friend Stalin is getting prepared to fight you.\" And this was Ribbentrop. Stalin sent\nhis secretary of state Ribbentrop and -- no, the Hitler sent Ribbentrop and Stalin sent\nMolitof (ph). Molitof was for Stalin. They had been getting together one against the\nother keeping -- they didn't know what was going on until Churchill got into the act and\nstarted World War II.",
        "Q:Let me ask you a few personal questions here. You saw what was going on in Europe?",
        "A:Right.",
        "Q:You went back to Lithuania. Did you have any sense that the life you had in Lithuania would\nchange so dramatically?",
        "A:No. We had -- We had a feeling that -- but to kill people, that the Lithuanians would kill Jews.\nFriends which have been with all our life, which I have been staying with them going\nthrough law school, I couldn't imagine that that should happen like that. It was\nunbelievable, that we didn't even -- I had a big opportunity to go, but I was already\nmarried. I had a little child. Jay was four at that time, and I -- my hand was tied. I still\nsay, oh, it still not so bad. It still only right now who is closed (ph) is the poor little Jews,\nand the poor little Jews used to come to Lithuanian to find a place of where to hide,\nwhere to live. And I was in that time a young lawyer. I still could take cases, but I -- but\nthey used to come to me. They open up a office in Vilnius. Vilnius is the capital city of\nPoland right now, too. And I've been working out with them papers that they should be\nable to go to Japan. The only place that was open for the Jews to go in that time was for\nJapan, and everybody was running. But they had to get a visa, a visa from the Jewish\nCouncil. And they find out about me, and, you know, some of them had money to pay\nfor my work and some of them didn't have any money even. There was -- or they moved\n-- or the council moved away to Latvia -- Riga was the capital for Latvia -- ran away\nthere. I had to go over with them to help them there. It was -- it was rough. But I still\nhad my home. I didn't have to worry about Hitler, nothing. Only the Polish Jew had the\nproblem. That we knew through them that it's no good. They came from Russia or from\nall this stuff -- the old timers, little towns, come from all over, run into Lithuanian to\nbecome a place where to live.",
        "Q:Let me -- when you were talking about getting the visas for Japan.",
        "A:Right.",
        "Q:Tell me a little bit more about that. Who were you working with? Was that all legal or was\nthat difficult?",
        "A:No, it was not difficult, but two years ago it was the council who done -- what give visas. He\ndidn't have the right to give, but he give it the visa. Nobody knows he gave out -- about\n5,000 visas he gave out. It was not legal. If it was legal to travel, it was legal to receive\nit. But his government didn't told him he should give visas, but at the same time his\ngovernment also keep a closed eye, didn't see nothing what's coming at all. But that was\na good man, and he decided to help Jews, Jews in that --",
        "Q:Did you know him?",
        "A:I knew him -- right. I knew him before the war.",
        "Q:What was his name?",
        "A:Oh, I can't tell you.",
        "Q:Was it Sugihara (ph)?",
        "A:I think something like that. Why, you knew him? You heard of him?",
        "Q:Yeah. I was wanting to know a little more about him if you knew him personally.",
        "A:No. I don't remember so much, no. It was a lot of pain there, too. I remember it was a case I\nreceived a visa for a tenor, a singer. Schwartz was his name. He was a terrific opera\nsinger. And he received a visa, but his name was Silver. And -- now I remember, the\nname of Silver come up a day before and took away the wrong -- the visa with -- the men\nhad to get it, and he got it, the visa, and went to Japan. Later on it was a little easier\nbecause South Africa also had been given some -- letting in some Jews and it wasn't so\nbad. Then -- well, one day hell broke loose. Lithuanian or Kovno or Slobodka, was in\nthe valley surrounded by mountains. Beautiful, beautiful in nature. There was a little\ncabin with -- Napoleon built it, and there were a lot of people who was going -- all kind\nof talented people were going there in that little cabin painting and writing. It was a\nfamous writer of All Mapoo (ph), and he wrote two books, it was about that little house.\nIt was terrific. And the university been built it there, the engineering department. When\nthe party (ph) go and the people been living there. And it was everybody were happy.\nEverybody been in its place. It was status quo for years. And here, boom, Hitler didn't\nsay nothing, didn't announce that they . In fact, Stalin -- Stalin was living in the\n. I was in Moscow from time of the war. I was the only for a month. I had to go to get\nsupplies. Well, it's so much stuff of there to talk.",
        "Q:Wait, I want to be clear on this. When the Russians took over in 1940 --",
        "A:Uh-huh.",
        "Q:-- you lost your money. Did you continue in the motorcycle business or did you do something\nelse?",
        "A:I couldn't. The Russians confiscated everything. There was no private industry.",
        "Q:So what did you do?",
        "A:It was bad. I went to work with older already at the airport. You see what's happened,\nLithuanian didn't have a airport. It was a big mud -- mud field. When it used was to\nsnow and water, they didn't have any ground. And they had to have a airport because the\nwar was going away in Moscow. Hitler been pushing Stalin, that he wants to take\nMoscow and didn't have no airport. That's why they got to have a place to let the planes\ngo, and that's what he started with pushing strong. But Moscow was saved by the\nSiberiacs (ph), they call it, small, little people. They were mean, and they were ones who\nstopped Hitler by 15 miles from Moscow. Couldn't move. And that's why they start\nlosing with Stalingrad and start losing the war.",
        "Q:When were you in Moscow, do you remember?",
        "A:Moscow in 1943.",
        "Q:Later. Okay.",
        "A:Right.",
        "Q:All right. So you said that everything changed when the Germans came in; 1s that right?",
        "A:Right.",
        "Q:Can you tell me what you were doing, what happened?",
        "A:You know, when the war broke, we all -- it was on a Sunday morning. We all run out in the\nstreets. It was 5:00 o'clock in the morning, and we didn't know what's going on. We was\n-- we get -- people got so lost. They was running like wild. Run into me, \"What you\ngoing to do?\" Run into them, \"What you going to do? Are you going by train? Are you\ngoing by boat? How are you going to run away?\" People got confused. You wouldn't\nbelieve it. You know, \"What's happening?\" Hitler dropped two bombs. One bomb they\ndropped right over the railroad bridge. It's they wanted the bridge to be destroyed.\nAnother one they dropped right by Slobodka. There was a big field, that' what all the\nselection was, those who live and those who die. Then -- then people didn't know what to\ndo. And I was working in that time in the transportation company. Worked with the\ntransportation horse and buggies. Around 50 horse and buggies, I don't know, got\ntogether, and I was their secretary, organized the horse and buggy transportation\ncommittee, and we made a living from that. It's as long you were a tail (ph), you went in\nthe system from Stalin, Stalin was happy. Then he didn't bother us that we made a living.\nAs soon as Stalin used to come with the all kind of directions, you already lost. You had\ntroubles. And then when the in that time we had a week without a government.\nYou see, even the Germans, the murderers, couldn't take it no more when they find out\nwhat the Germans -- the Lithuanians doing to the Jews. They made pogroms. You know\nwhat a pogrom is? They been attacking them. And if you had a street, you would go.\nYou will go the long street, go from the bridge going on the way -- there was a way going\nyou could go to Moscow. If you go to Moscow and you got a car and you can go fast, I\ncan understand. But here, they are going with little children, pushing children's carts,\npushing to Moscow. But from Moscow -- from Kovno to Moscow was 1175 miles, and\nthey going with horse and buggy. And they'll never can reach there, because here was\nalready flying the Germans airplanes dropping them over the walking people and killing\npeople in the street. You could see here, boom, right lane already send people been killed\ngoing to Moscow. They couldn't go nowhere. You had to turn around and go back\nhome. We had no choice. And I had a little girl, a little girl who was three months old. I\nhad to go with girl, and I had a horse and buggy, but the copper wheels they had before\nthey were, and it wasn't. I was the owner -- the , not the owner. The owner was Stalin.\nAnd I went there and I took him. There was nobody. \"Where is the manager?\" The\nmanager took also one and he run away. Then I took that horse and buggy, and I went on\nthe way to Moscow, but went until 50 miles I had to turn around and go back. Then I go\nin back, Edna tells me -- my wife tells me, \"I got to have milk for the girl.\" I went out to\nthe farmer house and I talk with the farmer and his wife, see if they can sell me some\nmilk. They sold me some milk. And they said, \"Where are you going?\" I say, \"I am\ngoing to Kaunas.\" \"Don't go,\" they tell me, \"Don't go. They're killing Jews, and they\ngoing to kill you. You stay away from this road.\" The farmer -- I was lucky -- they told\nme. And I told to Edna, I say, \"You know, Edna, we better go with the bad streets,\nsecond way road, not to go with the highway. The highway we'll go, we'll get running in\nwith the people taking to the fortress where they're killing Jews. Isn't that the way -- we\nstart going to the worser place. Not to go for the highway, but to go where the second --\nsecond grade road. And that saved our life. And we came in Slobodka. I see my father\n-- or my grandfather and Edna's father -- Edna's was the second, her mother married\ntwice -- going in front of us. I say -- going face run into us. I say, \"What's the matter?\"\n\"Are you survived? Gosh, you're lucky.\" And I looked at Edna's father. His hair 1s\nwhite. He was a black-headed man, and he looked terrible. I say, \"What's happened?\"\nHe said, \"Don't ask. There is -- they're still laying.\" He said, \"Last night they killed all\nthe Jews. They kill the blacksmith,\" whom I know, \"and the printer,\" whom I know. The\nman from the Zionist organization, they killed him. They killed -- from house to house\nthey been walking and killnow Jews __ the street. Killed close to a hundred people.\nAnd like it was terrible. I went up in the attic and looked a little. All along the killed\npeople laying in the back of the street. And next day they went running, the Lithuanians,\nfrom house to house picking a group of murdered people, and the cemetery wasn't too far,\nand they bury them and in probably grave. And it was terrible. Since then, I decide not\nto go out even for the street, and __\u2014_\u2014sd[. don''t know it's interested. I don't know. It was\nvery -- a very religious man came to me. Before the war was a famous rabbi, Rabbi Itrac\nElholan (ph). They have here a lot of seminars in that man's name. He was a very, very,\nhigh educated, religious man. Called him Itrac Elholan. And his assistant, assistant\nrabbi, the assistant rabbi came to me. I was home, and he tell me I got to help the Jews. I\nsaid, \"I got to help the Jews? What are you talking about?\" He said, \"You got see\nJordan. We got now a Gestapo lieutenant. He's terrible, killing all the people.\" I say,\n\"What you mean? He say, \"He's in charge over the Jews, and it's all give the right to the\nLithuanians, do with the Jews what you want. Kill them. Do them. We want to liquidate\nthe Jews people.\" That's what he say. I say, \"What do you want from me?\" He say,\n\"You had when you were in your younger days,\" he tells me about this story of Esther in\nthe bible. You know, Esther. You know Esther. And Esther also went to Ahasuerus, to\nthe king, and to Babylonians, and asked mercy for the Jews then, and they survived.\nHaman was the murderer, the one to kill all the Jews, but Esther saved their life. And it\nwhat he want now. I got here in ghetto now such a beautiful girl and her husband, and\nshe's willing to go and talk to Jordan he should save the Jews, not to kill the Jews. And\nshe don't care about her life. They can kill her. She's going. \"What you want now?\"\n\"And now I want you\" -- that I should go and talk with Jordan, the German lieutenant that\nwas in charge, and ask him for mercy to help the Jews. Well, I say \"Yeah, but the girl\ndoes it, and let's find out. \"Yeah,\" I say, \"I'll do it.\" I went, and I almost got killed right\nby his door. You see, I open up the door. I went into his office, and he say, \"What you\ndoing? What you want?\" I say, \"I got to speak to you.\" And I tell (ph) him with his title,\nand -- Gestapo title, and he jump to his gun and grabbed the gun and start shoot. And he\nstart shooting. I run, and I took off right behind the building and come back in ghetto. I\nwas lucky that that thing was cold, because in that time I seen -- we had a sexton in by\nthe Gestapo building, what they call it? What it was La Tucas (ph). That is Ukus (ph)\nmeans let the Lithuanian Ukus, th crown department from the Lithuanians. And I come\nrunning, and they -- I see in there, they put in Jews right in that La Tucas gate. There is a\nbig yard surrounded with the wire, barbed wire, and they put that place on fire. And the\nstaysand__ go, and put it by the match and blew up the place. And didn't the people\nto run out to save their life. They didn't let us go, just stay and shooting them. And they\nbeen catching Jews in the street and taking them to jail. They callthe \u2014s ayjail. They\ncall it tomb. They're packed up. The jail full. And here it was for a month in jail. I was\nlucky to get out because I had a pack of cigarettes, but I have to give one cigarette at a\ntime to certain people to see how to move out from the jail. I got out of jail and come\nback home.",
        "Q:How long were you in the jail?",
        "A:A month.",
        "Q:A whole month? Your family, did they -- did you see them?",
        "A:No, I didn't see them, but I didn't have no choice of -- I trying to go in there when I could. But\nthen it would start I signed up for to work at the airport. I work at the -- I will be\nagreeable to work at the airport, they could let me out from jail. But what's the thing, the\nJewish people that were afraid to go to work. And the airport was the worsest working\nplace where the person can get -- how the ghetto exist? The ghetto been existing from\ncabbage, what the Germans been giving the Jews for working for the airport. The airport\nwas a company, a German company, by the name of Mole (ph), Mole Company. Mole\nCompany to cover the building of fixing up that airport that they should have a place\nwhere to come down with the planes. And they used to have a rough time to get workers.\nJews didn't want to -- want to work. They did not get nothing to eat and didn't get any\nplace to work. They say they're better one to get killed. They don't want to go at airport.\nThat's ___\u2014_\u2014s what the wife tell before. And they decide not to go to work. So Jordan\ncame himself one early morning and start -- and it was the four Jews. They evading the\nplace where not to go to work, and he kill all the four without even asking, nothing. They\ndidn't done a thing. But he want to scare the Jews when they gave the order to go to work\nto airport -- and at airport doesn't mean nothing -- they got to go to work. And then they\nmade no choice, got to go to the airport. Go to the airport to work was no picnic. There\nwas nothing to eat. It's what I say. They used to give us a lunch, cabbage with water.\nOnce a month that's the little slice of meat, but it was horse meat. They used to bring\ndead horses, killing them, and give them to the Jews for meat. It was -- it was a terrible.\nBut you didn't have no choice. I lost two fingers. I've been staying and working -- the\nway they do it to make the airport, to build the airport, they been bringing gravel and put\nitin____ full for the farmer to bring 1n so many buckets of gravel, and put the gravel on\ntop, and putting the 12-feet high -- no, it was 12 -- they had 12-feet high. No, 36. It was\nI say 36 feet tall wooden block, and then on top of the gravel, and it would make a hard\nsurface, a hard bottom that the planes, the German planes, should be able to come. And\nthey stopped up to 15 miles from Moscow. And it was the night when I decide I better go\nto the airport to work. I don't want to go to work no more ___ brigade, we'd be\npackage -- a package house. We'd be with -- all the Jews will be with me, too. And I\ntold Edna and I say, \"Edna, I cannot -- I am going to the airport.\" And her father tells me,\n\"Tam going with you, too,\" and one of her brothers. Three of us, we went to work for the\nairport. And every time in the morning, 7:00 o'clock in the morning, we used to come\ntrucks, loading us up on trucks, and taking it to the airport. And then we doing the\nall-day work until 9:00, 10:00 o'clock at night, because they been pushing hard. They\nneeded the airport it should start function. And that what we been happy. Happy was\nnothing to eat, but better than nothing. Airport was___\u2014\u00ab.~ We had a uncle, a farmer,\nand it was a rich farmer, because he had the cattle and he had the horses. And the farmer,\na neighbor of his, he used to come to him to his mother. Old, old woman. She was in the\n80s. Come in to her and say, \"Youngkalova (ph),\" it was her name, \"how is?\" \"I'm in\ntrouble, sir.\" A woman -- the old woman come and cry and say, \"I need a cow. We don't\nhave any milk to drink. Nothing.\" So gave him a cow. \"Go pick yourself out a cow and\nbe happy.\" Another one used to come around, \"We need a horse. We don't have a horse\nto work. They are filled.\" He'd been helping everyone, and they didn't forgot it. You\nsee, people nowadays ___ think when they head in the right direction, you bring -- you\ncan teach him into be a murderer, and he'll become a murderer. You can also at the same\ntime to teach them to be become a rabbi, and he can be a rabbi. It's like now we have it\nin Israel, Rabin. Yeah, it's -- you can't blame everything on the murderer. The murderer\nbeen brought up maybe the wrong way with the ___\u2014\u2014. And I be saying it all the time.\nIt's wrong, we been going in the wrong direction. Well, well, then got to -- then I am\ngoing and -- decide that to stay at the airport a long time, not so hot. I am -- it's a very\nbad brigade. I'll have to find me another one. In between time, then they, the _,\ndecide I got to goto the Albert \u2014\u2014_\u2014, and ask what I would not succeeded. I wouldn't\nhelp. I would thinking. But Iam thinking. I come in and worked with the farmer. He\ncame in with a wagon of gravel, and I had to unload it. And then the girls used to take\nthem and shovel it with their father, and their father would bring it up. And it used work\nmaybe by 50,000 people -- lots of soldiers and Jews -- and building the airport. Then a\nman comes to the wagon of gravel. I ask him, a Lithuanian, he's a Lithuania farmer,\n\"Where are you from?\" He tells me, \"I'm from. Tsay\" _\u2014_si\u00a3\" The nameis\nfamiliar. I say, \"What you doing?\" And he say, \"I'm a farmer.\" \"What you doing here?\"\nHe said, \"We got a order from Hitler that we got to bring so many wagon of gravel, and\nhe don't care were it be.\" I say, \"75 miles away?\" He said what he cares. It will take him\na month to bring the wagon with gravel, but he going to have 10,000 wagon gravel to\nbuild airport. That's all what he's interested in, that's the way he figure. And I say, \"Why\n--yousay__\u2014_\u2014?\"\": '\"\"Yes.\" Tsay, \"Could it be youare from __\u2014\u2014?\":~*He say, \"Yeah. 75\nmiles from here.\" I said, \"Wait a minute. Maybe you hear from the Jew by the name of\nItska Kolominski (ph).\" He opens up his eyes. \"Yeah,\" and looks around, \"He's a Jew.\"\nI say, \"I know he's a Jew.\" \"Who is he?\" He say, \"He's my neighbor. Itska Kolominski,\nhe never went in the ghetto. He didn't go in.\" I say to him, \"Well, where is he now?\" He\nsay, \"He's in hiding. We hiding him. The farmer's already been hiding him because he\ndone him so good and helped him. They pay him back. And they -- he been in hiding.\"\nAnd I say, \"Can you take a letter to him?\" He say \"Sure.\" And I took a piece of paper, I\nwrite up a letter. I told him that his family already, he don't have nobody left, only me\nand Edna and Jay, because her parents she got into the __, they took away her family.\nSo the rest of the family, they only going to take itto__; therefore, yes.",
        "Q:What period of time are you talking about now? You're further ahead, aren't you?",
        "A:Right. Right. I --",
        "Q:You're talking in 1943, now?",
        "A:Right.",
        "Q:Okay. I just wanted to be clear.",
        "A:Right. Right.",
        "Q:Let you finish.",
        "A:And then I went -- we decide -- yeah, 1n that time decided take these little children, called a\nkinderatzen (ph), and they taken and killed all the little kids. Then I told Edna, I say,\n\"Well, we got to run.\" She say, \"What you mean we got to run?\" \"You lost your family;\nyou have nobody. I got my family, they also. I ask, and we got to do something.\" And\nwe still organizing. I say, \"We got to go fast. We cannot play. We got to move it. We\ngot to see to get out of that situation.\" And she say, \"Well, how are we going do that?\" I\nsay -- I told her I sent a letter to her uncle and see what if come the answer. Ina\nmonth, not quite a month, the farmer come back and from her uncle a letter. And he\nwrites he's willing to. He got to save the family. It's all that's left. Let's do something. I\nsay -- \"You come to here, and I'll try to protect you, to help you,\" the farmer said. And\nwe done it, run away from the ghetto.",
        "Q:When was this? When did you leave the ghetto?",
        "A:1943.",
        "Q:Spring, fall?",
        "A:November. November 26th.",
        "Q:Now, all of this time, from the early part of the ghetto in the summer of 1941 until '43, you\nwere working at the airport?",
        "A:Right.",
        "Q:The whole time?",
        "A:The whole time. I think that -- it was hard to get in good place. You didn't have no choice.\nYou got to work. That's all I got -- started up with the police, and they say not to go to\nwork. They say it's terrible. And then we got to go in and fight, and start fighting with\nall that mess. Even I have a lot of people who I knew very well, with whom I went to the\nschool together. Here's Golub. You maybe heard. You got it -- you talk yesterday here\nabout a book he wrote about a ghetto, ghetto day by day, and he's become now professor.",
        "Q:What is the name we know him by?",
        "A:You'll know him by the name of -- he wrote a book, ghetto day by day.",
        "Q:Right. Are you talking about Avraham Tory?",
        "A:Right. Avraham Tory. that's it. You met him? He went to school with me in high\u2019school, in\ncollege. He's also a lawyer. We went to all -- and he was -- what is the Gestapo? .\nNo, I forgot his name. The head of the Gestapo. He was his secretary. Golub was --\nAvraham Golub, Tory, was his helper. Well, and -- what I stop --",
        "Q:Well, you were saying that you knew a lot of people, but you still were working 1n the airport.",
        "A:Right. Right. Well, then, we took -- I wrote a letter to an uncle that we want to come to him.\nAnd he hired -- he got another farmer, which he helped a lot. Marches (ph).",
        "Q:Okay. I don't want to get on that quite yet.",
        "A:Right. I know what you --",
        "Q:I want to ask you a lot more about the ghetto life.",
        "A:Right.",
        "Q:And we have a few more minutes on this tape, so should I just ask you some --",
        "A:Yeah.",
        "Q:Okay. When you -- when the ghetto was formed, you were already living in that area or you\nhad to move? What happened?",
        "A:No. I was living already in that area. I forgot it. What the biggest problem, it's what's should\ncome up and I forgot to mention to talk, and I got to talk now, 1s the selections, left and\nright, who should live and who should die. I got to go over that, too.",
        "Q:Yeah, we'll get to all of that. But I'm just trying -- let's go back a little bit to the summer of\n1941 and how the ghetto came about.",
        "A:Right. Well, after the pograms and after the Lithuanians got happy and killed the Jews, they\ndecide, the Germans, to get over, and the Germans start get bringing more to order,\nbecause they find out that way, the way the Lithuanians went, they'll never accomplish\nnothing, and it would be bad for the Jews and bad for the Lithuanians. They got -- they\ngot to get it straight, and it's what they started to straighten them up. And then we\ndecided to run out of ghetto. One night I got Jay ready and talked to Edna, talk to him a\ncouple times. But he was a kid, five years. I got to get him in his mind that he should\nlisten, because we were afraid to take and do something. And the only way we could\ntake him out from the ghetto was to put him in -- in the small ghetto was a place where\nthey run -- people been running out from the small ghetto to the big ghetto. And that's\nthe way they survived, together they run out in the part of Lithuania in the fields, in the\nwoods. Oh, but Hitler decided he got to kill every one, and Himmler gave the victory\norder to get the Jews locked up and get rid of them, to have the Ninth Fortress, and they\ngot to kill them. The first thing they done is get a order that the Jews not allowed to walk\nthe sidewalk. They got to use the gutter. They walk in the gutter. The Jews, the second\ndecree -- Hitler was in Golub's book, I think, saying the same thing. The second degree\nwas when the Jews got to wear the star of David on the front and in the back. Why on\nboth sides when the one side would be enough? They say, no, when they see a Jew they\ngot to kill him. That is a point where they set up the shotgun or the rifle to -- star of\nDavid, to kill him. And a Jew doesn't have the right to have a car. They took away the\ncars from them. A Jew don't have the right to have a secretary, to have an accountant to\nwork for him. Nothing. And it was rough. But -- and the Jew -- and the main thing, they\ngot to go to work at the airport. And we'll pick them up 7:00 o'clock in the mrning every\nday and take them to the airport to work. And it was also the airport there to work. It's\nJordan, he was the one in that time. He was Miller, the head from the Gestapo, he was\nhis assistant. And Avraham Tory worked also with the same Miller.",
        "Q:I -- unfortunately I have to stop you because the tape is finished; so we need to change the tape\nand then begin again.",
        "A: Okay.\nEnd of Tape 1\nTape 2",
        "Q:Okay. I just wanted to clarify a few points you made earlier. You talked about trying to get\nout of Lithuania in the very beginning when the Germans came in and how you were able\nto get horses and buggies and all of this, even though it didn't work. Why 1s -- did\neverybody have that opportunity?",
        "A:No. You see, when the war -- on a Sunday morning, the Germans were commencing to drop\ntwo bombs: the one on the way to the bridge and another one right close to the ghetto.\nAnd they were what scared the living out of many people. This special bomb must be\nsuch a blast that everybody not run out -- fall out from bed and come running out outside.\nAnd didn't know what to do, had the people like crazy. It maybe was thousand people in\nthe street waiting for a solution. Somebody said \"Help them.\" Even it got so confused is\nwhen the younger couples who was, where they only had to go to the railroad station.\nThe communists kept a train at the train station for almost a full day begging everybody\nto go in the train and go to Moscow. They want to -- they are willing to carry them to\nMoscow, and the train was staying there. And they wait and they didn't go and they\ndidn't use their opportunity and they got killed. You see, other ones went with horse and\nbuggy. Where they got the horse and buggy? They had a cooperative, a cooperative, to\ntell the Russian people. They had to tell what all the private horse and buggy people.\nLike I got uncles, my three uncles, they were owners. The horse and buggy they want\nonly to belong to the cooperative, because they were afraid for the Russians. They say\nwho -- those who work, those who eat. And they were so scared that they don't go get\nany food, that they board a horse and buggy and joined up into the transportation\ncooperation that they should say that they got some work and they been doing work. And\nwork, what they made a living out of it. And how is me by being educated? And I got\nmy two uncles, three uncles, right in the board of that cooperation. Through their\ninfluence, I been accepted on the job to be their bookkeeper. Then I went carrying their\nbooks, and I got calls, people been calling in. They want to bring -- they found each\nother, they want to bring up a safe on first floor, on the second floor, all that kind of\nwork. They used to call mein. I used to give it all to the dispatchers, and they used to do\nthe work. And then it's the way we've been working with the transportation. With me, if\nyou had a place like a stable, a lot stable, which we kept about 30 horses with wagons,\nand people were running to that place there for a horse and the wagon. They go off with\nthe horse and wagon. Was going to Moscow, going to save himself in Moscow. Going\n1800 miles, go over in the horse and wagon. They didn't realize they what foolishness\nthey were trying to do, but when a person is scared and the devil is after him and chasing\nhim, they don't have no choice. They do a lot of things what is not real for a regular\nperson. But they done it. The Germans were on top flying over the heads with the little\nplanes. Lithuania only had two paper cups, I call it, two of them. They didn't have any\nmore. It was a poor nation. That's all they had. They had eggs plenty, chickens, turkey.\nThat kind of items they have: food to eat. And that's what they struggle even right now,\nhere right at the present time, with the sand all what's going on. There the\nLithuanians all struggle to the Russians. Can't help it. They'll have to have a war. I don't\nknow why. I hope not, but what the way it's happened, the way it's going on, it's big\ntroubles. Because the Russian who been born 50 years ago is now a man of 50 years. He\nmay be educated, maybe he's a doctor, a lawyer, and here he cannot practice no more and\nhe's got to move on. And he say, \"What, it's my country.\" He say, \"I was born here.\"\nAnd you see this all coming up. It's all kind of problems is developing. And the\nLithuanians from their side was trying to do the best they can, and they can't do it and it\ndoesn't work. Well, when they got in, the Germans, and the Lithuanians lose, it were the\nLithuanians done the biggest mistake: kill the Jews. It's not kill the Jews; it's destroying\nthe Jewish nation. The Jews done so much good for them. And even right now they been\ngoing and asking in Israel for help, because they got to go to France, they got to go to\nEngland, they got to go the States, seeing that to recognize their independence, to\nrecognize them as a nation. I one time came to the German Council in Richmond, and I\nwas right at a meeting speaking to us, and I ask him a question. I say, \"Would you tell\nme what's happened to Kennicksburg (ph)?\" Kennicksburg is one of the largest cities in\nnorth Germany, and there was a population of around 5 million German, and the\nLithuanians took in maybe 5 million Germans. It wouldn't be a Lithuania. And the\nproblem is -- the United Nations all have problems how to get it straight again. It's\nheadaches -- Europe 1s in problems.",
        "Q:Right. Okay. But --",
        "A: Well, then, they came. When the Germans decided to get the force, the labor force, was we\nwere locked up, 17,000 Jews, in Slobodka before the war started with Hitler and Stalin.\nAnd they -- I got to think.",
        "Q:Let me -- let's go back a minute. I've now learned that you were -- you had a good position in\nthe transportation cooperative, because of your education and your uncles and your\nfamily. Why did somebody in the community come to you in the beginning to go talk to\nJordan?",
        "A:Jordan was the lieutenant.",
        "Q:Yeah.",
        "A:Because they -- that rabbi knew me personally from way before the war. He was the President\nSmetona's good friend. And anything -- when he had to write a letter or something or\nsomething to ask the President Smetona for help, he used to come to me and ask me I\nshould write him in the Lithuania language a letter. Or when he used to send a letter to\nRoosevelt right in the States, he used to come also to me and ask me to help him to write\nin English, even when I didn't know the English language. He didn't took \"No\" for an\nanswer. I say, \"Your own sister-in-law works for Shell,\" Shell company, the gasoline. I\nsay, \"Why don't you go to your own sister-in-law? She can help you more in this case\nthan I can.\" But he didn't want to. He want me. And I couldn't help him. To satisfy him\nI say maybe I'll -- maybe he's an ordinary person who got feelings. I'll go. What am I\ngoing to lose? More so than the death, it couldn't be. And I went. And I went to the side\nstreets. I know to the university was right there. Then I used to go every night and knew\nthe places where to go. I went, but I almost got my head cut off.",
        "Q:So because of your education, you were able to help people in ways that maybe some people\ncould not?",
        "A:Not, no. I couldn't. Everybody had -- in the ghetto was such a life that everybody got to help\nthemself. You don't help yourself, you lost. And nobody could help you.",
        "Q:So after a while the education didn't matter?",
        "A:Didn't matter. It matter was a good little corner where there is room in the living, can serve\nyou a loaf of bread for a -- a two pair of stockings for a woman. Or earrings, with a\ngolden earing. You see, when also the Germans come out with the decree, they want to\nhave the Jewish people should give all their gold, jewelry, and diamonds, to turn it in into\nthe central committee. And they -- later on they'll have new orders, and when they got\nthat order, and the Jews, not so dumb, were giving away all their valuables for they had it\nfor years. Then some of them -- one was my father-in-law. Took out a brick from the\nwall, and done such a beautiful job that you couldn't tell. He put in his gold _ watch, he\nputting in -- his wife had a chain, a golden chain around her neck that's plain solid gold.\nHe took that and put it all in the hole from the brick, and put it over with tape, taped it up,\nand you couldn't even tell. And it come up after we come after we got liberated, we went\nand got to find the gold pieces right in the wall where he put it in. And then it was --\nwell, this is one item. And then we went and then to go to work at the airport -- no, it\nwas the second time, then the Germans decided they got to have the airport still done,\nwith the company, it was a German company, been building the airport. And everybody\nhad to go to work regardless. It took all the brigades and turn around and send all of\nthem to the airport delivering gravel to help the airport done. And they done it in a hurry,\nin no time, but they work day and night. And one brigade I work at night, I cut my\nfingers off.",
        "Q:Let me now, let's just talk about the ghetto for a while; okay?",
        "A:Okay.",
        "Q:If you don't mind. You said before that after the Germans took over there were all kinds of\nlaws, what Jews could and could not do. Then soon after, did they decide you had to go\nlive in a ghetto? When did that happen?",
        "A:No. They -- all of they gave that the Jews had the right they should build theirself a ghetto.\nAnd what they done from the Jewish people theirself, to pick out a large brigade, what\nthey went in in the ghetto with barbed wire in the section with 27,000 Jews lived in it.\nThey surrounded them with barbed wire, and had Jewish police with helpers staying there\nat the gate, where you going in and going out from the ghetto, staying there and helping\nthe Germans who getting already there -- you say to German soldier and just stay the\nJewish with young men, and all day long stand by the gate to help each other how to not\nto run in any troubles. To help there shouldn't be any shooting, shouldn't be any killing.\nAnd then that's the way they stay there and build the ghetto. And not that the ghetto was\nfinished. Was in August\u2019 15, 1941, that's when they got finished, and they started in June\n29th in 1941.",
        "Q:Now, did you have to move into this ghetto?",
        "A:No, I didn't, because I lived there already. My whole family -- my family and Edna's family,\nwe all were in that same apartment. We had been sleeping four, five people in one room\non the floor, but we didn't want to move away. You stay -- better stay in the one place\nand not to keep moving around. And we -- we been there all the time. Since I got\nmarried, I was in together with them, and we stay all in the same place. And only when\nthey need the help -- they used to come, the Germans, right on the corner where I lived,\ncome with trucks and pick them up and take them to work. And one thing would just\nhappen. When they come with trucks to work, it can -- this idea was from the mayor\nfrom Kovno, from Kaunas, came with a smart idea. He come to Jordan, and told Jordan\nthat he got to do -- to get more people to do work, and the people are not coming.\nSomething, they got to do to keep them moving. And they came in one day and shot four\npeople by the gate by coming in and going out to scare the Jews. And when they all\ncome here, they shouldn't run, they should go to work. And it come -- he come up with\nthe idea that he need 530 -- 500 people he need first. And he got to have young people.\nWhat he need them? He need them for the archives, because of the communists run away\nand left behind him so many papers, so many archives, in the Russian language, and the\nJews knew Russian language perfect, that the Jews should go and help the -- how to take\nout the paper and check them, and then know what's all about them in the paper. And\nwho was idea is? The idea was the mayor from Kaunas; he suggested it. And they took\nfive -- placed the 500 -- 534 people came. And all of the 534 young people -- boyfriends\nof mine, cousins of mine, a lot of people whom I knew, a lot of them I went to school\ntogether. All this appeared at night and everybody was there. They kill them the same\nnight. When they took them out 7:00 o'clock in the morning, by 10:00 o'clock at night\nthey all were dead.",
        "Q:Now, why didn't you have to go with them?",
        "A:That's what I don't know. A power in me told me not to go. I just until this day ask -- rabbis\nask people why I didn't -- I stayed with them. And there was my house. And I told it to\nmy buddy next to me, I say, \"You know, I kind of feel funny. I don't think I'll go.\" He\nsay, \"You're crazy. What you going to do all day long here with the woman. They'll run\nyou nuts. Where my husband, where 1s this and that. Stay here. They don't come in time\nback, it will be murder.\" But, I said, \"Nope. I'm sorry. I'm not going. You want to go\nwith me, let's go.\" \"No,\" he say, \"I'm going,\" and he went with them. And I went back to\nthe office from the committee. What we call them? You know, I went to the central\ncommittee office with Dr. Elkes, the head man was there, and Avraham Tory, his office\nwas there. I went back there and to find out what's going on. I come in there. There is a\ngood friend of mine and a good friend of Edna, worked for his brother. He gives me --\ngrabs me and he want I should go with the 534. And something in me gets me power in\nme, I should get rid of him. I say, \"Now, look Isaaci (ph)\" -- his name was Isaac. I say,\n\"Don't play with me. I come to ask you what's going on with 534? What's happening to\nthe young men? What do you want me to push there? What's the interest you got in\nme?\" He say, \"Look, I don't want nothing. You go with them.\" And it made me hot. I\nhad -- I had to knock him in his nose. I didn't want to do him any harm, but he -- my life\ndepended and he stops me. It was three, four cases like this in the ghetto.",
        "Q:So nobody forced you or --",
        "A:He forced me? Nobody forced me, no. No.",
        "Q:Now, all of the people who didn't live in the ghetto area before --",
        "A:Uh-huh.",
        "Q:-- how did they come in? I mean, how did they find places? Was there some organization to\nhelp them?",
        "A:No. It was going -- because Hitler or the Gestapo let them until August 15 we got to have a\nghetto created. We got to have also until September\u2019 15 a bridge made, and then they\nwent to -- we went to work. The people who didn't live in the ghetto who went to work\nand helped build the ghetto, because they find out that is safer, because they say they've\nbeen guarded by the German, guarded by the Jews, and we don't have to worry about it so\nmuch at night when you go to sleep that somebody will wake you up and take you out\nand beat you and kill you and all, what they call it, selections. The 534 was a selection.\nThey picked out the young men, and it is the cream of the crop for many reasons. Not\nonly for the paperwork, but they were a power. It was an underground it was in the 534.\nIt what the ghetto needed, and the young people understood it, but they were not ready. It\nwasn't so simple to do. But the main reason was that they should be organized to get\nsomething to fight the German before they go in the ghetto.",
        "Q:Okay. But all of the people who maybe lived not in Slobodka before the war, they had to\ncome to the ghetto also?",
        "A:Right.",
        "Q:Did anyone help them or did they just sort of come over there and find places?",
        "A:No. It was like one went to the other neighbor or a friend whom he knew or a friend who\ncame in and swapped the houses, swapped rooms. It been swapping. \"Here you take\nmine in the corners, and I'll take you what you outside out by the field.\" They been\nswapping between theirself, and nobody helped them and nobody bothered them. It was\na big mistake and it was a big mess. Everybody was running, doing anything they can to\nhelp theirself or help the other one. It didn't work. Then they stop it. Started -- and they\nfind out that they don't have enough space. They got to have a bigger, larger ghetto.\nThey had one large ghetto and they had one small ghetto. The small ghetto was 5,000\nJews, and the large ghetto was 27,000 Jews. And to go in the small one, they didn't have\nenough more room, since a lot of Jews were -- because Germany decided to send Jews\nfrom Austria, to send Jews from other countries, to Lithuania, to Kaunas, to the Ninth\nFortress, that killed the Jews, and it was the selection. And they build a bridge from one\nghetto to the other, from the small one to the big one. And in the big one they still have\nroom to put in, but in the small ghetto they didn't have no more. And I -- what they done,\nthey told everybody, all small and big, say, \"Go out in the large field.\" It was where they\nwere building the airport. It's where they have the -- what they call it? Rockstaten (ph),\nthe work places. And they all been sent there. But there they got a select, and the name\n-- a German soldier by the name of Rauca -- Jay got his picture of a writeup with him.\nHe was the head of the selection. And he had the help of the Lithuanians. They helped\nto guard so the Jews shouldn't run. And they was directing the Selection A and B, big\nghetto and small ghetto, who should live and who should die. And then after everybody\ncome around and stay there all morning. I will never forget. From 5:00 o'clock in the\nmorning until 10:00 o'clock at night without food, without water, without nothing. Andit\nwas little children, sick people, unbathed. It was a terrible picture, seeing the way they\nbeen mistreating. Muistreating -- the people wanted they should be shot, but they didn't --\nsurrounded them with machine guns around the all -- around the ghetto, and they kept\nthem all day. And then Rauca come around with a little stick, like you would play music,\nplay an orchestra, directing all what to do, and asked everybody's occupation,\neverybody's name. And then after a while, we seen a German on a motorcycle come\nrunning and told Rauca something. And Rauca gave the order, \"Everybody home. We\ndon't need it. Go home.\" Well, they were trying to, the Germans, to find out how much\ntime and what kind of power it will take to control a situation like this, because they were\nafraid for the balance of the Jews. After all, about 40,000 or even 30,000 Jews, it's a lot\nof people. They cannot take and 40,000 and shoot them out. Somebody will get ahold of\nguns and somebody will get ahold of machine guns, and in worse cases like that it's not\nso shameful. Well, then they send everybody back. And what the religious Jews was\nsay, they were saying, \"Here is a God\" -- I mean \"the hand of God. God saved the Jews.\"\nAnd they all -- they all go and -- and we all Jews start praying, and God is the one. Jews,\nyou listen, and all that. The orthodox, and they were so happy. \"You see, we still have a\nGod. God saved us.\" And I remember it like today they been saying. And they send us\nback home. And this was the small ghetto was liquidated, but they had a bridge made.\nThe bridge to bring in the Jews from the small ghetto to the large ghetto, all the same\ntime from the large one to the small one, and started Selection Number\u20192. The big\nselection, which was October\u201928th, 1941. That's when they had the big selection. And,\nagain, comes the case, I am with all my family, with my family and with Edna's family,\nall together. That the way they had it, in groups. They want, they pick out -- every\ngroups they pick out a head an who is the talker, who can talk with the Germans, but not\neverybody should go come and complain of say this and that. And I was selected by the\nGermans that I should be the speaker for my group. In my group it was around 30 -- 30,\n35 people. And he asked me my occupation. And I -- the power in me tells me I\nshouldn't say a word that Iam a lawyer. I should only mention about my occupation.\nWhat occupation I had when it's all I know 1s, all I learn, it's all my occupation? But the\npower still tells me, don't say a word. And then he start hollering, \"I asked you your\noccupation.\" He hollers a little . Well, power tells me I should say I'm an auto\nmechanic. And I say, \"I am an automobile mechanic.\" And when I say \"automobile\nmechanic,\" he holler, \"Right. All groups go to the right.\" They say this, \"To the right\nshould leave, and the left die.\" And all the left people, the 5,000 that night, been killed,\nevery one of them. My uncles and I have lots family, and everybody been dead, killed.\nThe children, the cousins, raped and all. It was terrible. And that's it.",
        "Q:So your whole family stayed?",
        "A:They stayed.",
        "Q:At that time?",
        "A:Right.",
        "Q:Now, in this big selection, where did it take place?",
        "A:Vonugas (ph), a large country field. It was a big farm, a lot of farm, a lot of acres of land, and\nthere they brought us all up. It used to be the horse market and all kind of place, all kind\nof business places.\nQ. How did people get there? Were they told in advance what was happening?",
        "A:They don't care. They say, \"You got to be there\n7:00 o'clock in the morning. How you get there is your headache.\" They say they don't have to\nworry about it.",
        "Q:So at that time everybody went?",
        "A:Right.",
        "Q:Nobody thought about staying home and hiding?",
        "A:Right. Nobody was staying home as sick. They killed them right in bed. They did stayed\nhome, but they killed them. The Gestapo came in, the Germans in there, and killed them.\nThey also killed some of them they called got to be in . It was like a bath, they take\na bath. And they say, \"Oh, you need a bath. Go in there.\" And they go in there, and\nGestapo kill them. That kind of problems they had. Well, this was the worsest. After\nthis is over, it got a little relaxed after they killed out over half and start all over. And it\nstill stays in front of my eyes. I can see the way they passed. I was right at the corner.\nThey going mostly by alphabet. The letter \"I\" was right in the middle. I could see my --\nthe rabbi from my temple, they bring the president from the temple, a lot of older people\nmostly. They bring older, the old ones, they killed out. The young ones they still kept\nbecause they need them.",
        "Q:So you saw them actually leaving?",
        "A:They going from the big ghetto to the small ghetto. The small ghetto was empty. And there in\nthe small ghetto it was not so easy -- in the beginning not so easy to get in. You had to\nhave _\u2014~s, around number. You weren't no more after death. The selection, after that,\nthey didn't have no more when the person, whether he had Number 10, Number 50,\nNumber 57, Number 80, that kind. And since I register myself as automobile mechanic,\none morning, I assume it was the two days later, a German come running with Number\n570. It was me. He said \"Come report to the gate.\" The Jewish bodies had to deliver\nright away. And they come right away running and told me I got to go to work at the\nairport. Well, they took me. I had to go to work, because I'm a mechanic. Because there\nI came, and they told me what to do. And I was also lucky. It's a luck. I'm standing with\nthe foreman on a truck, it was a German. A German army soldier come into the foreman\nwith a pickup truck. And he say he has trouble. The truck isn't running right. He talks to\nthe German, the foreman, can we help him. The foreman called me up, \"Come here.\nTalk with him and ask him what he wants.\" I go to him, ask what he wants. He tells me\nhe has trouble with his truck, it doesn't run. I've got do something about it. I said, \"Well,\nlet me see.\" He start it up. I didn't hear nothing. I said, \"Tell you what I'll do. I can to\nlay down on the floor and you drive slow and over me, and I'll see what is knocking\nthere.\" I heard a knock. We hear it. He say okay. And he say when will I be able to\nhave ready. I say acouple days. He say, \"Oh, no. Can you do it earlier? I'll give you a\ngood loaf of bread. I mean, you can do it? I have a farm not far from here, and I want to\nrun up to see what's going on home.\" \"I'll do my best,\" I tell him. And Ido. And I lay\ndown, and I seen a big pipe with the universal joint with the drive shaft is loose, and I use\nmy head. I say, \"What I am doing -- I moved it. It wasn't the newer kind of car; it was\nthe old late model Ford. And I took it out with my hand. It was loose. And I go into the\nGerman, and I tell them I need a universal joint, and they bring me the part in stock. And\nhe sa, \"Look, I can't understand. Tell me, how do you took off a drive shaft with -- so\nlong with so little bolts with a big tools. I gave you a screwdriver with a pipe wrench. I\ntold him, I say -- you see, you all the time you got to bein yours. And I told him,\n\"Well, I had it here, it was so loose, the pipe, that I didn't have to have any wrenches.\nWith my fingers I took it off and it got loose,\" and that's what I wanted. \"Oh, I can\nunderstand now.\" He understood. He gave me the parts, and I became the best mechanic\nin the Gestapo.",
        "Q:I need to take you back cause I have a few more questions about that big action.",
        "A:Uh-huh.",
        "Q:Did -- you had a Jewish government in place and you had Jewish police in the ghetto. What\nwas their involvement in these actions?",
        "A:The Jews?",
        "Q:The Jew -- the Judenrought (ph). Those people and the people on the Jewish police force, did\nthey have any involvement in this action?",
        "A:Not.",
        "Q:Did they help? Did they try to help Jewish people? Did they help the Germans?",
        "A:I don't think -- I don't think it was in -- it was rumors was coming around that the Jewish\npolice knew where children hiding places were, and they reported it to the Gestapo, and\n-- because to save their own skin that there, that's all they had. They didn't want to get\ninvolved or something. They just point the place where you can see Jewish kids been\nlaying in hiding and been killed. That's the kind of rumors I had -- I heard, but I don't\nknow. I cannot verify, I can't say nothing because I don't know.",
        "Q:Were they present at the selection, the leaders of the Jewish Council? Were they present?",
        "A:Before. The leaders of the council, there wasn't too many. The only one was Tory, and it was\nDr. Elkes, and Tory had a secretary woman. It's all it was. That was the council. And\none was by the door, the Isaac, who didn't let me 1n to ask him find out what's going on.\nAbout five, six people.",
        "Q:So were they there at the time of the big action?",
        "A:Yeah, yes.",
        "Q:What were they doing?",
        "A:Nothing. They didn't done nothing. They -- they didn't bother the police. The police saying\nat first they had to have a working permit, and to get a working permit was hard. It\nwasn't so easy. They been paying -- buying working permits, because they been told the\nperson with a working permit his life is secured. They don't go do nothing to them; he'll\nsurvive. And they been giving us a working permit Number 537, and 537 is Israel Ipson.\nAnd it was been already 537 in the , in that department. They been making it for --\nin a minute for you. They had the special printing material and they be printing up 537.\nThey made 721 and they made -- and it the way it went. They had it made. And then\neverybody was trying to go to the police because the city police don't bother. They have\nenough troubles the way the average person has it. But nobody can go into the police.\nThey didn't took it. They want me. Why they want me? First thing, I was born there in\nthat place, raised in the place. I knew every little corner, every little hole. They need me,\nbut I say, \"No, huh-uh. You don't go get me. I don't want it. I'd rather go to the airport.\"\nBut then, that's my help me too, by not going into the airport. Some of them say, \"Well,\nwe cannot keep Ipson so long. He been so many years already here. We got to give him\na better job. It's not fair. We got to recruit all the work on his shoulder. We got more\nJews got to go to the airport. We swap it.\" Well, but that when I decided on to my uncle.",
        "Q:Okay. We still -- I have a lot more questions about the ghetto.",
        "A:Sure. Go ahead.",
        "Q:All right. So do you -- is there anything more that you can tell me about these horrible\nactions, the -- what happened with the small ghetto or what happened with the big action\nat the end of October? Is there anything else? Could you see the people as they were\nactually leaving, leaving the ghetto, walking out towards the forts? Was that -- could you\nsee that happening?",
        "A:A walk inthe _\u2014_\u2014s, no. _I didn't see it happening. It would be very, very rough. And that's\nfunny. The Germans -- at the end of the Germans taking, there was a member by the\nname of Lipzer. Lipzer was a head -- a right man for the Gestapo. It was a Jewish\nperson. I -- he became -- he was a nothing. He was a television salesman before the war.\nI knew him personally very well. And he became a big shot because he wanted -- he\nwant to go -- when someone been locked up by the Gestapo and going to Lipzer, Lipzer\nused to bring him out. How he been doing it, nobody knows. Had he been paid off, I\ndon't know. Used to save you something to the Gestapo, to Miller, for him for his wife a\npresent, and take it out and _ three. But it was the main thing. In my case, I felt a little\nbetter, but I didn't bother with him. I stayed away from him. I didn't want no part. Like\nwhen they put in Edna in jail, and I don't know why she got involved with it with her\nmother. ot in jail my sister, and they put him in jail by the ghetto. It's a time -- and I\nhad arranged to take him out from ghetto to run with him to keep the place where to\nwork, but it didn't worked out. I got another very, very, _\u2014_ terrible what happened.\nThe worsest part of what happened with me in ghetto. I even don't want to talk about it.\nI had a cousin who worked for me. He's a very smooth operator by the gate. He wasn't\nafraid for nothing. He had been supplying to the ghetto population anything they want.\nA young kid. He was around 19 or 18. And he helped me to go to the gate with Jay,\nbecause his house was also by the gate. And he helped me also to get to my farmer\nwhom my uncle sent to pick me up with Edna, because they want to bring me home. And\nI see one day my -- it was a couple months later, my cousin is in my hiding place. He\ncame. How he came, I find out; but where he get the idea, I didn't know. I didn't want to\nhave nothing to do with him. Everything when he done for me, I paid him. I just didn't --\nwasn't in me to have to do it, all this smoke-miray (ph), they call it. But this time he\ncome to me and ask me, \"I need a favor.\" He wants a favor from me. I say, \"What do\nyou want? I paid you for my favor to take me to the gate.\" \"Yeah, you pay me. I don't\nwant that.\" I say, \"When you want somebody\" -- he say he want to bring his brother also\nin my place where I am staying. I'll agree with that provided you can bring my mother\nwith the sister, with the older sister. You can bring them from ghetto to me, I'll do\nanything you want.\" He say \"Okay.\" I say, \"But you remember, you got to bring my\nmother,\" and I repeat him three times. And I say, \"Marches\" -- who is the gentile who\ncome to pick us up. I say, \"Look, Marches, you see he should take my mother and\nsister.\" \"I don't know who they are.\" I say, \"You'll find out.\" He didn't. He come on\nboard his other brother with his wife, bring her to me. And I come to the ghetto and I\nsay, \"Who are -- what you brought them for? Who the woman?\" \"This is my wife,\" he\nsay. \"But who give you the permission to bring them in here? I didn't ask you to come.\"\nIt was the best hiding place. It was mine. Why? It was in a safe. The Gestapo wouldn't\ndream to fnd somebody. A gentile should work so much to bring people out of ghetto,\nbut he done it. Well, I got hot. I said, \"Now, look. I don't want no more part of you. I\ntold you a bunch. I don't want -- I want my family. I didn't have nothing do with\nstrangers. Your wife, fine. I don't have nothing. I'm not married to your wife.\" Didn't\nlisten again. And he come with his less brother and his wife. And something got him\nwhen they came to a little town they had to go through to come to me. It was Zezmer,\nZezmer. And go in three soldiers. And that to them comes a wagon, and the wagon was\nmy aunt -- the boy's mother -- and his wife. Four already been with him; two more came.\nAnd I'm seeing the soldiers, and they were thinking that the soldiers go enough that they\nwant to arrest him. And they start running, about -- my aunt and my cousin, and the\nsoldiers didn't know what's happening. There were a big pile of hay. It was the fall of\nthe year. And they got in the pile of hay, they were hiding in the hay, and the soldiers\nthen come around, took him out of the hay, and shot him. Killed him. Took him not the\nsame day, next day. Mother and son, pardon me. Took him. I can't forget. This is\nalmost a fault of mine, when I would insist -- maybe they would be more easier, but I\ninsist to bring my mother. I wanted _ to have somebody. Many, many nights I don't\nsleep because of that -- because of that.",
        "Q:Now, I want to go back to the ghetto a little bit.",
        "A:Okay.",
        "Q:Is that okay?",
        "A:Okay.",
        "Q:What -- you said that, you know, you worked in the airport outside of the ghetto. Was there --\nwere there also workers inside the ghetto?",
        "A:Yes. They had another. There was a very interesting things outside of the ghetto inside of the\nghetto. It happened I had to go and bring the beer for the German soldiers, but since my\nfather worked in the brewery, my grandfather worked in the brewery, they had the\nconnections. They knew each other, even in the ghetto. There was the workers who\nworked with my father, came to him and it's what I -- it's terrible. And he had only one\nsuit. He had a suit on himself. One worker from the brewery, a gentile, he want he\nshould come to him and say, \"Braetka (ph)\" -- they call my father his name Braetka --\n\"how's about selling me your suit?\" He say, \"Well, I'll sell you my suit. I'll buy me some\ncheaper suit. I don't need\" -- it was a cloth (ph) suit. \"Okay. What how much you want\nto pay me?\" He say, \"I don't know.\" He say, \"Okay. Tell you what you'll do. I'll buy it\nfor you. I'll give you the suit, and you'll pay me for it.\" \"Okay. What do you want?\" He\nsay, \"I want that loaf of bread with a half a pound butter for the kids.\" \"All right.\" He\ncomes in, he gives him a packet, and he goes away. And what they gave him? A brick.\nA paper wrapped around a piece of brick, and took away the suit. And it was worker\nworked with him all his life. He could fix him, and I told him, I say, \"Don't bother. I'll\nbuy you another suit in ghetto, and don't bother with him. Have nothing do with him.\"\nThat kind of people he been working with.",
        "Q: What was the -- was there an advantage to working outside of the ghetto instead of inside the\nghetto? Which was the better job?",
        "A:Better -- naturally, it's better in the ghetto providing you have something to support yourself.\nInside of the ghetto was the main thing, the malin (ph) what they call it, the working\ngroups. Vachstaten (ph). The work places. There was around 5,000 Jews working,\nbecause the Germans needed them very bad. They needed them to make loafs and to\nmake ears. And they used to catch -- bring cats and dogs and killing them, and taking the\near covers and making ear covers from their skins. And they were bringing them in the\nplaces where they have been hauling the cats and dogs was in synagogues, bringing them\nfull synagogues dogs and killing them. And there was already sitting sewing machines,\nmaking ear covers for their ears from the dogs. And one day I come to work -- I come to\nwork with my cousin. I was the head of the brigade coming into the airport. A German\ncome to us, and he tell me, he say, \"Look, I want you to take me to the ghetto.\" I say,\n\"What do you mean you want me to take you to the ghetto? I have nothing to do with it.\nLeave me alone. Stay away.\" Next time he say, \"You got to help me. I can't get any\nbeer. I'm short of bottles.\" And the Germans couldn't get any beer when they didn't have\nempty bottles. \"Well, I'll arrange that,\" I said, since I knew the people who knew my\nfather. And I told him, I said, \"I need bottles,\" and they arranged it to give me three, four\ncases empty bottles, but for my boss to have beer ___\u2014_\u2014\u00ab.~ And one day, I seen the\nGestapo man come looking for me. I got scared to death. I say, \"Oh, this 1s the end.\nThis time I no get out.\" And who it was? It's funny. The brewmeister from the brewery\nwho it was before the war, who worked together with my father before the war, and now\nhe became a big Gestapo man. One of the big, big ones. And he was trying to find out\nhis boss. He want to see the Wolf brothers. The Wolf brothers, the six brothers, who\nhelped build the brewery, and Ingleman, they was still -- two were still alive. The rest of\nthem were dead already. And he came to bring a package, the Gestapo man, that I should\ntake over a package to one of his bosses. And he was a philanthropic man, a nice man.\nAnd I took over a package, put it in ghetto, and I save it. And if they going to catch me, I\ntold them I got -- he give me his card. He say, \"Don't worry. When they going to catch\nyou, give them this by the ghetto gate. They're going to let you in. Don't worry. And\nthey'll see in this card and know it was_s\u2014\u00a3\"\". And then Mr.\u2019 Wolf came. He came\nthrough friends of my father. I told him, I say, \"Look, help me.

        "Q:You were saying that it was better to work inside the ghetto?",
        "A:Yes.",
        "Q:Why is that?",
        "A:You didn't have to put up with guys -- at the gates with the guard, with the police. with\nbutter, with water, you had nothing to do with them. When you worked inside the\nghetto, you go from your ghetto place to your home or from home to the ghetto place.\nAnd for that -- the only thing when you had a sewing machine or another -- toaster,\nhelped to trade it in by the gentiles. Items like that, they used to grab it and give you a\ngood price, and they had money to buy it. I had from one of my competitors when I\nwandered out of one of the buildings it was, a cigarette box mixed from gold. Asked me\nto trade it in for food. It was from Mr.\u2019Frumpkin (ph). And I'll take it. I'll try to do it,\nbut I took it but I wasn't capable to make a deal and I brought it back. He didn't -- if they\nwould have caught, they would have caught me, not him. It's not interested. It's not\ninvolved in it. I was the one involved by tooking the transaction. My life was in danger,\nbut not theirs. And --",
        "Q:Well, but now, isn't it possible that 1f you worked outside the ghetto you had more of an\nopportunity to do business or to get extra food or that kind of thing?",
        "A:Yes. They right, they live. But I don't know that life 1s worth it so much to do it. Well,\nmostly Edna she was more for that. I didn't go for that. Didn't want to risk her life. I\nhad been looking for her twice. And now when I run away from the ghetto, I run no\nmore from the ghetto, but I had a new working place already. They gave me rifemeister\n(ph). What I really been doing, taking old guns, rifles, cleaning it, fixing it up, oiling it,\nand putting back in stock.",
        "Q:Is that outside or inside the ghetto?",
        "A:That was inside. They took a few people. They didn't took anybody. They were afraid. For\nme they weren't afraid. They say when I'd say it wouldn't happen, it wouldn't do -- I\nwouldn't done it.",

        "A:Had to have pull. You know what pull, what I mean? \"P,\" protection. Without protection you\ndidn't get nothing. It just even don't dream about it. To get it, you wouldn't. But it was\nAvraham Tory. You had to have him when you need to get a good job. It was Dr. Geslin\n(ph), you had to have him to get a good job. He was the labor department chief. He\ncouldn't get without him a good job. I couldn't get a good job. I didn't get it. My\nbrother-in-law was a no-good. It was every little thing he wants to be paid with money. I\nwasn't for that. But I didn't spoke to him again, and . People had to have him to\nget -- to be able to get a job.",
        "Q:So the administration in the ghetto was --",
        "A:Wasn't too hot. Wasn't too hot. The reputation of theirs and the name was terrible. They\nwere drunks. They used to go out five, six, big shots -- I wouldn't call them -- going out\nin the city, encounters, looking around to get something for nothing.",
        "Q:They weren't that helpful to the population?",
        "A:No, no. Nothing. They weren't helpful. They would help -- trying to help themself. But in\nthe end, the Germans killed them.",
        "Q:What about Tory? Was he -- was he helpful? Was he a good man?",
        "A:I don't know. I cannot tell you. I don't want to that he should get angry and maybe sometimes\nhe run into me and say, \"What you done to me?\" Well, I don't get along with him. He\nright here, because I met him a couple of times in Israel. I've been many times there.\nAnd I've been meeting him -- and, well, I don't know.",
        "Q:They were all a little bit --",
        "A:Yeah. He didn't done any harm to me, but the book of his he been writing, it had all of it been\ntranslated, because he was a smart cookie. You know, I'd say one thing. Well, it's not the\nLithuanians. You didn't know that Professor Belodski (ph) -- you heard of him?\nProfessor Belodski was a professor of the University of Lithuania, a professor for civil\nlaw. Professor Belodski -- Tory worked for him, a secretary. And Professor Belodski\nlost his mind in ghetto, and they put him 1n a little home, locked him up, and left him.\nAnd he looked like a little dog would be locked up. And I pass by and I seen it. I pass by\nin the ghetto in that corner, that moment I was -- it was terrible. And I told Tory. I say,\n\"Couldn't you be -- so big shots, couldn't you help that man?\" He could help. \"Why\ndon't you do? Why haven't you done it?\" He didn't say nothing. When you need him,\nyou need him, and . But he helped some of them, too. Without his help, what\nwould good would he be? But why would he had to protect the Soviets or blue-mortgage\n(ph) or all those people without having benefit of mind to. He had a second wife. His\nfirst wife, he was married to a girl whom he knew a lot of. The boys from high school, in\nthe fraternities, that I was along with them. We mingled together; we knew each other.\nBut some of them was nice and some of them was bad. Some of them paid for it after the\nliberation.",
        "Q:What about Dr. Elkes? Was he a good man?",
        "A:Yeah. Oh, a terrific man. He already write a book. You didn't read it, did you?",
        "Q: Well, tell me about him.",
        "A:Well, I don't know. He wrote a letter, Dr.\" Elkes, to his children. He got a boy and a girl. And\nhe told them the direction of life, how they should behave, how they should live. In\nTory's book is it, and it breaks your heart. And one paragraph is worth -- oh, what he had\nit in that book. But I'll have to get my book. I got him in English. In Hebrew he\ntranslated, because Israel couldn't use a book. It wasn't good for him. And I'll have to\nfind out from my cousin.",

        "A:Yeah, he was a good man. He wasn't --",
        "Q:And he tried to help the people?",
        "A:He tried -- he could help more, but he helped. And I told him that, too. I say -- we met one\ntime and we talk. He helped. He didn't done nothing wrong. He could do maybe more,\nbut he done as much as he could with what's the name, with Gestapo man Miller.",

        "Q:You were talking about the fact that the Jewish government, the police, the Judenrat (ph),\nreally weren't that helpful.",
        "A:No.",
        "Q:Why -- why do you think it is that they seem to have a better reputation than in most ghettos?",
        "A:Because the people around those ghettos, and the people around the ages from the ghettos was\nmentioned, they tried to help. Here was Robovski (ph). Robovski was a young, good\nJew, who worked at the gate all day long for three years. And he done so much good by\nhelping poor people get through -- he knew like a sewing machine going out. In going\nout I saw him, I seen him from the ghetto to sell it some bread, butter. Robovski knew\nabout it because the men who got to take it out used to talk to Robovski to see -- to get it\nGerman to tumult (ph) you know, that he should know what he's doing, take him away on\nthe side at that moment that we were seen. I carried one sewing machine, and it is a job\nto get it out. I think Edna or else somebody sold it, a machine, and I had to carry it out.\nIt was my height, and we put it on the front legs right in here and the rear legs in the\nback, and you walk with a sewing machine. Well, but there you had to have help. On\nsometimes a person like that get caught, and then he's in trouble and somebody got to\nhelp him to get him out. But some of them got feeling and some of them not. Some of\nthem say, \"Oh, he got it for money.\" He not got it for money; got it for food, for hunger.\nIt all depend on the person, too. I don't know. That's why I build myself up a reputation\nin the beginning. They begged me I should join the police. I say, \"Not me. I would\nnever do it. I can't do it. How can I be a policeman when I with the boy who was from\nVensico (ph)\" -- Robovski -- \"been going to school, been to Hayda together. How could\nI see that he's getting harmed and I stand by and not doing nothing. Huh-uh. That's not --\nwrong man.\" I didn't.",
        "Q:How did people get food in the ghetto?",
        "A:Oh, this is no -- there was plenty. It was stole. It was one of my cousin, probably around 19,\noh, you order to him a cow, he bring you a cow. You order to him flowers or anything\nyou want. You could get anything. The best liquor you could get. People had money to\nbuy cognac. They buy and drinking cognac. And here is people working to death to get\nit going, and they having a good time. But controlled that stuff.",

        "Q:Now what about the people who didn't have the money to buy the food or the liquor?",
        "A:They had to eat kraut, cabbage with horse meat. You see, horse meat you had plenty. That's\nwhat the Germans been sending to the Jews, horse meat and cabbage. That's all they\nbeen getting. They didn't -- nobody could help, and they had no choice.",
        "Q:But your sense is people didn't go hungry?",
        "A:No, they didn't go hungry, because it's not the Lithuanian's element on the job. It's not the\nelement like the Lithuanian Jews. It is a person entirely another, made from another\ndough. Right. Even right now, you take -- when you go in any business, you go with the\nLithuanian Jew, you have no worry. It's perfect. But you go with the Polish Jew, he in\ntroubles, because it's a element of theirs is different. Before they started, I could cheat\nyou.",

And the Kovno ghetto had musicians in the ghetto, the stupors\n(ph), and the windmill (ph). And all the musicians they had to once a week come in the\nbuilding from the seminary -- Was a large building. That building hold about 1500\npeople -- and play music for the ghetto people.

        "Q:-- and sort of how you felt day to day while you were living in the ghetto. You went to work.\nYour family all went in different directions in the daytime. Was there a fear during the\nday that you might be hurt or that when you came home from work something might be\nwrong with your family?",
        "A:Right. Oh, this was all the time. We were afraid maybe one of the family wouldn't come\nback. And go in the morning to work, we didn't know you'll be back. Maybe not.\nMaybe you'll be reported by somebody. Maybe somebody will be hot and go to the\nGestapo and say, \"Hey, take a look. He messed it up.\" It's good -- it's enough to get\nkilled -- here ___\u2014_\u2014.~ Every day Hitler used to send burgess (ph) with all metal pieces,\nfilling it up, bringing in cement for they need it for the airport for the runways. And\ntaking our back steel -- old cars, old tanks, all that, bringing it back. And who had to\nunload? Me, as they elected. I was a mechanic and top quality mechanic already, they\nsend me there to help unload the cement and help to load up the steel. And it was a tough\njob, because it was raining and I didn't have any shoes. I had a cut-up tire, with a knife to\ncut it up on, and tied it up around with wires that I shouldn't slip. And here I'm going\nwith a metal on my shoulder and bring it in to the bars to drop it in that it should be filled\nup. I don't know how many tongues they had to have. And when I'm going with the\nwornout tires sole, I slipped. And when I slipped, and I had still a piece of metal on my\nshoulder, I dropped the metal and I start falling. And I grab myself on the wood and the\nboard, but it was going like a little bridge from top down to this piece of metal. And I\npulled myself up not to fall in. Would I fall in, I don't know how I would got out. Maybe\nI would be dead, because of this old broken up steel for the rest of the other boys been\ndropping it in. And the Germans seen it. He come running to me, without even saying\nnothing, and start beating me with a stick. Right here on my shoulder. And I -- I couldn't\nforget. I told the German, \"You shut up. You better stop. I'll break your neck.\" And I\nknew the German will react right away. Iam a nothing. I am a dog in that time. And he\npulled out a pistol and start laying into me. And the boys who knows me, I walked with\nme together in the same spot, told me, \"Ipson, run, run. He going to kill you. Take a\nlook. He's got to pull the gun. You better go.\" And all of a sudden I hear shimm,\nshimm, shimm, shimm. And also I been saved. I don't know how I got saved. I been\nrunning right behind the old cars, the old trucks, and he lost his aim right. But in the\nbeginning he as going to kill me in a minute. And here is a case here I went to work, I\nwouldn't even dreamed about it was going to happen, and get killed. It's what's\nhappening in the life every day, every hour, every minute.",
        "Q:Did you teach your son -- he was a -- was your daughter still alive at this point? Your little\ngirl, was she still with you?",

        "A:We didn't -- she died from poison, poisoned milk. That's what the doctor said. The doctor.\nWho knows? Edna says she needs for the girl milk. She was young; she was three\nmonths. And I went to the farmer asking for milk, and she gave me the milk. And she\ntold me to be careful. She say, \"The milk is maybe sour,\" but she didn't -- she didn't want\nI -- to spill out. She want to give some of the Jews a piece and buy one to drink for the\nchild. And that way I got her the milk, and she died a month later.",
        "Q:This was at the very beginning of the ghetto?",
        "A:Right. Very beginning. It was after the pogroms. I went to the number two highway, not the\nnumber one. The number one highway a lot of Jews been coming back and they been --\ngot stopped and killed. They be killed by the Lithuanians.",

        "A:Right. We had to.",
        "Q:What did you teach him?",
        "A:I would teach him to be quiet, not to say a word, nothing. When he's in the dark, be careful,\nlook around every step, the good light. And he should be careful to move around\nfrom one ghetto to small ghetto. When we are escaped, why I had to have him a place\nwhere to keep him. Gentiles wouldn't take him, and I didn't want nobody should know\ntoo much about it. And I had to take him over from the big ghetto to the small one.\nWhere I took him over to the small ghetto and told him, I said be quiet. He shouldn't say\na word until -- wait until we come back and we'll bring him. And here is a kid like five\nmonths -- no, no, not five months. Five -- five weeks.",
        "Q:Five years.",

        "Q:It must have been difficult to have a such a young child at that time.",
        "A:I didn't have no choice. When you have no choice, you be surprised at what you do. You do\nanything when something bad is chasing you, pushing you, and telling you what to do.\nYou don't become no more that all-quiet person, don't say nothing and do nothing and\ninterested in nothing. You can't do it. It's another force forces you to do things which\nyou never thought done it in your normal life.",
        "Q:But did you ever think of trying to get him to safety or to maybe to stay with some of the\nLithuanian people without you so that you could move about more freely?",
        "A:No. I didn't trust the Lithuanians. Nothing. The Lithuanians was this worser than the\nGermans. The Germans, when you speak a good German, you still could save yourself,\nbut not with the Lithuanians. Like I came in Berlin, I run from the Russians. I run from\nthem, too. I run from the Germans. I run from the Russians. I got to run -- keep running.\nI come in Berlin and --",

        "Q:Well, did you ever think of getting involved with them?",

The shootout was between the underground and Gestapo at the\ngate of Florence (ph). Florence was a soap factory, and there was a corner covered by\nHolmes Higher Buildings (ph). It was a hiding place there. And there they went out\nfrom the ghetto. It was going already to the underground group to the woods. They been\nalready and checked it, and it was right by the factory of Florence. The truck\ndriver who had been taking them over took money from nothing, and he spilled the\nbeans. He told the Gestapo that the group Jews are running out from the ghetto, and they\nbeen waiting already for them and they start shooting each other. Well, and everybody\nsurvived, but they killed the sofa (ph) and got rid of the truck. But that man is buried in\nthe cemetery from Richmond. He came to me and I helped him. And he decide to settle\nwith what they done, with the lights laid out, and they caught them with their handgun by\nthe gate and Lipzer took him out.",
        "Q:So toward the end of your stay in the ghetto, you had heard about children being taken away.\nYou decided you had to get out, and that's when you contacted your wife's uncle?",

        "Q:Now, at that point, who was still living with you before you left the ghetto?",
        "A:My father and mother and sisters. I had a brother-in-law, who I wish I would never had had.\nHe -- my sister was his wife, and he lost her. But he's been a big shot. He was a tough.\n-fuhrer, they call it. And he was living with -- in ghetto, and he was thinking he's bigger\nthan anybody. And, you know, because of him I lost my sister, and --",

        "A:No. She lost everybody -- in five minutes, she lost them. They come and ask for Riga, who\nwas the I -- the selection for Riga. Riga, Jews for Rigaburg (ph). The reason was the\nGermans weren't careful, and they stored all the Jews in Riga. Killed them all. Didn't\nhave any work force where they could get them for nothing. And then they had to get\npeople for -- new people for Riga. They took it from the ghetto of Kaunas and send it to\nRiga, and there went my wife's family. There went her family.",
        "Q:But they -- when they took your wife's family, how did that come about?",
        "A:Oh, it__\u2014_\u2014_\u2014sfor one right now. They truck away my father-in-law, Edna's stepfather, great\nbig hand. He must see me staying for the last time that he waved, and I stayed in front of\nmy eyes all the time. They appears by his house, as he was a very, nice, nice, nice man.\nBut he went to the ghetto from the first day to the last. And the police came -- I don't\nknow. Maybe it's my fault, too. I don't know. They need five people -- they need people\nfor Riga to come and get them. There were five. It was a father and mother, two\nbrothers, and a sister. It was five people. They come and ask for them. But she be\naround -- I don't know where she was in that moment -- she wouldn't let him take it. And\nshe wasn't there, and she blame right now in five minutes I lost a family, and cries all, all\nthe time. Because it was very, very painful for her. And I still had my family, but I lost\nthem in the big selection. And that's quite in the big election. No, no, it was bad. There\nwas a brigade was Monkas Melina (ph). Monk. And that man had build himself a place\nto hide that it was unbelievable. You couldn't find it anyway you want to look. And he\nwas in the ghetto. And my sister was with him in his melina. And when they tried --\nafter the war, I run right away I was there. August the Ist the communists took Kaunas.\nI was the first -- in the evening, I was there. And I came with the trucks from the Russian\nsoldiers, find the Jews already, jumped with them in the truck, and came to Kaunas and\nrun right away through the ghetto. And I running into the ghetto and going from corner\nto corner at the bottom looking. Nothing. It was so clean, and I never seen like it. I\ncouldn't find nothing. The only thing I seen Lithuanians, which was in Pavoretto (ph)\nwhat were the pieces of a woman. Lithuanian woman with a long stick with a big metal\ndigging in the ground, trying to find somebody bodies, maybe. She could find others, be\nable to get some stuff. It was unbelievable. And there the gentile who had lived next\ndoor th cemetery seen me. I used to go and listen to the shortwave radio, what's going\non. And he told me he seen that there 1s too that there was Segersom (ph). No\nMendleson (ph). Mendleson was a man who was in the brigada with me, and in a year\nafter the war, and he run in in the place where we been working. He work with me there\nin the brigade. And hiding himself, Mendleson. And one of our soldiers, this -- and the\nGerman army was going back already all the way back to Tulsic (ph). And one of the\nhead like a Gestapo decided to go in there where it was working, the sergeant, and what's\nhis name wasn't too careful, and he seen Mendleson. He took his pistol and killed him in\nthe day of the liberation. And it was they killed Mendleson.",
        "Q:Okay. Why don't you tell me a little bit about how you left the ghetto. How you and Jay and\nEdna left the ghetto to go into hiding. You told me that you had made arrangements\nthrough her uncle. Would you prefer to stop now?",
        "A: It's -- I would stop, yeah.",
        "Q:Okay. Why don't we do that.",
        "A:Okay?",
        "Q:Okay. So how is it that you got out of the ghetto to go into hiding?",
        "A:Well, after we got out of the ghetto --",
        "Q:How did you get out?",
        "A:Well, how I got out to the ghetto, as I had to get at night to -- I cut the barbed wire with a pair\nof pliers, opened up a big hole, and crawled through that hole. Across the street was\nmaybe by 200 feet was already houses. It was a small ghetto who was -- that was\nliquidated. That is their houses where they lived, the people. And from there already a\nfarmer, my uncle send to us, was waiting outside of the territory was a hundred and --\nclose to a hundred miles. And there we got together again there. Jay, me, and Edna and\nthe farmer. And he put in Jay in the wagon, which was full of straw, covered him up, so\nit shouldn't be nobody should see him. And I was walking with that wagon, because to\nthe danger places I didn't want to run and to make some noises, should be as quiet as\ncould be. I even asked the farmer to take the shoe of the horse, to put the shoe with\nrubber pads we shouldn't hear him go around or do anything, we be quiet. The same is\nwhat's very important for us, the German, they had these boots there with nails. You\ncould hear it for a mile. And that's the way we moved. I seen one stopped us with a\nwagon, \"Where are you going? What you got?\" They got -- they thinking he the farmer.\n\"You got anything for sale?\" \"I don't have anything for sale,\" and they didn't bother.",
        "Q:And your wife was walking, also?",
        "A:She was walking as much as she can. We all walked -- walk as much as we can. We had a\nwagon to take us in and go as fast and all we want, but we didn't walk that way. You\nwere so scared every little noise. A rabbit goes by, you jump, scared to death. Who is\nthat with that noise? And then we were successful. Thank God. My cousin when he\nwent to me, he went on a bicycle. It was a long, long worn out trip.",
        "Q:How far did you have to travel?",
        "A:60 -- about 75 miles.",
        "Q:So now, did you go with this one farmer the whole time?",
        "A:That farmer, the younger, he's brave, smart. He didn't fit in for a farmer. When I could bring\nhim here, I would have done anything for him, as good as he is. And they work, as I say,\neverything fit together. I tell you, not like a farmer, but like a professor, you know,\neverything right. He told us ahead of time -- when we came in the ghetto -- I mean out of\nthe ghetto, he brought us in in his house, and he didn't hear nothing. The poor farmer, his\nhouse was a smokehouse -- what they call? A smokehouse. Like the smoking ham or it's\n-- he had the oven without the chimney. And he get two little boys, very noisy, and for\nthe boys are more worried -- scared more for them than I was scared for the big ones.\nBut first place he told the boys they should put us on the top of the oven. The oven is\nalmost as big as half of that room, and it was nice and warm and comfortable, because it\nwas cold, ice and snow, and he put us right under there. And we were asleep, and it was\nenjoyable sleep I ever had. But here comes in the farmer, and he start snooping. And he\nsay, \"Wait a minute. Who is here?\" He asked the children if he knew whom to ask. The\nchildren they would tell him. The rest, we wouldn't tell him. \"Who lives here? Who\nmoved in here recently,\" he asked the kids and asked the farmer's wife. They say -- his\nwife ask him, \"Why are you asking? What does that have to do with your business?\"\n\"No, here is city folks moved in. I smell. The smell is a city smell. And somebody,\nstranger, moved in. Who could move in?\" He started figuring the people telling to the\nroom and whom you think could be? \"It must be city lawyer. That's all. The lawyer\ncome here.\" And it was me. You see, \"The lawyer with Itska (ph)\", Itska was her uncle,\n\"they are the one moved up right here. They in that house,\" he tells the woman. Well,\nshe send the kids right away to come home, his___\u2014_\u2014.-~SAnd he came, and she told them\nboth the man's name or was here and what he said. He said, \"We in trouble. We got to\nget out immediately,\" the farmer said, \"for mine house. And let's take them to his sister's\nhome.\" And that's what we did. And we going halfway, the sister, the bugs, the dogs\nstart barking, carrying on. He says, \"It's no good. The farmer was going with us to the\npeople we were going. He told Edna, \"We'll have to go to the Paskavitz (ph), to the\npeople Paskavitzes.\" And they the only one in this situation they could help -- can help\nus, because the Gestapo wouldn't bother with them because their son-in-law the chief of\npolice of Volitus (ph), a city. A small city, not a big one. And they -- and he's very\ntough, tough chief of police. And then they have to worry when people are find out,\nthey'll go everywhere until his house, until -- to that chief they don't want to start it.\nWell, everyone in this time was not kosher. Everybody will be taking it to the table,\ntaking _, stealing, covering, all kind of mismatch of business was going on. But up\nto the chief of police. And then the farmer told Edna, \"When you can go in in the house\nand tell the old lady who you are, then they'll do it. She'll do for you because of your\nmother.\" And her mother was already dead. Then he told the boys to watch out, not to\ngo home, never go with him. The farmer took him around and let the boys go on around\nbecause it would maybe be caught and can be messed up. He was smart. And then every\n5 -- every 10 minutes, the farmer used to lay down on the ground with the ears, and knew\nthe movement from the Gestapo. The Gestapo was already looking for us. And when\nthey -- they knew exactly where the Gestapo were, because the noise, the walk, when\nthey been walking. It was wintertime and cold, and the snow was ice, and we go with\nboots on ice it's makes a noise which you can hear far away. And every half hour we\nused to lay down. We go into woods, and they say \"Let's go. It's good. The dogs are\nthere,\" and they be giving us the plans on moving with us where the dogs are. The dogs\nwere making the noise because the new strange people came in. They think the strange\npeople they were after them. And it was not one, it was a bunch of police looking,\nbecause I was the dangerous one. Dangerous than the partisans, because partisans was\nliving right there too in those woods, in the woods. It was thick woods and good ___,\nand it what the partisans need. They live in there. And it's the way we moved up to the\nPaskavitzes. Edna knocks in the window, and \"Who's there?\" And Edna say --\nmentioned her mother's name. \"Don't know her.\" The old man comes up to the door,\nopens it a crack, and say, \"Who you?\" And she tells him she is Esther's -- Esther's\ndaughter, and she want to talk with him. \"Esther's daughter? Which Esther are you\ntalking about?\" Say \"Esther from Slobodka, from Lithuania, that is my mother. And I\nam Hikki (ph),\" they call it, yeah, \"I am Hikki's daughter.\" \"Oh, Hikki's daughter.\" They\nknow who it is. They let us in home, she and her husband. Her son, second son died.\nThey had a daughter and a son. The son did not investigated what goes on in the village,\nbecause they knew each other. Every movement. Anything in a little village they knew.\nThen he went out that night to report the mother and father what's happening in the\nvillage. And they come back the next day and reported that the Gestapo was looking for\n-- spent two hours checking, searching around the lake, although they had a round lake,\nand couldn't find them. Couldn't find nobody. And they dissolve it. They decided to\nmove in another time. They didn't _\u2014\u2014_\u2014.~ Two days they come again. And this time,\nthey were very close to us, closer here, but there was not time even to get if you were\nlaying right in the attic, laying the cover it up with all junk, with all hay and all that. But\nwe -- he didn't even let us stay there no more. The farmer's brother-in-law took us\nfrom the attic. Edna and me and Jay, all three, out. He don't want even to have us close\nby. He's afraid that when we get caught, he'll be shot by the Gestapo. And they let out\nrumors more and more they were killing. It was true. They been -- the Germans around\nthere caught a lot of underground people in those woods. And the only thing -- the only\nsalvation people had, the Germans were scared to death for the woods. For woods they\nwere afraid, because they know with the underground is no place to play. They when\nthey do a job, they do it. They blew up five train loads with soldiers right in this section.\nIt was a very worthwhile section for the underground, that even Moscow had been\nsending the partisans by plane in those sections. Well, and when we came to them, we\ncould stay only three weeks and we had to move out again. Had it rough. That moving is\nterrible. Why we had to move? It was right before Christmas, and before Christmas all\nthe families had got together for the holidays, and the people were laying there in a big\nbottom covered up in straw and hay, and we were afraid that the kids, that two small kids\nwere came also, that they'll start getting noisy, and going up inthe ___ in daytime, they\ncan find us. Then Paskefski -- Paskofski, I got ahold of Edna's uncle, and told him, I\nsaid, \"Take us out of there. He's afraid to keep us.\" Because we could been -- all could\nget in dangers. We had to move out again from this place and go looking for another\nplace. The only place we decide -- which I decided with Edna's uncle, it would be --\nthere was Paskavitzes was the first one, but this was Paskofski. This was two separate\nfamilies. Another one, Paskofski. Paskofski was a very, very, very poor farmer, a very\nreligious man. Nice man. And he done it anything for a reason. He didn't took from me\n-- didn't even want to take from me. I offered him money. I had a few gold pieces. I\nsay, \"Take it to him only at least one for memory for me.\" He took one. We used to sit\ndown outside at night. The only conversation with each other. At 1:00 o'clock at night,\nand talking about the things, what's going on, what's happening in the world, with the\nfight, what with all the traveling, with the predicting when can we be liberated. Here we\nalready have the war in Stalingrad. In Stalingrad with the Russians took the overhead,\nand they been already stopped. The German army to go forward and start already\npushing them back. And I tell them the war. When we came then to Paskofski, we were\na little happier. Why poor -- and nobody was looking for a poor farmer. Everybody --\nthe partisans came, they look for a partisan with money. A partisan with good -- buy\nammunition. And where they would find the ammunition? Right by the farmers. The\nfarmers used to sell the ammunition. They used to come in, and -- the partisans, and to\nthe farmers, and have the names and have everything they already knew also their\ninvestigation, through their investigation, what's happening. But Paskofski had two\npotato peats. And a potato -- you know what a potato peat? Ninety percent of the people\ndon't know, never heard of it, they don't know what it is. But a potato peat, there we used\nto lay. I was one cuple days in the barn sleeping there. I wasn't safe. I couldn't sleep. I\nwas scared all the time. Maybe somebody's coming in. And then I mostly staying right\nthere. And then Paskofski also have a German shepherd, a dog, smart like a -- called him\nVilgas (ph). I gave him a name Vilgas. Vilgas means wolf. And I been talking to him\nand eating together from one plate, bring him up and hand the bones, for the farmer had\nbones left over. Why, sometimes I went out with him to get soliciting help, soliciting\nfood from the farmers. I used to go with Edna's uncle. He knew everybody. He knew\nwhere to go in and where to stay away from; which house there was a friend, and if there\nwas an enemy right there; to know where to go, to watch their step and not to go. That's\nwhy we succeed, because Edna's uncle knew everything. Every step we do he say, \"Don't\nworry. Come back.\" We used to come in the morning, he say, \"You go and do your job.\"\nI say, \"What's your job? He say, \"Kill the lice.\" Ihate for-- __ shower for months,\nand they were covered up with all this stuff. But then the only thing early in the morning\na little sign of sun, a few rays came in, we stay in there and clean it up ourself that we\nshould be able to wear another day. And but then -- and the rest of them, the uncle, all\nmy cousins, we were 14 people in the two peats. And how I done the peats, one of them\nwere apart from the other, like from this wall until here, it was a tunnel. A tunnel that\nused to be able to go in and out. To go to the tunnel, you had to -- on your belly,\nparticularly for kids, you had to crawl up to the exit. And it wasn't such a easy job\nbecause we had five, three, five -- six kids, and they been for them it was there to play.\nFor Jay he was at that time five, he would crawl in there and crawl in here, who was\ncrawling faster. But I was scared to death that it could collapse. I didn't have any\nsupport. I put in a few branches, but that's all. And I said the ground could -- the sand\ncould fell and killed the kids. And then I would be in trouble; they would be all over us\ndead. It was rough. And Edna, when you say that Jay listen to me. He had to listen.\nAnd I told them, every one of them, that Iam the boss. That they should know not play\naround, not to run around, because our lives depend on it. Finally the kids, after they\nunderstood I was right, they already been controlling theirself. When somebody been\ntalking a little louder, the other kids would say, \"You shut up. You keep quiet.\" And at\nnight we used to go out and get some bread. And then when in day, in daytime, well, the\nwoman got to go out after all, say person cannot be all the time, we have empty stomach.\nAnd then we had to a fix up for that, too. A big bucket with all that outside and cover it\nup with potatoes, rotten, rotten potatoes. I made it that way that the rotten potatoes was\nhigh, and I'd been pulling with a string to opens it up a little opening, and all the rotten\npotatoes fills up the hole that you couldn't see the entrance And people been coming.\nFirst thing, the dog used to take care of a lot of things. Never did let nobody to come in\nclose by. I've been training him so that I didn't give him the bones unless he go and fix it\nup, get himself a place -- I did a job. I had some fun. And it worked. I've been talking to\nhim like to a person, and he believes me. And I'm staying one evening, and I used to go\nout to fix the peats. It was around 10:00 o'clock at time and all the farmers are asleep,\nand I shouldn't get in any troubles by staying and digging. I wasn't careful enough, and it\ncollapse on me. The sand from the  peats got together in one spot and got wrapped to\nhere in sand. It was terrible. I couldn't move. The first time I understood what it means\nbeing covered up with sand that 1s unable to move away nothing. I was staying in one\nspot. I couldn't even move a hand. Nothing. I couldn't even breathe, getting harder and\nharder to breathe. Vilgas was right with me. And I told Vilgas, \"I'm in troubles. Go and\nbring me Paskofski. Go and bring me Paskofski.\". And I showed him a bone, and it\ncooked. And he come to get for a bone. I took the bone. \"You go and bring him and\nthen I go give it to you.\" I been talking to him like I talk to a person. Anytime after I\nhave a lesson with a dog, the dog takes off. Where he goes, I don't know. I told him, I\nsaid, \"Go to the old man,\" the owner, the farmer. I said, \"Wake him up.\" But he didn't.\nWhat's happened, the farmer had a son, Stasook (ph). His name's Stacese (ph). That's he\nused to go -- every weekend go in the farm places, the music with ghettos, and go in there\nto dance and carry on. And passing by every time, automatically he used to pass by the\npeat. See how the dog didn't bother him. He knew him very well. And the dog seen\nStasook Stacese coming up, and he jumped right on him and start pushing him. His paw\nback, and should go front, and said go to the peat. And Stacese understood something in\ntrouble. \"Who's in trouble? Tell me,\" he asked the dog. And the dog grabbed him from\nhis coat, the coat, the side, and pulled me up to the hole to the peats where I been laying,\nand he dug me out. And I could move. I was a feeling like I got from dead to alive. It\nwas a terrific. And I got out. Then he say, \"Well, they'll make a meal.\" \"Okay. We\nmake a meal. I'll pay for it.\" We got a pig, and we had to smoke some for Jay. He loved\nJay, give him something to eat. And that's the way we got out for a while. Now, the war\ncame to Vilnius, and Vilnius from the place where the army, the Russian army was\naround 75 miles. And a week later, I seen the oldier. The soldier going clear up without\na___, with holes, with all that. And Paskofski tell me, he say, \"It's a Russian solder.\nIt's not a German. A German wouldn't go sloppy the way he's going.\" I say, \"Wait a\nminute.\" I look a minute. I say, \"Yeah, it's a German -- I mean Russian.\" I holler in the\nRussian language to him. He responds and come up to me. I ask him, \"What you doing\nhere? The Germans will kill you.\" \"No, they wouldn't kill me.\" I say \"What do you\nmean?\" He say, \"My army somewhere around here. They full now here around. Don't\nworry. Nothing going to happen to you, too.\" He knew right away. I told him how I got\nup there, and I sounded potato peats and all that stuff. And I say, \"Now I got to find --\ntell me, where is your captain? I want to talk to a captain, to anybody.\" He say, \"Let me\nfirst find him.\" I don't know about the Russian army. They go fight with the Germans\nand they don't know one from each other. But finally they come up, and he was one of\nthe Jewish captain. And I told him who I am, how I come here, and what's is here, and\nwho's Paskofki. And to be sure, he asked me a certain prayer, a Jewish prayer. I said,\nsay, it's a song, it's -- the captain, Russian captain say, \"I repeat it.\" Isay, \"All right. You\nokay. Now I know you're not the enemy. I am not afraid for you. You're not do me any\nharm.\" And he say, \"Where are you going?\" And I tell him I want to go -- the first thing\nto go to the ghetto to see maybe somebody from my family 1s alive.",
        "Q:Can I stop you here?",
        "A:Uh-huh.",
        "Q:I want to ask you some more questions about this time you were in hiding before you go back\nto your ghetto.",
        "A:All right.",
        "Q:If you don't mind.",
        "A:Okay.",
        "Q:So this period when you were in hiding lasted until when? Would you remember about the\ndate approximately?",
        "A:It could be to August Ist, 1943.",
        "Q:'45?",
        "A:'45,",
        "Q:'44. I'm sorry.",
        "A:Oh, '44, right. '44.",
        "Q:So you were really in hiding from December through till August about?",
        "A:Something like that, right.",
        "Q:About eight months or something?",
        "A:Right.",
        "Q:And in this time when you were in this hole, how did you get food? What did you do every\nday?",
        "A:I used to go out with Edna's uncle made arrangements with me. We going out soliciting.\nWhat we've been doing, at night about where I was going through, he knew the way, the\nplace there, the woods, going to farmers whom he knew, he knew very, very well. He\ndidn't have to be afraid for them. He go and knock on their door, on the window. And\nthey'll let him know by that knock that this is Itska, that is the farmer, Edna's uncle, and\nlet us in. And we've been buying from them. He be used to buy mostly a young calf and\nkilled it, cleaned it, and something to eat, smoke some, and use it for food, and that's\nwhat we been eating. Bread, I used to say to the farmer, you know, you've never seen.\nIt's very interesting. Two large racks, one on top of the other, and you carry the wheat\nand make flour out of it. And then we put it right in the oven and make bread. We had\nplenty to eat. It was no problem as long as we could go out and bring in.",
        "Q:And so you went out at night?",
        "A:At night.",
        "Q:Where was this oven? You mean in the farmer's house?",
        "A:Yeah, farmer's house.",
        "Q:So you had water and you had food and --",
        "A:We had -- we had everything. We didn't -- about food was no problem. It was no problem\neven in hiding, because -- but you got to be careful. You couldn't be reckless. I couldn't\nstay there. The farmer was tired also not doing nothing. I was tired not doing nothing.\nThen the farmer, I seen here now the same thing, got two long sticks. And I got one, he\ngot one, and we work hand in hand. It was very, very, interesting, and it's a good\nexercise. He sworn over the coal. I was the one -- and then we cutting the wheat and\nknocking it out and getting out the little -- what they call it in English? What they fill --\nthe cover is filled with it. The wheat is filled. The weights. Well --",
        "Q:Chap?",
        "A:Yeah, right.",
        "Q:What did you all -- okay. What did you do during the daytime?",
        "A:Sleep. And Edna and I couldn't do nothing. And it's enough hard work. My uncle will never\nforget. He used to tell me, \"You see, take a look at how bad people we are. The human\nbeing is terrible. You take and you beat up a horse. You don't go fast enough or you\ndon't pull strong enough, and then you get whipped and kicked and all that. Move, move,\nup the hill. We got enough--abig \u2014__ holler at him to get up the hill. We didn't go\nabout it. We didn't -- we complained to the horse and we whip him with the whip. \"And\nnow we are the horses. You are the horse and I am the horse. And now how is it? How\nit feels?\" He asked -- he been asking me how it feel being a horse. I say, \"Yeah, I'll\nnever forget it being that horse.\" Yeah.",
        "Q:We need to change the type right now. Okay?\nEnd of Tape 3\nTape 4",
        "Q:You had mentioned that there were partisans in this same area, and I was wondering whether\nyou had contact with any of them. But before -- I just want to clarify, where was this\narea exactly?",
        "A:Zezmer. Zezmer. It is a little town. It was one street, people living in one street. And there it\nwas between Vilnius and Kaunas. And there is a lot of woods, and it's the only place we\nhad to pick, because the Germans was afraid for the woods. The woods 1s a trap for\nthem. They were scared to death. When they already were in the woods and you seen a\nGerman group, even a battalion, could be 500, you don't have to worry about it. They\ndon't go fight. They scared. They look for another place for to run. And it's what\nhappened also with them. And we were -- every time we heard -- we heard a shot, we\nwere jumping for joy, because we seen here is Hitler getting beat and here we -- our time\nto be free is so close that you just touch it. And he already seen the Russians plane right\nover our head. You see that Paskofski had a lake, there's a lake on his land. And we\nwent there to swim and to lay in the sun. It was foolish of us, too. We could get shot. A\nGerman plane could seen here we're having a good time laying in the sun, and here we\ngot to still fight a war. It they can shoot us.",
        "Q:You did this while you were in hiding?",
        "A:In hiding. It done like a fool, didn't know what to do. I just was worried. And I told Eeyicka\n(ph), I say, \"Why are you in there?\" He was heading there on teaching the children. You\nsee, he didn't had nothing to do, and the kids he want to get educated. He didn't have any\nbooks. They didn't know the alphabet. Nothing. He only worked from the prayer book\nit's what they had. He teach these boys how to read the alphabet. And what he done,\nthey been sitting under a little hole, and there was a ray to -- a ray from the sun coming\ndown, and it's a wide clear place, and there he was sitting with these two boys, and he\nwas teaching the bible. And I tell him, \"I am going to take a swim.\" He say, \"Don't need\naswim.\" Well, but I done it. I done to the lake. The next day I was smarter. I talk to\nPaskofski, and I told him, \"Would you make me a bath?\" And he done. He laugh a little.\nTsay, _____. -What he done, he took rocks he had, he put the rocks with wood, special\nwood in with the rocks, which red hot from the heat, and there he been__\u2014_annd giving\nme -- we used to say a shoulder, a cold shoulder make warm. And it was just the best,\nbest moment in my life. Many people ask me what I felt and what I want and what I used\nto at that moment. I say the hottest and enjoyable and best thing that happened to me is\ngetting the bath by Paskofski. It give me -- it was terrific. And then one day, I am sitting\nthere. I am walking in my office, and I take a look at farmer's wife crying, carrying on. I\nsay, \"What's the matter, Mrs. Paskofski?\" She say they locked up her husband. I say,\n\"Who locked up?\" She say, \"The Russian commander. They locked him up. They say\nhe don't want to go in the army.\" I say, \"Tell him he's crazy.\" Paskofski was a man\nalready in the 70s, don't want to go in the army. I say, \"Let's go. We'll take him out.\nDon't worry. Don't cry. I'll get him back.\" I took and I had a jeep, put her in the jeep,\nand I went back to the place where we were in hiding. And I got in Zezmer, in one of the\nplaces between Vilnius. And I told them, I say -- I tell them who I am, and I came in here\nto get Paskofski out. I say, \"Why are you taking and arresting a man who is already 70,\ntime already to die, and you lock him up because they find out a hiding place?\" The man\nsay that -- that captain, I don't know what, the major. He say, \"Well, you know what he\ndone?\" I say, \"He didn't done nothing.\" He say, \"What do you mean done nothing? He\ntook a bunch of drunks,\" and he say, \"put them in a hole that they shouldn't go. They had\nto go register for the army. They didn't went to register for the army; they went to drink\nright there in the peats where -- what you build. And the first thing I don't know is you\ndone it.\" I say, \"Why are you doing?\" I say, \"Ask my question. How it looks and what\nyou want to know. I ain't going to let you know from the peat, if the peat is right or is a\nwrong peat.\" Well, and this gave me -- I say, \"All right. Tell me what if -- what is in that\nplace and what is that place.\" I had to make a plan, and hey let him out. And then I got\nPaskofski out. I say, \"Don't go out. I'll take you back.\" And it's 50 miles almost. I took\nhim back. And anyway, I got Paskofski. Now Stasook, his son, he's the one that start the\ntroubles. He told the neighbors that is the refugees running and hiding in here. They\nbeen there and they messed it up and he get blamed. But they took him in the army.",
        "Q:Well, I was asking you if when you were 1n hiding before the liberation you had contact with\nany of the partisans in the area. Did you ever run across them?",
        "A:Yeah, run across them, but it wasn't much. They -- they -- in that area, they used to come\nregular routine to get food. And they been telling -- find out there's a rich farmer, he got\nlot of meat, a lot of butter and all that stuff, they been asking. They told him they go pay\nwhen you want to go pay, but you got to have food to eat and they got a lot of children,\nand it was a lot of groups, big groups. And then the farmer wasn't so anxious to give, and\nhe told him a couple times, I say, \"They don't want any monkey business. They want\nfood. They're not -- they'll take it alone. When they'll take, they'll take everything that\ngoes.\" And they settled and they gave them food to eat. And it wasn't such terrible. But\nthey were ready to fight with what killed a lot of them. The -- not the Lithuanians -- not\nthe Germans, but the Lithuanians. The Lithuanians say, \"Woods doesn't mean nothing,\nbecause they live in the woods. The Germans didn't go. And the men -- there was five\nexplosions that let the railroad go, breaking the rail and been blown up.",
        "Q:So this was all going on around you?",
        "A:Yeah.",
        "Q:Did it give you hope? Was it encouraging?",
        "A:Yeah, that give me hope. I was encouraged already before, because the shooting was going\naround already so close, but beyond there, what -- what's happened? The Germans had\nthat part of ____\u2014_\u2014s occupied, and they been there having all kind of whiskey. Was a\ndistillery from vodka, and they big drunkards. And when they came to that place, the\nRussians, they start drinking, and been drinking for three days, and got so drunk they\nwere laying like dead. And they didn't know what was going on at that time. The\nGermans come back and they really give them some blows and they lost a lot of soldiers,\nthe Russians. And this messed up -- messed up the ghetto, because they were so close to\nget to Kovno. Everybody was so anxious. And Golub also, Tory, talk with the Miller\nfrom the Gestapo, and beg them and offer them a big amount of money, and told him to\nhelp see that his life will be protected, that nobody will touch them. But Miller didn't go.\nDidn't took it.",
        "Q:Okay. Let's -- now we can -- unless you have more to say about the hiding period.",
        "A:No, it's most of the hiding period.",
        "Q:Did you pray a lot or no?",
        "A:I didn't have from what to pray. I didn't have no books. I prayed. I did pray.",
        "Q:You thought God would help you out?",
        "A:Right. It was a nice, young man. He reminds me of what 1s it? Christ. Tall, nice looking\nyoung man was with me in the working spot right by the place where the German army\nbeen moving out from Lithuania already back to Germany. The army all been pulling. It\nwas a nice size, not too big, but it was a nice size. And they pass by this part where we\nworked with the young man, his name was Settleson (ph), and myself. We were there\naround 30 people. Our work was to rifemeister. Rifemeister. I'd been a place of fixing\nammunition.",
        "Q:Yeah.",
        "A:And we been staying and cleaning them. And he knew the place. And the boy -- and when he\nhad -- made that a place to hide, dugged out the hole and stayed there, and he was already\nlucky. The army had been going passing by, the German army. And the German soldier,\nwho was one of our workers, who worked with us to Gilligan's (ph) place, knew -- got in\nin the place. Maybe want to get a drink of water, maybe was looking for Mendleson. I\ndon't want what it was. But Wilson, the neighbor, told me that. And he shot him in the\nback and killed him the last minute of the liberation. And he was a tall, nice young man.\nAnd no luck, and finished.",
        "Q:When you went -- you told me that the Russians came in, you met them, and your first thought\nwas you wanted to go back to Kovno.",
        "A:Uh-huh, the ghetto.",
        "Q:So after you -- after the Russians liberated you, you went back to Kovno with them?",
        "A:No. I went by myself. I didn't need nobody. I ran; I didn't walk. Everybody was too slow for\nme. I was flying.",
        "Q:By yourself?",
        "A:By myself to the ghetto. People saying, \"What's the matter, man? What's you running?\" I\ntold Mr.\u2019 Wilson, it was a man who let me stay in his house, oh, a couple nights before I\ngot settled in Kaunas. But in the meantime, I went -- I went there by myself and I run in\nthe ghetto. I knew I had to see a picture. I see it, and it was terrible stage for my eyes.\nHere 1s laying a hiding place with the man Monkey (ph), Monk's hiding place. The name\n-- they call the nickname Monk. And he had the best possibility to make a hiding place,\nbecause they had a money, they had the material, and he done it. And you couldn't find\nthe place nowhere to search. That's where he was. My mother, she still was in his hole\ntoo, because they told me in ghetto yet that my mother, \"Don't worry about your mother.\nShe got the best place. She got the Monk's Melina,\" they call it. And it was too hard to\nfind it. Nothing. I went brick by brick, piece by piece, looking around inside, in the peat.\nCouldn't find nothing. I had to leave. I had to ask the people, maybe the neighbors,\nmaybe they know. They say, well, they don't know what's happened. Could be it was a\nlot of fire going on. When they used to find out the place that people didn't report to go\nby train back to Germany, they used to put them on fire, burn them up. And here is one.\nAnother one was Vinetrop (ph), was another hiding place. And they say it's only a\nquestion of minutes they'll be liberated. They were all full of hope that they'll be\nreleased, but it didn't work that way. And there was maybe about 10 people, they laying\noutside of the ghetto. They also been put the place in the hiding on fire, but they start\nrunning and been shot and been killed and be laying. There was a young girl, a friend of\nmine -- her father was a friend of mine, laying in front. His father and mother all burned.\nAnd here going around -- and then people, funny, going around. A woman with a big\nstick, with a long piece of metal at the end, and digging in the groundlooking. I say,\n\"What you doing?\" He say, \"I'm looking for the Jews' gold,\" it was the answer. Well,\nand come back.",
        "Q:The fires were still going?",
        "A:Some of them was glowing underneath, yeah. Not -- it was all burned up. It was nothing left.\nBut some of them were still. And one -- one was lucky. They did now. Hoop (ph) was a\nrabbi, and the elf (ph) people, two handymens (ph) been hiding under a brick and under\ncement blocks. A homes built on cement hard blocks. And they were -- they're laying in\nthe basement. And also hided entrance that nobody -- or somebody will come and see\nand say, \"No way to go in here. Nobody's there.\" But the building collapsed, and all of\nthem survived by miracles. They were hollering and hollering from the outside. There\nwas one rock keep the people up, don't let them to be squished. And they got out.\nSomebody helped them. I was in there at that time, too. Yeah. It was awful. Then I\ncame back looking for my sister's furniture. My sister just got married and she bought\nbeautiful veneer, a bedroom set and a living room. And there was a Lithuanians, and she\ngave it to them to hold it. Who'll come first. If she'll come first, she'll take it back or I'll\ntake it back or I'll buy it. It was beautiful furniture. But I come up to the building. It was\njust a brand new building being built by a professor from Lithuania, from the university.\nAnd it was a old woman left. They all disappeared, the people who lived in that house,\nbut I had to find the furniture. You could see the table was stained. The coffee was still\nsteaming, still going like steam. And ham and eggs and good -- a good meal. They ate\nand left it half eaten, didn't have time to finish to eat and they run off. And they run away\nand stay away for three months. Finally, get them back. Was no use for me to keep\nthere, so I could go and buy me a home.",
        "Q:So you went -- did you then go back and get Edna and Jay?",
        "A:Yeah, right. They still were in the farm there by her uncle. I went back and got them, brought\nthem. And I went to work to my job. You see, I was the second time under the Russians\nin that time. I got my job as a dispatcher. And then I was the Jewish Council working\nfor the different kind of trials with the communists and the people. And I had problem\nwith the survivors. A lot of girls came back, I think -- did I told you that? See it was\nconcentration camp come back, people to Lithuania, to Kovno, to Slobodka, come\nlooking for their parents, for their relatives. And it wasn't a job that was easy to find, but\nfinally we got them together. I was in charge of candy factories. I was in charge of\ncakes. All this stuff, I was in charge of it. I had special groups in room, and we used to\nbake it and make it and sell it. And when the Russian people used to get cards, card\nsystem. They getting for cards so many pounds of sugar, or for so many pounds of sugar\nyou getting so many pounds of candy. And that's the way I used to divide that everybody\nshould get it. Comes a holiday, I used to work it out that they should have some sweets\nfor the holidays. But then they start fighting with each other. Woman fight with each\nother. It's a job, and I am in the middle. And what I done, I took -- I had to separate --\nseparate. You a Jewish lady, you stay in that part of the table or that room, and you work\nin that room, and don't let them fight with each other.",
        "Q:You're talking about the Jewish people and the Lithuanian people --",
        "A:Right.",
        "Q:-- that were working for you?",
        "A:Right.",
        "Q:Okay.",
        "A:But I kept them separated. They couldn't have been fighting with each other. They were -- in\na way I can't blamed them. They were hungry. They had been eating the raw dough. I\ncould see they're eating it. I say, \"You'll get sick.\" No. They were -- anyhow, they\nreported, and in come -- the year, the Gestapo, they go and in come -- in come the\ncriminal police. And they called me in and give me a warning. I say one more time and I\ngo get caught, I'll -- they send me Siberia. And I have no business to mingle in\ngovernment business. They were right, but I didn't have no choice. They were --",
        "Q:Now, why did they think -- what were you doing wrong?",
        "A:Well, I didn't have the right to give away the sugar and give away the candies when they got to\ngive for Russians by the Russian government. The Russian been giving it out. It comes\n-- somebody come with tickets, and tickets like here we have in the cards.",
        "Q:Uh-huh.",

        "Q:When you came back, how did you get hired for this job?",
        "A:I had the job already in 1940 before the war. Before the war was the Russians, the\ncommunists, together with the Germans together divided Lithuanian in half. Half of\nLithuanian Poland belonged to the Russians and half --",
        "Q:I thought then you were working for a transportation cooperative?",
        "A:Right. That was already later. This was before. But later they were the cooperative with the\nhorse and buggy. I worked for them, and they helped me to get my job.",
        "Q:Oh, they helped you to get your job after the war?",
        "A:Right, after the war.",
        "Q:I see. Now, let me just ask you a question: When you went back to Kovno, did you -- did you\never think maybe I don't want to go back there?",
        "A:Where?",
        "Q:After the war --",
        "A:Right.",
        "Q:-- did you think maybe I should not go back to Kovno, things were very bad when I left?",
        "A:This doesn't bother me. I had a good job. I didn't -- and I didn't want to go. I want to go\nback. I want to find out what's happened to my family, where was closest my family. I\nwas so anxious. And the people used to come and tease me and teasing Edna saying, \"I\nmet you mother back in Kennicksburg. I met your sister.\" We were thinking it's true. I\nsay, \"Well, we're going in Kovno and we go find out.\" I came in Kovno and I see the\nJewish girl go around to the Gestapo man. It was the captain from the brigade -- from\nSunsulaga (ph) there. They had a laga, what they call it? A place of work that was a\nfactory, and they been working at the factory. And I don't remember the -- how it was in\nthe details. I had to give up.",
        "Q:But you didn't find your family. Were the Lithuanians -- when you came back, did the\nLithuanians treat you okay?",

But the Lithuanians with the Jewish girls been fighting.\nAnd then I got five drums of gasoline came in. I said, \"What is that for?\" He say they\ndon't know. I got to take it. I've been allocated five drums of benzine for the trafay\n(ph),\" which means the . And I need to go and find a machine or anything to get in\nGermany for home. I said have enough gasoline, trucks are no problem. I said get it and\nbring it back. They call it a trafay. And that's the way it was with me. I came home. I\nstart looking for family. I couldn't find nobody. Decide to move on. And then I had\nproblem. I say, no place for me to stay. I came to Munich. And in Munich I --",

        "A:It wasn't easy. I worked to move to Munich. It wasn't easy.",
        "Q:Tell me about the journey. How did you get out?",
        "A:I get out -- when I got a job, went to the Russian. I stayed there and worked with them enough\ntill the girls start fighting, and I decide I go separate them. One group here and one go\nthere and there be peace. And I put on a big sign, \"No vacancies.\" I don't have any work.\nThey shouldn't bother me, so let me work. And they reported, and they come -- the\nRussian city police, and they come and run to me and they say, \"Who give you the right\"\n-- and I didn't like that -- \"to say who should live\" -- I mean, \"who should be the boss\nover the factory and who not. You do what the government tells you to do. Don't do any\nwrong. Here is you got to know is a Russian system, a communist system. It's not a\ncapitalistic way of doing it.\" And they lay me out and put me in jail. And here I am\nlaying there. My luck was that the office was -- the office girl was a sister of one of my\nbosses for the Russians whom I was working, and she went and called up her brother and\ntold him that I am locked up. And here my boss was a Russian captain, come up. He\nsay, \"What you doing here? What's happened?\" I say, \"I don't know. They locked me\nup.\" \"For what?\" I say, \"They say I bought -- for gas, I bought a truck. I had to have a\ntruck. What good is for me four drums of gasoline when I don't have any truck?\" And\nthis is the way the system works for the Russians. And they say, \"Wait a minute. They\ncannot tell you what to do, buy or not buy.\" And it was a general came up and he needs\nthe gas, and you got the truck, and you got a merchandise he wants. \"I need your gas to\nswap you for a truck,\" and I got a opal (ph) car -- I mean an opal truck, a ton and a-half\nton, for two drums of gasoline. Then I had transportation around _, got two\nand a mechanic. And everybody were working. Nobody was looking for jobs, and I\ngave them jobs. But a girl report me, what I was doing.

They'll straighten themselves up.\nThey'll stop fighting, because it be livelihood involved. But it took a little while when\nthey start to straighten theirself out.",

We got\nto do it in one day, and -- number one. And number two, I want to be in the courthouse.\nI want to see it also, and you promise me a ticket.\" \"We're going.

And when you go give me, I\ngive you a pack of cigarettes.\" Then the German say, \"I have only one room on the third\nfloor, and it's the only one you can get. I don't have another one.\" I say, \"Wait a minute.\nLet me take a look.\" I run up upstairs, took a look. I say, \"Well, we can sleep. That\nwould work.\" Come down, and I told Benger Young, I say, \"Look here. I got one room\nwith one bed. Come and take a look. When you okays it, you have it. You can go my\nbed.

All of them want me to go to Israel.\nBecause I made a deal, I talk with Benger Young, and we're going to Israel to open up a\ntransportation office in American style. We buy trucks and all that mess. And the plan\nwould work when I could have a little help. And I came to -- to go to Israel, they took\naway one certificate if you worked all over less two. If it weren't for Jay; 1t weren't for\nmy wife. And I come back home after work and I told Edna, I'm not excited.

And Byrd went to for to Yonkers and got three visas -- I mean two visas, not\nthree. And we didn't answer -- or enter with only -- what can we do with only two? We\nneed the third one. Well, until the war to end, it came from the States. It came in a visa\nfor me and for Edna and for Jay. And it was too late. And I was so upset. I want to go\nthere and I wind up here.

I got a Christian\nJews Conference. I got a Naborite Service Award. I got a Naborite top lot president -- I\ngot plenty. And it's not because I got pushing it out. No, the way it comes itself. I feel\nbecause I went through life so different variations, movements, that now everybody --\neverybody. I say everybody. A lot of people come to me ask advices. Why do they ask\nfor advices? For my experience. I went through hell. I give my advice. I say, \"What's\nthe matter? You going to tell me I don't know what I'm talking about or you don't know\nwhat you talking about? You don't know what you want. You know what you want. But\nyou got to make up my mind.\" People want to go and want to have it done for nothing.\nYou can't get nothing for nothing. Well --",

        "Q:Tell me.",
        "A:That now the government repeat, it repeats itself. Particularly Europe. They -- the Balkans,\nwhat's going on in the Balkans is terrible. And who go have the -- we go expect a war\nwith the Lithuanians and Poles. I don't know. I have a feeling like that, because they\ngoing the same way as they went in 1947, '48.",
        "Q:And that frightens you?",
        "A:That frightens me. Who wants to have it? We had enough. We don't need any wars no more.\nAnd the way it's going now, you never know what's going to happen. They still cannot\nsettle between theirselves the arguments. The politicians, they are a bunch of no-goods.",
        "Q:Is there anything, just the ordinary life in the United States, that frightens -- that makes you\nthink of the past and --",
        "A:Yeah, there was a easier life. Now we going -- we going over a new period of life which we\ncan't compare. Now the computer price -- the computer life, I mean. The computer life,\nit's anew way of life, and it is changed the human being. In the next 10 years, we don't\ngo recognize ourself.",
        "Q:But I may be -- I'm not explaining my question very well.\nWhat I'm trying to ask you is, if in just the daily life today there are certain things, certain\nsounds, certain things you see or think about, that all of a sudden make you remember something\n50 years ago and are very disturbing that bring it back to you?",
        "A:The street life. It 1s terrible. The murders, murdering, suing each other, children problems.\nThe cancer problems, cancer sickness. They would kill this cancer when they would put\ntheir mind 1n it. I don't believe it, it's not that 1t couldn't be conquered. But every other\nthing, all kind of items, and the making the life miserable for their own self in\nplace of making it beautiful, beautiful life. But they don't straighten out, it will be rough,\nbecause I can see a lot of -- a lot of fights here going on. And, well --",
        "Q:What message should we learn from all of this? From everything you've told me, what should\nsomebody who's listening to this take away from it, the most important thing?",
        "A:What people should learn from this?",
        "Q:Yeah.",
        "A:They should learn a new life, because a life is now come to a dead point. And mostly land 1s\ncontrols the people's life. Land and girls, and all the fights with one with each other,\nkilling each other. Here it's not as bad as in little Richmond. It 1s a village. It's not a\nnight for two, three killings. Blacks, whites. Mostly blacks. Whites is not so bad. But\nstill a human being, I don't care who it is. And something life itself, when itself without\nhelp and change. Life need help. It needs to get out from their assistance. We need to\nhelp the economy got to have a boost. And, well, too much inner fighting between one\nand the other. Very, very hard. They still talking?",
        "Q:Yeah. Do you think in the world, is religion really that important?",
        "A:No. No. I don't care about religion. Religion brings no -- we got to be mixed in between one\nand another. It's rough. And it started in Iran. It were the biggest problems. And then\nthere's Lebanon -- the Middle East, another war should come up.",
        "Q:But you are a practicing Jew?",
        "A:Yes.",
        "Q:Religion is important to you?",
        "A:Right. Because -- well, it 1s religion like here. Listen two weeks ago was a rabbi in\nRichmond. He been talking. And he say the only thing what he wants is to conservative,\nconservative Jew. And he say there, what we got to do every day, we got to put on\nchilum (ph). You know what chilum is? You know up around there. And we got to see\nto help and to do and to pray. And it wouldn't give me nothing. All this, what's we get\nfor the human being. Right now we still don't see nothing. We say -- I didn't see yet\nafter 50 years to get rid of Hitler would start coming back, everything. Here I've been\ntalking 50 years ago to the same farmer, Paskofski, living outside and talking to Mr.\nPaskofski, \"What do you think about life?\" That's what we be talking. I'd be asking him\nright there by the door from the Holocaust. And he say, \"You know, you so right. You\nso right.\" That I say, \"Let's -- I can tell you one thing. We still going to have a beautiful\nlife in front of us. I don't see it yet.\" Italkto_\u2014\u2014\u2014. TIknow him. He came to\nRichmond, and I talked with him. I say, \"Tell me something. I cannot understand how\ncome until this day nothing didn't been done about the Holocaust.\" He say, \"Such a\ntragedy happen to the Jewish people, what have you done about it? You should know\nwhat to talk. It's you should know how to answer the questions. Where are you? What\nyou doing? You're telling me__,\" it's a little story where they mean nothing. He\nsay, \"Let me tell you something. History is not written in a day. History doesn't been\nwritten ina month. History takes years to write. The Holocaust will take 50 years before\nthe historian will start doing anything.\" Right. Smart. I say, \"You right. I agree with\nyou on that.\" But don't wait until 200 years; 50 years is enough. We lived the 50 years,\nand now give us what we need. Give us peace. It's enough. I was with him for a good\nwhile. He's a smart man. Some of them didn't like him, but I liked him. He is one of the\nprophets. Very interesting.",
        "Q:Is there anything else you want to -- I don't have any more questions. Is there anything else\nyou want to say?",
        "A:I don't know. The main thing what I want to say was to get ready of thought of Holocaust.\nWe should never -- not have any Holocaust problems. We should be out of the books.\nWe should get ready world, all the dopes (ph) and all the sicknesses and all the killings.\nIt's unbelievable to be seen a person today, a young person start dying because of nothing\nbeen done about it. A week ago a man, a good friend of ours, he's only 56 years of age.\nCancer. All why? Well, his time comes, he got to go, they say. That is their answer.\nThat's not the answer. The answer is we're not doing enough. I remember when my\ngrandfather died at what, 56. He was already old man. He died, and he was 56 years of\nage, but he can still live another 30. Well, well, sometimes you done a lot of wrong\nthings to yourself. You can be smart enough. You need help and other people too to\nadvise you. Life is not a life of one man. We have certain people think they are. Get\nalong, they're not.",

You talked about trying to get\nout of Lithuania in the very beginning when the Germans came in and how you were able\nto get horses and buggies and all of this, even though it didn't work. Why 1s -- did\neverybody have that opportunity?",
        "Q:Right. Okay. But --",
        "Q:Let me -- let's go back a minute. I've now learned that you were -- you had a good position in\nthe transportation cooperative, because of your education and your uncles and your\nfamily. Why did somebody in the community come to you in the beginning to go talk to\nJordan?",

        "Q:Let me now, let's just talk about the ghetto for a while; okay?",
        "Q:If you don't mind. You said before that after the Germans took over there were all kinds of\nlaws, what Jews could and could not do. Then soon after, did they decide you had to go\nlive in a ghetto? When did that happen?",
        "Q:Now, did you have to move into this ghetto?",

So do you -- is there anything more that you can tell me about these horrible\nactions, the -- what happened with the small ghetto or what happened with the big action\nat the end of October?

        "Q:You were saying that it was better to work inside the ghetto?",
        "Q:Why is that?",
        "Q:Well, but now, isn't it possible that 1f you worked outside the ghetto you had more of an\nopportunity to do business or to get extra food or that kind of thing?",

        "Q:Five years.",
        "Q:It must have been difficult to have a such a young child at that time.",
        "Q:But did you ever think of trying to get him to safety or to maybe to stay with some of the\nLithuanian people without you so that you could move about more freely?",

        "Q:And your wife's family?",
        "Q:But they -- when they took your wife's family, how did that come about?",
        "Q:Okay. Why don't you tell me a little bit about how you left the ghetto. How you and Jay and\nEdna left the ghetto to go into hiding. You told me that you had made arrangements\nthrough her uncle. Would you prefer to stop now?",

        "Q:You did this while you were in hiding?",
        "Q:Well, I was asking you if when you were 1n hiding before the liberation you had contact with\nany of the partisans in the area. Did you ever run across them?",
        "Q:So this was all going on around you?",
        "Q:Did it give you hope? Was it encouraging?",
        "Q:Okay. Let's -- now we can -- unless you have more to say about the hiding period.",
        "Q:Did you pray a lot or no?",

        "Q:So after you -- after the Russians liberated you, you went back to Kovno with them?",
        "Q:By yourself?",
        "Q:The fires were still going?",

        "Q:When you came back, how did you get hired for this job?",
        "Q:I thought then you were working for a transportation cooperative?",
        "Q:Oh, they helped you to get your job after the war?",
        "Q:I see. Now, let me just ask you a question: When you went back to Kovno, did you -- did you\never think maybe I don't want to go back there?",
        "Q:After the war --",
        "Q:-- did you think maybe I should not go back to Kovno, things were very bad when I left?",
        "Q:But you didn't find your family. Were the Lithuanians -- when you came back, did the\nLithuanians treat you okay?",
        "Q:Was it easy to get to Munich?",
        "Q:Tell me about the journey. How did you get out?",
        "Q:Okay. Well, let me ask you a couple of questions about Kovno after the war, if you don't\nmind. Did the Jewish community there start to rebuild itself?",
        "Q:Yeah. When you were working there under the Russians.",
        "Q:In Kovno.",
        "Q:So you got to Munich --",
        "Q:-- and you got a job with the Joint Distribution Committee. What were you doing for them?\nA. Transportation officer. I was in charge over the trucks and cars. And see, it was so many\ncars and trucks left over in Europe, that Eisenhower decided to leave it in Europe. He don't need\nthem in the States. Cost him more money to transfer them over than to get rid of them. And he\nsay, \"Here, you can take the trucks,\" and he gave the American Joint Distribution Committee. I\nhad 30 trucks together with jeeps. And when speakers used to come from the States talking\nabout the future for humanity and all that, and I used to get -- take my own jeep, send the speaker\nto Landsberg, to Feldafing, to all of the German cities. And they been gradually build\nthemselves these communities. I also came in at Munich here, they didn't have a synagogue.\nAnd I decided got to do it, to build a synagogue for the kids to go to school. And I went to the\nhead man of the -- of where my American Joint Distribution Committee sexton works. Told\nhim, \"How can we be without synagogue, without a school? I need a school and synagogue.\"\nThey say, \"Go to the governor. The governor will give it to you.\" I say, \"Are you joking?\"\nThey say, \"I'm not joking. Go ahead.\" I went to the governor, and I didn't know what's all about.\nI knocked on the door. I open up the door, and here I seen a big, heavy set man with a cigar\nsitting there, and also a German girl sitting next to him, and he asked the girl, he say, \"Ask him\nwhat he wants.\" And she asked me what I want. I said, \"I need a permit to build a synagogue in\nthe English garden.\" \"Is there a section?\" \"A beautiful section,\" I say. \"There is a place for the\n, and I would like it to get a permit.\" Then the governor -- the person to send the man, I said,\n\"You should go with me in the P.X. and get cards and come with me to buy $500 P.X. and build\na synagogue.\" And I told the girl, I say, \"Tell him it's not enough, 500. I need more money.\"\nHe looked at me. \"Look,\" he say, \"I not a banker. I don't have any money to give away, and\ndon't bother me. I gave you $500. You want now -- I give you for a synagogue. Now you want\na synagogue and a school.\" Well, and I say, \"Well, tell the girl, tell her $1,000 a piece\" And I",

        "A:Okay. My name is Israel Ipson. I've been born in Lithuanian in 1911, March 15th, 1911.\nAnd my father was a worker, worked in the brewery. The brewery was in Slobodka.\nWhy is it the brewery was in a place in Slobodka? You know, the Lithuanians didn't\nwant to have the industry, what coming up, to the Lithuanians, that they should have it.\nThe Jews were not allowed to go to work in Kovno, which Kovno was the capital city of\nLithuania, so we had to go to work in Slobodka. Slobodka was a suburb. In Slobodka\nlives around 10,000 Jews. Mostly the poor. They didn't have nothing to eat, and it was a\npity. For where I come from a very, very poor family. My grandfather worked in the\nbrewery with Golswolf Ingleman (ph). My father worked in the brewery. My uncle --\nalmost everybody in the poor Jews in Lithuanian worked for the brewery. Why? The\nowner from the brewery was the Wolfs, Wolf brothers. There were six brothers. The\nfamily were the Wolfs, and they were a very philanthropic family. And they support the\nJews. How? They build the brewery, and everybody almost work for the brewery. They\nalso invent a time -- used to be a time where full of snowing. In Lithuanian 1s a lot of full\nof snow, and they used to be covered up and drowned in snow. Was sending in with\nhorses for the brewery to get the people, bring them back to the place of work. That's\nhow heavy the snow it was. And my father was liked by the brewmeister (ph). The\nbrewmeister was a German from Bavaria, and he was his helper. Anything -- the war got\nto be -- now my father used to do in the brewery, the brewmeister done only sit and got\nthe taste of the beer, the color. I remember father used to -- I used to bring my father\nlunch every day. My mother used to send me potato sweet herring. It would want that\nmy father should be thirsty, be able to drink the beer and save the tune for the beer, they\ncall it. And the pilsner and all the names, they funny. And it's the way the poor Jews in\nSlobodka, they make their living. Later on when Lithuania become an independent\nnation run by a school teacher, or the name Smetona, he gave the Jews more right. What\nhe done, he brought the Jews away from the brewery. The brewery was filled with ;\nbut it opened up more industries to the Lithuanians to make him happy. Smetona was a\nsmart -- very -- was such a nice man. Tried to help also the Jews to participate in the\nindustry. It shouldn't be any fights between the Jews and the Lithuanians, try to avoid it.\nBut still after, there's still was plenty bad feeling between one and the other. And what\nhas happened, the biggest problem I think what it was, the Lithuanians start taking out --\nthe German took the Lithuanian out and send them to camps to work. They also, the\nRussians, the communists, was being picked, like the school teachers, manufacturers, the\nricher element of people, they used to be sent to Siberia, blaming them for the things\nwhich not happened. But also the Jews didn't knew nothing about it, but they should be\nsaying that the Jews kill their own, that take no other Lithuanians to Siberia. Siberia was\na -- the camp, a labor camp. It is a very, very, very miserable place to be. But mostly 90\npercent from the people who be sent to Siberia been dead because they didn't seem to\ncome back alive.",

        "A:Right. Well, I was also came in time when we didn't have any telephones; we didn't have any\nlights. Iused to goinschool___ they call 1t.. What was the -- ever was the old person,\nknowledgeable, been pitching for pay to the boys to go to hayda (ph), we used to call it.\nAnd at the hayda we used to come in and stay there until, in wintertime, 7:00, 8:00\no'clock at night until it get dark and bring them home. And that was our education to\npeople. Like my wife was just saying, she speaks good Jewish, the Jewish language. The\nJewish language was a language from childhood you got it up. And I had two rabbis,\nbecause one rabbi was the Hebrew language, another was Jewish. And then we had in\nSlobodka a rabbinical seminary. The biggest rabbinical seminary in the world, because\nin that time, in 1914, -17, the only thing they knew 1s to learn the bible. The people was\npoor. There was nothing to eat. They were sitting there all day long in the seera (ph),\nthey call it, it is a rabbinical seminary. And people from all over the world would be\nsending their youth to that seminary in Slobodka. It was not only later on -- the later\nyears grew up, itwas__ with their also young kids been going there to teach to\nbecome a rabbi. But it is really -- the big leaving to be a rabbi at that time, they couldn't\ndo nothing. They couldn't make it. But they been supported by the American people,\neven in World\u2019 War'I. They already been sending help to the Jews in Slobodka. The\nchief rabbis used to come in here and in speeches speaking through the American Jew to\nhelp the Jews in Slobodka, because all it be these weddings used to come between rabbis\nand -- and then the rabbi had a daughter who had got to get married, used to take along\nwith him the comment of a trip to America and find -- go to the seera to pick a boka (ph),\nto pick a learning young man that they should get married and been supported by the\nJews in America. It was a tradition to help the orthodox. And it is still rnght now in\nSlobodka. The seera is in existence now in Israel. They know more in Slobodka, but\nafter the war they move the chief rabbi, moved him to Israel.",
        "A:Right. And then I was -- after the learning, the religious learning, I went in high\u2019school. It\nbecame the Jews decided to open up a hipper (ph) high\u2019school. And it became the\nGermans in 1917 they had a lot of educated people in the army and they decided to stay\nin Lithuanian to teach us, and then we had enough people to get a private school going.\nAnd it was like one famous teacher, Karlbah (ph), and he -- in his name was created a\nhigh\u2019school, and it called Karlbah . And then we had also in the Russian language\na high\u2019school. And we had in Lithuanian we had three high\u2019schools. And then we had\nthe orthodox school was in Kovno. And everybody been happy until Hitler come to\nbeing.",
        "A:I have -- I had two sisters -- didn't have any brothers -- and they perished in the Holocaust.\nAnd one was married, and the other one was still a girl. She was married, but she was a\nfamous -- how you call it? Painting. She was a oil painting. She had a name. They ask\nher to come to Paris, and she was staying for three months in Paris and learning the\npainting guys. She come back with the famous paint pieces and all that stuff.",
        "A:Oh, I have, yeah.",
        "A:Very nice. Well, we been all together until I married. I was staying home with my parents.\nAnd my father, he was a orthodox Jew, and everything -- we used to come to holidays.\nWe took it together, like the Passover holidays, the high holidays, and we been meet\ntogether. Everybody would come. And the woman -- it was orthodox fashion, the prayer\nseparate. They have a separation between men and woman. But that reminds me\ndifferent moments that they -- I don't know what you call it. A helper who helps the\nsynagogue. Summis (ph), is that how you call it? Hell. I'll have to skip it. I don't know\nhow to say in English. They call them a special -- used to go out on every Friday night\nand say, \"Jews, you got to close the stores. There's all this = =~ coming around. Don't\ndo any business anymore.\" So someone got to stop them, and they used to stop it. But\neverything was fine until 2042 when the war started with Hitler and Stalin and Churchill.\nI used to like to listen to the shortwave radio. And the Jews which was locked up in the\nghetto, we used to come to my place where I lived to hear what's going on in the fronts.\nWell, how is Hitler doing? Well, Hitler is winning the war or losing the war? And we\nwas very interested in this. They come from my working place, which was the airport,\nand talking till the group, which used to come to listen to me, what's happened on the\nfront, how Hitler is doing. And they used to come up. To explain the truth, I was already\nscared. They could lock me up and find out about it, because if you were a Kraut. And I\nbe begging them they shouldn't come no more, because -- and I -- they didn't have a place\nnowhere to go, and they still -- I said, \"Tell them it's very important.\" And they were\nvery interested, like they would be generals, they used to tell me. One would sit here this\nway and one would sit that way, and they knew what they were talking about and they\nbeen leading the war.",
        "A:Uh-huh.",
        "A:I got married in 1931.",
        "A:Let's see. Well, I went -- in Lithuanian after I finished highschool, I went to college, and in\ncollege I took up law. And I was -- liked to stay with law. And I was doing all right. I\nhave a nice trade, because the law -- Lithuanians who have been all together in groups\nmostly going out together and discussing together, going to the -- every evening we used\nto come to one or to the other . And until Celingus (ph) was the ringstat (ph) or\njustice that come out with the decree that not one Jew cannot practice law until -- not no\nJew. I'm sorry. He didn't mention Jew. He said not one young man who graduated from\ncollege in Lithuania cannot practice law before he got to go in court who working for five\nyears. After the five years working in the court, he can practice law. I didn't have no\nchoice, but I still did not have any choice. I couldn't get in to work in the court, because\nthey answer -- when I used to send application to the courts and ask them for a job in\ncourt, to open it up that I should be able to become a lawyer, the answer used to be all the\ntime, \"Sorry. We don't have any vacancies. We cannot help you.\" And I couldn't get in\nin law.",
        "A:It was in 1932. And then one day it was -- it was a lucky moment with the courts. I had to get\na job already. Jay was born and I got married, I had to make a living. My father was\npoor. And I took a job as accountant and worked in a big concern (ph). And I worked\nthere, and one of my buddies, my friends from college, he recognized me that I came to\nthe government bank to pay a bill, I don't remember, for the company I work through,\nbecause the company asked me to make a deposit and I'm paying. That he was a\nLithuanian. He worked with chief of police. But he also went to the college. He come to\nme and say, \"Ipson, look. I got something.\" My name was Ipson. Iposon (ph) in\nLithuanian. \"I got something -- good news for you. Don't tell nobody, but I can give you\na tip now.\" Lithuanian didn't have any mechanical business, like cars, trucks, machinery.\nIt was a poor farm country, like 87 percent of the Lithuanians was farmer. Then they\ndidn't have nothing. And now already the countries like -- like now the Balkans, already\nthey are Czechoslovakia started in their time, Bulgaria. Here no one with fighting with\nall that stuff. And Hitler's told this Czechoslovakian, told the League of Nations -- was in\nat that time. Like the United Nations, it was the League of Nations. He told the League\nof Nations that he wanted Czechoslovakia, said that Czechoslovakia was his. And that\nstart already in that time beginning all the fights. But -- and I worked at the factory -- at\nthe company as accountant. And another one came to me, also. He say that's what me a\ngood job to be is the distributor of Belgian-made motorcycles. That was the F.N. F.N.\nstand for __\u2014.~ And I got the job for -- I like the motorcycles. I went to work for the\nmotorcycles, and that was lucky. I started making money. But it didn't last long. I had\nstarted and the war started and Stalin got in. They divided Europe in two halves: half\nHitler and half Stalin. And they divided that between themselves, and we didn't have\nnothing but what we had in the bank. We lost everything. Stalin took away all the few\npennies which we got it together. And I went on a trip to Belgium because of the fact\nthat they asked me. They want I should could come there. They want to talk with me\nabout a new contract. Because I am doing good and all that, I had to go to Berlin. And I\ncame in Berlin. I have relatives. My mother had a aunt living in Berlin, and she was a\nbeautiful girl. And the owner, her son, from the tobacco factory --___ \u2014=\u2014=\u2014s who was a\nfactory -- fell in love with her and they got married, and she became a rich girl. Then\nwhen my mother send her a letter said want I should became a doctor and she should give\nme aroom in her house. Well, and nothing could be worked out with all that, with all the\nwoman. And then in 1939, September 8th, I was in Belgium. I was in Belgium to the\nfactory. I was making a contract for the Karmann Ghia. Kristallnacht. You heard about\nKristallnacht? It was the night of Kristallnacht. I didn't know for nothing. I came, and\nmother told me and say I should take for her aunt a kilo bada (ph) and to take some -- a\nfew cheese, and she felt sorry for you, poor relatives they had. But I took it with me and\ngave it to them, to my mother's aunt, and I run in not knowingly in the Holocaust in the --\nnot in the Holocaust, in the Kristallnacht. What means -- Kristallnacht means crystal,\nbreaking windows, breaking in, the burning stores. Was a tremendous big store I was --\nbefore the war I used to go there, and in house father owned in Germany. And in that\nstore I used to -- anything -- they used to mark -- anybody who wants to make money\ngets $5 when he comes in here -- in Israel and goes to the colby (ph) store -- and go in the\nstore and ask for a product and can't find it, gets 5 mark. A premium for that. That's how\nproud they were with each other. And it was the next year I came there, but it was when\nit was Kristallnacht. All ready all over the streets \"Juden_\u2014\u2014s Traboden\" (ph) for the\nJews, the Jews not welcome. The Jews cannot come no more into the store. So we didn't\ngo there no more, because they took away the cars from the Jews and they took away the\nbusinesses, took away the bank accounts. Anything they had, they lost it. Then we\nstopped going. And then Hitler -- I mean Churchill used to -- on shortwave radio used to\nand tell Stalin, \"Be careful, Stalin, you're going to lose your head.\" And then, \"Your\ngood friend Stalin is getting prepared to fight you.\" And this was Ribbentrop. Stalin sent\nhis secretary of state Ribbentrop and -- no, the Hitler sent Ribbentrop and Stalin sent\nMolitof (ph). Molitof was for Stalin. They had been getting together one against the\nother keeping -- they didn't know what was going on until Churchill got into the act and\nstarted World War II.",

It was\nunbelievable, that we didn't even -- I had a big opportunity to go, but I was already\nmarried. I had a little child. Jay was four at that time, and I -- my hand was tied. I still\nsay, oh, it still not so bad. It still only right now who is closed (ph) is the poor little Jews,\nand the poor little Jews used to come to Lithuanian to find a place of where to hide,\nwhere to live. And I was in that time a young lawyer. I still could take cases, but I -- but\nthey used to come to me. They open up a office in Vilnius. Vilnius is the capital city of\nPoland right now, too. And I've been working out with them papers that they should be\nable to go to Japan. The only place that was open for the Jews to go in that time was for\nJapan, and everybody was running. But they had to get a visa, a visa from the Jewish\nCouncil. And they find out about me, and, you know, some of them had money to pay\nfor my work and some of them didn't have any money even. There was -- or they moved\n-- or the council moved away to Latvia -- Riga was the capital for Latvia -- ran away\nthere. I had to go over with them to help them there. It was -- it was rough. But I still\nhad my home. I didn't have to worry about Hitler, nothing. Only the Polish Jew had the\nproblem. That we knew through them that it's no good.

And -- now I remember, the\nname of Silver come up a day before and took away the wrong -- the visa with -- the men\nhad to get it, and he got it, the visa, and went to Japan. Later on it was a little easier\nbecause South Africa also had been given some -- letting in some Jews and it wasn't so\nbad. Then -- well, one day hell broke loose. Lithuanian or Kovno or Slobodka, was in\nthe valley surrounded by mountains. Beautiful, beautiful in nature. There was a little\ncabin with -- Napoleon built it, and there were a lot of people who was going -- all kind\nof talented people were going there in that little cabin painting and writing.

When\nthe party (ph) go and the people been living there. And it was everybody were happy.\nEverybody been in its place. It was status quo for years. And here, boom, Hitler didn't\nsay nothing, didn't announce that they . In fact, Stalin -- Stalin was living in the\n. I was in Moscow from time of the war. I was the only for a month.

When it used was to\nsnow and water, they didn't have any ground. And they had to have a airport because the\nwar was going away in Moscow. Hitler been pushing Stalin, that he wants to take\nMoscow and didn't have no airport. That's why they got to have a place to let the planes\ngo, and that's what he started with pushing strong. But Moscow was saved by the\nSiberiacs (ph), they call it, small, little people. They were mean, and they were ones who\nstopped Hitler by 15 miles from Moscow. Couldn't move.

And if you had a street, you would go.\nYou will go the long street, go from the bridge going on the way -- there was a way going\nyou could go to Moscow. If you go to Moscow and you got a car and you can go fast, I\ncan understand. But here, they are going with little children, pushing children's carts,\npushing to Moscow. But from Moscow -- from Kovno to Moscow was 1175 miles, and\nthey going with horse and buggy. And they'll never can reach there, because here was\nalready flying the Germans airplanes dropping them over the walking people and killing\npeople in the street. You could see here, boom, right lane already send people been killed\ngoing to Moscow. They couldn't go nowhere. You had to turn around and go back\nhome. We had no choice. And I had a little girl, a little girl who was three months old. I\nhad to go with girl, and I had a horse and buggy, but the copper wheels they had before\nthey were, and it wasn't. I was the owner -- the , not the owner. The owner was Stalin.\nAnd I went there and I took him. There was nobody. \"Where is the manager?\" The\nmanager took also one and he run away. Then I took that horse and buggy, and I went on\nthe way to Moscow, but went until 50 miles I had to turn around and go back. Then I go\nin back, Edna tells me -- my wife tells me, \"I got to have milk for the girl.\" I went out to\nthe farmer house and I talk with the farmer and his wife, see if they can sell me some\nmilk. They sold me some milk. And they said, \"Where are you going?\" I say, \"I am\ngoing to Kaunas.\" \"Don't go,\" they tell me, \"Don't go. They're killing Jews, and they\ngoing to kill you. You stay away from this road.\" The farmer -- I was lucky -- they told\nme. And I told to Edna, I say, \"You know, Edna, we better go with the bad streets,\nsecond way road, not to go with the highway. The highway we'll go, we'll get running in\nwith the people taking to the fortress where they're killing Jews. Isn't that the way -- we\nstart going to the worser place. Not to go for the highway, but to go where the second --\nsecond grade road. And that saved our life. And we came in Slobodka. I see my father\n-- or my grandfather and Edna's father -- Edna's was the second, her mother married\ntwice -- going in front of us. I say -- going face run into us. I say, \"What's the matter?\"\n\"Are you survived? Gosh, you're lucky.\" And I looked at Edna's father. His hair 1s\nwhite. He was a black-headed man, and he looked terrible. I say, \"What's happened?\"\nHe said, \"Don't ask. There is -- they're still laying.\" He said, \"Last night they killed all\nthe Jews. They kill the blacksmith,\" whom I know, \"and the printer,\" whom I know. The\nman from the Zionist organization, they killed him. They killed -- from house to house\nthey been walking and killnow Jews __ the street. Killed close to a hundred people.\nAnd like it was terrible. I went up in the attic and looked a little. All along the killed\npeople laying in the back of the street. And next day they went running, the Lithuanians,\nfrom house to house picking a group of murdered people, and the cemetery wasn't too far,\nand they bury them and in probably grave. And it was terrible. Since then, I decide not\nto go out even for the street, and __\u2014_\u2014sd[. don''t know it's interested. I don't know. It was\nvery -- a very religious man came to me. Before the war was a famous rabbi, Rabbi Itrac\nElholan (ph). They have here a lot of seminars in that man's name. He was a very, very,\nhigh educated, religious man. Called him Itrac Elholan. And his assistant, assistant\nrabbi, the assistant rabbi came to me. I was home, and he tell me I got to help the Jews. I\nsaid, \"I got to help the Jews? What are you talking about?\" He said, \"You got see\nJordan. We got now a Gestapo lieutenant. He's terrible, killing all the people.\" I say,\n\"What you mean? He say, \"He's in charge over the Jews, and it's all give the right to the\nLithuanians, do with the Jews what you want. Kill them. Do them. We want to liquidate\nthe Jews people.\" That's what he say. I say, \"What do you want from me?\" He say,\n\"You had when you were in your younger days,\" he tells me about this story of Esther in\nthe bible. You know, Esther. You know Esther. And Esther also went to Ahasuerus, to\nthe king, and to Babylonians, and asked mercy for the Jews then, and they survived.\nHaman was the murderer, the one to kill all the Jews, but Esther saved their life. And it\nwhat he want now. I got here in ghetto now such a beautiful girl and her husband, and\nshe's willing to go and talk to Jordan he should save the Jews, not to kill the Jews. And\nshe don't care about her life. They can kill her. She's going. \"What you want now?\"\n\"And now I want you\" -- that I should go and talk with Jordan, the German lieutenant that\nwas in charge, and ask him for mercy to help the Jews. Well, I say \"Yeah, but the girl\ndoes it, and let's find out. \"Yeah,\" I say, \"I'll do it.\" I went, and I almost got killed right\nby his door. You see, I open up the door. I went into his office, and he say, \"What you\ndoing? What you want?\" I say, \"I got to speak to you.\" And I tell (ph) him with his title,\nand -- Gestapo title, and he jump to his gun and grabbed the gun and start shoot. And he\nstart shooting. I run, and I took off right behind the building and come back in ghetto. I\nwas lucky that that thing was cold, because in that time I seen -- we had a sexton in by\nthe Gestapo building, what they call it? What it was La Tucas (ph). That is Ukus (ph)\nmeans let the Lithuanian Ukus, th crown department from the Lithuanians. And I come\nrunning, and they -- I see in there, they put in Jews right in that La Tucas gate. There is a\nbig yard surrounded with the wire, barbed wire, and they put that place on fire. And the\nstaysand__ go, and put it by the match and blew up the place. And didn't the people\nto run out to save their life. They didn't let us go, just stay and shooting them. And they\nbeen catching Jews in the street and taking them to jail. They callthe \u2014s ayjail. They\ncall it tomb. They're packed up. The jail full. And here it was for a month in jail. I was\nlucky to get out because I had a pack of cigarettes, but I have to give one cigarette at a\ntime to certain people to see how to move out from the jail. I got out of jail and come\nback home.",
        "A:A month.",
        "A:No, I didn't see them, but I didn't have no choice of -- I trying to go in there when I could. But\nthen it would start I signed up for to work at the airport. I work at the -- I will be\nagreeable to work at the airport, they could let me out from jail. But what's the thing, the\nJewish people that were afraid to go to work. And the airport was the worsest working\nplace where the person can get -- how the ghetto exist? The ghetto been existing from\ncabbage, what the Germans been giving the Jews for working for the airport. The airport\nwas a company, a German company, by the name of Mole (ph), Mole Company. Mole\nCompany to cover the building of fixing up that airport that they should have a place\nwhere to come down with the planes. And they used to have a rough time to get workers.\nJews didn't want to -- want to work. They did not get nothing to eat and didn't get any\nplace to work. They say they're better one to get killed. They don't want to go at airport.\nThat's ___\u2014_\u2014s what the wife tell before. And they decide not to go to work. So Jordan\ncame himself one early morning and start -- and it was the four Jews. They evading the\nplace where not to go to work, and he kill all the four without even asking, nothing. They\ndidn't done a thing. But he want to scare the Jews when they gave the order to go to work\nto airport -- and at airport doesn't mean nothing -- they got to go to work. And then they\nmade no choice, got to go to the airport. Go to the airport to work was no picnic. There\nwas nothing to eat. It's what I say. They used to give us a lunch, cabbage with water.\nOnce a month that's the little slice of meat, but it was horse meat. They used to bring\ndead horses, killing them, and give them to the Jews for meat. It was -- it was a terrible.\nBut you didn't have no choice. I lost two fingers. I've been staying and working -- the\nway they do it to make the airport, to build the airport, they been bringing gravel and put\nitin____ full for the farmer to bring 1n so many buckets of gravel, and put the gravel on\ntop, and putting the 12-feet high -- no, it was 12 -- they had 12-feet high. No, 36. It was\nI say 36 feet tall wooden block, and then on top of the gravel, and it would make a hard\nsurface, a hard bottom that the planes, the German planes, should be able to come. And\nthey stopped up to 15 miles from Moscow. And it was the night when I decide I better go\nto the airport to work. I don't want to go to work no more ___ brigade, we'd be\npackage -- a package house. We'd be with -- all the Jews will be with me, too. And I\ntold Edna and I say, \"Edna, I cannot -- I am going to the airport.\" And her father tells me,\n\"Tam going with you, too,\" and one of her brothers. Three of us, we went to work for the\nairport. And every time in the morning, 7:00 o'clock in the morning, we used to come\ntrucks, loading us up on trucks, and taking it to the airport. And then we doing the\nall-day work until 9:00, 10:00 o'clock at night, because they been pushing hard. They\nneeded the airport it should start function. And that what we been happy. Happy was\nnothing to eat, but better than nothing. Airport was___\u2014\u00ab.~ We had a uncle, a farmer,\nand it was a rich farmer, because he had the cattle and he had the horses. And the farmer,\na neighbor of his, he used to come to him to his mother. Old, old woman. She was in the\n80s. Come in to her and say, \"Youngkalova (ph),\" it was her name, \"how is?\" \"I'm in\ntrouble, sir.\" A woman -- the old woman come and cry and say, \"I need a cow. We don't\nhave any milk to drink. Nothing.\" So gave him a cow. \"Go pick yourself out a cow and\nbe happy.\" Another one used to come around, \"We need a horse. We don't have a horse\nto work. They are filled.\" He'd been helping everyone, and they didn't forgot it. You\nsee, people nowadays ___ think when they head in the right direction, you bring -- you\ncan teach him into be a murderer, and he'll become a murderer. You can also at the same\ntime to teach them to be become a rabbi, and he can be a rabbi. It's like now we have it\nin Israel, Rabin. Yeah, it's -- you can't blame everything on the murderer. The murderer\nbeen brought up maybe the wrong way with the ___\u2014\u2014. And I be saying it all the time.\nIt's wrong, we been going in the wrong direction. Well, well, then got to -- then I am\ngoing and -- decide that to stay at the airport a long time, not so hot. I am -- it's a very\nbad brigade. I'll have to find me another one. In between time, then they, the _,\ndecide I got to goto the Albert \u2014\u2014_\u2014, and ask what I would not succeeded. I wouldn't\nhelp. I would thinking. But Iam thinking. I come in and worked with the farmer. He\ncame in with a wagon of gravel, and I had to unload it. And then the girls used to take\nthem and shovel it with their father, and their father would bring it up. And it used work\nmaybe by 50,000 people -- lots of soldiers and Jews -- and building the airport. Then a\nman comes to the wagon of gravel. I ask him, a Lithuanian, he's a Lithuania farmer,\n\"Where are you from?\" He tells me, \"I'm from. Tsay\" _\u2014_si\u00a3\" The nameis\nfamiliar. I say, \"What you doing?\" And he say, \"I'm a farmer.\" \"What you doing here?\"\nHe said, \"We got a order from Hitler that we got to bring so many wagon of gravel, and\nhe don't care were it be.\" I say, \"75 miles away?\" He said what he cares. It will take him\na month to bring the wagon with gravel, but he going to have 10,000 wagon gravel to\nbuild airport. That's all what he's interested in, that's the way he figure. And I say, \"Why\n--yousay__\u2014_\u2014?\"\": '\"\"Yes.\" Tsay, \"Could it be youare from __\u2014\u2014?\":~*He say, \"Yeah. 75\nmiles from here.\" I said, \"Wait a minute. Maybe you hear from the Jew by the name of\nItska Kolominski (ph).\" He opens up his eyes. \"Yeah,\" and looks around, \"He's a Jew.\"\nI say, \"I know he's a Jew.\" \"Who is he?\" He say, \"He's my neighbor. Itska Kolominski,\nhe never went in the ghetto. He didn't go in.\" I say to him, \"Well, where is he now?\" He\nsay, \"He's in hiding. We hiding him. The farmer's already been hiding him because he\ndone him so good and helped him. They pay him back. And they -- he been in hiding.\"\nAnd I say, \"Can you take a letter to him?\" He say \"Sure.\" And I took a piece of paper, I\nwrite up a letter. I told him that his family already, he don't have nobody left, only me\nand Edna and Jay, because her parents she got into the __, they took away her family.\nSo the rest of the family, they only going to take itto__; therefore, yes.",

        "A:And then I went -- we decide -- yeah, 1n that time decided take these little children, called a\nkinderatzen (ph), and they taken and killed all the little kids. Then I told Edna, I say,\n\"Well, we got to run.\" She say, \"What you mean we got to run?\" \"You lost your family;\nyou have nobody. I got my family, they also. I ask, and we got to do something.\" And\nwe still organizing. I say, \"We got to go fast. We cannot play. We got to move it.

Ina\nmonth, not quite a month, the farmer come back and from her uncle a letter. And he\nwrites he's willing to. He got to save the family. It's all that's left. Let's do something. I\nsay -- \"You come to here, and I'll try to protect you, to help you,\" the farmer said. And\nwe done it, run away from the ghetto.",

That's all I got -- started up with the police, and they say not to go to\nwork. They say it's terrible. And then we got to go in and fight, and start fighting with\nall that mess. Even I have a lot of people who I knew very well, with whom I went to the\nschool together. Here's Golub. You maybe heard. You got it -- you talk yesterday here\nabout a book he wrote about a ghetto, ghetto day by day, and he's become now professor.",

        "A:Right. Well, after the pograms and after the Lithuanians got happy and killed the Jews, they\ndecide, the Germans, to get over, and the Germans start get bringing more to order,\nbecause they find out that way, the way the Lithuanians went, they'll never accomplish\nnothing, and it would be bad for the Jews and bad for the Lithuanians. They got -- they\ngot to get it straight, and it's what they started to straighten them up. And then we\ndecided to run out of ghetto. One night I got Jay ready and talked to Edna, talk to him a\ncouple times. But he was a kid, five years. I got to get him in his mind that he should\nlisten, because we were afraid to take and do something. And the only way we could\ntake him out from the ghetto was to put him in -- in the small ghetto was a place where\nthey run -- people been running out from the small ghetto to the big ghetto. And that's\nthe way they survived, together they run out in the part of Lithuania in the fields, in the\nwoods. Oh, but Hitler decided he got to kill every one, and Himmler gave the victory\norder to get the Jews locked up and get rid of them, to have the Ninth Fortress, and they\ngot to kill them. The first thing they done is get a order that the Jews not allowed to walk\nthe sidewalk. They got to use the gutter. They walk in the gutter. The Jews, the second\ndecree -- Hitler was in Golub's book, I think, saying the same thing. The second degree\nwas when the Jews got to wear the star of David on the front and in the back. Why on\nboth sides when the one side would be enough? They say, no, when they see a Jew they\ngot to kill him. That is a point where they set up the shotgun or the rifle to -- star of\nDavid, to kill him. And a Jew doesn't have the right to have a car. They took away the\ncars from them. A Jew don't have the right to have a secretary, to have an accountant to\nwork for him. Nothing. And it was rough. But -- and the Jew -- and the main thing, they\ngot to go to work at the airport. And we'll pick them up 7:00 o'clock in the mrning every\nday and take them to the airport to work. And it was also the airport there to work. It's\nJordan, he was the one in that time. He was Miller, the head from the Gestapo, he was\nhis assistant. And Avraham Tory worked also with the same Miller.",
        "A: Okay.\nEnd of Tape 1\nTape 2",
        "A:No. You see, when the war -- on a Sunday morning, the Germans were commencing to drop\ntwo bombs: the one on the way to the bridge and another one right close to the ghetto.\nAnd they were what scared the living out of many people. This special bomb must be\nsuch a blast that everybody not run out -- fall out from bed and come running out outside.\nAnd didn't know what to do, had the people like crazy. It maybe was thousand people in\nthe street waiting for a solution. Somebody said \"Help them.\" Even it got so confused is\nwhen the younger couples who was, where they only had to go to the railroad station.\nThe communists kept a train at the train station for almost a full day begging everybody\nto go in the train and go to Moscow. They want to -- they are willing to carry them to\nMoscow, and the train was staying there. And they wait and they didn't go and they\ndidn't use their opportunity and they got killed. You see, other ones went with horse and\nbuggy. Where they got the horse and buggy? They had a cooperative, a cooperative, to\ntell the Russian people. They had to tell what all the private horse and buggy people.\nLike I got uncles, my three uncles, they were owners. The horse and buggy they want\nonly to belong to the cooperative, because they were afraid for the Russians. They say\nwho -- those who work, those who eat. And they were so scared that they don't go get\nany food, that they board a horse and buggy and joined up into the transportation\ncooperation that they should say that they got some work and they been doing work. And\nwork, what they made a living out of it. And how is me by being educated? And I got\nmy two uncles, three uncles, right in the board of that cooperation. Through their\ninfluence, I been accepted on the job to be their bookkeeper. Then I went carrying their\nbooks, and I got calls, people been calling in. They want to bring -- they found each\nother, they want to bring up a safe on first floor, on the second floor, all that kind of\nwork. They used to call mein. I used to give it all to the dispatchers, and they used to do\nthe work. And then it's the way we've been working with the transportation. With me, if\nyou had a place like a stable, a lot stable, which we kept about 30 horses with wagons,\nand people were running to that place there for a horse and the wagon. They go off with\nthe horse and wagon. Was going to Moscow, going to save himself in Moscow. Going\n1800 miles, go over in the horse and wagon. They didn't realize they what foolishness\nthey were trying to do, but when a person is scared and the devil is after him and chasing\nhim, they don't have no choice. They do a lot of things what is not real for a regular\nperson. But they done it. The Germans were on top flying over the heads with the little\nplanes. Lithuania only had two paper cups, I call it, two of them. They didn't have any\nmore. It was a poor nation. That's all they had. They had eggs plenty, chickens, turkey.\nThat kind of items they have: food to eat. And that's what they struggle even right now,\nhere right at the present time, with the sand all what's going on. There the\nLithuanians all struggle to the Russians. Can't help it. They'll have to have a war. I don't\nknow why. I hope not, but what the way it's happened, the way it's going on, it's big\ntroubles. Because the Russian who been born 50 years ago is now a man of 50 years. He\nmay be educated, maybe he's a doctor, a lawyer, and here he cannot practice no more and\nhe's got to move on. And he say, \"What, it's my country.\" He say, \"I was born here.\"\nAnd you see this all coming up. It's all kind of problems is developing. And the\nLithuanians from their side was trying to do the best they can, and they can't do it and it\ndoesn't work. Well, when they got in, the Germans, and the Lithuanians lose, it were the\nLithuanians done the biggest mistake: kill the Jews. It's not kill the Jews; it's destroying\nthe Jewish nation. The Jews done so much good for them. And even right now they been\ngoing and asking in Israel for help, because they got to go to France, they got to go to\nEngland, they got to go the States, seeing that to recognize their independence, to\nrecognize them as a nation. I one time came to the German Council in Richmond, and I\nwas right at a meeting speaking to us, and I ask him a question. I say, \"Would you tell\nme what's happened to Kennicksburg (ph)?\" Kennicksburg is one of the largest cities in\nnorth Germany, and there was a population of around 5 million German, and the\nLithuanians took in maybe 5 million Germans. It wouldn't be a Lithuania. And the\nproblem is -- the United Nations all have problems how to get it straight again. It's\nheadaches -- Europe 1s in problems.",
        "A: Well, then, they came. When the Germans decided to get the force, the labor force, was we\nwere locked up, 17,000 Jews, in Slobodka before the war started with Hitler and Stalin.\nAnd they -- I got to think.",

        "A:Because they -- that rabbi knew me personally from way before the war. He was the President\nSmetona's good friend. And anything -- when he had to write a letter or something or\nsomething to ask the President Smetona for help, he used to come to me and ask me I\nshould write him in the Lithuania language a letter. Or when he used to send a letter to\nRoosevelt right in the States, he used to come also to me and ask me to help him to write\nin English, even when I didn't know the English language. He didn't took \"No\" for an\nanswer. I say, \"Your own sister-in-law works for Shell,\" Shell company, the gasoline. I\nsay, \"Why don't you go to your own sister-in-law? She can help you more in this case\nthan I can.\" But he didn't want to. He want me. And I couldn't help him. To satisfy him\nI say maybe I'll -- maybe he's an ordinary person who got feelings. I'll go. What am I\ngoing to lose? More so than the death, it couldn't be. And I went. And I went to the side\nstreets. I know to the university was right there. Then I used to go every night and knew\nthe places where to go. I went, but I almost got my head cut off.",
        "A:Not, no. I couldn't. Everybody had -- in the ghetto was such a life that everybody got to help\nthemself. You don't help yourself, you lost. And nobody could help you.",

Or earrings, with a\ngolden earing. You see, when also the Germans come out with the decree, they want to\nhave the Jewish people should give all their gold, jewelry, and diamonds, to turn it in into\nthe central committee. And they -- later on they'll have new orders, and when they got\nthat order, and the Jews, not so dumb, were giving away all their valuables for they had it\nfor years. Then some of them -- one was my father-in-law. Took out a brick from the\nwall, and done such a beautiful job that you couldn't tell. He put in his gold _ watch, he\nputting in -- his wife had a chain, a golden chain around her neck that's plain solid gold.\nHe took that and put it all in the hole from the brick, and put it over with tape, taped it up,\nand you couldn't even tell. And it come up after we come after we got liberated, we went\nand got to find the gold pieces right in the wall where he put it in. And then it was --\nwell, this is one item. And then we went and then to go to work at the airport -- no, it\nwas the second time, then the Germans decided they got to have the airport still done,\nwith the company, it was a German company, been building the airport. And everybody\nhad to go to work regardless. It took all the brigades and turn around and send all of\nthem to the airport delivering gravel to help the airport done. And they done it in a hurry,\nin no time, but they work day and night. And one brigade I work at night, I cut my\nfingers off.",
        "A:Okay.",
        "A:No. They -- all of they gave that the Jews had the right they should build theirself a ghetto.\nAnd what they done from the Jewish people theirself, to pick out a large brigade, what\nthey went in in the ghetto with barbed wire in the section with 27,000 Jews lived in it.\nThey surrounded them with barbed wire, and had Jewish police with helpers staying there\nat the gate, where you going in and going out from the ghetto, staying there and helping\nthe Germans who getting already there -- you say to German soldier and just stay the\nJewish with young men, and all day long stand by the gate to help each other how to not\nto run in any troubles. To help there shouldn't be any shooting, shouldn't be any killing.\nAnd then that's the way they stay there and build the ghetto. And not that the ghetto was\nfinished. Was in August\u2019 15, 1941, that's when they got finished, and they started in June\n29th in 1941.",

We had been sleeping four, five people in one room\non the floor, but we didn't want to move away. You stay -- better stay in the one place\nand not to keep moving around. And we -- we been there all the time. Since I got\nmarried, I was in together with them, and we stay all in the same place. And only when\nthey need the help -- they used to come, the Germans, right on the corner where I lived,\ncome with trucks and pick them up and take them to work. And one thing would just\nhappen. When they come with trucks to work, it can -- this idea was from the mayor\nfrom Kovno, from Kaunas, came with a smart idea. He come to Jordan, and told Jordan\nthat he got to do -- to get more people to do work, and the people are not coming.\nSomething, they got to do to keep them moving. And they came in one day and shot four\npeople by the gate by coming in and going out to scare the Jews. And when they all\ncome here, they shouldn't run, they should go to work. And it come -- he come up with\nthe idea that he need 530 -- 500 people he need first. And he got to have young people.\nWhat he need them? He need them for the archives, because of the communists run away\nand left behind him so many papers, so many archives, in the Russian language, and the\nJews knew Russian language perfect, that the Jews should go and help the -- how to take\nout the paper and check them, and then know what's all about them in the paper. And\nwho was idea is? The idea was the mayor from Kaunas; he suggested it. And they took\nfive -- placed the 500 -- 534 people came. And all of the 534 young people -- boyfriends\nof mine, cousins of mine, a lot of people whom I knew, a lot of them I went to school\ntogether. All this appeared at night and everybody was there. They kill them the same\nnight. When they took them out 7:00 o'clock in the morning, by 10:00 o'clock at night\nthey all were dead.",
        "A:That's what I don't know. A power in me told me not to go. I just until this day ask -- rabbis\nask people why I didn't -- I stayed with them. And there was my house. And I told it to\nmy buddy next to me, I say, \"You know, I kind of feel funny. I don't think I'll go.\" He\nsay, \"You're crazy. What you going to do all day long here with the woman. They'll run\nyou nuts. Where my husband, where 1s this and that. Stay here. They don't come in time\nback, it will be murder.\" But, I said, \"Nope. I'm sorry. I'm not going. You want to go\nwith me, let's go.\" \"No,\" he say, \"I'm going,\" and he went with them. And I went back to\nthe office from the committee. What we call them? You know, I went to the central\ncommittee office with Dr. Elkes, the head man was there, and Avraham Tory, his office\nwas there. I went back there and to find out what's going on. I come in there. There is a\ngood friend of mine and a good friend of Edna, worked for his brother. He gives me --\ngrabs me and he want I should go with the 534. And something in me gets me power in\nme, I should get rid of him. I say, \"Now, look Isaaci (ph)\" -- his name was Isaac. I say,\n\"Don't play with me. I come to ask you what's going on with 534? What's happening to\nthe young men? What do you want me to push there? What's the interest you got in\nme?\" He say, \"Look, I don't want nothing. You go with them.\" And it made me hot. I\nhad -- I had to knock him in his nose. I didn't want to do him any harm, but he -- my life\ndepended and he stops me. It was three, four cases like this in the ghetto.",
        "A:He forced me? Nobody forced me, no. No.",
        "A:Uh-huh.",
        "A:No. It was going -- because Hitler or the Gestapo let them until August 15 we got to have a\nghetto created. We got to have also until September\u2019 15 a bridge made, and then they\nwent to -- we went to work. The people who didn't live in the ghetto who went to work\nand helped build the ghetto, because they find out that is safer, because they say they've\nbeen guarded by the German, guarded by the Jews, and we don't have to worry about it so\nmuch at night when you go to sleep that somebody will wake you up and take you out\nand beat you and kill you and all, what they call it, selections. The 534 was a selection.\nThey picked out the young men, and it is the cream of the crop for many reasons. Not\nonly for the paperwork, but they were a power. It was an underground it was in the 534.\nIt what the ghetto needed, and the young people understood it, but they were not ready. It\nwasn't so simple to do. But the main reason was that they should be organized to get\nsomething to fight the German before they go in the ghetto.",
        "A:Right.",
        "A:No. It was like one went to the other neighbor or a friend whom he knew or a friend who\ncame in and swapped the houses, swapped rooms. It been swapping. \"Here you take\nmine in the corners, and I'll take you what you outside out by the field.\" They been\nswapping between theirself, and nobody helped them and nobody bothered them. It was\na big mistake and it was a big mess. Everybody was running, doing anything they can to\nhelp theirself or help the other one. It didn't work. Then they stop it. Started -- and they\nfind out that they don't have enough space. They got to have a bigger, larger ghetto.\nThey had one large ghetto and they had one small ghetto. The small ghetto was 5,000\nJews, and the large ghetto was 27,000 Jews. And to go in the small one, they didn't have\nenough more room, since a lot of Jews were -- because Germany decided to send Jews\nfrom Austria, to send Jews from other countries, to Lithuania, to Kaunas, to the Ninth\nFortress, that killed the Jews, and it was the selection. And they build a bridge from one\nghetto to the other, from the small one to the big one. And in the big one they still have\nroom to put in, but in the small ghetto they didn't have no more. And I -- what they done,\nthey told everybody, all small and big, say, \"Go out in the large field.\" It was where they\nwere building the airport. It's where they have the -- what they call it? Rockstaten (ph),\nthe work places. And they all been sent there. But there they got a select, and the name\n-- a German soldier by the name of Rauca -- Jay got his picture of a writeup with him.\nHe was the head of the selection. And he had the help of the Lithuanians. They helped\nto guard so the Jews shouldn't run. And they was directing the Selection A and B, big\nghetto and small ghetto, who should live and who should die. And then after everybody\ncome around and stay there all morning. I will never forget. From 5:00 o'clock in the\nmorning until 10:00 o'clock at night without food, without water, without nothing. Andit\nwas little children, sick people, unbathed. It was a terrible picture, seeing the way they\nbeen mistreating. Muistreating -- the people wanted they should be shot, but they didn't --\nsurrounded them with machine guns around the all -- around the ghetto, and they kept\nthem all day. And then Rauca come around with a little stick, like you would play music,\nplay an orchestra, directing all what to do, and asked everybody's occupation,\neverybody's name. And then after a while, we seen a German on a motorcycle come\nrunning and told Rauca something. And Rauca gave the order, \"Everybody home. We\ndon't need it. Go home.\" Well, they were trying to, the Germans, to find out how much\ntime and what kind of power it will take to control a situation like this, because they were\nafraid for the balance of the Jews. After all, about 40,000 or even 30,000 Jews, it's a lot\nof people. They cannot take and 40,000 and shoot them out. Somebody will get ahold of\nguns and somebody will get ahold of machine guns, and in worse cases like that it's not\nso shameful. Well, then they send everybody back. And what the religious Jews was\nsay, they were saying, \"Here is a God\" -- I mean \"the hand of God. God saved the Jews.\"\nAnd they all -- they all go and -- and we all Jews start praying, and God is the one. Jews,\nyou listen, and all that. The orthodox, and they were so happy. \"You see, we still have a\nGod. God saved us.\" And I remember it like today they been saying. And they send us\nback home. And this was the small ghetto was liquidated, but they had a bridge made.\nThe bridge to bring in the Jews from the small ghetto to the large ghetto, all the same\ntime from the large one to the small one, and started Selection Number\u20192. The big\nselection, which was October\u201928th, 1941. That's when they had the big selection. And,\nagain, comes the case, I am with all my family, with my family and with Edna's family,\nall together. That the way they had it, in groups. They want, they pick out -- every\ngroups they pick out a head an who is the talker, who can talk with the Germans, but not\neverybody should go come and complain of say this and that. And I was selected by the\nGermans that I should be the speaker for my group. In my group it was around 30 -- 30,\n35 people. And he asked me my occupation. And I -- the power in me tells me I\nshouldn't say a word that Iam a lawyer. I should only mention about my occupation.\nWhat occupation I had when it's all I know 1s, all I learn, it's all my occupation? But the\npower still tells me, don't say a word. And then he start hollering, \"I asked you your\noccupation.\" He hollers a little . Well, power tells me I should say I'm an auto\nmechanic. And I say, \"I am an automobile mechanic.\" And when I say \"automobile\nmechanic,\" he holler, \"Right. All groups go to the right.\" They say this, \"To the right\nshould leave, and the left die.\" And all the left people, the 5,000 that night, been killed,\nevery one of them. My uncles and I have lots family, and everybody been dead, killed.\nThe children, the cousins, raped and all. It was terrible. And that's it.",
        "A:They stayed.",
        "A:Right.",
        "A:Vonugas (ph), a large country field. It was a big farm, a lot of farm, a lot of acres of land, and\nthere they brought us all up. It used to be the horse market and all kind of place, all kind\nof business places.\nQ. How did people get there? Were they told in advance what was happening?",
        "A:They don't care. They say, \"You got to be there\n7:00 o'clock in the morning. How you get there is your headache.\" They say they don't have to\nworry about it.",
        "A:Right.",
        "A:Right. Nobody was staying home as sick. They killed them right in bed. They did stayed\nhome, but they killed them. The Gestapo came in, the Germans in there, and killed them.\nThey also killed some of them they called got to be in . It was like a bath, they take\na bath. And they say, \"Oh, you need a bath. Go in there.\" And they go in there, and\nGestapo kill them. That kind of problems they had. Well, this was the worsest. After\nthis is over, it got a little relaxed after they killed out over half and start all over. And it\nstill stays in front of my eyes. I can see the way they passed. I was right at the corner.\nThey going mostly by alphabet. The letter \"I\" was right in the middle. I could see my --\nthe rabbi from my temple, they bring the president from the temple, a lot of older people\nmostly. They bring older, the old ones, they killed out. The young ones they still kept\nbecause they need them.",
        "A:They going from the big ghetto to the small ghetto. The small ghetto was empty. And there in\nthe small ghetto it was not so easy -- in the beginning not so easy to get in. You had to\nhave _\u2014~s, around number. You weren't no more after death. The selection, after that,\nthey didn't have no more when the person, whether he had Number 10, Number 50,\nNumber 57, Number 80, that kind. And since I register myself as automobile mechanic,\none morning, I assume it was the two days later, a German come running with Number\n570. It was me. He said \"Come report to the gate.\" The Jewish bodies had to deliver\nright away. And they come right away running and told me I got to go to work at the\nairport. Well, they took me. I had to go to work, because I'm a mechanic. Because there\nI came, and they told me what to do. And I was also lucky. It's a luck. I'm standing with\nthe foreman on a truck, it was a German. A German army soldier come into the foreman\nwith a pickup truck. And he say he has trouble. The truck isn't running right. He talks to\nthe German, the foreman, can we help him. The foreman called me up, \"Come here.\nTalk with him and ask him what he wants.\" I go to him, ask what he wants. He tells me\nhe has trouble with his truck, it doesn't run. I've got do something about it. I said, \"Well,\nlet me see.\" He start it up. I didn't hear nothing. I said, \"Tell you what I'll do. I can to\nlay down on the floor and you drive slow and over me, and I'll see what is knocking\nthere.\" I heard a knock. We hear it. He say okay. And he say when will I be able to\nhave ready. I say acouple days. He say, \"Oh, no. Can you do it earlier? I'll give you a\ngood loaf of bread. I mean, you can do it? I have a farm not far from here, and I want to\nrun up to see what's going on home.\" \"I'll do my best,\" I tell him. And Ido. And I lay\ndown, and I seen a big pipe with the universal joint with the drive shaft is loose, and I use\nmy head. I say, \"What I am doing -- I moved it. It wasn't the newer kind of car; it was\nthe old late model Ford. And I took it out with my hand. It was loose. And I go into the\nGerman, and I tell them I need a universal joint, and they bring me the part in stock. And\nhe sa, \"Look, I can't understand. Tell me, how do you took off a drive shaft with -- so\nlong with so little bolts with a big tools. I gave you a screwdriver with a pipe wrench. I\ntold him, I say -- you see, you all the time you got to bein yours. And I told him,\n\"Well, I had it here, it was so loose, the pipe, that I didn't have to have any wrenches.\nWith my fingers I took it off and it got loose,\" and that's what I wanted. \"Oh, I can\nunderstand now.\" He understood. He gave me the parts, and I became the best mechanic\nin the Gestapo.",

        "A:Not.",
        "A:I don't think -- I don't think it was in -- it was rumors was coming around that the Jewish\npolice knew where children hiding places were, and they reported it to the Gestapo, and\n-- because to save their own skin that there, that's all they had. They didn't want to get\ninvolved or something. They just point the place where you can see Jewish kids been\nlaying in hiding and been killed. That's the kind of rumors I had -- I heard, but I don't\nknow. I cannot verify, I can't say nothing because I don't know.",
        "A:Before. The leaders of the council, there wasn't too many. The only one was Tory, and it was\nDr. Elkes, and Tory had a secretary woman. It's all it was. That was the council. And\none was by the door, the Isaac, who didn't let me 1n to ask him find out what's going on.\nAbout five, six people.",
        "A:Yeah, yes.",
        "A:Nothing. They didn't done nothing. They -- they didn't bother the police. The police saying\nat first they had to have a working permit, and to get a working permit was hard. It\nwasn't so easy. They been paying -- buying working permits, because they been told the\nperson with a working permit his life is secured. They don't go do nothing to them; he'll\nsurvive. And they been giving us a working permit Number 537, and 537 is Israel Ipson.\nAnd it was been already 537 in the , in that department. They been making it for --\nin a minute for you. They had the special printing material and they be printing up 537.\nThey made 721 and they made -- and it the way it went. They had it made. And then\neverybody was trying to go to the police because the city police don't bother. They have\nenough troubles the way the average person has it. But nobody can go into the police.\nThey didn't took it. They want me. Why they want me? First thing, I was born there in\nthat place, raised in the place. I knew every little corner, every little hole. They need me,\nbut I say, \"No, huh-uh. You don't go get me. I don't want it. I'd rather go to the airport.\"\nBut then, that's my help me too, by not going into the airport. Some of them say, \"Well,\nwe cannot keep Ipson so long. He been so many years already here. We got to give him\na better job. It's not fair. We got to recruit all the work on his shoulder. We got more\nJews got to go to the airport. We swap it.\" Well, but that when I decided on to my uncle.",
        "A:Sure. Go ahead.",
        "A:A walk inthe _\u2014_\u2014s, no. _I didn't see it happening. It would be very, very rough. And that's\nfunny. The Germans -- at the end of the Germans taking, there was a member by the\nname of Lipzer. Lipzer was a head -- a right man for the Gestapo. It was a Jewish\nperson. I -- he became -- he was a nothing. He was a television salesman before the war.\nI knew him personally very well. And he became a big shot because he wanted -- he\nwant to go -- when someone been locked up by the Gestapo and going to Lipzer, Lipzer\nused to bring him out. How he been doing it, nobody knows. Had he been paid off, I\ndon't know. Used to save you something to the Gestapo, to Miller, for him for his wife a\npresent, and take it out and _ three. But it was the main thing. In my case, I felt a little\nbetter, but I didn't bother with him. I stayed away from him. I didn't want no part. Like\nwhen they put in Edna in jail, and I don't know why she got involved with it with her\nmother. ot in jail my sister, and they put him in jail by the ghetto. It's a time -- and I\nhad arranged to take him out from ghetto to run with him to keep the place where to\nwork, but it didn't worked out. I got another very, very, _\u2014_ terrible what happened.\nThe worsest part of what happened with me in ghetto. I even don't want to talk about it.\nI had a cousin who worked for me. He's a very smooth operator by the gate. He wasn't\nafraid for nothing. He had been supplying to the ghetto population anything they want.\nA young kid. He was around 19 or 18. And he helped me to go to the gate with Jay,\nbecause his house was also by the gate. And he helped me also to get to my farmer\nwhom my uncle sent to pick me up with Edna, because they want to bring me home. And\nI see one day my -- it was a couple months later, my cousin is in my hiding place. He\ncame. How he came, I find out; but where he get the idea, I didn't know. I didn't want to\nhave nothing to do with him. Everything when he done for me, I paid him. I just didn't --\nwasn't in me to have to do it, all this smoke-miray (ph), they call it. But this time he\ncome to me and ask me, \"I need a favor.\" He wants a favor from me. I say, \"What do\nyou want? I paid you for my favor to take me to the gate.\" \"Yeah, you pay me. I don't\nwant that.\" I say, \"When you want somebody\" -- he say he want to bring his brother also\nin my place where I am staying. I'll agree with that provided you can bring my mother\nwith the sister, with the older sister. You can bring them from ghetto to me, I'll do\nanything you want.\" He say \"Okay.\" I say, \"But you remember, you got to bring my\nmother,\" and I repeat him three times. And I say, \"Marches\" -- who is the gentile who\ncome to pick us up. I say, \"Look, Marches, you see he should take my mother and\nsister.\" \"I don't know who they are.\" I say, \"You'll find out.\" He didn't. He come on\nboard his other brother with his wife, bring her to me. And I come to the ghetto and I\nsay, \"Who are -- what you brought them for? Who the woman?\" \"This is my wife,\" he\nsay. \"But who give you the permission to bring them in here? I didn't ask you to come.\"\nIt was the best hiding place. It was mine. Why? It was in a safe. The Gestapo wouldn't\ndream to fnd somebody. A gentile should work so much to bring people out of ghetto,\nbut he done it. Well, I got hot. I said, \"Now, look. I don't want no more part of you. I\ntold you a bunch. I don't want -- I want my family. I didn't have nothing do with\nstrangers. Your wife, fine. I don't have nothing. I'm not married to your wife.\" Didn't\nlisten again. And he come with his less brother and his wife. And something got him\nwhen they came to a little town they had to go through to come to me. It was Zezmer,\nZezmer. And go in three soldiers. And that to them comes a wagon, and the wagon was\nmy aunt -- the boy's mother -- and his wife. Four already been with him; two more came.\nAnd I'm seeing the soldiers, and they were thinking that the soldiers go enough that they\nwant to arrest him. And they start running, about -- my aunt and my cousin, and the\nsoldiers didn't know what's happening. There were a big pile of hay. It was the fall of\nthe year. And they got in the pile of hay, they were hiding in the hay, and the soldiers\nthen come around, took him out of the hay, and shot him. Killed him. Took him not the\nsame day, next day. Mother and son, pardon me. Took him. I can't forget. This is\nalmost a fault of mine, when I would insist -- maybe they would be more easier, but I\ninsist to bring my mother. I wanted _ to have somebody. Many, many nights I don't\nsleep because of that -- because of that.",
        "A:Okay.",
        "A:Okay.",
        "A:Yes. They had another. There was a very interesting things outside of the ghetto inside of the\nghetto. It happened I had to go and bring the beer for the German soldiers, but since my\nfather worked in the brewery, my grandfather worked in the brewery, they had the\nconnections. They knew each other, even in the ghetto. There was the workers who\nworked with my father, came to him and it's what I -- it's terrible. And he had only one\nsuit. He had a suit on himself. One worker from the brewery, a gentile, he want he\nshould come to him and say, \"Braetka (ph)\" -- they call my father his name Braetka --\n\"how's about selling me your suit?\" He say, \"Well, I'll sell you my suit. I'll buy me some\ncheaper suit. I don't need\" -- it was a cloth (ph) suit. \"Okay. What how much you want\nto pay me?\" He say, \"I don't know.\" He say, \"Okay. Tell you what you'll do. I'll buy it\nfor you. I'll give you the suit, and you'll pay me for it.\" \"Okay. What do you want?\" He\nsay, \"I want that loaf of bread with a half a pound butter for the kids.\" \"All right.\" He\ncomes in, he gives him a packet, and he goes away. And what they gave him? A brick.\nA paper wrapped around a piece of brick, and took away the suit. And it was worker\nworked with him all his life. He could fix him, and I told him, I say, \"Don't bother. I'll\nbuy you another suit in ghetto, and don't bother with him. Have nothing do with him.\"\nThat kind of people he been working with.",
        "A:Better -- naturally, it's better in the ghetto providing you have something to support yourself.\nInside of the ghetto was the main thing, the malin (ph) what they call it, the working\ngroups. Vachstaten (ph). The work places. There was around 5,000 Jews working,\nbecause the Germans needed them very bad. They needed them to make loafs and to\nmake ears. And they used to catch -- bring cats and dogs and killing them, and taking the\near covers and making ear covers from their skins. And they were bringing them in the\nplaces where they have been hauling the cats and dogs was in synagogues, bringing them\nfull synagogues dogs and killing them. And there was already sitting sewing machines,\nmaking ear covers for their ears from the dogs. And one day I come to work -- I come to\nwork with my cousin. I was the head of the brigade coming into the airport. A German\ncome to us, and he tell me, he say, \"Look, I want you to take me to the ghetto.\" I say,\n\"What do you mean you want me to take you to the ghetto? I have nothing to do with it.\nLeave me alone. Stay away.\" Next time he say, \"You got to help me. I can't get any\nbeer. I'm short of bottles.\" And the Germans couldn't get any beer when they didn't have\nempty bottles. \"Well, I'll arrange that,\" I said, since I knew the people who knew my\nfather. And I told him, I said, \"I need bottles,\" and they arranged it to give me three, four\ncases empty bottles, but for my boss to have beer ___\u2014_\u2014\u00ab.~ And one day, I seen the\nGestapo man come looking for me. I got scared to death. I say, \"Oh, this 1s the end.\nThis time I no get out.\" And who it was? It's funny. The brewmeister from the brewery\nwho it was before the war, who worked together with my father before the war, and now\nhe became a big Gestapo man. One of the big, big ones. And he was trying to find out\nhis boss. He want to see the Wolf brothers. The Wolf brothers, the six brothers, who\nhelped build the brewery, and Ingleman, they was still -- two were still alive. The rest of\nthem were dead already. And he came to bring a package, the Gestapo man, that I should\ntake over a package to one of his bosses. And he was a philanthropic man, a nice man.\nAnd I took over a package, put it in ghetto, and I save it. And if they going to catch me, I\ntold them I got -- he give me his card. He say, \"Don't worry. When they going to catch\nyou, give them this by the ghetto gate. They're going to let you in. Don't worry. And\nthey'll see in this card and know it was_s\u2014\u00a3\"\". And then Mr.\u2019 Wolf came. He came\nthrough friends of my father. I told him, I say, \"Look, help me. Have your son bring me\na package I got from Wolf, a package for me.\" And I had to deliver packages. The\nGestapo man used to bring packages for the Wolfs until the big selection. That's when\nthey killed him.",
        "A:Yes.",
        "A:You didn't have to put up with guys -- at the gates with the guard, with the police. with\nbutter, with water, you had nothing to do with them. When you worked inside the\nghetto, you go from your ghetto place to your home or from home to the ghetto place.\nAnd for that -- the only thing when you had a sewing machine or another -- toaster,\nhelped to trade it in by the gentiles. Items like that, they used to grab it and give you a\ngood price, and they had money to buy it. I had from one of my competitors when I\nwandered out of one of the buildings it was, a cigarette box mixed from gold. Asked me\nto trade it in for food. It was from Mr.\u2019Frumpkin (ph). And I'll take it. I'll try to do it,\nbut I took it but I wasn't capable to make a deal and I brought it back. He didn't -- if they\nwould have caught, they would have caught me, not him.

        "A:Yes. They right, they live. But I don't know that life 1s worth it so much to do it. Well,\nmostly Edna she was more for that. I didn't go for that. Didn't want to risk her life. I\nhad been looking for her twice. And now when I run away from the ghetto, I run no\nmore from the ghetto, but I had a new working place already. They gave me rifemeister\n(ph).

But it was\nAvraham Tory. You had to have him when you need to get a good job. It was Dr. Geslin\n(ph), you had to have him to get a good job. He was the labor department chief. He\ncouldn't get without him a good job. I couldn't get a good job. I didn't get it. My\nbrother-in-law was a no-good. It was every little thing he wants to be paid with money. I\nwasn't for that.

Well, it's not the\nLithuanians. You didn't know that Professor Belodski (ph) -- you heard of him?\nProfessor Belodski was a professor of the University of Lithuania, a professor for civil\nlaw. Professor Belodski -- Tory worked for him, a secretary. And Professor Belodski\nlost his mind in ghetto, and they put him 1n a little home, locked him up, and left him.\nAnd he looked like a little dog would be locked up. And I pass by and I seen it. I pass by\nin the ghetto in that corner, that moment I was -- it was terrible. And I told Tory. I say,\n\"Couldn't you be -- so big shots, couldn't you help that man?\" He could help. \"Why\ndon't you do? Why haven't you done it?\" He didn't say nothing. When you need him,\nyou need him, and . But he helped some of them, too. Without his help, what\nwould good would he be? But why would he had to protect the Soviets or blue-mortgage\n(ph) or all those people without having benefit of mind to. He had a second wife. His\nfirst wife, he was married to a girl whom he knew a lot of. The boys from high school, in\nthe fraternities, that I was along with them.

And we going halfway, the sister, the bugs, the dogs\nstart barking, carrying on. He says, \"It's no good. The farmer was going with us to the\npeople we were going. He told Edna, \"We'll have to go to the Paskavitz (ph), to the\npeople Paskavitzes.\" And they the only one in this situation they could help -- can help\nus, because the Gestapo wouldn't bother with them because their son-in-law the chief of\npolice of Volitus (ph), a city. A small city, not a big one. And they -- and he's very\ntough, tough chief of police. And then they have to worry when people are find out,\nthey'll go everywhere until his house, until -- to that chief they don't want to start it.\nWell, everyone in this time was not kosher. Everybody will be taking it to the table,\ntaking _, stealing, covering, all kind of mismatch of business was going on. But up\nto the chief of police. And then the farmer told Edna, \"When you can go in in the house\nand tell the old lady who you are, then they'll do it. She'll do for you because of your\nmother.\" And her mother was already dead. Then he told the boys to watch out, not to\ngo home, never go with him. The farmer took him around and let the boys go on around\nbecause it would maybe be caught and can be messed up. He was smart. And then every\n5 -- every 10 minutes, the farmer used to lay down on the ground with the ears, and knew\nthe movement from the Gestapo. The Gestapo was already looking for us. And when\nthey -- they knew exactly where the Gestapo were, because the noise, the walk, when\nthey been walking. It was wintertime and cold, and the snow was ice, and we go with\nboots on ice it's makes a noise which you can hear far away. And every half hour we\nused to lay down. We go into woods, and they say \"Let's go. It's good. The dogs are\nthere,\" and they be giving us the plans on moving with us where the dogs are. The dogs\nwere making the noise because the new strange people came in. They think the strange\npeople they were after them. And it was not one, it was a bunch of police looking,\nbecause I was the dangerous one. Dangerous than the partisans, because partisans was\nliving right there too in those woods, in the woods. It was thick woods and good ___,\nand it what the partisans need. They live in there. And it's the way we moved up to the\nPaskavitzes. Edna knocks in the window, and \"Who's there?\" And Edna say --\nmentioned her mother's name. \"Don't know her.\" The old man comes up to the door,\nopens it a crack, and say, \"Who you?\" And she tells him she is Esther's -- Esther's\ndaughter, and she want to talk with him. \"Esther's daughter? Which Esther are you\ntalking about?\" Say \"Esther from Slobodka, from Lithuania, that is my mother. And I\nam Hikki (ph),\" they call it, yeah, \"I am Hikki's daughter.\" \"Oh, Hikki's daughter.\" They\nknow who it is. They let us in home, she and her husband. Her son, second son died.\nThey had a daughter and a son. The son did not investigated what goes on in the village,\nbecause they knew each other. Every movement. Anything in a little village they knew.\nThen he went out that night to report the mother and father what's happening in the\nvillage. And they come back the next day and reported that the Gestapo was looking for\n-- spent two hours checking, searching around the lake, although they had a round lake,\nand couldn't find them. Couldn't find nobody. And they dissolve it. They decided to\nmove in another time. They didn't _\u2014\u2014_\u2014.~ Two days they come again. And this time,\nthey were very close to us, closer here, but there was not time even to get if you were\nlaying right in the attic, laying the cover it up with all junk, with all hay and all that. But\nwe -- he didn't even let us stay there no more. The farmer's brother-in-law took us\nfrom the attic. Edna and me and Jay, all three, out. He don't want even to have us close\nby. He's afraid that when we get caught, he'll be shot by the Gestapo. And they let out\nrumors more and more they were killing. It was true. They been -- the Germans around\nthere caught a lot of underground people in those woods. And the only thing -- the only\nsalvation people had, the Germans were scared to death for the woods. For woods they\nwere afraid, because they know with the underground is no place to play. They when\nthey do a job, they do it. They blew up five train loads with soldiers right in this section.\nIt was a very worthwhile section for the underground, that even Moscow had been\nsending the partisans by plane in those sections. Well, and when we came to them, we\ncould stay only three weeks and we had to move out again. Had it rough. That moving is\nterrible. Why we had to move? It was right before Christmas, and before Christmas all\nthe families had got together for the holidays, and the people were laying there in a big\nbottom covered up in straw and hay, and we were afraid that the kids, that two small kids\nwere came also, that they'll start getting noisy, and going up inthe ___ in daytime, they\ncan find us. Then Paskefski -- Paskofski, I got ahold of Edna's uncle, and told him, I\nsaid, \"Take us out of there. He's afraid to keep us.\" Because we could been -- all could\nget in dangers. We had to move out again from this place and go looking for another\nplace. The only place we decide -- which I decided with Edna's uncle, it would be --\nthere was Paskavitzes was the first one, but this was Paskofski. This was two separate\nfamilies. Another one, Paskofski. Paskofski was a very, very, very poor farmer, a very\nreligious man. Nice man. And he done it anything for a reason. He didn't took from me\n-- didn't even want to take from me. I offered him money. I had a few gold pieces. I\nsay, \"Take it to him only at least one for memory for me.\" He took one. We used to sit\ndown outside at night. The only conversation with each other. At 1:00 o'clock at night,\nand talking about the things, what's going on, what's happening in the world, with the\nfight, what with all the traveling, with the predicting when can we be liberated. Here we\nalready have the war in Stalingrad. In Stalingrad with the Russians took the overhead,\nand they been already stopped. The German army to go forward and start already\npushing them back. And I tell them the war. When we came then to Paskofski, we were\na little happier. Why poor -- and nobody was looking for a poor farmer. Everybody --\nthe partisans came, they look for a partisan with money. A partisan with good -- buy\nammunition. And where they would find the ammunition? Right by the farmers. The\nfarmers used to sell the ammunition. They used to come in, and -- the partisans, and to\nthe farmers, and have the names and have everything they already knew also their\ninvestigation, through their investigation, what's happening. But Paskofski had two\npotato peats. And a potato -- you know what a potato peat? Ninety percent of the people\ndon't know, never heard of it, they don't know what it is. But a potato peat, there we used\nto lay. I was one cuple days in the barn sleeping there. I wasn't safe. I couldn't sleep. I\nwas scared all the time. Maybe somebody's coming in. And then I mostly staying right\nthere. And then Paskofski also have a German shepherd, a dog, smart like a -- called him\nVilgas (ph). I gave him a name Vilgas. Vilgas means wolf. And I been talking to him\nand eating together from one plate, bring him up and hand the bones, for the farmer had\nbones left over. Why, sometimes I went out with him to get soliciting help, soliciting\nfood from the farmers. I used to go with Edna's uncle. He knew everybody. He knew\nwhere to go in and where to stay away from; which house there was a friend, and if there\nwas an enemy right there; to know where to go, to watch their step and not to go. That's\nwhy we succeed, because Edna's uncle knew everything. Every step we do he say, \"Don't\nworry. Come back.\" We used to come in the morning, he say, \"You go and do your job.\"\nI say, \"What's your job? He say, \"Kill the lice.\" Ihate for-- __ shower for months,\nand they were covered up with all this stuff. But then the only thing early in the morning\na little sign of sun, a few rays came in, we stay in there and clean it up ourself that we\nshould be able to wear another day. And but then -- and the rest of them, the uncle, all\nmy cousins, we were 14 people in the two peats. And how I done the peats, one of them\nwere apart from the other, like from this wall until here, it was a tunnel. A tunnel that\nused to be able to go in and out. To go to the tunnel, you had to -- on your belly,\nparticularly for kids, you had to crawl up to the exit. And it wasn't such a easy job\nbecause we had five, three, five -- six kids, and they been for them it was there to play.\nFor Jay he was at that time five, he would crawl in there and crawl in here, who was\ncrawling faster. But I was scared to death that it could collapse. I didn't have any\nsupport. I put in a few branches, but that's all. And I said the ground could -- the sand\ncould fell and killed the kids. And then I would be in trouble; they would be all over us\ndead. It was rough. And Edna, when you say that Jay listen to me. He had to listen.\nAnd I told them, every one of them, that Iam the boss. That they should know not play\naround, not to run around, because our lives depend on it. Finally the kids, after they\nunderstood I was right, they already been controlling theirself. When somebody been\ntalking a little louder, the other kids would say, \"You shut up. You keep quiet.\" And at\nnight we used to go out and get some bread. And then when in day, in daytime, well, the\nwoman got to go out after all, say person cannot be all the time, we have empty stomach.\nAnd then we had to a fix up for that, too. A big bucket with all that outside and cover it\nup with potatoes, rotten, rotten potatoes. I made it that way that the rotten potatoes was\nhigh, and I'd been pulling with a string to opens it up a little opening, and all the rotten\npotatoes fills up the hole that you couldn't see the entrance And people been coming.\nFirst thing, the dog used to take care of a lot of things. Never did let nobody to come in\nclose by. I've been training him so that I didn't give him the bones unless he go and fix it\nup, get himself a place -- I did a job. I had some fun. And it worked. I've been talking to\nhim like to a person, and he believes me. And I'm staying one evening, and I used to go\nout to fix the peats. It was around 10:00 o'clock at time and all the farmers are asleep,\nand I shouldn't get in any troubles by staying and digging. I wasn't careful enough, and it\ncollapse on me. The sand from the  peats got together in one spot and got wrapped to\nhere in sand. It was terrible. I couldn't move. The first time I understood what it means\nbeing covered up with sand that 1s unable to move away nothing. I was staying in one\nspot. I couldn't even move a hand. Nothing. I couldn't even breathe, getting harder and\nharder to breathe. Vilgas was right with me. And I told Vilgas, \"I'm in troubles. Go and\nbring me Paskofski. Go and bring me Paskofski.\". And I showed him a bone, and it\ncooked. And he come to get for a bone. I took the bone. \"You go and bring him and\nthen I go give it to you.\" I been talking to him like I talk to a person. Anytime after I\nhave a lesson with a dog, the dog takes off. Where he goes, I don't know. I told him, I\nsaid, \"Go to the old man,\" the owner, the farmer. I said, \"Wake him up.\" But he didn't.\nWhat's happened, the farmer had a son, Stasook (ph). His name's Stacese (ph). That's he\nused to go -- every weekend go in the farm places, the music with ghettos, and go in there\nto dance and carry on. And passing by every time, automatically he used to pass by the\npeat. See how the dog didn't bother him. He knew him very well. And the dog seen\nStasook Stacese coming up, and he jumped right on him and start pushing him. His paw\nback, and should go front, and said go to the peat. And Stacese understood something in\ntrouble. \"Who's in trouble? Tell me,\" he asked the dog. And the dog grabbed him from\nhis coat, the coat, the side, and pulled me up to the hole to the peats where I been laying,\nand he dug me out. And I could move. I was a feeling like I got from dead to alive. It\nwas a terrific. And I got out. Then he say, \"Well, they'll make a meal.\" \"Okay. We\nmake a meal. I'll pay for it.\" We got a pig, and we had to smoke some for Jay. He loved\nJay, give him something to eat. And that's the way we got out for a while. Now, the war\ncame to Vilnius, and Vilnius from the place where the army, the Russian army was\naround 75 miles. And a week later, I seen the oldier. The soldier going clear up without\na___, with holes, with all that. And Paskofski tell me, he say, \"It's a Russian solder.\nIt's not a German. A German wouldn't go sloppy the way he's going.\" I say, \"Wait a\nminute.\" I look a minute. I say, \"Yeah, it's a German -- I mean Russian.\" I holler in the\nRussian language to him. He responds and come up to me. I ask him, \"What you doing\nhere? The Germans will kill you.\" \"No, they wouldn't kill me.\" I say \"What do you\nmean?\" He say, \"My army somewhere around here. They full now here around. Don't\nworry. Nothing going to happen to you, too.\" He knew right away. I told him how I got\nup there, and I sounded potato peats and all that stuff. And I say, \"Now I got to find --\ntell me, where is your captain? I want to talk to a captain, to anybody.\" He say, \"Let me\nfirst find him.\" I don't know about the Russian army. They go fight with the Germans\nand they don't know one from each other. But finally they come up, and he was one of\nthe Jewish captain. And I told him who I am, how I come here, and what's is here, and\nwho's Paskofki. And to be sure, he asked me a certain prayer, a Jewish prayer. I said,\nsay, it's a song, it's -- the captain, Russian captain say, \"I repeat it.\" Isay, \"All right. You\nokay. Now I know you're not the enemy. I am not afraid for you. You're not do me any\nharm.\" And he say, \"Where are you going?\" And I tell him I want to go -- the first thing\nto go to the ghetto to see maybe somebody from my family 1s alive.",
        "A:Uh-huh.",
        "A:All right.",
        "A:Okay.",

        "A:Something like that, right.",
        "A:Right.",
        "A:I used to go out with Edna's uncle made arrangements with me. We going out soliciting.\nWhat we've been doing, at night about where I was going through, he knew the way, the\nplace there, the woods, going to farmers whom he knew, he knew very, very well. He\ndidn't have to be afraid for them. He go and knock on their door, on the window. And\nthey'll let him know by that knock that this is Itska, that is the farmer, Edna's uncle, and\nlet us in. And we've been buying from them. He be used to buy mostly a young calf and\nkilled it, cleaned it, and something to eat, smoke some, and use it for food, and that's\nwhat we been eating. Bread, I used to say to the farmer, you know, you've never seen.\nIt's very interesting. Two large racks, one on top of the other, and you carry the wheat\nand make flour out of it. And then we put it right in the oven and make bread. We had\nplenty to eat. It was no problem as long as we could go out and bring in.",
        "A:At night.",
        "A:Yeah, farmer's house.",
        "A:We had -- we had everything. We didn't -- about food was no problem. It was no problem\neven in hiding, because -- but you got to be careful. You couldn't be reckless. I couldn't\nstay there. The farmer was tired also not doing nothing. I was tired not doing nothing.\nThen the farmer, I seen here now the same thing, got two long sticks. And I got one, he\ngot one, and we work hand in hand. It was very, very, interesting, and it's a good\nexercise. He sworn over the coal. I was the one -- and then we cutting the wheat and\nknocking it out and getting out the little -- what they call it in English? What they fill --\nthe cover is filled with it. The wheat is filled. The weights. Well --",
        "A:Yeah, right.",
        "A:Sleep. And Edna and I couldn't do nothing. And it's enough hard work. My uncle will never\nforget. He used to tell me, \"You see, take a look at how bad people we are. The human\nbeing is terrible. You take and you beat up a horse. You don't go fast enough or you\ndon't pull strong enough, and then you get whipped and kicked and all that. Move, move,\nup the hill. We got enough--abig \u2014__ holler at him to get up the hill. We didn't go\nabout it. We didn't -- we complained to the horse and we whip him with the whip. \"And\nnow we are the horses. You are the horse and I am the horse. And now how is it? How\nit feels?\" He asked -- he been asking me how it feel being a horse. I say, \"Yeah, I'll\nnever forget it being that horse.\" Yeah.\nEnd of Tape 3\nTape 4",
        "A:Zezmer. Zezmer. It is a little town. It was one street, people living in one street. And there it\nwas between Vilnius and Kaunas. And there is a lot of woods, and it's the only place we\nhad to pick, because the Germans was afraid for the woods. The woods 1s a trap for\nthem. They were scared to death. When they already were in the woods and you seen a\nGerman group, even a battalion, could be 500, you don't have to worry about it. They\ndon't go fight. They scared. They look for another place for to run. And it's what\nhappened also with them. And we were -- every time we heard -- we heard a shot, we\nwere jumping for joy, because we seen here is Hitler getting beat and here we -- our time\nto be free is so close that you just touch it. And he already seen the Russians plane right\nover our head. You see that Paskofski had a lake, there's a lake on his land. And we\nwent there to swim and to lay in the sun. It was foolish of us, too. We could get shot. A\nGerman plane could seen here we're having a good time laying in the sun, and here we\ngot to still fight a war. It they can shoot us.",
        "A:In hiding. It done like a fool, didn't know what to do. I just was worried. And I told Eeyicka\n(ph), I say, \"Why are you in there?\" He was heading there on teaching the children. You\nsee, he didn't had nothing to do, and the kids he want to get educated. He didn't have any\nbooks. They didn't know the alphabet. Nothing. He only worked from the prayer book\nit's what they had. He teach these boys how to read the alphabet. And what he done,\nthey been sitting under a little hole, and there was a ray to -- a ray from the sun coming\ndown, and it's a wide clear place, and there he was sitting with these two boys, and he\nwas teaching the bible. And I tell him, \"I am going to take a swim.\" He say, \"Don't need\naswim.\" Well, but I done it. I done to the lake. The next day I was smarter. I talk to\nPaskofski, and I told him, \"Would you make me a bath?\" And he done. He laugh a little.\nTsay, _____. -What he done, he took rocks he had, he put the rocks with wood, special\nwood in with the rocks, which red hot from the heat, and there he been__\u2014_annd giving\nme -- we used to say a shoulder, a cold shoulder make warm. And it was just the best,\nbest moment in my life. Many people ask me what I felt and what I want and what I used\nto at that moment. I say the hottest and enjoyable and best thing that happened to me is\ngetting the bath by Paskofski. It give me -- it was terrific. And then one day, I am sitting\nthere. I am walking in my office, and I take a look at farmer's wife crying, carrying on. I\nsay, \"What's the matter, Mrs. Paskofski?\" She say they locked up her husband. I say,\n\"Who locked up?\" She say, \"The Russian commander. They locked him up. They say\nhe don't want to go in the army.\" I say, \"Tell him he's crazy.\" Paskofski was a man\nalready in the 70s, don't want to go in the army. I say, \"Let's go. We'll take him out.\nDon't worry. Don't cry. I'll get him back.\" I took and I had a jeep, put her in the jeep,\nand I went back to the place where we were in hiding. And I got in Zezmer, in one of the\nplaces between Vilnius. And I told them, I say -- I tell them who I am, and I came in here\nto get Paskofski out. I say, \"Why are you taking and arresting a man who is already 70,\ntime already to die, and you lock him up because they find out a hiding place?\" The man\nsay that -- that captain, I don't know what, the major. He say, \"Well, you know what he\ndone?\" I say, \"He didn't done nothing.\" He say, \"What do you mean done nothing? He\ntook a bunch of drunks,\" and he say, \"put them in a hole that they shouldn't go. They had\nto go register for the army. They didn't went to register for the army; they went to drink\nright there in the peats where -- what you build. And the first thing I don't know is you\ndone it.\" I say, \"Why are you doing?\" I say, \"Ask my question. How it looks and what\nyou want to know. I ain't going to let you know from the peat, if the peat is right or is a\nwrong peat.\" Well, and this gave me -- I say, \"All right. Tell me what if -- what is in that\nplace and what is that place.\" I had to make a plan, and hey let him out. And then I got\nPaskofski out. I say, \"Don't go out. I'll take you back.\" And it's 50 miles almost. I took\nhim back. And anyway, I got Paskofski. Now Stasook, his son, he's the one that start the\ntroubles. He told the neighbors that is the refugees running and hiding in here. They\nbeen there and they messed it up and he get blamed. But they took him in the army.",
        "A:Yeah, run across them, but it wasn't much. They -- they -- in that area, they used to come\nregular routine to get food. And they been telling -- find out there's a rich farmer, he got\nlot of meat, a lot of butter and all that stuff, they been asking. They told him they go pay\nwhen you want to go pay, but you got to have food to eat and they got a lot of children,\nand it was a lot of groups, big groups. And then the farmer wasn't so anxious to give, and\nhe told him a couple times, I say, \"They don't want any monkey business. They want\nfood. They're not -- they'll take it alone. When they'll take, they'll take everything that\ngoes.\" And they settled and they gave them food to eat. And it wasn't such terrible. But\nthey were ready to fight with what killed a lot of them. The -- not the Lithuanians -- not\nthe Germans, but the Lithuanians. The Lithuanians say, \"Woods doesn't mean nothing,\nbecause they live in the woods. The Germans didn't go. And the men -- there was five\nexplosions that let the railroad go, breaking the rail and been blown up.",
        "A:Yeah.",
        "A:Yeah, that give me hope. I was encouraged already before, because the shooting was going\naround already so close, but beyond there, what -- what's happened? The Germans had\nthat part of ____\u2014_\u2014s occupied, and they been there having all kind of whiskey. Was a\ndistillery from vodka, and they big drunkards. And when they came to that place, the\nRussians, they start drinking, and been drinking for three days, and got so drunk they\nwere laying like dead. And they didn't know what was going on at that time. The\nGermans come back and they really give them some blows and they lost a lot of soldiers,\nthe Russians. And this messed up -- messed up the ghetto, because they were so close to\nget to Kovno. Everybody was so anxious. And Golub also, Tory, talk with the Miller\nfrom the Gestapo, and beg them and offer them a big amount of money, and told him to\nhelp see that his life will be protected, that nobody will touch them. But Miller didn't go.\nDidn't took it.",
        "A:No, it's most of the hiding period.",
        "A:I didn't have from what to pray. I didn't have no books. I prayed. I did pray.",
        "A:Right. It was a nice, young man. He reminds me of what 1s it? Christ. Tall, nice looking\nyoung man was with me in the working spot right by the place where the German army\nbeen moving out from Lithuania already back to Germany. The army all been pulling. It\nwas a nice size, not too big, but it was a nice size. And they pass by this part where we\nworked with the young man, his name was Settleson (ph), and myself. We were there\naround 30 people. Our work was to rifemeister. Rifemeister. I'd been a place of fixing\nammunition.",
        "A:And we been staying and cleaning them. And he knew the place. And the boy -- and when he\nhad -- made that a place to hide, dugged out the hole and stayed there, and he was already\nlucky. The army had been going passing by, the German army. And the German soldier,\nwho was one of our workers, who worked with us to Gilligan's (ph) place, knew -- got in\nin the place. Maybe want to get a drink of water, maybe was looking for Mendleson. I\ndon't want what it was. But Wilson, the neighbor, told me that. And he shot him in the\nback and killed him the last minute of the liberation. And he was a tall, nice young man.\nAnd no luck, and finished.",
        "A:Uh-huh, the ghetto.",
        "A:No. I went by myself. I didn't need nobody. I ran; I didn't walk. Everybody was too slow for\nme. I was flying.",
        "A:By myself to the ghetto. People saying, \"What's the matter, man? What's you running?\" I\ntold Mr.\u2019 Wilson, it was a man who let me stay in his house, oh, a couple nights before I\ngot settled in Kaunas. But in the meantime, I went -- I went there by myself and I run in\nthe ghetto. I knew I had to see a picture. I see it, and it was terrible stage for my eyes.\nHere 1s laying a hiding place with the man Monkey (ph), Monk's hiding place. The name\n-- they call the nickname Monk. And he had the best possibility to make a hiding place,\nbecause they had a money, they had the material, and he done it. And you couldn't find\nthe place nowhere to search. That's where he was. My mother, she still was in his hole\ntoo, because they told me in ghetto yet that my mother, \"Don't worry about your mother.\nShe got the best place. She got the Monk's Melina,\" they call it. And it was too hard to\nfind it. Nothing. I went brick by brick, piece by piece, looking around inside, in the peat.\nCouldn't find nothing. I had to leave. I had to ask the people, maybe the neighbors,\nmaybe they know. They say, well, they don't know what's happened. Could be it was a\nlot of fire going on. When they used to find out the place that people didn't report to go\nby train back to Germany, they used to put them on fire, burn them up. And here is one.\nAnother one was Vinetrop (ph), was another hiding place. And they say it's only a\nquestion of minutes they'll be liberated. They were all full of hope that they'll be\nreleased, but it didn't work that way. And there was maybe about 10 people, they laying\noutside of the ghetto.

And I'll never forget there were\nabout two gentlemen -- one is a lawyer and one a judge -- to my service station on Kerry\n(ph) Street in Richmond. And talking and arguing in English. And I say -- that the\nlawyer asked the judge about a question he don't know what to answer him. And I told\nhim in Latin the question what he's asking. He look atme. Isay,__, and justice,\npower, government, and all that. And I look around, and the judge took a look at me. He\nsay, \"Look, what you doing here?\" I say, \"I run the station.\" He say, \"Wait a minute.\nYou don't run that station. Come to me tomorrow I'll give you a job.\" The judge told me.\nAnd the lawyer -- Istovatz (ph), and I forgot the lawyer's name. I say, \"No, I can't. I\ndon't go make -- I got to make a living.\" He say, \"I go pay you good.\" I say, \"Still not\nenough. When I would go away to go, I would go into my own trade.\" He say, \"What's\nyour trade?\" I say, \"Law. I would become a lawyer. I would want to do that, but I can't\ndo that here, my handicap.\" \"What do you mean your handicap?\" What I know, I don't\nknow the language. I don't know what to do. I would get lost. Huh-uh. I don't want it.\"\nEnd of Tape 4\nTape 5",
        "A:In what year?",
        "A:It begin as soon as we got in into the ghetto. It was you take a human being and lock him up.\nLock me up, but I wasn't -- wasn't ready to be locked up. I was still in my prime life. I\nwas 39 years of age, and they're going to lock me up. And then the pagrom. What I\ncouldn't take it is the Lithuanians. I had Lithuanians lawyers, friends. They used to --\nlike for Passover, for example. I used to take five, six judges coming with me and we\nhaving the Passover services. I was so close. Stenitis (ph). They hadtoldmetwo___.\nOne was Stenitis, was a good friend of mine, Stenitis. His brother. And say, oh, I\nmingled with them, friendly. I know I'm alive because they -- when the city pagrom was\ngoing out -- going around, they come up to my house and stopped. Why? I am positive\nsure that one of my friends was Hollincare (ph), say, \"You don't go to Ipson. Skip that\nhouse,\" because I have a feeling that they were going next to me. But I still, still here.\nSomebody stopped. Well, that what was a difficult life. And then the nice people, Edna's\nfamily, losing Edna's family in -- in two minutes. And I was hot and angered at the\nJewish police. They didn't have to be involved in that kind of thing. I lost twice people\nbecause of big shots. I could be a police any time. They all life is what's difficult. It was\nnot what's not difficult. And like with here, a life not concern it does. When I came in\nthis country, I went to work for Edna's uncle, who was an uncle the Pepsi-Cola owner\nfrom Pepsi-Cola in Munich -- in Richmond. And I worked hard for her uncle. I wouldn't\neven let me smoke a cigarette. One day he comes in and he stop where I stay at night and\nworking, and he tells me, I say, \"Well, what you going to do next?\" I say, \"I don't know\nyet.\" Isay, \"Well, I got a job for you,\" her uncle tells me. I say, \"What is it?\" I say, \"To\nrun my bottle machines. I have troubles with the machines, and the mechanic there is a\ndrunk. Every day he's drunk, and I'm in troubles. I got to have my equipment working. I\ncan't make any money. I can't make a living the machines staying still.\" I say, \"What\nyou want from me?\" \"I want to give you a better job you got.\" The job I'm talking, 1947,\nhe been paying me $65 a week. I say, \"Well, I'm not interested in doing nothing.\" He\nsay, \"I give you $100 week.\" I say, \"Give me $100 a week? What I going to do with\n$100?\" Well, \"Tell me why you won't. What is your reason,\" he say, \"when you were\nable to do yourself better.\" He was a smart man, the old man. I asked him the queston. I\ntold him, I say, \"Look, America is a country of wheels. Everything goes on wheels. You\ngo stay and look. Go take a look, how many wheels pass by in the minutes we're\nstanding and talking to each other. Everything goes on wheels, and I want to roll with\nthem. I don't want you to stop me from rolling. I -- what good is for me your job? I'm\nnot too much interested.\" And here I tell you another mistake you made. You know, you\ngot to be -- in life you got to be careful. Here comes Serret (ph). Serret -- you remember\nSerret? Serret was the foreign minister from Israel who was before in Benger Young's\ntimes. And he deliver a speech in Richmond. I was at his speech making. After he\nfinish speaking, I come with the uncle and I introduce him in Hebrew, introduce him\nSerret. And he tells to Serret, \"You know, I want to build a plant of Pepsi-Cola in Israel.\nCan I do it?\" I say, \"Sure, you can do it. No question about it. But it will be certain\nrequirement. You know, one thing that -- Israel got enough grapes, got enough food, and\nthey can make the syrup, they make from all that stuff from our ingredients.\" He say,\n\"Well, but you know, I want to build for my grandchildren,\" Edna's uncle tells Serret. I\nsay, \"Well,\" he say, \"I build for them a future.\" Then it made me hot. I say, \"You want\nme,\" I say, \"go to Israel, vote for you to secure the life for your grandchildren, and my\ngrandchildren shall work for you? No, I'm not going. I don't want that.\"",
        "A:Made you strong?",
        "A:Right. Right.",
        "A: Without my education, I wouldn't be able to accomplish nothing. Everything education helped\nme. It was not hard for me. When I took the job, I knew the language. I knew the\nhistory of the people. I knew what to say and what to do. And -- what I should say\n\"Yes\" and not say \"No.\" The only trouble I -- remained after the war me and Edna, but\nno more closer people. We couldn't help it. Only want to have a little happiness. More\nhappiness here right now. I got a good business. Everything all right, but still not\nfulfilled.",
        "A:Huh-uh. Still not fulfilled.",
        "A:They knew.",
        "A:Yes. I talked, and they didn't like to hear it, to be honest with you. They didn't -- back ;\nI think we are talking. A lot of them they think that I telling a lie, that I am not telling the\ntruth, because they figure that a person couldn't survive, couldn't go through life with that\nkind of a problems all day after day. And they didn't want to listen. They didn't want to\nlisten. They didn't want me to speak no more. And not only me, all the survivors. Don't\ntalk. It was a rough time until lately, yeah, the museum helps a little. But until the\nmuseum come, they don't want -- nobody want to listen. I say, \"The American people\ndon't listen to us anyhow. They're used to talking. They are used to doing. It's a waste\nof time.\"",
        "A:I did. Right now a lot of thing here. When I came in this country , | gota\nbrother-in-law here living with me this month, Edna's sister's husband. And I told him,\n\"Milton, you know, let's go make -- I got a good business for us both together. Let's go in\npartners. I got two businesses. One business,\" I say, \"you can pick auto parts. Open up a\nbusiness auto parts. You be the salesman. I'll tell you what to sell, you go and sell it,\nonly sell it. Or a paper clip factory. Why? Why a paper clip? A paper clip factory, you\ncan run it by yourself. You don't need any help. The machinery runs it, and you make a\nliving. Only thing you need is to go on out and sell it, to go to the wholesaler -- paper\nwholesaler and sell it.\". And I say, \"You would be perfect for me, because you know the\nlanguage, and you just got back from the army, and you the right man.\" \"No,\" he say,\n\"take it easy. I don't want that kind of business. I don't want it.\" He is nothing, have\nnothing. He's a big nothing. What I beg him to be a member -- a partner with me, and I\nhave anything I want. I got an apartment. I say I can get him $200,000 and from\nfingers. I got a machine shop. I got one piece of machinery just $250, the cranks and\ngrinder. I have the best machinists in Richmond working for me. Well, and now with\nJay in the business, and Jay already working on his little one, he should be -- yeah. And\nfirst thing he comes in he runs into the computer and types.",
        "A:I tell you, I know -- I'm sure I had to do it. I'm sure I done it. While in my business I felt out\nthat you cannot leave it out a community. You got to be a community person. You got\nto see to help, to be active _\u2014_\u2014si, to be active. And Iam. I got more awards -- I say, so\nmany sticker. But I got a Distinguished Community Service Award. I got a Christian\nJews Conference. I got a Naborite Service Award. I got a Naborite top lot president -- I\ngot plenty. And it's not because I got pushing it out. No, the way it comes itself. I feel\nbecause I went through life so different variations, movements, that now everybody --\neverybody. I say everybody. A lot of people come to me ask advices. Why do they ask\nfor advices? For my experience. I went through hell. I give my advice. I say, \"What's\nthe matter? You going to tell me I don't know what I'm talking about or you don't know\nwhat you talking about? You don't know what you want. You know what you want. But\nyou got to make up my mind.\" People want to go and want to have it done for nothing.\nYou can't get nothing for nothing. Well --",
        "A:Right. Didn't I mention to you? Funny how we talk sometimes. I can't remember with whom\nI spoke.",
        "A:That now the government repeat, it repeats itself. Particularly Europe. They -- the Balkans,\nwhat's going on in the Balkans is terrible. And who go have the -- we go expect a war\nwith the Lithuanians and Poles. I don't know. I have a feeling like that, because they\ngoing the same way as they went in 1947, '48.",
        "A:That frightens me. Who wants to have it? We had enough. We don't need any wars no more.\nAnd the way it's going now, you never know what's going to happen. They still cannot\nsettle between theirselves the arguments. The politicians, they are a bunch of no-goods.",
        "A:Yeah, there was a easier life. Now we going -- we going over a new period of life which we\ncan't compare. Now the computer price -- the computer life, I mean. The computer life,\nit's anew way of life, and it is changed the human being. In the next 10 years, we don't\ngo recognize ourself.\nWhat I'm trying to ask you is, if in just the daily life today there are certain things, certain\nsounds, certain things you see or think about, that all of a sudden make you remember something\n50 years ago and are very disturbing that bring it back to you?",
        "A:The street life. It 1s terrible. The murders, murdering, suing each other, children problems.\nThe cancer problems, cancer sickness. They would kill this cancer when they would put\ntheir mind 1n it. I don't believe it, it's not that 1t couldn't be conquered. But every other\nthing, all kind of items, and the making the life miserable for their own self in\nplace of making it beautiful, beautiful life. But they don't straighten out, it will be rough,\nbecause I can see a lot of -- a lot of fights here going on. And, well --",
        "A:What people should learn from this?",
        "A:They should learn a new life, because a life is now come to a dead point. And mostly land 1s\ncontrols the people's life. Land and girls, and all the fights with one with each other,\nkilling each other. Here it's not as bad as in little Richmond. It 1s a village. It's not a\nnight for two, three killings. Blacks, whites. Mostly blacks. Whites is not so bad. But\nstill a human being, I don't care who it is. And something life itself, when itself without\nhelp and change. Life need help. It needs to get out from their assistance. We need to\nhelp the economy got to have a boost. And, well, too much inner fighting between one\nand the other. Very, very hard. They still talking?",
        "A:No. No. I don't care about religion. Religion brings no -- we got to be mixed in between one\nand another. It's rough. And it started in Iran. It were the biggest problems. And then\nthere's Lebanon -- the Middle East, another war should come up.",
        "A:Yes.",
        "A:Right. Because -- well, it 1s religion like here. Listen two weeks ago was a rabbi in\nRichmond. He been talking. And he say the only thing what he wants is to conservative,\nconservative Jew. And he say there, what we got to do every day, we got to put on\nchilum (ph). You know what chilum is? You know up around there. And we got to see\nto help and to do and to pray. And it wouldn't give me nothing. All this, what's we get\nfor the human being. Right now we still don't see nothing. We say -- I didn't see yet\nafter 50 years to get rid of Hitler would start coming back, everything. Here I've been\ntalking 50 years ago to the same farmer, Paskofski, living outside and talking to Mr.\nPaskofski, \"What do you think about life?\" That's what we be talking. I'd be asking him\nright there by the door from the Holocaust. And he say, \"You know, you so right. You\nso right.\" That I say, \"Let's -- I can tell you one thing. We still going to have a beautiful\nlife in front of us. I don't see it yet.\" Italkto_\u2014\u2014\u2014. TIknow him. He came to\nRichmond, and I talked with him. I say, \"Tell me something. I cannot understand how\ncome until this day nothing didn't been done about the Holocaust.\" He say, \"Such a\ntragedy happen to the Jewish people, what have you done about it? You should know\nwhat to talk. It's you should know how to answer the questions. Where are you? What\nyou doing? You're telling me__,\" it's a little story where they mean nothing. He\nsay, \"Let me tell you something. History is not written in a day. History doesn't been\nwritten ina month. History takes years to write. The Holocaust will take 50 years before\nthe historian will start doing anything.\" Right. Smart. I say, \"You right. I agree with\nyou on that.\" But don't wait until 200 years; 50 years is enough. We lived the 50 years,\nand now give us what we need. Give us peace. It's enough. I was with him for a good\nwhile. He's a smart man. Some of them didn't like him, but I liked him. He is one of the\nprophets. Very interesting.",
        "A:I don't know. The main thing what I want to say was to get ready of thought of Holocaust.\nWe should never -- not have any Holocaust problems. We should be out of the books.\nWe should get ready world, all the dopes (ph) and all the sicknesses and all the killings.\nIt's unbelievable to be seen a person today, a young person start dying because of nothing\nbeen done about it. A week ago a man, a good friend of ours, he's only 56 years of age.\nCancer. All why? Well, his time comes, he got to go, they say. That is their answer.\nThat's not the answer. The answer is we're not doing enough. I remember when my\ngrandfather died at what, 56. He was already old man. He died, and he was 56 years of\nage, but he can still live another 30. Well, well, sometimes you done a lot of wrong\nthings to yourself. You can be smart enough. You need help and other people too to\nadvise you. Life is not a life of one man. We have certain people think they are. Get\nalong, they're not.",
