So I took that letter and I ask\nwhere the Dr. Bloomberg lives and they told me and the\nwhite uh what was it called? I forgot what it was\ncalled. And this and the white blocks, so I went there\nand I knocked at the door and my husband opened--my\nhusband-to-be opened the door and I had known him from\nbefore from Pointavesh where we came out of Maimal when\nwe went to Pointavesh. So I said I have a letter for\nDr. Bloomberg. He said, 'Yes, come in that's my broth-\ner in law.' So I right away knew that it was not that\nsame Dr. Bloomberg what I thought he was but anyhow I\ndelivered that letter and that's how--first a friend-\nship and then later (laughing) the courtship started\nand we got married in 2 weeks. But after the war, when\nwe were liberated by the Russians in January of '45 and\nthe war was still going on, so we figured that we--so\nthen we were from the whole camp, when were about 700\nwomen. About 20 were sent to a hospital and I was\namong the 20. So after that when we stayed there and I\nmean the Russians themselves--they didn't have any food\nand they didn't have any food for us. So we were\nlingering around and then they said that they sent us\nback to Lithuania. So and we ourselves wanted to go\nbecause that's where we came from and we wanted to go\nback there.

So on one--in\none town we stayed on the railroad and a few people in\nPolish uniforms came by and they were talking and at\nthat time, uh Poland was still very antisemitic and\nthey were talking a little Polish and they\nasked us, \u2018Are you from Metchstek Aumha?' And Metch-\nsteka in Poland means a town and Aumha is the Hebrew",

So we knew they were Jews\nso we knodded our heads so they said we should come\ndown and then when we came down, the started to talk to\nus in Jewish and they said, 'What are you doing,' 'Who\nare you?' and uh. So we said we are uh refugees, we\nSurvived the camps and now we want to go back to Lith-\nuania. So the guys said, 'Do you know if somebody is\nalive from your family.

Stay in Poland and if you hear\nthat somebody of the family is there, they always let\nyou in, the Russians.' So we took their advice and we\nwent to a bigger town to Lebline and stayed there and\nat that time also, we didn't have anything to eat and\nstill wore our clothes from the camps because we didn't\nhave anything.

Because they were all in Dakaw and\nthey were liberated by the Americans. So what--can\nimagine that we were very happy. And for the other\nwomen, they also said that her husband is alive and for\nthe next one, they said her husband was killed but eh\nthe brother in law was alive. So we decided we go to\nGermany already and that is a story by itself. So also\nat that time, you couldn't go uh so we use to live in\nthe train station and whenever we saw a um--a train, we\nwent on it and one town we met up with 2 German men. I\nmean they were Jewish. So we use to sit and talk and\nwe use to converse in German.
