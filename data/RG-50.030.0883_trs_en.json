        "A: At \u2014 at one point, we decided to visit them, but I was reluctant to go at first, but\nwe did go. And they took us all over, showing us places. At one point they asked\nwhether I wanted to go back to Rohrbach, and I said no. Until just the day before\nwe were to come back to the States. It was too late. But, at a later time, maybe a\nyear or so later, my younger daughter and her husband visited the elder daughter\nJune 8, 2016\nand her husband. And I described the house that we had lived in, and they decided\nto go.",

        "A: And they found it.",
        "Q: Did they?",

And a woman who \u2014 came out, and wanted to\nknow what they were doing there. And she explained that this the house their father\nand family had lived in. And she said, I often wondered what happened to those\nboys. My folks told us about it. She invited them into the house and served them\ntea, coffee, refreshments, and they looked throughout the house. The house itself\nwas very unusual, because my father had it built.",

        "A: I been trying to find that house on the internet, I\u2019ve not been successful. But I\nunderstand that the synagogue has changed hands several times. And I think at one\ntime it was a bakery, and a grocery. I have no idea what it is now.",
        "Q: So the building remained, but it no longer was a place of worship.",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Okay. What is the address of the house that your father built?",
        "A: That\u2019s what I\u2019ve been trying to determine. As close as I can come to it, it\u2019s at the\ncorner of Herm(ph) gassen and Bunder(ph) gassen.",

        "A: Yes.",

        "A: That I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: You don\u2019t know. In your mind\u2019s eye, can you paint a picture for me of what did\nthe house look like? Was it two story, one story?",
        "A: I'd say, I think three story.",
        "Q: Okay.\nJune 8, 2016",
        "A: It was a very big house, on a very large lot. There was a side yard, there was a\nbackyard, which was a garden. And \u2014",

        "A: Yeah, brick building, yes.",

        "A: And the family had a farm \u2014 let\u2019s say a garden, full of planted vegetables and\nsuch.",
        "Q: When you say you had running water, does that also mean you had a bathroom\nwith a bathtub in it?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And did you have electricity?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And how did you heat the home\u2019?",
        "A: I don\u2019t recall.",
        "Q: What \u2014 do you think it might have been coal?",
        "A: It could have been.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJune 8, 2016",
        "Q: Would you have coal ovens? You know there\u2019s these very sometimes, ornate and\nglazed type of tile. Does that ring a bell in your memory?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: No. As I say, I was very young.",
        "Q: Okay. And was it the nicest looking house in Rohrbach by Bietingen?",
        "A: I think I\u2019m prejudiced. I really don\u2019t know whether the \u2014 probably \u2014 it was\nprobably the most modern house, at the time.",
        "Q: Does that mean that your father was well-to-do?",
        "A: I wouldn\u2019t say that he was rich by any means, but the family was confortable.",
        "Q: Okay. Did you have an automobile?",
        "A: No, no. That\u2019s interesting. The first automobile that I saw, was when a cousin,\nwho had just gotten married, she and her husband drove into the village on their\nhoneymoon. And I remember vaguely, a night trip we took to visit an au \u2014 an au \u2014\naunt in, oh, in bent \u2014 Bensheim.",
        "Q: Bensheim, mm-hm.",

        "A: Very unusual.",
        "Q: Okay. So what was the mode of transportation for most people, aside from their\nfeet?",
        "A: I\u2019d say probably horse cart, that type.",
        "Q: Okay. Was there a railway station?",
        "A: Not that I know of, no, but the \u2014",
        "Q: And was the travel between towns in, let\u2019s say, to Frankfurt, which is a large\ncity, were there buses?",
        "A: No. In fact, one of the things I read 1s that if youngsters wanted to go beyond an\neighth grade, which was the only education in Rohrbach, a one school \u2014 one room\nschoolhouse \u2014 but if they wanted to go beyond eighth grade, they had to go to\nBietingen, and the only way they could go is to walk, bicycle, horseback \u2014",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: \u2014 or a cart.",
        "Q: Okay. So, it was \u2014 it was isolated, in some ways?\nJune 8, 2016",
        "A: Yes. They estimated the \u2014 I say, the information I have gotten from the internet\nis that it was about a one hour walk \u2014",
        "Q: The eight kilometers, yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 to \u2014 to Bietingen.",
        "Q: Yeah. Was it an agricultural community, in general?",
        "A: I would say yes.",
        "Q: Okay. And tell me a little bit about your parents\u2019 personalities, as you remember\nthem, being a small child.",
        "A: Well, we saw very little of my father, for the most part, because he did a lot of\ntraveling. His main job is to buy cattle for the butcher shop, and he would have to\ngo from village to village, and to market to market to buy the cattle.",
        "Q: So, a horse and cart.",
        "A: Yeah.",

        "Q: Okay.June 8, 2016",

        "Q: Okay. Did they have any other employees?",
        "A: Not that I know of.",

        "Q: And he had one older brother. Did he have any other siblings?",
        "A: Yes, he did, but I don\u2019t know where they were. I \u2014 I know there was a brother by\nthe name of Joseph \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: \u2014 who also emigrated.",
        "Q: Okay. And did you know your grandparents?",
        "A: Just vaguely.",
        "Q: Okay.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJune 8, 2016",
        "A: I remember \u2014 I don\u2019t remember my grandfather, but I have a sl \u2014 slight memory\nof my grandmother, because she lived with the aunt that we visited at Bensheim.",
        "Q: I see. I see. And did your mother have relatives that were nearby, that you knew\u2019?",
        "A: Well, it\u2019s a strange family mixture.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: So it\u2019s hard to say ye \u2014 for me to say yes or no, because we \u2014 the Morgenstern\nbranch of the family intermarried with the Stern family.",
        "Q: So this was not the only Morgenstern-Stern marriage?",
        "A: Oh no, no. William Morgenstern, who was responsible for bringing us to\nAmerica, was originally married to Elsie Stern, who was the sister of my father.",
        "Q: So, he had a sister, too.",
        "A: Yeah. Now, she died at a young age, and then Bill remarried. So, there\u2019s that one\nconnection. Trying to think of the other connections, cause it gets confusing. When\nSiegfried married Bill\u2019s sister, Reshe(ph), Rachel \u2014",
        "Q: So that\u2019s your father.",
        "A: My father.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Married the Morgenstern \u2014 Reshe(ph) Morgenstern. So that is \u2014",
        "Q: Another connection.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJune 8, 2016",
        "A: \u2014 another connection. We can go even further, the \u2014 there\u2019s another inter-\nmarriage with the Moritz family. Another family that was brought over to the\nStates.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: It just goes on and on, and \u2014",
        "Q: Are they all from about the same place, the same area in Germany?",
        "A: I\u2019m not sure.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: But they have to be nearby, because travel was a bit difficult.",
        "Q: And, aside from William Morgenstern and Elsie, where there others who had\ncome to the United States before?",
        "A: Yes. Bill ha-had a brother, Saul Morgenstern, and at one point William \u2014 Bill\nand Saul were prospecting in the west.",
        "Q: In the 19\" century?",
        "A: Yes. Apparently they came over as young men. Don\u2019t ask me when, but they\nwere young. Eventually William moved to Newport News, Virginia. Saul stayed\nout west, in Texas, and he opened several businesses, but he ended up in Borger,\nTexas, running a clothing store.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJune 8, 2016",
        "Q: Okay. And back in Germany, the Morgenstern family, was it also involved in\nbusinesses, as far as you know\u2019?",
        "A: I\u2014I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: You don\u2019t know.",
        "A: A lot of history, unfortunately, has disappeared because our parents never tu \u2014\ndiscussed things like that.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: They really didn\u2019t tell us about the family, and what we have been able to gather\nis memories from different members of the family. And it\u2019s all hearsay, actually.",
        "Q: I understand. Sometimes that hearsay is unbelievably accurate, and sometimes\nit\u2019s not, but you need more verification to determine whether it is, you know. And\nthat\u2019s sometimes not so easy to come by.",
        "A: Right. And that\u2019s one reason I\u2019ve been going on the internet, getting information.\nIn fact, I utilized the local Mormon church to get on the internet. And I was able to\nretrieve the manifest of the ship that we came over on.",
        "Q: And what was that man \u2014 ma \u2014 ship name?",
        "A: The SS Manhattan.",
        "Q: Okay. We\u2019ll come to that part.",
        "A: Okay.\nJune 8, 2016",
        "Q: But, by asking you questions about your larger family, I have many purposes in\nmind. I guess the primary purpose is, still through the eyes of a young child, to kind\nof get a\u2014a sense and a picture of what \u2014 how large was your world, and how many\npeople populated it, you know.",
        "A: Very small, but \u2014",
        "Q: And so, you don\u2019t have a memory of aunts and uncles coming through, and \u2014\nand sort of being there for family celebrations, or things like that?",
        "A: No. The only memory like that 1s s-say when a cousin, cousin Ruth \u2014",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: \u2014 and her husband drove into town on their honeymoon.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: The only other thing is the time, once or twice, that we visited my aunt in\nBensheim, cause I have a memory of that. We used to tease our cousin, cousin\nRuth.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: They had a piano, and they had a stool, which rotated. And both Walter and I\nused to irritate cousin Ruth by sitting on that stool, and just turning and turning.",
        "Q: Well, that\u2019s fun.",
        "A: It was fun for us \u2014\nJune 8, 2016",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 but not for her. That\u2019s one memory I have.",
        "Q: Okay. So cousin Ruth sounds like she was rather comfortable, too.",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "Q: If you have a piano, and you have a car \u2014",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "Q: Do you know how that came about?",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t.",
        "Q: Okay. Do you have any picture of Bensheim in your mind?",
        "A: No.",

And that\u2019s the \u2014 the first thing you want to do\nis \u2014 1s safeguard them from that.",

        "A: No, I don\u2019t.",
        "Q: Okay. Do you remember the boat?",
        "A: I remember a little bit about it.\nJune 8, 2016",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: The \u2014 the only incident I recall is, apparently I had something like a penny, ein\npfennig.",

        "A: No.",
        "Q: When you were told to leave school, by that German teacher, how did that affect\nyou?",
        "A: I was just bewildered. I didn\u2019t know what to think, or what to do. This was an\nauth \u2014 authority figure, says go, don\u2019t come back. What does a six and a half year\nold boy do to that?",

And he used to sit out on his back lawn, looking at the\nsunset, as it disappeared \u2014 the sun disappeared over the James river bridge, and so\non. He died, I think, in \u201956, or \u201957.

If you go beyond that \u2014 if you take a right\nturn at the corner, there was a bakery, a community bake-house, where all the\nwomen gathered, to bake the bread for the week. And beyond that is where\nLudwig, the brother, had his home. That was the family estate, where the butcher\nshop was [indecipherable]",

        "A: Yeah. That was the idea.",

        "A: Right. Well, late \u00b035, cause we emigrated in February of 1936.",

        "A: Yeah.\nJune 8, 2016",
        "A: That was the norm at that time. And Walter became editor of the school paper.\nHe won a prize, I forget whether it was the American Legion, or the VFW, city-\nwide contest, essay contest. And he graduated with honors from high school. I took\na different tack in high school. I joined too many organizations. Now, I can realize\nthat. Glee club, chorus, newspaper, athletics, those things. I graduated with honors.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: I joined too many organizations, I spread myself out too thin. Couldn\u2019t\nconcentrate on anything.",
        "A: Yeah, oh yeah.",
        "A: So, school went well. He \u2014",
        "A: He is a graduate of William and Mary. I\u2019m a graduate of Washington and Lee,\nso I guess we did well.",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "A: They were concerned, especially about the family.",
        "A: Excuse me.",
        "A: I have what I call a running nose, an Olympic nose.",
        "A: The only one that was left in Germany was Mother\u2019s sister, Rosa, and her\nhusband, and their mother.",
        "A: Yes. They had a chance to leave Germany, but they refused, because the\ngrandmother had diabetes, and she could not enter the United States. So they\nstayed, to take care of her.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: The grandmother died, cause she couldn\u2019t get insulin.",
        "A: And Rosa and Ferdinand disappeared. It\u2019s interesting that their son, who was\nalso brought over, Max, Max Loeb(ph), or Lieb(ph), served in the army, and he\nwas in intelligence.",
        "A: And when the war ended, he stayed over, and he looked for his fa \u2014 parents.\nCouldn\u2019t find them.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Well, I\u2019ve mentioned Ludwig, Emma, and Ruth, cousins.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: And there was Ruth and Eddie Sherch(ph) \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 cousins. And their daughter, Elayne(ph), who eventually settled in\nProvidence, Rhode Island.\nJune 8, 2016",
        "A: Well, they started \u2014",
        "A: There was Paul Morgenstern, Bill\u2019s brother, and he set them up in a similar\nbusiness, in neighboring Hilton Village.",
        "A: Yes. Just three, four miles from Newport News, down the road, on route 60. He\ndidn\u2019t like it, so he and his wife and daughter Edith, they moved to \u2014 I think it was\nBrooklyn.",
        "A: And he got a job in a silversmith company, I can\u2019t think, it was Gorham(ph), or\nsomebody up here. And he became quite well-to-do. There was a Max Loeb(ph), as\nI mentioned. There was Ludwig Moritz(ph), who had married a Stern sister, and\ntheir daughters, Margo(ph) and Beatrice. There was my father\u2019s brother Joseph,\nand his wife Tilly(ph), and Joe \u2014 Joseph, who I remember, whenever you met him,\nas a kid, he always reached in his pocket and brought out a piece of candy he\noffered you. He opened up a small hardware business in Newport News.\nJune 8, 2016",
        "A: I understand that he discussed law with a friend who was a lawyer, and he\nbecame quite adept at th \u2014 not \u2014 not that he practiced it \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 but he was quite familiar with the laws.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Not that I know of as, you know, handing him money, no. Not that I\u2019m \u2014",
        "A: I\u2019m sure \u2014 I\u2019m sure there were people that did, not that I can tell you who they\nwere, or anything like that.",
        "A: I mean, he was quite influential in the congregation.",
        "A: A decent size community. At that time, the shipbuilding industry, th \u2014 because of\nthe war, brought in a lot of people. And, of course, the army and the air f\u2014 corps \u2014\nwe\u2019re near by Langley Field, Fort Eustis, which we know is Fort Useless. Fact,\nJune 8, 2016\njust since we moved here, I met a family, and they were stationed in the area, and he\nworked at Fort Eustis, and when I said Fort Useless, he laughed.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Probably others as well, because while I\u2019m familiar with the family members\nthat were brought over, he had gotten other people to sponsor other immigrants, and\nI\u2019m not familiar who they would have been. Either the sponsors, or the immigrants.",
        "A: The \u2014 we mixed quite a bit. And there was another family, another member of\nthe Stern family lived in Newport News. She had married Ike Spiegel(ph).",
        "A: And Ike Spiegel(ph) has a business, appliances, right around the corner from\nwhere my father had a bi \u2014 his grocery store.",
        "A: And it was tradition that on Sunday we visited Ike and Bertha and her family,\nfor dinner. And it was always southern fried chicken.\nJune 8, 2016",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Somewhat, yes.",
        "A: No, not that I know of.",
        "A: As \u2014 remember, I left Newport News when I went to college.",
        "A: Seven.",
        "A: Yes. And after \u2014 right after that, and when I graduated, I was inducted into the\narmy \u2014",
        "A: And when I was discharged from the army, I went to Fairmont, West Virginia.",
        "A: So, at that point, my associations in Newport News were extremely limited.\nJune 8, 2016",
        "A: Well, as we \u2014 we followed the war, you couldn\u2019t help but be aware of what was\ngoing on. My mother constantly talked about it. In fact, at one point, William\ncautioned her not to be so public \u2014 public about it.",
        "A: Because the influences of Henry Ford, Father Coughlin, and so on, were also\nfelt in Newport News, and didn\u2019t want to bring anything to bear on the Jewish fa \u2014\ncongregation.",
        "A: Not really.",
        "A: Oh, yes.",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "A: Well, when you\u2019re called a kike, Christ killer, you know what\u2019s going on.\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\nJune 8, 2016",
        "A: Yeah, it was in school.",
        "A: I'll mention a couple of things. I played football. At one assembly in high\nschool, the coach was passing out the letters and so on, and I remember him saying,\nI knew we would have a winning season, because I have a Jew on the team.",
        "A: Pass it over.",
        "A: Mm-hm. And yet, probably at the time, the most successful basketball coach in\nVirginia was Julie Kahn(ph). As we called him, Madman Julie. During games he\nwould get so worked up, he would actually froth at the mouth. But he was athletic\ndirector, as \u2014 was basketball and track coach.",
        "A: He never mentioned it.",
        "A: Right. It\u2019s not unusual. We have \u2014 I\u2019ve experienced a few incidents. For\ninstance, when we first moved into Vantage House \u2014\nJune 8, 2016",
        "A: Yeah. I was asked whether I would conduct some services, and I started. And at\none point one of the residents, a Jewish, said we don\u2019t want so many services. We\ndon\u2019t want to call attention to ourselves.",
        "A: I can recall back in Fairmont, I was conducting a campaign \u2014 | think it was for\nIsrael bonds. It was either Israel bonds, or JNF. I forget which, cause I did both.\nBut the person that had been running the campaign, was approached by the fellow\nthat came from Pittsburgh to oversee the campaign, to have a public event. He said\nno, I won\u2019t do it. Well, I was president of B\u2019nai Brith at the time, and he asked me\nto do it. So I said, okay. And we set up a dinner meeting in a hotel.",
        "A: And, in addition to the Jewish people, I invited the presidents of the local banks,\ncause we were trying to sell \u2014 it was bonds, now that I remember putting it together,\nwe were approaching the banks to buy bonds. And we had a young man playing the\nguitar and singing, as entertainment. So he did his shtick, and he started to talk, and\nthe most influential \u2014 one of the most influential people in the community, a Jewish\ndoctor, got up and came to table; I was sitting with a friend. And he said, stop him.\nAnd my friend got up, and went up to the entertainment, said, no pitch. And the\nreason was, he didn\u2019t want to make a big deal of Jews. And after that, when I met\nhttps://collections.ushmm.org\n56June 8, 2016\nwith the \u2014 the representative of the campaign, I said, this will never happen again.\nAnd we had open campaigns throughout, afterwards. Not only for JNF, but also for\nIsrael bonds. And we invited \u2014 members of the family brought members of the\nfamily to all the events.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Haven\u2019t you her \u2014 haven\u2019t you heard of the camp \u2014 in the current campaign, we\ndon\u2019t want Sanders as president, because he\u2019Il think that anything goes wrong, it\u2019ll\nfall back, they\u2019 ll accuse the Jews? I\u2019ve heard it many times. There is a certain\ninsecurity that manifests itself at times.",
        "A: I said forget it. Let\u2019s go on. We have services twice a month here now, and it\u2019s\npublicized, well publicized. Every time we have a service, it\u2019s in the newsletter. It\u2019s\nin a sign in the elevators, when we have services. We have the afternoon group of\nthe NCJW meeting here.\nJune 8, 2016\nended up in the south, they were taken aback by what they saw as racial\ndiscrimination, when they would arrive and see that there are different facilities for\nwhite Americans and African Americans. Did things like that exist in Newport\nNews that collided, let\u2019s say, with your life, with your world down there?",
        "A: There was definitely segregation, there was discrimination, and it got to the\npoint, especially the further south \u2014 well, we \u2014 there were reports, when th-the civil\nrights movement was going on, that Jews didn\u2019t want the young people \u2014 Jewish\nyoung people coming down. We have to live here, they would say. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re\naware of that.",
        "A: Mostly gentile.",
        "A: Yes, all white.",
        "A: We were in the south.",
        "A: For instance, I mentioned that the \u2014 the grammar school was right down from the\nhigh school. There were separate high schools. There was Newport News high\nJune 8, 2016\nschool, and I forget what they call it, but the blacks had their own. And the days\nwere separate but equal \u2014 so called.",
        "A: Well, we went to Paris once, and London.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Actual year, I don\u2019t recall the actual year, but it had to be in the 70s, 80s.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes.\nJune 8, 2016",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Not that I know of.",
        "A: I have seen pictures of the house, yes.",
        "A: No. I had decided I was going back, very recently. Rita and I had planned a river\ncruise from Frankfurt to Amsterdam. We had our tickets, everything was planned.\nAnd I had contacted a person from the tourist bureau in Frankfurt. And I\u2019m \u2014 told\nwhat I was thinking about, and I would like to go back to see Rohrbach. And asked\nhim whether there was transportation available, of any kind. Replied that he would\nmeet me, and he would drive me. He was very friendly, very solicitous. But\nunfortunately, something happened, and I had to cancel the trip.",
        "A: So that\u2019s gone.",
        "A: Yes.\nJune 8, 2016",
        "A: Well, I think, about a week.",
        "A: It was all right unt \u2014 except for one incident. We had put up one night, I forget\nwhere, in a\u2014I guess you would call it, almost a bed and breakfast type of affair, an\napartment building. And I had con \u2014 talked to the man about paying the next day\nwith my credit card, and he said, fine. So the next morning, when I went to pay pare\n\u2014and I talked to his wife to take my credit card, he said oh, no, no, no, we can\u2019t\ntake it, you ha \u2014 you have to do that in advance. And so quickly I sprouted some\nGerman. Where it came from, I don\u2019t know. She said okay, okay. She took it.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Some, I \u2014 I can recall words at times.",
        "A: Hundred and twenty-five.\nJune 8, 2016",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: There\u2019s some things I might mention, that we haven\u2019t gone into.",
        "A: Directly across the street from our house in Rohrbach, was the synagogue.",
        "A: From the information I\u2019ve gotten on the internet, there were three tourists, they\ndisappeared. The building was sold at auction for around 500 marks \u2014 560 marks, I\nthink it said.",
        "A: It was a forced sale, and there are no records of that money ever having been\npaid. I thought that was interesting.",
        "A: This was in \u00b039 \u2014 38, \u00b039.June 8, 2016",
        "A: No.",
        "A: The Jews had disappeared. And apparently they made no effort to try to locate\nany that may have emigrated.",
        "A: Well, depending on \u2014 I see there you\u2019re getting to a legal matter \u2014 depending on\nthe validity of the auction sale, who \u2014 who bought it \u2014 there\u2019s no record of who the\nbuyer was. As far as any Jews \u2014 well, the Jewish congregation \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 family, who\u2019s left? I\u2019m the only one from my family left.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Well, the people in Rohrbach now, have no recollection of this. They re \u2014 they\nweren\u2019t born then. But they have \u2014 the community has a history, their parents or\ngrandparents, they share in a responsibility for what happened. They can say if they\nwant to, that they didn\u2019t know, but God, who do they think they\u2019re kidding? They\nhad to know. Just as the Poles say they didn\u2019t know that we had concentration\ncamps around the corner. They had to know.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Well, I remember that from the 61% Street house, they bought another house,\noverlooking the James river, which was just a mile or so away. Was a nice, small\nhouse, well taken care of. And he used to sit out on his back lawn, looking at the\nsunset, as it disappeared \u2014 the sun disappeared over the James river bridge, and so\non. He died, I think, in \u201956, or \u201957. He had retired. His son Jules had taken over the\nbusiness.\nJune 8, 2016",
