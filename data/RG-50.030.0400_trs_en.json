People who were -- normally who were like friends,\nspecially the kids were playing together, and when we went to the ghetto, all our goods were --\nwe used to push to the neighbors, because we have only 15 minutes to go out from the house.\nAnd we could take very little with us.

        "A: At home I spoke Yiddish. And in the school in the beginning, I was in the -- in a Jewish\nPolish school. It was Jewish children, but the main language was Polish, the first four years. And\nthen I changed to a Jewish gymnasium, after the six years. And then I was starting gymnasium\nuntil the beginning of the war, until 1t was destroyed.",
        "Q: A-And then you had to speak Russian?",
        "A: Russian I have to start to speak in 1939 when the -- when Poland was divided, and Wilna start\nRussian for a short time, and then they gave it to Lithuanian after two months. And it was\nLithuanian. But in the first years when it was Lithuanian, the main language was Russian,\nbecause the population was not Lithuanian, the Lithuanian was otherwise. Little by little they\nstart to come from the counties after the war. After the war for a long time, Vilnius was\nLithuanian but the main language was Russian. For a long time, and then they start to protest th-\nthat they want -- when they have enough people already in Wilna, they came from all kinds of\nthe counties, they start to talk Lithuanian, in the stores, in the banks, in that -- but before it was\nrush -- Russian.",

        "Q: And when you say that you were under the influence of your sisters and they were socialists,\nwhat did that mean?",
        "A: They believed in working people. They belong to organizations, I wer -- and the school was\nalso a little bit in the left direction. And they believed in Russia, in the Soviet Union, because we\ndidn\u2019t have any information what\u2019s doing there. But the propaganda was so high. The people saw\nth -- especially for the Jewish people, they look and study, they\u2019Il be able to study, they\u2019Il be\nfree, they will -- for example, I'll tell you a story. I was in my school, as I told you, it also was\nwith a left direction, and when Russia gave Vilnius up to the Lithuanian, they came with their\npropaganda to the schools, and ask the children if they want to study and have their freedom,\nthey can go to Russia, to Byelorussia, to Ukraine. And they can study free, and they can became\nteachers and engineers and what, and they\u2019 II have their freedom. A lot -- and who wants? We can\nmake lists, and tomorrow, the day after tomorrow, they can leave. And lots of the older classes of\nthe children, they scribed themself in the lists. And they are going to Byelorussia to work, to -- to\nstudy, to the schools, and they -- and they left very warm and nice families. And left during the\nweek to Russia. And weg -- they came there -- of course they came into the schools, to the\nuniversity, one -- get the teacher th -- and they -- but they saw the hard life of there. They saw\nthat the reality is different. And they didn\u2019t have a way back. They couldn\u2019t go back to their\nparent. And you know, children, they tried, that -- but they left their parents, their homes, and it\nwas lot of them. And one of them was a sister of a good friend of mine. And they went after, and\nthey start to study, of course they were hungry, they didn\u2019t have what to wear, they have -- and\nthey were homesick. And after a couple of months, or a half a year, they came again with lists.\nWho wants to go to see their parents, to the -- of course lots of people said they want. And the\nsister of my friend also [indecipherable] she want to go to Wilna, back to see the parent. And\nthey instead to send -- and after awhile, instead to send them back to Wilna, they send them to\nSiberia. A lot of them. And this girl, her name was -- now she [indecipherable] after the -- after\nthe war she get married. And she went there, and she was working very hard, and she was in the\nforest to cut the trees, and they gave her a little warm jacket, and some big shoes, and the\n[indecipherable] worked very, very hard, and we didn\u2019t have any information. One thing was\ngood, the whole family was killed, and she was alive. And she worked very hard, and in -- it was\nthe -- the patriation from the -- the Polish citizens after the war. I think it was in \u00b047 - \u201948 that\nthey can return to Poland to get their Polish citizenship. She describe herself [indecipherable]\nreturn to Poland and then she went to -- to [indecipherable] or somewhere, and finally she came\nto the United States. When I came to the United States in \u201976, I met her, and she told me all the\nstories. Her family was killed, and she was working the place I am working now, and she\nrecognize me as the friend of her sister. And she said, \u201cYou know what, I have a job for you. If\nyou will be accepted,\u201d she said, \u201cI am working for the Jewish labor committee in New York, and\nI am getting married\u201d -- he -- a second time her husband also died young. \u201cAnd I\u2019Il introduce\nyou, because they need a Jewish secretary.\u201d My English was very poor in that time. And she\nbought me in, and only one person spoke Yiddish, the other spoke English, was a broken\nEnglish. She introduced me to the executive director, it was a [indecipherable] in that time. And\nhe said, okay, if you will take a course of English, if you would take a course of -- of typing. If\nyou would take this and this, come after three months, and she\u2019s working o -- for three months\nyou\u2019re working, and we\u2019ll -- she\u2019Il show you the work, and then we\u2019ll come and we'll see. I did\neverything he said, I took a course of English, I took a course of typing. My Yiddish was -- it\nwas very good years ago, but for the 30 years I was in Russia, I forget also. But I try to\nremember, and I worked very much the job because I was 52, and I still don\u2019t want to be a\nbargain on my children. I want a little bit my own life. And she\u2019s show me a lot, the girl. And\nafter three months I came. Of course my English was very poor, and my typing a letter that I\nsupposed to type now in five minutes, I type in that period of time for an hour. But the Yiddish\nwas Okay. He said we\u2019ll take you to try, three months, and I was trying, but it still was very hard.\nAnd the most horrible thing was for me to take the telephones. I mixed up the names, I -- he\ndictate me an letter, my boss, and I tried to write everything like he said. And when I came for\nhis signature he crossed out one, two, three, four.

It was two children from my one sister, and one boy from the other sister. And with the last\ntrain we send them back with the women to Warsaw, thinking that the safest place would be\nWarsaw because the propaganda was very high in that time, that Poland is very strong, and she\ndoes -- she is not afraid for everybody. S -- so that capital, the Germans will not come. And all of\na sudden, it changed. And the ghetto was smaller, smaller, but people were not killed in that\ntime. We know there was hunger, then there was -- there is no clothes, it was [indecipherable],\nand there were ne -- not enough place for them, but they\u2019re alive. And when the war start, the\nGermans came to Wilna, after the war start with Russia, we thought, okay, it will be like in\nWarsaw. Some people run away, some couldn\u2019t. My family didn\u2019t run away, I don\u2019t know why,\nbut some run away and had to return because Russia didn\u2019t allow it in the beginning, to go in.\nThey thought that we are spies, or what. They still don\u2019t -- and you know -- but we said okay,\nwe'll survive the war, like in Warsaw. In Warsaw they started killing later -- later on. As it start\nto be in all the countries.",

        "A: We couldn\u2019t. We couldn\u2019t. First of all it was a lot of money, and it has to be relatives. You are\nthinking e -- before the war, yes?",
        "Q: Yes, before, mm-hm.",

        "A: Before the war, when Hitler came to the power, after years, of course we have stories about\nanti-Semitism there, about -- even, I think, Kristallnacht [indecipherable]. We were ver -- very\nafraid if the Nazis will come, if Germany will come here. And as soon as they hear that the war\nstart, a lot of people run away to Russia. Luta\u2019s family run away to rush -- and they went until\nMinsk, and they didn't allow them to go through the -- through the border. And they returned\nwhen the Germans were there, they returned little by little back to their homes, because they\ncouldn't go through, and then they went through the whole ghetto, and --",

        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: No, no, I could -- I -- I don\u2019t remember what we know. A lot was going on in the -- Germany.\nAnd we saw the situation in Poland like they start to be like Nazis. Not everybody, but especially\nbetween the students, and --",
        "Q: How do you explain that, that young people did it at first? Students standing outside of shops,\nthat -- that sounds so unusual.",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes, yes. Not the socialist, but they have to choose between the Russia and\nGermany, and they like better the ru -- German. They didn\u2019t expect what will happen, you know?\nThen, when they lost the war right away, the situation changed.",
        "Q: Was there ever any discussion in your family as the war drew closer, or began, of -- of hiding\npeople, perhaps even further out in -- in the countryside, or --",
        "A: But the Polish people were very afraid. They were very scared, because there were several\nsituations that they show -- they hang th-this Pole for hiding a Jew, or -- and they show it on the\nmarket openly, the people saw it --",
        "Q: In Wilna?",
        "A: -- and they were afraid, yeah. They were afraid. And then, when the people went to the\nghetto, most of the people didn\u2019t believe that it will be for long. They said a couple weeks and\nthe war will be ended. And all their goods they put to the Polish people, and then they didn't\nwant to give it -- it back. So they were happy, others thought, oh, they were nice people, too.\nAnd I think if we would burn everything what we have, that the people would be nicer to us.\nSecondly, Pll tell you, when the Russians came, the Jews were happy. Ill to -- I told you, they\nthought they\u2019Il have finally their freedom. They\u2019Il can study, they\u2019ll can be like the -- all the\npeople, like it was in the very beginning, in spite that the -- the situation was hard to leave, that\nthey were poorer or whatever. But they had a little bit their freedom in the very fa -- beginning.\nAnd -- and the Poles saw how they were happy with that. And the reality was different. After two\nor three years the politics changed there. Maybe that was the reason. But there were nice people\nalso. I have in our mill, when we went into the ghetto, for seven months or for a year, I worked\non a farm five miles from our home, early before the war. And we have a person who were\nworking in our mill. He was a -- a bachelor and -- and he saw me once that I am going with a\n[indecipherable] on the middle of the street with another 200 people to the farm. For an hour, for\nan hour and a half we march until we came to work, to nine o\u2019clock. This person saw me once\nand all of a sudden I see that he is going with a package behind our -- our group, and he is going\nfor five miles, until they -- they find a situation and they start to go to the end to talk to him. He\nwas afraid, but he gave me the package, bread with a bottle of milk, and disappeared. Every day\nuntil I worked there, this person, a Polish boy who worked for us for a couple of years, did it. I\nwould never expect that this person can be moved. It too --",
        "Q: What was his name?",
        "A: Hi-His name was Mironchik, but I don\u2019t know the last name. I meet him after the war, he was\nstill the same bachelor living wa -- in one of the rooms in our house, poor, of course. I came, I\nsupported him, and then he came to me in the end, maybe a five years because I left, he said, I\nwant to get the -- to get a pension and I can\u2019t get a pension because I don\u2019t have enough years,\nbut I worked for your father for a lot of years, maybe for 10 years, but I don\u2019t have anything\nfrom them. Maybe you can come and tell. And I came and tell. I didn\u2019t want to tell that we were\ncapitalists, that we have a store because [indecipherable] it was not rich, we were very low\nmiddle class because I have a lot of -- you know. But I went and he said, he worked for your\nfather, your father had -- I said, yes, my father in that time was sick and he couldn\u2019t work by\nhimself, and he took this person for -- and I remember him very well. I want very much him to\nget the pension. And -- and I can guarantee that he work for the 10 years, and -- and he believed\nme, and he got the pension. I was happy that I can -- of course I gave him money, I gave what to\nwear after the war when my situation was better. But, that I could do by him this thing, because\nhe was really a simple person, but he was -- he had a heart. Can you imagine that in the ghetto he\nbrought in a half a loaf of bread with a bottle of milk? Maybe it saved the life during the hunger.\nIt was not so easy to get in with it to the ghetto, but somehow I hide it in -- between my pants,\nsomehow came, if I could. If I saw that some Germans had -- staying to the entrance -- to the\nentrance of the ghetto, we can go around on the middle of the [indecipherable] for hours until we\nsaw that it\u2019s cleared up and we can get in to put in the little thing that we have, we worked on a\ngarden, they gave us a little bit carrots and potatoes and -- to put in somehow hide it. And we can\ndo it only if nobody works with -- only was a Jewish policeman at the entrance of the ghetto. So\nI s -- we saw there were Polish -- Polish, were lot of people. Luta will also tell you a story about\nthe people who worked in her house for -- for many years, and how they helped.",
        "Q: Okay, let\u2019s stop now.",
        "A: We are a little --\nEnd of Tape One\nBeginning Tape Two",
        "Q: Before we begin s-speaking about the changes in the ghetto, can you tell us about your friend,\nwho you call Luta, that\u2019s her nickname, but tell us her name, and then tell us how you first met\nher.",
        "A: Luta\u2019s name was Sulamit Shrey -- Shreyber. I was in one school with her brother Josef. Her\nbrother was a class higher than me. We were the same age, but he was a class before. In 1939 we\nwere at the summer house in a place called Nemencheny, and there, the place we were, were\nthree houses. In one lived Luta\u2019s family, 1n one was -- in the second was the family of my\nbrother-in-law from Warsaw, and the third house was ours. And in that time, as I told you, the\nchildren and the grandchildren of my mother and her children from Warsaw came and also stay\nwith us at the hou -- summer house.",
        "Q: Luba?",
        "A: Luba and Riva, but when -- with their husband. Well -- but when their vacation finished and\nthey have to return to Warsaw, the children were staying with us. And we were very friendly\nwith the family of Shreyber, with Luta\u2019s family. And her father was the director of a technical\nschool, and my sister, being in the last year in high school, also took courses in the technical. So\nher father knew very well my sister and my brother-in-law. And we were young people, and they\nwere very friendly with her brother. And she was a little girl in that time. She is five years\nyounger than me, was a very beautiful girl and we all like her, but I was friends with her brother,\nwith Josef. And then the war start, and with the last train we send the children to Warsaw to their\nparent, because my mo-mother believed the children has to be with their parent, and that Warsaw\nwas the safest place in Poland. And then the war starts, and everybody went to their own place,\nand as there were the pact between Molotov and -- and Hitler and Poland was divide, Wilna start\nto be Russia, Lithuanian, and Warsaw was cut off. And then we start a normal life. We were\ngoing back to school in \u201939, and sa -- we very happy with us, as each other, I start to date her\nbrother, and we meet every evening in -- in school. And he was coming to our house, and I was\ngoing to their house, instead what we would live in different corners of the city. And \u201899 was a\nvery happy year, and before 1940, until \u00b041 when the war started in Russia and Germany.",
        "Q: When Wilna was divided, when Wilna became part of Russia, what were the changes that you\nexperienced? Can you talk a little bit about that, in the city?",
        "A: Yes. First of all, they took out the property of the rich people. And then everybody start to\nwork, to find something -- work. The ch -- they make changes in the school system, as I told you,\nthis was gymnasium, and al -- they make 10 - 11 classes, and that\u2019s it. Everybody -- everything\nstart to be in Russian, Russian -- Russian was the main language, with a little bit Yiddish,\nbecause it was hard to go through. There was no anti-Semitics, there was -- the people were very\nnice there, one who came in the beginning, but you saw that they were -- they didn't know the --\nthe life that we have before in Poland. The soldiers, everybody who came from Russia, they\nempty out right away all the stores. In the beginning, the owners of the store was happy because\nbefore business wasn\u2019t going so well. And then, all of a sudden people start to buy -- buy\neverything. They bought nightgowns and went to the [indecipherable] in them, and th-the -- the\nwifes of the soldiers, of the officers who came to Wilna. And -- but then they saw that okay,\nthey\u2019re buying everything, but they don\u2019t have where to buy new stuff, to hold the business. So\nthey were a little bit scary. And then, after awhile, they start to pick up the rich people, send to\nSiberia. And they organized the youth to help them, the [indecipherable] and there were a lot of\nJewish people also involved with the [indecipherable] that they didn\u2019t know, they believed them.\nAnd they were very upset. They took them to homes, and told the people to pack -- pack bag,\nthey\u2019re going on -- on the tracks to the trains and they\u2019re going somewhere to rau -- to -- to\nSiberia, to Russia, and -- and people were upset, why, what? But finally it was good for them\nbecause the one they took out, they survive the war, and the one who stayed got killed, mostly.\nMost of them were killed by the Germans. But in -- the time being, it was horrible. People who\nwere not rich, they had a little store maybe, they suffered for surviving with the little store, all of\na sudden they get the [indecipherable] they get -- rich people they have to go out, Capitalists they\nhave to go out of the city. And they send them far away, deep in Russia, and it was very sad.",
        "Q: Wh-Wha -- was your family afraid that you would be labeled rich afterwards?",
        "A: Yes, yes. But they didn\u2019t touch us. We were not enough rich to -- we have the mill, we have\nthe house, but we were -- you know, have a lot of loans to pay, so we have problems. And all of -\n- all of the family start to work -- to work, you know, hard. My sisters, and -- and I was study in\nschool.",
        "Q: But you continued to go to school?",
        "A: Yes, until the war started between Russia and Germany when they cut off the schools and\neverything. And I was dating Josef all this time, we were very good friends, and the families\nwere friends.",
        "Q: Tell us a little bit about him.",
        "A: He was a brilliant student. She was a very good person, he was intelligent and an aristocrat. I\nwas very 1n love with [indecipherable]. And we were study in school, were meeting in school,\nand after school he used to take me home. And then in the evening we meet aga -- again, we\nnever have enough of each other. And we were good friends, and when we came into the ghetto,\nor to the ghetto later -- the first year was quiet, and then I was working in a farm. Before I\nworked in Judenrat, do something, and they want to go out from the ghetto, it\u2019s very hard for to\nstay all the time. And I went to work for a farm and he went to work, to Gestapo. On the ho -- on\nthe yard of Gestapo, doing all kind of cleaning something -- he was very capable, so he did for\nthem in the -- in their workshop something, in the -- I don\u2019t know what. And it start to build up\nin the ghetto, Wilna partisan organization.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Before it was organized, it took a little time in the ghetto, and then the youth people of all\norganizations, Zionist, and Bundist and communist, who belongs to the youth organization\n[indecipherable] young people, and religious, and they get together and they start to think how to\nfight, what to do. Not to go like -- they saw the people disappear, disappeared from the ghetto,\nand before the ghetto and they didn\u2019t return. And they start to think about organize something in\nthe ghetto, and whoever works outside the ghetto, wherever they have a situation to bring in\nsome weapons, to -- to have something, in case. And he worked in the [indecipherable] of the\nGestapo, and somehow he had the possibility to take from them something. And he -- it was very\ndangerous I remember, until I saw him again coming from work, from out the ghetto, knowing\nthat he is carrying something. I was very, very scared. And [indecipherable] organization.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. [indecipherable] to the -- to the ghetto, can -- can you tell us -- it was established in\nthe fall of \u201941, correct?",
        "A: Yes, the fall \u201941, or the begi -- yes, on the beginning of 42.",
        "Q: So the months before that, what was going on? Let\u2019s say the spring and the summer before,\nhow were things changing?",
        "A: I will start with the beginning order --",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: -- of the ge -- how it come to the ghetto before. After a -- as soon as the Germans came into\nWilna, they surround themselves with the [indecipherable] of the population. And what do I\nmean? The thieves, the bandits, the -- the one in the -- in every yard has a -- a cleaning person or\nwere -- who were different, some were good and some were bad. But it was the bad people they\nsurround. Because how they knew who is a Jew, and who not. I for example was blonde, and the\nblue eyes in the beginning and who could tell? If the person who saw me or knew me, that was\njust [indecipherable]. After a week they start to catch men on the street. Men -- they ever saw a\nman, and they said he is Jewish, they catched him to a party, and put a party of 150 people, and\nthey disappeared. And they said to take with them a towel and a piece of soap. Later on I\u2019 tell\nyou, I find out after the war for what it was. And people start disap -- the men start disappearing.\nOr they ring in an apartment, if a man opened the door, he may be in slippers, he may be without\na shirt. They gave him a [indecipherable] they came over with three or five people to a door, and\nget him out -- out to the street, and they disappeared. Before that, a week after the Germans came\nin -- five days after they came in, they find out who are the leader -- the Jewish leaders of the si -\n- because what did the population -- what do they know, the whole population? They are living\ntheir normal life and that\u2019s it. But there were leaders who had big positions, who had -- can say a\nword to government about their people, who can stand up from the -- the first thing they came,\nthey picked up 60 famous people and they shot them right away. Was several people of my\nfriends. So there were nobody to tell the world what -- wh-what happened to the Jews, get th-the\nfamous people who -- like famous doctors or famous lawyers, or famous politicians. And there\nwere a lot because this was a big Jewish community. Wilna, who had in that time 400 -- 250\npopulation, 74 of the population were Jewish. It means a third of the population are Jewish\npeople.",
        "Q: H-How did you hear about that, the leaders?",
        "A: I knew it, I knew it. Right away people knew.",
        "Q: You did?",
        "A: Of course. It was a Dr. Ragovski, and Ailitch and Kaplan Gablanksi, it was famous people in\nthe [indecipherable] who always stand up for the Jewish people and have connections with the\ngovernment. There were even people who were in the same. And they disappeared, they were\nshot. So the population get with less people, and le -- and without leaders. Then, after three\nweeks, it was a rumor that in the Jewish center of the city, there was a Jewish center, a small\nstreets, with big buildings in a yard, maybe with four buildings, not the rich people, were Jewish\npeop -- it the Jewish center. Most of the Jewish people were living there, all the -- the cleaning\npeople were not the Jewish [indecipherable]. And all of a sudden it was a rumor that in that area\na German was shot. And in one night they came in and they cleaned up everybody from the area.\nIt was about six, 7,000 people. And they made it so fast, right from the bat on the street. They\ncould be in the nightgowns, it was out sleeper [indecipherable]. A lot of people came from the\nbandit, from the soldier, Lithuanian, Germans were, and they throw it out the middle of the\nstreet, and when all the area was empty up, they went out and they took them to Ponary. Ponary\nwas a beautiful forest behind Wilna, and they shot them. After a week, they established a ghetto.\nThey were going from all areas of the city, 1t was five boroughs, and going from home to home.\nPut them everybody on the street, and they were driven to the ghetto. For example, into our\nhouse, my father, before that, was taken -- we called them the harponi. They catched, they\nharped mans, and he was taken to such a party with the men, and he was an old man, he was in\nthe -- in that time 67 years old. But my mother, she was very energetic, she was going after them\nand asking, and -- let him go back, let him go back, he\u2019s an old man, what do you want to -- and\nfinally they let him go back. After that, it was establish a camp -- a five miles after our area\nwhere we lived, for turf, work with the turf, you know what\u2019s turf? Turf is earth, and they\nworked it up. And then it was like to heat the ovens like coal, like --",
        "Q: Limestone?",
        "A: Stuff for heating up, it was coal, coal --",
        "Q: Okay, okay.",
        "A: -- [indecipherable] in English also. And it was establish such a camp, so -- and my father and\nmy brother-in-law was taken to this camp, the -- it was behind [indecipherable] it was called\nRasha. And they were working a lot of people at that, three, 400 people were working on the\ncamp in the Rasha. So when -- when we were driven to the ghetto, my father and my brother-in-\nlaw wasn\u2019t there. But it was as I remember, my sister lived -- has an apartment in our yard, in the\nother building, with a little child of two years. And in our home I was with my mother with\nanother sister. And it was about three o\u2019clock at night, and all of a sudden we heard that\nsomebody is knocking in the door. And seven, eight people; one soldier, one German, one\nLithuanian, some other people, first -- first we have you in 50 minutes you have to go, take\nwhatever you have -- can took in your hand, and go out to the street. We -- the only thing was we\ndid in the 50 minutes, that the best things were put to our neighbors. And my sister took the\nchild, she took the wagon of the child, she put in the wagon whatever and the child and we put\nsome -- it was September, it was hot. We even didn't think about the winter, and we took\nwhatever we had, other things we hide and then some were in the basement, some were\n[indecipherable] and we went out to the street.",
        "Q: Let me just stop you there. From the time they knocked on the door, can you des -- describe\neven in more detail who did what, was your mother in charge, who ran next to the neighbor,\nwhat did you give them?",
        "A: My mother and my sister would give us our line and our dresses, our winter coats out,\nwhatever we can took from the closet [indecipherable] and to the -- especially to [indecipherable]\nshe wi -- she was living there for 20 years. So then they went -- so we came into the ghetto.",
        "Q: So how did you get there, did you walk?",
        "A: We walk. We walked in the middle of the street, the whole part until the end of the street, it\nwas a long street. And they were go -- when I came in, lots of people were staying with the --\ntheir packages, with the children, with the -- waiting until everybody will go out. And then when\nthey empty out all the houses, nobody can be leaved -- left in the house, there were too many.\nAnd we went to the ghetto. And from different boroughs in the same day, they bring the people\nto the ghetto. And we came in, we find -- me and my mother and my sister and my little nephew,\nmy second sister, we came to a yard who my school was. And we find a corner in a little room,\nbecause it was lots, lots of people. And th -- in a room who was one person or a -- maybe 20 - 25\npeople, everybody has a little corner, a little middle to -- to sit down. And after awhile it starts\nthen -- it starts to organize stores, little -- for people to give that -- to have some cards that we\ncan have some bread, some butter. It was organized before, potatoes they give us\n[indecipherable] can be, somehow to survive. And they start to organize groups to go out for\nwork on some places where the soldiers are, on gardens, on some plants, on some -- somewhere\nto work and people went out -- some were working inside the ghetto from the very beginning.\nAfter maybe three weeks in the ghetto, it was Yom Kippur or maybe after a month. All of a\nsudden were rumors in ghetto, that this night the Germans will ke -- come for people. And they\nmake all kinds of lists, and the lists were done in my area where I lived and my sister has a friend\nwho were a Jewish policeman in the ghetto, and he s -- and somehow she find out that I were in\nthe lists. So she said, what should I do? She said, I will cross her out. But better that she will not\nstay at home, because they were ta -- they will take people from this area in ta -- in case they\ndidn\u2019t have enough, they can take from the one who are close [indecipherable]. And I went to my\nboyfriend, to meet Luta. She lived in Shtrashona too -- Shtrashona, I don\u2019t remember exactly the\nnumber, but it was a yard and four big buildings. And in every building, in every apartment, who\nnormally lived a family of three or five, lived 40. in one part. And the Germans came in the\nmiddle of the night, 1t was Yom Kippur, it was raining, it was cold, it was terrible conditions,\npeople were sleeping, everything was going on in the middle of the night. And they didn\u2019t go to\nthe area they promised, they didn't look at a list, they came to one street, where my boyfriend and\nI was hiding and they surrounded two big buildings. In every yard was four big buildings. And\nthey picked up the people and they took them everybo -- I remember they came to my -- to our\napartment and Luta\u2019s father said, should we take some food, so -- some thing, some food. You\nwant you can take, you don\u2019t want you can take, you can take a piece of bread, was strange. And\nthey took us out to the main street of the ghetto, Rudnitska. And Luta, she was all the time out of\nthe ghetto, but this time she came to the ghetto for awhile. She was 13 years old in that time. And\nwe came to Rudnitska, a lot of people were staying already, driven out from the house, and we\nwere staying in the party, and Luta start, she was -- they f -- and the father said, \u201cYou young, you\nwill be taken to work, I don\u2019t know about us, but\u201d -- she said, \u201cNo, we\u2019re -- all will be killed.\nThey are taking us to kill there.\u201d And she start -- and her mother was scared from her shouting\nup. And the mother knew perfect German. And in charge of the whole -- of the whole German,\nthe people who took care of the whole party was in black -- in a black suit with a swastika\n[indecipherable] head with the -- with the --",
        "Q: Hat?",
        "A: -- all kind of the signs. And she went to him and she says, my husband 1s an engineer, and my\nhusband lives in the Judenrat, let him out, where are you taking us? And he pushed us away. She\nwent a second time to him, let us go, my husband is an engineer, my husband works for the\nJudenrat, my husband did this and my husband [indecipherable]. Let us go home. He pushed us\nagain. She went five times, and the Lithuanian soldier came and gave her a push and she fall\ndown and then she came back to us and she said, 1s nothing I can do, or they don\u2019t listen to me,\nwhat should we do? And we were staying upset, prepared to go with all the [indecipherable]. All\nof a sudden, the German in the black, who was in charge of the whole a -- goes through the older\ngroup of the people, said, \u201cWhere is the frau from Judenrat?\u201d [indecipherable]. \u201cWho is the\nwoman from the Judenrat?\u201d One person came, he said, \u201cNo it\u2019s not you.\u201d Then another person,\nno it\u2019s not you. And we were staying not thinking about anything, and he came, \u201cYou,\u201d to her\nmother. \u201cTake your family and stay next to me.\u201d We took our family, and some other people\ncame like they are the family, and we were staying next to him, and the Lithuanian soldier don\u2019t\nwant us to stay next to him, and they pushed us again. And -- and we tried to stay next to him,\nand they pu -- then th -- he said to them, \u201cLet them -- let them stay, don\u2019t touch them. And he go\nafter me and he went unti -- we went with him until the end of the whole group of people. And\nwe saw that he was counting, one, two, three, four, 900 -- 900 -- 998, and he give a short mark\nwith the hand, go forward with the whole group surround by all the [indecipherable]. And to us\nhe said, \u201cYou can go home, you are saved.\u201d It was maybe five o\u2019clock in the morning, 5:30, it\nwas dark, it was raining, we were wet. And all the soldiers are looking, how come your -- you\nunderstand, the Germans are a very accurate. If they have to take 998 people, they\u2019Il never take\n999. They\u2019 Il take 998 like they were told. And it was a little bit more, and maybe the mother\ncame to his mind that she was bothering him, bothering him, said ah, anyway, some people has\nto be left, let the woman with the family be left. Somehow it came to his mind. No explanation. I\nam sure, instead of us went somebody else, because he needed the amount of the people. So we -\n- and another maybe 10 were left over. They have more as they need. And we came back -- we\ndidn\u2019t go back right away, we went to our basement, we were trembling all, and we were downs\n-- and it was raining very much, we went to the first basement and hide, and everybody was\nlooking at us. And we came back to our place we lived. The light were on, all the apartment were\nempty from the two yards, from the eight big buildings, w-we are the only one who return from\nit. And when we came back in the morning I saw my family, my mother and my sister, with the\nchild of her hand, crying. That they know -- they knew that I went there to sleep over, and they\nknew that people from there were sent to the -- they all were sent to Ponar and Vershat. And after\nthe war when I go -- went to Ponar, I saw the place there was -- they were shot, and they fen --\nfind out who they were because after the war people take out this and they saw this or this\nskeletons, and that. Why, when they picked up the mans on the st -- the man on the street, and\nthe man from the houses, why did they tell them to take a towel and soap? When they bore them\nto Ponary, to the forest where they killed them, they made a big hole, and put a disk over the\nhole. And the people -- the man were a little bit far away. One after the other, and they have to\nbinch their eyes. And one by one they put them to this hole, through -- when they came to the\ndisk, they shot them, and they fall to their hole. In one side or the other where they shot until the\nend, or half alive. Nobody came from there back, you know [indecipherable]. But this -- this way\nthey told them to take a towel and a piece of soap, not to under -- the piece of soap not\nunderstand and the towel to be in their eyes, not to see the last moment of their death. You have\none, I told you that an accident. I could be [indecipherable] what come to his mind, to save this\nwoman with her family, I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: At that point what did -- how did people understand what was happening?",
        "A: They didn\u2019t --",
        "Q: Did you understand that -- that -- that you were taken --",
        "A: They didn\u2019t know, they said they are taken to a camp for work. They are -- were lying\nterrible, people -- later on people understood, and I\u2019ll tell you a little bit later about it. Otherwise\nit finished. In that time, my mother was hiding somewhere, and they didn\u2019t find her. No, in this\ntime they di -- she didn\u2019t hide, because they picked up the two buildings and this area where my\nmother was, they didn\u2019t -- they didn\u2019t touch anybody from there. But after awhile was another --\nanother story. It went another two months quiet, people were working, people were eating, the\nyoung people were laughing, you know it -- you -- you -- young people, they want to live. There\nwere secret schools where the young people were educated. About Luta\u2019s father she\u2019 ll tell he --\nyou by herself, how he organized a school for students, for people to -- to learn something.\nYoung people they have what to do. And it was so -- everything secretly because th-the Germans\ndidn\u2019t want people to -- to learn, to study, to -- they want only to work, whatever they could, not\nto -- and the Jewish people want to study, they want to learn. They want to like literature and the\n-- them -- organize the [indecipherable]. Th -- they di -- they want to live. But about her father,\nyou\u2019re a -- she will tell you hers-herself. There was another -- another action. We call it action\nwhen there were rumors that the Germans are coming for people. All of a sudden they find out\nthat people who are working have to have pink certificates. And the pink certificates were given\nat the work where the people -- at the working place where the people worked. Like my\nboyfriend worked in Gestapo, he got such a schein. They were -- called it a schein, a pink schein.\nSome people from the ghetto who worked in the ghetto in Judenrat have so -- pink schein. And\nthese pink scheins were [indecipherable]. And the person with a pink schein can des-describe to\nhim a wife and children before 16. My boyfriend jo -- Josef has such a schein, and he want to\ndescribe me as his wife. But we lived together with -- with his cousin, a woman who was more\nthan 30. And then his father ask him, you know what, Rochola is so young, she can go with my\ndaughter of 16, but Dina is old, and she can\u2019t go with my [indecipherable]. Can\u2019t you describe\nDina as your wife? And I will describe Rochola as my daughter, because he also has a pink\nschein from the Judenrat.",
        "Q: Rochola was your nickname?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: In Yiddish they called me Rochola.",
        "Q: Rochola, okay.",
        "A: Yeah. And then [indecipherable] 17, I was still Rochola, lot of people called me until now\nRochola. My other sister was described to another person as -- as his wife and my other sister\nalso find a guy who describe her as her wife.",
        "Q: So people were essentially sort of listing friends or relatives as their wives and children?",
        "A: Y-Yeah -- not -- not that.",
        "Q: To keep them safe?",
        "A: You know, some people has -- had pink schein and they didn't have anybody, they were\nbachelors, or what. So if they know each other, they describe them as a wife, and went out with\nthem as a wife. My mother didn\u2019t have such a -- and she -- she didn\u2019t have a hiding place, and\nshe was still in the ghetto. And my sister was with her all the time looking, something for her.\nAnd she left her of five minutes, she has to go to somebody, ask if they have for her a hiding\nplace. And my mother saw that she is -- my sister will not leave her alone, and she was\n[indecipherable] what should she do. And she has in her pocket a couple of da -- of rubles, of\nmoney. She said, I have to meet her in five minutes, but I\u2019Il try to go to the exit. Maybe\nsomehow I will go out [indecipherable]. And she went to the exit -- no, I'll tell you about -- later\nhow she went out. My sister returned to the place where my mother has to meet her, my mother\ndidn\u2019t return. She come to there, where is my mo -- I can\u2019t find the mother. And she was crying\nand I was crying and we\u2019re looking for my mother, my mother disappeared. We went to the\nworking place, and to the places where they put us. They put us to the other ghetto, before it was\ntwo ghettos, from one side of the street and from the other, and all of a sudden they liquidated\none ghetto. And they put them to the Ponary. And in that ghetto they liquidated the\n[indecipherable] and the people from the ghetto out, somewhere out to the places where they\u2019re\nworking and some were to the second ghetto wa -- what was empty out, for the couple of days.\nAnd I was wer -- crying. My mother wi -- I didn't know where she 1s, she was killed, she was\nshot, or -- all the three day -- three days we were in the other place. My friend Josef was working\nfor the Gestapo -- the Gestapo [indecipherable] yeah, doing all kind of -- of hard work. And he\nhas a Polish woman who worked in their house for 40 years. And she used to come to him where\nhe worked, every day. And he went out -- we were in the second ghetto, and he went out for the\nw-work every day. And he knew how I was crying and he told Vera, the woman, what happened\nto my mother, and the -- and they don\u2019t know where she is, and Rochola is crying all the time.\nShe said, \u201cYou know what, Ill go to the place where she was living before the war, maybe\nsomehow she went out of here.\u201d She went to the place when -- where I lived, and she find a letter\nfrom my mother, that she gave some money to the policeman and he let her out. She took out her\nstars, and she went out the place to the camp my father and my brother-in-law was all -- almost\nworking at the [indecipherable]. And she went by our house where we lived before, and she --\nshe saw that we will be concerned, and she left a letter that she\u2019s safe and she went to my father.\nAnd this woman, Vera, risk of her life, and she went there -- she went -- and next day she\nbrought my boyfriend Josef the letter from my mother, and he brought it in the second ghetto,\nand telling that my mama is alive and she is together with my father on to -- in the\n[indecipherable]. We returned after awhile to the ghetto to find that lots of, lots of people were\ntaken out. They said that they take that -- took them to work. They said that they -- they are alive.\nBut somehow thoughts came in that people who are alive, they may be surround with the -- with\nthe worst enemies, but somehow one of the thousands, thousands of people can find a connection\nand send something to the relatives, a sign that they are alive. If such signs doesn\u2019t come from\nanybody, it means that they are not alive. But people, they don\u2019t believe in this, they\u2019 ll believe in\nlife. They said, maybe, maybe they are working like we, they are somewhere, they are surround\nby the soldiers, they can\u2019t send anything. And they -- you know, they think that they are killed,\nbut in the underground they said that they are still alive and they can\u2019t believe that people can\nkill people. For what? We were in the ghetto another year, and it was all kind of feelings,\nfeelings. A couple of people worked for a plant somewhere. All of a sudden we heard they didn\u2019t\nreturn from work. They took them out to the yard and shot them, couple of hundred people. A\ncouple of hundred people worked somewhere in Bilavarka around Wilna, also in turf, and they\ndisappeared, they didn\u2019t return home after work to the ghetto, they were killed. They said they\nsend them to another camp, but no, they were killed. One time it were maybe a -- of -- over two\nyears, or a year and three quarters living in the ghetto, there were rumors that all the people from\nthe -- from the shtetla -- from the towns that surround Wilna were bringing to the Wilna ghetto.\nAnd from the Wilna ghetto they are going to Kovno, it was a city in Lithuanian, to build a big\nplant, a big factory. And people came from the -- you know, from the little towns around Wilna\nand they looked good, and they were -- were good dressed yet, and they came with all families,\nwith the old and with the sick and with the little children. They were about four and a half\nthousand people, and they all came to the ghetto. And they made a lot of friends they were study\nin the school, because our gymnasium was the only one in Poland with the Yiddish language,\nwho had right for coming in after finishing to go to the university. So from all Poland, people\nused to come to our school. And some of these people from the shtetla were in school, I knew\nthem and they looked well, because you know, in the little shtetla they are [indecipherable] air is\ngood, and th -- and they were for a week in the ghetto, and -- and they were [indecipherable] and\nwe saw that, and after a week they said that the trains are ready and they are going to Kovno to\nthe -- to view the factory. And everybody was going by themself without things. They are going\nto build a plant. They went to the wagons [indecipherable] with their kids and older people and\nthe -- and the sick and all kind, and when they all get in, they thought that the wagons were\n[indecipherable] they were closed with not to get out. They said why are they bombing the -- the\ntrains? The wagons that we ge -- we are going by ourself. We are told to go and we are going,\nwhy should we be closed? And they were chec -- they were watching, and a lot of people, young\npeople, they know the area. They know how to go to Kovno. And -- and they thought all of a\nsudden they are going to the forest from Ponar. So it was clear of them that they were not going\nto by -- but they were -- are going to shot them. Then they broke the windows of the going train,\nand they start to jump through the windows, whoever could, all over the forest. As soon as the\nGermans and the Nazi they saw it, they start to shot. And the whole forest was shot with dead\npeople. Very little could run out and survive, very little. Mostly they were shot. And the whole\nforest were with the dead, shot people. So tomorrow they came to the ghetto and they told the\nstory, the German. And they asks Gens, Gens was in charge of the ghetto, to give him men to\nclean up the forest. They were afraid to show the other people what they did. So they want the\npeople and they guaranteed Gens. And Gens -- you know who Gens was, yeah, had a big power.\nSo the German. And he guarantee that the people --",
        "Q: Jacob Gens.",
        "A: What?",
        "Q: Jacob Gens.",
        "A: Yeah, Jacob Gens. And they guaranteed that the people who did the work of cleaning up the\nforest will return, that they will not be shot. But [indecipherable] these people were the\n[indecipherable] who were taken to clean up the [indecipherable]. He came back. He promi --\nthat what he promised, he did, the people came back. They were all -- they find a lot of friends.\nThey told them to pick up of the dead people the teeth, the golden teeth, the jewelry, the --\nwhatever they can. If they have good shoes, the shoes, da, da, da. It was terrible, and put into\nthem [indecipherable] dead [indecipherable] half dead [indecipherable] you know. And it was\n4000 people, and to put them to the holes, to put with the -- all kinds of stuff to burn. And when\nthe people came back, some were crazy, they couldn\u2019t [indecipherable] and they told the real\nstory. And that\u2019s what the story is, we find out what is Ponary, and where all the people were\ngone. When I came back from the concentration camp, the first thing I went to was\n[indecipherable] to the Ponary, and I find out all the places where was the this, the -- the man\nwho were, the beginning of the war taken from the city, and this people, and the other people,\nand from [indecipherable] night where we were inside. And the children all of a sudden they\npicked up all the children until 16 years, and they put them in big trucks, and the kids didn\u2019t\nknow, they even were singing on the trucks, they are taking them to a camp for a co -- a couple\nof months. And they took them to Ponary and they sho -- shot them. It helped me out of a -- to\nsave Luta one time. I\u2019 ll tol -- tell you another story when we got to the camp. And that was the\nstory and in the end, and -- and the FPO organization to which I belong to the ef -- I came to the\nFPO much later than my boyfriend. It was very cyclically and they were afraid, they were afraid\nnot only for the Germans, they were afraid for the Jewish population because the Jewish\npopulation were against -- if you fight, they will kill all the ghetto. Otherwise, some will survive.\nAnd everybody was thinking, if somebody will be -- will survive, it will be me. Not another, but\nme. They were thinking with the -- you know, people don\u2019t believe in death, as I told you.",
        "Q: Rachel, when you heard about the -- the -- the people from shtetls who were killed in the\nforest, was that one of the first times that it -- you really began to realize what was going on?",
        "A: Lots of people, yes.",
        "Q: C-Can you talk a bit about that, I mean, do you remember what you were thinking, or how it\ndawned on you?",
        "A: It was very terrible. When his cousin -- her cousin came, I had told her the story, and the -- all\nmy friends who I meet two days ago, were shot on such a -- and you know, it was very terrible,\nbut what can we do? What can we -- the [indecipherable] we -- we didn't have a place to hide,\nnobody would take us. Where should we go? And there lo -- then, all of a sudden, and the\n[indecipherable] organization, a couple of hundreds people, we prepared some lamps with -- with\nstuff who can -- who can shut out, you know, in case when the Germans look and we\u2019 ll throw\nwhatever we have in the hands and we\u2019|I fight. It was very hard to get connections with the\npeople from the forest. We were alone. And until we get a connection to take out some people in\nthe forest. It took a lot of time. A lot, a lot of time. And finally people saw that this is nonsense,\nto fight against the German where we don\u2019t have any weapons. When we don\u2019t have military\npeople to rule us. And we\u2019re thinking about the forest [indecipherable] but how? And all of a\nsudden, it was maybe a month before the liquidation of the Wilna ghetto, yes, and we in the\npartisan organization of the ghetto, every night some people were sleeping in the apartments\nwhose window go out -- outside the ghetto, little, little pieces, and they have watch. If they saw\nthat soldiers are surrounding the ghetto, they have to come to their leaders and say the parole\nLisaroft. Lisaroft was the parole of [indecipherable]. I was --",
        "Q: That would be the head?",

        "Q: Lisaroft?",
        "A: Lisaroft.",
        "Q: Okay.",

        "A: And you throw and -- and we were staying waiting. I was next to Josef. All of a sudden the\nGermans and the Lithuanian and the group of -- of 12 or 15 people, together with one of our\nleaders, came to the yard and they said, don\u2019t fight [indecipherable] in Russia -- in Yiddish\n[indecipherable]. Don\u2019t fight. Whatever you have, put -- they are taking you to Estonia for work.\nAnd we decided not to fight.",

        "Q: So -- so let\u2019s pick up with that story. You\u2019re describing a night where some people in the\nresistance movement were going to have an action, you were going to rebel.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: And you were all ready, and you were waiting for the order.",
        "A: Yes, and we didn\u2019t have the order.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s pick up there, you didn\u2019t have the order.",

We will -- we\u2019ll die, we\u2019ll die, but we\u2019ll do something.\nBut without an order you can\u2019t do, we were told do -- do -- don\u2019t do anything without an order.\nAnd the order come because they decided all of a sudden to go out to the forest, not to fight in\nthere. But it was too late. Until they find the connections, until they decide that the -- until the\nstory for it -- for itself.",
        "Q: Do you think -- did you agree with your boyfriend that -- with Josef, do you think you should\nhave fought?",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes. I wouldn\u2019t be alive, but you know. I don\u2019t know, I do -- I really don\u2019t know.\nFrom the other side, they would kill us in -- in a second and then what use? What use, they\nwould kill us, kill the others people, and what use? Their decision will -- was already made.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: They liquidate the Jewish people in the ge -- in the Wilna ghetto. And we have rumors from\nWarsaw what\u2019s doing there, and my brother-in-law was one of the leaders of the -- of the\nresistant of Warsaw ghetto. And they heard -- being in the ghetto they were killed. They didn\u2019t\nknow exactly how and what. After -- after the war I find out that my sister is still alive.",
        "Q: At this point, where is your mother, and do you have any contact with her?",
        "A: She was still in Rasha at the turf.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: But the last month they brought there from the turf in the ghetto. In the last month she was in\nthe ghetto. But I was still with Josef\u2019s family, that was -- I\u2019ll tell you soon.",
        "Q: And can you talk a little bit more about how you be -- at least became part of the resistance\ngroup? Did -- did you have any meetings, were they secret meetings, how did they train you?",
        "A: Ye-Yeah -- yeah, Ill tell you, I will tell you. I came late to the resistance. [indecipherable]\nend -- we were meeting, five of us, five girls has one leader from the [indecipherable]. And they\nwere -- told us what to do, what we can do. I can\u2019t do too much because I was inside of the\nghetto. I couldn\u2019t bring weapons. But one of our friend, he was a chemist, he was almost of the\nfifth grade of university [indecipherable] and the tel -- taught how to make the cocktail for --",
        "Q: He was a chemist?",
        "A: -- and we\u2019re hi -- yeah -- and we\u2019re hiding and trying to do and once a week before, we also\nwant to resist -- a week? Two days before. And we were gathered in a building of strashunatur.\nAnd in the last minute we heard that the Germans are going to destroy this building. And this\nwas an order fast to go out from the building. And one on our -- -- on our friends has a cocktail\nlamp in his hand, and he running from the [indecipherable] then he fall down and he was killed\nwith his own lamp in his hand.

And we find out -- we find him in the morgue and -- house that he is dead, and we\nrecognize his jacket, he was covered. And then, when everybody went out, they destroy the\nbuilding, a big building. Somehow they find out --",
        "Q: Who -- who destroyed the building? The Germans?",
        "A: The Germans, yeah. But the people went out, he was the only one killed by himself because\nhe fall down with the face on his cocktail lamp, and he was killed, a young, nice boy. And here\nwhere we were up in the -- were the -- one of our leaders came, telling us not to fight. They said\nthrow out whatever you have in the hand on the side, we -- that we did, and go to the middle of\nthe yard. We went to the middle of the yard, and they separate the women from the boys. And we\nwant to go w-with them, and they didn\u2019t allow it, and they took the boys and they took them to a\nplace, and later on they went to Estonia, and with this group went Josef my friend, and I came\nback without him. And you could see that\u2019s the end of the ghetto. And after that they organized\nall kinds of group, promising Gens -- Jacob Gens, that they are going to Estonia for work. What\nthey did, they send the people to Estonia and they work. The -- Josef was in Estonia, also maybe\nfor a year and worked. Then the -- the -- the -- the last day of the war, when they saw that the\nwar is lost, they shot them all and killed. Only a couple was hiding, maybe eight, nine people,\nand they survived. And they shot them all, and they didn\u2019t have enough time to burn them, and\nwhen the Soviet army came, they find the people in the -- and the one who survived saw\neverybody. And there was her father, and because when they liquidated the ghetto --",
        "Q: Luta\u2019s father, and Josef.",
        "A: -- and yes, and Josef. And my father and my -- because they -- when they liquidated the\nghetto, yeah -- and that was three weeks before the liquidation from ghetto. Then nobody went\nout for work, and then some partisans group went out to -- partisan. Maybe a couple of hundred\npeople, yeah. And how did they get out? Jacob Gens was sure that some people, with his\nconnections, with his power with the Germans, he will survive a-at least a couple of thousand\npeople from the ghetto. And he could -- his wife was Lithuanian, his daughter was Lithuanian.\nThey would hide him very, very fast, together with themself. But he believed very strongly that\nsome people with his -- and in the end, you know the end of him? In the end when the people\nfrom the ghetto were survo -- were taken to the place from where they were taken to Estonia.\nYou know where Estonia is that. From there, I even get a letter from Josef. Yes, somehow it -- he\nsend out that. And Gens came there, maybe the -- to -- to see the people. And all the famous\nbosses of the ghetto, like Weiss, like Himmler, and -- from the Germans, who were very close,\ngood friends with Jacob, and they listened to him, and -- also came. And Gens came. And then\nthey want to shot th -- him. And one said I can\u2019t. Weiss said can\u2019t. Himmler said, I can\u2019t shot\nhim. And he said, give me the weapon, I\u2019ll sign -- shot myself. Then came a stranger who knows\nhim very well, and shot him too, and Gens disappeared. But Gens, Gens was a Lithuanian\ngeneral during the war. When the communists came, they were looking for him, they want to\narrest him. I know very well a woman who were a communist, her name was Hannah Borofska.\nAnd Hannah Borofska knows very well Gens. It was before the ghetto, it was th-the -- the\nRussians came over, and the -- and he came to her, asking her, telling her the story, that the\nGermans -- that the Russians want to arrest him, and can she help him, to hide him, and she did.\nAnd she was a communist, one of the leaders of the partisan organizations. And somehow, she\nhas a connection to him, and whatever she ask him something, he did for her. And he know a\n[indecipherable]. If you wou -- wi -- he would be enough wise, he would help, little by little to\ngo out, people in the night to the forest. Thousands of people could -- could, even the time when\nthey got the connection. He let them go out, the last couple of week, the last months before so\nclosed door from the ghetto. And ha -- how did they go out, you know, from -- the last group to\nthe partisans, you know? A friend of mine, his name was Kapinski, and he was -- it was\ndescribed in somewhere -- he was a [indecipherable]. Before the war, he worked with the\ncanalizations from all the -- so he knows the road, through the canalization.",
        "Q: The tunnels?",
        "A: The tunnels.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: From the whole city. When the whole group of 200 people, 220, went through, he was going\nthrough the -- you know, on the street, how so th-th-the round people -- the round places where\nthe people are going to repair the canalization?",
        "Q: The sewer holes.",
        "A: The sewer hole. He went down, and after him the people, and he went with a pump to clean\nup the water, and people went after him until the [indecipherable] of the city. And when the\npeople went through, he push -- he let the water go again. So little by little they went out. And\nthen they divided in two and three and they have the plan how to go to the forest, and they went\nto the forest to find a connection with the partisans. Mi --",
        "Q: I want to go back to -- to Jacob Gens --",
        "A: Yes?",
        "Q: -- because he\u2019s -- he\u2019s an interesting figure --",
        "A: A very interesting figure --",
        "Q: -- as you said, he -- he --",
        "A: -- a very interesting figure.",
        "Q: What -- what did people think about the choice that he made? After all, he was Jewish and he\nwas the head of the Jewish police. So he was the head of the Jewish police in the ghetto.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: When people talked about him --",
        "A: What did they think --",
        "Q: -- did they respect him, or did they -- did they -- were they angry with him?",
        "A: They afraid of him, but --",
        "Q: Afraid?",
        "A: -- he -- for example -- because he helped to organize all the cleanings from the ghetto from\none side, but he didn\u2019t have a choice, I think. Otherwise we were -- otherwise he was killed right\naway and they picked up another one. I'll tell you a story. My sister -- and my family was in\nRasha for turf, but they went out in September when the -- it was very hot. And the winter came,\nand they didn\u2019t have a coat, they didn\u2019t have anything to wear. So my sister picked up -- said, I\u2019 ll\ngo to my neighbors, and I will pick up some clothes. And she went, and she picked up -- they\ngave her something and she came back. Next time, a week later, they didn\u2019t have what to eat, so\nsh -- they -- they sold something of the clothes she bought, and she went to buy something -- the\npeasants, and she went to buy a chicken or something, and other people saw her, and so the\nGestapo -- she was arrested, she was arrested and bring to the prison. And my other sister came\nto the ghetto somehow, hiding, asking what to do. And we went to the Hannah Borofska. And\nHannah Borofska went to Gens asking hi -- her -- because she was a good friend of ours, to pick\nup my sister some, and he did and she was re -- they let her go out, you know, for awhile. Then it\nwas the liquidation of ghetto, before the liquidation of get -- of the ghetto, they bought every --\nall the people from all the [indecipherable] worked with the turf, and the other places to the\nghetto, and they liquidated. When -- and we ha -- and us, me and Luta, they didn\u2019t took with us\nthrough the canalization. And they said it is a big group and we can\u2019t go so many people in one\ntime because we will all [indecipherable]. You are not similar Jews, as Jews, and they gave us --",
        "Q: You are not what?",
        "A: Similar as jew -- you can go like Poles, you think al --",
        "Q: Oh, oh, you don\u2019t look like Jews.",
        "A: -- we are not look like Jews.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: And you can take out your stars, and you have the direction how to go to the forest, and you\ncome by yourself. We were five of us.",
        "Q: They said you were on your own.",
        "A: On our own. But we ge -- they gave us the direction how to go. And the last night, when they\ngather -- when most the older people were out from the ghetto, we still were looking for a place\nto go out, yes, and they s -- they told us attic who were connected with the na -- attic of the\nAryan side, and in that attic was a hole with a door, go out through the hole to the attic on the\nother side, and somehow you will divide it in two, and you will go to the forest by your --\nyourself. We were looking the whole night for the attic. A whole night five of -- I was, and Luta\nand other three girls. Five or six of us.",
        "Q: You were in a building just trying to find this secret door inside?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, in at -- the attic. And it was dark and the attic was very big, and finally we\nfind the -- and one of our girls was very brave and she said, I am running the first -- first, and she\nruns through the hole, and we heard -- heard [indecipherable] somebody was there, they catched\nup the hole, and this girl was catched. We don\u2019t know what happened to her, we never saw her\nagain. And we start to run back [indecipherable]. And we were trying to go out, we couldn\u2019t. So\nwe came back from all the attics to the ghetto street, they were empty. The Ukrainian soldiers\nwere liquidated the Wilna ghetto, and we were trying to find another exit and we couldn\u2019t and we\ndon\u2019t know where we are. We are alone, five girls, and don\u2019t know what to see. And then\nsomehow somebody goes through, and this 1s the last of the police, Aryan -- the yard of the\nJudenrat. So we went to the Judenrat and we [indecipherable] there, and with the last group we\nwent to Rosa where they -- where all the people from the ghetto was there. It was a rainy night\nand a rainy day and they were sitting on a big place on Rosa, and in the dis, and when we c -- in\nthe dirt, and as soon as we came to the -- to the place, right on the corner I saw my family. My\nmother and my two sisters with the little child of three years. And my mother saw me, why are\nyou here? And you are here, why did you come? And I was crying and she was crying, I said,\nwhere is -- and she told me right there, the men were separate right away, my father and my\nbrother-in-law. I said, and -- and -- and sh -- Luta\u2019s father. And I said, \u201cAnd where is Luta\u2019s\nmother with her aunt? Why are you not -- not together?\u201d And she said, \u201cLuta\u2019s mother and the\naunt are sitting down the hill, a little bit below, not far.\u201d I said, \u201cLuta, come, we\u2019ll go to find your\nmom, and you\u2019ll bring here, we\u2019|I be all together.\u201d And we went to find Luta\u2019s mom. And we\nfind them, and all of a sudden was an order to go out everybody, and everybody stand up, and we\nwere going, but the people who were in the first place, next to the exit, they were already throw\nout, and my mother with my sister, with the other sister, with the little three years old child, and\nthey threw them out right away to the left. And we were going through the [indecipherable] so\nthe children were left alone without mothers, and -- and we were going, and Luta\u2019a mother and\nthe aunt was before, and when we came to the exit they pushed them right away to the left, the\nmother and aunt, and me and Luta [indecipherable] to the right. We came, there were maybe 800\n-- 1800 dollars -- people, or 2000 people, young until 20. No children, nobody. A group on the\nright side. And the one who were on the left side were taken to Treblinka, Majdanek. And we\nwere taken to Riga to Kaiserwald. Luta will tell you the [indecipherable] about her mother, and\nthat was the last. Another story I forgot to tell you, when only I came to Rosa, to the place where\nall the people from the liquidation of the ghetto were taken, I saw a little farther a big, tall\nbuilding. And from the roof of the building were three [indecipherable] like they are going to\nhang somebody. Three. We said, what\u2019s this? And all of a sudden, three people from the partisan\norganization of Wilna, the three I was quarreling with them, why are not taking you with us, and\nhe said we are a group people, we are full of weapons, and we can go with a group people. It was\na friend of mine, Asia Bik, Janka Kaplan, and Abrashak Voynich, he was a leader of the Bund.\nAnd all of a sudden I saw that they went on the [indecipherable] and the [indecipherable] around\ntheir head and they were hanged. And the mother of Asia Bik was around, we start to hide in her,\nnot to see. The same day of the liquidation of the ghetto. And all the years I was in the\nconcentration camp, I was thinking, what happened to our old group. Were they all kotched?\nWhy are these kotched, what happened to the other, I didn\u2019t know. When I came back to Wilna\nafter the -- the liberation, I find out that these three people with the weapons, get lost. Instead to\ngo to the left, they went to the right, and they meet a group of Lithuanian and German soldiers\nand they were looking at them, that they start to shot, and it was a fight and they were kotched\nand bought on the face of the whole population of the ghetto, they were hanged. This I found out\nwhen I returned in 1945 from the concentration camp. And the other people, who went the right\nway, they survived, mostly survived. A couple were killed during the -- being in the Holocaust,\nfrom all kinds of people. And the -- the other people survived then.",
        "Q: I-I-In talking to your mother or Josef or your father, ha-ha-had you ever prepared for a day\nlike that, I mean, had you made p-plans, or said good-bye?",
        "A: No, we didn\u2019t [indecipherable]. I will tell you. Luta\u2019s father has connections and they have a\nhouse where the ladies who worked 1n their house for 40 years were still living. They were out\nbut the Polish women, they -- and the engineer came to him and asked the permission to build up\na hiding place in their apartment. And he came to his son, telling him about it. As -- the -- his\nson, Josef, said, no, you have to fight the Germans. In that time we were full of, you know,\nexcitement, we\u2019ll find and we\u2019ll fight, we\u2019ll do this, we\u2019Il do this, we\u2019ll -- we\u2019ll [indecipherable]\nyoung people, they always believe in something. And he said, not -- Iam not going. We have to\nfight the Germans. We\u2019ll go hide, and the other people won\u2019t. And the father said, to save my old\nlife -- old life, my son don\u2019t want. And he said to the person no. The worst thing was that people\ndon\u2019t -- didn\u2019t believe in death. They thought maybe the people are in -- in camps, maybe they\nare working, maybe we\u2019ll survive, maybe we\u2019ll -- we\u2019ll [indecipherable]. Because they were\nlying. They said that -- but this little Luta? She was small and [indecipherable] they are killing\nus, they are killing us. Nobody will survive, nobody will survive.",
        "Q: Did you believe her?",
        "A: I also don\u2019t believe. After -- after especially Josef was taken, I didn't believe that we will\nsurvive. The Germans [indecipherable] won the war with the Jews [indecipherable] survive how\nmany survive. In the camps also was situations when somehow we survived that we could be\nshot. But this is later on, maybe [indecipherable] how about that?",
        "Q: Just a few questions about the ghetto. You had described that there were two. Was there a\nname or a number of one of the ghettos that you were formerly in?",
        "A: One was a big ghetto from once -- one side of Jerma street, and the other was a smaller ghetto\nfrom the other side of Jerma street. It was a [indecipherable]. It was the Jewish center, as I told\nyou, who was empty up in the beginning before the ghetto started. And in their houses they put\nin the people from the whole city. And the other ghetto was existed -- existed for not long,\nmaybe a half a year. In the other ghetto was the big synagogue y -- as a city, very famous, who\nwas built 600 years ago, and there was the Wilna [indecipherable] was started there in the -- lot\nof years ago. And a big writer, Haim Grada describe in his books about this big synagogue, it\nwas like a city. And a lot of people lived there who were destroyed and th-their place, and they --\nas the Germans want to o -- every other month or couple of week, liquidated a lot of people, so it\nwas the easiest way, they said okay, this ghetto 1s liquidated, why the Jews have to have two\nghettos, it\u2019s enough one ghetto. But what should we do with these people? They put them,\neverybody in the wagons and they put them to Ponar and shot them.",
        "Q: Towards the end of the time in the ghetto, h-how is your health? I mean --",
        "A: My --",
        "Q: -- presumably you\u2019re not eating very well, but how -- how -- what is your state of health,\nphysical health?",
        "A: My health was good, and a lot of them helped me that they went out from the ghetto to work\nfor a farm. We worked very hard, but we were at the -- at the [indecipherable] all the time, and at\nthe fresh air, and after that we have vegetables. And we have carrots, and we have beets, and we\nhave this and this, and I told you that the -- the worker of my house bought us every day a little\nbit bread and milk. Mostly I bought it back to the ghetto, but a little piece I took. So sometimes I\nwas afraid to come to the ghetto on the face of everybody who was very pale and very -- I,\npersonally, looked good. But mostly the people were very, very, very pale, or very upset, and ver\n-- didn\u2019t know what to do, get [indecipherable] get -- get lost, you know, a lot of people were left\nalone because a mother or a brother or a father went to work and they were catched up and they\nwere taken away. They thought that\u2019s to a camp, but as we find out later they were shot right\naway, and kids were -- be left without the -- without parents and s -- parents without kids and\nhusbands without wives. I have -- I had a friend, he was in school together with my sister Luba,\nand he worked for the Judenrat. And one time he and an artist from [indecipherable] and\nsomebody else, three of them, get the permission to go out for awhile from the ghetto, outside the\nghetto. And they bought something -- some vegetables, a little piece of bread, and wa -- they\nwent to the ghetto back and the -- at the entrance was Morra, the fuehrer of the ghetto, a German.\nAnd he saw that they have a package with them, and they were arrested, and people were ask\nGens to do something, his wife, to took them out from the prison, but when he came it was too\nlas -- too late. They took them right away to Ponar and they shot -- shot them. And the wife with\nthe little children were staying in the ghetto, lost and didn\u2019t know what to do, and finally they\nwent to Estonia with a group, and they were killed, too.",
        "Q: You talk about people being lost, or people without mothers. Towards the end Josef had been\ntaken, you were separated from your mother, what was your mental state?",
        "A: I was crying, I didn\u2019t know what to do. And after awhile, you know, when you were -- were\nleft alone, you don\u2019t care about yourself, really. What will happen will happen, you\u2019re alone.\nOtherwise you are [indecipherable] from this person, from that person, you get along. What will\nhappen, will happen. And when I was left with Luta, I was yo -- always cared about Luta and she\nabout me. And we were afraid that something can happen, so we tried our best to go through, and\nwe didn\u2019t have a choice. You know, people, when they are healthy, they can kill themself. It was\nnot too many suicide in that time. I was wondering -- it was a little bit, but not much, not many.\nOther people will -- said, my God [indecipherable] why are we living, what for? I\u2019Il commit\nsuicide. But not too many commit suicide, not in the camps, or -- I know a couple of -- I think\nthat Luta\u2019s mother commit suicide in the -- on her way in the -- in the train where they were\ntaking from the left to Treblinka.",
        "Q: S-So -- so what are you suggesting, that maybe people were too much --",
        "A: I don\u2019t know how --",
        "Q: -- in shock to even do anything about it?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know how to explain it, I really don\u2019t. Maybe the will to live is very strong. I don\u2019t\nknow, but people were left for themself. Every person was for themself in that time.",
        "Q: Will you tell a story about what Luta\u2019s tut -- again it\u2019s towards the end and it\u2019s becoming\nclear that you and Luta will be together, and Luta\u2019s father gave you some advice about being\ntogether. Can you tell that story?",
        "A: She -- she -- no, no, she -- where we in the ghetto have to go out to the forest, we were\ndressed like normal people, made up our hair nice, and have nice pocketbook and were prepared\nto go out like Polacks, and maybe we will -- can reach the forest. And before we came to say\ngood-bye to her father and mother. And the father looked at her and he said -- Luta was in that\ntime 15. And he said, \u201cLuta, you are a child, you are left alone.\u201d I said, \u201cShe\u2019s not alone, she\u2019s\nwith me.\u201d And he said, \u201cYou are also a child.\u201d I was 20 in that time -- 19 and a half [inaudible].\nAnd he said, you are also a child. But Luthishka, don\u2019t run without Rochola. Without me. And\nstayed all the time on all our life together, then she get married, I get married, and we still were\nfriends and our husbands were friends.

        "Q: H-How did you know though, who to trust?",
        "A: It was very hard. It was very hard. Some -- sometimes [indecipherable] and sometime\n[indecipherable]. I know a family, no -- were -- we\u2019re connected with them through the marriage,\nand they lived in Lithuanian, and his wife was very energet -- his mother was very energetic and\nshe saved a lot of kids, giving them to the Lithuanian family. And one of them was her little\ndaughter, she was about two or three years. And the little daughter, the Lithuanian family who\nshe knows, took her as a daughter, and the family survived the war. Survived the war, and when\nthe war finished they went to look the Lithuanian people, where their daughter were. Their sister,\nthe daughter left, and they couldn\u2019t find it. As soon as the -- they didn\u2019t have any children, as\nsoon as the German lost the war, they moved and took the girl, and they look for her maybe 20\nyears, and they still not [indecipherable] I was connected through a marriage with them, with the\nbrother of the girl.

        "A: Yes. And they were right away sent to Majdanek, I think, and there they were sent to the gas\nchambers. And I want to tell you, if we -- me and Luta wouldn\u2019t go to look for her mother, what\nit took, five, 10 minutes, we would stay with my parents and we will -- would send also to the\nleft. But were -- in the begin -- in the beginning, all the people were sent to the left, especially\nwhen there was a little child. I remember one person, she has two little children, she was young,\nhad her little children and she has a package on her shoulder with some blankets, or some\nclothes. And she heard right away that with little children, people were sent away. So she empty\nup her bag, and she left only a little blanket, and both of her children, three years and two years,\nshe put into the -- to the bag, put up her shoulders like it\u2019s clothes, and she went through to the\nleft.

There was somebody -- one person left a kid by herself, she -- she want to live.\nAnd she knew that she\u2019Il take the child she\u2019ll be killed together with her. And I can\u2019t say that she\ndid wrong. I was thinking if my sister would leave the child, maybe she would be alive. But you\nknow, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s a terrible situation. You can\u2019t say that she did wrong, that she\u2019s a bad person the\nway she did that, because in that moment, she get like crazy. It was a very terrible thing.",

When you are 18, when you are\n19, when you are 17, as much as you go through, you are still young. And we saw that maybe we\nare going temporary to a camp to work, and we were sure that one of -- on the left side will be\nshot, because they were sick, they were old, they were little children. We were crying, we were --\ndon\u2019t have the right to cry. The Germans would go through and see somebody crying, go to the\nleft.",
        "Q: A-And so, when you went to the right, where did you go? On-onto a train, or trucks?",
        "A: Yeah, we went -- the separation was ready, they put us to truck, very crowded trucks, and\nthey -- they -- we didn\u2019t know where we are going. [indecipherable] was very crowded.

And somehow\nwhen the [indecipherable] when they made the list, I was thinking that there were an action in the\nghetto where they took the children until 16 years, and they took them away for a camp, but they\nso -- shot them. And Luta was 15. I said, Luta, we\u2019re describing us the same age. What will\nhappen to you will happen to me. We\u2019ll make us both 18. Iam 18 and you are 18, and we are\nsisters-in-law. She said why do you want what -- makes o-old? I said, Luta, this is the way I\nwant, and we\u2019re making. And she was 18 and I was 18. After a ye -- not a year, after maybe eight\nmonths, all of a sudden they took the whole party from the rooms to the yard and they start to\ncount us. And they count us, I don\u2019t remember how many people. And all of a sudden they called\nup people before 18 and after 20 -- after 22. If Solanis -- Luta was written her real name, that\nshe\u2019s fo -- 15, in that time she was 16, she was taken out for death. They took them out, and\npeople were very upset. From the room they knocked in the windows, that I am not 20, and I --\nyou know that -- and they were took aga -- somewhere, and next day all their clothes were\nbrought back to the -- they were all shot. If Luta would describe her real age, she would have\nbeen shot. Nothing helped. You couldn\u2019t ask because different people, different soldiers came to\npick up this action. And about, I would say two or 300 people were taken away and shot. After a\ncouple of months they took us to Germany, to Stutthof.",
        "Q: How long were you in the camp in Riga?",
        "A: In Strassenhof I think we were two weeks about, if I remember. In Riga we maybe in 11\nmonths. I have wrote here how long we were in Riga. Strassenhof from October \u201943, prin -- til\nAugust \u201944. In August \u201944 all of a sudden, they came and they said -- because the Russian army\ncame next with -- they took us from Riga to Stutthof, to Germany, when in Wilna already were\nthe Russians, were liberated. The -- Wilna was al -- already liberated, and I remember the\nGerman boss came to us, to our big group and said girls, you are my Jews. In case when the\nRussians come, I put on your clothes and I am a Jew. [indecipherable] he was caught in the end\nand he was shot from these people.",
        "Q: Were there ever any Germans that you came across whether in the ghetto or in the camps that\n-- that -- somebody who helped you perhaps?",
        "A: Not me, not me, but there were. Very little there were. I had, when I -- as soon as the\nGermans came -- as soon as the Germans came, it was in 41, I worked at the German place\nwhere the soldiers were. And I was working in the yard, you know, the cazarnes where the\nsoldiers were during the day and during the night, and they need help to clean the yard, to clean\nthe walls, and they took girls from -- before it was the actions of the pink scheins, he know -- he\nknew about that, that something wrong can happen. And he was so bad th -- a young guy in the\nbrown clothes with the swastika, and he didn\u2019t even allowed us to talk to each other, we were\nfive girls. And all of a sudden he came to me and he said, \u201cLook, do you have a pink schein?\nBecause something will go on in the ghetto.\u201d I said yes. And I was -- I was afraid, why is he\nasking? He\u2019s such a bad person. And I came and I told the other girls what he told to me, what --\nwhat he told me, and they said, oh, we don\u2019t have anything. We are afraid to go to ghetto. What -\n- ask him, maybe they -- he can do something for us. We have neighbors on -- in Zarinyitz, on\nsuch and such street. I said I am afraid. He said, go, ask, we don\u2019t have a choice because we\ndon\u2019t have a place to hide, we don\u2019t have a ra -- a pink schein. And I came to him and I told him.\nYou know what he said? I am okay, but my friends, two girls, they lived somewhere there behind\nthe bridge, and they don\u2019t have anything. And he said, \u201cTell them as soon as they can,\u201d in\nGerman he said, \u201clet them go to the street, let them take off their -- their signs -- their stars, and\nlet them go over the bridge, I will catch them.\u201d Somehow we went with the -- with the group,\nand they find the [indecipherable] that they took out the stuff, and they went to the pavement,\nand they went through the bridge -- [indecipherable] blonde girl. And they were going, all of a\nsudden this guy went through the bridge and took the boys -- girls under the hand, and they said,\ngo wherever you [indecipherable] and I'll go with you. And they came to the street, and he said\ngo and ask if the people will take you, and I will wait for 15 - 20 minutes. If they want to take\nyou, you'll stay. Otherwise you will return and I will took you to the ghetto. And can you\nimagine that the -- that the neighbors let her stay, and he was waiting, waiting. We never saw\nhim again, she never saw it again. What it was, I can\u2019t explain. He was so bad to us if we were\ntalking to each other. Maybe he was 19 years old. She was with the -- with the stick, he was\nhurting us, we were afraid for him. In that moment he saved the girl. She perished another time\nbecause there were lot, lot of time, but 1t happened, a German boy.",
        "Q: During those 11 months that you were there and you were working, just what was your\ngeneral state, what was your frame of mind?",
        "A: We hoped that someday we\u2019ll be liberated. We knew the war is going to be -- to the end.\nSomehow you know -- we were working with Lithuanian people, Lithuanian were guarding us.\nNot Lithuanian, but Latvian people. It was Riga.",
        "Q: And they were telling you things?",
        "A: Sometime. Very little. That the war is going -- th-that the Germans will lose the war.",
        "Q: At this point did you know anything about your mother or your father?",
        "A: [hoped that maybe, maybe, but I had little -- little hope for the people who were s -- were\nsent to the left, because it was a lot of children, a lot of old people, a lot of sick people. Mothers\nwent because of their children, they didn\u2019t want to leave them alone. But still a little hope was\nmaybe. And they return after the war to Lithuania, to Wilna because I hoped that somebody of\nthe family will stay alive, and we said to each other, wherever the war will finish, wherever you\nbe, you return to Wilna, and it\u2019s here we\u2019ll meet. This way, we returned to Wilna and then we\ndidn\u2019t have a place to go back and you know, start to build up their own life how it was.",
        "Q: Did you pray at all when you were in the camp?",
        "A: No, I wasn\u2019t religious.",
        "Q: Were you -- wa -- anything that brought you solace?",
        "A: I thought if God would exist, 1t wouldn\u2019t happen. And if it happened [indecipherable]\nrighteous, it means that there is not God in the world. Maybe I was wrong, but you know.",
        "Q: Can you tell us about th-the switch, a -- I guess it -- you were saying it was August of \u201944, and",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- what was going on, and you were moved to a new -- a new camp.",
        "A: August \u201944, we were working, we came for wor -- from work, and they saw it, they came to\nour room and said, be ready, tomorrow we are going by boat to another camp. We didn\u2019t know\nwhere, we didn\u2019t know what. And we were ready, and we went to Gdansk, Gdansk and they put\nit to a big boat on the bottom. Very crowded. They put up all the [indecipherable]. And we were\ngoing with the ocean -- with the Baltic Ocean. And we were hungry, we didn\u2019t have what to eat,\nit\u2019s so crowded. And I never saw an ocean. And I saw Luta, somehow let us go to the top to see\nthe ocean. I want to see an ocean. I don\u2019t remember how, but we went to the top and we saw the\nocean. And we came back to our place, and we came to Stutthof.",
        "Q: What was the ocean like?",
        "A: Baltic Ocean.",
        "Q: But can you describe seeing it for the first time?",
        "A: You know it\u2019s big. [indecipherable] of water, we saw only water, water without a beach,\nwithout a land, from all the [indecipherable] you know? Interesting [indecipherable] came back,\nand it was so crowded, it was so dirty, it was so [indecipherable] and dark, and people were -- we\ndidn\u2019t know where we are going, to what and to when. And then they brought us to the Stutthof,\nthat terrible camp. And we saw the people like death were going around here and there, and --\nand again sounds that -- and the -- and they was shouting, and ri -- people were -- they lost their\nmind, they -- they -- how can you survive it, fr-from the noise, from the -- I remember they\nbought her to her room, and a crying woman was the [indecipherable] it means the oldest of the -\n- of the rooms we were, it\u2019s a big room, and they make there the per -- a peu.

        "A: Yeah. And we were staying to five -- five people here, next to them another five, next to them\nanother five, next to them another five until the end of the big hall. And all of a sudden they said,\nsit down where you stand. And one were sitting in the feet of the other. One with another, five of\nus. And there were a little empty room, and another group five [indecipherable] they said, sit\ndown. And here how they live. And they gave us a little bowl, and said this 1s for your food. This\nis if you want urinate. This is what -- this what you have. You couldn\u2019t wash it, you couldn\u2019t\nchange it.",
        "Q: You couldn\u2019t wash it?",
        "A: Or you couldn\u2019t change it, there was nothing. That\u2019s all they did. And we were oy -- and Luta\nstart to say here we\u2019ll die, we\u2019ll die from the -- the -- the -- Rochola, Rochola, she said, will we\ndie, will we survive? I said, yes, we'll survive from the war.",
        "Q: Did you believe that?",
        "A: I told her to give her a little bit hope. I didn\u2019t believe it. [inaudible] hope. And then, after\nawhile and we didn\u2019t work, that was the worst. But still there was a washroom with cold water,\nand seldom were of all the people were going to the washroom to wash themself. They didn\u2019t\nhave energy. They didn\u2019t have the -- they were not strong any more. And we went out only from\nthe room for awhile. It was soon winter, we saw big mountains of dead, dead naked bodies\naround the corner of the [inaudible]. We returned. I tried to take a shower every day, as bad as it\nwas, as cold the water as was.",
        "Q: Did Luta --",
        "A: And I took Luta also as -- and she was afraid that it\u2019s the end. And we lived there maybe for a\nmonth or six weeks. It was very terrible, very dirty. And all of a sudden we heard that people\nwere taken to work on farms, somehow. Some people were afraid, but we saw one group went.\nThey picked up some people. And we said to each other, Luta to me and I to her, let\u2019s go, let\u2019s\ntry. And somehow we went out to the group, and we were picked up to go to work to there,\nbecause the German people, the men, they were all taken to the army, to the front, to -- t-t-to\nfight.

        "A: -- they didn\u2019t have. So [indecipherable] people get some people from the camp. And they got\nas five of us, and we went. This may be also changed a little bit our life and helped to survive.\nWe worked very, very hard. We came to a place, and the women were -- was very, very bad. But\nthere was a housekeeping woman, and she cooked for us once a day. In the morning we wake up,\nwe went to the field to -- that\u2019s right, the field, yeah?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: To work. It was very hard to pick up from the earth th-th-th-the -- the carrots and the beets,\nand the -- and the beets for the -- for the calfs, you know, the white one.

And they said terrible\nwords, I said, we don\u2019t know Ukrainian, how can we know what they said, we don\u2019t know. And\nthey were angry, you know, they were not so afraid like me, they were not so tired. And we were\nthere maybe for four months. So we were on the fresh air. They said that the --",
        "Q: So you spent the night there? You lived there?",
        "A: Yeah, they gave us a --",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: -- little room for five people, and once a day they -- th-the housekeeper make the best for the\nfood, that we were not hungry. And on the fresh air and from time to time we can catch a -- a\ncarrot to eat, a -- and we were a little bit strong, yeah. And maybe it saved our lives, but -- later\non. But they also, one of our people, of the girls, they -- she want to go to the bathroom, and it\nwas far away the yard, and it was a little bit too dark, and she went to the bathroom on the yard,\nand all of a sudden, you know who sent a dog to her, and the dog went after her and bite her in\nthe foot, and she start to shout and cry very much. From that time I was afraid for a dog for a\nlong, long time. And then she came to us and we tried to make a disinfection and to help her.\nSuch things happen. And still, when the four or five months finished, the winter came, and they\nse -- they send us back to Stutthof. And this was really a terrible time. But being there in the\nroom by ourself, we wash ourself, we hold ourselves clean, we wasn\u2019t so hungry. But when we\ncame he -- back, and they put us back to Stutthof again, one in each other, where people were\ndying terrible, it was dysenteria, it was typhus, 1t was all kind of sickness. And we went to sleep\nand we wake up in the middle of the night, Luta waked up first, and we were terrible surround\nwith lice. Big, I ma -- the lice were this big. And there were not a -- and Luta start to cry, sta --\nRochola this is our end, this we\u2019ll not survive and we don\u2019t know how to clean up for -- from it.\nAnd we were here a couple of nights, and they sit at -- the girls who came with us start to cry,\nwater, water. We didn\u2019t have the water. After an hour, one is dead. Again another, water, water,\nshe has the same condition as me, she was also working for the -- but she came out and maybe\nthe typhus catched her very badly during a night or two. And people were running and they were\npicked up right away and they disappeared. We were five, we were 10 around, we were eight, we\nare seven, we are [indecipherable]. This is -- we\u2019re sure that the end, we\u2019ll die from the si -- from\nthe sickness for -- during the day where we went to stay for raba -- we\u2019re out, they counted.\nSometimes they count in the room, and sometimes we went out outside. You see there were less\nand less and less, and we saw girls we were so strong and nice and happy at the -- at the farm.\nAll of a sudden they go, and th-th-they have diarrhea and we see the wagon came and put it on\nthe wagon -- wagon and took them to the [indecipherable] and home because there was such a\nplace where they took the sick people and they -- of course they shot them right away. For a little\nwhile we were there, and all of a sudden me and Luta find out that they need people to clean\npotatoes for the -- for the camp. Come, she said, come. And I was so upset, I didn\u2019t have any\nmore energy. But I said we have to go some, we have to do something. We went out and\nsomehow they pick us out a -- pick us up to the place where we are cleaning the potatoes for the\ncamp. And a group of people, all of a sudden -- the worst were the women Nazis. They came,\nthey were so bad. The men also was bad, but -- but not so terrible as the women. And I was\nwondering, how can a women, a women be so bad, but they were. We were cleaning the\npotatoes, a group of maybe 150, or maybe hundred, I don\u2019t remember how all. All of a sudden\nsomebody came, the Germans, and threw the potatoes, wherever it fall, it fall. To your head, to\nour face, or -- who catched it, catched it. One time was such a story. A little girl, she came not\nfar, they bought her from Hungary -- Hungary. [indecipherable]. And she came, and she also\ncame to the potato [indecipherable] but she was -- she was looking well, she was a healthy -- she\nwas not so long in the camps as we. And she was -- and all of a sudden a German, drunk German\ncame, look very good, and they were around, going around, drunk. And all of a sudden he came\nto the girl, and he start to talk to her, and she get [indecipherable] sudden, she was afraid. And all\nof a sudden he gave her a pick and put her on her -- on her knees. Sit -- he sits where she was,\nand put her on her knees. And she did so, you know, frightened. And he start to talk to her, and\nall of a sudden such a n -- Nazi woman came in. And she saw it and she gave her a slap and she\nstart to beat her up. Whore, she start to talk to her, with all the terrible w-words, and she put her\naway. What she do -- did with her, I don\u2019t know, she killed her, she [indecipherable]. And he\nwas laughing.",
        "Q: So at this point you\u2019re peeling potatoes in Stutthof. What -- what --",
        "A: After that.",
        "Q: -- what comes after that, yes.",
        "A: After that, they put it to another place, us, the people who peel the -- in another room, who\nwere from wood making such beds, one after the other, so everyone has his own place to sleep.\nThey gave us better to eat, and we have much better conditions. And after that, after awhile, they\nstart to evacuate the camp of Stutthof. It was January. We didn\u2019t have any clothes, we didn\u2019t\nhave any shoes.",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t have shoes?",
        "A: Yeah, they were rip, the -- you know, was so many years we wearing the same shoes. And\npeople were evacuated. And other people want to go out, they want to be evacuated, too. And I\nsaid to Luta, Luta, I am not going now. The -- it\u2019s very cold, the weather is terrible. We can get\nfrozen on the middle of the -- we were evacuate through the forest, it\u2019s around, around forest.\nAnd I said it\u2019s very dangerous to go. Let\u2019s wait a little bit. She said, no, better to go, I said no, I\nam not going in the end of January. It\u2019s very cold, and we\u2019 ll stay a little bit longer, and we\nstayed.",
        "Q: Alone?",
        "A: No, other people. They took a group, as much as they can take on a -- on a train, and no, not\non train, by foot. They evacuate there by foot, through the forest. A little bit farther, because the -\n- the front. They -- they\u2019re losing the war, and it came nearer and nearer to the place we were.\nBut in the beginning of mar -- March, or in the ever end of the February, when the sun was a\nlittle bit shining, we decided to go. And they evacuated us and brought us to a little camp. And in\nthe little camp, the manager from the camp, the German was the one who was the chief in\nStrassenhoffer, we were in Riga, the same person, and he recognized us. We were there almost\nfor a year, for 11 month. And he start to shout, my Juden, my Juden. Give them the plac -- the\nbest place. And they gave us a room where we were sitting. They gave us from time to time what\nto eat. We didn\u2019t work, we only sit there. And in that time my feet start to be sl -- swollen and\nLuta will start to cry because that we\u2019ll have -- we have dysentery, and we -- you\u2019ll have typhus,\nyou have -- you -- you are dying, you [indecipherable]. I said, don\u2019t cry, I will not die, it will go\naway. And we were there sitting for maybe a week, or what. And then they said -- one evening\nthey came and they with big balls with water, something inside. And they said, you have to take\noff all your clothes. Leave only very little thing to cover the self, and the blanket. And you have\nto put in to make an [indecipherable] it means a disinfection to get rid of lice or something. And\nthere were robes over us, and then you\u2019ll dry it on these rocks there. The clothes. I was in -- I\ndidn\u2019t have a choice, we did it, and we were covered with blankets, and everyone something on\nthem, that\u2019s all. They were all women. Then we dry it out and we put over us. It was in the\nmorning [indecipherable] in the morning. About two o\u2019clock at night they said you have to put\non your clothes, and we are evacuating the camp. But everything was wet. But we didn\u2019t have a\nchoice. We put on the wet o -- clothes, and we surround us with the blankets. And it was a\nterrible night, it was snowing, it\u2019s mar -- it was March, the ninth of March. It was snowing, it\nwas cold, and Luta says I can\u2019t, I can\u2019t go. And I look, she was burning. I said Luthishka, come,\nthe end is soon, the end is -- we will not survive, we will not survive. And we were going\nthrough the forest the whole night, frozen and exhausted and -- and it start to be a little bit light\nat six o\u2019clock, five -- seven o\u2019clock in the morning. No, it was six, 6:30. And there was a little\nlake, and we were very thirsty, we want to drink, and we went to the lake, they allowed us to go\nto the lake, and we were drinking right from the lake the water, and we were going again, again,\nuntil maybe seven, 6:30, and all of a sudden we stopped, and we saw a big barn in the front of us.\nA stall. You know what it is. Where there is the food for the -- for the calfs. A stall.",
        "Q: A barn, mm-hm.",
        "A: A barn. And we were in the end of the group, and the soldiers were [indecipherable] fast, go\nfaster, faster, schnella, schnella, schnella. But the people from before didn\u2019t move, and we don\u2019t\nknow what to do, and we were exhausted, we were weak. And they said farther, farther, farther.\nAnd we couldn't understand, but finally we get in. What happened, in this barn, this stall was full\nof people who went [indecipherable] before, and were living there, and lot of them were with\nfrozen legs and backs, it was crowded, and they don\u2019t want to move, they don\u2019t have what to\nmove, and the new people stepped on their stomachs, on their -- on their feet, on their -- and it\ntook a lot of time until we settled on each other. And we couldn\u2019t fall asleep, maybe somehow\nwe fall asleep we didn\u2019t feel it, and in the morning, usually about nine, 10 o\u2019clock, they used to\nbring us some food. They, not we, we were new. And they saw that nobody bought us anything.\nThen they opened the yard -- they could burn us, I don\u2019t know why they didn\u2019t, cause nobody\u2019s\naround. No sign of kitchen, no sign of food, no sign of -- 0-o-of their soup what they bring. And\nthere were some brave people and it\u2019s -- was far away, the place was called fino. I remember we\nwent through the part and we saw in the little houses it was light, it was nice and we want to go\nin to see how it\u2019s life. And we were [indecipherable]. And these brave three women went to see\nwhat\u2019s doing. And it\u2019s was far away from the road. They went, it was an hour they got back,\nmaybe two, two and a half hour. They came back surround with -- with -- with all kind of\nclothes, and you know? And they said, we are free. Nobody\u2019s around. I -- we went maybe for a\nmile, two, and nobody\u2019s around. All that we see, vacance, with food, with clothes left alone and\nnobody\u2019s there. Then the whole barn, who -- all that could, took their blankets that their clothes\nwere still wet, without hair, and you can\u2019t imagine what it was, and we went all together to the\nroad we went, a mile, two miles. And all of a sudden we saw the sound of tanks, the sound of --\no-of -- of cars, the sound -- and the people like they were going, they went right away to that -- to\nthe tanks where the -- the -- they are going, and they didn\u2019t look at anything, they went in the --\nto the road, and they stopped the whole -- the whole procession of the -- of the military. And I\nwas stand up for awhile, and I said, my God, do I look like all the people? And Luta said me -- is\nvery bad. I have a terrible headache. And she was burning like she -- I don\u2019t know how high up\ntemperature went. I am hungry, I want to lay down. And I was stopped for awhile and I look to\nthe crowd at the people. I thought, yes, maybe we were liberated, but it\u2019s too late. We are all\ncrazy. We are not normal people. Sorry. Other people went to the wagon, they find food and start\nto eat, and they got diarrhea and they were dead right away, after the liberation. And I didn\u2019t\nlook at th-this, any [indecipherable] anything of that because it aren\u2019t interesting, I want a place\nfor Luta to [indecipherable]. And we went to -- to a soldier, an officer, and we ask him, can you\nput us into a house with my sister very sick? And he said come with us, and another 10 people\ncome with us. I remember this, Luta remembered it a little bit different, but I see it like it was.\nAnd we came to a little German house, and an old person, maybe for 90 was along -- around, and\nthe officer, the Russian officer came, \u201cOpen your house and let the people in.

        "Q: So did you stay at the -- at the house and take care of Luta?",
        "A: No. There were more people, she has a good bed, and -- and all of a sudden they came, that\nthe ho -- the hospital that is the same town 1s a hospital and there are lots of sick soldiers, and\nrefugees and there no people to take care of them. And who only could, were go to work there.\nAfter a week I went to work, to the hospital for a couple of hours, and I was taking care of Luta,\nand she was in bed, she was still feeling bad, she was still, but sh-she has a bed. She was in bed,\nshe was -- but she didn\u2019t have any medicine, we didn\u2019t have anything. And I hoped that she\u2019 Il be\nbetter and better and better. She\u2019ll get a little better and then [indecipherable]. And after three\nweeks or a month, the soldiers came and they said that this earth where we are now, has to be\ngiven away to Poland or to German or to ru -- and who wants to return to his homeland, from\nwhere they came, they have to go to the trains, and they\u2019 Il go back to Lithuania, to Russia. And\nas we decided with our family, that we'll meet after the war in Wilna, we tried to go to Wilna.\nOther people were older than we, they wer -- were more -- they thinking a better way. They want\nto go to the other side, not to ru -- to return to Russia. They know what -- knew what Russia was\nand I didn\u2019t knew it. I had a good time there in Russia being a kid. So we decide to go to Wilna,\nmaybe we\u2019ll meet somebody from our friends. And we went through Poland, but I heard that all\nmy family perished during the resistant in Warsaw ghetto. And I was mistaken, only my brother-\nin-law perished. My sister survive, but I didn\u2019t know that. So we went to the wagons to go to\nLithuanian. When we came to the border [indecipherable] soldiers came in and said, who doesn\u2019t\nhave any documents have to go out. We were very tired, Luta was sick, and we were going\ntogether with the Russian soldiers, with Russian officers.

Where we\u2019ll go again to a center that -- for the people [indecipherable] you will come to\nWilna, to your city, you\u2019ll find some friends, and you\u2019ll got your documents. And we listened to\nthat, and we went and we\u2019re hiding. And we didn\u2019t go out to the border, to the centers wer --\nwere gathered the people without document. And we came to Kovno [indecipherable] we came\nto Kovno, we went out. And there were Jewish people, they saw us, because they were liberated\nat -- almost a year ago. 10 year -- 10 months ago. And they saw, oh you came from the camp,\nfrom the camp where -- and I remember that some people were working in a bath house, a place\nwhere people came to wash themself. And they put us there, and they gave us a room there, and\nthey brought us food, and we wash ourself. We were cleaner because we were in the German\nhouse, so we wash ourself, we were cleaner because we were in the German house, so we wash\nourself and we changed our clothes, and so we were not so dirty, we almost have a little bit view\nas -- as people. But still they hair didn\u2019t grow up, for sha -- such a short -- and there we were for\nmaybe a week, and we want to go back to Wilna. We came [indecipherable] rest a little bit whe -\n- and somebody -- somebody from Wilna came, and they gave us a report and they told us about\nthe Shreyber family that they died, and the -- Josef is not alive, my family is not alive. I had a\ncousin who was alive, but he left already for the United States. And so you go to Wilna.\n[indecipherable] we came to -- we wanted to go from Kovno to Wilna, what is an hour and a half\nby train, they didn\u2019t let us. Where is -- are your documents? We said we don\u2019t have documents.\nThen go back to the border where is the center of the people who doesn\u2019t have document. I said,\nwe will not go. And a couple of days we go into the train and they put us out. We were in and\nthey put us out and they take us to the police and the police said, how did you survive? Did you\nwork with the Germans? And I said, my God, I thought that everybody will be happy that some\npeople survive after so many sufferi -- suffering. And then what should we do, how can we come\nto Wilna, that it\u2019s so close that we can\u2019t ha -- here we don\u2019t know anybody, there we\u2019 ll find some\n-- some people who came from the partisans, or who were hiding, we\u2019 ll find them. And then we\ncame to the machinist from the train and we ask him bring us to Wilna. We are coming to the\ntrain and we are throw out again, we are coming again. Is -- the only thing what we can do for\nyou, sit down in the front where the machinery is, not inside, and this way he\u2019ll [indecipherable]\nso we didn\u2019t have a choice, me and Luta, and Luta was se-sent in the front, and we came to\nWilna. We went out for the -- from the train. We didn't recognize each other, we were from the\ncoal -- from the -- we were da -- dark, w-with all the stuff, with all the dust. And we came to\nPonarski Street where Luta used to live, but she -- everybody stranger. We came to a yard, and\nthey came to the f -- second floor. We saw that this was a Jewish family, and we knocked in to\nthe door. And they opened the door, and knocked it back. They saw the people, they get afraid.\nKnocked at the seven -- a second time. I said, please, you don\u2019t want to let us in, bring us some\nwater and a little soap to wash our faces. We came at the train on the top and we get dirty. We\nwant to clean up ourselves to come to the center of the city. So they took out the bowl of water\nwith the little piece -- so they were not -- they were afraid, they were the Jewish people, but they\nwere not fr -- they didn\u2019t understand the situation. They had the normal life maybe for a year.\nAnd maybe they came from Russia, from evacuation. Anyway, they give us the water, and we\nwash ourselves and we wiped out, and -- a little bit. And we went to the center of the -- li -- Luta\ncame to her yard where she lived, everything was wiped out, her house, and she didn\u2019t find\nanybody from people she knew. And we went to the center, and there was a librar -- a Jewish\nlibrary and some offices. And some people came out and they recognized us. And th -- oh\n[indecipherable] some people take us to their house and we were afraid to come in, we were still\nso dirty, we -- we didn\u2019t have anything, we didn't have money and we didn\u2019t know the language\nbecause Russian we don\u2019t know, we learned a little bit. See, Luta knew, but not me. And she was\nvery sick, she was very sick. And somebody took us to their house, and it was clean, it was nice,\nit was white, and we didn\u2019t know where to sit down. You know, we were still dirty. And then a\nfriend of mine who li-lived over [indecipherable] has an apartment, three of them, one -- and\nthey said, oh we\u2019ll clean up a little room for you, and you\u2019 ll come, you\u2019ll live with us.

He took us into his apartment, but Luta was feeling very,\nvery bad. And they find out -- a doctor, not [indecipherable] they came to him and they ask him\nto look at her and he said she has to go to the hospital. And she went into the hospital, she was\nfor three months in the hospital, and they didn't know what\u2019s wrong with her.

And\nthey instead to send -- and after awhile, instead to send them back to Wilna, they send them to\nSiberia. A lot of them. And this girl, her name was -- now she [indecipherable] after the -- after\nthe war she get married. And she went there, and she was working very hard, and she was in the\nforest to cut the trees, and they gave her a little warm jacket, and some big shoes, and the\n[indecipherable] worked very, very hard, and we didn\u2019t have any information. One thing was\ngood, the whole family was killed, and she was alive. And she worked very hard, and in -- it was\nthe -- the patriation from the -- the Polish citizens after the war. I think it was in \u00b047 - \u201948 that\nthey can return to Poland to get their Polish citizenship. She describe herself [indecipherable]\nreturn to Poland and then she went to -- to [indecipherable] or somewhere, and finally she came\nto the United States. When I came to the United States in \u201976, I met her, and she told me all the\nstories. Her family was killed, and she was working the place I am working now, and she\nrecognize me as the friend of her sister. And she said, \u201cYou know what, I have a job for you. If\nyou will be accepted,\u201d she said, \u201cI am working for the Jewish labor committee in New York, and\nI am getting married\u201d -- he -- a second time her husband also died young. \u201cAnd I\u2019Il introduce\nyou, because they need a Jewish secretary.\u201d My English was very poor in that time. And she\nbought me in, and only one person spoke Yiddish, the other spoke English, was a broken\nEnglish. She introduced me to the executive director, it was a [indecipherable] in that time. And\nhe said, okay, if you will take a course of English, if you would take a course of -- of typing. If\nyou would take this and this, come after three months, and she\u2019s working o -- for three months\nyou\u2019re working, and we\u2019ll -- she\u2019Il show you the work, and then we\u2019ll come and we'll see. I did\neverything he said, I took a course of English, I took a course of typing. My Yiddish was -- it\nwas very good years ago, but for the 30 years I was in Russia, I forget also. But I try to\nremember, and I worked very much the job because I was 52, and I still don\u2019t want to be a\nbargain on my children. I want a little bit my own life. And she\u2019s show me a lot, the girl. And\nafter three months I came. Of course my English was very poor, and my typing a letter that I\nsupposed to type now in five minutes, I type in that period of time for an hour. But the Yiddish\nwas Okay. He said we\u2019ll take you to try, three months, and I was trying, but it still was very hard.\nAnd the most horrible thing was for me to take the telephones. I mixed up the names, I -- he\ndictate me an letter, my boss, and I tried to write everything like he said. And when I came for\nhis signature he crossed out one, two, three, four. I said, \u201cWhy are you crossing out? I typed\neverything you said.\u201d He said, \u201cAnd I said I didn\u2019t say, but you are a secretary, you have to make\nthe letter -- letter right.\u2019 Later on, when he gave me a letter, I get friends with some of the other\nsecretaries, who are English secretaries, Linda, please check, make the correction. She made the\ncorrections, I [indecipherable]. Anyway, it was three months and they still didn\u2019t -- we\u2019ll take\nanother three months. I was nervous, will I stay at the job? And the Yiddish start to be a little bit\nless, and nobody knows the Yiddish, only English. Only one person. Finally they -- I think that\nget -- they get used to my personality, and they accepted me. And during the years I learned, and\nthey gave me things that I don\u2019t need too much, the language like traking -- taking track of the\nmembership, or of the federation stuff, who was -- and they picked up, and meantime I learned,\nand I am there for 23 years. Still working, in spite when I came was 18 people at the staff, and\nnow is seven, I am still within the seven, not knowing so well the language. But I doing other\nthings that are enough important and the [indecipherable] were occupied.",

They didn\u2019t let in Polish people to get into the Jewish stores. In the\nuniversity, some Jewish people were in the university, and the students [indecipherable] said the\nPolish people have to sit on their right side in the room, and the Jewish on the left have to sit.\nThe Jewish people never sit on the left, they were staying, listen the lectures, and make the notes,\nstaying.",

And there were no [indecipherable] and the -- a letter was going from there for\nmonths, three or four months. And then when the start -- the war start for us, because my sister\nwas in Warsaw, and I remember my mother was always try -- est -- crying, and people from\nWarsaw run away the first days, and as I said, my sister couldn\u2019t because she was in charge of\nthat school. And people from Warsaw who run away, lived in our house because every family\nwho was able took a couple of the -- of the people who run away [indecipherable] how they call\nhere -- like the people who run from Bosnia now, or from --",
        "A: Refugees. Every family who could took a couple of refugees in their homes. In my home\nwere refugees from Warsaw who knows my sister, and my sister was in Warsaw. We\n[indecipherable] once in three, four months, we got the letter. We send the package, they got it\nafter four months, in the beginning. Other people were not killed, then they was -- it was a\nghetto. And school where my sister works was on the territory of the ghetto, so the nursing\nschool was still going on, and the Jewish people from the ghetto in Warsaw, the young girls have\nstudied. Even the nurses from the school were taken out of the ghetto for work to the hospital,\neven to the German hospital. And -- but -- but from -- for us, for the family it was war, because\nmy mother was alway -- all the time crying about her sisters in Warsaw and their grandchildre --",
        "A: -- about her daughters and the grandchildren, in spite -- in the -- \u201939, in the beginning, before\nthe war start, they were all in Wilna, at our summer house, and when their vacation finished they\nwent -- the sister with the brother-in-laws went to Warsaw, and the children was ver -- left with\nus. It was two children from my one sister, and one boy from the other sister. And with the last\ntrain we send them back with the women to Warsaw, thinking that the safest place would be\nWarsaw because the propaganda was very high in that time, that Poland is very strong, and she\ndoes -- she is not afraid for everybody. S -- so that capital, the Germans will not come. And all of\na sudden, it changed. And the ghetto was smaller, smaller, but people were not killed in that\ntime. We know there was hunger, then there was -- there is no clothes, it was [indecipherable],\nand there were ne -- not enough place for them, but they\u2019re alive. And when the war start, the\nGermans came to Wilna, after the war start with Russia, we thought, okay, it will be like in\nWarsaw. Some people run away, some couldn\u2019t. My family didn\u2019t run away, I don\u2019t know why,\nbut some run away and had to return because Russia didn\u2019t allow it in the beginning, to go in.\nThey thought that we are spies, or what. They still don\u2019t -- and you know -- but we said okay,\nwe'll survive the war, like in Warsaw. In Warsaw they started killing later -- later on. As it start\nto be in all the countries.",
        "A: We couldn\u2019t. We couldn\u2019t. First of all it was a lot of money, and it has to be relatives. You are\nthinking e -- before the war, yes?",
        "A: But you know, it was -- it was complicated, especially from Wilna. Life was not bad there,\nand some people went to the United States, but very little.",

        "A: Before the war, when Hitler came to the power, after years, of course we have stories about\nanti-Semitism there, about -- even, I think, Kristallnacht [indecipherable]. We were ver -- very\nafraid if the Nazis will come, if Germany will come here. And as soon as they hear that the war\nstart, a lot of people run away to Russia. Luta\u2019s family run away to rush -- and they went until\nMinsk, and they didn't allow them to go through the -- through the border. And they returned\nwhen the Germans were there, they returned little by little back to their homes, because they\ncouldn't go through, and then they went through the whole ghetto, and --",
        "A: Hitler?",
        "A: No, no, I could -- I -- I don\u2019t remember what we know. A lot was going on in the -- Germany.\nAnd we saw the situation in Poland like they start to be like Nazis. Not everybody, but especially\nbetween the students, and --",
        "A: Yes, yes, yes, yes. Not the socialist, but they have to choose between the Russia and\nGermany, and they like better the ru -- German. They didn\u2019t expect what will happen, you know?\nThen, when they lost the war right away, the situation changed.",
        "A: But the Polish people were very afraid. They were very scared, because there were several\nsituations that they show -- they hang th-this Pole for hiding a Jew, or -- and they show it on the\nmarket openly, the people saw it --",
        "A: -- and they were afraid, yeah. They were afraid. And then, when the people went to the\nghetto, most of the people didn\u2019t believe that it will be for long. They said a couple weeks and\nthe war will be ended. And all their goods they put to the Polish people, and then they didn't\nwant to give it -- it back. So they were happy, others thought, oh, they were nice people, too.\nAnd I think if we would burn everything what we have, that the people would be nicer to us.\nSecondly, Pll tell you, when the Russians came, the Jews were happy. Ill to -- I told you, they\nthought they\u2019Il have finally their freedom. They\u2019Il can study, they\u2019ll can be like the -- all the\npeople, like it was in the very beginning, in spite that the -- the situation was hard to leave, that\nthey were poorer or whatever. But they had a little bit their freedom in the very fa -- beginning.\nAnd -- and the Poles saw how they were happy with that. And the reality was different. After two\nor three years the politics changed there. Maybe that was the reason. But there were nice people\nalso. I have in our mill, when we went into the ghetto, for seven months or for a year, I worked\non a farm five miles from our home, early before the war. And we have a person who were\nworking in our mill. He was a -- a bachelor and -- and he saw me once that I am going with a\n[indecipherable] on the middle of the street with another 200 people to the farm. For an hour, for\nan hour and a half we march until we came to work, to nine o\u2019clock. This person saw me once\nand all of a sudden I see that he is going with a package behind our -- our group, and he is going\nfor five miles, until they -- they find a situation and they start to go to the end to talk to him. He\nwas afraid, but he gave me the package, bread with a bottle of milk, and disappeared. Every day\nuntil I worked there, this person, a Polish boy who worked for us for a couple of years, did it. I\nwould never expect that this person can be moved. It too --",
        "A: Hi-His name was Mironchik, but I don\u2019t know the last name. I meet him after the war, he was\nstill the same bachelor living wa -- in one of the rooms in our house, poor, of course. I came, I\nsupported him, and then he came to me in the end, maybe a five years because I left, he said, I\nwant to get the -- to get a pension and I can\u2019t get a pension because I don\u2019t have enough years,\nbut I worked for your father for a lot of years, maybe for 10 years, but I don\u2019t have anything\nfrom them. Maybe you can come and tell. And I came and tell. I didn\u2019t want to tell that we were\ncapitalists, that we have a store because [indecipherable] it was not rich, we were very low\nmiddle class because I have a lot of -- you know. But I went and he said, he worked for your\nfather, your father had -- I said, yes, my father in that time was sick and he couldn\u2019t work by\nhimself, and he took this person for -- and I remember him very well. I want very much him to\nget the pension. And -- and I can guarantee that he work for the 10 years, and -- and he believed\nme, and he got the pension. I was happy that I can -- of course I gave him money, I gave what to\nwear after the war when my situation was better. But, that I could do by him this thing, because\nhe was really a simple person, but he was -- he had a heart. Can you imagine that in the ghetto he\nbrought in a half a loaf of bread with a bottle of milk? Maybe it saved the life during the hunger.\nIt was not so easy to get in with it to the ghetto, but somehow I hide it in -- between my pants,\nsomehow came, if I could. If I saw that some Germans had -- staying to the entrance -- to the\nentrance of the ghetto, we can go around on the middle of the [indecipherable] for hours until we\nsaw that it\u2019s cleared up and we can get in to put in the little thing that we have, we worked on a\ngarden, they gave us a little bit carrots and potatoes and -- to put in somehow hide it. And we can\ndo it only if nobody works with -- only was a Jewish policeman at the entrance of the ghetto. So\nI s -- we saw there were Polish -- Polish, were lot of people. Luta will also tell you a story about\nthe people who worked in her house for -- for many years, and how they helped.",
        "A: We are a little --\nEnd of Tape One\nBeginning Tape Two",
        "A: Luta\u2019s name was Sulamit Shrey -- Shreyber. I was in one school with her brother Josef. Her\nbrother was a class higher than me. We were the same age, but he was a class before. In 1939 we\nwere at the summer house in a place called Nemencheny, and there, the place we were, were\nthree houses. In one lived Luta\u2019s family, 1n one was -- in the second was the family of my\nbrother-in-law from Warsaw, and the third house was ours. And in that time, as I told you, the\nchildren and the grandchildren of my mother and her children from Warsaw came and also stay\nwith us at the hou -- summer house.",
        "A: Luba and Riva, but when -- with their husband. Well -- but when their vacation finished and\nthey have to return to Warsaw, the children were staying with us. And we were very friendly\nwith the family of Shreyber, with Luta\u2019s family. And her father was the director of a technical\nschool, and my sister, being in the last year in high school, also took courses in the technical. So\nher father knew very well my sister and my brother-in-law. And we were young people, and they\nwere very friendly with her brother. And she was a little girl in that time. She is five years\nyounger than me, was a very beautiful girl and we all like her, but I was friends with her brother,\nwith Josef. And then the war start, and with the last train we send the children to Warsaw to their\nparent, because my mo-mother believed the children has to be with their parent, and that Warsaw\nwas the safest place in Poland. And then the war starts, and everybody went to their own place,\nand as there were the pact between Molotov and -- and Hitler and Poland was divide, Wilna start\nto be Russia, Lithuanian, and Warsaw was cut off. And then we start a normal life. We were\ngoing back to school in \u201939, and sa -- we very happy with us, as each other, I start to date her\nbrother, and we meet every evening in -- in school. And he was coming to our house, and I was\ngoing to their house, instead what we would live in different corners of the city. And \u201899 was a\nvery happy year, and before 1940, until \u00b041 when the war started in Russia and Germany.",
        "A: Yes. First of all, they took out the property of the rich people. And then everybody start to\nwork, to find something -- work. The ch -- they make changes in the school system, as I told you,\nthis was gymnasium, and al -- they make 10 - 11 classes, and that\u2019s it. Everybody -- everything\nstart to be in Russian, Russian -- Russian was the main language, with a little bit Yiddish,\nbecause it was hard to go through. There was no anti-Semitics, there was -- the people were very\nnice there, one who came in the beginning, but you saw that they were -- they didn't know the --\nthe life that we have before in Poland. The soldiers, everybody who came from Russia, they\nempty out right away all the stores. In the beginning, the owners of the store was happy because\nbefore business wasn\u2019t going so well. And then, all of a sudden people start to buy -- buy\neverything. They bought nightgowns and went to the [indecipherable] in them, and th-the -- the\nwifes of the soldiers, of the officers who came to Wilna. And -- but then they saw that okay,\nthey\u2019re buying everything, but they don\u2019t have where to buy new stuff, to hold the business. So\nthey were a little bit scary. And then, after awhile, they start to pick up the rich people, send to\nSiberia. And they organized the youth to help them, the [indecipherable] and there were a lot of\nJewish people also involved with the [indecipherable] that they didn\u2019t know, they believed them.\nAnd they were very upset. They took them to homes, and told the people to pack -- pack bag,\nthey\u2019re going on -- on the tracks to the trains and they\u2019re going somewhere to rau -- to -- to\nSiberia, to Russia, and -- and people were upset, why, what? But finally it was good for them\nbecause the one they took out, they survive the war, and the one who stayed got killed, mostly.\nMost of them were killed by the Germans. But in -- the time being, it was horrible. People who\nwere not rich, they had a little store maybe, they suffered for surviving with the little store, all of\na sudden they get the [indecipherable] they get -- rich people they have to go out, Capitalists they\nhave to go out of the city. And they send them far away, deep in Russia, and it was very sad.",
        "A: Yes, yes. But they didn\u2019t touch us. We were not enough rich to -- we have the mill, we have\nthe house, but we were -- you know, have a lot of loans to pay, so we have problems. And all of -\n- all of the family start to work -- to work, you know, hard. My sisters, and -- and I was study in\nschool.",
        "A: Yes, until the war started between Russia and Germany when they cut off the schools and\neverything. And I was dating Josef all this time, we were very good friends, and the families\nwere friends.",

And we were study in school, were meeting in school,\nand after school he used to take me home. And then in the evening we meet aga -- again, we\nnever have enough of each other. And we were good friends, and when we came into the ghetto,\nor to the ghetto later -- the first year was quiet, and then I was working in a farm. Before I\nworked in Judenrat, do something, and they want to go out from the ghetto, it\u2019s very hard for to\nstay all the time. And I went to work for a farm and he went to work, to Gestapo. On the ho -- on\nthe yard of Gestapo, doing all kind of cleaning something -- he was very capable, so he did for\nthem in the -- in their workshop something, in the -- I don\u2019t know what. And it start to build up\nin the ghetto, Wilna partisan organization.",
        "A: Before it was organized, it took a little time in the ghetto, and then the youth people of all\norganizations, Zionist, and Bundist and communist, who belongs to the youth organization\n[indecipherable] young people, and religious, and they get together and they start to think how to\nfight, what to do. Not to go like -- they saw the people disappear, disappeared from the ghetto,\nand before the ghetto and they didn\u2019t return. And they start to think about organize something in\nthe ghetto, and whoever works outside the ghetto, wherever they have a situation to bring in\nsome weapons, to -- to have something, in case. And he worked in the [indecipherable] of the\nGestapo, and somehow he had the possibility to take from them something. And he -- it was very\ndangerous I remember, until I saw him again coming from work, from out the ghetto, knowing\nthat he is carrying something. I was very, very scared. And [indecipherable] organization.",
        "A: Yes, the fall \u201941, or the begi -- yes, on the beginning of 42.",
        "A: I will start with the beginning order --",
        "A: -- of the ge -- how it come to the ghetto before. After a -- as soon as the Germans came into\nWilna, they surround themselves with the [indecipherable] of the population. And what do I\nmean? The thieves, the bandits, the -- the one in the -- in every yard has a -- a cleaning person or\nwere -- who were different, some were good and some were bad. But it was the bad people they\nsurround. Because how they knew who is a Jew, and who not. I for example was blonde, and the\nblue eyes in the beginning and who could tell? If the person who saw me or knew me, that was\njust [indecipherable]. After a week they start to catch men on the street. Men -- they ever saw a\nman, and they said he is Jewish, they catched him to a party, and put a party of 150 people, and\nthey disappeared. And they said to take with them a towel and a piece of soap. Later on I\u2019 tell\nyou, I find out after the war for what it was. And people start disap -- the men start disappearing.\nOr they ring in an apartment, if a man opened the door, he may be in slippers, he may be without\na shirt. They gave him a [indecipherable] they came over with three or five people to a door, and\nget him out -- out to the street, and they disappeared. Before that, a week after the Germans came\nin -- five days after they came in, they find out who are the leader -- the Jewish leaders of the si -\n- because what did the population -- what do they know, the whole population? They are living\ntheir normal life and that\u2019s it. But there were leaders who had big positions, who had -- can say a\nword to government about their people, who can stand up from the -- the first thing they came,\nthey picked up 60 famous people and they shot them right away. Was several people of my\nfriends. So there were nobody to tell the world what -- wh-what happened to the Jews, get th-the\nfamous people who -- like famous doctors or famous lawyers, or famous politicians. And there\nwere a lot because this was a big Jewish community. Wilna, who had in that time 400 -- 250\npopulation, 74 of the population were Jewish. It means a third of the population are Jewish\npeople.",
        "A: I knew it, I knew it. Right away people knew.",
        "A: Of course. It was a Dr. Ragovski, and Ailitch and Kaplan Gablanksi, it was famous people in\nthe [indecipherable] who always stand up for the Jewish people and have connections with the\ngovernment. There were even people who were in the same. And they disappeared, they were\nshot. So the population get with less people, and le -- and without leaders. Then, after three\nweeks, it was a rumor that in the Jewish center of the city, there was a Jewish center, a small\nstreets, with big buildings in a yard, maybe with four buildings, not the rich people, were Jewish\npeop -- it the Jewish center. Most of the Jewish people were living there, all the -- the cleaning\npeople were not the Jewish [indecipherable]. And all of a sudden it was a rumor that in that area\na German was shot. And in one night they came in and they cleaned up everybody from the area.\nIt was about six, 7,000 people. And they made it so fast, right from the bat on the street. They\ncould be in the nightgowns, it was out sleeper [indecipherable]. A lot of people came from the\nbandit, from the soldier, Lithuanian, Germans were, and they throw it out the middle of the\nstreet, and when all the area was empty up, they went out and they took them to Ponary. Ponary\nwas a beautiful forest behind Wilna, and they shot them. After a week, they established a ghetto.\nThey were going from all areas of the city, 1t was five boroughs, and going from home to home.\nPut them everybody on the street, and they were driven to the ghetto. For example, into our\nhouse, my father, before that, was taken -- we called them the harponi. They catched, they\nharped mans, and he was taken to such a party with the men, and he was an old man, he was in\nthe -- in that time 67 years old. But my mother, she was very energetic, she was going after them\nand asking, and -- let him go back, let him go back, he\u2019s an old man, what do you want to -- and\nfinally they let him go back. After that, it was establish a camp -- a five miles after our area\nwhere we lived, for turf, work with the turf, you know what\u2019s turf? Turf is earth, and they\nworked it up. And then it was like to heat the ovens like coal, like --",
        "A: Stuff for heating up, it was coal, coal --",
        "A: -- [indecipherable] in English also. And it was establish such a camp, so -- and my father and\nmy brother-in-law was taken to this camp, the -- it was behind [indecipherable] it was called\nRasha. And they were working a lot of people at that, three, 400 people were working on the\ncamp in the Rasha. So when -- when we were driven to the ghetto, my father and my brother-in-\nlaw wasn\u2019t there. But it was as I remember, my sister lived -- has an apartment in our yard, in the\nother building, with a little child of two years. And in our home I was with my mother with\nanother sister. And it was about three o\u2019clock at night, and all of a sudden we heard that\nsomebody is knocking in the door. And seven, eight people; one soldier, one German, one\nLithuanian, some other people, first -- first we have you in 50 minutes you have to go, take\nwhatever you have -- can took in your hand, and go out to the street. We -- the only thing was we\ndid in the 50 minutes, that the best things were put to our neighbors. And my sister took the\nchild, she took the wagon of the child, she put in the wagon whatever and the child and we put\nsome -- it was September, it was hot. We even didn't think about the winter, and we took\nwhatever we had, other things we hide and then some were in the basement, some were\n[indecipherable] and we went out to the street.",
        "A: My mother and my sister would give us our line and our dresses, our winter coats out,\nwhatever we can took from the closet [indecipherable] and to the -- especially to [indecipherable]\nshe wi -- she was living there for 20 years. So then they went -- so we came into the ghetto.",
        "A: We walk. We walked in the middle of the street, the whole part until the end of the street, it\nwas a long street. And they were go -- when I came in, lots of people were staying with the --\ntheir packages, with the children, with the -- waiting until everybody will go out. And then when\nthey empty out all the houses, nobody can be leaved -- left in the house, there were too many.\nAnd we went to the ghetto. And from different boroughs in the same day, they bring the people\nto the ghetto. And we came in, we find -- me and my mother and my sister and my little nephew,\nmy second sister, we came to a yard who my school was. And we find a corner in a little room,\nbecause it was lots, lots of people. And th -- in a room who was one person or a -- maybe 20 - 25\npeople, everybody has a little corner, a little middle to -- to sit down. And after awhile it starts\nthen -- it starts to organize stores, little -- for people to give that -- to have some cards that we\ncan have some bread, some butter. It was organized before, potatoes they give us\n[indecipherable] can be, somehow to survive. And they start to organize groups to go out for\nwork on some places where the soldiers are, on gardens, on some plants, on some -- somewhere\nto work and people went out -- some were working inside the ghetto from the very beginning.\nAfter maybe three weeks in the ghetto, it was Yom Kippur or maybe after a month. All of a\nsudden were rumors in ghetto, that this night the Germans will ke -- come for people. And they\nmake all kinds of lists, and the lists were done in my area where I lived and my sister has a friend\nwho were a Jewish policeman in the ghetto, and he s -- and somehow she find out that I were in\nthe lists. So she said, what should I do? She said, I will cross her out. But better that she will not\nstay at home, because they were ta -- they will take people from this area in ta -- in case they\ndidn\u2019t have enough, they can take from the one who are close [indecipherable]. And I went to my\nboyfriend, to meet Luta. She lived in Shtrashona too -- Shtrashona, I don\u2019t remember exactly the\nnumber, but it was a yard and four big buildings. And in every building, in every apartment, who\nnormally lived a family of three or five, lived 40. in one part. And the Germans came in the\nmiddle of the night, 1t was Yom Kippur, it was raining, it was cold, it was terrible conditions,\npeople were sleeping, everything was going on in the middle of the night. And they didn\u2019t go to\nthe area they promised, they didn't look at a list, they came to one street, where my boyfriend and\nI was hiding and they surrounded two big buildings. In every yard was four big buildings. And\nthey picked up the people and they took them everybo -- I remember they came to my -- to our\napartment and Luta\u2019s father said, should we take some food, so -- some thing, some food. You\nwant you can take, you don\u2019t want you can take, you can take a piece of bread, was strange. And\nthey took us out to the main street of the ghetto, Rudnitska. And Luta, she was all the time out of\nthe ghetto, but this time she came to the ghetto for awhile. She was 13 years old in that time. And\nwe came to Rudnitska, a lot of people were staying already, driven out from the house, and we\nwere staying in the party, and Luta start, she was -- they f -- and the father said, \u201cYou young, you\nwill be taken to work, I don\u2019t know about us, but\u201d -- she said, \u201cNo, we\u2019re -- all will be killed.\nThey are taking us to kill there.\u201d And she start -- and her mother was scared from her shouting\nup. And the mother knew perfect German. And in charge of the whole -- of the whole German,\nthe people who took care of the whole party was in black -- in a black suit with a swastika\n[indecipherable] head with the -- with the --",
        "A: -- all kind of the signs. And she went to him and she says, my husband 1s an engineer, and my\nhusband lives in the Judenrat, let him out, where are you taking us? And he pushed us away. She\nwent a second time to him, let us go, my husband is an engineer, my husband works for the\nJudenrat, my husband did this and my husband [indecipherable]. Let us go home. He pushed us\nagain. She went five times, and the Lithuanian soldier came and gave her a push and she fall\ndown and then she came back to us and she said, 1s nothing I can do, or they don\u2019t listen to me,\nwhat should we do? And we were staying upset, prepared to go with all the [indecipherable]. All\nof a sudden, the German in the black, who was in charge of the whole a -- goes through the older\ngroup of the people, said, \u201cWhere is the frau from Judenrat?\u201d [indecipherable]. \u201cWho is the\nwoman from the Judenrat?\u201d One person came, he said, \u201cNo it\u2019s not you.\u201d Then another person,\nno it\u2019s not you. And we were staying not thinking about anything, and he came, \u201cYou,\u201d to her\nmother. \u201cTake your family and stay next to me.\u201d We took our family, and some other people\ncame like they are the family, and we were staying next to him, and the Lithuanian soldier don\u2019t\nwant us to stay next to him, and they pushed us again. And -- and we tried to stay next to him,\nand they pu -- then th -- he said to them, \u201cLet them -- let them stay, don\u2019t touch them. And he go\nafter me and he went unti -- we went with him until the end of the whole group of people. And\nwe saw that he was counting, one, two, three, four, 900 -- 900 -- 998, and he give a short mark\nwith the hand, go forward with the whole group surround by all the [indecipherable]. And to us\nhe said, \u201cYou can go home, you are saved.\u201d It was maybe five o\u2019clock in the morning, 5:30, it\nwas dark, it was raining, we were wet. And all the soldiers are looking, how come your -- you\nunderstand, the Germans are a very accurate. If they have to take 998 people, they\u2019Il never take\n999. They\u2019 Il take 998 like they were told. And it was a little bit more, and maybe the mother\ncame to his mind that she was bothering him, bothering him, said ah, anyway, some people has\nto be left, let the woman with the family be left. Somehow it came to his mind. No explanation. I\nam sure, instead of us went somebody else, because he needed the amount of the people. So we -\n- and another maybe 10 were left over. They have more as they need. And we came back -- we\ndidn\u2019t go back right away, we went to our basement, we were trembling all, and we were downs\n-- and it was raining very much, we went to the first basement and hide, and everybody was\nlooking at us. And we came back to our place we lived. The light were on, all the apartment were\nempty from the two yards, from the eight big buildings, w-we are the only one who return from\nit. And when we came back in the morning I saw my family, my mother and my sister, with the\nchild of her hand, crying. That they know -- they knew that I went there to sleep over, and they\nknew that people from there were sent to the -- they all were sent to Ponar and Vershat. And after\nthe war when I go -- went to Ponar, I saw the place there was -- they were shot, and they fen --\nfind out who they were because after the war people take out this and they saw this or this\nskeletons, and that. Why, when they picked up the mans on the st -- the man on the street, and\nthe man from the houses, why did they tell them to take a towel and soap? When they bore them\nto Ponary, to the forest where they killed them, they made a big hole, and put a disk over the\nhole. And the people -- the man were a little bit far away. One after the other, and they have to\nbinch their eyes. And one by one they put them to this hole, through -- when they came to the\ndisk, they shot them, and they fall to their hole. In one side or the other where they shot until the\nend, or half alive. Nobody came from there back, you know [indecipherable]. But this -- this way\nthey told them to take a towel and a piece of soap, not to under -- the piece of soap not\nunderstand and the towel to be in their eyes, not to see the last moment of their death. You have\none, I told you that an accident. I could be [indecipherable] what come to his mind, to save this\nwoman with her family, I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: They didn\u2019t --",
        "A: They didn\u2019t know, they said they are taken to a camp for work. They are -- were lying\nterrible, people -- later on people understood, and I\u2019ll tell you a little bit later about it. Otherwise\nit finished. In that time, my mother was hiding somewhere, and they didn\u2019t find her. No, in this\ntime they di -- she didn\u2019t hide, because they picked up the two buildings and this area where my\nmother was, they didn\u2019t -- they didn\u2019t touch anybody from there. But after awhile was another --\nanother story. It went another two months quiet, people were working, people were eating, the\nyoung people were laughing, you know it -- you -- you -- young people, they want to live. There\nwere secret schools where the young people were educated. About Luta\u2019s father she\u2019 ll tell he --\nyou by herself, how he organized a school for students, for people to -- to learn something.\nYoung people they have what to do. And it was so -- everything secretly because th-the Germans\ndidn\u2019t want people to -- to learn, to study, to -- they want only to work, whatever they could, not\nto -- and the Jewish people want to study, they want to learn. They want to like literature and the\n-- them -- organize the [indecipherable]. Th -- they di -- they want to live. But about her father,\nyou\u2019re a -- she will tell you hers-herself. There was another -- another action. We call it action\nwhen there were rumors that the Germans are coming for people. All of a sudden they find out\nthat people who are working have to have pink certificates. And the pink certificates were given\nat the work where the people -- at the working place where the people worked. Like my\nboyfriend worked in Gestapo, he got such a schein. They were -- called it a schein, a pink schein.\nSome people from the ghetto who worked in the ghetto in Judenrat have so -- pink schein. And\nthese pink scheins were [indecipherable]. And the person with a pink schein can des-describe to\nhim a wife and children before 16. My boyfriend jo -- Josef has such a schein, and he want to\ndescribe me as his wife. But we lived together with -- with his cousin, a woman who was more\nthan 30. And then his father ask him, you know what, Rochola is so young, she can go with my\ndaughter of 16, but Dina is old, and she can\u2019t go with my [indecipherable]. Can\u2019t you describe\nDina as your wife? And I will describe Rochola as my daughter, because he also has a pink\nschein from the Judenrat.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: In Yiddish they called me Rochola.",
        "A: Yeah. And then [indecipherable] 17, I was still Rochola, lot of people called me until now\nRochola. My other sister was described to another person as -- as his wife and my other sister\nalso find a guy who describe her as her wife.",
        "A: Y-Yeah -- not -- not that.",
        "A: You know, some people has -- had pink schein and they didn't have anybody, they were\nbachelors, or what. So if they know each other, they describe them as a wife, and went out with\nthem as a wife. My mother didn\u2019t have such a -- and she -- she didn\u2019t have a hiding place, and\nshe was still in the ghetto. And my sister was with her all the time looking, something for her.\nAnd she left her of five minutes, she has to go to somebody, ask if they have for her a hiding\nplace. And my mother saw that she is -- my sister will not leave her alone, and she was\n[indecipherable] what should she do. And she has in her pocket a couple of da -- of rubles, of\nmoney. She said, I have to meet her in five minutes, but I\u2019Il try to go to the exit. Maybe\nsomehow I will go out [indecipherable]. And she went to the exit -- no, I'll tell you about -- later\nhow she went out. My sister returned to the place where my mother has to meet her, my mother\ndidn\u2019t return. She come to there, where is my mo -- I can\u2019t find the mother. And she was crying\nand I was crying and we\u2019re looking for my mother, my mother disappeared. We went to the\nworking place, and to the places where they put us. They put us to the other ghetto, before it was\ntwo ghettos, from one side of the street and from the other, and all of a sudden they liquidated\none ghetto. And they put them to the Ponary. And in that ghetto they liquidated the\n[indecipherable] and the people from the ghetto out, somewhere out to the places where they\u2019re\nworking and some were to the second ghetto wa -- what was empty out, for the couple of days.\nAnd I was wer -- crying. My mother wi -- I didn't know where she 1s, she was killed, she was\nshot, or -- all the three day -- three days we were in the other place. My friend Josef was working\nfor the Gestapo -- the Gestapo [indecipherable] yeah, doing all kind of -- of hard work. And he\nhas a Polish woman who worked in their house for 40 years. And she used to come to him where\nhe worked, every day. And he went out -- we were in the second ghetto, and he went out for the\nw-work every day. And he knew how I was crying and he told Vera, the woman, what happened\nto my mother, and the -- and they don\u2019t know where she is, and Rochola is crying all the time.\nShe said, \u201cYou know what, Ill go to the place where she was living before the war, maybe\nsomehow she went out of here.\u201d She went to the place when -- where I lived, and she find a letter\nfrom my mother, that she gave some money to the policeman and he let her out. She took out her\nstars, and she went out the place to the camp my father and my brother-in-law was all -- almost\nworking at the [indecipherable]. And she went by our house where we lived before, and she --\nshe saw that we will be concerned, and she left a letter that she\u2019s safe and she went to my father.\nAnd this woman, Vera, risk of her life, and she went there -- she went -- and next day she\nbrought my boyfriend Josef the letter from my mother, and he brought it in the second ghetto,\nand telling that my mama is alive and she is together with my father on to -- in the\n[indecipherable]. We returned after awhile to the ghetto to find that lots of, lots of people were\ntaken out. They said that they take that -- took them to work. They said that they -- they are alive.\nBut somehow thoughts came in that people who are alive, they may be surround with the -- with\nthe worst enemies, but somehow one of the thousands, thousands of people can find a connection\nand send something to the relatives, a sign that they are alive. If such signs doesn\u2019t come from\nanybody, it means that they are not alive. But people, they don\u2019t believe in this, they\u2019 ll believe in\nlife. They said, maybe, maybe they are working like we, they are somewhere, they are surround\nby the soldiers, they can\u2019t send anything. And they -- you know, they think that they are killed,\nbut in the underground they said that they are still alive and they can\u2019t believe that people can\nkill people. For what? We were in the ghetto another year, and it was all kind of feelings,\nfeelings. A couple of people worked for a plant somewhere. All of a sudden we heard they didn\u2019t\nreturn from work. They took them out to the yard and shot them, couple of hundred people. A\ncouple of hundred people worked somewhere in Bilavarka around Wilna, also in turf, and they\ndisappeared, they didn\u2019t return home after work to the ghetto, they were killed. They said they\nsend them to another camp, but no, they were killed. One time it were maybe a -- of -- over two\nyears, or a year and three quarters living in the ghetto, there were rumors that all the people from\nthe -- from the shtetla -- from the towns that surround Wilna were bringing to the Wilna ghetto.\nAnd from the Wilna ghetto they are going to Kovno, it was a city in Lithuanian, to build a big\nplant, a big factory. And people came from the -- you know, from the little towns around Wilna\nand they looked good, and they were -- were good dressed yet, and they came with all families,\nwith the old and with the sick and with the little children. They were about four and a half\nthousand people, and they all came to the ghetto. And they made a lot of friends they were study\nin the school, because our gymnasium was the only one in Poland with the Yiddish language,\nwho had right for coming in after finishing to go to the university. So from all Poland, people\nused to come to our school. And some of these people from the shtetla were in school, I knew\nthem and they looked well, because you know, in the little shtetla they are [indecipherable] air is\ngood, and th -- and they were for a week in the ghetto, and -- and they were [indecipherable] and\nwe saw that, and after a week they said that the trains are ready and they are going to Kovno to\nthe -- to view the factory. And everybody was going by themself without things. They are going\nto build a plant. They went to the wagons [indecipherable] with their kids and older people and\nthe -- and the sick and all kind, and when they all get in, they thought that the wagons were\n[indecipherable] they were closed with not to get out. They said why are they bombing the -- the\ntrains? The wagons that we ge -- we are going by ourself. We are told to go and we are going,\nwhy should we be closed? And they were chec -- they were watching, and a lot of people, young\npeople, they know the area. They know how to go to Kovno. And -- and they thought all of a\nsudden they are going to the forest from Ponar. So it was clear of them that they were not going\nto by -- but they were -- are going to shot them. Then they broke the windows of the going train,\nand they start to jump through the windows, whoever could, all over the forest. As soon as the\nGermans and the Nazi they saw it, they start to shot. And the whole forest was shot with dead\npeople. Very little could run out and survive, very little. Mostly they were shot. And the whole\nforest were with the dead, shot people. So tomorrow they came to the ghetto and they told the\nstory, the German. And they asks Gens, Gens was in charge of the ghetto, to give him men to\nclean up the forest. They were afraid to show the other people what they did. So they want the\npeople and they guaranteed Gens. And Gens -- you know who Gens was, yeah, had a big power.\nSo the German. And he guarantee that the people --",
        "A: What?",
        "A: Yeah, Jacob Gens. And they guaranteed that the people who did the work of cleaning up the\nforest will return, that they will not be shot. But [indecipherable] these people were the\n[indecipherable] who were taken to clean up the [indecipherable]. He came back. He promi --\nthat what he promised, he did, the people came back. They were all -- they find a lot of friends.\nThey told them to pick up of the dead people the teeth, the golden teeth, the jewelry, the --\nwhatever they can. If they have good shoes, the shoes, da, da, da. It was terrible, and put into\nthem [indecipherable] dead [indecipherable] half dead [indecipherable] you know. And it was\n4000 people, and to put them to the holes, to put with the -- all kinds of stuff to burn. And when\nthe people came back, some were crazy, they couldn\u2019t [indecipherable] and they told the real\nstory. And that\u2019s what the story is, we find out what is Ponary, and where all the people were\ngone. When I came back from the concentration camp, the first thing I went to was\n[indecipherable] to the Ponary, and I find out all the places where was the this, the -- the man\nwho were, the beginning of the war taken from the city, and this people, and the other people,\nand from [indecipherable] night where we were inside. And the children all of a sudden they\npicked up all the children until 16 years, and they put them in big trucks, and the kids didn\u2019t\nknow, they even were singing on the trucks, they are taking them to a camp for a co -- a couple\nof months. And they took them to Ponary and they sho -- shot them. It helped me out of a -- to\nsave Luta one time. I\u2019 ll tol -- tell you another story when we got to the camp. And that was the\nstory and in the end, and -- and the FPO organization to which I belong to the ef -- I came to the\nFPO much later than my boyfriend. It was very cyclically and they were afraid, they were afraid\nnot only for the Germans, they were afraid for the Jewish population because the Jewish\npopulation were against -- if you fight, they will kill all the ghetto. Otherwise, some will survive.\nAnd everybody was thinking, if somebody will be -- will survive, it will be me. Not another, but\nme. They were thinking with the -- you know, people don\u2019t believe in death, as I told you.",
        "A: Lots of people, yes.",
        "A: It was very terrible. When his cousin -- her cousin came, I had told her the story, and the -- all\nmy friends who I meet two days ago, were shot on such a -- and you know, it was very terrible,\nbut what can we do? What can we -- the [indecipherable] we -- we didn't have a place to hide,\nnobody would take us. Where should we go? And there lo -- then, all of a sudden, and the\n[indecipherable] organization, a couple of hundreds people, we prepared some lamps with -- with\nstuff who can -- who can shut out, you know, in case when the Germans look and we\u2019 ll throw\nwhatever we have in the hands and we\u2019|I fight. It was very hard to get connections with the\npeople from the forest. We were alone. And until we get a connection to take out some people in\nthe forest. It took a lot of time. A lot, a lot of time. And finally people saw that this is nonsense,\nto fight against the German where we don\u2019t have any weapons. When we don\u2019t have military\npeople to rule us. And we\u2019re thinking about the forest [indecipherable] but how? And all of a\nsudden, it was maybe a month before the liquidation of the Wilna ghetto, yes, and we in the\npartisan organization of the ghetto, every night some people were sleeping in the apartments\nwhose window go out -- outside the ghetto, little, little pieces, and they have watch. If they saw\nthat soldiers are surrounding the ghetto, they have to come to their leaders and say the parole\nLisaroft. Lisaroft was the parole of [indecipherable]. I was --",

        "A: -- and we\u2019re hi -- yeah -- and we\u2019re hiding and trying to do and once a week before, we also\nwant to resist -- a week? Two days before. And we were gathered in a building of strashunatur.\nAnd in the last minute we heard that the Germans are going to destroy this building. And this\nwas an order fast to go out from the building. And one on our -- -- on our friends has a cocktail\nlamp in his hand, and he running from the [indecipherable] then he fall down and he was killed\nwith his own lamp in his hand. And then we were -- he was a boyfriend of my close friend. And\nwe went to look him for the -- no, 1t was in the same day that we were on [indecipherable]\nresistant. And we find out -- we find him in the morgue and -- house that he is dead, and we\nrecognize his jacket, he was covered. And then, when everybody went out, they destroy the\nbuilding, a big building. Somehow they find out --",
        "A: The Germans, yeah. But the people went out, he was the only one killed by himself because\nhe fall down with the face on his cocktail lamp, and he was killed, a young, nice boy. And here\nwhere we were up in the -- were the -- one of our leaders came, telling us not to fight. They said\nthrow out whatever you have in the hand on the side, we -- that we did, and go to the middle of\nthe yard. We went to the middle of the yard, and they separate the women from the boys. And we\nwant to go w-with them, and they didn\u2019t allow it, and they took the boys and they took them to a\nplace, and later on they went to Estonia, and with this group went Josef my friend, and I came\nback without him. And you could see that\u2019s the end of the ghetto. And after that they organized\nall kinds of group, promising Gens -- Jacob Gens, that they are going to Estonia for work. What\nthey did, they send the people to Estonia and they work. The -- Josef was in Estonia, also maybe\nfor a year and worked. Then the -- the -- the -- the last day of the war, when they saw that the\nwar is lost, they shot them all and killed. Only a couple was hiding, maybe eight, nine people,\nand they survived. And they shot them all, and they didn\u2019t have enough time to burn them, and\nwhen the Soviet army came, they find the people in the -- and the one who survived saw\neverybody. And there was her father, and because when they liquidated the ghetto --",
        "A: -- and yes, and Josef. And my father and my -- because they -- when they liquidated the\nghetto, yeah -- and that was three weeks before the liquidation from ghetto. Then nobody went\nout for work, and then some partisans group went out to -- partisan. Maybe a couple of hundred\npeople, yeah. And how did they get out? Jacob Gens was sure that some people, with his\nconnections, with his power with the Germans, he will survive a-at least a couple of thousand\npeople from the ghetto. And he could -- his wife was Lithuanian, his daughter was Lithuanian.\nThey would hide him very, very fast, together with themself. But he believed very strongly that\nsome people with his -- and in the end, you know the end of him? In the end when the people\nfrom the ghetto were survo -- were taken to the place from where they were taken to Estonia.\nYou know where Estonia is that. From there, I even get a letter from Josef. Yes, somehow it -- he\nsend out that. And Gens came there, maybe the -- to -- to see the people. And all the famous\nbosses of the ghetto, like Weiss, like Himmler, and -- from the Germans, who were very close,\ngood friends with Jacob, and they listened to him, and -- also came. And Gens came. And then\nthey want to shot th -- him. And one said I can\u2019t. Weiss said can\u2019t. Himmler said, I can\u2019t shot\nhim. And he said, give me the weapon, I\u2019ll sign -- shot myself. Then came a stranger who knows\nhim very well, and shot him too, and Gens disappeared. But Gens, Gens was a Lithuanian\ngeneral during the war. When the communists came, they were looking for him, they want to\narrest him. I know very well a woman who were a communist, her name was Hannah Borofska.\nAnd Hannah Borofska knows very well Gens. It was before the ghetto, it was th-the -- the\nRussians came over, and the -- and he came to her, asking her, telling her the story, that the\nGermans -- that the Russians want to arrest him, and can she help him, to hide him, and she did.\nAnd she was a communist, one of the leaders of the partisan organizations. And somehow, she\nhas a connection to him, and whatever she ask him something, he did for her. And he know a\n[indecipherable]. If you wou -- wi -- he would be enough wise, he would help, little by little to\ngo out, people in the night to the forest. Thousands of people could -- could, even the time when\nthey got the connection. He let them go out, the last couple of week, the last months before so\nclosed door from the ghetto. And ha -- how did they go out, you know, from -- the last group to\nthe partisans, you know? A friend of mine, his name was Kapinski, and he was -- it was\ndescribed in somewhere -- he was a [indecipherable]. Before the war, he worked with the\ncanalizations from all the -- so he knows the road, through the canalization.",
        "A: The tunnels.",
        "A: From the whole city. When the whole group of 200 people, 220, went through, he was going\nthrough the -- you know, on the street, how so th-th-the round people -- the round places where\nthe people are going to repair the canalization?",
        "A: The sewer hole. He went down, and after him the people, and he went with a pump to clean\nup the water, and people went after him until the [indecipherable] of the city. And when the\npeople went through, he push -- he let the water go again. So little by little they went out. And\nthen they divided in two and three and they have the plan how to go to the forest, and they went\nto the forest to find a connection with the partisans. Mi --",

        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: What did they think --",
        "A: They afraid of him, but --",
        "A: -- he -- for example -- because he helped to organize all the cleanings from the ghetto from\none side, but he didn\u2019t have a choice, I think. Otherwise we were -- otherwise he was killed right\naway and they picked up another one. I'll tell you a story. My sister -- and my family was in\nRasha for turf, but they went out in September when the -- it was very hot. And the winter came,\nand they didn\u2019t have a coat, they didn\u2019t have anything to wear. So my sister picked up -- said, I\u2019 ll\ngo to my neighbors, and I will pick up some clothes. And she went, and she picked up -- they\ngave her something and she came back. Next time, a week later, they didn\u2019t have what to eat, so\nsh -- they -- they sold something of the clothes she bought, and she went to buy something -- the\npeasants, and she went to buy a chicken or something, and other people saw her, and so the\nGestapo -- she was arrested, she was arrested and bring to the prison. And my other sister came\nto the ghetto somehow, hiding, asking what to do. And we went to the Hannah Borofska. And\nHannah Borofska went to Gens asking hi -- her -- because she was a good friend of ours, to pick\nup my sister some, and he did and she was re -- they let her go out, you know, for awhile. Then it\nwas the liquidation of ghetto, before the liquidation of get -- of the ghetto, they bought every --\nall the people from all the [indecipherable] worked with the turf, and the other places to the\nghetto, and they liquidated. When -- and we ha -- and us, me and Luta, they didn\u2019t took with us\nthrough the canalization. And they said it is a big group and we can\u2019t go so many people in one\ntime because we will all [indecipherable]. You are not similar Jews, as Jews, and they gave us --",
        "A: Similar as jew -- you can go like Poles, you think al --",
        "A: -- we are not look like Jews.",
        "A: And you can take out your stars, and you have the direction how to go to the forest, and you\ncome by yourself. We were five of us.",
        "A: On our own. But we ge -- they gave us the direction how to go. And the last night, when they\ngather -- when most the older people were out from the ghetto, we still were looking for a place\nto go out, yes, and they s -- they told us attic who were connected with the na -- attic of the\nAryan side, and in that attic was a hole with a door, go out through the hole to the attic on the\nother side, and somehow you will divide it in two, and you will go to the forest by your --\nyourself. We were looking the whole night for the attic. A whole night five of -- I was, and Luta\nand other three girls. Five or six of us.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, yeah, in at -- the attic. And it was dark and the attic was very big, and finally we\nfind the -- and one of our girls was very brave and she said, I am running the first -- first, and she\nruns through the hole, and we heard -- heard [indecipherable] somebody was there, they catched\nup the hole, and this girl was catched. We don\u2019t know what happened to her, we never saw her\nagain. And we start to run back [indecipherable]. And we were trying to go out, we couldn\u2019t. So\nwe came back from all the attics to the ghetto street, they were empty. The Ukrainian soldiers\nwere liquidated the Wilna ghetto, and we were trying to find another exit and we couldn\u2019t and we\ndon\u2019t know where we are. We are alone, five girls, and don\u2019t know what to see. And then\nsomehow somebody goes through, and this 1s the last of the police, Aryan -- the yard of the\nJudenrat. So we went to the Judenrat and we [indecipherable] there, and with the last group we\nwent to Rosa where they -- where all the people from the ghetto was there. It was a rainy night\nand a rainy day and they were sitting on a big place on Rosa, and in the dis, and when we c -- in\nthe dirt, and as soon as we came to the -- to the place, right on the corner I saw my family. My\nmother and my two sisters with the little child of three years. And my mother saw me, why are\nyou here? And you are here, why did you come? And I was crying and she was crying, I said,\nwhere is -- and she told me right there, the men were separate right away, my father and my\nbrother-in-law. I said, and -- and -- and sh -- Luta\u2019s father. And I said, \u201cAnd where is Luta\u2019s\nmother with her aunt? Why are you not -- not together?\u201d And she said, \u201cLuta\u2019s mother and the\naunt are sitting down the hill, a little bit below, not far.\u201d I said, \u201cLuta, come, we\u2019ll go to find your\nmom, and you\u2019ll bring here, we\u2019|I be all together.\u201d And we went to find Luta\u2019s mom. And we\nfind them, and all of a sudden was an order to go out everybody, and everybody stand up, and we\nwere going, but the people who were in the first place, next to the exit, they were already throw\nout, and my mother with my sister, with the other sister, with the little three years old child, and\nthey threw them out right away to the left. And we were going through the [indecipherable] so\nthe children were left alone without mothers, and -- and we were going, and Luta\u2019a mother and\nthe aunt was before, and when we came to the exit they pushed them right away to the left, the\nmother and aunt, and me and Luta [indecipherable] to the right. We came, there were maybe 800\n-- 1800 dollars -- people, or 2000 people, young until 20. No children, nobody. A group on the\nright side. And the one who were on the left side were taken to Treblinka, Majdanek. And we\nwere taken to Riga to Kaiserwald. Luta will tell you the [indecipherable] about her mother, and\nthat was the last. Another story I forgot to tell you, when only I came to Rosa, to the place where\nall the people from the liquidation of the ghetto were taken, I saw a little farther a big, tall\nbuilding. And from the roof of the building were three [indecipherable] like they are going to\nhang somebody. Three. We said, what\u2019s this? And all of a sudden, three people from the partisan\norganization of Wilna, the three I was quarreling with them, why are not taking you with us, and\nhe said we are a group people, we are full of weapons, and we can go with a group people. It was\na friend of mine, Asia Bik, Janka Kaplan, and Abrashak Voynich, he was a leader of the Bund.\nAnd all of a sudden I saw that they went on the [indecipherable] and the [indecipherable] around\ntheir head and they were hanged. And the mother of Asia Bik was around, we start to hide in her,\nnot to see. The same day of the liquidation of the ghetto. And all the years I was in the\nconcentration camp, I was thinking, what happened to our old group. Were they all kotched?\nWhy are these kotched, what happened to the other, I didn\u2019t know. When I came back to Wilna\nafter the -- the liberation, I find out that these three people with the weapons, get lost. Instead to\ngo to the left, they went to the right, and they meet a group of Lithuanian and German soldiers\nand they were looking at them, that they start to shot, and it was a fight and they were kotched\nand bought on the face of the whole population of the ghetto, they were hanged. This I found out\nwhen I returned in 1945 from the concentration camp. And the other people, who went the right\nway, they survived, mostly survived. A couple were killed during the -- being in the Holocaust,\nfrom all kinds of people. And the -- the other people survived then.",
        "A: No, we didn\u2019t [indecipherable]. I will tell you. Luta\u2019s father has connections and they have a\nhouse where the ladies who worked 1n their house for 40 years were still living. They were out\nbut the Polish women, they -- and the engineer came to him and asked the permission to build up\na hiding place in their apartment. And he came to his son, telling him about it. As -- the -- his\nson, Josef, said, no, you have to fight the Germans. In that time we were full of, you know,\nexcitement, we\u2019ll find and we\u2019ll fight, we\u2019ll do this, we\u2019Il do this, we\u2019ll -- we\u2019ll [indecipherable]\nyoung people, they always believe in something. And he said, not -- Iam not going. We have to\nfight the Germans. We\u2019ll go hide, and the other people won\u2019t. And the father said, to save my old\nlife -- old life, my son don\u2019t want. And he said to the person no. The worst thing was that people\ndon\u2019t -- didn\u2019t believe in death. They thought maybe the people are in -- in camps, maybe they\nare working, maybe we\u2019ll survive, maybe we\u2019ll -- we\u2019ll [indecipherable]. Because they were\nlying. They said that -- but this little Luta? She was small and [indecipherable] they are killing\nus, they are killing us. Nobody will survive, nobody will survive.",
        "A: I also don\u2019t believe. After -- after especially Josef was taken, I didn't believe that we will\nsurvive. The Germans [indecipherable] won the war with the Jews [indecipherable] survive how\nmany survive. In the camps also was situations when somehow we survived that we could be\nshot. But this is later on, maybe [indecipherable] how about that?",
        "A: One was a big ghetto from once -- one side of Jerma street, and the other was a smaller ghetto\nfrom the other side of Jerma street. It was a [indecipherable]. It was the Jewish center, as I told\nyou, who was empty up in the beginning before the ghetto started. And in their houses they put\nin the people from the whole city. And the other ghetto was existed -- existed for not long,\nmaybe a half a year. In the other ghetto was the big synagogue y -- as a city, very famous, who\nwas built 600 years ago, and there was the Wilna [indecipherable] was started there in the -- lot\nof years ago. And a big writer, Haim Grada describe in his books about this big synagogue, it\nwas like a city. And a lot of people lived there who were destroyed and th-their place, and they --\nas the Germans want to o -- every other month or couple of week, liquidated a lot of people, so it\nwas the easiest way, they said okay, this ghetto 1s liquidated, why the Jews have to have two\nghettos, it\u2019s enough one ghetto. But what should we do with these people? They put them,\neverybody in the wagons and they put them to Ponar and shot them.",
        "A: My --",
        "A: My health was good, and a lot of them helped me that they went out from the ghetto to work\nfor a farm. We worked very hard, but we were at the -- at the [indecipherable] all the time, and at\nthe fresh air, and after that we have vegetables. And we have carrots, and we have beets, and we\nhave this and this, and I told you that the -- the worker of my house bought us every day a little\nbit bread and milk. Mostly I bought it back to the ghetto, but a little piece I took. So sometimes I\nwas afraid to come to the ghetto on the face of everybody who was very pale and very -- I,\npersonally, looked good. But mostly the people were very, very, very pale, or very upset, and ver\n-- didn\u2019t know what to do, get [indecipherable] get -- get lost, you know, a lot of people were left\nalone because a mother or a brother or a father went to work and they were catched up and they\nwere taken away. They thought that\u2019s to a camp, but as we find out later they were shot right\naway, and kids were -- be left without the -- without parents and s -- parents without kids and\nhusbands without wives. I have -- I had a friend, he was in school together with my sister Luba,\nand he worked for the Judenrat. And one time he and an artist from [indecipherable] and\nsomebody else, three of them, get the permission to go out for awhile from the ghetto, outside the\nghetto. And they bought something -- some vegetables, a little piece of bread, and wa -- they\nwent to the ghetto back and the -- at the entrance was Morra, the fuehrer of the ghetto, a German.\nAnd he saw that they have a package with them, and they were arrested, and people were ask\nGens to do something, his wife, to took them out from the prison, but when he came it was too\nlas -- too late. They took them right away to Ponar and they shot -- shot them. And the wife with\nthe little children were staying in the ghetto, lost and didn\u2019t know what to do, and finally they\nwent to Estonia with a group, and they were killed, too.",
        "A: I was crying, I didn\u2019t know what to do. And after awhile, you know, when you were -- were\nleft alone, you don\u2019t care about yourself, really. What will happen will happen, you\u2019re alone.\nOtherwise you are [indecipherable] from this person, from that person, you get along. What will\nhappen, will happen. And when I was left with Luta, I was yo -- always cared about Luta and she\nabout me. And we were afraid that something can happen, so we tried our best to go through, and\nwe didn\u2019t have a choice. You know, people, when they are healthy, they can kill themself. It was\nnot too many suicide in that time. I was wondering -- it was a little bit, but not much, not many.\nOther people will -- said, my God [indecipherable] why are we living, what for? I\u2019Il commit\nsuicide. But not too many commit suicide, not in the camps, or -- I know a couple of -- I think\nthat Luta\u2019s mother commit suicide in the -- on her way in the -- in the train where they were\ntaking from the left to Treblinka.",

And before we came to say\ngood-bye to her father and mother. And the father looked at her and he said -- Luta was in that\ntime 15.

        "A: -- yeah, like the people marching by. And it went dark, and nobody was around. She went\nagain to the neighbor, and she looked out, she didn\u2019t let her go in, but she gave her a little thing\nto cover her head, and she gave her some food. And she explained to her the way how she can go\nto the forest. And she went to the forest and she reached the forest, and she reached the partisans,\nand she was -- her sister was already in the partisans and she was older, until the end of the war\nwith the partisan.

And one of them was her little\ndaughter, she was about two or three years. And the little daughter, the Lithuanian family who\nshe knows, took her as a daughter, and the family survived the war. Survived the war, and when\nthe war finished they went to look the Lithuanian people, where their daughter were. Their sister,\nthe daughter left, and they couldn\u2019t find it.

It was not too hard to find out,\nthen they find out that one person from this group came before with the other group. Anyway,\nthey find out that the girl Leia came instead of Lola. And Lola has a mother also there. And they\nsaid, why did you come instead of her? They find out that this Lola is disappeared. Anyway, they\ntook her out and together with the mother of Lola, and they took her out somewhere we don\u2019t\nknow, we never saw her again. I heard that they put her to the -- to prove the main roads, because\nsometimes the m -- the roads around Riga, there were main -- mines around, so they took people\nto go on the roads until they fall on a mine and they were killed on the mine.

        "A: Yes, they made the -- it\u2019s not an abortion, it\u2019s a like taking birth, and then they came back to\nthe Strassenhof and they were working. They survive the war, too. A lot of the people who were\nsent to Riga, to Strassenhof, on the left, a lot of them -- I\u2019Il tell you another story. When we came\nto Kaiserwald, before we went to Stutthof, they make -- the Germans make lists of the people\nthey who they sent to Strassenhof. They wrote the name and the last name, where they were\nborn, their age and -- I was staying with Luta, she was 15 years old and I was 19. And somehow\nwhen the [indecipherable] when they made the list, I was thinking that there were an action in the\nghetto where they took the children until 16 years, and they took them away for a camp, but they\nso -- shot them. And Luta was 15. I said, Luta, we\u2019re describing us the same age. What will\nhappen to you will happen to me. We\u2019ll make us both 18. Iam 18 and you are 18, and we are\nsisters-in-law.

After a ye -- not a year, after maybe eight\nmonths, all of a sudden they took the whole party from the rooms to the yard and they start to\ncount us. And they count us, I don\u2019t remember how many people. And all of a sudden they called\nup people before 18 and after 20 -- after 22. If Solanis -- Luta was written her real name, that\nshe\u2019s fo -- 15, in that time she was 16, she was taken out for death. They took them out, and\npeople were very upset. From the room they knocked in the windows, that I am not 20, and I --\nyou know that -- and they were took aga -- somewhere, and next day all their clothes were\nbrought back to the -- they were all shot. If Luta would describe her real age, she would have\nbeen shot. Nothing helped. You couldn\u2019t ask because different people, different soldiers came to\npick up this action. And about, I would say two or 300 people were taken away and shot. After a\ncouple of months they took us to Germany, to Stutthof.",
        "A: In Strassenhof I think we were two weeks about, if I remember. In Riga we maybe in 11\nmonths. I have wrote here how long we were in Riga.

        "A: -- they didn\u2019t have. So [indecipherable] people get some people from the camp. And they got\nas five of us, and we went. This may be also changed a little bit our life and helped to survive.\nWe worked very, very hard. We came to a place, and the women were -- was very, very bad. But\nthere was a housekeeping woman, and she cooked for us once a day. In the morning we wake up,\nwe went to the field to -- that\u2019s right, the field, yeah?",
        "A: To work. It was very hard to pick up from the earth th-th-th-the -- the carrots and the beets,\nand the -- and the beets for the -- for the calfs, you know, the white one. And -- with the hand, we\ndidn't have it -- and she, th-th-th-th-th-the -- the wife of the Nazi was after us, urrr. And they\nbrought Ukrainian people also, the one who were caught from -- I don\u2019t know, from the army or\nfrom what. And they were shouting of the -- with the worst things on the woman --- on the\nwoman, the boss. And she came to us, can you tell me what they said? And they said terrible\nwords, I said, we don\u2019t know Ukrainian, how can we know what they said, we don\u2019t know. And\nthey were angry, you know, they were not so afraid like me, they were not so tired. And we were\nthere maybe for four months. So we were on the fresh air. They said that the --",
        "A: Yeah, they gave us a --",
        "A: -- little room for five people, and once a day they -- th-the housekeeper make the best for the\nfood, that we were not hungry. And on the fresh air and from time to time we can catch a -- a\ncarrot to eat, a -- and we were a little bit strong, yeah. And maybe it saved our lives, but -- later\non. But they also, one of our people, of the girls, they -- she want to go to the bathroom, and it\nwas far away the yard, and it was a little bit too dark, and she went to the bathroom on the yard,\nand all of a sudden, you know who sent a dog to her, and the dog went after her and bite her in\nthe foot, and she start to shout and cry very much. From that time I was afraid for a dog for a\nlong, long time. And then she came to us and we tried to make a disinfection and to help her.\nSuch things happen. And still, when the four or five months finished, the winter came, and they\nse -- they send us back to Stutthof. And this was really a terrible time. But being there in the\nroom by ourself, we wash ourself, we hold ourselves clean, we wasn\u2019t so hungry. But when we\ncame he -- back, and they put us back to Stutthof again, one in each other, where people were\ndying terrible, it was dysenteria, it was typhus, 1t was all kind of sickness. And we went to sleep\nand we wake up in the middle of the night, Luta waked up first, and we were terrible surround\nwith lice. Big, I ma -- the lice were this big. And there were not a -- and Luta start to cry, sta --\nRochola this is our end, this we\u2019ll not survive and we don\u2019t know how to clean up for -- from it.\nAnd we were here a couple of nights, and they sit at -- the girls who came with us start to cry,\nwater, water. We didn\u2019t have the water. After an hour, one is dead. Again another, water, water,\nshe has the same condition as me, she was also working for the -- but she came out and maybe\nthe typhus catched her very badly during a night or two. And people were running and they were\npicked up right away and they disappeared. We were five, we were 10 around, we were eight, we\nare seven, we are [indecipherable]. This is -- we\u2019re sure that the end, we\u2019ll die from the si -- from\nthe sickness for -- during the day where we went to stay for raba -- we\u2019re out, they counted.\nSometimes they count in the room, and sometimes we went out outside. You see there were less\nand less and less, and we saw girls we were so strong and nice and happy at the -- at the farm.\nAll of a sudden they go, and th-th-they have diarrhea and we see the wagon came and put it on\nthe wagon -- wagon and took them to the [indecipherable] and home because there was such a\nplace where they took the sick people and they -- of course they shot them right away. For a little\nwhile we were there, and all of a sudden me and Luta find out that they need people to clean\npotatoes for the -- for the camp. Come, she said, come. And I was so upset, I didn\u2019t have any\nmore energy. But I said we have to go some, we have to do something. We went out and\nsomehow they pick us out a -- pick us up to the place where we are cleaning the potatoes for the\ncamp. And a group of people, all of a sudden -- the worst were the women Nazis. They came,\nthey were so bad. The men also was bad, but -- but not so terrible as the women. And I was\nwondering, how can a women, a women be so bad, but they were. We were cleaning the\npotatoes, a group of maybe 150, or maybe hundred, I don\u2019t remember how all. All of a sudden\nsomebody came, the Germans, and threw the potatoes, wherever it fall, it fall. To your head, to\nour face, or -- who catched it, catched it. One time was such a story. A little girl, she came not\nfar, they bought her from Hungary -- Hungary. [indecipherable]. And she came, and she also\ncame to the potato [indecipherable] but she was -- she was looking well, she was a healthy -- she\nwas not so long in the camps as we. And she was -- and all of a sudden a German, drunk German\ncame, look very good, and they were around, going around, drunk. And all of a sudden he came\nto the girl, and he start to talk to her, and she get [indecipherable] sudden, she was afraid. And all\nof a sudden he gave her a pick and put her on her -- on her knees. Sit -- he sits where she was,\nand put her on her knees. And she did so, you know, frightened. And he start to talk to her, and\nall of a sudden such a n -- Nazi woman came in. And she saw it and she gave her a slap and she\nstart to beat her up. Whore, she start to talk to her, with all the terrible w-words, and she put her\naway. What she do -- did with her, I don\u2019t know, she killed her, she [indecipherable]. And he\nwas laughing.",
        "A: After that.",
        "A: After that, they put it to another place, us, the people who peel the -- in another room, who\nwere from wood making such beds, one after the other, so everyone has his own place to sleep.\nThey gave us better to eat, and we have much better conditions. And after that, after awhile, they\nstart to evacuate the camp of Stutthof. It was January. We didn\u2019t have any clothes, we didn\u2019t\nhave any shoes.",
        "A: Yeah, they were rip, the -- you know, was so many years we wearing the same shoes. And\npeople were evacuated. And other people want to go out, they want to be evacuated, too. And I\nsaid to Luta, Luta, I am not going now. The -- it\u2019s very cold, the weather is terrible. We can get\nfrozen on the middle of the -- we were evacuate through the forest, it\u2019s around, around forest.\nAnd I said it\u2019s very dangerous to go. Let\u2019s wait a little bit. She said, no, better to go, I said no, I\nam not going in the end of January. It\u2019s very cold, and we\u2019 ll stay a little bit longer, and we\nstayed.",
        "A: No, other people. They took a group, as much as they can take on a -- on a train, and no, not\non train, by foot. They evacuate there by foot, through the forest. A little bit farther, because the -\n- the front. They -- they\u2019re losing the war, and it came nearer and nearer to the place we were.\nBut in the beginning of mar -- March, or in the ever end of the February, when the sun was a\nlittle bit shining, we decided to go. And they evacuated us and brought us to a little camp. And in\nthe little camp, the manager from the camp, the German was the one who was the chief in\nStrassenhoffer, we were in Riga, the same person, and he recognized us. We were there almost\nfor a year, for 11 month. And he start to shout, my Juden, my Juden. Give them the plac -- the\nbest place. And they gave us a room where we were sitting. They gave us from time to time what\nto eat. We didn\u2019t work, we only sit there. And in that time my feet start to be sl -- swollen and\nLuta will start to cry because that we\u2019ll have -- we have dysentery, and we -- you\u2019ll have typhus,\nyou have -- you -- you are dying, you [indecipherable]. I said, don\u2019t cry, I will not die, it will go\naway. And we were there sitting for maybe a week, or what. And then they said -- one evening\nthey came and they with big balls with water, something inside. And they said, you have to take\noff all your clothes. Leave only very little thing to cover the self, and the blanket. And you have\nto put in to make an [indecipherable] it means a disinfection to get rid of lice or something. And\nthere were robes over us, and then you\u2019ll dry it on these rocks there. The clothes. I was in -- I\ndidn\u2019t have a choice, we did it, and we were covered with blankets, and everyone something on\nthem, that\u2019s all. They were all women. Then we dry it out and we put over us. It was in the\nmorning [indecipherable] in the morning. About two o\u2019clock at night they said you have to put\non your clothes, and we are evacuating the camp. But everything was wet. But we didn\u2019t have a\nchoice. We put on the wet o -- clothes, and we surround us with the blankets. And it was a\nterrible night, it was snowing, it\u2019s mar -- it was March, the ninth of March. It was snowing, it\nwas cold, and Luta says I can\u2019t, I can\u2019t go. And I look, she was burning. I said Luthishka, come,\nthe end is soon, the end is -- we will not survive, we will not survive. And we were going\nthrough the forest the whole night, frozen and exhausted and -- and it start to be a little bit light\nat six o\u2019clock, five -- seven o\u2019clock in the morning. No, it was six, 6:30. And there was a little\nlake, and we were very thirsty, we want to drink, and we went to the lake, they allowed us to go\nto the lake, and we were drinking right from the lake the water, and we were going again, again,\nuntil maybe seven, 6:30, and all of a sudden we stopped, and we saw a big barn in the front of us.\nA stall. You know what it is. Where there is the food for the -- for the calfs. A stall.",
        "A: A barn. And we were in the end of the group, and the soldiers were [indecipherable] fast, go\nfaster, faster, schnella, schnella, schnella. But the people from before didn\u2019t move, and we don\u2019t\nknow what to do, and we were exhausted, we were weak. And they said farther, farther, farther.\nAnd we couldn't understand, but finally we get in. What happened, in this barn, this stall was full\nof people who went [indecipherable] before, and were living there, and lot of them were with\nfrozen legs and backs, it was crowded, and they don\u2019t want to move, they don\u2019t have what to\nmove, and the new people stepped on their stomachs, on their -- on their feet, on their -- and it\ntook a lot of time until we settled on each other. And we couldn\u2019t fall asleep, maybe somehow\nwe fall asleep we didn\u2019t feel it, and in the morning, usually about nine, 10 o\u2019clock, they used to\nbring us some food. They, not we, we were new. And they saw that nobody bought us anything.\nThen they opened the yard -- they could burn us, I don\u2019t know why they didn\u2019t, cause nobody\u2019s\naround. No sign of kitchen, no sign of food, no sign of -- 0-o-of their soup what they bring. And\nthere were some brave people and it\u2019s -- was far away, the place was called fino. I remember we\nwent through the part and we saw in the little houses it was light, it was nice and we want to go\nin to see how it\u2019s life. And we were [indecipherable]. And these brave three women went to see\nwhat\u2019s doing. And it\u2019s was far away from the road. They went, it was an hour they got back,\nmaybe two, two and a half hour. They came back surround with -- with -- with all kind of\nclothes, and you know? And they said, we are free. Nobody\u2019s around. I -- we went maybe for a\nmile, two, and nobody\u2019s around. All that we see, vacance, with food, with clothes left alone and\nnobody\u2019s there. Then the whole barn, who -- all that could, took their blankets that their clothes\nwere still wet, without hair, and you can\u2019t imagine what it was, and we went all together to the\nroad we went, a mile, two miles. And all of a sudden we saw the sound of tanks, the sound of --\no-of -- of cars, the sound -- and the people like they were going, they went right away to that -- to\nthe tanks where the -- the -- they are going, and they didn\u2019t look at anything, they went in the --\nto the road, and they stopped the whole -- the whole procession of the -- of the military. And I\nwas stand up for awhile, and I said, my God, do I look like all the people? And Luta said me -- is\nvery bad. I have a terrible headache. And she was burning like she -- I don\u2019t know how high up\ntemperature went. I am hungry, I want to lay down. And I was stopped for awhile and I look to\nthe crowd at the people. I thought, yes, maybe we were liberated, but it\u2019s too late. We are all\ncrazy. We are not normal people. Sorry. Other people went to the wagon, they find food and start\nto eat, and they got diarrhea and they were dead right away, after the liberation. And I didn\u2019t\nlook at th-this, any [indecipherable] anything of that because it aren\u2019t interesting, I want a place\nfor Luta to [indecipherable]. And we went to -- to a soldier, an officer, and we ask him, can you\nput us into a house with my sister very sick? And he said come with us, and another 10 people\ncome with us. I remember this, Luta remembered it a little bit different, but I see it like it was.\nAnd we came to a little German house, and an old person, maybe for 90 was along -- around, and\nthe officer, the Russian officer came, \u201cOpen your house and let the people in. What did you do\nfrom people? Look what you do -- did to people.\u201d He opened the house, and we went in to a little\nhouse, clean, nice, the table was served. I think that the Germans served it for breakfast and they\nhad to run right away. With the beautiful beds, with the nice blankets. Like the country, you\nknow, home. And first of all I put her to the bed, she was burning. And then soldiers came in and\na lot of people here and there and this was our liberation. Like a little [indecipherable] first of all\nwe went to have a shower.\nEnd of Tape Four\nBeginning Tape Five",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yeah. That what I told you.",
        "A: I said that it\u2019s too late, because the people how they looked, how they behaved, how we were\nthrown ourself to the tanks, and to the -- not thinking that there is a possibility they couldn\u2019t stop\nright away. But, you know.",
        "A: Pl tell -- Pl tell you. They\u2019re different people, and different Russians, like different people\nall over.",
        "A: No. There were more people, she has a good bed, and -- and all of a sudden they came, that\nthe ho -- the hospital that is the same town 1s a hospital and there are lots of sick soldiers, and\nrefugees and there no people to take care of them. And who only could, were go to work there.\nAfter a week I went to work, to the hospital for a couple of hours, and I was taking care of Luta,\nand she was in bed, she was still feeling bad, she was still, but sh-she has a bed. She was in bed,\nshe was -- but she didn\u2019t have any medicine, we didn\u2019t have anything. And I hoped that she\u2019 Il be\nbetter and better and better. She\u2019ll get a little better and then [indecipherable]. And after three\nweeks or a month, the soldiers came and they said that this earth where we are now, has to be\ngiven away to Poland or to German or to ru -- and who wants to return to his homeland, from\nwhere they came, they have to go to the trains, and they\u2019 Il go back to Lithuania, to Russia. And\nas we decided with our family, that we'll meet after the war in Wilna, we tried to go to Wilna.\nOther people were older than we, they wer -- were more -- they thinking a better way. They want\nto go to the other side, not to ru -- to return to Russia. They know what -- knew what Russia was\nand I didn\u2019t knew it. I had a good time there in Russia being a kid. So we decide to go to Wilna,\nmaybe we\u2019ll meet somebody from our friends. And we went through Poland, but I heard that all\nmy family perished during the resistant in Warsaw ghetto. And I was mistaken, only my brother-\nin-law perished. My sister survive, but I didn\u2019t know that. So we went to the wagons to go to\nLithuanian. When we came to the border [indecipherable] soldiers came in and said, who doesn\u2019t\nhave any documents have to go out. We were very tired, Luta was sick, and we were going\ntogether with the Russian soldiers, with Russian officers. And they said, you know what girls?\nThere in the back are some bags with -- with -- with corn, with some ba -- go behind them. Don\u2019t\ngo out. Where we\u2019ll go again to a center that -- for the people [indecipherable] you will come to\nWilna, to your city, you\u2019ll find some friends, and you\u2019ll got your documents. And we listened to\nthat, and we went and we\u2019re hiding. And we didn\u2019t go out to the border, to the centers wer --\nwere gathered the people without document. And we came to Kovno [indecipherable] we came\nto Kovno, we went out. And there were Jewish people, they saw us, because they were liberated\nat -- almost a year ago. 10 year -- 10 months ago. And they saw, oh you came from the camp,\nfrom the camp where -- and I remember that some people were working in a bath house, a place\nwhere people came to wash themself. And they put us there, and they gave us a room there, and\nthey brought us food, and we wash ourself. We were cleaner because we were in the German\nhouse, so we wash ourself, we were cleaner because we were in the German house, so we wash\nourself and we changed our clothes, and so we were not so dirty, we almost have a little bit view\nas -- as people. But still they hair didn\u2019t grow up, for sha -- such a short -- and there we were for\nmaybe a week, and we want to go back to Wilna. We came [indecipherable] rest a little bit whe -\n- and somebody -- somebody from Wilna came, and they gave us a report and they told us about\nthe Shreyber family that they died, and the -- Josef is not alive, my family is not alive. I had a\ncousin who was alive, but he left already for the United States. And so you go to Wilna.\n[indecipherable] we came to -- we wanted to go from Kovno to Wilna, what is an hour and a half\nby train, they didn\u2019t let us. Where is -- are your documents? We said we don\u2019t have documents.\nThen go back to the border where is the center of the people who doesn\u2019t have document. I said,\nwe will not go. And a couple of days we go into the train and they put us out. We were in and\nthey put us out and they take us to the police and the police said, how did you survive? Did you\nwork with the Germans? And I said, my God, I thought that everybody will be happy that some\npeople survive after so many sufferi -- suffering. And then what should we do, how can we come\nto Wilna, that it\u2019s so close that we can\u2019t ha -- here we don\u2019t know anybody, there we\u2019 ll find some\n-- some people who came from the partisans, or who were hiding, we\u2019 ll find them. And then we\ncame to the machinist from the train and we ask him bring us to Wilna. We are coming to the\ntrain and we are throw out again, we are coming again. Is -- the only thing what we can do for\nyou, sit down in the front where the machinery is, not inside, and this way he\u2019ll [indecipherable]\nso we didn\u2019t have a choice, me and Luta, and Luta was se-sent in the front, and we came to\nWilna. We went out for the -- from the train. We didn't recognize each other, we were from the\ncoal -- from the -- we were da -- dark, w-with all the stuff, with all the dust. And we came to\nPonarski Street where Luta used to live, but she -- everybody stranger. We came to a yard, and\nthey came to the f -- second floor. We saw that this was a Jewish family, and we knocked in to\nthe door. And they opened the door, and knocked it back. They saw the people, they get afraid.\nKnocked at the seven -- a second time. I said, please, you don\u2019t want to let us in, bring us some\nwater and a little soap to wash our faces. We came at the train on the top and we get dirty. We\nwant to clean up ourselves to come to the center of the city. So they took out the bowl of water\nwith the little piece -- so they were not -- they were afraid, they were the Jewish people, but they\nwere not fr -- they didn\u2019t understand the situation. They had the normal life maybe for a year.\nAnd maybe they came from Russia, from evacuation. Anyway, they give us the water, and we\nwash ourselves and we wiped out, and -- a little bit. And we went to the center of the -- li -- Luta\ncame to her yard where she lived, everything was wiped out, her house, and she didn\u2019t find\nanybody from people she knew. And we went to the center, and there was a librar -- a Jewish\nlibrary and some offices. And some people came out and they recognized us. And th -- oh\n[indecipherable] some people take us to their house and we were afraid to come in, we were still\nso dirty, we -- we didn\u2019t have anything, we didn't have money and we didn\u2019t know the language\nbecause Russian we don\u2019t know, we learned a little bit. See, Luta knew, but not me. And she was\nvery sick, she was very sick. And somebody took us to their house, and it was clean, it was nice,\nit was white, and we didn\u2019t know where to sit down. You know, we were still dirty. And then a\nfriend of mine who li-lived over [indecipherable] has an apartment, three of them, one -- and\nthey said, oh we\u2019ll clean up a little room for you, and you\u2019 ll come, you\u2019ll live with us. And they\ncleaned up a little room of ours, she gave me a dress, and Luta a dress, we change a little bit.\nAnd then I heard a brother of my brother-in-law from my second sister, oh -- he find out that we\ncame, and he took us to his apartment. He took us into his apartment, but Luta was feeling very,\nvery bad. And they find out -- a doctor, not [indecipherable] they came to him and they ask him\nto look at her and he said she has to go to the hospital. And she went into the hospital, she was\nfor three months in the hospital, and they didn't know what\u2019s wrong with her. And finally they\nfind out that she has an open cover tuberculosis on her -- and she was maybe for a year in a tute -\n- institute. She was 17 at the time.
