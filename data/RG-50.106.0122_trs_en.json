And I couldn\u2019t do nothing because if I would have\ntried to hit him back or do something like that, I\u2014 I \u2014 probably would have been the\nend of me.",

But everybody lived in peace, we \u2014 my mother had a friend\nacross the street, she was a Hungarian woman, she had two sons, and she would\ncome on Saturdays, turn on the stove for us for Shabbat, because \u2014 and then she did\na lot of things that we weren\u2019t allowed to do. She was so nice, we would give her\nstuff for that, you know, in return. My mother used to be close friends with her, but\nwhen the time came, during the Nazi regime, they \u2014 they were afraid to ta \u2014 even\ntalk to us. They were afraid to say anything because th \u2014 if you \u2014 if we comu \u2014\ncommunicated with it \u2014 with \u2014 with them, with a non-Jew, we probably \u2014 they\nOctober 19, 1993\nprobably would lock them up too, because they were not allowed to do that no\nmore. They were even \u2014 th-the goyim, the non-Jews were afraid to communicate.",

        "Q: So it was really only in what, \u201942, that \u2014",
        "A: \u201942 - \u00b043, something like that. Maybe \u2014 I think Hitler occupied Czechoslo \u2014 part\nof Czechoslovakia in 1941 and I don\u2019t know the \u2014 when the next time he ch \u2014\noccupied. But we had si \u2014 before the Nazis took it over, we had Ukraines took it\nover. There \u2014 there was two or three different groups, they took it over, we had to\nOctober 19, 1993\nlearn different languages. Then the Hungarian took it over and they were \u2014 they\nwere really in charge because they were \u2014 they were working together with \u2014 with\nthe Germans. I remember in \u2014 my father, who we \u2014 we got milk from an lo \u2014 next\ndoor neighbor for many years, and when, in 1943 we weren \u2014 we weren\u2019t allowed\nto do that, but we did 1t anyway because we had to go just to the next door neighbor,\nwho broo \u2014 took off a couple boards from our backyard fence and we went through.\nBut we had, across the street there were two sisters and a brother who lived th \u2014 a-at\n\u2014 at \u2014 and they \u2014 they could see us from the second floor that we were getting milk\nfrom our next door neighbor. They reported my father to the police. They picked up\nmy pro \u2014 the police picked up my father and they took him j \u2014 to jail. M-My mother\nwas hoping that they\u2019re not going to beat him u-up, you know, they\u2019re just going to\ntake him to jail. But after two weeks he came back, he came back with his black\neyes, his whole face was just black. They beat him up all the time and \u2014 and his\nbeard was chopped up to pieces. So that \u2014 that was one and it\u2019s \u2014 it \u2014 it was so many\n\u2014I mean, it\u2019s hard to believe what was going on. These thing you could see, things\nare just coming to a point where people were afraid \u2014 we were, as a Jew was afraid\nif \u2014 they were afraid to go out on the street. Everyone taken, just grabbed from the\nstreet and taken away someplace, you disappeared or \u2014 nobody knew where you le\n\u2014 where \u2014 where \u2014 where you went.\nOctober 19, 1993",
        "Q: When were you required to wear a Jewish star? Was it during that time?",
        "A: Yes, during that time. We \u2014 1943, we had to wear a yellow star or yellow\narmband if we went out to the shopping, or \u2014 or go food shopping or go anyplace,\nwe had to wear that star. Also, in \u2014 I think I\u2019ve \u2014 I\u2019ve mentioned about this trainer\nwho trained Jewish boys, that Nazi would train Jewish boys. We \u2014 we had to \u2014 not\nonly did he kick us for \u2014 when we \u2014 wh-when we went in \u2014 in steps, but he also wi\n\u2014 made us climb a ladder that was about three feet low from the top to get up on the\n\u2014 on top of a barn. We had to climb up there on top and we \u2014 in order to reach it, we\nhad to go pull ourselves up. And order \u2014 1f we came down, we didn\u2019t catch the\nladder, we would step on it and we would just go back down on our back and the\nladder would fall on our back, on stones on the bottom and it was hell.",
        "Q: Was that in school, that \u2014",
        "A: No, that was on th \u2014 on \u2014 on a field \u2014 football field that we \u2014 we had that\ntraining. There was no school in there. That was away from everything.",
        "Q: How come you were part of that group?",
        "A: Because they ti \u2014 picked up all the th \u2014 they got orders, all the Jewish boys from\na certain age, you\u2019ve got \u2014 you gotta come to Leventher(ph) they called it.\nLeventher(ph), Leventher(ph) that \u2014 I don\u2019t know that\u2019s Hungarian.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.\nOctober 19, 1993",
        "A: Yeah. And tha-that\u2019s what they called the \u2014 they asked all the \u2014 those Jewish\nboys should meet at this and this place. So I met them. My brother was already in\nthe la \u2014 at la \u2014 in the labor camp at that time. My father was also in the labor camp\nfor six months.",
        "Q: Tell us about \u2014 about your father and brother being sent to labor camp. When did\nthat happen?",
        "A: That also happened sometimes at the end of fo \u2014 1943. My father was drafted\nfirst t-to the ar \u2014 to the labor army, labor camp, to \u2014 to labor work. Before that he\nserved two or three years, he fought on the battlefields. He had guns and rifles with\nhim, he \u2014 he fought like a soldier.",
        "Q: For who?",
        "A: For \u2014 for the enemy, whoever the enemy was. I don\u2019t know who they fought. I\nwasn\u2019t maybe on the \u2014",
        "Q: On the \u2014 on the side of whom did you fight?",
        "A: I don\u2019t \u2014 I don\u2019t know. I \u2014 tho-those days I don\u2019t know. That wasn\u2019t during the \u2014\nduring the Nazi occupation, no. But that was before sometimes he may have war \u2014\nfought for \u2014 with the Russians or Ukrainians, I have got no idea, but I was too\nyoung to know about that. But what happened is, he fought before he would \u2014 he\nwas \u2014 he was in the army. He got a rifle and ammunition, he fought like a soldier.\nOctober 19, 1993\nBecause he was Jewish, they put him to work cutting down \u2014 they gave him an axe\nand a saw and he was cutting down trees, chopping them up and so on.",

All the family\nwas sitting, my two sisters, three brothers and my parents were all sitting at the\ntable and when my father started to make kiddush, he cried. He said, he would cr \u2014\nhe \u2014 he \u2014 in the middle of the kiddush he broke down and cried. He said these\nwords, he says, who knows whether we will be together again next year. We cried\nwith him, as children, you know, and my \u2014 my older sister tried to c-calm us down,\nbut we cried just like after a funeral. It was a very sad Pesach. The next day we\nwere taken from \u2014 we \u2014 two SS \u2014 Hungarian s \u2014 Nazis came and gave us orders that\nwe have to \u2014 we must be out of the house by \u2014 it was in two hours. That\u2019s \u2014\nsomething like that, or less. They were waiting outside. We packed up everything as\nsoon as we could, you know, and my m \u2014 we wen \u2014 went \u2014 they took us at \u2014 at\ngunpoint, they took us to the ghetto.",
        "Q: And was the ghetto in Chust?",
        "A: Yes, the ghetto was in Chust. They blocked off a few, two or three streets. We\nhad a synagogue in there, we were blocked off, and a tomatorah(ph). And they\npacked in everybody as much as they could without food, water, or toilet facilities. I\nremember I was inside, there wasn\u2019t even an-any room to sit. They selected a few \u2014\nOctober 19, 1993\nth-th-they selected two leaders, two well reputable Jewish leaders in the \u2014 in th \u2014\nfrom the Jewish community to run the \u2014 the ghetto.",

        "A: And they were in charge how to run the ghetto. We \u2014 they selected some running\nboys. They selected running boys for \u2014 to, you know, take messa \u2014 like for instance,\nmine \u2014 my job was, as a running boy, a few running boys, we got passes that we\ncould go out 24 hours a day.",
        "Q: So you were a messenger.",
        "A: A messenger, yeah. My \u2014 my job was, as a messenger, to take messages to the\nsergeant who was in charge. Anything that came in and it went out, he had to sign\nit.

        "Q: Could you tell us about the conditions in the ghetto?",
        "A: Yes. The conditions in the ghetto was, everybody was sitting with a little bundle,\nwhatever they took along, on the floor. Leaning over next to one another, there\nwasn\u2019t even any sitting room in the rooms. And with no water, no toilet facilities,\nonly 1\u2014 what the synagogue had and there was outside one only. Then the rest of it,\nthe food, which was available, we, the messengers got okay from the sergeant that\nwe can go to different Jewish homes and pick up all the good e \u2014 good stuff, like\nthey had stuff in jars, you know, with the \u2014 for the \u2014 for the living. So we picked up\nall that stuff from home, brought it over to the ghetto. That\u2019s only thing that we had\nto eat. Then also, some of the ink \u2014 all \u2014 all \u2014 people in the \u2014 in the ghetto, including\nmy father, beca \u2014 sat down with me and they told me e \u2014 that I am \u2014 I can go out 24\nhours a day, I\u2019ve got the pass. N-Next \u2014 around the corner the \u2014 from the building,\nfrom the synagogue, there is a\u2014 a -\u2014 there was a Jewish store by the go \u2014 non-Jew\ntook it over. And it\u2019s a grocery store and he gets some breads every day, I don\u2019t\nknow how many, 15 - 20 loaf, whatever. If \u2014 they asked me I should ask him if they\nco \u2014 would sell some bread f-for us and we\u2019ll pay the price, there\u2019s no problem for\nmoney. I talked to the \u2014 to owner, he okayed it. I used to get from him six, eight\nOctober 19, 1993\nloaves of breads and I would put them under my jacket on both sides and wait for\nthe \u2014 for the guards to turn their faces away.

        "A: While we worked there we found pots and pans. We found dead \u2014 skeletons,\nolder people and they\u2019re with their beards still on. With the sheitel, some of the\nwomen with the sheitels were hanging next \u2014 were right next to them and they\u2019re\njust like you \u2014 they just took it off. We \u2014 once we found six skeletons, young\nchildren huddled together. We \u2014 there \u2014 it was so unbelievable that they were \u2014 it\ncould have been a family, although some of these children tried to survive, they\nheld together for their \u2014 during the bombing or they just starved like that. They \u2014\nthey \u2014 I remember we used to take off their shinbones and \u2014 and we used to guess\nhow old these children were. I\u2019ve got now a grandson, and you know, ke-keep on\nlooking at his shinbone here \u2014 about a year and a half old \u2014 and I keep on looking at\nthe shinbones and I said, my God, th-that-that \u2014 that\u2019s pretty close what I\u2019ve seen\nOctober 19, 1993\nwhen we \u2014 th-there must have been some \u2014 sometimes about a year or so, all those\nkids. And we used to \u2014 one day at work \u2014",
        "Q: What sort of work did you do apart from just cleaning the \u2014",
        "A: Cleaning the bricks and \u2014 and moving dirt. Dump \u2014 pour \u2014 throwing it from one\nprisoner to another, to a \u2014 to a cart that the ge \u2014 Polish people came in and took it to\nthe railroad. And we would throw it down from the top of \u2014 of a hill, like from the\nbombed parts, maybe make a \u2014 a chain and we throw it one \u2014 for one another, til it\ngo-got to the cart, to \u2014 with the horse and buggy, yeah.",

        "A: You\u2019re not \u2014 you wouldn\u2019t allowed to have \u2014 be a leader, because the minute\nthey heard you were a leader, you were dead. We did it between ourselves. We\ntalked our language, sometimes Hebrew, the different words so they don\u2019t\nunderstand, like orlay(ph). We \u2014 the \u2014 somebody \u2014 the kapo would come or \u2014 or\nsome SS, we \u2014 it\u2019s orlay(ph) orlay(ph) orlay(ph), that means keep on moving,\nmoving, you know, or \u2014 or some other words we used to use, I forgot already.

        "A: In the ghetto?",
        "Q: A typical day, yeah, what time did you get up in the morning?",
        "A: Oh yeah, w-we got up in the m \u2014 in the morning we used to get up around 4:30.\nWe have black coffee and a piece of bread, cornbread and we marched through the\n\u2014 most of the time we marched through the forest so nobody could see us. And we\ncame \u2014 we came \u2014 it took us about a half an hour to get to march there, to \u2014 to the\nbomb ghetto. Once we were there, everybody was at sh \u2014 working 1n different th-\nthings. There were so many things going on that \u2014\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "Q: \u2014 that you would get up at four in the morning and he came into the workplace.",
        "A: That\u2019s right, yeah. And once on the way going to work, we wo \u2014 sometimes,\nonce or twice a week, we would see German trucks loaded with partisans. How we\nknew they were partisans, while we were marching si \u2014 the back cover opened up\nfrom the wind, it would just open up, I could see them. They were blindfolded with\nblack rags, their eyes and tied up in the back. I remember seeing some of the faces,\nyou know, turning; they heard the marching, you know, the noises from marching.\nThey turned towards us, and I said to myself, God, I wish, oh, I wish I could help\nOctober 19, 1993\nyou. I don\u2019t know \u2014 I \u2014 I \u2014I \u2014I felt so bad. I wish I could have gone over and just\nblown out the whole thing with them so th-they wouldn\u2019t take them. And then they\nwould take them to \u2014 to the \u2014 to a place which was right in our \u2014 on the ou-outside\nof the \u2014 from our camp where we \u2014 where w \u2014 and \u2014 and there was a\nslaughterhouse. They put up a cement block outsi \u2014 you know, it\u2019s \u2014 was outside,\nbut a\u2014a wall, four walls. And they would take in those prisoners, I mean, the\npartisans, shoot them out. In the evening you\u2019d hear the machine guns going for 10\n- 15 minutes. They \u2014 they wou \u2014 in fact, when we used to \u2014 sometimes when it\nrained and the ground was wet, and we walked in their direction, my wooden shoes\nhad a line, like red \u2014 red ink \u2014 red \u2014 red \u2014 red paint, but it was blood. The blood was\n\u2014 was soaked over the ground in there, they used to kill so many of them.",
        "Q: And you were taken at four in the morning to work and then \u2014",
        "A: We quit around f\u2014 when \u2014 later in the evening, about eight, 10 hours sometimes.\nIt depends \u2014 I forgot already, but I know usually eight, 10 hours a day we\n[indecipherable]. When it start to get dark, we w \u2014 took off, all the time.",
        "Q: Were you given some food at lunchtime?",
        "A: No. No food.",
        "Q: Only breakfast?\nOctober 19, 1993",
        "A: No, only bre \u2014 wa \u2014 only thing you took along with you, if you had a piece of\nbread \u2014 I remember I used to take along a piece of bread in my pocket, sew it in\nbecause there was no pockets and save it. When I was ready to \u2014 to faint from\nhunger, I would take a little crumb and put it on my tongue and just keep on sucking\non it to keep me alive. And you know, one day, there was one a \u2014 one interesting 1-\ni-incident. I \u2014 I was walking, you know, I was like in an \u2014 in an area where I \u2014 I was\ndigging up bricks to be cleaned up. And all of a sudden I got hit on my ankle with a\npiece of brick. And I turned around \u2014 that hurted \u2014 I turned around and I look\naround, I didn\u2019t see nobody. I said oh, forget it, maybe somebody just in a joke did\nsomething. Then suddenly I see little pebbles flying around me and I got hit again in\nmy foot, a little higher. I turned around, I said to myself, oh boy, that \u2014 I got to find\nout who that is. I turned around and I see somebody sticking \u2014 somebody was\nsticking out the \u2014 the head from under the rubble, just enough to see his head. He\nhad black hair on and he was pointing with his finger to \u2014 to follow him, to ca \u2014 to\ngo \u2014 to escape. Now, I made two steps and I suddenly jumped back, I said to\nmyself, oh my God, I remember I got beaten up by a \u2014 the lead pipe. I cannot take\nthat pain no more. I\u2019m still hurting from it, I\u2019m still in pain. And I didn \u2014 wouldn\u2019t\ngo, but he was trying to ma \u2014 make me escape. A lot of the prisoners escaped.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.\nOctober 19, 1993",
        "A: But tha \u2014 tha \u2014 they escape and probably they caught them, because they kept on\nkilling them all the time. Yes, so then, from there I had the \u2014 the Russians started t-\nto \u2014 we \u2014 di\u2014 oh yeah, you used to get so many of the partisans, so many captured\nof the partisans that they decided to build a crematorium, a small one. First we\nthought it\u2019s going to be a bakery. We were waiting and waiting, we were asking \u2014 I\nknow the people who bou \u2014 built it were Katz(ph), they lived in my city. A young\nson and a fath \u2014 it\u2019s a father and son. We\u2019re waiting for it to be finished, and here \u2014\neverybody\u2019s talking a bakery, a bakery, what else could it be? He finally was\nfinished and it was a \u2014 before we were supposed to be liquidating the camp, and w-\nwe found out it was a small crematorium. It looked like a \u2014 a bakery. They killed\nthe father and son first, they bur-burned them, they were the first ones to burn. We,\nat two \u2014 two days later the commanding officer told us that we\u2019re going to go \u2014\nwe're going to liquidate the camp, and \u2014",
        "Q: Do you remember the name of the commander of that camp?",
        "A: No, no, I cannot remember. My head were blank after that, I got hit with a lead\npipe and I had \u2014 from hunger and thirst we were just \u2014 you couldn\u2019t think straight.\nOkay, where was I?",
        "Q: Yeah, before you had to liquidate the camp.\nOctober 19, 1993",
        "A: Oh yeah, before we \u2014 before we \u2014 yeah, he \u2014 the \u2014 th-the commanding officer\ntold us that we\u2019re going to liquidate the camp next day. The next day came, they\nasked all those prisoners who cannot walk will go by truck, about a hundred of\nthem, moved out, they marched them straight to the slaughterhouse, and we \u2014 while\nwe were standing in role call, they were \u2014 we could hear the machine guns going\nthat killed them all. They hung six prisoners on wooden poles, and they\u2019d sa \u2014 th-\nthe commanding officer said, the reason why they\u2019re \u2014 that we hung them is\nbecause they de \u2014 tried to escape yesterday. We found out this \u2014 this is go \u2014 going\nto be a\u2014 called Warsaw death march.",
        "Q: What \u2014 when was the \u2014 I mean, how long \u2014",
        "A: In aug \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 were you in the \u2014 in the \u2014 in Warsaw?",
        "A: I-In August 1\u2014 we started out in August sometimes, that 1\u2014 one thing I \u2014 I will \u2014\nsomehow somebody told us that, one of the SS, what month it is in. August \u2014\nsometimes beginning of August. It was boiling hot outside, the sun was baking us.",
        "Q: So [indecipherable] 1944.",
        "A: 1944. That\u2019s go \u2014",

        "Q: Right.",
        "A: We marched day and night without food or water. Our lips were black like coal\nfrom the hydra \u2014",
        "Q: How many people were marching?",
        "A: Oh, there was \u2014 must have been \u2014 when we got there from Auschwitz, we were\nabout 1100. I don\u2019t know how ~\u2014 after all the killings and so on, maybe about seven,\neight hundred, we march \u2014",
        "Q: That started marching towards [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yeah, marching, yeah, right. Without food or water, in the sun.",
        "Q: And that was because the Russians were coming?",
        "A: Yeah, the Russians were \u2014 started to move in, they were \u2014 they were shelling the\narea and they \u2014 they were gonna \u2014 they\u2019re getting closer and they were \u2014 liquidated\nthe camp. So we \u2014 we were marching day and night without food or water and some\nof the prisoners co \u2014 collapsed. They would pick them up, put them in carts and put\nthem in \u2014 then on trucks and ship them to Dachau. Or we buried them off the road.\nI remember where I buried three bodies, three corpse, off the road near a bridge. We\nOctober 19, 1993\nput them on top one another, we dug deep enough to \u2014 just to put in the bodies on\ntop one another. One was still alive on top on \u2014 he was begging us, please [Speaks\nforeign language here] he says [speaks foreign language]. I\u2019m still living. Why\nare you trying to kill me? Why are you two bur \u2014 why are you burying me alive? He\nwas stretching out a hand to us, and the SS kept on hollering. He says, cover him\nup, cover him up. We covered him up, we had to take off. We marched again. They\nhad \u2014 their fa \u2014 con \u2014 I mean, the \u2014 the \u2014 th-the-the prisoners are just falling like \u2014\nit\u2019s unbelievable, they\u2019re just collapsing from \u2014 from hunger and thirst and\ndehydration. You can survive a lot longer from not eating food, but if you don\u2019t\nhave any water \u2014 try to go for water in the sun all day long, marching, without the\nhat, nothing, just in your uniform. We came to a place near \u2014 near a bridge in the \u2014\nsome of the prisoners tried to escape. They jumped over the bridge, tried to escape\nor to get \u2014 to get some water. They send in the German Shepherds after them, and\nthey \u2014 after the germ \u2014 th-the shepherds found them, they went ahead and used the\nmachine gun, boom, boom, boom, they killed them in there. Then we \u2014 we used to\nget \u2014 one day it was raining hard and we were told to go into a forest. We went into\nthat forest and we slept on the ground without coverage, we didn\u2019t have nothing,\njust our uniform. But, I mean it\u2019s th-the \u2014 typhus developed and they were dying all\nover.\nOctober 19, 1993",
        "Q: How many days did you march, do you know?",
        "A: Gosh, I don\u2019t remember. I don\u2019t know, maybe four or five days, I don\u2019t\nremember. I\u2019ve got no idea, just kept on \u2014 it was just \u2014 I was in another world, I\ndidn't even know. When we stopped at that place, we were \u2014 some of the prisoners\nwere digging with their spoons. We very seldom had spoons, we ate by the \u2014 our\nhands. I don\u2019t know where they got the spoons, but they were digging the ground,\nwhere there\u2019s \u2014 th-the ground, there wasn\u2019t too far away from a lake. And we heard\nsometimes after midnight a huge roar, water, water, everybody\u2019s running towards\nwater, water, water. I came over to that place too, with the other prisoners and I see\neverybody\u2019s grabbing handsful, it \u2014 from the ground it\u2019s coming up water about \u2014\noh, about two, three feet, it\u2019s jumping up, pop-popping up. I remember everybody\nwas grabbing [indecipherable] the bottom had \u2014",
        "Q: They were digging with their spoons to find water?",
        "A: To find water, yes, and they found it, came up enough. The-They \u2014 and suddenly\neverybody knew about it, the prisoners knew about it and they ran for water. W1 \u2014 I\nremember grabbing hands full of water with sand and stones and just shoving it into\nmy throat, swallowing, choking myself on the stones. I couldn\u2019t even \u2014 you know,\nit\u2019s hard to believe that \u2014 that \u2014 we \u2014 we were crazy, we didn\u2019t know, we were out\nof our minds. We didn\u2019t know from life or death, we didn\u2019t know what \u2014 who we\nOctober 19, 1993\nare or where \u2014 what we are. We were just oh, completely out. We were \u2014 we were \u2014\nsomething that it\u2019s hard to believe that a human being can \u2014 can survive something\nlike that.",
        "Q: And you finally arrived in Dachau?",
        "A: No, next day we took \u2014 marched again.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: We finally arrived to a place where we were waiting for a train. It was called\nKutno. Kutno at the \u2014 at the German Polish border. German \u2014 Kutno at the\nGerman Polish border, yeah. And we were waiting there for a train to arrive to take\nus someplace. It was pouring, it was raining hard. First when we got there, we\nstripped all the bark from the trees. Anything that was available, branches, we just\nate. Grass, whatever we can get ahold on, anything. We were starved, we didn\u2019t\nhave nothing to \u2014",
        "Q: How many days did you march to \u2014 to get to Kutno?",
        "A: Oh, I have got no idea. Four or five days, I can\u2019t \u2014 don\u2019t remember.",
        "Q: And all that time without food?",
        "A: Without food, without water, skeletons were walking.",
        "Q: Oh my \u2014\nOctober 19, 1993",
        "A: Skeletons were walking. There was nothing \u2014 black lips, with \u2014 with dying\nthere\u2019s no breathe \u2014 you can\u2019t hardly breathe, you\u2019re so weak. And we \u2014 we waited\nin that forest, it was pouring and we were \u2014 were in the mud. We were trying to\nhuddle together so we can get our body temperature warm from one another. That\u2019s\nonly heat we had and the prisoners were starting to die from typhus and all the\ntemperature, they had high temperatures from being sick, and they were dying like f\n\u2014 by the dozens. We could not bury them fast enough. Finally, two days later a train\narrived, a freight train arrived. They packed in in the boxcars a hundred or more\npeople in one boxcar. I remember we were standing like this, in the upright position\nlike sn \u2014 stacked herring. There was no air, no water, no food.",
        "Q: No sanitation.",
        "A: No sanitation. They boarded up the little windows from outside, what the freight\ngets. There was \u2014 it was choking inside. We were tearing our heads apart, we were\ntrying to kill ourselves, but we couldn\u2019t. We were tearing our eyes out, we were ki \u2014\npounding on our heads. We ti \u2014 we couldn\u2019t \u2014 we wanted to die, but there was no\nway then there, we couldn\u2019t even take a little step to get a \u2014 to do something, to \u2014 to\nkill ourselves. They just kept on falling and dying, from the weakness some of them\ncollapsed, then the al \u2014 the smell was awful. And we started to get more room once\nsome of them passed out or just \u2014 just couldn\u2019t do any more, couldn\u2019t get it \u2014 go on\nOctober 19, 1993\nany more. We finally arrived to Dachau death camp. I remember seven of us were\nmoved out \u2014 were \u2014 were \u2014 came out from that freight car. The rest of them were\nhalf dead or dead, from the 110. We gets \u2014 as we came down, there was six feet of a\ndrop. The SS kept on sh \u2014 pulling us, you know, gra \u2014 grabbing us with the rifle\nbutts, hitting us and he \u2014 come on, come on [indecipherable] you, and I remember\nthey grabbed me from \u2014 they grabbed me fr \u2014 with one hand, and I fell on my left\nshoulder upside down, because the six foot drop. And I couldn\u2019t move, I kept on\ncrawling, they kept on pounding on my back with the rifle butts. And just [speaks\nforeign language]. And th \u2014I kept on running. I kept on getting up and kept on\ngoing up. I didn\u2019t want to die ab \u2014 I always remember what my father told me at the\nAuschwitz, be strong, don\u2019t give up, we will meet again. I just kept on going. We\nfinally came into the \u2014 inside the Dachau entrance on the \u2014 it was cement floor. I\nremember seeing dozens of skeletons, their eyes in, you know, you could hardly see\nlike eyeballs where goo \u2014 they were just sunk in. And these skeletons, all in black\nlips, all they were moaning and moaning and moan \u2014 I remember I ca \u2014I fell o \u2014I\ncollapsed on my knees and I passed out, and there I fell asleep. When I woke up I\nsuddenly remembered, oh I mi\u2014I got to meet my father again, I better be \u2014 I got to\nbe stronger, I got to keep on going. I got up and moved around a little bit, here and\nthere, and I don\u2019t know, I \u2014 all of a sudden, I dr \u2014 don\u2019t remember any more to \u2014\nOctober 19, 1993\nwhat happened in Dachau, I wounded up in Landsberg lager s \u2014 lager seven, camp\nseven. And that is where I was put on on a night shift to work at Mihldorf, that\nnight shift to \u2014 to build the ammunition factory. We\u2019d [indecipherable] we \u2014 we set\na foundation, the foundation there. We used to work 10 \u2014 10 hours a day. It was\nhard work. I remember one day one of the prisoners collapsed on the ramp with his\nsack of cement. The SS ran over \u2014 two SS ran over and pounded on his head with\nhis rifle butt. And then they \u2014 they asked for \u2014 for the prisoners to help him put on\nthis sandbag. I went ose \u2014 I was one of them, too, I went over and helped to put it\nup, and he couldn\u2019t get up, he couldn\u2019t get up. They went ahead and asked some of\nthe prisoners to take him upstairs and put him in the cement mixer. They put in his\nhead in the cement mixer, and then they took him out, took him back to the \u2014 to the\ncamp, to Dachau. But they just \u2014 just told him to put him in in there to grind him\naround a little bit. Then wa \u2014 there was a German \u2014 there was a German who used \u2014\nwhat do you call these big machines? The cranes. He was digging ground in there,\nand he used to bake potatoes inside that \u2014 they \u2014 they used to have coal in there, he\nused to bake potatoes. He would always have a full loaded oven with potatoes. And\nwe \u2014 if we get a chance, we ran over to him, he would give us four or five potatoes.\nIt was like a steak, 1t was great. Hot, it was just burning, it was just beautiful. He\ntold me once, he says, if they catch me, I hope the SS don\u2019t report me to \u2014 to the \u2014\nOctober 19, 1993\nthe higher authority, otherwise I\u2019m no \u2014 I\u2019m going to be punished. But the \u2014 a lot of\nthe SS knew about it, they saw us doing it, you know, they saw what we\u2019re doing.\nThere was a \u2014 on the also, ag \u2014 not far away was a \u2014 was a garden of vegetables and\nso on. I remember we ran over there, break through the wire and we stole that. We\nkept on eating it while we were there. The minute we brought it in to \u2014 to the other\nprisoners, it was gone. In a minute, it was \u2014 it was gone, they tore at you, they kill\nyou for a piece of bread. So then, from there I was very weak and I said to myself, I\ngot to ta\u2014 I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m never going to survive. I\u2019ve got no energy and I cannot carry\nthat cement. And I see where also some of the weak guy \u2014 people, they bring them\nin from work, put them in a death barrack. Still alive. No doctors, no nothing, no\nmedicines. You \u2014 you cannot work, or your \u2014 something happens to you, there\u2019s the\ndeath barrack, that\u2019s your medicine, death. Death. I decided \u2014",
        "Q: They didn\u2019t kill them there, they just let them die?",
        "A: Let them die. Let them die.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: That\u2019s exactly what happened. So one day I came home from \u2014 from work and\none of my friends told me that a friend of mine I used to work with together, you\nknow, we \u2014 some of the times we used to \u2014 he is \u2014 th-they put him in the death\nbarrack. I was anxious to find out who he is. They took me there to him and he \u2014 I\nOctober 19, 1993\nsaw, oh maybe about 40 or 50 bodies. He was hanging with his head down and\nactually li \u2014 looking at us that he is still alive. He was \u2014 he was upside-down like\nthis. We couldn\u2019t go too close because it was typhus in there. Everywhere you went\nin was a dangers you would pick up something. But I went away brokenhearted and\nI said to myself, I \u2014 that could be me next. I was \u2014 I was ready to cry and then I said\nto myself, oh no I better don\u2019t cry, I may be here tomorrow. I decided that I\u2019m\ngoing to steal some potatoes. It wasn\u2019t too far away from a bunker, because I ca \u2014 I\ndidn\u2019t want to die, I wanted to live. One morning I went to the bunker. I tied up my\npajamas, my \u2014 my \u2014 my uniform on the bottom and I went in the bunker, I filled up\nmy pants full of potatoes. Some other p-prisoners encouraged me to do it too\nbecause they were going to give me a piece of bread and they were going to buy\nsome butter for that. So I \u2014",
        "Q: Oh, you were bartering the \u2014 bartering the food that you got? You would\nexchange the potatoes for some [indecipherable]",
        "A: Potatoes for something else, yeah, like a piece of bread, or \u2014 or piece of bread or\nbutter, whatever it is. Sometimes they will bring in some smuggling, something\nfrom outside, a candy or whatever. A cigarette. And I filled it up and all of a sudden\nI hear hoo, hoo, the sirens are going. I said, oh my God, this is the second siren\nalready, I didn\u2019t hear the first one. I must have been busy du \u2014 doing business in\nOctober 19, 1993\nthere big \u2014 I was a big businessman trying to figure out how much \u2014 how much I\u2019m\ngoing to sell th-the potatoes for bread. And su-suddenly I \u2014I started to run towards\nmy barrack. I said, oh my God, this is the second one. Here, I wouldn\u2019t give up the\npotatoes, I\u2019m \u2014 this is my life. I wouldn\u2019t give it up in ci \u2014 to let go the potatoes, I k\n\u2014Ik-\u2014held them in my \u20141n my pants. I ran towards my barrack and I hear the lager\n\u2014 th-the commander 1s asking to go back in the barracks all the \u2014 all the\nLagerfuhrers, all the \u2014 should go back 1n the \u2014 in the barracks and find the\nprisoner, dead or alive. I knew they were talking about me, so I kept on running\ntowards my barrack. While they went inside, I kept on running to my \u2014 towards my\nbarrack. I came to my barrack all out of breath, and we \u2014 my feet are just co \u2014\nloaded, you know, I cannot even run, but I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m robbing the potatoes, so \u2019'm\nlooking like this, loaded. And I se \u2014 run into the second row and I\u2019m standing, you\nknow, attention. Everybody came out, the commander officer a-asked, count the\nmen again, in your barrack. They counted, everybody was there. The commanding\nofficer says, who just came in? Was quiet. He started with again \u2014 who just came\nin? The prisoner next to me pointed a finger at me. Well, they \u2014 they saw my pants\nloaded, they got ahold of me, took me in into a small [indecipherable] they asked \u2014\nthe officer asked one of the kapos in there, Killer, who used to be good doing the\npunishment, torturing. They got ahold of me, took me into a small locker room, on a\nOctober 19, 1993\nheavy piece of wood, put me on there, tied up my hands in a bracket o-over my\nhead, and my knees to a bracket. [indecipherable] I remember he kept on pounding\non me with some kind of a heavy piece of wood, or a two by four. I remember\nscreaming. I remember screaming, and that\u2019s about all. I don\u2019t remember any more.\nI woke up \u2014 I woke up in a \u2014 in a doghouse. I was \u2014 I woke up in a doghouse. I was\ncrammed in with two other prisoners, one was dead and one was moaning. I don\u2019t\nknow how many days I was in there, because I was out, passed out. And one of the\nofficers was \u2014 was inspecting \u2014 one of the officers was inspecting th-th-the \u2014 the\ncamp and he came \u2014 when he went by there, he heard the moaning, he asked, who is\nin there, to open up. He saw us in there, gave him one look with my eyes can hardly\nopen up, he says, let the ma \u2014 let the prisoners loose. I don\u2019t know, first time, you\nknow, so that they carried me in. I don\u2019t know wi \u2014 the other prisoners, what they\ndid with them, but they carried me into my barrack. I couldn\u2019t walk because my\nback was all messed up. And the reason why they did that, because the officer gave\nthe orders. Otherwise so they would put me in the ba \u2014 in the death barrack. They\ntook me into the barrack and they told me I\u2019ve got two days to recuperate and I\nhave to go to work. In the meantime I asked for \u2014 from the Lagerfuhrers \u2014 I mean,\nthe camp |-leader for some food. He said, I\u2019ll give you some food. Did you get your\n\u2014 your piece of bread every day, and you know, at night time soup? I said, no, I\nOctober 19, 1993\ndidn\u2019t get nothing. I didn\u2019t get since I was there. He says, you were there eight days\nand y-you didn\u2019t get nothing? He says, go to the shl \u2014 Lagerschreiber. The\nLagerschreiber was the accountant who let in \u2014 who ope \u2014 when you opened up\nthe gate, he counted the people coming in and going out. He made sure that\neverybody \u2014 that\u2019s whats the \u2014 the \u2014 the Schreiber, the Lagerschreiber. And he \u2014\nhe told me to ask \u2014 he gave me my \u2014 my bread, everything, I should go and ask him\nfor it. | went over and asked him for it, he came downstairs from his \u2014 from his\nbooth upstairs and he came over and I told him what my barrack leader said. He got\nahold of me like this, gave me a bloody mouth. I came back with a bleeding mouth.\nI went back and told \u2014 I told th-the \u2014 the lead \u2014 the ba \u2014 barrack leader what \u2014 what\nI got. He says, well I don\u2019t know what \u2014 what to tell you, but I\u2019Il try to help you. I'll\ngive you some of the barrels to lick out after \u2014 they were wooden barrels of soup.\nAfter everybody has the soup, I\u2019Il give you to lick out the barrels. So I remember\nfor a couple of days I kept on licking out the barrels. Spin \u2014 spin of \u2014 some of the\nwood would come off, you know, splinters, and I would just eat it like bread, I \u2014\nlike food, I didn\u2019t even \u2014 I just swallowed everything what came in. And I got \u2014",
        "Q: How come you didn\u2019t get your normal rationing?\nOctober 19, 1993",
        "A: Because he ate \u2014 he sold it for \u2014 for cigarettes, the guy up on th-the scharl \u2014\nLagerschreiber. He did something with it. He \u2014 be \u2014 maybe he ate it, he sold it for\ncigarettes.",
        "Q: So how long were you in \u2014",
        "A: Landsberg?",
        "Q: Landsberg, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, okay. From there I was \u2014 I was told that I have ki \u2014 if I cannot go to work,\nsome of the prisoners told me, if I go on a pa \u2014 role call, to stand straight, because\nthey\u2019re \u2014 they\u2019re expecting \u2014 a couple days later, that one of the days they\u2019re\nexpecting a health inspector. So, I was standing straight, but of \u2014 of course, I\ncouldn\u2019t move my arm, I was sideways. And I was worried that if they get \u2014 the\ninspector sees me, I\u2019m going to \u2014 either he\u2019s going to say I\u2019m not \u2014 no more good to\nwork, they\u2019re going to put me into the death barrack. But luckily there was no\ninspection that day. But they asked for volunteers. They asked for volunteers and\nwe went to dig trenches for \u2014 for the German SS in the forest. We fixed the streets\nand so on.",
        "Q: In Landsberg?",
        "A: In la\u2014 in Landsberg. Then we \u2014 they asked \u2014 the next day they asked again for\nvolunteers, something else. I always hope there\u2019s going to be better days. If I\nOctober 19, 1993\nvolunteer maybe I\u2019Il get a better treatment or more food. I always hope for better,\nbut I\u2014 I always gambled, and I was never \u2014 never had any luck. This time we \u2014 they\ntook a transport, oh about, I \u2014 I \u2014 two, three truckloads. And we \u2014 they took us to\nLandshut camp. Landshut camp was a \u2014 a German ammunition place, they storage\nammunition. They emptied out a few of the blocks \u2014 a few of the barracks they\nemptied out and they put in some of the prisoners in air \u2014 he \u2014 in case the American\nbombs \u2014 bombers bombed that area, they blow up, we\u2019re going to get blown up in it\ntoo. In the meantime, the SS were there with their ammunition and we were there\nworking also. We were at there, or we were at work. So we were taking by truck to\na railroad s-sta \u2014 we were taking by trucks, not knowing where we were gonna go.\nHere we\u2019re traveling through the forest \u2014",
        "Q: That was from Landsberg to \u2014",
        "A: To Landshut. It\u2019s a Landshut camp, yeah. It wasn\u2019t too far away, but it\u2019s called\nLandshut camp. Then we went down to, by truck, two truckloads went down to \u2014\nthrough the forest, we didn\u2019t know where we were going. We asked the \u2014 the SS,\nwhere are we \u2014 where are you taking us? They didn\u2019t say where, they said, it\u2019s none\nof your business. So we just \u2014 we were quiet and we were \u2014 th-they didn't hear a\nwhisper. We go through different dark places and here is \u2014 we were just shooking\nup, with \u2014 they\u2019re probably going to kill us someplace. We came a little closer, we\nOctober 19, 1993\nsee smoke going up. Uh-oh, there is the chimneys and there\u2019s \u2014 there is another\nplace where they kill people. We finally came, after 45 minutes or so, we ca \u2014\nfinally came to a place where there was \u2014 you could see civilians, homes, displayed\nstores. My God, we felt the \u2014 already relieved, oh, they\u2019re not going to kill us, we \u2014\nthere\u2019s something different here, w-we \u2014 we see it \u2014 I haven\u2019t seen a \u2014 a woman for\n\u2014 for over a year. And here is a\u2014I am staring at them, it\u2019s a ma \u2014 it\u2019s a pleasure.\nThen suddenly we\u2019re cross \u2014 crossing over railroad tracks and we are \u2014 as we\ncrawled over railroad tracks we see smoke coming up. Right away we thought, well,\nth-this is something different. We\u2019re probably going to work here because they\nbombed \u2014 th-the trains are all bombed all over, smashed up railroad tracks. As we\nwalked \u2014 we got out from the trucks. We walked towards the direction of where that\nbombing was. We saw aftr \u2014 a freight car opened up, one of the boxcars, spilled out\nwhite powder. We didn\u2019t know what it was at that time. But we walked in that\ndirection, and it was smoldering, that white powder. Then suddenly one of the guys,\nsome of the guys started to smell like \u2014 they said it \u2014 they said it\u2019s burning sugar.\nJust like that, they se \u2014 they said burning sugar. And there all of us, all the prisoners\njust started to run on that direction. We were falling on our faces. We kept on\nrunning and running and running. And we got there and sure enough, it was sugar.\nWe kept on grabbing in handfuls hot sugar. I remember grabbing hands, boiling\nOctober 19, 1993\nsugar, we just kept on shoving it in. My mouth was burning and my hands were\npeeling off, I just kept on shoving it in, and the SS were pounding on our heads with\ntheir \u2014 their rifle butts because we were eating the sugar. This time at least \u2014",
        "Q: What exactly happened? You were taken to Landshut camp to work, and there\nwas a bombing \u2014",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: \u2014 that bombed that train and \u2014",
        "A: That\u2019s right, they needed to clean up, they needed work.",
        "Q: Ah, I see.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: They needed to clean up that \u2014",
        "A: Sure.",
        "Q: \u2014 that [indecipherable]",
        "A: That\u2019s where they always used us, for places where they needed work, slavery.",
        "Q: And that\u2019s where you \u2014 you got the sugar.",
        "A: That\u2019s right, we got the sugar, it felt so great. Even so, the \u2014 the par \u2014 the SS\nwere pounding on our heads. Th-Th-Th \u2014 most of the time they pe \u2014 beat us for\nnothing. This time they beat us, at least we enjoyed something. So it felt good, but\nOctober 19, 1993\nthen we worked there, you know, tur-turning over th-the railroad cars and cleaning\nup the mess. Then we went back there again, and we worked on the railroad tracks.",
        "Q: And where did you sleep in \u2014 at night?",
        "A: At night we went back to the camp.",
        "Q: To Landshut?",
        "A: To \u2014 to Landshut camp, yes, Landshut camp.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. How far was that from Landsberg?",
        "A: Oh, about an hour drive.",
        "Q: An hour.",
        "A: Ab-About an hour drive from there.",
        "Q: So how long were you in Landsberg?",
        "A: In Landsberg, about th-three, four weeks.",
        "Q: Three, four weeks.",
        "A: That\u2019s all.",
        "Q: And in Landshut?",
        "A: Landshut? Oh, I don\u2019t know, the \u2014 Landshut, it was very short time, maybe\nabout three weeks, because th-th \u2014 let me just ke \u2014 go back again \u2014",
        "Q: Sure.\nOctober 19, 1993",
        "A: \u2014 because that\u2019s something interesting. One day while we were working, the\nsirens were going, the American bombers came. They ri \u2014 the SS told us to run and\nthe soldier ran \u2014 ru-run into the forest. We ran into the forest, a few minutes later\nwe see the American bombers diving. We could see the bombs falling and we are so\nhappy we are gonna be free by the Americans. We didn\u2019t even know who the\nAmericans were, but we were \u2014 we were happy about it. Then there was another\ntime we came out to work, this same thing happened, the American bombers are\nagain there. This time they\u2019re blowing up the railroad tracks. Everywhere you go\nthey\u2019re blowing the \u2014 everything is on fire. You don\u2019t see a soul no place. After it\nwas first finished, it was quieted down, some of the prisoners started to walk around\nas, you know, walked around to see what\u2019s happening. As we walked through \u2014 we\ncame over a \u2014 we walked over a railroad bridge, and on the left hand side there was\nabout 24 small planes. The American bombers \u2014 we still watched how the American\nbombers were using that 44 machine gun, I don\u2019t know what they call it, but they\nwere machine gunning the \u2014 th-the gas tanks and blowing up all the \u2014 all \u2014 all those\nplanes. I would \u2014 kept on watching them, how they were blowing up like \u2014",
        "Q: Which planes, the German planes?",
        "A: The German planes, they were popping up like \u2014 like popcorn, they were just\nblown up right after one another.\nOctober 19, 1993",
        "Q: What time of year was it, do you remember\u2019?",
        "A: It was sometimes in April?",
        "Q: \u00b045?",
        "A: Yeah, \u201945, April 45. And then we went back to our truck, our truck was blown\nup to pieces. Our truck wasn\u2019t there, so we didn\u2019t know what to do. A lot of the\nprisoners escaped. I was afraid to make the escape, I could have escaped too, but I\nwas afraid. I was afraid because of being beaten and I couldn\u2019t take no more pain,\nbecause I still felt the pain in my head from the lead pipe and beating all the time at\nwork. So I was afraid, I didn\u2019t want \u2014 want to gamble. We finally got a truck, we\ncame back. Here we \u2014 we are going \u2014 the next day we went out to work to build\nagai \u2014 to dig again branches for the German soldiers. We are not getting any more\nfood, it\u2019s already three or four days, we\u2019re not getting no food, we didn\u2019t go to work\nno place. We see the Germans are removing out their ammunition, we watch \u2014 were\nwatching them taking it out.",
        "Q: So there was no supervision any more \u2014",
        "A: N-N \u2014 oh yes, the commanding officer wasn\u2019t there, no, the commanding officer\nwasn\u2019t there, but he was still in charge. When we went out \u2014 when we went out to \u2014\nto dig the trenches, he would come out with his motorcycle to inspect. He would\nbring along a 15 foot white, long whip like you train animals and he would whip us\nOctober 19, 1993\nfrom \u2014 from far away he would flip \u2014 whip us. But I \u2014 I \u2014 I remember I couldn\u2019t\nwork too much because of my shoulder and I kept on \u2014 the minute I saw the \u2014 the\nwhip coming, I bent down and you know, I felt sorry for the taller prisoner who got\nhit. But he would just take it out on the prisoners because they were losing the war.\nAfter awhile \u2014 nek \u2014 it would \u2014 didn\u2019t take too long, we see the bombs are flying, it\ndi \u2014 it lights up the skies, artillery, it\u2019s going crazy. It \u2014 suddenly, we were ordered\nnext day to march to the railroad station. We came to the railroad station \u2014",
        "Q: The railroad station in [indecipherable]",
        "A: Y-Y-Yes, Landshut\u2019s rail station. They loaded us in in \u2014 in boxcars. We didn\u2019t\nknow where we were going. They closed up the doors. We are \u2014 as we made \u2014 we\ncame \u2014 we dro \u2014 traveled about 25 minutes, the train stopped again to let go by a\nGerman train loaded with ammunition and \u2014 and artillery, everything is loaded. You\ncould see their \u2014 their faces are sad, they \u2014 they \u2014 they know that s-something\u2019s\nwrong and they don\u2019t like to go the \u2014 those places. But the \u2014 one of the locomotive\nat that station went in to got some water. After he left, I was a may \u2014 maybe about a\none of \u2014 and a half car away from \u2014 from that spout, and there was another sp \u2014\nprisoner also with me. And I \u2014I said to myself, boy it would be nice if I could go\nover and take a bath inside the tank, or just take a good drink of water. So after he\nleft, Iran over and that other guy, the other prisoner ran over too, were holding up\nOctober 19, 1993\nour ma \u2014 hands to the drip, the drips were coming in. And it felt so good to have a\ncouple drops of water, it felt great. And the SS were chasing us back to our \u2014 to our\nfreight car \u2014 to our cars. So I didn\u2019t \u2014 but our guard was helpful. Then we took off\nagain. We k-kept on going for maybe another 35 \u2014 40 minutes on the train and\nsuddenly we are sh \u2014 moved in, and the train made a sudden stop. We didn\u2019t know\nwhat happened, whether it was a \u2014 just everybody was falling on top of another.\nBefore it if \u2014 1f \u2014 1n a few seconds later we hear the bombers are diving in, bombing\nour train. The American bombed our train by mistake. They knocked out lik \u2014\nlocomotives, a lot of the pers \u2014 a lot of casualties were there. And after the first\ntime, they came back the second time, some of the prisoners threw their stripe\nuniforms on top of the \u2014 of the \u2014 of the boxcars. When they came back they turned\naround and took off.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: But the \u2014 we found out that one of the trains, German trains that was chasing a\nGerman art-artillery train and he \u2014 they went by and they got us by mistake. That\u2019s\nwhat we were told. But anyway \u2014",
        "Q: Did you try to run away during that time?",
        "A: Well, no, I didn\u2019t, but maybe somebody else did. I was afraid. I was afraid\nbecause I wanted to come back alive, I \u2014 my father\u2019s \u2014 I wanted to see my father\nOctober 19, 1993\nagain and I had also hope that some of my family would sur \u2014 survived. We took o\n\u2014 tha-that train was out of commission, we couldn\u2019t go no place. Everything was a \u2014\nhad a \u2014 we were just waiting. The SS didn\u2019t know what to do with \u2014 with us. The\ncommanding officer is gone. We were just sitting in front of the freight cars and\ntalking. It came later in the afternoon, the SS commander \u2014 officer comes to me, he\nsays [indecipherable] boutonnicre and with his [indecipherable] in his hand, and\nhe said \u2014 oh, no, the SS hollered, oh, everybody I \u2014 in attention. Everybody th \u2014 is\nat \u2014 is at attention, and we\u2019re shaking from fear because he would only come when\n\u2014 when there are bad times, when something \u2014 somebody did something wrong or\nhe\u2019s going to do something bad. He says, you are a-all liberated, you are free to do\nwherever you want. Oh my God, are you sure? You heed a \u2014 he-heard wa \u2014 you\nheard a you sure and everybody started to run over the railroad tracks, and wheat\nfield, corn field. I remember running with a few other prisoners over the railroad\ntracks and we ran into wheat fields and cornfields and while we\u2019re running, I see\nsome other ama \u2014 prisoners who are running with me are falling down. I said run,\nrun [indecipherable], but they \u2014 they didn\u2019t get up, another fell, another one fell.\nAnd ga \u2014 they didn\u2019t get up. I just kept on running, I said to myself, maybe they\u2019re\nweak, they cannot get up. I kept on running. I saw a sign while I was running, I saw\na sign [indecipherable] and then I saw a big building in there. I ran towards the\nOctober 19, 1993\ndirection. I came in to \u2014 toward that building, there was a little delicatessen in there.\nI ran in the side of delicatessen, the owner over the counter got ahold four slices of\nwhite bread and gave it to me.

So,\nwhen I told that to some my friends in there, they told me not to go because I\u2019 Il\nnever come back again, because Russia wouldn\u2019t let you out. You'll \u2014 you\u2019ll be\nable to get in, but not to \u2014 you\u2019Il not be able to get out.

A couple days later I met some of the\npeople in there, but most of them were s \u2014 from small towns. There were two or\nthree from my city, but most of them were from small towns who survived. And\nfinally my brother came a couple days later and we went \u2014 we decided \u2014 we heard\nthat we must leave Czechoslovakia because the Russians are closing the borders.\nSo we had to hurry up and get out from there.",

        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: Where did you from there?",
        "A: We \u2014 first my brother suggested we should try to sell our house, to see if\nsomebody lived there and try to sell our house. We went there with our little\npackages wrapped up, you know, couple bundles. And he told me, he says, Irving,\nyou wait outside, don\u2019t come in. Pll \u2014 1f everything is okay I\u2019ll come up to you, but\nif not, is \u2014 you wait here. He went in inside to see \u2014 there was sechukers(ph) they\ncalled them, Ukraines who moved in in our house, and he chased my brother with a\nOctober 19, 1993\nbayonet. He told him, if you ever come back I\u2019m gonna wait for you next time with\na bayonet, I'll blow your head off. He started to run, he said, Itzhak, run, run, run\nfor your life. I kept on running, running and I \u2014 when he told me that I couldn\u2019t\nbelieve it. I couldn\u2019t believe it, I was crying and I was so bitter about it. There is\nnothing we have got here, we gotta get out of here, this is the hateful place that I \u2014\nthat \u2014 that \u2014 th \u2014 if you \u2014 they found out I\u2019m Jewish I survived, they\u2019re going to kill\nme too. So we ran to the small gas \u2014 to small \u2014 there we had two big stations, one a\nsmall one, one a big one. From where \u2014 we\u2019re cl \u2014 we were closer to the small\nstation. So we got back there and we were sitting waiting for a train, you never\nknew when a train is gonna come, two, three hours, four or five hours. It was about\none or two o\u2019clock in the morning, we are waiting still. There were some FBI\nagents, you know, like, they\u2019re not FBI, th-they \u2014 they called them \u2014 what \u2014 what \u2014\nwhat they call them, the \u2014 in Russia, the \u2014 I cannot recall them, but anyway, they \u2014\nthey \u2014 th-they were \u2014 NKVD they called them",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Yeah, they were watching everything and checking out outside and inside. They\ncame and checked out everybody who was waiting at the station there, their\npassports. Everybody\u2019s was fine, my brother\u2019s was fine, he was liberated, he was a\ncaptured prisoner in Russia, that he had this paper that he was \u2014 he \u2014 that he was a\nOctober 19, 1993\nke \u2014 prisoner, he was free now. But I was \u2014 I got papers from Germany, and I w-\nwas born in Czechoslovakia. The papers said I was born in Czechoslovakia,\nChust. They called me in inside and th-th-th-the little room in there, at that station\nand this one NK VD\u2019er(ph) tells me, he says, you were born here, your papers said\nyou were born in Chust, Czechoslovakia, this is where you belong. You\u2019re not\nleaving this place. This is your country, your home. I said to him, I have to meet my\nfamily if somebody survived in Germany, I have to go there. Maybe later on I'll\ncome back after I\u2019m finished. He says no, you cannot go no place, you \u2014 I\u2019m sorry,\nyou gotta stay here, that\u2019s your home. Suddenly while were ti \u2014 I\u2019m arguing with\nhim and I\u2019m ra \u2014 crying, he \u2014 suddenly we heard some shooting outside, fire \u2014 they\nwere shooting, gunfire. He started run out, I ran after him. And the minute I ran\nafter him I s-s-saw my brother, I said \u2014 I told my brother, run for your life, let\u2019s go\nto the big station. We took off, ran ou \u2014 toward the big station. We tripped, we \u2014\nmaybe took us a half an hour, 45 minutes to get there. We tripped all o-on \u2014 on\nrailroad ties, we fell in chuckholes. We \u2014 we came bloodied up to the big station\nwith our knees, but we finally made it. Here we\u2019re waiting in there for th \u2014 for the\ntrain didn\u2019t come yet and we are hoping that there\u2019s going to be room on it because\nmost of the time the trains were \u2014 came in so loaded, people are hanging onto the\nsteps, they were standing on the steps, they couldn\u2019t get on. So I finally \u2014 we \u2014\nOctober 19, 1993\nfinally the train came, we got in, we couldn\u2019t get on. So everybody was climbing on\ntop of the roof, so we \u2014 I remember I \u2014 I ran from one place, it was dark, 1t was after\nmidnight, two or three o\u2019clock in the morning. I ran from one place to another and I\nfinally saw some people are trying to help one another to get up. I figured Pll \u2014 PIl\nget up too. They helped me to get up to the top of the roof. On top of the roof you\nwere pretty safe, but when the Russians came up there to ask you for money or \u2014 or\n\u2014 or th-they\u2019re gonna kill you for watches, you had to give \u2014 you \u2014 there was tsoris.\nThere were problems. And I \u2014 a-anyway, the train started to move. Every \u2014",
        "Q: And where did it go to?",
        "A: Everything was fine, we \u2014 we were on our way going back to \u2014 I was supposed\nto go back to Germany. I said, I don\u2019t have for a pass, I\u2019m gone \u2014 the pa \u2014 I know\nmy pass is gone, I don\u2019t have nothing. They \u2014 he too \u2014 th-the civilian took away my\npass. We are coming to the small station, the train starts out, and it\u2019s going \u2014 my\nheart is feeling ba \u2014 faster and faster, I hear the train is going and I said to myself,\nboy if \u20141f we stop at that station, the small one where \u2014 where we \u2014 we were\nwaiting, we ran away from, and th \u2014 th-that civilian is waiting for me, the NKVD is\nwaiting for me, I'll be in trouble, they\u2019re gonna take me off. It is dark, but I wen \u2014\nin \u2014 you know, you never know what those guys will do.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.\nOctober 19, 1993",
        "A: Anyway, we got \u2014 we got \u2014 we g-got \u2014 came closer by and the train just flew \u2014\njust went by, whistled loud and went by, didn\u2019t stop because there was no room no\nplace, every seat was taken. I thank God, my God, I\u2019m safe, I got \u2014 I fooled them,\nI\u2019m out of \u2014 from Chust, I\u2019m out of it. So we finally, on the way going, the \u2014 y-you\ncould see th-the \u2014 the \u2014 some of the p \u2014 some of the people would stand up and the\nelectric wires, or telephone wire were \u2014 were across, and if you got up too high fro\n\u2014on top of the roof, you were just picked up by the wire and you\u2019re knocked off.\nNext to us that happened to one of the guys. He got up to change places with\nsomebody else. He didn\u2019t lower his head en-enough, or he just came \u2014 he picked his\nhead up and \u2014 he picked himself up just in time, when he came near the wire and he\ngot blown off from the \u2014 from the train.",
        "Q: How long did the trip to Germany take?",
        "A: Oh, I\u2014I don\u2019t know.

Then \u2014 then we \u2014 the \u2014 there \u2014 there was \u2014 it depends what kind of a train\nwe took. Sometimes we had to go on our circuits around, sometimes they went\nstraight, they were going different directions. Nobody [tape break] okay, we\narrived, and my brother was supposed to be on \u2014 on that train, too. And \u2014 from\nOctober 19, 1993\nDebrecen to \u2014 to Prague. Once I got to Prague I was looking for my brother and I\ncouldn\u2019t find him.",
        "Q: Oh, your brother was not on the train with you?",
        "A: No, he wasn\u2019t. He \u2014 he \u2014 he \u2014 he was \u2014 I got on, I thought for sure he\u2019s \u2014 was on\non it too. So I was waiting for him in Prague for days for him to come in, he didn't\nshow up. I was worried about him and I d \u2014 I \u2014I didn\u2019t know what happened to\nhim. But I couldn\u2019t do nothing about it because the time came that we had to leave\nwith the border at Prague chur \u2014 1-in austr \u2014 Austria, Czechoslovakian Australia\n\u2014 Austria was going to be closed, so we had to rush out from there.

And we were eating the horsemeat, everybody was thro \u2014\nthrew it at the cook, you know, they said, is that what we deserve after surviving?\nSome of them \u2014 you know, I was happy to eat no matter what it is, I was worried\nnext day I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m gonna starve. I didn\u2019t argue about it. And th-there was a young\ncouple maybe about 18 years old, to \u2014 a girl and a boy who lived all \u2014 near a bridge,\nyou know, it was just like a small bridge going over. They \u2014 they lived under an\numbrella, a poor \u2014 sh-sha \u2014 rain or shine, they were out there s-sleeping and living\nthere.

I want to go over to Germany where I was liberated\nso I can start a new life. He wouldn\u2019t give in, no, nothing doing, nothing doing.

We \u2014 there \u2014 it was so unbelievable that they were \u2014 it\ncould have been a family, although some of these children tried to survive, they\nheld together for their \u2014 during the bombing or they just starved like that. They \u2014\nthey \u2014 I remember we used to take off their shinbones and \u2014 and we used to guess\nhow old these children were. I\u2019ve got now a grandson, and you know, ke-keep on\nlooking at his shinbone here \u2014 about a year and a half old \u2014 and I keep on looking at\nthe shinbones and I said, my God, th-that-that \u2014 that\u2019s pretty close what I\u2019ve seen\nOctober 19, 1993\nwhen we \u2014 th-there must have been some \u2014 sometimes about a year or so, all those\nkids. And we used to \u2014 one day at work \u2014",
        "A: Cleaning the bricks and \u2014 and moving dirt. Dump \u2014 pour \u2014 throwing it from one\nprisoner to another, to a \u2014 to a cart that the ge \u2014 Polish people came in and took it to\nthe railroad. And we would throw it down from the top of \u2014 of a hill, like from the\nbombed parts, maybe make a \u2014 a chain and we throw it one \u2014 for one another, til it\ngo-got to the cart, to \u2014 with the horse and buggy, yeah.",
        "A: N-No, no.",
        "A: You\u2019re not \u2014 you wouldn\u2019t allowed to have \u2014 be a leader, because the minute\nthey heard you were a leader, you were dead. We did it between ourselves. We\ntalked our language, sometimes Hebrew, the different words so they don\u2019t\nunderstand, like orlay(ph). We \u2014 the \u2014 somebody \u2014 the kapo would come or \u2014 or\nsome SS, we \u2014 it\u2019s orlay(ph) orlay(ph) orlay(ph), that means keep on moving,\nmoving, you know, or \u2014 or some other words we used to use, I forgot already. But\nwe \u2014 on the way \u2014 one day \u2014\nOctober 19, 1993",
        "A: In the ghetto?",
        "A: Oh yeah, w-we got up in the m \u2014 in the morning we used to get up around 4:30.\nWe have black coffee and a piece of bread, cornbread and we marched through the\n\u2014 most of the time we marched through the forest so nobody could see us. And we\ncame \u2014 we came \u2014 it took us about a half an hour to get to march there, to \u2014 to the\nbomb ghetto. Once we were there, everybody was at sh \u2014 working 1n different th-\nthings. There were so many things going on that \u2014\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "A: That\u2019s right, yeah. And once on the way going to work, we wo \u2014 sometimes,\nonce or twice a week, we would see German trucks loaded with partisans. How we\nknew they were partisans, while we were marching si \u2014 the back cover opened up\nfrom the wind, it would just open up, I could see them. They were blindfolded with\nblack rags, their eyes and tied up in the back. I remember seeing some of the faces,\nyou know, turning; they heard the marching, you know, the noises from marching.\nThey turned towards us, and I said to myself, God, I wish, oh, I wish I could help\nOctober 19, 1993\nyou. I don\u2019t know \u2014 I \u2014 I \u2014I \u2014I felt so bad. I wish I could have gone over and just\nblown out the whole thing with them so th-they wouldn\u2019t take them. And then they\nwould take them to \u2014 to the \u2014 to a place which was right in our \u2014 on the ou-outside\nof the \u2014 from our camp where we \u2014 where w \u2014 and \u2014 and there was a\nslaughterhouse. They put up a cement block outsi \u2014 you know, it\u2019s \u2014 was outside,\nbut a\u2014a wall, four walls. And they would take in those prisoners, I mean, the\npartisans, shoot them out. In the evening you\u2019d hear the machine guns going for 10\n- 15 minutes. They \u2014 they wou \u2014 in fact, when we used to \u2014 sometimes when it\nrained and the ground was wet, and we walked in their direction, my wooden shoes\nhad a line, like red \u2014 red ink \u2014 red \u2014 red \u2014 red paint, but it was blood. The blood was\n\u2014 was soaked over the ground in there, they used to kill so many of them.",
        "A: We quit around f\u2014 when \u2014 later in the evening, about eight, 10 hours sometimes.\nIt depends \u2014 I forgot already, but I know usually eight, 10 hours a day we\n[indecipherable]. When it start to get dark, we w \u2014 took off, all the time.",
        "A: No. No food.",
        "A: No, only bre \u2014 wa \u2014 only thing you took along with you, if you had a piece of\nbread \u2014 I remember I used to take along a piece of bread in my pocket, sew it in\nbecause there was no pockets and save it. When I was ready to \u2014 to faint from\nhunger, I would take a little crumb and put it on my tongue and just keep on sucking\non it to keep me alive. And you know, one day, there was one a \u2014 one interesting 1-\ni-incident. I \u2014 I was walking, you know, I was like in an \u2014 in an area where I \u2014 I was\ndigging up bricks to be cleaned up. And all of a sudden I got hit on my ankle with a\npiece of brick. And I turned around \u2014 that hurted \u2014 I turned around and I look\naround, I didn\u2019t see nobody. I said oh, forget it, maybe somebody just in a joke did\nsomething. Then suddenly I see little pebbles flying around me and I got hit again in\nmy foot, a little higher. I turned around, I said to myself, oh boy, that \u2014 I got to find\nout who that is. I turned around and I see somebody sticking \u2014 somebody was\nsticking out the \u2014 the head from under the rubble, just enough to see his head. He\nhad black hair on and he was pointing with his finger to \u2014 to follow him, to ca \u2014 to\ngo \u2014 to escape. Now, I made two steps and I suddenly jumped back, I said to\nmyself, oh my God, I remember I got beaten up by a \u2014 the lead pipe. I cannot take\nthat pain no more. I\u2019m still hurting from it, I\u2019m still in pain. And I didn \u2014 wouldn\u2019t\ngo, but he was trying to ma \u2014 make me escape. A lot of the prisoners escaped.",
        "A: But tha \u2014 tha \u2014 they escape and probably they caught them, because they kept on\nkilling them all the time. Yes, so then, from there I had the \u2014 the Russians started t-\nto \u2014 we \u2014 di\u2014 oh yeah, you used to get so many of the partisans, so many captured\nof the partisans that they decided to build a crematorium, a small one. First we\nthought it\u2019s going to be a bakery. We were waiting and waiting, we were asking \u2014 I\nknow the people who bou \u2014 built it were Katz(ph), they lived in my city. A young\nson and a fath \u2014 it\u2019s a father and son. We\u2019re waiting for it to be finished, and here \u2014\neverybody\u2019s talking a bakery, a bakery, what else could it be? He finally was\nfinished and it was a \u2014 before we were supposed to be liquidating the camp, and w-\nwe found out it was a small crematorium. It looked like a \u2014 a bakery. They killed\nthe father and son first, they bur-burned them, they were the first ones to burn. We,\nat two \u2014 two days later the commanding officer told us that we\u2019re going to go \u2014\nwe're going to liquidate the camp, and \u2014",
        "A: No, no, I cannot remember. My head were blank after that, I got hit with a lead\npipe and I had \u2014 from hunger and thirst we were just \u2014 you couldn\u2019t think straight.\nOkay, where was I?\nOctober 19, 1993",
        "A: Oh yeah, before we \u2014 before we \u2014 yeah, he \u2014 the \u2014 th-the commanding officer\ntold us that we\u2019re going to liquidate the camp next day. The next day came, they\nasked all those prisoners who cannot walk will go by truck, about a hundred of\nthem, moved out, they marched them straight to the slaughterhouse, and we \u2014 while\nwe were standing in role call, they were \u2014 we could hear the machine guns going\nthat killed them all. They hung six prisoners on wooden poles, and they\u2019d sa \u2014 th-\nthe commanding officer said, the reason why they\u2019re \u2014 that we hung them is\nbecause they de \u2014 tried to escape yesterday.

        "A: I-In August 1\u2014 we started out in August sometimes, that 1\u2014 one thing I \u2014 I will \u2014\nsomehow somebody told us that, one of the SS, what month it is in. August \u2014\nsometimes beginning of August. It was boiling hot outside, the sun was baking us.",

        "A: Yeah, the Russians were \u2014 started to move in, they were \u2014 they were shelling the\narea and they \u2014 they were gonna \u2014 they\u2019re getting closer and they were \u2014 liquidated\nthe camp. So we \u2014 we were marching day and night without food or water and some\nof the prisoners co \u2014 collapsed. They would pick them up, put them in carts and put\nthem in \u2014 then on trucks and ship them to Dachau. Or we buried them off the road.\nI remember where I buried three bodies, three corpse, off the road near a bridge. We\nOctober 19, 1993\nput them on top one another, we dug deep enough to \u2014 just to put in the bodies on\ntop one another. One was still alive on top on \u2014 he was begging us, please [Speaks\nforeign language here] he says [speaks foreign language]. I\u2019m still living. Why\nare you trying to kill me? Why are you two bur \u2014 why are you burying me alive? He\nwas stretching out a hand to us, and the SS kept on hollering. He says, cover him\nup, cover him up. We covered him up, we had to take off. We marched again. They\nhad \u2014 their fa \u2014 con \u2014 I mean, the \u2014 the \u2014 th-the-the prisoners are just falling like \u2014\nit\u2019s unbelievable, they\u2019re just collapsing from \u2014 from hunger and thirst and\ndehydration. You can survive a lot longer from not eating food, but if you don\u2019t\nhave any water \u2014 try to go for water in the sun all day long, marching, without the\nhat, nothing, just in your uniform. We came to a place near \u2014 near a bridge in the \u2014\nsome of the prisoners tried to escape. They jumped over the bridge, tried to escape\nor to get \u2014 to get some water. They send in the German Shepherds after them, and\nthey \u2014 after the germ \u2014 th-the shepherds found them, they went ahead and used the\nmachine gun, boom, boom, boom, they killed them in there. Then we \u2014 we used to\nget \u2014 one day it was raining hard and we were told to go into a forest. We went into\nthat forest and we slept on the ground without coverage, we didn\u2019t have nothing,\njust our uniform. But, I mean it\u2019s th-the \u2014 typhus developed and they were dying all\nover.\nOctober 19, 1993",
        "A: Gosh, I don\u2019t remember. I don\u2019t know, maybe four or five days, I don\u2019t\nremember. I\u2019ve got no idea, just kept on \u2014 it was just \u2014 I was in another world, I\ndidn't even know. When we stopped at that place, we were \u2014 some of the prisoners\nwere digging with their spoons. We very seldom had spoons, we ate by the \u2014 our\nhands. I don\u2019t know where they got the spoons, but they were digging the ground,\nwhere there\u2019s \u2014 th-the ground, there wasn\u2019t too far away from a lake. And we heard\nsometimes after midnight a huge roar, water, water, everybody\u2019s running towards\nwater, water, water. I came over to that place too, with the other prisoners and I see\neverybody\u2019s grabbing handsful, it \u2014 from the ground it\u2019s coming up water about \u2014\noh, about two, three feet, it\u2019s jumping up, pop-popping up.

        "A: To find water, yes, and they found it, came up enough. The-They \u2014 and suddenly\neverybody knew about it, the prisoners knew about it and they ran for water. W1 \u2014 I\nremember grabbing hands full of water with sand and stones and just shoving it into\nmy throat, swallowing, choking myself on the stones. I couldn\u2019t even \u2014 you know,\nit\u2019s hard to believe that \u2014 that \u2014 we \u2014 we were crazy, we didn\u2019t know, we were out\nof our minds. We didn\u2019t know from life or death, we didn\u2019t know what \u2014 who we\nOctober 19, 1993\nare or where \u2014 what we are. We were just oh, completely out. We were \u2014 we were \u2014\nsomething that it\u2019s hard to believe that a human being can \u2014 can survive something\nlike that.",
        "A: No, next day we took \u2014 marched again.",
        "A: We finally arrived to a place where we were waiting for a train. It was called\nKutno. Kutno at the \u2014 at the German Polish border. German \u2014 Kutno at the\nGerman Polish border, yeah. And we were waiting there for a train to arrive to take\nus someplace. It was pouring, it was raining hard. First when we got there, we\nstripped all the bark from the trees. Anything that was available, branches, we just\nate. Grass, whatever we can get ahold on, anything. We were starved, we didn\u2019t\nhave nothing to \u2014",
        "A: Oh, I have got no idea. Four or five days, I can\u2019t \u2014 don\u2019t remember.",
        "A: Without food, without water, skeletons were walking.\nOctober 19, 1993",
        "A: Skeletons were walking. There was nothing \u2014 black lips, with \u2014 with dying\nthere\u2019s no breathe \u2014 you can\u2019t hardly breathe, you\u2019re so weak. And we \u2014 we waited\nin that forest, it was pouring and we were \u2014 were in the mud. We were trying to\nhuddle together so we can get our body temperature warm from one another. That\u2019s\nonly heat we had and the prisoners were starting to die from typhus and all the\ntemperature, they had high temperatures from being sick, and they were dying like f\n\u2014 by the dozens. We could not bury them fast enough. Finally, two days later a train\narrived, a freight train arrived. They packed in in the boxcars a hundred or more\npeople in one boxcar. I remember we were standing like this, in the upright position\nlike sn \u2014 stacked herring. There was no air, no water, no food.",
        "A: No sanitation. They boarded up the little windows from outside, what the freight\ngets. There was \u2014 it was choking inside. We were tearing our heads apart, we were\ntrying to kill ourselves, but we couldn\u2019t. We were tearing our eyes out, we were ki \u2014\npounding on our heads. We ti \u2014 we couldn\u2019t \u2014 we wanted to die, but there was no\nway then there, we couldn\u2019t even take a little step to get a \u2014 to do something, to \u2014 to\nkill ourselves. They just kept on falling and dying, from the weakness some of them\ncollapsed, then the al \u2014 the smell was awful. And we started to get more room once\nsome of them passed out or just \u2014 just couldn\u2019t do any more, couldn\u2019t get it \u2014 go on\nOctober 19, 1993\nany more. We finally arrived to Dachau death camp. I remember seven of us were\nmoved out \u2014 were \u2014 were \u2014 came out from that freight car. The rest of them were\nhalf dead or dead, from the 110. We gets \u2014 as we came down, there was six feet of a\ndrop. The SS kept on sh \u2014 pulling us, you know, gra \u2014 grabbing us with the rifle\nbutts, hitting us and he \u2014 come on, come on [indecipherable] you, and I remember\nthey grabbed me from \u2014 they grabbed me fr \u2014 with one hand, and I fell on my left\nshoulder upside down, because the six foot drop. And I couldn\u2019t move, I kept on\ncrawling, they kept on pounding on my back with the rifle butts. And just [speaks\nforeign language]. And th \u2014I kept on running. I kept on getting up and kept on\ngoing up. I didn\u2019t want to die ab \u2014 I always remember what my father told me at the\nAuschwitz, be strong, don\u2019t give up, we will meet again. I just kept on going. We\nfinally came into the \u2014 inside the Dachau entrance on the \u2014 it was cement floor. I\nremember seeing dozens of skeletons, their eyes in, you know, you could hardly see\nlike eyeballs where goo \u2014 they were just sunk in. And these skeletons, all in black\nlips, all they were moaning and moaning and moan \u2014 I remember I ca \u2014I fell o \u2014I\ncollapsed on my knees and I passed out, and there I fell asleep. When I woke up I\nsuddenly remembered, oh I mi\u2014I got to meet my father again, I better be \u2014 I got to\nbe stronger, I got to keep on going. I got up and moved around a little bit, here and\nthere, and I don\u2019t know, I \u2014 all of a sudden, I dr \u2014 don\u2019t remember any more to \u2014\nOctober 19, 1993\nwhat happened in Dachau, I wounded up in Landsberg lager s \u2014 lager seven, camp\nseven. And that is where I was put on on a night shift to work at Mihldorf, that\nnight shift to \u2014 to build the ammunition factory. We\u2019d [indecipherable] we \u2014 we set\na foundation, the foundation there. We used to work 10 \u2014 10 hours a day. It was\nhard work. I remember one day one of the prisoners collapsed on the ramp with his\nsack of cement. The SS ran over \u2014 two SS ran over and pounded on his head with\nhis rifle butt. And then they \u2014 they asked for \u2014 for the prisoners to help him put on\nthis sandbag. I went ose \u2014 I was one of them, too, I went over and helped to put it\nup, and he couldn\u2019t get up, he couldn\u2019t get up. They went ahead and asked some of\nthe prisoners to take him upstairs and put him in the cement mixer. They put in his\nhead in the cement mixer, and then they took him out, took him back to the \u2014 to the\ncamp, to Dachau. But they just \u2014 just told him to put him in in there to grind him\naround a little bit. Then wa \u2014 there was a German \u2014 there was a German who used \u2014\nwhat do you call these big machines? The cranes. He was digging ground in there,\nand he used to bake potatoes inside that \u2014 they \u2014 they used to have coal in there, he\nused to bake potatoes. He would always have a full loaded oven with potatoes. And\nwe \u2014 if we get a chance, we ran over to him, he would give us four or five potatoes.\nIt was like a steak, 1t was great. Hot, it was just burning, it was just beautiful. He\ntold me once, he says, if they catch me, I hope the SS don\u2019t report me to \u2014 to the \u2014\nOctober 19, 1993\nthe higher authority, otherwise I\u2019m no \u2014 I\u2019m going to be punished. But the \u2014 a lot of\nthe SS knew about it, they saw us doing it, you know, they saw what we\u2019re doing.\nThere was a \u2014 on the also, ag \u2014 not far away was a \u2014 was a garden of vegetables and\nso on. I remember we ran over there, break through the wire and we stole that. We\nkept on eating it while we were there. The minute we brought it in to \u2014 to the other\nprisoners, it was gone. In a minute, it was \u2014 it was gone, they tore at you, they kill\nyou for a piece of bread. So then, from there I was very weak and I said to myself, I\ngot to ta\u2014 I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m never going to survive. I\u2019ve got no energy and I cannot carry\nthat cement. And I see where also some of the weak guy \u2014 people, they bring them\nin from work, put them in a death barrack. Still alive. No doctors, no nothing, no\nmedicines. You \u2014 you cannot work, or your \u2014 something happens to you, there\u2019s the\ndeath barrack, that\u2019s your medicine, death. Death. I decided \u2014",
        "A: Let them die. Let them die.",
        "A: That\u2019s exactly what happened. So one day I came home from \u2014 from work and\none of my friends told me that a friend of mine I used to work with together, you\nknow, we \u2014 some of the times we used to \u2014 he is \u2014 th-they put him in the death\nbarrack. I was anxious to find out who he is. They took me there to him and he \u2014 I\nOctober 19, 1993\nsaw, oh maybe about 40 or 50 bodies. He was hanging with his head down and\nactually li \u2014 looking at us that he is still alive. He was \u2014 he was upside-down like\nthis. We couldn\u2019t go too close because it was typhus in there. Everywhere you went\nin was a dangers you would pick up something. But I went away brokenhearted and\nI said to myself, I \u2014 that could be me next. I was \u2014 I was ready to cry and then I said\nto myself, oh no I better don\u2019t cry, I may be here tomorrow. I decided that I\u2019m\ngoing to steal some potatoes. It wasn\u2019t too far away from a bunker, because I ca \u2014 I\ndidn\u2019t want to die, I wanted to live. One morning I went to the bunker. I tied up my\npajamas, my \u2014 my \u2014 my uniform on the bottom and I went in the bunker, I filled up\nmy pants full of potatoes. Some other p-prisoners encouraged me to do it too\nbecause they were going to give me a piece of bread and they were going to buy\nsome butter for that. So I \u2014",
        "A: Potatoes for something else, yeah, like a piece of bread, or \u2014 or piece of bread or\nbutter, whatever it is. Sometimes they will bring in some smuggling, something\nfrom outside, a candy or whatever. A cigarette. And I filled it up and all of a sudden\nI hear hoo, hoo, the sirens are going.

I ran towards my barrack and I hear the lager\n\u2014 th-the commander 1s asking to go back in the barracks all the \u2014 all the\nLagerfuhrers, all the \u2014 should go back 1n the \u2014 in the barracks and find the\nprisoner, dead or alive. I knew they were talking about me, so I kept on running\ntowards my barrack. While they went inside, I kept on running to my \u2014 towards my\nbarrack. I came to my barrack all out of breath, and we \u2014 my feet are just co \u2014\nloaded, you know, I cannot even run, but I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m robbing the potatoes, so \u2019'm\nlooking like this, loaded. And I se \u2014 run into the second row and I\u2019m standing, you\nknow, attention. Everybody came out, the commander officer a-asked, count the\nmen again, in your barrack. They counted, everybody was there. The commanding\nofficer says, who just came in? Was quiet. He started with again \u2014 who just came\nin? The prisoner next to me pointed a finger at me. Well, they \u2014 they saw my pants\nloaded, they got ahold of me, took me in into a small [indecipherable] they asked \u2014\nthe officer asked one of the kapos in there, Killer, who used to be good doing the\npunishment, torturing. They got ahold of me, took me into a small locker room, on a\nOctober 19, 1993\nheavy piece of wood, put me on there, tied up my hands in a bracket o-over my\nhead, and my knees to a bracket. [indecipherable] I remember he kept on pounding\non me with some kind of a heavy piece of wood, or a two by four. I remember\nscreaming. I remember screaming, and that\u2019s about all. I don\u2019t remember any more.\nI woke up \u2014 I woke up in a \u2014 in a doghouse. I was \u2014 I woke up in a doghouse. I was\ncrammed in with two other prisoners, one was dead and one was moaning. I don\u2019t\nknow how many days I was in there, because I was out, passed out. And one of the\nofficers was \u2014 was inspecting \u2014 one of the officers was inspecting th-th-the \u2014 the\ncamp and he came \u2014 when he went by there, he heard the moaning, he asked, who is\nin there, to open up. He saw us in there, gave him one look with my eyes can hardly\nopen up, he says, let the ma \u2014 let the prisoners loose. I don\u2019t know, first time, you\nknow, so that they carried me in. I don\u2019t know wi \u2014 the other prisoners, what they\ndid with them, but they carried me into my barrack. I couldn\u2019t walk because my\nback was all messed up. And the reason why they did that, because the officer gave\nthe orders. Otherwise so they would put me in the ba \u2014 in the death barrack. They\ntook me into the barrack and they told me I\u2019ve got two days to recuperate and I\nhave to go to work. In the meantime I asked for \u2014 from the Lagerfuhrers \u2014 I mean,\nthe camp |-leader for some food. He said, I\u2019ll give you some food. Did you get your\n\u2014 your piece of bread every day, and you know, at night time soup? I said, no, I\nOctober 19, 1993\ndidn\u2019t get nothing. I didn\u2019t get since I was there. He says, you were there eight days\nand y-you didn\u2019t get nothing? He says, go to the shl \u2014 Lagerschreiber. The\nLagerschreiber was the accountant who let in \u2014 who ope \u2014 when you opened up\nthe gate, he counted the people coming in and going out. He made sure that\neverybody \u2014 that\u2019s whats the \u2014 the \u2014 the Schreiber, the Lagerschreiber. And he \u2014\nhe told me to ask \u2014 he gave me my \u2014 my bread, everything, I should go and ask him\nfor it. | went over and asked him for it, he came downstairs from his \u2014 from his\nbooth upstairs and he came over and I told him what my barrack leader said. He got\nahold of me like this, gave me a bloody mouth. I came back with a bleeding mouth.\nI went back and told \u2014 I told th-the \u2014 the lead \u2014 the ba \u2014 barrack leader what \u2014 what\nI got. He says, well I don\u2019t know what \u2014 what to tell you, but I\u2019Il try to help you. I'll\ngive you some of the barrels to lick out after \u2014 they were wooden barrels of soup.\nAfter everybody has the soup, I\u2019Il give you to lick out the barrels. So I remember\nfor a couple of days I kept on licking out the barrels. Spin \u2014 spin of \u2014 some of the\nwood would come off, you know, splinters, and I would just eat it like bread, I \u2014\nlike food, I didn\u2019t even \u2014 I just swallowed everything what came in. And I got \u2014\nOctober 19, 1993",
        "A: Because he ate \u2014 he sold it for \u2014 for cigarettes, the guy up on th-the scharl \u2014\nLagerschreiber. He did something with it. He \u2014 be \u2014 maybe he ate it, he sold it for\ncigarettes.",
        "A: Landsberg?",
        "A: Yeah, okay. From there I was \u2014 I was told that I have ki \u2014 if I cannot go to work,\nsome of the prisoners told me, if I go on a pa \u2014 role call, to stand straight, because\nthey\u2019re \u2014 they\u2019re expecting \u2014 a couple days later, that one of the days they\u2019re\nexpecting a health inspector. So, I was standing straight, but of \u2014 of course, I\ncouldn\u2019t move my arm, I was sideways. And I was worried that if they get \u2014 the\ninspector sees me, I\u2019m going to \u2014 either he\u2019s going to say I\u2019m not \u2014 no more good to\nwork, they\u2019re going to put me into the death barrack. But luckily there was no\ninspection that day. But they asked for volunteers. They asked for volunteers and\nwe went to dig trenches for \u2014 for the German SS in the forest. We fixed the streets\nand so on.",
        "A: In la\u2014 in Landsberg. Then we \u2014 they asked \u2014 the next day they asked again for\nvolunteers, something else. I always hope there\u2019s going to be better days. If I\nOctober 19, 1993\nvolunteer maybe I\u2019Il get a better treatment or more food. I always hope for better,\nbut I\u2014 I always gambled, and I was never \u2014 never had any luck. This time we \u2014 they\ntook a transport, oh about, I \u2014 I \u2014 two, three truckloads. And we \u2014 they took us to\nLandshut camp. Landshut camp was a \u2014 a German ammunition place, they storage\nammunition. They emptied out a few of the blocks \u2014 a few of the barracks they\nemptied out and they put in some of the prisoners in air \u2014 he \u2014 in case the American\nbombs \u2014 bombers bombed that area, they blow up, we\u2019re going to get blown up in it\ntoo. In the meantime, the SS were there with their ammunition and we were there\nworking also. We were at there, or we were at work. So we were taking by truck to\na railroad s-sta \u2014 we were taking by trucks, not knowing where we were gonna go.\nHere we\u2019re traveling through the forest \u2014",
        "A: To Landshut. It\u2019s a Landshut camp, yeah. It wasn\u2019t too far away, but it\u2019s called\nLandshut camp. Then we went down to, by truck, two truckloads went down to \u2014\nthrough the forest, we didn\u2019t know where we were going. We asked the \u2014 the SS,\nwhere are we \u2014 where are you taking us? They didn\u2019t say where, they said, it\u2019s none\nof your business. So we just \u2014 we were quiet and we were \u2014 th-they didn't hear a\nwhisper. We go through different dark places and here is \u2014 we were just shooking\nup, with \u2014 they\u2019re probably going to kill us someplace. We came a little closer, we\nOctober 19, 1993\nsee smoke going up. Uh-oh, there is the chimneys and there\u2019s \u2014 there is another\nplace where they kill people. We finally came, after 45 minutes or so, we ca \u2014\nfinally came to a place where there was \u2014 you could see civilians, homes, displayed\nstores. My God, we felt the \u2014 already relieved, oh, they\u2019re not going to kill us, we \u2014\nthere\u2019s something different here, w-we \u2014 we see it \u2014 I haven\u2019t seen a \u2014 a woman for\n\u2014 for over a year. And here is a\u2014I am staring at them, it\u2019s a ma \u2014 it\u2019s a pleasure.\nThen suddenly we\u2019re cross \u2014 crossing over railroad tracks and we are \u2014 as we\ncrawled over railroad tracks we see smoke coming up. Right away we thought, well,\nth-this is something different. We\u2019re probably going to work here because they\nbombed \u2014 th-the trains are all bombed all over, smashed up railroad tracks. As we\nwalked \u2014 we got out from the trucks. We walked towards the direction of where that\nbombing was. We saw aftr \u2014 a freight car opened up, one of the boxcars, spilled out\nwhite powder. We didn\u2019t know what it was at that time. But we walked in that\ndirection, and it was smoldering, that white powder. Then suddenly one of the guys,\nsome of the guys started to smell like \u2014 they said it \u2014 they said it\u2019s burning sugar.\nJust like that, they se \u2014 they said burning sugar. And there all of us, all the prisoners\njust started to run on that direction. We were falling on our faces. We kept on\nrunning and running and running. And we got there and sure enough, it was sugar.\nWe kept on grabbing in handfuls hot sugar. I remember grabbing hands, boiling\nOctober 19, 1993\nsugar, we just kept on shoving it in. My mouth was burning and my hands were\npeeling off, I just kept on shoving it in, and the SS were pounding on our heads with\ntheir \u2014 their rifle butts because we were eating the sugar. This time at least \u2014",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: That\u2019s right, they needed to clean up, they needed work.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Sure.",
        "A: That\u2019s where they always used us, for places where they needed work, slavery.",
        "A: That\u2019s right, we got the sugar, it felt so great. Even so, the \u2014 the par \u2014 the SS\nwere pounding on our heads. Th-Th-Th \u2014 most of the time they pe \u2014 beat us for\nnothing. This time they beat us, at least we enjoyed something. So it felt good, but\nOctober 19, 1993\nthen we worked there, you know, tur-turning over th-the railroad cars and cleaning\nup the mess. Then we went back there again, and we worked on the railroad tracks.",
        "A: At night we went back to the camp.",
        "A: To \u2014 to Landshut camp, yes, Landshut camp.",
        "A: Oh, about an hour drive.",
        "A: Ab-About an hour drive from there.",
        "A: In Landsberg, about th-three, four weeks.",
        "A: That\u2019s all.",
        "A: Landshut? Oh, I don\u2019t know, the \u2014 Landshut, it was very short time, maybe\nabout three weeks, because th-th \u2014 let me just ke \u2014 go back again \u2014\nOctober 19, 1993",
        "A: \u2014 because that\u2019s something interesting. One day while we were working, the\nsirens were going, the American bombers came. They ri \u2014 the SS told us to run and\nthe soldier ran \u2014 ru-run into the forest. We ran into the forest, a few minutes later\nwe see the American bombers diving. We could see the bombs falling and we are so\nhappy we are gonna be free by the Americans. We didn\u2019t even know who the\nAmericans were, but we were \u2014 we were happy about it. Then there was another\ntime we came out to work, this same thing happened, the American bombers are\nagain there. This time they\u2019re blowing up the railroad tracks. Everywhere you go\nthey\u2019re blowing the \u2014 everything is on fire. You don\u2019t see a soul no place. After it\nwas first finished, it was quieted down, some of the prisoners started to walk around\nas, you know, walked around to see what\u2019s happening. As we walked through \u2014 we\ncame over a \u2014 we walked over a railroad bridge, and on the left hand side there was\nabout 24 small planes. The American bombers \u2014 we still watched how the American\nbombers were using that 44 machine gun, I don\u2019t know what they call it, but they\nwere machine gunning the \u2014 th-the gas tanks and blowing up all the \u2014 all \u2014 all those\nplanes. I would \u2014 kept on watching them, how they were blowing up like \u2014",
        "A: The German planes, they were popping up like \u2014 like popcorn, they were just\nblown up right after one another.\nOctober 19, 1993",
        "A: It was sometimes in April?",
        "A: Yeah, \u201945, April 45. And then we went back to our truck, our truck was blown\nup to pieces. Our truck wasn\u2019t there, so we didn\u2019t know what to do. A lot of the\nprisoners escaped. I was afraid to make the escape, I could have escaped too, but I\nwas afraid. I was afraid because of being beaten and I couldn\u2019t take no more pain,\nbecause I still felt the pain in my head from the lead pipe and beating all the time at\nwork. So I was afraid, I didn\u2019t want \u2014 want to gamble. We finally got a truck, we\ncame back. Here we \u2014 we are going \u2014 the next day we went out to work to build\nagai \u2014 to dig again branches for the German soldiers. We are not getting any more\nfood, it\u2019s already three or four days, we\u2019re not getting no food, we didn\u2019t go to work\nno place. We see the Germans are removing out their ammunition, we watch \u2014 were\nwatching them taking it out.",
        "A: N-N \u2014 oh yes, the commanding officer wasn\u2019t there, no, the commanding officer\nwasn\u2019t there, but he was still in charge. When we went out \u2014 when we went out to \u2014\nto dig the trenches, he would come out with his motorcycle to inspect. He would\nbring along a 15 foot white, long whip like you train animals and he would whip us\nOctober 19, 1993\nfrom \u2014 from far away he would flip \u2014 whip us. But I \u2014 I \u2014 I remember I couldn\u2019t\nwork too much because of my shoulder and I kept on \u2014 the minute I saw the \u2014 the\nwhip coming, I bent down and you know, I felt sorry for the taller prisoner who got\nhit. But he would just take it out on the prisoners because they were losing the war.\nAfter awhile \u2014 nek \u2014 it would \u2014 didn\u2019t take too long, we see the bombs are flying, it\ndi \u2014 it lights up the skies, artillery, it\u2019s going crazy. It \u2014 suddenly, we were ordered\nnext day to march to the railroad station. We came to the railroad station \u2014",
        "A: Y-Y-Yes, Landshut\u2019s rail station. They loaded us in in \u2014 in boxcars. We didn\u2019t\nknow where we were going. They closed up the doors. We are \u2014 as we made \u2014 we\ncame \u2014 we dro \u2014 traveled about 25 minutes, the train stopped again to let go by a\nGerman train loaded with ammunition and \u2014 and artillery, everything is loaded. You\ncould see their \u2014 their faces are sad, they \u2014 they \u2014 they know that s-something\u2019s\nwrong and they don\u2019t like to go the \u2014 those places. But the \u2014 one of the locomotive\nat that station went in to got some water. After he left, I was a may \u2014 maybe about a\none of \u2014 and a half car away from \u2014 from that spout, and there was another sp \u2014\nprisoner also with me. And I \u2014I said to myself, boy it would be nice if I could go\nover and take a bath inside the tank, or just take a good drink of water. So after he\nleft, Iran over and that other guy, the other prisoner ran over too, were holding up\nOctober 19, 1993\nour ma \u2014 hands to the drip, the drips were coming in. And it felt so good to have a\ncouple drops of water, it felt great. And the SS were chasing us back to our \u2014 to our\nfreight car \u2014 to our cars. So I didn\u2019t \u2014 but our guard was helpful. Then we took off\nagain. We k-kept on going for maybe another 35 \u2014 40 minutes on the train and\nsuddenly we are sh \u2014 moved in, and the train made a sudden stop. We didn\u2019t know\nwhat happened, whether it was a \u2014 just everybody was falling on top of another.\nBefore it if \u2014 1f \u2014 1n a few seconds later we hear the bombers are diving in, bombing\nour train. The American bombed our train by mistake. They knocked out lik \u2014\nlocomotives, a lot of the pers \u2014 a lot of casualties were there. And after the first\ntime, they came back the second time, some of the prisoners threw their stripe\nuniforms on top of the \u2014 of the \u2014 of the boxcars. When they came back they turned\naround and took off.",
        "A: But the \u2014 we found out that one of the trains, German trains that was chasing a\nGerman art-artillery train and he \u2014 they went by and they got us by mistake. That\u2019s\nwhat we were told. But anyway \u2014",
        "A: Well, no, I didn\u2019t, but maybe somebody else did. I was afraid. I was afraid\nbecause I wanted to come back alive, I \u2014 my father\u2019s \u2014 I wanted to see my father\nOctober 19, 1993\nagain and I had also hope that some of my family would sur \u2014 survived. We took o\n\u2014 tha-that train was out of commission, we couldn\u2019t go no place. Everything was a \u2014\nhad a \u2014 we were just waiting. The SS didn\u2019t know what to do with \u2014 with us. The\ncommanding officer is gone. We were just sitting in front of the freight cars and\ntalking. It came later in the afternoon, the SS commander \u2014 officer comes to me, he\nsays [indecipherable] boutonnicre and with his [indecipherable] in his hand, and\nhe said \u2014 oh, no, the SS hollered, oh, everybody I \u2014 in attention. Everybody th \u2014 is\nat \u2014 is at attention, and we\u2019re shaking from fear because he would only come when\n\u2014 when there are bad times, when something \u2014 somebody did something wrong or\nhe\u2019s going to do something bad. He says, you are a-all liberated, you are free to do\nwherever you want. Oh my God, are you sure? You heed a \u2014 he-heard wa \u2014 you\nheard a you sure and everybody started to run over the railroad tracks, and wheat\nfield, corn field. I remember running with a few other prisoners over the railroad\ntracks and we ran into wheat fields and cornfields and while we\u2019re running, I see\nsome other ama \u2014 prisoners who are running with me are falling down. I said run,\nrun [indecipherable], but they \u2014 they didn\u2019t get up, another fell, another one fell.\nAnd ga \u2014 they didn\u2019t get up. I just kept on running, I said to myself, maybe they\u2019re\nweak, they cannot get up. I kept on running. I saw a sign while I was running, I saw\na sign [indecipherable] and then I saw a big building in there. I ran towards the\nOctober 19, 1993\ndirection. I came in to \u2014 toward that building, there was a little delicatessen in there.\nI ran in the side of delicatessen, the owner over the counter got ahold four slices of\nwhite bread and gave it to me. I squashed it together like a \u2014 like a piece of ball and\nI just shoved it down, I could hardly swallow it, but I \u2014 it went down.",
        "A: Oh yes, prisoner\u2019s uniform, yes a \u2014 my skin was coming off for \u2014 from dirt. We\nnever got a \u2014 took a shower or anything. There wasn\u2019t enough water to drink. Lice\ncrawling on \u2014 on our lower \u2014 black, everything was black. So he \u2014 he \u2014 he gave me\nanother tats \u2014 he turned around and gave me another one. Two guys are sipping\ntheir coffee and talking and they\u2019re looking at me like a \u2014 somebody \u2014 a wild\nanimal walked in in here, th-th-th-they couldn\u2019t see me \u2014",
        "A: Germans, yeah. So all of a sudden I hear ooh hoo, ooh hoo, the ger \u2014 th-th-the\nsou \u2014 the si-sirens are going. So suddenly th-the he \u2014 the German over the counter\nsays, laufen zie(ph) he says, run into the barn an-and cover yourself up with straw.\nThe two men got up from the \u2014 from the \u2014 who were sipping coffee and came\noutside and showed me which way to go, that was about 150 feet away. I ran \u2014 and\nran inside fast, cover myself up with hay. It didn\u2019t take more than a few seconds, I\nhear [speaks German] Come on out or I\u2019Il kill you.\nOctober 19, 1993",
        "A: It was quiet. He started over again [speaks German] and somebody sneezed.\nThere were \u2014 he asked for one of the SS to go over in that direction, pound with a\nhay fork, he telled, take that hay fork and go ahead, pound in that area. They hit a \u2014\nanother prisoner with the hay fork.",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t know at that time.",
        "A: Yeah, I didn\u2019t know, it was just \u2014 there was \u2014 I was \u2014 I was there just because\nthey told me to. So they pounded in that area there and \u2014 and I heard a real loud\nscream. And then I jumped up, and I saw another je \u2014 prisoner jumped up. We went\noutside with a ho \u2014 handle \u2014 hi \u2014 hand up, the SS 1s right behind our back with their\nbayonets, and we marched out the door. I see outside the door there\u2019s a Jeep and the\ncommanding officer motorcycle. When we came out fro-from the barn, I saw a \u2014\nthe \u2014 th-the commander\u2019s officer motorcycle was in th \u2014 1n the driveway and a\nJeep. The commanding officer gave orders for the two SS to go back to their post,\nand while he was talking to them, the-the \u2014 one of the \u2014 the prisoner who was with\nme, helding his head up high, he started to run. The SS officer grabbed his gun and\nshot him maybe about 10 feet away from \u2014 from him. And then he \u2014 after the two\nOctober 19, 1993\nSS left on a motorc \u2014 on \u2014 on \u2014 on their Jeep, he sat down on this motorcycle, took\nhis gun in the left hand and he hollered at me, he says, run. [speaks German]. He\nsays, run. If you cannot run I\u2019m going to kill you. I started to run and run \u2014 ran. I\nwas weak, I couldn\u2019t run, I kept on beg \u2014 I kept on falling. He coo \u2014 he would cock\nhis gun, I ta\u2014I begged him please, I have to meet my father again, I cannot die yet.\nHe s \u2014 kept on running, I ke \u2014I kept on falling and getting up and he kept on\ncocking his gun. I-I wouldn\u2019t give up, I kept on fighting to stay alive, begging him\nwhile I was out a \u2014 with \u2014 without a breath.

He told him, if you ever come back I\u2019m gonna wait for you next time with\na bayonet, I'll blow your head off. He started to run, he said, Itzhak, run, run, run\nfor your life. I kept on running, running and I \u2014 when he told me that I couldn\u2019t\nbelieve it. I couldn\u2019t believe it, I was crying and I was so bitter about it.

So we got back there and we were sitting waiting for a train, you never\nknew when a train is gonna come, two, three hours, four or five hours. It was about\none or two o\u2019clock in the morning, we are waiting still. There were some FBI\nagents, you know, like, they\u2019re not FBI, th-they \u2014 they called them \u2014 what \u2014 what \u2014\nwhat they call them, the \u2014 in Russia, the \u2014 I cannot recall them, but anyway, they \u2014\nthey \u2014 th-they were \u2014 NKVD they called them",
        "A: Yeah, they were watching everything and checking out outside and inside. They\ncame and checked out everybody who was waiting at the station there, their\npassports. Everybody\u2019s was fine, my brother\u2019s was fine, he was liberated, he was a\ncaptured prisoner in Russia, that he had this paper that he was \u2014 he \u2014 that he was a\nOctober 19, 1993\nke \u2014 prisoner, he was free now. But I was \u2014 I got papers from Germany, and I w-\nwas born in Czechoslovakia. The papers said I was born in Czechoslovakia,\nChust. They called me in inside and th-th-th-the little room in there, at that station\nand this one NK VD\u2019er(ph) tells me, he says, you were born here, your papers said\nyou were born in Chust, Czechoslovakia, this is where you belong. You\u2019re not\nleaving this place. This is your country, your home. I said to him, I have to meet my\nfamily if somebody survived in Germany, I have to go there. Maybe later on I'll\ncome back after I\u2019m finished. He says no, you cannot go no place, you \u2014 I\u2019m sorry,\nyou gotta stay here, that\u2019s your home. Suddenly while were ti \u2014 I\u2019m arguing with\nhim and I\u2019m ra \u2014 crying, he \u2014 suddenly we heard some shooting outside, fire \u2014 they\nwere shooting, gunfire. He started run out, I ran after him. And the minute I ran\nafter him I s-s-saw my brother, I said \u2014 I told my brother, run for your life, let\u2019s go\nto the big station. We took off, ran ou \u2014 toward the big station. We tripped, we \u2014\nmaybe took us a half an hour, 45 minutes to get there. We tripped all o-on \u2014 on\nrailroad ties, we fell in chuckholes. We \u2014 we came bloodied up to the big station\nwith our knees, but we finally made it. Here we\u2019re waiting in there for th \u2014 for the\ntrain didn\u2019t come yet and we are hoping that there\u2019s going to be room on it because\nmost of the time the trains were \u2014 came in so loaded, people are hanging onto the\nsteps, they were standing on the steps, they couldn\u2019t get on. So I finally \u2014 we \u2014\nOctober 19, 1993\nfinally the train came, we got in, we couldn\u2019t get on. So everybody was climbing on\ntop of the roof, so we \u2014 I remember I \u2014 I ran from one place, it was dark, 1t was after\nmidnight, two or three o\u2019clock in the morning. I ran from one place to another and I\nfinally saw some people are trying to help one another to get up. I figured Pll \u2014 PIl\nget up too. They helped me to get up to the top of the roof. On top of the roof you\nwere pretty safe, but when the Russians came up there to ask you for money or \u2014 or\n\u2014 or th-they\u2019re gonna kill you for watches, you had to give \u2014 you \u2014 there was tsoris.\nThere were problems. And I \u2014 a-anyway, the train started to move. Every \u2014",
        "A: Everything was fine, we \u2014 we were on our way going back to \u2014 I was supposed\nto go back to Germany. I said, I don\u2019t have for a pass, I\u2019m gone \u2014 the pa \u2014 I know\nmy pass is gone, I don\u2019t have nothing. They \u2014 he too \u2014 th-the civilian took away my\npass. We are coming to the small station, the train starts out, and it\u2019s going \u2014 my\nheart is feeling ba \u2014 faster and faster, I hear the train is going and I said to myself,\nboy if \u20141f we stop at that station, the small one where \u2014 where we \u2014 we were\nwaiting, we ran away from, and th \u2014 th-that civilian is waiting for me, the NKVD is\nwaiting for me, I'll be in trouble, they\u2019re gonna take me off.

        "A: Anyway, we got \u2014 we got \u2014 we g-got \u2014 came closer by and the train just flew \u2014\njust went by, whistled loud and went by, didn\u2019t stop because there was no room no\nplace, every seat was taken. I thank God, my God, I\u2019m safe, I got \u2014 I fooled them,\nI\u2019m out of \u2014 from Chust, I\u2019m out of it. So we finally, on the way going, the \u2014 y-you\ncould see th-the \u2014 the \u2014 some of the p \u2014 some of the people would stand up and the\nelectric wires, or telephone wire were \u2014 were across, and if you got up too high fro\n\u2014on top of the roof, you were just picked up by the wire and you\u2019re knocked off.\nNext to us that happened to one of the guys. He got up to change places with\nsomebody else. He didn\u2019t lower his head en-enough, or he just came \u2014 he picked his\nhead up and \u2014 he picked himself up just in time, when he came near the wire and he\ngot blown off from the \u2014 from the train.",
        "A: Oh, I\u2014I don\u2019t know.

Then \u2014 then we \u2014 the \u2014 there \u2014 there was \u2014 it depends what kind of a train\nwe took. Sometimes we had to go on our circuits around, sometimes they went\nstraight, they were going different directions. Nobody [tape break] okay, we\narrived, and my brother was supposed to be on \u2014 on that train, too. And \u2014 from\nOctober 19, 1993\nDebrecen to \u2014 to Prague.

We finally\ncame out to an open space, about 20 minutes we were running like that. At wit \u2014\nand we came to a place where he said, you\u2019re safe now.
