        "Q: Why don\u2019t you just state your grandmother\u2019s name and the date of birth if you can\nremember that.",
        "A: My grandmother\u2019s name was Etta Moscowitz.",
        "Q: Etta?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Moscowitz, can you spell that for me?",
        "A: Uh, let me write it.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Do you remember where she was born?",
        "A: She was born in Volosyanka.",
        "Q: And do you remember how old she was?",
        "A: She was about eighty.",
        "Q: She was eighty years old?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And that was, she was eighty, do you remember when?",
        "A: When they took her to Auschwitz.",
        "Q: In 1942?",
        "A: Between \u00b042 and \u00b043, I\u2019m not, you know. I think it\u2019s been documented when\nthese people had been taken to Auschwitz from where I come from.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s see, she grew up in Volosyanka.\n1",
        "A: And she lived there. You see Jews lived there for years.",
        "Q: Did she, she was married to your grandfather who you were telling me about",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Can you tell me his name?",
        "A: His name was Sander. Matter of fact my grandchild is named after him. They\ncall him short Seth.",
        "Q: Seth?",
        "A: Seth.",
        "Q: S-E-T?",
        "A: Yes. SETH. Seth. But at home they used to call him Sander Moscowitz.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: He was eight-six. That I know for sure. Because he would cry. Oy, what\nhappened to him.",
        "Q: Um, now you said your grandfather was a very religious man. Was your\ngrandmother also?",
        "A: Sort of. But women didn\u2019t show it. Women didn\u2019t worship as much as men did.\nHe was terribly upset with God that he didn\u2019t die. You know, he had no fear of\ndeath. He had no fear of death because he was so religious. He felt he goes to,\nyou know. I remember in the ghetto when they took him to the square. More\nolder people that had beards. He had a long beard, not just a small beard, but a\nlong beard. He never got cut his beard because of religion. So, they got these old\nmen on the square and they were cutting their beards with scissors and they were\nbeating on him. So um, you know he was bloody and my mother was the\ndaughter, so my mother finally got to him. You couldn\u2019t go to rescue him\nbecause you would get shot. I mean you wouldn\u2019t get beaten up, you would get\nshot. So she couldn\u2019t go rescue, but when they were finished beating him up and\ncutting his beard, we brought him home and he was just crying terribly and we\nthought he was crying because he was full of pain. You know, his face was\nbloody and black and after a few days the man just couldn\u2019t stop crying so, uh we\ntold him we understand he must be in terrible pain from the blows he got. He\nsays no, he doesn\u2019t cry out of pain but he, it\u2019s not him, he felt so humiliated. So\nmy mother took a scarf and she put around his face and tied it on the top and put\n2\nhis hat on, he wore a black hat and somehow that made him feel better. He\nstopped crying. So, so. And that\u2019s how he went to Auschwitz a few days later.",
        "Q: That was just before.",
        "A: Just before. I just don\u2019t understand. I don\u2019t understand why they needed to do\nthis to him. They knew that he would wind up in Auschwitz. What happened\nwas that they kept us in a ghetto until they accumulated enough Jews to put in\ntransport. Because you know the trains were many and long.",
        "Q: Um, do you remember what your grandfather did for a living? What he had\nworked at before?",
        "A: Yeah, they had a store, they were selling flour there and sugar. It wasn\u2019t a big\nstore.",
        "Q: Kind of like a grocery store?",
        "A: Yes, a small grocery store. Yes, small. It wasn\u2019t a Giant.",
        "Q: And both your grandmother and your grandfather worked there?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And that was in the town?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Do you know when they got married?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: And, um how many children did they have?",
        "A: Oh, they had ten boys and two girls. And the two girls, when I was growing.\nYou know, I have pictures of about six boys and one was in the United States and\na few of them died, but they had a lot of children.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: I have pictures. My mother was the daughter and then I had an aunt.",
        "Q: Um, was your mother, in that family. Was she one of the older ones or one of the\nyounger?",
        "A: Well, in between.\n3",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Do you remember, I know it is probably difficult for you to remember, but do\nremember them talking about, or even your parents talking about when the\nGermans, the Nazis, came to power in Germany in the \u201830\u2019s.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Do you remember, were they frightened at all, were they apprehensive?",
        "A: Very, very. But I'll tell you, as I talk in the tape. If you see the tape. We knew\nsomehow the Jews have suffered through the last 2000 years, I\u2019m sure you know\nhistory. But this has never happened before to no group of people. So as much as\nwe were frightened and scared, but we didn\u2019t fear actual death and destruction,\nthe kind that has happened. You know they felt, well, they are going to take the\nmanpower and they are going to work them, or they are going to do things like\nthat. But to take small little kids and gas them. We did not expect that.",
        "Q: Right. But your parents were scared?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: They were frightened of them.",
        "A: Of what he was saying. He was actually saying what he was going to do. But,\nyou know, I think human nature has a way of protecting themselves. They don\u2019t\nwant to think of the worst.",
        "Q: Yeah, you said something about what he was actually saying, what Hitler\nproclaimed and these kind of things in speeches. Were there radios and these\nkind of things in your town? Not many?",
        "A: When we were Czech. Then when the Hungarians came in, there was no radio.\nWe had to hand in the radios. And the newspaper, the news was just not available\nany more. But there were some people who had hid a radio and they would come\nwith some news. But, people wouldn\u2019t even believe such things, you know what I\nmean? Ifthe person that had the radio, and they would come and they said they\nsurrounded some Jews and threw them down the balcony or killed them for no\nreason, it was a little bit difficult to --- to.",
        "Q: To believe?",
        "A: To believe in the beginning. But then again and again, and again and again they\nwould clean out a town. Then they started cleaning towns. Then we ready\nunderstood.\n4",
        "Q: Did refugees from Germany, German Jews or Polish Jews come in to\nCzechoslovakia, do you remember seeing any?",
        "A: No, no. They didn\u2019t. But you know, of course, I don\u2019t think this has anything to\ndo with my life. But when the Germans occupied Poland we lived near the Polish\nborder, at that time that was. So the Polish soldiers were going through our town.",
        "Q: They came through your town.",
        "A: Yeah, when they had the war within a week or 10 days they occupied Poland. I\nmean, I don\u2019t know, maybe two weeks.",
        "Q: A very short time.",
        "A: Yeah. So, I remember that.",
        "Q: When did the Hungarians come in and occupy\u201d?",
        "A: \"39.",
        "Q: Um, do you remember especially, you told me about the cutting of the beard of\nyour grandfather and things like that. Do you remember any other instances of\nanti-Semitism directed against you or either your parents or your grandparents or\nanything like that before/\\?",
        "A: Well, you see it was sort of quiet while the Czechs were there. It was sort of, you\nknow, we had a democracy. So we were allowed to go to school. Matter of fact I\nhave an uncle that was a Czech officer and he was a college graduate because\nthey allowed the Jews to go to school. But then the Hungarians came in in \u201939\nand that was already, the schools were closed for Jewish kids and the synagogues\nwere closed. But, you know I remember I had a teacher, there were so many\nchildren we had a teacher in the house who was teaching us. You know we called\nit a cheder.",
        "Q: Yeah. So, did your grandparents live very far from you?",
        "A: No very close, that was my happiness.",
        "Q: But you didn\u2019t live in the same house or anything.",
        "A: No, I had very good grandparents. We were also seven kids so I had loving\nparents, but you know I was the sixth child. So I wasn\u2019t getting that much\nattention because there was no time. They loved me, so my grandmother would\ngive me all the attention, she would talk to me. I remember she was a big comfort\nto me.\n5",
        "Q: Do you remember what kinds of things you would talk about?",
        "A: The fear. The fear. As little as I was, I remembered she feared. She worried,\nwhen the war will be over, what will happen to us. That\u2019s what I remember the\nmost.",
        "Q: Do you remember talking to her in the late 30\u2019s.",
        "A: Yeah, when the Hungarians came we already felt that. The Jewish young guys\nwere taken to a work camp. They weren\u2019t soldiers anymore. The Czechs, they\ndid take the Jews to be soldiers. We sort of had, the Czechs we were sort of\ntreated like first class citizens.... Not first class. I mean we didn\u2019t feel it so bad.\nIt\u2019s the Hungarians, when the Germans came there was already murder, it was\nalready completely disaster.",
        "Q: Do you remember, can you describe for me your grandparent\u2019s house?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Do you remember and where was it situated in the town?",
        "A: They had a stone house, a stone house. And they had lots of cows and horses and\ngoats and you know, it was like a family in a smaller town. It was like a normal\nfamily, a big family. And on Saturday nobody worked so we would get together\nand we would have meals together.",
        "Q: At their house?",
        "A: At their house, yes. And Ill tell you, me as a child. I thought I was a happy child\nbecause you know, my uncles loved me and I was a child and it was, to me it\nlooked like a happy situation.",
        "Q: Was the store that they owned separate from the house?",
        "A: No, it was sort of ----here were the living quarters and there was like a long room\nand they kept the ----that\u2019s where the store was",
        "Q: Can you tell me a little bit about how things changed once the Hungarians came\nin? especially for your grandparents, how it changed their lives.",
        "A: Well, you see, I'll start with my grandparents. That\u2019s why it\u2019s better when you\nask me because I go in from one to another. Um, when the Hungarians come in\nthe Jews could no longer have stores even. The Jews could no longer do things,\nyou know, because when you had a store you needed a permit. And you know,\nthey took it away from you. So they had to close the store. And, you say, how\n6\ndid they live, but they had some piece of grounds, and they had the cows that\nmade milk and made the butter and potatoes, they put potatoes in the ----- you\nknow, they had potatoes. It wasn\u2019t a wonderful life and you know, they didn\u2019t\nlive in a house like I\u2019m living. They had two rooms. You know, they would\nsurvive. To give you an example, my parents by the Czechs, they had store, it\nwas a shoe store.",
        "Q: This is your parents.",
        "A: My parents had. They made a living room out of that. But as soon as the\nHungarians come in it was taken away from them.",
        "Q: They took the store away.",
        "A: Yeah. I mean, I\u2019m just showing you an example.",
        "Q: Sure. Were there restrictions. I know that when the Germans came in to many\ntowns they put restrictions on what the Jews could wear, when they could be\noutside, where they could shop, that kind of --- did the Hungarians do the same\nthing?",
        "A: No, we didn\u2019t have to wear a yellow star by the Hungarians.",
        "Q: I remember in Poland, I\u2019ve spoken to people, they say they couldn\u2019t walk on the\nsidewalk, they had to walk on the street and they couldn\u2019t do certain things, go to\nparks.",
        "A: When the Germans came, but you see when the Hungarians came they restricted\nus to certain extent that we tried not to be invisible. Who went to the park? I\nmean, we wouldn\u2019t do that. We wouldn\u2019t. Even when they wanted to worship, it\nwas in secret. It was in somebody\u2019s room. And then you watched, you shouldn\u2019t\nbe seen going in there too many times, you see. Then they didn\u2019t worship every\nday anymore. If they could get to it on Saturday they would be glad to do it. I\nmean, you know these old religious people because they were afraid of God.",
        "Q: Did, so your grandparents then would worship, they couldn\u2019t worship every day\nor they would do it.",
        "A: Well, he would do it by himself but not anywhere in a group.",
        "Q: So they closed the synagogue.",
        "A: Oh, yeah.\n7",
        "Q: Do you remember anything else under the Hungarians that your grandparents may\nhave had to do, or were they forced to give up some of their property or any of\ntheir livestock, that kind of thing.",
        "A: Well, because it was a war. They were taking it from the non-Jews too actually.",
        "Q: So, they were taking it from everybody.",
        "A: They were taking it from everybody, because the war was going on and there\nwasn\u2019t enough food so, it wasn\u2019t that people lived by laws, there was no law. I\nmean, any hooligan. If you beat up a Jew, he wasn\u2019t persecuted. There was no\nplace to go to complain. There was a place, we did have police. But, you\ncouldn\u2019t go complain somebody beat me up, because you would get more.",
        "Q: Right, did that happen often? Do you remember people getting beaten up?",
        "A: Sure, sure. Children, you know, it was very funny. It was very funny because by\nthe Czechs, you know, when we went to school we went with our neighbors. And\nwho were our neighbors, the non-Jews. And I always thought, I walk to school\nwith this non-Jewish child and I really thought, I mean, I always thought it was\nmy friend. You know, as a child you play with this kid, you know, this is my\nfriend that I play with. But as soon as the government has changed and gave the\nred light to vandalism, maybe the people were scared or something. You see, I\ndon\u2019t know. So I lost my, I immediately lost my friend, my play, you know, my\nplaymate. You see, they didn\u2019t want anything to do with me. I mean, I\u2019m telling\nyou from my point of view, as a child what bothered me. My father bothered\nbecause he didn\u2019t have to give us a piece of bread. But....",
        "Q: Did your grandparents ever, um, did they ever tell you things like you were saying\n--to try to be invisible. Did they say things like that to you, tell you not to go out\nin the street at certain times or anything like that.",
        "A: You know a child is now looking back on it. If there was a wedding, let\u2019s say\nthere was a non-Jewish wedding. By the Czechs we would go and watch the\nwedding. I liked to go and watch a wedding, so I went and I watched a wedding\nand I came back and, you know, I was let free by the Czechs. But when the\nHungarians came, you know, my mother wouldn\u2019t let me go anymore. I\u2019m just\ngiving you a small example that she wouldn\u2019t let me go because everybody in\ntown knew I was Jewish and therefore I was . Do let\u2019s say there\nwere even 10 good non-Jews, but you would always find one that would want to\nget me over the head. You know what I\u2019m saying?",
        "Q: Uh, huh, okay let\u2019s see. So.",
        "A: I jut gave you an example. Or let\u2019s say, lots of examples.\n8",
        "Q: Go ahead.",
        "A: But, I don\u2019t want to take too much ---- I mean this was just that a child\u2019s,\nespecially because I was a little girl I liked to look at a bride or something. But\nmany things, at night definitely you wouldn\u2019t go out. Oh, definitely you wouldn\u2019t\ngo out. Like, you know, if we needed, then if went to the store they would sell us,\nthey would sell us if we had the money, they would. But, well, we\u2019re still talking\nabout the Hungarians now or the Germans?",
        "Q: The Hungarians, yeah.",
        "A: Okay, like, I wouldn\u2019t be allowed, the children weren\u2019t allowed no more to go\nlike to the store. Sometimes my uncle would give me 25 cents and I would go\nand buy an ice cream. I no longer, they wouldn\u2019t allow me to go by myself. You\nknow, if they brought it into the house, you know. At that time there was no\nmoney to, you know. At that time if my mother could get some different things to\nsurvive, but you know, they wouldn\u2019t let us go out. My brother would go and get-\n--- then they also took him away too, uh. I had an older brother than this.",
        "Q: Older than this?",
        "A: Yeah, I had an older brother. But then they took him away to work, you know.",
        "Q: What was his name?",
        "A: His name was Larry, my son 1s named after him. We called him Libel, but my\nson is named after him. His name is Larry.",
        "Q: uh, huh. Can you tell me a little bit about when the Germans came? You know,\nwhat year it was and what happened, how life changed at that point.",
        "A: Well, when the Germans came, they right away said that the Jews can not only,\nthey could only go out, let\u2019s say, a couple of hours a day. Not only at night, a\ncouple of hours a day and if you found a Jew on the street, you know, wanting to\nbuy something you could be shot for that or you could be taken away to this\nconcentration camp which eventually wound up in Auschwitz. So the Jews had to\nwear the Jewish stars, even children. And then the non-Jews were not allowed to\nsell to Jews or aid them in any way. You see they gave, when the Germans came\nalready, Pll tell you, I don\u2019t blame the non, at that time, you know I read now, I\nknow there were some very righteous non-Jews that really, what they did, I don\u2019t\nknow if I would do it today when I have children and grandchildren because\nwould they aid a Jew, they would be taken away to a concentration camp. So the\npunishment was so tremendous of aiding a Jew that he himself wasn\u2019t safe. I\u2019m\ntalking the non-Jew wasn\u2019t safe. That was by the Germans, by the Germans.",
        "Q: Do you remember when the Germans came to town?\n9",
        "A: I think it was between \u201942 or \u00b043, but you know, I am not sure exactly.",
        "Q: I can look it up.",
        "A: Yeah, because you have the town and I\u2019m sure.",
        "Q: Uh, how long, now you said, and you told me the story about your grandfather\nhaving his beard cut and everything before they were deported.",
        "A: That was after they took us away from home into a ghetto.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: That wasn\u2019t while we were home. But, when the Germans came, though, they\nworked so fast, they worked so fast. If I, within weeks they took us to a ghetto,\nwithin weeks and they put us into the ghetto.",
        "Q: So you were taken away to the ghetto within a few weeks of them coming into\nyour town.",
        "A: Yes, within weeks, it wasn\u2019t months.",
        "Q: And they took every Jew in the town, whoever was Jewish in the town they took\nto the ghetto?",
        "A: Yes, yes. Now you see, it\u2019s true. You know, I\u2019ve always had this color, now I\nhave to put a little color because I am white. But I was always this color so when\nI talk many people ask me, you don\u2019t look Jewish. I say how is a Jew supposed to\nlook? So, it wasn\u2019t, what happened was, the non-Jews handed us over to the\nGermans. You know what I\u2019m saying?",
        "Q: They pointed you out.",
        "A: Yeah. Even we had to have a Star of David on the house too. But, let\u2019s say they\ndidn\u2019t know that my parents had seven kids. But, the non-Jews, so there was no\nplace to hide and they were afraid to hide us because if they\u2019re gonna find us then\nthey\u2019ll go where we are. So it was a no-win situation there.",
        "Q: Can you tell me the name of the town that the ghetto was in?",
        "A: Uhzgorod, it was a bigger town. It was a city, I would call that a city already.",
        "Q: How far from your town was it?",
        "A: I\u2019m not sure.\n10",
        "Q: Not very far or a long way.",
        "A: No, it was maybe an hour ride with a train. It wasn\u2019t ----",
        "Q: So they put you on trains. Was there a train station in your town?",
        "A: Yes, there was a train station in our town.",
        "Q: So, did you all go together -- your family, your grandparents?",
        "A: My grandparents and the stronger uncles were taken away to work. My brother\nLarry was taken away to work. My brother Saul was taken away to work. But\nthe rest of them, the smaller children. That\u2019s another thing, you know they\nplanned that so by the time they came to take us to the gas chambers that there\nwasn\u2019t enough strong manpower, they left the old people, the little kids, the\nwomen, the older, you know. They planned it so just in case ----",
        "Q: So there wouldn\u2019t be any resistance.",
        "A: And another thing that they ask me many times, well how come you didn\u2019t fight\nback? Jews were such law abiding citizens that not only that, but 1f somebody\nwould have found it was against the law to have a gun in the house. So, you\nknow, Jews just didn\u2019t keep guns in the house. I spoke in front of officers, Navy\nofficers, and that was their first question and I understood what they were saying,\nit\u2019s just that I don\u2019t know if I could have given them a sufficient enough answer of\nthe situation that was there. When you don\u2019t have a gun and you don\u2019t have the\nmanpower anymore, how can you fight? Then nobody really knew that you\u2019re\ngoing to a gas chamber, it was a big secret.",
        "Q: Often times a German would tell you that you were going to work or something\nlike that.",
        "A: Relocated. They said they need manpower to work.",
        "Q: Uh, huh.",
        "A: But, I\u2019ll tell you, the way they dealt, we should have known something is horribly\nwrong. The way they dealt with a human being, if they wanted to make us work,\nyou don\u2019t go and beat someone to death or beat someone half dead, you know. It\nwas, you know, we weren\u2019t dealt like we were human.",
        "Q: Yeah. Can you describe to me a little bit about what you remember of the ghetto\nin Uhzgorod?\n11",
        "A: Well, also again they didn\u2019t keep us long in the ghetto either because it was like,\nyou know. I think they knew when we were there that the war, now looking back\non it they didn\u2019t keep us long in the ghetto either. But, the living quarters, the\nghetto was a brick factory, they emptied out a brick factory, it was big. There\nwere no beds or kitchens in a brick factory, so we brought some blankets with us,\nyou know we carried certain things and they gave us a little place there in the\nghetto where we stayed, where we had our little place on the floor. Then they\ngave us rations, soup, you know, in the morning coffee, and at night soup. Of\ncourse the living quarters were horrible, there was no place to wash and the kids,\nthere were no bathrooms. So, it was a horrible situation. And the worst of all, we\ndidn\u2019t know what would happen next. All we saw is that every day they brought\nin more Jews, more Jews. We just didn\u2019t know what they were going to do with\nus.",
        "Q: How long did you stay there, do you remember? Not very long?",
        "A: probably months, just maybe, I don\u2019t know. Maybe a month or two at the most.\nFrom what I remember, it wasn\u2019t, you know like the Polish Jews were in ghettos\nfor years, but this wasn\u2019t a work ghetto. The Polish Jews were in a work ghetto.\nThis was not a work ghetto.",
        "Q: This was more like, maybe a transit point?",
        "A: Yeah, they got us together and shipped us to Auschwitz. Because at that time\nalready they had the capacity, you see with the Polish Jews they didn\u2019t probably.\nThey didn\u2019t have the capacity of destroying that many, so they had to kill them by\nbullets. So, you know, it was different. But with us, they could gas thousands of\nthem.",
        "Q: So, let\u2019s see, you were there for a month maybe two months?",
        "A: Months, I would say months.",
        "Q: Somewhere in there. Now, would this be in \u00b043 or still in \u00b042 or right around ---",
        "A: Right around the middle, between \u00b042, \u201943 maybe. Let\u2019s say \u201943 already.",
        "Q: And then you were deported to Auschwitz.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: In a train?",
        "A: Yes, in a cattle car train.",
        "Q: Uh, huh.\n12",
        "A: And then, I\u2019Il tell you, when I think back on that ride, you know they put so many\npeople into that cattle car. We had no bathrooms, small kids, sick people, they\njust packed us in there. You know, if they would have taken us to work\nsomeplace they wouldn\u2019t have done to us what they did. Just even the transport,\nthat in itself should have said something to us. But we couldn\u2019t imagine, we\ncouldn\u2019t imagine that we\u2019re going to the gas chamber. We couldn\u2019t imagine that.",
        "Q: Did, so your grandparents are still with you. Were they in the car with you?",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: Can you tell me what happened when the train came to Auschwitz?",
        "A: Well, it stopped. It stopped and the smell. You\u2019re probably going to see, I think I\ndo tell ---",
        "Q: In the tape.",
        "A: I tell the day in Auschwitz, one day in Auschwitz I think I tell. And, um, you\nknow. If you want me to [Il tell you.",
        "Q: Go ahead.",
        "A: I can tell it again? Because I want to tell you new stuff, not repeating myself.\nWhen we stopped in Auschwitz they didn\u2019t open up the door, we didn\u2019t know\nwhere we were. We just saw a big sign that said, you know, a round sign. It was\nlike this, and it says \u201cArbeit macht das Leben suss\u201d\u2019, and that means in English,\nwork makes life sweet. So, but still the smell was terrible, the smell was terrible\nand there was a big fire, like a big building or something was on fire. You could\nsee far in from the tracks, but they didn\u2019t open up the wagons until it got\ncompletely dark, I mean it was dark, dark. All of a sudden floodlights came on\nthe train and we saw these SS there on the platform, you know, and dogs, dogs.\nAnd they opened up the doors and started screaming, \u201cHeraus! Heraus! Heraus!\u201d\u2019\nAnd, you know from that trip a lot of people died because they threw in sick\npeople and old people and so whoever could run out from this train, they were\ngoing out. If not you were beaten up. So they rushed so that they shouldn\u2019t get\nbeaten, but a lot of them that stayed there they just carried them out and put them\non the truck. There was a truck, a big open truck, was right there, you know, not\nfar from the platform. Everybody tried taking out the few things that they had for\nthem, not that it was anything but, everybody is trying to survive, so they think\nthey\u2019 ll be needing it.\nSo there was a ditch and they were yelling at the people they should throw away\nthe luggage, and people didn\u2019t want to part with it. One was screaming \u201cI don\u2019t\nhave the name on it!\u201d They were worrying that they\u2019Il never find their luggage\n13\nbecause they don\u2019t have the name on it. So there was sort of a commotion, so\nthey were hitting on the people and they got beaten up, they threw away those few\nlittle things that they had there. But, with my grandfather he didn\u2019t want it, he\nwas getting beaten up, but he wouldn\u2019t part with it. And so, you know what they\ndid to him. Should I repeat, should I say it again?",
        "Q: You can, go ahead.",
        "A: The tape is on? So he didn\u2019t want to part with these Ten Commandments, with\nthis Torah. So they were beating on him. We were pleading with him \u201cThrow it\naway! Throw it away!\u201d He didn\u2019t want to do it, so they beat him, they kicked him\nand then he could no longer get up. He was there and then they were beating on\nus to go to the right, to the left. And what I remember seeing 1s that they just took\nmy grandfather and they threw him on the truck because he couldn\u2019t get up\nanymore and the Torah, the Ten Commandments were in the ditch. And me and\nmy sister they put us to ride with my mother and my mother held on to my\nbrother, she wouldn\u2019t let go of him.",
        "Q: Now, this was your youngest brother?",
        "A: That was my youngest brother, he was six years younger than I was. She\nwouldn\u2019t let go of him, so they started beating on my brother so she let go. But,\nshe didn\u2019t know that they\u2019re going to put him to the left, that they\u2019re going to put\nhim on the other side and my brother screamed and cried and there were other\ncries from other children. But, she sort of, she must have recognized his cry so\nshe looked back and, you know, he was trying to go to my mother, so they were\nhitting on him and so my mother ran to him from the right to the left and they\nwouldn\u2019t let her go to the left. So, they were beating on my mother, she fell and\nshe was crawling and pleading with the SS, \u201cPlease let me go to my kid! Please\nlet me go to my kid!\u201d\u2019 So, finally after she was on the floor and pleading with him\nand, I don\u2019t know, change of heart, he kicked her and she went to the left. You\nknow, he kicked her and she sort of moved to the left. She ran to my brother and\nshe got a hold of him, and, you know, my brother cried anyway because he saw\nmy mother so beaten up. And they walked off, Pll tell you the truth, you know,\nwhen I think if, sometimes, moments I said, I bet my mother would survive. But,\nright after the war I knew she would have not survived anyway, so I say to myself\nmaybe a good thing that happened, you know there were so many kids they went\nto their death so frightened, so scared because they didn\u2019t have their parents with\nthem. Now, the little infants, they didn\u2019t know, but the four, five, six year old\nchild, it was dark, it was dark. In the beating, you know, they were hitting on\nchildren. You would think they would leave children alone. If the child, let\u2019s say\ndidn\u2019t obey what they said, if 1t wanted to go here or there they were they were\nhitting on kids like they hit on adults. And why they needed to do that I don\u2019t\nunderstand, why they needed to hit on kids. And, so I say to myself, maybe she\nwas a comfort to another child there, I\u2019m sure. You know, she had seven kids\nand, so ---- so that\u2019s how my mother left to her death.\n14",
        "Q: So when they split you to the right people who ended up, at least at that point,\nsurviving and the people who were on the left went to the gas chamber.?",

I\u2019m not sure why they did that, but uh, if there was any correction in our\nbehavior, you know kids act up sometimes, so they would quote us from the Bible\nwhat is right and what is wrong.

        "Q: So your parents knew about things that were going on in Germany and Poland or\nthat kind of thing.",
        "A: More or less, when Hitler, we knew when the German, uh, what was his name,\nuh, when Hitler became, got the power, the leader, we knew. We knew.",
        "Q: In 1933, yeah.",
        "A: We knew when Hitler got to power.",
        "Q: Was there ever any, when the Hungarians come in, was there ever any discussion\nin your family about possibly leaving at all\u2019? There was?",
        "A: We wanted to come to the United States, but, you know, because I had my sister\nhere. But, we couldn\u2019t no longer. Now where could we have gone? We were\nsurrounded, in Hungary the Jews were treated like we were treated, in Romania,\nJews were treated like we were treated. If you see Czechoslovakia in the middle -",
        "Q: No place to go?",
        "A: No place to go. There was no place to go.",
        "Q: Okay, now let\u2019s see, we talked about your father and your mother and how, what\nhappened to them once they went to Auschwitz and they were with you the whole\ntime when we talked about you going from the ghetto in Uhzgorod and then on to\nAuschwitz\u2019. So, I basically know their story, you\u2019ve told me that. And your\nfather, you said, you were split so the last time you saw your father was when you\ncame off the train, but you don\u2019t know what happened to him at all, okay.",
        "A: But my brother, my brother, told us when he came that he met up with a man that\nwas with my older brother and my older brother ---\n24",
        "Q: Now this was Saul, your brother that you were talking about?",
        "A: Yeah. Now, I\u2019m going to talk about Larry, that he actually survived all this time,\nbut when they were taking him back as the Russian or the ---",
        "Q: After the war, you mean?",
        "A: No, that was almost the end of the war, he died of starvation in a train because\nthey were taking him away. You see, what they were doing 1s that they were\npicking, you know you have these grenades on the floor, let\u2019s say, you know\nwhen the Russians retreated, when the Germans, before the Germans would make\nany steps they would send out these Jewish boys to the mine fields.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So they would pick up, you know. So that\u2019s what happened. He survived that.",
        "Q: He went through, he was actually in one of those, your father was?",
        "A: No, my brother. But, what happened was he died of starvation because when they\nhad to retreat, they were retreating and taking these, whoever was left, a handful.\nThey weren\u2019t giving them to eat or anything or sleep, so he just ---That\u2019s what\nsomebody told my ---",
        "Q: Told Saul about Larry?",
        "A: Yes. But, you know, could he have survived maybe the starvation he would be\nalive because he survived ---",
        "Q: He got through the camps.",
        "A: Yes. But, you know, I wasn\u2019t there.",
        "Q: Sure, I understand. But the last time you heard anything about your father was\nwhen you got off the train?",
        "A: That was it.",
        "Q: Why don\u2019t you tell me about, well, we can start with Saul since he survived. Do\nyou remember, let me. Saul Leibowitz was his name. Do you remember his\nbirthday?",
        "A: Uh, I should, I think he was born in \u201923.",
        "Q: Uh, uh. So he was about five years older than you were?\n25",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Do you remember what month and day he was born? Do you remember when\nyou used to celebrate his birthday?",
        "A: Uh, I don\u2019t know exactly and I don\u2019t want to tell you when I\u2019m not sure.",
        "Q: Do you remember if it was in the fall or the spring or ---",
        "A: I can find out.",
        "Q: Okay. If you have a record of 1t somewhere you can call me and tell me.",
        "A: All right, all right, P\u2019Il do that.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s see, so basically, did your brother go to public school under the Czechs?",
        "A: Under the Czechs, yes.",
        "Q: Is there anything special about your brother\u2019s childhood that was maybe different\nfrom yours, that maybe stands out in your mind?",
        "A: Well, he had more responsibilities than I did.",
        "Q: What kinds of things?",
        "A: Well, let me tell you, he helped my father with small little jobs like, let\u2019s say, a\nnon-Jew, it was forbidden for a non-Jew to ---by the Hungarians they were\nallowed, by the Hungarians the Jews couldn\u2019t own anything. But the Jews were\nallowed to work for the non-Jews sort of. So he used to ---",
        "Q: And this is under the Hungarians?",
        "A: Yes, we are talking now about the Hungarians. So he would go and help my\nfather to ---",
        "Q: Oh, so you did, you mentioned something about after the Hungarians came your\nfather worked to try to help support.",
        "A: Little jobs.",
        "Q: Odd jobs or something?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And so your brother helped him?\n26",
        "A: Right, right.",
        "Q: Did he also have more responsibility on the farm, did he deal with the cows or the\nsheep?",
        "A: Well, I'll tell you under the Czechs we had a bigger farm, but under the\nHungarians we no longer had the farm, except they let us have a few cows and a\nfew chickens. But, as I said, even under the Hungarians they were taking from\nthe non-Jews too, but the non-Jews, the grounds still belonged to them. You see\nwhat I\u2019m saying? They took the livestock. But the ground, they could own the\nground, but we no longer owned the ground.",
        "Q: Okay, had your brother completed school, had he finished the public school\nbefore the war started, or before 1939 when the Hungarians came in?",
        "A: You know what, we can figure that out.",
        "Q: How long did people go to school, when did they start school?",
        "A: He went to high school.",
        "Q: He did go to high school?",
        "A: My oldest brother finished high school.",
        "Q: Larry did?",
        "A: Larry did, I don\u2019t know if he fully did finish.",
        "Q: Do you remember what age they would have finished high school?",
        "A: Well we started at six.",
        "Q: At six?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And how many grades were there, do you remember?",
        "A: Like here.",
        "Q: So it would be about the twelfth?",
        "A: Yes, it was like here.\n27",
        "Q: So, let\u2019s see, in 1939 Saul would have been about sixteen, so he would have been\nclose.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Did he, so I guess he never had a job, like a real job before the Hungarians came.",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Saul I\u2019m talking about.",
        "A: No, he just helped my father, you know.",
        "Q: Was he involved in any activities in the town, like a sporting club or something?",
        "A: No, there wasn\u2019t such a thing.",
        "Q: There wasn\u2019t any clubs?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: What did he do for amusement, do you remember what he liked to do? Did he\nlike to fish or did he like to ---",
        "A: You know, it is so difficult to explain a child\u2019s life then and a child\u2019s life here,\nwhen I see my grandchildren, may God keep them well. Um, it\u2019s just like,\nchildren were just not children, children were like old people. What they worried\nabout is how to survive, how to see the sadness. Let me say this, by the Czechs it\nwasn\u2019t so visible, but as soon as the Hungarians came in, the children were no\nlonger children.",
        "Q: They grew up fast.",
        "A: They grew up fast, they grew up fast.",
        "Q: Did he like to do, did he have any hobbies when he was younger?",
        "A: Well, he liked reading.",
        "Q: He liked to read?",
        "A: Oh, he loved reading, he loved reading. Any book that you know, books were\nscarce. I know that, you know, a Torah is a holy thing, but you wouldn\u2019t believe\nthat a book to us was a holy thing. Any book that you got a hold of, I remember\nwe had a breakfront, what do you think was in that breakfront, a book that we got\na hold of. It was, everybody read it, and we read it. We used to dust the book, the\n28\ndust shouldn\u2019t fall on it. That\u2019s how scarce a book was. So I tell you when I\ncame here to this country and I had my children, I kept on telling them how, you\nknow, privileged. My children knew when they go to school they are privileged\nto be able to go to school. They are privileged to have an access of books that\nthey could have.",
        "Q: Could use, yeah.",
        "A: You know, it\u2019s like, to us books were like jewels. Yeah, that was a good word,\nlike jewels.",
        "Q: So he like to read a lot?",
        "A: Oh, we all, in that respect, because there wasn\u2019t that much that kids could do. So,\nwhat do you get? You know, so when you read a book your mind was\npreoccupied. Your mind was occupied.",
        "Q: You could get away.",
        "A: From your sadness, from your uh ---",
        "Q: Before the war, before the Hungarians came, did you all like to do things, in the\noutdoors, did you play a lot or did you go fishing or ---",
        "A: Well, we played like kids play. You know, we hop scotched I remember, and I\nplayed with non-Jewish children hopscotch, I remember.",
        "Q: Did your brother, did he have some, a lot of, non-Jewish friends, or did he have\nmostly Jewish friends?",
        "A: Well, when we went to school by the Czechs we had non-Jewish, we thought they\nwere our friends. You know like kids, you don\u2019t think which synagogue, which\nhouse of worship you go. Kids don\u2019t think like that, so who cares?",
        "Q: Okay, when you were deported to the ghetto, okay, you said something about\nyour brother being taken away for work.",
        "A: That was before the ghetto.",
        "Q: Okay, can you tell me a little bit about that, what he was doing, do you\nremember?",
        "A: That was another thing, you know. My mother, they took them away and we\ndidn\u2019t get mail from them, the mail wasn\u2019t coming. So, I remember, in the\nbeginning, the mail would come, maybe, very, the beginning we would get a\n29\npostcard from them. So, my mother, we didn\u2019t have much, so my mother used to\nbake cookies and send them little packages, you know of cookies.",
        "Q: And this was under the Hungarians, that you said the mail wasn\u2019t coming.",
        "A: Right. But occasionally we did get, in the beginning. So then the mail stopped,\nso I remember how she carried on. She felt that they are not alive anymore\nbecause we weren\u2019t getting any mail. So, my mother was preoccupied with that,\nthat they took away her sons and, you know, that they\u2019re not alive. There was no\nway to find out where they were.",
        "Q: So both Larry and Saul were taken away to work?",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: Was your father also taken away or no?",
        "A: He was taken away to work in town, but he could sleep at home. You see what I\nmean? But the boys left and we didn\u2019t, you know, we didn\u2019t see them again.",
        "Q: So they were in the work camps and when you were deported they didn\u2019t come\nwith you, they stayed in the camps or whatever.",
        "A: Well, wherever they were, yeah.",
        "Q: Did you know because of the little bit of mail that came where they were?",
        "A: Golly, I don\u2019t remember. That was just at the beginning, you know, just as a child\nI remember my mother was excited baking cookies to send to them and then she\nwas sad because she could no longer send them cookies and being that they don\u2019t\nwrite, they\u2019re not alive anymore, so she was mourning. You know, I remember\nher crying over that, that her boys are probably not alive anymore because we\ndidn\u2019t get the mail.",
        "Q: When were they taken away to go to the work camps, do you remember?",
        "A: that was after the Hungarians came.",
        "Q: So, it would have been in 1939?",
        "A: Well, maybe a little while later.",
        "Q: Maybe 1940?",
        "A: Something like it, yes. I was a little kid so I don\u2019t remember the exact time.\n30",
        "Q: And you said that Saul survived.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Did he tell you where he had gone, what happened to him?",
        "A: Yes, he worked in different places, in different places under the Germans. Then,\nthe Germans took over these Jewish ---\nQW: Was he in Hungary still or, I mean in Czechoslovakia still or ---",
        "A: No, he was in Poland and in Russia and all over the place, all over the place.",
        "Q: Was he also in any concentration camps?",
        "A: He wasn\u2019t in Auschwitz, he was only in the work camps and they got liberated by\nthe Russians, marching,",
        "Q: Do you know where they were marching, do you remember, did he tell you? Was\nit a death march?",
        "A: Well, sort of. Yeah, they were marching them and then one night the Russians\njust showed up, yes.",
        "Q: So this was in 1944 maybe, or 1945?",
        "A: The dates I\u2019ve got a problem. Let me tell you how he survived. What happened\nwas when the Germans were marching these guys, at one time they rested up\nsomeplace. You know, it was a place, I don\u2019t know what, a farm. He called it,\nlet\u2019s say a farm. So he sneaked away and went in under the hay, you know he\ncovered himself up with hay until the next day the Germans left with the group,\nbut he had a problem, he had a problem when the Russians came, he had a\nproblem to explain himself, where is he coming from, where has he been? So,\nyou know, when he would tell me these stories I, myself, couldn\u2019t believe what\nthis guy had to go through just, even, after the war, how the Russians kept him\nlocked up. But then he was telling the story how, you know, so finally they\ncaught up with the group, so they knew that he must be telling the truth because\nhe knew about the group and it was lucky that they caught up with them a short\ntime later so they told him to let him go because, who knows, they could have\nthought he was a spy and they could have killed him.",
        "Q: Right, sure.",
        "A: So that was the lucky part, so even if he wanted to survive he could have gotten\nkilled after, after war for different reasons.\n31",
        "Q: So he survived and then he was kept in Russia after the war?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Do you know where in Russia he was?",
        "A: Well, the last place he lived was Uhzgorod.",
        "Q: Oh, so that was in the part of Czechoslovakia that turned into Ukraine.",
        "A: To the Ukraine, and the Russians occupied it.",
        "Q: So he lived there and then he came to the U.S.",
        "A: Yes, I can call you up and tell you exactly when he came because we brought him\nout.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And did we have a time, also.",
        "Q: Was this in the seventies or the eighties?",
        "A: Seventies, I think it was the seventies when we brought him over. I\u2019Il tell you the\nexact dates because we have the papers. That I can give you the exact date.",
        "Q: Okay, that\u2019s good. Why don\u2019t you tell me the name of your sister, who was Sura,\nor is that Sylvia?",
        "A: Sylvia.",
        "Q: Sylvia\u2019s in the picture?",
        "A: Sura never went to that accidentally, you know, you see what the Germans did in\nthe beginning they just gassed everybody that came to Auschwitz. But, when we\ncame at that time the German munitions factory already said don\u2019t kill them all\nout, send me the manpower. That\u2019s where I worked the munitions factory. But,\nso that\u2019s how I survived. But, my sister, they probably would have grabbed the\nkid out of her hand but she was short and skinny, sort of, so you know, they\nweren\u2019t paying much attention to her. So she got away walking to the gas\nchambers with her child. I mean, it was like, you know, a freak accident.\nProbably would have been worse for her if they would have taken the kids out\nbecause her kid was really small.",
        "Q: Sure.\n32",
        "A: Who knows what was worse, who knows?",
        "Q: Okay, do you remember when Sylvia was born, what year she was born 1n?",
        "A: Yea, 1925.",
        "Q: Do you remember her birthday?",
        "A: February the tenth.",
        "Q: February the tenth?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: She was closer in age to you.",
        "A: Yes, I was born in \u201928.",
        "Q: And, let\u2019s see. Did she, was she also in public school there, under the Czechs?",
        "A: Yes, but, you know she didn\u2019t finish. But you\u2019d be surprised, we tried so hard to\nstudy even in our own little private cheders, what we called them.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And that was our outlet, you were asking me whether we had ---this was our\noutlet, to get a pencil and paper and write or, you know, number work. I used to\nlove number work, actually I loved it. A piece of paper was difficult, so it was\ndifficult all around. My kids grew up that they were privileged, they had enough\npaper and pencil. I didn\u2019t tell them the rest of the horror stories, but I just made\nthem --- I really still feel that a child that is, that has the privilege of an education\nand doesn\u2019t take, that doesn\u2019t say, you know, my daughter went to college, my\nfirst daughter went to college, I said to her, you know, you are privileged to be\nable to go to college. And I really think she was there and she felt, you know,\nsomething terrific is happening to her. I really think she felt like that.",
        "Q: Do you remember, let\u2019s see, you said because your brother was older that he had\nsome more responsibility in your family. Did your sister also since she was a\nlittle bit older than you?",
        "A: Yes, we would go and wash floors for other people and clean. I mean, because\nthere were a few doctors there.",
        "Q: Now was this under the Hungarians or was this under the ---\n33",
        "A: Under the Hungarians, not the Czechs. The Hungarians, a matter of fact, should I\ntell you, I remember even me, I used to go and help out, you know. We were\nglad, because what happened was when I went to help out, to do these chores, you\nknow somebody gave me a slice of bread. You know, I don\u2019t know, I also felt\ngood that they asked you to come. Actually, you felt good that they asked you to\ncome in to their house to help them out with these chores.",
        "Q: It was probably nice to be away from the house sometimes, too.",
        "A: It was, it was ---well, I can\u2019t say it was nice because I had to wash the bathrooms,\nI had to wash the clothes and, you know, I was a little kid. I wasn\u2019t that old,\nmaybe 12 or 13 years old when I was doing it. But, it was okay, because that\u2019s\nhow we were surviving, you know what I\u2019m saying?",
        "Q: Sure.",
        "A: And they weren\u2019t beating on us.",
        "Q: Right. Did you, I mean you and your sister, since you were closer, did you play a\nlot together?",
        "A: Yes, we fought a lot and we played a lot. Yes, but we were very close. Matter of\nfact, I think you\u2019re going to hear in the tape that, probably if not for her, I\nprobably would not have survived. I'll tell you why -- because I\u2019m not that strong\nwilled and I, oh I know, many times I just didn\u2019t want to, like when I was in the\nmunitions factory, I was tired and I was hungry and I was, I was half dead. So, I\ndidn\u2019t want to get up in the morning and these people, that they didn\u2019t get up in\nthe morning, they were left in the barracks when we worked. You never saw\nthem again, they probably, you know, we just never ---nobody asked. We never\nsaw them again. They probably just did away with them. So, I would want to do\nthat and she would lift me up and she shook me in the morning. She dragged me\nout, but 1t was cold, you see where we were in Germany it was very cold and,\nhere, you know, we had these wooden shoes and the one dress. So, she would\ndrag me out to stay there for an hour, you know, and she would encourage me,\nshe would give me, you know half a slice of her half slice of bread so that I\nshould just go on, go on. She would do a lot of work for me that, you know, I\ncould not work so hard, she just --- But, in the end, I remember in the end, you\nknow, she said she\u2019s not going to leave me here alone. She would get angry at\nme, she would get angry at me because I say, \u201cI\u2019m going to die\u201d. You know, to\nher it was a threat. To me it was real, mentally, with me In think my mental stage\ngave up So ---you know, I don\u2019t care anymore, so if not for her I probably\nwouldn\u2019t be sitting here and talking.",
        "Q: On the tape, do you talk about her quite a bit and where you went, did you always\nstay together through the camps?\n34",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: Did she also survive?",
        "A: Yes, yes. In the end, I don\u2019t know if I put that on the tape. When they brought us\nto Bergen Belsen, she was the first one to get sick because when we got to Bergen\nBelsen was when (tape ended)\n(Beginning of tape 2) Let me ask you about your smallest brother, about your\nyoungest brother. Now, let\u2019s see you said your, that was Efram, Efram?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Do you remember when he was born?",
        "A: Well, matter of fact, I do remember when he was born, I was a little girl myself.\nBut, 1t was like, we were already six, but there was sort of an excitement when he\nwas born. You know, being that he was the youngest, all the kids sort of felt that\nhe was their little toy.",
        "Q: Right, he was the little baby, yeah.",
        "A: So everybody was involved with him, you know.",
        "Q: So, now you said he was born six years after you.",
        "A: After me.",
        "Q: So that would have been about 1934?",
        "A: Yeah, right. No, \u201936, wait a minute, I was born in \u201928.",
        "Q: So six years later would have been \u201934. If you were born in \u201928, six years would\nhave been \u201934 because ---",
        "A: Okay, okay.",
        "Q: Do you remember his birthday?",
        "A: No, no,",
        "Q: no, okay. Had he started school yet in 1939? Probably not.",
        "A: No, because we were under the Hungarians, you know, he used to come into the\ncheder and just, sometimes, annoy, they would throw him out of the room. But,\n35\nyou know, most of the time they would keep him there. Sometimes he would be\ngood and sometimes, you know.",
        "Q: Was he mischievous as a little boy?",
        "A: He was a little, yeah, he was a spoiled little kid because the kid it wasn\u2019t so much\nthat my mother and father had that much time for him, but, you know, he was like\nthe kid\u2019s toy. He was a loving little kid, so everybody picked him up and hugged\nhim and I think that\u2019s what made him so loving because he had so many people.",

        "Q: did he like to read too?",
        "A: oh, he just had an aleph-beis book. I remember it, and I\u2019m telling you he would\ncarry this book along and he wouldn\u2019t show just anybody, he had to be your\nfriend in order for him to show you that book.",
        "Q: What kind of book was it?",
        "A: Aleph-beis, it was like an A-B-C book, in Yiddish they called it an aleph-beis\nbook, he called it the aleph-beis book, but it was the A-B-C book, A-B-C book,\nand he loved that book, he loved it, he carried it, he went to sleep with it, like who\nknows what. But, you know to get to a book like that wasn\u2019t so easy either in the\nwar, So it\u2019s ---so, it wasn\u2019t like this book could be replaced so easily. You know,\nfor my children\u2019s birthdays and my grandchildren\u2019s birthdays I always, well for\nmy children\u2019s birthdays it was a trend, it was always a book. But even for my\ngrandchildren\u2019s birthdays when they were little I always went and bought a few\nlittle books and send it to them for presents, I don\u2019t know why, but this was, they\nknew when their birthday would come, they\u2019Il get books from me, little books.",
        "Q: Books are a good thing to give, they make you smart.",
        "A: Well, I mean, you see, an American child does not understand that a European\nchild, even a non-Jewish child was not that lucky to get this education. A lot of\npeople don\u2019t, it was when I was raised, when I was raised, maybe now it\u2019s\ndifferent. Probably it\u2019s different, here it\u2019s different too. But, when I was raised a\n36\nbook was, or an education was scarce. People didn\u2019t have the money, and didn\u2019t\nhave the means.",
        "Q: Did your parents teach you, you said they were very educated in Jewish history\nand things like that, did they teach that to you?",
        "A: They did, and they also used it. If I think back, like let\u2019s say I did something that\nthey didn\u2019t like, they would bring out a quote from the Bible, what\u2019s wrong and\nwhat\u2019s right. Like they would tell me, you know, they would say God gave you\nthat you can choose from right and wrong, now, do you think God would be\nhappier with you if you choose the right or the wrong? They didn\u2019t understand\nthat me as a child could not, many times, understand what I\u2019m doing wrong. And\nit\u2019s not that I did such terrible wrong, you know, maybe I didn\u2019t like something\nthat they told me to do and I didn\u2019t want to do it, you know ---so, what I\u2019m trying\nto say 1s that they used their education sort of raising us. There was never\nphysical, I don\u2019t ever remember, even when we were seven kids, there was never\nphysical, you know, abuse.",
        "Q: Punishment or anything?",
        "A: No, no, there was no physical punishment but there was a lot of Bible quoting, we\nhad to do the right thing. Children don\u2019t always know the right thing, and\nchildren sometimes they want to laugh, and sometimes they want to fight, you\nknow.",
        "Q: Well, I think I know your brother\u2019s story with your mother, so I think that\u2019s all the\nquestions I have.",

        "A: Between \u00b042 and \u00b043, I\u2019m not, you know. I think it\u2019s been documented when\nthese people had been taken to Auschwitz from where I come from.",
        "A: And she lived there. You see Jews lived there for years.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: His name was Sander. Matter of fact my grandchild is named after him. They\ncall him short Seth.",
        "A: Seth.",
        "A: Yes. SETH. Seth. But at home they used to call him Sander Moscowitz.",
        "A: He was eight-six. That I know for sure. Because he would cry. Oy, what\nhappened to him.",
        "A: Sort of. But women didn\u2019t show it. Women didn\u2019t worship as much as men did.\nHe was terribly upset with God that he didn\u2019t die. You know, he had no fear of\ndeath. He had no fear of death because he was so religious. He felt he goes to,\nyou know. I remember in the ghetto when they took him to the square. More\nolder people that had beards. He had a long beard, not just a small beard, but a\nlong beard. He never got cut his beard because of religion. So, they got these old\nmen on the square and they were cutting their beards with scissors and they were\nbeating on him. So um, you know he was bloody and my mother was the\ndaughter, so my mother finally got to him. You couldn\u2019t go to rescue him\nbecause you would get shot. I mean you wouldn\u2019t get beaten up, you would get\nshot. So she couldn\u2019t go rescue, but when they were finished beating him up and\ncutting his beard, we brought him home and he was just crying terribly and we\nthought he was crying because he was full of pain. You know, his face was\nbloody and black and after a few days the man just couldn\u2019t stop crying so, uh we\ntold him we understand he must be in terrible pain from the blows he got. He\nsays no, he doesn\u2019t cry out of pain but he, it\u2019s not him, he felt so humiliated. So\nmy mother took a scarf and she put around his face and tied it on the top and put\n2\nhis hat on, he wore a black hat and somehow that made him feel better. He\nstopped crying. So, so. And that\u2019s how he went to Auschwitz a few days later.",
        "A: Just before. I just don\u2019t understand. I don\u2019t understand why they needed to do\nthis to him. They knew that he would wind up in Auschwitz. What happened\nwas that they kept us in a ghetto until they accumulated enough Jews to put in\ntransport. Because you know the trains were many and long.",
        "A: Yeah, they had a store, they were selling flour there and sugar. It wasn\u2019t a big\nstore.",

        "A: Do you remember, I know it is probably difficult for you to remember, but do\nremember them talking about, or even your parents talking about when the\nGermans, the Nazis, came to power in Germany in the \u201830\u2019s.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Very, very. But I'll tell you, as I talk in the tape. If you see the tape. We knew\nsomehow the Jews have suffered through the last 2000 years, I\u2019m sure you know\nhistory. But this has never happened before to no group of people. So as much as\nwe were frightened and scared, but we didn\u2019t fear actual death and destruction,\nthe kind that has happened. You know they felt, well, they are going to take the\nmanpower and they are going to work them, or they are going to do things like\nthat. But to take small little kids and gas them. We did not expect that.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Of what he was saying. He was actually saying what he was going to do. But,\nyou know, I think human nature has a way of protecting themselves. They don\u2019t\nwant to think of the worst.",
        "A: When we were Czech. Then when the Hungarians came in, there was no radio.\nWe had to hand in the radios. And the newspaper, the news was just not available\nany more. But there were some people who had hid a radio and they would come\nwith some news. But, people wouldn\u2019t even believe such things, you know what I\nmean? Ifthe person that had the radio, and they would come and they said they\nsurrounded some Jews and threw them down the balcony or killed them for no\nreason, it was a little bit difficult to --- to.",
        "A: To believe in the beginning. But then again and again, and again and again they\nwould clean out a town. Then they started cleaning towns. Then we ready\nunderstood.\n4",
        "A: No, no. They didn\u2019t. But you know, of course, I don\u2019t think this has anything to\ndo with my life. But when the Germans occupied Poland we lived near the Polish\nborder, at that time that was. So the Polish soldiers were going through our town.",
        "A: Yeah, when they had the war within a week or 10 days they occupied Poland. I\nmean, I don\u2019t know, maybe two weeks.",
        "A: Yeah. So, I remember that.",
        "A: \"39.",
        "A: Well, you see it was sort of quiet while the Czechs were there. It was sort of, you\nknow, we had a democracy. So we were allowed to go to school. Matter of fact I\nhave an uncle that was a Czech officer and he was a college graduate because\nthey allowed the Jews to go to school. But then the Hungarians came in in \u201939\nand that was already, the schools were closed for Jewish kids and the synagogues\nwere closed. But, you know I remember I had a teacher, there were so many\nchildren we had a teacher in the house who was teaching us. You know we called\nit a cheder.",
        "A: No very close, that was my happiness.",
        "A: No, I had very good grandparents. We were also seven kids so I had loving\nparents, but you know I was the sixth child. So I wasn\u2019t getting that much\nattention because there was no time. They loved me, so my grandmother would\ngive me all the attention, she would talk to me. I remember she was a big comfort\nto me.\n5",
        "A: The fear. The fear. As little as I was, I remembered she feared. She worried,\nwhen the war will be over, what will happen to us. That\u2019s what I remember the\nmost.",
        "A: Yeah, when the Hungarians came we already felt that. The Jewish young guys\nwere taken to a work camp. They weren\u2019t soldiers anymore. The Czechs, they\ndid take the Jews to be soldiers. We sort of had, the Czechs we were sort of\ntreated like first class citizens.... Not first class. I mean we didn\u2019t feel it so bad.\nIt\u2019s the Hungarians, when the Germans came there was already murder, it was\nalready completely disaster.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: They had a stone house, a stone house. And they had lots of cows and horses and\ngoats and you know, it was like a family in a smaller town. It was like a normal\nfamily, a big family. And on Saturday nobody worked so we would get together\nand we would have meals together.",
        "A: At their house, yes. And Ill tell you, me as a child. I thought I was a happy child\nbecause you know, my uncles loved me and I was a child and it was, to me it\nlooked like a happy situation.",
        "A: No, it was sort of ----here were the living quarters and there was like a long room\nand they kept the ----that\u2019s where the store was",
        "A: Well, you see, I'll start with my grandparents. That\u2019s why it\u2019s better when you\nask me because I go in from one to another. Um, when the Hungarians come in\nthe Jews could no longer have stores even. The Jews could no longer do things,\nyou know, because when you had a store you needed a permit. And you know,\nthey took it away from you. So they had to close the store. And, you say, how\n6\ndid they live, but they had some piece of grounds, and they had the cows that\nmade milk and made the butter and potatoes, they put potatoes in the ----- you\nknow, they had potatoes. It wasn\u2019t a wonderful life and you know, they didn\u2019t\nlive in a house like I\u2019m living. They had two rooms. You know, they would\nsurvive. To give you an example, my parents by the Czechs, they had store, it\nwas a shoe store.",
        "A: My parents had. They made a living room out of that. But as soon as the\nHungarians come in it was taken away from them.",
        "A: Yeah. I mean, I\u2019m just showing you an example.",
        "A: No, we didn\u2019t have to wear a yellow star by the Hungarians.",
        "A: When the Germans came, but you see when the Hungarians came they restricted\nus to certain extent that we tried not to be invisible. Who went to the park? I\nmean, we wouldn\u2019t do that. We wouldn\u2019t. Even when they wanted to worship, it\nwas in secret. It was in somebody\u2019s room. And then you watched, you shouldn\u2019t\nbe seen going in there too many times, you see. Then they didn\u2019t worship every\nday anymore. If they could get to it on Saturday they would be glad to do it. I\nmean, you know these old religious people because they were afraid of God.",
        "A: Well, he would do it by himself but not anywhere in a group.",
        "A: Oh, yeah.\n7",
        "A: Well, because it was a war. They were taking it from the non-Jews too actually.",
        "A: They were taking it from everybody, because the war was going on and there\nwasn\u2019t enough food so, it wasn\u2019t that people lived by laws, there was no law. I\nmean, any hooligan. If you beat up a Jew, he wasn\u2019t persecuted. There was no\nplace to go to complain. There was a place, we did have police. But, you\ncouldn\u2019t go complain somebody beat me up, because you would get more.",
        "A: Sure, sure. Children, you know, it was very funny. It was very funny because by\nthe Czechs, you know, when we went to school we went with our neighbors. And\nwho were our neighbors, the non-Jews. And I always thought, I walk to school\nwith this non-Jewish child and I really thought, I mean, I always thought it was\nmy friend. You know, as a child you play with this kid, you know, this is my\nfriend that I play with. But as soon as the government has changed and gave the\nred light to vandalism, maybe the people were scared or something. You see, I\ndon\u2019t know. So I lost my, I immediately lost my friend, my play, you know, my\nplaymate. You see, they didn\u2019t want anything to do with me. I mean, I\u2019m telling\nyou from my point of view, as a child what bothered me. My father bothered\nbecause he didn\u2019t have to give us a piece of bread. But....",
        "A: You know a child is now looking back on it. If there was a wedding, let\u2019s say\nthere was a non-Jewish wedding. By the Czechs we would go and watch the\nwedding. I liked to go and watch a wedding, so I went and I watched a wedding\nand I came back and, you know, I was let free by the Czechs. But when the\nHungarians came, you know, my mother wouldn\u2019t let me go anymore. I\u2019m just\ngiving you a small example that she wouldn\u2019t let me go because everybody in\ntown knew I was Jewish and therefore I was . Do let\u2019s say there\nwere even 10 good non-Jews, but you would always find one that would want to\nget me over the head. You know what I\u2019m saying?",
        "A: I jut gave you an example. Or let\u2019s say, lots of examples.\n8",
        "A: But, I don\u2019t want to take too much ---- I mean this was just that a child\u2019s,\nespecially because I was a little girl I liked to look at a bride or something. But\nmany things, at night definitely you wouldn\u2019t go out. Oh, definitely you wouldn\u2019t\ngo out. Like, you know, if we needed, then if went to the store they would sell us,\nthey would sell us if we had the money, they would. But, well, we\u2019re still talking\nabout the Hungarians now or the Germans?",
        "A: Okay, like, I wouldn\u2019t be allowed, the children weren\u2019t allowed no more to go\nlike to the store. Sometimes my uncle would give me 25 cents and I would go\nand buy an ice cream. I no longer, they wouldn\u2019t allow me to go by myself. You\nknow, if they brought it into the house, you know. At that time there was no\nmoney to, you know. At that time if my mother could get some different things to\nsurvive, but you know, they wouldn\u2019t let us go out. My brother would go and get-\n--- then they also took him away too, uh. I had an older brother than this.",
        "A: Yeah, I had an older brother. But then they took him away to work, you know.",
        "A: His name was Larry, my son 1s named after him. We called him Libel, but my\nson is named after him. His name is Larry.",
        "A: Well, when the Germans came, they right away said that the Jews can not only,\nthey could only go out, let\u2019s say, a couple of hours a day. Not only at night, a\ncouple of hours a day and if you found a Jew on the street, you know, wanting to\nbuy something you could be shot for that or you could be taken away to this\nconcentration camp which eventually wound up in Auschwitz. So the Jews had to\nwear the Jewish stars, even children. And then the non-Jews were not allowed to\nsell to Jews or aid them in any way. You see they gave, when the Germans came\nalready, Pll tell you, I don\u2019t blame the non, at that time, you know I read now, I\nknow there were some very righteous non-Jews that really, what they did, I don\u2019t\nknow if I would do it today when I have children and grandchildren because\nwould they aid a Jew, they would be taken away to a concentration camp. So the\npunishment was so tremendous of aiding a Jew that he himself wasn\u2019t safe. I\u2019m\ntalking the non-Jew wasn\u2019t safe. That was by the Germans, by the Germans.\n9",
        "A: I think it was between \u201942 or \u00b043, but you know, I am not sure exactly.",
        "A: Yeah, because you have the town and I\u2019m sure.",
        "A: That was after they took us away from home into a ghetto.",
        "A: That wasn\u2019t while we were home. But, when the Germans came, though, they\nworked so fast, they worked so fast. If I, within weeks they took us to a ghetto,\nwithin weeks and they put us into the ghetto.",
        "A: Yes, within weeks, it wasn\u2019t months.",
        "A: Yes, yes. Now you see, it\u2019s true. You know, I\u2019ve always had this color, now I\nhave to put a little color because I am white. But I was always this color so when\nI talk many people ask me, you don\u2019t look Jewish. I say how is a Jew supposed to\nlook? So, it wasn\u2019t, what happened was, the non-Jews handed us over to the\nGermans. You know what I\u2019m saying?",
        "A: Yeah. Even we had to have a Star of David on the house too. But, let\u2019s say they\ndidn\u2019t know that my parents had seven kids. But, the non-Jews, so there was no\nplace to hide and they were afraid to hide us because if they\u2019re gonna find us then\nthey\u2019ll go where we are. So it was a no-win situation there.",
        "A: Uhzgorod, it was a bigger town. It was a city, I would call that a city already.",
        "A: I\u2019m not sure.\n10",
        "A: No, it was maybe an hour ride with a train. It wasn\u2019t ----",
        "A: Yes, there was a train station in our town.",
        "A: My grandparents and the stronger uncles were taken away to work. My brother\nLarry was taken away to work. My brother Saul was taken away to work. But\nthe rest of them, the smaller children. That\u2019s another thing, you know they\nplanned that so by the time they came to take us to the gas chambers that there\nwasn\u2019t enough strong manpower, they left the old people, the little kids, the\nwomen, the older, you know. They planned it so just in case ----",
        "A: And another thing that they ask me many times, well how come you didn\u2019t fight\nback? Jews were such law abiding citizens that not only that, but 1f somebody\nwould have found it was against the law to have a gun in the house. So, you\nknow, Jews just didn\u2019t keep guns in the house. I spoke in front of officers, Navy\nofficers, and that was their first question and I understood what they were saying,\nit\u2019s just that I don\u2019t know if I could have given them a sufficient enough answer of\nthe situation that was there. When you don\u2019t have a gun and you don\u2019t have the\nmanpower anymore, how can you fight? Then nobody really knew that you\u2019re\ngoing to a gas chamber, it was a big secret.",
        "A: Relocated. They said they need manpower to work.",
        "A: But, I\u2019ll tell you, the way they dealt, we should have known something is horribly\nwrong. The way they dealt with a human being, if they wanted to make us work,\nyou don\u2019t go and beat someone to death or beat someone half dead, you know. It\nwas, you know, we weren\u2019t dealt like we were human.\n11",
        "A: Well, also again they didn\u2019t keep us long in the ghetto either because it was like,\nyou know. I think they knew when we were there that the war, now looking back\non it they didn\u2019t keep us long in the ghetto either. But, the living quarters, the\nghetto was a brick factory, they emptied out a brick factory, it was big. There\nwere no beds or kitchens in a brick factory, so we brought some blankets with us,\nyou know we carried certain things and they gave us a little place there in the\nghetto where we stayed, where we had our little place on the floor. Then they\ngave us rations, soup, you know, in the morning coffee, and at night soup. Of\ncourse the living quarters were horrible, there was no place to wash and the kids,\nthere were no bathrooms. So, it was a horrible situation. And the worst of all, we\ndidn\u2019t know what would happen next. All we saw is that every day they brought\nin more Jews, more Jews. We just didn\u2019t know what they were going to do with\nus.",
        "A: probably months, just maybe, I don\u2019t know. Maybe a month or two at the most.\nFrom what I remember, it wasn\u2019t, you know like the Polish Jews were in ghettos\nfor years, but this wasn\u2019t a work ghetto. The Polish Jews were in a work ghetto.\nThis was not a work ghetto.",
        "A: Yeah, they got us together and shipped us to Auschwitz. Because at that time\nalready they had the capacity, you see with the Polish Jews they didn\u2019t probably.\nThey didn\u2019t have the capacity of destroying that many, so they had to kill them by\nbullets. So, you know, it was different. But with us, they could gas thousands of\nthem.",
        "A: Months, I would say months.",
        "A: Right around the middle, between \u00b042, \u201943 maybe. Let\u2019s say \u201943 already.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes, in a cattle car train.\n12",
        "A: And then, I\u2019Il tell you, when I think back on that ride, you know they put so many\npeople into that cattle car. We had no bathrooms, small kids, sick people, they\njust packed us in there. You know, if they would have taken us to work\nsomeplace they wouldn\u2019t have done to us what they did. Just even the transport,\nthat in itself should have said something to us. But we couldn\u2019t imagine, we\ncouldn\u2019t imagine that we\u2019re going to the gas chamber. We couldn\u2019t imagine that.",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "A: Well, it stopped. It stopped and the smell. You\u2019re probably going to see, I think I\ndo tell ---",
        "A: I tell the day in Auschwitz, one day in Auschwitz I think I tell. And, um, you\nknow. If you want me to [Il tell you.",
        "A: I can tell it again? Because I want to tell you new stuff, not repeating myself.\nWhen we stopped in Auschwitz they didn\u2019t open up the door, we didn\u2019t know\nwhere we were. We just saw a big sign that said, you know, a round sign. It was\nlike this, and it says \u201cArbeit macht das Leben suss\u201d\u2019, and that means in English,\nwork makes life sweet. So, but still the smell was terrible, the smell was terrible\nand there was a big fire, like a big building or something was on fire. You could\nsee far in from the tracks, but they didn\u2019t open up the wagons until it got\ncompletely dark, I mean it was dark, dark. All of a sudden floodlights came on\nthe train and we saw these SS there on the platform, you know, and dogs, dogs.\nAnd they opened up the doors and started screaming, \u201cHeraus! Heraus! Heraus!\u201d\u2019\nAnd, you know from that trip a lot of people died because they threw in sick\npeople and old people and so whoever could run out from this train, they were\ngoing out. If not you were beaten up. So they rushed so that they shouldn\u2019t get\nbeaten, but a lot of them that stayed there they just carried them out and put them\non the truck. There was a truck, a big open truck, was right there, you know, not\nfar from the platform. Everybody tried taking out the few things that they had for\nthem, not that it was anything but, everybody is trying to survive, so they think\nthey\u2019 ll be needing it.\nSo there was a ditch and they were yelling at the people they should throw away\nthe luggage, and people didn\u2019t want to part with it. One was screaming \u201cI don\u2019t\nhave the name on it!\u201d They were worrying that they\u2019Il never find their luggage\n13\nbecause they don\u2019t have the name on it. So there was sort of a commotion, so\nthey were hitting on the people and they got beaten up, they threw away those few\nlittle things that they had there. But, with my grandfather he didn\u2019t want it, he\nwas getting beaten up, but he wouldn\u2019t part with it. And so, you know what they\ndid to him. Should I repeat, should I say it again?",
        "A: The tape is on? So he didn\u2019t want to part with these Ten Commandments, with\nthis Torah. So they were beating on him. We were pleading with him \u201cThrow it\naway! Throw it away!\u201d He didn\u2019t want to do it, so they beat him, they kicked him\nand then he could no longer get up. He was there and then they were beating on\nus to go to the right, to the left. And what I remember seeing 1s that they just took\nmy grandfather and they threw him on the truck because he couldn\u2019t get up\nanymore and the Torah, the Ten Commandments were in the ditch. And me and\nmy sister they put us to ride with my mother and my mother held on to my\nbrother, she wouldn\u2019t let go of him.",
        "A: That was my youngest brother, he was six years younger than I was. She\nwouldn\u2019t let go of him, so they started beating on my brother so she let go. But,\nshe didn\u2019t know that they\u2019re going to put him to the left, that they\u2019re going to put\nhim on the other side and my brother screamed and cried and there were other\ncries from other children. But, she sort of, she must have recognized his cry so\nshe looked back and, you know, he was trying to go to my mother, so they were\nhitting on him and so my mother ran to him from the right to the left and they\nwouldn\u2019t let her go to the left. So, they were beating on my mother, she fell and\nshe was crawling and pleading with the SS, \u201cPlease let me go to my kid! Please\nlet me go to my kid!\u201d\u2019 So, finally after she was on the floor and pleading with him\nand, I don\u2019t know, change of heart, he kicked her and she went to the left. You\nknow, he kicked her and she sort of moved to the left. She ran to my brother and\nshe got a hold of him, and, you know, my brother cried anyway because he saw\nmy mother so beaten up. And they walked off, Pll tell you the truth, you know,\nwhen I think if, sometimes, moments I said, I bet my mother would survive. But,\nright after the war I knew she would have not survived anyway, so I say to myself\nmaybe a good thing that happened, you know there were so many kids they went\nto their death so frightened, so scared because they didn\u2019t have their parents with\nthem. Now, the little infants, they didn\u2019t know, but the four, five, six year old\nchild, it was dark, it was dark. In the beating, you know, they were hitting on\nchildren. You would think they would leave children alone. If the child, let\u2019s say\ndidn\u2019t obey what they said, if 1t wanted to go here or there they were they were\nhitting on kids like they hit on adults. And why they needed to do that I don\u2019t\nunderstand, why they needed to hit on kids. And, so I say to myself, maybe she\nwas a comfort to another child there, I\u2019m sure. You know, she had seven kids\nand, so ---- so that\u2019s how my mother left to her death.\n14",

The price they had to pay while they were separating them,\nyou know, beside the physical pain, the emotional pain was horrible.",

My parents, my\ngrandparents, they definitely believed, they were definite believers. To them, a\nsin was maybe doubting God. I mean ---",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, but I know they were well educated in Jewish. They would quote\nthings from the Bible, maybe that was their way of educating us to be human\nbeings. I\u2019m not sure why they did that, but uh, if there was any correction in our\nbehavior, you know kids act up sometimes, so they would quote us from the Bible\nwhat is right and what is wrong.

You know\nunder the Czechs, the reason why my grandparents had more cows and all kinds\nof animals because they had land, they had, we were allowed to own land by the\nCzechs. When the Hungarians come nothing was ours, you know what I\u2019m\nsaying? They took it away.\n21",

We were limited, we were even\nlimited to worship, I mean that doesn\u2019t hurt anyone. What can a person do with\nworship in God? I mean, we prayed for better times. And then, you know, we\nwere preoccupied with how to survive, how to feed all these mouths. That was\nour preoccupation and our safety.",
        "A: It was really very difficult. We had to live off, again like my grandparents, we\nhad a little place near the house that we planted carrots and potatoes and you\nknow, just barely. And then we had our cows, so we had our cows for milk.\nPeople there lived mostly on potatoes and milk and bread, oh bread was a big\nthing. And we had poultry, we had ---",

        "A: We wanted to come to the United States, but, you know, because I had my sister\nhere. But, we couldn\u2019t no longer. Now where could we have gone? We were\nsurrounded, in Hungary the Jews were treated like we were treated, in Romania,\nJews were treated like we were treated. If you see Czechoslovakia in the middle -",

        "A: No, that was almost the end of the war, he died of starvation in a train because\nthey were taking him away. You see, what they were doing 1s that they were\npicking, you know you have these grenades on the floor, let\u2019s say, you know\nwhen the Russians retreated, when the Germans, before the Germans would make\nany steps they would send out these Jewish boys to the mine fields.",
        "A: So they would pick up, you know. So that\u2019s what happened. He survived that.",
        "A: No, my brother. But, what happened was he died of starvation because when they\nhad to retreat, they were retreating and taking these, whoever was left, a handful.\nThey weren\u2019t giving them to eat or anything or sleep, so he just ---That\u2019s what\nsomebody told my ---",
        "A: Yes. But, you know, could he have survived maybe the starvation he would be\nalive because he survived ---",
        "A: Yes. But, you know, I wasn\u2019t there.",

        "A: Under the Czechs, yes.",
        "A: Well, he had more responsibilities than I did.",
        "A: Well, let me tell you, he helped my father with small little jobs like, let\u2019s say, a\nnon-Jew, it was forbidden for a non-Jew to ---by the Hungarians they were\nallowed, by the Hungarians the Jews couldn\u2019t own anything. But the Jews were\nallowed to work for the non-Jews sort of. So he used to ---",
        "A: Yes, we are talking now about the Hungarians. So he would go and help my\nfather to ---",
        "A: Little jobs.",
        "A: Yes.\n26",
        "A: Right, right.",
        "A: Well, I'll tell you under the Czechs we had a bigger farm, but under the\nHungarians we no longer had the farm, except they let us have a few cows and a\nfew chickens. But, as I said, even under the Hungarians they were taking from\nthe non-Jews too, but the non-Jews, the grounds still belonged to them. You see\nwhat I\u2019m saying? They took the livestock. But the ground, they could own the\nground, but we no longer owned the ground.",
        "A: You know what, we can figure that out.",
        "A: He went to high school.",
        "A: My oldest brother finished high school.",

        "A: No, there wasn\u2019t such a thing.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: You know, it is so difficult to explain a child\u2019s life then and a child\u2019s life here,\nwhen I see my grandchildren, may God keep them well. Um, it\u2019s just like,\nchildren were just not children, children were like old people. What they worried\nabout is how to survive, how to see the sadness. Let me say this, by the Czechs it\nwasn\u2019t so visible, but as soon as the Hungarians came in, the children were no\nlonger children.",
        "A: They grew up fast, they grew up fast.",
        "A: Well, he liked reading.",
        "A: Oh, he loved reading, he loved reading. Any book that you know, books were\nscarce. I know that, you know, a Torah is a holy thing, but you wouldn\u2019t believe\nthat a book to us was a holy thing. Any book that you got a hold of, I remember\nwe had a breakfront, what do you think was in that breakfront, a book that we got\na hold of. It was, everybody read it, and we read it. We used to dust the book, the\n28\ndust shouldn\u2019t fall on it. That\u2019s how scarce a book was. So I tell you when I\ncame here to this country and I had my children, I kept on telling them how, you\nknow, privileged. My children knew when they go to school they are privileged\nto be able to go to school. They are privileged to have an access of books that\nthey could have.",
        "A: You know, it\u2019s like, to us books were like jewels. Yeah, that was a good word,\nlike jewels.",
        "A: Oh, we all, in that respect, because there wasn\u2019t that much that kids could do. So,\nwhat do you get? You know, so when you read a book your mind was\npreoccupied. Your mind was occupied.",
        "A: From your sadness, from your uh ---",
        "A: Well, we played like kids play. You know, we hop scotched I remember, and I\nplayed with non-Jewish children hopscotch, I remember.",
        "A: Well, when we went to school by the Czechs we had non-Jewish, we thought they\nwere our friends. You know like kids, you don\u2019t think which synagogue, which\nhouse of worship you go. Kids don\u2019t think like that, so who cares?",
        "A: That was before the ghetto.",
        "A: That was another thing, you know. My mother, they took them away and we\ndidn\u2019t get mail from them, the mail wasn\u2019t coming. So, I remember, in the\nbeginning, the mail would come, maybe, very, the beginning we would get a\n29\npostcard from them. So, my mother, we didn\u2019t have much, so my mother used to\nbake cookies and send them little packages, you know of cookies.",
        "A: Right. But occasionally we did get, in the beginning. So then the mail stopped,\nso I remember how she carried on. She felt that they are not alive anymore\nbecause we weren\u2019t getting any mail. So, my mother was preoccupied with that,\nthat they took away her sons and, you know, that they\u2019re not alive. There was no\nway to find out where they were.",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "A: He was taken away to work in town, but he could sleep at home. You see what I\nmean? But the boys left and we didn\u2019t, you know, we didn\u2019t see them again.",
        "A: Well, wherever they were, yeah.",
        "A: Golly, I don\u2019t remember. That was just at the beginning, you know, just as a child\nI remember my mother was excited baking cookies to send to them and then she\nwas sad because she could no longer send them cookies and being that they don\u2019t\nwrite, they\u2019re not alive anymore, so she was mourning. You know, I remember\nher crying over that, that her boys are probably not alive anymore because we\ndidn\u2019t get the mail.",
        "A: that was after the Hungarians came.",
        "A: Well, maybe a little while later.",
        "A: Something like it, yes. I was a little kid so I don\u2019t remember the exact time.\n30",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes, he worked in different places, in different places under the Germans. Then,\nthe Germans took over these Jewish ---\nQW: Was he in Hungary still or, I mean in Czechoslovakia still or ---",
        "A: No, he was in Poland and in Russia and all over the place, all over the place.",
        "A: He wasn\u2019t in Auschwitz, he was only in the work camps and they got liberated by\nthe Russians, marching,",
        "A: Well, sort of. Yeah, they were marching them and then one night the Russians\njust showed up, yes.",
        "A: The dates I\u2019ve got a problem. Let me tell you how he survived. What happened\nwas when the Germans were marching these guys, at one time they rested up\nsomeplace. You know, it was a place, I don\u2019t know what, a farm. He called it,\nlet\u2019s say a farm. So he sneaked away and went in under the hay, you know he\ncovered himself up with hay until the next day the Germans left with the group,\nbut he had a problem, he had a problem when the Russians came, he had a\nproblem to explain himself, where is he coming from, where has he been? So,\nyou know, when he would tell me these stories I, myself, couldn\u2019t believe what\nthis guy had to go through just, even, after the war, how the Russians kept him\nlocked up. But then he was telling the story how, you know, so finally they\ncaught up with the group, so they knew that he must be telling the truth because\nhe knew about the group and it was lucky that they caught up with them a short\ntime later so they told him to let him go because, who knows, they could have\nthought he was a spy and they could have killed him.",
        "A: So that was the lucky part, so even if he wanted to survive he could have gotten\nkilled after, after war for different reasons.\n31",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Well, the last place he lived was Uhzgorod.",
        "A: To the Ukraine, and the Russians occupied it.",
        "A: Yes, I can call you up and tell you exactly when he came because we brought him\nout.",
        "A: And did we have a time, also.",
        "A: Seventies, I think it was the seventies when we brought him over. I\u2019Il tell you the\nexact dates because we have the papers. That I can give you the exact date.",
        "A: Sylvia.",
        "A: Sura never went to that accidentally, you know, you see what the Germans did in\nthe beginning they just gassed everybody that came to Auschwitz. But, when we\ncame at that time the German munitions factory already said don\u2019t kill them all\nout, send me the manpower. That\u2019s where I worked the munitions factory. But,\nso that\u2019s how I survived. But, my sister, they probably would have grabbed the\nkid out of her hand but she was short and skinny, sort of, so you know, they\nweren\u2019t paying much attention to her. So she got away walking to the gas\nchambers with her child. I mean, it was like, you know, a freak accident.\nProbably would have been worse for her if they would have taken the kids out\nbecause her kid was really small.\n32",
        "A: Who knows what was worse, who knows?",
        "A: Yea, 1925.",
        "A: February the tenth.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yes, I was born in \u201928.",
        "A: Yes, but, you know she didn\u2019t finish. But you\u2019d be surprised, we tried so hard to\nstudy even in our own little private cheders, what we called them.",
        "A: And that was our outlet, you were asking me whether we had ---this was our\noutlet, to get a pencil and paper and write or, you know, number work. I used to\nlove number work, actually I loved it. A piece of paper was difficult, so it was\ndifficult all around. My kids grew up that they were privileged, they had enough\npaper and pencil. I didn\u2019t tell them the rest of the horror stories, but I just made\nthem --- I really still feel that a child that is, that has the privilege of an education\nand doesn\u2019t take, that doesn\u2019t say, you know, my daughter went to college, my\nfirst daughter went to college, I said to her, you know, you are privileged to be\nable to go to college. And I really think she was there and she felt, you know,\nsomething terrific is happening to her. I really think she felt like that.",
        "A: Yes, we would go and wash floors for other people and clean. I mean, because\nthere were a few doctors there.\n33",
        "A: Under the Hungarians, not the Czechs. The Hungarians, a matter of fact, should I\ntell you, I remember even me, I used to go and help out, you know. We were\nglad, because what happened was when I went to help out, to do these chores, you\nknow somebody gave me a slice of bread. You know, I don\u2019t know, I also felt\ngood that they asked you to come. Actually, you felt good that they asked you to\ncome in to their house to help them out with these chores.",
        "A: It was, it was ---well, I can\u2019t say it was nice because I had to wash the bathrooms,\nI had to wash the clothes and, you know, I was a little kid. I wasn\u2019t that old,\nmaybe 12 or 13 years old when I was doing it. But, it was okay, because that\u2019s\nhow we were surviving, you know what I\u2019m saying?",
        "A: And they weren\u2019t beating on us.",
        "A: Yes, we fought a lot and we played a lot. Yes, but we were very close. Matter of\nfact, I think you\u2019re going to hear in the tape that, probably if not for her, I\nprobably would not have survived. I'll tell you why -- because I\u2019m not that strong\nwilled and I, oh I know, many times I just didn\u2019t want to, like when I was in the\nmunitions factory, I was tired and I was hungry and I was, I was half dead. So, I\ndidn\u2019t want to get up in the morning and these people, that they didn\u2019t get up in\nthe morning, they were left in the barracks when we worked. You never saw\nthem again, they probably, you know, we just never ---nobody asked. We never\nsaw them again. They probably just did away with them. So, I would want to do\nthat and she would lift me up and she shook me in the morning. She dragged me\nout, but 1t was cold, you see where we were in Germany it was very cold and,\nhere, you know, we had these wooden shoes and the one dress. So, she would\ndrag me out to stay there for an hour, you know, and she would encourage me,\nshe would give me, you know half a slice of her half slice of bread so that I\nshould just go on, go on. She would do a lot of work for me that, you know, I\ncould not work so hard, she just --- But, in the end, I remember in the end, you\nknow, she said she\u2019s not going to leave me here alone. She would get angry at\nme, she would get angry at me because I say, \u201cI\u2019m going to die\u201d. You know, to\nher it was a threat. To me it was real, mentally, with me In think my mental stage\ngave up So ---you know, I don\u2019t care anymore, so if not for her I probably\nwouldn\u2019t be sitting here and talking.\n34",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "A: Yes, yes. In the end, I don\u2019t know if I put that on the tape. When they brought us\nto Bergen Belsen, she was the first one to get sick because when we got to Bergen\nBelsen was when (tape ended)\n(Beginning of tape 2) Let me ask you about your smallest brother, about your\nyoungest brother. Now, let\u2019s see you said your, that was Efram, Efram?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Well, matter of fact, I do remember when he was born, I was a little girl myself.\nBut, 1t was like, we were already six, but there was sort of an excitement when he\nwas born. You know, being that he was the youngest, all the kids sort of felt that\nhe was their little toy.",
        "A: So everybody was involved with him, you know.",
        "A: After me.",
        "A: Yeah, right. No, \u201936, wait a minute, I was born in \u201928.",
        "A: Okay, okay.",
        "A: No, no,",
        "A: No, because we were under the Hungarians, you know, he used to come into the\ncheder and just, sometimes, annoy, they would throw him out of the room. But,\n35\nyou know, most of the time they would keep him there. Sometimes he would be\ngood and sometimes, you know.",
        "A: He was a little, yeah, he was a spoiled little kid because the kid it wasn\u2019t so much\nthat my mother and father had that much time for him, but, you know, he was like\nthe kid\u2019s toy. He was a loving little kid, so everybody picked him up and hugged\nhim and I think that\u2019s what made him so loving because he had so many people.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember the specifics that they would give him something to do. I don\u2019t\nremember.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah. Hide and seek, you know, yeah. He would like to hide and we\nwould have to run after him, you know and find him. You know, like a child.",
        "A: oh, he just had an aleph-beis book. I remember it, and I\u2019m telling you he would\ncarry this book along and he wouldn\u2019t show just anybody, he had to be your\nfriend in order for him to show you that book.",
        "A: Aleph-beis, it was like an A-B-C book, in Yiddish they called it an aleph-beis\nbook, he called it the aleph-beis book, but it was the A-B-C book, A-B-C book,\nand he loved that book, he loved it, he carried it, he went to sleep with it, like who\nknows what. But, you know to get to a book like that wasn\u2019t so easy either in the\nwar, So it\u2019s ---so, it wasn\u2019t like this book could be replaced so easily. You know,\nfor my children\u2019s birthdays and my grandchildren\u2019s birthdays I always, well for\nmy children\u2019s birthdays it was a trend, it was always a book. But even for my\ngrandchildren\u2019s birthdays when they were little I always went and bought a few\nlittle books and send it to them for presents, I don\u2019t know why, but this was, they\nknew when their birthday would come, they\u2019Il get books from me, little books.",
        "A: Well, I mean, you see, an American child does not understand that a European\nchild, even a non-Jewish child was not that lucky to get this education. A lot of\npeople don\u2019t, it was when I was raised, when I was raised, maybe now it\u2019s\ndifferent. Probably it\u2019s different, here it\u2019s different too. But, when I was raised a\n36\nbook was, or an education was scarce. People didn\u2019t have the money, and didn\u2019t\nhave the means.",
        "A: They did, and they also used it. If I think back, like let\u2019s say I did something that\nthey didn\u2019t like, they would bring out a quote from the Bible, what\u2019s wrong and\nwhat\u2019s right. Like they would tell me, you know, they would say God gave you\nthat you can choose from right and wrong, now, do you think God would be\nhappier with you if you choose the right or the wrong? They didn\u2019t understand\nthat me as a child could not, many times, understand what I\u2019m doing wrong. And\nit\u2019s not that I did such terrible wrong, you know, maybe I didn\u2019t like something\nthat they told me to do and I didn\u2019t want to do it, you know ---so, what I\u2019m trying\nto say 1s that they used their education sort of raising us. There was never\nphysical, I don\u2019t ever remember, even when we were seven kids, there was never\nphysical, you know, abuse.",
        "A: No, no, there was no physical punishment but there was a lot of Bible quoting, we\nhad to do the right thing. Children don\u2019t always know the right thing, and\nchildren sometimes they want to laugh, and sometimes they want to fight, you\nknow.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: Well, you\u2019re very welcome Tony and it was really a pleasure meeting you.\n37\n"
