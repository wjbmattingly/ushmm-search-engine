They started to go \u2014 go on the loft. Well, going back to the problem\nwhat Mother was doing, making bundles of these twigs to feed the goat, 1t was po\n\u2014 essential that you don\u2019t shake the \u2014 the bundles, because the leaves would fall\noff, and the goats wouldn\u2019t get any food.

And it was in Tatishchevo, near Saratov, where was the first Polish army\ncamp that was being gathered from all the soldiers that had remained, that hadn't\nbeen murdered in the Soviet Union. So they met there briefly, and they actually\nmet again later on in Jelibod(ph), which was in Uzbekistan, or I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s\non the border, near Tashkins(ph). Tashkins(ph) was another area where the\nPolish army had gone, and this is maybe 1500 miles or more away from\nTatishchevo, or near Saratov.",
        "Q: Okay. So I would like to \u2014 for us to trace. I mean, some of the things that I\nasked Mira, she didn\u2019t remember where she wa \u2014 you know, what the towns were,\nand so on. And tell me, how is it that you know all of these places?",
        "A: Well, my mother talked about these experiences the whole time I was growing\nup. And they were rather in disjointed sequence. So when I had my first child, sheJanuary 23, 2015\nagreed to put it all in order, with the help of my father. And so we embarked on\nthis project to get it in chronological order, and get the geography right, and the\nhistory. And I started writing a book about it. And I did lot of research, and you\nknow, interviewed my parents, mostly my father, and also other historians who\nwere aware of \u2014 of this migration, this whole journey of these people that had been\ndeported.",
        "Q: Okay, so I'd like to start from \u2014 from the beginning at least, but we\u2019ll run\nthrough it, okay?",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: So, Mira was born in Grodno, and that was in what part of Poland\u2019?",
        "A: That at the time was eastern Poland. Today it is Belarus, right on the border\nreally, with Lithuania and \u2014 and not too far from where the current border of\nPoland is.",
        "Q: Okay. And from Grodno, do you know what deportation they were taken on?\nWas it the February one?",
        "A: The February 10\" one, yes, in 1940.",
        "Q: Okay. And where were they taken to?",
        "A: They were taken first to a camp at \u2014 across the Urals, which would have been\ntechnically Siberia. And I\u2019m trying to remember the \u2014 one was Mikelinska(ph),\ndo you remember that name? And the other one, I am drawing a blank.January 23, 2015",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: But they were first there for maybe a few months, and this was in winter. And\nthen they were taken back to another camp near Perm, which is of Molotov. And\nthat was where they really were for the duration of the time in the \u2014 in the labor\ncamp.",
        "Q: So Perm was a pretty tough place.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: The \u2014 some of the stories that Mira shared with us today, are they ones that\nyou are familiar with, that you had heard about before?",
        "A: Oh yes, I grew up with these stories, you know, but \u2014 you know, these were\nthings that were discussed, especially at \u2014 during holiday times, or whenever our\nPolish friends would come over, because many of them had very similar stories,\nand they would start to talk about all these things. Or just Sunday dinners, you\nknow, this was something that was so large a part of their lives. Especially my\nmother. You know, my father talked about it, but my mother was very \u2014 you\nknow, she \u2014 she wo \u2014 she went through so much, you know?",
        "Q: So, if I can repeat a little bit, just to make sure that I\u2019m clear about, she had to\nwork as a lumberjack?",
        "A: Right. She was fairly tall for a Polish person, maybe not as tall as I am, but she\nwas, you know, generally speaking, the \u2014 the Soviets took people who wereJanuary 23, 2015\nworking in the country to do the harder jobs, because they were honed better. And\nthe people who were in the cities were doing lighter work. And as Mira was\nsaying, there was no one else f \u2014 to work for them. It was just my mother. And so\nthey came and assessed that she was strong enough, or whatever, to work in the\nforest, and she would have to go and chop off huge branches of trees that they\nfelled, and \u2014 and yes, there was one occasion when she \u2014 I don\u2019t know, you know,\nshe was so tired by then, and \u2014 and malnourished, and just, you know, devastated\nby the whole experience, because for her it was a constant worry about saving\nMira, that she didn\u2019t end up in one of those Soviet orphanages. And \u2014 and so this\ntree was falling on her, and she just kind of stood there, and you know, they \u2014 and\nwatched this tree coming towards her, and at the last second she jumped into like a\npile of rubble, and the \u2014 the branches from this rubble actually cut the \u2014",
        "Q: Broke the \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 broke the fall. So she \u2014 she was in there, and they thought \u2014 the Soviets, the\nbrigadier, the supervisor of the \u2014 of the work team thought she was trying to kill\nherself, you know. And so they got mad at her for \u2014 for, you know, doing that.\nAnd so eventually, actually turned out to be a good thing, because she ended up\ngetting ga new job working \u2014 fixing \u2014 changing the oil on tractors, and also filling\n\u2014 there was one steam tractor that she had to fill water. And she got paid more for\nthat. But, you know, in the co \u2014 in the course of all of that, you know, she di \u2014 sheJanuary 23, 2015\nalmost did end up in jail, because she was very patriotic and she would taunt the\nSoviets, especially the \u2014 the locals, which were typically Ukrainians, or\nByelorussian\u2019s that were the supervisors in these barracks. And she would sing\nPolish patriotic songs, and you know, just really \u2014 she kind of did things that\ndidn\u2019t help her, you know, and that\u2019s another thing that happened. So when she\nwent to court, you know, for this minor incident, they were \u2014 they were just \u2014 you\nknow, it was kind of vengeance from that particular barracks supervisor that didn\u2019t\nlike her.",
        "Q: Okay. I wanted to get a sense of how this \u2014 how this developed, the context of\nsuch a bizarre thing, to be taken to court for, you know, having hay.",
        "A: Actually, there were two court incidences. One was the hay, and then there was\nanother one where she was late for work, cause she had gotten \u2014 like gone back to\nget a jacket, or something, because it was starting to rain. And that one was\nactually a much more serious one. But the first time I think they docked her for, I\nthink a third of her pay, which was just astronomical because she wasn\u2019t getting\npaid very much anyway. It was enough to maybe buy a loaf and a half of bread a\nday. And so, you know, to lose that money, it was really, really difficult.",
        "Q: Okay. And did you ever know, or did she ever \u2014 was she ever told why she was\ndeported?",
        "A: Because she was a landowner.January 23, 2015",
        "Q: That\u2019s what I thought, that\u2019s what I thought.",
        "A: And \u2014 and also, I think they may have also known that her \u2014 they were still\nmarried, even though they were separated, her husband was a \u2014 a soldier, you\nknow, he was sergeant in the army.",
        "Q: Okay, okay. All right, so when it comes to 1941, and there\u2019s the agreement\nbetween the Polish government in exile, and the Soviet Union to release people\nwho had been citizens of Poland who had been deported, they learned about it\nfrom a former prisoner, rather than officials.",
        "A: Right, they \u2014 the Soviets were not quick to let go of these free laborers, so it\nwas somebody that had been let go earlier, and came back and told them about\nthis, and so my mother had tried to get official permission to leave the camp, but\nthey weren\u2019t \u2014 they really did not want to give it to her, so essentially, they\nescaped.",
        "Q: So tell me, this incident what \u2014 that Mira was talking about, where she would\nbe a Red Cross nurse, and Mira would be left in an orphanage, was this \u2014",
        "A: Well, that\u2019s much later, actually.",
        "Q: Oh, I see.",
        "A: That\u2019s much later. Yeah, at \u2014 when \u2014 when my mother and sister were escaped\nfrom the labor camp, they made their way down the Volga. And this is thatJanuary 23, 2015\nincident with the little girl falling and being killed in the steamboat. And they\nmade it to \u2014 oh, now I\u2019m drawing a blank. I think Kra-Krasnovodsk, you think\u2019?\nA2: Kra-Krasnovodsk.",
        "A: Krasnovodsk. And then they went from there, down the Caspian Sea to\nPahlevi, right? Or no, actually, I\u2019m skipping something. There was a lo \u2014 there\nwas \u2014 all these people were coming off of these collective farms, or there \u2014 you\nknow, some of them were sent to collective farms, and more in labor camps. And\nthere was a huge mass of people, and they na \u2014 they didn\u2019t know where to put\nthem. So in the southern Soviet Union, they were traveling by train back and\nforth, trying to find a place to \u2014 to go. Finally they ended up getting out after that.\nAnd in that turmoil, that\u2019s when they met my father again, okay?",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: So, because getting out of the Soviet Union already, things were much better\nby then. There was a official, the British were helping to establish these\nresettlement camps, and one was in Teheran, and that\u2019s where my mother and\nMira were there. I\u2019m not sure it was for as long as she says it was, but it was\nmany months. And my mother studied nursing at that point, in English. And so,\nshe did become a Red Cross nurse. And after that, they ended up in India, and\nthere were there as \u2014 as Mira said, you know, for several years, with my mother\nJanuary 23, 2015\nbeing a nurse in the hospital for the orphanage, and Mira went to a convent school\nthat was set up there, again, with British and Polish cooperation.",
        "Q: Okay. Now, let me go back to the Soviet Union a little bit. I want to get a sense\nmore of the geography. So from what I understand from you\u2019re telling me, is that\nthe camp they ended up staying in was bet \u2014 was in Perm, the region of Perm.",
        "A: Oh, the labor camp, yes.",
        "Q: The labor camp. From there they escaped, and made their way to a river, where\nthey were in a steamboat, and then went down to Krasnovodsk, is that wh-where\nyou were saying?",
        "A: They went to Tatishchevo.",
        "Q: Tatishchevo.",
        "A: Near as \u2014",
        "Q: And what is Tatishchevo?",
        "A: It\u2019s a city or town near Saratov.",
        "Q: I see, okay, in Russia itself.",
        "A: In Russia, yes.",
        "Q: And it was in Tatishchevo that they met your father \u2014",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: \u2014 for the first time?",
        "A: Right.\nJanuary 23, 2015",
        "Q: And what was his story, in brief? How did he end up there?",
        "A: Well, he was a reserve officer when the war broke out, so he was called in, and\nhe was almost immediately captured actually, in Lithuania. And then from there\nhe was sent \u2014",
        "Q: Let me stop right there. Was he in eastern Poland\u2019?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And so how did he end up in Lithuania?",
        "A: They were trying to protect the Augusta(ph) Forest canals, and \u2014 from the\nGermans, and they were \u2014 0-or no, maybe it was \u2014 I\u2019m not sure now. I think it was\n\u2014 no, it must have been the Russians that were there. And they got \u2014 they got\ncaught and \u2014 and sent to an internment camp in Lithuania. And from there they\nwere sent \u2014 he was sent to the camp in Kozelsk.",
        "Q: Kozelsk.",
        "A: Or \u2014 or Kozelsk, yeah.",
        "Q: So he was a Russian POW?",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Okay. He was a Polish POW \u2014",
        "A: POW.\nJanuary 23, 2015",
        "Q: \u2014 under the Soviets, excuse me.",
        "A: Right, right.",
        "Q: And \u2014 and he was not \u2014 he was not shot.",
        "A: No, there was \u2014 hi \u2014 at the camp where he was at, there was evidence that these\nofficers were being sent somewhere, but they didn\u2019t know where. And he was\ntaken, actually, to \u2014 they were going to build an airstrip or something up further\nnorth, in the tundra, and \u2014 at Grazovietz they were stopped, because at that point\nGermany had in \u2014 attacked Poland \u2014 I mean, Russia, and so they were camped\nthere for a while. And then, of course, the Polish government agreed, you know,\nth-that \u2014 there was the agreement with the Soviets to form this Polish army.\nA2: Armestu(ph).",
        "A: It was ca \u2014 yeah, was \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah, an amnesty.",
        "A: \u2014 the amnesty. And so then, from there, I \u2014 somehow he \u2014 you know, made his\nway towards Tatishchevo, or Saratov.",
        "Q: And how is it that he met Mira the first time?",
        "A: Well, the story that I heard was that she was warming herself at this stove, and\nmy father came over, and he tried to give you some money, some rubles.\nA2: Well, no, he\u2019s th \u2014 I was holding up a box, a \u2014 a\u2014 a matchbox of some sort.",
        "A: Okay.January 23, 2015\nA2: Well anyway, in that matchbox, Mother gave me pa \u2014 a pile of rubles, or\nsomething like that, and sh-she told me to keep it with me, in case I got lost, or \u2014\nor d-don\u2019t have anything to \u2014 to \u2014 that I would be able to buy some food.",
        "Q: I see. Okay.\nA2: And he \u2014 he put some more of his money into the box, and gave it to me. And\nI refused to take it, Mother wouldn\u2019t let me take it.",
        "A: So instead of the rubles, he put some candy in there, remember?\nA2: Yeah.",
        "A: Okay, so he put some candy in this little box, and \u2014 and then you came back\nanother time, trying to meet up with him to get more candy, I think, or something.\nA2: Oh, I think the \u2014 he \u2014 he earned some soldiers [indecipherable] bought kids\nsome sugar, and some honey.",
        "A: Yeah. The soldiers always shared their rations with the civilians, especially the\nchildren. And then my father, of course, because, you know, he had daughters that\nwere the same age. I\u2019m sure he missed them terribly. And so Mira reminded him,\nyou know, of them.",
        "Q: I see. And did he talk about this \u2014 these stories as well, and this incident?",
        "A: Yeah, he did, yeah, he did.",
        "Q: Okay, so when he met Mira the first time, and so on.\nA2: Mm-hm.\nJanuary 23, 2015",
        "Q: And then Mira introduced him to your mother.",
        "A: Right. Well, as it\u2019s \u2014 as she said, they we-were marching in formation for some\nkind of maneuver, and she saw him and started running up to him, and you know,\nhe broke rank and came over, and met my mother.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Our mother.",
        "Q: Yeah. And then, after the meeting at Tatishchevo, you Mira, and your mom,\nwent further south, 1s this it? Or you were on those trains that were going back and\nforth?",
        "A: Yeah, that was further south, and it was on those trains where they were trying\nto find a place for all these refugees coming out of the camps. And that was really,\nactually worse than the camps, because they were under bare skies, and it was\ncold. By then it was, you know, November, December of \u201941, and there was very\nlittle food, and my mother was \u2014 our mother was trying to find, you know, food,\nand there were various incidences that were just very horrifying. It was actually\nmuch worse than the camp. But eventually they made it to another \u2014 you know, to\n\u2014to aresettlement camp. Actually, my father sent money \u2014 she \u2014 they say \u2014 I\ndon\u2019t know how they managed to stay in mail contact, but our mother asked him\nfor s \u2014 help, because she really \u2014 they were so destitute, she \u2014 they had \u2014 they \u2014\ntheir luggage was stolen, this is the \u2014January 23, 2015\nA2: Sh-She wrote a letter to the gi \u2014 center office of the \u2014 of the forming units.\nShe owned some scrap of torn paper, she managed to send that, and it got to your\nfather.",
        "A: And he sent an incredibly large amount of money, which I\u2019m sure he collected\nfrom the other soldiers, of like 367 \u2014\nA2: Twenty \u2014 300 some \u2014",
        "A: And it\u2019s \u2014 367\u2019s the number I remember. Rubles. And it arrived, it got to my\nmother and her. This 1s when she \u2014 they were both sick.\nA2: Any money se \u2014 being sent by mail, it was a miracle we got that.",
        "A: Yeah, it was \u2014 it was quite a miracle that that money got \u2014 and that really saved\nthem, because they \u2014 at that point my mother had a burlap bag for a dress, and\nthere was no food whatsoever, and they were in some pigsty. I mean, it was just\nreally very hard.",
        "Q: So it sounds like it was almost the first kindness that she had received \u2014",
        "A: Well \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 from all this \u2014 from all of these experiences.",
        "A: Well, could \u2014 probab \u2014 the one that, course, stands out the most.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.January 23, 2015",
        "Q: And then it was after that, and they got better, that \u2014 from where did they leave\nthe Soviet Union?",
        "A: So they made it over to \u2014 oh, now I\u2019m losing my train of thought here.\nA2: Kovachi(ph)?",
        "A: No, no, no, that\u2019s India. Krasnovodsk \u2014 am | saying that right? And then from\nthere, to Pahlevi.",
        "Q: Which is in Iran.",
        "A: Which is in Iran. And then from there to Teheran. And then when she talks\nabout the \u2014 the steep hills, that\u2019s that journey there. And then from Teheran to\nIndia.",
        "Q: Okay. And how many years difference is there between you?",
        "A: Fifteen.",
        "Q: Fifteen. And your parents married where, in what \u2014 in what of these many\nplaces?",
        "A: Well, they \u2014 eventually, neither one of them was going back to communist\nPoland, especially since one of the jobs that my father had, he was a second\nlieutenant, an adjutant, and hi \u2014 one his jobs was to weed out communists from the\narmy, and he\u2019s sent quite a few back. And his friends that ended up in England,\nhis soldier friends, his officer friends that did go back to Poland, disappeared. So\nthe \u2014 the thinking was, if \u2014 if you don\u2019t go back to communist Poland \u2014 and ofJanuary 23, 2015\ncourse my mother and sister knew all about communism, and they weren\u2019t going\nback, so they \u2014 you know, they went to England, and so did my father, after he\nfought in Italy, in Monte Cassino.",
        "Q: He fought in Monte Cassino?",
        "A: He did. And there was a \u2014 again a\u2014 a reli \u2014 a resettlement camp for soldiers in\nHerford, and my sister and mother ended up in Coventry, and that\u2019s not too far\naway. And my mother decided to try to find some of the people she had met, and\nhe being one of them, and I ge \u2014 it was the soldiers\u2019 daily newspaper, something\nlike that, she put an ad in there, and he answered it. And he \u2014 at that point he \u2014 he\nwas in the hospital because he had a accident, and she went to visit him, and the\nrest is history, and here I am.",
        "Q: And let us know his name again?",
        "A: It\u2019s Vavjinitz(ph), and Americans translate that to Lawrence, although I\u2019m not\nsure that\u2019s correct.",
        "Q: Okay, Vavjinitz(ph).",
        "A: Vavjinitz(ph) Soletski(ph).",
        "Q: Soletski(ph). And when you talked about him rooting out \u2014 looking for\ncommunists in the military, that is trying to find them, does this mean the re-\nformed military that was part of the Soviet [indecipherable]",
        "A: Mm-hm.January 23, 2015",
        "Q: \u2014 within the Soviet unit, and then left?",
        "A: Right. He was with Anders \u2014",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: \u2014 with what [indecipherable] Anders, the general.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: In the second corps, fifth division.",
        "Q: I see. And so that was one of his duties.",
        "A: Yeah.",

        "A: I remember that.",
        "A: No, I was in a camp, but Mother had two, quote, jobs in order to give me\nsustenance. After work, she tended to \u2014 to my needs, and her own.",
        "A: Well, she did, because I \u2014 and I was partially responsible, I was a burden. She \u2014\nshe could do so much \u2014 a woman can do so much, but in her case, we didn\u2019t have\npossessions to \u2014 so we could exchange and sell things. We didn\u2019t have very much\nto sustain us.",
        "A: No \u2014no. There was a \u2014 one incident, I had the be \u2014 some kind of an infection,\nor \u2014 on the foot, and they send me to the felcher(ph) \u2014 doctor in camp.

But usually, in a\ncase like this, you don\u2019t work, you don\u2019t eat. And when they \u2014 when the \u2014 the\nsupplies came in, sometimes the supplies were somewhat ridiculous, because they\nwould send ball gowns at the time that you need warm boots. So you couldn\u2019t \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 you couldn\u2019t even buy things.",
        "A: No, no, very little \u2014 distances were considerable, th \u2014 for one things, and\nsecondly, you didn\u2019t have any maps, or whatever, and so that was th \u2014 that\nterritory was wild.",

        "A: Well, it\u2019s a\u2014 someone managed to get out of prison and wor-work himself back\nto the camp, and tell us about it. Although the Russians were supposedly \u2014\nsupposed to inform us, they didn\u2019t.",
        "A: They \u2014 we found out, or at least I was told that they \u2014 the residents of the camp\nfound out, when this guy came in from prison, after he was released.",
        "A: Well no, you di \u2014 you didn\u2019t say anything, I mean, they only \u2014 they\u2019II had to\nadmit that you can le \u2014 go, and try and draw in some of those forming units, but\nthen nothing was ce-certain. Mother and I \u2014 Mother decided to try and draw in\nthose units. She s \u2014 she told them she wa \u2014 would give me to a pryude(ph), which\nis like an orphanage, that she will give me to the orphanage, and sh-she would join\nas a nurse.",
        "A: That worked fine, and she had the permit that that \u2014 she could do so, but the\ncommandant left the \u2014 for some business or something, and then the next\ncommandant didn\u2019t know about the release Mother had, and the \u2014 th-they said \u2014\nthe \u2014 the assistant wouldn\u2019t okay it. So Mother decided to join the car \u2014 th-the\nSleigh that took the men to join one of the units nearby.",
        "A: And somehow it was difficult for her to get few pieces together and join the \u2014\nthe sleigh as it left the camp.",
        "A: We \u2014 we walked \u2014 we walked past the commandant, but Mother didn\u2019t have the\npermit to \u2014 to leave the camp \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 any longer. So we 1s \u2014 we ran away.",
        "A: Yes, it is.",

        "A: About that. We left after the India received its changeover, and the \u2014 became\nnot part of the English empire, but India.",
        "A: Independent, yeah.",
        "A: Well, England. Mother and I went \u2014 went to England to \u2014 to \u2014 then Danuta\u2019s\nfather and my mother married, and we decided to try out American soil.",
        "A: Well, I was college age.",
        "A: Early 50s.",
        "A: In Britain.",
        "A: There was an incident about the goats. After work Mother went to the edge of\nthe camp, and cut down those young twigs that just sprout out leaves. And at that\ntime she used to sing, she used to \u2014 to tell me \u2014 taught me \u2014 well, I guess, the\npoem. I d\u2014I don\u2019t remember the \u2014 that \u2014 the author, whatever, but anyway, we \u2014\nwe were playing, the kids were playing hide and seek or something, and I \u2014 I was\nwith them. They started to go \u2014 go on the loft. Well, going back to the problem\nwhat Mother was doing, making bundles of these twigs to feed the goat, 1t was po\n\u2014 essential that you don\u2019t shake the \u2014 the bundles, because the leaves would fall\noff, and the goats wouldn\u2019t get any food. So you had \u2014 Mother make me be \u2014\nlisten very carefully, and not a-allow, or t-talk to the kids, not to go and play on \u2014\nin the loft. Well, one time the kids made comments about this and that. Finally,January 23, 2015\none said, oh, to the ghost, that they \u2014 that they heard noises, whatever, like finally\none of them says \u2014 says, oh, if we ta \u2014 say a prayer, it will all right.",
        "A: So we started saying a prayer, but the boy \u2014 I don\u2019t know which prayer it was,\nbut anyway, they started saying a prayer, and I was saying the same ti \u2014 prayer,\nbut I\u2014 I was thinking so hard, how am I going to stop all those kids going up\nthere. Finally, I decided not \u2014 not to say a prayer.",
        "A: No... not to say a prayer.",
        "A: Well, he did ...",
        "A: No. It\u2019s a\u2014\nA2: You were wor \u2014 one or two words behind in the prayer, and they thought it\nwas a ghost. Remember that part of it?",
        "A: The what?\nA2: You were saying it, the prayer, one or two words behind, and they thought it\nwas a ghost, remember\u2019?",
        "A: Not that one, no.January 23, 2015\nA2: No?",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Well, I don\u2019t know, you\u2019ve been very patient with me, but \u2014 and this isa\u2014a\nsomewhat unfair trial for me.\n[break]January 23, 2015",
        "A: So, Mira and I have the same mother. My mother met my father in that whole\nturmoil during World War II, after he was released from the prisoner of war camp,\nand she and Mira were released from \u2014 well, they escaped actually, from the labor\ncamp. And it was in Tatishchevo, near Saratov, where was the first Polish army\ncamp that was being gathered from all the soldiers that had remained, that hadn't\nbeen murdered in the Soviet Union. So they met there briefly, and they actually\nmet again later on in Jelibod(ph), which was in Uzbekistan, or I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s\non the border, near Tashkins(ph). Tashkins(ph) was another area where the\nPolish army had gone, and this is maybe 1500 miles or more away from\nTatishchevo, or near Saratov.",
        "A: Well, my mother talked about these experiences the whole time I was growing\nup. And they were rather in disjointed sequence. So when I had my first child, sheJanuary 23, 2015\nagreed to put it all in order, with the help of my father. And so we embarked on\nthis project to get it in chronological order, and get the geography right, and the\nhistory. And I started writing a book about it. And I did lot of research, and you\nknow, interviewed my parents, mostly my father, and also other historians who\nwere aware of \u2014 of this migration, this whole journey of these people that had been\ndeported.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: That at the time was eastern Poland. Today it is Belarus, right on the border\nreally, with Lithuania and \u2014 and not too far from where the current border of\nPoland is.",
        "A: The February 10\" one, yes, in 1940.",
        "A: They were taken first to a camp at \u2014 across the Urals, which would have been\ntechnically Siberia. And I\u2019m trying to remember the \u2014 one was Mikelinska(ph),\ndo you remember that name? And the other one, I am drawing a blank.January 23, 2015",
        "A: But they were first there for maybe a few months, and this was in winter. And\nthen they were taken back to another camp near Perm, which is of Molotov. And\nthat was where they really were for the duration of the time in the \u2014 in the labor\ncamp.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Oh yes, I grew up with these stories, you know, but \u2014 you know, these were\nthings that were discussed, especially at \u2014 during holiday times, or whenever our\nPolish friends would come over, because many of them had very similar stories,\nand they would start to talk about all these things. Or just Sunday dinners, you\nknow, this was something that was so large a part of their lives. Especially my\nmother. You know, my father talked about it, but my mother was very \u2014 you\nknow, she \u2014 she wo \u2014 she went through so much, you know?",
        "A: Right. She was fairly tall for a Polish person, maybe not as tall as I am, but she\nwas, you know, generally speaking, the \u2014 the Soviets took people who wereJanuary 23, 2015\nworking in the country to do the harder jobs, because they were honed better. And\nthe people who were in the cities were doing lighter work. And as Mira was\nsaying, there was no one else f \u2014 to work for them. It was just my mother. And so\nthey came and assessed that she was strong enough, or whatever, to work in the\nforest, and she would have to go and chop off huge branches of trees that they\nfelled, and \u2014 and yes, there was one occasion when she \u2014 I don\u2019t know, you know,\nshe was so tired by then, and \u2014 and malnourished, and just, you know, devastated\nby the whole experience, because for her it was a constant worry about saving\nMira, that she didn\u2019t end up in one of those Soviet orphanages. And \u2014 and so this\ntree was falling on her, and she just kind of stood there, and you know, they \u2014 and\nwatched this tree coming towards her, and at the last second she jumped into like a\npile of rubble, and the \u2014 the branches from this rubble actually cut the \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 broke the fall. So she \u2014 she was in there, and they thought \u2014 the Soviets, the\nbrigadier, the supervisor of the \u2014 of the work team thought she was trying to kill\nherself, you know. And so they got mad at her for \u2014 for, you know, doing that.\nAnd so eventually, actually turned out to be a good thing, because she ended up\ngetting ga new job working \u2014 fixing \u2014 changing the oil on tractors, and also filling\n\u2014 there was one steam tractor that she had to fill water. And she got paid more for\nthat. But, you know, in the co \u2014 in the course of all of that, you know, she di \u2014 sheJanuary 23, 2015\nalmost did end up in jail, because she was very patriotic and she would taunt the\nSoviets, especially the \u2014 the locals, which were typically Ukrainians, or\nByelorussian\u2019s that were the supervisors in these barracks. And she would sing\nPolish patriotic songs, and you know, just really \u2014 she kind of did things that\ndidn\u2019t help her, you know, and that\u2019s another thing that happened. So when she\nwent to court, you know, for this minor incident, they were \u2014 they were just \u2014 you\nknow, it was kind of vengeance from that particular barracks supervisor that didn\u2019t\nlike her.",
        "A: Actually, there were two court incidences. One was the hay, and then there was\nanother one where she was late for work, cause she had gotten \u2014 like gone back to\nget a jacket, or something, because it was starting to rain. And that one was\nactually a much more serious one. But the first time I think they docked her for, I\nthink a third of her pay, which was just astronomical because she wasn\u2019t getting\npaid very much anyway. It was enough to maybe buy a loaf and a half of bread a\nday. And so, you know, to lose that money, it was really, really difficult.",
        "A: Because she was a landowner.January 23, 2015",
        "A: And \u2014 and also, I think they may have also known that her \u2014 they were still\nmarried, even though they were separated, her husband was a \u2014 a soldier, you\nknow, he was sergeant in the army.",
        "A: Right, they \u2014 the Soviets were not quick to let go of these free laborers, so it\nwas somebody that had been let go earlier, and came back and told them about\nthis, and so my mother had tried to get official permission to leave the camp, but\nthey weren\u2019t \u2014 they really did not want to give it to her, so essentially, they\nescaped.",
        "A: Well, that\u2019s much later, actually.",
        "A: That\u2019s much later. Yeah, at \u2014 when \u2014 when my mother and sister were escaped\nfrom the labor camp, they made their way down the Volga. And this is thatJanuary 23, 2015\nincident with the little girl falling and being killed in the steamboat. And they\nmade it to \u2014 oh, now I\u2019m drawing a blank. I think Kra-Krasnovodsk, you think\u2019?\nA2: Kra-Krasnovodsk.",
        "A: Krasnovodsk. And then they went from there, down the Caspian Sea to\nPahlevi, right? Or no, actually, I\u2019m skipping something. There was a lo \u2014 there\nwas \u2014 all these people were coming off of these collective farms, or there \u2014 you\nknow, some of them were sent to collective farms, and more in labor camps. And\nthere was a huge mass of people, and they na \u2014 they didn\u2019t know where to put\nthem. So in the southern Soviet Union, they were traveling by train back and\nforth, trying to find a place to \u2014 to go. Finally they ended up getting out after that.\nAnd in that turmoil, that\u2019s when they met my father again, okay?",
        "A: So, because getting out of the Soviet Union already, things were much better\nby then. There was a official, the British were helping to establish these\nresettlement camps, and one was in Teheran, and that\u2019s where my mother and\nMira were there. I\u2019m not sure it was for as long as she says it was, but it was\nmany months. And my mother studied nursing at that point, in English. And so,\nshe did become a Red Cross nurse. And after that, they ended up in India, and\nthere were there as \u2014 as Mira said, you know, for several years, with my mother\nJanuary 23, 2015\nbeing a nurse in the hospital for the orphanage, and Mira went to a convent school\nthat was set up there, again, with British and Polish cooperation.",
        "A: Oh, the labor camp, yes.",
        "A: They went to Tatishchevo.",
        "A: Near as \u2014",
        "A: It\u2019s a city or town near Saratov.",
        "A: In Russia, yes.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Right.\nJanuary 23, 2015",
        "A: Well, he was a reserve officer when the war broke out, so he was called in, and\nhe was almost immediately captured actually, in Lithuania. And then from there\nhe was sent \u2014",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: They were trying to protect the Augusta(ph) Forest canals, and \u2014 from the\nGermans, and they were \u2014 0-or no, maybe it was \u2014 I\u2019m not sure now. I think it was\n\u2014 no, it must have been the Russians that were there. And they got \u2014 they got\ncaught and \u2014 and sent to an internment camp in Lithuania. And from there they\nwere sent \u2014 he was sent to the camp in Kozelsk.",
        "A: Or \u2014 or Kozelsk, yeah.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: POW.\nJanuary 23, 2015",
        "A: Right, right.",
        "A: No, there was \u2014 hi \u2014 at the camp where he was at, there was evidence that these\nofficers were being sent somewhere, but they didn\u2019t know where. And he was\ntaken, actually, to \u2014 they were going to build an airstrip or something up further\nnorth, in the tundra, and \u2014 at Grazovietz they were stopped, because at that point\nGermany had in \u2014 attacked Poland \u2014 I mean, Russia, and so they were camped\nthere for a while. And then, of course, the Polish government agreed, you know,\nth-that \u2014 there was the agreement with the Soviets to form this Polish army.\nA2: Armestu(ph).",
        "A: It was ca \u2014 yeah, was \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 the amnesty. And so then, from there, I \u2014 somehow he \u2014 you know, made his\nway towards Tatishchevo, or Saratov.",
        "A: Well, the story that I heard was that she was warming herself at this stove, and\nmy father came over, and he tried to give you some money, some rubles.\nA2: Well, no, he\u2019s th \u2014 I was holding up a box, a \u2014 a\u2014 a matchbox of some sort.",
        "A: Okay.January 23, 2015\nA2: Well anyway, in that matchbox, Mother gave me pa \u2014 a pile of rubles, or\nsomething like that, and sh-she told me to keep it with me, in case I got lost, or \u2014\nor d-don\u2019t have anything to \u2014 to \u2014 that I would be able to buy some food.",
        "A: So instead of the rubles, he put some candy in there, remember?\nA2: Yeah.",
        "A: Okay, so he put some candy in this little box, and \u2014 and then you came back\nanother time, trying to meet up with him to get more candy, I think, or something.\nA2: Oh, I think the \u2014 he \u2014 he earned some soldiers [indecipherable] bought kids\nsome sugar, and some honey.",
        "A: Yeah. The soldiers always shared their rations with the civilians, especially the\nchildren. And then my father, of course, because, you know, he had daughters that\nwere the same age. I\u2019m sure he missed them terribly. And so Mira reminded him,\nyou know, of them.",
        "A: Yeah, he did, yeah, he did.\nJanuary 23, 2015",
        "A: Right. Well, as it\u2019s \u2014 as she said, they we-were marching in formation for some\nkind of maneuver, and she saw him and started running up to him, and you know,\nhe broke rank and came over, and met my mother.",
        "A: Our mother.",
        "A: Yeah, that was further south, and it was on those trains where they were trying\nto find a place for all these refugees coming out of the camps. And that was really,\nactually worse than the camps, because they were under bare skies, and it was\ncold. By then it was, you know, November, December of \u201941, and there was very\nlittle food, and my mother was \u2014 our mother was trying to find, you know, food,\nand there were various incidences that were just very horrifying. It was actually\nmuch worse than the camp. But eventually they made it to another \u2014 you know, to\n\u2014to aresettlement camp. Actually, my father sent money \u2014 she \u2014 they say \u2014 I\ndon\u2019t know how they managed to stay in mail contact, but our mother asked him\nfor s \u2014 help, because she really \u2014 they were so destitute, she \u2014 they had \u2014 they \u2014\ntheir luggage was stolen, this is the \u2014January 23, 2015\nA2: Sh-She wrote a letter to the gi \u2014 center office of the \u2014 of the forming units.\nShe owned some scrap of torn paper, she managed to send that, and it got to your\nfather.",
        "A: And he sent an incredibly large amount of money, which I\u2019m sure he collected\nfrom the other soldiers, of like 367 \u2014\nA2: Twenty \u2014 300 some \u2014",
        "A: And it\u2019s \u2014 367\u2019s the number I remember. Rubles. And it arrived, it got to my\nmother and her. This 1s when she \u2014 they were both sick.\nA2: Any money se \u2014 being sent by mail, it was a miracle we got that.",
        "A: Yeah, it was \u2014 it was quite a miracle that that money got \u2014 and that really saved\nthem, because they \u2014 at that point my mother had a burlap bag for a dress, and\nthere was no food whatsoever, and they were in some pigsty. I mean, it was just\nreally very hard.",
        "A: Well \u2014",
        "A: Well, could \u2014 probab \u2014 the one that, course, stands out the most.",
        "A: Yeah.January 23, 2015",
        "A: So they made it over to \u2014 oh, now I\u2019m losing my train of thought here.\nA2: Kovachi(ph)?",
        "A: No, no, no, that\u2019s India. Krasnovodsk \u2014 am | saying that right? And then from\nthere, to Pahlevi.",
        "A: Which is in Iran. And then from there to Teheran. And then when she talks\nabout the \u2014 the steep hills, that\u2019s that journey there. And then from Teheran to\nIndia.",
        "A: Fifteen.",
        "A: Well, they \u2014 eventually, neither one of them was going back to communist\nPoland, especially since one of the jobs that my father had, he was a second\nlieutenant, an adjutant, and hi \u2014 one his jobs was to weed out communists from the\narmy, and he\u2019s sent quite a few back. And his friends that ended up in England,\nhis soldier friends, his officer friends that did go back to Poland, disappeared. So\nthe \u2014 the thinking was, if \u2014 if you don\u2019t go back to communist Poland \u2014 and ofJanuary 23, 2015\ncourse my mother and sister knew all about communism, and they weren\u2019t going\nback, so they \u2014 you know, they went to England, and so did my father, after he\nfought in Italy, in Monte Cassino.",
        "A: He did. And there was a \u2014 again a\u2014 a reli \u2014 a resettlement camp for soldiers in\nHerford, and my sister and mother ended up in Coventry, and that\u2019s not too far\naway. And my mother decided to try to find some of the people she had met, and\nhe being one of them, and I ge \u2014 it was the soldiers\u2019 daily newspaper, something\nlike that, she put an ad in there, and he answered it. And he \u2014 at that point he \u2014 he\nwas in the hospital because he had a accident, and she went to visit him, and the\nrest is history, and here I am.",
        "A: It\u2019s Vavjinitz(ph), and Americans translate that to Lawrence, although I\u2019m not\nsure that\u2019s correct.",
        "A: Vavjinitz(ph) Soletski(ph).",
        "A: Mm-hm.January 23, 2015",
        "A: Right. He was with Anders \u2014",
