        "Q: O.K. I would like to begin by asking you your complete name.",
        "A: O.K. My complete name is Eddie Helmwood Willner. I was born with the name\nHelmwood Willner and the name Eddie was given to me later in Belgium as a refugee\nchild.",
        "Q: When and where were you born?",
        "A: I was born on the 15th of August, 1926 in Munchglablak, Germany, which is West\nGermany near Cologne-Dusseldorf, a town of about 150,000 people.",
        "Q: Could you tell me about how the Eddie came about?",
        "A: O.K. When the Kristallnacht happened in Germany, my father decided at that time that\nhis son has to get out of Germany if he cannot get out of Germany and my father was one\nof those Germans who believed because he served the German Army in World War I,\nthat they would not touch him since he was decorated and in the beginning they did make\nexceptions but later on it was all the same. When he decided it wouldn't, it would be the\nsame like everybody else, he wanted to get me out of Germany so he sent me, they put\nme on a train to Brussels, Belgium where I was picked up in Brussels by a Jewish refugee\norganization which placed me with a Dutch family. And when I lived with this Dutch\nJewish family, uh, I was of course sent to school and I was told that I could not have the\nname Helmwood in Belgium it was too German and the Germans were still hated from\nWorld War I so they gave me the name Eddie and I, the name I kept since today, until\ntoday.",
        "Q: I am going to ask about the Dutch family, but first I would like to ask about the taking\nleave of your parents. Do you remember saying goodbye to them?",
        "A: Yes, I remember saying goodbye to them. When the papers came that I could, was\nallowed to leave Germany from the police, my father, uh, uh, had almost what I felt, we\nfelt was a heart attack, but it wasn't - he was just over excited and uh he almost passed\nout and it was quite a thing for him and for my mother of course too to get me out of\nGermany, to know me on the safe uh side, and uh, it was, it was for me as a boy, it wasn't\nas shocking as, because I was too young, it was almost like going, being sent to an uncle\nor aunt in a faraway place, but uh, I, the only thing I was worried about was leaving my\nparents behind. Because I knew at that time already what this was all about.",
        "Q: Did they give you anything to take with you ?",
        "A: No, I think the uh, uh, the uh, uh, laws at that time were you couldn't take any shoes,\nextras, I could take my clothing along. No, I, I do have a kidoscop, a silver kidoscop, that\nI took along and that was about all. It was wrapped up in uh my clothing.",
        "Q: Do you still have that?",
        "A: I still have that. And it was saved by non-Jewish people.",
        "Q: You mentioned your father had been in the German Army I understand",
        "A: Yes. Uh, which, uh, when Hitler came to power in 1933, uh, Germany wanted to rearm,\nof course, and, uh, the military, uh, were, uh, in vogue again and uniforms and uh medals\nwere being worn because Hitler wanted a new army, a big army, and as a result, by Field\nMarshall Von Hindenberg, which was the President of Germany, Hitler was the\nChancellor, of course, they created the Iron, the Cross of Honor which was given, as I\nunderstand, to people like my, my father who had earned uh, the Iron Cross during World\nWar I and who had served for four years on the front lines. In other words, if he had\nserved probably in the rear he probably wouldn't get it. But it was given uh to a lot of\npeople just because Hitler wanted to make it popular again that the army is great and\nmedals are great and so on and to uh. So, my father was uh, was given by the authorities a\ncertificate with a medal which I still have to this day which was saved by a German\nCatholic family that he gave it to that had also served with my father in World War I.\nAnd uh the certificate uh I, reads basically uh - in the name of the Fuhrer and Reich\nChancellor, which was Hitler, of course, given in my father's name, and uh, in uh, it gives\nthe law that was passed to give this to people and I think 1t was a mistake to give it\nprobably to the Jews but some of them slipped through. I don't know if everybody got it\nbut I, I understand there are other people got it and uh, it says the Cross of Honor for\nfront line combatants, and the date on it is, the, the name of the city, Muchenglabach\n(ph), is mentioned on there, the 7th December, 1934. And uh by order of the police\npresident and uh, it is of course the swastika on it can be seen and the stamp that is on\nthere and the city seal and the certificate 1, W 1 F.",
        "Q: Do you have the medal with you?",
        "A: Yes, I do have the medal with me too. This is the Iron Cross and this 1s the Cross of\nHonor which were, which was worn even on the uniform and sometimes in a smaller, in a\nsmall version of it on civilian clothing.",
        "Q: And how were you able to get these ?",
        "A: Well, my father had a, you cannot call it a wallet, but it is a leather folder and I happened\nto know the story of this. He kept his war pictures in here. And, uh, the pictures, uh and\nsome other pictures were given, and plus these medals were stuck in, he had given to this\nfamily and they gave it back to me. The leather wallet here, it is very heavy leather, and\nis, the story is that it was from a saddle, ah, ah, it was shot from underneath my father\nduring the war uh, and, uh, the saddle was riddled by bullets so it couldn't be used\nanymore and he got a new saddle, and so from the old saddle, he locally he had a little\nwallet made to put his war pictures in here. And, uh, uh, and it says on there Russia 1915\nnear Smorngorn, so apparently that's where this happened, the incident, and that's all I\nknow about that. Except that my father didn't get hurt at all. The horse was dead but, and\nthe saddle was uh bullet ridden and uh but my father didn't get hurt.",
        "Q: O.K. Now you were twelve, thirteen years old, went to Belgium, and you lived with a\nDutch Jewish family. What was their family name?",
        "A: Their name was Leek, L - E - E- K. And the lady was named, by name of Wanda Carr.\nAnd they were both Jewish and had two children which were already uh grown-ups and I\nlived them as their little brother and until the war started in 1940.",
        "Q: Did they have to explain your being in the family to any of the authorities?",
        "A: No. No. There was no problem.",
        "Q: And between December '39 when you arrived and May '40 when war broke out, what\nwas your daily routine?",
        "A: My daily routine was only going to school to learn what languages and eventually I also\nhad to go and see a rabbi to be bar mitzvah, which I never was, and uh because the war\nstarted in meantime. The family was not very religious but uh they did insist that I take\nlessons to be Bar Mitzvah. Uh, an additional thing uh which I should not forget is that my\nparents about six months later also arrived in Belgium but without papers. They had, they\nwere able to get across the border with some guide because we were very near the border\nmy father knew a lot of people and some Christian friends helped him to get across the\nborder.",
        "Q: Did you meet up with you parents at that point?",
        "A: Yes, my parents came to Belgium in 19, uh 39, probably the middle of '39, and uh, they\ndid not have any money had to leave everything behind, they just had to walk across the\nborder. And uh, they were in a refugee status in Belgium and uh, they were furnished a\nlittle room which was not big enough for me to live with them, but it was agreed by them\nthat I would remain with the Dutch family where I was very happy uh and it was a rather\nlarge family, and, but I was able to see my parents on weekends. And during the week\ntoo. And, uh, till of course the war came and that's another story.",
        "Q: Let's talk about that. What do you remember, starting with ?",
        "A: O.K., O.K. Uh, my father was considered a political refugee from Germany. Now\npolitical refugees from Germany were not just Jews but they were communists,\ndemocrats, anybody who had fled Germany because of Hitler. And when the war started,\nthe Belgiums and the French, uh, arrested everybody that was German, men first, uh,\nmostly men, in some cases some women, but my mother and I did not get arrested\nbecause we were German. My father was arrested because he was a German and they\nknew that he was Jewish, but these were the laws and they arrested everybody that was\nGerman, and put them in internment camps - not concentration camps but internment\ncamps in southern France - St. Cyprien, Gurs, Rivesaltes and there were several others.\nNow at the time my father was arrested, by the police of course, Belgium police, we only\nknew that all these men were being transported to France because the German advance\ncame very fast and they had to put them somewhere. At that time we decided, my mother\nand I decided, or rather my mother decided, that we should go and look for my father. We\nknew southern France, we had some names, but we weren't sure. So we tried to get across\nthe border ahead of the German Army into France. At the border, Belgian, at the Belgian-\nFrance, uh French border, uh we were arrested for being Germans. They looked at our ID\ncards, Belgian ID card, which were for foreigners, and it said of course nationality\nGerman. We were arrested by the police at the border, trying to cross, and were put in\nprison. Uh, my mother was put in the women's section, and I, for the first time in my life,\nwas in a prison cell, and that was one of the worse experience, experiences up to that\ndate, of my life, because I was in solitary so to say, I was all by myself in a cell, for\nalmost a week. And the Germans bombed the city. I can't recall the city right now but it\nwas at the border, it was a small town, Vavik (ph) was the name of the city, Vavik (ph).\nAnd, uh, the women's section was served by nuns and I got to see my mother only once\nwhen she was being walked in the courtyard. After a week, or about a week, we were all\nassembled in the courtyard, all, more, more, I would think, there were mostly Jews from\nGermany and put on a train under heavy guard and sent to southern France to the\n, which 1s rather large camp which later on became more\nfamous because they put uh the Jews from Baden (Ballon) (ph) in there and other people.\nIt was originally a camp that was created by the French to put the remnants of the French,\nof the uh Spanish uh army who were fighting Franco in there when they fled to France\nthey were put in there. But most of them they were gone by the time we came there.\nThere were a few of them left who had not been resettled. And we were put in the\n, which in the Pyrenees, in the southern part of France. Uh, then\nthe war was over pretty quick which we all know, and uh, where to go. There were\nreleases everyday people got released. If you had papers to go to some foreign country,\nthe French were glad to get rid of the people. The food was terrible there and people\nwere, there were no killings, mass killings or anything like that but uh people died from\nhunger. If you didn't have any packages coming in from the outside there was a good\nchance you would die from hunger there. And there is a very large cemetery which I\nvisited after the war, and uh, I assume that most people are buried there. There were no\ncrematoriums, uh crematoriums, and uh, so, uh the camp itself was very, very bad. It was\nmuddy, it was filthy, it was uh full of fleas, uh uh and it was just a makeshift camp. And\nuh so then the time came for some people to leave to be released, and uh uh, as we know\nit was the unoccupied zone of France, and uh but the Germans did have some control\nbecause Germans did come there with the French, the Vichy police, or Vichy government\nofficials, uh and uh, made sure that uh certain people are kept in there, but by that I mean\nprobably German communists who were so-called enemies of the German state. Now\nwhen it came to the women and children, like my mother and myself, uh they say can you\ngo anyplace. And we decided we would look for my father and it was also at that time\ndetermined that my father as in the which is on the\nMediterranean coast. I failed to mention that the first camp 1s toward the Atlantic coast,\none in the Pyrennnes and one is the Bas-Pyrennes of France, so we said we had\na destination finally; we said we wanted to join my father. We didn't know whether or not\nhe was going to be released but he was there.",
        "Q: What year is this?",
        "A: I am talking about 1940, late. Uh, we traveled to this place, we found my father, and uh,\nthrough again some help of the French, but at the time we were all speaking French pretty\nwell, uh, we uh, went to a little town called Auchtafa (ph) in the Pyrenees, near in, uh\nvery close to the Spanish border, near Pier-pinon (ph) which 1s the place and\nthe people were very helpful, the French in this particular, very small village in the\nmountains and uh who were uh had a lot of vineyards and that was their business mostly\nup there. And the French priest who was in a nearby parish had a house in this little place\nnear the church, and he made his house available to some Jewish refugees and there were\nabout three families living in this house. So my mother and I got refuge there, then we\nwent to visit my father and there were visiting hours I think twice a week. We went to see\nmy father and, uh, this went on for a couple of weeks or months, and uh, during one of\nthe visits, we didn't go into the camp - there was sort of visiting enclosure with barbed\nwire, and we could sit and chat for an hour or so, and during one of the visits when the\nvisit was over, and they said all visitors leave, the uh French policeman who was in\ncharge of the group there, Vichy policeman, told me where, that I wasn't going to leave,\nand uh, I say well I came in, uh, I am already resettled. All he said I am not considered a\nchild anymore, I am a man. I was fourteen at the time, and uh, I was kept in, just like that.\nThey say you stay with your father here, you're you're not a child, you're a man. So all of\na sudden my status changed, I was not able to go back and stay with my father. Uh - I\nwas, uh, among a group of men, I was the youngest one among a group of mostly\nGerman Jews or also some, one German communist I remember and one German\nnobleman who had fought the Nazis who had, was fleeing from the Nazis and got caught\nthere. And he was later delivered, uh turned over too to the Nazis when they came\n. Well, anyway, he, uh I was in another camp in and then\na year later the rumors came, in 1941, 1942 I guess, uh this was still the end of 1941, the\nrumor came that all the Jews are going to be transferred to camps, work camps in\nGermany, and uh the French of course wanted to get rid of us and the Germans needed\nlabor. Uh, in part some of the people were shipped to labor camps in France. This was not\na labor camp, this, this was just, St. Cyprien was just an internment camp, there was no\nwork being done there, it was uh on sand, on a sandy beach actually on the\nMediterranean. And uh, but people, people were being continually shipped out in groups\nand to labor camps throughout southern France. Well, then the word came that's not\ncompletely true, some people are also being shipped out to Germany, to concentration\ncamps. At that time we were very well aware of concentration camps and concentration\ncontrary to what some people think that some people say well we didn't know there were\nsuch concentration camps, I already knew it as a child before I went to Belgium, because\npeople used to make jokes about Hitler and say well keep your mouth shut otherwise you\nwill go to concentration camp and on the Kristallnacht, and that is a story I missed by the\nway, uh, when Jews were arrested in Germany, uh, my father left our home to look after\nhis father and was not arrested, and it was just a coincidence and uh, his brother was\narrested and his, uh my mother's brother was arrested and sent to Dachau Concentration\nCamp. Well, uh the uh place my father went to was about twenty miles from where we\nlived and his father lived in the country in a home all by himself but his younger, my\nfather's younger brother lived with him, and he was married to a non-Jew. And uh which\nis also an interesting story but I am getting off the subject there a little bit. She was\noffered to get a divorce from him because her brothers were in the Nazi party. And she\nrefused. She say, she said will stay with him in the bad days, she will stay with him in the\ngood days. And, but he was still living there, but his wife had taken refuge someplace\nwhen he was arrested and when my father came to his father's home, in\n, which is near Muchenglablak (ph), excuse me, they were\ndemolishing the house inside. And there were Nazi storm troopers up there. As my father\nwalked in and see what was going on, the storm troopers were from another city\napparently, not from the same town, there was a common thing that they brought in\npeople from outside, there there were no - but the Chief of Police was present, a small\npolice force, and it so happened that the Chief of Police had been sitting in uh grammar\nschool on the same bench with my father. And he recognized my father right away. He\nsaid, Ziechfred (ph), what, what are you doing here? Was I looking after my father. He\nsaid, uh, well you're not supposed to be here. But he said nobody told me and uh so he\ntook him to the police station. He said I can't do but arrest you. I have to uh, anybody\nwho shows up has to be arrested, so I have to take you police station to your status.\nBREAK police chiefs and let him see his brother in jail who was later on transported to\nDachau and uh so knowing that my father had the Iron Cross and he had it too, my father\nalways wore it in miniature uh form on his uh suit, particularly during the Nazi era,\nbecause he wanted to show that he was as good a citizen as anybody else, he did his duty\nfor his country and so on and so. Uh, and he said, well he said we have to do something\nfor you. I, I don't see where a front-line combatant should should be in jail the guy said.\nSo he called the local police in Muchenglablak and they ordered that my father be sent\nback, but they didn't specify that he be sent back under escort or without escort, so this\npoliceman took it on his own to send, to put my father on the bus and say when you get\nback to your hometown, you report to the police. He didn't send another policeman with\nhim. My father never did. And therefore escaped arrest and was not arrested during\nKristallnacht or the day after.",
        "Q: Let's back up a little bit to talk about Kristallnacht. Do you remember seeing synagogues\nburning?",
        "A: I don't remember seeing synagogue burning but I remember the synagogue the day or two\ndays after, after 1t was burned, because uh we had to uh, uh, move out of German schools\ninto a Jewish school. Uh, and the last school I attended, the Jewish school, was right in\nthe, in the same building as the synagogue was. So we weren't able to go to school\nanymore. As a matter of fact I received a certificate from my teacher, uh Jewish teacher,\nonly Jews were taught by Jews, and it said in there this letter 1s instead of certificate\nbecause the certificate was destroyed by fire, which was the fire in the synagogue, and\nuh, this man by the way is still living in New York, my old head teacher from the Jewish\nschool and he is 87 years old today and I'm still in touch with him. And he saved his life\nby being hidden by two Christian families in the same town, Muchenglablak. He survived\nthe war in Much.. and came to New York after the war. He had no children. Extremely\nunusual, extremely unusual. But I uh believe, I am not sure, that he, the people that hid\nhim were fellow teachers. And the women dyed their hair blonde, to survive the war.",
        "Q: The synagogue was totally destroyed?",
        "A: The synagogue was totally destroyed. Uh, there was an incident - the city, uh the Jewish\ncommunity was apparently well liked and the anti-Semitism was not as bad as it might\nhave been in some other German cities. And uh the police was sort of decent and didn't,\nof course the Nazis weren't and the storm troopers weren't and the SS weren't, uh, but the\npolice were sort of decent because they respected the community. But there were some\nbad ones too, but in general, the police saw to it that not too people were bodily harmed.",
        "Q: Do you remember other buildings that were destroyed as well?",
        "A: Yes, the rabbi's house was, the, the, he lived in an apartment house. The furniture was\nthrown out through the window and we went by there on the way to school. And there\nwas a piano on, on the sidewalk, smashed and other things, many other things. I\nremember that. And there were other homes which I didn't see of course where they\nthrew things out into the street. And the stores of course. Since we had one main street\nthere where there were a lot of stores, that was also street very close to our school and we\nwalked through there many times and all the Jewish stores had their windows smashed.",
        "Q: What had been your father's occupation?",
        "A: My father was uh, as a representative for a silk tie factory in Krayfeld (ph) and uh, which\nis another town which 1s a silk capital, was the silk capital of Germany, and he worked as\na representative for, for this company. That was his occupation.",
        "Q: Did he have his own business?",
        "A: Not his own business, no.",
        "Q: O.K. Now when you were at the camp, went with your mother. (end of Tape)",
        "A: .... NO way, and uh to continue the story about that particular camp, -,\nwhen these rumors I started talking about came that people are transported to Germany,\nor to Poland maybe to labor camps, uh, my father felt we had to get out and the fact that\nuh we both spoke French pretty well there were occasionally French gendarmes - these\nwere our guards who were at the uh the camp was surrounded by barbed wire and when\nthese people did guard duty, some of them were sympathetic and every once in a while\nsomebody would throw me a piece of bread. They came, there was one particular French\ngendarme who uh, whenever he was on duty I, he had something for me. He threw it over\nthe fence, and I asked him one day if he heard that people are being transported. He says\nyes, if you can get out, get out. When he said if you can get out, get out, I thought he is\ninsinuating to me that with him I have a chance to get out through the barbed wire under\nthe fence when he 1s on guard duty, and that is exactly what happened. Both my father\nand I escaped when this man was on duty - he turned around, he walked away like he\ndidn't see it, this was at night. And we went to the village where my mother lived, and uh\nwith the O.K. of the priest and with the O.K. of the mayor, who happened to be a\ncommunist, of that city, the mayor and the Catholic priest worked hand in hand, an\nunusual team, but at the time they thought they were fighting the Germans and I don't\nknow but I suspect that the mayor was a member of the . He was\nvery anti-German and he tried to help. And by helping I mean that we had shelter from\nthe priest. And he issued a phoney ID card. This was a real ID card but the number of the\nID card was not registered at City Hall, and he took a big chance. Nothing happened to\nhim that I know, but we were arrested later on based on that ID card, when Vichy police\ncame under the guide of the Nazis, they raided places, they were looking for people, and I\nmean, also in addition they picked whoever else they could, particularly Jews. And\nduring one of those checks, and we, I don't know to this date whether we were turned in\nby somebody, or the mayor was turned in by somebody or the priest was turned in by\nsomebody. Uh, they also , | know that. But somebody must have told\nsomething, must have spoke something, either was unhappy about us or unhappy about\nthe mayor or whatever was going on there. And uh so one day during a raid, we were all\narrested and then we were shipped off and they compared the uh, uh IDs with what\nrecords were at City Hall and they found out they were phoney ID cards. And that is how\nwe got caught. From there on we were sent in by train to Drancy, which is the big camp\nnear Paris which was a collection camp for Jews from all over France. And uh after the\nwar I found out what transport number I was in. Of course I didn't know at that time,\nnobody was telling anything. We stayed several days in Drancy, (cough) excuse me, and\nnot knowing what our destination was and this was my father, mother and myself, plus\nthe other Jewish families who were arrested in that little town in the south of France, uh,\nit was on 12th September, uh, 1942, that our transport was put together and these\ntransport usually a thousand people, uh cattle cars, going out of Drancy, near Paris, to the\neast. There were rumors where we were going, but not rumors that we were going to be\ngassed or anything rumors of labor camps and so on. Uh, the transport that I mentioned\nand the date I found that after war because uh there is a book which was made uh, uh,\npublished with the help of the French government and I think the Krazfelds (ph) had the\nhand in it and I have the book and in this book is my name, my parents, name,\nnationality, date of births, and the people that I was with on our transport, and from then I\nfound after the war that our transport was transport number 31 out of Drancy, and I\nunderstand there total of 75,000 people involved in transports out of Paris, out of Drancy,\nand, like I say, we were transport number 31 and that transport left on the 12th of\nSeptember, 1942 for Germany.",
        "Q: Tell us a little bit about the trip.",
        "A: Excuse me. The cattle cars were packed with people. There was very little food, what\npeople had on them, and the only thing that I can remember that were given during the\ntrip, on the trip towards Auschwitz, which I didn't know at the time but I found out later,\nuh, was water. We were guarded by uh Germans and in some places where we stopped-\nthey had to get also food, we were given some water and uh, were able to empty buckets\nwe used as toilets. But there was hardly space for everyone to lie down. Some people had\nto sit up all night, people were packed in like sardines, several people died, some people\ncommitted suicide. In my particular car, a lady doctor gave birth to her own baby. And\nthe child of course didn't survive; I don't know if she did. Uh. There was a most unusual\nevent in my cattle car. Uh, being from Germany, my father was able to read through the\ncracks of the wood some of the station names that we went through, so we definitely\nknew that we were going to upper Salezia, which is now Poland, and which is near\nBreslau, what used to be the German city of Breslau, and where most of the concentration\ncamps that we found out after the war were located, including Auschwitz, and a lot of the\nsubcamps. Uh, the cars were opened at stations every once in a while and people were\nbeaten up mercilessly and outside of that, people were starving. Uh, people didn't have\nany food, didn't bring anything along. Some people stuffed their pockets full of\nsomething and they ate it, but I don't remember ever having been given any food except\nthat we were given water and in some cases people weren't even given water. So that a lot\nof people arrived dead or starved or whatever. Uh, on the way to Auschwitz, and again, I\ndidn't know the destination at that time, at one station in, uh, I can't recall the name right\nnow, in upper Salezia, a small station, the doors were opened, and they said all men out.\nThat was the order. All men, working men that were able to work, out. Uh, like I said,\nthis was not arrival at Auschwitz or any other camp, but it was just a small station, and\nuh, at that time I had to make a decision. In the meantime I was going on 16, and I was\npretty strong because I had worked that summer in the French vineyards to make some\nmoney. And it was hard work so I had pretty strong muscles and uh it wasn't just that but\nuh uh the decision I had to make whether I was a child staying with the women or men. I\nwanted to stay with my father. And I came out and we didn't know at that time what it\nmeant. Work meant able to survive. To live. And, but we didn't know what it meant for\nmy mother and from that transport number 31, according to the, this book from the\nFrench government, of, of the thousand people or so, I think there are six survivors. They\ndetermined after the war. So all the women and children went straight into the gas\nchamber. At that point I searched for my mother after the war, and I wound up with the\nGerman Red Cross, or International Red Cross, at and they had a listing saying\nthat all the women and children went straight into the gas chamber, of that transport. So I\nassume that my mother was gassed right away on arrival at Auschwitz which was\nsometimes in September 1942. Uh, the decision I made to stay with my father was my\nlucky decision, and again, uh, maybe there was at the time a feeling if you worked, you\ncan survive. And we didn't know, we thought maybe the women are also going to be put\nto work in factories or whatever. But I didn't know the gas chamber would be at the other\nend. Uh, again, I didn't know about my mother until after the war, and I searched for my\nmother in Brussels, Belgium, and in Muchenglablak, and various other places but I didn't\nfind her, until I was determined that she actually did perish. Uh, my father and I were sent\nfrom that place in trucks to a small camp which was a subcamp of Auschwitz and in\nthose days these small subcamps were called\n, which means forced labor camp of the Chief of\nthe German Police and the Vice Furhur of the SS which was Himmler of course. They\nhad large names but they were small concentration camps in other words, under the\ncontrol of the SS. Not always guarded by SS but sometimes by storm troopers, sometimes\nby soldiers, or helpers from the east which were in some case Ukrainians, or Polish guys,\nand frankly from my experience, I preferred the German soldiers who were guarded to\nsome of the other people who tried to prove they were better than the Germans and didn't\nlike the Jews and were very uh sadistic sometimes. I'm not saying that the Germans or the\nNazis were not sadistic but the uh first experience we have from these guards were the\nhorrible experience and uh I always felt that I was maybe more German than they were.\nThey called, so-called people who lived in the territories. They were sometimes Polish,\nsometimes German, in upper Salezia, and at that time they had opted to be German and\nsome of the people didn't speak German that well. Their Polish was a lot better. And uh,\nthe uh, experience we had, the initial experience was not very good. Of course, the initial\nexperience was the roughest experience under the circumstances.",
        "Q: Why don't you talk about that.",
        "A: O.K. Prior to going to a larger camp, we were in two smaller camps and each camp was, I\ndon't remember exactly the, I would say less than a thousand people. I think in one case it\nwas six hundred and the other one may have been a thousand. One was the camp of Lazy\n-L-A-Z-Y, which was mainly for the construction or reconstruction of bombed-out\nrailways. And we went out everyday to the, uh, we be marched under guard, to the sites\nwhere the railways had been bombed by the Russians I suppose. In those days I don't\nthink the Americans were coming out that far. And they bombed two transports,\nwhatever, and also building new railways, which was the hardest work because people\nwere not strong and the food was very limited and uh, uh, the people were beaten to death\non the job or in the camp. And the system was at that time whenever they needed more\nlabor, new people were coming and being fed into the camp. Supposed they had in the\ncamp of a thousand people, they had a hundred people who died during a week or two on\nthe job. Well, they got a hundred more from a transport or from Auschwitz or wherever\nthey got them from to be sent in to fill up the void. And uh, so we were also digging up\nunexploded bombs which, and, and this I did twice during my concentration camp career,\nuh, which was very dangerous of course and the German guard would stay pretty far\naway in case something exploded. And some people did get killed that way. Uh, but, uh,\nrailroad work was probably among the hardest work that we ever did because people\nwere not strong enough to lift up the rails, and uh, some people got crushed under the\nrails, and people fell down. Our clothing was uh, uh, limited. In the wintertime we had\nclogs on, we had shoes with wooden soles, blue/white stripped uniforms. In the beginning\nwe had our own with the Star of David on it. Later on we got the blue/white-striped\nuniforms. Uh, but it was very, we weren't properly dressed, we didn't have the proper\nfood, and people were just uh walking skeletons in a lot of cases. And a lot of people\ncommitted suicide. This was the most, the most vivid recalling I can do about the camps,\nis not people being killed but people committing suicide. Particularly in one camp that I\nam coming to later on which was the last camp. Uh, but nobody thought they were going\nto survive. Uh, the first camp, uh, was like I said most railroad and then later on we were\nsent to another camp and I don't know if the first camp was done away with, but the\nwhole camp was transferred. We went to another camp and uh, when we worked on\nconstruction of bunkers and buildings for the Batta (ph) Shoe Factory which I assume\nwas producing shoes for the German army because I don't think we were used for any\nnon-military projects. They were all always in support of the military. So we worked near\nthe Batta (ph) Shoe Factory. Uh and I was lucky in, I guess, in, in general I was lucky\nthat I was able to speak German. I had an advantage over the other Jews who were\ncoming from Poland, who didn't speak German unless they spoke Yiddish, and uh,\nYiddish to some unfortunately, to some of the Germans, to the SS was like waving a red,\nuh, red drape or something in front of because that showed he's Jewish. And if you're able\nto speak German, correct German, you got sometimes less beatings, or you were also able\non the job to execute an order right away. You understand the order was given\nimmediately. And that was very important. Some people picked it up pretty fast. Some of\nthe other people, if they came from France, I'm not just saying uh Polish Jews, but the\nJews from other countries, and in the first camps we were all Jews which changed later\non through mix. Uh, and uh, if you were able to speak German and follow orders you got\nless beatings, you were able to do it right away, and if you had a team, uh, sometimes we\nhad to work in teams uh loading lorries (ph) and we were two people or four people as a\nteam and all of them spoke German. We tried to team up that way or working that way\nbecause it always worked better than shouting one, two, three or something like that in\nGerman. And the Germans, being very militaristic, and frankly there is something I\nforgot. I was grew up that way, to be almost like a, like a Prussian. My father was very\ngreat disciplinarian and uh, when he said go, I went, and when uh he said jump, I jumped,\nand so on and so on. It wasn't like our kids are today. And, but it helped me later on,\nbeing able to jump when the Nazis said to jump, you know, and to do things and\nunderstanding what they meant and doing it sort of a little bit of a military way. Uh,\nwhich I understand from uh, from other people that I swapped stories with after the war,\nit is true in many cases. If, if you knew the German language it definitely helped. And in\nsome case, uh, uh, when we were building bunkers you had to read the diagram, how to,\ninto uh concrete, solid concrete you have to put uh wiring and uh wiring has to be wired\nup a certain way that the designs, if it is rounded and so on, and it has to be tight with uh,\nwith uh the wire, the smaller wire, and if you're able to read the diagram from German,\nyour job was much easier. You didn't make any mistakes. And so on, so that helped.\nAnyway, the camps, the second camp I went to, I made by first great friend for life, uh\nalthough I still did have my father with me, but a youngster of my age was a Dutch Jew\nand I also forgot to mention since I lived with a Dutch Jewish family in Brussels,\nBelgium, I also picked up Dutch, which was spoken at home, but Dutch and Flemish is\nalmost the same. And so I was very fluent in Dutch by that time, and I picked, uh, or he\npicked me, I picked him, uh, uh, a young man my age whose father and brother-in-law\nwas also in the same camp. So we teamed up. We were about the same height, and the\nsame age, and we teamed up, became very good friends and since uh he came with a\ngroup of Dutch Jews that arrived at the camp, and it is a sad experience to tell about the\nDutch Jews. Because Holland was a country where people eat a lot of cheese, a lot of\nbutter, all the rich things, uh, the Dutch Jews were dying like flies. All of a sudden no\nfood at all or very little food, no butter, no cheese, and uh the Dutch Jews within a short,\nthe shortest period of time, there were very few left. I don't, I think we did receive one\ntime a group of two hundred Jews and within a matter of six weeks they were down to\nmaybe fifty or less. I don't know exactly. Because uh, it was much harder on them,\nwhereas the Jew from the East, a Polish Jew family who had always had a hard life,\nwhere lived in a ghetto maybe and who was poor, and didn't have all the rich foods, he\nwas able to resist much better in a concentrate, for a longer period of time. In the end it\nwas all the same. But uh, uh, that was a big difference with a Jew from the West and a\nJew from the East - the survival rate. Uh, a Jew from Poland was toughened up, or a\nRussian Jew or whoever they had from the, the eastern Europe. So in that respect I think,\nuh, there was greater survival rate among the eastern European Jews than the western\nEuropean Jews. But the Dutch Jews were particularly badly hit because of their life style\nthat they had before. So I teamed up with this boy. At the time probably more so than his\nfamily, his father and his brother-in-law were killed in the camp, and I must tell this story\nbecause Mike Swab (ph) was his name, my best friend, Mike, who unfortunately died in\nHolland two years ago of cancer, and we were the best of friends. As a matter of fact\nwe're like brothers. And uh, Mike Swab's father and brother were killed by cold water\nshower. The team was, came back from work one day where there were a lot of Dutch\nJews and they were lined up in the camp street, and they had said that they did not\nperform their job properly. They were sabotaging the German war effort, the Dutch Jews.\nAnd they took all these Jews who were in that particular group that came back from work\nand hosed them down - they call it hosing down. By that they took a fire hose in the\nmiddle of the winter, and this must have been 1942, to 43 the winter, and uh hosed the\npeople the people had to stand at attention and they actually froze to death. This is, this is\na winter not like here but uh a Polish winter you are talking about now. A eastern\nEuropean winter, with snow on the ground, leaving people outside all night and by\nmorning most of them were frozen to death. And that was the end of Mike Swab's father\nand brother-in-law. So from then on, we just became brothers and uh my father was of\ncourse still alive but uh, we then teamed up as a team and, at work, Mike knew German\nquite well, because first of all Dutch and German 1s very close and he picked it up very\nfast; he knew some before. Mike came from a rather large family and all of his family\nwas wiped out. This is another story for after the war. But uh, we could not have been\ncloser because in everything we just ticked, we just, he had the same ideas about how to\nsurvive and our main idea was to be able to escape. And I said here I have somebody\nwho's, maybe my father won't be able to make it. I knew at that time he was getting\nweaker but he was pretty good at that time. So I said if we're going to make it, the young\npeople are going to make it and uh, we then decided, in actual words I think you could\nalmost say we made a pact, that we're going to stick it out together. We talked about it\nand then said we just have to help each other the best way we can. If you find some food,\nyou share it with me. I find some extra food, I share 1t with you and it has to be complete\nhonesty and none, none of this taking away from the cabin. Many times it feels people\ncome like beasts sometimes when they are hungry, and uh, become dehumanized. And\nwe're not become, we're not going to become dehumanized. We're going to remain the\nway we came as much as possible and we're going to get out. Never to leave that idea\nbehind that we're not going to make it. We are going to make it. And uh, that was the\nsinglest biggest thing in my life, I'm sure his life, that uh, that made me so live, plus a lot\nof luck, plus a lot of faith, plus a lot of other things. But I think that the, think the idea\nthat uh, we're going to make it by escaping or some other way, uh, made us stay alive.\nNow, Mike Swab then uh moved fortunately for me and for him I think, that when we\nmove from camp to camp we always stick together. His number, uh that was tattooed on\nhis arm was just a few away from me and which was given to us later, not in the first\ncamps but when we moved to the subcamp of Auschwitz. And uh, we uh, the bond was\neven stronger because I felt also that he had lost his father, on my part at least, he doesn't\nhave a father or brother, he is all by himself, and I still have my father. Although my\nfather did work in a different place, but at nighttime we saw each other in the barracks.\nAnd we were also able to help each other out by uh, for instance in this particular case, I\nhad to hold the measuring equipment for a German which is a, a surveyor of uh,\nuh, on a, a construction site, on a railroad site, you had what these guys they call\nmister ,or , which 1s a supervisor and sometimes, because I spoke\nGerman, he left a piece of bread or something. And then I would take it back and share it\nwith my friend Mike and my father or something. But there was a little help every once in\na while if you were lucky and if you were maybe away from the big group which I was at\ntimes. And uh, when we were transferred to the other camp, with Mike Swab, of course,\nwe teamed up, uh, filling lorries (ph), and they have a name for that, auch ;\nwhich I don't know if there is a name in English, means in working, you fill your lorry\nand then if the others are finished, you can rest up. In other words, you don't have to fill\nanother lorry (ph) because there are two people to each lorry. You throw the dirt in, and\nthen some other place, and you unload it, and you fill holes and so on. Or bunk\ncraters or whatever we did there (mumbled). And uh, uh Mike and I were probably\namong the best team there was, uh, and the reward for being good was not food but it was\nciga - one cigarette a day. These were Russian mahorka (ph) cigarettes which had been\neither captured or gotten from the Soviet Union; they weren't real tobacco, but to the\nsmoker this was better than nothing. And there were people in the camps who would give\ntheir bread away instead of (mumble) rather not eat than smoke a cigarette. And that's\nhow we traded. There was a trade going on among the people who were smokers and\nwho rather would die smoking, not from cancer but from not eating, and would give a\npiece of their bread away just to have a .... TAPE ENDS ... that they, because they were's\nalways the same, whether he was a uh, uh, a bad or good, shouldn't say good guy because\nthere weren't many good guys, most of them were bad, but occasionally there was one\nwho probably had regrets having joined the SS or, and we had one who actually spoke\nYiddish, who apparently had lived with Jews. Some people suspected him maybe partly\nJewish, but we never determined that and he disappeared later on. Maybe he was found\nout, but uh he did speak Yiddish. And uh, uh, it was also question of survival who your\nguard was that particular day. So if you were lucky maybe for many weeks you had the\nright guard. Somebody came along he just hated you for being able to speak German as\nwell as he did. Or maybe better. If he was a guard who came from some territory\nwhich are the uh, uh - I can't think of name right now - ethnic Germans, who\nwere transported back into Germany, came from the Sudanan (ph) land. And some of\nthese people did not speak so well German, so here you have a guard whose German was\nnot so good, but a prisoner, a Jew, spoke better German than he did. And that was of\ncourse cause for taking it out on somebody, and, and that was very frequent, very\nfrequent. But it didn't have to be the language, there were many other things this\nhappened to. Pause. Uh, in the uh, digging up of bombs, uh, we were all so lucky. I'm\nspeaking very frequently about luck because uh, the survival is part the luck, staying\nhealthy and a, a number of other things. But the luck part was that in my team, this again\nI'm talking about teams (mumbled) in someplace you were work as team, a team of five\npeople there were digging up bombs. We had an form (ph) engineer, a Jew who\nknew how to defuse bombs, who learned it apparently in there, and in other teams which\njust had to be somebody in the team of five people to dig up bombs who had to defuse the\nbomb and some of them went off. So our case in a team that dug up the bombs, we had an\nengineer that knew what he was doing and we never had an explosion. So again, luck.\nAnd uh, uh, what can, else can I contribute to, faith. Yes, I'll speak about that now. Uh, I\ncame from a Jewish family which went to the synagogue on holidays, and on Sabbath\nevening, but not orthodox. We had a conservative synagogue in our town, the only one,\nand it was a city of about 800 Jews I believe. Middle class mostly, and uh, uh, I'm getting\noff the subject.",
        "Q: MUMBLED -",
        "A: Thank you. Things I think of I want to say, not about faith, but uh about how I met my\nwife later on. Uh, I married a, I married a non-Jewish woman, a German, but she comes\nfrom a non*Nazi family. I, I, her uncle was the uh, president of the German\nJewish Friendship Society, he was a former German professor, and he was the Senator for\nCultural (ph) Education in West Berlin. Uh and, uh, so I, I knew this when I met her, and\nwanted to marry somebody as a friend of my did, a Jewish boy, a rabbi's son, who\nmarried a woman who comes from a big Nazi family, and the family didn't even want to\nhave anything to do with them. But uh, uh, my wife wanted to become Jewish. I said for\nyou believe whatever you want to believe. That's the way I do. I'm not sure I\nbelieve everything that the Jew does - I believe what I want - that's the way I came out of\nthe camps. And, uh, but my wife said but my children are\neducated as Jews, but according to the law, they are not Jewish and I know that because\ntheir mother has to be Jewish. And to me this means absolutely nothing. My children feel\nas Jews, they're educated, they go to synagogue, some of them, not all. Like all the other\nJewish kids too. But uh, they went to Jewish Sunday School for ten years, every one of\nthem. They are always the top ones in their class, and so I have, don't have a problem\nwith it. To me, conversion means nothing. I have seen so many people being converted\nby militant chap _ that didn't deserve to be converted. Just because, for the in-laws, or ...",
        "Q: You were talking before about how your faith helped you.",
        "A: Right. We're not on yet. We are on. Oh, I didn't know that, I didn't realize that. O.K.\nAnyway, I started talking about my faith. Now, I mentioned that I, uh, we belonged to\nconservative synagogue which was the only one in the town where we lived. And we had\nan outstanding rabbi there. Was quite impressive man. And so I had a good Jewish\neducation. In Germany, in the, in the public school, you also get lessons of religion, and\nso the Jews are, just like here you may have to, but you do it here on a Sunday, or, or you\ndon't do it in a public school, you go outside to your church to get religious lessons. But\nin Germany, it's part of the curriculum that once or twice or three times a week you have\nan hour on Judaism, or Catholicism or whatever. And so uh, I grew up, to make a long\nstory short, to be with a solid Jewish education, a little Hebrew, and, but, I was not,\nneither was my father, very religious. My grandparents were, on one side. And uh, so, my\nfaith, that I want to talk about, I lost towards the end of the war, my faith in God. I say\nhow can there be a God, and I was not thinking about myself, or this was even before my\nfather was killed. Uh, I lost my faith because I say how can God allow that little children\nand women be killed. And uh, I kept this for about a year after the war. And then I felt I\ncame back not because somebody tried to convince me there is a god, all by myself I said\nthere has to be something superior, but I will never call him almighty again, because if he\nwas almighty, he could have prevented that. So I don't believe that God 1s almighty. I do\nbelieve in architect of the universe, call him God, call him what you will, I do believe in\nGod. But, uh, and my children believe in God. Uh, and I, these questions I have talked\nextensively, uh, to my children about and I told them they are free to believe whatever\nthey want to. They grew up with a Jewish education, and the reason, I didn't point this out\nbefore, why I wanted to be Jewish and that was a question that uh, came up with, between\nme and my wife before we got married. I said, look, you are protestant and uh, I'm\nJewish. Now, I am not very strong on Judaism, but the children, we have to decide when\nwe have children, what they will be. So, I said whatever you want them to be 1s alright\nwith me, and she said, I said, I don't feel either way. So I decided the children would be\nJewish with the agreement of my wife, for one reason only. In the memory of my parents,\nbecause my parents had to die because they were Jews, and, in their memory, the children\nare going to be Jewish. If it had to be one way or another, it had to be some reason why\nthey're one way or another. So my wife fully agreed. And my wife, after several years,\nwanted also to become Jewish, and I said this means nothing to me - it's a piece of paper.\nYou'll continue living just the way we do now - it means nothing. And as far as the\nchildren, they can feel, they grew up with ten years of Jewish education and know all\nthere is to know, and they can do whatever they want. And, uh, I give them that freedom,\nbecause I am not myself so strong on, on religion, but I do believe in God and it came\nback to me after the war. Because I really had a hard time for a long time, and while I\nwas in the U.S. Army I had a very deep uh, talk with a Catholic chaplain. And, about\nfaith, and he was the only man that ever admitted to me, the only preacher that said if he\nhad experienced some of the things, we had many evenings together, that he had\nexperienced some of the things that I talked to him about, that he wasn't sure he could\nstill believe in God. And that comes from a Catholic priest in the Army. Anyway, that's, I\nmentioned religion. Uh, if religion is a strong support for people, I recommend religion,\none or another religion, as long as you have some belief in something, in God, or in your\nfellow man. To me, I look at my parents as being godly. They were good people, they\ndied, they had never done anything wrong, and to me that, I see God in them. And I can\nsee God in other people, live people. They are good people. I see God in nature. So I can\nconsider myself as believing in God, although at, for, for a while, for me about two years,\nI didn't believe in God. This was one year after the war. Uh, the belief to survive I talked\nabout. O.K., one was religion or the belief in God. One was luck. Health was of utmost\nimportance. Even if you had enough to eat didn't mean that you were able to survive.\nBecause there were so many diseases. There was typhus in places. Diarrhe",
        "A: The worst enemy that I, that I have seen. Once you had it, you couldn't get rid of it. And,\nfortunately, in some of these camps, and I am getting back to the story later on more\nextensively, you had many Jewish doctors, who weren't allowed to practice medicine.\nThere was no hospital, but who recommended certain ways of keeping yourself fit, even\nwithout, with little food. For instance, in the case of diarrhea, we took wood that was\nburned and ground it up and ate the ashes, uh, the coal actually. The coal, and that is one\nthing that will help you in preventing diarrhea, or if you have diarrhea maybe you can get\nrid of it. So from coal. So there were many very primitive ways that we used, or even\nchewing on a piece of wood. Just to kill the feeling of hunger. So, and, and, and like I\nsaid the doctors were very helpful in those camps, even though they weren't allowed to\npractice, with that advice. And uh, so, uh, disease was the big killer and if you were able\nto survive that you were lucky. Now uh, while I'm thinking of it, my, uh when I escaped\nlater on, my weight, I was uh put on the scale by the U.S. Army and was seventy-five\npounds. I was a walking skeleton, but I was healthy. And that was my luck. Uh, just skin\nand bones, but walking and still fairly strong, and weighed seventy-five American\npounds. And so was my friend Mike Schwab about the same. And we picked it up, about\nfifty pounds in six months, in three months. I'm sorry. But uh, from the smaller camps\nthat I was talking about, we went to a larger camp which was called Blechhammer (ph)\nand this was an actual small concentration camp of about four thousand people. When I\nsay concentration camp I must make the difference between a camp like Auschwitz, and\nthis was a subcamp of Auschwitz. Auschwitz had something like I believe maybe a\nhundred subcamps, some smaller, some bigger, and this one four thousand people. And\nthese subcamps were mainly used not for the destruction of people but for work people to\ndeath. That was the point in those camps. They were used for the German war effort in\nmost cases. In this particular case, Blechhammer (ph) was a camp that was about I think\nmaybe a hundred kilometers from Auschwitz, maybe less, I don't know exactly. And it\nhad the largest German synthetic gas factory, which was several miles long, wide, and\neveryday we went to work in this factory. Now, the, the factory, the gasoline factory was\nbeing bombed once by American long-range bombers. And I must as a side-line state\nsomething. I was very upset for a long time when the question came up in the newspapers\nabout the bombing of Auschwitz, that it couldn't be done. It was too far. Well, we were\njust, I would say within fifty miles of Auschwitz. And we were being bombed by\nAmerican bombers, which was something happy event for us although some prisoners\ngot killed, and in the factory, where we did also mostly construction work. We didn't\nactually participate in the operation of the factory. These were Germans or other\nforeigners. And they had also British prisoner of war camp nearby. Uh, the uh, uh, we\nwere mainly used to clean up from the bombings. We built and built new bunkers where\nthe Germans could hide. Now when the bombers came overhead, there were several\nbombing raids who dropped what they call, uh carpet bombings. That means releasing, a\nhundred planes releasing all the bombs at one time for effect. And they tried to destroy\nthe factory in order to prevent the Germans from having gasoline to continue the war. Uh,\nthe camp was, like I said, a work camp and not a camp with gas chambers. The people,\nand I didn't know this at the time, only when they came to my father which I'm going to\ntalk about in a minute, the people were not destroyed in gas chambers there because that\nwas done at Auschwitz. And we were there for one purpose, to work. We worked to\ndeath. The food was so so but compared to the previous camp it was a little better\nbecause they really needed us very badly there. But there was uh, one meal in the\nmorning and one meal at night. And if you're lucky, there was some soup at lunch time at\nthe place of work. And working hours were usually, and this was true for most of the\ncamps, were anywhere from ten to twelve hours average day. And the facilities for\nhygiene were very poor. I didn't touch on that in the camps, and the common latrines and\nthe people had diarrhea like I mentioned before and uh, and people would catch bugs one\nfrom one another. The water was someplace on, the cold water. And anyway, the\nBlechhammer (ph) camp uh was probably one of the more modern or well-kept camps\nbecause the camp commander and the Jew which was the uh Jewish guy in\ncharge. One of the prisoners was not a copple (ph) which was so bad, but he was also was\na winner of a German medal during the First World War and was somewhat respected by\nthe SS. And he was a learned man and his name was Klemper, Kempor or Kemora (ph)\nwas his name. And because of him I think uh, uh a lot of people, not a lot of people, but\nthe, the lifestyle was somewhat more decent than in other places. Uh, we were not\nbothered too much while we were in the camp. We had to work. Uh, people were\nsometimes beaten to death. It was up to the local SS who guarded us. Or even to some of\nthe German, uh, to the uh fuabata(ph) who were sometimes pretty bad guys who knew\nthat it doesn't matter. You kill one prisoner they got replacement ones pretty quick. Now\nat Blechhammer, it was a replacement, uh, uh, the replacement worked this way. Ifa\nhundred prisoners, or two hundred or three hundred prisoners had died over a period of\ntime, a short period of time, two or three hundred prisoners would come in from\nAuschwitz immediately, which wasn't very far away. So they could work people to death\nand then the bodies, I don't even know what they did with the bodies, whether they were\ntaken to a crematorium in Auschwitz or not or whether they were taken care of locally. I\nreally don't know that. But whenever there were prisoners missing, they just brought a\ncouple hundred more. And this was true also in the last camp. Uh, exactly the same\nmethod of replenishment. Uh, with my father in, this happened in about uh, I don't know\nexactly but uh, November or so of 1944. My father became very weak. Uh, was also like\na skeleton and uh, he was reaching the age of 50. He was going to have, and uh, at that\ntime there was unwritten rule, and I've checked it out after the war, this, there was\nsomeplace there was something in writing, and someplace there was nothing, I don't\nknow the sit was___, but it was an accepted fact that any Jew or any worker, non-\nJewish, who worked in these labor camps, uh, who reached the age of 50 was not good\nenough for the war effort of Germany. Therefore, he was disposed of. Disposal meant gas\nchamber if they have one. In our case Auschwitz was nearby. So what they did ever once\nin a while, they picked up the people. Some people said I can't, I'm weak. Well the SS\npicked them out or they picked out older people. But there was always a group of people\nthat was sent back from Blechhammer to Auschwitz by truck. But whoever reached the\nage of was automatically put in that group, to be disposed of. Well, what they said just for\nfun, they said we sending them to rest and recreation because they worked so hard. They\nneeded to rest. But what it really meant and we knew that not officially but the rumors\nwere they was being sent to Auschwitz to the gas chamber. And that 1s exactly what\nhappened to my father. I came back from work one day. My father wasn't there and didn't\ncome back, and I was, where is my father, trying to find out frantically. Well, he was in a\nspecial enclosure within the camp, a barbed wire enclosure with one barracks where they\nassembled those people. They referred to it as the dispensary but it wasn't a dispensary -\nit was just a gob of people and sent them away in a couple of days or whatever. Well, I\nsaw my father one more time through the barbed wire and it was nothing I could do and\nnothing he could do. And I could only hope for the best, not wanting to be true it is the\ngas chamber at the other end, but it was. And so I know the exact fate of my father. Uh,\nhe was taken from Blechhammer to Auschwitz and gassed and disposed of. And, which\nalso happened to be the fate of my father, of my mother, uh, but in 1942 already. And uh,\nso when I was alone, I still had by friend Mike Swab, which was something great to have,\nto have uh somebody to lean on and he can lean on you. And we decided from then more\nthan ever that the first chance we get we're going to escape. And we worked together, but\nit was almost impossible. The, the concentration camp had very high walls. They were\nmade from concrete slabs, and on top of the wall of this particular camp was electrically\nloaded barbed wire. There was no way to get out. And it was well controlled with guard\ntowers. And being marched to work everyday, which was several miles, there was no\nway to escape either. There were SS with machine pistols and dogs on each side. The\nonly place where it would have been possible to escape was at the work site. If you\nworked in a separate group like I did, I did sometimes. But when I worked in a separate\ngroup, Mike Swab didn't work in a separate group. And our plane, plan was that if we can\nescape it should be in a group. Some of us might be shot in the process of escaping, if it is\nfound out, but some of us might get through. So it always better in a group, then split up\nonce you're outside. O.K. Uh, we had at that time planned if we get away from the\nfactory, but then was, once you get, we had blue/white stripped uniforms, and what, what\ndo you do when you escape. You're in the middle of Germany or some place or Polish\nborder or something. My idea was to get to my German friends, this Catholic family by\nthe name of Sonnon (ph) in Muchenglablak (ph), whose parents were friends of my\nparents, to get to the house and then to survive the war in their cellar. And I am sure they\nwould have done it because they helped my grandparents till they were deported to\nJoasenchat (ph) in 1941. And uh, uh, so Mike Schwab was going to go along with me.\nEither that or we go to Holland. But he wasn't sure where he would go to in Holland. I\nwas sure where I would go to in Germany, so we decided it would be Germany. But then\nthe question was, once you escape, a tattooed number on the arm and uh hair shorn. In\nother words, you looked like a prisoner. And blue/white stripped uniforms that you could\nthrow away if you had other clothes, but you still looked like a prisoner with no hair and\nlooking like a skeleton, you were immediately recognized, so where you going to go. So\neven if you had a chance to escape, and the chances were there frankly, at the place of\nwork, in, in the synthetic gasoline factory. There were many chances. And some people\ndid escape, but they were all caught. And when they were caught, they were brought back\nto camp and hung whether they were dead or not dead. They were hung or put on the\nground for all the prisoners to see. Here's what happened. Some of them were shot and\nthe bodies, the mutilated bodies, sometimes were just put in front of the prisoners before\nuh going to work in the morning so everybody could see it. They were left out all day, all\nnight, you know, so everybody could see what happens to one who escapes. And that was\nstandard procedure - to bring them back to the camp and let all the prisoners see what\nhappens to an escapee. Well, uh, I have one other incident at Blesheimer. Uh, I got hit by\nmachine gun fire. There was when a group was accused of sabotaging the German war\neffort and some people were, in this, this was a common, not very common, but\noccassionally some people were accused of not working hard enough, to sabotage the\nGerman war effort. In other cases, where three people were hung at Blesheimer; they\nwere accused of sabotaging the war effort by cutting telephone lines. But what they had\ndone, they had done clean-up work where bombs had fallen and some of the prisoners\nhad taken some wire, some electric wire and used them as belts on their pants because we\ndidn't have any belts. And they were caught and they were accused of having cut the wire\nand they were hanged publically in front of the group of, the whole camp being\nassembled. In, in my case, our group was accused of not working too hard and made an\nexample, and, and the SS started firing like a mass execution. And one of our plans that\nMike and I had was also which we had learned from other people, the thing to do to get\nout of something, if there is not a planned execution where they just make sure everybody\nis dead, , to drop the moment they start firing, to drop down, and let a body\nfall over you. And then be covered up. And maybe be left for dead. And that is exactly\nwhat I did. But, uh in this particular case, the SS came, apparently they had no intention\nof maybe having a mass execution but just fire into some prisoners because somebody\ngot angry, or was upset about something, not performing enough work that they, uh\nwhatever the reason was which could be many reasons. They just started firing. The\nreason as far as I know was that we didn't perform at work. And so I was hit. Now, my\nluck was I got out of it and that's another long story and I don't think we have time for\nthat to go into that. I got out of this alive by getting up later on, going back to the\nbarracks and being treated by a prisoner doctor. Now there was no place that I could go to\na hospital. I was scrapped (ph) several times, three or four times on my head, and right\nhere, and here, and the hair never grew back and there was a piece of bone missing, but\nluckily I was, I was a pretty good healer and although I did have puss in it I was healed\nby this doctor. And uh with normal thread being used for sewing on buttons uh to fix me\nup and, and like I said there was no hospital or dispensary I could go to. Well, next day I\nhad to go to work. There was no place to rest up or after loss of blood and so on. Uh, and\nI was asked since I was bloody and had a bandage around my head, not regular bandage\nbut some old clothing, what happened. And I said I got hit during the air raid. And many\nprisoners were either killed or hurt pretty badly at Blesheimer during the air raids, the\nbombings of the synthetic gasoline factory. And then prisoners were walked back. Some\ndays they were lucky - they got some bandage from the local German workers. From the\nSS we got nothing. From the local German workers, which were also hit sometimes. So,\nand when you walked down in the morning people would say, hey you, you fit to work.\nYou say yes, I'm fit to work. I looked very strong even though you had lost some blood\nyou would be really weak, but that was always the thing during the selection process that\nwent through several times. So even if you were, don't come walking up there like you\nweak, almost falling over, which was the case in most cases and in my case sometimes\ntoo but I never let anybody see that I was weak and just looked straight and strong when\nyou went through selection line. Well, when I walked out that morning, it wasn't a\nselection line, it was just the guys going out, the guy pointed me out and I said I was hit\nduring the bombardment and he passed me. So that's how I was able to survive that. Uh,\nBlesheimer after my father, did exist and I don't have my exact dates. Till December of\n1944 when the Russians advanced. At that time, uh the uh order was given to evacuate\nthe camps. We could already hear the sound of war by hearing guns, artillery, tanks or\nwhatever, bombings. And the word we got and we were always a little bit in the dark\nsince officially we got no word at all what was going in the outside world, but\noccassionally somebody would get a newspaper which was sometimes in some cases\npunishable by death, depending on how the SS felt. You know, somebody could bring a\npaper back to camp or having a radio which I don't know if anyone had, but uh, we were\nable to find some old newspapers maybe at place of work somebody had thrown away\nand so we were sort of informed. But that was the German side that we were reading. Uh,\nin this particular case, I uh, we heard the guns and the rumor came we going to be\nevacuated. Uh, where to nobody knew. Into Germany. Away from the front. That wasn't\nto do us a favor, to get us away from the firing, but because they needed more labor\ninside Germany. And they had to get it from somewhere. And I think, I'm not sure, that\nAuschwitz was already captured at that time or not. I have no knowledge of that. But they\nwere getting close to Auschwitz too, and Auschwitz I don't think made any death\nmarches. People were just left in there or killed or whatever. But in this particular labor\ncamp that we were in, or subcamp of Auschwitz, we were evacuated. This was the plan I\nassume, and in an orderly manner we were marched every day, all day and in the night\ntime put in a field with lights away from the front towards Germany. And we finally\narrived. When somebody couldn't walk because the food, there was almost no food, days,\nwe went for days without food. Water we got once in a while. And I assume, I don't have\nany specific figure, that we were about four thousand or somewhere close to four\nthousand prisoners that were marched out of the camp. Some people remained behind,\nand there were other people in other camps that I read up after the war, that came to the\ncamp. They had to put them somewhere. People who had been marched into this camp\nfrom other camps when we were out already. They didn't know what do to with them, the\nRussians were advancing too fast, and uh, so I don't have any exact figures. It was very\nconfusing times but I assume about four thousand prisoners were marched out of\nBlesheimer. Fourteen days later, the death march arrived at the camp of Gross Rosen\nwhich was another large, larger concentration camp. And in the group that I was in, we\nwere standing in mud being counted, and I was standing in the front row being able to\nunderstand German, being able to understand the SS was reporting to his superior. He\nwas delivering 276 prisoners. Now, I can't say to this day if that is what was left of four\nthousand. I don't know how many got there. I don't know how many were killed every\nday. But what one of the common things they did was put..... END OF TAPE.....\nbarnes from farmers. Whenever they could they usually put maybe about five hundred\nprisoners to a barn. They would lock them up in the barn. This was for proper control so\nnobody could run away during the night. If they had you out in the open, that meant they\nhave lights on and they couldn't go to sleep. But if they could lock you up in a barn, they\njust have to post two or three guards around and the rest of them could go to sleep. And\nthe prisoners were locked up. Uh, so I don't know how many people were executed in\nbarns because there were a lot of executions going on and everyday, every morning\nbefore mein dof (ph) they said who cannot march any more, and people would say I can,\nI can, but they were just dragging themselves on the ground. They would shoot them by\nthe side of the road. They would just pile them up and fire into the group. The regular\nmass executions. They make sure nobody is left behind. They even went so far to make it\neasy, I don't know what they tried to do, they picked cemeteries to execute people, next to\ncemeteries. Maybe they thought they ought to get buried in a cemetery. I don't know why\nbut it is very odd. But in two cases, I've seen people be executed near cemeteries, next to\ncemeteries. Uh, so from Gross Rosen, the 276 prisoners plus other prisoners that were at\nGross Rosen, were transported in cattle cars to Buchenwald. This was a few days later.\nBuchenwald was of course well inside Germany, was on the western front. Here we're\ncoming from the eastern front to the western front. And we arrived at Buchenwald, we\ndidn't arrive, we arrived near the city of Weimar, which is rather large city, on the track\nleading through the city of Weimar to the other side of, to Buchenwald. And uh we were\nvery unfortunate. The train must have been spotted by air, by airplanes, and I don't know\nwhether they were British or American airplanes, uh, but the train was bombed. The train\nwas stationary at that time, the engine was stopped. But it was just outside the city of\nWeimar before getting to Buchenwald, and when the city was bombed, our car was hit\nand split open. Some people were killed. But neither Michael or I were hit at all, probably\ncovered by others, and we got out of the car, and this was near some German homes.\nNow, we knew we were hungry, we were starved because we hadn't gotten any food from\nthe time we left Gross Rosen in the cattle cars. Uh, we went into a house, it was the\nnearest house where the car was. It was near the railroad tracks and went in the kitchen\nand helped ourselves. The inhabitants of this house were sitting in the cellar, because the\nbombing was still going on. And the clear wasn't given. The moment the all clear was\ngiven we had our parkas full of food and we had eaten quite a bit while we were stuffing\nourselves, or loading up with food. And many prisoners did that. Those that were caught\nwere shot by the SS. We didn't get caught because that was uh, taboo, of course, going\ninto German homes and grabbing food. But again there was no way to escape. At that\ntime it would have been very easy to escape during the bombing. Where to go? Hair\nshorn off, number on the arm, and blue/white stripped uniforms. No place to go. No. And\nit was So easy to escape at that time. Well, I don't know how many survived the, uh, this\nbombing but the rest of us finally arrived at Buchenwald. Being in Buchenwald, we\nthought this was going to be the end now. They're not going to take us anymore.\nApparently they didn't know which way to go, from the east to the west, from the west to\nthe east. The Americans were coming the other way, so, and there were selection\nprocesses at Buchenwald. And I didn't mention the selection processes before, but I went\nthrough several selection processes. Some of them were more formal than others, and\nothers were just when you went to work guys were picked out and you stayed behind.\nYou were not strong enough anymore or you go. But this was a regular selection process,\nwhere to we didn't know at the time. Uh, and again, Mike and I went to the right side,\nlooking strong and fit, and even asked the questions, are you strong and do you speak\nGerman? Yes. Now, O.K. So we had no idea where we were being shipped off to, but we\nwere given shots at that time. I am coming back to that in a minute. What worried me\nlong after the war. Uh, there was apparently typhus, and we had heard of sterilization. In\nmany camps there they had experimented with sterilization and in some cases people\nwere sterilized just for the sake of sterilization and in other placces it was just for\nexperimentation. And I had thought that at Buchenwald before going to the next camp of\nLeigenstein-Zwieberge (ph), that I had maybe been sterilized. I didn't know what\nsterilization involved. It's not just giving somebody a shot, but for a long, for about a year\nafter the war, I never wanted to face the question but I thought maybe I had been\nsterilized. But it turned out that I never was sterilized because we have six children, so I\nwas safe on that point. But for a long time it was on my mind, and the only thing that I\ncould find out that we were given shots against typhus and some other things, which was\nprevalent at the time and they wanted healthy workers, healthy as they could possibly be,\nat least not have a disease that kills everyone in the room. From Buchenwald then we uh,\nfrom Buchenwald we were transported to the camp of Leigenstein- Zwieberge (ph) which\nwas a subcamp of Buchenwald, a forced labor camp. And it was hidden in the Harz\nMountains. But we didn't know at the time that 1t was a secret project of the SS where\nthey were building tunnels into the Harz Mountains. Their was Mauthausen (ph) which 1s\na more famous camp on the other end of the Harz Mountains and we were at the lower\nend of the Harz Mountains, building tunnels to construct the V-2, the flying bomb or like\nwe have seen in the Smithsonian Museum here. Uh, the V-2 was the secret weapon of\nHitler, and the only way they could produce any was underground because of the\nbombing. So they had picked the Harz Mountains to construct a factory underneath. Now\nat the end where we were, there was no factory. The factory was operating up north, but\nwe were constructing the second project, and the job consisted of being marched from\nwork everyday from this camp which was also about four thousand people, and which\nwas a very mixed camp. The Jews were a minority in there. The camp was practically led\nby communist prisoners, German communists, who had been there, the first ones 1n the\ncamp. Another group, there was a replenishment group and they were pretty well\norganized. But the camp was a terrible camp, was a temporary camp. The camp had\nexisted, by the time I got there, only about four months or five months, so it was a brand\nnew camp so it was only going to be there for the purpose of constructing these tunnels.\nUh, the march to the tunnels was very tedious every day, and almost no food. And again\nthe replenishment method was five hundred people from Buchenwald. Uh, each time five\nhundred people were dead, five hundred people, and they were thrown in mass graves.\nThere was no burning of bodies and I worked on one of the mass graves, I was detailed to\nthat for a short while and fortunately only doing one thing, digging the hole. And today\nthere are out of seven thousand prisoners who were totally there, for the normal amount\nof prisoners was four thousand, but there were three additional thousand that came to\nreplenish. So then all of them in mass graves near the camp. There is a site - I never went\nback there although I have a standing invitation from the East German government to\ncome back and be their guest - that they know of me as the only survivor who lives in the\nwestern world. And uh so the camp is still in existence, a national monument, and young\nsoldiers, East German, are being sworn in at the camp. But it 1s one of the worst camps\nthat existed. So the mass graves are there. They have a very nice site. They send me\npictures every year, and the story exists although I do believe that uh, uh, that maybe the\nstory is not complete. It 1s probably worse than if you actually read this. It is not the same\nthing if somebody tells you about it is my opinion. You cannot picture this. You cannot\npicture going hungry. Sometimes I think if you tell someone what hungry is like. But in\nLichtenstein, the work was the killing method of people. By that I mean working in\ntunnels without the proper protection. You had to dig, get the rocks out, haul them on\nlorries out or carry them out. And then the blasting. They never had the prisoners far\nenough away that somebody wouldn't get killed by the dynamite blasting and then they\nwould carry the rocks off. So the German guards, the SS guards always stood far enough\naway so they wouldn't get hit, but they didn't let the prisoners get out far enough to be\nsafe from the blasting, so many people were killed. And those people had to be carried\nback at night and put into the mass graves. You know, thrown in. And I also must\nmention one horrible thing. At the camp at Leichenstein, they buried many people who\nwere alive. People who were too weak, who couldn't get off their knees anymore, to get\nup, to stand up to go to work, and they were put in a pile with the dead people and buried.\nAt one time somebody refused to bury after they were all thrown 1n, a few live people\nwere still moving. He had recognized somebody that he knew and refused to throw earth\non him and the man was shot at the mass grave. That happened to Leichenstein. And uh,\nthere are many stories, too many of them to tell because it was by far the worst camp that\nI existed in, and was the least known camps because it was a secret project. Now, when I\nmentioned it contained a secret project, this I also read up after the war although there\nwas something known about it, something special about this camp. It was like a lot of\nrumors were circulating all the time. It was a common rumor which turned out to be true\nafter I read up on it that the order from the SS was that in case of, there wouldn't be no\nevacuation of the camp in case the Americans come. All prisoners have to be killed, no\nsurvivors. Because it was considered a secret project which they were building a special\nfactory. Now, uh, while we were working in the tunnels, there were German engineers in\nthere. I was able to get to one and ask him what he would do with his torn clothing. Every\nonce in a while he would take something off that was torn or bring it back and even some\nof them would give it to the prisoners because we were always cold. First of all, it was\nfreezing in there. Uh, I'm talking about the beginning of 1945, the mid-winter, when we\nstarted there. And I asked this German engineer if he has any old clothing he could bring\nin that we could wear under our prisoner blue/white stripped uniform and he said yes he\nwould. And I said I have a friend too, and I said he would bring in some warm clothing.\nSo he was one of the good guys. And we were able to pick up this clothing. He left it ina\ncertain place, we picked it up. And the main reason for this clothing was not to be warm.\nThat too, but the main reason was to be able to escape. We figured this is one camp we\nwill never get out of if the war lasts any longer and we had no idea in January or\nFebruary how long the war was going to last. And we say if we did well so far, we are not\ngoing to do well here because no way. And there was killing by working people to death.\nThat was all, and beating to death.",
        "Q: I just want to ask you......",
        "A: Yes, this was one of the camps where Mike was working in another place, but at night\ntime we were together in the barracks. Uh, the specific story that I can tell, there are\nreally too many, but is how we were put in the barracks, just lined up like sardines. There\nwas not enough place to sleep, for everybody to stretch out. There were no double bunks.\nIt was just the plain floor of the barracks I was in. But apparently the camp was created\nfor a lot less people and then there are four thousand people and maybe the camp was\ncreated for a thousand people. I don't know. I would say so. But then the people just\nstretch out on all these barrack floors. And uh, at night time when people would come\nback from work in the dark, there would be no light on. People would fight and actually\nstrangle each other, become like animals, just to get a place to sleep. And we were\nattacked many times, but Mike and I, we always stood together and we defended\nourselves, just for having a place to sleep. It was terrible. People were just like animals\nand there were people who went to the pile up place where there were bodies and thought\nthey could cut out a piece of meat. And they were caught. And some would be severely\npunished for doing that. These peoples were considered inhuman, but they were crazed\nfrom hunger, some of these people. And particularly when somebody was left in the\nbarracks of a couple of days, too weak to go to work, and it would be the end after a few\ndays anyway and people would die. And like I said, they grabbed some of these people\nand buried them alive. They didn't even pile them up anymore outside, just took them\ndirectly to the mass grave. And each mass grave at Leigenberg-Zwieberge (ph) has five\nhundred people and I believe there were six of them. Uh, now, the story in the barracks,\nthis is one of my most vivid memories of all the camps, is that overhead, these were just\none floor barracks, and we sleep on the floor. There were rafters overhead holding the\nroof together, and every morning as we got up there would be people hanging. Every\nmorning, in every barracks. Because people knew they were not going to survive and any\nday, and might as well die now instead of living a few more days, a few more weeks.\nWell, lucky for Mike and me, we didn't feel that way. We figure it's got to be the end.\nWe're going to survive. We have to. And, uh, maybe they're going to evacuate us you\nknow. We also hear that the Allies are coming closer, but we were just .. And we teamed\nwith four other guys at that time who also had the same ideas. They were all about our\nage and they were all making it sort of, like we did, being able to stand up on their own\ntwo legs. And we said, we shall escape together. And they also had gotten civilian clothes\nlike we did from some other place they were working, they were wearing underneath\ntheir blue/white stripped uniforms. And, uh, so we said, well we'll try and escape and\nthen we go in different directions, maybe two one way, two another way, maybe one SS\nguard is firing, maybe he'll hit some of us, maybe he won't hit anybody. But some of us\nwill get out. But we always noticed that if one person would escape they would always\nhit him, by submachine gun fire. Automatic fire. So we had that in mind. We always\nstuck together. And said if it comes to an evacuation we won't be on a death march like\nthe one from the eastern front that we will never survive, because we know what\nhappened there. And we should escape then from the march because that would be\ntowards the end anyway from . Uh, coming back to the people that were hanging\nthemselves. It was our job every morning before going outside for report period, people\nwould be counted - how many are still alive, how many are still there - that we had to\ntake those bodies down from the rafters. And pile them outside the barracks, and then\nanother group would come and pick them up and take them to the mass graves. Uh, my, if\nI, for years, and I still do occasionally, there wasn't a night, and I, like I mentioned, I have\na large family so my family gets my mind off these things and I have a very normal life. I\nhave had after the war, or soon after I get married it was more normal than ever. Uh, for\nyears, when I had dreams it was about escaping, escaping. Because it was always on our\nminds, escaping. Whenever I had a dream, even today when I am sometimes, probably\ntonight I'll have one, I will dream about escaping. It was a standard thing. And that is\nwhat kept me alive. That's what kept Michael Schwab (ph) alive, you know. And, but the\nother dream that is more frequent than any dream about the concentration camp, is about\nthe people hanging themselves. There is nothing more vivid in my mind than seeing those\npeople taking their own lives. It was bad enough, somebody else taking your life, or mass\nexecution, but people just giving up, just plain giving up. And I have had occasions, and I\ndon't do this anymore since I know what my problem is, that I watered the lawn one day\nat my home, and my pants were very wet, and I hung up the pants in the shower, and the\npants were just hanging there, and I got up during the night and that's nothing. When I\nhave a bad dream, and I walked into where the toilet is and I saw these pants hanging and\nimmediately I thought somebody was hanging there. And, uh, like suicides are, is one of\nthe worst memories I have, because so many people committed suicide. Not just by\nrafters. We had people, and my thoughts have been divided on that - whether it was a\ncourageous act or a coward's act, I'm not judging people when they commit suicide. I\nwould never do it. Uh, I would feel, I get through things. And uh, although, given\nthought, yes, I must admit I've given it thought. I think everyone who has been in\nconcentration camp has given thought to suicide. But uh, I have seen a man commit\nsuicide why I thought it was a courageous act. When he stood in front, when we were\nrepairing a railway, and the second line (ph) a speed train came by and he just went in\nfront of the train and he stood there facing it and he got run over by the train. It killed\nhim. And I, you know, there were many other ways. We tried to prevent suicides, but that\nis a Shameful thing in my opinion. On my own part, the only thing I would help\nsomebody that wants to die, let them die if they want to die. That's an old man that I saw\nhad cut his wrists, and I shouted because there was blood spurting from his wrists, and we\nmade a tourniquet, bandaged him up and he was taken back to camp and he was beated\nup savagely and he was killed that night for trying to deprive the German state of labor.\nAnd that was the sentence on this guy. You couldn't even commit suicide - that was\nagainst the law to commit suicide. And that man would have been much better off dying\non the ground where I found him, at work. And uh, so, from then on my idea was about\nsuicide, if somebody wants to do it, let them do it. Now, if it would have been somebody\nclose to me 1t would have been a different story. Like if my friend Mike Schwab would\nhave done it, I would have tried to talk him out of it. But I knew that he, that just a\nmomentary thing, it is not something he believes in. I think a lot of people think about it\nfor a long time before they do it. Or they do it on short notice. They say all of a sudden,\nwhatever. Well, uh, these are some of the incidents, and Lagenstein was probably the\nworst camp and the worst memories I have. Everything goes into the background when I\nthink about Langenstein. And uh, we were also the first time, I didn't mention this, this\nwas also common practice, when you did something you weren't supposed to be doing, or\nthey just wanted to get to you somehow, you got beatings. Officially, not just being hit,\nbut being laid over what they called the bok (ph), which is like a special chair for\nbeatings, and they would lash you. Mike and I both got caught one time, hiding, trying to\nget out of some work, and we got special beating. But we were strong and we were able\nto survive it, although Mike got the worst of it and on your bare rear and I got hit, by\nother prisoners - they had to do this, the SS didn't do this, just counted and stood by - but\nmy guard left for a while because he wanted to get some cigarettes. And so the prisoner\ndidn't beat me as hard as he should have, and he told me to shout real loud, to scream.\nAnd I did, so I didn't get a very hard beating. It was fifty lashes and my friend Mike got\nfifty full, and his posterior was bleeding and pussy for a long, long time. There was\nnothing to treat him with. So this was common place. Not only at Langenstein but in\nother places too. But Lagenstein was the worst. So I am coming to the next and the last\nstory I think. My escape.",
        "Q:",
        "A: O. K. We're off now.",
        "Q:",
        "A: O.K. that gives me, that's good, that gives me a couple of minutes - I wanted to tell that\nfrom beginning to end without..",
        "Q: talk about",
        "A: Well, I didn't want to tell that story. Sucking it out, somebody, the doctor sucking it out\nwith the mouth and then swished his mouth in water, with warm water. We did have\nsome warm water.",
        "Q:",
        "A: Yes, and I'm a good healer. I heal, I get something or I don't develop infection so fast.",
        "Q: Those are the questions that I have.",
        "A: Well, my daughter asked me yesterday, she knows I'm coming over. We have three boys\nand three girls. Uh, why don't you write your story. After this, I divorce myself from all\nthese stories. I can't sleep. Occassionally I did it because my children went to that high\nschool, I talked at the high school. Tell me when we're on. In Falls Church, George\nMason High School in Falls Church. Are we on already?",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: Uh, I have talked. We are on?",
        "Q: I just want to come back to the story of your escape.",
        "A: O.K. We knew the Allies were approaching. And in this case the American Army. That\nwas more or less known. Uh, some people overheard the SS - they were talking the\nAmericans are coming. O.K. What's the next thing. The order was to evacuate the\nprisoners, but noboby knew where. So Mike and I made up our mind, the other four guys,\nwe're going to escape. The first march that we make, the first night or the second or third\nor whenever we can, we're not going to last for fourteen days. But, as they transported us,\nwe went out in groups of five hundred people, and the SS did that for a purpose. I didn't\nknow that at the time. We thought it was for better control. Instead of having a large\ngroup of four thousand prisoners, or three thousand five hundred together in one group, if\nthere is a mass escape, they cannot kill everybody. So they took groups of five hundred\npeople each. And we thought that was for better control. Have the guards around, and\nsome of them with dogs. I think each group had about one or two police dogs, German\nShepherds, and they were pretty vicious. And I didn't even tell any story about the dogs.\nCough. Uh, when we were marched out in groups of five hundred, we thought it was for\ncontrol purpose and the order was to march prisoners at night so the population wouldn't\nsee us, and to sleep them and rest during the day, because the SS had to rest to. But we\nwalked out and we were walking towards the tunnels, and then we were redirected. Now\nthis I found later. I didn't know all this at the time. Because from the publication that the\nEast Germans sent me, what actually happened. The order, and this I found out after the\nwar, I didn't know this at the time, the order was to take the groups of prisoners, in group\nof five hundred, in different tunnels and dynamite the tunnels and bury the prisoners alive\nin there, so there would be no survivors. Because the order was no survivors from that\nparticular secret project. If they shoot them, yes, they could have done it. But easier to\ndrive them to the tunnels, which was just a few miles away, and dynamite the tunnels\nalive. But as it turned out, they were in radio contact with their former observers, or\ntroops, or whatever. Uh, there was American tank column cited coming around the\nmountain. And they were looking for the tunnels. They knew there was something secret\ngoing on because they are trying to find the tunnels by air one time because we were\nthere and there was air alarm, and a torpedo plane and tried to put a torpedo into the\ntunnel. It was not successful. It was all camouflaged. Uh, they redirected us because they\nthought the American tank column was going to cut us off before they get to the tunnels.\nSo we marched back. We marched to camp, and then we marched, to make a\nlong story short, we marched three nights till we actually escaped. And what happened,\nevery night, they parked us, let us rest in a barn, just like in the first march. During the\nday, they took, they requisitioned a barn from a farmer. Since we were only five hundred\npeople and they could put five hundred people in almost any barns, squeeze them in 1f it's\na small barn, and then, bring us out at night. Now, if the farmer was a decent guy, he had\nsome potatoes and food for the prisoners. Even for five hundred because he's feeding\ncows and other animals. So in the first and second night we got some food from the\nfarmer, it was the only thing, and water. In the night time, they put the prisoners, of\ncourse, into these barns and they posted guards outside. The next morning, march again.\nWhoever couldn't march was shot by the SS - the same system like the other. So, again,\nwe were prepared at that time - we were wearing our civilian clothes underneath and we\nsaid we've got to go the first chance we get. So on the third night, we had just, we had\ndecided if we had crossed several small bridges or small streams or rivers, we have to get\nacross the river because, we could all swim, we knew that. And we had decided after\ncrossing a bridge would be the most opportune moment to escape and then go towards, or\nswim across because a dog would pursue you on land. But a dog would not swim across\nthe river unless he 1s trained to do so. But the concentration camps' dogs I don't think\nwere trained to go into water. They were trained to pursue prisoners on land. So we\ndecided that ours, and then he would not, he could not smell, dogs cannot smell across\nwater but they can smell across land, so they can follow you. If they turn the dog loose.\nWell what happened then, on the third night we had just come across a small bridge. We\ndidn't know where we were. We were getting away from the American front, that's all we\nknew. Where to nobody knew. And I don't think, the SS were just trying to get us away\nbecause they didn't know what to do, and I think there must have been a dissention\namong them whether to kill or not to kill the prisoners. And I think one case I heard that a\nSS tried to make contact with the prisoners, that he was a good guy, that they should say\nso in case the Americans come. So maybe some of them were O.K. and some of them\nwere not, and some were just scared and maybe the troop transports on the roads\nand they were particularly following roads. And that's where all the transportation. As we\ncame across a small river there was an air alert, and it was normal procedure, as we were\nwalking in ranks of four, with the SS on the side on a small country road, a body seen\nfrom the air, and by that I mean at night time, signled airplanes who would be the\nobservation plane... TAPE ENDS... and prisoners escaped and this happened and they\ngot shot. When planes were not around, they put the searchlights on and sent the dog after\nthem, or they would shoot the prisoner and they couldn't run so fast, you know, and __.\nSo there were several, there were, a matter of fact, quite a few escapes but everyone of\nthem would get caught, so we thought that the time to escape was near a small river if we\nwere lucky amd we had lucky a plan overhead, just above where we were going to go. So\nwe were lying down and we knew that were going to be no searchlight on and we took\noff. All six of us said go, and we went. And we must have been just a couple of hundred\nyards away from the river and one dog that decided the last moment's enough for us. I got\nbitten by the dog in my leg, and I didn't even feel it. I didn't even know I was bitten. I\nthought, I fell a couple of times, but the dog, you cannot see as well, but the dog went\nafter the other prisoners, and I don't know to this date - I never found out the story - but\nonly Mike and I made it. The others went in different directions, like I said. That was our\nplan, to go in different directions and some of us get through. Either some of these people\nare killed by the dog, but we didn't see anybody and we inquired a little bit about it later\non after our liberation, but they didn't know of any other prisoners that escaped. They\nknew, because we were reported by the SS to the local police, there are two escaped\nprisoners. So I assume that the other four were killed and they found them. But Mike and\nI got to the river, and we swam across, and then we were safe from the SS, from the dog,\nand the first thing we did, we figure if we stay out in the open, we're sunk. They maybe\ncome with a local police dog and sniff us out. And we didn't smell so good and uh, we\nwere full of lice and I mean, even with our civilian clothes on, I had a black jacket on, the\nwhite lice were just running around on the suit. And anybody would have recognized\nsomebody coming from a concentration camp. But anyway, the first thing we did we\nwent to some, there were some farmhouse nearby, and like I said it was at night and I\ndon't remember what time it was but it must have been past midnight, maybe two or three\nin the morning and people would be asleep. So we decided we have to get off the roads,\noff the land where somebody could find us the next morning and hid someplace where it\nis safe, but not out in the open. So we got to a farmhouse and we found a window next to\nthe, where the stable is. Underneath the stable there is, this was a solid build, brick stable.\nAnd underneath the stable they had a cellar, and this was a cellar for the foods for the\nanimals, and also the potatoe cellar. They store hugh amount of potatoes in Germany, and\nwe decided to get in through the cellar hole which was from the outside, not going\nthrough the front. When we lifted it up, I let myself down. We didn't know what we\nwould hit in the dark, whether it would be some water or something. We were scared.\nAnd Michael was holding on to my arms, and I said there must be something below me.\nIt smells like maybe potatoes, I wasn't sure you know. And I guess right, I didn't know. I\nfigured it was potatoes, and then he let me go, and maybe about a couple inches below\nmy feet I hit potatoes. But I was afraid that I wouldn't get out anymore if I let myself drop\nor whatever in the dark, and you don't know what is going on. So anyway, Michael came\nin and then we dug a hole in the potatoes so we figured in the morning somebody might\nopen up the door to the potatoe cellar, we'd be sitting right on top of the potatoes sleeping\nor something. So we dug a hole into the potatoes, covered us up with potatoes, and there\nwas enough air to get in of course, that was no problem, until we knew the next day\nwhere we were and what we could do. So we got out the next day when everything was\nquiet, the next evening when it started getting dark, and we stayed there a full day, and of\ncourse were not found. And then we went into, we got some milk to drink. We went into\nthe stable. We found some milk. I think it was put there for the cats. They had a lot of\ncats. We drank the milk from the cats and we got food that was for the cows, and we took\nand filled out pocket up with potatoes. We ate raw potatoes, that didn't, but we were\nworried about diarrhea, of course. Anything raw. But we got our first real food, and then\nwe went our way. Uh, we decided that to use the same routine, to sleep during the day, in\nbushes, but get away from the villages now, and uh, to go towards the sound of the\nartillery fire that was coming closer and closer. We didn't know which direction. We\ndidn't know which uh way should we get away. Where we would go? Would be another\nvillage in front of us or not. But we wanted to get away from villages, uh, because that's\nwhere most people were and we would be recognized possibly. Uh, what we did then is\nsleep in bushes during the day near some field or someplace and then march at night\ntoward the sound of fire. And that took us seven days. And there 1s another little story but\nI think it is so long, un incidents along the way, but anyway. We came to a village . .",
        "Q: We have plenty of time.",
        "A: We have plenty of time. O.K. We had the most fantastic thing happen. I think you have to\nhave, you have to be lucky. I keep stressing that, not just do some thinking, but also be\nlucky and healthy. On the sixth day or so, it was just a day or two before our actual\nliberation, we were sleeping in bushes. Actually one was supposed to be watching, one\nwas supposed to be sleeping. I was supposed to be sleeping, Mike was supposed to be\nwatching. And, but watching would not have helped very much except somebody's\ncoming and they couldn't run away and then somebody would know. But we could kill\none person. We decided if somebody is getting dangerous and tells us to come along with\nthem or something that we would strangle the person. We knew we could do it. We had\nabsolutely made up our mind that's what we would do. But we were both asleep and\nbeing awakened by jack boots. Now jack boots was what the SS wore, but he was the\nlocal policeman. There must have been only one policeman in that little village. And uh,\nhe said, identification, he said in German. And we said, well we are foreign workers, we\nare from Holland we said. And Michael started talking Dutch a little bit and I spoke\nDutch of course too, and we started mixing our German with a little Dutch. And he said I\nwant to see papers. We don't have any papers. He said where are your papers. I said\nwe've been bombed out. When we came back from the fields from work, we were foreign\nworkers here, the place wasn't there anymore. Everything just what we're wearing to\nwork - that's what we have, no more papers. And he started looking at us and he started\ngoing like this, He saw the lice crawling around. You know, stay away. Then he said,\nmitcom, come with me. I said oh my God, the SS, where to. Well he said, and he seemed\nto be inebriated a little bit. He had just had a couple of drinks, beers probably, you know.\nAnd the war was coming to an end, and things were pretty confusing. And we could\nsmell the alcohol on him, and figured well, this man is maybe not dangerous but we don't\nwant to anywhere. What are we doing to do? He had a pistol in his holster, and I said we\ncan grab it and kill him but then somebody is really going to come looking for us, and\nmaybe we can't get that far away. Everybody be alerted or something. So we figure, we\nnoticed that the man was not decent, but he was scared. And he said at the end, he made a\ncomment to it, well he said I have to take you because there are some escaped prisoners\nin this are",
        "A: And we figured I said are we going to get there. Well, he said if you, if we can identify\nyou, he said you can get some temporary papers because a lot of people have lost their\npapers because of bombings. They came home - no more homes. But I cannot let you go.\nSo I said to Michael, I looked at him and I said, what do we do. I said, kill him? You\nknow, we had a little sign. But we couldn't say anything, you know. We could just look at\neach other and try to understand each other through eye movements, and we could see\nthis guy wasn't really all there. He was, as a matter of fact, he was about, I was going to\nsay an old man. He was my age or older. And, uh, so I said well, let's try it. Maybe we're\nlucky. And, we can't, maybe we're, somebody's going to find out about us here in the\nopen anyway. If he lets us go now maybe then send a search house party for us or let's go.\nSo he took us to city hall. The city hall was just a part-time job for - it was a full time job\nfor the policeman - part-time job for the mayor who was a farmer, and he was burning\npapers. We came in there and he had a stove burning papers. And he said in German, or\ncourse, we couldn't understand everything, he said I pick up some Dutch workers here.\nWhen he said that I felt pretty secure you know. And he said they lost there papers in a\nbombing raid. Uh, can we give them some papers? Ah, he said, ;\nwhat's the use, the war is finished. He said who cares about papers the mayor said you\nknow. And he didn't want to have anything to do with anybody. And he looked at us and\nhe said to us, and the guy, the policeman went in the next room to make a phone call or to\ndo something. I didn't know what he was doing, but he left for a second. He said to us,\nthe mayor, we have some concentration camp escapees in here, so we are being careful\nyou know. He looked at us like he knew we were. And we figured he's not going to do\nanything. So we said, well, the policeman came back in, and he said, get rid of them. I\ndon't want to have anything to do with them. And he said, well, I said, we have to get\nsome, and then we started getting frantic (ph), and said give us some paper please. I said\nthat you know we lost our papers in a bombing. Well I said, I can't give you any paper.\nThere is nothing you can prove, nothing I can prove. So anyway, there was a big\ndiscussion and finally said, well, we're not going to insist because this guy might change\nhis mind. And so he, the mayor said to the policeman, why don't you take them and get\nthem out of this village. Well, he got us out of the place. By the time we got to the next\nguest house, beer house, he smelled beer again, and he said well, you go this way and\nthen you go to next village. Maybe they will give you some paper. And he went into the\nbeer hall. And we were free. I said, Michael, I said, we got out of something that could\nhave turned out bad. The only thing it would have made us is killers. We trying to save\nour lives and it would have gone wrong. So we were lucky again. And somehow it was\nalways a sense that we're going to make it. I mean the sense never left us, Michael and\nmyself. And then, somehow, through luck or through our own thinking, or, or doing\nthings the right way and uh, mostly luck, that we're going to make it. The one thing that\nnever left me is the sense that if anybody's going to make it, I'm going to make it. And\nnever give up hope. And Michael was the same way. And O.K. Now our actual\nliberation. So we went to the next village. And we noticed that this village when we got\ninside, on the outskirts of the village, there were fields that some people had next to their\nfarms. We said we cannot be out in the open fields. There wasn't that much other\nvegetation there. Let's get close to the village where there are some bushes or something\nand sit down or lay down and go to sleep. The Americans got to be here anytime. So, we\nlaid out there, and in the night we heard tanks rolling. And then we heard German voices,\nand we didn't know this, when we got there, they had placed that same evening what they\ncalled faukstorma (ph), which is the German national guard if you call it. They are old\nguys and young fellows. Last minute they put them into uniform and make soldiers out of\nthem. And they had placed these guys with ponce so founst (ph) in little holes in the\nground to be a defense against tanks. And ponce so foust (ph) is a, I'm not sure what, we\ncall it a anti-tank weapon. It's a shoulder held weapon that one man can fire. It's not a gun\nand they can sit in a hole and usually one loads the gun and one fires the gun. And there\nwas one very close to us, and we wanted to, the first thing we wanted to do was when we\nwould hear tanks coming across the field, go towards the tanks, put our arms up. But we\nfigure if we do this we may get shot from behind or something for deserters in the dark or\nwhatever. And we didn't want to get shot by the other side either you know, by the\nAmericans. So as the tanks were coming across in the morning, it must have been about\nfive o'clock in the morning, as it started getting a little light - no it wasn't getting light that\ntime - but they started coming about five o'clock I think - I didn't have a watch - we\ndecided we're going to move on the ground towards them. Well, somebody noticed\nsomething moving in that one hole, and they had in the meantime had holes on the right,\nprobably on both sides of where we were __. But we were far enough away not to be\nseen, maybe uh, hundred and fifty yards from each hole. I don't know, but we must have\nbeen right in the middle. And uh, one guy called over in German, what 1s that patrol (ph)\n- 1s this a patrol, because they didn't know from their own people that - they just thought\nit was a German army patrol. And I said to the guy, hel mut (ph), keep your mouth shut,\nshut up I said, and the guy was quiet you know. And he probably was believing that we\nwere German patrols since he could only see us crawling. And then it takes the tank, one\ncompany of tanks for seventeen tanks, all of a sudden came across the field. And as soon\nas we saw the first tank coming we put up our hands and we were just hoping that they\nwouldn't start firing, because prisoners get shot sometimes too, even if you give up. Well,\nthe lead tank, the guy jumped down, and he spoke German, he was a German-American\nthat they used as an interpreter, and he made all the tanks stop and he brought the officers\nup, the commanding officer, and they radioed back to the battalion that they had some\nguys who were escaped prisoners, and to make a long story short, they used us. In other\nwords, we knew what was in front of them. Which was the right thing to do and we were\nglad to do it. And they said you're prisoners, you look like prisoners. can you prove it?\nWe showed the number on the arm and apparently some of them knew already. They had\ncrossed a concentration camp, another one someplace. This was the Third Armored\nDivision, D Company of the 32nd Armored Regiment of the Third Armored Division.\nOne of Patton's divisions. And uh, so we had a small conference there, and they if we say\nany German army units, or they were particularly interested German 88 anti-tank guns,\nand I said all we know the German ponce de foust (ph), the anti-tank weapon, and they\nare all old or young guys as far as we can determine from their voices but we don't know\nfor sure. We just crawled through. So they got on the tank with the P.",
        "A: system and the guy in this German said there are no German army troops around, there\nare only the army helpers, the national guard or the uh, German folkstrom (ph), young\nguys and old people - that 1t would be silly to fire one shot because the moment the first\nshot is fired, they are going to destroy the village. And they hoisted white flags and they\ngave up and there was not one shot fired. And uh, so, then, it came to us, and we were\ntaken back to battalion headquarters where the battalion surgeon examined us right away.\nWe were then put on scales and uh, it was a small, like a small, not hospital, a batallion\naid station. And they had all the medical equipment to take care of, and that was basically\nour liberation. And then the regimental commander came looking at us, congratulating us\nand then the company commander said if they want to stay with us, the boys they can\nstay with us. Then when they went into the village, they requisitioned a house for the two\nof us, and told the women to make a hot bath for us. That we were going to be bathed by\nmedics, and cleaned up completely, because they have to go on, and we can't go with lice\nwith them on the tanks. That we have to be , and they came with Lysol and\nwhatever you have as a disinfectant, and we were completely taken care of medically.\nAnd examined by a medical doctor or military doctor and found to be healthy, not have\nany communicable diseases. But it actually wasn't exact the first day, we went through a\ncouple of days of check-ups. But in the meantime, we were then, the first thing to do was\nget rid of the lice. And that we did. And our hair shorn off again for last time. And uh,\nthen, we stayed, to make a long story short, we stayed with D Company of this tank\nbattalion for six months. The war was over in another few weeks. And they were taken\nout of combat immediately. After that village, that was their last combat session. And we\nstayed with them, and with an O.K. by the higher ups, that we can stay as long as we\nwant to until we find our families, \u2018til we are certain we are finding anybody family. In\nthe meantime, we are changed from these old prisoner garments to GI uniforms. We were\njust like soldiers without rank of course and we were treated in the mess hall like kings,\nand we had access to the mess hall, not during dinner hours but anytime we wanted to\nwalk in eat. We picked up 50 pounds in three months. Which was really a dangerous\nthing to do because I heard a lot of prisoners overate, and we did too, and killed\nthemselves overeating. And that basically is the story. And uh, so, then to finish up, after\nour escape, my first thought was to find the family, but I didn't know where to start. And\nfirst we had to get back on track, get normal again. So Michael and I stayed and like I\nsaid for six months. And then we were taken back, they were moved back to the area near\nSchofenborg (ph) which is near Frankfurt, into their regular area where they were going\nto settle down. This little town, which called Viny Koomstad (ph) near Frankfurt. And\nthis company was then settled down and we settled down with them. We given a place, a\nplace they requisitioned. So the first thing, we still didn't have any papers, the question of\npapers, what to do about papers. So they inquired with the police and say, they have to go\nto DP camps. When we heard camps, just the name camps, no way we're going to any\ncamps. We didn't know at the time about DP camps. To us DP camps was another, a\nbetter concentration camp. You know, another camp. But it wasn't true of course. But we\njust heard the name camp and we said no. And uh, the batallion commander said the boys\ndon't have to go to any camp if they don't want to. They just go to get papers. So they\ncommander officer sent an officer with us to Frankfurt DP camp. This was right in the\ncity of Frankfurt where there was a compound where all the Jewish refugees moved in.\nAh, not just Jewish refugees, there were other refugees, but they were mostly Jews that\nhad been liberated from camps or were picked up in other places, forced laborers from\nother foreign countries. They were in an enclosure and there was a guard at the gate but\nyou could walk in and out once you had your papers. But people were taken care of\nmedically and furnished papers after they were identified. So he took us 1n there and the\nuh, official said they have to stay here, they can't go back with you because they don't\nhave any papers. It will take maybe, take weeks before we get any confirmation on them.\nAnd we have such a overload here anyway, and the lieutenant looked at us, and he said,\nwell, what you decide boys. And the thing was up to us, not to this guy, official there.\nAnd I said we're not staying. Papers or no papers, we're not going to stay in another\ncamp. And we stay with you. So he took us back and then there was an agreement\nreached that we can stay until we get papers, until we also, even after we get papers, we\ncan stay with them while we decide where our families are, go back to, Michael to\nAmsterdam, Holland, and my case go both to Brussels, Belgium, and Muchenglablak\n(ph), Germany. Because either place our family could have been. But we had decided in\nthe case of my immediate family was in Brussels, Belgium. My parents that we would\nmeet in Brussels, Belgium. Or meet 1n Muchenglablak (ph) with a Catholic family that\nwe know. So I went to both places. Didn't find of course anybody. And I did find some\ndistant cousins and I did make some contact with the Joint Distribution Committee,\nwhich was of course a Jewish organization. And although I didn't find anybody, I stayed\nin Brussels, and uh, was taken care of by the Jewish organization in Brussels, and then\nthe thing I have to get some education and so on, and then I, by that time I was alsmost\n19. No, by the time I came back I was 19 already. Uh, they said that I am too old for an\norphanage, too lot Jewish orphans or kids that were picked up after the war. But the man\nthat ran the Joint Distribution Organization in Brussels was Mr. Munsba (ph) who had\nbeen one of my father's friends in one of the camps, in the French camps of St. Cyprien,\nand he said, well, 18 is the limit for orphanages, but you're past limit, but we'll let you\nhave a little room in here, and you find a job. We'll put you through school. We'll do\nsomething for you. So I got a little room in the orphanage there and I went to school,\nback to school, and tried to learn a trade at the same time. And Michael went back to\nHolland at the same time. He wasn't as lucky as I was. He didn't find, well I didn't find\nanybody. He didn't find anyone from his family. Everybody was killed. And uh, he didn't\nhave the offer to go into an orphanage or anything up there. So he went back to the Third\nArmored Division. They had given him papers, they had given me papers too, to use\nofficial transportation and just like military, like an American military guy, to get back to\nthis place in Germany. We were fully covered. So Michael took advantage of that and uh,\nmake his long story afterward short, he was adopted by an American soldier, non-Jewish\nsoldier, to come to the United States. And he stayed with him until he actually left for the\nUnited States. I remained in Belgium, and I also came to the United States, but I came in\na different way. I came by asking for visa to go to the United States, and I had to wait\nuntil December '47 to get to the United States. I did get to the United States. And the\ndraft was still going on here. I was going to be drafted. In Europe, if you were in\nGermany of course, but Germany didn't have an army, but other countries, like France, or\nBelgium, they were still drafting too after the war for a while. I would have been subject\nto the draft. Well, 1t would have been a bad thing after the concentration camps of course.\nYou know, you want to lead a regular life. But here the United States had nothing to do\nwith me, that my past was in a concentration camp. I would have been subject to the\ndraft. So what I did instead, I volunteered for military service with the agreement they\nhad at this time to get the GI Bill, or to remain and make the military a career. What I was\nafter getting an education from the military. I did exactly that. I came in as an enlisted\nman, I became a sergeant, then became a citizen and when I got my citizenship was able\nto go to Officer's Candidate School and became an officer and make the Army a career\nfor twenty years. And uh, I had by initial boots anyway with the army after my liberation\nand I was very successful. And then I joined the civil service after my military career.\nAnd I was another twenty years in the civil service. But I probably missed the story that\nis very close to my heart that I wanted to mention about my children, about my wife. And\nI married a German woman who's not Jewish, and my children grew up Jewish in\nremembrance of my parents. And nothing else, if I don't feel that strong about religion, I\nwanted them to have something. Everybody should grow up with a religion, and have a\nbelief, believe in something. And the closest thing to me was being Jewish, and closer\nthan that, that my parents had to die because they were Jews, the sole reason, because\nthey were Jews. And uh, I'm going to bring up one more thing here. Uh, about two\nmonths ago, I made a trip to Germany. And I visited my, the old folks are not alive\nanymore, the Christian people that helped my family, that helped my grandparents who\nby the way were deported to Lasenstadt (ph), the ghetto and also perished, including an\n80 year old grandfather. My father, before he died, sat down with me in the camps at\nnight, and tried to recall everybody that was left from the Willner family in Germany.\nAnd that possibly also had the same fate that we had went to the concentration camps.\nUh, he had a very good memory, and he counted out all the people, naming names, and I\nmust have known personally maybe two-thirds of the people that he mentioned. The\nothers were not known to me. But they were all the Willner family - it was a close,\nclosely-knit family who all lived in the Rhineland of Germany, near Cologne-Dusseldorf.\nSo the distances weren't very great, they even weren't spread out over Germany. I think\none lived in Berlin, but the rest of them lived in the Rhineland and had been living there\nfor the past four hundred years. I even have some documentation that I got in Germany,\nwith the Hebrew name of one of my ancestors who first had the name of Willner and he\nhad a Hebrew name of course too. And uh, it was done by a doctoral dissertation by a\nGerman after the war, and he picked the Willners as one of the families that he did his\ndissertation on. And so when I visited recently, uh, I knew this before I went that in\nmonths of August and September, they inviting Jews back to the city as guests of the city\nof Muchenglablak, which have done some other cities in Germany. My name wasn't on\nthe list to be there, but since I was visiting on my own with my friends, I was passed on\nto some city officials to tell me someone visiting early and they made a joke of it. They\ngot their dates wrong. And, uh I didn't get the dates wrong because this was a personal\nvisit | was making to Germany and some other country. And uh, I agreed that I would see\nsome city officials who wanted some advance information on what a person like me who\ncomes back to his former hometown would feel like. They had a lot of apprehension that\nfor instance, one person in '85, an old lady, wrote them a letter and said, what is this good\nfor, why reopen old wounds. Why are you inviting us back here? Well, to make a long\nstory short, out of the people they invited, probably about 90% of the people are coming.\nAs the guests of the city, for one week. Uh, they were very apprehensive, and really\nwanted to know, particularly from one who got the worst. In other words, they are\ninviting people back who escaped Germany. They are Holocaust survivors, but they were\neither in United States, in Great Britain, in uh Australia or some other place. But they\ndidn't know how many had been in a concentration camp. Since I had been in\nconcentration camp and uh, also probably am one of the youngest, if not the youngest, I\nwas told, in the group that was coming back. They wanted to know how I would feel\nabout this, how I would feel about collective guilt, which by the way, I don't believe in\ncollective guilt. There are also good Germans just as well as there are bad Germans, and I\nam sorry to say that I've seen people in this country ... END OF TAPE but then he said\nI'm very hesitant to do this, but I see that you are interested in this, that you're into what\nhappened to your family, that you went in search of your family after the war. I have a\nbook that recently came out that the German government put out that has about 150,000\nnames, 125 or 150 thousand I don't remember exactly of German Jews that perished.\nConclusion of Interview.\n"

        "A: I was born on the 15th of August, 1926 in Munchglablak, Germany, which is West\nGermany near Cologne-Dusseldorf, a town of about 150,000 people.",
        "A: O.K. When the Kristallnacht happened in Germany, my father decided at that time that\nhis son has to get out of Germany if he cannot get out of Germany and my father was one\nof those Germans who believed because he served the German Army in World War I,\nthat they would not touch him since he was decorated and in the beginning they did make\nexceptions but later on it was all the same. When he decided it wouldn't, it would be the\nsame like everybody else, he wanted to get me out of Germany so he sent me, they put\nme on a train to Brussels, Belgium where I was picked up in Brussels by a Jewish refugee\norganization which placed me with a Dutch family. And when I lived with this Dutch\nJewish family, uh, I was of course sent to school and I was told that I could not have the\nname Helmwood in Belgium it was too German and the Germans were still hated from\nWorld War I so they gave me the name Eddie and I, the name I kept since today, until\ntoday.",
        "A: Yes, I remember saying goodbye to them. When the papers came that I could, was\nallowed to leave Germany from the police, my father, uh, uh, had almost what I felt, we\nfelt was a heart attack, but it wasn't - he was just over excited and uh he almost passed\nout and it was quite a thing for him and for my mother of course too to get me out of\nGermany, to know me on the safe uh side, and uh, it was, it was for me as a boy, it wasn't\nas shocking as, because I was too young, it was almost like going, being sent to an uncle\nor aunt in a faraway place, but uh, I, the only thing I was worried about was leaving my\nparents behind. Because I knew at that time already what this was all about.",
        "A: No, I think the uh, uh, the uh, uh, laws at that time were you couldn't take any shoes,\nextras, I could take my clothing along. No, I, I do have a kidoscop, a silver kidoscop, that\nI took along and that was about all. It was wrapped up in uh my clothing.",
        "A: I still have that. And it was saved by non-Jewish people.",
        "A: Yes. Uh, which, uh, when Hitler came to power in 1933, uh, Germany wanted to rearm,\nof course, and, uh, the military, uh, were, uh, in vogue again and uniforms and uh medals\nwere being worn because Hitler wanted a new army, a big army, and as a result, by Field\nMarshall Von Hindenberg, which was the President of Germany, Hitler was the\nChancellor, of course, they created the Iron, the Cross of Honor which was given, as I\nunderstand, to people like my, my father who had earned uh, the Iron Cross during World\nWar I and who had served for four years on the front lines. In other words, if he had\nserved probably in the rear he probably wouldn't get it. But it was given uh to a lot of\npeople just because Hitler wanted to make it popular again that the army is great and\nmedals are great and so on and to uh. So, my father was uh, was given by the authorities a\ncertificate with a medal which I still have to this day which was saved by a German\nCatholic family that he gave it to that had also served with my father in World War I.\nAnd uh the certificate uh I, reads basically uh - in the name of the Fuhrer and Reich\nChancellor, which was Hitler, of course, given in my father's name, and uh, in uh, it gives\nthe law that was passed to give this to people and I think 1t was a mistake to give it\nprobably to the Jews but some of them slipped through. I don't know if everybody got it\nbut I, I understand there are other people got it and uh, it says the Cross of Honor for\nfront line combatants, and the date on it is, the, the name of the city, Muchenglabach\n(ph), is mentioned on there, the 7th December, 1934. And uh by order of the police\npresident and uh, it is of course the swastika on it can be seen and the stamp that is on\nthere and the city seal and the certificate 1, W 1 F.",
        "A: Yes, I do have the medal with me too. This is the Iron Cross and this 1s the Cross of\nHonor which were, which was worn even on the uniform and sometimes in a smaller, in a\nsmall version of it on civilian clothing.",
        "A: Well, my father had a, you cannot call it a wallet, but it is a leather folder and I happened\nto know the story of this. He kept his war pictures in here. And, uh, the pictures, uh and\nsome other pictures were given, and plus these medals were stuck in, he had given to this\nfamily and they gave it back to me. The leather wallet here, it is very heavy leather, and\nis, the story is that it was from a saddle, ah, ah, it was shot from underneath my father\nduring the war uh, and, uh, the saddle was riddled by bullets so it couldn't be used\nanymore and he got a new saddle, and so from the old saddle, he locally he had a little\nwallet made to put his war pictures in here. And, uh, uh, and it says on there Russia 1915\nnear Smorngorn, so apparently that's where this happened, the incident, and that's all I\nknow about that. Except that my father didn't get hurt at all. The horse was dead but, and\nthe saddle was uh bullet ridden and uh but my father didn't get hurt.",
        "A: Their name was Leek, L - E - E- K. And the lady was named, by name of Wanda Carr.\nAnd they were both Jewish and had two children which were already uh grown-ups and I\nlived them as their little brother and until the war started in 1940.",
        "A: No. No. There was no problem.",
        "A: My daily routine was only going to school to learn what languages and eventually I also\nhad to go and see a rabbi to be bar mitzvah, which I never was, and uh because the war\nstarted in meantime. The family was not very religious but uh they did insist that I take\nlessons to be Bar Mitzvah. Uh, an additional thing uh which I should not forget is that my\nparents about six months later also arrived in Belgium but without papers. They had, they\nwere able to get across the border with some guide because we were very near the border\nmy father knew a lot of people and some Christian friends helped him to get across the\nborder.",
        "A: Yes, my parents came to Belgium in 19, uh 39, probably the middle of '39, and uh, they\ndid not have any money had to leave everything behind, they just had to walk across the\nborder. And uh, they were in a refugee status in Belgium and uh, they were furnished a\nlittle room which was not big enough for me to live with them, but it was agreed by them\nthat I would remain with the Dutch family where I was very happy uh and it was a rather\nlarge family, and, but I was able to see my parents on weekends. And during the week\ntoo. And, uh, till of course the war came and that's another story.",
        "A: O.K., O.K. Uh, my father was considered a political refugee from Germany. Now\npolitical refugees from Germany were not just Jews but they were communists,\ndemocrats, anybody who had fled Germany because of Hitler. And when the war started,\nthe Belgiums and the French, uh, arrested everybody that was German, men first, uh,\nmostly men, in some cases some women, but my mother and I did not get arrested\nbecause we were German. My father was arrested because he was a German and they\nknew that he was Jewish, but these were the laws and they arrested everybody that was\nGerman, and put them in internment camps - not concentration camps but internment\ncamps in southern France - St. Cyprien, Gurs, Rivesaltes and there were several others.\nNow at the time my father was arrested, by the police of course, Belgium police, we only\nknew that all these men were being transported to France because the German advance\ncame very fast and they had to put them somewhere. At that time we decided, my mother\nand I decided, or rather my mother decided, that we should go and look for my father. We\nknew southern France, we had some names, but we weren't sure. So we tried to get across\nthe border ahead of the German Army into France. At the border, Belgian, at the Belgian-\nFrance, uh French border, uh we were arrested for being Germans. They looked at our ID\ncards, Belgian ID card, which were for foreigners, and it said of course nationality\nGerman. We were arrested by the police at the border, trying to cross, and were put in\nprison. Uh, my mother was put in the women's section, and I, for the first time in my life,\nwas in a prison cell, and that was one of the worse experience, experiences up to that\ndate, of my life, because I was in solitary so to say, I was all by myself in a cell, for\nalmost a week. And the Germans bombed the city. I can't recall the city right now but it\nwas at the border, it was a small town, Vavik (ph) was the name of the city, Vavik (ph).\nAnd, uh, the women's section was served by nuns and I got to see my mother only once\nwhen she was being walked in the courtyard. After a week, or about a week, we were all\nassembled in the courtyard, all, more, more, I would think, there were mostly Jews from\nGermany and put on a train under heavy guard and sent to southern France to the\n, which 1s rather large camp which later on became more\nfamous because they put uh the Jews from Baden (Ballon) (ph) in there and other people.\nIt was originally a camp that was created by the French to put the remnants of the French,\nof the uh Spanish uh army who were fighting Franco in there when they fled to France\nthey were put in there. But most of them they were gone by the time we came there.\nThere were a few of them left who had not been resettled. And we were put in the\n, which in the Pyrenees, in the southern part of France. Uh, then\nthe war was over pretty quick which we all know, and uh, where to go. There were\nreleases everyday people got released. If you had papers to go to some foreign country,\nthe French were glad to get rid of the people. The food was terrible there and people\nwere, there were no killings, mass killings or anything like that but uh people died from\nhunger. If you didn't have any packages coming in from the outside there was a good\nchance you would die from hunger there. And there is a very large cemetery which I\nvisited after the war, and uh, I assume that most people are buried there. There were no\ncrematoriums, uh crematoriums, and uh, so, uh the camp itself was very, very bad. It was\nmuddy, it was filthy, it was uh full of fleas, uh uh and it was just a makeshift camp. And\nuh so then the time came for some people to leave to be released, and uh uh, as we know\nit was the unoccupied zone of France, and uh but the Germans did have some control\nbecause Germans did come there with the French, the Vichy police, or Vichy government\nofficials, uh and uh, made sure that uh certain people are kept in there, but by that I mean\nprobably German communists who were so-called enemies of the German state. Now\nwhen it came to the women and children, like my mother and myself, uh they say can you\ngo anyplace. And we decided we would look for my father and it was also at that time\ndetermined that my father as in the which is on the\nMediterranean coast. I failed to mention that the first camp 1s toward the Atlantic coast,\none in the Pyrennnes and one is the Bas-Pyrennes of France, so we said we had\na destination finally; we said we wanted to join my father. We didn't know whether or not\nhe was going to be released but he was there.",
        "A: I am talking about 1940, late. Uh, we traveled to this place, we found my father, and uh,\nthrough again some help of the French, but at the time we were all speaking French pretty\nwell, uh, we uh, went to a little town called Auchtafa (ph) in the Pyrenees, near in, uh\nvery close to the Spanish border, near Pier-pinon (ph) which 1s the place and\nthe people were very helpful, the French in this particular, very small village in the\nmountains and uh who were uh had a lot of vineyards and that was their business mostly\nup there. And the French priest who was in a nearby parish had a house in this little place\nnear the church, and he made his house available to some Jewish refugees and there were\nabout three families living in this house. So my mother and I got refuge there, then we\nwent to visit my father and there were visiting hours I think twice a week. We went to see\nmy father and, uh, this went on for a couple of weeks or months, and uh, during one of\nthe visits, we didn't go into the camp - there was sort of visiting enclosure with barbed\nwire, and we could sit and chat for an hour or so, and during one of the visits when the\nvisit was over, and they said all visitors leave, the uh French policeman who was in\ncharge of the group there, Vichy policeman, told me where, that I wasn't going to leave,\nand uh, I say well I came in, uh, I am already resettled. All he said I am not considered a\nchild anymore, I am a man. I was fourteen at the time, and uh, I was kept in, just like that.\nThey say you stay with your father here, you're you're not a child, you're a man. So all of\na sudden my status changed, I was not able to go back and stay with my father. Uh - I\nwas, uh, among a group of men, I was the youngest one among a group of mostly\nGerman Jews or also some, one German communist I remember and one German\nnobleman who had fought the Nazis who had, was fleeing from the Nazis and got caught\nthere. And he was later delivered, uh turned over too to the Nazis when they came\n. Well, anyway, he, uh I was in another camp in and then\na year later the rumors came, in 1941, 1942 I guess, uh this was still the end of 1941, the\nrumor came that all the Jews are going to be transferred to camps, work camps in\nGermany, and uh the French of course wanted to get rid of us and the Germans needed\nlabor. Uh, in part some of the people were shipped to labor camps in France. This was not\na labor camp, this, this was just, St. Cyprien was just an internment camp, there was no\nwork being done there, it was uh on sand, on a sandy beach actually on the\nMediterranean. And uh, but people, people were being continually shipped out in groups\nand to labor camps throughout southern France. Well, then the word came that's not\ncompletely true, some people are also being shipped out to Germany, to concentration\ncamps. At that time we were very well aware of concentration camps and concentration\ncontrary to what some people think that some people say well we didn't know there were\nsuch concentration camps, I already knew it as a child before I went to Belgium, because\npeople used to make jokes about Hitler and say well keep your mouth shut otherwise you\nwill go to concentration camp and on the Kristallnacht, and that is a story I missed by the\nway, uh, when Jews were arrested in Germany, uh, my father left our home to look after\nhis father and was not arrested, and it was just a coincidence and uh, his brother was\narrested and his, uh my mother's brother was arrested and sent to Dachau Concentration\nCamp. Well, uh the uh place my father went to was about twenty miles from where we\nlived and his father lived in the country in a home all by himself but his younger, my\nfather's younger brother lived with him, and he was married to a non-Jew. And uh which\nis also an interesting story but I am getting off the subject there a little bit. She was\noffered to get a divorce from him because her brothers were in the Nazi party. And she\nrefused. She say, she said will stay with him in the bad days, she will stay with him in the\ngood days. And, but he was still living there, but his wife had taken refuge someplace\nwhen he was arrested and when my father came to his father's home, in\n, which is near Muchenglablak (ph), excuse me, they were\ndemolishing the house inside. And there were Nazi storm troopers up there. As my father\nwalked in and see what was going on, the storm troopers were from another city\napparently, not from the same town, there was a common thing that they brought in\npeople from outside, there there were no - but the Chief of Police was present, a small\npolice force, and it so happened that the Chief of Police had been sitting in uh grammar\nschool on the same bench with my father. And he recognized my father right away. He\nsaid, Ziechfred (ph), what, what are you doing here? Was I looking after my father. He\nsaid, uh, well you're not supposed to be here. But he said nobody told me and uh so he\ntook him to the police station. He said I can't do but arrest you. I have to uh, anybody\nwho shows up has to be arrested, so I have to take you police station to your status.\nBREAK police chiefs and let him see his brother in jail who was later on transported to\nDachau and uh so knowing that my father had the Iron Cross and he had it too, my father\nalways wore it in miniature uh form on his uh suit, particularly during the Nazi era,\nbecause he wanted to show that he was as good a citizen as anybody else, he did his duty\nfor his country and so on and so. Uh, and he said, well he said we have to do something\nfor you. I, I don't see where a front-line combatant should should be in jail the guy said.\nSo he called the local police in Muchenglablak and they ordered that my father be sent\nback, but they didn't specify that he be sent back under escort or without escort, so this\npoliceman took it on his own to send, to put my father on the bus and say when you get\nback to your hometown, you report to the police. He didn't send another policeman with\nhim. My father never did. And therefore escaped arrest and was not arrested during\nKristallnacht or the day after.",
        "A: I don't remember seeing synagogue burning but I remember the synagogue the day or two\ndays after, after 1t was burned, because uh we had to uh, uh, move out of German schools\ninto a Jewish school. Uh, and the last school I attended, the Jewish school, was right in\nthe, in the same building as the synagogue was. So we weren't able to go to school\nanymore. As a matter of fact I received a certificate from my teacher, uh Jewish teacher,\nonly Jews were taught by Jews, and it said in there this letter 1s instead of certificate\nbecause the certificate was destroyed by fire, which was the fire in the synagogue, and\nuh, this man by the way is still living in New York, my old head teacher from the Jewish\nschool and he is 87 years old today and I'm still in touch with him. And he saved his life\nby being hidden by two Christian families in the same town, Muchenglablak. He survived\nthe war in Much.. and came to New York after the war. He had no children. Extremely\nunusual, extremely unusual. But I uh believe, I am not sure, that he, the people that hid\nhim were fellow teachers. And the women dyed their hair blonde, to survive the war.",
        "A: The synagogue was totally destroyed. Uh, there was an incident - the city, uh the Jewish\ncommunity was apparently well liked and the anti-Semitism was not as bad as it might\nhave been in some other German cities. And uh the police was sort of decent and didn't,\nof course the Nazis weren't and the storm troopers weren't and the SS weren't, uh, but the\npolice were sort of decent because they respected the community. But there were some\nbad ones too, but in general, the police saw to it that not too people were bodily harmed.",
        "A: Yes, the rabbi's house was, the, the, he lived in an apartment house. The furniture was\nthrown out through the window and we went by there on the way to school. And there\nwas a piano on, on the sidewalk, smashed and other things, many other things. I\nremember that. And there were other homes which I didn't see of course where they\nthrew things out into the street. And the stores of course. Since we had one main street\nthere where there were a lot of stores, that was also street very close to our school and we\nwalked through there many times and all the Jewish stores had their windows smashed.",
        "A: My father was uh, as a representative for a silk tie factory in Krayfeld (ph) and uh, which\nis another town which 1s a silk capital, was the silk capital of Germany, and he worked as\na representative for, for this company. That was his occupation.",
        "A: Not his own business, no.",
        "A: .... NO way, and uh to continue the story about that particular camp, -,\nwhen these rumors I started talking about came that people are transported to Germany,\nor to Poland maybe to labor camps, uh, my father felt we had to get out and the fact that\nuh we both spoke French pretty well there were occasionally French gendarmes - these\nwere our guards who were at the uh the camp was surrounded by barbed wire and when\nthese people did guard duty, some of them were sympathetic and every once in a while\nsomebody would throw me a piece of bread. They came, there was one particular French\ngendarme who uh, whenever he was on duty I, he had something for me. He threw it over\nthe fence, and I asked him one day if he heard that people are being transported. He says\nyes, if you can get out, get out. When he said if you can get out, get out, I thought he is\ninsinuating to me that with him I have a chance to get out through the barbed wire under\nthe fence when he 1s on guard duty, and that is exactly what happened. Both my father\nand I escaped when this man was on duty - he turned around, he walked away like he\ndidn't see it, this was at night. And we went to the village where my mother lived, and uh\nwith the O.K. of the priest and with the O.K. of the mayor, who happened to be a\ncommunist, of that city, the mayor and the Catholic priest worked hand in hand, an\nunusual team, but at the time they thought they were fighting the Germans and I don't\nknow but I suspect that the mayor was a member of the . He was\nvery anti-German and he tried to help. And by helping I mean that we had shelter from\nthe priest. And he issued a phoney ID card. This was a real ID card but the number of the\nID card was not registered at City Hall, and he took a big chance. Nothing happened to\nhim that I know, but we were arrested later on based on that ID card, when Vichy police\ncame under the guide of the Nazis, they raided places, they were looking for people, and I\nmean, also in addition they picked whoever else they could, particularly Jews. And\nduring one of those checks, and we, I don't know to this date whether we were turned in\nby somebody, or the mayor was turned in by somebody or the priest was turned in by\nsomebody. Uh, they also , | know that. But somebody must have told\nsomething, must have spoke something, either was unhappy about us or unhappy about\nthe mayor or whatever was going on there. And uh so one day during a raid, we were all\narrested and then we were shipped off and they compared the uh, uh IDs with what\nrecords were at City Hall and they found out they were phoney ID cards. And that is how\nwe got caught. From there on we were sent in by train to Drancy, which is the big camp\nnear Paris which was a collection camp for Jews from all over France. And uh after the\nwar I found out what transport number I was in. Of course I didn't know at that time,\nnobody was telling anything. We stayed several days in Drancy, (cough) excuse me, and\nnot knowing what our destination was and this was my father, mother and myself, plus\nthe other Jewish families who were arrested in that little town in the south of France, uh,\nit was on 12th September, uh, 1942, that our transport was put together and these\ntransport usually a thousand people, uh cattle cars, going out of Drancy, near Paris, to the\neast. There were rumors where we were going, but not rumors that we were going to be\ngassed or anything rumors of labor camps and so on. Uh, the transport that I mentioned\nand the date I found that after war because uh there is a book which was made uh, uh,\npublished with the help of the French government and I think the Krazfelds (ph) had the\nhand in it and I have the book and in this book is my name, my parents, name,\nnationality, date of births, and the people that I was with on our transport, and from then I\nfound after the war that our transport was transport number 31 out of Drancy, and I\nunderstand there total of 75,000 people involved in transports out of Paris, out of Drancy,\nand, like I say, we were transport number 31 and that transport left on the 12th of\nSeptember, 1942 for Germany.",
        "A: Excuse me. The cattle cars were packed with people. There was very little food, what\npeople had on them, and the only thing that I can remember that were given during the\ntrip, on the trip towards Auschwitz, which I didn't know at the time but I found out later,\nuh, was water. We were guarded by uh Germans and in some places where we stopped-\nthey had to get also food, we were given some water and uh, were able to empty buckets\nwe used as toilets. But there was hardly space for everyone to lie down. Some people had\nto sit up all night, people were packed in like sardines, several people died, some people\ncommitted suicide. In my particular car, a lady doctor gave birth to her own baby. And\nthe child of course didn't survive; I don't know if she did. Uh. There was a most unusual\nevent in my cattle car. Uh, being from Germany, my father was able to read through the\ncracks of the wood some of the station names that we went through, so we definitely\nknew that we were going to upper Salezia, which is now Poland, and which is near\nBreslau, what used to be the German city of Breslau, and where most of the concentration\ncamps that we found out after the war were located, including Auschwitz, and a lot of the\nsubcamps. Uh, the cars were opened at stations every once in a while and people were\nbeaten up mercilessly and outside of that, people were starving. Uh, people didn't have\nany food, didn't bring anything along. Some people stuffed their pockets full of\nsomething and they ate it, but I don't remember ever having been given any food except\nthat we were given water and in some cases people weren't even given water. So that a lot\nof people arrived dead or starved or whatever. Uh, on the way to Auschwitz, and again, I\ndidn't know the destination at that time, at one station in, uh, I can't recall the name right\nnow, in upper Salezia, a small station, the doors were opened, and they said all men out.\nThat was the order. All men, working men that were able to work, out. Uh, like I said,\nthis was not arrival at Auschwitz or any other camp, but it was just a small station, and\nuh, at that time I had to make a decision. In the meantime I was going on 16, and I was\npretty strong because I had worked that summer in the French vineyards to make some\nmoney. And it was hard work so I had pretty strong muscles and uh it wasn't just that but\nuh uh the decision I had to make whether I was a child staying with the women or men. I\nwanted to stay with my father. And I came out and we didn't know at that time what it\nmeant. Work meant able to survive. To live. And, but we didn't know what it meant for\nmy mother and from that transport number 31, according to the, this book from the\nFrench government, of, of the thousand people or so, I think there are six survivors. They\ndetermined after the war. So all the women and children went straight into the gas\nchamber. At that point I searched for my mother after the war, and I wound up with the\nGerman Red Cross, or International Red Cross, at and they had a listing saying\nthat all the women and children went straight into the gas chamber, of that transport. So I\nassume that my mother was gassed right away on arrival at Auschwitz which was\nsometimes in September 1942. Uh, the decision I made to stay with my father was my\nlucky decision, and again, uh, maybe there was at the time a feeling if you worked, you\ncan survive. And we didn't know, we thought maybe the women are also going to be put\nto work in factories or whatever. But I didn't know the gas chamber would be at the other\nend. Uh, again, I didn't know about my mother until after the war, and I searched for my\nmother in Brussels, Belgium, and in Muchenglablak, and various other places but I didn't\nfind her, until I was determined that she actually did perish. Uh, my father and I were sent\nfrom that place in trucks to a small camp which was a subcamp of Auschwitz and in\nthose days these small subcamps were called\n, which means forced labor camp of the Chief of\nthe German Police and the Vice Furhur of the SS which was Himmler of course. They\nhad large names but they were small concentration camps in other words, under the\ncontrol of the SS. Not always guarded by SS but sometimes by storm troopers, sometimes\nby soldiers, or helpers from the east which were in some case Ukrainians, or Polish guys,\nand frankly from my experience, I preferred the German soldiers who were guarded to\nsome of the other people who tried to prove they were better than the Germans and didn't\nlike the Jews and were very uh sadistic sometimes. I'm not saying that the Germans or the\nNazis were not sadistic but the uh first experience we have from these guards were the\nhorrible experience and uh I always felt that I was maybe more German than they were.\nThey called, so-called people who lived in the territories. They were sometimes Polish,\nsometimes German, in upper Salezia, and at that time they had opted to be German and\nsome of the people didn't speak German that well. Their Polish was a lot better. And uh,\nthe uh, experience we had, the initial experience was not very good. Of course, the initial\nexperience was the roughest experience under the circumstances.",
        "A: O.K. Prior to going to a larger camp, we were in two smaller camps and each camp was, I\ndon't remember exactly the, I would say less than a thousand people. I think in one case it\nwas six hundred and the other one may have been a thousand. One was the camp of Lazy\n-L-A-Z-Y, which was mainly for the construction or reconstruction of bombed-out\nrailways. And we went out everyday to the, uh, we be marched under guard, to the sites\nwhere the railways had been bombed by the Russians I suppose. In those days I don't\nthink the Americans were coming out that far. And they bombed two transports,\nwhatever, and also building new railways, which was the hardest work because people\nwere not strong and the food was very limited and uh, uh, the people were beaten to death\non the job or in the camp. And the system was at that time whenever they needed more\nlabor, new people were coming and being fed into the camp. Supposed they had in the\ncamp of a thousand people, they had a hundred people who died during a week or two on\nthe job. Well, they got a hundred more from a transport or from Auschwitz or wherever\nthey got them from to be sent in to fill up the void. And uh, so we were also digging up\nunexploded bombs which, and, and this I did twice during my concentration camp career,\nuh, which was very dangerous of course and the German guard would stay pretty far\naway in case something exploded. And some people did get killed that way. Uh, but, uh,\nrailroad work was probably among the hardest work that we ever did because people\nwere not strong enough to lift up the rails, and uh, some people got crushed under the\nrails, and people fell down. Our clothing was uh, uh, limited. In the wintertime we had\nclogs on, we had shoes with wooden soles, blue/white stripped uniforms. In the beginning\nwe had our own with the Star of David on it. Later on we got the blue/white-striped\nuniforms. Uh, but it was very, we weren't properly dressed, we didn't have the proper\nfood, and people were just uh walking skeletons in a lot of cases. And a lot of people\ncommitted suicide. This was the most, the most vivid recalling I can do about the camps,\nis not people being killed but people committing suicide. Particularly in one camp that I\nam coming to later on which was the last camp. Uh, but nobody thought they were going\nto survive. Uh, the first camp, uh, was like I said most railroad and then later on we were\nsent to another camp and I don't know if the first camp was done away with, but the\nwhole camp was transferred. We went to another camp and uh, when we worked on\nconstruction of bunkers and buildings for the Batta (ph) Shoe Factory which I assume\nwas producing shoes for the German army because I don't think we were used for any\nnon-military projects. They were all always in support of the military. So we worked near\nthe Batta (ph) Shoe Factory. Uh and I was lucky in, I guess, in, in general I was lucky\nthat I was able to speak German. I had an advantage over the other Jews who were\ncoming from Poland, who didn't speak German unless they spoke Yiddish, and uh,\nYiddish to some unfortunately, to some of the Germans, to the SS was like waving a red,\nuh, red drape or something in front of because that showed he's Jewish. And if you're able\nto speak German, correct German, you got sometimes less beatings, or you were also able\non the job to execute an order right away. You understand the order was given\nimmediately. And that was very important. Some people picked it up pretty fast. Some of\nthe other people, if they came from France, I'm not just saying uh Polish Jews, but the\nJews from other countries, and in the first camps we were all Jews which changed later\non through mix. Uh, and uh, if you were able to speak German and follow orders you got\nless beatings, you were able to do it right away, and if you had a team, uh, sometimes we\nhad to work in teams uh loading lorries (ph) and we were two people or four people as a\nteam and all of them spoke German. We tried to team up that way or working that way\nbecause it always worked better than shouting one, two, three or something like that in\nGerman. And the Germans, being very militaristic, and frankly there is something I\nforgot. I was grew up that way, to be almost like a, like a Prussian. My father was very\ngreat disciplinarian and uh, when he said go, I went, and when uh he said jump, I jumped,\nand so on and so on. It wasn't like our kids are today. And, but it helped me later on,\nbeing able to jump when the Nazis said to jump, you know, and to do things and\nunderstanding what they meant and doing it sort of a little bit of a military way. Uh,\nwhich I understand from uh, from other people that I swapped stories with after the war,\nit is true in many cases. If, if you knew the German language it definitely helped. And in\nsome case, uh, uh, when we were building bunkers you had to read the diagram, how to,\ninto uh concrete, solid concrete you have to put uh wiring and uh wiring has to be wired\nup a certain way that the designs, if it is rounded and so on, and it has to be tight with uh,\nwith uh the wire, the smaller wire, and if you're able to read the diagram from German,\nyour job was much easier. You didn't make any mistakes. And so on, so that helped.\nAnyway, the camps, the second camp I went to, I made by first great friend for life, uh\nalthough I still did have my father with me, but a youngster of my age was a Dutch Jew\nand I also forgot to mention since I lived with a Dutch Jewish family in Brussels,\nBelgium, I also picked up Dutch, which was spoken at home, but Dutch and Flemish is\nalmost the same. And so I was very fluent in Dutch by that time, and I picked, uh, or he\npicked me, I picked him, uh, uh, a young man my age whose father and brother-in-law\nwas also in the same camp. So we teamed up. We were about the same height, and the\nsame age, and we teamed up, became very good friends and since uh he came with a\ngroup of Dutch Jews that arrived at the camp, and it is a sad experience to tell about the\nDutch Jews. Because Holland was a country where people eat a lot of cheese, a lot of\nbutter, all the rich things, uh, the Dutch Jews were dying like flies. All of a sudden no\nfood at all or very little food, no butter, no cheese, and uh the Dutch Jews within a short,\nthe shortest period of time, there were very few left. I don't, I think we did receive one\ntime a group of two hundred Jews and within a matter of six weeks they were down to\nmaybe fifty or less. I don't know exactly. Because uh, it was much harder on them,\nwhereas the Jew from the East, a Polish Jew family who had always had a hard life,\nwhere lived in a ghetto maybe and who was poor, and didn't have all the rich foods, he\nwas able to resist much better in a concentrate, for a longer period of time. In the end it\nwas all the same. But uh, uh, that was a big difference with a Jew from the West and a\nJew from the East - the survival rate. Uh, a Jew from Poland was toughened up, or a\nRussian Jew or whoever they had from the, the eastern Europe. So in that respect I think,\nuh, there was greater survival rate among the eastern European Jews than the western\nEuropean Jews. But the Dutch Jews were particularly badly hit because of their life style\nthat they had before. So I teamed up with this boy. At the time probably more so than his\nfamily, his father and his brother-in-law were killed in the camp, and I must tell this story\nbecause Mike Swab (ph) was his name, my best friend, Mike, who unfortunately died in\nHolland two years ago of cancer, and we were the best of friends. As a matter of fact\nwe're like brothers. And uh, Mike Swab's father and brother were killed by cold water\nshower. The team was, came back from work one day where there were a lot of Dutch\nJews and they were lined up in the camp street, and they had said that they did not\nperform their job properly. They were sabotaging the German war effort, the Dutch Jews.\nAnd they took all these Jews who were in that particular group that came back from work\nand hosed them down - they call it hosing down. By that they took a fire hose in the\nmiddle of the winter, and this must have been 1942, to 43 the winter, and uh hosed the\npeople the people had to stand at attention and they actually froze to death. This is, this is\na winter not like here but uh a Polish winter you are talking about now. A eastern\nEuropean winter, with snow on the ground, leaving people outside all night and by\nmorning most of them were frozen to death. And that was the end of Mike Swab's father\nand brother-in-law. So from then on, we just became brothers and uh my father was of\ncourse still alive but uh, we then teamed up as a team and, at work, Mike knew German\nquite well, because first of all Dutch and German 1s very close and he picked it up very\nfast; he knew some before. Mike came from a rather large family and all of his family\nwas wiped out. This is another story for after the war. But uh, we could not have been\ncloser because in everything we just ticked, we just, he had the same ideas about how to\nsurvive and our main idea was to be able to escape. And I said here I have somebody\nwho's, maybe my father won't be able to make it. I knew at that time he was getting\nweaker but he was pretty good at that time. So I said if we're going to make it, the young\npeople are going to make it and uh, we then decided, in actual words I think you could\nalmost say we made a pact, that we're going to stick it out together. We talked about it\nand then said we just have to help each other the best way we can. If you find some food,\nyou share it with me. I find some extra food, I share 1t with you and it has to be complete\nhonesty and none, none of this taking away from the cabin. Many times it feels people\ncome like beasts sometimes when they are hungry, and uh, become dehumanized. And\nwe're not become, we're not going to become dehumanized. We're going to remain the\nway we came as much as possible and we're going to get out. Never to leave that idea\nbehind that we're not going to make it. We are going to make it. And uh, that was the\nsinglest biggest thing in my life, I'm sure his life, that uh, that made me so live, plus a lot\nof luck, plus a lot of faith, plus a lot of other things. But I think that the, think the idea\nthat uh, we're going to make it by escaping or some other way, uh, made us stay alive.\nNow, Mike Swab then uh moved fortunately for me and for him I think, that when we\nmove from camp to camp we always stick together. His number, uh that was tattooed on\nhis arm was just a few away from me and which was given to us later, not in the first\ncamps but when we moved to the subcamp of Auschwitz. And uh, we uh, the bond was\neven stronger because I felt also that he had lost his father, on my part at least, he doesn't\nhave a father or brother, he is all by himself, and I still have my father. Although my\nfather did work in a different place, but at nighttime we saw each other in the barracks.\nAnd we were also able to help each other out by uh, for instance in this particular case, I\nhad to hold the measuring equipment for a German which is a, a surveyor of uh,\nuh, on a, a construction site, on a railroad site, you had what these guys they call\nmister ,or , which 1s a supervisor and sometimes, because I spoke\nGerman, he left a piece of bread or something. And then I would take it back and share it\nwith my friend Mike and my father or something. But there was a little help every once in\na while if you were lucky and if you were maybe away from the big group which I was at\ntimes. And uh, when we were transferred to the other camp, with Mike Swab, of course,\nwe teamed up, uh, filling lorries (ph), and they have a name for that, auch ;\nwhich I don't know if there is a name in English, means in working, you fill your lorry\nand then if the others are finished, you can rest up. In other words, you don't have to fill\nanother lorry (ph) because there are two people to each lorry. You throw the dirt in, and\nthen some other place, and you unload it, and you fill holes and so on. Or bunk\ncraters or whatever we did there (mumbled). And uh, uh Mike and I were probably\namong the best team there was, uh, and the reward for being good was not food but it was\nciga - one cigarette a day. These were Russian mahorka (ph) cigarettes which had been\neither captured or gotten from the Soviet Union; they weren't real tobacco, but to the\nsmoker this was better than nothing. And there were people in the camps who would give\ntheir bread away instead of (mumble) rather not eat than smoke a cigarette. And that's\nhow we traded. There was a trade going on among the people who were smokers and\nwho rather would die smoking, not from cancer but from not eating, and would give a\npiece of their bread away just to have a .... TAPE ENDS ... that they, because they were's\nalways the same, whether he was a uh, uh, a bad or good, shouldn't say good guy because\nthere weren't many good guys, most of them were bad, but occasionally there was one\nwho probably had regrets having joined the SS or, and we had one who actually spoke\nYiddish, who apparently had lived with Jews. Some people suspected him maybe partly\nJewish, but we never determined that and he disappeared later on. Maybe he was found\nout, but uh he did speak Yiddish. And uh, uh, it was also question of survival who your\nguard was that particular day. So if you were lucky maybe for many weeks you had the\nright guard. Somebody came along he just hated you for being able to speak German as\nwell as he did. Or maybe better. If he was a guard who came from some territory\nwhich are the uh, uh - I can't think of name right now - ethnic Germans, who\nwere transported back into Germany, came from the Sudanan (ph) land. And some of\nthese people did not speak so well German, so here you have a guard whose German was\nnot so good, but a prisoner, a Jew, spoke better German than he did. And that was of\ncourse cause for taking it out on somebody, and, and that was very frequent, very\nfrequent. But it didn't have to be the language, there were many other things this\nhappened to. Pause. Uh, in the uh, digging up of bombs, uh, we were all so lucky. I'm\nspeaking very frequently about luck because uh, the survival is part the luck, staying\nhealthy and a, a number of other things. But the luck part was that in my team, this again\nI'm talking about teams (mumbled) in someplace you were work as team, a team of five\npeople there were digging up bombs. We had an form (ph) engineer, a Jew who\nknew how to defuse bombs, who learned it apparently in there, and in other teams which\njust had to be somebody in the team of five people to dig up bombs who had to defuse the\nbomb and some of them went off. So our case in a team that dug up the bombs, we had an\nengineer that knew what he was doing and we never had an explosion. So again, luck.\nAnd uh, uh, what can, else can I contribute to, faith. Yes, I'll speak about that now. Uh, I\ncame from a Jewish family which went to the synagogue on holidays, and on Sabbath\nevening, but not orthodox. We had a conservative synagogue in our town, the only one,\nand it was a city of about 800 Jews I believe. Middle class mostly, and uh, uh, I'm getting\noff the subject.",
        "A: Thank you. Things I think of I want to say, not about faith, but uh about how I met my\nwife later on. Uh, I married a, I married a non-Jewish woman, a German, but she comes\nfrom a non*Nazi family. I, I, her uncle was the uh, president of the German\nJewish Friendship Society, he was a former German professor, and he was the Senator for\nCultural (ph) Education in West Berlin. Uh and, uh, so I, I knew this when I met her, and\nwanted to marry somebody as a friend of my did, a Jewish boy, a rabbi's son, who\nmarried a woman who comes from a big Nazi family, and the family didn't even want to\nhave anything to do with them. But uh, uh, my wife wanted to become Jewish. I said for\nyou believe whatever you want to believe. That's the way I do. I'm not sure I\nbelieve everything that the Jew does - I believe what I want - that's the way I came out of\nthe camps. And, uh, but my wife said but my children are\neducated as Jews, but according to the law, they are not Jewish and I know that because\ntheir mother has to be Jewish. And to me this means absolutely nothing. My children feel\nas Jews, they're educated, they go to synagogue, some of them, not all. Like all the other\nJewish kids too. But uh, they went to Jewish Sunday School for ten years, every one of\nthem. They are always the top ones in their class, and so I have, don't have a problem\nwith it. To me, conversion means nothing. I have seen so many people being converted\nby militant chap _ that didn't deserve to be converted. Just because, for the in-laws, or ...",
        "A: Right. We're not on yet. We are on. Oh, I didn't know that, I didn't realize that. O.K.\nAnyway, I started talking about my faith. Now, I mentioned that I, uh, we belonged to\nconservative synagogue which was the only one in the town where we lived. And we had\nan outstanding rabbi there. Was quite impressive man. And so I had a good Jewish\neducation. In Germany, in the, in the public school, you also get lessons of religion, and\nso the Jews are, just like here you may have to, but you do it here on a Sunday, or, or you\ndon't do it in a public school, you go outside to your church to get religious lessons. But\nin Germany, it's part of the curriculum that once or twice or three times a week you have\nan hour on Judaism, or Catholicism or whatever. And so uh, I grew up, to make a long\nstory short, to be with a solid Jewish education, a little Hebrew, and, but, I was not,\nneither was my father, very religious. My grandparents were, on one side. And uh, so, my\nfaith, that I want to talk about, I lost towards the end of the war, my faith in God. I say\nhow can there be a God, and I was not thinking about myself, or this was even before my\nfather was killed. Uh, I lost my faith because I say how can God allow that little children\nand women be killed. And uh, I kept this for about a year after the war. And then I felt I\ncame back not because somebody tried to convince me there is a god, all by myself I said\nthere has to be something superior, but I will never call him almighty again, because if he\nwas almighty, he could have prevented that. So I don't believe that God 1s almighty. I do\nbelieve in architect of the universe, call him God, call him what you will, I do believe in\nGod. But, uh, and my children believe in God. Uh, and I, these questions I have talked\nextensively, uh, to my children about and I told them they are free to believe whatever\nthey want to. They grew up with a Jewish education, and the reason, I didn't point this out\nbefore, why I wanted to be Jewish and that was a question that uh, came up with, between\nme and my wife before we got married. I said, look, you are protestant and uh, I'm\nJewish. Now, I am not very strong on Judaism, but the children, we have to decide when\nwe have children, what they will be. So, I said whatever you want them to be 1s alright\nwith me, and she said, I said, I don't feel either way. So I decided the children would be\nJewish with the agreement of my wife, for one reason only. In the memory of my parents,\nbecause my parents had to die because they were Jews, and, in their memory, the children\nare going to be Jewish. If it had to be one way or another, it had to be some reason why\nthey're one way or another. So my wife fully agreed. And my wife, after several years,\nwanted also to become Jewish, and I said this means nothing to me - it's a piece of paper.\nYou'll continue living just the way we do now - it means nothing. And as far as the\nchildren, they can feel, they grew up with ten years of Jewish education and know all\nthere is to know, and they can do whatever they want. And, uh, I give them that freedom,\nbecause I am not myself so strong on, on religion, but I do believe in God and it came\nback to me after the war. Because I really had a hard time for a long time, and while I\nwas in the U.S. Army I had a very deep uh, talk with a Catholic chaplain. And, about\nfaith, and he was the only man that ever admitted to me, the only preacher that said if he\nhad experienced some of the things, we had many evenings together, that he had\nexperienced some of the things that I talked to him about, that he wasn't sure he could\nstill believe in God. And that comes from a Catholic priest in the Army. Anyway, that's, I\nmentioned religion. Uh, if religion is a strong support for people, I recommend religion,\none or another religion, as long as you have some belief in something, in God, or in your\nfellow man. To me, I look at my parents as being godly. They were good people, they\ndied, they had never done anything wrong, and to me that, I see God in them. And I can\nsee God in other people, live people. They are good people. I see God in nature. So I can\nconsider myself as believing in God, although at, for, for a while, for me about two years,\nI didn't believe in God. This was one year after the war. Uh, the belief to survive I talked\nabout. O.K., one was religion or the belief in God. One was luck. Health was of utmost\nimportance. Even if you had enough to eat didn't mean that you were able to survive.\nBecause there were so many diseases. There was typhus in places. Diarrhe",
        "A: The worst enemy that I, that I have seen. Once you had it, you couldn't get rid of it. And,\nfortunately, in some of these camps, and I am getting back to the story later on more\nextensively, you had many Jewish doctors, who weren't allowed to practice medicine.\nThere was no hospital, but who recommended certain ways of keeping yourself fit, even\nwithout, with little food. For instance, in the case of diarrhea, we took wood that was\nburned and ground it up and ate the ashes, uh, the coal actually. The coal, and that is one\nthing that will help you in preventing diarrhea, or if you have diarrhea maybe you can get\nrid of it. So from coal. So there were many very primitive ways that we used, or even\nchewing on a piece of wood. Just to kill the feeling of hunger. So, and, and, and like I\nsaid the doctors were very helpful in those camps, even though they weren't allowed to\npractice, with that advice. And uh, so, uh, disease was the big killer and if you were able\nto survive that you were lucky. Now uh, while I'm thinking of it, my, uh when I escaped\nlater on, my weight, I was uh put on the scale by the U.S. Army and was seventy-five\npounds. I was a walking skeleton, but I was healthy. And that was my luck. Uh, just skin\nand bones, but walking and still fairly strong, and weighed seventy-five American\npounds. And so was my friend Mike Schwab about the same. And we picked it up, about\nfifty pounds in six months, in three months. I'm sorry. But uh, from the smaller camps\nthat I was talking about, we went to a larger camp which was called Blechhammer (ph)\nand this was an actual small concentration camp of about four thousand people. When I\nsay concentration camp I must make the difference between a camp like Auschwitz, and\nthis was a subcamp of Auschwitz. Auschwitz had something like I believe maybe a\nhundred subcamps, some smaller, some bigger, and this one four thousand people. And\nthese subcamps were mainly used not for the destruction of people but for work people to\ndeath. That was the point in those camps. They were used for the German war effort in\nmost cases. In this particular case, Blechhammer (ph) was a camp that was about I think\nmaybe a hundred kilometers from Auschwitz, maybe less, I don't know exactly. And it\nhad the largest German synthetic gas factory, which was several miles long, wide, and\neveryday we went to work in this factory. Now, the, the factory, the gasoline factory was\nbeing bombed once by American long-range bombers. And I must as a side-line state\nsomething. I was very upset for a long time when the question came up in the newspapers\nabout the bombing of Auschwitz, that it couldn't be done. It was too far. Well, we were\njust, I would say within fifty miles of Auschwitz. And we were being bombed by\nAmerican bombers, which was something happy event for us although some prisoners\ngot killed, and in the factory, where we did also mostly construction work. We didn't\nactually participate in the operation of the factory. These were Germans or other\nforeigners. And they had also British prisoner of war camp nearby. Uh, the uh, uh, we\nwere mainly used to clean up from the bombings. We built and built new bunkers where\nthe Germans could hide. Now when the bombers came overhead, there were several\nbombing raids who dropped what they call, uh carpet bombings. That means releasing, a\nhundred planes releasing all the bombs at one time for effect. And they tried to destroy\nthe factory in order to prevent the Germans from having gasoline to continue the war. Uh,\nthe camp was, like I said, a work camp and not a camp with gas chambers. The people,\nand I didn't know this at the time, only when they came to my father which I'm going to\ntalk about in a minute, the people were not destroyed in gas chambers there because that\nwas done at Auschwitz. And we were there for one purpose, to work. We worked to\ndeath. The food was so so but compared to the previous camp it was a little better\nbecause they really needed us very badly there. But there was uh, one meal in the\nmorning and one meal at night. And if you're lucky, there was some soup at lunch time at\nthe place of work. And working hours were usually, and this was true for most of the\ncamps, were anywhere from ten to twelve hours average day. And the facilities for\nhygiene were very poor. I didn't touch on that in the camps, and the common latrines and\nthe people had diarrhea like I mentioned before and uh, and people would catch bugs one\nfrom one another. The water was someplace on, the cold water. And anyway, the\nBlechhammer (ph) camp uh was probably one of the more modern or well-kept camps\nbecause the camp commander and the Jew which was the uh Jewish guy in\ncharge. One of the prisoners was not a copple (ph) which was so bad, but he was also was\na winner of a German medal during the First World War and was somewhat respected by\nthe SS. And he was a learned man and his name was Klemper, Kempor or Kemora (ph)\nwas his name. And because of him I think uh, uh a lot of people, not a lot of people, but\nthe, the lifestyle was somewhat more decent than in other places. Uh, we were not\nbothered too much while we were in the camp. We had to work. Uh, people were\nsometimes beaten to death. It was up to the local SS who guarded us. Or even to some of\nthe German, uh, to the uh fuabata(ph) who were sometimes pretty bad guys who knew\nthat it doesn't matter. You kill one prisoner they got replacement ones pretty quick. Now\nat Blechhammer, it was a replacement, uh, uh, the replacement worked this way. Ifa\nhundred prisoners, or two hundred or three hundred prisoners had died over a period of\ntime, a short period of time, two or three hundred prisoners would come in from\nAuschwitz immediately, which wasn't very far away. So they could work people to death\nand then the bodies, I don't even know what they did with the bodies, whether they were\ntaken to a crematorium in Auschwitz or not or whether they were taken care of locally. I\nreally don't know that. But whenever there were prisoners missing, they just brought a\ncouple hundred more. And this was true also in the last camp. Uh, exactly the same\nmethod of replenishment. Uh, with my father in, this happened in about uh, I don't know\nexactly but uh, November or so of 1944. My father became very weak. Uh, was also like\na skeleton and uh, he was reaching the age of 50. He was going to have, and uh, at that\ntime there was unwritten rule, and I've checked it out after the war, this, there was\nsomeplace there was something in writing, and someplace there was nothing, I don't\nknow the sit was___, but it was an accepted fact that any Jew or any worker, non-\nJewish, who worked in these labor camps, uh, who reached the age of 50 was not good\nenough for the war effort of Germany. Therefore, he was disposed of. Disposal meant gas\nchamber if they have one. In our case Auschwitz was nearby. So what they did ever once\nin a while, they picked up the people. Some people said I can't, I'm weak. Well the SS\npicked them out or they picked out older people. But there was always a group of people\nthat was sent back from Blechhammer to Auschwitz by truck. But whoever reached the\nage of was automatically put in that group, to be disposed of. Well, what they said just for\nfun, they said we sending them to rest and recreation because they worked so hard. They\nneeded to rest. But what it really meant and we knew that not officially but the rumors\nwere they was being sent to Auschwitz to the gas chamber. And that 1s exactly what\nhappened to my father. I came back from work one day. My father wasn't there and didn't\ncome back, and I was, where is my father, trying to find out frantically. Well, he was in a\nspecial enclosure within the camp, a barbed wire enclosure with one barracks where they\nassembled those people. They referred to it as the dispensary but it wasn't a dispensary -\nit was just a gob of people and sent them away in a couple of days or whatever. Well, I\nsaw my father one more time through the barbed wire and it was nothing I could do and\nnothing he could do. And I could only hope for the best, not wanting to be true it is the\ngas chamber at the other end, but it was. And so I know the exact fate of my father. Uh,\nhe was taken from Blechhammer to Auschwitz and gassed and disposed of. And, which\nalso happened to be the fate of my father, of my mother, uh, but in 1942 already. And uh,\nso when I was alone, I still had by friend Mike Swab, which was something great to have,\nto have uh somebody to lean on and he can lean on you. And we decided from then more\nthan ever that the first chance we get we're going to escape. And we worked together, but\nit was almost impossible. The, the concentration camp had very high walls. They were\nmade from concrete slabs, and on top of the wall of this particular camp was electrically\nloaded barbed wire. There was no way to get out. And it was well controlled with guard\ntowers. And being marched to work everyday, which was several miles, there was no\nway to escape either. There were SS with machine pistols and dogs on each side. The\nonly place where it would have been possible to escape was at the work site. If you\nworked in a separate group like I did, I did sometimes. But when I worked in a separate\ngroup, Mike Swab didn't work in a separate group. And our plane, plan was that if we can\nescape it should be in a group. Some of us might be shot in the process of escaping, if it is\nfound out, but some of us might get through. So it always better in a group, then split up\nonce you're outside. O.K. Uh, we had at that time planned if we get away from the\nfactory, but then was, once you get, we had blue/white stripped uniforms, and what, what\ndo you do when you escape. You're in the middle of Germany or some place or Polish\nborder or something. My idea was to get to my German friends, this Catholic family by\nthe name of Sonnon (ph) in Muchenglablak (ph), whose parents were friends of my\nparents, to get to the house and then to survive the war in their cellar. And I am sure they\nwould have done it because they helped my grandparents till they were deported to\nJoasenchat (ph) in 1941. And uh, uh, so Mike Schwab was going to go along with me.\nEither that or we go to Holland. But he wasn't sure where he would go to in Holland. I\nwas sure where I would go to in Germany, so we decided it would be Germany. But then\nthe question was, once you escape, a tattooed number on the arm and uh hair shorn. In\nother words, you looked like a prisoner. And blue/white stripped uniforms that you could\nthrow away if you had other clothes, but you still looked like a prisoner with no hair and\nlooking like a skeleton, you were immediately recognized, so where you going to go. So\neven if you had a chance to escape, and the chances were there frankly, at the place of\nwork, in, in the synthetic gasoline factory. There were many chances. And some people\ndid escape, but they were all caught. And when they were caught, they were brought back\nto camp and hung whether they were dead or not dead. They were hung or put on the\nground for all the prisoners to see. Here's what happened. Some of them were shot and\nthe bodies, the mutilated bodies, sometimes were just put in front of the prisoners before\nuh going to work in the morning so everybody could see it. They were left out all day, all\nnight, you know, so everybody could see what happens to one who escapes. And that was\nstandard procedure - to bring them back to the camp and let all the prisoners see what\nhappens to an escapee. Well, uh, I have one other incident at Blesheimer. Uh, I got hit by\nmachine gun fire. There was when a group was accused of sabotaging the German war\neffort and some people were, in this, this was a common, not very common, but\noccassionally some people were accused of not working hard enough, to sabotage the\nGerman war effort. In other cases, where three people were hung at Blesheimer; they\nwere accused of sabotaging the war effort by cutting telephone lines. But what they had\ndone, they had done clean-up work where bombs had fallen and some of the prisoners\nhad taken some wire, some electric wire and used them as belts on their pants because we\ndidn't have any belts. And they were caught and they were accused of having cut the wire\nand they were hanged publically in front of the group of, the whole camp being\nassembled. In, in my case, our group was accused of not working too hard and made an\nexample, and, and the SS started firing like a mass execution. And one of our plans that\nMike and I had was also which we had learned from other people, the thing to do to get\nout of something, if there is not a planned execution where they just make sure everybody\nis dead, , to drop the moment they start firing, to drop down, and let a body\nfall over you. And then be covered up. And maybe be left for dead. And that is exactly\nwhat I did. But, uh in this particular case, the SS came, apparently they had no intention\nof maybe having a mass execution but just fire into some prisoners because somebody\ngot angry, or was upset about something, not performing enough work that they, uh\nwhatever the reason was which could be many reasons. They just started firing. The\nreason as far as I know was that we didn't perform at work. And so I was hit. Now, my\nluck was I got out of it and that's another long story and I don't think we have time for\nthat to go into that. I got out of this alive by getting up later on, going back to the\nbarracks and being treated by a prisoner doctor. Now there was no place that I could go to\na hospital. I was scrapped (ph) several times, three or four times on my head, and right\nhere, and here, and the hair never grew back and there was a piece of bone missing, but\nluckily I was, I was a pretty good healer and although I did have puss in it I was healed\nby this doctor. And uh with normal thread being used for sewing on buttons uh to fix me\nup and, and like I said there was no hospital or dispensary I could go to. Well, next day I\nhad to go to work. There was no place to rest up or after loss of blood and so on. Uh, and\nI was asked since I was bloody and had a bandage around my head, not regular bandage\nbut some old clothing, what happened. And I said I got hit during the air raid. And many\nprisoners were either killed or hurt pretty badly at Blesheimer during the air raids, the\nbombings of the synthetic gasoline factory. And then prisoners were walked back. Some\ndays they were lucky - they got some bandage from the local German workers. From the\nSS we got nothing. From the local German workers, which were also hit sometimes. So,\nand when you walked down in the morning people would say, hey you, you fit to work.\nYou say yes, I'm fit to work. I looked very strong even though you had lost some blood\nyou would be really weak, but that was always the thing during the selection process that\nwent through several times. So even if you were, don't come walking up there like you\nweak, almost falling over, which was the case in most cases and in my case sometimes\ntoo but I never let anybody see that I was weak and just looked straight and strong when\nyou went through selection line. Well, when I walked out that morning, it wasn't a\nselection line, it was just the guys going out, the guy pointed me out and I said I was hit\nduring the bombardment and he passed me. So that's how I was able to survive that. Uh,\nBlesheimer after my father, did exist and I don't have my exact dates. Till December of\n1944 when the Russians advanced. At that time, uh the uh order was given to evacuate\nthe camps. We could already hear the sound of war by hearing guns, artillery, tanks or\nwhatever, bombings. And the word we got and we were always a little bit in the dark\nsince officially we got no word at all what was going in the outside world, but\noccassionally somebody would get a newspaper which was sometimes in some cases\npunishable by death, depending on how the SS felt. You know, somebody could bring a\npaper back to camp or having a radio which I don't know if anyone had, but uh, we were\nable to find some old newspapers maybe at place of work somebody had thrown away\nand so we were sort of informed. But that was the German side that we were reading. Uh,\nin this particular case, I uh, we heard the guns and the rumor came we going to be\nevacuated. Uh, where to nobody knew. Into Germany. Away from the front. That wasn't\nto do us a favor, to get us away from the firing, but because they needed more labor\ninside Germany. And they had to get it from somewhere. And I think, I'm not sure, that\nAuschwitz was already captured at that time or not. I have no knowledge of that. But they\nwere getting close to Auschwitz too, and Auschwitz I don't think made any death\nmarches. People were just left in there or killed or whatever. But in this particular labor\ncamp that we were in, or subcamp of Auschwitz, we were evacuated. This was the plan I\nassume, and in an orderly manner we were marched every day, all day and in the night\ntime put in a field with lights away from the front towards Germany. And we finally\narrived. When somebody couldn't walk because the food, there was almost no food, days,\nwe went for days without food. Water we got once in a while. And I assume, I don't have\nany specific figure, that we were about four thousand or somewhere close to four\nthousand prisoners that were marched out of the camp. Some people remained behind,\nand there were other people in other camps that I read up after the war, that came to the\ncamp. They had to put them somewhere. People who had been marched into this camp\nfrom other camps when we were out already. They didn't know what do to with them, the\nRussians were advancing too fast, and uh, so I don't have any exact figures. It was very\nconfusing times but I assume about four thousand prisoners were marched out of\nBlesheimer. Fourteen days later, the death march arrived at the camp of Gross Rosen\nwhich was another large, larger concentration camp. And in the group that I was in, we\nwere standing in mud being counted, and I was standing in the front row being able to\nunderstand German, being able to understand the SS was reporting to his superior. He\nwas delivering 276 prisoners. Now, I can't say to this day if that is what was left of four\nthousand. I don't know how many got there. I don't know how many were killed every\nday. But what one of the common things they did was put..... END OF TAPE.....\nbarnes from farmers. Whenever they could they usually put maybe about five hundred\nprisoners to a barn. They would lock them up in the barn. This was for proper control so\nnobody could run away during the night. If they had you out in the open, that meant they\nhave lights on and they couldn't go to sleep. But if they could lock you up in a barn, they\njust have to post two or three guards around and the rest of them could go to sleep. And\nthe prisoners were locked up. Uh, so I don't know how many people were executed in\nbarns because there were a lot of executions going on and everyday, every morning\nbefore mein dof (ph) they said who cannot march any more, and people would say I can,\nI can, but they were just dragging themselves on the ground. They would shoot them by\nthe side of the road. They would just pile them up and fire into the group. The regular\nmass executions. They make sure nobody is left behind. They even went so far to make it\neasy, I don't know what they tried to do, they picked cemeteries to execute people, next to\ncemeteries. Maybe they thought they ought to get buried in a cemetery. I don't know why\nbut it is very odd. But in two cases, I've seen people be executed near cemeteries, next to\ncemeteries. Uh, so from Gross Rosen, the 276 prisoners plus other prisoners that were at\nGross Rosen, were transported in cattle cars to Buchenwald. This was a few days later.\nBuchenwald was of course well inside Germany, was on the western front. Here we're\ncoming from the eastern front to the western front. And we arrived at Buchenwald, we\ndidn't arrive, we arrived near the city of Weimar, which is rather large city, on the track\nleading through the city of Weimar to the other side of, to Buchenwald. And uh we were\nvery unfortunate. The train must have been spotted by air, by airplanes, and I don't know\nwhether they were British or American airplanes, uh, but the train was bombed. The train\nwas stationary at that time, the engine was stopped. But it was just outside the city of\nWeimar before getting to Buchenwald, and when the city was bombed, our car was hit\nand split open. Some people were killed. But neither Michael or I were hit at all, probably\ncovered by others, and we got out of the car, and this was near some German homes.\nNow, we knew we were hungry, we were starved because we hadn't gotten any food from\nthe time we left Gross Rosen in the cattle cars. Uh, we went into a house, it was the\nnearest house where the car was. It was near the railroad tracks and went in the kitchen\nand helped ourselves. The inhabitants of this house were sitting in the cellar, because the\nbombing was still going on. And the clear wasn't given. The moment the all clear was\ngiven we had our parkas full of food and we had eaten quite a bit while we were stuffing\nourselves, or loading up with food. And many prisoners did that. Those that were caught\nwere shot by the SS. We didn't get caught because that was uh, taboo, of course, going\ninto German homes and grabbing food. But again there was no way to escape. At that\ntime it would have been very easy to escape during the bombing. Where to go? Hair\nshorn off, number on the arm, and blue/white stripped uniforms. No place to go. No. And\nit was So easy to escape at that time. Well, I don't know how many survived the, uh, this\nbombing but the rest of us finally arrived at Buchenwald. Being in Buchenwald, we\nthought this was going to be the end now. They're not going to take us anymore.\nApparently they didn't know which way to go, from the east to the west, from the west to\nthe east. The Americans were coming the other way, so, and there were selection\nprocesses at Buchenwald. And I didn't mention the selection processes before, but I went\nthrough several selection processes. Some of them were more formal than others, and\nothers were just when you went to work guys were picked out and you stayed behind.\nYou were not strong enough anymore or you go. But this was a regular selection process,\nwhere to we didn't know at the time. Uh, and again, Mike and I went to the right side,\nlooking strong and fit, and even asked the questions, are you strong and do you speak\nGerman? Yes. Now, O.K. So we had no idea where we were being shipped off to, but we\nwere given shots at that time. I am coming back to that in a minute. What worried me\nlong after the war. Uh, there was apparently typhus, and we had heard of sterilization. In\nmany camps there they had experimented with sterilization and in some cases people\nwere sterilized just for the sake of sterilization and in other placces it was just for\nexperimentation. And I had thought that at Buchenwald before going to the next camp of\nLeigenstein-Zwieberge (ph), that I had maybe been sterilized. I didn't know what\nsterilization involved. It's not just giving somebody a shot, but for a long, for about a year\nafter the war, I never wanted to face the question but I thought maybe I had been\nsterilized. But it turned out that I never was sterilized because we have six children, so I\nwas safe on that point. But for a long time it was on my mind, and the only thing that I\ncould find out that we were given shots against typhus and some other things, which was\nprevalent at the time and they wanted healthy workers, healthy as they could possibly be,\nat least not have a disease that kills everyone in the room. From Buchenwald then we uh,\nfrom Buchenwald we were transported to the camp of Leigenstein- Zwieberge (ph) which\nwas a subcamp of Buchenwald, a forced labor camp. And it was hidden in the Harz\nMountains. But we didn't know at the time that 1t was a secret project of the SS where\nthey were building tunnels into the Harz Mountains. Their was Mauthausen (ph) which 1s\na more famous camp on the other end of the Harz Mountains and we were at the lower\nend of the Harz Mountains, building tunnels to construct the V-2, the flying bomb or like\nwe have seen in the Smithsonian Museum here. Uh, the V-2 was the secret weapon of\nHitler, and the only way they could produce any was underground because of the\nbombing. So they had picked the Harz Mountains to construct a factory underneath. Now\nat the end where we were, there was no factory. The factory was operating up north, but\nwe were constructing the second project, and the job consisted of being marched from\nwork everyday from this camp which was also about four thousand people, and which\nwas a very mixed camp. The Jews were a minority in there. The camp was practically led\nby communist prisoners, German communists, who had been there, the first ones 1n the\ncamp. Another group, there was a replenishment group and they were pretty well\norganized. But the camp was a terrible camp, was a temporary camp. The camp had\nexisted, by the time I got there, only about four months or five months, so it was a brand\nnew camp so it was only going to be there for the purpose of constructing these tunnels.\nUh, the march to the tunnels was very tedious every day, and almost no food. And again\nthe replenishment method was five hundred people from Buchenwald. Uh, each time five\nhundred people were dead, five hundred people, and they were thrown in mass graves.\nThere was no burning of bodies and I worked on one of the mass graves, I was detailed to\nthat for a short while and fortunately only doing one thing, digging the hole. And today\nthere are out of seven thousand prisoners who were totally there, for the normal amount\nof prisoners was four thousand, but there were three additional thousand that came to\nreplenish. So then all of them in mass graves near the camp. There is a site - I never went\nback there although I have a standing invitation from the East German government to\ncome back and be their guest - that they know of me as the only survivor who lives in the\nwestern world. And uh so the camp is still in existence, a national monument, and young\nsoldiers, East German, are being sworn in at the camp. But it 1s one of the worst camps\nthat existed. So the mass graves are there. They have a very nice site. They send me\npictures every year, and the story exists although I do believe that uh, uh, that maybe the\nstory is not complete. It 1s probably worse than if you actually read this. It is not the same\nthing if somebody tells you about it is my opinion. You cannot picture this. You cannot\npicture going hungry. Sometimes I think if you tell someone what hungry is like. But in\nLichtenstein, the work was the killing method of people. By that I mean working in\ntunnels without the proper protection. You had to dig, get the rocks out, haul them on\nlorries out or carry them out. And then the blasting. They never had the prisoners far\nenough away that somebody wouldn't get killed by the dynamite blasting and then they\nwould carry the rocks off. So the German guards, the SS guards always stood far enough\naway so they wouldn't get hit, but they didn't let the prisoners get out far enough to be\nsafe from the blasting, so many people were killed. And those people had to be carried\nback at night and put into the mass graves. You know, thrown in. And I also must\nmention one horrible thing. At the camp at Leichenstein, they buried many people who\nwere alive. People who were too weak, who couldn't get off their knees anymore, to get\nup, to stand up to go to work, and they were put in a pile with the dead people and buried.\nAt one time somebody refused to bury after they were all thrown 1n, a few live people\nwere still moving. He had recognized somebody that he knew and refused to throw earth\non him and the man was shot at the mass grave. That happened to Leichenstein. And uh,\nthere are many stories, too many of them to tell because it was by far the worst camp that\nI existed in, and was the least known camps because it was a secret project. Now, when I\nmentioned it contained a secret project, this I also read up after the war although there\nwas something known about it, something special about this camp. It was like a lot of\nrumors were circulating all the time. It was a common rumor which turned out to be true\nafter I read up on it that the order from the SS was that in case of, there wouldn't be no\nevacuation of the camp in case the Americans come. All prisoners have to be killed, no\nsurvivors. Because it was considered a secret project which they were building a special\nfactory. Now, uh, while we were working in the tunnels, there were German engineers in\nthere. I was able to get to one and ask him what he would do with his torn clothing. Every\nonce in a while he would take something off that was torn or bring it back and even some\nof them would give it to the prisoners because we were always cold. First of all, it was\nfreezing in there. Uh, I'm talking about the beginning of 1945, the mid-winter, when we\nstarted there. And I asked this German engineer if he has any old clothing he could bring\nin that we could wear under our prisoner blue/white stripped uniform and he said yes he\nwould. And I said I have a friend too, and I said he would bring in some warm clothing.\nSo he was one of the good guys. And we were able to pick up this clothing. He left it ina\ncertain place, we picked it up. And the main reason for this clothing was not to be warm.\nThat too, but the main reason was to be able to escape. We figured this is one camp we\nwill never get out of if the war lasts any longer and we had no idea in January or\nFebruary how long the war was going to last. And we say if we did well so far, we are not\ngoing to do well here because no way. And there was killing by working people to death.\nThat was all, and beating to death.",
        "A: Yes, this was one of the camps where Mike was working in another place, but at night\ntime we were together in the barracks. Uh, the specific story that I can tell, there are\nreally too many, but is how we were put in the barracks, just lined up like sardines. There\nwas not enough place to sleep, for everybody to stretch out. There were no double bunks.\nIt was just the plain floor of the barracks I was in. But apparently the camp was created\nfor a lot less people and then there are four thousand people and maybe the camp was\ncreated for a thousand people. I don't know. I would say so. But then the people just\nstretch out on all these barrack floors. And uh, at night time when people would come\nback from work in the dark, there would be no light on. People would fight and actually\nstrangle each other, become like animals, just to get a place to sleep. And we were\nattacked many times, but Mike and I, we always stood together and we defended\nourselves, just for having a place to sleep. It was terrible. People were just like animals\nand there were people who went to the pile up place where there were bodies and thought\nthey could cut out a piece of meat. And they were caught. And some would be severely\npunished for doing that. These peoples were considered inhuman, but they were crazed\nfrom hunger, some of these people. And particularly when somebody was left in the\nbarracks of a couple of days, too weak to go to work, and it would be the end after a few\ndays anyway and people would die. And like I said, they grabbed some of these people\nand buried them alive. They didn't even pile them up anymore outside, just took them\ndirectly to the mass grave. And each mass grave at Leigenberg-Zwieberge (ph) has five\nhundred people and I believe there were six of them. Uh, now, the story in the barracks,\nthis is one of my most vivid memories of all the camps, is that overhead, these were just\none floor barracks, and we sleep on the floor. There were rafters overhead holding the\nroof together, and every morning as we got up there would be people hanging. Every\nmorning, in every barracks. Because people knew they were not going to survive and any\nday, and might as well die now instead of living a few more days, a few more weeks.\nWell, lucky for Mike and me, we didn't feel that way. We figure it's got to be the end.\nWe're going to survive. We have to. And, uh, maybe they're going to evacuate us you\nknow. We also hear that the Allies are coming closer, but we were just .. And we teamed\nwith four other guys at that time who also had the same ideas. They were all about our\nage and they were all making it sort of, like we did, being able to stand up on their own\ntwo legs. And we said, we shall escape together. And they also had gotten civilian clothes\nlike we did from some other place they were working, they were wearing underneath\ntheir blue/white stripped uniforms. And, uh, so we said, well we'll try and escape and\nthen we go in different directions, maybe two one way, two another way, maybe one SS\nguard is firing, maybe he'll hit some of us, maybe he won't hit anybody. But some of us\nwill get out. But we always noticed that if one person would escape they would always\nhit him, by submachine gun fire. Automatic fire. So we had that in mind. We always\nstuck together. And said if it comes to an evacuation we won't be on a death march like\nthe one from the eastern front that we will never survive, because we know what\nhappened there. And we should escape then from the march because that would be\ntowards the end anyway from . Uh, coming back to the people that were hanging\nthemselves. It was our job every morning before going outside for report period, people\nwould be counted - how many are still alive, how many are still there - that we had to\ntake those bodies down from the rafters. And pile them outside the barracks, and then\nanother group would come and pick them up and take them to the mass graves. Uh, my, if\nI, for years, and I still do occasionally, there wasn't a night, and I, like I mentioned, I have\na large family so my family gets my mind off these things and I have a very normal life. I\nhave had after the war, or soon after I get married it was more normal than ever. Uh, for\nyears, when I had dreams it was about escaping, escaping. Because it was always on our\nminds, escaping. Whenever I had a dream, even today when I am sometimes, probably\ntonight I'll have one, I will dream about escaping. It was a standard thing. And that is\nwhat kept me alive. That's what kept Michael Schwab (ph) alive, you know. And, but the\nother dream that is more frequent than any dream about the concentration camp, is about\nthe people hanging themselves. There is nothing more vivid in my mind than seeing those\npeople taking their own lives. It was bad enough, somebody else taking your life, or mass\nexecution, but people just giving up, just plain giving up. And I have had occasions, and I\ndon't do this anymore since I know what my problem is, that I watered the lawn one day\nat my home, and my pants were very wet, and I hung up the pants in the shower, and the\npants were just hanging there, and I got up during the night and that's nothing. When I\nhave a bad dream, and I walked into where the toilet is and I saw these pants hanging and\nimmediately I thought somebody was hanging there. And, uh, like suicides are, is one of\nthe worst memories I have, because so many people committed suicide. Not just by\nrafters. We had people, and my thoughts have been divided on that - whether it was a\ncourageous act or a coward's act, I'm not judging people when they commit suicide. I\nwould never do it. Uh, I would feel, I get through things. And uh, although, given\nthought, yes, I must admit I've given it thought. I think everyone who has been in\nconcentration camp has given thought to suicide. But uh, I have seen a man commit\nsuicide why I thought it was a courageous act. When he stood in front, when we were\nrepairing a railway, and the second line (ph) a speed train came by and he just went in\nfront of the train and he stood there facing it and he got run over by the train. It killed\nhim. And I, you know, there were many other ways. We tried to prevent suicides, but that\nis a Shameful thing in my opinion. On my own part, the only thing I would help\nsomebody that wants to die, let them die if they want to die. That's an old man that I saw\nhad cut his wrists, and I shouted because there was blood spurting from his wrists, and we\nmade a tourniquet, bandaged him up and he was taken back to camp and he was beated\nup savagely and he was killed that night for trying to deprive the German state of labor.\nAnd that was the sentence on this guy. You couldn't even commit suicide - that was\nagainst the law to commit suicide. And that man would have been much better off dying\non the ground where I found him, at work. And uh, so, from then on my idea was about\nsuicide, if somebody wants to do it, let them do it. Now, if it would have been somebody\nclose to me 1t would have been a different story. Like if my friend Mike Schwab would\nhave done it, I would have tried to talk him out of it. But I knew that he, that just a\nmomentary thing, it is not something he believes in. I think a lot of people think about it\nfor a long time before they do it. Or they do it on short notice. They say all of a sudden,\nwhatever. Well, uh, these are some of the incidents, and Lagenstein was probably the\nworst camp and the worst memories I have. Everything goes into the background when I\nthink about Langenstein. And uh, we were also the first time, I didn't mention this, this\nwas also common practice, when you did something you weren't supposed to be doing, or\nthey just wanted to get to you somehow, you got beatings. Officially, not just being hit,\nbut being laid over what they called the bok (ph), which is like a special chair for\nbeatings, and they would lash you. Mike and I both got caught one time, hiding, trying to\nget out of some work, and we got special beating. But we were strong and we were able\nto survive it, although Mike got the worst of it and on your bare rear and I got hit, by\nother prisoners - they had to do this, the SS didn't do this, just counted and stood by - but\nmy guard left for a while because he wanted to get some cigarettes. And so the prisoner\ndidn't beat me as hard as he should have, and he told me to shout real loud, to scream.\nAnd I did, so I didn't get a very hard beating. It was fifty lashes and my friend Mike got\nfifty full, and his posterior was bleeding and pussy for a long, long time. There was\nnothing to treat him with. So this was common place. Not only at Langenstein but in\nother places too. But Lagenstein was the worst. So I am coming to the next and the last\nstory I think. My escape.",
        "A: O. K. We're off now.",
        "A: O.K. that gives me, that's good, that gives me a couple of minutes - I wanted to tell that\nfrom beginning to end without..",
        "A: Well, I didn't want to tell that story. Sucking it out, somebody, the doctor sucking it out\nwith the mouth and then swished his mouth in water, with warm water. We did have\nsome warm water.",
        "A: Yes, and I'm a good healer. I heal, I get something or I don't develop infection so fast.",
        "A: Well, my daughter asked me yesterday, she knows I'm coming over. We have three boys\nand three girls. Uh, why don't you write your story. After this, I divorce myself from all\nthese stories. I can't sleep. Occassionally I did it because my children went to that high\nschool, I talked at the high school. Tell me when we're on. In Falls Church, George\nMason High School in Falls Church. Are we on already?",
        "A: Uh, I have talked. We are on?",
        "A: O.K. We knew the Allies were approaching. And in this case the American Army. That\nwas more or less known. Uh, some people overheard the SS - they were talking the\nAmericans are coming. O.K. What's the next thing. The order was to evacuate the\nprisoners, but noboby knew where. So Mike and I made up our mind, the other four guys,\nwe're going to escape. The first march that we make, the first night or the second or third\nor whenever we can, we're not going to last for fourteen days. But, as they transported us,\nwe went out in groups of five hundred people, and the SS did that for a purpose. I didn't\nknow that at the time. We thought it was for better control. Instead of having a large\ngroup of four thousand prisoners, or three thousand five hundred together in one group, if\nthere is a mass escape, they cannot kill everybody. So they took groups of five hundred\npeople each. And we thought that was for better control. Have the guards around, and\nsome of them with dogs. I think each group had about one or two police dogs, German\nShepherds, and they were pretty vicious. And I didn't even tell any story about the dogs.\nCough. Uh, when we were marched out in groups of five hundred, we thought it was for\ncontrol purpose and the order was to march prisoners at night so the population wouldn't\nsee us, and to sleep them and rest during the day, because the SS had to rest to. But we\nwalked out and we were walking towards the tunnels, and then we were redirected. Now\nthis I found later. I didn't know all this at the time. Because from the publication that the\nEast Germans sent me, what actually happened. The order, and this I found out after the\nwar, I didn't know this at the time, the order was to take the groups of prisoners, in group\nof five hundred, in different tunnels and dynamite the tunnels and bury the prisoners alive\nin there, so there would be no survivors. Because the order was no survivors from that\nparticular secret project. If they shoot them, yes, they could have done it. But easier to\ndrive them to the tunnels, which was just a few miles away, and dynamite the tunnels\nalive. But as it turned out, they were in radio contact with their former observers, or\ntroops, or whatever. Uh, there was American tank column cited coming around the\nmountain. And they were looking for the tunnels. They knew there was something secret\ngoing on because they are trying to find the tunnels by air one time because we were\nthere and there was air alarm, and a torpedo plane and tried to put a torpedo into the\ntunnel. It was not successful. It was all camouflaged. Uh, they redirected us because they\nthought the American tank column was going to cut us off before they get to the tunnels.\nSo we marched back. We marched to camp, and then we marched, to make a\nlong story short, we marched three nights till we actually escaped. And what happened,\nevery night, they parked us, let us rest in a barn, just like in the first march. During the\nday, they took, they requisitioned a barn from a farmer. Since we were only five hundred\npeople and they could put five hundred people in almost any barns, squeeze them in 1f it's\na small barn, and then, bring us out at night. Now, if the farmer was a decent guy, he had\nsome potatoes and food for the prisoners. Even for five hundred because he's feeding\ncows and other animals. So in the first and second night we got some food from the\nfarmer, it was the only thing, and water. In the night time, they put the prisoners, of\ncourse, into these barns and they posted guards outside. The next morning, march again.\nWhoever couldn't march was shot by the SS - the same system like the other. So, again,\nwe were prepared at that time - we were wearing our civilian clothes underneath and we\nsaid we've got to go the first chance we get. So on the third night, we had just, we had\ndecided if we had crossed several small bridges or small streams or rivers, we have to get\nacross the river because, we could all swim, we knew that. And we had decided after\ncrossing a bridge would be the most opportune moment to escape and then go towards, or\nswim across because a dog would pursue you on land. But a dog would not swim across\nthe river unless he 1s trained to do so. But the concentration camps' dogs I don't think\nwere trained to go into water. They were trained to pursue prisoners on land. So we\ndecided that ours, and then he would not, he could not smell, dogs cannot smell across\nwater but they can smell across land, so they can follow you. If they turn the dog loose.\nWell what happened then, on the third night we had just come across a small bridge. We\ndidn't know where we were. We were getting away from the American front, that's all we\nknew. Where to nobody knew. And I don't think, the SS were just trying to get us away\nbecause they didn't know what to do, and I think there must have been a dissention\namong them whether to kill or not to kill the prisoners. And I think one case I heard that a\nSS tried to make contact with the prisoners, that he was a good guy, that they should say\nso in case the Americans come. So maybe some of them were O.K. and some of them\nwere not, and some were just scared and maybe the troop transports on the roads\nand they were particularly following roads. And that's where all the transportation. As we\ncame across a small river there was an air alert, and it was normal procedure, as we were\nwalking in ranks of four, with the SS on the side on a small country road, a body seen\nfrom the air, and by that I mean at night time, signled airplanes who would be the\nobservation plane... TAPE ENDS... and prisoners escaped and this happened and they\ngot shot. When planes were not around, they put the searchlights on and sent the dog after\nthem, or they would shoot the prisoner and they couldn't run so fast, you know, and __.\nSo there were several, there were, a matter of fact, quite a few escapes but everyone of\nthem would get caught, so we thought that the time to escape was near a small river if we\nwere lucky amd we had lucky a plan overhead, just above where we were going to go. So\nwe were lying down and we knew that were going to be no searchlight on and we took\noff. All six of us said go, and we went. And we must have been just a couple of hundred\nyards away from the river and one dog that decided the last moment's enough for us. I got\nbitten by the dog in my leg, and I didn't even feel it. I didn't even know I was bitten. I\nthought, I fell a couple of times, but the dog, you cannot see as well, but the dog went\nafter the other prisoners, and I don't know to this date - I never found out the story - but\nonly Mike and I made it. The others went in different directions, like I said. That was our\nplan, to go in different directions and some of us get through. Either some of these people\nare killed by the dog, but we didn't see anybody and we inquired a little bit about it later\non after our liberation, but they didn't know of any other prisoners that escaped. They\nknew, because we were reported by the SS to the local police, there are two escaped\nprisoners. So I assume that the other four were killed and they found them. But Mike and\nI got to the river, and we swam across, and then we were safe from the SS, from the dog,\nand the first thing we did, we figure if we stay out in the open, we're sunk. They maybe\ncome with a local police dog and sniff us out. And we didn't smell so good and uh, we\nwere full of lice and I mean, even with our civilian clothes on, I had a black jacket on, the\nwhite lice were just running around on the suit. And anybody would have recognized\nsomebody coming from a concentration camp. But anyway, the first thing we did we\nwent to some, there were some farmhouse nearby, and like I said it was at night and I\ndon't remember what time it was but it must have been past midnight, maybe two or three\nin the morning and people would be asleep. So we decided we have to get off the roads,\noff the land where somebody could find us the next morning and hid someplace where it\nis safe, but not out in the open. So we got to a farmhouse and we found a window next to\nthe, where the stable is. Underneath the stable there is, this was a solid build, brick stable.\nAnd underneath the stable they had a cellar, and this was a cellar for the foods for the\nanimals, and also the potatoe cellar. They store hugh amount of potatoes in Germany, and\nwe decided to get in through the cellar hole which was from the outside, not going\nthrough the front. When we lifted it up, I let myself down. We didn't know what we\nwould hit in the dark, whether it would be some water or something. We were scared.\nAnd Michael was holding on to my arms, and I said there must be something below me.\nIt smells like maybe potatoes, I wasn't sure you know. And I guess right, I didn't know. I\nfigured it was potatoes, and then he let me go, and maybe about a couple inches below\nmy feet I hit potatoes. But I was afraid that I wouldn't get out anymore if I let myself drop\nor whatever in the dark, and you don't know what is going on. So anyway, Michael came\nin and then we dug a hole in the potatoes so we figured in the morning somebody might\nopen up the door to the potatoe cellar, we'd be sitting right on top of the potatoes sleeping\nor something. So we dug a hole into the potatoes, covered us up with potatoes, and there\nwas enough air to get in of course, that was no problem, until we knew the next day\nwhere we were and what we could do. So we got out the next day when everything was\nquiet, the next evening when it started getting dark, and we stayed there a full day, and of\ncourse were not found. And then we went into, we got some milk to drink. We went into\nthe stable. We found some milk. I think it was put there for the cats. They had a lot of\ncats. We drank the milk from the cats and we got food that was for the cows, and we took\nand filled out pocket up with potatoes. We ate raw potatoes, that didn't, but we were\nworried about diarrhea, of course. Anything raw. But we got our first real food, and then\nwe went our way. Uh, we decided that to use the same routine, to sleep during the day, in\nbushes, but get away from the villages now, and uh, to go towards the sound of the\nartillery fire that was coming closer and closer. We didn't know which direction. We\ndidn't know which uh way should we get away. Where we would go? Would be another\nvillage in front of us or not. But we wanted to get away from villages, uh, because that's\nwhere most people were and we would be recognized possibly. Uh, what we did then is\nsleep in bushes during the day near some field or someplace and then march at night\ntoward the sound of fire. And that took us seven days. And there 1s another little story but\nI think it is so long, un incidents along the way, but anyway. We came to a village . .",
        "A: We have plenty of time. O.K. We had the most fantastic thing happen. I think you have to\nhave, you have to be lucky. I keep stressing that, not just do some thinking, but also be\nlucky and healthy. On the sixth day or so, it was just a day or two before our actual\nliberation, we were sleeping in bushes. Actually one was supposed to be watching, one\nwas supposed to be sleeping. I was supposed to be sleeping, Mike was supposed to be\nwatching. And, but watching would not have helped very much except somebody's\ncoming and they couldn't run away and then somebody would know. But we could kill\none person. We decided if somebody is getting dangerous and tells us to come along with\nthem or something that we would strangle the person. We knew we could do it. We had\nabsolutely made up our mind that's what we would do. But we were both asleep and\nbeing awakened by jack boots. Now jack boots was what the SS wore, but he was the\nlocal policeman. There must have been only one policeman in that little village. And uh,\nhe said, identification, he said in German. And we said, well we are foreign workers, we\nare from Holland we said. And Michael started talking Dutch a little bit and I spoke\nDutch of course too, and we started mixing our German with a little Dutch. And he said I\nwant to see papers. We don't have any papers. He said where are your papers. I said\nwe've been bombed out. When we came back from the fields from work, we were foreign\nworkers here, the place wasn't there anymore. Everything just what we're wearing to\nwork - that's what we have, no more papers. And he started looking at us and he started\ngoing like this, He saw the lice crawling around. You know, stay away. Then he said,\nmitcom, come with me. I said oh my God, the SS, where to. Well he said, and he seemed\nto be inebriated a little bit. He had just had a couple of drinks, beers probably, you know.\nAnd the war was coming to an end, and things were pretty confusing. And we could\nsmell the alcohol on him, and figured well, this man is maybe not dangerous but we don't\nwant to anywhere. What are we doing to do? He had a pistol in his holster, and I said we\ncan grab it and kill him but then somebody is really going to come looking for us, and\nmaybe we can't get that far away. Everybody be alerted or something. So we figure, we\nnoticed that the man was not decent, but he was scared. And he said at the end, he made a\ncomment to it, well he said I have to take you because there are some escaped prisoners\nin this are",
        "A: And we figured I said are we going to get there. Well, he said if you, if we can identify\nyou, he said you can get some temporary papers because a lot of people have lost their\npapers because of bombings. They came home - no more homes. But I cannot let you go.\nSo I said to Michael, I looked at him and I said, what do we do. I said, kill him? You\nknow, we had a little sign. But we couldn't say anything, you know. We could just look at\neach other and try to understand each other through eye movements, and we could see\nthis guy wasn't really all there. He was, as a matter of fact, he was about, I was going to\nsay an old man. He was my age or older. And, uh, so I said well, let's try it. Maybe we're\nlucky. And, we can't, maybe we're, somebody's going to find out about us here in the\nopen anyway. If he lets us go now maybe then send a search house party for us or let's go.\nSo he took us to city hall. The city hall was just a part-time job for - it was a full time job\nfor the policeman - part-time job for the mayor who was a farmer, and he was burning\npapers. We came in there and he had a stove burning papers. And he said in German, or\ncourse, we couldn't understand everything, he said I pick up some Dutch workers here.\nWhen he said that I felt pretty secure you know. And he said they lost there papers in a\nbombing raid. Uh, can we give them some papers? Ah, he said, ;\nwhat's the use, the war is finished. He said who cares about papers the mayor said you\nknow. And he didn't want to have anything to do with anybody. And he looked at us and\nhe said to us, and the guy, the policeman went in the next room to make a phone call or to\ndo something. I didn't know what he was doing, but he left for a second. He said to us,\nthe mayor, we have some concentration camp escapees in here, so we are being careful\nyou know. He looked at us like he knew we were. And we figured he's not going to do\nanything. So we said, well, the policeman came back in, and he said, get rid of them. I\ndon't want to have anything to do with them. And he said, well, I said, we have to get\nsome, and then we started getting frantic (ph), and said give us some paper please. I said\nthat you know we lost our papers in a bombing. Well I said, I can't give you any paper.\nThere is nothing you can prove, nothing I can prove. So anyway, there was a big\ndiscussion and finally said, well, we're not going to insist because this guy might change\nhis mind. And so he, the mayor said to the policeman, why don't you take them and get\nthem out of this village. Well, he got us out of the place. By the time we got to the next\nguest house, beer house, he smelled beer again, and he said well, you go this way and\nthen you go to next village. Maybe they will give you some paper. And he went into the\nbeer hall. And we were free. I said, Michael, I said, we got out of something that could\nhave turned out bad. The only thing it would have made us is killers. We trying to save\nour lives and it would have gone wrong. So we were lucky again. And somehow it was\nalways a sense that we're going to make it. I mean the sense never left us, Michael and\nmyself. And then, somehow, through luck or through our own thinking, or, or doing\nthings the right way and uh, mostly luck, that we're going to make it. The one thing that\nnever left me is the sense that if anybody's going to make it, I'm going to make it. And\nnever give up hope. And Michael was the same way. And O.K. Now our actual\nliberation. So we went to the next village. And we noticed that this village when we got\ninside, on the outskirts of the village, there were fields that some people had next to their\nfarms. We said we cannot be out in the open fields. There wasn't that much other\nvegetation there. Let's get close to the village where there are some bushes or something\nand sit down or lay down and go to sleep. The Americans got to be here anytime. So, we\nlaid out there, and in the night we heard tanks rolling. And then we heard German voices,\nand we didn't know this, when we got there, they had placed that same evening what they\ncalled faukstorma (ph), which is the German national guard if you call it. They are old\nguys and young fellows. Last minute they put them into uniform and make soldiers out of\nthem. And they had placed these guys with ponce so founst (ph) in little holes in the\nground to be a defense against tanks. And ponce so foust (ph) is a, I'm not sure what, we\ncall it a anti-tank weapon. It's a shoulder held weapon that one man can fire. It's not a gun\nand they can sit in a hole and usually one loads the gun and one fires the gun. And there\nwas one very close to us, and we wanted to, the first thing we wanted to do was when we\nwould hear tanks coming across the field, go towards the tanks, put our arms up. But we\nfigure if we do this we may get shot from behind or something for deserters in the dark or\nwhatever. And we didn't want to get shot by the other side either you know, by the\nAmericans. So as the tanks were coming across in the morning, it must have been about\nfive o'clock in the morning, as it started getting a little light - no it wasn't getting light that\ntime - but they started coming about five o'clock I think - I didn't have a watch - we\ndecided we're going to move on the ground towards them. Well, somebody noticed\nsomething moving in that one hole, and they had in the meantime had holes on the right,\nprobably on both sides of where we were __. But we were far enough away not to be\nseen, maybe uh, hundred and fifty yards from each hole. I don't know, but we must have\nbeen right in the middle. And uh, one guy called over in German, what 1s that patrol (ph)\n- 1s this a patrol, because they didn't know from their own people that - they just thought\nit was a German army patrol. And I said to the guy, hel mut (ph), keep your mouth shut,\nshut up I said, and the guy was quiet you know. And he probably was believing that we\nwere German patrols since he could only see us crawling. And then it takes the tank, one\ncompany of tanks for seventeen tanks, all of a sudden came across the field. And as soon\nas we saw the first tank coming we put up our hands and we were just hoping that they\nwouldn't start firing, because prisoners get shot sometimes too, even if you give up. Well,\nthe lead tank, the guy jumped down, and he spoke German, he was a German-American\nthat they used as an interpreter, and he made all the tanks stop and he brought the officers\nup, the commanding officer, and they radioed back to the battalion that they had some\nguys who were escaped prisoners, and to make a long story short, they used us. In other\nwords, we knew what was in front of them. Which was the right thing to do and we were\nglad to do it. And they said you're prisoners, you look like prisoners. can you prove it?\nWe showed the number on the arm and apparently some of them knew already. They had\ncrossed a concentration camp, another one someplace. This was the Third Armored\nDivision, D Company of the 32nd Armored Regiment of the Third Armored Division.\nOne of Patton's divisions. And uh, so we had a small conference there, and they if we say\nany German army units, or they were particularly interested German 88 anti-tank guns,\nand I said all we know the German ponce de foust (ph), the anti-tank weapon, and they\nare all old or young guys as far as we can determine from their voices but we don't know\nfor sure. We just crawled through. So they got on the tank with the P.",
        "A: system and the guy in this German said there are no German army troops around, there\nare only the army helpers, the national guard or the uh, German folkstrom (ph), young\nguys and old people - that 1t would be silly to fire one shot because the moment the first\nshot is fired, they are going to destroy the village. And they hoisted white flags and they\ngave up and there was not one shot fired. And uh, so, then, it came to us, and we were\ntaken back to battalion headquarters where the battalion surgeon examined us right away.\nWe were then put on scales and uh, it was a small, like a small, not hospital, a batallion\naid station. And they had all the medical equipment to take care of, and that was basically\nour liberation. And then the regimental commander came looking at us, congratulating us\nand then the company commander said if they want to stay with us, the boys they can\nstay with us. Then when they went into the village, they requisitioned a house for the two\nof us, and told the women to make a hot bath for us. That we were going to be bathed by\nmedics, and cleaned up completely, because they have to go on, and we can't go with lice\nwith them on the tanks. That we have to be , and they came with Lysol and\nwhatever you have as a disinfectant, and we were completely taken care of medically.\nAnd examined by a medical doctor or military doctor and found to be healthy, not have\nany communicable diseases. But it actually wasn't exact the first day, we went through a\ncouple of days of check-ups. But in the meantime, we were then, the first thing to do was\nget rid of the lice. And that we did. And our hair shorn off again for last time. And uh,\nthen, we stayed, to make a long story short, we stayed with D Company of this tank\nbattalion for six months. The war was over in another few weeks. And they were taken\nout of combat immediately. After that village, that was their last combat session. And we\nstayed with them, and with an O.K. by the higher ups, that we can stay as long as we\nwant to until we find our families, \u2018til we are certain we are finding anybody family. In\nthe meantime, we are changed from these old prisoner garments to GI uniforms. We were\njust like soldiers without rank of course and we were treated in the mess hall like kings,\nand we had access to the mess hall, not during dinner hours but anytime we wanted to\nwalk in eat. We picked up 50 pounds in three months. Which was really a dangerous\nthing to do because I heard a lot of prisoners overate, and we did too, and killed\nthemselves overeating. And that basically is the story. And uh, so, then to finish up, after\nour escape, my first thought was to find the family, but I didn't know where to start. And\nfirst we had to get back on track, get normal again. So Michael and I stayed and like I\nsaid for six months. And then we were taken back, they were moved back to the area near\nSchofenborg (ph) which is near Frankfurt, into their regular area where they were going\nto settle down. This little town, which called Viny Koomstad (ph) near Frankfurt. And\nthis company was then settled down and we settled down with them. We given a place, a\nplace they requisitioned. So the first thing, we still didn't have any papers, the question of\npapers, what to do about papers. So they inquired with the police and say, they have to go\nto DP camps. When we heard camps, just the name camps, no way we're going to any\ncamps. We didn't know at the time about DP camps. To us DP camps was another, a\nbetter concentration camp. You know, another camp. But it wasn't true of course. But we\njust heard the name camp and we said no. And uh, the batallion commander said the boys\ndon't have to go to any camp if they don't want to. They just go to get papers. So they\ncommander officer sent an officer with us to Frankfurt DP camp. This was right in the\ncity of Frankfurt where there was a compound where all the Jewish refugees moved in.\nAh, not just Jewish refugees, there were other refugees, but they were mostly Jews that\nhad been liberated from camps or were picked up in other places, forced laborers from\nother foreign countries. They were in an enclosure and there was a guard at the gate but\nyou could walk in and out once you had your papers. But people were taken care of\nmedically and furnished papers after they were identified. So he took us 1n there and the\nuh, official said they have to stay here, they can't go back with you because they don't\nhave any papers. It will take maybe, take weeks before we get any confirmation on them.\nAnd we have such a overload here anyway, and the lieutenant looked at us, and he said,\nwell, what you decide boys. And the thing was up to us, not to this guy, official there.\nAnd I said we're not staying. Papers or no papers, we're not going to stay in another\ncamp. And we stay with you. So he took us back and then there was an agreement\nreached that we can stay until we get papers, until we also, even after we get papers, we\ncan stay with them while we decide where our families are, go back to, Michael to\nAmsterdam, Holland, and my case go both to Brussels, Belgium, and Muchenglablak\n(ph), Germany. Because either place our family could have been. But we had decided in\nthe case of my immediate family was in Brussels, Belgium. My parents that we would\nmeet in Brussels, Belgium. Or meet 1n Muchenglablak (ph) with a Catholic family that\nwe know. So I went to both places. Didn't find of course anybody. And I did find some\ndistant cousins and I did make some contact with the Joint Distribution Committee,\nwhich was of course a Jewish organization. And although I didn't find anybody, I stayed\nin Brussels, and uh, was taken care of by the Jewish organization in Brussels, and then\nthe thing I have to get some education and so on, and then I, by that time I was alsmost\n19. No, by the time I came back I was 19 already. Uh, they said that I am too old for an\norphanage, too lot Jewish orphans or kids that were picked up after the war. But the man\nthat ran the Joint Distribution Organization in Brussels was Mr. Munsba (ph) who had\nbeen one of my father's friends in one of the camps, in the French camps of St. Cyprien,\nand he said, well, 18 is the limit for orphanages, but you're past limit, but we'll let you\nhave a little room in here, and you find a job. We'll put you through school. We'll do\nsomething for you. So I got a little room in the orphanage there and I went to school,\nback to school, and tried to learn a trade at the same time. And Michael went back to\nHolland at the same time. He wasn't as lucky as I was. He didn't find, well I didn't find\nanybody. He didn't find anyone from his family. Everybody was killed. And uh, he didn't\nhave the offer to go into an orphanage or anything up there. So he went back to the Third\nArmored Division. They had given him papers, they had given me papers too, to use\nofficial transportation and just like military, like an American military guy, to get back to\nthis place in Germany. We were fully covered. So Michael took advantage of that and uh,\nmake his long story afterward short, he was adopted by an American soldier, non-Jewish\nsoldier, to come to the United States. And he stayed with him until he actually left for the\nUnited States. I remained in Belgium, and I also came to the United States, but I came in\na different way. I came by asking for visa to go to the United States, and I had to wait\nuntil December '47 to get to the United States. I did get to the United States. And the\ndraft was still going on here. I was going to be drafted. In Europe, if you were in\nGermany of course, but Germany didn't have an army, but other countries, like France, or\nBelgium, they were still drafting too after the war for a while. I would have been subject\nto the draft. Well, 1t would have been a bad thing after the concentration camps of course.\nYou know, you want to lead a regular life. But here the United States had nothing to do\nwith me, that my past was in a concentration camp. I would have been subject to the\ndraft. So what I did instead, I volunteered for military service with the agreement they\nhad at this time to get the GI Bill, or to remain and make the military a career. What I was\nafter getting an education from the military. I did exactly that. I came in as an enlisted\nman, I became a sergeant, then became a citizen and when I got my citizenship was able\nto go to Officer's Candidate School and became an officer and make the Army a career\nfor twenty years. And uh, I had by initial boots anyway with the army after my liberation\nand I was very successful. And then I joined the civil service after my military career.\nAnd I was another twenty years in the civil service. But I probably missed the story that\nis very close to my heart that I wanted to mention about my children, about my wife. And\nI married a German woman who's not Jewish, and my children grew up Jewish in\nremembrance of my parents. And nothing else, if I don't feel that strong about religion, I\nwanted them to have something. Everybody should grow up with a religion, and have a\nbelief, believe in something. And the closest thing to me was being Jewish, and closer\nthan that, that my parents had to die because they were Jews, the sole reason, because\nthey were Jews. And uh, I'm going to bring up one more thing here. Uh, about two\nmonths ago, I made a trip to Germany. And I visited my, the old folks are not alive\nanymore, the Christian people that helped my family, that helped my grandparents who\nby the way were deported to Lasenstadt (ph), the ghetto and also perished, including an\n80 year old grandfather. My father, before he died, sat down with me in the camps at\nnight, and tried to recall everybody that was left from the Willner family in Germany.\nAnd that possibly also had the same fate that we had went to the concentration camps.\nUh, he had a very good memory, and he counted out all the people, naming names, and I\nmust have known personally maybe two-thirds of the people that he mentioned. The\nothers were not known to me. But they were all the Willner family - it was a close,\nclosely-knit family who all lived in the Rhineland of Germany, near Cologne-Dusseldorf.\nSo the distances weren't very great, they even weren't spread out over Germany. I think\none lived in Berlin, but the rest of them lived in the Rhineland and had been living there\nfor the past four hundred years. I even have some documentation that I got in Germany,\nwith the Hebrew name of one of my ancestors who first had the name of Willner and he\nhad a Hebrew name of course too. And uh, it was done by a doctoral dissertation by a\nGerman after the war, and he picked the Willners as one of the families that he did his\ndissertation on. And so when I visited recently, uh, I knew this before I went that in\nmonths of August and September, they inviting Jews back to the city as guests of the city\nof Muchenglablak, which have done some other cities in Germany. My name wasn't on\nthe list to be there, but since I was visiting on my own with my friends, I was passed on\nto some city officials to tell me someone visiting early and they made a joke of it. They\ngot their dates wrong. And, uh I didn't get the dates wrong because this was a personal\nvisit | was making to Germany and some other country. And uh, I agreed that I would see\nsome city officials who wanted some advance information on what a person like me who\ncomes back to his former hometown would feel like. They had a lot of apprehension that\nfor instance, one person in '85, an old lady, wrote them a letter and said, what is this good\nfor, why reopen old wounds. Why are you inviting us back here? Well, to make a long\nstory short, out of the people they invited, probably about 90% of the people are coming.\nAs the guests of the city, for one week. Uh, they were very apprehensive, and really\nwanted to know, particularly from one who got the worst. In other words, they are\ninviting people back who escaped Germany. They are Holocaust survivors, but they were\neither in United States, in Great Britain, in uh Australia or some other place. But they\ndidn't know how many had been in a concentration camp. Since I had been in\nconcentration camp and uh, also probably am one of the youngest, if not the youngest, I\nwas told, in the group that was coming back. They wanted to know how I would feel\nabout this, how I would feel about collective guilt, which by the way, I don't believe in\ncollective guilt. There are also good Germans just as well as there are bad Germans, and I\nam sorry to say that I've seen people in this country ... END OF TAPE but then he said\nI'm very hesitant to do this, but I see that you are interested in this, that you're into what\nhappened to your family, that you went in search of your family after the war. I have a\nbook that recently came out that the German government put out that has about 150,000\nnames, 125 or 150 thousand I don't remember exactly of German Jews that perished.\nConclusion of Interview.\n"
