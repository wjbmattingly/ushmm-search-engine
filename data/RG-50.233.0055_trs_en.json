I am here on behalf of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in\nWashington to interview him about his family's experiences during the Holocaust. Good morning,\nMr. Himmelfarb.\nGood morning, good morning.\nWhere were you born?\nI was born in a small town called Koprzewnitz which is approximately six kilometers from the\nVistula; in Polish they call it Wisla. The Vistula divided Galicia and Poland. Poland became, after\nWorld War I, became independent. The other side of the Vistula was belonged to Austria, that's why\nthey call it Galicia.\nWere you born in the southern part of the country or the northern part?\nI would say if it's near the Vistula, that would be the northern part of the country.\nWhat was your name when you were born?\nIn Yiddish, they call me Wolzalik (ph)(c.28). In public school, they call me Wolf. Of course, when\nI came to the United States, my name was changed to William and I kept that name since then.\nWhen were you born?\nI was born in 1927, June 19 in Koprzewnitz.",

        "Did you have any brothers and sisters?\nI had a younger brother, Izzy, and I had a younger sister, Hannah. Of course, they're both not here\nwith me. I am the only survivor in the whole family.\nYou are the oldest of three children?\nI am the oldest of three children. Your father, can you tell us about your father?\nMy father had a small business. A grocery store, he had. His main business, of course, was the store.\nHe was a very religious man, worked five, six days a week. The seventh day was Sabbath and he\nnever had the store opened. This was our income. That was his livelihood, the business. The people\nwho lived in the town, actually lived from one another. You buy from me, I buy from you. Whatever\nthe other person was selling, that's even. You sell shirts or pants, you sort of exchanged it. Most of\nthe time there used to be a market on a Thursday. Every Thursday, the people from the villages or\nthe farms would come into the town which was the biggest day of the week. Everybody was doing\nbusiness, buying and selling. That's how everybody made a living.\nYour father had his own store?\nYes, we had our own grocery store.\nHis customers were from the town and from outside?\nFrom outside and in the town.\nJewish and non-Jewish?\nJewish and non-Jewish. At that time everything was beautiful, perfect. No problem whatsoever.\nHow about your mother?",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "My mother was mostly house. Took care of the children, three children to take care of. But when\nmy father had to go to purchase merchandise, so she covered that particular day. Also, on Thursday\nwhich was market day, she stayed in the store with him. (c.53)\nDid you live in an apartment in the same building as the store or separately?\nNo. The store was my mother's sister lived in the back of the store. This was originally my\ngrandparents' house. We used the front as a store and the rear was my aunt's apartment. We had our\napartment a few minutes away from where the store was located.\nYou had a large family then?\nYes, so to speak of, yes. My father comes from a family of nine children.\nSo he was one of nine children?\nHe was one of nine children. My mother comes of a family of six children.\nThey had known each other before?\nYes.\nI saw a picture of them earlier, when they were engaged.\nMy father and my mother, I was told, during World War I, was a lot of smuggling going on in Europe.\nThat's the only way you were able to make a living. People were traveling from city to city to buy\nmerchandise and bring it in. I understood that my mother and father met during that traveling period\nback and forth. Then they got engaged around the time, I think it was either 1920 or 1921. Why not?\n[Female voice: \"You were born on--\"| They got engaged that doesn't mean they got married!\n[Female voice: \"They were so young.\"| It doesn't mean a thing. In those days they believed in the\nJewish tradition, you're supposed to get married at the age of eighteen, a girl anyway.",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "Your mother was married at age 18?\nI assume she was, at 18, yes.\nYou were the first child?\nI was the firstborn. Of course, in those days, I was born in 1927 so maybe they got married in 1926,\nI am not sure.\nThat was a longer engagement than---?\nYes, in those days, was long engagement.\nBoth families, would you say both families were religious families?\nVery religious families. As a matter of fact, the grandfather I'm named after; he was a rabbi. He was\na teacher in the town. I was named after him.\nThe grandfather on your father's side or your mother's side?\nMy mother's side.\nYour mother's father was a rabbi and you were named after him.\nMy father's father, he was a merchant. He was actually, what you call, in the dairy business. He was\nbuying cheese, eggs, all sorts of dairy products. He was doing business with bigger cities. That was\nhis profession.\nWhat kind of schooling did your parents have?",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "My parents had mostly Hebrew education, no Polish education. At that time, when they were born,\nJewish people were not allowed to get educated under the Russians.\nThey were born under Russian rule?\nUnder Russian rule, right. I think I was the first generation that was able to get a Polish education.\nBoth of your parents had attended Jewish schools?\nOnly Jewish, hidden.\nHidden.\nWasn't an open school, was a hidden school in the Sellis(ph)(c.089) where this book is all written all\nabout.\nWhat languages did your parents speak?\nYiddish.\nAt home?\nAt home, Yiddish was spoken primarily. The only language I was able to speak Polish was when I\nattended school. But among my friends, if I came along my Jewish friends, we spoke Yiddish. The\ngentile friends, Polish.\nYou were bilingual? Yiddish and Polish.\nYiddish and Polish, yes. And also Hebrew.",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "And Hebrew. Your father also knew Russian?\nYes, because he was born under the Russian system, so he spoke Russian, Polish and Yiddish.\nWhat kind of school did you attend?\nI started the schooling at the age of seven which was 1935. I went to school until the age of, let's see,\n1939 the war broke out, five years. Five years of schooling I had in Polish. But in Yiddish I had\nmore than that. My Polish schooling stopped when the war broke out. The law came through, no\nJewish child is allowed to go to school.\nSeptember, 1939, you did not go back to school?\nThat was the end of it. The day the Germans came in, I remember it like today is Sunday. I was in\nthe middle of the street and finally, we could hear shooting coming into the city. Houses were burning,\neverybody was petrified. Everybody was running back and forth; they didn't know what to do with\nthemselves. People were screaming, what's happening? what's going on? The Germans had come.\nWell, it was about 10, 11 o'clock in the morning, September 1, 1939, the German patrol entered the\ncity. They were all full of dust. I remember there were two jeeps, two motorcycles and a truck. The\nGerman officers came in with machine guns and the first thing you could hear is handt holdt\n(ph)(c.115), raise your hands. We all stood still, we didn't move. We raised our hands. I was trying\ndesperately to get to my parents' house, to the store so they could be warned what's happening, where\nI was. But I couldn't. I ran across the street to the other side. Meantime, the Germans surrounded\nthe whole circle. The town had a circle, a square. Machines guns pointing to each like towards the\nhouses. I figured this way, if I run to the back of the city, all around the circle, I'll be able to reach\nmy home. That's exactly what I did. But my parents didn't know that I was in the house. They were\nlooking for me, because I was in one area and they were in another area. In the meantime, the\nGermans went from house to house and get everybody out into the circle. We didn't know what the\nconsequences were going to be but we felt, we don't have a choice. There's nowhere to hide, there's\nnowhere to run. The war is on, shooting was going on like crazy. The Polish army was around they\nhad no place where to put them anymore. They came in with horses, the infantry came in. There was\nno artillery, they had no artillery. The Polish army had a very poor artillery, about six horses pulling\none anti-aircraft ,(c. 131) okay. one anti-aircraft was pulled by six horses. That's the strength.\nI mean they were good military personnel, no question about it, but they had nothing to fight against\narmored. The Germans were well-armed. In the meantime, more German trucks started to come into\nthe city. They felt the city safe, they will come in. Every house was entered, they entered the house\nand emptied it. Everybody out in the middle of the street. When it came to my house, where I was",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "living, the Germans came in; so we all raised our hands. They says, march out. So we marched out\nand my parents saw me. My mother says, where were you?. I says, I run home when I saw the\nGerman trucks coming 1n, I got panic and I run to the other side of the street and then I run home. Of\ncourse, what are you going to do in a situation like that? You don't have parents, yet. They got very\npanicky too, looking for me. We stood out there in the square for about 45 hours. Then they told the\nwomen and the children may go back to their homes. Either they were holding us as hostages 1n case\nthey find maybe the Polish army resisting, whatever the situation was, I don't understand it. I don't\nknow. All I know is that after a period of time, they let the women go back to their homes with the\nchildren and then later on, the men were allowed to go home. This was the first experience with --.\nThis was the first day?\nThe first day, I have it written out in a book in the house in Yiddish. Everything in Yiddish but that\nparticular day took place.\nThis was on the first of September?\nOn the first day when the Germans came in.\nAs far as you can tell, there was no real Polish resistance?\nHow could they resist? They had nothing to resist with. You can't take an infantry fight mechanic.\nThey came with heavy tanks and trucks and airplanes. The first thing that came in, airplanes that start\nsoftening up the area there. Where we lived, around this area there, in one particular place is called\nMerrick (ph)(c.157), where they had ammunition factory, was the first place they catch. On the other\nside of the Vistula was a factory. We could see that they were so powerful and so strong, we have no\nway of defeating them. Still and all, the Polish army held out a long time, held out three weeks.\nYour town was not bombed?\nIt was bombed in one area there which was (c.163) anything of value. Just dropped a bomb\nmaybe to scare people. That's about it. Nothing of value. There was no particular bridges that had\nvalue, they had roads and everything. The bomb didn't do any particular harm at all whatsoever.",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "Were you frightened?\nOf course I was frightened! Who wouldn't be frightened when you see, first of all, we knew the\natrocities that happened in Germany in 1938; what happened in Austria. Because a lot of those Jewish\npeople from those countries were pushed back to Poland. Anyone who was Polish born, lived in\nGermany, had to leave Germany, go back to Poland. Those people came in to our town, we had to\nallocate them. We had to give them food; we had to give them lodging. This was a must. They told\nus the atrocities, what happened in those areas where they lived. Of course you get frightened.\nDid you recall any specific stories that they told about German?\nYes, they said that they used to come in their houses at night, to take out the women, rape the women.\nThey used to take out the men, cut their beards off, put them to work or drag them alongside, hooked\nthem up to a truck and drag them alongside the streets. I mean they told stories that you were\nshivering. As a youngster, which I was, my ears were always open to hear, to know what was going\non, to see what Ican do. You cannot rely 100% on the city, or the people, or your own parents. You\nare on your own when something like that happens.\nDid you know any of the refugees, personally?\nNo. There were no relatives of ours, was total strange people. Each family that entered the city were\nassigned to a certain family. You have to give them breakfast, you give them lunch, you give them\nsupper. All were welcome.\nWas anyone assigned to your household?\nYes, we had three families who were assigned to us. Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays, they\nwould come to our house for breakfast. The other family were assigned Thursday, Friday and\nSaturday for lunch. Then they keep changing around. Every family cooperated as much as they\npossibly could. My mother became the breadwinner when the war broke out. She was blond, she\nlooked like a Polish woman. She put on a babushka, like a kerchief, a disguise. She used to go into\nthe towns called Townocheck(ph)(c.190) which is across the Vistula, six kilometers from my town.\nShe used to purchase the merchandise which was necessary for the house. By horse and buggy, the\nstuff would be brought back into the city. I used to wait for her as a youngster. When she crossed\nover the Hampton(ph)(c.200) bridge, the Germans built across the Vistula; when I saw my mother, I\nwas delighted to see her. Of course, who wouldn't? She used to make those trips twice a week.",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "All by herself?\nAll by herself because the disguise that she was able to go through. They didn't know she was Jewish,\nthey let her cross over the bridge. On the other side of the bridge, as soon as she came off, I sort of\napproached to her and helped her. If she had to carry something, I helped her carry.\nWhat was your father doing during the months after the occupation?\nDuring the months of the occupation, he had to stay in the store. He couldn't go anyplace. He had to\ncut off his beard.\nHe cut it himself or--?\nSure, he had to. There was a rule, right away. You had to cut off. Between 1939, the Germans came\nin, to 1940, September, was a couple of months, the rules were laid as follows: They had a curfew\nfrom six in the evening to six in the morning, nobody's allowed to go out unless you had a specific\npermission from the German headquarters. Otherwise you go out, you're shot. The German patrol\nwas marching up and down from the top of the city to the end of the city. They had six patrolmen.\nNot even youngsters were allowed to go out. The store had to be closed at 5:30, no business will",
        "(c.218). We were fortunate that in the back of each store, where families lived, we had a\ntremendous yard. We all got together in the evening in the back of the yard and we discussed this.\nWe consoled each other. We knew the consequences, what's happening, what's going on, but what\ncan you do? We were in a situation where you have to do whatever time allows. In 1940, the\nbeginning of 1940, Poland was very fortunate when the winter came along, lots of snow, lots of snow.\nAn order came through from headquarters, everybody at the age of 12 and every man the age of 60\nhad to assign themselves to work. We all had to sign our names. Every day, I had to go out on the\nhighways and shovel snow so that the German armor can go freely about. We got paid for that, not\nmuch, but we got paid for this. As the days and the months went by, we sort of got accustomed to the\nidea. This is part of life, this is the way we're going to grow up, what else can I do? Right through\nthe 1940's, being it was a small town, the Germans demanded that the town should establish a\nheadquarters, Jewish men and women. They called it a geminda(ph)(c.239), what you call it here is\na city hall, a city hall. In German, it's a geminda (c.231). They took the top notch men from the town\nand they formed a committee. What was the purpose of the committee? If the Germans needed\nsomething, assume they needed some boots for the German officer, they would come to the committee\nand says, I would like you to supply us within two or three weeks, three hundred pair of boots. They\ngave us the sizes and everything. Of course, the committe paid for them. They needed a certain\namount of people to go and clean the headquarters of the German camp. The committee had to assign",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "a certain amount of people to go there and do the work. This was the purpose of the geminda.\nWhatever they demanded, they didn't go to individual people, they went to the committee. The\ncommittee, more or less, had an idea who has money, who didn't have any money. Believe me, they\nhad to really drag out money from the people. Who wanted to part with money? You work all your\nlife, it's a poor town, this wasn't a rich town, it was a poor town. This was the main purpose of the\ngeminda. The people they call the Yudenrach (ph)(c.250). Yudenrach is a committee who decides,\nwho makes decisions. My father's brother, he was older than my father, he was a member of that\nYudenrach. Every time when my father had a chance to talk to him, he says it's no good, it's no good.\nWhat's the matter?, my father asked him. He says, they're demanding so many things from us. We\ndon't know where to get it from. We don't know where to get it from. They demanded housing for\ntheir officers, demanded shoes, demanded clothing, demanded food, whatever they were able to get,\nwhatever their mind was working on, they came to you, give me, give me and give me. There's a\nlimit to everything, right? This was in 1940 right through that. Everybody from the city had to go to\nwork for the Germans, everybody. Except once a week, thank G__ for that day, on Thursday, which\nwas market day, they allowed the gentile people to come into the city and bring in some merchandise,\nrice, corn wheat, flour, chicken, eggs and we sort of exchanged it to survive. It was very difficult.\nBread was scarce, there was a ration of bread, sugar and flour. People started to become penniless,\nhate one another, because when you feel in your heart, you're hungry, your liberty is being taken away\nfrom you, you sort of become an animal. You hate people because--for no reason whatsoever. But\nit's there, the hate is there. You shouldn't hate one another because we're all in the same boat but\nnature works tricks on you. Because he comes over and demands from you things, you have to give\nit to them. Then you say to me, why do you come to me, why don't you go to them? You understand?\nThat's how we create a war. That's their policy was. This was their idea, to create a revolution among\none another. They would gain by that. In the beginning of 1942, new rules and regulations came\nforth.\nFrom 1940 to '42,the situation was--?\nThe situation was stable. You were able to get whatever you want and supplied with rationed food\nand all that. Nothing was restricted except six o'clock in the evening, six o'clock in the morning.\nHow about wearing armbands or badges?\nThis came in 1942.\nNo schools?",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "No schools, then.\nYour brother and sister are really not doing anything?\nNothing, whatsoever. Except at home, we were able to read ourselves books and teach ourselves.\nThen we had a private tutor coming to the house, in secret. He was able to teach us. Then the rules\ncame through, every Jew, the age of twelve, men and women had to wear armband with the Star of\nDavid on the left arm. Everybody had to put it on, there was no way out.\nWhat date, do you remember what date this was?\nIt was approximately February, I think, 1942. Then we start reading in the papers that they forming\nghettos. Mortch (ph)(c.307), Cracow, the main cities of Poland. Then they started to restrict in our\ntown, how far you can travel. We only had a limited amount of area which you could go, no further.\nThat's the end of it. You go any further, you're shot, no questions. People from the villages, from the\nsurrounding towns, were pushed into our town.\nThey had to be Jews?\nRight. They had to leave the village, all their belongings. If they were able to sell it, fine. If not, you\nhad to give it over to your neighbor and come into our town. How much can a town like us absorb?\nWe were population of Jewish people, 150 families. The total population of our town including the\ngentiles were together over 500 families. When they started to bring in people from the villages, and\nincluding we have people already refugees from Austria, from Germany, our town was choking. We\ncouldn't move around any more, food was scarce. It was very bad. 1942 was here and we knew\nthings were happening already in Poland. Elimination of people, sending them out, pushing them to\nwork. Then one day, it was in June, my father's brother came over to my father and said,--.\nThis is the one who works 1n the council?\nThat's right. He says, it doesn't look good. They demanding a (c.336) amount of people to be\nsent to a labor camp, to work for the Germans. It doesn't look good. He said to my father, I would\nsuggest you let your son, Zalek, go to work on the highways. Wherever they have a group of people\nwork on the highways, once you were there, you were safe. During the day, trucks will arrive and\npick up the amount of people that we have joined tonight. Who do you take?, the newcomers, right?",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "People who influxed into our town from different towns so the first ones you take is them. You put\nthem into a holding place until the Germans came with the trucks. They arrived approximately nine,\nten o'clock in the morning. We were already on the highways working. Telephones in those days\nwas very scarce. There wasn't like in here; you pick up a telephone and make a telephone call.\nYour parents didn't have a telephone?\nWe didn't have a telephone. We didn't have electricity either. I went to work with another hundred\nfellows on the highways. Our duty on the highways was to pick up the gravel, straighten out the\nhighway, whatever it was damaged down on there, we did the work.\nThese are all Jewish guys?\nAll Jewish people. When the trucks arrived, we received a telephone call from the post office. The\npost office sent a telephone call to the village where we worked telling them, they are coming to get\nus. This man who received the telephone call panicked and disappeared. He took off! We didn't\nknow what was going on. Later on, I found out that one guy who was captured at night and held in a\npen until the Germans come, came forward. He says if you want more people, you go to this and this\nhighway and you'll find plenty of them. Then the trucks came out to the highways and where you\ngoing to go? No place where to go because it's also out of limits. About a hundred of us surrendered.\nThey took us on the trucks and brought us into the town. We came into the town. Was my parents\nwaiting, start to carry on, got hysterical. Says, what do you want me to do? Believe me, this is the\nhonest truth. I'll never forget it, the rest of my life. I was sitting in the truck, numb. Didn't know\nwhat was going on, didn't know what's happening, just sat there and stared at my mother. They could\nhave taken her too; they could have taken my father too and shoved him in the truck. She was brave\nenough to come forward. She says, he's a young boy. He's not a healthy boy. Can I take him off the\ntruck and go home? The German turned around and said to her, he's a good boy, he's a strong boy.\nWe'll make him stronger. He can work for us. Those were the words he said. I listen. What I wore\nwas a shirt, a pair of pants, short pants; 1t was the clothing of youngsters and a pair of shoes. Within\nthe hour, my mother and father stood there. My brother I didn't see any more, my sister, I didn't see\nany more.\nThey were home?\nThey were home, hidden.",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "Why were they hidden?\nThey were afraid they might have taken them too!\nEven the very young--?\nThey didn't care, they need people, able people. They're not going to take somebody that's 60 years\nof age or 50 years of age. In those days, a 50-year old man looked like 80. My father says goodbye,\nmy mother says goodbye to me. I was able to go down to hug her and go back into the truck. A\nhundred and five of us, in my hometown, were taken to (c.404). This was my first\nexperience riding in a truck for three and a half hours. When we got into the town of",
        "(c.407), the Jewish committee provided us with a bath. The first thing I do is take a bath.\nWe had to be disinfected--\nDeloused.\nDeloused, right. That's what they called it, deloused. Disinfected and I didn't know I had a belt on.\nI left the belt in my clothing. The belt came back, it was only (c.414) falling apart. I had to\nuse a cord to hold my pants up. I lost a lot of weight because I didn't eat all day. About midnight, it\nwas later than midnight, I don't know what time it was already, I was so exhausted and dumbfounded\nand sort of disgusted. Believe me, if somebody would come with an ax and hit my hand, I wouldn't\nfeel it. At that age, at that age!\nYou were what, \u2014_?\nFifteen.\nThis was June. This would have been around the time of your birthday.\nThat's right, yes.\nDo you remember the date? Was it just before--?",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "June 15th.\nJust before your birthday.\nThat's right.\nThat's the day you were rounded up and taken to (c.424)?\nRight, right.\nYour parents were left alone. They were not taken?\nThank G __, they were not taken. They could have been taken from us.\nThey were young?\nThat's right. They could have been taken too. But they needed a certain amount of people. This was\nthe typical German. If they say to you I need ten, I don't want eleven. Ten is enough for me, that's\nall I want. If you give them eleven, twelve, I don't want it. I want ten only. We left the town of\nSkarzysko into their camp. We arrived at night, it was dark. It was a tremendous building, I don't\nknow what that building was consist of. All it was inside of there was hay and straw. They let us out",
        "(c.407) inside. Six o'clock in the morning woke us up. Experience in the camp.\nEverybody out. Lined up, counted everybody. We were so valuable, we more valuable than gold.\nG__ forbid if one person is missing, we stood there for hours until they found them, either dead or\nalive. That's the typical German system. Everybody had to be accounted for. After they counted us,\nthey gave us black coffee and a piece of bread. They marched us to the German headquarters which\nwas in the factory already. In there we stood 1n the line, to be fingerprinted, to be given ID cards and\npictures. Everyone of us had an ID card with a picture on it. It took forever. By the time the last\nperson got through, was three o'clock in the afternoon. We stood there and waited, what's going to\nhappen. The night shift begun six o'clock in the evening. They took us to the factory, introducing us\nto the factory. I had never seen a factory in my life; I'd never seen a machine in my life; I don't know\nwhat it's all about. They start giving us the first meal for the evening. It consist of cabbage and horse\nmeat. I didn't know it was horse meat. I was told later on, it was horse meat. Do I have a choice?\nThere's nothing else to eat, I'm hungry. After we finish eating, six o'clock arrived, inside. We went,\neach lined up in the factory. The assignments were different machine. I was assigned to a machine",

        "that was making the pins that ignites the bullet. When you press the pin, they can hit it and shoot out.\nIt was a tiny, little thing; the machine was a very fast machine. The Polish supervisor took a liking to\nme. It was very fortunate, he liked me. Vilak (ph)(c.479), he called me, Vilak. He says to me, this\nis the way you operate this here, this is the way you release it. Remember the electricity. Talk to me,\nelectricity! What do I know about electricity? I light candles, lamps and kerosene, okay? This 1s\nelectricity. He says, you put the switch on and the machine runs. You run the wheel like this here\nand bring it over and you see that the pin becomes thin. Then you have a tester over here. You put\non the tester, you see that the pin fits. If the pin fits, you continue, if it doesn't, call me over. I says\nto myself, okay, I guess this is what Ihave to do. I sat there on the machine, on a high chair, diligently,\ndoing my job so fast. My fingers were bleeding, but I (c.494), my hands touched the machine.\nIt was the spinning of the wheel. The wheel had also a stone, a sharp stone. Every time I hit it, my\nhands was brushing off. I didn't know what to do. What can Ido? Who am I going to ask? I might\nas well continue and learn the hard way until I learn what's going on. Well, it didn't take me long, I\nlearned the procedure. I mastered it so beautifully that every time the German officer passed by, he\nsays beautiful, beautiful. Thank you. I sat there but I didn't realize the hours that went there, twelve\nhours.\nNight shift.\nNight shift. This is the worst. I didn't sleep during the day. From six in the evening till six o'clock\nin the morning. In the meantime, when we got back to the camp, the other shift came back in. Then\nwe saw more Jewish people arriving with trucks in different towns. Oh, how long you been here?\nSince yesterday. When you longer been here? Three days ago. We actually were the ones who\nopened up this particular camp. This Skarzysko camp.\nSo you were the first--?\nThe first group to be there. After a couple of days, we sort of get acclimated. Right away, as a\nyoungster, I accepted the fact that this is going to be my lifestyle. For how long, I don't know. As a\nhuman being, I have to accept the fact, that this is going to be my lifestyle. I have no choice. I have\nto do the best I can if I want to survive. I wanted it so desperately. In the meantime, during the period\nof time as you work in the factory, some of my landsleit (c.29), landsmen, acquainted themselves with\ngentile people. This man who was supervisor said to them, I make a deal with you; you take letters\nhome from us, to my hometown. They'll pay you well and bring us news from my home through the\ntown. This was fair enough. G__ forbid, if this man is caught, no trial. The answer was hanging.\nSo the Pole could be hanged if he 1s caught carrying letters?",

        "If he is caught carrying letters or anything that didn't look---. Everybody was searched coming out\nfrom the gates. It was fortunate that he wasn't caught, very fortunate. Many times that I have seen\nwith my own eyes, that this gentile man was caught carrying things for people in the factory. Not\nbringing it in, taking it out. You see that's when they catch you, when you go out from the factory.\nVery strict. Who were the searchers? Ukrainian soldiers, they were miserable. They were miserable.\nThey beat you up for no reason whatsoever, for no reason, they beat you.\nThey beat up Jews and Poles?\nAnd Poles. They didn't care. They didn't discriminate. They didn't like the Poles to begin with.\nDid they wear German uniforms, these Ukrainian soldiers?\nYes, they wore German uniforms with old-fashioned rifles. Very large ones, World War I rifles.\nRussians' old rifles?\nRight, exactly. That's the type of weapons they carried. But they wore German uniforms. They\nspoke German and Ukrainian, both languages. When they called this man, they always had to bring\nthe people to see the result of the consequences. They made a circle, go around it, called this man\nout, tied his hand, put him in the tree, nothing. They teach everyone a lesson not to do it. As I said,\nwe were very fortunate, we send this man home every Saturday and he brought news for us on\nMonday morning when he came back from Koprzeunitz.\nWas he from your hometown?\nNo. We gave him directions how to go, paid him well for it. He was very nonchalant. Was he going\nto make it, obvious. In the meantime, they were building already barracks for us. As the population\nin the camp was growing, they needed more space. They used army barracks. Each barrack was built\nwith two bunks and a belly stove in the center, in case it gets cold. A number of the barracks. Each\nbarracks was holding approximately, I would say about 50 to 60 people.\nWho was doing the building?",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "They had people from the camp.\nInmates.\nInmates. Everything was done by the inmates. In the meantime, every day when I went to the factory,\nI felt good. I lived another day. This was my thinking. I survived another day. When I came to the\nfactory, I was more at ease than I was in the camp. This was still in 1942. I finished this project, I\nwas transferred to a different machine. The machine was called a automatic driari (ph)(c.805), they\ncall it in German. It made stutchrigen (ph)(c.605). Stuchrigen is a cover of the 50-caliber bullets.\nThe 50-caliber bullet consist of three parts. I made one of them. Each tray, had on my machine. On\nmy machine, I had two trays which d (c.618) Each piece approximately had to be tested to make\nsurethat the groving inside 1s properly. I was more concerned thqn they were bcause they could find\nout that I'm doing damages. This was my project. I make sure the circle's good. If it didn't work\ngood, I call over the supervisor to adjust it. Many times the machine broke down, which happens.\nBy the way, the factory that I was working was called Hasak (ph)(c.621). Hasak was a German\ncompany, originally in Germany way back in Germany. They had a few munition factories located\nin Poland. One was in Skarzysko Kamienna, the other one was in Czestochowa.\nThey took over Polish buildings, had Polish supervisors, but the ownership was German now\u2019?\nGerman, right.\nThe guards were Ukrainian?\nUkrainian.\nThe Germans controlled it?\nRight.\nThe German officers, were they Wermacht or were they SS?",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "Wermacht, wermacht. They lived around the territory of the ammunition factory. They drove away\nthe Polaks, they wouldn't let them live around that area, they settled themselves down.\nAll the workers were Jewish?\nAll the workers were Jewish, except the supervisors.\nWho were Poles?\nWho were Poles. Between June and August, we all got paid for our work. We got 80 zlotys a week.\nEighty zlotys a week, I don't know how much it was that time in dollars but we all got paid. Our food\nsupply wasn't bad either. They allowed to come in from Skarzysko, a truck with bread and we were\nable to purchase it. The nicest part was also we could get permission from the headquarters, inside\nthe camp, to send out, let's see, a group of two or three men, to go near the store which was located in\nthe vicinity. You could buy butter, could buy milk, all the little commodities because we had the\nmoney. There was no restrictions at that time. The camp consisted of, at that time already,\napproximately between four and five hundred inmates already. Because they kept bringing them in\neach day until the factory had built up the camp. So the camp wasn't too far away from the factory.\nI would say was about two kilometers from the factory so we marched every day. After they finished\nbuilding the camp, this building was closed. We went over there. In the meantime, they expected, I\nassume, more inmates to be brought in. They build it where this tremendous building was all the way\nin the back, another tremendous camp for about 10,000 inmates.\nWere you still wearing your shorts?\nYes\nThe same clothes that you had on in June?\nThe same clothes but what I did. Every evening when I come home from work, I was able to get\nmyself from the warehouse, they had a warehouse over there, get me a change of clothes. They gave\nme the first long pair of pants and some kind of button shirt that I had on and the rest I was able to\nwash myself. I took home some soap and a piece of paper to put in my pocket and I washed it outside.\nWe had a big washing rack like water__(c.655) and I was able to wash my laundry. What else could\nI do?

Believe me, I have no intention to leave, I have no intention to run.\nAnyone who would run away at night and thought they not going to be caught, I have bad news for\nthem. They were caught. They were brought back into camp. Make a circle of us, put them in the\ncenter. Boom, boom and that's the end of it. They shot so many of them. You think somebody would\nlearn a lesson. There was no place to go. In 1942, there were already ghettos formed all over Europe.\nThere was no more Jewish people in small towns. Everybody has been evacuated, either to ghettos\nor send away someplace else. In September, 1942, we sent home this gentile to our hometown. It\nwas on a Saturday. He arrived in town, and he saw the whole Jewish community in the center of the\ncity with packages, belongings, leaving town. Those who were sick, those who couldn't move, those\nwho resisted, were shot. The ones who carried out all these atrocities were not the\nGermans. Ukrainians. They're the ones who did this. I mean they were (c.69), but they were\ndelighted to do it. We all know about that.\nYour employment now? This is your supervisor, the one who keeps coming and going with\nmessages?\nRight, nght. When he came back, he came back to me and he said, sorry I have to tell you this sad\nstory. When I came into town, everybody was already packed in the city.\nThis was in September--?\nSeptember, oh no, it was either before the Jewish holidays or after the Jewish holidays, I'm not sure.\nI know it was in September.\nAround the time of Rosh Hashonah?\nRosh Hashonah, right.

They work\nthe same system in Auschwitz. If you were assigned to the group of people to burn them or to take\nthem out and push them in the gas oven, you were next. There would be no sign, no witnesses. This\nwas their system. A few were able to escape through the woods and able to come into our camp, to a\ndifferent town, where a town was evacuated that particular day. They sort of dragged themselves\nalong. When they came into our camp, a newcomer you could tell immediately. When they came in,\nI says, what's happening, what's going on? He says, Koprzewnitz was annihilated. Evacuated on\nSaturday, so many people were shot, so many people were killed, I didn't even want to ask who\nsurvived, who was killed, or what. I don't know. Right there and then, my whole life went like this,\nshut off from the world. My mother, my father, my brother, my sister, my aunt, my uncles, large\nfamilies. Everything was cut off from this world for me. I'm all by myself. Nothing to look forward\nto. It's a dark world coming. The future looks very bleak but I am not going to give up. I'm here to\nfight it, I want to see the end of this war. I don't care how long it's going to take. I had a tremendous\ndetermination, you have no idea. As young as I was, I never gave up. I never volunteered, I did my\nwork the way it should be. I don't care if anybody would criticize me, the way I worked, diligently.\nI had to do it in order to see the end of the war. I received the last letter from my parents. It says, my\nfather wrote, we don't know where we're going but we know we want you to survive. We _(c.714)\nYour father knew that he was going to be deported somewhere?",
        "Somewhere. He knew at least you will survive. I was going to survive. I was just in the same\npredicament as he was. My life was more valuable than his was? All right, so I was working over\nhere. What happened if I get sick? I cannot work. They going to send me to a hospital, treat me?\nThere was no such a thing. They had an infirmary for people in their hospital over there. As long as\nyou were able to stay there once a week, a truck will come, pick out the people from the hospital, take\nthem away. That's the end of them. If you're sick, you don't need it. As long as you are able to walk,\nable to work, you were valuable to those people. The Germans didn't care because there was no\nproblem of people. They could bring in more and more and more people to replace you. You had to\nbe alert, (c.726) Every week, once a week, either it was on a Wednesday or Thursday, the\ntruck would come, clean out the hospital, send the people away. That's the end of those people. One\nday, it didn't miss me either, I had typhoid. I was very sick, I run a high fever. I was in the infirmary.\nYou can't go to work, you got to go to the infirmary. I said to my friend, very close friend of mine,\nhe says to me, let me know when the truck is coming. Somehow, he was able to find out when the\ntruck was coming. He came in a day earlier to me, he says get the hell out of here, go to the bathhouse.\nOnce you got out from the infirmary, we were able to go to the bathhouse to wash up. I dragged\nmyself out to walk, my legs and my hands, crawled, hold on to my friend. Together, we walked to\nthe bathhouse. It wasn't far away. I sat there in the water. The water kept pouring on me like crazy.",

        "I says, I have to get better. I can't go on like this. Somehow, a miracle happened. I came out from\nthe bathhouse, all cured. I never had to go back into the hospital. I went right back to my barracks.\nA few day, I lined myself up to go to work. My machine was empty while I wasn't there. How long\ndo you think they going to keep the machine open? I came into work; my supervisor was awful nice\nto me. He says to me, Vilak, how do you feel? What can I tell you?, I says. I could eat something,\nI'll have something to eat. So he brought me over a piece of bread. I was very grateful. My strength\ncame a little bit stronger each day. There was nothing to look forward to except every single day the\nsame thing. Seven days a week. Twelve hours a day, labor, labor and more labor. The end of '42,\nwe had already in the camp, close to ten thousand people. Skarzysko Kamienna with ten thousand.\nThere were three departments. Verk ah (ph) (c.754), verk bay (ph) and verk tzen (ph). That's what\nthey called them, departments. Verk ah (ph) which I was in, did mostly ammunition work, bullets\nfor 50-calibers and what you call those heavy ammunition for anti-aircraft. They worked on levels,\nvery hard working by the way. In verk beh, they mostly make these bombs, was a big factory, they\nmade bombs. Verk teh, everyone who worked over there was yellow from the powder that they used\nto pour in into the ammunition. Was a liquid powder, I worked on it later on. You couldn't help\nworking it because you had no protection, your face was open. The stuff grew on you. When you\nsaw these people, looked at them, says where you come from, outer space? Completely yellow. They\ncame once a week, to the bathhouse, to take a bath. Their clothing was taken away from them to be\ncleaned out and all that stuff and you take a bath. The yellow, that stuff doesn't come out so easily.\nThere were three departments and that's Skarzysko area. People were dying like flies. Every single\nday the truck would leave and there were people taken out from the barracks. Boxes outside, near the\ncamp they had it, boxes lying around, just dump them in there until the middle of the day. Then they\ntake them out and must bury them. Then immigration stopped, all the ghettos, I understand, I don't\nwhat's happening, I don't know what is going on but I could listen to the radio. At twelve o'clock, the\nGerman radio would give announcement about the war in Polish. It says everything is great, the\nGermans are winning, the Germans are making progress. They are beating the hell out of the Russians\nand all this. Use your own imagination. All I know is one thing that the Germans are working 24\nhours a day making ammunition like crazy. People are dying like flies for lack of food. Our daily\nration consist of, in the morning, a cup of black coffee. You used to get up at 5 o'clock in the morning\nbecause 6 o'clock we had to be in the factory. At lunchtime, at 12 o'clock, you got a cup of soup, you\nwere lucky if the supervisor, the Jewish supervisor gave you the soup; otherwise he give you water.\nWe had a choice with it? We had no choice. This had to be your contentment. In the evening when\nyou came home from work, each barrack had to go to a consumer's place where they brought in all\nthe bread and sometimes a little margarine with jello. Each barrack was assigned a certain amount of\nbread. When they brought 1n the bread into the barracks, for so many people, everybody stood at the\ntable because we assigned one man to be in charge.

You go out into the yard and get yourself\na cup of water. This was your supper. Then you sat in your barrack or you sat outside after dark\nreminiscing in the good olden days. This was your concentration, reminiscing about home, family,\nwhat was prepared for supper, what was prepared for the holidays, what you did at home, what kind\nof business. You talked to each other, you made yourself a little bit homey, make you feel good. We\nall strive for one purpose, we want to survive. We also gave up, that was the end of it. We had a\nmotto written out in every barrack. Hold onto your skin, brother, hold onto yourself. Don't give up.\nIn German or Polish or Yiddish?\nIn Yiddish. Polish and in Yiddish. German?, we don't like German. We had a German supervisor, I\ndon't remember his name. He was a tall, old man. When he came into the camps, whoever he saw\nin front of him, pfft, just like that, like flies. Like a fly, didn't mean anything to him. For what reason?\nI mean this guy just came from 24 hours of work. What'd he shoot him for? I came out from the\nbathhouse in the camp, when I was washing myself, getting myself ready to work. All of a sudden, I\nsee this guy shooting. I took off like the devil! Where I got the energy, I don't know but I run. That\nday, it didn't happen one day, it happened practically every day--whenever he came into camp.\nWhenever he saw a person, boom, just like that. Didn't mean a damn thing. After he retired in 1943,\nwe got in another one, worse than he was. Was an old man, he had a hunchback, he walked around\nwith a dog. He considered a human being as an animal. He says to the dog, he says Mensch, Nem\ndin hundt (ph)(c.831), Man, take this dog. You were the dog, he was the man.\nThe dog was the man?\nThe dog used to grab hold of you, pulled you down, he'll go and get the gun, just like that. There was\nno remorse.

Immediately, no question there. We had Jewish\nsupervisors too, policemen. They just as lousy as the Germans. Whether it was their fault, they had\nto do a thing, so they did it. I don't know. I'm not going to put my self 1n their situation. They had it\ngood. They didn't have to do what they did. Point out that this man tried to run away, this man tried\nto do this here. They pointed fingers which wasn't the proper thing to do. In 1943, December, before\nChristmas, it was very bad. We didn't have much food. They didn't supply anything for us. No work,\nno food. You had one day off, one lousy day off, Christmas. We looked forward to the day we go\nback to work. At least we get something to drink, something to eat. Water, we had plenty, there was\nno question about it. People were swelling from malnutrition. If you were overage, you didn't make\nit. Younger age, you have achance.

He says to him, he's better than youga, gaden, dri sumpn (ph)(c.001), I want you to give\nthis young man three soups a day. I says, oh boy, I did something good, he's going to give me extra\nsoup. You think he gave it to me? He didn't give it to me. [\"Who, the Rottenberg? (ph)\"| Yeah, he\ndidn't give it to me. [\"The relative of...\"] Forget about it. He didn't give it to me. I went over to",

        "him, I said, you stood there by the machine when this German supervisor said to you distinctly, I\nheard you and you heard me; give him extra. Why didn't you give me? Why don't you give it to me?\nGo away. How can I forget these things? It lies in your mind. Food 1s your main object, right through\nthe camp. Food, number one, that's all that was on your mind. Forget about relatives, forget about\nyour parents, forget about your brothers and sisters, forget about your property, education, nothing\nexisted from this world except food. That's the only thing was on your mind. Food, you were hungry!\nYou had worked on empty stomach, you were hungry. As I was saying, I was transferred to this\nammunition factory to move machinery on trains. All the time I see the whole camp from a distance.\nI was this side, they were camped over there. The whole camp was lined up, one line. This German\nofficer, a crippled guy, with the dog, deciding your fate for the day. This way, this way, this way, this\nway. The minute you went to the left, you were right on the truck. You had no mercy to say anything,\nright on the truck. They kept saying, where we're going, he says you're going to another camp.\nEverybody knew what it was. Within two hours, the camp was selected. Those who were on the\ntrucks, a half an hour later, you could have moved the whole selection away. That was the end of\nthose people. The remainder, they brought them into the factory to unhook all the wires. The trains\ncame in, we loaded them up on the trains and they sent us back to camp. As I said, if I was in camp,\nI would have been in the line too. Would be they say left, I would go right. Faith was with me. I had\na strong faith; I knew I had to make it. I wouldn't give up. This was in '44. Enough to be finished\nloading up the freights. They brought in empty cattle wagons and loaded us up.\nLoading you into ....\nInto cattle trains.\nCattle trains, open or closed?\nOpen. There must have been a tremendous train load, either 50 or 60 cars, I didn't count them. Going\naround, I was trying to see how many trains--to me everything was a novelty. I never seen a train in\nmy life. This was the first time I see trains. I see ammunitions, I see factories, I see machinery, I see\nelectricity. I was a youngster, I was growing up. My life here, my youthhood was take away from\nme. I'm learning something which I have no choice to control, which I'm forced to do it, beyond\ncontrol. What else can I say? Once we are aboard the train, they didn't count where we're going, just\nwe go. As long as we stood on the station, we were going crazy. Warm, open train, nothing. We\nhad to go. (c.068) What can you do? You were lying in a cattle train with a hundred\nmen or so. They said we have to go, what are you going to do? Had no choice. We were riding fro\nSkarzysko Kamienna either two or three days, all around to Czestochowa. When we arrived at\nCzestochowa, we recognized the area from history, Matka Boska, the Madonna. Recognize that\nperiod. It was also a coal area there. When we arrived, we saw the same factory, Hasak. The war's\ngoing on over there. This is, let's see, 60 kilometers from the German border. Kratersberg (ph)(c.081)",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "was the first German town from Czestochowa. We got off there, they sent us into the camp. We got\nour first meal in three days. I couldn't walk, I was so weak. I held on to my friend, he held on to me,\nthe two of us went together. We stayed in Czestochowa a couple of days, not too...then line up again.\nWe lined up and in the meantime, the people who lived in there before, they worked in that factory.\nA munition factory same as we had in Skarzysko Kamienna. From there we boarded trains again and\nwe kept riding and riding. For one week, it took us more than a week; we stopped in a place called\nLeipzig. In Leipzig, they took off the women from the train. I think they had a factory there\nsomeplace in Leipzig. They took the women off the train and then they moved to Buchenwald. We\ncontinued to Buchenwald. Buchenwald is located very deep in the woods. Buchenwald, itself, in\nGerman, is forest. When we arrived in Buchenwald, the train stopped, everybody, outsteinen (ph)\n(c.104), off the train. We got off the train, we held on to each other. The first notice we saw, Kasette\nLagen (ph)(c.107). Work makes life sweet. How these skeleton figures on the top of the\ngate when we walked in. We thought that this is the end of us. We start mumbling to each other.\nSays okay, so what can we do? We're here, we don't go any place else, what do you want to do? We\ngo into this big, tremendous ground and they said everybody sit down. We sat down and they took\nfifty people at a time. They march you in the room. In the room there and you don't see them any\nmore. They take another group, and another group and another group. You don't see these people\ncoming out again. We assume that this is the end of us all. We turn around to each other, whoever\nwas remaining here and says, look, wait and see, nice to know you. Maybe we'll see each other in\nHeaven. In the meantime, whatever you have left over in your food, let's share it and eat before we\ndie. Once you get on the other side you don't see anybody anymore. This is the assumption we took.\nWhen you go into a room and nobody comes out again, what do you assume, right? My turn came\nwith 50 others. The first thing when you walk into this big room, all your clothes you take off. Every\nbelonging that you have, you just leave behind. Don't even touch anything. Open your mouth, open\nyour rear, they looked inside to see if you're carrying any gold or silver, jewelry or anything like that.\nI don't have anything. They always yelling, screaming, you know, to make you be afraid. There's\nnothing to hide. Leave everything behind you. That's when I have pictures of my parents, my brother\nand sister. I had to leave everything behind. After we got through the yelling and the screaming, we\ngo into another room. When you come into the other room, you get unlousy. They clean you up.\nBarber standing there with electric machines and clean you up all the way, top to bottom. Then you\ngo into a bathroom and they give you a piece of soap. On the soap, was written down, rif, r-i-f, rein\nyiddish fat (c.154). Pure Jewish fat. That was written down on the piece of soap. We translated that\nway because what else could the rif stand for, okay? We assumed that maybe that's what it means.\nEveryone got a piece of soap. Believe me, the twenty-five people who were with me in the shower\nroom, we looked up there to see whether water's coming down or something else is coming down.\nWe never saw anybody else except our own little group. Once inside, the doors closed. Could be\nonly one thing coming down, either water or gas. Water came. What a relief. Ah, vasser!, what a\nrelief. You know, your mind works on you with such tremendous tricks. You're so confused, you go\naround in circles, why you standing anticipating, what is going to come out of this hole. water or gas?\nEverybody stands there, anticipating, holding each other's hands. I've never before you--the best\nfriends in the world. Everybody held a hand when they stood inside waiting for the water to come.\nThe water finally came, what a relief. We could hear, everybody saying, uhhh, that's the relief 1t was.\nWe took the soap and start washing our hands like this. When we got through, they give you a",

One number you sew up in here,\none number you sew up in your clothes.\nOne number on your chest near your breast pocket and the other on your thigh?\nOn your thigh, yes. This 1s...\nYour number was 68,548.\nRight. That number, I can't forget. This goes with me for the rest of my life. It's embedded in my\nhead. That number, you wrote down it here, they all stamped it already, but you have to sew it on.\nSo later on, you sew it on, one over here, over here. The pajamas you got like, you know, striped\nclothing and you walked out on the other side, then you see the other groups. What a relief. Came\nback to life. This was Buchenwald... They send us into a area with a tremendous camp. They had\nRussians, French, Poles, Yugoslavians, Czechs, they had practically from all European people in that\nparticular camp. G__ knows how many thousands were there. The Russians were treated terribly.\nThey were terribly treated. It was a gas chamber in Buchenwald. They used it in '41','42,'43. They\nstopped using it in '44.\nDo you remember when you arrived there?\nYes. What year it was?\nThe date.\nThe date was July 18.\nNineteen forty-four.\nNineteen forty-four. July 18, 1944 was a hot day very hot, very hot. We were allocated in that\nparticular area. It was called the tent camp. Others had barracks. We had tents.

They they performed over there. He says, from here on, they not going to go\nanyplace with you any more. We pointed them out. They took them out at night and took care of\nthem. The Germans didn't care, as long as they were counted, 500 people, one dead. That doesn't\nmatter. How he died is nobody's business.\nThese were killed?\nYes.\nThe new supervisors killed the old supervisors.\nOh, yes. That was the whole idea. What revenge could I take on this man, what he did in the camp\nand what I saw with my own eyes? What revenge could I take possibly?\nWhich supervisors did they kill? These are the kapos?\nThe kapos, yes. Jewish kapos, policemen. They were policemen, they were dressed up they think\nG_ sent from this world, that they could walk around with a cane in his hand saying, here this is no\ngood this man, get rid of him. What the hell is this here? Why turning people in?\nThe Polish supervisor you talked about before, he's not with you?\nNo. That was the end. Once the camp was evacuated, all the machinery was taken out; the Polish\nworkers stopped. They went back to their homes. That's it. They had no work any more. That was\nthe end of it. They waited for the Russians to come in. If I would have remained in Czestachowa\ntwo extra weeks, I would have been liberated by the Russians. This case, in reverse, I had to suffer\nanother year. We are in Buchenwald.",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "Since July 18th, you're there.\nRight. Buchenwald, we started to go out to work immediately the following day in a quarry. There\nwas a tremendous quarry located in Buchenwald. We picked up stones, loaded them on wagons and\nautomatically the wagons went up the hill all the way to the top and unloaded with trucks, whatever\nthey needed. This was going on, not 24 hours a day, 8 hours a day, which wasn't so bad. Buchenwald,\nwe thought, comparing to the other camps, was sort of a paradise. It didn't have the Ukrainian\nsupervisors, was an SS Kommando there, headquarters who took charge of the whole camp. Each\ncamp was located with an area which was bordered off. You couldn't get in from one camp to the\nother one, with a border guard. You had your own board of supervisors, camp inmates rather. They\nwere gentle. They weren't as brutal as the ones we had in Skarzysko Kamienna, where other camp\ninmates had. This is comparison to the ones I went through. Was already so to speak, much easier.\nI was working there for about two weeks. Then they needed--a new camp opened up in Schleeben\n(ph)(c.41). It's a village in the woods, 60 kilometers from Leipzig and 60 kilometers from Berlin,\nsomething like that. That's what they told us, I don't know. I didn't measure it, that's what they told\nus when we were going there. They lined us up, they says they need, 500 people. Okay, so loaded\nup train load of 500 people, with guards and they send us to Schleeben (c.46). We arrive at the station\nin Schleeben. We marched for two miles into the camp.\nYou went by train?\nBy train, yes.\nOpen cars?\nYes, open cars. When we arrived to Schleeben, they unloaded the train, counted the people again.\nYou see how important we were? Never stopped counting. Morning, noon and night, they counted\nus. We arrived at Schleeben into the camp. Barracks were existed over there already. They had\nbarracks all around, had a kitchen. They lined us up and they assigned each group to a barrack. I was\nassigned to barrack number 20 with another 35 men. They told us that tonight we're going to stay\nhere, tomorrow morning we start arbeiten, work. The factory from the camp was approximately\nbetween two and two and a half kilometers which was very deep into the woods. The factories consist\nof mostly anti-tank grenades. They call them in German, panzer faus (ph)(c.58). Was an oblong\nshape, a head with a long pipe. I think the Americans...\nLike the bazooka.",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "The bazooka, exactly. Just like a bazooka. I was assigned to a factory where we poured the liquid\ninto the head of the anti-tank grenade. The person sat downstairs, we have to turn about and let it\npour in one after the other. Then you put it in the water, standing in the water so you can cool off. In\nthe other side, transport begin the powder in sacks. That's where the people got yellow, from that\npowder. I was fortunate, I wasn't working inside; I got some of it, I still have it, I have a mark on me,\nthat powder. I was on the outside but I used to bring in the sack, hand it over to the man upstairs. He\nhad to pour in, into a kettle, was an aluminum two kettles, aluminum, a certain amount of this type of\ningredients, a certain amount of that ingredients. It goes into a certain degree of temperature before\nyou're able to release it into those heads. Once you go into the heads, you line it up. Then you have\nanother group of people picking it up, putting it further, cleaning it, grinding it off and everything.\nThere were seven factories. Each factory had a different department of jobs to do. There was one\nfactory over there where they bored a hole in the head, where they could put in the pin. The pipe and\nthe pin went together. Once you put this compartment--in other words, if you put the pipe and the\npin together and twist it in together, you put it on your shoulder, you're able to fire 1t. Each bomb that\nwas produced, your number went on it. Understand? That's why sabotage was prevented. It was no\nincidents while we were working there. Then there was transportation. Transport people had to\nunload and load this ammunition. They worked very hard, very very hard. Everything was heavy,\nwith me, I was a youngster, I could squeeze myself in with somebody else. I was very fortunate. I\nworked on the outside bringing in the sacks with the powder, hand it over to the other man upstairs.\nHe in return, had to pour it into kettles, aluminum kettles, constantly under the supervision of a\nGerman officer, constantly. Your eyes never went off of him. The work was from 6 in the morning\nto 6 in the evening, 12 hours a day, 24 hours a day. I worked in this factory, everything was fine. We\ncame home in the barracks 1n the evening. We got our ration, like every place else. A quarter pound\nof bread, a little margarine and a cup of water, that was your supper. Each day was the same there. I\ndon't remember exactly, it was in November, October, 1944; it was on a Sunday. I worked the day\nshift, 6 in the morning, 6 at night, I went home. By the way, Germany, there was no changing shifts.\nOnly on Sunday, change of shifts. Czestochowa, you worked from 6 to 12, you go home and come\nback at 6. You work the night shift. In Germany, you worked from 6 in the evening to 12, then you\nchange the shift the following day. I went home that evening with my friend when all of a sudden, it\nwas two o'clock in the morning, or three o'clock in the morning, hear a tremendous blow out. Like a\nbomb would fall right in front of your nose. It shattered all the windows. I got hit with the glass in\nthe forehead. There was bleeding. I didn't know what happened. I run under the table, start to hide.\nEverybody run out of their beds because you couldn't run anyplace else. You look out the window,\nfacing the factories, you could see blowups and blowups, one after the other. Explosions going like\ncrazy. You couldn't imagine, right away you knew it was the factory. What was the first thing that\ncame into your mind? Your friends are working the night shift is killed. That's the first thing that\ncame into your mind. The Germans were afraid that something is going to happen here because the\nexplosion 1s so terrible. They took us all out from the camp. They pushed us into a field, away from\nthe camp. They needed help to dig ditches so the fire wouldn't spread. They came around and they\ngrabbed whoever is able to walk. Whoever was able to crawl, he gave them shovels. There was a\nvery small fire department, a village like that would have a big fire department? A small fire\ndepartment. We kept digging ditches, all around the factory. This explosion could go in, this was",

        "ammunition. Ammunition there, live ammunition! Powder! How many tons of powder were lying\nin those sacks that blew up to smithereens? The train tracks, crushed like this here. Trains were\nturned over, the cars were turned all upside down. And we got after--this was during the night. When\nwe got there during the daylight, everything was just flattened as a .... We lost at that time over a\nhundred people, they just disappeared. Just disappeared! I said to my friend, you see G__ would be\nwith us. We worked the day shift. We would have gone tonight, the night shift, we would have been\nthe ones. So they were able to find all these people after they opened up the halls. They knew where\neach factory was located. And they took out and buried them in a massive grave. There were over a\nhundred people. The ones you lived with,| the ones you stayed in the barracks with, the ones that\nwent through with you the whole camp, 1942. And then we had two days of peace because we all\nenjoyed inside, what happened. Nobody knew what happened. There was no air raid, there was no\nalarms, no airplanes coming along, was it sabotage? Nobody knew what happened. We still don't\nknow, I still don't today, I don't know what happened.\nEither sabotage or an accident?\nWe don't know. We can assume a lot of things but we have no valuable evidence to say that a plane\ncame along and dropped a bomb. Nobody knew it was a factory over there, it was so deep in the\nwoods.\nAnd you didn't hear any noises in the air?\nNo, we listen to places. During the day you could see planes flying over. But I'm sure they didn't\nknow there was a factory there. Was hidden so deeply in the woods. So two days, we were fortunate,\nnothing happened. The third day, they brought train loads, Hitleryuden, (ph)(c.143), youth,\nseventeen, sixteen, fifteen years of age, eighteen years of age. They brought along to camp. And\nthey took us to work. They beat the living daylights out of us. They were screaming and yelling and\nhitting you for no reason whatsoever. We were trying to get all the gravel, all the rocks, all the bricks\nthat were lying there, into a location, into one area. They lined us up like snakes, one after the other.\nOne hands over the other, hands over the other. How fast can you hand over one thing to the other\none? They were standing with whips and kept going and going and going. At last we can't do it any\nmore, impossible. How much can you do? No mercy. After we finished off cleaning up all the\ngravel, we found more bodies. Then they started to lay the railroad tracks again. Those railroad tracks\nare heavy. When you get four people like this, weak as hell, you expect these people to pick up a\ntrack? They kept beating the hell out of us for no reason. We kept saying, we cannot pick it up, it's\ntoo heavy, need a machine to pick this up. Nein, you must pick it up. Okay. We finished laying the\ntracks. Took us a week or something like that. We laid the tracks. Then they started bringing in\nprefabricated factories, prefabricated factories. If I tell you, within four weeks, between three and\nfour weeks you builded up seven new factories, the way it was before, you wouldn't believe it, would",

        "you? That's exactly what we did. Seven new factories with a railroad track to bring in fresh stuff\nback in again to continue making ammunition.\nSo you basically rebuilt the factory that had been destroyed?\nDestroyed from scratch, from scratch. Took us four weeks, we had the whole, because of these\nyoungsters, went 1n..\nThey didn't work though?\nNo, they kept pushing us. The only time they gave us a break was 12 o'clock. Twelve o'clock, they\ngave us a break, we had our lunch. What did the lunch consist of? Some vegetable soup and that's it.\nThen you continued working till six o'clock in the evening, go home. I have no shoes, my shoes wore\nout. I couldn't get any new shoes. I kept begging these kids, something to wrap around. So I find\nmyself some rags. Something in the back. I made the rags wrapped around like shoes, around and\naround, here and there with strings attached to it so I can walk. Because the weather was getting cold\nalready, the winter was approaching. So when the winter season came along, it got worse. 'Cause we\ncould hear more airplanes approaching the area. If they had to come this way, how do we know which\ndirection they were traveling? Whether they were going to Berlin, Leipzig, Dresden, _(c.180), I\ndon't know. How am I supposed to know? But the planes were coming from every direction. This\nwas in the winter time already, January, February. We kept going to the factories every single day.\nThey were so short of food, they gave us potato, what do you call that?, flour like, you know potato\nflour, what do you call that, Rosie? [\"Potato starch?\"] Something like that. If you put it in water, it\nmelts right away so you're able to eat that. We made a soup but then you get heartburn out of it. So\nthey gave us that to eat because they had no food for themselves. In Germany, they had no food. One\nthing for sure, though, 1f you weren't killed in the factory, the Germans weren't going to kill you. You\nwere safe there. In 1945, the beginning of '45, you felt in you, if you don't die from starvation, the\nGermans are not going to kill you because they needed you. They needed every labor they could\npossibly get. Because the demand for ammunition was so much. They used to go out with the\nGermans on the firing range. Used to take those panzer faus (c.195), the anti-tank grenades. They\ntested them before they shipped them out. Those panzer faus, anti-tank grenades were able to\npenetrate four inches of steel. Can you imagine how powerful that was? Had one German sitting in\nthe ground. We were surrounded by him, helping him out. He just put it in his shoulder, tapped him\nin its head, boom. Four inches of steel, a dent, not a hole completely, but a tremendous dent. So we\ntested it for about two or three days. Not continuously a full day. Let's see, we go out , let' see, two\no'clock in the afternoon till about four o'clock testing the ammunition. Then they tested different\ntypes of ammunition . Tremendous firing range there. This episode went on until about April, 1945.\nWe were almost finished. There was very little food. We were fed once a day because they didn't\nhave food for themselves. The commanding officer took us out in the middle of the camp and he said",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "we are going to leave this camp soon. What day I don't know but you'll be notified. Around this time\nof the year, ....\nApril.\nApril, we knew at least a holiday, trains arriving. This time we have closed cattle trains, closed. We\nsee them on the train, __ lined up. We were in that camp approximately between five and six\nhundred people. Small ammunition factory. They loaded us up on this train, they gave us food, the\nGermans and he was awfully nice, the commander. He says, I thank you for what you did. Maybe\nwe'll meet again. And whom do they send along with us on the trains? Old men, retired, 60, 70 years\nof age, with a pigeon rifle. Where you shoot down pigeons. They didn't even have rifles to handle\nanymore. But who was going to run anyplace? Who was going to do anything to them? You had no\nenergy. you had no place where to go. You're in a strange land. So the train was going with these---\n, he was sitting with us, inside the train.\nSo inside the cattle car, you had guards?\nYes, inside the cattle car. Every third cattle car had a guard with us. An old man, he was sitting with\nthem, talking to him in German. He was telling about his family, he says he had a wife, he has grown\nchildren. He has a son in the army, whether he 1s alive, he doesn't know. He has grandchildren who\ngo to school, hopefully, the war is over soon. I says, I hope you don't take revenge on me. I says, I\nhave nothing against you. You haven't done anything to me. It's not your fault, I'm here. You have\nto obey orders, you're in the army. I mean everybody was talking with him and everything. When\nwe arrived at the first station after we left the camp, the commanding officer went out and took a\ngroup of men from the trains and went into the town bakery. And says I have approximately 500 and\n600 people. I need bread. He says, where am I going to get bread for you? He says, you make it,\nyour business. You have to give them bread. So they gave us black bread which consisted of 60%\npotatoes and 40% flour. Because when you eat the bread, you could feel, it's so soft. It taste very,\nyou know, soft inside. So they told us, this is made from potatoes and flour. Some of the guys who\nwere in the camp were bakers, too. They could tell the difference. So this black bread tasted terrific.\nNo problem. Each one of us received a nice big slice of bread and we stayed on the station for about\ntwo or three hours and we continued. Then at night, I fell asleep on the camp and every morning they\ntook us the bodies and put it... There were two trains, two cattle trains especially for that purpose.\nTwo trains or two cars? Two wagons?\nTwo cars, two cars especially for that purpose. The pictures are here.",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "In other words they take out people who died during the night ...?\nDied during the night.\nAnd they put them in wagons of the dead?\nYes. Then we reached Tereza (ph)(c.253), that's when they took them out to bury them. So then the\nsecond stop was Dresden. We stopped behind the station and we heard tremendous alarms going on.\nThe bombing was going unbelievable. So we ask the guard, we says, what town is this here? He\nsays, that's east Dresden. Dresden, yeah. They were bombing it like crazy. I says, ve canish gain\nforward, (ph)(c.259), we can't go forward because they have to pick up the trains, or the tracks until\nthey able to move. In the meantime, we were hungry, no food. G__ sent down a miracle. A train, a\ncattle train came along with all sorts of vegetables, carrots, beets, kileron (ph)(c.264), carrobi\n(ph)(c.264) and cabbage. You name it, it was all full of vegetables, open trains. So the supervisor,\nthe commanding officer of the train, he says, each train, car tather, were allowed to send out three\nmen to go out and pick up whatever they can and bring it into the car. And what they did. They\nbrought it in. Of course, wherever we go, wherever we travel, we always assign one person, you are\nin charge because we are animals. We have to have somebody to supervise us, somebody who is able\nto control us. So when this man brought in all these fruits, vegetables rather, he right away put a\nblanket around it. The guard was sitting there eating carrots. And everybody got his piece of share\nof vegetable. It was delicious.\nWhich guy did you pick?\nWe picked three out to go. One of the men whom we knew he's a nice guy to talk to, you can tell,\nyou know you get to know each other; he's the one who's reliable who's able to take control. He had\na little more energy, more energetic, okay? And he took over everything and he divided everything\naccordingly. So each car, how many people were in the car, most probably I would say about between\n35 and 40 men in each car, okay? So you divided this at least we had for the day, we had a nice lunch,\nvegetable. We stood on the train and they allowed us to get out of the car to sit around on the car.\nThe guard was standing around to see what's happening. They didn't bother. Believe me, none of us\nhad any intention to take a ride anyplace or to go anywheres. There was no place to go, we had no\nenergy to run anyway. So we sat over there, it was a little group over there with water. So they\nallowed us to go over there so we washed up a little bit and deloused ourselves. we were filthy dirty.\nOkay, plenty of that was running around on us. Then we stood on that station one night and another\nair raid came along. When that air raid came, they locked the doors and they run into the woods.\nThey left us standing there.",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "The guards left you?\nYeah. So we said to each other. G__ almighty, if you wish us to live, protect us. I was the youngest,\nthe youngest from the whole bunch of people. That boy kept saying the same thing, he says G _\nalmighty, if you wish us to live, protect us. He protected us. The bombing, the falling in every\ndirection, any where which way except our train. Then there were plenty of trains with people from\ndifferent camps going the same direction. They were lined up on tracks as far as the eye could see.\nThe fifth day, they were able to let us go through. Either they fixed the railroad tracks or whatever\nhappened and we started to move. When we started to move, we felt good. Once you move, your\nsystem is different. When you stand still, you feel lousy. We drove in that trains for about two days\nand two nights and we arrived to a place, was Sudetline (ph)(c.311). That's already Czechoslovakia.\nIt was a big sign, so that you couldn't miss it. We were able to look through the holes, you know, so\nI said to the guard, I said it myself because I was sitting right next to him, I says, why can't ;you leave\nthe door open? I says, nobody's going to run away. Nein, nein. He had orders to keep the door\nclosed. We could have taken him and choke him, take his rifle, hit him over the head, right? Simple\nas ABC. But who has the guts to do it? You know, we had a feeling this 1s coming close to the end\nof the war. Because we saw so many air raids, so many planes coming around that area. When he\nmentioned the word Dresden, then I knew it was problems over there. Then Kamuinitz (ph)(c.320)\nwas next, bombing like crazy. Anyway, we arrived in Sudetenland (c.322). The train stopped, the\nCzechoslovakia border guards came and took over. The Germans went out, the SS auf Wiedersehen\nto us. Auf Wiedersehen. So they went in one direction and the Czech police took over the train and\nwe drove on the train. We didn't know where we going. All of a sudden, we arrive in a place. We\nsee people lounging, walking here, there. You felt like G__ almighty, 1s this the end of the war? Is\nthis...because everybody is so free. There's no factories, there's no work or anything. Then I ask\nsomebody, when they open up the door, where are we? He says, das iz Theresienstadt, das is\nTheresienstadt. I didn't know what the Theresienstadt, I never heard of it. So the German border, the\nCzechs made us all get out.\nThey had Czech police?\nCzech police, right. They were also armed but not severely. And we all got off the trains and I\ncollapsed. I collapsed, simply collapsed, I couldn't move. I tried to get up, fell back. I tried to get\nup, I fell back. Three times I tried to get out in the area. So this one person who lived in, who was in\nTheresienstadt came over to me and he gave me some sugar. He gave me a piece of sugar, you know\nthe square pieces of sugar? Took a piece of sugar and started to chew on it. It felt so good. He calls\nover anurse. Because the first thing they did, when they came into Theresienstadt, they took care of\nthe two cars, where they have the bodies and they took care of the people who collapsed. I was one\nof them. So he called over this nurse and somebody come over with a stretcher and they took me up\nto the hospital. So they took me up to the hospital; 1t had about four floors. It wasn't a hospital, it was",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "just a place, when I looked at the hospital, Isays, oh my G _ , this is backed into Skarzysko Kamienna.\nI hope it's not the same situation. That's the first thing that registered in my mind. So I said to the\nnurse, I says, where are we? where am I? what is happening here? He says, in here, she says, you're\nin good hands. This is Theresienstadt, the __\u2014_\u2014(c.356) ghetto, big ghetto. And in here people come\nand people go. But I didn't know the atrocities that they had in the Theresienstadt, previous, prior\nbecause we came towards the end of the war in April. Immediately a doctor came over to me, he\nlooked at me and examined, he says malnutrition. That was the answer, right? the\nessen.(c.362). So they gave me some soup, a little warm water to drink. I was lying over there, I fell\nasleep from exhaustion. I must have slept at least two days. Because I didn't eat for two days. I was\nlying in that hospital there and then I hear commotions going on outside. I looked out through the\nwindow, I see people are marching in the street. I says, what kind of a country is this? what is this\ngoing on in here? I am only used to see tragedy and this is people a different story altogether. So I\nask the nurse again who came around to check on me, she says to me, this is Theresienstadt. It's better\nin here than in any other place, now, she says. I says, what is the story with the war? She says, ah,\nthe war is almost finished, she says, the war is almost finished. This was April 28.",
        "That's the day you arrived?",
        "The day I arrived to Theresienstadt. So I stayed in that hospital for one week. Then I said to myself\nI feel a little better, I'm not going to stay around here because I kept seeing pictures of Skarzysko\nKamienna. I kept seeing pictures of them coming in and taking you out and put them on the trucks.\nI said, I don't want that picture. I couldn't get 1t out of my eyes. Every time, I looked at the ceiling\non the top there, I see Skarzysko Kamienna. Because that's the type of environment that hospital was.\nSo I got up in the afternoon and I sneaked out. I looked around for the concerns (?)(c.386), the\nconcerns that we lived in and I meet one of the boys who came from my camp. I says, where are you\nlocated? He says, right over there. All you have to do is go to the gate over there, register yourself\nand you go inside. So I went in there, registered myself, and they gave me a bunk to sleep on in the\nbarracks. And that's it. Nobody missed me in the hospital, they didn't even know who I was. They\ndidn't take my name down, my number, nothing. You're a number that's all. If you're there, you're\nthere; you're not there, you're not there. So I stayed at the concern. I was assigned to food, I was able\nto get..they give you a nice bowl of soup and a piece of bread, lunchtime. And I was able to sneak\nout, being a youngster at that time, I sneaked out, run to the kitchen and was able to pick up some\nscrap to get myself a little more energy. But one thing I was thinking of is, don't eat too much, slowly.\nBecause your system was so strained, so dried out, you can't eat too much. Can you imagine at that\nage, with so little education that I had, my mind was able to sustain and to think what might happen\nto me if I eat too much? You understand? You can't stretch something like that all of a sudden, got\nto do it slowly. I have decided there and then, little by little, I ate such little bread. The soup when I\nwas eating it, 1t took me two hours to finish it because I took my time. Then typhoid was out there,\nbroke out. Tremendous. People were dying without end. Every minute of the day, they were carrying\npeople out. \u2014___(\u00a2.415) Thad it too. I controlled it myself. Then the good day\ncame. V-E day. May 8, 11 o'clock in the morning, we hear shooting. Shooting like crazy. They",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "were trying to kill us yet. Can you imagine, the Russians were right outside the gates and here the\nGermans were shooting in with machine guns! Into the Theresienstadt. They had gas camps [\"I\nthought they were going to gas you there.\"|] That's nght but they never succeeded because the\nRussians came with such an impact. They came in so fast that they left the Germans standing with\ntheir pants down. They called them, the whole families. Can you imagine? The German army were\nfighting with their families together. Their wives and the children were sitting in the wagon, a horse\nand buggy, and he had a machine gun on himself. But they could not succeed what they were trying\nto do. The Russians came in about noontime with their tanks. You should have seen the joy. But\nwhere are the energy, what energy? I took a group of friends of mine, went into the main highway\nwhere the German army was surrendering to the Russians. The Russians says to us, Vre__(c.437),\nchildren, do what you want. Believe me, I didn't lay a hand on them. But I took whatever they have,\nall their possessions, whatever they have. We grabbed whatever they have. What is it mostly we\ntaking then? Food! Everything else we throw away. We left the villages to pick it up. They have\nbeautiful clothing, underwear, shirts, pants, socks, you name it, they have it. They were so loaded up\nto the brim with everything. We didn't take nothing from them except food. They have so much food\nin their wagons, you have no idea. Let them go empty. Out, out. They kept begging us, they says,\ngive me at least my tobacco. Nothing. Some of them grabbed sticks and brooms and they beat the\nliving daylight of them to let them go to camp because the Russians were lined up on both sides the\nhighways. We brought back a lot of food to the camp. As I said before, I held myself back. I had\nmy little corner in the bunk, where I slept below. I put a little blanket around it, tied 1t down with a\nrope and left my food in there. Whenever I felt myself hungry, I kept eating but I never overate\nmyself. I watched myself very carefully because I saw what happened to the others. Then two days\nlater, they formed a committee in the Theresienstadt already, among the people in the camp, and they\nsaid we have to save the youngsters. And they went from barracks to barracks, from concern to\nconcern, how old are you? this way, how old are you? this way, how old are you? this way. And they\ntook us out by hand. They took us over to a separate unit near the Russian headquarters where the\nRed Cross was there waiting for us. And examined us, checked us out. Of course, everybody had\nthe same problem, malnutrition. They gave us dry milk to drink, they gave us cereal, they gave us\nnutritious food. Chocolate. While we were there, we looked around at each other and then we started\nto reminiscing. What happened in the camps, what happened towards the end of the camp, what\nhappened, this and that. You know, everybody had a story this big. And we felt like one family, like\none family. You are my brother now, you are my brother now, I have nobody else. They were able\nto scrape together 270 boys from the age of 15 to the age of 19, 20 and thirty girls who survived the\nwar. This was only in the Theresienstadt. The girls came from different parts of Europe also. One\nfrom here, one from there. The boys also. Very few came from the same hometown. Those were all\nthe survivors. They allocated us into one area where they took very good care of us, medically,\nphysically and mentally.",
        "This is the Red Cross?",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "That was the Red Cross. They wanted to save the children. The least we can do. If we don't save\nthem, he says, there's nothing to save. And the Russians were very grateful to us. They were so nice\nto us. They kept giving us food. We couldn't believe it because we had rumors that the Russians\nwere so bad and everything else. That's not true! They were nice, they're human beings. They treated\npeople just as well as anybody else did. Americans didn't come in because the Russians...that was\ntheir territory to take over. They sacrificed a lot of lives to save the Theresienstadt, the Russians did.\n(\"They heard there was a camp, they went...\"| They knew there was an extermination area there and\nthey were afraid something would happen. [\"They went out of their way to get to it.\"] So then, May,\nJune, it was a paradise. We had everything we wanted. We mingled with the other people.\nEverything was beautiful. Was dancing, was happiness going on. Nobody...till it hits you. You\nknow, one day it hits you. You says, oh my G__, my family. That was the worst part of your life.\nUntil then, your stomach was empty, you thought of food. But when you filled up, you got everything,\nthen you start thinking about what you have lost, what's missing. Something is missing in your life,\nyou don't have everything. Although your friends are your brothers now and your sisters, but\nsomething else is missing. Then you have to work your system...your mind has to start going around\nin a different way to look upon life. Maybe, this is the fate that we have to accept. Have to start anew.\nRight there and then, I have decided never to go back to Poland. Right there and then, I have decided,\nI don't want to see that country, I don't want to hear of it, Ihave no proof of it. No use for it. I blame\nthe country what happened to my folks. Maybe I'm wrong but that's the way I feel. Then each country\nsend a representative to the Theresienstadt to take its people home. Hungarians, there were Czechs,\nPolaks, Italians. There were Germans, there were Austrian Jews there. Every country sent a trainload\nto take its people home. Except us. After they left, a committee from England arrived to\nTheresienstadt and had a meeting with us. With us children, we have two choices. Either come with\nus to England or you go to Russia. I know you don't want to back to your country. Without hesitation,\nI decide to go to England although I didn't know anything about England. I didn't know anything\nabout the United States. Forget about that. But I knew about Russia. Why didn't I choose to go to\nRussia? Instinct told me go to England. Although the Russians were very nice to me, I was very\nfriendly with them; I made a lot of friends with the Russians. And so when we made the decision to\ngo to England, he says it'll take a couple of days and you'll be all traveling. Fine. July, the end of\nJuly, we were told we have to go to the Russian headquarters to receive passports. I still have it, nght?\nI have the passport. It says... We had to go to Russian headquarters to give us passports to leave the\ncountry. So one of the Russian officers came out and started talking with us. He always called us\nRaybeeacha (ph)(c.572). Raybeeacha means children. And he says, I know it's your choice where\nyou want to go. We're not going to stop you but if you choose to go with us, the Russians, we will be\nhappy to accept you. But if you choose to go there, it's up to you. We already made up our minds,\neverybody made up their minds where they going. So the fateful day came in August. We packed\nour belongings, whatever we had, not much. We boarded a comfortable train on Theresienstadt and\nwe drove with the train to Prague. Prague is the capital of Czechoslovakia. In Prague, we stayed with\nthe Czech underground. Remember I told you about this officers...with them, we stayed in their\nheadquarters. They fed us, they clothed us, and they gave us lodging and waited for the planes to\narrive from England. In the meantime, while we were waiting, the weather wasn't so pleasant so they\ndecided to give us a grand tour of Prague. The president of Prague just arrived two days ago from\nEngland. He was in England during World War II.",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "The president of Czechoslovakia?\nCzechoslovakia, yes. Jan Masaryk, his name was Jan Masaryk. So they gave us a tour with the trolley\ncars. They boarded four trolley cards. We each boarded the trains, it was enough for three hundred\nkids, three cars would be accommodated. They took us to the circus from there. Then we visited,\nthere was one Jewish synagogue left and they made us visit that too. We were very delighted,\neverybody was beautiful. Everything was good. The day was over, exhausted. We were exhausted,\nbelieve me. We came back, we took our sleep, (c.604) things were there. Took us by bus...\nOkay?\nYeah.\nWe drove to the airport in Prague and we boarded a plane and we flew into England. We arrived in\na place in England called Carlise, that must be Scotland. Right?\nNear Lockerbie? (C.621)\nRight, right. Carlise. We got off the planes, we had something to eat on the plane. You know, we're\nsitting bomber planes. It wasn't very comfortable, no seats there. Who cares, youngsters don't care.\nWe had some supervisors coming along but not much of them. We landed, we were examined by the\nBritish security, ask you questions, they all spoke German too. Because they figured that's the only\nlanguage they'll be able to respond with us, in Yiddish or German. We all received a glass of milk\nand a piece of cake. Then the supervisors that we had; they put such a tremendous fear in us, knowing\nwe were wild. We were very wild, food was the main object in our life at that time. So if you see\nfood, you grab it, you know, you don't ask questions. He kept saying, he says, the people in England\nare very particular. They watch you continuously. If you don't behave yourself, they kick you out of\nthe country. So please behave yourself, even if you see something that you want, don't touch. So\nafter we arrive, we're checked out, passports and everything, we boarded a plane to go to\nWindermere.(ph)(c.634). Windermere is a beautiful lake, it's a countryside..it's not far much\nManchester. At each bus, had in the middle of the bus, a big basket of fruit. Can you imagine that, a\nbig basket of fruit? You cannot touch it because they told us, don't touch anything which you see.\nThis is a test. I said to myself, what in the world is all this about? It's there for you to eat, not to look\nat, right? The trip took about approximately between two and three hours from the airport to\nWindermere. Windermere was a camp, prior to World War II, where the British children, while they\nwere bombing London, they send the children to this camp. So this camp was already well-\nestablished with all the accommodations for us. So why we were riding the bus, the supervisor says,\neverybody can get up and take one apple. The basket was empty in two seconds. Each bus had a",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "basket of fruit. Each bus, there were three buses. After we arrived in the camp, we were greeted in\nthe camp by Rabbi Weiss. He had a beautiful staff with him. A few doctors, nurses and we went\nright away to the infirmary. We were checked out, examined, given a blanket and assigned to a cabin.\nEach barrack had accommodation for about 50 children. Each child had his own little room, had a\nbed, a cabinet where you can put your clothes in, and was a piece of cake, food and juice after you\nwent inside. This was late at night already, we arrived it was about ten o'clock at night. The following\nday, we hear the war is over in Japan. The Japanese war was August 14, right? The end of the war.\nWe didn't know what the joyous was all about. The British knew what it was all about, we didn't\nknow. I didn't know there was a war going on between the United States and ....\nYou didn't even know where Japan was?\nExactly. Okay, never mind the United States. So everybody was dancing in the streets, you know,\nthe people in the vicinity, what was the joys? We couldn't correspond to these people because we\ncouldn't talk their language. Our leaders told us that it was the end of World War with the Japanese.\nOkay, fine, no problem with that. So we stayed in this camp. We were checked out very thoroughly.\nEvery day, different doctors would arrive. The media, of course, comes right away. Then they started\nto teach us basics. How to behave, how to pick up a fork and a knife, how to eat with a spoon, how\nto take a piece of bread and put a little jam or margarine on it. Who knew those things? I wasn't\nused to those things. I was a child when I left home. Manners, how to sit at a table and eat. That\ntook a lot of courage from our leaders to undertake--because you're dealing with youngsters, not\nbabies. These are youngsters, grown up, 15 up to 20 years of age. Try to regulate these people, wasn't\nso easy. But somehow, they succeeded, they succeeded. For the first two days, was a little bit strange.\nCamps was always a different feeling. A camp was a camp. Whether it's this camp or another camp,\nit's acamp. But somehow you felt that you are among people which you can trust. People who care\nfor you, people who are willing to help you, so you have to sort of bend a little bit. Be there. I think\nmost of the boys and the girls sort of acclimated themselves in the first three days. So they became a\nlittle humanized. Sat at the table and eat like a human being. Didn't grab the food like ==. Now\nwe're given breakfast in the morning, porridge--that's the British breakfast--porridge or what's that\nherring they have, kipper, kipper, that's a British meal. Then we have lunch, nice meal, then at 3\no'clock in the afternoon, we had white bread with jam and milk. That time in Britain, food was\nrationed. They had to share the food with the children that came in, 300 of us. Then a rabbi came\nfrom London and he said to us, if you know that you have any relatives anywhere in the United States\nor South America, give me the name and we'll let them know that you are alive. So I remembered\nthat my father had two brothers who immigrated to Argentina in the thirties. Whether it was '35 or\n'36, I don't remember but I know they emigrated in the thirties.\nFrom your hometown?",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "From my hometown. So I told this rabbi that I have two uncles live in Argentina. I don't know their\naddresses, I don't know their names. Of course, after the rabbi finishes with all these people getting\ninformation, if anyone of those children had anything, they gave information. Within two months, I\nreceived a letter from my uncle in Argentina. He is my father's brother and he 1s asking me what\nhappened to his family. What could I tell him? Same thing that happened to my family, right? Maybe\nhe felt guilty, he didn't take them down there. He could have taken them down to Argentina after he\nleft there. He could have taken them down. So I found this uncle in Argentina but I didn't know how\nto in the United States.(c. 697) Okay? So after being in Windermere, for about six months,\nwe went through thorough checkup by doctors in hospitals, x-ray and everything. They found out\nthat a yellow blemish, in my lungs? [\"where\"], that spot, [\" you didn't find out until you were here.\"].\nI know, what did I have? {\"well, calcification, it showed. He didn't find out til..\"] No, no, no, no, I\nknew I had it in Theresienstadt, I mean in Windermere but I didn't mention it when I was here. [\"Oh\"]\nAnyway, they put me in a special diet, I don't know if the diet helped me or what, it doesn't make no\ndifference. Then they send in from each town in England, Manchester, Liverpool, London, Glasgow,\nall big cities that have large Jewish populations. And they selected groups of kids, a group of 15, a\ngroup of 20, a group of 30, whatever the amount of people. They come over to you separately and say\nto you, what kind of a home would you like, a kosher home? you want a religious home? and all these\nquestions were asked and we was able to analyze which one would be compatible. They were\ncompatible with me, . In my group, we were able to get together 15 young boys. And this\nrabbi, came to this town, Manchester, picked us up and took us by train to Winchester into a home.\nA home made for 15 boys, no girls. Fifteen boys, it was orthodox, _ and in their home, we started\nto recuperate. Started to get to know everything, we started to learn a language, and we started to get\nclasses. Every single day we had classes. Morning, started at 10 o'clock, finished 3 o'clock in the\nafternoon. We learned the basic, English, math, history, geography' whatever you want to learn.\nThere we started to go to English schools at that age because we didn't, it didn't at any of the classes\nof the English we're going because we were already aged. So I was able to go at night to school. I\npicked up English in six weeks, six months, rather, I'm sorry. In six months, I was able to speak\nEnglish. I went to meetings, I listened to people talk, I read a lot of papers. I bought myself an Oxford\ndictionary and taught myself the language I hear while I was going to school. In the meantime, while\nwe are having some lessons in our home and took care of us, we lived together as one family, 15 boys.\nAnd then we had once a year, we had a reunion. We all get together, we all, 300 of us who came with\nthis transport, we met in London. We had a tremendous reunion. In the meantime, more youngsters\nwere arriving to England from different parts of Europe. But in our group, we stuck together. We're\njust like one big, large family. In the meantime, I received a letter from a friend of mine who happens\nto look for his brothers. He went to search for his brothers in Europe. He found out that his brothers\nsurvived and live in France. So he went there and he found his two brothers. And he read in the paper\nthat in America, New York, is a committee in my hometown, looking for survivors. And he\nresponded. Then this man send him another letter, telling him if you know anybody else who\nsurvived, please let us know. He notified me in England. He knew I went to England, he didn't want\nto go because he says, I'm going to look for my family. You go to England, he says, I have an\nopportunity, I'm not going to miss it. I took the opportunity for him. So he sent me this letter from\nthis man and I knew this man very well because his parents, his brothers lived nearby us, were\nneighbors. So I wrote him a letter in Yiddish, who I was, my grandfather's name, my father's name",
        "https://collections.ushmm.org",
        "and so on and so forth. And told him where we lived approximately and he knew the area so he knew\nI'm authentic. Within a month I get a letter from him, with three addresses. My father's brother, my\nfather's two sisters resided in New York City.\nAnd that's when you discovered that you had aunts and uncles in America?\nRight, right, right. I immediately answered this (c.751) wrote each a letter, telling them who\nI was and I send a picture of myself. And immediately my uncle over here said, we bring you over\nto the United States. Would you like to come? Of course! Although I could have come on my own,\ntoo, because I was a stateless person. I had no country. I only went to England via Israel. It was a\nstopover like they say. The committee was able to get permission from the British government to\nrescue these 300 children to bring them to England till they recuperate, then they'll be able to go\nfurther.\nSo the intention was that you guys would be sent to Israel?\nRight.\nBut you never did go?\nNo, I didn't go. I didn't go. Instead, when I found my relatives over here, I was able to correspond\nwith them and told them who I was and everything. So they found it realistic. It took them a long\ntime to get me there. Okay? In the meantime, I went to school in England, started off from the\nbeginning, from scratch what I left over in Poland. I was actually a dummy. I was an idiot. I mean,\nhow much could I have learned in five years in Polish schools? I had to start over from scratch, one\nand one is two, 2 and 2 is four. Geography, history, in reading and writing. I had to learn new types\nof millimeters, you know there was no centimeters for me any more. Was no kilometers, was miles,\nso all things had to be converted. It was pounds or shillings and those things had to be converted too.\nSo [had to start from scratch, from ABC. At my age, I was able to achieve it. I thought, well, I made\nfriends, I made a lot of friends in England, a lot of friends. I was very, very happy in England. People\nwere awfully nice. British people were awfully nice. I can never forget, awfully nice. And then after\nfour years in England, I think it was four years, 1945, I got to England, I left 1950.\nIt was five years.",

        "Five years in England, five years in England, my passport came through to go to the United States.\nSo, I say farewell to everybody, goodbye to everyone, I came to the United States. It was February\n9, 1950, a windy day, a cold day...\nBy plane or..?\nNo, by boat.\nSo you arrived on the 9th in February in New York City?\nIn New York City, yes. It took me two weeks to go by boat because it was so rough. The sea was\nreally rough. And of course, when I came...\nWere you seasick?\nYes, I was seasick, yes. When I arrived in New York, the committee was over here already and\nasked me when they came aboard the ship, would I recognize my relatives? I says, I never met them,\nI never seen them before but I have pictures of them and they have pictures of me. So she took me\nby hand and took me to the relatives. They recognized me and I recognized them. And that was it.\nFrom then on, I was here. My relatives welcomed me. I was very happy with them. A year later, I\nwas in the United States army, can you imagine that?\nDrafted?\nOf course. Was the Korean War was on. And every alien who came to the United States in 1950, if\nyou were the age at that time, I was 24, I had to register for the United States Army. I was drafted\nimmediately. Thank G__, I didn't go to Korea. I was trained in Ft. Dennis, Massachusetts. I had my\ntraining also in Camp Edwards, upstate Camp Drumn (ph)(c.795) upstate New York. Camp Drumn\nis near the Canadian border. I was also in Camp Edwards in Massachusetts, that's in Cape Cod. I\nfinished my service in 1953. And married her in 1951.

        "I was a soldier, yeah. I had nine months to go yet in the army. So since then, everything was going\nfor me up. The reason, I believe, because I have faith, I never gave it up. I believed very strongly\nthat life has to go on, you can't just push it in a side. The living has to go on. I cannot bring back my\nfamily as much as I keep thinking of them. As little as I can start looking at it and trying to remember\nthem, it's far away from me. I can't remember them so much. But that's what kept me going. I am\nvery grateful that I met my wife who has been part of my life for forty years, made my life very happy.\nWe have two children, now a grandson. I'm very grateful to this country for giving me the opportunity\nto be an American citizen, serve faithfully in the United States army, got honorably discharged. I\ncan't complain, I'm very happy.\nSo although you were sad to leave England, are you happy here?\nI found my happiness in your country. Of course, I've always a person who finds relief no matter\nwhere I go. If I determine that I want to make this my permanent home, I will do it. I always have a\nstrong determination, no matter what I did, I never gave up. Once you give up, life is worthless.\nMany times when I think back, when I meet my friends, I say to him, remember when we went to\nwork in Schleeben? how did we work? You remember how you walked to work? He says no. I says,\nI will remind you. What happened to the stick you had in your hand? Took a branch, a stick off the\nbranch from a tree. He had one in his hand and I had one in my hand. We walked together to the\nfactory 'cause once I got into the factory in Schleeben, I was able to sit on a bench and let the work\ngo through me. So those things you keep remembering. And you keep telling yourself, that gives\nyou an uplift. Life has to go on.\nYou never returned?\nNever returned to Poland. As I said before, in the beginning, I gave my word of honor that I shall\nnever, never go back to this country. I never pursued to find out what happened to my family. The\nreason because my father had two brothers, he had a brother and two sisters in America. Was he\nalive, he would have contacted them. If my mother was alive, she would have done the same thing,\nshe has some relatives in here too. Therefore, I believe nobody survived.\nSo that letter that your Polish supervisor carried to you from your father, that was the last...?\nThat was the last letter from my parents.\nAnd that was from September, 1942?",

        "Forty-two. That was the last letter.\nSo you think that your parents were among those who were transported in September of '42?\nRight. There was an eyewitness.\nAnd your brother and your sister...?\nWent with them. My father thought while I was in camp, maybe we should send my brother with\nthem, to my camp. I says what do you want to send him here for? I should look at his problems, he'll\nlook at my problems? At least, when I am by myself, I eat my heart out by myself.\nHe was very young then?\nOne year younger.\nObviously, you have bad memories of growing up in Poland?\nYes.\nI remember you said that you hold Poland partially responsible for what happened?\nRight, yes.\nDo you have any particular memories either when you were going to school in Poland that would\ncause you to ...?\nYes, yes. In Poland, the schools were very anti-semitic. Iam sorry to say that but this is the true fact.\nWhen I first attended school, my first grade wasn't so bad. The second grade wasn't so bad, either.\nThe third grade, we were isolated in the schools. We didn't have individual seats. We had those long",

You couldn't sit with\nthem together. You were sort of indirectly isolated.\nSo Jewish children all sat together?\nYes, yes.\nTo the left?\nNot necessarily left because the benches were from this side of the window to here. So we had a long\nbench here, could accommodate, let's see, twenty children. Okay? So if you have the 18 Jewish girls,\nthe 18 were sitting there, nobody else could be sitting with them. The same thing with the Jewish\nboys. So I have very bad memories. And then when we left school, I was once hit with a rock right\nhere on my forehead here and I went to the principal with my father, took me to the principal. And\nmy father says, look what the boy did and he pointed out to the boy. Yes, Zhazeewish (ph)(c.871)...\nYoure a Jew?\nNo, Zhazeewish means you're still living, so everything is okay. He says, I'm sure the boy didn't mean\nit. But these particular boys were agitating me, they were bothering me. There was an isolation,\ndefinitely, an isolation among the Gentiles, Jews; the Gentiles and the Jews.\nHow about your grades?\nMy grades, as far as I can remember, up to the fourth grade, the grades were good. In the fifth grade,\nmy grades were not good enough because the war broke out so I couldn't continue any more. I always\nwanted to learn, I always wanted to learn.

Because I love to read, I\nlove to read and write. But I never got top grading from my marks. So I have this feeling left in my\nmemory because I didn't get the backing from the teachers.

Why should\nyou be isolated? why should you be different than somebody else?\nNone of your teachers were Jewish?\nNo, there was no Jewish teachers, no.\nHow about your brother and sister?\nMy brother, I was held back one year so I can have my brother with me in the same class so we could\nshare the books.\nSo your brother was in your class?\nMy brother was in the class, sitting next to me.\nHe had the same experience as you?\nThe same experience. We all had the same experience.\nWere there any particular experiences that, you know, he had or that you had that ..?\nWell,if I had an experience, my brother would always come over to the rescue. He was my protector.\nMy brother was my protector. A friend of mine, David Greenberg, my wife knows him, [\"That's how\nI met him\"], he was the organizer. He's a little older than I am. He was in the same class as I was.\nMany times we boycotted the school because we felt that the teacher 1s not doing enough to let us\nchildren learn the way the other children are learning. So we boycotted the school. We didn't go to\nclasses. The principal came in and find out the following day says, how come didn't you didn't attend\nclass yesterday.

So why bringing more over?\nSo they may have come before the quotas were introduced?\nYes, because one of my aunts came over here just buying a ticket.

They didn't have a goal. The children of my father's generation, they already knew that life in a\nsmall town cannot be profitable. They sort of moved to larger cities, joined organizations. Those\norganizations had pioneers. The pioneers had camps that prepared them for Israel, kibbutzim,\ncommunal life. So they went and pursued those things.
