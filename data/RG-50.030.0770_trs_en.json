        "Q: And where\u2019s that?",
        "A: I-In there, on part, they were divided, so there was a fence between the one park\nand the other. One was the school, which was just ordinary school with the school\nfor the teachers. The other was the ci-city of Bialystok where \u2014 where\nmagistrat(ph) is.",

At that time the teacher, after 12 of the 13 grade.\nOtherwise, she has only the right to teach up to the ninth \u2014 sixth grade, sorry.

        "Q: In 1920.",
        "A: Because he \u2014 in 1920, he was 22. So most likely he was in the army. They never\ntalk about that. The only thing my mother convince him to leave the army. And\nbecause he was in the army before, he was the army reserve. So from time to time\nhe had to go and learn a bit more for a week or two. Otherwise, he was a clerk. A \u2014\nmost likely he was an accountant. I didn\u2019t know much about tt.",

        "Q: Palace, okay.",
        "A: Mm-hm. The buildings were built \u2014 when I visit after the war, the walls were\nmost likely close to a meter wide. So it was always warm, but of course for the\nrestroom we would have to go \u2014 share it with two other families and go downstairs\nsomewhere. There was no hot water, and things like that, because the building at\nthat time was already 150 years old.",

        "A: Before the war. They were going to put it into underground. What they did\nafterwards, I don\u2019t know. I visited Bialystok only once from this country, and it\nwas completely different. Before the war, it was 104,000 people. And apparently\nhalf of the population was Jewish. I thought it only about a third. Part of the poorest\npart was Jewish, and they were all \u2014 also little shacks where they were selling every\n\u2014 food and everything, so we would go there. And I\u2019m sure that 1t was completely\nburned while eur \u2014 when the Jewish people were fighting.",

        "Q: Wait, excuse me, I\u2019m going to interrupt. We\u2019ll come to that point. I\u2019d like to\nleave the \u2014 the stories and the experiences about World War II to the side right now,\nand concentrate on \u2014 on what \u2014 what was life like pre-war. And I have a few\nquestions already from what you were telling me, and they\u2019re factual kinds of\nquestions.",

        "A: Young boy. And he saw that Turk coming, and he killed him. For that act \u2014 ezyn\nin Polish, he was named Czynski(ph), and the king ga-gave him somewhere \u2014 right\nnow it\u2019s Ukraine, Humanya(ph). He gave him a big place. And of course, he gave\nhim \u2014 he was a nobleman, made a nobleman for that ezyn. And he was\nCzynski(ph). My mother is \u2014\nOctober 22, 2014",
        "Q: Czynska(ph).",
        "A: \u2014ma-\u2014 was Czynska(ph) from that. But the leet \u2014 that \u2014 that young boy was\nJewish. And to be a nobleman he cannot be Jewish, he had to be Catholic. And\nbecause of that his mother \u2014 most likely they were poor.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And he was given a lot of land and being a nobleman for always, and she didn\u2019t\nlike it, chan-changing her allegiance, no. So she curse him and \u2014 up to 11\"\ngeneration. I\u2019m his 11\" gener-generation. So what \u2014 I have one in 2000 drop of\nJewish blood.",

And the story, but I don\u2019t know, it was mo \u2014 most likely my grandfather \u2014\nPoland was taken by Russia and \u2014 and so on, three times. And once, my\ngrandfather as a baby, was carried through the border in a wash basket. So \u2014",
        "Q: From Russia into \u2014",

        "A: And that\u2019s also story in the family. She was the younger \u2014 youngest of four from\nsecond wife. Of course, the first one died, no \u2014 not divorced. So she\u2019s \u2014 for a\nwoman, my mother was born 1898. So at that time, to bring up four children, so my\nfather wish her \u2014 I wish that he \u2014 that that one will die for you. That was my\nmother. Well, three is easier than four. She managed somehow.",

        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: \u2014 and she brought up her children.",
        "A: Yes. So she was a teacher, and because of that we lived there. And she had a\nservant, she had to, but in comparison I can\u2019t \u2014 did \u2014 I didn\u2019t say how big was our \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah, tell me.",
        "A: \u2014 apartment. Four of us and the servant, there were two rooms. One little room\nconnected with two rooms, and kitchen, and so they couldn\u2019t be \u2014 that room could\nnot be used for anything, only just storage of \u2014 cupboard. And the servant sleeps in\nthe kitchen.",
        "Q: Wow.",
        "A: When the Soviets expelled us, a man came in and my mother says, well, we\u2019re\nhere only, and [indecipherable] there no room. And he said, oh, in our country\neven Stalin doesn\u2019t have such a good room. And he believed.",
        "Q: Yeah, he believed, yeah, yeah.",
        "A: He believed. But it was really very small, but that was cheaper than \u2014 because of\nOctober 22, 2014",

        "A: It\u2019s halfway from Warszawa to \u2014 you say Vilnius, I\u2019m saying Wilno.",
        "Q: So it\u2019s halfway between Warsaw and Wilno, and Wilno is in Lithuania, so that\nmeans it\u2019s in eastern Poland.",
        "A: Yes, right now it\u2019s very easter, but is part of \u2014 biggest part of Poland was taken\nby Soviet Union.",
        "Q: So that means that it\u2019s in the northeastern part, so \u2014",
        "A: Slightly north to the Warsaw, but it\u2019s not very far. I think, if I\u2019m right, it\u2019s 110\nkilometers. That means about 18 miles from Warsaw. And when my brother\nfinished his middle school gymnasium, four years, that\u2019s the 10\" grade, he decided\nto go and visit my aunt, which was in Pruszkow, which is very close to wa \u2014\nWarsaw, and my grandparents were in Warsaw \u2014 on the bicycle. And he made it in\nOctober 22, 2014\none day, but the more \u2014 most thing difficult was the first part, because it was not\npaved. It was just a road. And that\u2019s the main road from Warsaw to Wilno.",
        "Q: Now, within Bialystok, were the roads paved?",
        "A: They were something what we call koci bur(ph), cat\u2019s heads. It\u2019s a \u2014",

        "A: He was really a bright boy. Now, there was one child who was a \u2014 e-easter\nOrthodox. The \u2014 so three out of about 40. Our classes were large because it was \u2014\nthe school was called Treitanufka(ph), something what you learn how to do it. So\nthey \u2014",
        "Q: Vocational school.",
        "A: Vo \u2014 it was vocation for the teacher. The mother \u2014 my mother was teaching the\ngrades. And the [indecipherable] pedagogic.",
        "Q: Pedagogical, okay.",
        "A: Yes, and those teachers had to learn on us. And since in the country there were\nbig classes \u2014 usually, I think, in Poland were, in cities it will be 30 in class. But in\nours 1t was 40, and once I was 1n a connected school, connected class, third and\nfourth grade together, 60 kids all together, so the teacher would learn how to do it.\nOnly one year like that. So, there were big classes. And out of our 40, there were\nOctober 22, 2014\nthree children who had the option \u2014 there was Catholic religion I think twice a week\nfor an hour \u2014 they could stay, or they could go out. That was not discrimination,\nthey a -\u2014 all \u2014 all the children were very, very glad to leave and do whatever they\nwant.",
        "Q: Not have to be \u2014 yeah.",
        "A: No, that was definitely not discrimination, they could stay and learn. Our \u2014 for\ninstance, we start with the prayer. They would not have to pray with us, only they\nhave to stand up on the very beginning and the very end of the school. But they\nwould have to pass religion to pass to the next grade. So \u2014",
        "Q: Their own religion?",
        "A: Their own religion. So the rabbi has to say that they passed the religion for the,\nsay second grade, before they will go to the third. But what they learn, that was his\nonly. He did not have to say what he consider good for the second grade.",
        "Q: And you\u2019re saying this was true for the Orthodox children as well?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Okay. And were there many Orthodox children?",
        "A: In my class, only one.",
        "Q: And that brings me to another question. You mentioned that you thought that the\nJewish population of Bialystok was maybe 30 percent, but after \u2014 truly afterwards\nOctober 22, 2014\nyou [indecipherable] half. So were there Ukrainians in Bialystok? Were there\nother nationalities?",
        "A: No. I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. But there was a joke after the Russians came in, that people used\nto say when they were in White Russia or Ukraine \u2014 we call it White Russia \u2014",
        "Q: You\u2019re talking Belarus?",
        "A: That they lived Bialosc(ph).",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: I can\u2019t pronounce it properly. They used to say that we\u2019re local, we\u2019re local. And\nthey say afterwards that Polish people wanted \u2014 for 20 years wanted to make them\nPolish and they didn\u2019t, but the Russians came and did it in two weeks.",
        "Q: Well, there is something to that, yes.",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: I remember from learning about the region around Wilno, the people would say\nthe same thing. Who are you? And they wouldn\u2019t say I am Polish or I\u2019m Lithuanian\nor I\u2019m Russian.",
        "A: I\u2019m local.",
        "Q: They say, I\u2019m tutejszy. I\u2019m from here.\nOctober 22, 2014",
        "A: Yes, tutejszy it\u2019s local, yes",
        "Q: Yeah, I\u2019m from here.",
        "A: Mm-hm, mm-hm.",
        "Q: Which is an interesting kind of identity.",
        "A: Well, because it was under Russia, Poland doesn\u2019t exist for 150 years, and they\nfelt Polish, so \u2014",
        "Q: Sort of. Kind of.",
        "A: Kind of Polish.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: They knew that the \u2014 the others are strangers, the others are occupa \u2014 occupants.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And don\u2019t \u2014 don\u2019t treat people the same ways. So \u2014 so, they were local.",
        "Q: They were local. So let\u2019s talk a little bit more about religion, a little bit. Was\nyour family religious?",
        "A: My parents were not. They treat \u2014 well, I think that the \u2014 the problem was that\nthey believed in regulation of birth, and that\u2019s against the ga \u2014 Catholic church.\n[indecipherable]",
        "Q: Oh, so they believed in birth control.\nOctober 22, 2014",
        "A: Birth control. I believe that was the reason, but I don\u2019t know. But they kept us,\nwe were going to \u2014 to church every Sunday, and \u2014 and well, th-they try not to talk\nabout that, but because of they believe in bir-birth control, they didn\u2019t try to go to\nchurch and pretend that they are good Catholics.",
        "Q: I see. But you were \u2014 you, nevertheless, would ha \u2014 take religion classes in\nschool, and did you go through the various stages of, you know, having a First\nCommunion and a Confirmation, and things like that?",
        "A: Yes, yes. There is only one thing. My mother told me that once a woman came\nto her and said, I don\u2019t want my child to be in a religion class. And my mother said,\nwhat \u2014 well, I\u2019m an athe \u2014 atheist. So all through those years my mother was\n[indecipherable] something. There was one atheist.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: And of course her child, who would not go to religion class because that was \u2014\nonly she could not provide a certificate of any religion that he passed. So he was not\nlearning.",
        "Q: Really? Okay.",
        "A: But one in years. So at that time it wasn\u2019t, it was la \u2014 and there is one other\nthing, people av \u2014 who say about anti-Semitism in Poland. | believe that there was\nno \u2014 not really anti-Semitism. It wa \u2014 came during the war, brought by Soviet\nOctober 22, 2014\nUnion. My husband was a mathematician, and he knew a mathematician in Poland\nwho was very distinct in \u2014 in Warsaw Polytechnic. | forgot his name right now.\nAnd he was very respected, s-some grand or something like that, one year, and the\nsecond year they told him to get out of Poland, they allowed him. But he was\nmarried to a Catholic woman and had Catholic child. So he was expelled and not\n[indecipherable]",
        "Q: And [indecipherable] sort of \u2014",
        "A: That was during the war. And he lived with us, he came to United States, he\nlived with us for a week or two. And right now, if he\u2019s alive, he\u2019s still teaching in\nan \u2014 Ann Arbor. But that came, that one year everything was \u2014 was bad, it was\nsupposed to be bad because of Jewish people. And I think something was bad,\npeople can\u2019t take very easily. So most likely right now there is the real anti-\nSemitism in part of Poland, not to everybody.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: But it was definitely \u2014 I \u2014 I want to give you what was before the war. There\nwere some \u2014",
        "Q: Tell me before the war, mm-hm.",
        "A: Before the war there were some people extremist who were saying bi\u00e9 Zyda.",
        "Q: What does that mean?\nOctober 22, 2014",
        "A: Beat the Jew. That \u2014 those were extremists, but hardly ever. And so that was not\nshowing what the population was. But we have, don\u2019t buy in Jewish store. Last few\nyears we e \u2014 if we could avoid. And the reason was economic, because before\nPoland received independence into ninet \u2014 18 \u2014 Jewish people were taking part of\ncommerce. Because for a nobleman it was not nice, so if he brings some food,\nsomebody had to bring into the city. And that was what Jewish people were doing.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Then [indecipherable] Jewish population was very I-large. Out of 30 millions \u2014\nno, 33 million people we had before the war, three million were Jewish. Because\nwhen in the western Europe in, I don\u2019t know, 15\" 16 century, when there were a\nfight and they didn\u2019t wan \u2014 like Jewish people, Jewish people came, and apparently\njust past the e-e-eastern border of Poland there was a biggest population o-of\nJewish people, because we accepted them. So that was only when Poland get the\nindependence, and we started to modern life, somebody had to have the \u2014 the\nshopkeepers could not be only Jewish people. And because of that, Jewish people\nwere fighting the new stores. Of course, that was economic fight. The whole part of\nwas \u2014 some Jewish people were giving money to this storekeeper who was next to\nthe new Polish store \u2014 not Polish, Christian store. Jewish people were Polish people.\nBut they were giving him money, so Jewish store had everything cheaper. After a\nOctober 22, 2014\ntime, after a year or two, the other one has to close. Then, the prices in Jewish store\nwent up. That was known, and because of that we were, don\u2019t buy in Jewish store.\nBut that was not anti-Semitism. This was justified of \u2014 as I said, the noblemen,\nsince they gi \u2014 were giving to every son, then they were poorer and poorer. That\nwas a cul \u2014 sort of culture. But \u2014",
        "Q: I want to \u2014 I\u2014 I want to go to \u2014 I understand what you are explaining, but I\nwould like to \u2014 I would like to focus on, did this play out in your life at all? Did\nyour parents talk about such things when you were growing up, about \u2014 did you \u2014\nfor example, when you went with your servant \u2014 by the way, what was her name,\nthe servant?",
        "A: They change, from one to the other.",
        "Q: I see, so it wasn\u2019t always the same person.",
        "A: Yes, for 12 \u2014 12 years, there were two or three. The first one was the one which\nworked with my mother, providing lunches to people.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: So she was my \u2014 my nurse on the very beginning.",
        "Q: So \u2014 I mean, was \u2014 how did this play out when you were growing up? Did you\nknow there was a difference between Jewish children and your \u2014 and yourself,\noutside of the religions classes?\nOctober 22, 2014",
        "A: No, I knew something. For instance, I \u2014 I\u2019m \u2014 well, I live in commun \u2014\ncommunity where 1s a lot of Jewish people. There are two synagogues. For me it\nwas a surprise that there are different kind of Jewish \u2014 that they need two\nsynagogues close to each other.",
        "Q: That means in Bialystok?",
        "A: No, no, here.",
        "Q: Here, here, okay.",
        "A: In Silver Spring.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: I live in place where there\u2019s a lot of Jewish people. But, for instance, I knew tha\n\u2014 and I always wonder wha \u2014 from me to the closest synagogue is more that 1,000\npaces. And I learned that Jewish people cannot walk farther than 10,000 paces. So\nhow can stretch it? They don\u2019t drive, of course. They go \u2014 walk to synagogue. But I\nknew about that. I knew about matzah.",
        "Q: Mm-hm, about Passover, and [indecipherable]",
        "A: Ye-Yes, I like 1t very much. I didn\u2019t know that it\u2019s a religious, the triangular\ncake, but we had triangle ca-cakes with poppy seeds inside, and big one, no-not the\nshort one, but short like \u2014",
        "Q: I think these are called hamantashen, I\u2019m not exactly sure.\nOctober 22, 2014",
        "A: I\u2014I don\u2019t know, but I knew some things [indecipherable] that they had to wash\nthe \u2014 all the dishes somewhere. So, we knew a little bit of the Jewish culture. And\nof course, my parents were very much against us. That was just before the war,\nthere were some people who were against Jews very strongly, and my parents were\nsaying that it\u2019s \u2014 it was completely silly. When we had to, during the war, under the\nRussian occupation, we had to go to Warsaw, to German \u2014 Germany\n[indecipherable]. So, my mother went to a friend who was a doctor, and she gave\nmy mother a sign that my mother has a weak \u2014 weak heart, and have to stay at home\nfor three weeks. That was in case we would not be able to pass through Warsaw,\nand she would have to come back, so she will be able to get her job again. Of\ncourse, that was something what she \u2014 it was be punished by whatever, maybe\nsending to Siberia. But she gave it to my mother. So \u2014",
        "Q: And she was a Jewish lady?",
        "A: She was Jewish, yes.",
        "Q: Yes, I see.",
        "A: And also we have a doctor, h-he was Jewish. When we started to buy only in\nChristian stores, we didn\u2019t change him. So, it was a Jewish doctor. So I really\nbelieve strongly there was no anti-semit \u2014 anti-Semitism is always in all the world,\nbut in Poland it was not strong.\nOctober 22, 2014",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: But people believe right now, but taking a bad thing is very, very easy, and since\nSoviet Union were saying that everything is fault of Jewish people, and so you\nknow, it start.",

        "Q: Yeah, there was no such.\nOctober 22, 2014",
        "A: So, they were always talking. My father was very interested in social things. But\nI don\u2019t know \u2014",

In Poland \u2014 here you have the names \u2014 I\nwas So-so \u2014 it was so funny for me when I think he was the principal of the school\nsomewhere in Gloucester where I live years ago, and the street was named by him.\nAnd so there was something opening, and I shake his hand. Why it was so funny for\nme, because in Poland there is no \u2014 right now there 1s a lot of streets named by \u2014 by\nthe Pope. But otherwise \u2014 I don\u2019t know whether that changed, but in Bialystok,\nthere was a street named by Koseza(ph) Kowskei(ph) was mi \u2014 misa \u2014 some \u2014\nsomeone in government.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And my father objected to it. And because of that he lost his job, and for four\nyears \u2014 that was eight years before the war \u2014 for four years he could not find a job,\nand then all the savings are \u2014 went down. He had one job somewhere in Silesia, and\nhe \u2014 somehow he lost it, after he have a year. So it \u2014 we \u2014 we were really using all\nOctober 22, 2014\nthe savings. And then he got the job in Tarnopol, which is Ukraine right now in\nthat.",
        "Q: In tarno \u2014 in Tarnopol, yeah.",

        "A: And because of that he\u2019s \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 and that got him into trouble.",

Were they more on a liberal side, on a\u2014 ona\nsocialistic side? I \u2014 I only suggest that because you say they were for birth control.\nAnd in those years, very often \u2014",

        "A: Yes, yes, card game. And for a very small amount of money, but he also always\nwinning and bringing money home.",
        "Q: Really? So, he was good at it?",
        "A: [indecipherable] very little. But apart from that, he had nothing to do. So he was\napparently taking, at that time, everywhere in the country, people during the winter\nwere just suffering, because they had nothing to work, nothing to eat, and so on.\nAnd so he was supporting the peasant \u2014 peasants\u2019 art. And apparently there was a\nshop cl \u2014 something for that opened before the war, already for a few years. And\npeople were so grateful to my father, that they gave him an how \u2014 ho \u2014 handwoven\nOctober 22, 2014\ncarpet, which was, when I came here I saw something close by \u2014 close to it, it will\nbe a thousand or 2,000 dollars\u2019 worth here.",

But, so was sort of equality for\npeople, good, bad. Also the \u2014 I would say that it would be for everybody, strike\nyour own, and help other people.",
        "Q: So those were their values.",
        "A: It was not \u2014 it was the values \u2014 not socialist values.",

When Germans came, since that\nwas already hospital, Germans took it as a hospital for one week. And then they\nretreated because Russians were supposed to, according to Molotov-Ribbentrop,\nBialystok was supposed to be in Russian. So they retreated, and Russian took the\nhospital, and there was a hospital, with a vo \u2014 very good doctors.

        "A: Well, it was almost ev \u2014 empty, everything was sold, nothing brought in. So she\nsaid, I don\u2019t have anything, I \u2014 and only those pacifiers. And since there were 50\npacifiers, he bought 50 pacifiers. There were a time when we didn\u2019t have bread,\nwhen \u2014 and once we had halvah, you know what it is?\nOctober 22, 2014",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: We could buy a lot of halvah, and we were eating that halvah, because that\u2019s\nwhat brought to \u2014 was brought to Poland. And just the beginning of the war,\nRussians were going to the main square. In Poland there was \u2014 nuns had the\norphanage. And they were going to take the orphanage, the whole orphanage or\nsomething. That was one of the first ma-main thing. People learn about that,\neverybody came to that square.",
        "Q: Square.",
        "A: Thousands of people, and we didn\u2019t let Russians take the nuns out. My brother\nwas there, I wasn\u2019t.",

        "A: To take that orphanage somewhere, all children from the nuns. I don\u2019t know\nexactly what, but I know that we went. There\u2019s another thing. The \u2014 the first \u2014 first\nhalf year of the war, we were sent to different classes, mixed together. People were\nsaying \u2014 once my mother said, be very careful what you say, because somebody\nsaid that you said, when Polish ef \u2014 officers will come from Lithuania, we\u2019ll have\nfree Poland again. That was be for me, 12 year old, would be so stupid. But\nsomebody had to say something about me, and because that \u2014 they said that stupid\nthing. And my mu \u2014 somebody warned my mother, my mother say, be very careful\nOctober 22, 2014\nwhat you are saying. On the other hand, this first half a year again, we had in\nPoland, a cross in front of the class. We usually pray just before the classes and\nafter the school end. And Russians told to take the crosses out. No crosses in school.\nSo in my brother\u2019s school, they had the \u2014 not \u2014 not al-always one, but one of them\nwould bring a cross every day, put it there, take it down afterwards. But during the\nclasses, there was cross there. In my s \u2014 and in my school \u2014 and that was already\nmix, because I went to seventh grade from six, that was different school, and\nbecause of that, I knew half of half \u2014 they were specially mixed, so you will never\nknow. And once, we were finishing the class where would \u2014 we would say the\nprayer. And we were saying the prayer even when there was a \u2014I don\u2019t know\nwhether we had a cross, or there was no cross, but we were praying into that\ndirection. Oh, of course, in every class there was Stalin and somebody else there.",
        "Q: You mean the picture.",
        "A: Picture, yes.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: So us \u2014 one of the girls, and that\u2019s already in that mixed school, say, are you\ngoing to pray to the Stalin? And without anything we turn around, and then after\nthat, every day when we \u2014 was a prayer, we would stand up, turn around, so back to\nOctober 22, 2014\nthis \u2014 to Stalin. So, that\u2019s the atmosphere. But afterwards we were always afraid,\nafraid, afraid.",
        "Q: But I\u2019d like to ask this. You mentioned of a story of, you know, where a Russian\nofficer went \u2014 or Soviet officer went to a pharmacy. Did you see soldiers in the\nstreets? Did you see any that you had any contact with?",
        "A: They was \u2014 they were marching, the whole battalion or something, I don\u2019t know,\nand they were \u2014 were always singing. They sing beautifully, even in the army, they\nsing not one voice, but two voices.",
        "Q: In harmony, yeah, mm-hm.",
        "A: Like a choir. And I liked it, and I was so ashamed that I liked it. I was really\nashamed that I would.",

        "Q: I see.\nOctober 22, 2014",
        "A: And looking at my mother. Since she said so, I \u2014 I didn\u2019t know what it was.\nLater on, when I was grown up, I learned. I remember it. People, as people, were\npretty nice. Nobody complain about them. There were no \u2014 no excesses. But they\ndo what they were told to do the \u2014 and that one told us to get out of th \u2014 our house\nto somewhere else, because even Stalin doesn\u2019t live so luxurious we did.",
        "Q: And so, when did that happen? Did that happen soon after they came in?",
        "A: They have \u2014 they happen \u2014 that happened \u201939, or was it beginning of \u201940? I don\u2019t\nknow, but definitely I was in Bialystok less than a year.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: So that was beginning of the year.",

        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: He was going to sit there for the whole rest of the war, because Lithuania was\nnot in war. And then the Russians came to help the Lithuanians. And I don\u2019t know\nwhat month was that, February or March?",
        "Q: Oh, when they came to \u2014 that was pretty early on \u2014",
        "A: But it was \u2014",

And the Russians then came to the camp, and the camp was not big enough,\nso my father knew the names of other people, as well.

        "Q: And you were one of the five?",
        "A: Wa- one of the five. And the whole structure, wherever it was possible, was the\nfifth, because you expect that if somebody will be arrested a day or two, he may su-\nsurvive the tre \u2014",
        "Q: Torture?",
        "A: Torture. But you cannot count for always. And because of that, if it\u2019s only five\npeople who know each other, then you can told this for disappear, because\nsomebody is already there. And that way it was safer.",

And of course, if somebody will say anything, so in hospital you cannot\nrun away from it. So, he didn\u2019t have children \u2014 he survived the insurrection. Only\nhis wife, his second-in-command and I knew where he was. So if something were \u2014\nmessages to him were going through me. Because if, for instance, my father did not\nknow in hos \u2014 which hospital, nothing. So he was safe. He went out of the hospital,\nI think about a month before insurrection. And my biggest experience during the\ninsurrection was, I was just trying to find out what \u2014 we know the date, but what\nday of the week it was. It was \u2014 insurrection started Tuesday. And we have in the\nyard of the house where was the command, we have the mass for soldiers. So 1t was\nnot the first day. Is on a Sunday then. And after that he came to me and ask me, how\ndo you feel in free Poland? And I looked at them, I remember that I did not know\nwhat to say, and I don\u2019t remember wha \u2014 after that I say. But finally I realize, this\nlittle piece of land 1s free Poland. And for me the whole insurrection was because\nof that, I was in free Poland. People were dying around me, I could die as well, but\nthe \u2014 the important thing is, we are already in free Poland. That little piece is ours.\nAnd that changed my whole look at the \u2014 peoples say trad \u2014 tragedy, or something\nOctober 22, 2014\nlike that. To me it was something, fight in free Poland.

And he was killed by that.\nBut, it was right, they never knew what it. So I was in the insurrection up to the\nvery end. And when Polish people managed to get the \u2014 Germans called us bandits,\nbut [indecipherable] they really had trouble with us. We were prepared for, I think\nOctober 22, 2014\nthree days of fighting and three days of ammunition. I have to back then, year\nearlier, to Holocaust as well.",
        "Q: I want to talk about that.",
        "A: Yes \u2014",
        "Q: I want to talk about the ghetto.",
        "A: \u2014 definitely. But here I \u2014 I want to go to \u2014 to my little hero.",
        "Q: Okay, come \u2014",
        "A: We were sent to Sandbostel, my mother and I, and my father as well. Then, the\nofficers \u2014",
        "Q: What is Zen Boston, what is that?",
        "A: The name in Germany.",
        "Q: And what was it?",
        "A: The camp for \u2014 soldiers camp.",
        "Q: So you\u2019re talking about prisoner camp.",
        "A: Prisoner camp.",
        "Q: So you\u2019ve jumped between \u2014 you know, you had three days of ammunition left?",
        "A: Well \u2014",
        "Q: And then what happened?",
        "A: The insurrection was 63 days.\nOctober 22, 2014",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: And at the end of that, Germans wanted to get rid of us, so they said, we are not\nbandits, we\u2019re soldiers. And from that on, Germans treated us properly, definitely\nproperly, because we were in Sandbostel, somewheres and somewhere else. And\nmy father, from that camp went to Murnau, where is only for officers \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: \u2014 also. And I don\u2019t remember, but I think it was before the Christmas that we\nwere sent to Oberlangen. Oberlangen is close to border of Holland, with empty\nspace all around us. And they sent one after another, they sent women from other\nprisoners of war, which was definitely very safer for us. My father said that in\nSandbostel they were \u2014 Polish men were prepared that if we will be freed, they will\ntry to go at any place to our camp, our \u2014",
        "Q: Area.",
        "A: \u2014 area, because there are men who are four or five years without women. So\nGermans took all the women. Before that they ask who wants to work in th \u2014 in the\ncountry, or something. I think 1t was volunteer everywhere, that m-maybe there was\npressure on women, but definitely not pressure on the \u2014 physical pressure. No, not\nphysical pressure, psychological pressure. Because a lot of women from the\nprisoner of camp went to work somewhere. But we went, just sent to that one camp.\nOctober 22, 2014",
        "Q: I want to interrupt you just for a second, just so that we have the chronology\nright. The uprising starts on August 1\u201c, 1944, correct?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: It lasts for 63 days, which means that by early October it has been quashed, at\nwhich point you\u2019re taken prisoner \u2014",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: \u2014 and your mother is taken prisoner, and your father is taken prisoner.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Were you together at the time, all three of you, or were you separated?",
        "A: For a day or two we were together. We were marched, I think about 20\nkilometers to Ozarow, and then in a very big camp, and then men was separated\nfrom women.",
        "Q: And then you were \u2014",
        "A: But we were taken as ordinary soldiers, already.",
        "Q: And so then you were put on cattle cars, is that right, on trains to go to\nSandbostel\u2019?",
        "A: Oh yes, yes.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: That\u2019s not comfortable, but is nothing.\nOctober 22, 2014",
        "Q: So, when you get to Sandbostel, you are there for how long?",
        "A: Most likely before Christmas, but I\u2019m not sure whether it before or after\nChristmas. Then we were taken to Oberlangen, which was an empty space \u2014",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: \u2014 with only us.",
        "Q: Only women.",
        "A: Only women, from a different camp. I was in the second barrack.",
        "Q: And your \u2014 and this was still done by the Germans together, and this was done \u2014\ndid you know why they did this? What was the reasoning?",
        "A: Why they took all the women together?",
        "Q: And \u2014 yeah, and put them together?",
        "A: I\u2019m thinking because they thought that it was safer. They was done properly.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: And we were even received three \u2014 three times I think, a parcel from Red Cross.\nOn-Only three, usually it would be more, food or something. Once they sent\nhygienic things for women, and I learned then everybo \u2014 well, we had the little\nhospital there, for us, and so it was useful. But, more than half of women did not\nhave the usual period, because of the \u2014",
        "Q: Stress.\nOctober 22, 2014",
        "A: Not only stress, hunger.",
        "Q: Oh.",
        "A: We were given food, but Germans didn\u2019t have much of that. We had to work in\nthe kitchen for ourselves, so that\u2019s all again \u2014 according to a Geneva Convention.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: I cannot say that \u2014 somebody once said that it was a special camp or something.\nIt was the proper camp, they treated us properly. We had to go out to bring the\npotatoes, but I had unusual smell, and they ask me very often, what is in this soup?\nAnd I would say that the soup is with salt, or without. Sometimes they didn\u2019t have\nsalt. I cannot say more salty or less, but salt, or without salt, I could smell it at that\ntime. So they always ask me, I never made the mistake. So you see \u2014",
        "Q: That\u2019s amazing.",
        "A: \u2014 it was so little \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 that \u2014 that \u2014 well, we were doing everything. We could do during the day\nwhatever we wanted to. The restroom were outside, of course, not inside. And in\none empty hut there was water broken, and even the winter there, it was flowing\nthere, so we would go there, or something like that.",
        "Q: So the ice was broken, so there was some water.\nOctober 22, 2014",
        "A: No, it was broken, ne-never repaired.",
        "Q: Oh, you mean the fau \u2014",
        "A: But it was an empty one. So we were \u2014 walked around, there were ma-maybe 10\nhuts, and only four or five were occupied. Altogether we were close to 2,000, I\nbelieve. So \u2014",
        "Q: So how large was a hut? How many people fit into one hut?",
        "A: About 200. And it was three \u2014 well, three level of \u2014",
        "Q: Well, they were huts, rather than buildings?",
        "A: Of course, because \u2014 and we could wash at the end of the \u2014 but to the restroom,\nwe would have to go outside.",
        "Q: I see. I see.",
        "A: But three levels, and of course there were wood, and shins \u2014 wood planks, and in\nthe middle of it, there was a stove. And of course, from time to time we took one\nplank. And so sometimes it was difficult to sleep, no, not to fall down, because on\nthat we had shen-nikeetsa(ph), big bag with straw inside.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Okay.",
        "A: So \u2014 but \u2014 and how did I got the \u2014 it was close to Dutch border, I had wooden\nshoes, and for instance, one of my things was how to walk at night. How did I walk\nto that restroom there on night, so nobody would hear it? Try to walk in the wooden\nOctober 22, 2014\nshoes. So that was something what to occupy me, when we didn\u2019t had any pers \u2014\nanything, we learn history. I started to learn \u2014 I-I started to learn English before that,\nbut we had one book. It was [indecipherable] something like that, it \u2014 a some book\non lowest level, about some murder or something like that.",
        "Q: Like a detective novel or something?",
        "A: M-Most likely detective novel. But the three girls who we-were learning from\nsomebody who knew that, were on much better progress, so I was learning what is\nhere, there, at, and things like that.",
        "Q: So they were learning English from the detective novel?",
        "A: Yes, because we had that detective novel. And it\u2019s still \u2014 in Sandbostel we used\nto walk up and down the corridor there. There we were 1n such a crowd that when\nwe were sleeping on the floor, if we want to turn around, everybody would have to\nturn around. But there was a corridor on which we could not walk during the night,\nbut during the day. And I and two other girls who were learning English \u2014 English\nwas not popular in before the war, only French and German. Russian, we had to\nlearn later, but wasn\u2019t popular. But anyway, so we were talking the whole Polish\nsentence with one word English which we knew, not to forget. But then in\nOberlangen it was already something like that. And of course if we were bored,\nOctober 22, 2014\nand if somebody knew something about the subject, there was a conference about\nthat and everybody would cool \u2014 come and so it was ordinary \u2014",
        "Q: Prisoner of war \u2014",
        "A: Prisoner of war camp.",
        "Q: \u2014 camp.",
        "A: And definitely Germans treated \u2014 well, sometimes we, if they couldn\u2019t count\ncorrect \u2014 nobody run away from the camp, I don\u2019t think so. But if they couldn\u2019t\ncount everybody, because everybody would have to come \u2014",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: \u2014 but somebody sick maybe, we could stand for two or three hours. But that\u2019s the\nusual in camp. Opposite us, opposite this four or five huts, were the others, and\nthere was that little hospital, which we had for \u2014 and also, during that morning and\nevening \u2014",
        "Q: Appel?",
        "A: \u2014 count of us, there were boys. There were soldiers. They were \u2014 the oldest one,\nmost likely 12 or 13, and he would say, on top, march, look that, and so on, because\nthey have to be counted. They were soldiers. In my hut, there were two sisters \u2014",
        "Q: Also, prisoners of war.",
        "A: Yes, prisoners of war.\nOctober 22, 2014",
        "Q: Prisoner of war, too, okay.",
        "A: They were, definitely.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And in my camp, I learned later that bo-both went to Israel. We knew they were\nJewish, we can hear a Jewish accent. It\u2019s a some sort of accent, I don\u2019t know\nwhether I would be able to recognize right now. Jewish people had that accent, and\nthe best educated had the best Polish, no accent at all. You hear the much better\npronunciation that others. But the just ordinary people had some sort of accent\nwhich we could recognize. They definitely had, and the older one looked like\nJewish girl. So \u2014 with the f-face. Nobody ever mentioned that they were Jewish, of\ncourse, because we never knew whether they \u2014 even as prisoner of war, whether\nthey would not be taken out. And I was talking to that little one. I think that she was\nabout 10. Apparently, she joined the insurrection, and was a messenger, as I was.\nAnd she said her biggest trouble was that when she was sent with messages to\npeople [indecipherable] somewhere in there, and she should not ask people where\nto go if she mistake it. And she could not read, so she was putting the messages in\nbetween her fingers to remember to whom she has to go and show, if she ge-get\nmore.",
        "Q: She didn\u2019t know how to read?\nOctober 22, 2014",
        "A: No. Apparently she was in ghetto. There was no schools. Because she must have\nbeen \u2014",
        "Q: Very little.",
        "A: \u2014 at least nine, but I think she was about 10. And so that\u2019s was a soldier, that\u2019s\nmy little hero \u2014 hero.",
        "Q: Aye aye, aye aye. So she would in \u2014 because she didn\u2019t know how to read, she\nwould put \u2014",
        "A: She was putting in t \u2014 in between her fingers to remember, because she could not\nask somebody on the street. She would never know who is that person. So, what she\ndid before, for that year, I don\u2019t know. Maybe she was singing in the streetcars, or\nso on. There were some songs against Germans, which the \u2014 the streetcars were so\ncrowded, and nobody would s \u2014 would [indecipherable] anything. What they did\nbefore, I did not ask. And apparently \u2014 I don\u2019t think that she would be alone with\nher sister. I don\u2019t know whether it was her sister, they used the same name, last\nname. But they were so different. One was \u2014 my little hero was blonde, and the\nother one was dark. Everybody liked the little one, we didn\u2019t like very much the\nother one. They completely different. Most likely they just lived together, maybe\nthey were sisters, I don\u2019t know. But definitely \u2014 I don\u2019t remember where I heard,\nthere was a list of people who \u2014 women who were in the camp. But then with the\nOctober 22, 2014\nage, but I couldn\u2019t find someones who would be \u2014 I didn\u2019t know exactly what their\nage. But le \u2014",
        "Q: Were there more Jewish young women who were in the ca \u2014 in this prisoner of\nwar camp?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know definitely. I\u2019m sure that there were more, but this two were in the\nhut where I was, and I \u2014 somehow I talked with that \u2014 that little one.",
        "Q: And do you remember her name?",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. And the \u2014 and back in Warsaw, during the insurrection and even\nbefore in the resistance activities, did \u2014 did you see any people who were Jewish,\nwho were part of these activities?",
        "A: No, I was not close to it.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: People in France, for instance, people would be punished, but not us in Poland.\nIn Poland you must have heard about many people who kept Jewish people hiding.\nAnd if they would find, the whole family, including small children, would be killed.\nI was not close to that. Now, I lived in Warsaw, very close to ge \u2014 ghetto.",
        "Q: Tell me, what did you see there?",
        "A: Excuse me?\nOctober 22, 2014",
        "Q: When you lived close to the ghetto, what did you remember seeing?",
        "A: That I have to tell you, the ghetto was fighting. First of all, there was a very big\nwall with the barb wire \u2014",
        "Q: Barbed wire, yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 on top of that. I think eight feet, or something like that. On the other side I was\nwalking very often Zelazna.",
        "Q: Zelazna, mm-hm.",
        "A: And so that was \u2014 and I think, but right now I don\u2019t remember, but I think that\nthe gate, very often before the insurrection in \u2014 1n the ghetto, the little children\nsometimes were walking here and there, maybe begging or something, and I think\nthat Germans allowed that.",
        "Q: To walk outside the gate, into the \u2014",
        "A: A little bit.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: A few steps. But I don\u2019t really know whether I remember it right. I think that it\nwas that it was possible.",
        "Q: Were you ever inside the ghetto?",
        "A: No, why?",
        "Q: Well, sometimes when you \u2014\n101October 22, 2014",
        "A: I wouldn\u2019t get out.",
        "Q: Yeah. In the early days I have had some other people say there were streetcars\nthat would go through, and so they could take the streetcar in. But that was in the\nearly days of the ghetto.",
        "A: There was small ghetto and big ghetto.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember next to Zelazna where I was walking, whether that was big or\nlittle one, right. And in between there was a street, so you could see it, and people\ncould go from one ghetto to another over that. And that was \u2014 now, one of them, the\none which was farther away from me, started to fight a few days earlier, I don\u2019t\nremember. And then I was walking \u2014 we were shocked [indecipherable] we knew\nthat they cannot survive, nothing will \u2014 there was a Polish underground and Jewish\nunderground, there were some connection, but we didn\u2019t have a lot of ammunition\nor anything, even for \u2014 for our-ourselves, so we didn\u2019t have later. So we couldn\u2019t\nhelp, we just had to look helplessly. And we were sorry, looking at \u2014 at people who\nwere dying there. But on the very beginning, on that \u2014 that other ghetto, other part\nwas fighting and this one not. When I was going through Zelazna street, and over\nthat big wall, I could see a woman \u2014 it was April, it was warm enough, she was\nlooking through the window down there. They were not fighting. And she was\n102October 22, 2014\nmaybe even smiling. She was definitely not \u2014 not horrified, not frightened. She was\ntalking to somebody with \u2014 it couldn\u2019t \u2014 you couldn\u2019t say joy, I \u2014 I don\u2019t have the\nword for that. But I was horrified. How could she be so calm, when she 1s going to\ndie pretty soon? Where her people are dying? It took me a few years to understand\nthat she was proud. She knew what\u2019s waiting for her, and I s \u2014 I still can see her\nhow it was, and she took it nicely. She was glad that \u2014 that they fighting and not \u2014\nnot allowing to be martyred by \u2014 by themselves. It \u2014 it give me a \u2014 an impression,\nbecause we were horrified.",
        "Q: Well, that stayed with you.",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: That image has stayed with you.",
        "A: A few weeks or months later, my father \u2014 I used to go by streetcar next to all get\n\u2014 the ghetto was always closed to us, afterwards as well. There was streetcar, and he\nsaid, don\u2019t go by streetcar today, not this one, because Germans put \u2014 hung some\npeople and so high, so you could see it from streetcar, and there were dead people\nthere. So Germans weren\u2019t nice to us. And we learn only that during the\ninsurrection, that there was a prison there, and some people were \u2014",
        "Q: Were hung? Were executed?",
        "A: Re-Rescued then.\n103October 22, 2014",
        "Q: Ah, I see.",
        "A: And we didn\u2019t know that there was a prison there.",
        "Q: Which prison was it? There\u2019s a Pawiak prison, I remember.",
        "A: No, no, Pawiak, he was somewhere else. It was after \u2014 after ghetto da \u2014 it was \u2014\nafter the Holocaust \u2014",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: \u2014 there was a prison there.",
        "Q: Within the \u2014 within the area of what the ghetto had been?",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: I see. Had you \u2014 you know, did people outside the ghetto know of the transports?\nThat is that \u2014",
        "A: On the very beginning, we didn\u2019t. I knew quite a lot because of my father pretty\nhigh position in \u2014 in the army. So, for instance, when Russians were coming and are\nclose to Wilno, people were saying we\u2019re Armia Kryova. At first they were treated\nnicely, but then they were prison there, something. So, before the insurrection, we\nknew already what was really expecting us, that unless we\u2019ll be strong enough to\nget Warsaw before the Russians would come in, but they stop, and they didn\u2019t want\nthe allies to \u2014 to come in London, whatever, once more they \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.\nOctober 22, 2014",
        "A: \u2014 they did whatever they \u2014",
        "Q: Excuse me for a second, we\u2019ve got people talking out here. [break] We\u2019re going\n\u2014 we\u2019re going to repeat some of the things we were talking about now, because\nthere was some background noise. I was asking you, did you know of \u2014 of\ntransports of Jews outside of the ghetto, while you were in Warsaw proper. What\nwas happening to them?",
        "A: Maybe later we knew. On the very beginning, nobody knows. When ghetto was\nstarting, some couple which were Christian and Russian \u2014 and Jewish, they could\nchoose the \u2014 at least the wife could stay outside. They usually would choose to go\nto ghetto together \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 because nobody expected that. They expected that people will be separated,\nbut not that. Later they knew and most likely we know. But for quite a time Jewish\npeople didn\u2019t know that when there 1s a transport, the transport is to be killed.",
        "Q: So did you know the na \u2014 did the \u2014 did the terms Auschwitz mean something in\n1942 and 1943? Did the term Treblinka mean something?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know when it\u2019s come. Before the insurrection, before the ghetto up-\nuprising, we already knew, but \u2014",
        "Q: Okay.\n105October 22, 2014",
        "A: \u2014 how long before that, I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: Okay. Okay.",
        "A: Because we \u2014 we knew that German want to kill all the Jewish people.",
        "Q: So you did know that. You did know that there was \u2014 there was \u2014",
        "A: But not on the very beginning.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: On the very beginning we didn\u2019t.",
        "Q: Did you ever, or did your father ever see any Jews being taken from the ghetto to\nthe train station for such a transport?",
        "A: No, no, no, no.",
        "Q: No, no.",
        "A: And I never \u2014 well, walking around in there, there was that gate. I never seen it,\nno.",
        "Q: Okay, okay.",
        "A: So, most likely they were already driven by some \u2014 something. I don\u2019t know.\nNo.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: So during the war I was not involved with any Jewish peop \u2014 person trying to get\naway, or anything like that. I think that I knew the name of a person who was most\n106October 22, 2014\nactive in ghetto. If you say the name I will tell you that, yes. But \u2014 so we know that\nthere is a underground there, but we knew that everybody is helpless. The \u2014 our\ninsurrection was prepared for three days only, because we didn\u2019t have the\nammunition for everything.",
        "Q: Oh, so when you were telling me about three days, it \u2014 and it ended up being 63\ndays \u2014",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: That\u2019s what you were explaining. Got it.",
        "A: Yes. Some was taken from Germans, some was \u2014 but very little from the \u2014 being\nthrown by allies, but not Russians. The Russians, on the very end, helped and they s\n\u2014 threw some bread, I had some bread.",
        "Q: Oh really? Some bread?",
        "A: Yes. Completely dry.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: We were hungry, but it was the ammunition which we needed. And they did not\nlet the allies planes land on their side. And because of that there was a lot of people\nlost because of that.",
        "Q: So, were \u2014 were \u2014",
        "A: Russians stopped, because they wanted us to be killed.\n107October 22, 2014",
        "Q: Y-You mean the Russian forces were already at Warsaw and they \u2014",
        "A: Close to Warsaw \u2014",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: \u2014 yes, and they stopped.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: The \u2014",
        "Q: And had the \u2014 and were the insurrections, the people from the uprising, were\nthey expecting the Russians to come over the \u2014 and help out?",
        "A: Definitely, because they were our allies. We were not in good \u2014 in terms with \u2014\nwith them, because of Katyn, and that time only Katyn, not \u2014 not the other camps.\nSo it was broken without us, but I think [indecipherable] went to see Stalin just\nbefore that, and Stalin didn\u2019t say anything. And no di \u2014 they were definitely wanted\nus to \u2014 to be killed off.",
        "Q: So tell me a little bit \u2014 I'd like to get a sense of how \u2014 by the time the news about\nKatyn was revealed, when the Germans found the site of the massacre of the 4,000\nPolish soldiers \u2014 Polish military men, were you already in Warsaw?",
        "A: I was in Warsaw, I don\u2019t remember when it was.",
        "Q: Do you remember learning about Katyn in \u2014 while you were in Warsaw\u201d\n108October 22, 2014",
        "A: Straightaway, because we knew. The Germans allowed the Polish Red Cross,\nbecause they wanted everybody to know what Russians did.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: So, there was all the news we knew, and since people were killed in \u2014 with their\nall uniform, there were some papers and things like that, so \u2014",
        "Q: So they had identification with them.",
        "A: Identification. We had not di \u2014 doubts that it was the Russians who did it.",
        "Q: And were you working at the Red Cross when this news came in, or was this\nbefore that time?",
        "A: I think it was later, could have been later. I don\u2019t remember when it was.",
        "Q: Okay. And you mentioned to me earlier when we were not taping, that your\nfather recognized some names. Can you tell me about that?",
        "A: First of all, the \u2014 he was the first one to sign that he wants to come back to his\nfamily. And \u2014",
        "Q: That\u2019s when he\u2019s still in Lithuania.",
        "A: In Lithuania.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And then the first transport went out, and he was not on that, so he went back to,\nmost likely the camp \u2014 Polish people in the camp, who signed him, and he said,\n109October 22, 2014\nwhy not I should be? And then in the third one, I\u2019m sure that he knew the names,\nbecause there was a ter \u2014 transport from there. I think that Katyn was not only from\nhis camp, but from the others as well.",
        "Q: Course.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know what the name of his camp was, but definitely he was\nin the second transport, not the first one.",
        "Q: Okay, and so when \u2014 when you learned about Katyn \u2014",
        "A: We knew what it was.",
        "Q: Yes \u2014",
        "A: Only then we learned, because we \u2014 before that we didn\u2019t know.",
        "Q: Did he recognize some of the names of the people?",
        "A: Yes, he did.",
        "Q: I see. So when he \u2014 when the identification list was made, he recognized that\nsome of these people had been in this camp with him?",
        "A: Yes, because he would not know that the \u2014 there was a thir \u2014 third transport.\nThey could be from everywhere, but he recognized it \u2014 he knew that third one went\nthere as well.",
        "Q: I see, I see. So there was no \u2014 no doubt in your minds that this was not just\nGerman propaganda, this was actually true.\n110\nOctober 22, 2014",
        "A: We knew, we knew, because Germans wanted everybody to know, and because\nof that they allowed the Red Cross, Polish Red Cross to go there.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And recognize. And there were letters and [indecipherable]. Yes, we knew.",
        "Q: So let\u2019s go back to Oberlangen, where you are, you know, you\u2019re \u2014 you\u2019re there\nwith about 2,000 other women, prisoners of war, and it\u2019s now like the winter of\n1945, the war is coming to an end. Did people in the camp n \u2014 have that feeling that\nit\u2019s not going to be a lot \u2014 long now before it\u2019s all over?",
        "A: Yes, we believe that. And it was funny incidents, there were people in Polish\narmy under British command, and they stopped not close to our camp, and Germans\nask, why do you stop here for the night? Why your women are there? Because\nGermans knew. And so they went. I think we were rescued about five or six o\u2019clock\nin the afternoon, because they did not know that there was camps.",
        "Q: So you were liberated by Polish forces?",
        "A: Polish forces, yes.",
        "Q: Oh, that must have been something.",
        "A: And that was before the end of the war, about a month, I think about a month. It\nwas April.",
        "Q: It was April?\n111\nOctober 22, 2014",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Okay. So that\u2019s the first time you\u2019re free.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Aside from the time you were in free Poland in that little courtyard.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: This is when you were \u2014 what happened to you? What did \u2014 what \u2014",
        "A: Well, after we learn in July that my s \u2014 most likely it was beginning of August\nthat we learned that he died, on 27 of July, we decided to go and join our Anders\u2019\nArmy in Italy. And the detail \u2014",
        "Q: Excuse me, I\u2019m sorry. Your mother was with you in Oberlangen?",
        "A: Yes, and my \u2014",
        "Q: And where was your father?",
        "A: \u2014 father came.",
        "Q: To Oberlangen?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Okay, mm-hm.",
        "A: Just to tell the news.",
        "Q: Okay.\n112October 22, 2014",
        "A: And we went there, and it was the last month when somebody could still join the\narmy. The Anders\u2019 Army was mainly from Siberia, but also quite a lot of people\ncame who were taken to German army, and they would go through the \u2014 to Polish \u2014\nPolish people who were under the occupied person, and they were forcibly joined\nthe German army. So a lot of people came like that, to them. But, since the war was\nover, they was not taking any new people. But \u2014 and at that time we could not go to\nEngland. My brother was trying and didn\u2019t before he \u2014 he died. And so we\u2019re \u2014 we\nwere in Italy. I was in Porto San Giorgio, and that was [indecipherable] Italy.\nAnd there was a school for girls who didn\u2019t finish. So there were some from the\nPolish insurrection, some were through ho \u2014 went through Siberia. One of my\nfriend was a tall, well-built woman \u2014 girl, at that time. She was in Siberia, she was\nworking in the forest cutting the trees. So that\u2019s not exactly a woman job.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: But otherwise we \u2014 we didn\u2019t talk a lot. One was \u2014 most of them were driving\ntrucks to supply there. And one of them said that when it was very hot, th-they\nwould put wet sheets on them to \u2014 to cool themselves. But otherwise they didn\u2019t say\nhow \u2014",
        "Q: What their Siberian experiences were, huh?",
        "A: No, no.\n113October 22, 2014",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Nothing like that.",
        "Q: But it brought you all so much together, all these people who had such different\n\u2014 different destinies, different hardships, different \u2014",
        "A: And we didn\u2019t talk about our experiences at all. It was the school and what \u2014\nhow to do it. And under the \u2014 under our school, there were food magazines. And so\nwe had lot of rats. And in Italy you have, in Polish it\u2019s [indecipherable] it\u2019s a sort\nof \u2014 something like a \u2014 a \u2014 over your bed when you sleep, so \u2014",
        "Q: A mosquito net.",
        "A: Mo-Mosquito net. And she put her leg out, and the rat bit her once. My other\nexperience from there was I couldn\u2019t sleep, I went there, and down there, there was\n\u2014 we have military in \u2014 people who were taking care of the food under that, and th \u2014\nabout us, and somebody who was passing by, another soldier, came and say, oh\nwell, you have a good \u2014 so many women around you. And he th \u2014 the one who was\nthere said no, there are good people, good women there.",
        "Q: So, in other words, there were people who were looking at you in a different\nway.\n114October 22, 2014",
        "A: Well, some other people thought that well, when there are women and whatever\nhappened. But no \u2014 no, it was \u2014 it was not. And the man who \u2014 who was there said\nso. So I heard it. But \u2014",
        "Q: We \u2014 were these soldiers?",
        "A: Yes, Polish soldiers.",
        "Q: Both pole \u2014 yeah.",
        "A: Polish soldiers.",
        "Q: I-I have a question about \u2014 about General Anders\u2019 Army. Why would people be\njoining the army, his army, after the war 1s over? What would have been the reason\nfor that?",
        "A: We didn\u2019t want to go to Soviet Poland. Poland was not free.",
        "Q: So in other words, it would have been now to fight the Soviets?",
        "A: Well, there were some \u2014 I think my daughter-in-law father was in Poland still,\nafter the war, after the insurrection, and he was fighting there. How he got out, I\ndon\u2019t know, because we didn\u2019t talk about those things. But he was one who was still\nfighting Germans and Russians and he \u2014 he was a \u2014 we did not fight Russians,\nbecause they were allies, so he was still fighting Germans. And there were some\npeople left and in Poland a lot was arrested and killed and so on.",
        "Q: By?\nOctober 22, 2014",
        "A: It\u2019s not \u2014 not \u2014 for us, the war did not stop there, even for somebody \u2014 we could\nchoose to go out of Warsaw as a prisoner or war, or as a civilian. And many people\ndecided to go as civilian. If they were found later by Russians that they were in the\nunderground army, they would be arrested, killed.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: So-",
        "Q: So even though they were allies, having fought in an underground army, they\nwere threats.",
        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: They were not.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: This \u2014 right now when I am looking at the Ukraine it\u2019s exactly what\u2019s happen in\n\u00b039 in Poland, [indecipherable] their people.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Whatever. They don\u2019t mind. So \u2014",
        "Q: What happened to you after Italy? What \u2014 what happened after that?\n116October 22, 2014",
        "A: After a year I wanted so much to go to England when my brother was alive \u2014 we\nhad to go to England and to be resettled. So I was in the camp there, and another\nyear of school, and so I have my matriculation in Polish system. And \u2014",
        "Q: So in other words, you, while your brother was alive, he wasn\u2019t able to get you\nto England \u2014",
        "A: But then I had to \u2014",
        "Q: \u2014 but after he died, you could go.",
        "A: [had to go. After a year, all the Polish soldiers were there, and tried to be\nresettled there.",
        "Q: I see. Was there any effort to resettle you into Poland?",
        "A: Whoever want to go, could go. And out of \u2014 we were in [indecipherable] this is\n\u2014 there were about 30 girls in [indecipherable]. Two of them went. And if you\nconsider that they were mostly young women, because it was the \u2014 we were in\nschool, so it was from say 16 to 20, 22, only two decided to go to Poland.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And that was why there are so many people stayed outside. We didn\u2019t recognize\nthe Poland as it was.",
        "Q: Yeah.\nOctober 22, 2014",
        "A: And I ne \u2014 I thought I send my children when they were grown up, to Poland.\nMy oldest one, I told him, if somebody will ask you something, answer in English,\nnot in Polish, so they will treat you as a foreigner. Because that was at the time\nwhen it \u2014 it could be dangerous, I didn\u2019t know. He was 16 at that time. But I never\nexpected that I will be able to go to Poland. So, we never expected that, and we \u2014\nwe didn\u2019t expect that at our lifetime, Poland will be free.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: But right now 1s still after Ukraine, what would be next is Lithuania, and\nPoland, they \u2014 they were mentioning that at \u2014 at first. But both Lithuania and\nPoland are in Europe right now \u2014",
        "Q: In the European Union.",

        "Q: I want to ask about then your later, your parents, did they go to England with\nyou?",
        "A: Yes, yes, because they were in the army.",

And\nmy father, he was going to be sort of expert.

        "A: Somehow I\u2019m dissatisfied with people who right now go out and there\u2019s no \u2014 not\nenough work in Poland, so when they can go anywhere in Europe to \u2014 to work,\nthey do. I \u2014 they don\u2019t really think of coming back. They don\u2019t think really that they\nshould belong to Poland and not to be outside this. And it seems to me they\u2019re \u2014\nthey\u2019re a completely different generation. I lived in free Poland, which was under\n150 years when we were not free. And right now some people are \u2014 in Poland are\n124October 22, 2014\nmixed up, and they don\u2019t recognize that they were not free under the Soviet\noccupation. There is a lot of progress in the country, as I \u2014 I think I mentioned to\nyou that my brother wanted to go on the bicycle to \u2014 from Bialystok to Warsaw.\nAnd that half of main road was paved and some half wasn\u2019t. Right now, even in the\nvillage where my mother lived there, everything is paved. There is electricity. Right\nnow there are a lot of trees, say cherry trees, which are si \u2014 small. So it\u2019s easy to\npick. So you have to \u2014",
        "Q: They\u2019ve been \u2014 they\u2019ve been raised that way, yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 start \u2014 raised like not \u2014 not only it\u2019s a different kind of cherries, not the big\none. So that had to be change, you don\u2019t change it from year to year, you have to do\nit. And there, in that village where my mother was teaching, there was about 2,000\npeople, and one \u2014 one with higher education only. So education was allowed, but\nalso some people were pushed, and they should not have the \u2014 that higher\neducation. But definitely everybody has the \u2014 much more opportunity. So, the\nvillages went up, and because of that, some people from there don\u2019t feel that we\nwere not free for so many years. We \u2014 us being outside, we knew what was\nhappening. They accepted what it was, and it wasn\u2019t a free Poland. So \u2014",
        "Q: And so you\u2019d want people to have a \u2014 have a greater understanding of what\nfreedom means.\n125October 22, 2014",
        "A: Yes. And maybe it\u2019s coming. Some people say that schools are not as \u2014 as good\nas it used to be. I know from my mo-mother that after we got independence in\n[indecipherable] the schools were \u2014 they were supposed to be like the schools in\nSwitzerland. That was the example for us. But my mother wa-was going with some\ninspector, wh-who \u2014 who he was I don\u2019t know, about once a year for three days, to\ndifferent schools in the country, where the teacher would have to pass an exam to be",
        "Q: A teacher, yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 a teacher there. So some people were not very well educated, and the schools\nwent \u2014 the level of schools went up and apparently they say that right now is going\ndown. I don\u2019t know why.",
        "Q: It happ \u2014 you know, the \u2014 it still 1s countries in development, after \u2014 after such\nchanges, it takes a while for \u2014 for systems to work, and to improve.",
        "A: Yes. There \u2014 right now there are changes there \u2014 in Poland, children start at\nseven, they start at six or something. And they \u2014 I don\u2019t understand what, but \u2014",
        "Q: I wanted to ask \u2014 yeah.",
        "A: \u2014 something is not \u2014 not very good.",
        "Q: I wanted to ask this question in a different way. What would you want young\npeople, and younger generations from other countries: from the United States, from\n126October 22, 2014\nCanada, from the U.K., from Germany, and even from Russia, and from countries\noutside of the European experience, what would you want the children of these\ncountries to understand what you and your family, and the people in Bialystok, and\nthe people in Warsaw went through? What do you think you\u2019d like them to be able\nto get about that?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think they would learn by themselves if the \u2014 if something will happen.\nBut what I am not \u2014 people \u2014 other people are always dissatisfied, I don\u2019t like\nwhat\u2019s right now common in the world that the countries are not religious countries.\nPoland was definitely Catholic country, but there was tolerance to everybody. And\nas I said, th-the kids who were going out of religious classes, they enjoyed that. And\nthey could stay and learn.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Not pray, but learn.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: And it seems to me that only religion, when you believe \u2014 we believe in the same\nGod, only different, and of course, I \u2014 I believe it is better than [indecipherable].\nBut is the same God. And people need to \u2014 to believe in God, whatever it is. If they\ndon\u2019t know, they even form belief that in several gods, or whatever, I don\u2019t know\nwhat Buddhists believe, and so on. But there is a tolerance, and it was tolerance in\n127October 22, 2014\nPoland. But here, right now, I \u2014 I \u2014 is my \u2014 my own saying, that et \u2014 atheists are not\ntolerant. They cannot tolerate cross somewhere on the street and somewhere.\nMaybe they feel guilty that they don\u2019t believe in God, but I don\u2019t see tolerance in\nthis country, and everywhere. And Poland right now is \u2014 1s separate of state and \u2014\nand \u2014 and I think it\u2019s going the same direction, lack of tolerance. And I\u2019m very\ndissatisfied with that, so I don\u2019t know whether people can change it again, back to\nreligious tolerance. Well, we have Muslims in Poland, some gathering, they \u2014 they\nhave the \u2014 right now they moved from east to west and so on, so it\u2019s more difficult,\nbut those people were \u2014 Poland was always fighting Turks and \u2014 and Tartars, they\nwere Muslims. So those people were taken prisoners, or were \u2014 they were always \u2014\nthey started as our enemies, fighting us. And right now we consider them just any\nother people. We don\u2019t have problem with \u2014 with Muslims right now in Poland.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: But we are tolerant to any religious, and it seems to me that if \u2014 well, with\nMuslims it\u2019s difficult because not all of them are \u2014 are fighting.",
        "Q: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: But it seems to me I would like young people to believe that religion is the base\nof the social work.",
        "Q: Okay.\n128October 22, 2014",
        "A: Social \u2014",
        "Q: Cohesion, in some ways.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Of society.",
        "A: But that\u2019s my thing. I-I don\u2019t know what else I would like for the children, I\ndon\u2019t \u2014 I do want them to \u2014 to believe in God.",

        "A: And I was completely sure that he was much brighter than I was. So \u2014 but the\nteacher was giving the boy less than me.",
        "A: She was divorced and my mother said that she didn\u2019t like the boys. But an-\nanyway, she recognize him and very often when the war in Spain started \u2014\nOctober 22, 2014",

        "A: He was really a bright boy. Now, there was one child who was a \u2014 e-easter\nOrthodox. The \u2014 so three out of about 40. Our classes were large because it was \u2014\nthe school was called Treitanufka(ph), something what you learn how to do it. So\nthey \u2014",
        "A: Vo \u2014 it was vocation for the teacher. The mother \u2014 my mother was teaching the\ngrades. And the [indecipherable] pedagogic.",
        "A: Yes, and those teachers had to learn on us. And since in the country there were\nbig classes \u2014 usually, I think, in Poland were, in cities it will be 30 in class. But in\nours 1t was 40, and once I was 1n a connected school, connected class, third and\nfourth grade together, 60 kids all together, so the teacher would learn how to do it.\nOnly one year like that. So, there were big classes. And out of our 40, there were\nOctober 22, 2014\nthree children who had the option \u2014 there was Catholic religion I think twice a week\nfor an hour \u2014 they could stay, or they could go out. That was not discrimination,\nthey a -\u2014 all \u2014 all the children were very, very glad to leave and do whatever they\nwant.",
        "A: No, that was definitely not discrimination, they could stay and learn. Our \u2014 for\ninstance, we start with the prayer. They would not have to pray with us, only they\nhave to stand up on the very beginning and the very end of the school. But they\nwould have to pass religion to pass to the next grade. So \u2014",
        "A: Their own religion. So the rabbi has to say that they passed the religion for the,\nsay second grade, before they will go to the third. But what they learn, that was his\nonly. He did not have to say what he consider good for the second grade.",
        "A: Yes.",

        "A: No. I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. But there was a joke after the Russians came in, that people used\nto say when they were in White Russia or Ukraine \u2014 we call it White Russia \u2014",
        "A: That they lived Bialosc(ph).",
        "A: I can\u2019t pronounce it properly. They used to say that we\u2019re local, we\u2019re local. And\nthey say afterwards that Polish people wanted \u2014 for 20 years wanted to make them\nPolish and they didn\u2019t, but the Russians came and did it in two weeks.",

        "A: Yes, tutejszy it\u2019s local, yes",
        "A: Mm-hm, mm-hm.",
        "A: Well, because it was under Russia, Poland doesn\u2019t exist for 150 years, and they\nfelt Polish, so \u2014",
        "A: Kind of Polish.",
        "A: They knew that the \u2014 the others are strangers, the others are occupa \u2014 occupants.",

        "A: My parents were not. They treat \u2014 well, I think that the \u2014 the problem was that\nthey believed in regulation of birth, and that\u2019s against the ga \u2014 Catholic church.\n[indecipherable]\nOctober 22, 2014",
        "A: Birth control. I believe that was the reason, but I don\u2019t know. But they kept us,\nwe were going to \u2014 to church every Sunday, and \u2014 and well, th-they try not to talk\nabout that, but because of they believe in bir-birth control, they didn\u2019t try to go to\nchurch and pretend that they are good Catholics.",
        "A: Yes, yes. There is only one thing. My mother told me that once a woman came\nto her and said, I don\u2019t want my child to be in a religion class. And my mother said,\nwhat \u2014 well, I\u2019m an athe \u2014 atheist. So all through those years my mother was\n[indecipherable] something. There was one atheist.",
        "A: And of course her child, who would not go to religion class because that was \u2014\nonly she could not provide a certificate of any religion that he passed. So he was not\nlearning.",
        "A: But one in years. So at that time it wasn\u2019t, it was la \u2014 and there is one other\nthing, people av \u2014 who say about anti-Semitism in Poland. | believe that there was\nno \u2014 not really anti-Semitism. It wa \u2014 came during the war, brought by Soviet\nOctober 22, 2014\nUnion. My husband was a mathematician, and he knew a mathematician in Poland\nwho was very distinct in \u2014 in Warsaw Polytechnic. | forgot his name right now.\nAnd he was very respected, s-some grand or something like that, one year, and the\nsecond year they told him to get out of Poland, they allowed him. But he was\nmarried to a Catholic woman and had Catholic child. So he was expelled and not\n[indecipherable]",
        "A: That was during the war. And he lived with us, he came to United States, he\nlived with us for a week or two. And right now, if he\u2019s alive, he\u2019s still teaching in\nan \u2014 Ann Arbor. But that came, that one year everything was \u2014 was bad, it was\nsupposed to be bad because of Jewish people. And I think something was bad,\npeople can\u2019t take very easily. So most likely right now there is the real anti-\nSemitism in part of Poland, not to everybody.",
        "A: But it was definitely \u2014 I \u2014 I want to give you what was before the war. There\nwere some \u2014",
        "A: Before the war there were some people extremist who were saying bi\u00e9 Zyda.\nOctober 22, 2014",
        "A: Beat the Jew. That \u2014 those were extremists, but hardly ever. And so that was not\nshowing what the population was. But we have, don\u2019t buy in Jewish store. Last few\nyears we e \u2014 if we could avoid. And the reason was economic, because before\nPoland received independence into ninet \u2014 18 \u2014 Jewish people were taking part of\ncommerce. Because for a nobleman it was not nice, so if he brings some food,\nsomebody had to bring into the city. And that was what Jewish people were doing.",
        "A: Then [indecipherable] Jewish population was very I-large. Out of 30 millions \u2014\nno, 33 million people we had before the war, three million were Jewish. Because\nwhen in the western Europe in, I don\u2019t know, 15\" 16 century, when there were a\nfight and they didn\u2019t wan \u2014 like Jewish people, Jewish people came, and apparently\njust past the e-e-eastern border of Poland there was a biggest population o-of\nJewish people, because we accepted them. So that was only when Poland get the\nindependence, and we started to modern life, somebody had to have the \u2014 the\nshopkeepers could not be only Jewish people. And because of that, Jewish people\nwere fighting the new stores. Of course, that was economic fight. The whole part of\nwas \u2014 some Jewish people were giving money to this storekeeper who was next to\nthe new Polish store \u2014 not Polish, Christian store. Jewish people were Polish people.\nBut they were giving him money, so Jewish store had everything cheaper. After a\nOctober 22, 2014\ntime, after a year or two, the other one has to close. Then, the prices in Jewish store\nwent up. That was known, and because of that we were, don\u2019t buy in Jewish store.\nBut that was not anti-Semitism. This was justified of \u2014 as I said, the noblemen,\nsince they gi \u2014 were giving to every son, then they were poorer and poorer. That\nwas a cul \u2014 sort of culture. But \u2014",
        "A: They change, from one to the other.",
        "A: Yes, for 12 \u2014 12 years, there were two or three. The first one was the one which\nworked with my mother, providing lunches to people.",
        "A: So she was my \u2014 my nurse on the very beginning.\nOctober 22, 2014",
        "A: No, I knew something. For instance, I \u2014 I\u2019m \u2014 well, I live in commun \u2014\ncommunity where 1s a lot of Jewish people. There are two synagogues. For me it\nwas a surprise that there are different kind of Jewish \u2014 that they need two\nsynagogues close to each other.",
        "A: No, no, here.",
        "A: In Silver Spring.",
        "A: I live in place where there\u2019s a lot of Jewish people. But, for instance, I knew tha\n\u2014 and I always wonder wha \u2014 from me to the closest synagogue is more that 1,000\npaces. And I learned that Jewish people cannot walk farther than 10,000 paces. So\nhow can stretch it? They don\u2019t drive, of course. They go \u2014 walk to synagogue. But I\nknew about that. I knew about matzah.",
        "A: Ye-Yes, I like 1t very much. I didn\u2019t know that it\u2019s a religious, the triangular\ncake, but we had triangle ca-cakes with poppy seeds inside, and big one, no-not the\nshort one, but short like \u2014\nOctober 22, 2014",
        "A: I\u2014I don\u2019t know, but I knew some things [indecipherable] that they had to wash\nthe \u2014 all the dishes somewhere. So, we knew a little bit of the Jewish culture. And\nof course, my parents were very much against us. That was just before the war,\nthere were some people who were against Jews very strongly, and my parents were\nsaying that it\u2019s \u2014 it was completely silly. When we had to, during the war, under the\nRussian occupation, we had to go to Warsaw, to German \u2014 Germany\n[indecipherable]. So, my mother went to a friend who was a doctor, and she gave\nmy mother a sign that my mother has a weak \u2014 weak heart, and have to stay at home\nfor three weeks. That was in case we would not be able to pass through Warsaw,\nand she would have to come back, so she will be able to get her job again. Of\ncourse, that was something what she \u2014 it was be punished by whatever, maybe\nsending to Siberia. But she gave it to my mother. So \u2014",
        "A: She was Jewish, yes.",
        "A: And also we have a doctor, h-he was Jewish. When we started to buy only in\nChristian stores, we didn\u2019t change him. So, it was a Jewish doctor. So I really\nbelieve strongly there was no anti-semit \u2014 anti-Semitism is always in all the world,\nbut in Poland it was not strong.\nOctober 22, 2014",
        "A: But people believe right now, but taking a bad thing is very, very easy, and since\nSoviet Union were saying that everything is fault of Jewish people, and so you\nknow, it start.",
        "A: A teacher.",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "A: In\u2014 mostly were normal school. Only from time to time we had that \u2014",

        "A: So, they were always talking. My father was very interested in social things. But\nI don\u2019t know \u2014",
        "A: I wish I knew \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 but I don\u2019t. There was only one thing. In Poland \u2014 here you have the names \u2014 I\nwas So-so \u2014 it was so funny for me when I think he was the principal of the school\nsomewhere in Gloucester where I live years ago, and the street was named by him.\nAnd so there was something opening, and I shake his hand. Why it was so funny for\nme, because in Poland there is no \u2014 right now there 1s a lot of streets named by \u2014 by\nthe Pope. But otherwise \u2014 I don\u2019t know whether that changed, but in Bialystok,\nthere was a street named by Koseza(ph) Kowskei(ph) was mi \u2014 misa \u2014 some \u2014\nsomeone in government.",
        "A: And my father objected to it. And because of that he lost his job, and for four\nyears \u2014 that was eight years before the war \u2014 for four years he could not find a job,\nand then all the savings are \u2014 went down. He had one job somewhere in Silesia, and\nhe \u2014 somehow he lost it, after he have a year. So it \u2014 we \u2014 we were really using all\nOctober 22, 2014\nthe savings. And then he got the job in Tarnopol, which is Ukraine right now in\nthat.",
        "A: Tarnopol, yes, there was a Voivodswa(ph) Tarnopolski(ph). And so \u2014",
        "A: Mm-hm. He used to come to us for Christmas, and we were going for vacation\ndown there.",
        "A: And because of that he\u2019s \u2014",
        "A: Yes, in trouble, because not that he cannot \u2014 there \u2014 there were no work. They\ndid not want him to get work.",
        "A: It was a punishment because he said the streets should not be called \u2014",
        "A: Yes. Kosceza(ph) Kowskei(ph).",
        "A: Kosceza(ph) Kowskei(ph).\nOctober 22, 2014",
        "A: I have no idea.",
        "A: You may be able to find it.",
        "A: That I don\u2019t know, because in school I don\u2019t think that they were with him. But\nanyway, he \u2014 Pilsudski was in school a very important person. And my mother, like\nshe was teaching me to be Catholic, she was teaching me to good Pole. And that\nwas \u2014 I\u2019m not sure that they were with him very much. I don\u2019t know \u2014 I \u2014 I was too\nyoung to understand when he started some trouble, where they were in that \u2014",
        "A: I don\u2019t know.",

        "A: I know that there \u2014 one teacher had three children, and they were saying it\u2019s too\nmuch. And that time in \u2014 when my mother, during the war was teaching in \u2014 in the\ncountry, my friend was one of 14.",
        "A: So that was the usual.",
        "A: So, one thing. My father, when he was in Tarnopol, he was away from the\nfamily. He was playing Bridge, which 1s how we \u2014",
        "A: Yes, yes, card game. And for a very small amount of money, but he also always\nwinning and bringing money home.",
        "A: [indecipherable] very little. But apart from that, he had nothing to do. So he was\napparently taking, at that time, everywhere in the country, people during the winter\nwere just suffering, because they had nothing to work, nothing to eat, and so on.\nAnd so he was supporting the peasant \u2014 peasants\u2019 art. And apparently there was a\nshop cl \u2014 something for that opened before the war, already for a few years. And\npeople were so grateful to my father, that they gave him an how \u2014 ho \u2014 handwoven\nOctober 22, 2014\ncarpet, which was, when I came here I saw something close by \u2014 close to it, it will\nbe a thousand or 2,000 dollars\u2019 worth here.",
        "A: And they gave it to him \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 for what he was doing.",
        "A: But what he was doing, I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: So \u2014 so definitely he was for the people, but on the other ha-hand, my mother\nwas paying that five zloty more than usual, the \u2014 that\u2019s way other people were\ntaking this \u2014 her servants, taught by her, and so on. But, so was sort of equality for\npeople, good, bad. Also the \u2014 I would say that it would be for everybody, strike\nyour own, and help other people.",
        "A: It was not \u2014 it was the values \u2014 not socialist values.",
        "A: But still good for other people.",

        "A: Yes, they must be, but to me they were perfect, really.",
        "A: Let me say with the [indecipherable] because I will be most likely coming back\nalso, to things other. When war started, my father had to go to \u2014 to the army.

        "A: So he was retreating also.",
        "A: Yes?\nOctober 22, 2014",
        "A: I was very close to, he was my friend, not only my brother. Only four years\nolder. He was teasing me from time to time, but we were really friends. And he was\nvery athletic. I was \u2014 I was always choosing my food, and I was small, and tiny and\nnot athletic at all. And he was in everything, and he was playing music \u2014 piano. My\nmother was \u2014 wanted me to learn piano, I was learning for four years, because piano\nyou don\u2019t have to have good hearing to \u2014 to be able to play. But he was very good,\none of the \u2014 had some concerts and so on. So by 16 he was known as good pianist,\nand good tennis player. We had that tennis courts, which that\u2019s a very expensive \u2014\nbecause you don\u2019t ha \u2014 you had to pay for that, but since it was on the school\ngrounds, we \u2014 we have it.

We went out, we were really afraid. And we found that one woman, since\nshe couldn\u2019t wash her children\u2019s hands, she wash it with the cologne water.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes. And the smell of that, and everybody thought it was gas. So \u2014",
        "A: Yes. So we were afraid of gas, yes.",

        "A: And people \u2014 people get there and the bomb fell down.\nOctober 22, 2014",
        "A: And there was a lot of people. And my brother, who was helping there, as a\nscout, he put his body on his arm, and took it to the hospital, and it \u2014 it was a dead\nman. My brother was 16, so he\u2019s still not an old person \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 who take. And people started to \u2014 he told me that \u2014 started to say, how can you\ndo that to an \u2014 without respect to a dead person? So he was helping as much as he\ncould, but when there was a call for people to retreat to \u2014 from \u2014 he started to retreat\nas well.",
        "A: He was 16. No, no, no.",
        "A: He was only the scout, very, very much in scouting.",
        "A: Yes, through the scouts, he volunteered.",
        "A: And of course when \u2014 on 17 they started to come back, he star \u2014 he came back as\nwell. He never saw my hu \u2014 father, because on gel \u2014 he wanted to be with us for\nOctober 22, 2014\nChristmas, but after Christmas he went down, he was going through Romania to\nFrance to fight.",
        "A: My brother. He was arrested on the border, we did not know about that. My \u2014",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: The Russians started to come in.",
        "A: Well, you didn\u2019t let me talk.",
        "A: But before that \u2014",
        "A: How friendly were Germans and Russian at that time? First Germans come to\nBialystok for one week.\nOctober 22, 2014",
        "A: In the school there was Polish hospital \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 because there \u2014 there was a big kitchen, and my mother wa \u2014 hated cooking.\nBut she volunteered to help in the kitchen. And I was wiping the \u2014 she wa \u2014 she\nwasn\u2019t cooking, luckily, for people. But she was washing the dishes, and I was\nwiping it and going out and putting the water out. When Germans came, since that\nwas already hospital, Germans took it as a hospital for one week. And then they\nretreated because Russians were supposed to, according to Molotov-Ribbentrop,\nBialystok was supposed to be in Russian. So they retreated, and Russian took the\nhospital, and there was a hospital, with a vo \u2014 very good doctors. A \u2014 amp-\namputation of the leg or hand look awful, but it\u2019s one of the easiest thing to do. And\npeople were saying that if that one doctor there would cut the leg off, the person\nwould die for sure. It was a horrible thing. When the war started, all the stores had\nto be open, whether they have anything to sell, or not. And that \u2014 the woman who\nhad the store with \u2014 with \u2014 I\u2019m thinking in Polish when I am talking about that.",
        "A: Yes. Somewhere where you sell the medicine.",
        "A: Yeah, pharmacy. The owner of the pharmacy had that pharmacy open. She told\nthat to my mother, my mother told me. There wa \u2014 came a man, and she said, I\u2019m\nsorry, but I don\u2019t have anything left. And, you really don\u2019t? What about that? And\nthere were the \u2014 were the little baby, you put here in his mouth so he won\u2019t cry.",
        "A: Pacifier, yes.",
        "A: A pacifier. And that was a Russian \u2014 I think Russian officer, but an \u2014 anyway, is\nRussian.",
        "A: And she ask hi-him, you want one or two? No, all of them. And he bought 50.\nEverything what we had, it was really luxury for them. And \u2014",
        "A: Well, it was almost ev \u2014 empty, everything was sold, nothing brought in. So she\nsaid, I don\u2019t have anything, I \u2014 and only those pacifiers. And since there were 50\npacifiers, he bought 50 pacifiers. There were a time when we didn\u2019t have bread,\nwhen \u2014 and once we had halvah, you know what it is?\nOctober 22, 2014",
        "A: We could buy a lot of halvah, and we were eating that halvah, because that\u2019s\nwhat brought to \u2014 was brought to Poland. And just the beginning of the war,\nRussians were going to the main square. In Poland there was \u2014 nuns had the\norphanage. And they were going to take the orphanage, the whole orphanage or\nsomething. That was one of the first ma-main thing. People learn about that,\neverybody came to that square.",
        "A: Thousands of people, and we didn\u2019t let Russians take the nuns out. My brother\nwas there, I wasn\u2019t.",
        "A: To take that orphanage somewhere, all children from the nuns. I don\u2019t know\nexactly what, but I know that we went. There\u2019s another thing. The \u2014 the first \u2014 first\nhalf year of the war, we were sent to different classes, mixed together. People were\nsaying \u2014 once my mother said, be very careful what you say, because somebody\nsaid that you said, when Polish ef \u2014 officers will come from Lithuania, we\u2019ll have\nfree Poland again. That was be for me, 12 year old, would be so stupid. But\nsomebody had to say something about me, and because that \u2014 they said that stupid\nthing. And my mu \u2014 somebody warned my mother, my mother say, be very careful\nOctober 22, 2014\nwhat you are saying. On the other hand, this first half a year again, we had in\nPoland, a cross in front of the class. We usually pray just before the classes and\nafter the school end. And Russians told to take the crosses out. No crosses in school.\nSo in my brother\u2019s school, they had the \u2014 not \u2014 not al-always one, but one of them\nwould bring a cross every day, put it there, take it down afterwards. But during the\nclasses, there was cross there. In my s \u2014 and in my school \u2014 and that was already\nmix, because I went to seventh grade from six, that was different school, and\nbecause of that, I knew half of half \u2014 they were specially mixed, so you will never\nknow. And once, we were finishing the class where would \u2014 we would say the\nprayer. And we were saying the prayer even when there was a \u2014I don\u2019t know\nwhether we had a cross, or there was no cross, but we were praying into that\ndirection. Oh, of course, in every class there was Stalin and somebody else there.",
        "A: Picture, yes.",
        "A: So us \u2014 one of the girls, and that\u2019s already in that mixed school, say, are you\ngoing to pray to the Stalin? And without anything we turn around, and then after\nthat, every day when we \u2014 was a prayer, we would stand up, turn around, so back to\nOctober 22, 2014\nthis \u2014 to Stalin. So, that\u2019s the atmosphere. But afterwards we were always afraid,\nafraid, afraid.",
        "A: They was \u2014 they were marching, the whole battalion or something, I don\u2019t know,\nand they were \u2014 were always singing. They sing beautifully, even in the army, they\nsing not one voice, but two voices.",
        "A: Like a choir. And I liked it, and I was so ashamed that I liked it. I was really\nashamed that I would.",
        "A: But, 12 year old \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 has no \u2014",
        "A: Once my mother \u2014 there was one man standing. She \u2014 she said, turn around and\ndon-don\u2019t look there. He was masturbating on the street.\nOctober 22, 2014",
        "A: And looking at my mother. Since she said so, I \u2014 I didn\u2019t know what it was.\nLater on, when I was grown up, I learned. I remember it. People, as people, were\npretty nice. Nobody complain about them. There were no \u2014 no excesses. But they\ndo what they were told to do the \u2014 and that one told us to get out of th \u2014 our house\nto somewhere else, because even Stalin doesn\u2019t live so luxurious we did.",
        "A: They have \u2014 they happen \u2014 that happened \u201939, or was it beginning of \u201940? I don\u2019t\nknow, but definitely I was in Bialystok less than a year.",
        "A: So that was beginning of the year.",
        "A: But let me \u2014 let me say, because I have to speak about my father, because that\u2019s\n\u2014 that was \u2014",
        "A: My father was going dow \u2014 back, back, back, and finally he retreated to\nLithuania.",
        "A: And Lithuania was free at that time, so he was in the officers of \u2014 whatever it\ncalled, but camp for the officers.\nOctober 22, 2014",
        "A: He was going to sit there for the whole rest of the war, because Lithuania was\nnot in war. And then the Russians came to help the Lithuanians. And I don\u2019t know\nwhat month was that, February or March?",
        "A: But it was \u2014",
        "A: No, no, no.",
        "A: The very beginning it wasn\u2019t.",
        "A: Because of that, there was a camp which was supposed to be in neutral country.\nLithuania was neutral country. It was \u2014",
        "A: Yes, but the Russians came earlier.",
        "A: I think February or March.",
        "A: But anyway, my brother already went and already was arrested, which we didn\u2019t\nknow. And the Russians then came to the camp, and the camp was not big enough,\nso my father knew the names of other people, as well. And the \u2014 they said, you can\ngo back to your families, we\u2019ll give you permi \u2014 permit to work, and everything\nwill be fine. So my \u2014 my father, first of all, he was jokingly said that he will \u2014 marry\n\u2014 married my mother because he wanted to have children. So of course he wanted to\ngo back to children.",
        "A: And he was the first one to sign that he is going to. And he told me that. He\nmake a bid \u2014 big fuss when the first transport went out and he wasn\u2019t on that first.\nHe was in the second transport, and since he knew the name, there was a third\ntransport. First and third went to Katyn, you know what Katyn is.",
        "A: When they murdered the \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 Polish officers. But my mother \u2014 my father was in the second. They allowed\nhim back to pol \u2014 to Bialystok. Didn\u2019t al \u2014 let him work, didn\u2019t do anything. And\nthere was talk, people knew the \u2014 who \u2014 there were first policemen, or somebody\nOctober 22, 2014\nelse send to Siberia and something like that. And somebody warned \u2014 I have to\ncome back wa-was about the fear. That we were \u2014 will be the next in, our family.",
        "A: Deported. And my parents packed everything what could be necessary. And then\nthe gossip or true, came that young girls were taken to the house of prostitution for\nsoldiers. So my parents decided no, we\u2019re not going to, we \u2014 we\u2019re going to try to\nget to Warsaw.",
        "A: Yes, to German occupied area.",
        "A: And at that time they were still friends, German and Russians. We \u2014 we went \u2014\nthe last night I even slept at my neighbors, because they were told that in case my\nparents will be arrested that night, to send me and I will be going with that part,\nthrough the \u2014 they were not.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: But I want to come back also, because I said fear, fear, fear \u2014\nOctober 22, 2014",
        "A: \u2014 and then before that they show how young children, they were opposing it.",
        "A: But once there was a man whose wi \u2014 a teacher \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 who was \u2014 his wife was pregnant. He was arrested, and for some reason\n[indecipherable] let \u2014 let go. From that time on, all the teachers, if their \u2014 if he\nwould come close by, they would start to speak about weather, and things like that.\nBecause everybody knew that if he was let out, it was because of pregnant wife, and\nsomebo \u2014 the threat him so, not to speak in front of him, and \u2014",
        "A: He most likely was promised to be an informer and because of that, nobody\nblamed him, only everybody was very careful, because we did expect that he was an\ninformer. And that was the fear all the time, fear who will say what, and what next.\nSo, we \u2014 we were trying to cross the border. I had a fever at that \u2014 I\u2014 I was \u2014 some\ncommon thing which people right now are immunized against it.",
        "A: No, no, no. One of the \u2014 what\u2019s it used to be called children\u2019s illness. Everybody\npass it.\nOctober 22, 2014",
        "A: No, mumps I had later. Whooping cough, | think.",
        "A: But anyway, I had something like that, and with that, first we went by train a\nlittle bit, then through \u2014 people used to have wa \u2014 wagon with horse drawn, with \u2014 it\ntook us three or four days to come to the middle, between Bialystok and the\nWarsaw.",
        "A: Yes, but you cannot go straight, you cannot dri-drive.",
        "A: No way. So we were trying, and we were caught. Those people who were\nleading us, never were caught before that, and that was 13\" time. All the men, 16\nyears and older were arrested and sent to prison. My father was \u2014",
        "A: Soviets.",
        "A: Of course not. [indecipherable]\nOctober 22, 2014",
        "A: No, it usually, people, if they cross the border and they were caught, they were\nsaying, if they cau \u2014 coming from Warsaw, they would say, we\u2019re coming from\nBialystok. And because of that, they would be sent through. But this time they were\nlooking for a spy, or somebody. And because of that, all the \u2014 our group was maybe\n40, maybe 50 people. One child was always given something to sleep, and they \u2014",
        "A: And they ca \u2014 and carried. So \u2014",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: No, we met only in the gathering last \u2014 last place. Everybody went by himself.",
        "A: But it was my parents knew about that, and I had that fever, and so I-I didn\u2019t\neven remember quite a lot.",
        "A: And so women and children were taken to prison, which was dungeon where the\npigs used to live. No light, nothing, for three days. And after three days, it was the\nthird of May. The door opened, and we could see the light, and they said, come out,\nOctober 22, 2014\ncome out. They led us all \u2014 we were close to the border, but not at the border, and I\ndon\u2019t remember whether Russian or Germans helped us through the barbed wire.",
        "A: Because they wanted to get rid of us. So after that we \u2014 we joined 1n \u2014 we went\nto \u2014 my mother and I went to my \u2014 my father\u2019s sister in Pruszkow, which 1s close\nto Warsaw.",
        "A: He was arrested, he was in \u2014 1n prison. Now, they were friends, all the time. My\nm \u2014 my father was in jail in bresh \u2014 you call it Brezlitofsk(ph).",
        "A: That was twierdza \u2014 some \u2014 somewhere where \u2014 it used to be somewhere, a big\nbuilding which could be defending something else, or \u2014",
        "A: Twierdza, yes, fortress.",
        "A: But that was a \u2014a prison. My father was going to be sent to Siberia, and then\nsomebody came and just to be nasty, I don\u2019t know who \u2014 who he was, and say,\ngood morning, fa \u2014 Mr. Officer. They did not know that my father was in the army\nOctober 22, 2014\never. So my father was interrogated again. And we saw him after the interrogation,\na few months, and my mother said that he still had blacks place.",
        "A: Black and blue. And he was once saw a woman \u2014 pregnant woman being\ninterrogated, and she was kicked in her stomach, and her blood came through the\nmouth. So that was the kind of interrogation. But anyway, finally his \u2014 they were\nasking him, where did you put the armament and \u2014 and how much and where? And\nhe didn\u2019t, so he was saying no, no, no, and finally it was too much for him, after a\nweek or two or three, and he said, I'll be talking. That my father told me. And I\ncannot say exactly what it was, but the \u2014 he said, yes, I am put in \u2014 there \u2014 there is a\nnational park close there. In the national park I hid a hundred guns. And the man\nwas still writing. Two hundred machine guns. He was writing. Four hundred\ncannons. He was writing. And something like that. Finally he said, and three planes.\nThen that man beat him once more, and knew that he wouldn\u2019t be able to get\nanything from him because he doesn\u2019t know.",
        "A: So the next day he was going to be sent to Siberia. That day, luckily \u2014 it was in\n\"41, and the war started. Germans attacked in \u2014",
        "A: Yes. My \u2014 my father was 1n jail from the third of May to that day.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: And that day \u2014 yes. And in Poland Jewish boys are not circumcised.",
        "A: Sorry, Jewish boys are circumcised \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 but the others boys are not.",
        "A: I think that in America they are, if you want to. But in Poland you can see\nwhich boy is Jewish and which not.",
        "A: So, when Germans got the cytil(ph) \u2014",
        "A: Fort \u2014 fortress, they killed all the Jewish people, at least all the Jewish men. My\nfather told me. And the rest, they had to dig the trenches. For three days they\nOctober 22, 2014\nweren\u2019t given any food at all, and in prison they were pretty hungry already. And\nthen, after three days, they were let go. And good heart almost killed my father,\nbecause he was working somewhere, and the woman who was making butter, saw\nthat he was from the prison, and gave him that big lump of butter, which she just\nmade. And after three days of not eating and one year of pri \u2014 being hungry, he ate\nall that, and was very, very sick. Then he went to Bialystok, to where we used to\nbe. And he was waiting that maybe my brother \u2014 he learn in prison that my brother\nwas arrested, we \u2014 we thought that he was already in France. And so he wa-waited\nfor about a month, and then come to us. And then he had that \u2014 that he could show\nthat bla \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 black and blue.",
        "A: By \u2014 by then, Germans were in Bialystok as well.",
        "A: \u2014 because they moved forward. As \u2014\nOctober 22, 2014\nthat was in May 1940, until well over a year and maybe in the summer, sometime\n1941, is when you see him again.",
        "A: But my mother, when the war started \u2014 war between German and Russian, didn\u2019t\nwant us to \u2014 to be separated. She found a job as a teacher in the country south of\nWarsaw, and I was staying with my aunt and traveling. That was also something I\nwas doing already 13, but traveling every day to school, which was illegal. It was\ncalled \u2014 because after six years, it was only trade school. So my school was called\nzabawkarska, something prepared to make toys. So we had, I think nine hours of\npaint \u2014 drawing, and six hours of making something a week, a ye \u2014 a week, plus the\nnormal courses. But of course the normal books were kept at home only. Teacher\nwas saying and we were learning that way. But \u2014 and I was traveling from\nPruszkow to Warsaw every day, and then I \u2014 I know that I had to have a\nphotograph for my license, or some \u2014 no \u2014",
        "A: I\u2014LD. And so if you are 13 and never did that, to go to do it, it was something,\nyeah.\nOctober 22, 2014",
        "A: Yes, I know that it was. But when the war started, with the Germans attacked\nRussia, then my mother sa \u2014 came and take me to the country. For two years, I was\nlearning from books, and \u2014",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Let me say one thing, because we\u2019ll \u2014 we\u2019ll show the \u2014 what kind of upbringing\nit was. My brother started to smoke, and scouts were not supposed to smoke. So he\nwas going in the fall, say I\u2019m \u2014 I cannot be a scout any more. And my mother was\nin scouting, sh-she \u2014 she was smoking, she could not be the normal only was\nhelping with camps and so on. But she was very involved as well. But my brother\nwas going to say, I\u2019m not going to be a scout because I cannot stop.",
        "A: And then the war started, so he, as a scout, went to help in that hospital, because\nhe knew that\u2019s more important than that, but he was going not to be involved. But\nhe was very involved in scouting. Then here, when the \u2014 there was appeal to young\nmen, and see, he was 16 only. He went because he wanted to join the army.",

Only\nhis wife, his second-in-command and I knew where he was. So if something were \u2014\nmessages to him were going through me. Because if, for instance, my father did not\nknow in hos \u2014 which hospital, nothing. So he was safe. He went out of the hospital,\nI think about a month before insurrection. And my biggest experience during the\ninsurrection was, I was just trying to find out what \u2014 we know the date, but what\nday of the week it was. It was \u2014 insurrection started Tuesday. And we have in the\nyard of the house where was the command, we have the mass for soldiers. So 1t was\nnot the first day. Is on a Sunday then.

And\nmy father, from that camp went to Murnau, where is only for officers \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 also. And I don\u2019t remember, but I think it was before the Christmas that we\nwere sent to Oberlangen. Oberlangen is close to border of Holland, with empty\nspace all around us. And they sent one after another, they sent women from other\nprisoners of war, which was definitely very safer for us. My father said that in\nSandbostel they were \u2014 Polish men were prepared that if we will be freed, they will\ntry to go at any place to our camp, our \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 area, because there are men who are four or five years without women. So\nGermans took all the women. Before that they ask who wants to work in th \u2014 in the\ncountry, or something. I think 1t was volunteer everywhere, that m-maybe there was\npressure on women, but definitely not pressure on the \u2014 physical pressure. No, not\nphysical pressure, psychological pressure. Because a lot of women from the\nprisoner of camp went to work somewhere. But we went, just sent to that one camp.\nOctober 22, 2014",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: For a day or two we were together. We were marched, I think about 20\nkilometers to Ozarow, and then in a very big camp, and then men was separated\nfrom women.",
        "A: But we were taken as ordinary soldiers, already.",
        "A: Oh yes, yes.",
        "A: That\u2019s not comfortable, but is nothing.\nOctober 22, 2014",
        "A: Most likely before Christmas, but I\u2019m not sure whether it before or after\nChristmas. Then we were taken to Oberlangen, which was an empty space \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 with only us.",
        "A: Only women, from a different camp. I was in the second barrack.",
        "A: Why they took all the women together?",
        "A: I\u2019m thinking because they thought that it was safer. They was done properly.",
        "A: And we were even received three \u2014 three times I think, a parcel from Red Cross.\nOn-Only three, usually it would be more, food or something. Once they sent\nhygienic things for women, and I learned then everybo \u2014 well, we had the little\nhospital there, for us, and so it was useful. But, more than half of women did not\nhave the usual period, because of the \u2014\nOctober 22, 2014",
        "A: Not only stress, hunger.",
        "A: We were given food, but Germans didn\u2019t have much of that. We had to work in\nthe kitchen for ourselves, so that\u2019s all again \u2014 according to a Geneva Convention.",
        "A: I cannot say that \u2014 somebody once said that it was a special camp or something.\nIt was the proper camp, they treated us properly. We had to go out to bring the\npotatoes, but I had unusual smell, and they ask me very often, what is in this soup?\nAnd I would say that the soup is with salt, or without. Sometimes they didn\u2019t have\nsalt. I cannot say more salty or less, but salt, or without salt, I could smell it at that\ntime. So they always ask me, I never made the mistake. So you see \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 it was so little \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 that \u2014 that \u2014 well, we were doing everything. We could do during the day\nwhatever we wanted to. The restroom were outside, of course, not inside. And in\none empty hut there was water broken, and even the winter there, it was flowing\nthere, so we would go there, or something like that.\nOctober 22, 2014",
        "A: No, it was broken, ne-never repaired.",
        "A: But it was an empty one. So we were \u2014 walked around, there were ma-maybe 10\nhuts, and only four or five were occupied. Altogether we were close to 2,000, I\nbelieve. So \u2014",
        "A: About 200. And it was three \u2014 well, three level of \u2014",
        "A: Of course, because \u2014 and we could wash at the end of the \u2014 but to the restroom,\nwe would have to go outside.",
        "A: But three levels, and of course there were wood, and shins \u2014 wood planks, and in\nthe middle of it, there was a stove. And of course, from time to time we took one\nplank. And so sometimes it was difficult to sleep, no, not to fall down, because on\nthat we had shen-nikeetsa(ph), big bag with straw inside.",
        "A: So \u2014 but \u2014 and how did I got the \u2014 it was close to Dutch border, I had wooden\nshoes, and for instance, one of my things was how to walk at night. How did I walk\nto that restroom there on night, so nobody would hear it? Try to walk in the wooden\nOctober 22, 2014\nshoes. So that was something what to occupy me, when we didn\u2019t had any pers \u2014\nanything, we learn history. I started to learn \u2014 I-I started to learn English before that,\nbut we had one book. It was [indecipherable] something like that, it \u2014 a some book\non lowest level, about some murder or something like that.",
        "A: M-Most likely detective novel. But the three girls who we-were learning from\nsomebody who knew that, were on much better progress, so I was learning what is\nhere, there, at, and things like that.",
        "A: Yes, because we had that detective novel. And it\u2019s still \u2014 in Sandbostel we used\nto walk up and down the corridor there. There we were 1n such a crowd that when\nwe were sleeping on the floor, if we want to turn around, everybody would have to\nturn around. But there was a corridor on which we could not walk during the night,\nbut during the day. And I and two other girls who were learning English \u2014 English\nwas not popular in before the war, only French and German. Russian, we had to\nlearn later, but wasn\u2019t popular. But anyway, so we were talking the whole Polish\nsentence with one word English which we knew, not to forget. But then in\nOberlangen it was already something like that. And of course if we were bored,\nOctober 22, 2014\nand if somebody knew something about the subject, there was a conference about\nthat and everybody would cool \u2014 come and so it was ordinary \u2014",
        "A: Prisoner of war camp.",
        "A: And definitely Germans treated \u2014 well, sometimes we, if they couldn\u2019t count\ncorrect \u2014 nobody run away from the camp, I don\u2019t think so. But if they couldn\u2019t\ncount everybody, because everybody would have to come \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 but somebody sick maybe, we could stand for two or three hours. But that\u2019s the\nusual in camp. Opposite us, opposite this four or five huts, were the others, and\nthere was that little hospital, which we had for \u2014 and also, during that morning and\nevening \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 count of us, there were boys. There were soldiers. They were \u2014 the oldest one,\nmost likely 12 or 13, and he would say, on top, march, look that, and so on, because\nthey have to be counted. They were soldiers. In my hut, there were two sisters \u2014",
        "A: Yes, prisoners of war.\nOctober 22, 2014",
        "A: They were, definitely.",
        "A: And in my camp, I learned later that bo-both went to Israel. We knew they were\nJewish, we can hear a Jewish accent. It\u2019s a some sort of accent, I don\u2019t know\nwhether I would be able to recognize right now. Jewish people had that accent, and\nthe best educated had the best Polish, no accent at all. You hear the much better\npronunciation that others. But the just ordinary people had some sort of accent\nwhich we could recognize. They definitely had, and the older one looked like\nJewish girl. So \u2014 with the f-face. Nobody ever mentioned that they were Jewish, of\ncourse, because we never knew whether they \u2014 even as prisoner of war, whether\nthey would not be taken out. And I was talking to that little one. I think that she was\nabout 10. Apparently, she joined the insurrection, and was a messenger, as I was.\nAnd she said her biggest trouble was that when she was sent with messages to\npeople [indecipherable] somewhere in there, and she should not ask people where\nto go if she mistake it. And she could not read, so she was putting the messages in\nbetween her fingers to remember to whom she has to go and show, if she ge-get\nmore.\nOctober 22, 2014",
        "A: No. Apparently she was in ghetto. There was no schools. Because she must have\nbeen \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 at least nine, but I think she was about 10. And so that\u2019s was a soldier, that\u2019s\nmy little hero \u2014 hero.",
        "A: She was putting in t \u2014 in between her fingers to remember, because she could not\nask somebody on the street. She would never know who is that person. So, what she\ndid before, for that year, I don\u2019t know. Maybe she was singing in the streetcars, or\nso on. There were some songs against Germans, which the \u2014 the streetcars were so\ncrowded, and nobody would s \u2014 would [indecipherable] anything. What they did\nbefore, I did not ask. And apparently \u2014 I don\u2019t think that she would be alone with\nher sister. I don\u2019t know whether it was her sister, they used the same name, last\nname. But they were so different. One was \u2014 my little hero was blonde, and the\nother one was dark. Everybody liked the little one, we didn\u2019t like very much the\nother one. They completely different. Most likely they just lived together, maybe\nthey were sisters, I don\u2019t know. But definitely \u2014 I don\u2019t remember where I heard,\nthere was a list of people who \u2014 women who were in the camp. But then with the\nOctober 22, 2014\nage, but I couldn\u2019t find someones who would be \u2014 I didn\u2019t know exactly what their\nage. But le \u2014",
        "A: I don\u2019t know definitely. I\u2019m sure that there were more, but this two were in the\nhut where I was, and I \u2014 somehow I talked with that \u2014 that little one.",
        "A: No, I don\u2019t.",
        "A: No, I was not close to it.",
        "A: People in France, for instance, people would be punished, but not us in Poland.\nIn Poland you must have heard about many people who kept Jewish people hiding.\nAnd if they would find, the whole family, including small children, would be killed.\nI was not close to that. Now, I lived in Warsaw, very close to ge \u2014 ghetto.",
        "A: Excuse me?\nOctober 22, 2014",
        "A: That I have to tell you, the ghetto was fighting. First of all, there was a very big\nwall with the barb wire \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 on top of that. I think eight feet, or something like that. On the other side I was\nwalking very often Zelazna.",
        "A: And so that was \u2014 and I think, but right now I don\u2019t remember, but I think that\nthe gate, very often before the insurrection in \u2014 1n the ghetto, the little children\nsometimes were walking here and there, maybe begging or something, and I think\nthat Germans allowed that.",
        "A: A little bit.",
        "A: A few steps. But I don\u2019t really know whether I remember it right. I think that it\nwas that it was possible.",
        "A: No, why?\n101October 22, 2014",
        "A: I wouldn\u2019t get out.",
        "A: There was small ghetto and big ghetto.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember next to Zelazna where I was walking, whether that was big or\nlittle one, right. And in between there was a street, so you could see it, and people\ncould go from one ghetto to another over that. And that was \u2014 now, one of them, the\none which was farther away from me, started to fight a few days earlier, I don\u2019t\nremember. And then I was walking \u2014 we were shocked [indecipherable] we knew\nthat they cannot survive, nothing will \u2014 there was a Polish underground and Jewish\nunderground, there were some connection, but we didn\u2019t have a lot of ammunition\nor anything, even for \u2014 for our-ourselves, so we didn\u2019t have later. So we couldn\u2019t\nhelp, we just had to look helplessly. And we were sorry, looking at \u2014 at people who\nwere dying there. But on the very beginning, on that \u2014 that other ghetto, other part\nwas fighting and this one not. When I was going through Zelazna street, and over\nthat big wall, I could see a woman \u2014 it was April, it was warm enough, she was\nlooking through the window down there. They were not fighting. And she was\n102October 22, 2014\nmaybe even smiling. She was definitely not \u2014 not horrified, not frightened. She was\ntalking to somebody with \u2014 it couldn\u2019t \u2014 you couldn\u2019t say joy, I \u2014 I don\u2019t have the\nword for that. But I was horrified. How could she be so calm, when she 1s going to\ndie pretty soon? Where her people are dying? It took me a few years to understand\nthat she was proud. She knew what\u2019s waiting for her, and I s \u2014 I still can see her\nhow it was, and she took it nicely. She was glad that \u2014 that they fighting and not \u2014\nnot allowing to be martyred by \u2014 by themselves. It \u2014 it give me a \u2014 an impression,\nbecause we were horrified.",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "A: A few weeks or months later, my father \u2014 I used to go by streetcar next to all get\n\u2014 the ghetto was always closed to us, afterwards as well. There was streetcar, and he\nsaid, don\u2019t go by streetcar today, not this one, because Germans put \u2014 hung some\npeople and so high, so you could see it from streetcar, and there were dead people\nthere. So Germans weren\u2019t nice to us. And we learn only that during the\ninsurrection, that there was a prison there, and some people were \u2014",
        "A: Re-Rescued then.\n103October 22, 2014",
        "A: And we didn\u2019t know that there was a prison there.",
        "A: No, no, Pawiak, he was somewhere else. It was after \u2014 after ghetto da \u2014 it was \u2014\nafter the Holocaust \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 there was a prison there.",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "A: On the very beginning, we didn\u2019t. I knew quite a lot because of my father pretty\nhigh position in \u2014 in the army. So, for instance, when Russians were coming and are\nclose to Wilno, people were saying we\u2019re Armia Kryova. At first they were treated\nnicely, but then they were prison there, something. So, before the insurrection, we\nknew already what was really expecting us, that unless we\u2019ll be strong enough to\nget Warsaw before the Russians would come in, but they stop, and they didn\u2019t want\nthe allies to \u2014 to come in London, whatever, once more they \u2014\nOctober 22, 2014",
        "A: \u2014 they did whatever they \u2014",
        "A: Maybe later we knew. On the very beginning, nobody knows. When ghetto was\nstarting, some couple which were Christian and Russian \u2014 and Jewish, they could\nchoose the \u2014 at least the wife could stay outside. They usually would choose to go\nto ghetto together \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 because nobody expected that. They expected that people will be separated,\nbut not that. Later they knew and most likely we know. But for quite a time Jewish\npeople didn\u2019t know that when there 1s a transport, the transport is to be killed.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know when it\u2019s come. Before the insurrection, before the ghetto up-\nuprising, we already knew, but \u2014\n105October 22, 2014",
        "A: \u2014 how long before that, I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: Because we \u2014 we knew that German want to kill all the Jewish people.",
        "A: But not on the very beginning.",
        "A: On the very beginning we didn\u2019t.",
        "A: No, no, no, no.",
        "A: And I never \u2014 well, walking around in there, there was that gate. I never seen it,\nno.",
        "A: So, most likely they were already driven by some \u2014 something. I don\u2019t know.\nNo.",
        "A: So during the war I was not involved with any Jewish peop \u2014 person trying to get\naway, or anything like that. I think that I knew the name of a person who was most\n106October 22, 2014\nactive in ghetto. If you say the name I will tell you that, yes. But \u2014 so we know that\nthere is a underground there, but we knew that everybody is helpless. The \u2014 our\ninsurrection was prepared for three days only, because we didn\u2019t have the\nammunition for everything.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes. Some was taken from Germans, some was \u2014 but very little from the \u2014 being\nthrown by allies, but not Russians. The Russians, on the very end, helped and they s\n\u2014 threw some bread, I had some bread.",
        "A: Yes. Completely dry.",
        "A: We were hungry, but it was the ammunition which we needed. And they did not\nlet the allies planes land on their side. And because of that there was a lot of people\nlost because of that.",

We were not in good \u2014 in terms with \u2014\nwith them, because of Katyn, and that time only Katyn, not \u2014 not the other camps.\nSo it was broken without us, but I think [indecipherable] went to see Stalin just\nbefore that, and Stalin didn\u2019t say anything.

So a lot of people came like that, to them. But, since the war was\nover, they was not taking any new people. But \u2014 and at that time we could not go to\nEngland.

So there were some from the\nPolish insurrection, some were through ho \u2014 went through Siberia. One of my\nfriend was a tall, well-built woman \u2014 girl, at that time.

        "A: We didn\u2019t want to go to Soviet Poland. Poland was not free.",
        "A: Well, there were some \u2014 I think my daughter-in-law father was in Poland still,\nafter the war, after the insurrection, and he was fighting there. How he got out, I\ndon\u2019t know, because we didn\u2019t talk about those things. But he was one who was still\nfighting Germans and Russians and he \u2014 he was a \u2014 we did not fight Russians,\nbecause they were allies, so he was still fighting Germans. And there were some\npeople left and in Poland a lot was arrested and killed and so on.\nOctober 22, 2014",
        "A: It\u2019s not \u2014 not \u2014 for us, the war did not stop there, even for somebody \u2014 we could\nchoose to go out of Warsaw as a prisoner or war, or as a civilian. And many people\ndecided to go as civilian. If they were found later by Russians that they were in the\nunderground army, they would be arrested, killed.",
        "A: So-",
        "A: No, no.",
        "A: They were not.",
        "A: This \u2014 right now when I am looking at the Ukraine it\u2019s exactly what\u2019s happen in\n\u00b039 in Poland, [indecipherable] their people.",
        "A: Whatever. They don\u2019t mind. So \u2014\n116October 22, 2014",
        "A: After a year I wanted so much to go to England when my brother was alive \u2014 we\nhad to go to England and to be resettled. So I was in the camp there, and another\nyear of school, and so I have my matriculation in Polish system. And \u2014",
        "A: But then I had to \u2014",
        "A: [had to go. After a year, all the Polish soldiers were there, and tried to be\nresettled there.",
        "A: Whoever want to go, could go. And out of \u2014 we were in [indecipherable] this is\n\u2014 there were about 30 girls in [indecipherable]. Two of them went. And if you\nconsider that they were mostly young women, because it was the \u2014 we were in\nschool, so it was from say 16 to 20, 22, only two decided to go to Poland.",
        "A: And that was why there are so many people stayed outside. We didn\u2019t recognize\nthe Poland as it was.\nOctober 22, 2014",
        "A: And I ne \u2014 I thought I send my children when they were grown up, to Poland.\nMy oldest one, I told him, if somebody will ask you something, answer in English,\nnot in Polish, so they will treat you as a foreigner. Because that was at the time\nwhen it \u2014 it could be dangerous, I didn\u2019t know. He was 16 at that time. But I never\nexpected that I will be able to go to Poland. So, we never expected that, and we \u2014\nwe didn\u2019t expect that at our lifetime, Poland will be free.",
        "A: But right now 1s still after Ukraine, what would be next is Lithuania, and\nPoland, they \u2014 they were mentioning that at \u2014 at first. But both Lithuania and\nPoland are in Europe right now \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 and Ukraine is not. So, hopefully they won\u2019t be able to.",
        "A: Yes, yes, because they were in the army.",
        "A: My mother was still teaching. Na \u2014 no, she was helping, she wasn\u2019t teaching in\nschool. We had proper teachers, with good education, better than my mother. And\nmy father, he was going to be sort of expert. I don\u2019t know what he was doing before\n118\nOctober 22, 2014\nthe war, but when the National Health Service was starting in England, he was\nsupposed to help as an advisor, even without the English language. And then he got\ntuberculosis and a heart attack. He died on seven heart attack at that time.",
        "A: He died when he was 64.",
        "A: That was in London.",
        "A: That \u2014 it was \u2014 no, no, at \u201860 my husband and I came to United States, and I\nhoped to show the house and everything to my parents, and my father died two\nyears later.",
        "A: They were still in England.",
        "A: In England they \u2014 they were given the social health, because my \u2014 both \u2014 well,\nif my father could not be the expert \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 in his [indecipherable] my mother was teaching in Polish schools. The \u2014 we\nhave Saturday Polish schools everywhere, always. So she was helping with that.\n119\nOctober 22, 2014\nBut she could not work without the language. And when you\u2019re older it 1s very\ndifficult to learn.",
        "A: Thirteen years.",
        "A: And then my husband \u2014 there was Polish university \u2014 college. He was a year\nahead of me, and after a time they said we were under the University of London.\nSo we had to pass the exams once a year, and that was a college. And my husband\nstill can \u2014 could go in Polish only. I had \u2014 I was a year later, in English, and I was\nnot good in English. I failed five times, so I didn\u2019t finish it there. But I wanted to\nfinish it, so when I came to this country, there \u2014 in England there is no \u2014 nothing.\nHow \u2014 you don\u2019t call grades 1s \u2014 for each one you have one or two what \u2014 I lost the\nword, I\u2019m telling you",
        "A: But anyway, I could not pass whatever I already learn in engli\u2014 in England,\nonly I had to pass it by exam.\n120\nOctober 22, 2014",
        "A: So my husband was teaching at the University of Maryland, and I was studying\nthere. And I finish my study, I have my bachelor at 42.",
        "A: It wasn\u2019t easy. I just wanted to finish.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Well, I had to pass five exams. One was most likely mathematics; physics and\nsomething like that. Lab. And I was passing four, and the fifth was English, which I\ncould not pass. I think five times I failed.",
        "A: So then I was studying by myself with the books, which \u2014 at home. But that gave\nme knowledge, but nothing. And when we came to this country t \u2014 first two years I\ndidn\u2019t do anything. And then I join and \u2014 at University of Maryland, my husband\nwas teaching there, we wer \u2014 lived in Maryland, but they said, you have to pay as\nmuch as a foreigner. Not lower as Marylander.\n121\nOctober 22, 2014",
        "A: So I was really angry with that \u2014 them. But later I was going to get my bachelor\nand then fight by-laws with that. And [indecipherable] some Chinese or somebody\nelse did it before me.",
        "A: So it was changed. But it was hard on us, because we didn\u2019t have money, and\nhere I had to pay a li \u2014 right now 1s very, very little, but it\u2019s \u2014 it still was a lot for us.",
        "A: We came to this country with four children, two were born in this country.",
        "A: Six children right now.",
        "A: Mm-hm. Twenty-three grandchildren, and 17 great-grandchildren.",
        "A: Yes, I am rich.\n122\nOctober 22, 2014",
        "A: Yes, we lived in Warsaw a few blocks away, but we met in England. He went\nthrough the insurrection, through Italy. In Italy he was studying at Turin\nUniversity. How he did, I don\u2019t know, because he did \u2014 didn\u2019t know span \u2014",
        "A: Italian. So maybe that\u2019s where something in English, I \u2014 I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: But he \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 was studying there for a year.",
        "A: My husband started to study in England, higher degree. Somebody advised him\nto \u2014 to go to one place, and to do [indecipherable] engineering, and he finish\nmaster in engineering. And he hated if somebody will call him engineer. He wanted\nto study mathematics. And his professor in Polish university told him, you are too\nold for that. He finish, he got the doctorate in mathematics. And apparently, it was\nso well thought in this country about the degree he got in England, that he went\nwith somebody he knew from one of the meeting of people with \u2014 whatever their\ninterest. He took him and my husband got seven offers of a job.\n123\nOctober 22, 2014",
        "A: And he choose, like that, Maryland, and we are in Maryland ever since.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: I know that my daughter once said something was so \u2014 so out of reason. So\napparently we didn\u2019t talk enough about it.",
        "A: Sometimes I talk, but I think they don\u2019t think it\u2019s very important. I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: Somehow I\u2019m dissatisfied with people who right now go out and there\u2019s no \u2014 not\nenough work in Poland, so when they can go anywhere in Europe to \u2014 to work,\nthey do. I \u2014 they don\u2019t really think of coming back. They don\u2019t think really that they\nshould belong to Poland and not to be outside this. And it seems to me they\u2019re \u2014\nthey\u2019re a completely different generation. I lived in free Poland, which was under\n150 years when we were not free. And right now some people are \u2014 in Poland are\n124October 22, 2014\nmixed up, and they don\u2019t recognize that they were not free under the Soviet\noccupation. There is a lot of progress in the country, as I \u2014 I think I mentioned to\nyou that my brother wanted to go on the bicycle to \u2014 from Bialystok to Warsaw.\nAnd that half of main road was paved and some half wasn\u2019t. Right now, even in the\nvillage where my mother lived there, everything is paved. There is electricity. Right\nnow there are a lot of trees, say cherry trees, which are si \u2014 small. So it\u2019s easy to\npick. So you have to \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 start \u2014 raised like not \u2014 not only it\u2019s a different kind of cherries, not the big\none. So that had to be change, you don\u2019t change it from year to year, you have to do\nit. And there, in that village where my mother was teaching, there was about 2,000\npeople, and one \u2014 one with higher education only. So education was allowed, but\nalso some people were pushed, and they should not have the \u2014 that higher\neducation. But definitely everybody has the \u2014 much more opportunity. So, the\nvillages went up, and because of that, some people from there don\u2019t feel that we\nwere not free for so many years. We \u2014 us being outside, we knew what was\nhappening. They accepted what it was, and it wasn\u2019t a free Poland. So \u2014\n125October 22, 2014",
        "A: Yes. And maybe it\u2019s coming. Some people say that schools are not as \u2014 as good\nas it used to be. I know from my mo-mother that after we got independence in\n[indecipherable] the schools were \u2014 they were supposed to be like the schools in\nSwitzerland. That was the example for us. But my mother wa-was going with some\ninspector, wh-who \u2014 who he was I don\u2019t know, about once a year for three days, to\ndifferent schools in the country, where the teacher would have to pass an exam to be",
        "A: \u2014 a teacher there. So some people were not very well educated, and the schools\nwent \u2014 the level of schools went up and apparently they say that right now is going\ndown. I don\u2019t know why.",
        "A: Yes. There \u2014 right now there are changes there \u2014 in Poland, children start at\nseven, they start at six or something. And they \u2014 I don\u2019t understand what, but \u2014",
        "A: \u2014 something is not \u2014 not very good.\n126October 22, 2014\nCanada, from the U.K., from Germany, and even from Russia, and from countries\noutside of the European experience, what would you want the children of these\ncountries to understand what you and your family, and the people in Bialystok, and\nthe people in Warsaw went through? What do you think you\u2019d like them to be able\nto get about that?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think they would learn by themselves if the \u2014 if something will happen.\nBut what I am not \u2014 people \u2014 other people are always dissatisfied, I don\u2019t like\nwhat\u2019s right now common in the world that the countries are not religious countries.\nPoland was definitely Catholic country, but there was tolerance to everybody. And\nas I said, th-the kids who were going out of religious classes, they enjoyed that. And\nthey could stay and learn.",
        "A: Not pray, but learn.",
        "A: And it seems to me that only religion, when you believe \u2014 we believe in the same\nGod, only different, and of course, I \u2014 I believe it is better than [indecipherable].\nBut is the same God. And people need to \u2014 to believe in God, whatever it is. If they\ndon\u2019t know, they even form belief that in several gods, or whatever, I don\u2019t know\nwhat Buddhists believe, and so on. But there is a tolerance, and it was tolerance in\n127October 22, 2014\nPoland. But here, right now, I \u2014 I \u2014 is my \u2014 my own saying, that et \u2014 atheists are not\ntolerant. They cannot tolerate cross somewhere on the street and somewhere.\nMaybe they feel guilty that they don\u2019t believe in God, but I don\u2019t see tolerance in\nthis country, and everywhere. And Poland right now is \u2014 1s separate of state and \u2014\nand \u2014 and I think it\u2019s going the same direction, lack of tolerance. And I\u2019m very\ndissatisfied with that, so I don\u2019t know whether people can change it again, back to\nreligious tolerance. Well, we have Muslims in Poland, some gathering, they \u2014 they\nhave the \u2014 right now they moved from east to west and so on, so it\u2019s more difficult,\nbut those people were \u2014 Poland was always fighting Turks and \u2014 and Tartars, they\nwere Muslims. So those people were taken prisoners, or were \u2014 they were always \u2014\nthey started as our enemies, fighting us. And right now we consider them just any\nother people. We don\u2019t have problem with \u2014 with Muslims right now in Poland.",
        "A: But we are tolerant to any religious, and it seems to me that if \u2014 well, with\nMuslims it\u2019s difficult because not all of them are \u2014 are fighting.",
        "A: But it seems to me I would like young people to believe that religion is the base\nof the social work.\n128October 22, 2014",
        "A: Social \u2014",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: But that\u2019s my thing. I-I don\u2019t know what else I would like for the children, I\ndon\u2019t \u2014 I do want them to \u2014 to believe in God.",
