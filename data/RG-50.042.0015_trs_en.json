        "KURT KLEIN",
        "March 13, 1992\nBeep.\nDescribe the things that happened in the early part of the 1930s that have made you and your\nfamily aware of what was going on.\nWell, there was a, of course, a lot of political strife in Germany under the Weimar Republic, and\nuh, you, you could uh follow the, the events uh, uh you, you could see the parties fighting each\nother, and that every election uh some, some of the uh some party is gaining the upper hand, and uh\nover a period of time uh we saw uh the Nazi party uh, uh, uh gather momentum and, and gaining\nstrength, although at a later date, they, they did uh again uh, uh fall off somewhat, but uh, but it was\na constant see-saw, and there was much turmoil, and we were quite aware that uh (cough), of, of\nwhat was going on, uh, although uh, of course many uh, uh Jews in Ge-in Germany deluded\nthemselves that it would never come to the very worst, but I do remember, uh an incident in my uh\nduring my boyhood uh when I uh overheard someone who had come back from Berlin saying that\nuh the, I believe that he belonged to the Social Democratic Party, uh, and uh he came back and\nsaid, \"It just seems so we're uh we're uh fighting, and so we're doing something, but in reality, uh,\nuh, Hitler is gaining the upper hand. So we were in one sense forewarned, but uh we're always\nhoping for the best naturally.\nWhy do you think so many people didn't realize what was going on?\nWell, uh, it's very easy uh to delude yourself, uh, when you feel yourself as much uh a part of the\nenvironment as, as the German Jews did, uh, most of them had been there for generations, had\nfought in the First World War, and, and, and uh and had a reasonably good life. Some of them\nhad, had, had a very good life, and they felt that since they were so uh, they belonged to that\nenvironment and, and no one would, would ever uh, uh, uh depose them from, from that and it was\nas hard to imagine that uh even Hitler, uh, whose uh speeches certainly sounded ominous uh\nespecially in the later uh in the late 20s and early 30s uh, uh but uh, but we thought that the matter\nwould run its course or many people thought so and, and perhaps, and the Jew, there would be a\nplace for the Jews again.\nUh, why do you think the Nazi party gained -----------?",
        "Well, uh, it's quite obvious that uh Germany went through uh some very difficult times as a result\nof, of the uh, Versailles Treaty and uh there's no question about that that, that treaty uh, uh was\nsigned without much foresight uh on the part of those who drafted it, and uh it, it led to widespread\nunemployment. First the inflation, of course, which wiped out many people. Unemployment and\nuh and, and people were quite willing to listen to anybody, not, uh even if there, there some ---------\n--has considered them rabble rousers, uh, uh who, who promised them a change, a, a, a change of\nwhatever sort, uh and, and they didn't know the price for that change of course, at that time and uh\nthey were willing to try anything uh that that gave them hope and, and Hitler very cleverly could\nplay on their fears and their hopes and he, he promised them to restore their pride which was also a,\na, a considerable thing uh, uh to think about uh quite aside from, from employment or\nunemployment.\nHe has to change a battery.\nSure\nBeep.\nThat was two.\nCan you discuss for me how difficult it was to see persecutions leading to what was to come from\nwhatever you know of that time. I'm curious as to how you knew, how you made a decision to\nleave when so many people didn't make that decision. I want to know more about how you were so\nsure of what was happening.\nWell uh many people uh who, especially those who, who were older, of course, hated to leave their,\ntheir roots, so to speak, and uh, and kept thinking that perhaps uh this wasn't going to be quite as\nbad a-as it later turned out to be. However, there, there were many, many ominous signs on the\nhorizon, and uh I could name one uh, after Hitler came to power, uh I came home from school one\nday to find the entrance to my home guarded by two SA troopers. Uh, they did let me pass\nthrough, but that was the famous or infamous boycott of the Jewish people and their businesses,\nwhich was meant to bring home to the German population that they ought not to do business with\nor consort with Jews in any way. Uh, that was one of the early signs. Well, uh you did also begin\nto hear of concentration camps, and to which at first mostly political prisoners were taken. Also in\ncertain areas of Germany, not in the part where I lived, uh Jews were definitely uh, uh treated a lot",
        "worse than, than we ever thought. Uh, they, they, they were being humiliated, beaten, if not worse,\nand also some dragged off to, to concentration camps, and of course, uh those um, st-uh-stories like\nthat did filter through eventually, and perhaps not uh it didn't take too long. Later uh, the boycott\nwas in 1933. By 1935, uh the Nuremberg Laws went into effect, and they uh further\ndisenfranchised uh Jews of all their civil rights, and, and, and it became quite a hardship to, to\ncomply with, with all that uh and civil servants lost their jobs right then and there, and in the\nmeantime, Jewish businesses, the boycott had its effect and, and many were, were being throttled to\nthe point of where, where they had to give up or sell to a so-called uh to so-called Aryan\nmanagement, and many, many people were forced to do that. Uh, my own father found it\nincreasingly more difficult to do business because uh they, they would see to it he, he happened to\nbe a a produce uh broker who went around to the various farm communities to, to buy up uh hops\nand tobacco, uh and other items, grain. Uh, and they would see to it that that he wouldn't be able to\nbuy sometimes uh, the beginning he could still get uh some things, but uh, but it took, it was\ndefinitely becoming much harder. And so we saw uh that apparently the direction in, in which this\nthing was going, uh and it came to the point where um he no longer uh could even afford to keep\nme in the school I went to uh the uh, uh well the it, it was called Reyel Gymnasium, uh which is uh\nsomewhat like high school, but perhaps a, a notch above. Uh, and uh and for which of course you\nhad to pay tuition, so it was very difficult for him to do that, and at that point when I had to leave\nthat school um uh we all decided and we had heard of others who had done the same thing of\nyounger people taking up trades with the idea of eventually emigrating and, and, and putting those\ntrades to, to good use, where, where wherever they would go. And uh, since uh it appealed to me\nmost I, I decided to go into printing, and I began an apprenticeship in that field uh, uh with a local\nprinter, but after a few months uh the authorities uh also made it impossible for me to uh to work\nfor, for a German printer. Uh, fortunately uh I did find some employment uh in, in, in a Jewish, uh\nwith a Jewish concern, uh that kept me going uh for a while. In the meantime, uh my sister who had\nencountered similar obstacles in her work, which was nursing, had managed uh to leave Germany\nby 1936 and had come uh to the US and, and specifically to Buffalo, New York.\nNow we just have to reload.\nBeep.\nOkay, why don't you pick up with your sister--\nSure.",
        "----------and how you got out.\nDue to my sister's uh coming to the US in 1936, it was uh then (cough) through her intervention uh\nthat uh, uh I got the necessary papers that allowed me also to, to follow her in 1937, and I also\nsettled down in Buffalo.\nTell me what your learned about Kristallnacht.\nThe...the first uh inkling uh any of us had of Kristallnacht was of course the brief uh articles we\nread in the daily press here in the US, but eventually, some letters reached us that attempted to brief\nus to some extent on wha-what had happened that night. Uh, I found out, although I didn't know\nany details at that point, one of the uh things that my, I still remember, my mother mentioned in her\nletter was that she said uh, \"What happened uh on that night uh is really beyond description, I, and I\nwon't go into it here, but suffice to say that we all acquired a set of mini-furniture in a hurry,\"\nmeaning, of course, that they had come into the house and smashed all the furniture, and as we later\nfound out from uh, uh other relatives who left Germany after Kristallnacht, uh, that a gang of, of uh\nSA storm troopers invaded my parents' home that night, and they were led by a former classmate of\nmine, who had been in and out of our home, who had eaten at our table, and, and who whose house\nI had spent some time, and he lined up my elderly parents against the wall, and they all m-uh-made\nvery ominous threats tow, uh to towards them while they proceeded to vandalize uh the home and,\nand, and destroy mo-uh-most of my parents' belongings. They also uh arrested my father and\nhauled him off to the local jail and that was uh actually something that, that was still uh, uh a whole\nbetter than what happened to, to uh most people. Most men. My father uh was already quite\nelderly by that time and perhaps that uh can be uh for, for that reason perhaps uh he, he was not\nsent to a concentration camp, but all the younger and middle aged men were sent to concentration\ncamps, and we would get these uh letters subsequently in, in, in which uh my mother or father\nwould say uh, uh such and such a family uh still has no news uh, uh from their husband. Uh or uh\nsome someone uh has now been reunited and uh and we talked to them and uh and they are okay.\nUh, and eventually m-uh most of the men who, who had been arrested on Kristallnacht were in fact\num sent back home, but so-but some never made it out of, of concentration camp.\nNow um I want you to just describe the day of liberation when you came into that village.\nWell, in the final stages of World War I, uh I, we had been, I\nwas with the um, Fifth US Infantry Division which was part of Patton's Third Army, and we had\ngone through Germany, and were now approaching Czechoslovakia. Uh, the town immediately",
        "ahead of us was Volare. Uh, we had actually been bogged down in the mud because it, it rained\nfor, for, for almost a week, and uh, and uh we, we uh couldn't advance, but we were now trying to\nmake our final push to link up with the Russians, and reports reached us that uh, uh the town of\nVolare in that area known as the Sudetenland uh which is the border area between Germany and,\nand Czechoslovakia, and which at that time, uh the Sudeten German, uh, uh mostly populated by,\nby Sudeten Germans, uh at any rate that town was flying white flags from the rooftops, and so we\nknew they uh, uh they were ready to surrender, and because of uh, my uh particular assignment uh,\nuh that I had throughout the war, and because I was German speaking uh I was sent in together\nwith a small military government unit and, and one jeep of medics. Uh, there were 3 jeeps who\nwent into Volare, uh and to, to do their various uh to perform their various tasks. The uh mili-\ngovernment unit had to negotiate with the mayor about the surrender and it, it was my assignment\nto search for any remaining German troops. Uh, I did find uh a few wounded in, in a German field\nhospital, and made arrangements for uh, their evacuation, but because uh we, it was getting dark,\nthis was late in the day, we felt we had to get back to our lines, and the war was not over yet either\nat that point. Uh, so uh once uh we returned to our lines, uh we compared notes of what we had\ndone, and I learned from the military government unit that they had heard of a group of, of Polish\nand Hungarian Jewish women who had been uh dumped by their SS guards in a, in a vacant factory\nbldg, and um, who um uh had been uh liberated uh, uh by, by our troops, so I, we knew , we knew\nof course that we had to do something for them, even though we couldn't do anything that day\nanymore, and in the morning we set out uh, uh greatly reinforced to, to take care of the matter, and\nI had heard where that factory bldg was and I can remember approaching it uh and getting out of uh\nthe jeep and walking across a courtyard uh where I saw some uh skeletal figures uh, uh trying to, to\nget some water from a hand pump, but over on the other side uh, uh leaning next to the en, uh\nagainst the wall, next to the entrance of the building, I saw a girl standing there, and I decided, and\nI decided to go walk up to her, and I asked her in German and in English whether she spoke either\nlanguage, and she answered me in, in German, and uh I uh, I asked uh about her companions and\nshe said uh, \"Come let me show you,\" and we went inside the factory. Uh, it was an indescribable\nscene. Uh, there were women scattered over the floor on scraps of straw uh some, some of them\nquite obviously were with the mark of death on their faces, uh, uh, uh they, they all of them looked\njust horrible and uh of course we could see they were emaciated and, and ill, and something that I\nhave never been able to forget uh was an extraordinary thing that happened. Uh, the girl who was\nmy guide made sort of a sweeping gesture over this scene of devastation, and said the following\nwords: \"Noble be man, merciful and good,\" and I could hardly believe that she was able to\nsummon a poem by the German poet Goethe, which was called, is called 'The Divine' at such a\nmoment, and there was nothing that she could have said that would have underscored the grim\nirony of the situation better than, than uh what she did, and it was a totally shattering experience for",
        "me. Uh, huh?\nGo ahead.\nI do remember talking to one of the women who, who was lying on the floor, and she addressed me\nin English uh but all she could say, as I remembered, she muttered, \"Too late, it's too late for me,\"\nand I was later to learn that she died that same day. We did of course evacuate the, those women\nimmediately to the German field hospital, and from that point on the medics took over.\nBeep.\nCan you tell me how all those, what all those experiences have ended up meaning to you?\nWell, it shows, of course, the, the utter senselessness of man's inhumanity toward man. Uh, and\nnaturally the lesson that emerges from that is through better understanding never, never to let those\nthings happen again. It did show me how easy it 1s to incite masses of people against any minority\nwhoever they are, and that any clever demagogue who tells the people at any given time what they\nwant to hear ge-uh has them in the palm of, of his hands. So we must always guard against that\nsort of rhetoric and those movements that espouse this type of intolerance.\nAnd tell me more about this young woman who led you in there.\nWell, it, I, the rest of that first day when I met the young woman uh is a ---------- somewhat\nnebulous in my mind, and I had to go back to my, to my unit because the next day, May 8th\nhappened to be the official end of the war, and uh, there were masses of surrendering German\ntroops, and I had to help uh process, and uh, so I was kept quite busy for a number of days before I\ncould go back to ---------, but uh, I did manage to go back there a few days later, and uh, I, of\ncourse, I uh would never have forgotten the, the impression this girl had made on me, and I I found\nher soon among the many others to whom I talked in the hospital, and I uh, at that point I learned\nthat she, she had collapsed on being admitted to the hospital and was listed in critical condition, but\num, I talked to her, and, and she seemed quite lucid, and we had a lengthy chat, and...I, I, so I made\nit my business to come back to the hospital as often as I could do it, all, not only to check on the\nprogress of, of all the others, but, but in particular this, this girl, and the more I talked to her, the\nmore I realized uh what a sensitive human being she was and that she had had something very\nspecial about her, uh, call 1t an aura or whatever that that certainly interested me, and uh, so from\nthat point on uh a relationship uh um developed uh that uh later became even closer. Uh, when I",
        "had to uh leave the area as I knew uh my division would uh because there were even then rumors\nthat uh this same area would be turned over to the Russians eventually, we were still relieved by\nanother American division, but I uh exacted a promise from one of the uh captains I knew uh at that\nother division, that uh when those women would be uh, when the Russians wou-would would take\nover the area, and they themselves would have to leave, they would make it possible for uh the\nwomen to be r------- to the American zone and, and in the case of Gerda and a friend of hers, uh to,\nto be sent to where, where this Captain knew I was stationed. But in the meantime I still came\nback several times from where I was now in, in Bavaria, which meant 5-1/2 hours, a cheap ride to,\nto, to Czechoslovakia, and I came back several times to uh, uh watch her progress and, and, and\neventually she of course she got out of the critical situation.\nOkay, we have a little bit of time left. To the museum you talked about you interrogated Hitler's\nchauffeur.\nYeah.\nTell me a little bit about that.\nBeep.\nToward the end of the war, a group of German prisoners was being brought in and uh when I uh\ninterrogated them, one of them quite uh freely admitted that he had recently come from Berlin, that\nhe had been Hitler's chauffeur, and that he, he had been present uh at the time when Hitler\ncommitted suicide. Uh, and that Hitler had had given him instructions exactly what to do uh with\nhis, his body, and with that of Eva Brown, Hitler's mistress. And, he told me that um uh that they\nwere to be taken to the courtyard of the bunker at which Hitler had his headquarters, and that they\nwere to take these five gallon cans of gasoline and pour them ov-over the two bodies, and uh set\nthem on fire, and then bury them so that they would not fall in into the hands of the Russians or\nwho were taking Berlin, and because he felt, Hitler felt very strongly uh that that should not\nhappen. The chauffeur's name is Erich Kempka, and uh, uh I, I have since then uh heard the same\nstory confirmed in, in some books written by some famous historians.\nDo you have anything else that you want to talk about?\nUh, I think it uh, uh, the uh, uh, the uh, one of the major problems that the Jews of, of, of Germany\nhad at that time, and that is perhaps applicable to today's times and, and, and, and similar",
        "circumstances although no circumstances are exactly like that, uh was the fact that no country was\nwilling to take them. It was very, very difficult to, to, to get a country to, to, to accept you, and it is\nto that that I attribute the fact that my own parents never made it out, and I think people should\nhave more empathy for victims like that wherever they happen to be in the world, and really, we\nhave to come to a fuller understanding and, and, and make it possible for, for others to, to, to build\na normal life.\nWe have to -------------.\nThe following is 30 seconds of room tone for interview with Kurt Klein.\nWe have to have 30 seconds of quiet.",
