        "Question: United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, Jeff and Toby Herr collection.\nThis is an interview with Ruth Meyerowitz -- is that --",
        "Answer: Meyerowitz.",
        "Q: Meyerowitz?",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Conducted by Ben Shapiro on September 23rd, 1998, in their home in Orange, New\nJersey -- West Orange, New Jersey. And this is a follow up interview to a United States\nHolocaust Memorial Museum videotaped interview conducted with Ruth Meyerowitz on\nFebruary 20, 1990. The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum gratefully\nacknowledges Jeff and Toby Herr for making this interview possible. This 1s tape number\none, side A. That -- that -- that being done, we can actually talk. So, before we even start\nit, I -- I mean I -- I do a lot of interviews and some I -- I -- I\u2019m always so particularly a-\nappreciative to have the chance to -- I mean, apart from doing the interviews, just having\na chance to talk --",
        "A: Mm-hm, mm-hm.",
        "Q: -- to people who\u2019ve had -- have -- ha-had experiences, to me that are remarkable and\nthis 1s just certainly one of those examp-examples of that, I mean, even be -- apart from\nthis I\u2019m al -- I\u2019m -- I\u2019m always want to do this -- do the interviews for the museum, I\u2019m\nalways -- like to tell the people I\u2019m talking to just how appreciative I --",
        "A: Hm.",
        "Q: -- 1-1t\u2019s -- it\u2019s an extraordinary opportunity for me to have a chance to talk to someone\nwith -- talk to you an-and talk to you about your experiences.",
        "A: Well, mm, it\u2019s good that you are -- feel that way, because I wouldn\u2019t want to talk to\nsomeone who\u2019s just doing this, you know, for --",
        "Q: Well, yeah, of course, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s a means --",
        "A: -- you know, if --",
        "Q: -- you know, it\u2019s some --",
        "A: -- without feeling a-anything about it.",
        "Q: Yeah. Yeah, it\u2019s something that I\u2019ve -- you know, I\u2019ve read a lot about it, thought a lot\nabout, but to --",
        "A: Mm, mm.",
        "Q: -- actually have those, you know, first hand experiences, people who\u2019ve experienced\nhistory --",
        "A: Mm, mm.",
        "Q: -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- 1-1t\u2019s remarkable. A-As -- a -- I guess as you knew from -- from our\nconversation and from the -- from the letter that this -- as opposed to the interview you\ndid before --",
        "A: Yeah, but --",
        "Q: This one is -- is -- is more -- probably will m-more focus on your experiences after the\nwar.",
        "A: Right --",
        "Q: Although we\u2019ll need to talk -- I mean, that shouldn\u2019t -- you know, we should -- you\nshould feel free to talk about [indecipherable]",
        "A: Mm-hm, yeah, right, right.",
        "Q: -- appropriate, but -- one thing that I wanted to ask about, specifically, just from\nlooking at the other interview, I wonder if you could talk a little bit more about what your\nfamily was like fr -- you know, from -- from your childhood. What -- I mean, were they -\n- | mean, you know, things like was it a religious family or were you -- you know --",
        "A: Mm. I think you couldn\u2019t -- you couldn\u2019t grow up or live in the city of Frankfort, in\nGermany, without being touched by religion. There were -- of course the city had\nundergone all these movements of -- when the reform movement started, they went to\nthat one extreme and then they went to an -- the other extreme and throughout reform\nmovement and -- but generally, a-around 1850 or so, Rabbi Samson Raffelhirsch be --\ncame to Frankfort. He was Orthodox and there was an -- a t-tone of Orthodoxy all\nthroughout the city. The stores were -- Jewish stores were closed on Shabbas, except for\ntwo department stores that were owned by Jews, but they -- they -- they were open. And\nmost people kept kosher. My school was not the real -- Samson Raffelhirsch religious\nschool, it was a school that had been opened in 1804 by a secretary of one of the\nRothchild\u2019s. They had seen to a Yeshiva Baharim and walking around and they f -- and\nRothchild felt they should have a -- a secular -- or any kind of education. So he\ncommissioned his secretary to start a school for -- for them and out of this grew a school\nthat was called Filantropine, which was -- because of it\u2019s beginning was -- had the -- had\na philanthropic connotation, but by the time when my brother and I went, my father was\njoking that it cost him as much for our education as a -- what a German workman would\nearn per month. Well, not quite, but, you know, something like that. So this school really\n-- also [indecipherable] Samson Raffelhirsch school, they were always Orthodox and\nthere was no question about it. This school, when -- when -- it had started experimenting\nwith Sunday schooling and with Saturday schooling. They didn\u2019t write on Shabbat, but\nthey ha -- they had school on Shabbat. And then they gave that up again. By the time we\nwent -- this went on through the century. By the time we went to school, it was fairly --\nwell, the people who went were -- who went there were -- not the very Orthodox. So my\nparents kept kosher and we kept Shabbat, we kept Eviomtop, but we didn\u2019t -- it wasn\u2019t as\nthe other school. Now, but I remember we were 43 children in the beginning and I -- I\ndon\u2019t know -- I think one confessed that she didn\u2019t -- that that family didn\u2019t keep kosher,\nand everybody else did. So, if -- if that answers your question -- I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s\nenough. I mean we -- my parents belonged to a synagogue that was burned down in 1938\nin the Kristallnacht, that would be considered, probably Conservative by today\u2019s\nstandards, even though it was different. There was still the mareetzah, with women\nupstairs and men downstairs and other things, but it -- but it -- and it didn\u2019t have a -- an\norgan like the Reform synagogue -- that one Reform synagogue that\u2019s still standing in\nFrankfort now, but it -- it was a little less str-strict than the Samson Rafellhirsch\u2019s sh --\nsynagogue.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. And -- I mean what -- what -- how would you describe your -- o-obviously\nyour fam -- I mean, they could afford to send you to that kind of school and -- and --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Would you describe them as -- as --",
        "A: Oh, just probably middle class. I mean, we weren\u2019t ju --",
        "Q: -- middle class or [indecipherable] class or --",
        "A: Not -- maybe middle-middle class --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: -- if that\u2019s what you mean. I don\u2019t think they were -- we were extremely wealthy. My\nmo -- my parents were -- were young and my father had started a business, so perhaps if\nall that hadn\u2019t happened, we ha -- would have been in -- you know, maybe -- but we were\nvery comfortable and there was no -- but you know, I -- I can\u2019t remember -- I can\u2019t think\nof us as being comfortable in the sense that we would be in the United States, because\nfrom the moment -- I was three years old when Hitler came to power, so everything was\novershadowed by this influence -- you know, this -- this cloud hanging over us, so you\ncan\u2019t do even -- money wasn\u2019t -- of course it was important, but money wasn\u2019t always,\nyou know, the important thing.",
        "Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm. How -- how did that -- how did that affect your -- the way the\nfamily -- your family was together and the relationships within your family. The sense of\nkind of growing up, you know, under this -- kind of this growing kind of cloud and -- do\nyou think that drew family together or -- or --",
        "A: Yes, yes, I -- you know wha -- I always thought that my parents had the perfect\nmarriage because I don\u2019t remember that they ever fought. They were just always sticking\ntogether. Because I think that the outside problems were so great that there were no inner\ntensions. Sometimes I wish they would have looked more to the outside and would have\nwanted to leave and -- you know, and argue, I don\u2019t want to be here any more. One of\nthem should have said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to be here any more and let\u2019s get out.\u201d But they\ndidn\u2019t and I can\u2019t -- I\u2019m still trying to puzzle this out. I don\u2019t know why my father didn\u2019t\nleave. I mean, they relied on -- there were reasons that -- that I -- I\u2019m trying to -- I try to\nunderstand, but they really -- their marriage really seemed to be like they didn\u2019t argue.\nThey didn\u2019t -- and they were very supportive of each other. It\u2019s not that they lived side by\nside, but that they were really -- 1t was really a very close relationship.",
        "Q: Thinking about that now, do you -- wha-what are your -- some of your thoughts about\nwhy they didn\u2019t?",
        "A: That\u2019s what I felt, that they put up a united front against the outside forces.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. But wh -- but why do you think they didn\u2019t -- why -- do you -- what do you\nthink about why they didn\u2019t leave?",
        "A: Why they didn\u2019t leave?",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Well, you know, first of all, everybody wanted to go to the United States. People were\ntalking about not going -- not wanting to -- well, of course, many people went for Eur --\nto European countries -- other European countries and of course, they were invaded\nthere. I mean, Holland and Belgium and France and of course, the people who were sent\nto Poland in 1938, that the -- this expulsion of the Polish Jews, that brought on\nKristallnacht, ostensibly, becau -- that\u2019s what the Nazis said. But they -- they were all\ndestroyed, so there was really no -- no real point to -- of course we didn\u2019t know this at the\ntime. Everyone always said, \u201cOh, look at this crazy man. Look at him in the -- 1n the\nnewsreels, pounding the table and screaming away at --\u201d I mean, this has to end -- this\ncan\u2019t keep going. Of course, it ended, but 12 years too late. So one of the things I f -- my\nfather -- I felt my -- with my father, was j -- he -- my famil -- my father\u2019s family\noriginated in the medieval Frankfort ghetto. And then, when all these things with the\nReform and the Orthodox happened, the fa -- this branch of the family got tired of it and\nthey moved to Bratislava and they became well known rabbis, the Sofa family. As a\nmatter of fact, we had a megillah that was given -- made by the Sofas to -- for my\ngrandfather\u2019s wedding. And it was given to him as a gift, my grandfather had it with him,\nmy father had it. When my uncle went to Israel, my Uncle Abba, in 1936, he wanted to\ntake it with him and my father said, \u201cNo, it\u2019s got to stay with the oldest brother.\u201d And of\ncourse it was destroyed. Otherwise that beautiful thing would have been now in Israel or\nperhaps with me or in a museum or somewhere. So, my parent -- my father reali -- my\nfather kept his Czechoslovak passport, because for business, when he traveled, the\nCzechoslovak passport was accepted everywhere. Czechoslovakia was at the time the\nonly republic in Europe. They were highly respected and their passport was accepted\neverywhere and he relied on that to be able to get us out of Germany, which ultimately\ndidn\u2019t work. But -- so he, in traveling, h-he was comfortable thinking that, well, he hears\nfrom everybody that the Nazis would stop -- of course later on the -- this -- he couldn\u2019t\ngo any more. This was just in the very beginning. But he heard that well, the Nazis, I\nmean, who\u2019d look at this nonsense, this is going to stop soon. And I think that\u2019s why they\nsat. And people started going to S-South America and they wrote back such terrible\nreports. They couldn\u2019t wait to get back again and things like that, so I guess they didn\u2019t\nwant to subject us to this.",
        "Q: It\u2019s a hardship, certainly.",
        "A: Yeah, well -- what then -- in -- when Czechoslovakia was invaded, in 1938, I think it\nwas, we -- my parents sold everything in a hurry. My father relied on his passport and we\nmade our way to the French border. The borders were closed, they wouldn\u2019t let us in. We\nhad to sleep in a farmhouse overnight and then the next day we went back to Frankfort.\nI\u2019ve heard of people who followed that same route, but they were adults and they swam\nacross the river -- a river -- illegally and made their way into France. Now, my parents\ncouldn\u2019t have done this in [phone ringing] Sorry. What\u2019s the next question?",
        "Q: Well, I guess the next question is what -- what do you -- what do you remember about\nyourself, kind of as -- as a -- as a child? What kind of -- do you know what -- what kind\nof kid were you, do you think?",
        "A: Oh, I was --",
        "Q: What -- what kind of -- what were you thinking about? What were you -- what did you\nlike doing [indecipherable]",
        "A: I was very sh -- I think I was very shy. My -- I have one friend that went to school\nwith me. His -- he survived because his mother was not Jewish, his father was Jewish and\nthey sent him -- they didn\u2019t send him to an extermination camp, though if the war would\nhave lasted a little bit longer, they probably would have, too, but he was survived in\nTheresienstadt. And he remembers me as being very shy and laid back. But what I\nremember was that I was not happy in school. I was the youngest, I was the smallest and\nI just -- I was just not happy. Even though this was a wonderful school and I mean, I\nremember the -- the little bit of Greek that we learned and the Latin that -- this was an\noutstanding school and it was the best school in -- in Europe, I think. And whatever math\nI would know, I remember from -- from the Filantropine. But -- so, that was me, what -- I\nwas shy, I was always afraid. And I -- I think I still am. I don\u2019t make waves, I don\u2019t raise\nissues, which 1s really not good. What can I tell you? This is what happened to me. That\u2019s\nwhat you --",
        "Q: What -- what do you li -- what were your favorite things as a kid? What did you like\nto do and what did you --",
        "A: Oh, I read. I read a lot. Well, especially after my uncle -- my Uncle Abba went to\nIsrael, he left behind -- and so, I was six or seven years old and I was reading Ibsen and\nCheckov. And when I did this in college, I read it -- I ran into it, I said, \u201cGee, sure, this 1s\nwhat I read when I was a child.\u201d Didn\u2019t quite -- but what I was reading, you know, for\ninstance, Checkov -- Ibsen\u2019s \u201cGhost,\u201d I ha -- my father had to explain to my what\nsyphilis was. So, you know, you see -- a seven year old shouldn\u2019t be inter -- shouldn\u2019t be\nreading these things, but I did. So that was me.",
        "Q: And how do you think the -- the climate of what was -- what was going on in\nGermany at the time affected you -- your -- your -- you know, I mean, children are very\nsensitive to what\u2019s going on around them and --",
        "A: Oh, oh, a definite ow, I mean h-how could it not have?",
        "Q: Sure.",
        "A: We were -- we had a Nazi living in -- downstairs from us in an apartment and we were\nchildren, we fid -- after school if we\u2019d run up the stairs, he would complain that we ran. If\na chair was moved upstair -- you know, he could hear it downstairs, so he\u2019d take a --\nwhatever it was, a broom or something and hit the ceiling because we were making too\nmuch noise. It was a real -- you know, so it -- it was awful. And Sunday mornings, there\nwere always these lectures on -- the speeches by Hitler. You went outside, everything\nwas quiet. The church bells -- bells were going on one side and Hitler\u2019s voice was\ncoming from every radi -- everybody wanted to show how good a Nazi he was, so they\nturned on the radios, you know, loud, so everybody could sh -- hear, and then what -- for\nwhatever -- I guess that was the reason. And, so you could hear him talking from one end\nto another and it is scary. Of course, to me, just the voice was scary, the contents I didn\u2019t\nunderstand, but the voice and -- and this whole ambiance was scary. We couldn\u2019t go\nswimming any more, because we were told there were at-attempts at drowning. We had\ngone swimming in a public park, in a pond. Whe -- a -- all Jewish people, unless they\nwent on vacation, in a -- but the ones who stayed in the city for any time went swimming\nthere. Then the public -- there were public baths and you couldn\u2019t go swimming there in -\n- th-they were closed to Jews, but the other you co -- in the park, for instance, you\ncouldn\u2019t go because there were attempts of drownings, so of course we didn\u2019t go any\nmore. And people moved from the small towns -- Jews moved from the small towns to p\n-- fi -- to Frankfort because they felt a little bit safer in the -- in a crowd. So people came\nan -- into the school -- new students came in. Other students left for wherever they were\ngoing. It was -- and the same thing with teachers. So, they were always coming and going\nand it was -- it was not a very settled situation. However, as I said I was reading and I --\nwe tried to -- I guess our parents tried as to live as normal a life, but I guess I didn\u2019t know\nany different, because I grew up with all that, so I just went along.",
        "Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm. Still, it must have been kind of -- do you -- do you have memories\nof -- of -- of things progressing and gradually going --",
        "A: Oh, I -- I -- I -- the real --",
        "Q: [indecipherable]",
        "A: -- yes, well -- you know when I was, oh, probably about four or five years old, my\nparents were walking with us in the park and some SS -- no, I mean a -- a Hitler youth\nboy on a bicycle ran into me and drove over my leg and my parents couldn\u2019t complain. If\nthey\u2019d go to the police station, they -- my parents would be arrested or who knows what\nthey would do to us? So you couldn\u2019t because you know, we -- my husband and my --\nour sons, went back to Frankfort probably about 20 years ago. I didn\u2019t want to go, but my\nhusband had business there and he said, \u201cOh we should go to the Jewish places,\u201d and\nthat\u2019s what -- actually what we did. So we went to the -- a -- from where we lived, just --\nwas about a long block to the school, block and a half. And on the way was -- one of the\nhouses that had not been damaged, or had been repaired, it wasn\u2019t pulled down\ncompletely. And I recognized it and I told them a story. There was a little girl, who went\nto school with my brother. Because they were walking home on the same way and he --\nhe just had a few more houses to -- further to go, we -- I started teasing him that this was\nhis girlfriend and he didn\u2019t like it, but whatever. The father had suddenly done something\nthat the Nazis didn\u2019t like. They didn\u2019t punish him, but they took this little girl and they\nhad her sterilized and returned to the parents. And when you hear these things -- I mean,\nmy -- I -- my parents, you know, it was very difficult, they didn\u2019t say anything, because\nyou didn\u2019t want to tell children so much. Number one, they would be very frightened, but\nnumber two, if they talked, it was dangerous. So it was best if children knew as little as\npossible. But this particular incident, I guess the -- we were talking about all the ti -- they\nwere tal -- not all the time, but they were talking about it, because it just couldn\u2019t be\nhidden. So, can you imagine how this poor father felt, that they did this to his daughter?\nIt\u2019s a little girl, I mean just maybe nine years old. I didn\u2019t even know -- I don\u2019t even\nknow if they -- what they could have done to -- but whatever it was, that 1s -- that\u2019s what\nwe heard. So you had this kind of fear all the time that you couldn\u2019t talk, you couldn\u2019t be\nloud. You couldn\u2019t be -- God forbid, obnoxious in the street or something, you know,\nbecause people -- there was always a Nazi waiting in -- in someplace waiting for you,\nyou know?",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Did you -- did you have -- kind of hopes for -- for what would -- what you\nwanted to do after this was all over? I mean, did you -- did you kind of think, well, you\nknow when this is over, when I grow up, Ill be a, you know, whatever. You know, did\nyou think about those things when you were a kid?",
        "A: Ah, yes I guess y-you do. What I\u2019m -- what I\u2019d -- the people I admired were my\ndoctor, so I figured I should be a doctor. But that was -- I didn\u2019t have any other plans,\nother than that. But I -- it was only -- it was all in the framework of remaining in the city.\nI never dreamt of anything like Auschwitz of -- obviously not. So, after that, I didn\u2019t have\n-- during that time I didn\u2019t have that kind of -- those kind of plans. I mean, survival was\nwhat was important, you know.",
        "Q: Sure.",
        "A: And no -- not the plan to go do things, you know.",
        "Q: When you were -- when you were growing up in -- in the 30\u2019s, did you -- I mean do\nyou think that as a child, with that -- the -- the -- the -- with what was going on, did that --\ndid that kind of close off your imagination of the future at all or -- or do you -- do you\nthink that --",
        "A: A-Actually not.",
        "Q: -- or you just kind of didn\u2019t -- didn\u2019t -- you just figured 1t would kind of go\n[indecipherable |",
        "A: Yeah, well, you know, I was always convinced that it had to come to an end. I mean, I\n-- | didn\u2019t -- when I was in Auschwitz, of course, I didn\u2019t know if I would survive it, but I\nalways knew that this has to end. I was like -- 1t was -- is what imprinted in me that it\nwould -- it would come to an end and then everything would be all right and of course\npeople said it, but while you\u2019re going through, it looks like it\u2019s never going to end, but\njust somehow you -- I knew it would -- would be -- come to an end.",
        "Q: At -- at -- at what point did that begin to change. I mean, you know, obviously they\nsay it was different when you were at Auschwitz, but at what point did -- do you\nremember your -- maybe your parents started to be aware, or you or the people around\nyou --",
        "A: Well you --",
        "Q: -- being aware that things --",
        "A: -- It --",
        "Q: -- were really going to get worse before they got better. And I mean a lot worse --",
        "A: Well, you know, it -- it was getting better and it was g -- I mean, it was getting worse\nand in fact, you know, it was getting worse. But that was one thing, but there was another\nthi -- instinct in me that said, \u201cThis is going to have to end.\u201d Whether I survived it or n --\nonce I got to Auschwitz, whether I survived it or not was, of course, questionable. And\nvery often, i-it was such a struggle to be in Auschwitz, that I -- I didn\u2019t want to live -- that\nI didn\u2019t want to survive, because I figured I\u2019m going to die anyway, so what is so -- I\nmight as well not struggle, and die now. And you know, that\u2019s how -- but on another\nlevel, an inner level, a lo -- I don\u2019t know, I felt that this 1 -- of course this has to end.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. How about before you went away, how -- th-th-the final period, when you\nwere in -- in -- in Frankfort? What was -- what was starting -- what was happening then\nin --",
        "A: Oh, well --",
        "Q: [indecipherable] you know --",
        "A: We -- as -- I told you we -- my father had Czechoslovak citizenship. Our friends from\nschool, most of the friends were sent away in 1942. I don\u2019t know how they died, either on\na -- on a truck, where they put the gas in or on a -- in a railroad car, where they put -- put\nthe gas in and so but we went -- because my father was a Czechoslovak and then Slovak\ncitizen, we were protected -- and it\u2019s very strange, by this -- I think it was -- his name was\nTiso, Father Tiso, the president of Slovakia. The area b-by the slava -- where my pa -- p -\n- father\u2019s family was from, became, after the Nazis occupied Czechoslovak, the Czech\npart, Bohemia and Mulravia, that Slovakian part became inde -- sort of independent, but\nit wa -- he was a Nazi, he collaborated with th-the Nazis. And when we came to\nAuschwitz, there were oodles -- I -- I mean, there had been several thousand, but of\ncourse they had died at a terrible rate because when they got to Auschwitz it was already\n-- there was nothing there. When we came, there were at least barracks. But they -- th --\nthey -- it was totally in -- unorganized and they slept in the winter in the mud. It was terri\n-- the things they told us and we could easily imagine it. So, on the one hand, he sent out\nthe young women into -- to certain death and didn\u2019t protect them. On the other hand, he\nwent through this diplomatic sham and protected the citizens -- Jewish citizens that were\nliving in different European countries. So we were not sent away until 1n -- in 1942, when\neverybody went, and then -- but hit -- the -- the Nazis were losing the war at that point, in\n1942, El Allemagne and in -- in Russia, in the different -- Stalingrad and probably\nLeningrad. So they wanted to show what they could do, they get rid of all the Jews, so\nthey would have this wonderful triumph of losing on one hand, but look what they\u2019ve\ndone, they\u2019ve killed a couple of more children and weak people and anyone, you know.\nSo we -- I -- a -- what was the beginning of the question? I started --",
        "Q: You -- when you were talking, you were talking about the -- the period right up until -\n- or --",
        "A: Yeah, right, well we had -- yeah --",
        "Q: -- the 40\u2019s -- early 40\u2019s, I guess.",
        "A: So we -- yes, well this was 1n -- a -- right after everybody was taken away from -- in\n1942, they started in with us and we were taken out of the apartment and we had to move\nin a mini -- it was a mini ghetto. It was a -- an old apartment building in the east part of\nthe town, very old, it had been part of the Jewish area that was for people who came f -- I\nmean for -- people who came from Poland, didn\u2019t have much money, st -- wanted to be\nclose to the kosher butchers and all the kosher areas. So they lived in that particular are --\nand the houses were older. People who could afford it, had been longer in the city, moved\nout to the west end part of the town. So we were put back into this east side, into one of\nthe streets. And we were not allowed to leave. So for -- a-all -- I re -- know that it was\nthat Hanukkah we were still -- we were there already. So maybe we went in the fall of\n1942, that we went in. And the only one who could go out, was my father, because -- it\u2019s\nalso a long story -- do you have all this tape?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Okay. My father had a factory of -- man-manufactured leather goods. I mean, not a\nbig factory, like a shop. And -- w-with a partner and in Offenback, which is across the\nriver from Frankfort -- I mean not -- it\u2019s a little further. And then it was not safe, or\nwhatever and they moved -- I mean, I don\u2019t know any of these details. They moved to a -\n- a loft in Frankfort in back of the railroad station. When my father -- then his partner left\nfor the United States. We\u2019ve tried to go to the United -- my father registered for the -- my\nfather had na -- had Czechoslovak citizenship and the quota of -- for the Slovakia was\nseven families a year, yeah. It -- we had number 77 and we -- so we would have had 10 --\n11 years to wait before we would even be called to the council. Now the council in\nStuttgart, he -- he should -- he -- he was a partner of Hitler\u2019s and he should -- I hope he\nrests with -- with Hitler together in hell, because he -- they -- it was a dreadful experience\nfor Jews to go there and he humiliated people and they -- I mean, it\u2019s not just him,\nwhoever it was, they -- ll give you an example. My fr-friend Irma -- my fr -- her father\nwas a lawyer, but when they figured they\u2019d have to leave, he wouldn\u2019t be able to make a\nliving as a lawyer, so he became a chef. They were called -- they had quite wealthy\nrelatives in the United States who put up as -- the affidavits. They were called, finally, to\nthe council in Stuttgart and he -- the -- she -- my friend passed and her mother passed and\nth -- they had been given mental tests and sometimes they picked such stupid questions to\ntrap people and then call them inf -- mentally inferior and they\u2019re not good enough to\ncome to the United States. So they p-passed all this. And then they found out that the\nfather, when he was 18, had his kid -- one kidney removed. Now, he -- it was healed, he\nbecame a lawyer, he became a father. So there was no reason to wi -- to hold him back,\nbut they did. And because of that, the family was lost. So -- and then -- coming -- I -- I --\nit\u2019s really not nice to talk about some of -- but one of the questions -- I remember they\nasked this poor woman who went -- her husband was already in the United States, she\nwent with her son to Stuttgart. And they asked -- they finally gave her this mental test\nand they told he -- they -- the question was, \u201cWhat does your husband have in his pants?\u201d\nAnd the poor woman got all flustered. Here was this modest woman who -- she probably\nnever heard a dir -- a dirty word or a dirty joke and then oh, they -- they ask her this. And\nof course she gets all flustered and she couldn\u2019t answer. So then they said, \u201cOh, but you\nmust be awfully stupid. He has a wallet and keys and a handkerchief. Why can\u2019t you\nthink of that?\u201d Well, she -- the poor woman, her life depended on it, so she couldn\u2019t think\nof it. And those were the -- the things that they did and that\u2019s why I feel thas -- so\nstrongly about this -- the person who ran this un -- drun -- they were horrible. So --",
        "Q: What -- what do you remember about right around the late 30\u2019s -- er -- like -- like --",
        "A: Yeah?",
        "Q: -- \u00a339 -- \u201840?",
        "A: Well, when we were in this -- this building -- so my father -- my father --\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "A: Yeah?",
        "Q: -- \u00a339 -- \u201840?",
        "A: Well, when we were in this -- this building -- so my father -- my father -- this -- his --\nhis business was given to a Nazi, who was a dentist, a Dr. Holzman. And my fa -- 1-it was\nan award because he wa -- a reward for being -- for -- for being what he was. And I can\ntell you wh -- a-about it, as much as I know. He didn\u2019t know the first thing about my\nfather\u2019s business, which was manufacturing wallets, belts, pocketbooks. So, he kept my\nfather on and he needed -- he was frequently out of town and he needed someone to run\nthe business, so actually my -- my father was running the business for him, but not as the\nowner. When he wanted to confer with my father on something -- anything -- a design or\na button on a -- on a wallet, he would call him into my father\u2019s former office, open up the\ndrawer of my father\u2019s former desk, and there was a gun and the conversation was\nconducted over the gun, as if my father would do something to him, you know, but he\nhad to protect himself and show his authority and have -- to have this gun there. What\nthis man really was at -- when -- the rumors were -- and the rumors are pretty accurate\nduring the war -- during those times, but the rumors were that when he -- when there was\nan -- some kind of rumor of an assassination, of a killing, he was out of town. He must\nhave been the assassin and that\u2019s why they rewarded him with this business and that is\nwhy my -- h-he was very -- very often out of town and my father had to run the business\nfor him.",
        "Q: And what -- what -- when did your father lose the business -- the -- when was that?",
        "A: When did he lose it?",
        "Q: Yeah, what year did -- was the [indecipherable]",
        "A: Oh, I don\u2019t know that. I mean, it had to be -- were probably sometime in 1942 and I\ndon\u2019t remember the -- the details. And I tell you, we were so beset from all sides that I-I\ndon\u2019t -- I don\u2019t know any more, exactly when -- when all this happened. All I know is\nthat towards the end, my f -- but when we were not -- before we were taken out of the\napartment, my f-father -- before we were moved into the ghet -- into this ghetto building,\nmy f -- he wanted my father to work at home and I had to bring the st -- the -- pick up the\nmaterials and deliver the ready made goods to him, in to -- in the office. I don\u2019t even\nknow with whom I spoke. I was looking for the name of the street and that was a street\nthat had been renamed with an Aryan name, so it\u2019s not even in existence any more and\neverything\u2019s been bombed. I couldn\u2019t even find the place any more. So it\u2019s -- it\u2019s been a -\n- you know, it was a terrible experience and it was -- and going back, I guess I -- in -- ina\nway it was good that I didn\u2019t see any of 1t any more. But then when my father was --\nwhen we moved into the -- into this ghetto building, my father went to work and he was\nthe only one who was -- of the family who was able to go out and work.",
        "Q: What did -- it struck me about the -- do you -- the -- was -- oh, I thought your\nexperiences generally was -- I ha -- I -- I have been under the impression that -- several\nthings about your experiences were very unusual. First of -- first, that -- that you stayed\nwith your mother. That you were together th-through that experience --",
        "A: Mm, well --",
        "Q: -- and | -- I had -- that -- I mean, of all the, you know --",
        "A: Yeah, right.",
        "Q: [indecipherable]",
        "A: Oh, no, there were some people that -- yeah, but most of the time, they didn\u2019t even let\nthem into the camp. They didn\u2019t even survive enough, you know, to get into the camp.\nWhat happened again was that because we were the Czechoslovak -- and there were a\ncouple of Romanian citizens who were sort of protected, for awhile and there were a few\nmembers of a -- who had -- people who had been from mixed marriages. And it was very\neasy when the Christian partner was tired of the Jew, to say oh, he said something against\nNazi or he did something there and this and there wa -- there was some -- so there were a\nfew Jewish people -- the Jewish partners of those marriages in the -- in this building with\nus. So, I think we was 37 all together.",
        "Q: And the last -- you\u2019re the last [indecipherable]",
        "A: Actually, the last -- I -- I hear now that some people survived, they were hidden. I\ndon\u2019t -- I don\u2019t -- didn\u2019t know anyone who was hidden, but we were really the last Jews.\nSo they put us on the train and we traveled for seven days. We traveled during the day\nand we stopped at night, because they didn\u2019t want the trains to be bombed and the Royal\nAir Force was, at that time, only -- mostly bombing at night. Later on they -- when the\nradar was better or whatever and they -- they were strong there, and the Nazis were --\ntheir guns were already knocked out, they were -- they were bombing during the day. So,\nat that time, we -- we were moving, that\u2019s why this -- these few hundred miles from\nFrankfort to Auschwitz took seven days to get us to. Well, what happened then, as I said\nbefore, they had -- the na -- the -- Hitler was losing, the Nazis were losing 1-in --\nmilitarily, so for his birthday, on the 19th of April -- the 20th of April was Hitler\u2019s\nbirthday, on the 19th they made him a present that Germany would be Judenrein and they\npacked us on the train on the 19th and sent us off to Auschwitz. Well, on the way, we\npicked up Polish non -- non-Jewish slave laborers, who might have complained, probably\nthat the food wasn\u2019t good, or that they were working too hard, or whatever and instead of\na slave labor camp, they were now sent to Auschwitz. But when we arrived, they were\nseparated from us and we were just the 37 of us and the men -- we -- I never saw my\nfather again. So, the men were in one way -- so we were probably -- maybe 15 or so\nJews, two children, my brother and a-another young boy. And I was not considered a\nyoung -- a -- a-- achild any more, because I could pass as a woman. I was 13, so I could\npass, looking like a woman. I mean, considered how emaciated everybody was there, I\nprobably looked like a big, strong person, you know. But -- so we were brought into the\ncamp, my mother and I and a couple of the other women. My a -- and my brother too.\nAnd we were tattooed. Our clothes were taken off and our hair was shaved and the other\nprisoners introduced us to this wonderful life in -- in Auschwitz. They were telling us\nwhat -- there\u2019s the gassing and there\u2019s the selections and everything -- it was like -- but\nthere was so many, it wasn\u2019t that I could get scared, because there was so many new\nimpressions coming in on me, that wer -- I was like -- I was absorbing it, but I couldn\u2019t --\ni-1t didn\u2019t sort of synthesize in my mind, but I knew it was happening. So that wh --\namong one of the things that they said was that, you know, they wouldn\u2019t take you -- they\nwouldn\u2019t take you into the gas chambers now, because for a few people, it doesn\u2019t pay to\nrun the gas chamber. So they\u2019Il figure you\u2019ll die or the next time there\u2019s a selection\nthey\u2019ll take you. And that\u2019s actually what it was.",
        "Q: So you mean that they -- th -- th-that part of Auschwitz was already kind of -- there\nwere so few people that were remaining at that point, that the transport -- the whole\noperation of bringing the transport to the gas [indecipherable]",
        "A: Well, it was -- it was actually Birkenau wh -- Auschwitz, but, you know, we stayed in\nBirkenau.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Well, they brought people in. I don\u2019t know why they didn\u2019t do like in Majdanek -- in -\n- where did they have, Treblinka or Sobibor, where they killed people upon arrival,\neverybody. There will -- Auschwitz was a -- a camp. There was a -- the man\u2019s -- the\nmen\u2019s camp and then -- this was actually Birkenau again and one side -- I -- I\u2019m pointing\nbecause straight ahead were the crematorium and to the right were -- was the man\u2019s\ncamp. To the left were the two women\u2019s camps. In back of the man\u2019s camp -- camp was a\ng -- Gypsy lager and now the Gypsy get recognized, unfortunately they don\u2019t -- they\naren\u2019t recognized as having suffered as much, but now at least, they speak out. For the\nlongest time, no one remembered. They brought in whole families, put them in the -- into\nthis Gypsy camp, Segonnalager and every few months or so, they emptied out the\ncomplete camp, gassed everybody and then brought in more. I don\u2019t know where they\nfound all these people, but it was -- it was a horrible -- I -- I think -- the whole horrible to\ns -- to think that the whole family -- of course, 1t happened to our people, too, but there 1s\nwas visible to me. And that whole families were just dest -- overnight destroyed. It was --\nit was horrible. So this -- but in Auschwitz, people died. When I -- when we walked in,\nthere was a nurse with us, from Romania and it was a beautiful, bright day and the Nazi\nofficer there 1s standing with their boots polished and their pure, white gloves and their\nuniforms crisp and f -- ironed and we saw a woman being carried on a litter and you\ncould see that she was dead, except that I had never seen a dead person and -- I was 13\nyears old. So, this nurse said to me, \u201cOh, she\u2019s just sick.\u201d She didn\u2019t want me to be so\nfrightened. So people died at a tremendous rate in Auschwitz. And, when they didn\u2019t die\nand they were -- they died too slowly, they had the gas chambers, they had these\nselections and they brought in more people all the time. And the conditions were awful.\nThe f -- we had horrible food. In the morning we had something that was like tea -- I\nmean, they didn\u2019t even have the color of tea, they called it tea. I think 1t was because it --\nit took on the color because the barrels that they carried it in were rusty. So, that\u2019s what --\nwhy it was tea. They gave us something that was like an inch of bread and like a slice\nthat was about an inch thick and it was -- well, the bread probably was healthy because it\nwasn\u2019t any refined flour. Then they gave us a slice -- oh, probably also about an inch and\na half of either liverwurst or salami. And towards the end of my stay in Auschwitz, one\ntime | -- this was in the sum -- in the summer of 1944, when they were killing -- bringing\nin Hungarian Jews and they were killing them day and night. And I looked out at the\ncrematorium and I saw the smoke going up and I visualized that my piece of salami was\nhuman flesh and I couldn\u2019t eat it any more. I -- I -- whenever there was -- whenever I got\nthe salami -- we didn\u2019t get that every day, we got that like two, three times a week or so.\nWhenever I got it, I tra -- tried to trade it for a piece of bread, because I just couldn\u2019t eat\nit. And then -- I don\u2019t know -- I -- if we had three meals or two meals, but usually when\nwe came back from work and -- which was in -- in -- the first work we did was digging in\na field and they told us to f -- to dig here with this decrepit shovel that was all bent and\nyou couldn\u2019t get anything. And then wi -- after they filled this in, we -- and it was very,\nvery muddy in Auschwitz, there was a thick clay and mud. It was horrible. So they told\nus to dig here and then they filled this in. And then when there was a hole that we had\ndug, we had to fill it in again. It was designed to make us lose weight and lose spirit and\nwith the few hundred calories that they gave us, it was a -- you know, th -- every --\npeople died fr-from malnutrition alone, but there were other things, too. So --",
        "Q: So were -- were you with your -- who -- you were -- what was your relationship like\nwith your mother at that point --",
        "A: Well, we --",
        "Q: -- you must have relied on each other to a tremendous degree.",
        "A: My mother -- I turned around, they shaved our hair off. My mother -- I -- and we had\nno clothes on and that was when we first arrived. And I called for her and she answered\nme and I turned around and she wasn\u2019t -- I couldn\u2019t recognize her, because -- I mean, she\nhad no hair, she was in the nude. But my mother was a real strength, while we were in\nAuschwitz -- an-and everywhere -- my mother was a real strength to everyone. There\nwere young women there, they knew they would never see their mother\u2019s again, so they\nsort of adopted my mother and my mother would tell them, \u201cYou know it\u2019s going to be\nbetter, we\u2019re going to get out.\u201d And one of the strange things that -- I -- I don\u2019t know if\nthat can -- how that con -- how a psychologist would explain it, they spoke about food. I\nguess we were So starved that they spoke about food. They spoke about recipes and my\nmother actually provided recipes, how do you stuff a goose, how do you make certain\nchicken soup and they were going -- they were going -- I mean, with this -- with this\ncrummy food that we had, the two or 300 calories a day, they were daydreaming of all\nthis wonderful food and all the recipes and my mother encouraged it, because she saw\nthat\u2019s what they needed. And she always encouraged everybody. Once, there was a\nwoman who had give -- had enough poison to ki -- for her two children. When she came\nto Auschwitz, the first thing she wa-wanted to do was she ran to the electric wire, hoping\nto get -- electrocute herself, or on the way there, with the guards watching this and they\nwould shoot at her and kill her. And my mother ran after her and like -- there was a moat\nabout three feet deep before the electric wire and like a few feet -- and the guard was\nalready ready to shoot, because it was after say lapel in the evening, when you were not\nallowed to be outside. And my mother was after -- and she pulled her back in. Actually,\nthe woman survived and came to see us once, in Frankfort. So this is -- these are the\nkinds of things my mother was capable of. While we were in camp -- I wi -- she was a\nreal source of strength to everybody. Once we got out and we got into Frankfort, she was\nlike -- the ho -- all of her collapsed and she was -- I always said that it is a -- it was as\nthough someone had put a giant hand over her trachea and she could inhale enough air to\nexist, but not to live. And she -- she just -- she -- she looked at this destruction of\nFrankfort -- we came into Frankfort and th-the city was bombed. I think I could adjust\nbecause I was able to say, \u201cOh thank God there isn\u2019t one stone sticking next to the other.\u201d\nMy mother said, when she came in -- she was -- she had a ter -- a terrible fear. Her first\nimpression was that she was just frightened. Now, to me, I was 17, it seemed that my life\nwas ahead. To her, her home was gone, her whole family -- her f -- her husband. So she --\nas I said, she just existed, for the next 40 years. She existed, but she didn\u2019t live. She\ncouldn\u2019t enjoy herself, she was very difficult to get along with, with everybody. And she\nwas always dour, she was always depressed and she had a terrible -- I mean, it\u2019s -- she\nwas a real victim of the -- the Holocaust, again.",
        "Q: What -- am -- at what point did you see her make that tran -- but she wasn\u2019t like that a-\nas long as she -- until after the war, right? I mean, she was --",
        "A: Right, yeah. As soon as we came into Frankfort. As soon as we returned, which was --\nwe were liberated in May eighth, in 1945 and we were taken to a camp -- an open air ta --\ncamp, with tents, because it was in the spring. And it was run by the British army. They\nprovided food and a measure of clothing and medical care. My mother was in the hospital\nfor a few days, because her -- er -- the -- we were given -- the Red Cross -- the Swedish\nRed Cross had sent in food packages and we were given like first -- two people to a\npackage and by the time it got to us, it was five people to a package, which was really a\nlifesaver, because there were sardines and chocolate and thing and butter. And our\nstomachs weren\u2019t used to this and my mother was very, very sick from eating this. I mean\nfrom -- maybe one sardine and one piece of chocolate, or whatever and she had to be\ntaken to the hospital for about two days to get her stomach -- I don\u2019t know what the heck\n-- | think they gave her cereals or whatever to -- to str -- get this straightened out. So she -\n- when we -- when we got back to Frankfort, she was frightened. And I don\u2019t know how\nshe felt -- why she felt that she was frightened, but because of everything was gone and --\nand I think the strength she had was hoping maybe -- you know, we were hoping that\nmaybe my father would be alive, but it -- 1t seemed hopeless when -- once we got into the\ncity. We had arranged with everybody that we would go back to Frankfort, because then\nas a family, whoever would live would go. But he -- of course we knew that he wasn\u2019t\nalive. I was hoping -- I was hoping all the time.",

        "A: What was the date that -- President Roosevelt died in April sometime and I th -- some\nof the soldiers that were guarding us thought that this would be a turn around, but most of\nthem didn\u2019t think that the allies would give up. They knew they had lost the war. We\nwere in Mahlhoff, which was a slave labor camp. We had worked -- we had made bullets\nand grenades in an underground factory, hidden in the woods, which looked like -- you\nknow, it didn\u2019t look like there was any woods, but -- I mean, it didn\u2019t look like an -- there\nwas a factory, it was like little hills and there was a door and you walked in and there was\nfactories. And we -- but they stopped it, but the whole camp -- I mean, we had to walk\nquite a bit, but I understand that, the whole camp was honeycombed underneath with all\nthese factories and we didn\u2019t know -- we were thinking, \u201cWell, you know, the war is\ncoming to an end, they wouldn\u2019t want us to survive, they\u2019re probably going to blow up\nthe whole camp.\u201d But th -- I -- they didn\u2019t. They couldn\u2019t, because there were roads --\ntwo roads outside. I mean, one main road where the -- the soldiers --- the army was\nretreating, going west and the Germans of Polish na -- the Germans of -- that lived in\nPoland, folksdorger, that had lived in Poland, were now afraid of what the Russians\nwould do to them, because they had welcomed Hitler back and they had hidden their\nspies. So wh -- when -- the German spies, so when the Germans were ready to invade\nPoland, it fell like a ripe apple, because all this underground work had been done by the\nspies. So now, when they knew the Russians were coming, they were very much afraid\nand they took that road back. So the roads were clogged, so they couldn\u2019t really have\nblown us up. Well, they stopped giving us food. This was -- must have been the -- the last\ntwo days of April. And we didn\u2019t go to work any more. They stopped giving us food and\nwe -- there was a food riot. We went into -- can you stop for a minute?",

        "A: Well, you know, their minds were already on other things. I mean, they knew they had\nlost the war.

So we ran into this thing and it looked like the -- then -- the-\nthese Nazi soldiers had just gotten up. They left their food in the middle of the table with\nth -- the -- half eaten and they ran away, because they -- they knew that there were\nsoldiers -- the Russians probably were coming. So we raced -- and we -- we saw the food,\nbut all at once, we were looking for bigger and better and we raced through this storage\nplace and I found something that looked like noodles. So I wanted to take these noodles,\nwe hadn\u2019t had noodles in years. I\u2019m -- my God and what would I do? I -- I was wearing\ntwo pairs of underpants. One was the what -- what they gave us, a gray flannel and then,\nillegally, under it, I was wearing a pink silk that I had found someplace, 1t wasn\u2019t much\nof anything. And so I kept the pink silk on and I took off the gray flannel, pulled out the\nstring that was holding it on top, tied the legs together and put -- put these noodles into\nthe -- into these pants and walked away with it. And then, for -- we ate whatever we\ncould find. And I must tell you something, again with this -- Gypsies. A whole group of\nGypsies were brought to the camp and kept in a separate area. They had walked from I\ndon\u2019t know where, but -- and on the way they found dead horses and they found\nwhatever the -- food they could find and they brought it to camp with them. And do you\nknow, when someone would walk over -- and my mother told me don\u2019t go there. But wh\n-- if someone walked over, they would share the food with everybody. The only thing\nthey did was also that they -- they looked for th -- wood for to make it -- to barbecue the\nfood, you know, roast it a little bit. So they took everything apart. In the end, we couldn\u2019t\neven go to the toilets any more, because they had taken off the toilet seat -- you know\nthese planks that served as -- to -- as seats, to -- and they -- they burned everything. They\ntook the doors off the -- but, 1t was right, you know, that they did this. Well, anyway, we\nwere given this -- these boxes of food and we were told that we were leaving. And I\u2019m\ncarrying these potatoes -- I-I\u2019m sorry, the noodles with me. And then, on the way, we ran\nout of food and there was no one to supply us with anything. Every so often, in a field,\nwe would find little potatoes. We didn\u2019t wash them, ba -- there\u2019s no -- no way of\nwashing, w-we -- there was barely a fire. So we ate them ho -- half raw and full of sand\nand grit a-and we ate it like that. And then finally I said to my mother, \u201cYou know, I\u2019m\ncarrying these noodles and we got to cook them.\u201d Th -- She found a rusted tin can, we\nfound some water from somewhere and we started -- in the fire, we started cooking it.\nAnd as we were cooking this, this grew and grew and grew. It didn\u2019t act like noodles, it\ngrew and grew. And what I had cherished right along, while we were eating all these\npotatoes, I said, \u201cOh, I can\u2019t stand to look at these potatoes.\u201d What I had taken was\ndehydrated potatoes. So, my grandchildren now tell me, \u201cBut you say you would never\neat another potato. And so how come you\u2019re eating potatoes now?\u201d So this is one of the\nfunny -- well, funny, comical stories that came out of the Holocaust. But anyway, we\nwere walking -- now the end of the camp, it just -- we just stopped working and we -- and\nwe hung around and then they told us that we had to leave. So they lined us up five at a ti\n-- now, sometime -- some of the guards went -- I recognized some that were from\nAuschwitz that had just somehow appeared there, because they were running away. And\nothers were -- the ones that we had regularly had, and we walked. I guess we were\nwalking we -- to the west, but it was -- this was fairly north and there was a lake there.\nBut I right along thought we were along the North Sea, but we were a little bit south of\nthat.",
        "Q: Where -- where we hoping -- wh -- did they -- were you -- were th -- had the soldiers\nleft or did they order you to march?",
        "A: They ordered us to march and they were still -- I mean, I was amazed. The war was\nover, they knew they had lost and they were still carrying out orders of -- of making us\nobey.",
        "Q: Where were they hoping to take you? Or what did they -- where did they tell you they\nwere taking you?",
        "A: I si -- just away from --",
        "Q: Away from the s --",
        "A: -- from wherever it was, you kn -- west. I mean, I know we were walking west\nbecause no one wanted to be going to the Russians, they were really -- I mean, they knew\nwhat they had done in Stalingrad or Leningrad and in -- in -- in all the cities in between,\nso they were very fearful of this revenge. And we walked and then we walked the fields\nand one time -- I think the last night, we came to a city and we came into a -- what had bi\n-- was an abandoned sugar factor -- sugar refinery. And we were settling in for the night\nand we had found some food already, that we were able to steal from the Germans and I\nwas walking around and I knew this -- I mean, it was -- you could se -- really see the guar\n-- the guards were disappearing. And all at once there was this woman, Drexler. She was\nan SS woman, she had been in Auschwitz and she was sitting in what had been an office,\nlittle place and she was cleaning her gun. And she saw me walking there and she called\nme in. And I figured, \u201cOh, my God. You have come so far and now she\u2019s cleaning her\ngun there and who knows what she has in mind.\u201d And she had told me that -- and she\nsaid -- she said to me, \u201cOh, you know, pretty soon you\u2019ll be free and then you\u2019ll be doing\nwhat -- to us, what we did to you.\u201d And here she\u2019s -- she\u2019s still in power and I said to her,\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t worry, won\u2019t be so bad, they wouldn\u2019t do anything,\u201d and all this kind of thing.\nI wanted to get my -- talk myself out of it and finally she let me go out. This was my --\nmy last experience with the Nazis -- you know, with real Nazis. That was at night and the\nnext morning we were still -- they still made us get up and walk. And we walked and\nwalked. Towards middle afternoon, we came to -- I -- I don\u2019t remember, was it earlier? I\ndon\u2019t know. We came on a -- onto a highway and there were tanks there, without\nswastikas, with five pointed white stars on it. The language was not German. Now, I had\nstudied English, so -- in -- in high school. Of course I wasn\u2019t very good at it at that point,\nI hadn\u2019t spoken it. So -- but, just to hear the English and of course we knew that was it.\nA-Across from where we came out of this clearing and met the highway, there were --\nsetting up, there were rows and rows of Nazis, of SS people. And you know, the SS had\nsome kind of a tattoo under one arm. I think under the left arm, the way they were\nstanding, to identify them. They had done this for their own protection, but now it\nworked against them. So they examined everybody under the arm and they knew who\nwas a Nazi and who was not and then I don\u2019t know what they did with them, we didn\u2019t\nknow any more. But we, from that point on, were able to walk away.",
        "Q: So -- and what happened then, so that you were [indecipherable |",
        "A: Dah -- we stayed in -- we stayed 1n a building. Someone said go here -- go there and\nwe stayed in a building overnight. The building -- and this was near the Elba, where the\nRussians and the Americans and the English and some of the French met. And every few\nhours there was a different army taking care of -- you know, passing through. We went\ninto a building that had been a -- a factory for coffins. Was -- the man who owned it,\nlived in the front. He had a beautiful backyard, with orchard, it was just gorgeous. And\nthere was this factory on the side. And we slept -- some people sl -- we slept on the floor.\nIn the middle of the night -- the Russians had been celebrating --\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "A: -- middle of the night -- the Russians had been celebrating and they were -- really had\n-- really celebrated and they were drunk as anything. So they tried to drive up -- they\nknew there were girls up there. So they tried to drive up the steps on their motorcycles\nand of course, they kept falling back. Then, someone had a horse and he tried to go up\nthe steps on the horse and that didn\u2019t work. So he tied up the horse in the backyard and\nthis horse trampled on this German\u2019s lawn. And that lawn had been so perfect, that I can\nimagine he must have been furious a -- he saw all this -- all this lawn dug up by this\nhorse. But when we woke up in the morning, some of the young women -- it had never\noccurred to me, because I considered myself a child, I didn\u2019t think any soldier would\nwant me -- some of the women had taken some of that black paint that they use for\ncoffins and smeared in on their faces because they didn\u2019t want to be seen. Some had\nactually climbed into a co-coffins while all this noise was going on outside with the\nmotorcycles and the horses and the stuff. Some of the -- so -- but, in the morning we sort\nof dispersed.",
        "Q: Wh-What were your feel -- what were your feelings like that, in those just couple of\ndays? Were you --",
        "A: Oh, it was --",
        "Q: -- elated, or --",
        "A: -- you know, at -- for one minute, I -- I was walking along the sugar factory and I\u2019m\nthinking, now I\u2019m on the outside, on the ball there and I\u2019m standing there and I\u2019m saying,\n\u201cOh, my God, I can do what I want, I can go where I want to go.\u201d I couldn\u2019t, of course,\nbut 1t was a whole, \u201cOh my gosh, this 1s -- this 1s life again.\u201d And it was -- it was a\nwonderful thing. I mean, a -- four -- like a millisecond. It just -- in a little part of a\nsecond, I was thinking, \u201cOh, my God, someone has to tell me what to do, because I\u2019m\ntotally lost here.\u201d This is a whole new experience and, you know, and in -- in Auschwitz\nyou couldn\u2019t do anything without anyone telling you. I mean, if you -- you had to stand\nstraight and they told you to do it and you had to do it. And -- but that didn\u2019t last very\nlong. I mean, I -- I knew then, of course I -- we couldn\u2019t -- we didn\u2019t celebrate. There\nwere people vi -- immediately, in the evening, there was a castle with a big -- or an inn or\nsomething and all the Polish, non-Jewish people went up there, dancing and drinking and\nsinging. And we -- we couldn\u2019t celebrate, we could only still think of all the people we\nhad lost and all the people that were gone and the fires and the burning and the cyanide\nand all this. And there -- there was no way and we knew we wouldn\u2019t find anyone.\nMaybe these other people were hoping when they go back to their houses, there would be\nsomeone there. There would be something that isn\u2019t just -- but for us, everything was\ndestroyed, so there was -- really, it was very -- it wasn\u2019t depressing, but 1t was -- 1t was\nvery somber. We couldn\u2019t think of -- of anything else [inaudible]",
        "Q: Wh-What kind of -- do you remember the kind of discussions that -- that -- that -- that\nyou were having with the -- the people -- with your comrades, about --",
        "A: Not really, I --",
        "Q: -- about the shortage [indecipherable |",
        "A: -- yeah, right, well you see, these were people we didn\u2019t know. There were groups of\nFrench women and we really didn\u2019t have anything to do with the Polish and Ukrainian\nwomen. So, it was my mother and I and something very -- another sort of strange thing\nhappened. She walked in the street and a Russian officer asked her what she wanted. And\nshe speak -- spoke a few words of Russian. And she said she\u2019s hungry. So there was a\nchicken crossing the street, he grabbed the chicken, threw his head -- threw the chicken\u2019s\nhead against the wall, killed it. Gave it to my moth -- handed it to my mother and say,\n\u201cHere, you have your supper.\u201d She came back to this coffin factory, plucked the chicken\nand she made chicken sou -- chicken soup or roast chicken, I forgot what it was, but she\ncooked the chicken for us. But there weren\u2019t all that many people that we shared with or\nanything. And you know, it -- we didn\u2019t make -- we didn\u2019t speak any more about the\nfuture, we were just concerned about what was happening right then and there to -- to\nfind some kind of normalcy. But my mother -- see, I had dr -- hoped that we would still\nfind my father. My mother -- we were -- while we were in Auschwitz in 1943 --\nChristmas of 1943, they had given -- Germany celebrates two ni -- days of Christmas, but\nthe first -- they only celebrated -- they gave us one day off. So most people slept, but my\nbrother had been separated from us already. So we wanted to see if we could find -- see\nhim, just to know that he was alive, but -- and so we went outside and whomever we\nspoke -- and we tried to attract attention with -- in the man\u2019s camp, which was separated\nby a road and he -- we couldn\u2019t get them. But it -- the night before, a woman who had\nbeen smuggled into camp -- had -- no, not -- not smugg -- she was taken into the camp,\nbut she didn\u2019t -- they didn\u2019t tell anyone that she ha -- that she was pregnant and she had\ngiven birth that night to a boy. There were a couple of Christian women, Catholic\nwomen, Polish, in the crowd and they felt, oh, on Christmas eve, a Jewish boy was born,\nunder those terrible conditions, a miracle was going to happen. And they thought the\nmiracle -- they brought in -- they had found a little twig about this tall, of -- of greens\nand they made -- called it a Christmas tree. Did I talk about this at the time, you know?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: All right. So, anyway, my mother dr -- her -- dreamt that he -- my -- that my father\nappeared to her and said to her, \u201cNow, it\u2019s time to say Kaddish.\u201d So my mother was\nconvinced that my fa -- well, of course, given all the c-circumstan -- conditions, she knew\nthat my father wasn\u2019t alive. I didn\u2019t believe this. I knew th -- I thought that he would\nappear somewhere. And I was hoping maybe -- maybe I\u2019d find him in an insane asylum.\nMaybe he was just very sick and we\u2019d have to nurse him back. I mean, I was trying to\nimagine everything that I could, that -- just to find him. And of course, didn\u2019t. Then,\nwhen we were in Frankfort after awhile, my uncle in Israel -- in Israel they got a lot of\nlists of survivors and they tried to find families. My uncle found someone and -- who was\nstill in Europe, with my father\u2019s name. So my uncle got all excited and thought this was\nmy father. And he wrote to us. So this had to be while we were back in Frankfort, though.\nI mean this was going on a long -- and while -- and I -- I -- | expected my father to --\nwhen -- after I read this, I expect my father to walk in any minute.",
        "Q: What was his name?",
        "A: Ithzac Krautvit. What it turned out to be was that this had been a cousin of my\nfather\u2019s. He had changed his name to Ithzac Krautvit, I don\u2019t know, maybe the Krautvit\nname was better known -- what was -- I don\u2019t know what. But he -- whatever it was, his\nfirst name had been Ithzac, like my father\u2019s and he -- he had the last name and you know\nwhat? We -- we had the -- a visa to come to the United States and I was hoping -- I was\nhold -- didn\u2019t let my mother g-go, with some of the -- we went on the last boat that we\ncould possibly go while our visa was still valid, because I didn\u2019t let her go, I thought my\nfather would show up. So --",
        "Q: About how long were you in Frankfort [indecipherable]",
        "A: Well, we were -- in the fall of 1945, when we couldn\u2019t stay in that tent camp any\nmore, they asked us where we could go. And we -- cause we had been in Frankfort, they\nsent us back to -- others were taken to a more permanent, like wooden barrack camps.\nYou know, the -- many of the DP camps in Germany. We were sent to Frankfort. That\nwas in the fall of 1944 -- five.",
        "Q: Excuse me, just so -- so -- how long -- and how long had you been in the tent camps?\nHow long --",
        "A: From the time we were liberated, from April -- May, I\u2019m sorry. Probably May eighth,\nMay 10th, somewhere like that. Until the fall sometime, I don\u2019t kn -- you know.",
        "Q: So it\u2019s probably like fourth -- four or five months?",
        "A: Four or five months, yeah.",
        "Q: And where was that? That was in --",
        "A: That was in a -- it was administered by the British army, so it had to be somewhere in\nnorthern Germany.",
        "Q: So then you -- then you went to Frankfort in the fall?",
        "A: We went to Frankfort, yes. It took a long time, too, because we went by trucks and\nthen we went by broken down trains and -- and you know, nothing was really working\nyet. And we arrived at the bombed out train station and we didn\u2019t\u2019 know where to go,\nbecause you know, they just dropped us there, that was it. And we looked out and the\nbuildings all around were destroyed. So then someone to-told us that a -- an a -- an\nAmerican soldier -- and it might have been this Mr. Klein, who\u2019s married to Gerda Klein,\nbecause he was looking -- this man was looking for relatives in -- from Frankfort. And he\nhad looked throughout Europe, wherever he was -- he was a soldier and he had been in ba\n-- in Italy. And again, someone told him there was a young boy from Frankfort and he\nwas -- thought, well maybe this boy could tell him something. Well, the boy didn\u2019t know,\nbut he told him his history and his name. And when this man now came in Frankfort to\nthe train station, he was again trying to find news about people o-of his family, abou --\npeople who might have known or might know something, what happened to them. And\nwe started talking to him and then he said, \u201cYou know, while I was at Italy, I spoke to a\nlittle boy and -- I mean, a young boy, he s -- he sounds like 1t would be your son,\u201d to my\nmother. And it turned out that he was right and he gave us addresses to write to. Of\ncourse, everything was destroyed and the mail took weeks and weeks and weeks. And my\nbrother had been liberated by the isr -- the Palestinian contingent of the British army --\nyou know, there were volunteers. They were anxious to get him to Israel, because they\nknew there would be a war. He was still a minor, so he -- the British would let him in.\nThey knew he would be -- there would be a war and they had another man to fight. So,\nwhile he was -- he was in Barian, Italy when he wrote to us, but while the mail was going\nup and back, he was already going to Palestine. And we went to Frankfort, so at least we\nknew that he was alive.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And we went to Frankfort sometime in the fall. It was a very gloomy, dark day when\nwe arrived, was terrible.",
        "Q: So you -- so you arrived in Frankfort and -- and --",
        "A: Mm. The first place where we stayed -- I don\u2019t know where -- how we found it or who\ntold us about it. There was a Jewish hospital and parts of it had been bombed and parts of\nit had r-remained, but if you went out too far, you could fall off into the -- into the rubble.\nSo, we were given a room and in bis -- with a hospital bed and that was -- that was it.\nBut, there was some water once in awhile and I don\u2019t know what we did for hot -- for\nheat or whatever, because the -- the a -- the air was coming in throughout, you know? But\nI guess we were so used to suffering that a little more or less cold or whatever, didn\u2019t\nmatter much. Eventually -- because we had been from Frankfort, we were given an\napartment where a Nazi was thrown out. A Nazi family, they had been members of the\nparty. So we stayed in that apartment until we left in the be -- March of -- of -- well,\nFebruary, March of 1946 -- 1947. No, we stayed in that apartment for the whole time.",
        "Q: So -- so, you were there for -- do you want to stop for a second?",
        "A: Yeah, I want to stop for a minute, yeah. Do you want anything else?",
        "Q: No, I\u2019m [break] -- Frankfort for over a year?",
        "A: Yeah. I went back to high school.",
        "Q: Really? During that year?",
        "A: Oh, but it was -- it was terrible, because I had six years of schooling, four years of --\nthe system is different, four years of grammar school and eight years of high school 1s\nhere, but there was eight years of -- wait a minute -- you have four ye -- no, it was the\nreverse from what the United States has. The United States had four years of high school\nand eight years of gra -- of pepperto -- we -- we had four years of high s -- of grammar\nschool and eight years of high school. So, when I went back to -- first of all, my mind\nwas not adjusted. When I went back to the -- to the time there were my a -- for my age\ngroup, they were way ahead of me. And I was not good in math at that point. You know,\nmath is difficult. English I had no problem, languages I had no problem with. Latin,\nanything. But the math and the sciences -- and then, it was very difficult because the\nschools ha -- we-were not really set up prop -- there -- things had been bombed, you\ncouldn\u2019t get books, you couldn\u2019t get paper. There -- the la -- there were no laboratories,\neverything was destroyed. So, it really wasn\u2019t -- 1t really wasn\u2019t school.",
        "Q: Who were the other students that were --",
        "A: They were Ge-Germans. | think I must have been one -- the only one who was -- who\nwas there, but at the time, I made a mistake. Someone told me that in Heidelberg, they\nwere giving classes to Jewish survivors and I should have -- and I said, \u201cOh, my gosh,\nI\u2019m too young. I mean, who would take me into Heidelberg University -- Sucham\nUniversity.\u201d But that was the one where the other people went and they were getting a --\na college education at that point.",
        "Q: S-So -- I mean, it\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- just strikes me at this point as a strange thing, that -- that -\n- that you\u2019d just gotten through this -- out of this whole experience and then you are kind\nof thrust back into this setting of s --",
        "A: And to try to get myself to be normal.",
        "Q: -- well s-- well school and also surrounded by these kids who -- I mean\n[indecipherable |",

        "A: I -- [have no idea and I didn\u2019t care. I mean, I never spoke to anyone. I -- I made no\nfriends with anyone.

        "Q: Were you -- were you angry with them, or --",
        "A: No, I -- I guess not. I -- I don\u2019t know, I was -- you know, I wasn\u2019t even angry any --\nany more. When we came to Frankfort, everything was bombed and I knew there had to\nbe bodies underneath. And yet, I was praying that I shouldn\u2019t see when they dig up --\nwhen they straighten this out, that there would be a body in there, because I don\u2019t know\nhow I would react. I would probably feel pity, but I felt that -- look what they did to us\nand why should I then feel pity when I see the enemy\u2019s body? And yet, I had become\nhuman again and I didn\u2019t want to see this. So, living in -- in Germany, was not -- it\nwasn\u2019t easy in the beginning. So --",
        "Q: Yeah, it seems a strange -- to s -- to return to that -- after that, is --",
        "A: Well, y-you see, this is where my mother suffered and I did -- I did too, but not to the\nsame extent. Of course, I\u2019m still affected by -- by life in Auschwitz. We -- where we\nlived in Fairlawn before, there was a -- had a big backyard on the side, somebody had an\norchard there and we -- when I stood by the fence, that he had a fence put up -- a fence,\nordinary fence, fairly tall. And when I stood there and talked to him through the f --\nwires, I was thinking, \u201cOh my gosh, I\u2019m back in Auschwitz.\u201d When I cleaned my oven\nand | heard the grating -- you know, in my home, it reminded me of when they were\nclearing out the ashes in -- in the ovens in Auschwitz and you could hear that. So, it\ndoesn\u2019t just -- you don\u2019t just forget it, it\u2019s always -- it\u2019s always there.",

        "A: My son -- oldest son, Allen, the rabbi, spoke to a psychologist, he didn\u2019t say it was his\nmother, he just said a congregant. And she said, \u201cWell, this can be easily cured.\u201d It\ndoesn\u2019t -- it\u2019s not my most important problem, so I didn\u2019t, you know, but it\u2019s there, that\u2019s\n-- it\u2019s always there.",
        "Q: Yeah. It\u2019s funny, I -- I have a friend that\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s -- well, it\u2019s a very sad story,\n[indecipherable] she\u2019s -- she\u2019s about my age and her husband was -- they were married\nand -- about a year and her husband was killed in an accident and --",
        "A: Oh.",
        "Q: It\u2019s a very sad story. But -- so I wa -- I was talking to her the other day and you know,\nnow it\u2019s been what? Like six months or so -- but you can -- sin-since he died. But talking\nto her, you can talk about this and that and the things that are going on, but it --\ninevitably, the conversation tone will come around to --",
        "A: Yeah, right. Mm-hm.",
        "Q: -- and you can tell that -- even though she -- it was at work, I saw her at her -- at work,\nat which -- a-and I was in her office a while, we were talking. Well, you could tell she all\n-- even though she would talk about other things and --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- do her things, you could tell that -- that -- there was always going on -- she was\nalways thinking about that somewhere.",
        "A: Yeah.",

        "Q: No?",
        "A: We had not -- no, we did not want to live there. We only wanted -- we had arranged\nwith my father, whoever would live would go back to Frankfort so that we would be a\nfamily again and leave as a family. But there was no way I was going to live there.",
        "Q: So when you were -- so you li -- you were there for a -- a year or so and aft -- at that\npoint, when you left, 1t must have been -- in a sense because you have given up hope of\nhis returning?",
        "A: My mother, yes, I\u2019m -- I mean, I knew that at that point, my father wasn\u2019t ab -- but for\nmy mother it was a very tr -- great trauma. For me, it was -- ta -- sure, I still keep do --\ntalking about my father and -- and -- and feeling about him and -- and -- and great pity\nbecause that he was 47 years old when the Nazis got hi -- and of course a child wants\nboth parents to be there, but I guess I was young, I was able to adjust [indecipherable]\nlooking forward to somethi -- other things, but for my mother, it was -- it was terrible,\nreally terrible.",
        "Q: Well, then it must have been kind of -- I mean, was it -- was it to th -- was it the kind\nof thing where -- where the two of you are hardly -- that she just kind of said, we -- you\nknow, enough, we waited enough, now come down, it\u2019s time move on and --",
        "A: No, she di -- she never felt that way, no, no.",
        "Q: But still, she came to some decision that there was no point to staying or she was tired\nof it --",
        "A: That there was no -- no -- yes, I mean, it was facing the Naz -- ee -- ee -- the Nazi\npopu -- of course, my husband was in the American army and he said when they came --\nwhen they occupied Germany, there was not one Nazi to be found. I mean, this is the --\nthe story you hear from all the soldiers. But we knew that they all were and there was no\nway that we could live in the -- in those surroundings.

        "A: We didn\u2019t associate -- we didn\u2019t associate -- we save a lot of -- there was a DP camp\nin Salzheim, which is outside of Frankfort and we associated with those people. We\nassociated with the Jews who managed to live in a city, rather than stay in a camp, so --\nand --",
        "Q: But you must have passed -- you know, passed you on the street, or you\u2019re in a --",
        "A: Well, we had no --",
        "Q: -- [indecipherable] or --",
        "A: -- yeah, well we had not known or we had absolutely nothing to do with them.",
        "Q: Did they -- did peopl -- did you glare at them or they glare at you, or --",
        "A: No, no, no, just --",
        "Q: Just like --",
        "A: -- yeah, yeah, yeah --",
        "Q: -- just pretended there was --",
        "A: -- yeah. What had happened was that one synagogue was not -- had not been\ndestroyed in 1938 -- it was a Reform synagogue -- because there were houses around and\nthey figured if they burn it, their houses would be affected, so they used it during the war\nas a storage and stalls and whatever. And when -- there were American sold -- Jewish\nsoldiers in Frank -- stationed in Frankfort and came Rosh Hashanah -- the first Rosh\nHashanah, in 1945. They cleaned out the synagogue and they had -- we had services\ntogether. Now here was all this Jewish people and this is a whole different thing. And\nthey brought in wine and cakes and stuff, so it was a nice situation. Those were the --\nthey were groups -- there were some places, and I didn\u2019t go that often. There were other\nJews living in town and there were -- like a cl -- there was a club that you could go to,\nthey showed movies, they showed plays. One time, the habeema came to -- to Salzheim,\nactually, and they invited all the Jews from -- who lived in Frankfort, also to come to\ntheir performance. It\u2019s -- it\u2019s the -- you\u2019re familiar with it? It\u2019s the -- no, it\u2019s an Israeli\ntheater group. What they did -- and this is one of the funny things that happen, again.\nThey came to Salzheim and they trained actors f -- took them out from the DP camp and\ntrained them to be actors. They were giving the story -- the -- the debook. Have you ha --\ndo you know the story -- are you familiar with it? The debook is -- it\u2019s a very solemn play\nand this girl is obsessed with the debook and most of it -- most her obsession takes place\nbackstage and they talk abou -- in -- in this particular production, anyway. And they\ntalked about her being a y-you know, that -- that what\u2019s happening to her. But the -- the --\nthe hoosen, the one that was -- had died and had given up his soul and was now in an -- in\nthe other hoosen\u2019s body, he\u2019s onstage and then finally they bring out this -- the bride and\nit was such a solemn thing. A bride is coming and white dress and you look up and she\nwas about nine months pregnant. And everybody broke up. It was really -- they shouldn\u2019t\nhave let this go through, because such as -- it -- it really ruined the effect. So, this was\none of the th -- but they couldn\u2019t help it, because during this time, while they were\nrehearsing, all this was happening. So -- but this sticks out in my mind, b-but I probably\nwould have forgotten that we went to see the debook, except for this incident. And so, in\nSalzheim and in the cities, they were -- there were enough Jews and sometimes Jewish\nsoldiers, who con -- helped us continue with Jewish life.",
        "Q: And so, tell me about what -- what happened when you -- how -- how did -- how were\nyou helped and who helped you get to America?",
        "A: Well, anyway, where my aunt, who lived in -- my father\u2019s sister lived in United States\nand she -- she had a fr-friend --",
        "Q: Did she come before the war?",
        "A: Oh yes, she ca -- she came, actually -- no, she came after the fi -- right after the first\nWorld War.",
        "Q: Mm.",
        "A: She was o -- much older than my father. And she had -- well, we had relatives in\nBayonne and she had -- th-the friends -- they -- they were friends and one of their sons\nwas stationed in pa -- in Frankfort. And one afternoon in our apartment, bell rang\ndownstairs and I looked down and two soldiers came up and they actually were wearing\nMP bands. And I was kind of a little bit afraid. Beca -- but I couldn\u2019t figure out what we\nhad done. And they turned out to be -- one was the f -- the friend of my aunt\u2019s and then\nhe brought another friend with him. And act -- they -- we became sort of pals. They\nhelped me with my homework and they -- we went to a movie occasionally. And sort of\npalled around. It was nice. W -- Really, very, very nice. So this is the kind of thing we\nwere able to establish with American Jews and there were -- there were enough Jews --\nsome of them originally from Frankfort and some of them from other cities in Germany\nand a lot of them from Poland. But the ones from Poland mo -- stayed mostly in the DP\ncamps. But think the -- as I said, they did give concerts and they did give other things and\nit was nice.",
        "Q: So, y -- y -- at that point, why did you decide to come to the United States\nparticularly? Because you had relatives here, or --",
        "A: Well, n-not really. My -- I don\u2019t know why my father never wanted to go to Israel, but\nmy Uncle Abba left for Israel, he -- he said, \u201cLook, I can take Ruth along or something,\u201d\nand my father wouldn\u2019t -- of course he wouldn\u2019t separate -- but he wouldn\u2019t even think of\n-- it was probably easier to go -- I don\u2019t know why he didn\u2019t -- he wanted to go to the -- if\nhe had to go, he was going to go to the United States. After the war, I wanted to go to\nIsrael. I mean, was Palestine, of course. I keep saying Israel, but it was Palestine at the\ntime. If I had been alone, I would have definitely gone to Israel because I felt there is\nsomething, I had to be with Jews, because of this terrible experience and I felt that we\ndidn\u2019t have -- if there had been a homeland, then all this could have been avoided. And I\nstill do this, I was telling my son Allen that I\u2019m a great admirer of the 12th century Rabbi\nMeyer Fuffenberg, who wanted to go to Israel and I keep think -- and he was a great\nadministrator and I keep thinking, \u201cYou know, this is wonderful. If he had only made it.\u201d\nHe was betrayed by someone in a -- in a -- while he was waiting for a ship to come into\nItaly. And I keep -- kept telling Allen, \u201cYou know, I should write a story of what\nhappened -- that he actually made it there and he set up a Jewish state and everything was\nwonderful.\u201d Of course the crusaders were there at the time, so it couldn\u2019t work, but\nanyway -- so I felt right along that I should go to Is -- but my mother didn\u2019t want to go. I\ndon\u2019t know why. She had -- I could never ask her -- I could never figure it out. And so\nwe came to the United States.",
        "Q: Mm. And what -- what -- what was it like when you came here? What was -- do you\nremember actually arriving and your vision of New York, and --",
        "A: Yeah, well, yes, I -- I must have been pretty stupid, because everybody was talking --\nwe went up on deck of the ship and looked at the Statue of Liberty and I didn\u2019t even\nknow what it meant. So -- but we got into the harbor and we were met by some women.\nWe did not go into Ellis Island, we went into New York harbor, I think. And we were\nmet there by some women. They assigned us to a hotel in -- I guess it was the Hyas or the\nJoint Distribution Committee. They assigned us to a hotel and we stayed there.",
        "Q: What do you -- do -- what do you remember of your first impressions of -- of\nManhattan?",
        "A: Of New York? Manhatt -- it had snowed and in Frankfort when it had snowed, people\nwould never wear galoshes. They would rather get their feet soaking wet than wear\ngaloshes.",
        "Q: Why\u2019?",
        "A: It was just -- it was not cosmopolitan enough, to wear galoshes. And here were all\nthese women with fur coats and wearing galoshes and we thought, \u201cOh my gosh, look\nhow unsophisticated they are. Look how crude.\u201d And well --",
        "Q: What did you think of the -- the city [indecipherable]",
        "A: We were taken -- we were taken on a bus, ta -- and taken to the hotel and I remember\nthere was a building for sale and it said 1,000,000 dollars and I was telling my mother\nthat we s -- I think we should buy it. It was -- well, we, between the two of us, I think we\n-- we really had a lot more money than a lot of other people for -- because there was a lot\nof black market going on and was quite legitimate now. When you tell someone else\nblack market, y-you -- they look at you like you\u2019re a prison -- like a -- a criminal. But\nthere, it was the only way to exist, so it was open. And we had about 300 dollars between\nthe two of us and I was telling her, \u201cSee, this is the building we should buy, 1,000,000\ndollars.\u201d So that much a -- we -- I remember we were put into a hotel and we were given\nscrip to buy food in a kosher deli and stuff, and --",
        "Q: Do you remember where the hotel was, or what 1t was?",
        "A: Yeah, at a h -- it was on Broadway and 103rd Street, only I don\u2019t know the name any\nmore. I -- I could probably -- P\u2019Il probably remember after you leave, but that was where\nit was. And --",
        "Q: Ha -- yeah?",
        "A: My mother -- we saw an ad in the alfbarn, they were looking for a cook. Now, my\nmother had never worked, but she was really like the hostess with the mostest. I mean, it\nwas nothing for her to -- to make -- I -- I -- one time I remember wi -- on sukkas, they --\nwe had a balcony and my father set up a sukka there. This was in 1932 and I just\nremember a little bit and just so -- of course it was too -- too little, but -- but it ran right\ninto our dining room, so the people were sitting there and they went up to the sukka for a\nminute, so they -- they had the Mitzvah of being with a -- in a sukka --\nEnd of Tape Two, Side A\nBeginning Tape Two, Side B",
        "A: -- and, so it was nothing for her to -- to make a meal a -- for 45 people in our -- for\ndinner that night. And it was nothing for her, so she -- this 1s what -- she answered the ad\nand actually, I talked her into it, bec -- and she said she wanted to stay 1n the city,\nbecause there were people -- and you could get ideas of what to do. And I said, \u201cWell,\nthis 1s -- this looks like a job, take it.\u201d And she did. At the same time, I went to high\nschool. But there was -- I -- I couldn\u2019t -- my mother told me not to continue. Cause she\nsaid, \u201cWell, there\u2019s no point to it. What if I have to leave the job? I\u2019m not so happy with\nit and you\u2019ll -- but, and so go to work.\u201d And I wa-wanted to say, \u201cWell, how am I going\nto leave? If I have a job, how am I going to leave?\u201d But I didn\u2019t, you know? I was very\nint -- not intimid -- yeah, right, I ge -- I think intimidated. Nice girls just didn\u2019t question\ntheir parents any -- decisions. And I never -- or maybe it was just me, but I never\nquestioned when she said do this or do that, I never questioned it until sometime later. So\nI was put into training 1n the hospital laboratory and I worked there for about four years.\nA labor -- laboratory technician.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Our boss actually was starting to -- a training program for technicians that would be\nlike registered nurses for nursing, but registered technicians for this. And I was -- I was in\nthis -- the program was cut out again, I guess it didn\u2019t pay, or whatever and I left, you\nknow. But, in the meantime I had been married and --",
        "Q: What -- Yeah, wha -- what were you -- what -- what were you interested in doing?\nWhat did you -- did you have like hopes for what you wanted to [indecipherable]",
        "A: I wanted to go on to college and my mother didn\u2019t let me. And you know, it -- it hurts\nme to this day that she stopped me. But what I think happened was that, they had friends\nwho had been in the same business as my father, but they had -- they were very, very\nwealthy. And when we came here, my mother met them again and they said, \u201cOh, let\nRuth go to a factory and work. Why should she do anything else?\u201d Now, they didn\u2019t do\nthat with their daughter. So my mother felt that, oh she had -- I guess -- I don\u2019t know\nwhat she felt, but I imagine that she felt that she had done enough for me and she didn\u2019t -\n- didn\u2019t want me to go to college.",
        "Q: That seems an odd thing, in a way. I mean, do you know --",
        "A: Yes, I -- yes, it was.",
        "Q: Do you think that was because of her -- the way she was at that point, or the way --",
        "A: It was her -- it was -- yes, I tell you, because if she had said to me, we don\u2019t have\nenough mo -- you know, I would have tried to find -- get some scholarships. But if she\nhad said to me, we don\u2019t have enough money, I would have said, \u201cWell, let me go to\nwork.\u201d Or, I wanted to say -- and it was on the tip of my tongue and I remember that to\nthis day, I wanted to say to her, \u201cWell, if you support me now, once I have my education,\nI will support you.\u201d But I pictured her saying, \u201cWell, what guarantees do I have?\u201d And so\nI didn\u2019t even bring it up. And my mother was at that point very, very difficult to -- to deal\nwith and it was -- 1-1t became a very difficult situation between us and between the\nfamily. Was very -- very, very --",
        "Q: How -- how so? What was -- what was difficult?",

        "Q: What and -- what -- what was sh -- was she -- did she have a temper? Did she -- what\nwas she like that made her difficult?",
        "A: Oh, she would just sulk. Oh, and sometimes she would scream, and sometimes she\nwould -- but, she would sulk. But I think -- and at the time I didn\u2019t realize it, but I -- I\nthink -- I -- I know it was all because of her experience, because the woman who went\ninto Auschwitz was not the same one that was in -- back in Frankfort afterwards. So, it\nwas the easiest solution. She didn\u2019t want me to marry. Then, sh-she didn\u2019t want -- she\ndidn\u2019t like my husband, she didn\u2019t want me to get married and it made me more stubborn\nand I decided to get married and then a few weeks before the wedding, she said to me, \u201cIf\nyou don\u2019t get married, [ll let you go to college.\u201d And I said no. I didn\u2019t want that any\nmore.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And -- I did go to college much later and I do have a Master\u2019s in literature and a\nBachelor\u2019s degree in -- in history.

But I never -- I didn\u2019t take anyth -- because I was working very hard at a -- in\nthe business with my husband and I felt I didn\u2019t want to do anything that would -- well,\nwould -- train for some other work. I\u2019ve worked so much, I\u2019ve had enough. But I wish I\nhad taken something a little more substantial.

So, before the war, he had answered an ad and no one\nwanted to really hire him, because they fig-figured he would leave for the a -- he was\nready for to go to the army. So he answered an ad for someone for temporary work as a\nfurrier. And he did that. When he came back, he was finishing school and under the GI\nbill, he was getting paid for that. So he became the -- an accountant, but when he needed\nit, he worked part time for a furrier. And he felt that this was better, more interesting\nwork than sitting behind a desk. And now, when I speak to my children, they tell me they\nwould never want to sit behind a desk. Two of my sons, anyway. And so my husband\nworked for a furrier, finished school and after he graduated, we got married and he didn\u2019t\nlike his boss, ni -- we were married maybe two years and we started a business.",
        "Q: And a -- so this was in -- around 1950 or so?",
        "A: Well, yes. Let\u2019s see now. Allen was born 1952 and we were married 1948 -- I mean\nthe end of 19 four -- fif -- so, actually 1949, practically. And so we were married with --\nprobably two, three years when he --",
        "Q: Ha-Had your -- did your experiences before that have an im-impact on that\nrelationship in the -- as your early -- in your early married life? Was it -- were you able to\njust kind of leave your experiences behind or did you find for --",
        "A: No, I was really -- well, of course, I mean --",
        "Q: How did that affect your -- your",
        "A: I don\u2019t -- I -- I -- probably I\u2019m not a judge of that. I think by -- my husband would\nhave been able to answer that much better.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, but one of the things that I\u2019ve done and I\u2019m -- oh, I\u2019m still doing it and\nit\u2019s very bad, is that I -- I -- I\u2019m -- can be led. I -- I don\u2019t stand up for myself and I think -\n- and my husband sensed that and he was doing that. But, he wou -- didn\u2019t do it to -- to\nthe bad, so it wasn\u2019t -- you know, it wasn\u2019t a bad -- it was a good marriage, I would say.",
        "Q: And so you started a business?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And then our son Allen was born in 1952, so I think the business might have started in\n1951, and it was successful from the beginning.",
        "Q: And it was a --",
        "A: Yeah, my husband had gone to a school -- under the -- after he graduated, he went to\nschool -- to designing school and he took several courses in designing and for work. And\nit was very successful from the beginning.",
        "Q: So he was a -- it was a -- 1t was a furrier, it was --",

        "Q: Mm-hm. Where was the business?",
        "A: Well, we rented a tiny little place in Patterson. Uptown, not in the downtown area.\nThen we moved to f -- into a rented store in Fairlawn. And two of our sons -- my oldest\nson 1s a rabbi. Two of our sons went -- finished college and they decided they didn\u2019t want\n-- this is really -- it hurts me so much to speak about this. They decided they did not want\nto go to grad school. And we were begging them. They were two and a half years apart\nand my mother talked them into, \u201cOh, your parents have a wonderful business, why don\u2019t\nyou go --\u201d and we didn\u2019t want them no how. We didn\u2019t want this for them. It\u2019s seasonal,\nit\u2019s cyclical, we didn\u2019t want it. And they did.",

        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- they took over the business?",
        "A: Yeah. And we built a building and my -- we were in the building for about a year and\na half and my husband died suddenly. I mean, we knew he was sick, but it wasn\u2019t -- we\ndidn\u2019t expect that, because he really didn\u2019t have any real symptoms.",
        "Q: When was that?",
        "A: That -- when was that?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: 1986. So it\u2019s now 12 years. And the business was very good for a few years and then\nthe fur business was hit by all kinds of things. And three years ago our sons went out of\nbusiness, but in -- Norman, my youngest had a tragedy with a nearly born child and very\nde -- late pregnanc -- stillborn child, almost. I mean, he was like eight months or\nsomething pregnant. And it sent them into a tailspin and they sold everything and they\nwent to Israel. The building, I had a lot of problems with, I couldn\u2019t sell it or the -- well, I\ncould have sold it for half of what -- because the -- the real estate people and -- and all the\npeople that are around, they remind me of the villains in the movies, you know, with the\nwax mustaches and how they\u2019re going to cheat the -- the orphans and the widows and\nthat\u2019s how I felt about it. I was given terrible orders and the -- offers, and the building\u2019s\nbeen empty for three years and my one -- my middle son went into Wall Street, in the\nstock market, he\u2019s doing fairly well, but he\u2019s -- the -- the other day the s -- market was\ndown and everybody called him, \u201cHow come you didn\u2019t tell me to sell?\u201d You know, I\nmean as if he had known and as if he could control it. But -- so this is what -- so he\u2019s --\nhe\u2019s -- he likes it, but 1f he could go into another business, he would probably consider it\nor at least part-time. I tried to sell the -- rent the building to a Russian bakery, Jewish --\nJewish people and we signed a contract and all and they defaulted. They walked out. So\nwhen I said this to my son Norman, he said, \u201cYou know, Mom, why don\u2019t I come back\nand do a bakery?\u201d But not -- he\u2019s not going to be a baker baker, you know, but be a bus --\nhave a business and open several branches and that\u2019s where we are right now. He\u2019s in\nIsrael, he\u2019s try -- we have the financing, he\u2019s trying to set up a bakeshop. And it\u2019s a\nbeautiful, beautiful building and there\u2019s really, probably a need for it and he had good\nideas, which -- quality control and things like that. So \u2019'm keeping my fingers crossed\nit'll work. It\u2019s not what I had wanted for them. Na -- The -- it\u2019s really the reverse of my\nsituation. I wanted to go to college, my mother didn\u2019t let me. We were pushing them to\ncontinue with grad school. Mark had been so wonderful with Russian jury and I thought\nhe would go into international law. Norman tried all kinds of things, he -- they all went to\ngood schools, Brandeis and Washington University in Saint Louis. And NYU and it --\nit\u2019s sh -- it\u2019s -- really hurts me that they didn\u2019t -- and that they -- at this point in their life,\nthey still are thinking of -- of having to -- of changing jobs and -- and whatever.",
        "Q: When did -- when did you go back to school?",
        "A: When did -- I think when my son Allen was in the last year of high school. I felt --\nwell, it was because I saw an ad for a junior college. And they didn\u2019t require any high\nschool papers. But of course, once I started that school, I graduated with almost perfect\nscores. Grade point averages or so -- almost close to four, like 396 in -- in one and 398 or\nwhatever it was -- something like that. And I -- I loved it. I really loved it and I was very\ngrateful that I was able to do it.",
        "Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm. And you went to undergraduate school right away, or --",
        "A: Well, you know, it\u2019s sort of a while, because I was working, so I couldn\u2019t gr-graduate\nin -- I couldn\u2019t get my Bachelor\u2019s degree in four years, da -- probably five or six. And\nthen I -- I couldn\u2019t get my Master\u2019s in, you know, two years like everybody else,\nprobably was three or four and -- because I had to work and then I always tried to make it\nup in the summer courses and they\u2019re terrible, but I guess maybe you know about that\ntoo. And, but I did and that was it. And then, of course, when I went to grad school, my\nmother was sick and it made it very -- very difficult. I was torn in all directions and -- and\nI still managed to get a -- a very good grade point average. I started writing and some of\nmy stories had been published. I haven\u2019t done anything lately because I -- I -- my mind\nwas on oth -- so many other things. And right now, putting dow -- have the first four\npages of my biography written. And everybody\u2019s after me to do -- my sons are after me\nto do it. I lecture a lot on the Holocaust and this was a -- really a saving th -- grace for\nme. I was never be able -- I was never able to speak about it. I didn\u2019t speak to my mother\nabout it. I couldn\u2019t mention my father to her, it was just too painful and I didn\u2019t want to\nawoke anything in her that wo -- that would hurt her.",
        "Q: So you never discussed it [indecipherable]",
        "A: So I ne -- I\u2019ve -- no. I mean, if she mentioned something -- she spoke about the\nHolocaust to my children, I did not. My brother and my mother were able to watch the\nEichmann trial and I -- they were sometimes in my house and watched it and I closed the\ndoor to the den, because I didn\u2019t want to hear it. But then I went to a meeting that wa --\nwe had a very good Y in Bergen County. Actually, it was in Waim, which is Pasay Count\n-- doesn\u2019t matter, but it was [indecipherable] Fairlawn. And I somehow got myself onto\nthat committee. They needed a -- a chairman and somehow -- somehow I was chosen.\nNow, when you are chairman of a committee like this and we had way over a thousand\npeople come to all the -- every year. When -- I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like now. When\nyou\u2019re chairman of this, you -- I mean, you have to listen and you have to write about it\nand that is how I -- it helped me to write, to face it, to -- to -- to speak about it and I th --\nit -- 1t\u2019s done a lot for me, just talking about it, because before that I couldn\u2019t.",
        "Q: Mm. And I understand you went back to -- to -- to Frankfort? It was --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: A -- Ha -- When was that?",
        "A: Well, let\u2019s see, Allen was -- so that had to be like probably 22 or so years ago and at\nthat point --",
        "Q: And you hadn\u2019t been back before?",
        "A: I hadn\u2019t been back. My husband had been to the fairs -- are you too cold because the\nwindow in back is open?",
        "Q: Yeah, maybe I'll [indecipherable]",

        "A: Oh, can you do it yourself?",
        "Q: Sure.",
        "A: Okay. There\u2019s another one, you want me to do that?",
        "Q: No, I can do it. Just reach over.",
        "A: My son Allen had decided to become a rabbi. He went to the University of Rochester\nas a pre-med student, changed his mind and wanted to become a rabbi. So, he had -- he\ntook a year abroad study at the Hebrew University. And then, after he graduated, he\nneeded to -- the theological seminary -- Jewish theological seminary in New York wanted\nhim to take another year. The language, you know. So he stayed in Nevishektar, which\nwas part -- and he took courses at the Hebrew University too, but grad courses. The same\n-- my other two sons did the same thing, as undergraduates. So Norman, my youngest\nson, was the same -- there the same year that Allen was in graduate school. And we -- my\nhusband wanted me to go and see the fur shows in Frankfort. So they were usually in the\nspring and we went first to Israel. We left Mark at home -- our middle son, and we went\nto Israel and -- to be with our two sons and then we took them back to Frankfort, because\nthey had vacation and Mark met us in Frankfort. We all stayed in -- we took two rooms,\nwe all s -- they stayed in -- 1t was wonderful for them, the three of them. They had been\nin different colleges and there they were all together for a week. And then after we -- for\nPesach, we went home, but Mark went with his brothers to Israel. And this -- the three of\nthem stayed in Israel, was very -- was nice for them. But when we were -- came to\nFrankfort -- when we left Israel to go to Frankfort, E] Al was on strike and we had to beg\na Luftansa pilot to get us onto the -- onto the plane, which I loved. Th -- You know,\nreally hated to -- to beg a German. And next to me was a woman -- a Bahai nun. And you\nknow that beautiful temple that the Bahai have in tel -- in Haifa? Well -- and I didn\u2019t ever\nrealize what it was. Actually, they are an offspring of the Muslim faith, but they are --\nthey were persecuted by the Nazis, just like the Jews. And she was telling me her\nexperiences -- of her friends that were killed. And we were flying into Frankfort and I\nwas telling someone the other day, if there had been blood on the tarmac when we\nlanded, I would have said, \u201cSure, I expect that.\u201d So, we went in and we went to the first\nshows -- be -- which was sort of an easy transition then. But of course I was not -- we\ndidn\u2019t go for that at the time. So we went to only the Jewish places. We went to that\nhouse where the little girl was -- lived, who had been sterilized. We went to the house\nwhere I lived. We went to the cemeteries where my grandparents were buried and some\naunts -- baby aunts and things like that. Went to the synagogues, went to the kosher\nrestaurants. And it was -- we didn\u2019t go to the German places. We didn\u2019t go to the\ngerdahouse, we didn\u2019t go to the German muse -- th-the city museum, even though I found\nout later on, they have a great Judaica collection. I was there last -- this past summer -- I\nmean, just a few months ago and I wanted to go in, but they were redoing it and you -- I\ncouldn\u2019t get in. And I wanted to see the Ju-Judaica collection. I didn\u2019t want to see\nGerda\u2019s picture hanging there, you know, and things like that.",
        "Q: Wh-What is your experience when you go back there? What is --",
        "A: Well, what I wanted to do w-when my husband -- my husband retired and he -- in\nJune and then in August he died, end of August. But, we didn\u2019t know that -- of course,\nidea how sick he was. And what I wanted to do was work on a doctorate get myself\ninvolved with a -- a cu -- university here, go over and work on a doctorate on research on\nthe last stages of the community, because I knew all this. But then my husband died. So it",
        "Q: The last stage of the community meaning?",
        "A: In -- in 1943, you know -- ah, well, this is what I had planned. Maybe something --\nonce I would have started the research, I would have gone into a whole different\ndirection.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: I could have gone into Middle Ages or the -- or the -- or medieval ghetto, which was -",
        "Q: So that was your idea?",
        "A: Yeah. So anyway, we -- I -- now I saw the mu -- the Judaica -- I didn\u2019t see the Judaica\ncollection, but I was hoping to. So we -- in many ways -- but I -- but I wouldn\u2019t be able to\n-- | couldn\u2019t have done this on my own. If my husband were alive and w-we would have\nlived there together, I would have been able to study and read -- do research. As I -- as it\nis, when I\u2019m there for -- for a week or so, it\u2019s more than enough. I -- I can\u2019t wait to get\nhome. I went -- I -- I met my cousin there and I -- once, and I stayed for a week. We went\n-- I go to my -- my best friend Irma\u2019s house, where she -- her last home. I don\u2019t have a\ngrave to vis-visit and to me it\u2019s like going to -- to her -- through her grave. And even now\nwhen I was there, I stand in front of the house -- the house has been -- is much more fixed\nup. It was an apartment building or -- or whatever. I don\u2019t know, maybe it\u2019s more like a\ntenement house, it was like a six family house. And it\u2019s like standing in -- in front of a\ntombstone. And I feel that if -- she were to come out, carrying a -- a tray of cookies, I -- I\nalways picture that. With her hair slightly gray and she would call me in and say come in,\nwe got to discuss the grandchildren. But, of course, it doesn\u2019t, but I picture this all the\ntime. So, I stand in front of her house and -- and that\u2019s it. But -- and I go to see the\nbuilding where our school was. I go to the ce -- I go to the cemeteries, but this time I\nwent to Prague and Pilsen. I was in Frankfort only a short time. And everything 1s so sad.\nEverything 1s so terrible and my -- I was 1n Pilsen because my uncle was shot there. I\nthink I told you the beginning of the -- of -- of the interview. And he was -- and it was so\ndepressing, I had -- when I arrived, I thought I would find all kinds of signs that he had\nbeen there, so I told the girl in the hotel that I would stay for two days, maybe three days.\nAnd after one day I had enough and I left. The only problem I had then, when I was\nleaving, while I was waiting for the tax1, I -- there was something that was telling me that\nI hadn\u2019t looked enough, that there\u2019s something there that I hadn\u2019t found and so far I have\nresisted accepting invitations at other ye -- the German government invites people from --\nto their native city back and they go through the age category, you know, the certain age\ngroups. That\u2019s how my cousin ended up in Frankfort and I went to see her at the same\ntime. She\u2019s from Israel. She lives in Israel. So, I have resisted this, but I think next time I\nwould accept and -- but I would want to go back to Pilsen because I -- even if there\u2019s\nnothing there, I want to satisfy myself that there -- that I have done everything.",
        "Q: What -- what -- what would -- what would you -- wh-wh-what might be possible to\nfind there? Wh-What -- what do you think might still be there [indecipherable]",
        "A: Only -- but I -- I did not find the -- the -- the -- they have the burial records from the\nend of the si -- of the time there, when everybody was deported in 1942 -- two and then\nthere\u2019s no one there buried any more until recently. And there are no Jews there now,\nvery few -- very [indecipherable]. So they have a book with the records of the burials and\nI was hoping to find my uncle\u2019s name so I could go to the grave. That was my main\nambition.\nEnd of Tape Two, Side B\nBeginning Tape Three, Side A",
        "A: Oh, oh.",
        "Q: Tell me about -- tell me about the -- I know that you had been at the -- the gathering in\nJerusalem in 1981 of [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yeah, mm-hm, mm-hm.",
        "Q: Could you tell me a little bit about what that experience was like?",
        "A: Well, actually I was writing for some newspapers, so I pushed my nose into every --\neverything there, and said, well, my articles were published in different papers. I have to\nbacktrack then, because there was one experience that I -- I am glad I had in -- in -- ina\nway. When we arrived in Auschwitz, the girls from Selonika had been taken there. Now,\nI had studied, in fi -- in the Filantropine about the Sephardic community and their history,\nsort of. And there they were. And, of course, th -- the -- they were ill fe -- I mean, they\nwere terribly mi -- ill fed and filthy, I mean, just like all the others in Auschwitz and the -\n- the -- the additional problem was that they spoke -- they didn\u2019t speak much -- they\ndidn\u2019t understand Yiddish. Th-Their language was Ladeeno. If -- when they spoke Greek\nand French. They were very, very well educated. The alleance was -- the French schools\nwere teaching them until they were base -- they were multi-lingual and they were\ntalented. Almost everyone -- was -- had a -- was singing and dancing while they still had\ntheir strength, when we first met them. And I made friends with two girls and -- can you\nturn that off for a minute?",
        "Q: Sure. [break] It\u2019s not a -- you know, if you use it --",
        "A: Well, her name was -- let\u2019s say Mona.",
        "Q: But that\u2019s not her real name?",
        "A: That was not her real name [indecipherable] and I don\u2019t want to mention her last name\nbecause family was prominent in -- in Greece.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: So she -- we made friends. She had -- was -- there was a younger sister. Sister was\nabout a year, year and a half younger. And they thought that their mother had remained in\nSelonika. As it turned out, later on when I met the cousin, he told me that she was\ndeported a day after the girls. But, of course, the girls couldn\u2019t know that. And Mona had\nthis beautiful, beautiful singing voice and she told me that she wou -- wanted to be an\nopera singer. One of the things that the Greek girls sang a lot was Ava Maria. As a matter\nof fact, a few years ago, I was in Israel and -- and Yaffal and I heard Ava Maria played,\nso I went in to follow the sound. There was a young man from Greece pla -- and he\u2019s a\npainter. But he was playing -- I don\u2019t know why they happen to love Ava Maria, which is\nso typically, you know, a Christian and a Catholic -- well, at any rate, while she had her\nstrength, she alwa -- we b-begged her to sing for us and she did. And then Auschwitz, of\ncourse took it\u2019s toll, her sister died. And it was like, oh, all the starch was taken out of\nher. The -- the -- but while she was -- while -- while we -- when we first got there, we\nonly spoke in English. That was the way that we were able to communicate. She spoke\nEnglish and -- but in -- the Nazis didn\u2019t permit anyone to speak English, because they\nknew they were bringing in p-people from France and they had to speak French or\nwhatever other language. But they didn\u2019t have any prisoners from English speaking\nplaces, so, of course it was -- they -- if they had caught us, they would have really beaten\nus up or who knows what. So we -- being young kids, that\u2019s what we enjoyed doing,\nwhile we were still -- still had some strength. So she -- her -- her -- but her sister died and\nshe lost all courage. All -- everything, I mean, was gone from her. And, of course,\neverybody got weaker at the time, so that had something to do with it. And then this SS\nman, Talber, heard -- I think I must have talked about this, he heard that she was -- that\nshe had such a wonderful voice and he wanted her to be his housekeeper. Now, the Nazis\ndidn\u2019t encourage sex between the Germans and others. It was -- would dilute the race and\nit would take it -- whatever. So I don\u2019t know what was on his mind once she would have\nbeen in his home. But she refused. And -- remember, you have to realize what a sacrifice\nshe made. I mean, clean sheets, decent food and water and soap. She refused all of this\nand he made sure that she would not live. So he copied down her number and he made\nsure that with the next selection, she would go. And she did. And then -- I always thought\nof her, because she was this wonderful person and we -- she was a fun person while she\nwas still alright. And when I went to -- a few times we had some Christian friends and I\nwent to weddings and I -- they sing Ava Maria at a wedding and I\u2019m sitting there crying\nand everybod -- they\u2019re saying, \u201cLook at this Jewish woman, crying over Ava Maria.\u201d\nBut it wasn\u2019t because of that, 1t was because I was thinking of my friend, Mona. And I\nwent to Israel for the gathering and very few people from Selonika came. And I found\nout later on that they really being slighted by Yad Vashem and by -- it seems that the\npeople who come from eastern Europe, central Europe, think that they\u2019re the only ones\nwho suffered. And that the people from Greece, ah, couple of Greeks, we didn\u2019t get a --\nthey didn\u2019t get along in Auschwitz when they were there. They were fighting, they were\ndifferent cultures, different -- they didn\u2019t speak the languages and they didn\u2019t get along\ntoo well. So they certainly didn\u2019t get along in -- so then, still not getting along now. And\nYad Vashem is not doing very much for them. I think recently they have -- some of their\npublications have written about the Greek people, but not much. So, there were very few,\nas I said, people from Greece. And -- but when -- in the last night, when Me-Menachim\nBegin spoke and we -- at the wall, someone behind me said that he was from Selonika\nand I turned around -- I mean, there were thousands and thousands of people there, or\nwhatever. I think it must have been thousands. And I turned around and I said I had a\ngood friend from Selonika. And he said, \u201cWell, too bad you don\u2019t know the name.\u201d I\nsaid, \u201cBut I do know the name.\u201d I mentioned it to him. And _ he said, \u201cThere\u2019s a large\nfamily living -- by that name, living in Selonika.\u201d But he didn\u2019t have any address and he\nsaid write to wherever and see if a Jewish community someplace will find it for you. So\nwhen I came back, this was first thing on my mind. I called the federation and they were\nin touch with, you know, ev -- there was so much excitement in the air over that event at\nthe time. They were in touch immediately with the -- a group in Athens. There was no\nlisting for the group in Selonika, but the Athens group finally got me the cousin\u2019s name.\nAnd we corresponded. And we met -- when he came, we met about a year or two\nafterwards. My mother was already very sick and she couldn\u2019t come. She would have\nloved to come. I wanted them to come to our house in Fairlawn, they didn\u2019t want to come\nall the way out. I didn\u2019t want to -- they were staying in Long Island someplace, very far\nup, So we met at the Jewish Theological Seminary. And we met and he -- he kept writing\nme -- kept sending me letters and he sent me the book of a mem -- a memora book of --\nin French, of what happened in -- in -- of -- of the Jews in Selonika. And the very -- but,\nyou know, after awhile, there was nothing to write any more and wi -- and you know, we\nsort of drifted apart. I don\u2019t know what became of them ultimately, but it was a\nwonderful experience meeting up with him. And he is married to a cousin and -- this was\nnow another cousin, but the woman -- her eyes were so much like my friends that I -- it\nwas uncanny and I was -- it was very exciting meeting them.",
        "Q: What -- you told me that there was a -- that the -- the meeting -- the gathering a -- in --\nof the survivors in -- that that was -- in Israel, was exciting. That was --",
        "A: Oh, yes, it was really --",
        "Q: Can you tell me -- did you want to stop and get a drink? Do you need some --",
        "A: Yeah, I -- yo-you hear it right? Do you want anything? [break] I think that happened\nin -- at that gathering. You look at my wall here. These are products of Ethiopian Jews.\nAnd it\u2019s very funny, they take Biblical themes, but they\u2019re all African and all their m --\nthe embroidery is made -- 1-is -- they have the dark faces. It is very interesting to me, but\nwhen we were at -- when we arrived in -- in Jerusalem, I think of -- 1n -- 1n tel -- actually\nit was in Tel Aviv the first night. A group of Ethiopian Jews were singing for us. And I\nbecame fascinated. Of course, I\u2019ve heard the story of the king and -- King David and\nBathsheba and -- or the Queen of Sheba, actually. And they are -- they claim to be the\noffspring, so I became fascinated by the story. And I became very interesting -- interested\nin -- in their work and in their fate, so when the -- there\u2019s a new -- New York association\nfor Ethiopian Jews, I started buying these and now they\u2019ve become collector\u2019s items,\nbecause when everybody -- while they were in Ethiopia, they -- fo-for five dollars a\nmonth, they were -- would embroider and the five dollars a month they could buy and\nfeed themselves. Now, most of them have left, so they don\u2019t do this any more. And in\nIsrael, five dollars a month doesn\u2019t exactly get you somewhere. So they have given up\ndoing this kind of work, but what happened then was, I came back, I kept buying these\nthings and all this is Ethiopian. I have Rosh Hashanah cards and they\u2019re very -- they\u2019re\nvery charming.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: I love this one with Jonah and the -- and the whale.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And this is Moses. This is King David. This is Mirriam. And this is the one -- the\nerotic one. Adam and Eve in the -- in the Garden of Eden. This was the first one, it\u2019s a\nShabbas clock. And I became involved because we had -- my father\u2019s name is mentio --\nis listed -- my sister-in-law, there was a memorial building of some sort. I haven\u2019t seen it,\nbecause I don\u2019t go to Florida. In Florida, she thought I -- I needed something nice. She --\nthat -- I had some -- done something nice for her, so she mentioned my father\u2019s name --\nhad his name listed in the memorial in Florida. Is -- It\u2019s in Yad Vashem and it\u2019s in the\ndifferent museums and everywhere. And our synagogue, when I lived in Fairlawn, again\nmade up a plaque, with the names of the Jews who sa -- didn\u2019t survive. So -- relatives.\nAnd I was sitting with a friend in the synagogue and I said, \u201cI really don\u2019t want this\nagain.\u201d It\u2019s a-another wall and another stone and another memorial. How many should\nthere be? And she said, \u201cYou know, but I know you\u2019ll have to do it and you\u2019ll do it\nanyway, because you\u2019ve been a member of the synagogue for so many years.\u201d And I did,\nshe was right. So, when I went up to the table, I said, \u201cI\u2019m not sure if I should call it Isaac\nor Ithzak.\u201d And someone in back of me said, \u201cWell then, call him Irving.\u201d And I said,\n\u201cWell, how -- wha -- how does Irving get to my father?\u201d And I don\u2019t even remember\nwhat I put down, if it was Isaac or Ithzak. And I said, \u201cNow that\u2019s it. They can approach\nme all they want, I have to do something living -- for the living.\u201d And the only way I can\nhonor my father is by real, living things. So I -- for a year -- two years, I adopted a -- an\nEthiopian girl. She was a -- she was a maid. But I enabled her to go to dental school. She\ndidn\u2019t become a dentist, but she became a dental hygienist and it\u2019s much better than\nscrubbing floors, I guess. And I\u2019m still involved with Ethiopians. The only thing was\nthen, someone approached me and I became -- and I went on to became a -- a member of\nthe Board of Overseers for the Rabbinic school for the Jewish Theological Seminary.\nTook all my energy and money, so I gave up a little bit on Ethiopians. Personally, I think\nthat it\u2019s probably equally important to support the Ethiopians, even when there\u2019s already\nin Israel. So that\u2019s why I have all these Ethiopian things hanging there.",
        "Q: I was curious about when you came to the United States, how did the other Jews who\nwere here -- how did the American Jews react to you?",
        "A: Oh well, I had relatives and they didn\u2019t believe what we -- our experiences, so after a\nfew attempts to explain it, we didn\u2019t tell them any more. And what they wanted was --\nwhat they thought we should be was like servants to them. I mean, tha-that\u2019s -- was the\nthing, you know, I mean we were definitely inferior.",
        "Q: Because\u201d?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, because Europe had a bad reputation over there -- everybody thought\nEurope 1s still the shtatel from -- and we came out of the shtatel from the 19 -- 1800\u2019s or\nsomething like that. And that\u2019s why we should -- that was my experience, though there\nmust have been other experiences that were much better. Mine was not -- and even --\neven my mother-in-law felt this way. And my -- there was someone -- we were look --\nwhen we were looking for a house, there was someo -- a house in Elmwood Park that was\nan old house, very crummy. And we were looking for houses, this was not what we were\nlooking for. But this old -- my mother-in-law\u2019s friend sent us over and just out of\ncourtesy we went and we came back and we said, \u201cWe don\u2019t want it.\u201d So, it was, Ruth\ndoesn\u2019t want it. It wasn\u2019t just that Harry doesn\u2019t want it, but Ruth doesn\u2019t want it. And\nwhen we -- when I said this, the woman said, \u201cOh, in Europe it was better?\u201d In other\nwords, I was very ungrateful that I didn\u2019t grab, you know, this old house there. And this\nis always -- I mean, 1n Europe, because most people don\u2019t have the experience of the\nJews living in Germany, which was what they th-think of is Annatefka. And, you know,\nthey -- they -- \u201cFiddler on the Roof\u201d type of village where -- with the chickens running\nand the ducks in the street and all -- and the mud in the road and they think that\u2019s what it\nhad to be. And one of the other things that I always heard was that all Jews in Germany\nwere -- they were not Jewish any more. And this was always cu -- this was -- it -- it hurt\nme because I just told you how -- that the cities -- everybody was kosher, everybody kept\nShabbas. That was in my town, it might have been different in -- in other towns. But this\n-- these -- these criticisms came from people who doing everything on Shabbas, who\nnever -- who didn\u2019t care if they eat -- ate kosher or not, didn\u2019t teach their children\nanything Jewish, but they were able to criticize Jews from Germany. So 1-it was -- it was\nvery difficult. It wasn\u2019t -- 1t wa -- it was not too great an experience. I mean, yes, there\nwere p-people who were very kind and there was -- when I worked in the hospital there\nwas one doctor, very well known dermatologist who wanted to take off my number and I\ndidn\u2019t want to. I mean, he was going to do it for nothing and I didn\u2019t wa --",
        "Q: Wh-Why didn\u2019t you want to?",
        "A: It was a real part of me and I had nothing to be ashamed of. I didn\u2019t -- I didn\u2019t commit\na crime to get this done and I just didn\u2019t want to have it. Now, because sometimes I -- I\nput some makeup over it to -- to tone it down, because you -- if I -- in the summer, if I go\nto the supermarket -- and everybody knows now, everybody has watched the movies and\nthey just -- th-they start pointing me out and I don\u2019t -- you know, I don\u2019t want to talk to\neverybody about this. And at first, years ago, no one knew what it was. They thought it\nwas telephone number or something and then it wasn\u2019t [indecipherable]. So now I -- I try\n-- sometimes cover it, sometimes I don\u2019t, it doesn\u2019t matter.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: But my aunt in -- my mother has a younger sister and she\u2019s quite old and quite ill now,\nbut when I was there the last time, she said, \u201cHow come you didn\u2019t have your number\ntaken off?\u201d Seems to -- in Toronto, the stylish thing 1s to do this and I don\u2019t know if I\nwould want to. It -- 1t hasn\u2019t bothered me.",

        "A: Yeah, mm-hm, mm-hm.",
        "Q: -- [indecipherable]. Is that still the case? Is it still --",
        "A: Yes. I think it\u2019s th-the movie \u201cShoah\u2019\u2019, that goes on every so often and the people -- in\nthe beginning they\u2019re sitting in the garden and I\u2019m -- I tell myself, \u201cOh, you got to watch\nthis.\u201d And I sit there for a few minutes, I see them having fun at the picnic and I want to\nscream, \u201cGet up, get -- run away, because you know what\u2019s -- I know what\u2019s going to\nhappen to you.\u201d",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And I turn it off, I don\u2019t watch it. I mean, the visual is very, very difficult for -- books\nI can read.",
        "Q: Mm-hm, [indecipherable] so you read books. Have you been to the -- like the\nmuseum, the Holocaust Museum in Washington, or --",
        "A: Yeah, of course, I -- because I had given them the belt -- I -- I don\u2019t know if you know\nall that. I had given them a belt that when I came to Auschwitz -- when, after we were\nshaved and -- and everything, they handed me a skirt that was way too big and someone\ngave me a blue felt belt with flowers on it and I used it t-to hold the bel -- the skirt up and\nthe belt -- I -- I kept losing weight, of course, wh-when we were there. And my mother\nkept saying, \u201cOh, poor Ruth, look at this, oh.\u201d Then I kept telling here, \u201cYou know, it\u2019s\nnot that I\u2019m losing weight. It\u2019s the belt that\u2019s stretching. That\u2019s why it\u2019s -- it looks loose.\u201d\nSo, I rolled -- 1t was made of felt and I was able to roll 1t up and 1t went with me wherever\nI went. I took 1t with me when we ca-came to the United States. And then I -- w-we -- I\nwas moving at the same time that the ha -- museum was looking for things. I -- and I felt,\nwell, if someone is going to go through my estate and find this belt, they\u2019re going to say,\n\u201cThis woman was crazy. Look at what they -- she kept there, this dirty blue thing, with a\nthread hanging where the button was and a cr -- and a rusty safety pin and the button hole\nis torn. What the heck did she keep this thing for?\u201d So I\u2019m explaining it, I sent it to the\nmuseum. So, because of that -- I guess because of that and I ha-had promised them I\nwould give them m-my story, I went to -- I was invited to the opening and my daughter-\nin-law and two of her children are in their four -- they have four children, but two of her\nchildren went to -- the other two were too small, we went to the opening. And my\ngrandchildren are very, very affected, much too much. Especially those -- they\u2019re --\nthey\u2019re -- my son Allen -- my son the rabbi\u2019s children, they are very involved with the\nHolocaust and I -- I sometimes tell them, \u201cY-You have to do other things. You have to\nchannel your mind into different directions, not just Holocaust.\u201d But they always come\nback to this. And --",
        "Q: Yeah, what is your feeling about that? Do you -- I mean, what would you -- how\nwould you like th-that -- the -- how would you like that that generation --",
        "A: Well, of course --",
        "Q: [indecipherable] relate the experiences that you had [indecipherable]",
        "A: -- of course they want to -- they should relate to it, but that isn\u2019t their -- their only\nthing, they -- I -- I mean, they\u2019re getting out of it now. The girls are growing to the point\nwhere they see -- know boys and you know, they realize th-there\u2019s boys and stuff. But --\nit really -- I mean, I was hollering at my son, because I -- I didn\u2019t want them to just think\nof this -- this morose subject all the time. But I -- I -- it\u2019s -- it\u2019s good -- all my\ngrandchildren -- I mean, my youngest son\u2019s daughter, Sheera 1s -- lived in Israel, so I\nguess -- and she was -- went to Solomon Sheckter schools right along. So she is very\naware of the Holocaust, but even my two children who go to public schools, here in West\nOrange, my two grandchildren are now aware of it and of course it -- they need to be\naware of it. My son 1s very angry because he feels he doesn\u2019t have an extended family.\nThey have one cousin in -- in Toronto, but there were many cousins and -- and aunts that\n[ -- that were killed. So, my son always says, \u201cI should sue the Germans because they\nkilled all my relatives and I have no one.\u201d So -- but no, I\u2019m -- I\u2019m grateful that they want\nto know it. I\u2019m -- I think it -- even my point in -- in lecturing 1s that -- to prevent this kind\nof thing. Not just pr -- to prevent it for -- for Jews. Of course it\u2019s primarily -- the\nHolocaust was against the Jews and my main interest 1s that it -- nothing should happen\nto Jews, but it\u2019s very easy to glide into a situation, be seduced by some crazy person like\nHitler again, for another people. And they too should know what can happen.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",

        "Q: Did -- did -- did you find -- do you find that that\u2019s -- has -- has it changed the way you\nrespond, do you think, to other political events? I mean, I don\u2019t know if you are an active\n-- | mean like -- even things like, you know, the Vietnam War years or, you know, the\nCivil Rights movement or those kind of things.",
        "A: Well, it is -- I was not again -- I didn\u2019t go demonstrating against the Civil War -- a-\nagainst the Civil War, yeah, against the Vietnam War. I think -- I -- when we left\nGermany, we were sure that Russia was going to attack the world. We didn\u2019t realize how\ndevastated Russia was, but to us 1t seemed like they were threatening the whole world. So\nwherever there was Communism, we were sure that we wanted t-to -- that I wanted it not\nto exist, because I didn\u2019t, whe -- it was Stalinism, it wasn\u2019t the 19th century Socialism.\nSo, this kind of terrible behavior. I -- I -- I mean the things that went on against people of\nall kinds, in Russia, we -- we wanted Communism to -- so, when -- I was not against\nstopping -- I mean, not for stopping the Civil War -- the -- oh, I\u2019m keeps going -- the\nVietnam War. I read something about Civil War last night, I guess it\u2019s still on my mind.\nAnd so that was -- but the Civil Rights movement is another -- was another thing. I didn\u2019t\ngo -- I was too busy, with -- children were small. I was working, but of course, that we\nsupported. I s -- had once sent money to the movement, Martin Luther King\u2019s movement,\nshortly before he was killed. And -- I -- I mean, [indecipherable] for this, I mean. I --\nwhen we were in Frankfort yet, before we -- in -- in 1946 and I had the -- those two pals,\nthe two soldiers that came to see us and they told me that black people were not exp --\nyou know, they were not treated the same as others. And I couldn\u2019t understand it, I asked\nthem, I said -- to me they seemed exotic, because the first people -- black people I saw\nwere American soldiers and I thought that was -- oh, this is so wonderful, to have these\nnice, black people. And they told me this and I couldn\u2019t understand that. Why would\nanyone not treat another human being the same way as they wanted to be treated, but\napparently that\u2019s what it was. So I was very upset over that, I was very affected. But I\nwasn\u2019t in -- aware of anyone, who was being mistreated, though we had once a patient in\nthe hospital and I think he became a well known -- what do they, the black -- oh, they had\nq --",

Why can\u2019t\nyou make a peaceable revolution?\u201d And he said it wouldn\u2019t work. So I really didn\u2019t have\nmuch to do with him anyway. I -- I didn\u2019t agree with that either.

        "A: Yeah, and for some reason, I think it started out with my not wanting to hurt her -- t-to\nbring everything up. So, I pushed everything away from it and I -- maybe she thought I\nwas peculiar, that I never spoke about it. I -- I never mentioned my father. I mean, barely\nmentioned my father. Do you know that Allen gradu -- my son Allen graduated from the\nseminary and we made a party at the Jewish center in Fairlawn, where we lived. Made a -\n- the rabbi made a sort of party. I instigated it. But the rabbi came up to my mother and\nsaid, \u201cYou must be very proud of your gra\u201d -- you know, what -- what else can you say?\n\u201cYou must be very proud of your grandson.\u201d So my mother pulled herself up and she\nsaid, \u201cOus countan funia risha.\u201d It comes to him from his inheritance. So I said to her,\n\u201cWhy did you say this to him?\u201d And she said, \u201cWell, you know your father\u2019s family.\u201d\nAnd I don\u2019t know anything about my fa-father\u2019s family. And she\u2019s gone now and now\nI\u2019m first going to look into this genealogical situ -- thing -- and I know about my father\u2019s\nfamily only very, very little. What happened was that -- I told you my -- my grandfather\ngot a miz -- a megillah that was written by the Sofas for a gift for him. My father showed\nit to me and he explained that the name -- they were writers, schribers in the ghetto, when\n-- and they -- in Hebrew, it\u2019s Sofa, so the family named itself Sofa after that and they\u2019re -\n- that\u2019s the family. But that\u2019s as much as I know. If I had been able to speak to my\nmother, maybe she would have been able to fill me in on some of these things. But I just\ncouldn\u2019t get -- there was like this wall. And I couldn\u2019t -- I didn\u2019t want -- I -- I -- my main\nmotivation was that I didn\u2019t want her to hur -- be hurt and I didn\u2019t want her to start crying\nand I think that\u2019s why I s -- never brought it up.",

I wen -- I\u2019m a -- I\u2019m always talking about my father an-and I miss him\nterribly. And I miss not having ha -- had him. But what I really missed, I was thinking of\nin college, because when I took all these philosophers, I couldn\u2019t tell Plato and Socrates\nand -- and Aristotle apart.

I\u2019m hoping to somehow pick this up, maybe one of these\nyears, if I live, to get a Ph.D. in Jewish history, because I love that aspect.

And it -- I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s the right approach, but that\u2019s what\nI\u2019m doing.

I want to write\nabout -- I just wondered -- what I\u2019m really showing is that there was a lot of anti-\nSemitism from the beginning. Goldhagen\u2019s ideas. But also -- and Jewish historians have\nneglected to do this for a long time, 1s that everybody made a bridge from one destruction\n-- from one burning, from the -- you know, they -- there were the laws against Jews and\nthen there was the Inquisition and then there was a -- before that was the Black Death and\n-- and then the Inquisition and -- and then and -- and other things in between and you had\nthe Nazis. And no one really, seriously, for a long time -- and the Hebrew teachers did\nthis -- mentioned all the wonderful th -- things that Jews did on their own. The\nscholarship and the Jewish organizations. I mean the -- this is not something from now,\nthis is something from -- from out of need, that happened in medieval times, even before.\nAnd so I want to bring this -- I want to sh -- bring some of that in, but only in a few\nsentences, because, as I said, I\u2019m not writing a history of -- of J-Jews, I\u2019m writing a -- my\n-- my biography.",

        "A: Mm. I think you couldn\u2019t -- you couldn\u2019t grow up or live in the city of Frankfort, in\nGermany, without being touched by religion. There were -- of course the city had\nundergone all these movements of -- when the reform movement started, they went to\nthat one extreme and then they went to an -- the other extreme and throughout reform\nmovement and -- but generally, a-around 1850 or so, Rabbi Samson Raffelhirsch be --\ncame to Frankfort. He was Orthodox and there was an -- a t-tone of Orthodoxy all\nthroughout the city. The stores were -- Jewish stores were closed on Shabbas, except for\ntwo department stores that were owned by Jews, but they -- they -- they were open. And\nmost people kept kosher. My school was not the real -- Samson Raffelhirsch religious\nschool, it was a school that had been opened in 1804 by a secretary of one of the\nRothchild\u2019s. They had seen to a Yeshiva Baharim and walking around and they f -- and\nRothchild felt they should have a -- a secular -- or any kind of education. So he\ncommissioned his secretary to start a school for -- for them and out of this grew a school\nthat was called Filantropine, which was -- because of it\u2019s beginning was -- had the -- had\na philanthropic connotation, but by the time when my brother and I went, my father was\njoking that it cost him as much for our education as a -- what a German workman would\nearn per month. Well, not quite, but, you know, something like that. So this school really\n-- also [indecipherable] Samson Raffelhirsch school, they were always Orthodox and\nthere was no question about it. This school, when -- when -- it had started experimenting\nwith Sunday schooling and with Saturday schooling. They didn\u2019t write on Shabbat, but\nthey ha -- they had school on Shabbat. And then they gave that up again. By the time we\nwent -- this went on through the century. By the time we went to school, it was fairly --\nwell, the people who went were -- who went there were -- not the very Orthodox. So my\nparents kept kosher and we kept Shabbat, we kept Eviomtop, but we didn\u2019t -- it wasn\u2019t as\nthe other school. Now, but I remember we were 43 children in the beginning and I -- I\ndon\u2019t know -- I think one confessed that she didn\u2019t -- that that family didn\u2019t keep kosher,\nand everybody else did. So, if -- if that answers your question -- I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s\nenough. I mean we -- my parents belonged to a synagogue that was burned down in 1938\nin the Kristallnacht, that would be considered, probably Conservative by today\u2019s\nstandards, even though it was different. There was still the mareetzah, with women\nupstairs and men downstairs and other things, but it -- but it -- and it didn\u2019t have a -- an\norgan like the Reform synagogue -- that one Reform synagogue that\u2019s still standing in\nFrankfort now, but it -- it was a little less str-strict than the Samson Rafellhirsch\u2019s sh --\nsynagogue.",

Sometimes I wish they would have looked more to the outside and would have\nwanted to leave and -- you know, and argue, I don\u2019t want to be here any more. One of\nthem should have said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to be here any more and let\u2019s get out.\u201d But they\ndidn\u2019t and I can\u2019t -- I\u2019m still trying to puzzle this out.

Look at him in the -- 1n the\nnewsreels, pounding the table and screaming away at --\u201d I mean, this has to end -- this\ncan\u2019t keep going. Of course, it ended, but 12 years too late. So one of the things I f -- my\nfather -- I felt my -- with my father, was j -- he -- my famil -- my father\u2019s family\noriginated in the medieval Frankfort ghetto. And then, when all these things with the\nReform and the Orthodox happened, the fa -- this branch of the family got tired of it and\nthey moved to Bratislava and they became well known rabbis, the Sofa family. As a\nmatter of fact, we had a megillah that was given -- made by the Sofas to -- for my\ngrandfather\u2019s wedding. And it was given to him as a gift, my grandfather had it with him,\nmy father had it. When my uncle went to Israel, my Uncle Abba, in 1936, he wanted to\ntake it with him and my father said, \u201cNo, it\u2019s got to stay with the oldest brother.\u201d And of\ncourse it was destroyed. Otherwise that beautiful thing would have been now in Israel or\nperhaps with me or in a museum or somewhere. So, my parent -- my father reali -- my\nfather kept his Czechoslovak passport, because for business, when he traveled, the\nCzechoslovak passport was accepted everywhere. Czechoslovakia was at the time the\nonly republic in Europe. They were highly respected and their passport was accepted\neverywhere and he relied on that to be able to get us out of Germany, which ultimately\ndidn\u2019t work. But -- so he, in traveling, h-he was comfortable thinking that, well, he hears\nfrom everybody that the Nazis would stop -- of course later on the -- this -- he couldn\u2019t\ngo any more. This was just in the very beginning. But he heard that well, the Nazis, I\nmean, who\u2019d look at this nonsense, this is going to stop soon. And I think that\u2019s why they\nsat. And people started going to S-South America and they wrote back such terrible\nreports. They couldn\u2019t wait to get back again and things like that, so I guess they didn\u2019t\nwant to subject us to this.",
        "A: Yeah, well -- what then -- in -- when Czechoslovakia was invaded, in 1938, I think it\nwas, we -- my parents sold everything in a hurry. My father relied on his passport and we\nmade our way to the French border. The borders were closed, they wouldn\u2019t let us in. We\nhad to sleep in a farmhouse overnight and then the next day we went back to Frankfort.\nI\u2019ve heard of people who followed that same route, but they were adults and they swam\nacross the river -- a river -- illegally and made their way into France. Now, my parents\ncouldn\u2019t have done this in [phone ringing] Sorry. What\u2019s the next question?",
        "A: Oh, I was --",
        "A: I was very sh -- I think I was very shy. My -- I have one friend that went to school\nwith me. His -- he survived because his mother was not Jewish, his father was Jewish and\nthey sent him -- they didn\u2019t send him to an extermination camp, though if the war would\nhave lasted a little bit longer, they probably would have, too, but he was survived in\nTheresienstadt. And he remembers me as being very shy and laid back. But what I\nremember was that I was not happy in school. I was the youngest, I was the smallest and\nI just -- I was just not happy. Even though this was a wonderful school and I mean, I\nremember the -- the little bit of Greek that we learned and the Latin that -- this was an\noutstanding school and it was the best school in -- in Europe, I think. And whatever math\nI would know, I remember from -- from the Filantropine. But -- so, that was me, what -- I\nwas shy, I was always afraid. And I -- I think I still am. I don\u2019t make waves, I don\u2019t raise\nissues, which 1s really not good. What can I tell you? This is what happened to me. That\u2019s\nwhat you --",
        "A: Oh, I read. I read a lot. Well, especially after my uncle -- my Uncle Abba went to\nIsrael, he left behind -- and so, I was six or seven years old and I was reading Ibsen and\nCheckov. And when I did this in college, I read it -- I ran into it, I said, \u201cGee, sure, this 1s\nwhat I read when I was a child.\u201d Didn\u2019t quite -- but what I was reading, you know, for\ninstance, Checkov -- Ibsen\u2019s \u201cGhost,\u201d I ha -- my father had to explain to my what\nsyphilis was. So, you know, you see -- a seven year old shouldn\u2019t be inter -- shouldn\u2019t be\nreading these things, but I did. So that was me.",
        "A: Oh, oh, a definite ow, I mean h-how could it not have?",
        "A: We were -- we had a Nazi living in -- downstairs from us in an apartment and we were\nchildren, we fid -- after school if we\u2019d run up the stairs, he would complain that we ran. If\na chair was moved upstair -- you know, he could hear it downstairs, so he\u2019d take a --\nwhatever it was, a broom or something and hit the ceiling because we were making too\nmuch noise. It was a real -- you know, so it -- it was awful. And Sunday mornings, there\nwere always these lectures on -- the speeches by Hitler. You went outside, everything\nwas quiet. The church bells -- bells were going on one side and Hitler\u2019s voice was\ncoming from every radi -- everybody wanted to show how good a Nazi he was, so they\nturned on the radios, you know, loud, so everybody could sh -- hear, and then what -- for\nwhatever -- I guess that was the reason. And, so you could hear him talking from one end\nto another and it is scary. Of course, to me, just the voice was scary, the contents I didn\u2019t\nunderstand, but the voice and -- and this whole ambiance was scary. We couldn\u2019t go\nswimming any more, because we were told there were at-attempts at drowning. We had\ngone swimming in a public park, in a pond. Whe -- a -- all Jewish people, unless they\nwent on vacation, in a -- but the ones who stayed in the city for any time went swimming\nthere. Then the public -- there were public baths and you couldn\u2019t go swimming there in -\n- th-they were closed to Jews, but the other you co -- in the park, for instance, you\ncouldn\u2019t go because there were attempts of drownings, so of course we didn\u2019t go any\nmore. And people moved from the small towns -- Jews moved from the small towns to p\n-- fi -- to Frankfort because they felt a little bit safer in the -- in a crowd. So people came\nan -- into the school -- new students came in. Other students left for wherever they were\ngoing. It was -- and the same thing with teachers. So, they were always coming and going\nand it was -- it was not a very settled situation. However, as I said I was reading and I --\nwe tried to -- I guess our parents tried as to live as normal a life, but I guess I didn\u2019t know\nany different, because I grew up with all that, so I just went along.",
        "A: Oh, I -- I -- I -- the real --",
        "A: -- yes, well -- you know when I was, oh, probably about four or five years old, my\nparents were walking with us in the park and some SS -- no, I mean a -- a Hitler youth\nboy on a bicycle ran into me and drove over my leg and my parents couldn\u2019t complain. If\nthey\u2019d go to the police station, they -- my parents would be arrested or who knows what\nthey would do to us? So you couldn\u2019t because you know, we -- my husband and my --\nour sons, went back to Frankfort probably about 20 years ago. I didn\u2019t want to go, but my\nhusband had business there and he said, \u201cOh we should go to the Jewish places,\u201d and\nthat\u2019s what -- actually what we did. So we went to the -- a -- from where we lived, just --\nwas about a long block to the school, block and a half. And on the way was -- one of the\nhouses that had not been damaged, or had been repaired, it wasn\u2019t pulled down\ncompletely. And I recognized it and I told them a story. There was a little girl, who went\nto school with my brother. Because they were walking home on the same way and he --\nhe just had a few more houses to -- further to go, we -- I started teasing him that this was\nhis girlfriend and he didn\u2019t like it, but whatever. The father had suddenly done something\nthat the Nazis didn\u2019t like. They didn\u2019t punish him, but they took this little girl and they\nhad her sterilized and returned to the parents. And when you hear these things -- I mean,\nmy -- I -- my parents, you know, it was very difficult, they didn\u2019t say anything, because\nyou didn\u2019t want to tell children so much. Number one, they would be very frightened, but\nnumber two, if they talked, it was dangerous. So it was best if children knew as little as\npossible. But this particular incident, I guess the -- we were talking about all the ti -- they\nwere tal -- not all the time, but they were talking about it, because it just couldn\u2019t be\nhidden. So, can you imagine how this poor father felt, that they did this to his daughter?\nIt\u2019s a little girl, I mean just maybe nine years old. I didn\u2019t even know -- I don\u2019t even\nknow if they -- what they could have done to -- but whatever it was, that 1s -- that\u2019s what\nwe heard. So you had this kind of fear all the time that you couldn\u2019t talk, you couldn\u2019t be\nloud. You couldn\u2019t be -- God forbid, obnoxious in the street or something, you know,\nbecause people -- there was always a Nazi waiting in -- in someplace waiting for you,\nyou know?",
        "A: Ah, yes I guess y-you do. What I\u2019m -- what I\u2019d -- the people I admired were my\ndoctor, so I figured I should be a doctor. But that was -- I didn\u2019t have any other plans,\nother than that. But I -- it was only -- it was all in the framework of remaining in the city.\nI never dreamt of anything like Auschwitz of -- obviously not. So, after that, I didn\u2019t have\n-- during that time I didn\u2019t have that kind of -- those kind of plans. I mean, survival was\nwhat was important, you know.",
        "A: And no -- not the plan to go do things, you know.",
        "A: A-Actually not.",
        "A: Yeah, well, you know, I was always convinced that it had to come to an end. I mean, I\n-- | didn\u2019t -- when I was in Auschwitz, of course, I didn\u2019t know if I would survive it, but I\nalways knew that this has to end. I was like -- 1t was -- is what imprinted in me that it\nwould -- it would come to an end and then everything would be all right and of course\npeople said it, but while you\u2019re going through, it looks like it\u2019s never going to end, but\njust somehow you -- I knew it would -- would be -- come to an end.",

But that was one thing, but there was another\nthi -- instinct in me that said, \u201cThis is going to have to end.\u201d Whether I survived it or n --\nonce I got to Auschwitz, whether I survived it or not was, of course, questionable. And\nvery often, i-it was such a struggle to be in Auschwitz, that I -- I didn\u2019t want to live -- that\nI didn\u2019t want to survive, because I figured I\u2019m going to die anyway, so what is so -- I\nmight as well not struggle, and die now. And you know, that\u2019s how -- but on another\nlevel, an inner level, a lo -- I don\u2019t know, I felt that this 1 -- of course this has to end.",
        "A: Oh, well --",
        "A: We -- as -- I told you we -- my father had Czechoslovak citizenship. Our friends from\nschool, most of the friends were sent away in 1942. I don\u2019t know how they died, either on\na -- on a truck, where they put the gas in or on a -- in a railroad car, where they put -- put\nthe gas in and so but we went -- because my father was a Czechoslovak and then Slovak\ncitizen, we were protected -- and it\u2019s very strange, by this -- I think it was -- his name was\nTiso, Father Tiso, the president of Slovakia. The area b-by the slava -- where my pa -- p -\n- father\u2019s family was from, became, after the Nazis occupied Czechoslovak, the Czech\npart, Bohemia and Mulravia, that Slovakian part became inde -- sort of independent, but\nit wa -- he was a Nazi, he collaborated with th-the Nazis. And when we came to\nAuschwitz, there were oodles -- I -- I mean, there had been several thousand, but of\ncourse they had died at a terrible rate because when they got to Auschwitz it was already\n-- there was nothing there. When we came, there were at least barracks. But they -- th --\nthey -- it was totally in -- unorganized and they slept in the winter in the mud. It was terri\n-- the things they told us and we could easily imagine it. So, on the one hand, he sent out\nthe young women into -- to certain death and didn\u2019t protect them. On the other hand, he\nwent through this diplomatic sham and protected the citizens -- Jewish citizens that were\nliving in different European countries. So we were not sent away until 1n -- in 1942, when\neverybody went, and then -- but hit -- the -- the Nazis were losing the war at that point, in\n1942, El Allemagne and in -- in Russia, in the different -- Stalingrad and probably\nLeningrad. So they wanted to show what they could do, they get rid of all the Jews, so\nthey would have this wonderful triumph of losing on one hand, but look what they\u2019ve\ndone, they\u2019ve killed a couple of more children and weak people and anyone, you know.\nSo we -- I -- a -- what was the beginning of the question? I started --",
        "A: Yeah, right, well we had -- yeah --",
        "A: So we -- yes, well this was 1n -- a -- right after everybody was taken away from -- in\n1942, they started in with us and we were taken out of the apartment and we had to move\nin a mini -- it was a mini ghetto. It was a -- an old apartment building in the east part of\nthe town, very old, it had been part of the Jewish area that was for people who came f -- I\nmean for -- people who came from Poland, didn\u2019t have much money, st -- wanted to be\nclose to the kosher butchers and all the kosher areas. So they lived in that particular are --\nand the houses were older. People who could afford it, had been longer in the city, moved\nout to the west end part of the town. So we were put back into this east side, into one of\nthe streets. And we were not allowed to leave. So for -- a-all -- I re -- know that it was\nthat Hanukkah we were still -- we were there already. So maybe we went in the fall of\n1942, that we went in. And the only one who could go out, was my father, because -- it\u2019s\nalso a long story -- do you have all this tape?",
        "A: Okay. My father had a factory of -- man-manufactured leather goods. I mean, not a\nbig factory, like a shop. And -- w-with a partner and in Offenback, which is across the\nriver from Frankfort -- I mean not -- it\u2019s a little further. And then it was not safe, or\nwhatever and they moved -- I mean, I don\u2019t know any of these details. They moved to a -\n- a loft in Frankfort in back of the railroad station. When my father -- then his partner left\nfor the United States. We\u2019ve tried to go to the United -- my father registered for the -- my\nfather had na -- had Czechoslovak citizenship and the quota of -- for the Slovakia was\nseven families a year, yeah. It -- we had number 77 and we -- so we would have had 10 --\n11 years to wait before we would even be called to the council. Now the council in\nStuttgart, he -- he should -- he -- he was a partner of Hitler\u2019s and he should -- I hope he\nrests with -- with Hitler together in hell, because he -- they -- it was a dreadful experience\nfor Jews to go there and he humiliated people and they -- I mean, it\u2019s not just him,\nwhoever it was, they -- ll give you an example. My fr-friend Irma -- my fr -- her father\nwas a lawyer, but when they figured they\u2019d have to leave, he wouldn\u2019t be able to make a\nliving as a lawyer, so he became a chef. They were called -- they had quite wealthy\nrelatives in the United States who put up as -- the affidavits. They were called, finally, to\nthe council in Stuttgart and he -- the -- she -- my friend passed and her mother passed and\nth -- they had been given mental tests and sometimes they picked such stupid questions to\ntrap people and then call them inf -- mentally inferior and they\u2019re not good enough to\ncome to the United States. So they p-passed all this. And then they found out that the\nfather, when he was 18, had his kid -- one kidney removed. Now, he -- it was healed, he\nbecame a lawyer, he became a father. So there was no reason to wi -- to hold him back,\nbut they did. And because of that, the family was lost. So -- and then -- coming -- I -- I --\nit\u2019s really not nice to talk about some of -- but one of the questions -- I remember they\nasked this poor woman who went -- her husband was already in the United States, she\nwent with her son to Stuttgart. And they asked -- they finally gave her this mental test\nand they told he -- they -- the question was, \u201cWhat does your husband have in his pants?\u201d\nAnd the poor woman got all flustered. Here was this modest woman who -- she probably\nnever heard a dir -- a dirty word or a dirty joke and then oh, they -- they ask her this. And\nof course she gets all flustered and she couldn\u2019t answer. So then they said, \u201cOh, but you\nmust be awfully stupid. He has a wallet and keys and a handkerchief. Why can\u2019t you\nthink of that?\u201d Well, she -- the poor woman, her life depended on it, so she couldn\u2019t think\nof it. And those were the -- the things that they did and that\u2019s why I feel thas -- so\nstrongly about this -- the person who ran this un -- drun -- they were horrible. So --",
        "A: Yeah?",
        "A: Well, when we were in this -- this building -- so my father -- my father --\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning Tape One, Side B",
        "A: Yeah?",
        "A: Well, when we were in this -- this building -- so my father -- my father -- this -- his --\nhis business was given to a Nazi, who was a dentist, a Dr. Holzman. And my fa -- 1-it was\nan award because he wa -- a reward for being -- for -- for being what he was. And I can\ntell you wh -- a-about it, as much as I know. He didn\u2019t know the first thing about my\nfather\u2019s business, which was manufacturing wallets, belts, pocketbooks. So, he kept my\nfather on and he needed -- he was frequently out of town and he needed someone to run\nthe business, so actually my -- my father was running the business for him, but not as the\nowner. When he wanted to confer with my father on something -- anything -- a design or\na button on a -- on a wallet, he would call him into my father\u2019s former office, open up the\ndrawer of my father\u2019s former desk, and there was a gun and the conversation was\nconducted over the gun, as if my father would do something to him, you know, but he\nhad to protect himself and show his authority and have -- to have this gun there. What\nthis man really was at -- when -- the rumors were -- and the rumors are pretty accurate\nduring the war -- during those times, but the rumors were that when he -- when there was\nan -- some kind of rumor of an assassination, of a killing, he was out of town. He must\nhave been the assassin and that\u2019s why they rewarded him with this business and that is\nwhy my -- h-he was very -- very often out of town and my father had to run the business\nfor him.",
        "A: When did he lose it?",
        "A: Oh, I don\u2019t know that. I mean, it had to be -- were probably sometime in 1942 and I\ndon\u2019t remember the -- the details. And I tell you, we were so beset from all sides that I-I\ndon\u2019t -- I don\u2019t know any more, exactly when -- when all this happened. All I know is\nthat towards the end, my f -- but when we were not -- before we were taken out of the\napartment, my f-father -- before we were moved into the ghet -- into this ghetto building,\nmy f -- he wanted my father to work at home and I had to bring the st -- the -- pick up the\nmaterials and deliver the ready made goods to him, in to -- in the office. I don\u2019t even\nknow with whom I spoke. I was looking for the name of the street and that was a street\nthat had been renamed with an Aryan name, so it\u2019s not even in existence any more and\neverything\u2019s been bombed. I couldn\u2019t even find the place any more. So it\u2019s -- it\u2019s been a -\n- you know, it was a terrible experience and it was -- and going back, I guess I -- in -- ina\nway it was good that I didn\u2019t see any of 1t any more. But then when my father was --\nwhen we moved into the -- into this ghetto building, my father went to work and he was\nthe only one who was -- of the family who was able to go out and work.",
        "A: Mm, well --",
        "A: Yeah, right.",
        "A: Oh, no, there were some people that -- yeah, but most of the time, they didn\u2019t even let\nthem into the camp. They didn\u2019t even survive enough, you know, to get into the camp.\nWhat happened again was that because we were the Czechoslovak -- and there were a\ncouple of Romanian citizens who were sort of protected, for awhile and there were a few\nmembers of a -- who had -- people who had been from mixed marriages. And it was very\neasy when the Christian partner was tired of the Jew, to say oh, he said something against\nNazi or he did something there and this and there wa -- there was some -- so there were a\nfew Jewish people -- the Jewish partners of those marriages in the -- in this building with\nus. So, I think we was 37 all together.",
        "A: Actually, the last -- I -- I hear now that some people survived, they were hidden. I\ndon\u2019t -- I don\u2019t -- didn\u2019t know anyone who was hidden, but we were really the last Jews.\nSo they put us on the train and we traveled for seven days. We traveled during the day\nand we stopped at night, because they didn\u2019t want the trains to be bombed and the Royal\nAir Force was, at that time, only -- mostly bombing at night. Later on they -- when the\nradar was better or whatever and they -- they were strong there, and the Nazis were --\ntheir guns were already knocked out, they were -- they were bombing during the day. So,\nat that time, we -- we were moving, that\u2019s why this -- these few hundred miles from\nFrankfort to Auschwitz took seven days to get us to. Well, what happened then, as I said\nbefore, they had -- the na -- the -- Hitler was losing, the Nazis were losing 1-in --\nmilitarily, so for his birthday, on the 19th of April -- the 20th of April was Hitler\u2019s\nbirthday, on the 19th they made him a present that Germany would be Judenrein and they\npacked us on the train on the 19th and sent us off to Auschwitz. Well, on the way, we\npicked up Polish non -- non-Jewish slave laborers, who might have complained, probably\nthat the food wasn\u2019t good, or that they were working too hard, or whatever and instead of\na slave labor camp, they were now sent to Auschwitz. But when we arrived, they were\nseparated from us and we were just the 37 of us and the men -- we -- I never saw my\nfather again. So, the men were in one way -- so we were probably -- maybe 15 or so\nJews, two children, my brother and a-another young boy. And I was not considered a\nyoung -- a -- a-- achild any more, because I could pass as a woman. I was 13, so I could\npass, looking like a woman. I mean, considered how emaciated everybody was there, I\nprobably looked like a big, strong person, you know. But -- so we were brought into the\ncamp, my mother and I and a couple of the other women. My a -- and my brother too.\nAnd we were tattooed. Our clothes were taken off and our hair was shaved and the other\nprisoners introduced us to this wonderful life in -- in Auschwitz. They were telling us\nwhat -- there\u2019s the gassing and there\u2019s the selections and everything -- it was like -- but\nthere was so many, it wasn\u2019t that I could get scared, because there was so many new\nimpressions coming in on me, that wer -- I was like -- I was absorbing it, but I couldn\u2019t --\ni-1t didn\u2019t sort of synthesize in my mind, but I knew it was happening. So that wh --\namong one of the things that they said was that, you know, they wouldn\u2019t take you -- they\nwouldn\u2019t take you into the gas chambers now, because for a few people, it doesn\u2019t pay to\nrun the gas chamber. So they\u2019Il figure you\u2019ll die or the next time there\u2019s a selection\nthey\u2019ll take you. And that\u2019s actually what it was.",
        "A: Well, it was -- it was actually Birkenau wh -- Auschwitz, but, you know, we stayed in\nBirkenau.",
        "A: Well, they brought people in. I don\u2019t know why they didn\u2019t do like in Majdanek -- in -\n- where did they have, Treblinka or Sobibor, where they killed people upon arrival,\neverybody. There will -- Auschwitz was a -- a camp. There was a -- the man\u2019s -- the\nmen\u2019s camp and then -- this was actually Birkenau again and one side -- I -- I\u2019m pointing\nbecause straight ahead were the crematorium and to the right were -- was the man\u2019s\ncamp. To the left were the two women\u2019s camps. In back of the man\u2019s camp -- camp was a\ng -- Gypsy lager and now the Gypsy get recognized, unfortunately they don\u2019t -- they\naren\u2019t recognized as having suffered as much, but now at least, they speak out. For the\nlongest time, no one remembered. They brought in whole families, put them in the -- into\nthis Gypsy camp, Segonnalager and every few months or so, they emptied out the\ncomplete camp, gassed everybody and then brought in more. I don\u2019t know where they\nfound all these people, but it was -- it was a horrible -- I -- I think -- the whole horrible to\ns -- to think that the whole family -- of course, 1t happened to our people, too, but there 1s\nwas visible to me. And that whole families were just dest -- overnight destroyed. It was --\nit was horrible. So this -- but in Auschwitz, people died. When I -- when we walked in,\nthere was a nurse with us, from Romania and it was a beautiful, bright day and the Nazi\nofficer there 1s standing with their boots polished and their pure, white gloves and their\nuniforms crisp and f -- ironed and we saw a woman being carried on a litter and you\ncould see that she was dead, except that I had never seen a dead person and -- I was 13\nyears old. So, this nurse said to me, \u201cOh, she\u2019s just sick.\u201d She didn\u2019t want me to be so\nfrightened. So people died at a tremendous rate in Auschwitz. And, when they didn\u2019t die\nand they were -- they died too slowly, they had the gas chambers, they had these\nselections and they brought in more people all the time. And the conditions were awful.\nThe f -- we had horrible food. In the morning we had something that was like tea -- I\nmean, they didn\u2019t even have the color of tea, they called it tea. I think 1t was because it --\nit took on the color because the barrels that they carried it in were rusty. So, that\u2019s what --\nwhy it was tea. They gave us something that was like an inch of bread and like a slice\nthat was about an inch thick and it was -- well, the bread probably was healthy because it\nwasn\u2019t any refined flour. Then they gave us a slice -- oh, probably also about an inch and\na half of either liverwurst or salami. And towards the end of my stay in Auschwitz, one\ntime | -- this was in the sum -- in the summer of 1944, when they were killing -- bringing\nin Hungarian Jews and they were killing them day and night. And I looked out at the\ncrematorium and I saw the smoke going up and I visualized that my piece of salami was\nhuman flesh and I couldn\u2019t eat it any more. I -- I -- whenever there was -- whenever I got\nthe salami -- we didn\u2019t get that every day, we got that like two, three times a week or so.\nWhenever I got it, I tra -- tried to trade it for a piece of bread, because I just couldn\u2019t eat\nit. And then -- I don\u2019t know -- I -- if we had three meals or two meals, but usually when\nwe came back from work and -- which was in -- in -- the first work we did was digging in\na field and they told us to f -- to dig here with this decrepit shovel that was all bent and\nyou couldn\u2019t get anything. And then wi -- after they filled this in, we -- and it was very,\nvery muddy in Auschwitz, there was a thick clay and mud. It was horrible. So they told\nus to dig here and then they filled this in. And then when there was a hole that we had\ndug, we had to fill it in again. It was designed to make us lose weight and lose spirit and\nwith the few hundred calories that they gave us, it was a -- you know, th -- every --\npeople died fr-from malnutrition alone, but there were other things, too. So --",
        "A: Well, we --",
        "A: My mother -- I turned around, they shaved our hair off. My mother -- I -- and we had\nno clothes on and that was when we first arrived. And I called for her and she answered\nme and I turned around and she wasn\u2019t -- I couldn\u2019t recognize her, because -- I mean, she\nhad no hair, she was in the nude. But my mother was a real strength, while we were in\nAuschwitz -- an-and everywhere -- my mother was a real strength to everyone. There\nwere young women there, they knew they would never see their mother\u2019s again, so they\nsort of adopted my mother and my mother would tell them, \u201cYou know it\u2019s going to be\nbetter, we\u2019re going to get out.\u201d And one of the strange things that -- I -- I don\u2019t know if\nthat can -- how that con -- how a psychologist would explain it, they spoke about food. I\nguess we were So starved that they spoke about food. They spoke about recipes and my\nmother actually provided recipes, how do you stuff a goose, how do you make certain\nchicken soup and they were going -- they were going -- I mean, with this -- with this\ncrummy food that we had, the two or 300 calories a day, they were daydreaming of all\nthis wonderful food and all the recipes and my mother encouraged it, because she saw\nthat\u2019s what they needed. And she always encouraged everybody. Once, there was a\nwoman who had give -- had enough poison to ki -- for her two children. When she came\nto Auschwitz, the first thing she wa-wanted to do was she ran to the electric wire, hoping\nto get -- electrocute herself, or on the way there, with the guards watching this and they\nwould shoot at her and kill her. And my mother ran after her and like -- there was a moat\nabout three feet deep before the electric wire and like a few feet -- and the guard was\nalready ready to shoot, because it was after say lapel in the evening, when you were not\nallowed to be outside. And my mother was after -- and she pulled her back in. Actually,\nthe woman survived and came to see us once, in Frankfort. So this is -- these are the\nkinds of things my mother was capable of. While we were in camp -- I wi -- she was a\nreal source of strength to everybody. Once we got out and we got into Frankfort, she was\nlike -- the ho -- all of her collapsed and she was -- I always said that it is a -- it was as\nthough someone had put a giant hand over her trachea and she could inhale enough air to\nexist, but not to live. And she -- she just -- she -- she looked at this destruction of\nFrankfort -- we came into Frankfort and th-the city was bombed. I think I could adjust\nbecause I was able to say, \u201cOh thank God there isn\u2019t one stone sticking next to the other.\u201d\nMy mother said, when she came in -- she was -- she had a ter -- a terrible fear. Her first\nimpression was that she was just frightened. Now, to me, I was 17, it seemed that my life\nwas ahead. To her, her home was gone, her whole family -- her f -- her husband. So she --\nas I said, she just existed, for the next 40 years. She existed, but she didn\u2019t live. She\ncouldn\u2019t enjoy herself, she was very difficult to get along with, with everybody. And she\nwas always dour, she was always depressed and she had a terrible -- I mean, it\u2019s -- she\nwas a real victim of the -- the Holocaust, again.",
        "A: Right, yeah. As soon as we came into Frankfort. As soon as we returned, which was --\nwe were liberated in May eighth, in 1945 and we were taken to a camp -- an open air ta --\ncamp, with tents, because it was in the spring. And it was run by the British army. They\nprovided food and a measure of clothing and medical care. My mother was in the hospital\nfor a few days, because her -- er -- the -- we were given -- the Red Cross -- the Swedish\nRed Cross had sent in food packages and we were given like first -- two people to a\npackage and by the time it got to us, it was five people to a package, which was really a\nlifesaver, because there were sardines and chocolate and thing and butter. And our\nstomachs weren\u2019t used to this and my mother was very, very sick from eating this. I mean\nfrom -- maybe one sardine and one piece of chocolate, or whatever and she had to be\ntaken to the hospital for about two days to get her stomach -- I don\u2019t know what the heck\n-- | think they gave her cereals or whatever to -- to str -- get this straightened out. So she -\n- when we -- when we got back to Frankfort, she was frightened. And I don\u2019t know how\nshe felt -- why she felt that she was frightened, but because of everything was gone and --\nand I think the strength she had was hoping maybe -- you know, we were hoping that\nmaybe my father would be alive, but it -- 1t seemed hopeless when -- once we got into the\ncity. We had arranged with everybody that we would go back to Frankfort, because then\nas a family, whoever would live would go. But he -- of course we knew that he wasn\u2019t\nalive. I was hoping -- I was hoping all the time.",
        "A: In -- 44. 19 four -- in 1945, she was 44.",
        "A: Well, we were given those packages and we -- we were taken on a walk for eight\ndays. From May first to May eighth, when it was over.",
        "A: Before this? Right before this?",
        "A: What was the date that -- President Roosevelt died in April sometime and I th -- some\nof the soldiers that were guarding us thought that this would be a turn around, but most of\nthem didn\u2019t think that the allies would give up. They knew they had lost the war. We\nwere in Mahlhoff, which was a slave labor camp. We had worked -- we had made bullets\nand grenades in an underground factory, hidden in the woods, which looked like -- you\nknow, it didn\u2019t look like there was any woods, but -- I mean, it didn\u2019t look like an -- there\nwas a factory, it was like little hills and there was a door and you walked in and there was\nfactories. And we -- but they stopped it, but the whole camp -- I mean, we had to walk\nquite a bit, but I understand that, the whole camp was honeycombed underneath with all\nthese factories and we didn\u2019t know -- we were thinking, \u201cWell, you know, the war is\ncoming to an end, they wouldn\u2019t want us to survive, they\u2019re probably going to blow up\nthe whole camp.\u201d But th -- I -- they didn\u2019t. They couldn\u2019t, because there were roads --\ntwo roads outside. I mean, one main road where the -- the soldiers --- the army was\nretreating, going west and the Germans of Polish na -- the Germans of -- that lived in\nPoland, folksdorger, that had lived in Poland, were now afraid of what the Russians\nwould do to them, because they had welcomed Hitler back and they had hidden their\nspies. So wh -- when -- the German spies, so when the Germans were ready to invade\nPoland, it fell like a ripe apple, because all this underground work had been done by the\nspies. So now, when they knew the Russians were coming, they were very much afraid\nand they took that road back. So the roads were clogged, so they couldn\u2019t really have\nblown us up. Well, they stopped giving us food. This was -- must have been the -- the last\ntwo days of April. And we didn\u2019t go to work any more. They stopped giving us food and\nwe -- there was a food riot. We went into -- can you stop for a minute?",
        "A: All right, remen -- remind -- [break] -- very few comical things had happened in --\nobviously in Auschwitz, but there\u2019s one story that I tell my grandchildren. They always\ntell me, \u201cTell me the potato story.\u201d This is what happened. The-They stopped giving us\nfood and we raided the -- we raced into the kitchen and into the storage places and we\ntook -- we were looking for food. My mother stayed in the barracks, but I went.",
        "A: Well, you know, their minds were already on other things. I mean, they knew they had\nlost the war. They were probably all trying to figure out how to get back out of there.\nWhen the riot became too -- too much, when too many people crowded into this storage\nplace, they were shooting into the air. They were trying to disperse us, but they didn\u2019t\nshoot into u -- into the crowd.",
        "A: I think they did once, I -- if I -- now that I think of 1t and someone got hurt, but not,\nyou know, not -- not badly. So we ran into this thing and it looked like the -- then -- the-\nthese Nazi soldiers had just gotten up. They left their food in the middle of the table with\nth -- the -- half eaten and they ran away, because they -- they knew that there were\nsoldiers -- the Russians probably were coming. So we raced -- and we -- we saw the food,\nbut all at once, we were looking for bigger and better and we raced through this storage\nplace and I found something that looked like noodles. So I wanted to take these noodles,\nwe hadn\u2019t had noodles in years. I\u2019m -- my God and what would I do? I -- I was wearing\ntwo pairs of underpants. One was the what -- what they gave us, a gray flannel and then,\nillegally, under it, I was wearing a pink silk that I had found someplace, 1t wasn\u2019t much\nof anything. And so I kept the pink silk on and I took off the gray flannel, pulled out the\nstring that was holding it on top, tied the legs together and put -- put these noodles into\nthe -- into these pants and walked away with it. And then, for -- we ate whatever we\ncould find. And I must tell you something, again with this -- Gypsies. A whole group of\nGypsies were brought to the camp and kept in a separate area. They had walked from I\ndon\u2019t know where, but -- and on the way they found dead horses and they found\nwhatever the -- food they could find and they brought it to camp with them. And do you\nknow, when someone would walk over -- and my mother told me don\u2019t go there. But wh\n-- if someone walked over, they would share the food with everybody. The only thing\nthey did was also that they -- they looked for th -- wood for to make it -- to barbecue the\nfood, you know, roast it a little bit. So they took everything apart. In the end, we couldn\u2019t\neven go to the toilets any more, because they had taken off the toilet seat -- you know\nthese planks that served as -- to -- as seats, to -- and they -- they burned everything. They\ntook the doors off the -- but, 1t was right, you know, that they did this. Well, anyway, we\nwere given this -- these boxes of food and we were told that we were leaving. And I\u2019m\ncarrying these potatoes -- I-I\u2019m sorry, the noodles with me. And then, on the way, we ran\nout of food and there was no one to supply us with anything. Every so often, in a field,\nwe would find little potatoes. We didn\u2019t wash them, ba -- there\u2019s no -- no way of\nwashing, w-we -- there was barely a fire. So we ate them ho -- half raw and full of sand\nand grit a-and we ate it like that. And then finally I said to my mother, \u201cYou know, I\u2019m\ncarrying these noodles and we got to cook them.\u201d Th -- She found a rusted tin can, we\nfound some water from somewhere and we started -- in the fire, we started cooking it.\nAnd as we were cooking this, this grew and grew and grew. It didn\u2019t act like noodles, it\ngrew and grew. And what I had cherished right along, while we were eating all these\npotatoes, I said, \u201cOh, I can\u2019t stand to look at these potatoes.\u201d What I had taken was\ndehydrated potatoes. So, my grandchildren now tell me, \u201cBut you say you would never\neat another potato. And so how come you\u2019re eating potatoes now?\u201d So this is one of the\nfunny -- well, funny, comical stories that came out of the Holocaust. But anyway, we\nwere walking -- now the end of the camp, it just -- we just stopped working and we -- and\nwe hung around and then they told us that we had to leave. So they lined us up five at a ti\n-- now, sometime -- some of the guards went -- I recognized some that were from\nAuschwitz that had just somehow appeared there, because they were running away. And\nothers were -- the ones that we had regularly had, and we walked. I guess we were\nwalking we -- to the west, but it was -- this was fairly north and there was a lake there.\nBut I right along thought we were along the North Sea, but we were a little bit south of\nthat.",
        "A: They ordered us to march and they were still -- I mean, I was amazed. The war was\nover, they knew they had lost and they were still carrying out orders of -- of making us\nobey.",
        "A: I si -- just away from --",
        "A: -- from wherever it was, you kn -- west. I mean, I know we were walking west\nbecause no one wanted to be going to the Russians, they were really -- I mean, they knew\nwhat they had done in Stalingrad or Leningrad and in -- in -- in all the cities in between,\nso they were very fearful of this revenge. And we walked and then we walked the fields\nand one time -- I think the last night, we came to a city and we came into a -- what had bi\n-- was an abandoned sugar factor -- sugar refinery. And we were settling in for the night\nand we had found some food already, that we were able to steal from the Germans and I\nwas walking around and I knew this -- I mean, it was -- you could se -- really see the guar\n-- the guards were disappearing. And all at once there was this woman, Drexler. She was\nan SS woman, she had been in Auschwitz and she was sitting in what had been an office,\nlittle place and she was cleaning her gun. And she saw me walking there and she called\nme in. And I figured, \u201cOh, my God. You have come so far and now she\u2019s cleaning her\ngun there and who knows what she has in mind.\u201d And she had told me that -- and she\nsaid -- she said to me, \u201cOh, you know, pretty soon you\u2019ll be free and then you\u2019ll be doing\nwhat -- to us, what we did to you.\u201d And here she\u2019s -- she\u2019s still in power and I said to her,\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t worry, won\u2019t be so bad, they wouldn\u2019t do anything,\u201d and all this kind of thing.\nI wanted to get my -- talk myself out of it and finally she let me go out. This was my --\nmy last experience with the Nazis -- you know, with real Nazis. That was at night and the\nnext morning we were still -- they still made us get up and walk. And we walked and\nwalked. Towards middle afternoon, we came to -- I -- I don\u2019t remember, was it earlier? I\ndon\u2019t know. We came on a -- onto a highway and there were tanks there, without\nswastikas, with five pointed white stars on it. The language was not German. Now, I had\nstudied English, so -- in -- in high school. Of course I wasn\u2019t very good at it at that point,\nI hadn\u2019t spoken it. So -- but, just to hear the English and of course we knew that was it.\nA-Across from where we came out of this clearing and met the highway, there were --\nsetting up, there were rows and rows of Nazis, of SS people. And you know, the SS had\nsome kind of a tattoo under one arm. I think under the left arm, the way they were\nstanding, to identify them. They had done this for their own protection, but now it\nworked against them. So they examined everybody under the arm and they knew who\nwas a Nazi and who was not and then I don\u2019t know what they did with them, we didn\u2019t\nknow any more. But we, from that point on, were able to walk away.",
        "A: Dah -- we stayed in -- we stayed 1n a building. Someone said go here -- go there and\nwe stayed in a building overnight. The building -- and this was near the Elba, where the\nRussians and the Americans and the English and some of the French met. And every few\nhours there was a different army taking care of -- you know, passing through. We went\ninto a building that had been a -- a factory for coffins. Was -- the man who owned it,\nlived in the front. He had a beautiful backyard, with orchard, it was just gorgeous. And\nthere was this factory on the side. And we slept -- some people sl -- we slept on the floor.\nIn the middle of the night -- the Russians had been celebrating --\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "A: -- middle of the night -- the Russians had been celebrating and they were -- really had\n-- really celebrated and they were drunk as anything. So they tried to drive up -- they\nknew there were girls up there. So they tried to drive up the steps on their motorcycles\nand of course, they kept falling back. Then, someone had a horse and he tried to go up\nthe steps on the horse and that didn\u2019t work. So he tied up the horse in the backyard and\nthis horse trampled on this German\u2019s lawn. And that lawn had been so perfect, that I can\nimagine he must have been furious a -- he saw all this -- all this lawn dug up by this\nhorse. But when we woke up in the morning, some of the young women -- it had never\noccurred to me, because I considered myself a child, I didn\u2019t think any soldier would\nwant me -- some of the women had taken some of that black paint that they use for\ncoffins and smeared in on their faces because they didn\u2019t want to be seen. Some had\nactually climbed into a co-coffins while all this noise was going on outside with the\nmotorcycles and the horses and the stuff. Some of the -- so -- but, in the morning we sort\nof dispersed.",
        "A: Oh, it was --",
        "A: -- you know, at -- for one minute, I -- I was walking along the sugar factory and I\u2019m\nthinking, now I\u2019m on the outside, on the ball there and I\u2019m standing there and I\u2019m saying,\n\u201cOh, my God, I can do what I want, I can go where I want to go.\u201d I couldn\u2019t, of course,\nbut 1t was a whole, \u201cOh my gosh, this 1s -- this 1s life again.\u201d And it was -- it was a\nwonderful thing. I mean, a -- four -- like a millisecond. It just -- in a little part of a\nsecond, I was thinking, \u201cOh, my God, someone has to tell me what to do, because I\u2019m\ntotally lost here.\u201d This is a whole new experience and, you know, and in -- in Auschwitz\nyou couldn\u2019t do anything without anyone telling you. I mean, if you -- you had to stand\nstraight and they told you to do it and you had to do it. And -- but that didn\u2019t last very\nlong. I mean, I -- I knew then, of course I -- we couldn\u2019t -- we didn\u2019t celebrate. There\nwere people vi -- immediately, in the evening, there was a castle with a big -- or an inn or\nsomething and all the Polish, non-Jewish people went up there, dancing and drinking and\nsinging. And we -- we couldn\u2019t celebrate, we could only still think of all the people we\nhad lost and all the people that were gone and the fires and the burning and the cyanide\nand all this. And there -- there was no way and we knew we wouldn\u2019t find anyone.\nMaybe these other people were hoping when they go back to their houses, there would be\nsomeone there. There would be something that isn\u2019t just -- but for us, everything was\ndestroyed, so there was -- really, it was very -- it wasn\u2019t depressing, but 1t was -- 1t was\nvery somber. We couldn\u2019t think of -- of anything else [inaudible]",
        "A: Not really, I --",
        "A: -- yeah, right, well you see, these were people we didn\u2019t know. There were groups of\nFrench women and we really didn\u2019t have anything to do with the Polish and Ukrainian\nwomen. So, it was my mother and I and something very -- another sort of strange thing\nhappened. She walked in the street and a Russian officer asked her what she wanted. And\nshe speak -- spoke a few words of Russian. And she said she\u2019s hungry. So there was a\nchicken crossing the street, he grabbed the chicken, threw his head -- threw the chicken\u2019s\nhead against the wall, killed it. Gave it to my moth -- handed it to my mother and say,\n\u201cHere, you have your supper.\u201d She came back to this coffin factory, plucked the chicken\nand she made chicken sou -- chicken soup or roast chicken, I forgot what it was, but she\ncooked the chicken for us. But there weren\u2019t all that many people that we shared with or\nanything. And you know, it -- we didn\u2019t make -- we didn\u2019t speak any more about the\nfuture, we were just concerned about what was happening right then and there to -- to\nfind some kind of normalcy. But my mother -- see, I had dr -- hoped that we would still\nfind my father. My mother -- we were -- while we were in Auschwitz in 1943 --\nChristmas of 1943, they had given -- Germany celebrates two ni -- days of Christmas, but\nthe first -- they only celebrated -- they gave us one day off. So most people slept, but my\nbrother had been separated from us already. So we wanted to see if we could find -- see\nhim, just to know that he was alive, but -- and so we went outside and whomever we\nspoke -- and we tried to attract attention with -- in the man\u2019s camp, which was separated\nby a road and he -- we couldn\u2019t get them. But it -- the night before, a woman who had\nbeen smuggled into camp -- had -- no, not -- not smugg -- she was taken into the camp,\nbut she didn\u2019t -- they didn\u2019t tell anyone that she ha -- that she was pregnant and she had\ngiven birth that night to a boy. There were a couple of Christian women, Catholic\nwomen, Polish, in the crowd and they felt, oh, on Christmas eve, a Jewish boy was born,\nunder those terrible conditions, a miracle was going to happen. And they thought the\nmiracle -- they brought in -- they had found a little twig about this tall, of -- of greens\nand they made -- called it a Christmas tree. Did I talk about this at the time, you know?",
        "A: All right. So, anyway, my mother dr -- her -- dreamt that he -- my -- that my father\nappeared to her and said to her, \u201cNow, it\u2019s time to say Kaddish.\u201d So my mother was\nconvinced that my fa -- well, of course, given all the c-circumstan -- conditions, she knew\nthat my father wasn\u2019t alive. I didn\u2019t believe this. I knew th -- I thought that he would\nappear somewhere. And I was hoping maybe -- maybe I\u2019d find him in an insane asylum.\nMaybe he was just very sick and we\u2019d have to nurse him back. I mean, I was trying to\nimagine everything that I could, that -- just to find him. And of course, didn\u2019t. Then,\nwhen we were in Frankfort after awhile, my uncle in Israel -- in Israel they got a lot of\nlists of survivors and they tried to find families. My uncle found someone and -- who was\nstill in Europe, with my father\u2019s name. So my uncle got all excited and thought this was\nmy father. And he wrote to us. So this had to be while we were back in Frankfort, though.\nI mean this was going on a long -- and while -- and I -- I -- | expected my father to --\nwhen -- after I read this, I expect my father to walk in any minute.",
        "A: Ithzac Krautvit. What it turned out to be was that this had been a cousin of my\nfather\u2019s. He had changed his name to Ithzac Krautvit, I don\u2019t know, maybe the Krautvit\nname was better known -- what was -- I don\u2019t know what. But he -- whatever it was, his\nfirst name had been Ithzac, like my father\u2019s and he -- he had the last name and you know\nwhat? We -- we had the -- a visa to come to the United States and I was hoping -- I was\nhold -- didn\u2019t let my mother g-go, with some of the -- we went on the last boat that we\ncould possibly go while our visa was still valid, because I didn\u2019t let her go, I thought my\nfather would show up. So --",
        "A: Well, we were -- in the fall of 1945, when we couldn\u2019t stay in that tent camp any\nmore, they asked us where we could go. And we -- cause we had been in Frankfort, they\nsent us back to -- others were taken to a more permanent, like wooden barrack camps.\nYou know, the -- many of the DP camps in Germany. We were sent to Frankfort. That\nwas in the fall of 1944 -- five.",
        "A: From the time we were liberated, from April -- May, I\u2019m sorry. Probably May eighth,\nMay 10th, somewhere like that. Until the fall sometime, I don\u2019t kn -- you know.",
        "A: Four or five months, yeah.",
        "A: That was in a -- it was administered by the British army, so it had to be somewhere in\nnorthern Germany.",
        "A: We went to Frankfort, yes. It took a long time, too, because we went by trucks and\nthen we went by broken down trains and -- and you know, nothing was really working\nyet. And we arrived at the bombed out train station and we didn\u2019t\u2019 know where to go,\nbecause you know, they just dropped us there, that was it. And we looked out and the\nbuildings all around were destroyed. So then someone to-told us that a -- an a -- an\nAmerican soldier -- and it might have been this Mr. Klein, who\u2019s married to Gerda Klein,\nbecause he was looking -- this man was looking for relatives in -- from Frankfort. And he\nhad looked throughout Europe, wherever he was -- he was a soldier and he had been in ba\n-- in Italy. And again, someone told him there was a young boy from Frankfort and he\nwas -- thought, well maybe this boy could tell him something. Well, the boy didn\u2019t know,\nbut he told him his history and his name. And when this man now came in Frankfort to\nthe train station, he was again trying to find news about people o-of his family, abou --\npeople who might have known or might know something, what happened to them. And\nwe started talking to him and then he said, \u201cYou know, while I was at Italy, I spoke to a\nlittle boy and -- I mean, a young boy, he s -- he sounds like 1t would be your son,\u201d to my\nmother. And it turned out that he was right and he gave us addresses to write to. Of\ncourse, everything was destroyed and the mail took weeks and weeks and weeks. And my\nbrother had been liberated by the isr -- the Palestinian contingent of the British army --\nyou know, there were volunteers. They were anxious to get him to Israel, because they\nknew there would be a war. He was still a minor, so he -- the British would let him in.\nThey knew he would be -- there would be a war and they had another man to fight. So,\nwhile he was -- he was in Barian, Italy when he wrote to us, but while the mail was going\nup and back, he was already going to Palestine. And we went to Frankfort, so at least we\nknew that he was alive.",
        "A: And we went to Frankfort sometime in the fall. It was a very gloomy, dark day when\nwe arrived, was terrible.",
        "A: Mm. The first place where we stayed -- I don\u2019t know where -- how we found it or who\ntold us about it. There was a Jewish hospital and parts of it had been bombed and parts of\nit had r-remained, but if you went out too far, you could fall off into the -- into the rubble.\nSo, we were given a room and in bis -- with a hospital bed and that was -- that was it.\nBut, there was some water once in awhile and I don\u2019t know what we did for hot -- for\nheat or whatever, because the -- the a -- the air was coming in throughout, you know? But\nI guess we were so used to suffering that a little more or less cold or whatever, didn\u2019t\nmatter much. Eventually -- because we had been from Frankfort, we were given an\napartment where a Nazi was thrown out. A Nazi family, they had been members of the\nparty. So we stayed in that apartment until we left in the be -- March of -- of -- well,\nFebruary, March of 1946 -- 1947. No, we stayed in that apartment for the whole time.",
        "A: Yeah, I want to stop for a minute, yeah. Do you want anything else?",
        "A: Yeah. I went back to high school.",
        "A: Oh, but it was -- it was terrible, because I had six years of schooling, four years of --\nthe system is different, four years of grammar school and eight years of high school 1s\nhere, but there was eight years of -- wait a minute -- you have four ye -- no, it was the\nreverse from what the United States has. The United States had four years of high school\nand eight years of gra -- of pepperto -- we -- we had four years of high s -- of grammar\nschool and eight years of high school. So, when I went back to -- first of all, my mind\nwas not adjusted. When I went back to the -- to the time there were my a -- for my age\ngroup, they were way ahead of me. And I was not good in math at that point. You know,\nmath is difficult. English I had no problem, languages I had no problem with. Latin,\nanything. But the math and the sciences -- and then, it was very difficult because the\nschools ha -- we-were not really set up prop -- there -- things had been bombed, you\ncouldn\u2019t get books, you couldn\u2019t get paper. There -- the la -- there were no laboratories,\neverything was destroyed. So, it really wasn\u2019t -- 1t really wasn\u2019t school.",

        "A: No, I -- I guess not. I -- I don\u2019t know, I was -- you know, I wasn\u2019t even angry any --\nany more. When we came to Frankfort, everything was bombed and I knew there had to\nbe bodies underneath. And yet, I was praying that I shouldn\u2019t see when they dig up --\nwhen they straighten this out, that there would be a body in there, because I don\u2019t know\nhow I would react. I would probably feel pity, but I felt that -- look what they did to us\nand why should I then feel pity when I see the enemy\u2019s body? And yet, I had become\nhuman again and I didn\u2019t want to see this. So, living in -- in Germany, was not -- it\nwasn\u2019t easy in the beginning. So --",

        "A: -- yeah. What had happened was that one synagogue was not -- had not been\ndestroyed in 1938 -- it was a Reform synagogue -- because there were houses around and\nthey figured if they burn it, their houses would be affected, so they used it during the war\nas a storage and stalls and whatever. And when -- there were American sold -- Jewish\nsoldiers in Frank -- stationed in Frankfort and came Rosh Hashanah -- the first Rosh\nHashanah, in 1945. They cleaned out the synagogue and they had -- we had services\ntogether. Now here was all this Jewish people and this is a whole different thing. And\nthey brought in wine and cakes and stuff, so it was a nice situation. Those were the --\nthey were groups -- there were some places, and I didn\u2019t go that often. There were other\nJews living in town and there were -- like a cl -- there was a club that you could go to,\nthey showed movies, they showed plays. One time, the habeema came to -- to Salzheim,\nactually, and they invited all the Jews from -- who lived in Frankfort, also to come to\ntheir performance. It\u2019s -- it\u2019s the -- you\u2019re familiar with it? It\u2019s the -- no, it\u2019s an Israeli\ntheater group. What they did -- and this is one of the funny things that happen, again.\nThey came to Salzheim and they trained actors f -- took them out from the DP camp and\ntrained them to be actors. They were giving the story -- the -- the debook. Have you ha --\ndo you know the story -- are you familiar with it? The debook is -- it\u2019s a very solemn play\nand this girl is obsessed with the debook and most of it -- most her obsession takes place\nbackstage and they talk abou -- in -- in this particular production, anyway. And they\ntalked about her being a y-you know, that -- that what\u2019s happening to her. But the -- the --\nthe hoosen, the one that was -- had died and had given up his soul and was now in an -- in\nthe other hoosen\u2019s body, he\u2019s onstage and then finally they bring out this -- the bride and\nit was such a solemn thing. A bride is coming and white dress and you look up and she\nwas about nine months pregnant. And everybody broke up. It was really -- they shouldn\u2019t\nhave let this go through, because such as -- it -- it really ruined the effect. So, this was\none of the th -- but they couldn\u2019t help it, because during this time, while they were\nrehearsing, all this was happening. So -- but this sticks out in my mind, b-but I probably\nwould have forgotten that we went to see the debook, except for this incident. And so, in\nSalzheim and in the cities, they were -- there were enough Jews and sometimes Jewish\nsoldiers, who con -- helped us continue with Jewish life.",

So this is the kind of thing we\nwere able to establish with American Jews and there were -- there were enough Jews --\nsome of them originally from Frankfort and some of them from other cities in Germany\nand a lot of them from Poland. But the ones from Poland mo -- stayed mostly in the DP\ncamps. But think the -- as I said, they did give concerts and they did give other things and\nit was nice.",

After the war, I wanted to go to\nIsrael. I mean, was Palestine, of course. I keep saying Israel, but it was Palestine at the\ntime. If I had been alone, I would have definitely gone to Israel because I felt there is\nsomething, I had to be with Jews, because of this terrible experience and I felt that we\ndidn\u2019t have -- if there had been a homeland, then all this could have been avoided. And I\nstill do this, I was telling my son Allen that I\u2019m a great admirer of the 12th century Rabbi\nMeyer Fuffenberg, who wanted to go to Israel and I keep think -- and he was a great\nadministrator and I keep thinking, \u201cYou know, this is wonderful. If he had only made it.\u201d\nHe was betrayed by someone in a -- in a -- while he was waiting for a ship to come into\nItaly. And I keep -- kept telling Allen, \u201cYou know, I should write a story of what\nhappened -- that he actually made it there and he set up a Jewish state and everything was\nwonderful.\u201d Of course the crusaders were there at the time, so it couldn\u2019t work, but\nanyway -- so I felt right along that I should go to Is -- but my mother didn\u2019t want to go.

        "A: No, no. You don\u2019t -- you don\u2019t -- you don\u2019t -- because it was just a matter of surviving",
        "A: -- from one day to another, so I mean, who thinks of boys? I mean, no, no.",
        "A: Besides, they gave us this stuff in the -- in the soup, that they give to the soldiers and\nI\u2019m trying to think of the name and for days now it\u2019s evaded me.",
        "A: Yeah, saltpeter, right. And, in -- in Auschwitz, I mean, I never saw one wo -- | think it\nhad to affect people in other ways. I never saw one woman menstruating and I don\u2019t\nknow if it was because of a lack of fat in the diet or it\u2019s because it was that saltpeter stuff,\ndrolemite.",
        "A: Or whatever.",
        "A: But I don\u2019t know of anyone who -- who -- even they were fantasizing about food, but\nthey were not -- not as I know of, that they were fantasizing about men.",
        "A: Mm.",
        "A: Oh. It was nice, it was good. We -- we had an apartment. My husband was an\naccountant, but he didn\u2019t -- his brother had -- was a CPA and he didn\u2019t want to sit in an\noffice, like a si -- th-the CPA did. So, before the war, he had answered an ad and no one\nwanted to really hire him, because they fig-figured he would leave for the a -- he was\nready for to go to the army. So he answered an ad for someone for temporary work as a\nfurrier. And he did that. When he came back, he was finishing school and under the GI\nbill, he was getting paid for that. So he became the -- an accountant, but when he needed\nit, he worked part time for a furrier. And he felt that this was better, more interesting\nwork than sitting behind a desk. And now, when I speak to my children, they tell me they\nwould never want to sit behind a desk. Two of my sons, anyway. And so my husband\nworked for a furrier, finished school and after he graduated, we got married and he didn\u2019t\nlike his boss, ni -- we were married maybe two years and we started a business.",
        "A: Well, yes. Let\u2019s see now. Allen was born 1952 and we were married 1948 -- I mean\nthe end of 19 four -- fif -- so, actually 1949, practically. And so we were married with --\nprobably two, three years when he --",
        "A: No, I was really -- well, of course, I mean --",
        "A: I don\u2019t -- I -- I -- probably I\u2019m not a judge of that. I think by -- my husband would\nhave been able to answer that much better.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, but one of the things that I\u2019ve done and I\u2019m -- oh, I\u2019m still doing it and\nit\u2019s very bad, is that I -- I -- I\u2019m -- can be led. I -- I don\u2019t stand up for myself and I think -\n- and my husband sensed that and he was doing that. But, he wou -- didn\u2019t do it to -- to\nthe bad, so it wasn\u2019t -- you know, it wasn\u2019t a bad -- it was a good marriage, I would say.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: And then our son Allen was born in 1952, so I think the business might have started in\n1951, and it was successful from the beginning.",
        "A: Yeah, my husband had gone to a school -- under the -- after he graduated, he went to\nschool -- to designing school and he took several courses in designing and for work. And\nit was very successful from the beginning.",
        "A: Yeah. And I learned it too, because then I was pregnant, I went in to help, you know,\njust to hang around and I did that and I -- I f --",
        "A: Well, we rented a tiny little place in Patterson. Uptown, not in the downtown area.\nThen we moved to f -- into a rented store in Fairlawn. And two of our sons -- my oldest\nson 1s a rabbi. Two of our sons went -- finished college and they decided they didn\u2019t want\n-- this is really -- it hurts me so much to speak about this. They decided they did not want\nto go to grad school. And we were begging them. They were two and a half years apart\nand my mother talked them into, \u201cOh, your parents have a wonderful business, why don\u2019t\nyou go --\u201d and we didn\u2019t want them no how. We didn\u2019t want this for them. It\u2019s seasonal,\nit\u2019s cyclical, we didn\u2019t want it. And they did.",
        "A: They both went into the business with us.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah. And we built a building and my -- we were in the building for about a year and\na half and my husband died suddenly. I mean, we knew he was sick, but it wasn\u2019t -- we\ndidn\u2019t expect that, because he really didn\u2019t have any real symptoms.",
        "A: That -- when was that?",
        "A: 1986. So it\u2019s now 12 years. And the business was very good for a few years and then\nthe fur business was hit by all kinds of things. And three years ago our sons went out of\nbusiness, but in -- Norman, my youngest had a tragedy with a nearly born child and very\nde -- late pregnanc -- stillborn child, almost. I mean, he was like eight months or\nsomething pregnant. And it sent them into a tailspin and they sold everything and they\nwent to Israel. The building, I had a lot of problems with, I couldn\u2019t sell it or the -- well, I\ncould have sold it for half of what -- because the -- the real estate people and -- and all the\npeople that are around, they remind me of the villains in the movies, you know, with the\nwax mustaches and how they\u2019re going to cheat the -- the orphans and the widows and\nthat\u2019s how I felt about it. I was given terrible orders and the -- offers, and the building\u2019s\nbeen empty for three years and my one -- my middle son went into Wall Street, in the\nstock market, he\u2019s doing fairly well, but he\u2019s -- the -- the other day the s -- market was\ndown and everybody called him, \u201cHow come you didn\u2019t tell me to sell?\u201d You know, I\nmean as if he had known and as if he could control it. But -- so this is what -- so he\u2019s --\nhe\u2019s -- he likes it, but 1f he could go into another business, he would probably consider it\nor at least part-time. I tried to sell the -- rent the building to a Russian bakery, Jewish --\nJewish people and we signed a contract and all and they defaulted. They walked out. So\nwhen I said this to my son Norman, he said, \u201cYou know, Mom, why don\u2019t I come back\nand do a bakery?\u201d But not -- he\u2019s not going to be a baker baker, you know, but be a bus --\nhave a business and open several branches and that\u2019s where we are right now. He\u2019s in\nIsrael, he\u2019s try -- we have the financing, he\u2019s trying to set up a bakeshop. And it\u2019s a\nbeautiful, beautiful building and there\u2019s really, probably a need for it and he had good\nideas, which -- quality control and things like that. So \u2019'm keeping my fingers crossed\nit'll work. It\u2019s not what I had wanted for them. Na -- The -- it\u2019s really the reverse of my\nsituation. I wanted to go to college, my mother didn\u2019t let me. We were pushing them to\ncontinue with grad school. Mark had been so wonderful with Russian jury and I thought\nhe would go into international law. Norman tried all kinds of things, he -- they all went to\ngood schools, Brandeis and Washington University in Saint Louis. And NYU and it --\nit\u2019s sh -- it\u2019s -- really hurts me that they didn\u2019t -- and that they -- at this point in their life,\nthey still are thinking of -- of having to -- of changing jobs and -- and whatever.",
        "A: When did -- I think when my son Allen was in the last year of high school. I felt --\nwell, it was because I saw an ad for a junior college. And they didn\u2019t require any high\nschool papers. But of course, once I started that school, I graduated with almost perfect\nscores. Grade point averages or so -- almost close to four, like 396 in -- in one and 398 or\nwhatever it was -- something like that. And I -- I loved it. I really loved it and I was very\ngrateful that I was able to do it.",
        "A: Well, you know, it\u2019s sort of a while, because I was working, so I couldn\u2019t gr-graduate\nin -- I couldn\u2019t get my Bachelor\u2019s degree in four years, da -- probably five or six. And\nthen I -- I couldn\u2019t get my Master\u2019s in, you know, two years like everybody else,\nprobably was three or four and -- because I had to work and then I always tried to make it\nup in the summer courses and they\u2019re terrible, but I guess maybe you know about that\ntoo. And, but I did and that was it. And then, of course, when I went to grad school, my\nmother was sick and it made it very -- very difficult. I was torn in all directions and -- and\nI still managed to get a -- a very good grade point average. I started writing and some of\nmy stories had been published. I haven\u2019t done anything lately because I -- I -- my mind\nwas on oth -- so many other things. And right now, putting dow -- have the first four\npages of my biography written. And everybody\u2019s after me to do -- my sons are after me\nto do it. I lecture a lot on the Holocaust and this was a -- really a saving th -- grace for\nme. I was never be able -- I was never able to speak about it. I didn\u2019t speak to my mother\nabout it. I couldn\u2019t mention my father to her, it was just too painful and I didn\u2019t want to\nawoke anything in her that wo -- that would hurt her.",
        "A: So I ne -- I\u2019ve -- no. I mean, if she mentioned something -- she spoke about the\nHolocaust to my children, I did not. My brother and my mother were able to watch the\nEichmann trial and I -- they were sometimes in my house and watched it and I closed the\ndoor to the den, because I didn\u2019t want to hear it. But then I went to a meeting that wa --\nwe had a very good Y in Bergen County. Actually, it was in Waim, which is Pasay Count\n-- doesn\u2019t matter, but it was [indecipherable] Fairlawn. And I somehow got myself onto\nthat committee. They needed a -- a chairman and somehow -- somehow I was chosen.\nNow, when you are chairman of a committee like this and we had way over a thousand\npeople come to all the -- every year. When -- I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like now. When\nyou\u2019re chairman of this, you -- I mean, you have to listen and you have to write about it\nand that is how I -- it helped me to write, to face it, to -- to -- to speak about it and I th --\nit -- 1t\u2019s done a lot for me, just talking about it, because before that I couldn\u2019t.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Well, let\u2019s see, Allen was -- so that had to be like probably 22 or so years ago and at\nthat point --",
        "A: I hadn\u2019t been back. My husband had been to the fairs -- are you too cold because the\nwindow in back is open?",
        "A: Yeah, you know, we\u2019re busy and [indecipherable]",
        "A: Oh, can you do it yourself?",
        "A: Okay. There\u2019s another one, you want me to do that?",
        "A: My son Allen had decided to become a rabbi. He went to the University of Rochester\nas a pre-med student, changed his mind and wanted to become a rabbi. So, he had -- he\ntook a year abroad study at the Hebrew University. And then, after he graduated, he\nneeded to -- the theological seminary -- Jewish theological seminary in New York wanted\nhim to take another year. The language, you know. So he stayed in Nevishektar, which\nwas part -- and he took courses at the Hebrew University too, but grad courses. The same\n-- my other two sons did the same thing, as undergraduates. So Norman, my youngest\nson, was the same -- there the same year that Allen was in graduate school. And we -- my\nhusband wanted me to go and see the fur shows in Frankfort. So they were usually in the\nspring and we went first to Israel. We left Mark at home -- our middle son, and we went\nto Israel and -- to be with our two sons and then we took them back to Frankfort, because\nthey had vacation and Mark met us in Frankfort. We all stayed in -- we took two rooms,\nwe all s -- they stayed in -- 1t was wonderful for them, the three of them. They had been\nin different colleges and there they were all together for a week. And then after we -- for\nPesach, we went home, but Mark went with his brothers to Israel. And this -- the three of\nthem stayed in Israel, was very -- was nice for them. But when we were -- came to\nFrankfort -- when we left Israel to go to Frankfort, E] Al was on strike and we had to beg\na Luftansa pilot to get us onto the -- onto the plane, which I loved. Th -- You know,\nreally hated to -- to beg a German. And next to me was a woman -- a Bahai nun. And you\nknow that beautiful temple that the Bahai have in tel -- in Haifa? Well -- and I didn\u2019t ever\nrealize what it was. Actually, they are an offspring of the Muslim faith, but they are --\nthey were persecuted by the Nazis, just like the Jews. And she was telling me her\nexperiences -- of her friends that were killed. And we were flying into Frankfort and I\nwas telling someone the other day, if there had been blood on the tarmac when we\nlanded, I would have said, \u201cSure, I expect that.\u201d So, we went in and we went to the first\nshows -- be -- which was sort of an easy transition then. But of course I was not -- we\ndidn\u2019t go for that at the time. So we went to only the Jewish places. We went to that\nhouse where the little girl was -- lived, who had been sterilized. We went to the house\nwhere I lived. We went to the cemeteries where my grandparents were buried and some\naunts -- baby aunts and things like that. Went to the synagogues, went to the kosher\nrestaurants. And it was -- we didn\u2019t go to the German places. We didn\u2019t go to the\ngerdahouse, we didn\u2019t go to the German muse -- th-the city museum, even though I found\nout later on, they have a great Judaica collection. I was there last -- this past summer -- I\nmean, just a few months ago and I wanted to go in, but they were redoing it and you -- I\ncouldn\u2019t get in. And I wanted to see the Ju-Judaica collection. I didn\u2019t want to see\nGerda\u2019s picture hanging there, you know, and things like that.",
        "A: Well, what I wanted to do w-when my husband -- my husband retired and he -- in\nJune and then in August he died, end of August. But, we didn\u2019t know that -- of course,\nidea how sick he was. And what I wanted to do was work on a doctorate get myself\ninvolved with a -- a cu -- university here, go over and work on a doctorate on research on\nthe last stages of the community, because I knew all this. But then my husband died. So it",
        "A: In -- in 1943, you know -- ah, well, this is what I had planned. Maybe something --\nonce I would have started the research, I would have gone into a whole different\ndirection.",
        "A: I could have gone into Middle Ages or the -- or the -- or medieval ghetto, which was -",
        "A: Yeah. So anyway, we -- I -- now I saw the mu -- the Judaica -- I didn\u2019t see the Judaica\ncollection, but I was hoping to. So we -- in many ways -- but I -- but I wouldn\u2019t be able to\n-- | couldn\u2019t have done this on my own. If my husband were alive and w-we would have\nlived there together, I would have been able to study and read -- do research. As I -- as it\nis, when I\u2019m there for -- for a week or so, it\u2019s more than enough. I -- I can\u2019t wait to get\nhome. I went -- I -- I met my cousin there and I -- once, and I stayed for a week. We went\n-- I go to my -- my best friend Irma\u2019s house, where she -- her last home. I don\u2019t have a\ngrave to vis-visit and to me it\u2019s like going to -- to her -- through her grave. And even now\nwhen I was there, I stand in front of the house -- the house has been -- is much more fixed\nup. It was an apartment building or -- or whatever. I don\u2019t know, maybe it\u2019s more like a\ntenement house, it was like a six family house. And it\u2019s like standing in -- in front of a\ntombstone. And I feel that if -- she were to come out, carrying a -- a tray of cookies, I -- I\nalways picture that. With her hair slightly gray and she would call me in and say come in,\nwe got to discuss the grandchildren. But, of course, it doesn\u2019t, but I picture this all the\ntime. So, I stand in front of her house and -- and that\u2019s it. But -- and I go to see the\nbuilding where our school was. I go to the ce -- I go to the cemeteries, but this time I\nwent to Prague and Pilsen. I was in Frankfort only a short time. And everything 1s so sad.\nEverything 1s so terrible and my -- I was 1n Pilsen because my uncle was shot there. I\nthink I told you the beginning of the -- of -- of the interview. And he was -- and it was so\ndepressing, I had -- when I arrived, I thought I would find all kinds of signs that he had\nbeen there, so I told the girl in the hotel that I would stay for two days, maybe three days.\nAnd after one day I had enough and I left. The only problem I had then, when I was\nleaving, while I was waiting for the tax1, I -- there was something that was telling me that\nI hadn\u2019t looked enough, that there\u2019s something there that I hadn\u2019t found and so far I have\nresisted accepting invitations at other ye -- the German government invites people from --\nto their native city back and they go through the age category, you know, the certain age\ngroups. That\u2019s how my cousin ended up in Frankfort and I went to see her at the same\ntime. She\u2019s from Israel. She lives in Israel. So, I have resisted this, but I think next time I\nwould accept and -- but I would want to go back to Pilsen because I -- even if there\u2019s\nnothing there, I want to satisfy myself that there -- that I have done everything.",
        "A: Only -- but I -- I did not find the -- the -- the -- they have the burial records from the\nend of the si -- of the time there, when everybody was deported in 1942 -- two and then\nthere\u2019s no one there buried any more until recently. And there are no Jews there now,\nvery few -- very [indecipherable]. So they have a book with the records of the burials and\nI was hoping to find my uncle\u2019s name so I could go to the grave. That was my main\nambition.\nEnd of Tape Two, Side B\nBeginning Tape Three, Side A",
        "A: Oh, oh.",
        "A: Yeah, mm-hm, mm-hm.",
        "A: Well, actually I was writing for some newspapers, so I pushed my nose into every --\neverything there, and said, well, my articles were published in different papers. I have to\nbacktrack then, because there was one experience that I -- I am glad I had in -- in -- ina\nway. When we arrived in Auschwitz, the girls from Selonika had been taken there. Now,\nI had studied, in fi -- in the Filantropine about the Sephardic community and their history,\nsort of. And there they were. And, of course, th -- the -- they were ill fe -- I mean, they\nwere terribly mi -- ill fed and filthy, I mean, just like all the others in Auschwitz and the -\n- the -- the additional problem was that they spoke -- they didn\u2019t speak much -- they\ndidn\u2019t understand Yiddish. Th-Their language was Ladeeno. If -- when they spoke Greek\nand French. They were very, very well educated. The alleance was -- the French schools\nwere teaching them until they were base -- they were multi-lingual and they were\ntalented. Almost everyone -- was -- had a -- was singing and dancing while they still had\ntheir strength, when we first met them. And I made friends with two girls and -- can you\nturn that off for a minute?",
        "A: Well, her name was -- let\u2019s say Mona.",
        "A: That was not her real name [indecipherable] and I don\u2019t want to mention her last name\nbecause family was prominent in -- in Greece.",
        "A: So she -- we made friends. She had -- was -- there was a younger sister. Sister was\nabout a year, year and a half younger. And they thought that their mother had remained in\nSelonika. As it turned out, later on when I met the cousin, he told me that she was\ndeported a day after the girls. But, of course, the girls couldn\u2019t know that. And Mona had\nthis beautiful, beautiful singing voice and she told me that she wou -- wanted to be an\nopera singer. One of the things that the Greek girls sang a lot was Ava Maria. As a matter\nof fact, a few years ago, I was in Israel and -- and Yaffal and I heard Ava Maria played,\nso I went in to follow the sound. There was a young man from Greece pla -- and he\u2019s a\npainter. But he was playing -- I don\u2019t know why they happen to love Ava Maria, which is\nso typically, you know, a Christian and a Catholic -- well, at any rate, while she had her\nstrength, she alwa -- we b-begged her to sing for us and she did. And then Auschwitz, of\ncourse took it\u2019s toll, her sister died. And it was like, oh, all the starch was taken out of\nher. The -- the -- but while she was -- while -- while we -- when we first got there, we\nonly spoke in English. That was the way that we were able to communicate. She spoke\nEnglish and -- but in -- the Nazis didn\u2019t permit anyone to speak English, because they\nknew they were bringing in p-people from France and they had to speak French or\nwhatever other language. But they didn\u2019t have any prisoners from English speaking\nplaces, so, of course it was -- they -- if they had caught us, they would have really beaten\nus up or who knows what. So we -- being young kids, that\u2019s what we enjoyed doing,\nwhile we were still -- still had some strength. So she -- her -- her -- but her sister died and\nshe lost all courage. All -- everything, I mean, was gone from her. And, of course,\neverybody got weaker at the time, so that had something to do with it. And then this SS\nman, Talber, heard -- I think I must have talked about this, he heard that she was -- that\nshe had such a wonderful voice and he wanted her to be his housekeeper. Now, the Nazis\ndidn\u2019t encourage sex between the Germans and others. It was -- would dilute the race and\nit would take it -- whatever. So I don\u2019t know what was on his mind once she would have\nbeen in his home. But she refused. And -- remember, you have to realize what a sacrifice\nshe made. I mean, clean sheets, decent food and water and soap. She refused all of this\nand he made sure that she would not live. So he copied down her number and he made\nsure that with the next selection, she would go. And she did. And then -- I always thought\nof her, because she was this wonderful person and we -- she was a fun person while she\nwas still alright. And when I went to -- a few times we had some Christian friends and I\nwent to weddings and I -- they sing Ava Maria at a wedding and I\u2019m sitting there crying\nand everybod -- they\u2019re saying, \u201cLook at this Jewish woman, crying over Ava Maria.\u201d\nBut it wasn\u2019t because of that, 1t was because I was thinking of my friend, Mona. And I\nwent to Israel for the gathering and very few people from Selonika came. And I found\nout later on that they really being slighted by Yad Vashem and by -- it seems that the\npeople who come from eastern Europe, central Europe, think that they\u2019re the only ones\nwho suffered. And that the people from Greece, ah, couple of Greeks, we didn\u2019t get a --\nthey didn\u2019t get along in Auschwitz when they were there. They were fighting, they were\ndifferent cultures, different -- they didn\u2019t speak the languages and they didn\u2019t get along\ntoo well. So they certainly didn\u2019t get along in -- so then, still not getting along now. And\nYad Vashem is not doing very much for them. I think recently they have -- some of their\npublications have written about the Greek people, but not much. So, there were very few,\nas I said, people from Greece. And -- but when -- in the last night, when Me-Menachim\nBegin spoke and we -- at the wall, someone behind me said that he was from Selonika\nand I turned around -- I mean, there were thousands and thousands of people there, or\nwhatever. I think it must have been thousands. And I turned around and I said I had a\ngood friend from Selonika. And he said, \u201cWell, too bad you don\u2019t know the name.\u201d I\nsaid, \u201cBut I do know the name.\u201d I mentioned it to him. And _ he said, \u201cThere\u2019s a large\nfamily living -- by that name, living in Selonika.\u201d But he didn\u2019t have any address and he\nsaid write to wherever and see if a Jewish community someplace will find it for you. So\nwhen I came back, this was first thing on my mind. I called the federation and they were\nin touch with, you know, ev -- there was so much excitement in the air over that event at\nthe time. They were in touch immediately with the -- a group in Athens. There was no\nlisting for the group in Selonika, but the Athens group finally got me the cousin\u2019s name.\nAnd we corresponded. And we met -- when he came, we met about a year or two\nafterwards. My mother was already very sick and she couldn\u2019t come. She would have\nloved to come. I wanted them to come to our house in Fairlawn, they didn\u2019t want to come\nall the way out. I didn\u2019t want to -- they were staying in Long Island someplace, very far\nup, So we met at the Jewish Theological Seminary. And we met and he -- he kept writing\nme -- kept sending me letters and he sent me the book of a mem -- a memora book of --\nin French, of what happened in -- in -- of -- of the Jews in Selonika. And the very -- but,\nyou know, after awhile, there was nothing to write any more and wi -- and you know, we\nsort of drifted apart. I don\u2019t know what became of them ultimately, but it was a\nwonderful experience meeting up with him. And he is married to a cousin and -- this was\nnow another cousin, but the woman -- her eyes were so much like my friends that I -- it\nwas uncanny and I was -- it was very exciting meeting them.",
        "A: Oh, yes, it was really --",
        "A: Yeah, I -- yo-you hear it right? Do you want anything? [break] I think that happened\nin -- at that gathering. You look at my wall here. These are products of Ethiopian Jews.\nAnd it\u2019s very funny, they take Biblical themes, but they\u2019re all African and all their m --\nthe embroidery is made -- 1-is -- they have the dark faces. It is very interesting to me, but\nwhen we were at -- when we arrived in -- in Jerusalem, I think of -- 1n -- 1n tel -- actually\nit was in Tel Aviv the first night. A group of Ethiopian Jews were singing for us. And I\nbecame fascinated. Of course, I\u2019ve heard the story of the king and -- King David and\nBathsheba and -- or the Queen of Sheba, actually. And they are -- they claim to be the\noffspring, so I became fascinated by the story. And I became very interesting -- interested\nin -- in their work and in their fate, so when the -- there\u2019s a new -- New York association\nfor Ethiopian Jews, I started buying these and now they\u2019ve become collector\u2019s items,\nbecause when everybody -- while they were in Ethiopia, they -- fo-for five dollars a\nmonth, they were -- would embroider and the five dollars a month they could buy and\nfeed themselves. Now, most of them have left, so they don\u2019t do this any more. And in\nIsrael, five dollars a month doesn\u2019t exactly get you somewhere. So they have given up\ndoing this kind of work, but what happened then was, I came back, I kept buying these\nthings and all this is Ethiopian. I have Rosh Hashanah cards and they\u2019re very -- they\u2019re\nvery charming.",
        "A: I love this one with Jonah and the -- and the whale.",
        "A: And this is Moses. This is King David. This is Mirriam. And this is the one -- the\nerotic one. Adam and Eve in the -- in the Garden of Eden. This was the first one, it\u2019s a\nShabbas clock. And I became involved because we had -- my father\u2019s name is mentio --\nis listed -- my sister-in-law, there was a memorial building of some sort. I haven\u2019t seen it,\nbecause I don\u2019t go to Florida. In Florida, she thought I -- I needed something nice. She --\nthat -- I had some -- done something nice for her, so she mentioned my father\u2019s name --\nhad his name listed in the memorial in Florida. Is -- It\u2019s in Yad Vashem and it\u2019s in the\ndifferent museums and everywhere. And our synagogue, when I lived in Fairlawn, again\nmade up a plaque, with the names of the Jews who sa -- didn\u2019t survive. So -- relatives.\nAnd I was sitting with a friend in the synagogue and I said, \u201cI really don\u2019t want this\nagain.\u201d It\u2019s a-another wall and another stone and another memorial. How many should\nthere be? And she said, \u201cYou know, but I know you\u2019ll have to do it and you\u2019ll do it\nanyway, because you\u2019ve been a member of the synagogue for so many years.\u201d And I did,\nshe was right. So, when I went up to the table, I said, \u201cI\u2019m not sure if I should call it Isaac\nor Ithzak.\u201d And someone in back of me said, \u201cWell then, call him Irving.\u201d And I said,\n\u201cWell, how -- wha -- how does Irving get to my father?\u201d And I don\u2019t even remember\nwhat I put down, if it was Isaac or Ithzak. And I said, \u201cNow that\u2019s it. They can approach\nme all they want, I have to do something living -- for the living.\u201d And the only way I can\nhonor my father is by real, living things. So I -- for a year -- two years, I adopted a -- an\nEthiopian girl. She was a -- she was a maid. But I enabled her to go to dental school. She\ndidn\u2019t become a dentist, but she became a dental hygienist and it\u2019s much better than\nscrubbing floors, I guess. And I\u2019m still involved with Ethiopians. The only thing was\nthen, someone approached me and I became -- and I went on to became a -- a member of\nthe Board of Overseers for the Rabbinic school for the Jewish Theological Seminary.\nTook all my energy and money, so I gave up a little bit on Ethiopians. Personally, I think\nthat it\u2019s probably equally important to support the Ethiopians, even when there\u2019s already\nin Israel. So that\u2019s why I have all these Ethiopian things hanging there.",
        "A: Oh well, I had relatives and they didn\u2019t believe what we -- our experiences, so after a\nfew attempts to explain it, we didn\u2019t tell them any more. And what they wanted was --\nwhat they thought we should be was like servants to them. I mean, tha-that\u2019s -- was the\nthing, you know, I mean we were definitely inferior.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, because Europe had a bad reputation over there -- everybody thought\nEurope 1s still the shtatel from -- and we came out of the shtatel from the 19 -- 1800\u2019s or\nsomething like that. And that\u2019s why we should -- that was my experience, though there\nmust have been other experiences that were much better. Mine was not -- and even --\neven my mother-in-law felt this way. And my -- there was someone -- we were look --\nwhen we were looking for a house, there was someo -- a house in Elmwood Park that was\nan old house, very crummy. And we were looking for houses, this was not what we were\nlooking for. But this old -- my mother-in-law\u2019s friend sent us over and just out of\ncourtesy we went and we came back and we said, \u201cWe don\u2019t want it.\u201d So, it was, Ruth\ndoesn\u2019t want it. It wasn\u2019t just that Harry doesn\u2019t want it, but Ruth doesn\u2019t want it. And\nwhen we -- when I said this, the woman said, \u201cOh, in Europe it was better?\u201d In other\nwords, I was very ungrateful that I didn\u2019t grab, you know, this old house there. And this\nis always -- I mean, 1n Europe, because most people don\u2019t have the experience of the\nJews living in Germany, which was what they th-think of is Annatefka. And, you know,\nthey -- they -- \u201cFiddler on the Roof\u201d type of village where -- with the chickens running\nand the ducks in the street and all -- and the mud in the road and they think that\u2019s what it\nhad to be. And one of the other things that I always heard was that all Jews in Germany\nwere -- they were not Jewish any more. And this was always cu -- this was -- it -- it hurt\nme because I just told you how -- that the cities -- everybody was kosher, everybody kept\nShabbas. That was in my town, it might have been different in -- in other towns. But this\n-- these -- these criticisms came from people who doing everything on Shabbas, who\nnever -- who didn\u2019t care if they eat -- ate kosher or not, didn\u2019t teach their children\nanything Jewish, but they were able to criticize Jews from Germany. So 1-it was -- it was\nvery difficult. It wasn\u2019t -- 1t wa -- it was not too great an experience. I mean, yes, there\nwere p-people who were very kind and there was -- when I worked in the hospital there\nwas one doctor, very well known dermatologist who wanted to take off my number and I\ndidn\u2019t want to.

I had given them a belt that when I came to Auschwitz -- when, after we were\nshaved and -- and everything, they handed me a skirt that was way too big and someone\ngave me a blue felt belt with flowers on it and I used it t-to hold the bel -- the skirt up and\nthe belt -- I -- I kept losing weight, of course, wh-when we were there. And my mother\nkept saying, \u201cOh, poor Ruth, look at this, oh.\u201d Then I kept telling here, \u201cYou know, it\u2019s\nnot that I\u2019m losing weight. It\u2019s the belt that\u2019s stretching. That\u2019s why it\u2019s -- it looks loose.\u201d\nSo, I rolled -- 1t was made of felt and I was able to roll 1t up and 1t went with me wherever\nI went. I took 1t with me when we ca-came to the United States. And then I -- w-we -- I\nwas moving at the same time that the ha -- museum was looking for things.

So, because of that -- I guess because of that and I ha-had promised them I\nwould give them m-my story, I went to -- I was invited to the opening and my daughter-\nin-law and two of her children are in their four -- they have four children, but two of her\nchildren went to -- the other two were too small, we went to the opening. And my\ngrandchildren are very, very affected, much too much.

So she is very\naware of the Holocaust, but even my two children who go to public schools, here in West\nOrange, my two grandchildren are now aware of it and of course it -- they need to be\naware of it. My son 1s very angry because he feels he doesn\u2019t have an extended family.\nThey have one cousin in -- in Toronto, but there were many cousins and -- and aunts that\n[ -- that were killed.

I\u2019m -- I think it -- even my point in -- in lecturing 1s that -- to prevent this kind\nof thing. Not just pr -- to prevent it for -- for Jews. Of course it\u2019s primarily -- the\nHolocaust was against the Jews and my main interest 1s that it -- nothing should happen\nto Jews, but it\u2019s very easy to glide into a situation, be seduced by some crazy person like\nHitler again, for another people.

We didn\u2019t realize how\ndevastated Russia was, but to us 1t seemed like they were threatening the whole world. So\nwherever there was Communism, we were sure that we wanted t-to -- that I wanted it not\nto exist, because I didn\u2019t, whe -- it was Stalinism, it wasn\u2019t the 19th century Socialism.\nSo, this kind of terrible behavior. I -- I -- I mean the things that went on against people of\nall kinds, in Russia, we -- we wanted Communism to -- so, when -- I was not against\nstopping -- I mean, not for stopping the Civil War -- the -- oh, I\u2019m keeps going -- the\nVietnam War. I read something about Civil War last night, I guess it\u2019s still on my mind.\nAnd so that was -- but the Civil Rights movement is another -- was another thing.

And they told me this and I couldn\u2019t understand that. Why would\nanyone not treat another human being the same way as they wanted to be treated, but\napparently that\u2019s what it was. So I was very upset over that, I was very affected.

And I couldn\u2019t -- I didn\u2019t want -- I -- I -- my main\nmotivation was that I didn\u2019t want her to hur -- be hurt and I didn\u2019t want her to start crying\nand I think that\u2019s why I s -- never brought it up.",
        "A: And I n -- I need this -- I -- you know. What I missed with my father most was when I\nwent to college. I wen -- I\u2019m a -- I\u2019m always talking about my father an-and I miss him\nterribly. And I miss not having ha -- had him. But what I really missed, I was thinking of\nin college, because when I took all these philosophers, I couldn\u2019t tell Plato and Socrates\nand -- and Aristotle apart. That was my father\u2019s field. He would have loved and I would\nhave loved to have studied this and to have him discuss this.",
        "A: Well, no, he di -- he st --",
        "A: Yeah. It was a -- like -- you know, that was his thing.",
        "A: But he -- he could talk about everything, because he was a real expert on music and\nreal expert on writing and he just knew everything.",
        "A: Oh.",
        "A: Yeah sure. First of all, I took some courses. I was hoping to get a doctorate in Jewish\nhistory and I took some courses at the Jewish Theological Seminary. But what I -- what\nhappened then, I was involved with the building and all kinds of other things and I have\nstopped taking the courses. I\u2019m hoping to somehow pick this up, maybe one of these\nyears, if I live, to get a Ph.D. in Jewish history, because I love that aspect. But I am\nwriting, finally, everybody -- my sons are after me, write your biography and I am\nwriting it. I think it\u2019s not your own reaction, it\u2019s not emotional enough. I --",
        "A: Oh, but I am writing and I -- I\u2019m starting out with my -- with the letter that I had about\nmy uncle. And then I\u2019m tracing back what -- the experiences and I want to eventually\nwork up, but in the meantime, I\u2019m also bringing in the history of the Jews in Germany --\nin Frankfort, actually. And it -- I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s the right approach, but that\u2019s what\nI\u2019m doing. And I\u2019m hoping to get it to -- I -- I should really s -- buckle down and really\nstart writing on it, instead of a few lines at a time.",
        "A: No, I -- I\u2019ve really actually gone back to -- to the 1100\u2019s. But -- to the ghetto. But, you\nknow, I -- only a few sentences, I mean, I really know the -- the history of the ghetto and\nthe writing -- all the things that -- but I\u2019m -- I don\u2019t -- I\u2019m not writing that. I want to write\nabout -- I just wondered -- what I\u2019m really showing is that there was a lot of anti-\nSemitism from the beginning. Goldhagen\u2019s ideas. But also -- and Jewish historians have\nneglected to do this for a long time, 1s that everybody made a bridge from one destruction\n-- from one burning, from the -- you know, they -- there were the laws against Jews and\nthen there was the Inquisition and then there was a -- before that was the Black Death and\n-- and then the Inquisition and -- and then and -- and other things in between and you had\nthe Nazis. And no one really, seriously, for a long time -- and the Hebrew teachers did\nthis -- mentioned all the wonderful th -- things that Jews did on their own. The\nscholarship and the Jewish organizations. I mean the -- this is not something from now,\nthis is something from -- from out of need, that happened in medieval times, even before.\nAnd so I want to bring this -- I want to sh -- bring some of that in, but only in a few\nsentences, because, as I said, I\u2019m not writing a history of -- of J-Jews, I\u2019m writing a -- my\n-- my biography.",
