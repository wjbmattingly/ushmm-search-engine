        "Question: Well, this morning we are conducting an interview with Ada Gens Ustjanauskas and\nfollowing her life story. Thank you very, very much, Mrs. Ustjanauskas for coming and talking\nto us. This is going to be a very broad story with many different components, and many different\npeople who are in it. It will be a -- a glimpse into at least what happened with one person in a\nvery tough part of the world, in Lithuania. And I would like to start, as we often do, at the very\nbeginning. I\u2019d like to find out about your background, where you were born, the family you were\nborn into, the details about your early life. So let us start with that. Where were you born?",
        "Answer: Smalininkai. Smalininkai.",
        "Q: And 1s that a village or a town?",
        "A: I would call it a little town.",
        "Q: And where is it close to?",
        "A: It\u2019s close -- it\u2019s on the German border. My birth certificate is in German and in Lithuanian. It\nwas like a style in those days, you had a baby born in Germany, and my mother was on the way\nto Germany. Right on the border, I was born. She didn\u2019t make it to the German border, but as I\nsay, my birth certificate is both in German and in Lithuanian. So we have no idea about\nSmalininkai, we didn\u2019t live there. She just happened to be traveling through.",
        "Q: And your birth date 1s?",
        "A: October 9, 1926.",
        "Q: And where was your mother coming from?",
        "A: At that time my father was teaching in the high school, Jewish high school in Jurbarkas.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: That\u2019s where she came from, from Jurbarkas to have me in Germany.",
        "Q: Can you tell me a little bit about -- first of all, Smalininkai was still a Lithuanian territory\nvillage or town, 1s that correct?",
        "A: Border town.",
        "Q: It was a border town --",
        "A: Border town.",
        "Q: -- but it did not belong to Germany\u201d?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Okay. And was it -- can you tell me a little bit about the -- the border was to what part of\nGermany?",
        "A: Prussy?",
        "Q: Prussia.",
        "A: Prussia.",
        "Q: Prussia, okay. Then let\u2019s go back to Jurbarkas. What did -- what kind of a place was that?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s a town. I was rem -- I remember being there with high school for literary\ncompetition, I believe. It was a small town in Lithuania, not a big town.",
        "Q: Was it close to Kaunas?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Was it close to [indecipherable] city? No?",
        "A: No, no, no. We -- I remember we took a river boat to go to Jurbarkas.",
        "Q: So you don\u2019t have any memories of --",
        "A: No, none whatsoever.",
        "Q: Okay. Tell me a little bit about your earliest memories.",
        "A: Kaunas.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Father was attending -- at the same time he was teaching, he was attending university, and the\nonly way of communication at that time was taking a riverboat. It was too strenuous, too long. So\nhe decided to move to Kaunas to attend his studies. So, what I remember first, I remember my\nkindergarten. And in those days, what was known in -- not known in United States, but it was\nvery well known in Lithuania, Montessori system kindergarten.",
        "Q: Oh, you were in the Montessori system?",
        "A: Montessori system, and the person who had -- who was the leading person was Professor\n[indecipherable].",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: She started that. From the Montessori, I went to German kindergarten. And when my mother\nbrought me to school to enter me into the first grade and they checked my abilities, they told my\nmother that, you know, your child doesn\u2019t belong in first grade. In first grade we use matches to\ncount. Your daughter can write and read and count. We should put her into second grade, but she\nis too young, she is only four and a half years old. So --",
        "Q: So what did they do?",
        "A: -- to make a long story short, I finish high school at 14 and a half. I jumped three years in the\nmeantime. I never discuss it because it\u2019s not very believable and there were only two cases in\nLithuania. One was Kutraga, Dr. Kutraga\u2019s son, he was 15 and a half, I was 14 and a half. But\nwhen we came to United States, it just happened that the principal of my high school and my\nfirst teacher lived in Hartford. I never talked about myself, but they told everybody. So they s --\nthis is no mystery any more, you know, no secret any more. So --",
        "Q: But you went from Montessori school to a German kindergarten?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: We\u2019ll come to your schooling in a little while --",
        "A: Now --",
        "Q: -- I'd like to come back to that. But your first memories are of this Montessori school.",
        "A: Yeah, that\u2019s right.",
        "Q: Do you have any picture in your mind of --",
        "A: Oh yes, I remember. I remember, for example, during the bell, we were too small, there was a\nlittle wooden block, we could stop the -- step on the block, ring the bell by ourselves. We were to\nbe -- to take our clothes -- coats by ourselves, hang it on a peg, the pegs were lower. Everything\nwe had to do ourselves, and I don\u2019t remember too much about the activities, I just remember that\nI hated to drink cocoa because it had a skin of milk on the top. That I remember very well. So,\nwe\u2019re coming now to the school.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Elementary school.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: They told my mother that they are a little bit worried that at my age I\u2019Il start, but the-they told\nher, don\u2019t worry, 1f we see that she 1s falling behind, we\u2019ll just very naturally, gradually put her\nback, one year backwards. Well, it never came to that. So I finished second grade, I finished third\ngrade, and then I took exams to high school.",
        "Q: And this was you were still in the German school?",
        "A: No, that was already Mariya Peckauskaite gymnasium.",
        "Q: So that was a Lithuanian school.",
        "A: It was a Lithuanian school. It was private.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Expensive, and I went through it. Now, after I took the exams to first class, I continued at that\nschool. In Lithuanian language it was called pono gymnasium.",
        "Q: Pono?",
        "A: Pono.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. And how would you translate that?",
        "A: Well, we had the children of -- our cabinet minister\u2019s children, heads of department children,\nchildren of very rich people.",
        "Q: So, the elite?",
        "A: Elite, yeah.",
        "Q: The elite.",
        "A: Elite, yeah.",
        "Q: So it wasn\u2019t the of-official name of the school --",
        "A: No, it was not official --",
        "Q: -- it was the unofficial name of the school.",
        "A: -- it was unofficial name of the school. In those days the government high schools, were\ncharging 100 litas per year. In our school it was 400. So not everybody was able to afford it.",
        "Q: Let me take -- stop at that moment for a moment, because that begs a lot of questions, and\nthen we\u2019ll go back a little bit.",
        "A: All right.",
        "Q: And th -- because the question, the first one is, how is it your family could afford it? And then\nthe question that comes after that is, who was your family? So let\u2019s go back to mother and father.\nCan you tell me a little bit about your mother? Who she was, where she was born, what her name\nwas, what her family was like. And the same then for your father.",
        "A: Mama\u2019s father left Lithuania during the Tsar\u2019s occupation. We don\u2019t know too much, we just\nknow that in those years, the Tsar used to send people for bringing illegal literature, from\nGermany, from Prussia to Lithuania. And many people tried to escape when they knew that it\ncame close to being arrested, they es -- mostly escaped either to United States, or to South\nAmerica. He left Lithuania and he settled in Montevideo, Uruguay.",
        "Q: How many brothers and sisters did she have?",
        "A: She had one sister and two brothers. After awhile her father took the youngest brother to\nMontevideo, Uruguay, and a sister and a brother stayed in Lithuania.",
        "Q: She was born when?",
        "A: Mama was born 1900.",
        "Q: And her name was?",
        "A: El-Elvera.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. And her last name?",
        "A: Boudraker. Boudrakiter.",
        "Q: Uh-huh, so Elvera Boudraker --",
        "A: Boudra -- Boudrakiter in Lithuanian, Boudraker that she used here.",
        "Q: Was she the youngest, the oldest?",
        "A: She was the oldest. She was the oldest. What I know about Mama; Mama finished again an\nelite high school in Riga, Latvia.",
        "Q: How could that be afforded if her father had left her mother with four -- three, four children\nand -- and had -- and had gone to Montevideo? How could the family afford --",
        "A: 1900\u2019s were Tsar\u2019s time.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Tsar\u2019s time. And it was call -- called Liktroich it\u2019s a famous high school. Mama was fluent,\nbut I mean really fluent in French, German, Russian, Polish and Lithuanian. And when the war\nstarted --",
        "Q: Which war?",
        "A: First World War. She was working with famous Polish refugee committee. Must be in 717 -\n18, around that time.",
        "Q: Back in Lithuania?",
        "A: Back in they -- that was still, I believe, in Riga.",
        "Q: In Latvia.",
        "A: In Latvia.",
        "Q: Well, excuse me, I must go back to the other question.",
        "A: Yeah?",
        "Q: When you say it was the Tsar\u2019s time, nevertheless, she is a girl who comes from a family and\nwe don\u2019t know what kept that family going financially.",
        "A: I can\u2019t answer. I don\u2019t know whether the grandfather used to send something or not, tha -- I\nreally have no idea. But they must have had means.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Because that -- that particular high school was like my high school, was elite high school and\nsomehow they managed.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Now, because she worked in that famous Polish refugee commi -- assistance committee, that\nactually what later helped us to get to the west, that fact. Anyway, when Mama returned to\nLithuania, she started to work for our government.",
        "Q: That means the --",
        "A: Lithuanian nu -- new --",
        "Q: Independent --",
        "A: -- independent government which was forming in those days. I have a very interesting picture\nof the -- maybe about 40 males and my mother, a lone female sitting in the middle, which --\nwhich we received from a person who was deported to Siberia and handed a picture to my\nmother\u2019s nephew, who was serving in ri -- Soviet army. Anyway, Mama worked all these years\nduring the formation of Lithuania and that\u2019s where she met my father.",
        "Q: That was one of my questions.",
        "A: That\u2019s where she met my father. They were fighting. It was, if you know, Shirvintu Yedraichu\nBaras. That\u2019s the place where the biggest fights for independence were taking place.",
        "Q: In what years would you say? Was that 1918, or --",
        "A: 1918 --",
        "Q: 1918.",
        "A: -- yeah, 1918. This was if you -- if you not familiar with Lithuanian history, at that time we\nhad to fight the [indecipherable] army, the Bermontas Soviet army, the Polish army, and we had\nfront on three sides. The f-famous battles of Shirvintu Yedraichu were the most difficult to\nconduct over there. That\u2019s -- that\u2019s where the officers were sent for a couple of days, like we call\nin this country for recreation. To relax couple of days and go back to the front. That\u2019s where she\nmet my father.",
        "Q: So he is now introduced into the picture.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Can you tell us a little bit about him, his family, where he was born and so on?",
        "A: My grandmother on father\u2019s side had five sons. No daughters, just five sons. Youngest one\ndied in his infancy and the four sons grew up. Papa was born in a farming village called\n[llovieciai, [indecipherable] not too far from the city of Siauliai.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Was he the youngest, the oldest?",
        "A: He was the oldest one.",
        "Q: And what year was he born?",
        "A: One asa -- 1903.",
        "Q: So he was younger than your mother?",
        "A: Three years.",
        "Q: I see. And his name was?",
        "A: Jacobus.",
        "Q: Jacobus. And his --",
        "A: I\u2019m not used to this Jacob Gens and somebody. Was always Jacobus Gensus.",
        "Q: I see. And his brothers, what were their names?",
        "A: Next one was Salavonus Gensus.",
        "Q: Salomon? Solomon?",
        "A: Yes. Next one was Ephraimus. We used to call him Froizim, it\u2019s shorter.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And the fourth one was Rudunus. Rufka.",
        "Q: Reuben.",
        "A: Reuben.",
        "Q: What kind of a family was this? What was their -- how did they make their living?",
        "A: All I know, that while the grandfather was not too sick, he was -- he had very, very bad\nasthma. Until that time he was trading with -- what do you call it? [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Trading crabs? I don\u2019t underst -- it was --",
        "A: Something -- the small ones.",
        "Q: Oh yeah, little crabs.",
        "A: Little crabs, right.",
        "Q: So it was some sort of seafood?",
        "A: He sold some sort of seafood.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And that was a big enterprise.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: But the --",
        "Q: It\u2019s interesting cause it\u2019s not a -- not anywhere near the ocean.",
        "A: Well, but you know they -- somehow they managed to bring it in.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: All I remember, that twice a year I would stay two weeks each for Christmas and two wits --\nweeks each for Easter in Shonay --",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: -- with my grandparents. But at that time already grandfather did not leave the bed.",
        "Q: So he was ill.",
        "A: He was very ill. It was a very -- how should I say, normal Lithuanian family. Both\ngrandparents were blonde, blue-eyed. Neither one looked Jewish.",
        "Q: But it was a Jewish family.",
        "A: Jewish family, right.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: All sons attended Lithuanian schools, all sons attended Lithuanian universities and it was, to\nthem it was a n -- normal thing. They felt Lithuanian.",
        "Q: Was it a religious family?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: And do you know why\u201d Do yo -- would -- did that question ever come up as to why it was not\na particularly religious family?",
        "A: The question never was an issue, because my mother\u2019s family was n-neither. So --",
        "Q: So both -- and your mother\u2019s family was what -- what -- what would have been her religious\nbackground, had it been a religious one?",
        "A: Oh, a Roman Catholic.",
        "Q: A Roman Catholic.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: So, in other words, your mother was Roman Catholic, your father Jewish, but neither was --",
        "A: Jewish, and there was no clash, no, not at all.",
        "Q: Not -- and -- but there was also no great adherence to --",
        "A: To -- to one anoth --",
        "Q: -- one another\u2019s traditions.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: I see --",
        "A: They never changed religions. There was never a conversation, would you get baptized or\nwould you accept ju -- Judaism, never, never. And I was left alone. They never pushed me into\none direction or the other. In those days in Lithuania, all our birth certificates were religious.\nMine was not. I had the German birth certificate. It was like we didn\u2019t have civil -- Lithuania\ndidn\u2019t have any civil ceremonies, only --",
        "Q: But it see --",
        "A: -- only religious ones.",
        "Q: But it is am -- it is an interesting kind of irony, if you were born in a border town that is still\nwithin the territory of the state of Lithuania, yet your birth certificate is in German --",
        "A: German --",
        "Q: -- and it\u2019s civil.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: It\u2019s a little bit strange. Something --",
        "A: It\u2019s -- it is strange.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: You don\u2019t have it usually, because it -- today you could -- you don\u2019t have it in Lithuania any\nmore, it\u2019s not that the church gives you birth certificate. Today it -- you go to city hall and get it.\nBut in those days Lithuania didn\u2019t have it. So that\u2019s why I escaped all that, you know, big issue.\nIt never bothered me, and it never bothered my paper -- parents.",
        "Q: So you didn\u2019t -- you didn\u2019t go to any Catholic religious --",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: -- classes, you never went to any --",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: -- Jewish classes.",
        "A: We had -- we had -- we had the acr -- rabbi, we had the Lutheran and we had the Orthodox\nand we have Roman Catholic priests teaching at the high school. The -- quite a few of us stayed\naway from religious -- not only Jewish children who were in school, but also the -- we had some\nOrthodox, we had some of a -- Lutherans, who didn\u2019t attend either. So we just spent that hour,\nyou know, waiting outside.",
        "Q: Oh, so you\u2019re saying in the public schools, there was a li -- religious class, is that ri --",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "Q: And whatever religion you happened to belong to --",
        "A: You had to -- you -- you -- if you wanted, you had --",
        "Q: Did your parents tell you the story of how they met? Did you ever learn --",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "Q: Okay, so tell us the story of how they met.",
        "A: It -- I ha -- I remember Mama telling that my father approached her, and she had -- she didn\u2019t\nknow him at all, and she was kind of trying to -- not get rid of him, but tried not to get into a\nconversation, there was -- there was no proper introduction or anything. And he was very\npersistent. She had no idea about his nationality or his religion or anything. And somehow --\nsomehow they started to date. I know only one thing, that at that time my father was engaged.\nAnd Mama only told me that she remembers looking through the window, seeing grandmother\ncome to that place where h-he was stationed at that time.",
        "Q: His mother?",
        "A: His mother. And she -- he told her la -- later on that she was trying to persuade him to drop --\nsee -- whoever he is seeing and come back to Siauliai when he\u2019ll be able and to stay with his\nfianc\u00e9. She did not persuade him. I don\u2019t know Mama\u2019s year of marriage, but if I was born in\n26, probably must have been married somewhere around \u201924 - \u201923. You see, in those days, in\nLithuania, I think in the entire country, you couldn\u2019t count to 10 to find mixed marriages. It was\nvery, very unusual. It was even worse than in those days in United States if you had a black and\nwhite marriage. It was unheard of.",
        "Q: So this is --",
        "A: It was unheard of. I think what -- what make my mother decide to -- to do it, first of all, I\nwould describe him as -- not as a Jew in Lithuania, but a Lithuanian of Jewish extraction.",
        "Q: Is that how she saw him?",
        "A: No, she saw him who he is, but I mean, that made it easier to get into the marriage.",
        "Q: For her?",
        "A: For her, I think so.",
        "Q: And for him?",
        "A: For him? They were not religious people, so that didn\u2019t mean anything. And what they did,\nthey also have a German marriage certificate. They did the same thing when I was born, but by\ncoincidence over there, they did the same thing --",
        "Q: So where did they marry?",
        "A: They married also on the border, with a German document. So they didn\u2019t have to use either\nreligion for their marriage certificate.",
        "Q: So it was a civil ceremony?",
        "A: Civil ceremony. Lithuania didn\u2019t have it. That eliminated changing the religions, either this or\nthat, and so we lived happily ever after.",
        "Q: But let me get back to this a little bit. Even if the families were not particularly religious, and\nyour parents were not particularly li -- religious, you mentioned that your paternal grandmother\nhad tried to dissuade your father from marrying your mother.",
        "A: Yes, but his fianc\u00e9 was also Lithuanian.",
        "Q: Oh, I see.",
        "A: So that -- that was not an issue of religion, that was an issue, don\u2019t drop --",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Don\u2019t drop the first one.",
        "A: Yeah. Mm-hm.",
        "Q: And were -- were your parents accepted by the in-laws?",
        "A: Absolutely. Absolutely. My father\u2019s -- my grandfather on Father\u2019s side adored my mother.\nAdored. I mean, exactly in the word, adored my mother. Mama helped to put his brothers\nthrough universities. Mama took them in. They stayed a long time with us. And on Mother\u2019s side\nthere was exactly the same situation. Exactly the same situation. You mentioned before my\nfather\u2019s brother. My mother\u2019s brother found my father\u2019s brother in Vilnius on the street. That\u2019s\nhow we got in touch. So it\u2019s -- it\u2019s a -- they were very close. Both families were very close.",
        "Q: I\u2019m a little confused about this incident of finding one another on the street. At what year are\nyou talking about?",
        "A: They went 40 -- what is it, 40 -- 40-something? When he came from Vorkuta.",
        "Q: Oh, you\u2019re [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: Okay, so you\u2019re talking about after the war now --",
        "A: After the war, right, yeah.",
        "Q: -- where they found one another. Let\u2019s still stay in the 1920\u2019s, and did you know your\nmaternal grandmother?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And so you spent time with your mother\u2019s side of the family as well as your father\u2019s side of\nthe family?",
        "A: Well, my mother\u2019s side of the family was in Kaunas.",
        "Q: Ah, okay.",
        "A: Yeah. It\u2019s only my father family who was in Siauliai.",
        "Q: All right. So you moved from Jurbarkas to Kaunas --",
        "A: To Kaunas.",
        "Q: -- with your father --",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: -- as he finished his studies.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: All right, so he was -- he was going to university as you were growing up.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Okay. What was -- are there any memories of your childhood with your greater family\ntogether, with your -- with your grandparents, with your uncles, with your aunts, anything that\nyou can ti -- that you remember, that sticks out?",
        "A: Well, during the Easter break, my father\u2019s family always had a Seder. Even so, the youngest\nuncle couldn\u2019t stop laughing during the ceremony, but it was there. I remember big, big crates of\nmatzo, silver dishes which were stored from year to year, I remember that.",
        "Q: So you participated?",
        "A: Oh absolutely. Absolutely. During Christmas, I remember that their neighbors had all this\nvery big Christmas celebration, they were Lithuanians. So I spent a lot of time for Christmas\nwith the neighbors who had children my own age. Otherwise I just loved going to Siauliai to be\npampered by three uncles and grandparents.",
        "Q: And your uncles were younger? They were all younger brothers of your father?",
        "A: They were younger brothers. When I was finishing attending last years of high school, the\nyoungest brother was a student in Belgium. So the age difference was not such a shocking one,\nyeah.",
        "Q: Okay. Well, thank you, we will go to the --\nEnd of Tape One\nBeginning Tape Two",
        "Q: Well, it\u2019s unusual. It\u2019s -- it\u2019s unusual what you describe, because there is a certain irony, or\nlet\u2019s say contradiction. On the one hand, in your family, both your very nuclear family of your\nmother and your father, and then the larger, extended family, you say that there was a great deal\nof closeness and that the in-laws liked the other partner very, very much.",
        "A: That\u2019s correct.",
        "Q: But in the larger society, you\u2019re saying you could count on the fingers of -- of both hands how\nmany couples were in mixed marriages. So how do you explain that? How do you explain th-th-\nthey got on so well within, but were in an environment that was very unlikely?",
        "A: Well, there is a -- two words in Lithuanian terminology. The words are Savanoris-Kurejas.\nThese are the people who fought for Lithuanian\u2019s independence and put Lithuania on the map.\nThese people were privileged society. We had privileges. For example, if I would have chosen to\ngo to a high school, free. My conservatory, music, was free. My ballet school, state ballet school,\nwas free. They were given as many privileges as they could. Papa was one of the officers\u2019 corps,\nwho fought at the f -- with the famous first pulkas regiment, probably. They were one for all, all\nfor one.",
        "Q: So he was a Savanoris-Kurejas?",
        "A: Yes, was Savanoris-Kurejas, absolutely.",
        "Q: And what is the literal translation of those words?",
        "A: A volunteer -- oh, kurejas is -- e -- it doesn\u2019t sound in -- in English it doesn\u2019t make any sense.\nHere we understand volunteer army. They -- they were volunteers. They put their books in high\nschool, they went to fight.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: They went to fight for the country.",
        "Q: Were there --",
        "A: So he was accepted in the society as one of those volunteer fighters for Lithuanian\nindependence, without any attachment of religion. And that officer\u2019s corps, that solidarity that --\nwith the officers, later on proved how the solidarity worked between them.",
        "Q: I see. I see, so that was one of the reasons why your -- you were able to attend more elite\nschools as you were growing up, as you said, and -- and have some privileges, because of that.",
        "A: Well, I didn\u2019t use privileges for the free high school.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: University was free, also. Even so, the other university students had to pay. All these\nvolunteer fighters had privileges for their family. I didn\u2019t use it. I just used it for the conservatory\nand for the ballet school, but I didn\u2019t use it for the high school, and I was too young to use it for\nuniversity.",
        "Q: How is it that your father came to join the army and take part in this -- in these battles? What\nwas the ethos, what was the -- the motivation that propelled him?",
        "A: I think it had to start with his parents. My grandmother Lithuanian was very strange dialect.\nWe don\u2019t talk in towns in that dialect. It\u2019s a dialect --",
        "Q: Your Jewish grandmother, you\u2019re talking about?",
        "A: My Jewish grandmother, yes. In translation we would call it lowlands, Zemaitji, or it\u2019s\nnormally, in geographical sense, it\u2019s called Samogitia. She came from part of Lithuania closer to\nthe Baltic Sea. And naturally we understand them, but they have a very heavy accent. Which 1s\nvery pretty, by the way. And my grandmother, my father\u2019s mother, taught me all old Lithuanian\nsongs. All Lithuanian folklore things. It was I got from my father\u2019s mother. My mother\u2019s mother,\nagain, came from St. Petersburg and Riga. She was not so much engrossed in Lithuanian, you\nknow, language and so on. Everything I have, it\u2019s from my father\u2019s mother.",
        "Q: That\u2019s th -- also unusual.",
        "A: That\u2019s very unusual, but you see, that\u2019s -- that\u2019s what it is. I am the product of two -- two lenk\n-- two nationalities, two religions and I fit and -- in here, and I fit in here.",
        "Q: Were your grandparents though -- outside of your family, your lo -- your nuclear and your\nextended family, did your parents, or did you experience any kind of prejudice? Any kind of\ndifficulties? Anything that made it awkward, that there was this Jewish Lithuanian union and that\nyou were the child of it. Did they experience anti-Semitism?",
        "A: They or me?",
        "Q: Both.",
        "A: Neither. Neither. The only first time in 1942, I had a very good voice and the conductor in\nVilnius in the symphony -- what we had in Vilnius, we had a musical outfit, I -- if I would know\nthe name -- anyway, I joined the choir and the conductor was my music teacher in high school,\nand couple of days after we had rehearsals he met me on the street and he said, Ada, don\u2019t come\nany more. I was told who you are. So be careful, and don\u2019t come in any more.",
        "Q: And this is during the war --",
        "A: That -- that -- during the war.",
        "Q: When there\u2019s already a ghetto --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- in Vilnius. I see.",
        "A: Yeah, that was the first time that I experienced somebody telling that.",
        "Q: But during your growing up years, before the war --",
        "A: Never, never.",
        "Q: Did it -- when you were with Lithuanians though, not Jewish Lithuanians, but Lithuanians,\ndid you hear any kind of -- general kind of anecdotes or -- or sayings, or ways that would\ndiminish, let\u2019s say, somebody who was Jewish?",
        "A: You know what? The class of people that I attended the school with, was above it.",
        "Q: I see. So you say it -- it did exist, but not in the milieu that -- your circle --",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: -- you were in.",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Okay. Did your parents ever talk about such things, about any difficulties that they might\nhave heard of, or any things that were harder for them to take because they were -- they had\nmade other decisions?",
        "A: No. What helped a lot probably, is that Father always worked for Lithuanian institutions,\n[indecipherable] Ministeria, Minister of Justice. And then Lietukis, the organization -- do you\nknow what Lietukis is?",
        "Q: Tell us.",
        "A: Okay. It\u2019s an organ -- it\u2019s a association of Lithuanian co-ops. It was all over the country.\nEvery little town, every village had a co-op. And that outfit had in their hands entire import and\nentire export of the country.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: It just so happened that my father was in the imports of oil, gas and my husband was in the\nother part of lithua -- export from Lithuania. It\u2019s just a coincidence. So he always worked with\nLithuania and France, and with -- he was always in that atmosphere.",
        "Q: There are articles that are now appearing in -- in Lithuania that explore, for want of a better\nway of putting it, the rise of anti-Semitism in the 1930\u2019s in the country. And a number of these\narticles talk about comp -- competition and a competitive kind of conflict of interest between\norganizations such as Lietukis and inde -- whether they would be Jewish independent\n[indecipherable] --",
        "A: That\u2019s correct.",
        "Q: -- companies and so on.",
        "A: Absolutely correct.",
        "Q: Can you tell us a little bit about that?",
        "A: I can\u2019t tell you too, too much, but I know that my father tried to introduce Lietukis to his\nJewish -- to the people who had business in their hands, people who were Jewish. He was trying\nto explain that this is the country you\u2019re in, let\u2019s move more towards a Lithuanian site, doing\nbusiness with Lithuanians. And you see, this is again in answer to your question did he ever feel,\nhe was trying to get the -- to get the Jewish merchants take more merchandise from Lietukis. He\nwas very much against using Russian language in Lithuan -- in Jewish society. He was very\nmuch against. He traveled all over Lithuania during the fin -- Finnish Soviet war, giving lectures",
        "Q: In 1939.",
        "A: -- right, giving lectures about the [indecipherable] Mannerheim\u2019s fight with the Soviets. And\nfrom his side, he didn\u2019t see himself as a Jew, he saw himself as a Lithuanian patriot, when you\n[indecipherable] those people.",
        "Q: And did he talk about what kind of reaction this type -- these efforts were having? Did he\nmake headroad? Were there -- were there some of his Jewish colleagues or friends who were not\npart of Lietukis who accepted it, or did he talk about what his experiences were?",
        "A: Well, it wasn\u2019t easy to persuade. You know, the merchant is a merchant and they have their\nlocal how do you -- how would say it, local ways. But he managed, he managed to pull quite a\nfew to buy from Lietukis. That what it was, buy from Lietukis. My father was an expert, he\npublished a book which Mama was afraid to -- to keep around when the Soviets came, about the\nall kind of merchandise in connection with oils and gas. Everything connect -- 1n connection with\nthat area. And that was his last work, absolutely. So that\u2019s -- that\u2019s all I can tell you. And he was\nthe only Jewish person in the entire country in Lietukis, the only one.",
        "Q: And why would you think that was?",
        "A: Because nobody regarded him as a Jew.",
        "Q: So if they ha-had regarded him as a Jew, he wouldn\u2019t have been accepted?",
        "A: But he wa -- he was a Jew --",
        "Q: I know.",
        "A: -- everybody knew it. But nobody -- nobody regarded him as a Jew.",
        "Q: What I mean to say 1s if there had been somebody else who had been Jewish and did not have\nthe same, let\u2019s say, point of view as your -- your father, but had wanted to be part of Lietukis,\nwould they have gotten such acceptance?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: And the reason being?",
        "A: Because he was a Jew.",
        "Q: So there was anti-Semitism in the country, and quite --",
        "A: Officially no. Officially no, but in the -- in -- for example, my father\u2019s next brothers,\nSalomonis, Solomon, he was the only person in Lietuvos bankas, the bank of Lithuania. Again,\nanother example. So you could get through, if you were accepted by Lithuanian community as\none of ours. Not as a Russian talking Jewish person, which was the style of our Jewish\npopulation. That\u2019s why it was so difficult to s-save sometimes, children, because they spoke\nRussian and they spoke Yiddish and they didn\u2019t speak Lithuanian. That was a tragedy that really\nwas an -- a very important factor. Many children could ha-have been saved.",
        "Q: You\u2019re talking now about the war.",
        "A: Yeah. Yeah.",
        "Q: About the -- the ghetto and the Holocaust. Let me go back a little bit again to World War I\njust for a question. Your father joined the -- the military and fought for Lithuanian independence.\nWere there other Jewish people that you knew --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- Jewish men that you knew --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- who did the same?",
        "A: Yes. There was -- I don\u2019t know the number, but I remember during the parades with -- when\nwe used to have big military parades, it was suba -- [speaks Lithuanian here]",
        "Q: [indecipherable]",
        "A: Like I see in my -- you know, I saw a film in United States and my father was in that film,\ntoo. I see the -- I would ca -- probably say about -- about a hundred, they were all fighters for\nLithuanian freedom.",
        "Q: So this [speaks Lithuanian] would be translated as a Jewish --",
        "A: The Jewish volunteers --",
        "Q: -- volunteers --",
        "A: -- for Lithuanian independence. Were Jewish fighters. Jewish fighter, volunteers for\nLithuanian independence.",
        "Q: And there were at least a hundred people --",
        "A: I -- I see -- I see the parade in -- I see in my eyes, yeah.",
        "Q: And that was a --",
        "A: It could have been more because the parades was always in Kaunas and there -- others in the\nother villages in other towns who probably -- not always used to come to Kaunas. But there was\nquite a few.",
        "Q: I\u2019m -- I mention this because the -- one of the charges of -- of Lithuanians against the Jewish\ncommunity is that the Jewish community in Lithuania sided with the Soviets when 1940 came\naround. That\u2019s the charge. And I remember talking to a number of survivors who would say there\nwere people who fought for Lithuania\u2019s independence, and that was not acknowledged, as they\nwere being driven to the pits to be shot. Is that sort of experience, that -- can you address that at\nall?",
        "A: In life there are two groups of people. There are richer people, there are factory working\nelement. Well, you cannot deny it, you have pictures, you see who stood in our main street\naccepting Soviet army. You see the pictures, you don\u2019t have to be told. The people with red flags\nstanding and greeting Soviet army were the element -- factory element. Jewish factory element.\nThe people -- the richer element, in percentage, was deported to Siberia -- higher percentage than\nLithuanians. I don\u2019t mean number, I mean percentage. So now you adjust these two factors. No\nintelligent class was willing to huh, Soviets are here. That was not the case. The factory class,\nyes. What remembered in people\u2019s memories are the red flags and who are the red flags. Only\nthey, when those people stood with red flags, my father, Mama and I, we all worked -- walked to\n[speaks Lithuanian]",
        "Q: The War Museum.",
        "A: The War Museum.",
        "Q: In Kaunas, mm-hm.",
        "A: Where for the last time -- I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re familiar, every evening the invalids came\nfrom the building, they paraded through the grounds and there was a ceremony. Whoever came\nto that, that day to the place, we were singing the Lithuanian national -- national anthem,\neverybody was crying. It was unbelievably mova -- m-moving scene. So you see, you can\u2019t\nblame the -- you can\u2019t blame the whole Jewish nation, same way you cannot blame the whole\nLithuanian nation for what happened.",
        "Q: It is a bitter moment though, for those who would have been volunteers. It\u2019s a bitter moment\nfor everybody, but in particular the people who had volunteered for Lithuania\u2019s independence to\nthen be called traitors and not have that counted at all.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know if you want to make a -- okay. Attorney Gornionskis from Kaunas --",
        "Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.",
        "A: -- was one of those. When the Soviets came, he took his f-family, moved to Vilnius.",
        "Q: He was a Jewish volunteer for the [indecipherable |",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: [ll tell you very quickly, because we are too far away. When the Lithuanian hapunes --",
        "Q: Who would this be?",
        "A: You had to be Lithuanian in those days. Hapune come from a word hapun. Hapun is to grab.\nThey were called in Jewish language, hapunes. These were the Lithuanians with the white --",
        "Q: Armbands?",
        "A: Armbands.",
        "Q: Balta raiSt}.",
        "A: Balta raist}. Came to his apartment and a Lithuanian officer was living in the same apartment\nand Lithuanian officer told him -- he was active officer in Lithuanian army at th -- th -- in those\ndays, is that Mr. Gornionski, do not answer the door. They see my name on the door, don\u2019t even\ncome close to the door. And whatever, hide in my room and lock the door. Don\u2019t even leave my\nroom. When the hapunes came to the apartment, Mr. Gornionski put his wife and two children in\nthe Lithuanian army officer\u2019s room, and Gornionski said, oh for God\u2019s sake, I am the volunteer\nwith Savanoris-Kureyjas, they are not going to do any harm to me. So he opened the door and his\nappearance was extremely Jewish. You couldn\u2019t take him for anybody else. And the Lithuanians\ntaunted, oh come on, you such and such. So he said to him, look, I am a volunteer fighter. I\nfought for your country\u2019s independence. That\u2019s why you have a country today, because of people\nlike me. And that made the man wild. He started to beat him there, to the pulp. So that was the\nreaction between one and the other. Now, how do I know all about it, is because of something\nvery similar happened in our place. My father said to Mama, please go to see what happened to\nGornionski. Because there was an aktion when those -- when --",
        "Q: So this was in 1941?",
        "A: \u201941, yes.",
        "Q: Right when the Nazis are invading --",
        "A: Right, yes.",
        "Q: -- during those first weeks.",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "Q: And this is what happens to -- and did he die, Mr. --",
        "A: Well, I'll tell you what happened. So at -- Mama went and Mrs. Gornionski opened the door\nand she told Mama what happened because she could hear everything, even though they were\nlocked in the room. Mama ran to Lithuanian military commandantura, Lithuanian military\nheadquarters. And Gornionskis had very, very good friend, Songila -- I have to remember the\nname. I think Majora Songila, if I\u2019m not wrong. Songila -- whatever he was doing, he dropped\neverything, he ran to Lukisk\u00e9s jail, where everybody was taking, to LukiSk\u00e9s. He went all over\nthrough the hundreds of people that were already brought and he was screaming, Gornionskis,\nGornionskis, Gornionskis until he couldn\u2019t scream any more. He couldn\u2019t find him. So whether\nfrom be -- being beaten so badly he just passed out, or whether he was so overcome with what\nhappened to him that he didn\u2019t react, Major Songila couldn\u2019t find him.",
        "Q: So he died.",
        "A: We don\u2019t know -- well -- well, naturally he died. Naturally they -- everything from the\nLukisSkes was taken to Paneriai and shot.",
        "Q: That\u2019s a bitter moment.",
        "A: It is a bitter moment, but you see there\u2019s again an explanation to -- to all of that certain\nexplanation. This was about two -- two -- two, three weeks after deportations to Siberia. Now,\nyou\u2019re too young to remember. I remember. Deportations to Siberia brought a lot of anger.",
        "Q: But why should it be directed against the country\u2019s Jews?",
        "A: The red flags of the people on the alley of liberty, [Lithuanian]. People don\u2019t forget things\nlike that. People who worked in personnel departments of each institution, kadroskidos, they\nwere in the hands of certain nationality.",
        "Q: So you --",
        "A: All that added up to the outburst of hatred. They didn\u2019t look at the time, were you pro or\ncontra, it just mass, the whole mass was experiencing that hatred.",
        "Q: How 1s it that your parents didn\u2019t, or your family didn\u2019t? You father didn\u2019t, or his -- his uncles\n-- or did they?",
        "A: How -- how did we -- what do you mean?",
        "Q: Make it through those first few weeks.",
        "A: Well, that was all [indecipherable] officer\u2019s help. See, the -- I -- I tol -- I mentioned that, it\nprobably belonged to that famous first regiment. The closeness of the officers was unbelievable.\nWhen the Soviets came in 1914, Papa was the first person from Lietukis thrown out of job. Not\nonly thrown out of job, but not given right to live in Kaunas, and not given right -- not given the\nlabor book. So for awhile we couldn\u2019t understand what\u2019s going on. We never had anything to do\nwith the Soviet Union. But after a few days, people started to see what\u2019s going on. So Mama said\nto my father, you know what? Go to Vilnius. His brother, who was bor -- working in Bank of\nLithuania in the meantime was transferred from Siauliai to Vilnius, so she said, go to Vilnius --",
        "Q: This is brother who -- which was --",
        "A: Salomonis.",
        "Q: Salomon.",
        "A: Yeah. Solomon. And he went to Vilnius. He tried to get a job in Vilnius. Whenever he would\nput his name and go through Kadroz Kiduz, that office of political personnel, he couldn\u2019t get the\njob.",
        "Q: Why\u2019?",
        "A: Why? First of all, he was an officer. Secondly, he went all over Lithuania talking, giving\nspeeches against Soviet Union.",
        "Q: In the Finnish German --",
        "A: In the finni -- fi -- fi --",
        "Q: -- in the Finnish Soviet war.",
        "A: -- Soviet war.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And secondly he was not a class that they want to have. In those days, when you opened our\nmain newspaper, on two pages were hundreds and hundreds Lithuanian army personnel out of\nwork, out of work, out of work. They would tell all these officers are out.",
        "Q: Which newspaper was this?",
        "A: That was still the first days [indecipherable] Aidas, but then it change already to different\nnames. But they gave a list of, in alphabetical order of each and every officer that used to serve\nin Lithuanian army.",
        "Q: So that means during the Soviet time, that is in 1940, this echo of Lithuania newspaper was\nstill being published.",
        "A: From the beginning. From the beginning it was published, but then they changed the names,\nyeah.",
        "Q: I see. My point though, is I\u2019m trying to understand 1s that even with the Soviet takeover, a\nnewspaper that was not Soviet controlled was allowed to be published and allowed to have the\nnames of people who were unemployed listed there. That\u2019s unusual, if I\u2019m understanding it\ncorrectly.",
        "A: The -- they knew we -- what -- don\u2019t forget there was a -- a -- the -- they formed a Lithuanian\npro-Soviet government. So the government had no choice. If they were told that all the officers\u2019\ncorps has to be out of the army, they had to do it. So that\u2019s where the -- all the officers were\nlisted. If there exists a fi -- somewhere you know, in archives, the newspapers from that area,\nyou'll find it. So you say how come. So anyway, to make a long story short, Father couldn\u2019t get\nwork in Vilnius. It happened that he met one of the people from his fighting years who was a\nhead of health department in Vilnius. Pulkanikas Colonel Usas. Usas saw him on the street and\nsay hey, what are you doing here in Vilnius, you\u2019re in Kaunas. So my father explained to him\nthat yes, I am in Kaunas, my family is in Kaunas, but I can\u2019t -- I don\u2019t have right to work in\nKaunas and I don\u2019t have right to register in Kaunas to live. So I came to Vilnius to see maybe I\ncan do something in here. So Colonel Usas told him look, we\u2019ll do something different. I will not\nput you through that political personnel department. I will hire you as chief accountant and you\u2019 ll\nbe listed as a daily worker, a laborer, so you don\u2019t have to go through the political process. And\nMr. Usas kept my father, as he said, in the health department, protected him as much as he could.\nAnd when the Germans came in Vilnius, the regulation that no Jew is allowed to work for a\ngovernment office came not immediately. So, every morning, when Jews were already wearing\nthe white -- not -- not yellow stars yet, the white armband, white and blue --",
        "Q: Jews were wearing a white and -- white --",
        "A: Yes, white and blue armband -- armband. So Mama used to take my father to the health\ndepartment --\nEnd of Tape Two\nBeginning Tape Three",
        "Q: Okay, so your father was working in the health department in Vilnius, 1-in -- in the -- what is\nthe capital city now.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: The Germans arrive and his protector, whose name was?",
        "A: Pulkanikas Colonel Usas.",
        "Q: Usas.",
        "A: U-s-a-s.",
        "Q: Okay, experiences some sort of difficulties or pressure. Can you tell us about what happened?",
        "A: Which one of them? My father\u2019s experiences -- pressure, or Colonel Usas?",
        "Q: Well, isn\u2019t it that ker --",
        "A: They had --",
        "Q: -- whoever -- whoever Is --",
        "A: -- okay.",
        "Q: -- yeah, what happened?",
        "A: That was a law. It was a law advertised on every pole, on every telephone pole, and not only\non the poles, we used to have such a -- that structure, on every couple of cor -- ca -- corners of\nthe street, where you would announce concerts, operas and so on. Everywhere was the new\nregulation issued by the -- signed by the new Lithuanian government, that no more Jewish\nextraction people are allowed to work for a state institution. That was a law. And Usas had no\nway to keep him any longer. He kept him up til that time.",
        "Q: And this is in June or July of 1941?",
        "A: That\u2019s right, that\u2019s right.",
        "Q: And so it\u2019s -- if it\u2019s issued by the Lithuanian government, do you mean the Lithuanian\nprovisional government?",
        "A: Provisional government.",
        "Q: So it\u2019s a provisional government directive, not a German directive?",
        "A: It was -- you know, it\u2019s difficult to tell today, because there was regulations put out by the\nGerman military headquarters, by Germans. We used to call Gebiets commissar, the ca --",
        "Q: Regional commissioner.",
        "A: Regional co-commissioner for Baltic countries. I can\u2019t tell you exactly now which one is\nwhich, but anyway, Usas or -- Colonel Usas told my father that the only thing I can think what to\ndo in this situation, I\u20191l appoint you as a director of the Jewish hospital. At least you\u2019ll be safe for\nawhile as a director of hospital because, he said, I believe the Germans will not shut the hospital.\nThey are -- they will be afraid of epidemics, typhoid or whatever, so you should be safe in the\nhospital. And -- my father never had anything to do with hospital or anything, but he said well,\nthis is the only thing I can do at the time being, unless you want to go into the hiding. And at that\ntime my father said he is not thinking about hiding. He\u2019ll go with his entire family, which at that\ntime was quite a few in Vilnius, he\u2019ll go and take the position of director of the hospital. And he\nstayed in the hospital for quite awhile.",
        "Q: Now at this point, I\u2019d like to leave that for a moment.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: I have a question about Colonel Usas and -- and it\u2019s one that\u2019s -- that it bi -- sort of like rouses\nmy curiosity. Here is somebody who was a -- let\u2019s say a comrade of your father\u2019s from the\nofficer corps of the Lithuanian independent army, who survives, let\u2019s say, a Soviet purge. In\nother words, his is not one of the names that\u2019s on the list of those who are unemployed, who ends\nup in Vilnius during the Soviet rule and is able to offer your father protection. And then lasts\nlong enough to still hold that post when the German come -- Germans come in. How 1s that\npossible with a person of such a background, to be able to do this?",
        "A: First of all, he was a doctor [speaks Lithuanian here]",
        "Q: Ear -- ear, no --",
        "A: A -- he was a doctor ear, nose and throat.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: So he was not just an administrative person, he was a doctor. So when the Soviets had those\nlists of officers out of the army, he was probably not in the regular army, he was a doctor.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: He was a doctor. A political person, a doctor. So that\u2019s how he managed to do it. Now, you\nwant me to continue in which direction?",
        "Q: Okay, I would say let\u2019s go back to the 1930\u2019s --",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: -- a little bit. We were -- we were talking earlier about your larger extended family, about\nyour father\u2019s work at Lietukis, which was a cooperative association.",
        "A: There\u2019s one thing I forgot to mention.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: We had a paramilitary organization called Sauliai.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Not Siauliai, but Sauliai, s-a-u.",
        "Q: What does that translate as?",
        "A: Para -- nothing.",
        "Q: Oh, para --",
        "A: Paramilitary organization. And my father was one of the leaders of that paramilitary\norganization. The members wore a uniform similar to army uniform.",
        "Q: Was it like a national guard?",
        "A: Something like national guard. The problem is that it was a very patriotic paramilitary\norganization which unfortunately, when the Germans came got a very bad review. It wasn\u2019t\nbefore.",
        "Q: Did it -- was it a deserved review? What did they do? How did they --",
        "A: Kill the Jews.",
        "Q: Well, let\u2019s -- what did they do, yeah.",
        "A: Killed the Jews.",
        "Q: Oh, they killed the Jews.",
        "A: Mm-hm. But, I haven\u2019t seen, and I don\u2019t know, but this is, if you will look into whatever is\nwritten, you will find. So you see, Father was a head of that organization in many places. So the\nSoviets couldn\u2019t digest him. Plus he\u2019s going all over the country, talking about the Finnish war.\nAnd he was known. Father was a member of Jewish -- a Revisionistic organization called Brit\nha-Hayal.",
        "Q: What is that? Tell us about that.",
        "A: The -- the Jewish people have Zionistic and Revisionistic. This was a Revisionistic\norganization.",
        "Q: Was it not for patriation to Palestine? Was it --",
        "A: Zionistic organizations were more for patriation to Palestine. Revisionistic were also s-same,\nbut the ideologic -- ideology was different. And --",
        "Q: How was it different?",
        "A: I was too young to tell you about the difference. I think they were more supporting bik --\nRevisionistic movement was movement for the richer people. Zionistic movement was more\nmovement of working class. I must have been around four or five years old and my father\norganized a military camp for members of the Brit ha-Hayal. He always felt that Jewish people\ndon\u2019t have that military drive, let\u2019s do it and there was a big camp organized, and in that camp I\nlearned a lot of Hebrew songs, which I happen to remember today. And th-they were pro-Israel,\nbut I don\u2019t know how they are [indecipherable] at that time. See, Israel at that time was British.\nSo they tried to use pressure somehow to get it out of British clutches.",
        "Q: Did you visit him at that camp?",
        "A: I was in the camp, Mama and I, we was -- we were in the camp. Yeah, no-no -- no other\nfamilies, just Mama and I.",
        "Q: And what do you remember from it?",
        "A: What I remember, I remember morning drills that they had, marching like army. You tried to\ninduce the -- you know, it\u2019s always been said the Jewish people are so often this and that, and he\nsaid it just the contrary, but you have to give them an out, somewhere how to do it, see.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. So, training.",
        "A: Training.",
        "Q: And was it -- was it well attended?",
        "A: Oh yes. They lived in there a -- for a month.",
        "Q: And how many people do you think were there? Do you -- would you rec -- what was it, a\ncouple of hundred? Was it fewer, was it more?",
        "A: I-I wouldn\u2019t say couple of hundred. You see, 1 -- in my memory I see them lined -- lined up\nfor the morning revai and so on. I couldn\u2019t tell you how many they had, but there was quite --\nquite a group. Quite a group.",
        "Q: And this had nothing to do with the Lithuanian military at all?",
        "A: No, no, nothing.",
        "Q: And the idea of it was that 1t would be a pr -- a force that would be part of the movement to\nIsrael, the movement to be able to establish Israel?",
        "A: You can\u2019t establish Israel in those days. You can\u2019t think about establishing, because it was in\nBritish clutch.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: It was Palestine. But they did work towards it, which -- which -- I don\u2019t know how they did it.",
        "Q: Did you know many of the other people who were at -- like --",
        "A: Who were in the camp?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Yes I did, but you see, I was four or five years old.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: I remember they had in our town, in Kaunas was Mr. Dushnitsky and Papa was under Mr.\nDushnitsky.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: So yi -- one was a leader, he was an assistant. And I remember that after the camp they\nneeded a worker in Lithuanian embassy. And there were two people as candidates. One was my\nfather and another was, I can\u2019t remember now his last name. So anyway, he got that position in\nthat Lithuanian embassy in Palestine.",
        "Q: Oh, so there was a representation of Lithuania in Palestine?",
        "A: Yeah, there was, there was, yeah.",
        "Q: And so the other person got that --",
        "A: The other person got the job, yeah. That -- what -- you see, I was too small to remember too\nmuch about [indecipherable]",
        "Q: What languages did you speak at home? What was your language between your father, your\nmother and yourself?",
        "A: Just Lithuanian.",
        "Q: Just Lithuanian.",
        "A: Just Lithuanian.",
        "Q: And were other languages sometimes spoken in your house?",
        "A: Oh yes. A lot of ad -- parents had a lot of friends from the army who were officers from the\nRussian Tsaristic army, incorporated into Lithuanian army.",
        "Q: Okay, so former Tsarist officers --",
        "A: Former Tsarist officers, right. And he had the very, very, very clo -- I -- I would say probably\nthe closest friends. Now let me see. It was Kanaz LaPotion, Kanaz -- what -- what we called him\nin -- in English. [speaks Lithuanian]",
        "Q: Ah, Grand Duke.",
        "A: Gran -- Duke.",
        "Q: Grand Duke, yes.",
        "A: Duke LaPotion, yeah. But when LaPotions were visiting us, they always spoke Russian.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: Because their Lithuanian was good, but not so good. His was good, his wife\u2019s not so much.",
        "Q: So this was part of, let\u2019s say, the ri -- White Russian --",
        "A: White, white Tsaristic --",
        "Q: -- Russian refugees who had --",
        "A: -- refuges, right, right.",
        "Q: -- who had come from Soviet --",
        "A: Now Mrs. -- Mr. LaPotion\u2019s brother, Kellanos Shablavinskas was the -- was attached to our\npresident of Lithuania.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: So this was our group, th-the LaPotions, the Shablavinska, but they, because of the w-women,\nwho don\u2019t learn so quick -- the men had to learn the language, but the women didn\u2019t, they spoke\nRussian.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: But otherwise I never heard Russian in the house.",
        "Q: But your mother spoke Russian, so it was --",
        "A: Oh, she pa -- she spoke perfect Russian.",
        "Q: And when did you learn it?",
        "A: You know, I cannot answer the question. I sometimes think to myself, when and where did I\npick up the language? We used to spend summers around Kulautuva.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: But a lot of Jewish families used to stay in summer --",
        "Q: Where is Kulautuva?",
        "A: Kulautuva is past -- on the river Nemunas, past Kaunas.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Not far away. I imagine those children must have talked Russian, I must have picked it up\nthere. But, in 1940, when the Russians came in, I was graduating and they pushed us to learn\nRussian in that one year. They expected us to pick it up. We didn\u2019t know the alphabet, we didn\u2019t\nknow how to write Russian letters, but we were given ins-instructions every day. We sat in high\nschool til seven o\u2019clock at night. They had --",
        "Q: You were how old then?",
        "A: 14.",
        "Q: 14. And so you hadn\u2019t -- your knowledge of Russian to that point had been in verbal\nconversation rather than --",
        "A: Just verbal, but not during my growing years, I didn\u2019t have anyone to talk Russian.",
        "Q: Okay, so it was not --",
        "A: Yeah --",
        "Q: -- there was no academic formal background --",
        "A: No, no, no, not at all.",
        "Q: -- there was no -- all of a sudden you have a crash course.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Before we get back to 1940 I wanted to, you know, talk a little bit more about those 1930\u2019s.\nDid you have -- when you were growing up, who were your closest friends your age?",
        "A: My age?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: The -- the closest friend was the daughter of our minister -- minister what int -- in-interior.\nSku\u00e9as, [indecipherable] Sku\u00e9as.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: That was my closest friend.",
        "Q: So it would be his daughter.",
        "A: [indecipherable] his daughter.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: When the Russians came in, Skucas took his wife and daughter to the border.",
        "Q: Of?",
        "A: Lithuania and Germany. They let his wife and daughter across, the Lithuanian guards\nwouldn\u2019t let [indecipherable] Sku\u00e9as across. He was in the ulttmatum where the Russians put the\nultimatum to our government. They said that they want to have arrested Mr. Sku\u00e9as and Mr.\nPovilaitis, both from Ministry of Interior. So they took Mr. Sku\u00e9as back, he was arrested. When I\nmet Mrs. Sku\u00e9as in Florida, she asked me, Ada, do something, try to find out. Maybe some\nJewish people sat with him somewhere. Maybe anybody knows, whatever there is, we have no\nidea what happened to him. We are read in the paper that he was finished, but no details, no\nplace of burial. And I told her, Mrs. Sku\u00e9as, I say, we have the same problem in our house. We\ndon\u2019t know exact date, we don\u2019t know where, we have no burial and we have no place where he\nis, you know, same thing. So I sympathize with her as much as, you know, because she went\nexactly what my mother went through. And that was my closest friend.",
        "Q: I see. I see. Did you have friends who were part of the Jewish community?",
        "A: Yes. They lived not too far from us, and we were friends since probably the age of four or\nfive. We played together -- we played together with her. For some reason I renamed her Lucia.\nHer name was Judith. I never liked the Judith name, I renamed her Lucia, so that even her\nparents, when I was there, called her Lucia. And --",
        "Q: What language did you speak?",
        "A: Lithuanian.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: So they were also more assimilated.",
        "A: Nope, very Jewish.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: Very Jewish, very Jewish. And that\u2019s a house where I heard a lot of Jewish language. Her\nmother was very famous. She had an atelier. Seam -- seamstress.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: She had many workers in the atelier, and those workers gradually went to Palestine. They\nused to get the landing permits somehow through the zionis -- Zionist organization, and they\nwent to Palestine. So Lucia, I lost track of her when the Soviets came. And then again, after the\nliberation, I met her in a theater. It was a very difficult moment, and for her and for me.",
        "Q: Why\u2019?",
        "A: Well, she lost her father, I lost my father. I had no idea that she\u2019s alive, she had no idea that I\nam alive. It -- it was a -- very difficult for me. But anyway -- so otherwise I didn\u2019t have Jewish\nfriends, no. But she had to be -- she was in an e -- two houses away, so we always played\ntogether. That\u2019s the only -- but otherwise in the Jewish society, no, it didn\u2019t happen.",
        "Q: Did you hear some of your other playmates at school make fun of Jews?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Di -- no.",
        "A: Nothing. Not -- not in that class of people. We were -- I\u2019Il show you the pictures. We had a\nvery large number of Jewish students who excelled, so that from the side of teachers you would\nnever hear anything like that, never.",
        "Q: So this is at that elite high school that you went --",
        "A: Elite high school, right.",
        "Q: -- that you went to.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And of course if you have a larger number of kids who are Jewish then it\u2019s unlikely --",
        "A: Unlikely.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah. What were -- you know, as the 1930\u2019s were progressing, you were getting older and\nolder, from childhood into young teenager.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: What are your memories from that time? A --",
        "A: Wonderful.",
        "Q: In what way?",
        "A: Wonderful in every way. In every way. I -- I was playing piano. I entered Kaunas\nConservatory. I was very skinny, so my parents decided that I need more muscles, so they put me\nin the ballet school. But our ballet school does not compare to American ballet school. Six days a\nweek, every day, just Sunday off.",
        "Q: Oh my.",
        "A: That was a state ballet school. So, between ballet and conservatory and sports, I had no time\nto be bored or anything. I had a wonderful time, and I was very good in sports also. I loved to\nski. I have a silver medal in Lithuanian ski competitions in the senior group --",
        "Q: Where there are mountains?",
        "A: Yes -- not with mountains, cross country.",
        "Q: Uh-huh, okay.",
        "A: Cross country s -- right. And I was good runner. So can you imagine having all this and to do\nthe music lessons at home? The high school lessons didn\u2019t bother me, I was very good at that,\nbut the music, you had to do it. So there was no free time. I had the wonderful time, wonderful\nfriends. The skating rink, all they had to do was run down the hill to backyard into the skating\nrink. I have plenty of pictures from skating rink with all my friends. And since I was the\nyoungest, I always was the smallest one, but that didn\u2019t matter.",
        "Q: When did world events, particularly those events in Germany start entering your\nconsciousness? Did peop -- you know --",
        "A: Never.",
        "Q: Never.",
        "A: Never. Some of my mother\u2019s friends -- and my mo-mo-mother\u2019s and father friends went to\nAmerica cause they had t -- families in America, but they went only when the Soviets came, via\nJapanese help, you know, the Japanese consul?",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: Yes, with his help, they went. We heard a lot of what was going in Germany because we used\nto spend summer in Palanga, and in the late part of 30\u2019s, the German -- Germans used to come to\nPalanga and they used to tell us more or less what\u2019s going on. But we never thought it concerns\nus. We never thought that Hitler one day will take Klaipeda and so on and so on.",
        "Q: Do you remember when that happened? When he did take Klaipeda?",
        "A: What was it, 30 --",
        "Q: [indecipherable]",
        "A: Okay, it started with the big -- big case of Sass and Neuman. Lithuania caught the spies Sass\nand Neuman and put them on trial.",
        "Q: Whose spies were they?",
        "A: Germany.",
        "Q: They were German spies in Lithuania?",
        "A: German spies in Lithuania. They were put on trial and I think since that trial, the atmosphere\nbetween Germany and Lithuania started to get worse and worse. And then one day Hitler put an\nultimatum and that\u2019s when all the Lithuanians ran out from hi -- Zemaitija, from Klaip\u00e9da\nregion, to Kaunas.",
        "Q: So, from the Memel region, Memel is Klaipeda --",

        "Q: -- they left their homes, they lost their --",
        "A: -- yes, they left everything. But it still didn\u2019t give us even th -- if you talk to the German\npopulation, many of them say they didn\u2019t know a lot. We didn\u2019t know a lot either.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: Nobody thought that a civilized nation like German nation will be able to do atrocities of the\nkind that they did.",

        "A: They never mentioned political pressure, see? So we had no idea. We -- we knew that it\u2019s not\nas good as it used to be before, but our Jewish people still kept going to Germany for trade. The\nvisas were open, you could go in and back. So you see we didn\u2019t -- we didn\u2019t know. There is a\nbook by a Lithuanian writer, [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: I have the book. In that book she describes the survival of two Jewish girls.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And when I was reading that book I figured, uh-oh, I think I know who she 1s. She was in my\nschool. Her father had factory, I know the name. And somehow, when I was vacationing in\nMaine, I came to talk about the book with one of Lithuanian singers from Canada, and -- Kabliss.\nAnd he said, oh you\u2019re right, that\u2019s her. But she doesn\u2019t have -- she has nothing to do with people\nfrom that times. And just why, what\u2019s wrong? I -- he said, I don\u2019t know, but she doesn\u2019t want to\nknow anybody, she only keeps in touch with the family who saved her. So, why did we come to\nthis now, I can\u2019t understand.",
        "Q: I don\u2019t remember, but it was something to do --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- with the -- with what you know what --",
        "A: Oh, oh. Her father -- she was attending ballet school with me, and I remember her father\ngoing to Germany and I remember her father bringing her beautiful, black shoes. And th-that\u2019s\nwhy I remember [indecipherable]. Her father kept going to Germany back and forth in business.\nHe had the big stocking factory.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And he just went and came back. Nothing -- nothing to -- so that\u2019s way -- when you say that,\ndid we know? No, we didn\u2019t know.",
        "Q: No sort of premonition?",
        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: And now let\u2019s go east. When did you get a sense of Soviet Russia?",
        "A: When they entered.",
        "Q: And not before.",
        "A: No. Before, I used to stay very often with the Sku\u00e9as family, and I remember once at the\ndinner, he had the conversation with his wife, the Russians started to tell us that couple of Soviet\nsoldiers have disappeared. And he said it -- 1t\u2019s an awful provocation. But in those days he didn\u2019t\nthink that it\u2019I]1 come -- that\u2019 be a reason for the Russians to tell that they are coming to liberate\nLithuania.",
        "Q: So the provocation is on whose side? The Russians are provoking the Lithuanians?",
        "A: Right. That we did something to a couple of their soldiers and the soldiers disappeared, as if.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: See, that was -- that was the beginning.",
        "Q: And that\u2019s the first premonition you have --",
        "A: That is pre-premonition that there\u2019s some -- and then they introduced -- no, they introduced\nSoviet bases, basi, bases for Russian soldiers. They were not going out of the way, so they stayed\non the base. And that\u2019s when they said that couple of soldiers disappeared from the base and\nnever returned. And that was a main thing, as if, to liberate us.",
        "Q: And how did you -- how did -- well, we\u2019ll come to that in a little bit, but ho -- you were by\nthat point 13 - 14 years old.",
        "A: 14.",
        "Q: So I\u2019d like to get a sense of what do you remember, what do you experience. How did it affect\nyou in particular?",
        "A: Oh yeah, I'll tell you.",
        "Q: But it can be in the next tape.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: Okay.\nEnd of Tape Three\nBeginning Tape Four",
        "Q: Okay, so what ha -- a-after you remember this dinner conversation with the ministry interiors\ntalking about the strange situation of the Soviet Union saying their soldiers have gone missing\nhere, and then bases are established within the territory, what was your next memory of what\nhappened with independent Lithuania or life as you knew it, basically.",
        "A: Nothing until they crossed the border and marched into Lithuanian territory. Nothing.",
        "Q: And do you remember that?",
        "A: Oh perfectly.",
        "Q: What happened, how -- what did you see? What is what -- what\u2019s in your minds -- mind\u2019s\neye?",
        "A: The -- the Russian army, on little horses. Most of the riders slanted eyed, was the\n[indecipherable] nation --",
        "Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.",
        "A: -- marching through our Avenue of Liberty in Kaunas, straight. And that\u2019s when I told you\nPapa took me and my mother to the Museum of War, and we spent with a crowd of people there.\nWe couldn\u2019t stand any more that pressure, watching the Soviets get into the country.",
        "Q: You mentioned earlier that there had been factory people and alluding that most of these had\nbeen Jewish who stood there with red flags. Was it no -- only Jewish people? Were there any\nLithuanians?",
        "A: Well, there are many pictures.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And when you look at the pictures, you can see the percentage. So I don\u2019t want to answer\nhow many or not how many, just look at the pictures, and there is a -- different features of these\ntwo nationalities.",
        "Q: How did life change in your personal relationships with the people that you knew? Did any go\n-- did -- did any surprise you and -- and let\u2019s say become part of the new system?",
        "A: Not from my close friends, but I want to tell you, out of 30 students, of the 30 pupils at the\ntime when the Soviet entered, we graduated nine. It was all what\u2019s left from 30.",
        "Q: And what happened with the rest?",
        "A: Either deported to Siberia, or cross the border.",
        "Q: Left the country.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: What happened after the Soviet takeover? How did it impact your family in the very first\ninstance? Was it the loss of your father\u2019s job?",
        "A: The loss of my father\u2019s job, the closing of bank accounts and introducing the s -- how many\nSquare yards per person you were allowed to have. So we were forced, in a nice way, to accept\ntwo families to live together.",
        "Q: What kind of a place did you have before? Was it a large apartment or a house?",
        "A: It was an apartment.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: A-According to our code -- conditions in Kaunas it was a large apartment. Three big rooms,\nplus a smaller room for the servant, kitchen, bathroom and so on. So, we had a family in each\nroom, and we were squeezed into one room. But this was survivable, this was not a tragedy.\nWhat affected more were the deportations.",
        "Q: Can you tell us a little bit about that? What happened there?",
        "A: Father, as I mentioned before, was in Vilnius working for the health department. I was going\nthrough my last exams and sint -- deportations started Thursday night.",
        "Q: On what month?",
        "A: June.",
        "Q: And what year?",
        "A: \u201841",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Couple of weeks before the war started.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Mother couldn\u2019t get through on the telephone to Vilnius to find out what\u2019s going on. She was\nclimbing the walls, we -- we didn\u2019t know what\u2019s going on. So she said look, Ill get the suitcase\nready. I'll put Father\u2019s winter clothing into the suitcase. The moment you finish your exam,\nwe\u2019re running to the railway station, we\u2019re going to Vilnius. And we came by rail to Vilnius.\nThat was Saturday. Sunday morning the first bombs fell on Vilnius.",
        "Q: So you missed the deportations, you weren\u2019t on the lists.",
        "A: We were on the lists.",
        "Q: You were on the lists?",
        "A: But my father wasn\u2019t there and they couldn\u2019t find our house. The house stood in between two\nstreets on a hill. You couldn\u2019t access it from down, because it was locked, and you couldn\u2019t find\nit from the top, because you couldn\u2019t find it.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: It was a very lucky and unlucky situation. Sometimes you know, I was thinking, if we would\nhave been all together, and if we would been deported, maybe -- maybe he would survive. But I\ndon\u2019t give much chance to it because I don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t think he would survive. Usually they --\nthey shot the man from the beginning. So anyway, that what happened. I had the white dress on,\nMama had a light purple dress on. That was all we had, nothing. We didn\u2019t realize that -- what is\ncoming this morning, so we thought we\u2019ll leave him this stuff in case, for deporf -- deportations,\nwe come back to Kaunas. We couldn\u2019t get back.",
        "Q: Why not?",
        "A: Germ -- German army came in next morning. I mean, the war started next morning.",
        "Q: When you were already in Vilnius.",
        "A: We were already in Vilnius Saturday night.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: And war started Sunday morning.",
        "Q: So deportations happening on a Thursday night.",
        "A: Yeah, ye -- deportations happened two weeks before --",
        "Q: On a Thursday night.",
        "A: -- on the 14\" - 15\" --",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: -- that\u2019s when the deportations started, yeah, two weeks before the war.",
        "Q: I see. So you were preparing in case that was going to happen --",
        "A: In case --",
        "Q: -- again.",
        "A: -- yes, yeah.",
        "Q: And any of your friends got deported?",
        "A: So I told you, out of 30 we were left nine.",
        "Q: Did you talk to their families? Was there anybody left to tell you what was happening, or --\nhow did -- how did you experience those deportations, that\u2019s what I\u2019m saying. If you weren\u2019t\naffected yourselves --",
        "A: Trying now to tell you. You see, first night we didn\u2019t know what\u2019s going on. M -- I had my\nexams, and the next morning when I went to school, there were fewer of us. The first ones that\nwere deported was our previous diplomatic ministry in Rome, Charnetskis\u2019 -- Charnetski, they\nwere my very close friends, all three children, they had five children and all the Charnetskis\u2019\nlived very close and th -- it was their daughter Lucia, I was especially close. And char -- no,\nCharnetskis weren\u2019t taken the first days because -- no, you\u2019re right, Charnetskis were taken the\nfirst night and they didn\u2019t show up for Friday\u2019s exam. Then we noticed next day some others\ndidn\u2019t show up for the exam. By that time the town already knew what was going on. And you\nknow what\u2019s very interesting? That week we had posters all over that [indecipherable] KGB\nchoir 1s giving concerts in our city. And nobody put two and two together, why suddenly we\nhave a KGB choir. See, this way they -- people saw them on the street, but 1t didn\u2019t occur to\nthem that this is the help for deportations. They came under auspices of musical unit, which they\n-- they were musical unit. But at the same time we had ta -- ca -- th-the city full of\n[indecipherable] people. So now when the deportations started, the people who later on kept us\nfor two years in hiding, they were originally from Kaunas and Vilnius, and then their parents and\nbrother were deported, the first night. And their children were already sent to the fi --\ngrandparents for summer vacations. They were not --",
        "Q: This was June, yeah.",
        "A: June. And they took the whole family, the grandparents, the son and the two children, put\nthem all into the echelon. Echelon came to Vilnius, but the children were not on the list, so they\ntook the children out of the echelon and tell them, go home. So they came --",
        "Q: Off of the train they took them --",
        "A: Out of the train, and they went home and they told exactly what has happened, that the whole\nechelon is full of people going to Siberia, and --",
        "Q: But did they know it was Siberia?",
        "A: They didn\u2019t know what was, it was Kazakhstan, Siberia, whatever, but they knew that\nsomething awful is going on. So that was what compelled tha -- it was a huge farm, huge one --\nthey went right away to -- to take care of th -- of the place [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And that was the first information that we had directly, what\u2019s going on.",
        "Q: So in your memory, you remember seeing Soviet soldiers in the streets who could have been\npart of the NK VD tw -- choir, but you never saw a -- a -- one of the trucks come by in the middle\nof the night, or you --",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: -- didn\u2019t see any other --",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: -- actual instance of --",
        "A: No, no, no.",
        "Q: Okay. And also you wouldn\u2019t have known then, who would have been the people who\ninformed.",
        "A: They had lists. The lists were made by the political personnel office, [indecipherable]",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: The political personnel office. Don\u2019t forget that when you looked for a job, when Soviets\ncame, you had to give information three generations back. You, your parents, your grandparents.\nSo they had very good information about everybody.",
        "Q: I see. Where they lived, who they were.",
        "A: Absolutely. And I experienced [indecipherable] one in the sports circle. We had a very highly\ntrained group of sportsmen, and that group was supposed to represent Lithuania in Moscow\nsports festival. And you know between sport people, you took [indecipherable] you -- sports\nhere, sport there. Anyway, just about a month before the departure we were told that we are\ngoing through the political indoctrination group. And each one of us had to fill out the form,\ngiving back, again, three generations who we are, and out of the group remained about a quarter.\n75 percent were not acceptable, and the leader of the group was a Soviet lieutenant from\nGeorgia, Chechyan, he said my God, what am I going to do? I have to ship the group to Moscow\nand I have 25 percent of the group. So he turned -- you -- he -- he knew -- we didn\u2019t know about\nthat sport and polit -- politics are just having something in common. He turned to the\norganizations, all kinds of sport organizations, clubs of the workers, factories and so on and he\ngot people, but he had one month to train.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: He had one -- he said it\u2019s unbelievable, how can I do it, I don\u2019t know. But [indecipherable]\nthe war came, there was no parade or anything, so --",
        "Q: So his problem was solved.",
        "A: His problem was solved, right. But that\u2019s how the Soviet operated, see? So by not -- by se --\nsending 75 percent of the group out, you gave them a idea what\u2019s going to happen to them.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Okay. We\u2019re in Vilnius now. You\u2019re in -- in your white summer dress.",
        "A: Yeah, in summer dr --",
        "Q: You mother, I think, has a purple dress.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: You meet your father.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: You\u2019re together again.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And you hear airplanes overhead.",
        "A: Yes. Now, when we heard airplanes overhead, that was Sunday morning, I went to a line to\nget some bread, I was standing in a line. The bigger bombings started at night. But since my\nuncle was working from Bank of Lithuania, and the bank has vaults under the ground, we all\nwent to the Bank of Lithuania to wait until the bombs stopped falling. And we found everybody\nwho was working for the bank was downstairs in the vaults.",
        "Q: But at that point your father was still a laborer in the health department.",
        "A: In the health department, yeah.",
        "Q: Your uncle still was at the Bank of Lithuania --",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: -- and the vaults of the bank were your bomb shelters.",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "Q: Okay. What happened after that?",
        "A: Well, in the morning we went back to the apartment. My -- in the apartment was my uncle,\nhis wife, she was very pregnant and my father\u2019s mama.",
        "Q: So, Uncle Solomon and his --",
        "A: Solomon, his wife and his -- my father\u2019s -- my grandmother and my father. And then Mama\nand I.",
        "Q: And how large was this apartment?",
        "A: Oh, two rooms, because it was Soviet -- Soviet time, you couldn\u2019t have any more.",
        "Q: I see. So there was a lot of people.",
        "A: Lot of people, yeah.",
        "Q: And again, let\u2019s take it further. In the next several days, next week or so, what are your\nmemories of that time? What happened that was significant to you?",
        "A: I think it started with Jewish families being physically thrown out of big apartments in\ndowntown Vilnius.",
        "Q: Who would do that? Who was doing those throwing outs?",
        "A: Both.",
        "Q: Both who?",
        "A: And the German officers who needed apartments.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And the help, Lithuanian help. There were no yellow stars yet. There was no -- no walking on\nsidewalk yet. The first what I remember, all the Jews have to bring to the police station, all radio\n-- radios. Think next one was all Jew --",
        "Q: Did your family do that?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Cause you weren't Jewish, or cause you didn\u2019t have a radio?",
        "A: No, because we were [indecipherable] for Jewish. Next one was all the Jews are su -- to --\nposed to bring to police station, all jewels. And people did. Then, around that time I think there\nwas a provocation. The Germans accused that a German soldier was killed. That was the first\ntime that was something very ugly.",
        "Q: What happened?",
        "A: I think they called the Jewish elders, a committee of the elders, Judenrat --",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And they put a fine in so many Jewish people, they had to report. But it still didn\u2019t -- didn\u2019t\ngive people any idea.",
        "Q: You mean, some soldiers were killed, and then others --",
        "A: A -- a soldier, a soldier was killed. The Germans claimed it and they -- then they called the\nmembers of Judenrat and told them that they have to -- to send so many -- I don\u2019t remember now\nthe number, so many people to report to Lukisk\u00e9s, to the jail.",
        "Q: And Lukisk\u00e9s is a jail.",
        "A: Jail.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: After that, next one was Jewish people wearing the, about three inches wide, white with blue,\nthe Jewish Magen David on the sleeve.",
        "Q: Jewish star.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: After that was no walking on sidewalks.",
        "Q: Did that affect you?",
        "A: In -- in what sense did that affect me? I mean, I -- I mentioned before that Father was still\nworking at health department, Mama would go every morning with him too, and every afternoon\nto pick him up. She would hold him under the arm so that her hands was on his thing.",
        "Q: But you\u2019 re half-Jewish.",
        "A: Yes, I know, but in Vilnius nobody knew me. In Kaunas I wouldn\u2019t be able to -- to hide it.",
        "Q: So, in other words, you were not in Kaunas when the -- when the -- the first pogroms\nhappened?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: You weren\u2019t -- you weren't there --",
        "A: I -- I was at Vilnius.",
        "Q: You were in Vilnius.",
        "A: Yeah, that\u2019s why --",
        "Q: Did you ha --",
        "A: -- I don\u2019t know anything about Kaunas.",
        "Q: I see. And was there telephone connection, or did you find -- when you were in Vilnius, was\nthere a way that you could find out what was going on and that -- did find out what was going on\nin Kaunas, or not?",
        "A: No, because we were all in Vilnius.",
        "Q: I see. I see. So -- so you really had no knowledge --",
        "A: No knowledge, no.",
        "Q: -- of what was going on there?",
        "A: There -- what I knew -- what I knew about Kaunas was that Kaunas was given one month\u2019s\ntime for Jewish population. They were given the borders bordering streets where they should\nmove for future ghetto. And in Kaunas the whole thing went in an orderly manner. The Jewish\npeople took their furniture, took the -- took their belongings into that area. They had one month\u2019s\ntime to do it. In Vilnius there was no warning at all. The apartment which my Uncle S-Solomon\nhad was in a building that was the last building before ghetto wall. And when --",
        "Q: On what street, excuse me, cause I know s --",
        "A: Rudninku gatve.",
        "Q: Oh, so it was really right there across the street.",
        "A: Right there, right there.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And when the Lithuanian army soldiers came to put the boards to enclose, my uncle went\ndownstairs, and he spoke perfect Lithuanian and he told the soldier, look, my wife is expecting a\nbaby any day, and my old mother, please let us climb, as long as you are not too high yet. They\njust started, and the soldiers said, go ahead, right away. So he took his mother, his wi -- pregnant\nwife and himself, they climbed that started wall and they went inside. Now, the others were\ntaken out to Lukiskes.",
        "Q: Excuse me now. The apartment that your family was living in, it was outside the border of the\nghetto?",
        "A: Outside the border, outside.",
        "Q: Okay, so they are still able to live in that apartment, or not?",
        "A: Oh no, no, no, no, no, no.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: That was the last building before the ghetto border.",
        "Q: So where did they go, if they couldn\u2019t --",
        "A: They climbed the wall, went into the area.",
        "Q: Went into the ghetto area.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Without a place to live.",
        "A: Without a place to live. But they were fortunate because they weren\u2019t pushed to the jail, to\nLukiske\u00e9s jail. They escaped sure death, because all the others who didn\u2019t think so quick, they\nwere already taken to LukiSkes and they never showed up any more.",
        "Q: All right, maybe I\u2019ve gotten ahead of myself a little bit.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: We were going through the sequence of what was happening in Vilnius and -- and in\ncomparison it was chaotic to what was happening in Kaunas as far as the ghetto being\nestablished.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: But we left it at such that people were had -- had to take their radios to --",
        "A: Police.",
        "Q: -- the authorities.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: They had to bring their jewels --",
        "A: Jewels, yes.",
        "Q: -- there. They had to rep -- some, when a German soldier was supposedly killed, the Jewish\nelders were told to get a certain number of people to report to the jail.",
        "A: Yes, yeah.",
        "Q: And then what? And then what?",
        "A: And then -- then this started the -- the most awful period of the Jews being dragged from\napartments by hapunes, by -- by the helpers.",
        "Q: By the Lithuanian helpers?",
        "A: Lithuanian helpers, right. That\u2019s when I told you the incident with -- did you -- you asked me",
        "Q: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: -- whether there are other Lithuanian officers. That was what happened to Mr. Gornionski.\nNow what happened in our case, normally when th-these -- see, in Vilnius, every house had a --\nwhat would you call it 1-in English? Not a janitor, but it was a --",
        "Q: Housekeeper of a sort?",
        "A: Not housekeeper. It was a person who took --",
        "Q: A supervi -- a super.",
        "A: A super, right.",
        "Q: Superintendent.",
        "A: And all those supers knew everybody. So when they -- the Lithuanians came to take people,\nthe super would take them to every door. She knew who lives where. So normally when they --\nthey -- they would come, Mama would come out, and said no, there are no more Jews in here.\nJust like that. But that particular time it didn\u2019t work out. The super stood behind and Mama came\nout, I came out, the grandmother came to the hallway, because her Lithuanian was perfect. And\nthe question was, any more Jews inside? And we couldn\u2019t -- couldn\u2019t hide any more, the super\nwas standing right behind. So, that\u2019s probably the most difficult scene I\u2019ve seen in my life. He\ncame into -- the hallway was little, the hallway. He came into the first room. My father was\nstanding, my uncle was standing, grandmother was there, Mama and I. We returned back. My\nfather wore the army officer\u2019s boots, and the -- the army pants. And he said, well, take a piece of\nsoap, take one towel and let\u2019s go. Now, we already knew what let\u2019s go more or less means. It\u2019s\nLukisk\u00e9s.",
        "Q: That\u2019s the soldier. That\u2019s the --",
        "A: That\u2019s a Lithuanian.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Mama started to talk to him. She said look, you\u2019re a young man, you\u2019re attending college. My\nhusband fought for independence. He put his books away, he finished high school after he\nreturned from the front. He is one of the Lithuanian volunteer fighters. Please leave him here.\nUnder no circumstances. Under no circumstances. My mother went on her knees. She grabbed\nhis hands, she started kissing his hands, begging him, please understand that he is not just a\nperson, he is person who fought for you. And somehow finally, he agreed, with Mama on her\nknees, he agreed to leave my father.",
        "Q: Do you remember what he looked like?",
        "A: Oh, not today, not today. I wouldn\u2019t recognize him.",
        "Q: But do you remember his manner, his -- his attitude?",
        "A: His attitude? I couldn\u2019t care less, probably I would describe it. He was told to get as many\nJews as he can, and my uncle was standing behind my father. So my mother said to him again,\nlisten, that\u2019s their mother. You left one son and you\u2019re taking the other son. I\u2019m begging you,\nplease leave both sons to their mother. And she managed to get my uncle left. When -- when --",
        "Q: What about grandma?",
        "A: No, the men, men.",
        "Q: Oh, I see, they weren't taking women.",
        "A: Take a piece of soap, take one towel, you\u2019re going to build the east west, or whatever it was,\nhighway. After he left our room, Mama told me, go to the kitchen, see what\u2019s going on. That was\nSoviet time. Every room had a family, and the owner of that huge house had his room. So I went\nout and I\u2019ve seen that from the other room, they\u2019re taking a husband. His wife was pregnant with\na child too. And I went closer to the owner\u2019s room, and I looked through the keyhole. So what I\ncould see was a man told him to give all the jewels first of all. You know, he took his watch, he\ntook his rings. And then they took -- the man was in his probably, 80\u2019s, very old person, to build\na highway. So anyway, after that, Mama ran to Mr. Gornionski\u2019s place, because they were\nkicked out from their luxurious apartment by German officers. But in a -- in a polite way. But\nthey had to leave everything behind. She ran to the place where they lived with that -- sharing\napartment with that Lithuanian officer, and that when Mama found out what happened to Mr.\nGornionski. And then the major from our military place, Major Songinas ran to Luki8sk\u00e9s to find\nhim and couldn\u2019t find him, that that was the end of it, yeah.",
        "Q: So these are the first days --",
        "A: These are the first days, yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: -- of the German occupation --",
        "A: Yeah, yeah --",
        "Q: -- of -- of Vilnius and --",
        "A: -- yeah, yeah, yeah --",
        "Q: -- what\u2019s happening to the city\u2019s Jews.",
        "A: -- yeah, yeah. And the -- the most unfortunate thing was that the ghetto area was small, and\nthe population in Vilnius was big. And there was no warning and there was nothing to make\npeople go into the area. So they couldn\u2019t fit so many, so they just took the upflow, what there\nwas, Overflow to the jail, and from jail to Paneriai for liquidation.",
        "Q: But did people know that?",
        "A: No, no, people didn\u2019t know what. Now, about knowing that, I'll come back to you. While\nFather was the head of Jewish hospital, one night --",
        "Q: Can we leave this for a second?",
        "A: Sure.",
        "Q: Because we\u2019re going to ba -- finish our tape and come to the next -- to the next cass --\nEnd of Tape Four\nBeginning Tape Five",
        "Q: This is something that is un -- I -- I don\u2019t fully quite understand it and maybe it needs a little\nbit more explanation. It sounds that all of a sudden, one day, without any warning, people show\nup, these hapunes show up in the various apartments across the stity -- city where there are --\nwhere there are Jews who are living, and who are pushing them out of their houses, who knows\nwhere. Or is it they\u2019re th -- just taking the men? What -- what was happening?",
        "A: Everybody. When -- when the exodus to ghetto started, it was everybody. Just leave the\nhouse. Old, young, baby, whatever. Everybody had to leave.",
        "Q: And they go to where? Where they\u2019re brought? Where were they brought to?",
        "A: As long as ghetto had enough place for those people, they went into the ghetto area.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: When -- there is no explanation why certain groups was taken straight to Lukiskes.",
        "Q: Straight to the prison, which is on another side of town.",
        "A: Straight to the prison, another -- another side of town. The view that you saw was awful.\nPeople didn\u2019t know what\u2019s going on. People thought that they are being grouped into ghetto.\nThey were dragging pillows, blankets, pots and pans, whatever they, in the panic they managed\nto take. The Polish population stood outside this on the sidewalks making fun. The atmosphere\nwas awful, just awful. Now, that day a -- Father told me to go to Colonel Usas home and stay\nwith them, cause we didn\u2019t know how much the Nuremberg laws will affect me, because the --\nthe nu --",
        "Q: Did you know about the nur -- Nuremberg laws?",
        "A: Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes.",
        "Q: By that point you knew?",
        "A: Oh yes. It -- but it\u2019s a -- Nuremberg laws affect three generations. Not the fi -- I was the first\ngeneration, and then my parents and then my grandparents. So I stayed with [indecipherable]\nUsas, and Mama took my father\u2019s war medals and went to see our Prime Minister, Kubilunas.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: And she -- she managed to get into his office, and she told him, General, have a look at these\ndocuments. It\u2019s your signature on my husband\u2019s war medals. Aren\u2019t you able to do something to\nhelp me? And Kubilunas was very polite, but he told my mother, Ponia -- Madam, there 1s\nnothing I can do in Jewish question. It\u2019s in the hands of the Germans and my hands are tied. I\ncannot do a thing. So Mother\u2019s only hope, that Kubilunas maybe will help, disappeared. He\ncouldn\u2019t do a thing. And you couldn\u2019t do a thing. It was all in the hands of Gestapo, and that was\nit. And the SS.",
        "Q: And he was in Vilnius at that time?",
        "A: He was in Vilnius, he was in ghetto, he was the head of Jewish hospital.",
        "Q: No, no, no, I meant Kubilunas.",
        "A: No. The Lithuanian -- I think at that time that -- no, Mama went to Kaunas. He was in -- in\nKaunas. Our first government, Kubilunas was the head of the government, was in Kaunas.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: So when Mama came back from Kaunas, she told my father that she couldn\u2019t do anything.\nNow, I started to tell you --",
        "Q: And where were the --",
        "A: -- \u2019m sorry. You asked me, did the people know what\u2019s going on. Quite awhile before ghetto,\none night, I believe about five people escaped the shooting place Paneriai. There were three not\nconnected, I think, women and two children, not connected in between. They managed to survive\nthe shooting in the pit, and that night got out of the pit, found the two children alive, and they\nwalked to Vilnius in the dark, towards Jewish hospital. When they came into the hospital, my\nfather took them to a separate area and started to question.",
        "Q: So by that point he\u2019s director of the hospital.",
        "A: He\u2019s director of the hospital and they were all bleeding, so he sent his personnel with hot\nwater to wash the blood from the sidewalks so that if the Germans catch it, there wouldn\u2019t be no",
        "Q: Trail.",
        "A: -- trail which way did they go. The Germans didn\u2019t catch it anyway. But my father isolated\nthese people in the separate part of hospital because he was afraid of general panic. And he put\nthe lady, by the name Mrs. Salinski, she was from Kaunas. She was a nurse -- she di -- no-not\npractically, she was -- she was a real, registered nurse but she wasn\u2019t practicing, and she was in\ncharge of these people. The only person that went in and out, until he figured out what to do,\nbecause he didn\u2019t know whether the Germans will find or not. So by that time my father already\nhad an idea what\u2019s going on in Paneriai. That\u2019s it\u2019s not going to build the highway east w-west or\nwhatever, that is going straight to the pits to be shot.",
        "Q: In other words, he -- if he had any doubts before, he learned at that point, that when your\nmother fell on her knees, she saved his life.",
        "A: Oh, that\u2019s absolutely.",
        "Q: Yeah, and also --",
        "A: Absolutely, because that -- that went to -- straight to LukiSkes, yeah.",
        "Q: Id like to get a better sense of the sequence. You talk of -- you talk of mass chaos, basically,\npeople being forced into the territory of the ghetto and those who don\u2019t have a room or a place\nare left in the streets, and if they\u2019re in the streets, then they\u2019re taken to LukiSkes prison and then\nfrom there they\u2019re taken to Paneriai, but people don\u2019t know that yet. Is that correct?",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "Q: And then when these two children, the three people, but two of them children, come to, you\nknow, to the Jewish hospital in Vilnius, your father sees them, is that already when the ghetto has\nbeen established, even in its early days, or is that before the establishment of the ghetto?",
        "A: Before.",
        "Q: Before. So there\u2019s no ghetto yet.",
        "A: Before. No ghetto yet.",
        "Q: Is it after the time he was supposed to have been taken?",
        "A: After.",
        "Q: After.",
        "A: After. Because at the time that he was supposed to be taken, he was still working for health\ndepartment.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: See?",
        "Q: Okay, so then -- so the -- this is where I\u2019d like to get mo -- a little bit more clarity. So after\nthat time your grandmother stays. Your uncles --",
        "A: Uncle.",
        "Q: -- and father are saved by your mother. And it\u2019s by a hair\u2019s breadth, but there they are. Then\ndid they come again for them? Was there a second time when they were going to be put into the\nghetto? Do you understand, 1s --",
        "A: No, I do -- I do --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: I\u2019m trying to figure out how [indecipherable]. Pll tell you what, the house was to -- supposed\nto be Jew free. There was not supposed to be any more Jews in the building, see.",
        "Q: So what happened when that hapunes left without his quarry?",
        "A: Yeah, they -- he took all the others from the apartment.",
        "Q: Okay, but then the rest of you stayed in it?",
        "A: Mama and I and uncle and grandmother, we stayed in it.",
        "Q: So it wasn't Jew free, in reality?",
        "A: In reality, yeah.",
        "Q: Okay. And that\u2019s where you stayed?",
        "A: That\u2019s where we stayed until ... Mama decided it was too dangerous to stay, for me. We got a\nroom Kalinauskas Gatve, in Kalinauskas Street, in an apartment where the owner of the\napartment was a refugee from Poland, from Warsaw. Another room was take --",
        "Q: A Polish Gentile refugee.",
        "A: Polish Gentile refugees. Another room was by a -- also Polish refugee from Warsaw, of\nGerman extraction. And third room was ours. We moved out because you -- y -- it was too da --\ndangerous to be there. It wasn\u2019t easy to get rooms. It was through the help of a Lithuanian person\nwho knew who we are and who helped us to get a room. In those you had the -- you -- that was a\nleftover of Soviet regulations, you had a certain area and you had a person in charge of that area.\nSo he was a person who worked in the administrative office, and he helped us to get a room\nbecause he knew our situation. So that\u2019s where we moved out.",
        "Q: By that point -- excuse me, let me back up a little bit, I want to focus a little bit on your gram\n-- on your father\u2019s family. You had said earlier that your grandfather had been an invalid. By the\ntime 1941 rolled around, was --",
        "A: He wasn\u2019t there.",
        "Q: He was -- he had already passed away?",
        "A: Yeah. He passed away, oh, he -- he passed away somewhere -- I just remember my father\nwearing the black on his sleeve; that was, you know, custom in Europe. I must have been around,\nno more than nine - 10.",
        "Q: Okay, so mid-30\u2019s.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Mid-30\u2019s.",
        "A: He passed away.",
        "Q: And --",
        "A: But in ghetto, in the first time when I came in, in one room we had grandmother, father,\nuncle, his wife, newborn baby, a cousin, her husband, her mother. So we had eight people in a\nroom let\u2019s say like from here to here.",
        "Q: A small room.",
        "A: Eight people in that room, yeah.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Mm.",
        "Q: That\u2019s when we get to the ghetto, but --",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: -- your father had four brothers, one of whom was with you in Vilnius, Solomon --",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: -- with his wife, pregnant.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: And wer -- whe-where were the other two brothers?",
        "A: The sh -- Siauliai brother --",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: -- was in Siauliai with his wife and newborn baby, too.",
        "Q: And his name 1s?",
        "A: Ephrain.",
        "Q: Ephrain was in Siauliai, okay.",
        "A: Yeah, Siauliai. Now, the youngest brother --",
        "Q: Reuben.",
        "A: Reuben had a very strange story. He was betrothed to get married, and in the first day of\ndeportation --",
        "Q: To Siberia.",
        "A: Yeah, in the first day of deportation, they took hi -- the family of -- his fianc\u00e9e and her family.\nHe was getting out of his mind. So he said, I\u2019m going to beg an -- KGB to let me follow the\ntransport. Mama said look, don\u2019t even try. It won\u2019t work. The KGB 1s not going to let you follow\nthe transport. So he said to me, go with me, I know where their offices are, private, not official.\nYou stay on the other side of the street. If 1 don\u2019t come out, so you know that I didn\u2019t come out.\nAnyway, I was waiting across the street, he came --",
        "Q: This is still in Kaunas?",
        "A: Still in Kaunas.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: That was before, the first night.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: So he said they wouldn't even t-talk. No, that\u2019s no and no. So, when the war started, he took\nmy bicycle and he told my mother\u2019s sister that, listen, Pll try, maybe I'll catch up with the train.\nThe trains are not going very fast, they\u2019re overloaded. Maybe I\u2019 Il catch up with my fianc\u00e9e on\nthe train. And from that day on, we never heard anything about him. Later on, somebody told us\nthat he did manage to get to Soviet Union, but whether he found her or not, I don\u2019t know. But he\nnever returned. So, that means --",
        "Q: He disappeared.",
        "A: He disappeared, yeah.",
        "Q: And you never found out what happened to him.",
        "A: No, no, no. I -- I looked at the 16\" division. The 16\" division had all their Lithuanian citizens\nin 16\" division. Nobody knew that he was in divis --",
        "Q: The 16\" division was a Soviet army --",
        "A: Soviet army, 16\" division --",
        "Q: -- partisan [indecipherable]",
        "A: Yes, but he wasn\u2019t there.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. He wasn\u2019t there.",
        "A: So we figured that -- my aunt told him that, don\u2019t take anything, just take the bicycle and go.\nBut he wanted to take some clothing and this and that on -- on my bicycle. So he said look,\ntheyll kill you for the bicycle, don\u2019t take anything, just as -- 1f you can, peddle as much as you\ncan. But we don\u2019t know, you know, what happened to him.",
        "Q: And -- and yet, you say somebody told you that he did make it to --",
        "A: Somebody told as if --",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: -- you know, like as if my father is buried here, or as if my father is buried there. It\u2019s nothing\nthat -- to tie together.",
        "Q: Yeah, not really reliable.",
        "A: Mm-hm, no, no, no, not reliable at all.",
        "Q: What a sad thing.",
        "A: Yeah, sad thing.",
        "Q: Very sad thing.",
        "A: He was crazy when they deported her, just crazy. Well, you know, so, that\u2019s life.",
        "Q: So there are three brothers --",
        "A: Three brothers.",
        "Q: -- and your grandmother.",
        "A: And her, yeah.",
        "Q: And they were all -- except -- except for your uncle in Siauliai --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- everybody was in Vilnius.",
        "A: Everybody was in Vilnius.",
        "Q: All right.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: At this point it might sound a little odd that I ask this question, but it\u2019s been on my mind as\nwe ve been talking. How do you identify yourself? What was your identity?",
        "A: You know, I grew up Lithuanian.",
        "Q: Was there any part of you where you felt Jewish?",
        "A: Not that I felt Jewish, but I mean, I had a lot of solidarity, I had a lot of -- you know, it\u2019s --\nit\u2019s very difficult to define. You stand in the middle of two sides. You don\u2019t take any sides. If it\u2019s\nnecessary you\u2019re here, if it\u2019s necessary you\u2019re here, and that\u2019s how you grow up. I was never\ninfluenced by one side to be against another side. So I -- I really cannot tell you, but I grew up\nLithuanian, but at the same time I have a lot in common with the Jewish nation. I know much\nmore -- when my cousin of the -- the Uncle Ephrain\u2019s daughter, when they finally eve -- returned\nfrom Vorkuta and when he found his family and when she came to visit me, she knew nothing\nabout Jewish customs or anything. I took her to synagogue and she just looked around. I showed\nher, though the custom [indecipherable] everything which we all -- we all know here, she had no\nidea, she grew up in Soviet Union. But at the same time I tried -- we have a very large population\nin West Hartford of refugees from Soviet Union. We don\u2019t call them Jewish, we call them\nRussians. I do a lot for them. And th-that\u2019s -- you know, when my mother went to see f -- Prime\nMinister Kubilunas, and when she came back and she was asking my father, please do not accept\nany official position. Be a private person. Because his military friends wanted him to get out and\nstay in Lithuania, in the states, and forget the thing. And then one day he told my mother, you\nknow what, wh-whichever things were, whichever things are, I see how my nation is suffering, I\ncannot do it. I cannot go into hiding and leave things the way they are in ghetto, because there\nwas a chaos. Can you imagine the Judenrat? Judenrat was a representative of each Jewish\norganization. There were so many [indecipherable] and Bundists and whatever you want, all\nJewish gentlemen with big beards. Can you imagine a German officer coming to talk to them? It\n-- it wasn\u2019t possible.",
        "Q: Is this what your father was saying?",
        "A: It wasn\u2019t possible. They spoke Polish, they spoke Yiddish, they didn\u2019t speak German. And\nthey knew that in the hospital there\u2019s something organized. Working, and working very, very\nwell. He surrounded himself, since we didn't know the Polish Jews, he surrounded himself with\nJews from Kaunas. And they really had a atmosphere of work. The first German request from the\nhospital for so many people, he had a separate section for syphilitics. So, you don\u2019t play God, but\nyou try to do something. So the first German request got the syphilitics.",
        "Q: Do you remember how many people that was?",
        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: Did he talk about it at home?",
        "A: Well, he explained to my mother, that in order to save healthy people, cause the syphilitics\ndidn\u2019t have very long to live one way or the other, and he was afraid to spread syphilis. The\nGermans didn\u2019t know that they were syphilitics, but they -- that\u2019s what Germans received,\nsyphilitics. And that was his idea all the time, to save whatever he can. He believed, which was\nreally very strange, he told to teach the children Hebrew. And the population was aghast, what\nfor? What do they need the Hebrew for, they\u2019re going to die. So he said, they may die, and they\nmay survive. If they survive, where do you think they\u2019Il want to stay, in Vilnius? It\u2019s -- it\u2019s --\nthat\u2019s you -- you know, place of their families? They\u2019ll want to go to Israel. They should stop\ntalking in Jewish, they should learn Hebrew, so if a day comes and God willing they are s --\nliving, they can integrate themselves into the Israeli society. See, he had different ideas from the\nothers. He discussed with the rabbinical committee in -- in ghetto, about how he is doing it.\nBecause naturally they say you cannot play God. But he told them, look, I am giving, for\nexample, 20 li -- li -- documents for life for the hospital doctors. And I don\u2019t know these doctors\nin person, they were all Polish doctors. I lined them up 1n line and I tell the youngest ones, which\nin my opinion, by face and by the physique, look the youngest ones, I tell the 20 come forward.\nSo he says to my mother, how would you think, Elenka? Should I save a young doctor who may\nsurvive and have children, or should I pick out a famous professor who is 80 years old? Now\nwhat would you do in my place? And you know, I was right there during the conversation.\nMama said, you know, I -- I cannot tell you how to behave. But it\u2019s very difficult for my father\nto pick out who lives, who doesn\u2019t live. But in a way, he had his opinion about it, that the\nstrongest will survive, whether survive in ghetto or whether later on in the forest, but you have to\ngive them a chance. Now, what chance can you give an 80 year old professor? See, that was how\nhe was -- how he would [inaudible]",
        "Q: You were part of these conversations at home --",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "Q: -- at age 14- 15.",
        "A: Four -- age 14 - 15, yeah, absolutely, absolutely. We had a lot of these conversations with\n[indecipherable] Panana Simait\u00e9. You know about her.",
        "Q: Can you tell us about her? Who was she?",
        "A: I found out who was she from the Lithuanian press now in Lithuania. There was an article by\nher brother who for the first time said that she was a communist. I do -- I believe I still have the\nnewspaper. Panana Simait\u00e9 was a librarian in Vilnius University. And Panana Simait\u00e9 like us,\nhad a permission to enter ghetto from Major Bourakas, another officer. And he gave her\npermission to enter ghetto as if she\u2019s studying the Jewish old literature. And we met her in\nghetto. She was hiding a group of Jewish people in the attic of Vilnius University library. In\nsummer it wasn\u2019t so bad, but in winter it was awfully cold. Getting food in was one thing, getting\nwaste out was another thing. So Panana Simait\u00e9 regularly, on the clock, was in our place at four\no\u2019clock in the afternoon.",
        "Q: In the ghetto.",
        "A: No --",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: -- that was out. And my father would come for dinner around four o\u2019clock. So shem --\nSimait\u00e9 and my father, they would always get into all kinds of political conversation and this and\nthat. And sure -- I remember one day my father said, you know, I am pretty sure that she is a\nmember of communist party. By her attitude, by you know, her answers and so on. But that\ndidn\u2019t -- that didn\u2019t scare us away. The thing was that Panana Simait\u00e9 used to come and get food\nevery day, and we -- she had such a metal -- metal little, like a bucket. And she would get a\nbucket full of food and carry to the attic, to the Vilnius, that --",
        "Q: And that\u2019s when he was still director of the hospital?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: That\u2019s when he\u2019s already --",
        "A: He was already the head of the ghetto, yeah.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: And that was day after day after day. Why did we start talking about Simait\u00e9 now?",
        "Q: Something -- something jiggled your memory. But we\u2019ll come back to her. I want to go back\nto the other question that I had when I asked you how did you identify yourself, because I had a\nfollow-up question, and that is --",
        "A: Now, I would say I -- I identified myself Lithuanian.",
        "Q: When you saw -- when you saw the chaos in Vilnius and you saw Jews being expelled from\ntheir apartments and Poles standing on the street and making fun, and the Lithuanian\ncollaborators who were there, who were part of this expulsion, not doing it -- I mean actually\ndoing it, not seeming to care very much, did any feelings go through you? Did you ever think to\nyourself, how could they do such a thing? Do they not see what\u2019s going on?",
        "A: I -- I don\u2019t think this was -- this was less because of religion or nationality. I think that would\nbe for a person unbelievable to watch from a point of human attitude. You didn\u2019t have to be a\nJew or a Czech or a French, just to be treated like that. I mean, it was a double -- you know, it\nwas a double, the way I was brought up, in a humane way, to watch that was beyond your\nunderstanding. It\u2019s not just that because the people were Jewish, because they were people. They\nwere not cattle, they were not animals, they were people. To watch people doing that to people,\nthat was very difficult to watch.",
        "Q: I know. But earlier you said, when we were talking about what befell people when the Soviets\ncame in and what befell people when the Germans came in, you were explaining that there was\nthis hatred Jews because there had been some on the streets waving red flags. And as a -- as an\nexplanation as to why there was anti-Semitism, as an explanation as to why there was hatred, and\nfor many people who were not there, who did not live through these times, that kind of\nexplanation seems to hold very little water, exactly for the reason you just said right now.",
        "A: Well, that was po-political, I would say. You see, we didn\u2019t see the night deportations.\nWhatever we heard after mostly was that Russian soldiers were correct. The ones that came and\ntold people pack up your stuff and go into the truck. What we knew, what was going on in the\nbuilding of KGB, that people were tortured, and they found later the traces of it --",
        "Q: But wa -- again, I go back to, why would that be, if the soldiers were correct, then why would\nthis kind of hatred, why would this kind of -- of anger be directed at a Jewish population? And I\nmean in the sense of explanations later, when people are explaining things to themselves --\nyou're sitting in Vilnius and you\u2019re seeing the chaos of what\u2019s happening, and you weren't\nsaying to yourself, oh it\u2019s because they waved red flags when the Soviets were coming in, you\nwere seeing people being dehumanized.",
        "A: This is one thing, but the cooperation didn\u2019t have to be so voluntarily. The cooperation was a\n-- I would say a result of the red flags, of the heads of political personnel --",
        "Q: Whose cooperation?",
        "A: Lithuanian.",
        "Q: Lithuanian cooperation --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- was not so voluntary, are you saying?",
        "A: No, I say -- I say this -- this is what it is. It didn\u2019t have to be so voluntarily.",
        "Q: So you mean --",
        "A: It didn\u2019t have --",
        "Q: -- they wouldn\u2019t have collaborated had they not seen --",
        "A: -- I -- I believe st -- very strongly that the two weeks before that, if the deportations wouldn\u2019t\nbe there, if we wouldn\u2019t have had a whole year of political personnel treatment, of not having a\nright to live where you are, of having everything confiscated of what you ha --\nEnd of Tape Five\nBeginning Tape Six",
        "Q: Maybe I\u2019Il repeat a little of this.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Of a -- you were a person who was integrated into Lithuanian society, who was part of it, and\nwere more familiar with different communities than most people were. And here, all of a sudden\nin 1941, you see a huge inhumanity take place. You see -- you see Lithuanians who you\u2019ve\ngrown up with and you are part of, come and want to take your father away. And others -- even if\nnot those particular soldiers, others who took other people away. And some of them robbed them\nas they were doing it, and pocketed the jewelry and so on. How does one explain that to oneself\nabout the culture one has come from?",
        "A: I don\u2019t believe you can explain. I s -- think maybe you could say what motivated them to do\nit. Motivation can be all kinds, could be greed, could be jealousy. There was no hatred such in\nLithuania per se, there was no hatred. We received our independence from the Polish -- from the\nRussian Tsars regime. Russia is famous. The first pogroms were in Russia. We didn't have a\nword pogrom in our language per se, we didn\u2019t use that word. We never had pogroms in our\ncountry. The Russians were not able to switch that ugly behavior of theirs in our territory. But\nthe seeds probably remained. On one side they lived as neighbors, very well together. Again,\nplease -- I remember that during the Russian Tsars time, the Jewish people were not allowed to\nown land. And the reason they all went into business was not because they wanted to be business\npeople, they were not allowed to work the land. So one came with the other. So naturally, if he\nwas, say, a tailor or shoemaker or he was bringing in his drosken kucher, some kind of\nmerchandise to the farmers, that was the only way to survive. So after so many years of Russian\noccupation, the first one, the Tsaristic occupation, that remains. Now naturally, if you are a poor\nfarmer and you work from four o\u2019clock in the morning til late at night, and ri -- next door your\nJewish tailor is doing a good business sewing and this and that and he doesn\u2019t have to get up and\nmilk his cows and maybe that brought some kind of a jealousy? But we never had incidents in\nour villages, in our towns. We never had a Jewish Lithuanian incidents.",
        "Q: So tell me, when you have the hapunes come by --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- these collaborators --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- come by, what do you think motivated them?",
        "A: Deportations and red flags. Ill sti --",
        "Q: Deportations and --",
        "A: Red flags.",
        "Q: -- and red flags.",
        "A: Yeah. I'll stick to that. Cause I was one of those. It\u2019s -- except that I -- I couldn\u2019t\n[indecipherable] as low as that, but the feeling inside was awful. The feeling inside was awful.",
        "Q: That there were people who would to -- betray your country --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- betray your other -- but why would it ha -- okay, all right, but when you look at documents\nlater, you -- people say that they were all nationalities who are part of this great Soviet\nexperiment, not just the Jewish nationality.",
        "A: No, and I told you before, according to percentage, according to figures, the bigger\npercentage of Jewish population was deported in Lithuania. You see, out of the total.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: There was not 30 percent of Lithuanians deported, but there were 30 percent of Jewish\npopulation deported. So it\u2019s not logical, because actually there were very many friendships in\nSiberia that we Jews helping Lithuanians, Lithuanians helping the Jews, the old way, the way it\nwas before in the country. Because they were all thrown into the same kettle.",
        "Q: Yeah. Okay.",
        "A: So there -- there is no explanation. We can go back to Tsaristic times, to that Tsaristic hatred,\nto Tsarist -- Tsaristic pogroms. But again explain why didn\u2019t we have a pogrom in our country?\nNot a single one. We -- we knew the word, we knew the concept, but we never used the word in\nour language. See, that\u2019s what very strange, wa -- how suddenly -- I have only my personal\nexplanation is deportations and red flags. That really made, you know, the [indecipherable] in a\nvery ugly way.",
        "Q: Thank you. We\u2019ll break right now for lunch and then we\u2019ll come back to the story itself.",
        "A: Mm.",
        "Q: Okay. You know, I [tape break]. Okay, I\u2019d like to get a better sense, even though we\u2019ve\ntalked and -- and touched on this before, of the transition from your father being head of -- the\ndirector of the Jewish hospital to being appointed head of the Jewish police. Can you tell me\nabout the sequence of those events?",
        "A: I mentioned that Mama went to talk to the Prime Minister ku -- Kubilunas and before she left\nshe begged my father not to take any official duties. Not to be tied, so that his name wouldn\u2019t\nfigure anywhere and in case of necessity she could take him out and that\u2019s it. When Mama came\nback, he told her exact words, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, these are my people. I couldn\u2019t refuse.\u201d I mentioned\nbefore that there was a Jewish committee of o -- el-elders and they were not able to grab\n[indecipherable] chaos. People everywhere, people on the street, no food, nothing. They just\nwere completely lost. And they heard that somebody 1s in the hospital and keeps the hospital\nvery firmly, there\u2019s an order. So they came to talk to my father and they begged him, they\nbegged him please, we are out of means, we don\u2019t know what to do. So he took it.",
        "Q: Were you in the room when he said this to your mother?",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Do you remember how you reacted to this?",
        "A: I didn\u2019t react, but Mama -- Mama went pale. Mama went pale. So she told him, well, you\nknow, you did what you decided to do, but you realize that that\u2019s it. There\u2019s no way, now that\nyou'll be known to the Germans, that we can take you out and leave the ghetto. There\u2019s no\nquestion about it.",
        "Q: You were living in the ghetto at the time already?",
        "A: No, we were coming in and out.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: He started right away to organize. People had to be placed somewhere. I mentioned that in a\ntiny room there were eight of his family, and that was very good. People were living 20 next to\neach other. There was no way what to do. He had to find a way how to straighten everything,\nhow to organize food, how to organize cleanliness. Rubbish collection. Can you imagine to\nthrow so many people into one place without anything, no administration? And so he started.",
        "Q: Were the borders already defined of what the ghetto was?",
        "A: Oh, it was boarded up. It was boarded up, there were no borders like in Kaunas, it was -- they\nstarted to board up early in the morning, by the evening everything was boarded up. The\nwindows that faced Vilnius\u2019s streets were boarded too. Every gate, every entrance was wor --\nboarded up. So anyway, he surrounded himself mostly with Jews from Lithuania that he knew.\nBut he asked the elders, please give me a [indecipherable] from Vilnius, from polis -- Polish side\nthat I could work with, because Papa didn\u2019t speak any Polish. Wh-Who in Lithuania spoke\nPolish? Nobody. So they introduced Mr. Dessler. And Dessler\u2019s old family was very known in\nVilnius, very decent family. I cannot -- I cannot tell negative or positive about Mr. Dessler. I can\nonly repeat what people were talking and what my aunt saw.",
        "Q: Your aunt being your mother\u2019s sister?",
        "A: Yeah. I was told by Father, together with Mama, that please do not discuss anything we\u2019re\ntalking about at home where -- when Mr. Dessler is present. And that was enough for us. And\nlater, I don\u2019t know how much there is truth in it or not, people are blaming Mr. Dessler for my\nfather\u2019s untimely death. Nobody knows why they shot him, whether to start the liquidation, they\nfigured with him present would be very difficult to start liquidation. Whether they found out that\nhe\u2019s sending people to the forests. Whether they found out that he knows how to procure guns,\nwe don\u2019t know. We don\u2019t know -- we know from people that he was shot by the chief of the\nGestapo, Neugebauer. We don\u2019t know where are his remains. We were told by people that he\nwas buried in Rasy kapi, the --",
        "Q: That\u2019s right, a cemetery that --",
        "A: Cemetery of [indecipherable]. And they put some plates, glass plates into the place of burial. I\nwent to Rasy kapi, talked to the caretakers, they said they\u2019d never heard of anybody being\nbrought by Gestapo into -- so anyway, there is no place. We don\u2019t know anything.",
        "Q: You don\u2019t know where he was shot?",
        "A: No, no. We know that he was shot at the Gestapo building in Vilnius.",
        "Q: And the Gestapo building in Vilnius was where?",
        "A: [indecipherable]. What was the street name? I don\u2019t remember. If you know where the\nstudents -- students live on the -- on the hill.",
        "Q: Orlando gartay?",
        "A: No, no, no, right in the center of Vilnius. [speaks Lithuanian]",
        "Q: This I wouldn\u2019t know. I mean where is --",
        "A: It\u2019s -- it\u2019s one of the side streets from the main street.",
        "Q: Okay. I thought it was where the KGB building was, too, the same building.",
        "A: Wa -- the same thing, same building.",
        "Q: It\u2019s the same building, then?",
        "A: Same building, right, yeah.",
        "Q: I see, so it\u2019s at LukiSke\u00e9s Square.",
        "A: Befo --",
        "Q: It\u2019s a building -- building near Lukisk\u00e9s Square?",
        "A: But 1 -- co-coming from Cathedral --",
        "Q: That\u2019s [indecipherable]",
        "A: -- going straight, it would be to the left.",
        "Q: Correct, that building.",
        "A: Little street, that\u2019s -- that\u2019s it, that was the --",
        "Q: So that\u2019s the building that your father was shot at.",
        "A: -- that\u2019s the building was shot, right. Now, so he warned us to be careful what you talk, what\nwe are talking at home in his presence. How -- what\u2019s the role of Dessler, I cannot blame\nbecause I don\u2019t know. People didn\u2019t talk very nicely of him. Now, when he -- they introduced\nMr. Dessler to Papa [indecipherable], Father tried to find out more military personnel. He found\nPolish Major Vucht. He found Polish Captain Bagle. He found [indecipherable] Lieutenant\nNikadrasin. Anyway, whoever was from military, he took right away to work. And --",
        "Q: In what capacity?",
        "A: Police. Order. Now, by the way, Captain Bagle, I knew from Papa hundred percent. Father\nhad a walking stick. He had two pieces. One he handed to Captain Bagle, one he kept himself.\nThe historic pictures from ghetto were in these two walking sticks. When I met Vilik, Captain\nBagle\u2019s son, who was my very close friend in ghetto, I met -- met him in New York, my first\nquestion was Vilik, what happened to your father\u2019s walking stick? He said I -- I don\u2019t know. No\nidea.",
        "Q: So the photographs in those sticks --",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: -- from the ghetto?",
        "A: From the ghetto. Papa had a very good photographer who was instructed to historically, in\npictures, to show the life in ghetto. So Vilik didn\u2019t know anything, and Papa\u2019s thing disappeared.\nPll tell you later what I was able to find. So that\u2019s how he started the administration, and you see,\nKaunas and Vilnius had the completely different histories. Kaunas had barbed wire and Germans\ninside and at the gates. Vilnius had no barbed wire, because everything was boarded up. Vilnius\nhad one Lithuanian policemen. If you\u2019ve seen pictures of the ghetto gate, there is one police --\nlittle booth where the policemen stood and saluted my father. So he tried to avoid the fate of\nKaunas ghetto by having Germans stand at the gate, because Kaunas didn\u2019t have forests. Vilnius\nhad big forests in the vicinity and very many Jewish survivors were hiding in those forests. And\nwhen finally it was little bit quieter in ghetto, and people weren\u2019t taken constantly to be shot,\nthese people started to come back to ghetto to survive, because it seemed that it\u2019s nice and\npeaceful. And people didn\u2019t realize that we used to get ration cards only for official number of\ninhabitants. And the unofficial people had to be fed. And how would you feed unofficial people\nwhen it\u2019s not enough for official people? So Vilnius had a completely different situation. Now,\nthrough my father\u2019s connection with Lietukis --",
        "Q: With [indecipherable]",
        "A: -- for so many years --",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: He, for example would get a shipment of frozen potatoes. The Germans would be told that\npotatoes are frozen.",
        "Q: They\u2019re no good.",
        "A: No good for public consumption. The Germans -- and they say, can we throw it to ghetto?\nAnd Germans would say yes, you can throw it to ghetto. That\u2019s how -- but that wasn\u2019t all, you\nhad to feed thousands, it wasn\u2019t in hundreds, it was thousands. So the only thing was to get\nillegally food to ghetto. You must have heard -- and in the -- in -- in writing too, the very, very, I\nwould say rough treatment of people coming back from work at ghetto gates. And you would -- I\nheard myself, standing across the street on the sidewalk, Polish people talking, why do you need\nGermans in here? Look how the Jews are treating the Jews. That was my father\u2019s idea, to make it\nlook so bad that the Germans wouldn\u2019t need to bring either Ukrainians or Lithuanians or\nLatvians to the ghetto gates, because if you would have either one of those people at the gates,\nthese people would die from hunger.",
        "Q: So in other words, what would -- Pll back up just a little bit. As far as anybody else guarding\nthose gates, it was one Lithuanian soldier --",
        "A: He had nothing to do with the gates.",
        "Q: -- in a booth, and that was it. Okay.",
        "A: He was just standing on the side, he had a little booth, and he was stuck in that booth, that\u2019s\nall.",
        "Q: And there were no German soldiers around?",
        "A: No German soldiers. But, by having Jewish police behave the way they behaved, Father\nescaped having Germans at the gate. Now, nop -- I never --",
        "Q: Did you see how they behaved? Did you --",
        "A: Oh, sure I did.",
        "Q: What did they do?",
        "A: Pl -- Pll tell you. Father had meetings of the leaders of the brigade. And the leaders were\nhanded in a plan. If two go through, the third one will be hit. Three go through, the fourth one\nwill be hit. So that, watching from outside you had a picture that the Jewish police is hitting\nreturning workers because they find something. And you would. The two that go through, no\nfood. The third one, food. The three, no food, the fourth one, food. And every week there was a\nmeeting of brigadiers with instructions how to bring food. The only unfortunate case was when\nMueller caught our singer, Luba Levitska. She had a pound of green peas. Green peas, now\nscientifically, has the same vitamins as meat. Mueller happened to come to the gates and he\ncaught her with a pound of peas. And as much as my father tried to get her from Lukisk\u00e9s, if it\nwould have been a Gestapo case, he would be able to smuggle her out. With a Gebiets\ncommissar, the civilian case, he was not able and she wa -- was finally shot. But anyway, there\nwas a system how to get food. Another thing was --",
        "Q: Can I -- I\u2019m sorry --",
        "A: Yeah, go ahead.",
        "Q: -- that I\u2019m stepping back, but I wanted to understand this. The work brigade is told that every\nthird and then every fourth, and every x person --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- is gonna be hit.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And that two should have no food and the third should have food?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: So they find food on that person?",
        "A: No, no, they --",
        "Q: Or it\u2019s the first two have the food --",
        "A: The -- the first two -- the first two are making up, they are getting [indecipherable]",
        "Q: They\u2019re getting food in.",
        "A: -- to the left and to the right, and the third one goes through.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: But the picture from outside, the people that know to count one, two or three, looking from\noutside it looks awful. A Jewish policeman hitting a Jewish worker. And you don\u2019t figure two or\nthree goes through, but main thing is, two get hit, third one brings food inside. Because bringing\nthe food and getting caught was punished. Punished by death.",
        "Q: Okay, so he would catch people who just never happened --",
        "A: Never.",
        "Q: -- to have any food on them.",
        "A: That\u2019s right. And the third one or the fourth one, but there was a plan, they -- they -- the head\nof the brigade knew the plan. Now, for example, the older brigades came on the wide\n[indecipherable |",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: -- it was 1n Polish. If there happened that either Gestapo or Murer was at the gate, Mama\nwould go to one direction, I would go to another direction. We had only three words to tell,\nMurer colo brani. Murer at the gates. Everybody would lower their food on the street, because\nthat meant death, you see. So that\u2019s --",
        "Q: So you were in some ways involved in the bringing of food into the ghetto, in the ver --",
        "A: I-In -- well, not in directly, but --",
        "Q: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: -- warning, warning not to bring food to the gates until it\u2019s clear, you see.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s talk a little bit about how -- how you saw what you did, because that\u2019s a little murky at\nthis point in the story, because what we\u2019ve seen -- what we\u2019ve heard so far 1s that you\u2019re living\noutside the ghetto, your father is appointed head of the police, and we\u2019ve dropped that part of the\nstory. Bring us up to date on what ha -- where did your mother end up living, where did you end\nup living? You -- we mentioned before your grandmother -- your father\u2019s mother and your uncle,\nwhere were you all placed in -- in this geographical scheme of things?",
        "A: Okay. Father had one tiny room.",
        "Q: In the ghetto?",
        "A: In the ghetto. As the chief of police. Next to that tiny room was a door, regular door, to a\nlarge room, where about 30 people lived. Upstairs was one little room. My uncle, his wife, the\nbaby and Grandmother, in one little room. Now, we had an apartment across the street from\nghetto, I would say maybe 200 yards away, Geliy Gatve",
        "Q: Flower Street.",
        "A: That was Flower Street. Now we\u2019re coming to a person I would like to talk about. The whole\narea was in the hand of a Lithuanian Major Narusias. That whole -- whole section, including the\narea where ghetto was. A -- Murer used to come very often to ghetto to check on non-working\npopulation, because there was supposed to be no non-working population.",
        "Q: Tell us who is Murer?",
        "A: Oh Gebiets commissar [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Oh, he was the assistant --",
        "A: Assistant to Hingst.",
        "Q: I see. The -- the --",
        "A: Assistant to Hingst, yeah Gebiets commissar.",
        "Q: [indecipherable]",
        "A: And there was an instruction during the day, whoever didn\u2019t work and had no working\nscheins, not to walk the streets. So not make an impression that there are plenty people who are\nnot workers. But it was impossible in a room like that, there were bunkbeds. In a room like that\nwould be at least 30 people. You had to put them somewhere. Now, Narusias was Papa\u2019s friend.\nSo he went to him and said, look, Stefan, there are buildings outside the ghetto where nobody\nlives. Nobody wants to live to -- th -- next to Jewish ghetto. Why don\u2019t you talk to the Germans,\nexplain to them that these buildings are getting ruined. No heat, water seeps in. Tell the Germans\nthat you would like to attach those buildings to the ghetto area. That proposition costed my father\na lot in gold, in diamonds. But Narusias went to the Germans and he attached a big area to the\nghetto, so that first of all you wouldn\u2019t have 30 people in a room. You had already place to\nbreathe, and you wouldn't see so many people on the street.",
        "Q: Wa -- can you tell me, do you know the particular buildings and the particular streets that\nwere attached? What streets they were --",
        "A: I-If you come -- if you come through the gates, the left side. From the gates to the left, that\nwas the area.",
        "Q: Okay. So it would be -- it would be streets that would go towards the church of Saint Michael\nand Sionta Mykoloyos, or it would be --",
        "A: Oh, Mykoloyos Natan, no.",
        "Q: It would be going --",
        "A: Well, it -- it was bordering Pino Gatve.",
        "Q: I know that.",
        "A: But f-further outside the ghetto wall.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Yeah, I -- I can\u2019t know the -- remember all those names. But anyway, that helped\ntremendously, and that was possible to do only through connections and through old friendships.",
        "Q: And bribery.",
        "A: Oh, sure, what you say. Nobody would do it unless it -- but at least it gave results.",
        "Q: Yes, yes.",
        "A: It gave tremendous results. Now, he still had a problem with food, how to feed the people. So\nhe discussed with Germans the possibility to found more and more workshops. And they agreed\nthat they could have in ghetto a workshop for furniture. They had their own telephone, they were\nnot allowed to use city telephone, and they had all kinds of workshops, and they --",
        "Q: The police had their own telephone?",
        "A: Well they probably --",
        "Q: The ghetto police.",
        "A: -- probably, yeah. Probably had. And the Germans agreed to Father\u2019s idea to take the boards\nfrom one of the door from previous stores, open the store with samples what the Jews can do in\nghetto and what people can come and order to be done. That was another outlet to get foods\nlegally.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Legally, right, I mean --",
        "Q: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: -- they the -- you know, to get food.",
        "Q: That\u2019s right. So they would make things to order.",
        "A: To order, yes, but those people who came, at the same time it had people who had nothing to\ndo with coming for order, they just smuggled food to ghetto. But th -- until one day they caught a\nbig shipment coming at night through the gates. And they requested Father to give the guilty\nparties for arrest. And there were two people in charge of that, Mr. Trapeida and Mr.\nBiniakonski. When Papa called them in, they said commandant, you\u2019re not going to be in charge\nof that. We\u2019re taking the responsibility and we\u2019re going to LukiSkes. You don\u2019t know anything\nabout the transport, you have nothing to do with it, so that in front of Germans your hands are\nclean. So they took Mr. Trapeida and Mr. Biniakonski to Lukisk\u00e9s jail.",
        "Q: So these weren\u2019t part pa -- these weren\u2019t people from the ghetto, these were suppliers --",
        "A: Ghetto -- ghetto -- ghetto people.",
        "Q: These were ghetto people?",
        "A: The Germans requested to give the culprits. Who is in charge -- who 1s in charge of getting\nthat food into ghetto through the gates. So --",
        "Q: Okay, we\u2019re going to have to --\nEnd of Tape Six\nBeginning Tape Seven",
        "Q: Okay, so these two people who were as themselves ghetto inmates --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- went to your father --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- and said, we\u2019ll offer ourselves up, basically.",
        "A: And they told my father that -- they -- they called my father commandant. [indecipherable]\nCommandant, you\u2019re not going to take responsibility, we\u2019re taking the responsibility. They were\nin charge of the food supplies. They said, whatever happens, we go, you stay. They -- Father had\nto bring them, and they were brought to Lukisk\u00e9s. Thank God Father was able to buy them out.\nThey -- all wer -- they suffered was frozen toes. Lukiskes had no heat and the winters in Vilnius\nare very, very --",
        "Q: Cold.",
        "A: -- cold. So they finally got them out. And usually -- 1t was always -- not always, but in many\ncases, possible to buy out from Gestapo arrest, but not from the Gebiets commissariat. Whenever\nthe civil SS -- SA, brown uniforms were involved, like Murer, you couldn\u2019t do anything.",
        "Q: So the Gestapo was more corruptible?",
        "A: Gestapo you br -- corruptible.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: Corruptible, yeah. Now, in the Gebiets commissariat building, you know, there is a proverb\nthat say that world is not without good people. One day Father met a man, he looked familiar.\nAnd then he said, Colonel Keenas. He said yes, but now I am Colonel Kune. Father\u2019s friend from\narmy.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: When the Soviet came, there was repatriation to Germany, whoever could save himself\nfinding an old aunt, and old grandmother from German descent, he went to Germany. And that\nColonel Kune is actually to be thanked for my life and for my mother\u2019s life. Every first of the\nmonth he was issuing my father two permissions, for Mama and for me separately, to use\nLithuanian railway system. You couldn\u2019t go and buy a ticket to buy -- go on the train. Every\nmonth on the [indecipherable] my father would bring us this permission to use the railways. See,\nthat\u2019s all network of Lithuanian officers.",
        "Q: But here I want to come to a point where it\u2019s highly unusual that, in my mind, thinking that\nsomebody who so the head o -- head of the ghetto police would be able to keep his wife and\ndaughter outside the ghetto.",
        "A: Nobody knew. Nobody knew.",
        "Q: Why didn\u2019t they know? How could they not know?",
        "A: They didn't know.",
        "Q: So the Germans did not know?",
        "A: Didn\u2019t know.",
        "Q: Didn\u2019t know he had a wife and daughter?",
        "A: No, no, they didn\u2019t know. One day we were walking on the Pilmo Street together and Weiss,\none of the murderers, was going in a [indecipherable] a horse -- horse.",
        "Q: Drawn carriage, mm-hm.",
        "A: Yeah. And then he said to my father, oh I saw you on the street. Who are these people? And\nmy father said oh, two very old acquaintances. Nobody knew. Until Father was shot, nobody\nopened their mouth.",
        "Q: So even 1 -- di -- did people in the ghetto know that he was married and had a child?",
        "A: Yes. How otherwise I would know everybody? People in the ghetto did, but they would not\nsqueal. That\u2019s why they say that their -- they suspect Dessler, that Dessler squealed after my\nfather was shot. I don\u2019t know. I cannot blame because I don\u2019t know. Now I -- I had a friend in\nGestapo, a Lithuanian in Gestapo uniform, who was a real friend from my childhood, from high\nschool, in sporting events. He never squealed. So what -- the way the Gestapo came after us, it\nhad to be very, very clear information, where we are, where we live, but that stopped in there. I\nmentioned to you that we were about 200 yards from ghetto, across the street. And they came\ninto the apartment, they ripped everything apart. They ripped the floorboards. Whats they were\nlooking for, I don\u2019t know. They were looking for guns, for -- for some kind of written material,\nwhatever.",
        "Q: This is after your father is shot --",
        "A: After.",
        "Q: -- and they\u2019re coming to get you?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: And you were there, you saw this?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: We were given 10 minutes to disappear. Father\u2019s helper came one day and said, Mrs. Gens,\nplease take Ada and disappear immediately. Nothing taken, just walk out of the apartment the\nway you stand, not to throw any suspicion or anything. Mama --",
        "Q: What time of year was this?",
        "A: That was the day he was shot.",
        "Q: What time of year was that?",
        "A: Oh, that was in September.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Yeah. And he said, just disappear. But he didn\u2019t tell that Father was executed. Ghetto knew it,\nwe didn\u2019t know it. We didn't know it for a long time. And my mother\u2019s sister know -- knew it,\nbut she wouldn\u2019t tell.",
        "Q: Okay, so that day you were leaving the apartment, you\u2019re told to --",
        "A: Just walking out into the street. Next day the Gestapo came into the apartment. And how do I\nknow how it looked? Right across the landing was another apartment with a Polish refugee from\nWarsaw who was hiding her son inside the apartment. And our back door, from the back\nentrance, were again, one across the other. So she was watching what the Gestapo was doing and\nwhen my aunt came in, my aunt came in through her apartment, opened the back door, and came\nin with her. They Gestapo kept the person hidden behind the front door for three days thinking\nthat maybe we\u2019ll come in or whatever. But naturally, by that time we were out be -- because of\nthese permissions to use the train, we were able to escape.",
        "Q: Then your aunt came into an apartment which had somebody waiting behind the front door.",
        "A: No, after that --",
        "Q: After that.",
        "A: -- after that, yeah.",
        "Q: After that.",
        "A: You couldn\u2019t do that, that was [indecipherable |",
        "Q: Okay, so in other words, they knew, her neighbor knew, people knew that there\u2019s still\nsomebody standing there for three days.",
        "A: Outside, yeah.",
        "Q: O-Okay.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: If that\u2019s the case that nobody knew from the Germans that you had any connection\nwhatsoever to the head of the ghetto police, how was it that you had permission to go in and out\nof the ghetto? Wasn\u2019t that restricted?",
        "A: [ha -- I mentioned before, was Major Bouragas, again another military friend, issued\npermission to cross the gates. Panana Simait\u00e9 had one, my mother had one and I had one.",
        "Q: And how often did you go in and out of the ghetto?",
        "A: Me?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: I would say I spent more than 50 percent time in ghetto than in outside, because it was safer\nfor me in ghetto than being round up in -- in the town for labor work in Germany.",
        "Q: I see. So as there was ghetto life, there was -- still were roundups within -- outside the ghetto\nwalls.",
        "A: With -- outside the ghetto walls for the ge -- Gentiles.",
        "Q: I see, I see. And the ghetto -- can you just give us this frame, the ghetto existed from what\ndate until your father\u2019s execution and then beyond. Ca -- do you remember the dates?",
        "A: According -- according -- I wasn\u2019t there --",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: -- according to the books that I read, the liquidation started on the 23\" of September.",
        "Q: 19?",
        "A: \u00b043.",
        "Q: Of the ghetto.",
        "A: Of the ghetto.",
        "Q: Okay. And it existed -- 1t was founded --",
        "A: From -- founded, I would say two years. \u201941 - 42 - \u00b043.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: So late summer, early fall, \u201941?",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: And -- and in those --",
        "A: Until exactly 23\" of September, 43.",
        "Q: And 23\" of September is the date you left your apartment --",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: -- and the date your father was shot?",
        "A: We don\u2019t know. We weren\u2019t told.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: You see, we weren\u2019t told for several months. We -- we didn\u2019t know -- had told that Father is\ndead.",
        "Q: Do you remember the last time you saw him?",
        "A: Probably day before.",
        "Q: Anything memorable from that -- from that --",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No?",
        "A: Regular. Mm, you see, so many -- so many things happened in between. There were roundups\nof people in small ghettos outside of Vilnius. While Papa was alive, children were not touched.\nAfter Papa was dead, they took the children. My mother\u2019s sister tried to get my cousin. When it\nwas time to go, the mother wouldn\u2019t give. She said, oh, as long as my -- my father is there,\nnothing will happen to my daughter. Let\u2019s wait. And then when one day they put Ukrainians\naround, you couldn\u2019t get anything out. So then my aunt went to Siauliai, where it was exactly the\nsame story. The mother wouldn\u2019t give her child before, and when my aunt arrived from Vilnius\nto Siauliai the ghetto was surrounded. So she couldn\u2019t save the other child either. She managed\nto do somebody\u2019s --",
        "Q: You mean your -- your --",
        "A: Mother\u2019s sister.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: No, no, you mean your mother\u2019s sister who went, but it was your uncle\u2019s children.",
        "A: U-Uncles\u2019 children, both uncles here and uncles there.",
        "Q: When you had permission -- I\u2019m sorry to go back to that --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- but when you had permission to go into the ghetto, what was the reason for it? What was\nthe ostensible reason for why a Gentile girl who has no connection to the ghetto, would be going\nthere?",
        "A: Who would know that? Just the Jewish people. The Jewish people knew that I\u2019m his daughter.\nI -- how would I know everybody, if I wouldn\u2019t have been there?",
        "Q: No, I\u2019m -- okay.",
        "A: So I mean, the Jewish people, everybody knew. That\u2019s what I said, until Father was alive,\nnobody squealed. We don\u2019t know who squealed after he was killed. We don\u2019t know. And I can\u2019t\nput a finger or anyone, because you don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: What would you do when you would be in the ghetto? What would be your job or your\nfunction --",
        "A: No job, no job.",
        "Q: -- or your activities?",
        "A: We had a group of people that we knew each other very well from Lithuanian, Kaunas area,\nand there were a group of younger -- you know, we were young people. Can you imagine at that\nage, we just finished high school, all of us, and it -- it\u2019s awful. You\u2019re -- you\u2019re -- it\u2019s depressing.\nThere is no way to express -- I -- I don\u2019t know what -- what to say what would I do. I would visit\neverybody. We would stay in groups. There was a lot of things to do in ghetto, there was a c --\nthere were activities that I attended. Papa took me through the pur -- orphanages, through the\nkitchens, you -- you know, with him, to show me how things are going. And then I just would\nsay -- Stay with grandmother, with Papa\u2019s family. That\u2019s -- you wouldn\u2019t do very much. I had\none very, very bad experience when Murer came into the ghetto and Papa managed to sh-shove\nme out from the door into the next apartment, and Murer was checking apartments. I had nothing\non me, no schein, no yellow --",
        "Q: Star.",
        "A: -- stars, nothing. But luckily, he didn\u2019t get into that room. There were oh, at least 30 women\nin that room and pa -- can you imagine if Murer would come in and yi -- Papa would have to\nexplain to them why are these 30 ladies in the room, not working. That was a very, very narrow\nescape. But it -- 1t worked out. And then, you know, I participated a lot. I used to -- you must\nknow that ghetto had a very strong cultural life. I used to bring information about the place they\nwere playing. For example, at the same time ghetto had in Vilnius theater, there was a play called\nZmogus Potilto.",
        "Q: Oh, person under the bridge.",
        "A: A person under the bridge. So I used to bring them sketches and tell how they do that, so that\nthe -- the Jewish production was not worse than the production in Vilnius. And I took musical\nlessons. I continued, I couldn\u2019t go to conservatory because I was warned at the philharmon --\nphilharmonia -- not to show myself. So I took music lessons, I stayed and played, not normal as\nif it\u2019s a normal life. It was the normal, but as much as possible.",
        "Q: But somebody in Vilnius outside the ghetto knew who you were, because through the\nphilharmonic they found out.",
        "A: Yes, somebody did, yeah, somebody did.",
        "Q: Did you -- did you participate aside from warning workers as they\u2019re coming back that Murer\nis at the gate? Was there any other way that you participated in some of these activities to help --\nhelp the ghetto, and help the ghetto in -- inhabitants. Was it through the kitchen, was it through\nother kinds of activities of taking care of some of the old people or -- or -- or such?",
        "A: No. No. I -- I went, I saw, I was -- Papa took me to show, but I didn\u2019t participate in any\nadministrative work.",
        "Q: Did your mother?",
        "A: Don\u2019t forget I was 15 years old.",
        "Q: Yes, it -- anyways --",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: A --",
        "Q: He might have not wanted you to, either.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know, but at 15, what -- I mean, he had the -- the very well trained personnel to do all\nthat. For example, there was no hunger. The children, the orphans were very well kept. They had\nquarters where they lived. Jusef Mushkat was one of Father\u2019s helpers, police member. He was in\ncharge of orphans so that there were no people on the street, sitting or begging or anything like\nthat. And whoever survived the ghetto is a testimony that Vilnius was very well run as far as the\nfeeding, the hospital. They had babies. Under German law you couldn\u2019t have babies. Papa had a\nsection where babies were born, so that ev-everything was done, whatever it was possible to do.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s go back to the time when he was -- still in the very beginning, he was director of the\nhospital and the two children crawled out from the pits of Paneriai --",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "Q: -- and make their way back, and he hides them in this room. What happened to those children,\ndo you know?",
        "A: What happened later?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Later I don\u2019t know, there were thr --I think -- believe there were three ladies --",
        "Q: Three --",
        "A: -- and two children.",
        "Q: Do you know what happened to them?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: Right now I -- no, I don\u2019t.",
        "Q: And did he have such -- you know, and at that point you talked about he had to turn over to\nthe Germans a certain number of people --",
        "A: Yeah, right --",
        "Q: -- from the hospital.",
        "A: -- right.",
        "Q: I take it that must have continued in the ghetto as well?",
        "A: Absolutely, absolutely, absolutely.",
        "Q: And were you -- did he talk to you about these things?",
        "A: Oh, surely. I -- 1 -- you need an outlet. You can\u2019t work under such pressure where human life\nis involved. You -- you have to try to -- to get the best of the wor -- du-during the worst, you\nhave to try to do the best you can, but it\u2019s very difficult. I portrayed to you the selection of\ndoctors. Those selections were going all the time. And they are painful selections, because why -\n- why Joe and not Peter? Why Peter and not Joe? It\u2019s impossible. But one thing which Vilnius I\nthink is famous for, no corruption. You couldn\u2019t buy a life certificate for money. You hear that in\nother towns. You hear that in Warsaw. I\u2019ve heard that in Lodz, reading the books, you cannot\nfind one single case of life certificates sold for money.",
        "Q: There are though -- there is that incident, I think, outside of town, was it Oshmini?",
        "A: O-Oshmena",
        "Q: Oshmen -- Oshmena.",
        "A: Mm-hm, Oshmena.",
        "Q: Where in some of the things that I\u2019ve writ -- I\u2019ve read, it\u2019s written that some of the police\ncame back rather well-to-do. Now, can we ta -- can you tell us about what the whole incident\nwas at Oshmena? What -- how distance 1 -- you know, its geographical distance from Vilnius --",
        "A: In -- in the -- in --",
        "Q: -- and what happened there.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know geographically how many miles, but there were couple of small places -- like\nsmall ghettos, and the Germans, the plan was that they will be brought to Vilnius, to close the\nsmall ones and bring them to Vilnius. And that\u2019s what it was assumed will happen. When Papa\ndidn\u2019t go there, when the police went over there, the Germans told them that these people are not\ngoing to Vilnius and that they will be finished. In those writings -- I read them -- what I believed\nwhat happened, this was the mostly gold pieces, money. The Jewish nation went through so\nmany upheavals and pogroms in Tsaristic Russia, they didn\u2019t keep paper money, they ca -- kept\nmostly golden pieces, golden rubles. And I think those who came back pretty rich, they were told\nby the Germans to collect the bodies, and I think that\u2019s when they got into that. That wasn\u2019t a\nstory with life certificates, that was a story when people were -- made-believe that they\u2019re going\nto Vilnius ghetto and at the last moment they were told that\u2019s what\u2019s going to be then, you not --",
        "Q: So they -- they weren\u2019t shot at Paneriai, they were shot at Oshmena?",
        "A: No, they were -- Oshmena [indecipherable] they did, yeah.",
        "Q: And your father wasn\u2019t involved in any of that, then.",
        "A: Oh, he didn't know. He didn't know. See, they do -- they did exactly the same thing with\nKaunas. Father checked very carefully through Lietukis [indecipherable]. They were going to\nbring a transport to Kaunas. Father checked on the offices of suppliers of food whether it\u2019s really\ngoing to happen, and he was assured by the Lithuanian officials, yes, we had an order for bread,\nwe had an order for potatoes, we had an order for this, for that. This is for that additional\ntransport to Kaunas. And when they were in the Vilnius railway station, Father overheard an old\nPolish railway worker that we\u2019re changing the --",
        "Q: Railway lines?",
        "A: -- rail -- railway lines. So he said, what do you mean you\u2019re changing the railway lines? He\nsaid well, we\u2019re not going to Kaunas, we\u2019re going to [indecipherable] to Paneriai. So at that\nmoment, Father said he understood what\u2019s going on.",
        "Q: And -- and that was?",
        "A: And that was -- I don\u2019t -- you know, it -- it\u2019s been so long, now I don\u2019t remember whether this\nwas -- whether this was the people around the top in Oshmena, or that was another German trick.\nCould be that could have been the Oshmena people who were supposed to go to Kaunas.",
        "Q: How -- how did people in the ghetto, as far as you are able to tell, how did they look at your\nfather? How did they evaluate your father?",
        "A: You know, in ghetto they used to say, look at commandant\u2019s face when he 1s on the street. If\nthe commandant is smiling, you know that no aktions are coming forth. If the commandant has a",
        "Q: Scowl.",
        "A: -- it\u2019s -- yeah, scowl, you know that it\u2019s not good. And I -- I would say that they took\neverything at a stride. They knew that he is trying his best. You -- it\u2019s -- as much as a human\nperson can do, he tried. It -- you know, there was a -- we had a performer. He had a, like a little\nsong, a [indecipherable]. They -- li -- life certificates were white, then they turn yellow, then they\nturn pink, make sure they don\u2019t turn red.",
        "Q: Can you sing the song?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Do you remember it? Do you just remember the words?",
        "A: That -- it\u2019s a -- it\u2019s a jet -- oh yes --",
        "Q: That\u2019s okay.",
        "A: -- but it was in the Russian language.",
        "Q: It\u2019s okay.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: But the -- go --",
        "Q: How does it go?",
        "A: [speaks Russian]. The thing is that Father tried to get from Germans permission to employ\npeople inside. And he told the Germans that he needs some kind of paper to give those people.\nNot the yellow scheins to work outside, but something so that people would have something in\ntheir hands to give them more hope. And the Germans agreed, so they printed the pink scheins.\nAnd they were --",
        "Q: Certificates.",
        "A: Certificates, right. So he tried whatever was possible to keep their spirit alive. At -- it\u2019s not so\neasy. Now, the question of theater, for example. From the beginning it was very, very negative.\nHow can you have theater and concerts in a place which 1s actually a cemetery?",
        "Q: And --",
        "A: Where so many of our people have died, or are being taken to die? But after awhile, I think\nthe human nature wants to look more -- towards more positive and more opportunistically. You\ncouldn\u2019t get a seat in the hall.",
        "Q: Did you used to go to the performances?",
        "A: Absolutely, everyone, absolutely everyone. So --",
        "Q: And was this your father\u2019s idea, to start the theater?",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. The very first -- the very first one was in a room about the size I would say\nlike this, towards that broom, that size. It one -- one of the rooms were the administrative\nbuilding. My mother was so against it, you have no idea, but she couldn\u2019t talk him out of. They\nsaid, look Elenka, we need something to give the people. Let\u2019s try it. And in that room they had\nlike little pieces. One would sing, [indecipherable] Rosenthal, she sang, and the Fima Shapiro,\nMarek Shapiro. Adriana -- little sketch, little pieces. And 1t was tremendous success. But the\nopinion in ghetto was awful, look at that. There were not many, I would say no more than 30\npeople attending, and it was just for the administrative apparatus. And after that he discussed it\nwith other people who were in that line of work before the war and they decided to start. And it\nstarted, and the success was tremendous, just tremendous.",
        "Q: What were your mother\u2019s objections?",
        "A: My mother\u2019s objections? Her objections was exactly the same way. You don\u2019t open a theater\nin a cemetery. She\u2019s -- she\u2019s -- she\u2019s -- figured that it would be too painful for people who lost\nfamily members, which -- which I completely agree. But in retrospect when I look back, I see\nthat that gave people a lot of positive thinking towards the future. You go to a symphony\norchestra, you know, you relax, whichever country you are. Especially in ghetto conditions. Was\na very good symphony orchestra until Luba Levitska was int -- killed. She was a very good\nsinger, and the drama actors were very good. So that it -- it worked out, it worked out to the\nbenefit of people.",
        "Q: In general, I\u2019d like to, in the next tape, talk a little bit more about your mother\u2019s activities\nduring these two years of the ghetto, from 1942 til 1943, but we can keep that for the next tape,\nright?\nEnd of Tape Seven\nBeginning Tape Eight",
        "Q: It sounds from your telling that your mother was still very integral in your father\u2019s life, even\nwhen he moved into the ghetto and she was not known ami -- at least amongst the Gentile, and\ncertainly the ge -- German administration that she is his wife. Was that so?",
        "A: That\u2019s so.",
        "Q: Did he used to come back to the apartment that you had an awful lot? Was he able to?",
        "A: At four o\u2019clock in the afternoon.",
        "Q: Every single day?",
        "A: When the things were quiet, every single day. That\u2019s where Panana Simait\u00e9 would come in at\nthe same time to get her ration of food --",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: -- for the people upstairs, and well, influence. First of all, influence -- first of all, he didn\u2019t\nlisten to her when she begged him not to get involved. That\u2019s the influence ended. Oh well, what\ncan you do it? Otherwise, they always conferred, they always discussed. Whatever was going on,\nthey always discussed. Mama was a very intelligent and clever person, and she -- she felt his\npain, and she felt his inability to do more than he can do. And for a wife to watch her husband\nbeing torn to all sides, it\u2019s very difficult. On one of those awful nights of Oshmena, Mama woke\nup in the morning, her hands were covered with a -- like a scale, from nervous tension. Both\nhands were covered. And she was a very sensitive person, nervous tension. And she could\npredict, in a way, things. And my father was aware of her knowing what 1s going to happen. In\n1939, I believe, there was a reunion of Lithuanian officers in Vilnius. And my father knew that\nMama wanted to see a Talmudist in Vilnius, because in Kaunas everybody was speaking, there 1s\na famous Talmudist in Vilnius. And he told her look, I\u2019m going to the conference, don\u2019t you dare\nto go and see that Talmudist. Don\u2019t you dare. Cause Father was not one of those people that, you\nknow, believes in this or that. When he returned from the conference, he had one look at my\nmother and he said, you didn\u2019t listen to me. You went to see the Talmudist. Now, I don\u2019t know\nhow to explain it, but the Talmudist told my mother everything that happened. They didn\u2019t say\nthe word Germans, but he described the awful things that are going to happen and he told her\nthat in a couple of years after that, she\u2019ll lose her husband. Talmudist had no idea who she 1s,\nwho my father is, that her husband is Jewish. Absolutely no idea. He read Talmud. So when\nFather returned home from the conference, looked at my mother, he knew right away. And\nMother lived with that heavy burden on her chest all these years, from 39 to 43.",
        "Q: And she never told him what he told her -- what the Talmudist to --",
        "A: She did, my father laughed. But he told her, I warned you, please don\u2019t go. Cause he knew my\nmother was a very sensitive person. I told you about the scales overnight. He told her not to go\nbecause to him that was a laughable object. To her, that didn\u2019t disappear. And she lived all these\nyears waiting and expecting something terrible to happen. And Talmudist didn\u2019t know how to\nput it.",
        "Q: It was 1939.",
        "A: 739, yes. But he said, things are going to be awful beyond description, and you lose your\nhusband couple years after that. So you know when you live it was a feeling like this. My mother\nhated the Germans to the point that when we were forced to live in Munich in one apartment, she\nnever talked to the Germans.",
        "Q: This is after the war.",
        "A: After the war. Well, I wanted to go through German consulates to look, maybe I could find\nout something about Weiss, about Murer, about Neugebauer, people that they thought -- she\ndidn\u2019t even want to hear anything about them. Her hatred is not a human hatred. I-It\u2019s difficult to\ndescribe. And when my mother fi -- found out about my father\u2019s death, was already probably 40\n-- end of \u201944. She went to Kaunas from where we were staying, and the landlady of my aunt\u2019s\nhouse didn\u2019t know that Mother doesn\u2019t know. We lived in the hope that maybe he ran away, or\nmaybe -- whatever, but not dead. And she started to, oh, poor Mrs. Gens, oh my sympathy, oh, I\nam so sorry. Mama couldn\u2019t understand what she is talking about. And when Mama finally\ngrasped, she nearly went mad. It was awful. The lady was telling me later, said she hasn\u2019t seen a\nsight like that in her life. Because it was shock plus she finally realized what happened. She\ndidn\u2019t take too much activity in ghetto. First of all, Mama -- I wasn\u2019t afraid, Mama was afraid of\nthe Germans, that can get caught in there. And she would spend time with Grandmother, with\nUncle, and we had very many friends in ghetto, so she would visit. But she didn\u2019t take part in\nany administrative or anything because, as I say, nobody from German part knew that we exist.\nBut she would attend, like I show you the picture, I showed the picture. But even in the picture,\nshe bent down so you wouldn\u2019t see her face. She didn\u2019t want any documentation that there is a\nwife to the commandant.",
        "Q: What happened with your grandmother?",
        "A: They were -- that was the last. That was already after Papa\u2019s death, they were taken all to\nPaneriai.",
        "Q: So your grandmother is in Paneriai?",
        "A: In Paneriai. Now the aunt with a little girl, she tried -- Sala -- Salomon\u2019s wife, she tried to\nsave herself. The girl was adorable. Big green eyes, blonde. She was dressed in a white fur coat.\nTiny girl, two years old. And she put the girl on the ground and she tried to go to the other side.\nSo I talked to survivors and they said that the German officer picked the child, was going around\nto say where is the mother of the child, where is the mother of the child? And th-that Sonia\ncouldn\u2019t stand it, she -- she just broke down. She came to the German officer, took her child and\nwent to the --",
        "Q: To Paneriai?",
        "A: To Paneriai, yeah.",
        "Q: What was the girl\u2019s name?",
        "A: This one? This one was Ivana and the one in Siauliai was Aviva. About the same age, both.",
        "Q: We\u2019ll get to Siauliai in a --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- in another --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- time. So -- and your Uncle Salomon wa --",
        "A: Kloge. Kloge.",
        "Q: So your uncle was deported to Kloge --",
        "A: To Kloge, after Father\u2019s death. And what was interesting, when he was deported to Kloge, the\ntrain went via Siauliai and he was able to write a little note, throw it through the window.\nSomebody picked it up and ran to the ghetto in Siauliai. And the brother in Siauliai came to the\ntrain, he was the head of ghetto in Siauliai. He brought Solomon some clothes, some food, and\nthat was the last the two brothers met. And that\u2019s was -- when Salomon told the Siauliai brother\nthat my papa is dead.",
        "Q: So your -- Salomon knew --",
        "A: SO --",
        "Q: You didn\u2019t know, but Sal --",
        "A: I didn't know sa --",
        "Q: -- but Salomon knew.",
        "A: -- Salomon knew. They didn\u2019t tell us. They didn\u2019t tell. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t even know the\nexact date. We always took the date as 23\"! of September. That\u2019s what we thought, but we don\u2019t\nknow.",
        "Q: When was it -- when was it that you found out? Your mother found out through this lady in\nKaunas.",
        "A: That\u2019s when th -- when we found out.",
        "Q: Tha -- so that you found out the same time.",
        "A: Yeah, mm-hm.",
        "Q: So your mother told you, or this lady -- you were there when the lady was te --",
        "A: No, no, I was in hiding. We were both in hiding. But that\u2019s also already 1944, I believe. So\nthat that was already so far away. Mama went to Kaunas.",
        "Q: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: And that\u2019s when she found out, and then she returned back.",
        "Q: And she\u2019s the one who told you.",
        "A: And she\u2019s the one who told me, yeah. But when she returned back, you know what she did?\nShe sat in one corner, looked into the other corner opposite and wouldn\u2019t move. She wouldn\u2019t\nmove. Nothing mattered to her, nothing.",
        "Q: How did -- what were you thinking? What were you -- how did you react to something like\nthat?",
        "A: I think at my age you don\u2019t react like my Mama reacted. I-I believe that I kind of suspected it.\nYou see, what happened, only the day when they told us to leave the apartment and we went to\nPanana Simait\u00e9\u2019s place, Simait\u00e9 came back and she said, listen, the rumor in Vilnius has it that\nsomebody ran away from Gestapo building and there are guards around the area. So that kept me",
        "Q: Hoping.",
        "A: -- hoping that if whoever escaped the Gestapo building, it would be my father. That\u2019s -- but\nthat took too long, when by \u201944 we haven\u2019t heard, because if he would have been alive there\nwould be a way to -- to let us know or something, so I started to lose my hope. But Mama clung\nto it, that Papa managed to get s -- ge -- escape Gestapo and he is 1n hiding somewhere. He just\ncannot get in touch with us. See, that is -- that was her attitude.",
        "Q: Where did -- where did Mrs. Simait\u00e9 bring you -- or Miss Simait\u00e9 bring you, to get into\nhiding? We haven\u2019t explored --",
        "A: She didn't bring, she didn\u2019t bring. We went to Simait\u00e9. Panana Simait\u00e9 lived in the apartment\nwhich was used to -- as a lodging for people who worked for the university.",
        "Q: She lived in a dormitory.",
        "A: Dor -- like a dormitory, yes. And in same apartment was a lady whose husband was a very\nhigh Soviet official in -- during the Soviet year. And the Germans had a place for all wives and\nchildren of Soviet officers who didn\u2019t manage to take their wives away. They didn\u2019t do anything\nbad to them, but they were segregated from others. It was a house close to Hakapay.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: And she was taken by director of Vilnius University and placed in an apartment with Simait\u00e9,\nillegally. So when we saw her there, Mama said, you know what Panana Simait\u00e9? I don\u2019t feel\nvery safe in here because of her. Because if Germans come after her --",
        "Q: They\u2019 ll find us.",
        "A: -- they\u2019ll discovered us. So Simait\u00e9 walked with us to a wife, Polish wife of another police\nofficer, Mr. Alprin. And we stayed a couple of days with Mrs. Alprin.",
        "Q: So her husband was a ghetto police person?",
        "A: Ghetto police person [inaudible]",
        "Q: But she was a Polish Gentile?",
        "A: She was pol -- Polish Gentile. And after a couple of days, we figured, well th-this is the place\nt-to hide, because we didn\u2019t know to what extent the Germans are going to look for us. So we\nhad the permissions for the train. We boarded the train and we had very close friends of my\nparents, that\u2019s the people whose children were on the echelon to Siberia, and we thought we\u2019ll go\nover there. That\u2019s far away from Vilnius, far away from Kaunas. On the train, when the\ngendarmerie came to check the documents, my mother\u2019s face went white. She didn\u2019t know is it\nbecause they have to check everybody, or just us. And her face gave her away. The Germans\nprobably didn\u2019t notice, but the people --",
        "Q: Next to her.",
        "A: -- sitting next to us noticed. So the man who was sitting next to me turned around to my\nmother and he said very quietly that, Madam, I see that you have some very big problem and\nmay I offer our house in Siauliai until you decide what you are doing? They --",
        "Q: Strangers?",
        "A: Strangers. They didn\u2019t know who am I, who Mama is, or anybody. There was a curfew. The\ntrain pulled out late, ta -- five or six o\u2019clock in the morning, you couldn\u2019t walk. So we spent the\ncouple of hours until the dawn, and the cra -- curfew was away, and he mentioned his name and\nhe said that we have a huge estate, past Siauliai. I\u2019ll take you to the estate and then you\u2019ll decide\nwhat you want to do next. No questions.",
        "Q: So this was a train going from Vilnius to Siaulia1?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: You weren\u2019t going back to Kaunas, you were going to Siauliai.",
        "A: No, to Siauliai, Kaunas was too close. Everybody knew us in Kaunas.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: When we came to the estate we discovered -- well, we knew his name, he introduced himself.\nWe discovered that family who knew who we are, and they gave us, or actually him, a -- a horse\nand buggy and he took us to the estate where we stayed for two years in hiding. The first face,\nwhen I looked down from the buggy was my sport friend, in sports, a member of Lithuanian\nbasketball national team, Shlupas. Uh-huh. I just looked at him, said [indecipherable] what are\nyou doing here? And he says to me, and what are you doing here? He doesn\u2019t know that I am\nhalf Jewish. And this is my mother, he says, Mrs., what are you doing here? So I said -- he was\nnot afraid of me. So I said, I\u2019m in hiding. How would we translate in [indecipherable] the --",
        "Q: Wi -- uh-huh, he was sort of like the village elder.",
        "A: Village elder. The village elder was his cousin, and he needed a place to hide not to be\ninducted into German working force. So he came to his cousin. His cousin sent me to the place\nwhere we were in hiding, and that was the first face I saw. And Mama wasn\u2019t very happy about\nit, but I said, Mama, you don\u2019t expect anything bad from the family Shlupas. It\u2019s too high in our\nsociety to do anything bad.",
        "Q: But she would have preferred someone who didn\u2019t know you at all.",
        "A: Sh-She would have preferred, but I don\u2019t think he knew anything about me besides my name,\nlast name and so on. So that -- to suspect anything, because definitely my mother doesn\u2019t look\nanything like a Jewish person. And he knew me for years, we were together in [indecipherable].\nThe -- the -- the -- we had in Kaunas the [indecipherable] sports --",
        "Q: A sports --",
        "A: -- sports --",
        "Q: A sports facility.",
        "A: -- facilities. So for years we were together 1n sports with him. I knew -- we knew each other\nvery well. So, see that what happen. You never know whom you meet.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "A: So he stayed there for quite awhile with us over there, yeah.",
        "Q: And so this was a se -- you went first to this person who was set on a train.",
        "A: On a train, right.",
        "Q: Saw that your mother was --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- was beside herself.",
        "A: Beside herself, right.",
        "Q: Offered his services.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: But he recognized, or he was able to identify who you were?",
        "A: No, nothing.",
        "Q: Nothing.",
        "A: Nothing.",
        "Q: And then who knew who -- you say when you\u2019re gone to a certain estate.",
        "A: That was, if you know Lithuania, the Venslauskas family.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And they\u2019re the ones --",
        "A: That\u2019s another known family, yeah.",
        "Q: Okay. And they\u2019re the ones who hid you for --",
        "A: We\u2019d stayed with them for awhile.",
        "Q: For awhile.",
        "A: And then he brought us to the estate where we stayed, yeah.",
        "Q: I see, and you stayed out in the country then?",
        "A: In the country for two years, over two years [indecipherable]",
        "Q: And you were then closer to Siauliai than you were to Vilnius?",
        "A: Closer to Siauliai, right.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Before I leave the Vilnius ghetto and talk about Siauliai, I'd like to ask a few other questions.\nWere you familiar with -- did you know about the Resistance movement that was forming within\nthe ghetto? Did you know any of the people who were in it?",
        "A: I knew only enough in case I am caught, not to give the information, because there was\nalways a possibility that Gestapo may find out about us. Father was very, very careful. And I\nknew the fact, I didn\u2019t know the names. I knew, for example, in 1942, Father talked to the\nGermans and explained to them that ghetto has no way to heat the buildings and he asked for\npermission to send Jewish workers in faraway woods to cut the timber and bring it in ghetto, and\nfinally je -- Germans agreed. That was a place where the movement started. A carriage would go\nwith double floor, with people under the double floor, to unload themselves, load the timber and\nthat goes one back and forth. So I -- I spent couple of weeks in that place over there and I knew\nperfectly what\u2019s going on. But 1f you would put me at the wall and tell me I will shoot you if you\ndon\u2019t tell me, I wouldn\u2019t be able to tell. Father was very careful. We --",
        "Q: So you knew perfectly what was going on --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- but you had nothing you could say?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: That sounds --",
        "A: I didn\u2019t know the names.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: You wouldn\u2019t -- you wouldn\u2019t mention the names. I knew the fact because I was spend my\ntime over there, I went with him over there. I knew -- I knew the extent what\u2019s going on.",
        "Q: So in other words, he was also supporting the resistance by doing this.",
        "A: He was -- well, you -- you\u2019ve seen the literature. They have all kinds of -- all kinds of\nopinions. They -- on one side they say that you are supporting, that he was procuring the guns.\nOn the other side they s -- would say that he didn\u2019t want them to leave ghetto, to leave the\nchildren and old people alone, because if you -- let\u2019s say you saved hundred people in wood, you\nleft the others for their own what? They can\u2019t do anything. Children, old ladies, women. He was\nagainst young people completely leaving the old ones in ghetto without any defense. He thought\nthat there should be -- there should be something left.",
        "Q: But it goes against what you were saying earlier --",
        "A: Well, that\u2019s --",
        "Q: -- when he chose the -- the young to live --",
        "A: Ye -- he chose the young to live, but you see, circumstances change, and when you see old\nmothers and mothers and grandmothers and little children and everybody tries to get into the\nforests and leave them behind, I-I don\u2019t think you can stick any more to -- to your ideas that you\nhad before. He was telling them nicely that listen, I am warned by the Germans that if they find\nout who brings the guns, who goes away, the repercussions will be very bad, and they threatened\nthe children. Th -- Papa did everything in his force not to sacrifice the children, and the children\nwere not touched until Papa was alive. He asked them to be careful, and he tried to explain to\nthem that by removing a dozen today, dozen today, dozen tomorrow, we cannot save the ghetto.\nHe wanted to prolong -- you see, the front was moving slowly. It wasn\u2019t as rosy for the Germans\nas it used to be in \u00b041. In \u201943 the situation in the front was already different. He was hoping\nagainst hope that maybe somehow, if he drags the people longer, like in Kloge where my uncle\ndied, the Russians were right there. They came in, the timber was still burning, you see? So he --\nhe just thought that maybe, maybe, if we don\u2019t provoke the Germans, if they leave us alone and\nlet us live the way we are, work, work, work, work, nevermind work, but work, maybe we\u2019 ll\nexpect -- you know, maybe our expectations will take place. Maybe it\u2019ll happen. Maybe the\nRussian army will come closer.",
        "Q: Did he ever have a conversation with you as his daughter of, I may not survive the war?",
        "A: No, never. He knew it very well. He knew that the German could -- a German soldier came\ninto the ghetto area and he wanted to rip a -- Father had a -- a Lithuanian officer\u2019s c -- student --\nstudent -- like we have here, those [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Insignias --",
        "A: Insignia, yeah. And Father didn\u2019t want to give it to him. He pulled out the gun. So, there was\nno way, you know, he had to give it to him. And an officer could have shot him any time, any\nGerman could have shot him any time. We -- we -- we counted on it, we knew it. So, I mean,\nthere was no sense to discuss at all. What sense did it make? We knew the way he -- he lived.",
        "Q: You say that he was very careful to not talk to you about something that could eventually hurt\nyou and hurt others, were you caught, where you would be forced to talk.",
        "A: That\u2019s correct.",
        "Q: And yet, at the same time, every day four o\u2019clock, he\u2019d come back to your apartment --",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "Q: -- and he would share things with your mother. Do you think the same rule applied with her,\nor do you think he went into details with her, because he needed to talk to somebody who was\ntrusted?",
        "A: I would say the same rule. I wou -- I -- I was always there, so whatever I heard, she heard.\nThere was no secrets without me being present. You know, all -- all the effort that he put into\nthat period of life was to prolong, somehow, the survival. Whatever he did was for that one and\nonly purpose. We have no idea, as I told you before, we have no idea what the Germans di-\ndiscovered, or simply they decided that he is the head, he should be removed, it\u2019Il be easier to\nannihilate the others.",
        "Q: So --",
        "A: For example, he built malinas. You know what malina is?",
        "Q: Secret places.",
        "A: Secret places. In charge of malinas were two people, engineer Marcos and Mr. Dellwell. Mr.\nDellwell was from Kaunas. He knew him very well because his daughter was with me in school,\nand engineer Marcos was from Poland. It was in engineer Marcos\u2019 hands to build the malinas. It\nwas in Mr. Dellwell\u2019s hands to supply water and food. This we knew. Mama knew and I knew\nthat they are in charge. I didn\u2019t know where the malina was, but I knew that Father had a plan,\nhad quite a big plan for malinas. And I believe what people told me, that my uncle\u2019s wife and\ngrandmother and the child were in the malina. But the Germans forced people to open the\nmalinas. So some were saved and some were pulled out. But his idea was to do as much as\npossible, to save as much as possible. So it\u2019s -- it\u2019s not like you sometimes read, cooperation,\nwhat kind of cooperation? He would go into [indecipherable] with the Germans. If they would\nsay they want 5,000, he would offer a thousand and the Germans would come down to 3,000, he\nwould s-say 1,500. But he was able, he managed to have that -- I think billing -- being such a\nmilitary nation, the Germans had certain -- I wouldn\u2019t call it respect, but they had a certain\nattitude towards a military posture of my father. He looked a military man whichever way you\nlooked at him, from the left, or to the right. He looked a military man. And when the mail used to\ncome from Gebiets commissariat, mail, they would never write to Jewish, they would write Herr\nJacob Gens. It was unusual to have such a polite form. I think that had a lot to do. And we were\ntold that when Papa went into Gestapo and the army found out, well I don\u2019t know whether that\u2019s\ntrue or not, the army offered Gestapo two --\nEnd of Tape Eight\nBeginning Tape Nine",
        "Q: So your father is arrested and you heard later that the -- that the German army might have -- I\nmean a rumor --",
        "A: Might --",
        "Q: -- that a --",
        "A: There was a rumor that the German army offered Gestapo a tremendous amount of money to\nlet my father go. Not because of sentimental reasons, but he was a organizer of entire product --\nproductive, you know, force for the German army, and army needed it. But unfortunately the --\nHitler\u2019s line was stronger and they --",
        "Q: Well, so what you said earlier about the Gestapo being corruptible, wasn\u2019t always the case.",
        "A: That was not the Gestapo, that came straight from Himmler.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: That came from the up, up, up.",
        "Q: That it\u2019s time for Gens to go?",
        "A: The Jewish solution, yeah. It\u2019s time to finish with the Jews --",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: -- in Vilnius. Time to finish with the Jews. So they didn\u2019t care that army needed them. They\ndidn\u2019t want any more Jews. The only place that they left for time being was the Hakapay at\nKilus. Kilus was producing a fur uniforms for the German lady -- female personnel, and also for\nGerman officers, and later on for German army, what -- as much as they could. And Hakapay\nwas involved in structural work, so --",
        "Q: What is Hakapay, what was Hakapay?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know the German word -- n-name of Hakapay, I can find it. It\u2019s what\u2019s called H --\nHakapay, HKP.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: I -- PIl find out what 1-it meant.",
        "Q: But there was also effort --",
        "A: The Jewish -- they were out of ghetto. They were living separately, out of ghetto, in the\nvicinity where the Russian wives and children of Russian officers were there -- where they were\nthere. And they had the -- they didn\u2019t belong together, they always were separate, and I don\u2019t\nremember which one went first, because I wasn\u2019t there, whether Kilus went first or Hakapay\nwent first, they were not able to -- to save them. So --",
        "Q: So you didn\u2019t know of the details of resistance activity in Vilnius ghetto. Did you know of the\nincident as -- as it happened, of Vittenberg, or Wittenberg?",
        "A: Yes, I knew, that I knew.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: That I knew.",
        "Q: What did you know of that, and what did you see or experience that surrounded the head of\nthe resistance and his --",
        "A: Father warned his people to be very careful with Polish people around. He never trusted the\nPolish people, I\u2019m sorry to say that. One reason was, he didn't know them. Another reason was\nthat he saw too many Jewish people disappear in LukiSk\u00e9s, because the Polish people will give\nthem out. So he said, be very careful. Don\u2019t ever trust a Polish person. I don\u2019t remember the\ndetails now, but somehow Germans, I believe, caught a Polish person and under torture he gave\nname. And the Germans requested to be handed in [indecipherable] yeah.",
        "Q: So this person -- so he gave the name of [indecipherable] Wittenberg?",
        "A: Yes, Wittenberg. It was an awful case because Papa tried to assure the Germans that there is\nno illegal activity in ghetto. Because they were threatening all the time, if we catch illegal\nactivity, that will be the end of the ghetto. Now we all knew that Gestapo had means to torture\nand the -- the Polish man didn\u2019t -- was not able to stand it, Wittenberg wouldn\u2019t be able to stand\nit either. Now if they got Wittenberg and he would start talking, that was very bad for the ghetto.\nI can\u2019t remember who gave him ciancarli.",
        "Q: What\u2019s ciancardi?",
        "A: The very strong poison like Goering took? Goering\u2019s wife.",
        "Q: Cyanide?",
        "A: Cyanide, yeah. Can\u2019t remember now. Even when I read those books years, years ago, I -- I\ndon\u2019t reread them all the time. I can\u2019t remember, but anyway, he was given ciancarlt.",
        "Q: Did you know Wittenberg? Had you seen him ever?",
        "A: Probably. A -- you know Wittenberg, Wittenberg. He -- he -- nobody knew anything, so Mr.\nWittenberg, that\u2019s it. So he wasn\u2019t given a life.",
        "Q: So in other words they handed over a corpse.",
        "A: Corpse.",
        "Q: And how do you know that?",
        "A: Oh that -- that was -- everybody knew that.",
        "Q: So that was written, or that was -- that was at the time.",
        "A: That was at the time, yeah.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "A: But Papa couldn\u2019t afford to have Wittenberg tortured, because then the whole thing would\nslowly come out. The forests, they\u2019re going to the forests with a double bottom to, you know,\ncarriage --",
        "Q: Did he talk about that at home during his four p.m. meetings, you know, when he\u2019d come\nback every --",
        "A: About Wittenberg\u2019s torture --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Yes. It was very, very difficult story for him. But what do you do? You can\u2019t risk -- that\u2019s\nwhat he was trying to tell those people, I cannot risk the entire ghetto because 20 or 30 of you\nwould run to the woods and leave me with a whole -- thousands on my hands, so that you are\ngoing to be free. You see, the situation changed. Situation changed and he saw that there is no\nway -- if Warsaw ghetto, with such tremendous, organized uprising didn\u2019t survive, he knew that\nVilnius can\u2019t -- Vilnius doesn\u2019t have so many ammunition or anything. You -- you can\u2019t -- you\ncan\u2019t survive.",
        "Q: So, but it was an argument then, that he must have had, a very strong argument and a\nlongstanding one with those who wanted to resist, the young people who wanted to resist and\nbelong to that resistance movement.",
        "A: That\u2019s all right? They wanted to resist, and what about the others? What about this -- the\naftereffect? Okay, they would resist, let\u2019s say they would fight for a week. There\u2019s no question\nthat the Germans would send their army and that would be squashed out. But what about the\nremaining ones? What about the remaining ones? Straight to the ovens?",
        "Q: It sou -- it sounds like he was caught in s --",
        "A: He was caught, yeah. What would you do? How -- how would you -- how would you reason\nwith people? He knew that the young ones wants to save -- they want to save themselves, but\nwhat do you do with mothers and grandmothers and so on? Father was counting that maybe one\nday the army, Russian army will come closer, and the Germans will run away.",
        "Q: When did you a -- he sounds extraordinary.",
        "A: I would say not because it\u2019s my father, but I would say that he was extraordinary. He was.\nAbsolutely no fear. Absolutely no fear.",
        "Q: But did he have fear for you and your mother?",
        "A: Yeah. That\u2019s why c-certain things you wouldn\u2019t tell. You -- I would know the facts, but I\nwouldn't know the names. Because, you see, in Kaunas the Nuremberg law was applied right\naway. Somehow in Vilnius, between Polish, Lithuanian and Jews and this and that, it didn\u2019t\ncome on the poles. So --",
        "Q: You mean, you didn\u2019t see these Nuremberg laws pasted --",
        "A: No, pasted 1-1n Vilnius. In Kaunas, yes. And Kaunas had quite a few suicides, when one side\nwouldn\u2019t give the other one away and both would commit suicide. Nothing like that in Vilnius.\nSo -- you know, but you never knew when it will start. That\u2019s why he was always very much\nafraid.",
        "Q: What legacy has he left you? Your father.",
        "A: What legacy?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: You know, he tried to help people. I\u2019ve been helping people since 1947. He never got\nanything for his help. I never ask anything for my help, and I -- I help a lot. I think this is\nsomething that goes through the genes. You are the way you are because of something. You\u2019re\nnot the way you are that suddenly [indecipherable] oh, it\u2019s good to make good, and this and that.\nYou are the way you are. And I believe a lot of that behavior had tremendous influence on my\ngrowing up -- In my growing up years. He used to say -- he had a saying in Lithuanian that\n[speaks Lithuanian here]. In English it would be, the dear Lord is getting old, and doesn\u2019t see\nwhat\u2019s happening on the earth. But he never complained, he never blamed, he just took it in\nstride, whatever the life was throwing at him. And he had a very easy way not to do it. The\nLithuanian officers had the place for him. It was a estate of Pulkanika Skorupskas. Just go and\nstay there. Nobody would know, that\u2019s why Mama was begging him, don\u2019t get any official place.\nWe have a place for you, we\u2019ll wait until the end of the war, and that\u2019s it. But you see, certain --\ncertain forces in your conscience overpower you, and even if he wasn't Jewish up til that time, he\nfelt for his nation, and he -- he wouldn\u2019t budge.",
        "Q: Do you think people have been too hard on him?",
        "A: You want to know my answer? I couldn\u2019t care less. That\u2019s my answer, I couldn\u2019t care less. I\nwould like to have them just sit in his skin and do what he did. Telling you\u2019re going to die,\ntelling you\u2019re going to live. That\u2019s easy on a person? They show in those plays, they show a\nscene, they describe a scene. Father standing at the gate, and the German is letting father, mother\nin to children. And he sees a family coming with three children and he sees a family coming with\none child. And he grabs a kid from the three, throws them into the family with one, hits the father\non the shoulder with his stick and yells at him, what do you do? You left your child behind. Well\nthat story is all over the plays, the books and so on. His mind had to work in all directions. If he\nwouldn\u2019t have noticed that one has one child and the other has three children, the one would go\nthrough and they would take another third child from the next. He had to see everything. It\u2019s not\nso simple. And it\u2019s not so simple to -- to have conversations with the Germans when you have\nhuman blood to count. As I told you, they want 5,000, you offer a thousand. They go down to\nfour, you go up to one -- 1500. These are people, these aren\u2019t just marionettes, and you have to\ndeal with it. So I would like those people who have harsh words to try to be in his skin and see\nhow they would like to do it. That\u2019s why I say I couldn\u2019t care less at all, cause ve seen my\nfather\u2019s reaction and I\u2019ve seen his tremendous effort to do whatever is possible. And he -- in the\ncertain way the effort worked out, quite a bit survived. Not necessarily -- not necessarily in\nVilnius but they survived in Dachau, they survived in Auschwitz. Some survived. So, you know,\nit\u2019s difficult -- difficult to make a judgment. And now what can people -- they judge harsh --\nharsh behavior at the gate. I explained to you the gate. Kaunas had completely different situation.\nVilnius had completely different situation. Kaunas didn\u2019t have to feed the people, we had to feed\nthe people. So, you do something to do it. He had Polish people around, which he didn\u2019t trust.\nKaunas didn\u2019t have it, Kaunas had Lithuanian people. So he had here the Germans on one side\nand he had untrustworthy Poles on the other side. So h-he\u2019s -- find the gold medium. You were\nafraid of the Polish population, which was not friendly at all, not friendly at all. He had an\nagreement with Gestapo. The Jewish person had a Polish family, friends. The Jewish person\nwould leave his gold for the Polish family to save for him. And then one day they would agree\nthat the Jewish person somehow will come in the dark to get some of the gold. And the Polish\nperson would call the Gestapo, and the Jewish person would come in, and pick up the Jew, here\nwe go to Lukiske\u00e9s. And that happened time and again, time and again. So Father made the plan.\nHe offered Gestapo 50 - 50. I'll tell you where the gold is, you take 50, I take 50 percent. No Jew\ngoes to LukiSke\u00e9s, no Jew is shot in Paneriai. You have your share, I have my share for the ghetto.\nYou had to buy food. Food was at exorbitant prices, you needed money. So you figured, what\nI\u2019m losing? One way or the other, the Pole will call Gestapo to get the Jew, the gold will go\nhundred percent to Gestapo. This way at least P\u2019ll have 50 percent for Jewish ghetto. And the\ntreasury in ghetto will not be bare, will have something. Well these people -- these people don\u2019t\nknow it, see? He had to -- it was a Machiavelli scheme, but it worked. Everybody was happy.\nGestapo was happy, and Jewish treasury was happy.",
        "Q: The Pole wasn\u2019t very happy.",
        "A: The -- th-the -- that was not my father\u2019s concern, you see? If the -- if the Polish people kept\nthe same attitude, greedy people, people who were friends before, just because it was financial\nbenefit involved, he didn\u2019t care about it. So you see, things like this, they are not in the books.\nPeople who wrote all those articles were happy to have food. And they were happy when they\nsaw Commandant werk -- walking around the street aw -- in a good -- in a mood. They were\nhappy at that time. Well, he -- he wanted -- he wanted to live, but I\u2019ll you again -- you mentioned\nabout his father in Siauliai, I think if he would have lived, his fate would be even worse than his\nbrother\u2019s in Siauliai, from the Soviet Union side. Because in addition of being the head of the\nghetto, he was anti-Soviet, with all I told you before. So I think if my uncle was sent to Vorkuta,\nhe would have -- probably didn\u2019t even reach Vorkuta. He would be finished before Vorkuta.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s get to Siauliai.",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "Q: How is it that your uncle, Ephrain Gens, got to be the [indecipherable]",
        "A: Coincidence, we didn\u2019t know a thing.",
        "Q: It wasn\u2019t -- it wasn\u2019t in any way --",
        "A: No way. Absolutely not connected. Very energetic, very good looking, tall, blonde, blue-\neyed. Didn\u2019t look like a Jew at all. I -- I saw your picture.",
        "Q: You showed me the pictures.",
        "A: He had -- I showed you the picture. He didn\u2019t look like a Jew at all. Product of Lithuanian\nschools, Lithuanian university. Energetic person. Pru --",
        "Q: When did you learn he was a ghetto police chief? When you were in Vilnius?",
        "A: When we were in Vilnius, yeah.",

        "A: From my aunt.",

        "A: No --",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: -- no, no, no.",
        "Q: Did the brothers ever meet during that time?",
        "A: No, no. The only brother that met [indecipherable] was Salomon on the way to Kloge, to\nEstonia.",
        "Q: So your father and Ephrain, in the times that they each were --",
        "A: Had no idea.",
        "Q: They had no idea --",
        "A: No idea, mm-hm.",
        "Q: -- that the other was the head of the police 1n the other ghetto?",
        "A: Mm-hm, mm-hm.",

        "A: No idea.",
        "Q: When did you learn that he --",
        "A: When I did learn? When he came from Dachau.",
        "Q: So you were still in Lithuania when he came from Dachau.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: And can you give us just a brief kind of overview of what his fate was, what his role there\nwas, and --",
        "A: All right. First it --",
        "Q: And what happened to Aviva?",
        "A: He had to hand it in, children\u2019s section. That\u2019s what my father didn\u2019t live to see. One thing, he\nwas protecting the children. And two, his moral satisfaction. He did not see the handing in of the\nchildren. They were taken out after his death. He was doing everything he could to protect the\nchildren. Every time the Germans wanted the children, he would offer something else. He si --\nhis brother couldn\u2019t protect her daughter. He was commandant\u2019s -- chief of police daughter, so\neverybody knew. He had to ge-get her. What happened? In -- when stut -- Stutthof was liberated,\nthe Russians put German cows -- cows marching through Lithuania to Soviet Union. And they\nput the prisoners from Stutthof in charge of the cows. And if you talk today to people in Kaunas\nmy age, they will tell you how Kaunas looked when hordes of cows were going through our\nstreets further towards Belose. You have no idea. So, his wife was one of those prisoners from\nAuschwitz liberated --",
        "Q: Stutthof.",
        "A: -- Stutthof, liberated, who was put in charge of getting the cows to Soviet Union. Naturally\nwhen they came to Vilnius she ran away -- well, they weren't prisoners any more -- she ran away.\nShe knew where my aunt, my mother\u2019s sister lived, and she came straight to my aunt, and she\ntold us -- she told us everything. She told us how they had to give the child away, and she said\nthat if her husband is alive, they agreed -- cause nobody could even f-fathom what will happen,\nbut they agreed that they\u2019! meet in Lithuania. They\u2019ll look for each other in Lithuania. So she\nstayed with us all the time. She was shaven, her hair started to grow, little by little. And one day\nthe university choir had a concert in Vilnius. We came to Vilnius and I went to visit my mother\u2019s\nbrother.",
        "Q: An uncle.",
        "A: An uncle. And when I knocked at the door and my -- his wife, my aunt opened the door, she\nscreamed in an awful way. I thought, oh my God, what happened, why is she screaming like\nthat? And then I looked deeper and I saw my Uncle Ephrain sitting at the end of second room.\nShe screamed -- and she told me later that she didn\u2019t know how to react. She was afraid of my\nreaction, at the same time she couldn\u2019t control herself. So anyway, he sat in there, 1-in the other\nroom in a German uniform, cause he was six something. They couldn\u2019t find him any clothes after\nDachau so they dressed him in a German army wu -- uniform. Can you imagine, Soviet years,\nwar is still going and I get to the street with a man in German uniform? So anyway -- oh, that\u2019s\nanother thing, how we survived, we have to come back to something.",
        "Q: We will.",
        "A: Anyway, Mama\u2019s ministry of -- I think it was of -- [speaks foreign language here]",
        "Q: Commerce.",
        "A: -- of commerce, commerce ministry had trucks going Kaunas Vilnius. So they gave us a\ntruck. We put my uncle at night in the truck and we transported him from Vilnius to Kaunas.\nNow in Kaunas when we returned -- we had nothing in Kaunas, but my aunt had an apartment.\nBut because we -- we were cut off in the Samogitia place --",
        "Q: Mm-hm, in [indecipherable] mm-hm.",
        "A: -- in -- in Lithuania, there were 30,000 of us were cut off, we returned to kow -- to Kaunas\nvery late. And already in all the poles you could read, if you don\u2019t come back by such and such\ndate, the state will take over your apartments. That meant that wi -- if you are in Germany, you\nran away, we'll take over your apartment. But they gave a chance for the 30,000 to come back.\nSo my ha -- my aunts --",
        "Q: The 30,000 refugees, the 30,000 who were hiding, the 30,000 Jews?",
        "A: The 30,000 who were cut off in Samogitia.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Cut off. You had Russians coming from this side, you are Germans arriving from this side,\nand you had 30,000 Lithuanians trying to get somewhere.",
        "Q: I see, okay.",
        "A: So anyway, my -- my -- ma -- my aunt\u2019s landlady figured that probably my aunt will return,\nso she had no way to save her stuff, but she put her stuff into one room and gave her apartment to\nenkavadair lady worker. The KGB lady worker. So now we can\u2019t show my uncle. It\u2019s one\napartment. You know, you share the rooms, share the kitchen. It\u2019s one apartment. So during the\nday he exactly sat behind a tall wardrobe, without moving.",
        "Q: And the reason why is because he had only a German uniform on?",
        "A: He had a ger -- he had a German uniform, he came from Dachau, explain to her, toa KBG\nlady. In uniform. She had the blue epaulets and everything. So anyway, after awhile of staying in\nthis arrangement, we had no place to sleep. My aunt had only one little couch and one chair that\nyou could open. And there was my uncle, his wife, Maba, Kata and myself, five of us. So they\ndecided that the best thing for them to do would go to Klaipeda. But at that time Klaipeda was\nnot open for private population because it was mined by the Germans when they ran. They\nmined every building. So the Russian forces were going from one building to another --",
        "Q: Clearing it.",
        "A: -- removing the mines.",
        "Q: And this was a harbor town, harbor city.",
        "A: It was harbor city. So they said, when the mining period will be finished, they\u2019ll go to\nKlaipeda. Nobody knows in Klaipeda the Gens name. They realize they cannot stay in Kaunas,\nVilnius or Siauliai.",
        "Q: He had new clothes, I take it, by that point?",
        "A: Hm?",
        "Q: At some point along the way --",
        "A: No. No, not yet.",
        "Q: No?",
        "A: Not yet, not yet, not yet. So that\u2019s what -- what was decided would be the best thing for him\nto do, to move to Klaipeda. And then slowly we started to gather things for him to take with and\nso on, and at one point naturally the clothes had to be changed and the -- but what happened,\nwhen Dachau was liberated, he was appointed a head of German post office in Frankfurt.",
        "Q: How did that happen?",
        "A: Well, he tel --",
        "Q: A former prisoner of Dachau becoming --",
        "A: Yeah, but that\u2019s a -- Germany is no more.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Intelligent person, knew how to work, and he was in Frankfurt am Main, am Oder, that was\nFrankfurt am Oder. He was head of the post office, but then h-he remembered that he made an\nagreement with his wife to meet in Lithuania if they stay alive. So he said nevermind my post in\nthe post office, I\u2019ll go to Lithuania and I'll see maybe I\u2019Il find my wife alive. And that\u2019s, you\nknow, what happened. So we transported him from Vilnius, from my other uncle\u2019s home to do\nthis and later on -- you see that -- that will make me explain to you why we left Lithuania.",
        "Q: Okay, you can do that.",
        "A: We have enough time to do?",
        "Q: We got enough --\nEnd of Tape Nine\nBeginning Tape 10",
        "Q: Okay. So your uncle at Frankfurt am Oder remembers his promise to his wife, that if they are\nalive they meet back in Lithuania. He makes it back to Lithuania only in a German soldier\u2019s\nuniform.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: By a miracle doesn\u2019t get arrested, doesn\u2019t get picked up. Is -- is transported surreptitiously\nfrom your mother\u2019s brother\u2019s, that is your uncle\u2019s from the other side of the family apartment in\nVilnius, to Kaunas --",
        "A: To --",
        "Q: -- and eventually goes to --",
        "A: Klaipeda.",
        "Q: -- Klaipeda.",
        "A: N-Now, [ll explain to you what happened with us. When we returned back from hiding --",
        "Q: And when did hiding end and how did it end for you?",
        "A: Soviet army broke through from Leningrad, Riga, pushed the Germans out, and we were on\nthe way.",
        "Q: And do you remember what it was like seeing the first Soviet soldier?",
        "A: What it was like?",
        "Q: Yeah, well I mean, did you see them? Did somebody come and tell you?",
        "A: Oh sure. No, no.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: We were in the valley.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: On the other side of the valley was a high -- not highway, but a road where the German army\nwas running like crazy, because on the other side of the valley was a hill and you could see\nRussian soldiers, mounted soldiers with binoculars watching what\u2019s going on. So here 1s a\npicture. People in the middle, Germans running away, not letting you on the road, because they\nhad to run. Russians watching the whole scene and shooting with cartouches over our heads at\nthe rush -- at the Germans.",
        "Q: [inaudible]",
        "A: Yeah. Now, these were the Russian troops, the frontier troops. Mama, in her wisdom told us\nlook, we\u2019re not waiting for the 30,000 people to be transported back to Lithuania, we\u2019re leaving\ntonight. As long as we are dealing with frontier troops, they are not going to be -- there won\u2019t be\nany inquisition about our political views. As soon as the Russian troops go out and the civil\ngovernment sets in, we\u2019ll start the same thing as we lived in 1940. Who are you, where are you\nand so on and so on. And Mama was right, as always. So, we asked the Russian echelons of\nsoldiers, trains of soldiers, to help us to go back to Kaunas. We explained that we\u2019re refugees\nfrom the war, from the shooting. So Mama, my unc -- my aunt, who came to join us later in the\nhiding place, they transported us as far as Radvilishkis. On the way there, more people joined the\ntrain and they started to tell that in Radvilishkis, which was already in Soviet hands for quite\nawhile, there is already a KGB checking every refugee, his papers, and asking questions. And\nthose people told us that, you know what? You better get, before Radvilishkis, off the plane,\nwalk --",
        "Q: Off the train.",
        "A: -- off the train, walk to Radvilishkis, go in a half circle and get another soldier\u2019s train, jump in\nto go to Kaunas.",
        "Q: By train do you mean an actual train on tr -- on railway tracks?",
        "A: On railway tracks, yes.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: But the soldiers were coming from the front, back.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: So we did what the people advised us, and we were in Radvilishkis, the three of us. We were\non the street and then I see a man coming towards us. I say Mama, doesn\u2019t he look familiar to\nyou, I just can\u2019t point -- how do we know him? Mama couldn\u2019t remember. And then it dawned to\nme. After going to Palegise it was usually, we used to go to a big estate and spend another month\nin that es-estate, and he was the brother of the owner of the estate. Tall man, looked very much\nlike my uncle from Siauliai. Silver hair, big, tall. So I approached him and I said, do you\nremember me and my mother? He looked at my mother, he said, you know what? I think I\nremember you from year after year staying at that estate. And he helped us to go around\nRadvilishkis. He put us on the next soldier train, and we escaped already the Soviet civilian\nauthorities. Now again the same thing when -- when we approached Kaunas, we told -- we were\ntold get off the train little bit before. When the train stops, don\u2019t go to Kaunas railway station,\nit\u2019ll be even worse. Because Kaunas already in Russian hands for quite awhile. See, the area\nwhere we were was liberated only in the si -- October, and Kaunas was already liberated much\nearlier from the Germans.",
        "Q: So we\u2019re talking October \u201944.",
        "A: \u00b044,",
        "Q: And Kaunas was liberated probably in July or something like that.",
        "A: Somewher -- something like that, you see. So that\u2019s what happened, but we didn\u2019t know what\nhappened to my aunt\u2019s apartment. So we walked to the apartment and that\u2019s what we found. We\nfound that she moved all her stuff to one room, let the [indecipherable] into her apartment, but at\nleast she had one room. In those days Lithuania had the cards for food.",
        "Q: Ration cards.",
        "A: Ra-Ration cards. I entered right away the university. So we had cards better than the regular\nperson. My aunt went back to work, she was a manager of Spodos Fondas. I don\u2019t know if you\nknow Spodos Fondas. It was a huge chain of -- like Plymptons in America. Stationery --",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Oh yeah.",
        "A: Huge chain. She went back to Spodos Fondas. Now Mama started to look for work. Wherever\nshe went, the moment she filled out papers Gens [indecipherable] Mrs. Gens, nothing worked.\nWe had [indecipherable] we had nothing. So, you know, I was pushed against the wall, I said,\nMama, what are we going to do? On my student card and my aunt\u2019s regular card, we\u2019 ll starve.\nIt\u2019s worse than during German occupation.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: There\u2019s nothing to eat. I said, you know what? I\u2019m going to Vilnius. I have to find some\nsurvivors in Vilnius, I\u2019Il see what I can finally find out. To make a long story short, I go to\nVilnius, and I knew that in every institution the Kadros Kiros would be again in the hands of\nJewish people. I go to one ministry, I open the door and were f-five of them standing. They\ncouldn\u2019t believe that I am alive. They said, Ada, you alive? What about mother? Said, Mother is\nalive. Said oh, we all knew that you are dead, both of you. Because we disappeared. See, we\ndisappeared so quick that there was no time even to think otherwise. So I said, look, we are alive,\nyes, but you know, we probably will die from hunger cause we have no money, nothing to sell,\nand how do we survive? So he said, oh, don\u2019t you worry. I said Mama was looking for a job, she\nspeaks perfect Russian, when she men-mentions her last name, nobody gives her work. So one of\nthem said, you know what? Don\u2019t you worry. Mama comes to work for my ministry, Ill he --\nmake her a head of administrative si -- administrative de-department, and I'll keep Mama\u2019s\ndossier under key. And as long as I\u2019m the ch-chief, she -- her papers are in the si -- sealed, under\na key. No problems. When I came back to ha -- Kaunas, Mama said, how did you dare to do\nthat? You know that I don\u2019t want to be a prominent person. I don\u2019t, you know, that I\u2019d want to\n[indecipherable] anywhere. I said, Mama, we have to eat.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: So either or. Either you will be a prominent person --",
        "Q: And we\u2019d eat.",
        "A: -- or we eat.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: And th -- that what we did. Now, one day --",
        "Q: So, which ministry was this part of?",
        "A: [indecipherable] ministry.",
        "Q: Commerce ministry.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Commerce ministry. One day he pays us a visit.",
        "Q: In Kaunas.",
        "A: In Kaunas.",
        "Q: And who was this man?",
        "A: He\u2019s in Canada. Tevya Sheriss. He said, Mrs. Gens, I have to tell you that I am not able to\nkeep your papers under the key much longer, and I would advise you to do something about it.\nShe looked at him and said, what do you mean? He said, I am Polish citizen. I am going to\nPoland, I\u2019m repatriating to Poland, and I would advise you to repatriate to Poland. Mama looked\nat him, said, how can I repatriate? I am Lithuanian. I speak Polish perfectly, but I am not Polish\nand everybody in Kaunas knows who I am. So he said, well, try to think of something. And we\nhad in each location, a Polish repatriating committee. So repatriating committee would check\nyour Polish ancestry, but then Lithuanian KGB had to stamp it. So it wasn\u2019t so simple. So Mama\n-- we went to many places in the area of Vilnius, where nobody knew who Mama is. And we\ntried the Polish committees, to talk to them. They said fine, we\u2019ll do it. Because Mama had\nperfect documents from her high school and from work at the Polish refugee committee from the\nfirst war. And they said -- another thing was, I spoke perfect Polish. So, no Lithuanians in those\nyears spoke Polish. So she -- he -- she would tell, look at my daughter. We\u2019re Polish people. But\nthey said, what about the Lithuanian? You will not go through the Lithuanian KGB. So Mama\ncame back to Kaunas and said, I don\u2019t know what to do. There is no way to get official papers,\nand there is no way af-after he unlocks his [indecipherable] and goes to Poland that they will\nkeep me there. So, I don\u2019t know who was the person to help us, but we went through Polish\ncommittee legally, absolutely. Now there was a question of getting Lithuanian exit stamps.\nSomebody took the papers, somebody did the work and somebody got paid. And in our transport\nwere all the workers of Kaunas theater. Ballerinas and drama, everybody was from the theater.\nAt that time my uncle and his wife were still with us, and Mama said Froizim, how about we try\nthe same for you? And he answered, Elenka, there is no way. I am too -- too -- I -- I would show\nin between those people, I would stand out. I cannot risk. I went through so much, I cannot risk\nto be caught at the border. Because we didn\u2019t know the arrangement, was it enough bribe, not\nenough bribe, will we go through? Because we could have been on one stretch to Siberia,\ncrossing the Soviet border illegally. When we arrived at Suwalki and crossing bord -- crossing\npoint, we see that were two young ladies, they went to -- with big baskets with everything in the\nbasket, to the guards, and we see that they handed the baskets and they returned to the -- there\nwas three trucks -- two buses and a truck. And we see that they are lifting up the -- the -- the big\nwooden plank that crosses the border. We enter Suwalki. We enter Suwalki and now, can you\nimagine, in the whole transport of our people, only Mother and I speak Polish.",
        "Q: And yet everybody\u2019s a Pole repate -- repatriating to Poland?",
        "A: Right, right, to Poland, yes.",
        "Q: That\u2019s a big bribe.",
        "A: Yeah, the big bribe. So anyway, Mama looked around at [indecipherable] we can\u2019t stay here\nvery long, because if they catch -- the Poles -- Pole -- Polish were under the Soviet influence.",
        "Q: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: We can\u2019t stay here very long. Let\u2019s try and get out as soon as possible. But was easy said, not\nso easy done.",
        "Q: So you wanted to abandon all those drama and theater people from --",
        "A: We -- we werte -- yes --",
        "Q: -- Kaunas.",
        "A: -- yes, yeah. Now what happened. My aunt was on the same repatriation paper, there were\nthree of us. And at the last day she said, you know what? I am afraid. I\u2019ll stay, I cannot go.\nBecause 75 percent was doubtful and it looked that we may not cross the border. So she stayed\nbehind. Now, that friend of mine, Mr. Sheriss, before he left he gave us a name and address in\nLodz and he told us look, you get in touch with that person. Do you know what the Jewish aliyah\nis?",
        "Q: Isn\u2019t that transfer to Israel?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Going to Israel.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Yes.",
        "A: From all over the world. He said, she is a liaison for Jewish aliyah and when you tell her who\nyou are, she\u2019|l help you to get out of Poland to other destinations. So we come to L\u00e9dz, we find\nthe address and the lady who opened the door said, oh yes, she was in here, but about couple of\nweeks ago, she went west. That was our only connection in Poland. She went west. Ah, but she\nsays, you know what? There is a doctor from Vilnius. He lives in the same courtyard. Dr.\nRomanofsky. Go and talk to Dr. Romanofsky, maybe he\u2019ll know -- because she is from Vilnius,\nhe is from Vilnius, maybe he\u2019ll know where did she go. So Mama stays in the middle of the\ncourtyard, I ring a bell to Dr. Romanofsky\u2019s door. The door opens up. Mrs. Feigenberg opens the\ndoor, and the German nurse stands behind her. And Mrs. Feigenberg [indecipherable |",
        "Q: A German nurse?",
        "A: Yeah, worked for -- for her husband.",
        "Q: Okay. And this 1s --",
        "A: This is already free Poland.",
        "Q: Free Poland?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: I understood immediately. I was sent to see Dr. Romanofsky and I found Dr. Feigenberg, one\nof the doctors that my father pulled forward to live in the hospital. He couldn\u2019t live -- he couldn\u2019t\nleave vil -- Lithuania, so he bought himself papers of a deceased Polish doctor, Romanofsky,\nwith his diploma and everything and he arrived Poland illegally himself. The Russians wouldn\u2019t\nlet him go, and he lived in that apartment as Dr. Romanofsky. That\u2019s when -- Mrs. Feigenberg,\nwhen she saw me, she almost shouting me not to call her Mrs. Feigenberg.",
        "Q: And there was a German nurse behind her?",
        "A: Working for her.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: She was a German national.",
        "Q: I see, okay.",
        "A: She was working for her husband as a nurse. Not a German for -- but she was a German --",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: -- by -- by nationality. So anyway, you see, that was a split second. If I would have a\nblabbermouth, I\u2019d say, oh, Mrs. Feigenberg, how nice to see you. That would have cut into his\ncareer. So now the Feigenbergs took us in and we stayed more than two months with them. And\nin the meantime the aliyah started working to get us out. Why did we go to Torun? We went --\nwhen we left Lodz, we went to Torun. During the German occupation, when it was quiet in\nVilnius, when they didn\u2019t round up, you know, the young people, I used to take English lessons\nfrom a Polish lady. And then you were -- we got very friendly. Her father was a director of a\ntheater in Toruni. And somehow she\u2019s jokingly told -- said, you know, Ada what -- if you ever\nhappen to be in Poland, if you ever happen to be close to Torun, come and stay with us. I used to\nhelp them a lot. They were afraid to leave the apartment because of the [indecipherable] the --\nthe roundups. I used to go get food for them. So anyway, the relationship was very nice. And\nMama said, you know what? We\u2019re sitting with the Feigenbergs already two months. How much\nlonger can we sit? They were very nice to us. In the meantime, they discovered that Mrs.\nFeigenberg\u2019s deported parents survived Siberia and are on the way back to Poland to join them.\nSo we went to Torun and we started to ask where is the theater. We found the theater and we\nasked, by any chance is Mr. such and such with the theater? They say sure, he returned back to\nhis regular director of the theater. So we went to see -- to see them and we stayed with them for\nawhile. See, sometimes, you know --",
        "Q: That\u2019s right, there\u2019s connections.",
        "A: -- there\u2019s connections, yeah.",
        "Q: Mr. Sheriss, before I remember -- before I forget, how did you know him in Vilnius, was he\nin the ghetto?",
        "A: One of the friends.",
        "Q: He was a friend?",
        "A: A friend of mine.",
        "Q: A friend of yours --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- but was he in the ghetto?",
        "A: In the ghetto.",
        "Q: He was in the ghetto.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: Okay, so you --",
        "A: Well these -- that -- oh, the whole five or six, when I entered the room, they were all my\nfriends from ghetto. And when I told them, look, we have nothing to eat, do something, so they\nsaid, let Tevka do it for you. He can do it. He 1s a big chief and so he did it, yeah. So now we\nwere --",
        "Q: In Torun.",
        "A: -- in Torun, and we followed now aliyah. There was a group, was supposed to go via Austria.\nOur group was supposed to go through five borders [indecipherable]. And we were placed -- we\nwere brought to Berlin with a group of Jewish people and placed in the building for Jewish\nrefugees. And while in that building, next day, Mama said, you know, I don\u2019t feel very good in\nhere. We are in the Russian zone of occupation. The Jewish people are already shu-shu-shu-shu-\nshu-shu-shu, something 1s wrong with me and you. They can see that I\u2019m not Jewish and I don\u2019t\nbelieve it\u2019s safe for us to -- to be in here. The man who was in charge of the group, his wife was\neight months pregnant so he is -- was worried about his wife more than about the group, and I\nsaid Mama, we\u2019ll have to do something, but I don\u2019t know what, let me think. What can we do?\nAnd I found out from the group that in the west Berlin there is a huge refugee camp, but huge,\nfor thousands of people. And they were supposed to be transported to that refugee camp. But\nbefore to get to the refugee camp, you had to go in Berlin through Jewish committee to be issued\na certain ausweis, a paper to show that you are a -- a Jews --",
        "Q: Identification paper.",
        "A: -- .D.. And when Mama went to that place, they look at my mother and said, sorry, you don\u2019t\nlook Jewish. So I hoped that there was -- somebody would be from Vilnius. I said, do you have\nanybody from Lithuania, from Vilnius in here? They said no, we don\u2019t. So there was no way to\nsay that I am Gens widow and daughter and so on, per -- they didn\u2019t know anything. So when we\ncame back I said, Mama, you know what? You stay here. I\u2019ll try to go to the west zone and see if\nI can get into that camp. Because it was too dangerous. We made through so much, so that\nsuddenly, you know -- and I went to the camp, and I figured it\u2019s no sense to talk to some\nemployee. The director was American General Taylor, not the famous Taylor, another General\nTaylor and asked his -- I asked his secretary that I would like to talk to the director. And she\nlooked at me, said well, young lady, you can sit and wait. I don\u2019t know if he\u2019Il be able to see you,\nbut at least you can wait. I did wait probably three hours. I sat in the waiting room, finally he saw\nme. And you know what, it was nothing to hide. I couldn\u2019t lie. I told him the truth. I told him\nabout my father. I told the Jewish alityah has do -- supported us as far as Berlin, but now we are\nstuck. We cannot get Jewish I.D.. So the first reaction he said to me, you know young lady, this\nall sounds like a fairy tale. I said, it sounds like a fairy tale, but this 1s truth. Because there was\nno way out. We were sitting in Soviet zone of occupation. So he said, don\u2019t worry at all. Here are\nthe two stickers. Go and get your mother, get her to the camp and here you go, we\u2019 ll transport\nyou through Hanover to American zone and that\u2019s the end of your problems. Now I come back to\nthe Jewish house. My mother is half alive. The ladies are putting her cold compresses on her\nhead because I didn\u2019t return for so many hours. Mother thought that maybe the-the Russian\nsoldiers got me, or whatever. She is half dead. And I walk in, I says, Mama, don\u2019t say anything.\nWe didn\u2019t have much, I had a rucksack and she had a rucksack, it\u2019s all we had. I said, take your\nrucksack, get slowly dressed and we\u2019re getting out from here. She said, where to? I said, we\u2019re\nall set, we\u2019re going to that refugee camp. So, they didn\u2019t see us walk out, you know, somehow\nyou find a moment when people are in another room, we walked out. And we got to the western\nBerlin and we got into the camp. Naturally the first thing they did was put a DDT behind your\nclothes, but they gave us food, place to live and everything.",
        "Q: So this is the first time that you are not really under any occupation in years.",
        "A: In years, right, yeah. But we -- we were staying in the Jewish house in the Russian zone.",
        "Q: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: See, Berlin was, remember --",
        "Q: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: -- Russian, American, French and British. And a huge, huge truck trailer took us to Hanover.",
        "Q: What part of Berlin was this huge camp? West Berlin?",
        "A: Wa -- wa -- that was in th -- in the American zone.",
        "Q: In Zehlendorf? In -- do you remember?",
        "A: I -- I don\u2019t know whether it was in Zehlendorf. I remember the name Zehlendorf, but I don\u2019t\nknow whether in connection with that or not. It was one tremendous big --",
        "Q: Camp.",
        "A: -- camp. They brought us to Hanover and when we disembarked in Hanover, we were told\nthat\u2019s the British zone of occupation, that the Britishers are returning the bolts and the Soviet\nprisoners of war back to Soviet Union. And that already Soviet prisoners are war -- of war are\ncommitting suicide to the left and to the right because they know that their fate is going straight\nto Siberia. That wasn\u2019t very pleasant because we never expected that Baltic people would be\nreturned to Baltic states. Now, Britishers were as naive as Americans. They figured Baltic states\nare free, you -- you don\u2019t have to be refugees --",
        "Q: Go home.",
        "A: -- go be home. And while we were on the transport, somehow a young man attached to us and\nhe said, you know what? I know somebody in Hamburg. I'll take you there and we\u2019 ll see what\nwe can do further. So we stayed with that lady, afternoon and then we went to the railway station\nand got into the transport of coal, black coal. And we hid in that carriage with coal -- there was a\n-- you know, a transport that had all kinds of merchandise and they had coal in between. And we\nknew that nobody was going to look for us in that carriage with coal, and we went as far as\nMunich.",
        "Q: Wow, clear across the country.",
        "A: We looked like a devil, black. When we arrived Munich -- and you know, this is something\nthat goes from mouth to mouth, a -- a place was called Deutsches museum, German museum.\nThat was a center for all refugees in American zone. They used to come for 1-information and\neverything in that Deutsches museum. A --\nEnd of Tape 10\nBeginning Tape 11",
        "Q: Okay, so now you\u2019re in Munich.",
        "A: Now I\u2019m in Munich.",
        "Q: Covered with coal dust.",
        "A: Covered in coal dust. So we -- we di -- we wer -- were 1n gi -- a Separate room, we\u2019re -- we\nwere directed to a big, huge room with people, but we had food, we had showers, we could wash\nu-up, we could change our clothes, we had alrea --",
        "Q: And you had the stickers from General Taylor.",
        "A: And we had the stickers from General Taylor, right. But that was only half of the story. I went\nout to look for Lithuanians because we were already out of the cl -- not clutches, but out of being\nsupervised by aliyah. Their role was to bring us to west and we were already in west. So I\nstepped into the hole and then right in front of me stood two men speaking Lithuanian. So I\napproached and I said, by any chance -- but you know, that\u2019s a stupid, stupid question. I said by\nany chance do you know where the Venslauskas family is in Germany? So he turned to me, said,\nyou know Panana, what? If you wouldn\u2019t have found us two here, you would never find out\nwhere they are. They are in a tiny farming village, living with a farmer. He said, I can give you\ndirections how to reach them, and you can take a train up to a certain distance, but from that\ndistance you'll have to walk about 10 kilometers.",
        "Q: Oh my.",
        "A: Uh-huh. And there it was winter and I figured, well that\u2019s the only way to reach. And these\nare the people who helped us escape.",
        "Q: They had helped you escape --",
        "A: Remember?",
        "Q: -- when you had to hid -- hide --",
        "A: Hide, and th --",
        "Q: -- in ji -- in Zemaitji.",
        "A: -- that\u2019s the people -- person who took us from the train to his estate.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: So now, okay, I take a train. Mama stays safe now in the west and I disembark. The s -- name\nof the station was Donoverte. Hm, 10 kilometers, 10 kilometers, big deal. You know, you\u2019re on\nskiing five kilometers you don\u2019t even feel it. I start walking. I go, I go, and I see a German\nmilitary camp. And [indecipherable] of the German military camp, you know, you have the s-sip\n-- open doors somewhere, I see German soldiers and the German ladies. So I went as fast I could\naround the camp, and I kept walking and a car stopped. He said, where are you going? Would\nyou like a ride? I said, I\u2019m going to such and such village, the farming village. And he said, who\nare you visiting? I said, I am visiting -- I want to find a Lithuanian family, and I mentioned the\nname. Oh, he said, he lives with one of our people over there, so Pll give you a ride. So he gave\nme the last couple of kilometers. I was already tired. It\u2019s winter, snow. I\u2019m not equipped with\nsnow, any skis or anything. He brought me to the door, I knocked at the door, I opened the door\nand here it is, I\u2019m standing in the doorway and the person who was on the train stands inside of\nthe kitchen. He says to me, you are alive? I looked all over Germany, between the refugees,\ntrying to find you. I said, you didn\u2019t show up to take us away. He was supposed to come with\nhorses, take us away, across.",
        "Q: From where to where?",
        "A: For -- from where we were hiding two years. Their estate was not too far. He was supposed to\ncome in and we waited for him to show up, he never showed up. What happened, he was cut\naway, couldn\u2019t cross any [indecipherable]. The Russians were coming from that side, he couldn\u2019t\nge -- he couldn\u2019t come in. So he knew that we were left behind. So when he saw me there he\nsaid, where are you from? I said, from Lithuania. He said, I don\u2019t believe it. Nobody comes out\nfrom Lithuania now. I says, well, we came, we managed.",
        "Q: And this was already winter of \u201946, of --",
        "A: \u201945.",
        "Q: Winter of 45.",
        "A: \u00b045, yeah.",

        "A: Beginning of -- the end of winter \u201945, beginning of winter \u00b046.",
        "Q: Correct.",
        "A: So I said, where is everybody? Where is Mama, where is grandmother, everybody? He said,\nthey are not too far from here. They are in -- in the refugee camp. And he came with me to see\nmy mother, and then he took me to meet his family, already here, in -- in the west. So now he\nexplained to me the situation, he said now -- now you go to Lithuanian committee, get yourself a\nDP card. I said, what\u2019s a DP card? All I have is from General Taylor, di -- ad -- written notes to\naccept the Lithuanian two women into the camp. He said, oh no, no, no. You go to your\nnationality committee and you get a displaced person\u2019s card. In short, DP card, that\u2019s why the ec\n-- expression depokas.",
        "Q: Did you ever have passports leaving Lithuania? Did you ever any identity papers?",
        "A: I was too young. I was too young.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: I was too young.",
        "Q: Did your mother have a la -- let\u2019s say, any identity papers?",

        "A: But not ta -- saying that she 1s Jewish.",
        "Q: Okay. Just saying that she is Lithuanian.",
        "A: She was Lithuanian. And not Polish, either.",
        "Q: That\u2019s right. So --",
        "A: So now he explained to me that I have to go to Lithuanian committee in Munich and get\nMama and myself DP cards. So I go to the Lithuanian committee, and Mr. Carvalis was the head\nof the committee. He listened to my story and he says, you know what Panana Nela? I knew your\nfather very well. I\u2019d do anything to help you, but my hands are tied. Nobody at this date can get a\ndisplaced person\u2019s card. You are past the period. Finished. Everybody who came from Lithuania\nas refugees, everybody\u2019s set, everybody has a card, everybody is registered. No more cards. And\nI cannot tell now Americans that you just came from Soviet Union via Jewish aliyah. You see,\ntoo many -- too many contradictions.",
        "Q: Too many aliases.",
        "A: Too many aliases. So I said, so Mr. Carvalis, so what do you advise me? He said look, two\nblocks away is Jewish committee. Go to Jewish committee. Carvalis knew my father, said, go to\nJewish committee, tell them who you are and have the Jewish committee help you because the\nJewish people still kept escaping Soviet Union in those days and a lot of refugees came in \u00b046 -\n\u2019A47 - \u00b048, running away from the Soviets. So now I go to Jewish committee and naturally in the\nJewish committee everybody knows who I am. So I said, gentlemen --",
        "Q: They didn\u2019t in Berlin, but they did in Munich?",
        "A: Munich were Lithuanian Jews. In Berlin were German Jews. So German Jews, me telling that\nI\u2019m Gens\u2019 daughter didn\u2019t get anything. Here when they saw me, their approach is, what can we\ndo for you? A different approach. So I told them that I was brought by aliyah, that the lithu -- I\nwent to Lithuanian committee, they cannot help me. They says, what\u2019s the problem? We\u2019ll give\nyou here. We\u2019ll get you a DP card and that\u2019s it. And what they did for us, you know, like in each\nplace there are two classes. They sent Mother and me to Saint Ottilian. Saint Ottilian was a\nGerman sanitory -- or -- or a --",
        "Q: Sanitorium.",
        "A: -- san -- sanitortum for SS officers. So after the war, that sanitortum was taken away from the\nSS, they left some SS doctors working and gave it for the inmates of concentration camp, the\nJewish inmates of concentration camp. And since Vilnius is considered a concentration camp, we\nwere given a status of concentration camp inmates and sent direct to Saint Ottilian.",
        "Q: Wow.",
        "A: We come to Saint Ottilian and the first doctor who looked at my mother was Dr. Berman\nfrom Kaunas. He said Mrs. Gens, how are you? You look like the Jesus Christ crucified. There\u2019s\nnothing left. Mama was awful looking. All that tension, all those borders and everything, drained\nher completely. And Dr. Berman was her doctor when she had pneumonia for the seventh time,\nhe was treating her for pneumonia, he didn\u2019t even expect her to survive. So Dr. Berman did\neverything in his power to put her back on her feet. So we had the most -- most wonderful\nconditions, except that we lived in a palatta, in a -- in a sickroom, I mean if -- a room for\nprobably 20 people at least. But we had wonderful food, and we could relax and the nervous\ntension was gone, you see? And we stayed in Saint Ottilian for quite awhile. But that was only\nfor privileged people. And then --",
        "Q: So that your -- your friends from Vilnius --",
        "A: They put us on the track --",

        "A: They put us with aliyah --",
        "Q: Aliyah.",
        "A: -- with -- the whole way -- you see, we lost connection. We found Dr. Feigenberg, how to\ncontinue the connection --",
        "Q: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: -- and somehow we managed. And we stayed with them very long, until Mama was back on\nher feet. And then we decided that Pll go to Munich and enter university. So when I came to\nMunich and went to the university, they wouldn\u2019t accept people born in \u201926. They were a -- they\nwere having hordes of German soldiers coming from Russian prisoner\u2019s camp, and priority was\nfor the older ones, not for born in \u201926. How much I tried, how much the Jewish committee tried.\nThey said, we don\u2019t make any exceptions to that regulation. So I figured, well, if I can\u2019t go to\nuniversity, I'll go to conservatory. So I went to Munich conservatory, continued, you know, tra-\nla-la.",
        "Q: Music.",
        "A: Yeah. Then they -- they started to talk about registration to United States. We registered to go\nto United States as refugees, but I was past 21, and my quota was very bad. There were\nthousands of Lithuanians, but very small quota. Lithuania was a small country. So I had to wait\nyears for my quota and my mother refused to go without me. So we stayed, and one day a -- do\nyou know Veruch\u2019s reform --",

        "Q: I have a question that [indecipherable] you said at one point when you were in Germany you\nwere looking to see where is Hingst, where is Murer, where is W-Weiss?",
        "A: Mama didn't want me, she was so f -- so against, but I wanted -- I wanted to find out what\nhappened to these people.",
        "Q: Were you able to find out?",
        "A: No, no. I found out later that Murer was arrested by the Soviets, spent several years in Soviet\nUnion, but when he returned back to Austria, they found him not guilty, but at least I think he sat\nfor six years in Soviet camps. Well, that\u2019s good enough.",
        "Q: At least that much.",
        "A: Weiss -- Weiss died in German c -- prison. This is unforgettable things, I shouldn\u2019t have\nlistened to my mother, I should have gotten somehow to Weiss to find out about my father. She\nwouldn\u2019t let me. She didn\u2019t want anything to do with the Germans. And that was the only liaison\nthat could have helped me to find out about him. He may not have wanted to talk to me, but\nmaybe there are some memoirs or something, you know. But Weiss was dead.

        "A: There was a close [indecipherable] where we were staying was a huge Jewish camp, town of\nLandsberg. And there was a big concert in Landsberg. Dr. Feigenberg was one of the chief\npeople in Landsberg, so he told me look, take a train, come to Landsberg. I come to -- it\u2019s like a\nghetto concert. All Jewish [indecipherable] everything, and Dr. Feigenberg came to the door,\ntook me by the hand and marched me to the first row, like I was used to. And I recognized on my\nway, our companions from the Berlin Jewish house. And they\u2019re looking at me and they know\nthat Mama wasn\u2019t Jewish, they could -- they could see it, her blue eyes and everything. And\nthey\u2019re looking at me what I\u2019m doing sitting 1n the first row. The Jewish people had their -- well,\nhow would you say? I remember one expression, Papa tried to match -- if somebody had a\nyellow schein and had no wife, he would match them, not to sleep in one bed, but give a wife a\nchance. He had one of his people who used to be charg\u00e9 d\u2019 affair of Hungary in Kaunas, Mr.\nBrowdig, of a very rich family, and he was given the work as a -- like a minister of foreign\ncountry. And one day we were standing, Mama, Papa and I, Mr. Brownig -- Browdig comes over\nand he says, a -- well, in -- in -- I\u2019ll tell you in Russian, see if you understand. [speaks Russian\nhere] The attached wife of Mr. Glassman sits in the first row, and my wife sits in second row.\nYou see the hierarchy? It was -- in the ghetto it was very important who you are. And during the\nconcert, who you are sat in first row and second row. And then came the [indecipherable]. Pll\nnever forget that. My mother smiled and said, Papa, I\u2019m going to second row. Ill make place for\nBrowdig in first row. [indecipherable]",
        "Q: And she did.",
        "A: She did, yeah. But you see, to be insulted by the fact, could -- my God, you know, first row or\nsecond row. Well, but that existed. So anyway --",
        "Q: You were in the first row and it was a concert.",
        "A: It was a concert exactly like in ghetto, all Jewish faces. Exactly. But then we decided that\u2019s\nenough sitting at Saint Ottilian and we moved to Munich, where I entered conservatory and we\nregistered with the American consulate. During those days of registration and all kinds of, you\nknow, checking of the papers, th-this and that, I opened the door. It was the big caserna, the --",
        "Q: Canteen?",
        "A: -- can -- no, no, army barracks where the immigration process was going on. I opened the\ndoor and I see Mr. Josef Mushkat. I\u20191l show you mush -- Mr. Mushkat on the big picture.\nMushkat was a member of Papa\u2019s higher police, and he was in charge of orphans, orphanage,\ntaking care of them, schooling, feeding, everything that was necessary to do for orphans. He saw\nme, he came over. The first question is, where is Mama? I said, Mama is outside. Cause I came\nto get some information, Mama doesn\u2019t know anything, so she\u2019s outside. So he grabbed me by\nthe hand, we went outside, they both cried. And then Mr. Mushkat says, look, nobody knows me\nhere as Josef Mushkat. I am under a different name and I don\u2019t want them to know that I\u2019m Josef\nMushkat. I said, look, as far as we are concerned, you can be whoever you are. So, I haven\u2019t seen\nMr. Mushkat from that day, any more, cause I had no business going for information, I got what\nI needed. I cannot explain why -- I can\u2019t explain -- I think he got tired to be a Jew. He was\nPolish, high class, intelligent person. Writer. He gave us a book in Polish language that he just\nrecently wrote, and I think he had enough being a Jew and wanted to be a regular Gentile.",

She\nwrote me a letter that, listen Ada, I\u2019m working at the UNRRA in French zone of occupation. We\nbadly need a secretary for the office of communications to work with the director and there is a\nvery big tension between Latvians and Lithuanians. Everybody would like to have that job. The\nproblem is you need French to talk with -- the whole UNRRA personnel is French. You need\nEnglish to get through the directions from Switzerland, that they come in English. You need\nGerman to talk to the German authorities, and you need Polish, Russian, whatever, and\nLithuanian to take care of the refugees. The Latvians have perfect people, no French. Perfect\nEnglish, perfect German, no French. So Lithuanians are asking us do we know anybody that\ncould fill. And we all feel that the only person to fill that place is you. So, I read that letter and\nsaid, Mama, French zone is so far away. We are set in here, we\u2019re waiting for departure. What\nthe hell will I be doing in the French zone of occupation? I\u2019d never --",
        "Q: And the -- the French zone of occupation was in the north, or --",
        "A: Sa -- it -- it -- no, Salzburg. [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Salzburg.",
        "A: [indecipherable |",
        "Q: Okay. So yes, of course, it\u2019s quite far away.",
        "A: Quite far away. And said, I never worked in my life. I don\u2019t know office work. We used to\nhave class magazines, you know, class newspaper, so I would do it with one finger. But we still\nhad a typewriter at home, and the others didn\u2019t. So I said Mama, how can I work? Couple of days\nafter, I get another letter. Two days after, I get a cable. So Mama said to me, look, said, she\nstarted with 20 marks like you -- we did. She already paid for the cable, she paid for two letters.\nSo get a ticket, go over there, explain to them that you\u2019re not able to take the job, you never\nworked in your life. And you\u2019ll see the world and you come back. I -- I come over and they --\nthey tell me the picture. The secretary of communications was expecting a baby in two months.\nThe father of the baby to be was a director of YMCA, Polish nobleman. So now the situation is\nawful. The lady can\u2019t bend down any more, the rumors that the father is a director of YMCA,\nthey want to get rid of her as soon as possible. It shows it very badly during, you know, the -- th-\nthe entire, you know, community. So I told [indecipherable] I spoke to him in French, I said,\nmon colonel, I -- I would li -- take the job gladly, but I have never worked in my life. So he said,\nMademoiselle, please just stay. Whatever you can do, do. Whatever you cannot, not. At least\nstay until we find somebody to fill that place. So that it -- that\u2019s -- that what happened. I started\nto work, I started to work and then I figured there\u2019s nothing to it. I handled the correspondence. I\nhanded the director his correspondence, I can handle correspondence to the others. I see what has\nto be done and I accept, you know, instructions from Geneva in -- in English, I sort them out.\nWhat\u2019s there a -- what\u2019s there to be afraid? And you know, I started to work, I started to work\nand very soon I received an army uniform, and I -- I am a lieutenant of the French army, official.\nSo, my girl -- my lady -- my girlfriend who got me, she was always a civilian, so she can say\nlook, you just came. I\u2019m already here several months and I\u2019m a civilian and you\u2019re\n[indecipherable] army officer. So anyway, I stayed there and one day the director called two of\nus. He said, look, the Australian military mission is coming to round up refugees for Australia.\nTalk to your families and see if any one of you 1s interested to go to Australia. Pll attach you as\nUNRRA officer to the Australians to travel around that area, the whole French zone of\noccupation. And then that\u2019!l help you -- open you the doors in Australia. So I talked to my\nmother, I went to Munich back, and M-Mama said, you know what? Your quota is so far away\nand we\u2019re sitting so close to Russian zone of occupation, why don\u2019t we go to Australia and that\u2019s\nit. And then, later on if we decide that we want to go to America, the quota will follow you. And\nthe Estonian girl, she came back, she said no, my family is not interested to go to Australia, we\u2019 ll\nstay in here until our American priority date comes in. So they attached me to the Australians\nand I traveled with them for a long time, getting refugees processed for Australia.",
        "Q: How interesting.",
        "A: Very interesting. So, not to take too much time for that, I -- when we had out of first ship, it\nwas a 1,800 people on it and you had cream of the crop of UNRRA personnel. Both s --\nHungarians, Romanians, Latvians, Estonians, Lithuanians sent whatever was left over,\nUkrainians, Polish, Russians. And we arrived Australia --",
        "Q: I don\u2019t want to get out of the European --",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: -- continent yet.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, not yet? Okay.",
        "Q: Not yet, because we haven\u2019t talked about Nuremberg.",
        "A: Oh, yes, so Nuremberg, what happened at that concert.",
        "Q: [indecipherable] two minutes, okay.",
        "A: We can start.",
        "Q: Well, in -- in that case -- in that case, let\u2019s finish up when you get to Australia and then we\u2019 ll\ngo back to Nuremberg.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: On the ship I continued in the office processing the paperwork. There\u2019s tremendous\npaperwork because you are crossing Suez Canal. You have to make lists and lists and lists to\nreport to the British. So when we came to Melbourne, and then we were sent to a reception\ncenter -- the same day we arrived reception center, I was put to work for immigration department\nalready in Australia. And our sh -- pol -- the policy to get those refugees was domestics and\nlaborers, domestics and laborers. So everybody hot -- got an I.D., men as laborers, women as\ndomestic servants. I was the only one, because of my Australian cooperation, with Australians in\nEurope, I was given office worker. So I was not a domestic. Two years contract, you do\nwhatever the government says you to do. You go wherever the government sends you to work.\nNo, yes, buts or anything, you just go. Two years over, you\u2019re a free person, do whatever you\nwant.",
        "Q: When you arrived in Australia, how old were you?",
        "A: In 48, 22.",
        "Q: 22.",
        "A: 22.",
        "Q: Boy.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Quite a life until age 22.",
        "A: Oh yeah. Oh yeah, I know.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Don\u2019t wish anyone -- I don\u2019t wish anyone -- so we\u2019 I still have to --\nEnd of Tape 11\nBeginning Tape 12",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: I mentioned -- I mentioned that I went to that -- the concert in Landsberg.",
        "Q: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: In Landsberg they already formed a symphony orchestra and the members were all survivors\nof Dachau. And there were, from Lithuania, the previous members of our Kaunas symphony.\nThey all knew about me and they took me in, just took me in like a mascot. I was the youngest\none, and you know, I ha -- I didn't have anybody but my mother and I felt very secure with them.\nSo one day they told us that, you know what? We have a possibility to go to attend Nuremberg\ntrials, we want to take you with us. I said, fine, why not? Now, I don\u2019t remember a concert\nbefore the trials. I believe they gave a concert. I remember the theater, remember sitting in the\nloge and remember being left by myself, so they must have been on the stage giving a concert.\nAnd they gave a concert in the [indecipherable] uniforms, it\u2019s a striped blue and white.",
        "Q: As -- as concentration camp inmates.",
        "A: [indecipherable] inmates, right. So a day after that, we had a two day pass to the trials.",
        "Q: Did you know who was on trial? Was it widely publicized?",
        "A: That was a big Nuremberg trial, with all of them, Goebbels, Goering, everybody, ger -- they\nall sat in a row.",
        "Q: Okay, that one. Okay.",
        "A: And that particular day, they were trying finance minister Speer. As you know, in a -- in a hall\nwith all military it\u2019s all drab. Uniforms, uniforms, uniforms. I had on a dress that was burnt\norange. Not yark -- not the sharp orange, but burnt orange, but still it stood out in that immense\nplace. And I was telling my children when I came back from that place that the heads of those\nGerman inmates automatically turned to see that s-speck of light, of different color than the drab\nuniforms. Anyway, Mr. Speer was start -- was a -- a -- questioned, and he was told that, did you\nknow -- he was asked, did you know about the concentration camps? And he said no, I never\nknew about that. And then they opened the big screen, and on the screen you could see golden\nframes of eyeglasses, golden teeth, golden jewelry. And they said, how do you think, Mr. Speer,\nyour treasury got all this stuff without you knowing where it comes from? Speer kept s -- not --\nno answer. So that registered in my mind, it was so impressive. Suddenly you opened the screen,\nyou show the picture and he has no way to say any more, I didn\u2019t know. So that was how I ge --\ncame to be in Nuremberg, because that -- the s -- the survivor\u2019s group took me with them for\ntheir concert and then we -- two days in a row we attended Nuremberg trials.",
        "Q: Now, a lot of people have said that Nuremberg trials was victor\u2019s justice, particularly because\nthe Soviet Union was involved. Did you feel that way?",
        "A: No. I think justice was done. Soviet Union or France or -- or whoever, justice was done. I feel\nno remorse about them being punished. Let it be Soviet Union\u2019s influence, so what? So what?",
        "Q: No, no, no, the question was not that the sov -- because the Soviet Union was there, that that\u2019s\na bad thing, because these were really criminals and they should have been. But because the\nSoviet Union itself was guilty of so many crimes against humanity --",
        "A: Yeah, oh, okay.",
        "Q: -- then, it -- di -- it made it a politicized event.",
        "A: Okay, but that came out later. In those days, how much did we know in -- in the west about\nthe Soviet Union? It started with Solzhenitsyn, with his books, with opening our horizon to see\nwhat\u2019s going on in Soviet Union. Just Lithuanians telling that we had three days of deportation\nwas not enough crime. The whole crime, the whole gulags and everything came after that. So in\nthose days we didn\u2019t know about the gulags as much as we know today.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: So I would say that, nevermind what the world 1s telling today, naturally the Soviet Union\nfound another way to kill the people. More humane? I don\u2019t know. Freezing and Siberian tigers?\nIs that so more humane than sitting in a concentration camp and being gassed? Wa -- how would\nyou compare one with the other? There is no comparison, both are equally bad. But --",
        "Q: In other words, that -- that sort of thought didn\u2019t cross -- given that your parents had the\npolitical views that they had, given that your father had -- had spoken out against the Russo-Finu\n-- the Finnish war that the Soviet Union started, given the whole political proclivity that this --\nyour family was not a pro-Soviet family in that you were not happy with the Soviet Union\ncoming in, those thoughts weren\u2019t crossing your mind when you were sitting in the --",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: -- in Nuremberg.",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: You saw that at least --",
        "A: I saw the criminal element who ruined my life, who ruined my mother\u2019s life, who killed my\nfather, who killed millions of people and that was what I thought. Nothing about the Russian\ngulags or anything at that time. Later on we started to compare one with the other, and as I say,\nwhat\u2019s better, to be gassed or to be frozen to death, you don\u2019t know what\u2019s -- what\u2019s better. But\nthe -- in those days, no. I figured that justice was done and they deserved it.",
        "Q: And their -- again, this was only, I believe, 21 or 22 --",
        "A: Right, right.",
        "Q: -- of an en --an entire machinery.",
        "A: Right, right. Papa used to talk about Mr. Murer. He was of impression that Murer was a drug\naddict. He said that there were days when you could talk to him like to -- talking to normal\nperson, and there were days when he went berserk, you couldn\u2019t talk to him. And he thought that\nthe withdrawal symptoms when he didn\u2019t have drugs, were main reason when he was so\ninhuman. That was my father\u2019s opinion because he said it\u2019s impossible to have the same person\nbehave this way and that way.",
        "Q: The -- erratic.",
        "A: Erratic, right.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: He would come into the room and he would start, up, down, on your knees, up, down. Don\u2019t -\n- do -- he made workers jump up and down for no reason. So Papa got suspicious that --\nsuspicious that he must be under influence of drugs, because he could compare Murer with the\nothers. Nobody behaved like Murer, nobody. He was a single person with such bestiality. And he\nsaid, well one day he\u2019ll pay for it. But you see, six years is not much. Six years is not much.\nWell, Soviet gulag for six years 1s quite a bit, but it\u2019s not much. And then to be exonerated by\nAustrian authorities? And it\u2019s strange because Austrians were always believed to be more away\nfrom Hitler, not such supporters of Hitler. He turned out to be very, very supportive of Hitler. So\nnow that\u2019s how I got to Nuremberg [indecipherable]",
        "Q: So those were the two days that you --",
        "A: The two days. We spent -- I think we spent more than two days, but I mean, one day for the\nconcert, then two days we spent in the trials.",
        "Q: But it wasn\u2019t -- and you also sa -- mentioned at another point that you were on your way to\nAustralia at some point afterwards, but that wasn\u2019t your first destination. Didn\u2019t you say --",
        "A: No, America.",
        "Q: -- the altyah. The altyah to Israel.",
        "A: Oh, I -- oh, you -- yeah, to Israel, you see, what happened, it was Palestine. Some people\nmanage -- probably you had to have big money -- managed to get it -- exact wording is | --\nlanding permit. A permit to enter, legally, Palestine. I was talking in the Jewish committee, I said\nlook, for all that Papa did, try to get Mother landing permit. I don\u2019t care about myself, I can go\nwith aliyah. I don\u2019t -- I\u2019m not afraid of difficulties or whatever, but not my mother. She went\nthrough too much, physically. She can\u2019t go with aliyah. And they tried. They tried, but they\nexplained to me, you need the big money to be able to procure a landing permit, or you have to\nbe very, very famous figure. But not many people have received a permit. And I was to be on\nthis boat. I believe that was the Exodus boat. If you remember the story of Exodus, I was\nsupposed to be on that boat, but when they couldn\u2019t get Mama landing permit, I said, I\u2019m not\ngoing alone and I\u2019m not leaving my mother in Germany. So, since there is no way to get her, \u2019'm\njust resigning and I\u2019m not going to go by myself. That was the only reason why I didn't go,\nbecause a lot of my friends were already in Israel and we had family in Israel from before. So I\ndidn't mind going, and Mama didn't mind going, but not in her physical condition. She was --",
        "Q: Did she speak much about your fath -- you said that at some point she just stopped.",
        "A: Stopped.",
        "Q: Did she talk much about her life with your father, after the war?",
        "A: No. Not much, no. I -- I don\u2019t believe -- I don\u2019t believe she was able to. I remember when we\nwere in hiding, some days we did things around the house and Mama liked to take birds, geese,\nducks, into the fields. She said that gives her peace of mind, not to talk to people, she can talk to\nthe birds. And that would quieten her down. Cause I told you, she would sit in one corner, looked\n-- look -- look at another corner. She took it much harder than anyone I have seen. Much harder.\nAnd well, she was preoccupied with my children because I had a big number of children. She\nhelped me to raise the children.",
        "Q: But it must have been very difficult for you to see that and know that there was very little you\ncould do to relieve it.",
        "A: I couldn\u2019t. And that\u2019s what it was, you know, I tried -- I tried my best. Look, I pulled her -- it\nwas through [indecipherable] of let\u2019s try, let\u2019s go, let\u2019s do, let\u2019s do, but she -- I think the reason\nthat we left, she was afraid. Not for herself, she was afraid for me. That\u2019s the only reason why\nshe agreed to try and risk crossing the -- we crossed probably five borders. First one was to\nPoland. Next one was to Berlin. Next one was to American side of Berlin. Next time to Hanover,\nand then to Munich. Five borders. And it\u2019s not so simple. Today when we speak, it seems like\nnothing. It wasn\u2019t so simple. I forgot to tell you, when I mentioned to you that we were leaving\nLodz with aliyah, my aunt remained -- my mother\u2019s sister remained in Kaunas. She gave up, she\nsaid she was too scared and she stayed. And then, couple of days after we left, she figured out\nthat she can\u2019t stay by herself, she wants to join us. So she went to the Polish commission and she\ntold them the story and she said now, can you help me? So they said fine, we\u2019ll do now\nsomething different. We had --",
        "Q: Did she speak Polish?",
        "A: Yes. They said, we\u2019ll give you a copy of the original repatriation document, but it has two\nladies and the youngster. You take a lady with her daughter, instead of your sister and your\nniece. And that was one of our known young ballerinas and her mother. So they traveled on the\nrepatriation document budreika a-and she brought them to Poland. Now, on the way, since we\nknew each other and she -- she was helping the Jewish people very much, when she came to\nBerlin, the same story with aliyah, she doesn\u2019t look Jewish. So the -- our Jewish people got her\non aliyah same way, and aliyah brought her to Germany.",
        "Q: Can you speak a little bit about her? We haven\u2019t talked much about her role in the war, and so\nwe\u2019re going back. But you said she worked closely with Ona Simait\u00e9.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "Q: How was she involved in the rescue of Jews, or how was she involved in Ona Simait\u00e9\u2019s\nwork? How did -- how --",
        "A: Tatta --",
        "Q: -- how -- what role she play?",
        "A: -- Ta-Tatta knew Simait\u00e9 through us.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: She was in Kaunas, Simait\u00e9 was in Vilnius. I knew from discussions with Tatta, several\nnames in Kaunas of people who helped Jewish people. I don\u2019t believe there was a connection of\nKaunas people with Vilnius people, there was no connection. And Simait\u00e9 was connected to\nTatta through us. And Tatta did whatever sh -- was in her abilities to help Simait\u00e9. Sh -- Tatta\nworked more in Kaunas, where there was a group, and all these people were Russian nationals in\nLithuania. They were Lithuanian Russians. There was Dr. Kutraga. There was -- you know, it\u2019s\ndifficult -- the lady, she had a beauty -- beauty salon. Her -- her -- her son was in our basketball -\n- what was it, playing [indecipherable] I'll -- ?\u20191l remember the name. Anyway, I knew the first\nnames of some of them, and these people really did at most that was possible to do. Pulling out,\ngetting places to live, getting places to hide. It was a very well organized group.",
        "Q: And were any of them caught, as far as your knowledge was concerned?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No.",
        "A: Simait\u00e9 was the only one that was caught.",
        "Q: And do you know the circumstances of her capture?",
        "A: No, because we weren\u2019t there. Tatta -- Tatta remained in Kaunas when we went into hiding\nand then one day she told us that Onos neera, Ona isn\u2019t any more here. So we understood. So\nafter I found out that she was very brutally beaten up, she was thrown into concentration camp,\nbut we didn\u2019t know whether she s-survived or not. She never looked back. She never looked\nback. And later, from the press, I found out that she was in France and that she went to visit\nIsrael, but they think climate didn\u2019t work for her. She returned back to France and she died in\nFrance. And then when I found her brother\u2019s article about her, I realized that she was who she\nwas, a being that you couldn\u2019t put on higher pedestal that she was, but she was also a communist.\nWell, which -- nothing to do with it.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah. But Tatta was cooperating with Simait\u00e9. I -- I wouldn\u2019t give you any details because I\nreally don\u2019t know how they did it, what they did, but I know that she helped her carrying the\nwaste, getting food, you know, things like that. Course Tatta was mostly spending her time in\nKaunas and then she would come to Vilnius, stay with us and what -- help with Simaite\u00e9.",
        "Q: Your uncle when he returned from Dachau, you said earlier that he didn\u2019t speak much about\nwhat had happened in Siauliai in the time that he was the ghetto police chief --",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: -- but that he did talk about Dachau. Which --",
        "A: He talked about Dachau, talked about his experience over there. He talked about the\nconversations they used to have, the inmates, what would the conversations be about.",
        "Q: And what were they about?",
        "A: And he said that most conversations were fantasies, what we would like to eat. What we\nwould like to be served. And he said that at one point it was really tough. Somebody said that he\nwould like to have some herring, and the pain, not being able, was so obvious that people were\ntelling him, shut up. Don\u2019t mention it any more, we don\u2019t want to hear it. See, y-you\u2019re deprived\nfor so long that even mentioning it makes it bitter -- bitter memories.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: But he never complained. And in his first letter that I received it, that was very interesting\nhow I found him. He wrote in his first letter that morally I am not broken at all, but physically, I\nam finished. HIAS looked for him, Joint looked for him. All those, you know, the bort -- the --\nthe -- the notices, everybody. Nowhere. Disappeared completely. So one day I got a letter from\nHIAS. We found --",
        "Q: And HIAS is?",
        "A: Hebrew aid -- aid -- like -- like Joint, same thing.",
        "Q: All right.",
        "A: They\u2019re two different organizations both -- both being the same thing. We found trace of your\nuncle. Get in touch with such and such person in Israel and you\u2019Il get more information. So what",
        "Q: And this is about what year?",
        "A: Oh, that was quite a bit after. Must be \u00b056. Must be \u201956 because I remember we were able\nalready to send parcel. When the Polish repatriation started in Soviet Union, they let the inmates\nfrom gulags join the families outside, repatriate to Poland. One of those families on the way, the\nfather joined from the gulag and the father was telling stories with whom he was in gulag and\nhow it was in gulag. They came to Poland and from Poland with aliyah they reached Israel. After\nthey reached Israel, very shortly after, the father died from heart, he was overworked in gulag.\nNow, those people probably went to HIAS to join to look for their relatives, whatever. His son\nsaw my uncle\u2019s name on the board, looking for, do you know about him. And happily, he\nremembered that his father was mentioning my uncle\u2019s name during his stories from gulag. So he\nreported to HIAS that all I can tell you is that my father was in such and such camp together with\nhim. And that must have been already the time when they started to let them go from gulag.\nLiquida --",
        "Q: So you didn\u2019t even know he had been in the gulag until that point.",
        "A: No, no, he disappeared from the ground of the earth. And they sent -- I mentioned to you that\nmy aunt had to hide that her husband 1s in Vorkuta. She didn\u2019t know exactly where, but she had\nto hide, and she told that he found another woman, he left her and he is somewheres with that\nwoman in Soviet Union. And then when finally he was released, they found each other. There is\nsomething that I don\u2019t recall. I know that somebody somehow was found through my uncle in\nMontevideo. Whether he wrote to Montevideo, whether Mother\u2019s brother wrote to Montevideo,\nbut somehow members of the family got together through Uruguay, but I don\u2019t recall now which\none. So anyway, when he returned, she told that he doesn\u2019t want that other woman any more, he\nreturned to the family. Now the aunt, what happened when they arrested him in Klaip\u00e9da, she\ngrabbed her daughter, same way like Mama and I, and disappeared. She knew that it\u2019s -- next 1s\nher turn, they -- she disappeared. And as much as we all looked for her, Mama\u2019s brother went\nthrough every nook and nook, wherever you could think to look for her and he wrote exactly, she\ndisappeared from this earth. [indecipherable] there\u2019s nothing else I can do, I can\u2019t find her. So\nlater on we learned that she had acquaintances in Moscow, she went to them. They sent her to\nMoldavia and she was living in Moldavia. She was a very intelligent person. She got a job as a\npostmistress. [speaks foreign language here]. That was her address. Until he returned, and he told\nus that when he saw how she lived, it broke his heart. In all those letters, I have so many letters\nfrom him, he described the misery, the conditions in that [indecipherable] unbelievable. And he\ndidn\u2019t have anything. So when we found each other -- I believe he must have written to\nMontevideo.",
        "Q: To be able to trace her back.",
        "A: To trace -- no, to trace us.",
        "Q: Oh, I see.",
        "A: To trace us. That was the way how we found each other later. I mean, I got the -- from HIAS\nthat he is alive, but I couldn\u2019t trace him in Moldavia. I believe he wrote to Montevideo, to\nMama\u2019s brother, cause we knew all these addresses by heart. And that\u2019s --",
        "Q: Did you ever see your uncle again?",
        "A: No. He died. I see s -- I -- I went to s-see his wife, his her -- Elana, her daughter, but not him.\nSo after I mentioned to you -- I show you the pictures, you saw his face. So physically he said he\nwas gone. Vorkuta pulls the last strength of your body, and that\u2019s the underground work.",

        "Q: So he never left the Soviet Union?",
        "A: He never left the Soviet Union, no. But Sonia and aha -- so Elana\u2019s -- how did Elana get out?\nHer husband was Polish citizen. He was Ukrainian, from that. So the way to -- or sh -- or they\nleft when it was let my people go. That could have been. I think that was how the -- that let my\npeople go time, and they left for Israel.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "A: And when I went to Israel, I found more of my father\u2019s relatives. Distant cousins, closer\ncousins, they couldn\u2019t believe that I am alive. In Lithuania everybody thought that we are\nfinished there, we don\u2019t exist any more. It was such a surprise to see me alive.",

        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: -- this view, this insight, this glimpse into a part of what was a catastrophe and how people\nlived through that catastrophe.",
        "A: Yeah, people -- people can take quite a dose. People can. If you have an optimistic outlook\nand if you are not looking, you know, half full, half empty. If you look at half full, that helps.",

        "Question: Well, this morning we are conducting an interview with Ada Gens Ustjanauskas and\nfollowing her life story. Thank you very, very much, Mrs. Ustjanauskas for coming and talking\nto us. This is going to be a very broad story with many different components, and many different\npeople who are in it. It will be a -- a glimpse into at least what happened with one person in a\nvery tough part of the world, in Lithuania. And I would like to start, as we often do, at the very\nbeginning. I\u2019d like to find out about your background, where you were born, the family you were\nborn into, the details about your early life. So let us start with that. Where were you born?",
        "Q: And 1s that a village or a town?",
        "Q: And where is it close to?",
        "Q: And your birth date 1s?",
        "Q: And where was your mother coming from?",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: Can you tell me a little bit about -- first of all, Smalininkai was still a Lithuanian territory\nvillage or town, 1s that correct?",
        "Q: It was a border town --",
        "Q: -- but it did not belong to Germany\u201d?",
        "Q: Okay. And was it -- can you tell me a little bit about the -- the border was to what part of\nGermany?",
        "Q: Prussia.",
        "Q: Prussia, okay. Then let\u2019s go back to Jurbarkas. What did -- what kind of a place was that?",
        "Q: Was it close to Kaunas?",
        "Q: Was it close to [indecipherable] city? No?",
        "Q: So you don\u2019t have any memories of --",

        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: So what did they do?",
        "Q: But you went from Montessori school to a German kindergarten?",
        "Q: We\u2019ll come to your schooling in a little while --",
        "Q: -- I'd like to come back to that. But your first memories are of this Montessori school.",

        "Q: So it wasn\u2019t the of-official name of the school --",
        "Q: -- it was the unofficial name of the school.",
        "Q: Let me take -- stop at that moment for a moment, because that begs a lot of questions, and\nthen we\u2019ll go back a little bit.",
        "Q: And th -- because the question, the first one is, how is it your family could afford it? And then\nthe question that comes after that is, who was your family? So let\u2019s go back to mother and father.\nCan you tell me a little bit about your mother? Who she was, where she was born, what her name\nwas, what her family was like. And the same then for your father.",
        "Q: How many brothers and sisters did she have?",

        "Q: Was she the youngest, the oldest?",
        "Q: How could that be afforded if her father had left her mother with four -- three, four children\nand -- and had -- and had gone to Montevideo? How could the family afford --",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: Which war?",
        "Q: Back in Lithuania?",
        "Q: In Latvia.",
        "Q: Well, excuse me, I must go back to the other question.",
        "Q: When you say it was the Tsar\u2019s time, nevertheless, she is a girl who comes from a family and\nwe don\u2019t know what kept that family going financially.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Okay.",

        "Q: 1918.",
        "Q: So he is now introduced into the picture.",
        "Q: Can you tell us a little bit about him, his family, where he was born and so on?",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Was he the youngest, the oldest?",
        "Q: And what year was he born?",
        "Q: So he was younger than your mother?",
        "Q: I see. And his name was?",

        "Q: So it was some sort of seafood?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: It\u2019s interesting cause it\u2019s not a -- not anywhere near the ocean.",

        "Q: Yes.",
        "Q: Was it a religious family?",
        "Q: And do you know why\u201d Do yo -- would -- did that question ever come up as to why it was not\na particularly religious family?",

        "Q: A Roman Catholic.",
        "Q: So, in other words, your mother was Roman Catholic, your father Jewish, but neither was --",

        "Q: I see --",
        "Q: But it see --",
        "Q: But it is am -- it is an interesting kind of irony, if you were born in a border town that is still\nwithin the territory of the state of Lithuania, yet your birth certificate is in German --",
        "Q: -- and it\u2019s civil.",
        "Q: It\u2019s a little bit strange. Something --",

        "Q: -- classes, you never went to any --",
        "Q: -- Jewish classes.",
        "Q: Oh, so you\u2019re saying in the public schools, there was a li -- religious class, is that ri --",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: And whatever religion you happened to belong to --",
        "Q: Did your parents tell you the story of how they met? Did you ever learn --",
        "Q: Okay, so tell us the story of how they met.",
        "Q: His mother?",
        "Q: So this is --",
        "Q: Is that how she saw him?",
        "Q: For her?",
        "Q: And for him?",
        "Q: So where did they marry?",
        "Q: So it was a civil ceremony?",
        "Q: But let me get back to this a little bit. Even if the families were not particularly religious, and\nyour parents were not particularly li -- religious, you mentioned that your paternal grandmother\nhad tried to dissuade your father from marrying your mother.",
        "Q: Oh, I see.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "Q: Don\u2019t drop the first one.",
        "Q: And were -- were your parents accepted by the in-laws?",
        "Q: I\u2019m a little confused about this incident of finding one another on the street. At what year are\nyou talking about?",
        "Q: Oh, you\u2019re [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Okay, so you\u2019re talking about after the war now --",
        "Q: -- where they found one another. Let\u2019s still stay in the 1920\u2019s, and did you know your\nmaternal grandmother?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: And so you spent time with your mother\u2019s side of the family as well as your father\u2019s side of\nthe family?",
        "Q: Ah, okay.",
        "Q: All right. So you moved from Jurbarkas to Kaunas --",
        "Q: -- with your father --",
        "Q: -- as he finished his studies.",
        "Q: All right, so he was -- he was going to university as you were growing up.",
        "Q: Okay. What was -- are there any memories of your childhood with your greater family\ntogether, with your -- with your grandparents, with your uncles, with your aunts, anything that\nyou can ti -- that you remember, that sticks out?",
        "Q: So you participated?",
        "Q: And your uncles were younger? They were all younger brothers of your father?",
        "Q: Okay. Well, thank you, we will go to the --\nEnd of Tape One",
        "Q: Well, it\u2019s unusual. It\u2019s -- it\u2019s unusual what you describe, because there is a certain irony, or\nlet\u2019s say contradiction. On the one hand, in your family, both your very nuclear family of your\nmother and your father, and then the larger, extended family, you say that there was a great deal\nof closeness and that the in-laws liked the other partner very, very much.",
        "Q: But in the larger society, you\u2019re saying you could count on the fingers of -- of both hands how\nmany couples were in mixed marriages. So how do you explain that? How do you explain th-th-\nthey got on so well within, but were in an environment that was very unlikely?",
        "Q: So he was a Savanoris-Kurejas?",
        "Q: And what is the literal translation of those words?",
        "Q: I see.",
        "Q: Were there --",
        "Q: I see. I see, so that was one of the reasons why your -- you were able to attend more elite\nschools as you were growing up, as you said, and -- and have some privileges, because of that.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: How is it that your father came to join the army and take part in this -- in these battles? What\nwas the ethos, what was the -- the motivation that propelled him?",
        "Q: Your Jewish grandmother, you\u2019re talking about?",
        "Q: That\u2019s th -- also unusual.",
        "Q: Were your grandparents though -- outside of your family, your lo -- your nuclear and your\nextended family, did your parents, or did you experience any kind of prejudice? Any kind of\ndifficulties? Anything that made it awkward, that there was this Jewish Lithuanian union and that\nyou were the child of it. Did they experience anti-Semitism?",
        "Q: Both.",
        "Q: And this is during the war --",
        "Q: When there\u2019s already a ghetto --",
        "Q: -- in Vilnius. I see.",
        "Q: But during your growing up years, before the war --",
        "Q: Did it -- when you were with Lithuanians though, not Jewish Lithuanians, but Lithuanians,\ndid you hear any kind of -- general kind of anecdotes or -- or sayings, or ways that would\ndiminish, let\u2019s say, somebody who was Jewish?",
        "Q: I see. So you say it -- it did exist, but not in the milieu that -- your circle --",
        "Q: -- you were in.",
        "Q: Okay. Did your parents ever talk about such things, about any difficulties that they might\nhave heard of, or any things that were harder for them to take because they were -- they had\nmade other decisions?",
        "Q: Tell us.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: There are articles that are now appearing in -- in Lithuania that explore, for want of a better\nway of putting it, the rise of anti-Semitism in the 1930\u2019s in the country. And a number of these\narticles talk about comp -- competition and a competitive kind of conflict of interest between\norganizations such as Lietukis and inde -- whether they would be Jewish independent\n[indecipherable] --",
        "Q: -- companies and so on.",
        "Q: Can you tell us a little bit about that?",
        "Q: In 1939.",
        "Q: And did he talk about what kind of reaction this type -- these efforts were having? Did he\nmake headroad? Were there -- were there some of his Jewish colleagues or friends who were not\npart of Lietukis who accepted it, or did he talk about what his experiences were?",
        "Q: And why would you think that was?",
        "Q: So if they ha-had regarded him as a Jew, he wouldn\u2019t have been accepted?",
        "Q: I know.",
        "Q: What I mean to say 1s if there had been somebody else who had been Jewish and did not have\nthe same, let\u2019s say, point of view as your -- your father, but had wanted to be part of Lietukis,\nwould they have gotten such acceptance?",
        "Q: And the reason being?",
        "Q: So there was anti-Semitism in the country, and quite --",
        "Q: You\u2019re talking now about the war.",
        "Q: About the -- the ghetto and the Holocaust. Let me go back a little bit again to World War I\njust for a question. Your father joined the -- the military and fought for Lithuanian independence.\nWere there other Jewish people that you knew --",
        "Q: -- Jewish men that you knew --",
        "Q: -- who did the same?",
        "Q: [indecipherable]",
        "Q: So this [speaks Lithuanian] would be translated as a Jewish --",
        "Q: -- volunteers --",
        "Q: And there were at least a hundred people --",
        "Q: And that was a --",
        "Q: I\u2019m -- I mention this because the -- one of the charges of -- of Lithuanians against the Jewish\ncommunity is that the Jewish community in Lithuania sided with the Soviets when 1940 came\naround. That\u2019s the charge. And I remember talking to a number of survivors who would say there\nwere people who fought for Lithuania\u2019s independence, and that was not acknowledged, as they\nwere being driven to the pits to be shot. Is that sort of experience, that -- can you address that at\nall?",
        "Q: The War Museum.",
        "Q: In Kaunas, mm-hm.",
        "Q: It is a bitter moment though, for those who would have been volunteers. It\u2019s a bitter moment\nfor everybody, but in particular the people who had volunteered for Lithuania\u2019s independence to\nthen be called traitors and not have that counted at all.",
        "Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.",
        "Q: He was a Jewish volunteer for the [indecipherable |",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Who would this be?",
        "Q: Armbands?",
        "Q: Balta raiSt}.",
        "Q: So this was in 1941?",
        "Q: Right when the Nazis are invading --",
        "Q: -- during those first weeks.",
        "Q: And this is what happens to -- and did he die, Mr. --",
        "Q: So he died.",
        "Q: That\u2019s a bitter moment.",
        "Q: But why should it be directed against the country\u2019s Jews?",
        "Q: So you --",
        "Q: How 1s it that your parents didn\u2019t, or your family didn\u2019t? You father didn\u2019t, or his -- his uncles\n-- or did they?",
        "Q: Make it through those first few weeks.",

        "Q: In the Finnish German --",
        "Q: -- in the Finnish Soviet war.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Which newspaper was this?",
        "Q: So that means during the Soviet time, that is in 1940, this echo of Lithuania newspaper was\nstill being published.",
        "Q: I see. My point though, is I\u2019m trying to understand 1s that even with the Soviet takeover, a\nnewspaper that was not Soviet controlled was allowed to be published and allowed to have the\nnames of people who were unemployed listed there. That\u2019s unusual, if I\u2019m understanding it\ncorrectly.",
        "Q: Jews were wearing a white and -- white --",
        "Q: Okay, so your father was working in the health department in Vilnius, 1-in -- in the -- what is\nthe capital city now.",
        "Q: The Germans arrive and his protector, whose name was?",
        "Q: Usas.",

        "Q: -- whoever -- whoever Is --",
        "Q: -- yeah, what happened?",
        "Q: And this is in June or July of 1941?",
        "Q: And so it\u2019s -- if it\u2019s issued by the Lithuanian government, do you mean the Lithuanian\nprovisional government?",
        "Q: So it\u2019s a provisional government directive, not a German directive?",
        "Q: Regional commissioner.",
        "Q: Now at this point, I\u2019d like to leave that for a moment.",
        "Q: I have a question about Colonel Usas and -- and it\u2019s one that\u2019s -- that it bi -- sort of like rouses\nmy curiosity. Here is somebody who was a -- let\u2019s say a comrade of your father\u2019s from the\nofficer corps of the Lithuanian independent army, who survives, let\u2019s say, a Soviet purge. In\nother words, his is not one of the names that\u2019s on the list of those who are unemployed, who ends",
        "Q: Ear -- ear, no --",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Okay, I would say let\u2019s go back to the 1930\u2019s --",
        "Q: -- a little bit. We were -- we were talking earlier about your larger extended family, about\nyour father\u2019s work at Lietukis, which was a cooperative association.",

        "Q: And how many people do you think were there? Do you -- would you rec -- what was it, a\ncouple of hundred? Was it fewer, was it more?",
        "Q: And this had nothing to do with the Lithuanian military at all?",
        "Q: And the idea of it was that 1t would be a pr -- a force that would be part of the movement to\nIsrael, the movement to be able to establish Israel?",
        "Q: Yes.",

        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "Q: Oh, so there was a representation of Lithuania in Palestine?",
        "Q: And so the other person got that --",
        "Q: What languages did you speak at home? What was your language between your father, your\nmother and yourself?",
        "Q: Just Lithuanian.",
        "Q: And were other languages sometimes spoken in your house?",
        "Q: Okay, so former Tsarist officers --",
        "Q: Ah, Grand Duke.",
        "Q: Grand Duke, yes.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "Q: So this was part of, let\u2019s say, the ri -- White Russian --",
        "Q: -- Russian refugees who had --",
        "Q: -- who had come from Soviet --",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "Q: But your mother spoke Russian, so it was --",
        "Q: And when did you learn it?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Where is Kulautuva?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: You were how old then?",
        "Q: 14. And so you hadn\u2019t -- your knowledge of Russian to that point had been in verbal\nconversation rather than --",
        "Q: Okay, so it was not --",
        "Q: -- there was no academic formal background --",
        "Q: -- there was no -- all of a sudden you have a crash course.",
        "Q: Before we get back to 1940 I wanted to, you know, talk a little bit more about those 1930\u2019s.\nDid you have -- when you were growing up, who were your closest friends your age?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: So it would be his daughter.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Of?",
        "Q: I see. I see. Did you have friends who were part of the Jewish community?",
        "Q: What language did you speak?",
        "Q: I see.",
        "Q: So they were also more assimilated.",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Why\u2019?",
        "Q: Did you hear some of your other playmates at school make fun of Jews?",
        "Q: Di -- no.",
        "Q: So this is at that elite high school that you went --",
        "Q: -- that you went to.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "Q: And of course if you have a larger number of kids who are Jewish then it\u2019s unlikely --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah. What were -- you know, as the 1930\u2019s were progressing, you were getting older and\nolder, from childhood into young teenager.",
        "Q: What are your memories from that time? A --",
        "Q: In what way?",
        "Q: Oh my.",

        "Q: Never.",
        "Q: Yes.",

        "Q: [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Whose spies were they?",
        "Q: They were German spies in Lithuania?",
        "Q: So, from the Memel region, Memel is Klaipeda --",
        "Q: -- in German, uh-huh. And -- and so there was an exodus?",
        "Q: I see.",

        "Q: Right.",

        "Q: Really?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",

        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: No sort of premonition?",
        "Q: And now let\u2019s go east. When did you get a sense of Soviet Russia?",
        "Q: And not before.",
        "Q: So the provocation is on whose side? The Russians are provoking the Lithuanians?",
        "Q: I see.",
        "Q: And that\u2019s the first premonition you have --",
        "Q: And how did you -- how did -- well, we\u2019ll come to that in a little bit, but ho -- you were by\nthat point 13 - 14 years old.",
        "Q: So I\u2019d like to get a sense of what do you remember, what do you experience. How did it affect\nyou in particular?",
        "Q: But it can be in the next tape.",
        "Q: Okay.\nEnd of Tape Three",
        "Q: Okay, so what ha -- a-after you remember this dinner conversation with the ministry interiors\ntalking about the strange situation of the Soviet Union saying their soldiers have gone missing\nhere, and then bases are established within the territory, what was your next memory of what\nhappened with independent Lithuania or life as you knew it, basically.",
        "Q: And do you remember that?",
        "Q: What happened, how -- what did you see? What is what -- what\u2019s in your minds -- mind\u2019s\neye?",
        "Q: Mm-hm, mm-hm.",
        "Q: You mentioned earlier that there had been factory people and alluding that most of these had\nbeen Jewish who stood there with red flags. Was it no -- only Jewish people? Were there any\nLithuanians?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: How did life change in your personal relationships with the people that you knew? Did any go\n-- did -- did any surprise you and -- and let\u2019s say become part of the new system?",
        "Q: And what happened with the rest?",
        "Q: Left the country.",
        "Q: What happened after the Soviet takeover? How did it impact your family in the very first\ninstance? Was it the loss of your father\u2019s job?",
        "Q: What kind of a place did you have before? Was it a large apartment or a house?",
        "Q: Uh-huh.",
        "Q: Can you tell us a little bit about that? What happened there?",
        "Q: On what month?",
        "Q: And what year?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: So you missed the deportations, you weren\u2019t on the lists.",
        "Q: You were on the lists?",
        "Q: I see.",
        "Q: Why not?",
        "Q: When you were already in Vilnius.",
        "Q: I see.",

        "Q: -- again.",
        "Q: And any of your friends got deported?",
        "Q: Did you talk to their families? Was there anybody left to tell you what was happening, or --\nhow did -- how did you experience those deportations, that\u2019s what I\u2019m saying. If you weren\u2019t\naffected yourselves --",
        "Q: This was June, yeah.",
        "Q: Off of the train they took them --",
        "Q: But did they know it was Siberia?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: So in your memory, you remember seeing Soviet soldiers in the streets who could have been\npart of the NK VD tw -- choir, but you never saw a -- a -- one of the trucks come by in the middle\nof the night, or you --",
        "Q: -- didn\u2019t see any other --",
        "Q: -- actual instance of --",

        "Q: I see.",
        "Q: I see. Where they lived, who they were.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "Q: So his problem was solved.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "Q: Okay. We\u2019re in Vilnius now. You\u2019re in -- in your white summer dress.",
        "Q: You mother, I think, has a purple dress.",
        "Q: You meet your father.",
        "Q: You\u2019re together again.",
        "Q: And you hear airplanes overhead.",
        "Q: But at that point your father was still a laborer in the health department.",
        "Q: Your uncle still was at the Bank of Lithuania --",
        "Q: -- and the vaults of the bank were your bomb shelters.",
        "Q: Okay. What happened after that?",
        "Q: So, Uncle Solomon and his --",
        "Q: And how large was this apartment?",
        "Q: I see. So there was a lot of people.",
        "Q: And again, let\u2019s take it further. In the next several days, next week or so, what are your\nmemories of that time? What happened that was significant to you?",
        "Q: Who would do that? Who was doing those throwing outs?",
        "Q: Both who?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Did your family do that?",
        "Q: Cause you weren't Jewish, or cause you didn\u2019t have a radio?",
        "Q: What happened?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: You mean, some soldiers were killed, and then others --",
        "Q: And Lukisk\u00e9s is a jail.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Jewish star.",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: Did that affect you?",
        "Q: But you\u2019 re half-Jewish.",
        "Q: So, in other words, you were not in Kaunas when the -- when the -- the first pogroms\nhappened?",
        "Q: You weren\u2019t -- you weren't there --",
        "Q: You were in Vilnius.",
        "Q: Did you ha --",
        "Q: I see. And was there telephone connection, or did you find -- when you were in Vilnius, was\nthere a way that you could find out what was going on and that -- did find out what was going on\nin Kaunas, or not?",
        "Q: I see. I see. So -- so you really had no knowledge --",
        "Q: -- of what was going on there?",
        "Q: On what street, excuse me, cause I know s --",
        "Q: Oh, so it was really right there across the street.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Excuse me now. The apartment that your family was living in, it was outside the border of the\nghetto?",
        "Q: Okay, so they are still able to live in that apartment, or not?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: So where did they go, if they couldn\u2019t --",
        "Q: Went into the ghetto area.",
        "Q: Without a place to live.",
        "Q: All right, maybe I\u2019ve gotten ahead of myself a little bit.",
        "Q: We were going through the sequence of what was happening in Vilnius and -- and in\ncomparison it was chaotic to what was happening in Kaunas as far as the ghetto being\nestablished.",
        "Q: But we left it at such that people were had -- had to take their radios to --",
        "Q: -- the authorities.",
        "Q: They had to bring their jewels --",
        "Q: -- there. They had to rep -- some, when a German soldier was supposedly killed, the Jewish\nelders were told to get a certain number of people to report to the jail.",
        "Q: And then what? And then what?",
        "Q: By the Lithuanian helpers?",
        "Q: That\u2019s right.",
        "Q: Housekeeper of a sort?",
        "Q: A supervi -- a super.",
        "Q: Superintendent.",
        "Q: That\u2019s the soldier. That\u2019s the --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: Do you remember what he looked like?",
        "Q: But do you remember his manner, his -- his attitude?",
        "Q: What about grandma?",
        "Q: Oh, I see, they weren't taking women.",
        "Q: So these are the first days --",
        "Q: -- of the German occupation --",
        "Q: -- of -- of Vilnius and --",
        "Q: -- what\u2019s happening to the city\u2019s Jews.",
        "Q: But did people know that?",
        "Q: Can we leave this for a second?",
        "Q: Because we\u2019re going to ba -- finish our tape and come to the next -- to the next cass --\nEnd of Tape Four",
        "Q: This is something that is un -- I -- I don\u2019t fully quite understand it and maybe it needs a little\nbit more explanation. It sounds that all of a sudden, one day, without any warning, people show\nup, these hapunes show up in the various apartments across the stity -- city where there are --\nwhere there are Jews who are living, and who are pushing them out of their houses, who knows\nwhere. Or is it they\u2019re th -- just taking the men? What -- what was happening?",
        "Q: And they go to where? Where they\u2019re brought? Where were they brought to?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Straight to the prison, which is on another side of town.",
        "Q: Did you know about the nur -- Nuremberg laws?",
        "Q: By that point you knew?",
        "Q: I see.",
        "Q: And he was in Vilnius at that time?",
        "Q: No, no, no, I meant Kubilunas.",
        "Q: I see.",
        "Q: And where were the --",
        "Q: So by that point he\u2019s director of the hospital.",
        "Q: Trail.",
        "Q: In other words, he -- if he had any doubts before, he learned at that point, that when your\nmother fell on her knees, she saved his life.",
        "Q: Yeah, and also --",
        "Q: Id like to get a better sense of the sequence. You talk of -- you talk of mass chaos, basically,\npeople being forced into the territory of the ghetto and those who don\u2019t have a room or a place",
        "Q: And then when these two children, the three people, but two of them children, come to, you\nknow, to the Jewish hospital in Vilnius, your father sees them, is that already when the ghetto has\nbeen established, even in its early days, or is that before the establishment of the ghetto?",
        "Q: Before. So there\u2019s no ghetto yet.",
        "Q: Is it after the time he was supposed to have been taken?",
        "Q: After.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Okay, so then -- so the -- this is where I\u2019d like to get mo -- a little bit more clarity. So after\nthat time your grandmother stays. Your uncles --",
        "Q: -- and father are saved by your mother. And it\u2019s by a hair\u2019s breadth, but there they are. Then\ndid they come again for them? Was there a second time when they were going to be put into the\nghetto? Do you understand, 1s --",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: So what happened when that hapunes left without his quarry?",
        "Q: Okay, but then the rest of you stayed in it?",
        "Q: So it wasn't Jew free, in reality?",
        "Q: Okay. And that\u2019s where you stayed?",
        "Q: A Polish Gentile refugee.",
        "Q: By that point -- excuse me, let me back up a little bit, I want to focus a little bit on your gram\n-- on your father\u2019s family. You had said earlier that your grandfather had been an invalid. By the\ntime 1941 rolled around, was --",
        "Q: He was -- he had already passed away?",
        "Q: Okay, so mid-30\u2019s.",
        "Q: Mid-30\u2019s.",
        "Q: And --",
        "Q: A small room.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: That\u2019s when we get to the ghetto, but --",
        "Q: -- your father had four brothers, one of whom was with you in Vilnius, Solomon --",
        "Q: -- with his wife, pregnant.",
        "Q: And wer -- whe-where were the other two brothers?",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: And his name 1s?",
        "Q: Ephrain was in Siauliai, okay.",
        "Q: Reuben.",
        "Q: To Siberia.",
        "Q: This is still in Kaunas?",
        "Q: Right.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: He disappeared.",
        "Q: And you never found out what happened to him.",
        "Q: The 16\" division was a Soviet army --",
        "Q: -- partisan [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Mm-hm. He wasn\u2019t there.",
        "Q: And -- and yet, you say somebody told you that he did make it to --",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Yeah, not really reliable.",
        "Q: What a sad thing.",
        "Q: Very sad thing.",
        "Q: So there are three brothers --",
        "Q: -- and your grandmother.",
        "Q: And they were all -- except -- except for your uncle in Siauliai --",
        "Q: -- everybody was in Vilnius.",
        "Q: All right.",
        "Q: At this point it might sound a little odd that I ask this question, but it\u2019s been on my mind as\nwe ve been talking. How do you identify yourself? What was your identity?",
        "Q: Was there any part of you where you felt Jewish?",
        "Q: Is this what your father was saying?",
        "Q: Do you remember how many people that was?",
        "Q: Did he talk about it at home?",
        "Q: You were part of these conversations at home --",
        "Q: -- at age 14- 15.",
        "Q: Can you tell us about her? Who was she?",
        "Q: In the ghetto.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: And that\u2019s when he was still director of the hospital?",
        "Q: That\u2019s when he\u2019s already --",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: Something -- something jiggled your memory. But we\u2019ll come back to her. I want to go back\nto the other question that I had when I asked you how did you identify yourself, because I had a\nfollow-up question, and that is --",
        "Q: When you saw -- when you saw the chaos in Vilnius and you saw Jews being expelled from\ntheir apartments and Poles standing on the street and making fun, and the Lithuanian\ncollaborators who were there, who were part of this expulsion, not doing it -- I mean actually\ndoing it, not seeming to care very much, did any feelings go through you? Did you ever think to\nyourself, how could they do such a thing? Do they not see what\u2019s going on?",
        "Q: I know. But earlier you said, when we were talking about what befell people when the Soviets\ncame in and what befell people when the Germans came in, you were explaining that there was\nthis hatred Jews because there had been some on the streets waving red flags. And as a -- as an\nexplanation as to why there was anti-Semitism, as an explanation as to why there was hatred, and\nfor many people who were not there, who did not live through these times, that kind of\nexplanation seems to hold very little water, exactly for the reason you just said right now.",
        "Q: But wa -- again, I go back to, why would that be, if the soldiers were correct, then why would\nthis kind of hatred, why would this kind of -- of anger be directed at a Jewish population? And I\nmean in the sense of explanations later, when people are explaining things to themselves --\nyou're sitting in Vilnius and you\u2019re seeing the chaos of what\u2019s happening, and you weren't\nsaying to yourself, oh it\u2019s because they waved red flags when the Soviets were coming in, you\nwere seeing people being dehumanized.",
        "Q: Whose cooperation?",
        "Q: Lithuanian cooperation --",
        "Q: -- was not so voluntary, are you saying?",
        "Q: So you mean --",
        "Q: -- they wouldn\u2019t have collaborated had they not seen --",
        "Q: Maybe I\u2019Il repeat a little of this.",
        "Q: Of a -- you were a person who was integrated into Lithuanian society, who was part of it, and\nwere more familiar with different communities than most people were. And here, all of a sudden\nin 1941, you see a huge inhumanity take place. You see -- you see Lithuanians who you\u2019ve\ngrown up with and you are part of, come and want to take your father away. And others -- even if\nnot those particular soldiers, others who took other people away. And some of them robbed them\nas they were doing it, and pocketed the jewelry and so on. How does one explain that to oneself\nabout the culture one has come from?",
        "Q: So tell me, when you have the hapunes come by --",
        "Q: -- these collaborators --",
        "Q: -- come by, what do you think motivated them?",
        "Q: Deportations and --",
        "Q: -- and red flags.",
        "Q: That there were people who would to -- betray your country --",
        "Q: -- betray your other -- but why would it ha -- okay, all right, but when you look at documents\nlater, you -- people say that they were all nationalities who are part of this great Soviet\nexperiment, not just the Jewish nationality.",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "Q: Yeah. Okay.",
        "Q: Thank you. We\u2019ll break right now for lunch and then we\u2019ll come back to the story itself.",
        "Q: Okay. You know, I [tape break]. Okay, I\u2019d like to get a better sense, even though we\u2019ve\ntalked and -- and touched on this before, of the transition from your father being head of -- the\ndirector of the Jewish hospital to being appointed head of the Jewish police. Can you tell me\nabout the sequence of those events?",
        "Q: Were you in the room when he said this to your mother?",
        "Q: Do you remember how you reacted to this?",

        "Q: O-Okay.",
        "Q: If that\u2019s the case that nobody knew from the Germans that you had any connection\nwhatsoever to the head of the ghetto police, how was it that you had permission to go in and out\nof the ghetto? Wasn\u2019t that restricted?",
        "Q: And how often did you go in and out of the ghetto?",

        "Q: -- and he would share things with your mother. Do you think the same rule applied with her,\nor do you think he went into details with her, because he needed to talk to somebody who was\ntrusted?",

        "A: It was unheard of. I think what -- what make my mother decide to -- to do it, first of all, I\nwould describe him as -- not as a Jew in Lithuania, but a Lithuanian of Jewish extraction.",
        "A: No, she saw him who he is, but I mean, that made it easier to get into the marriage.",
        "A: For her, I think so.",
        "A: For him? They were not religious people, so that didn\u2019t mean anything. And what they did,\nthey also have a German marriage certificate. They did the same thing when I was born, but by\ncoincidence over there, they did the same thing --",
        "A: They married also on the border, with a German document. So they didn\u2019t have to use either\nreligion for their marriage certificate.",
        "A: Civil ceremony. Lithuania didn\u2019t have it. That eliminated changing the religions, either this or\nthat, and so we lived happily ever after.",
        "A: Yes, but his fianc\u00e9 was also Lithuanian.",
        "A: So that -- that was not an issue of religion, that was an issue, don\u2019t drop --",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah. Mm-hm.",
        "A: Absolutely. Absolutely. My father\u2019s -- my grandfather on Father\u2019s side adored my mother.\nAdored. I mean, exactly in the word, adored my mother. Mama helped to put his brothers\nthrough universities. Mama took them in. They stayed a long time with us. And on Mother\u2019s side\nthere was exactly the same situation. Exactly the same situation. You mentioned before my\nfather\u2019s brother. My mother\u2019s brother found my father\u2019s brother in Vilnius on the street. That\u2019s\nhow we got in touch. So it\u2019s -- it\u2019s a -- they were very close. Both families were very close.",
        "A: They went 40 -- what is it, 40 -- 40-something? When he came from Vorkuta.",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "A: After the war, right, yeah.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Well, my mother\u2019s side of the family was in Kaunas.",
        "A: Yeah. It\u2019s only my father family who was in Siauliai.",
        "A: To Kaunas.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Well, during the Easter break, my father\u2019s family always had a Seder. Even so, the youngest\nuncle couldn\u2019t stop laughing during the ceremony, but it was there. I remember big, big crates of\nmatzo, silver dishes which were stored from year to year, I remember that.",
        "A: Oh absolutely. Absolutely. During Christmas, I remember that their neighbors had all this\nvery big Christmas celebration, they were Lithuanians. So I spent a lot of time for Christmas\nwith the neighbors who had children my own age. Otherwise I just loved going to Siauliai to be\npampered by three uncles and grandparents.",
        "A: They were younger brothers. When I was finishing attending last years of high school, the\nyoungest brother was a student in Belgium. So the age difference was not such a shocking one,\nyeah.\nBeginning Tape Two",
        "A: That\u2019s correct.",
        "A: Well, there is a -- two words in Lithuanian terminology. The words are Savanoris-Kurejas.\nThese are the people who fought for Lithuanian\u2019s independence and put Lithuania on the map.\nThese people were privileged society. We had privileges. For example, if I would have chosen to\ngo to a high school, free. My conservatory, music, was free. My ballet school, state ballet school,\nwas free. They were given as many privileges as they could. Papa was one of the officers\u2019 corps,\nwho fought at the f -- with the famous first pulkas regiment, probably. They were one for all, all\nfor one.",
        "A: Yes, was Savanoris-Kurejas, absolutely.",
        "A: A volunteer -- oh, kurejas is -- e -- it doesn\u2019t sound in -- in English it doesn\u2019t make any sense.\nHere we understand volunteer army. They -- they were volunteers. They put their books in high\nschool, they went to fight.",
        "A: They went to fight for the country.",
        "A: So he was accepted in the society as one of those volunteer fighters for Lithuanian\nindependence, without any attachment of religion. And that officer\u2019s corps, that solidarity that --\nwith the officers, later on proved how the solidarity worked between them.",
        "A: Well, I didn\u2019t use privileges for the free high school.",
        "A: University was free, also. Even so, the other university students had to pay. All these\nvolunteer fighters had privileges for their family. I didn\u2019t use it. I just used it for the conservatory\nand for the ballet school, but I didn\u2019t use it for the high school, and I was too young to use it for\nuniversity.",
        "A: I think it had to start with his parents. My grandmother Lithuanian was very strange dialect.\nWe don\u2019t talk in towns in that dialect. It\u2019s a dialect --",
        "A: My Jewish grandmother, yes. In translation we would call it lowlands, Zemaitji, or it\u2019s\nnormally, in geographical sense, it\u2019s called Samogitia. She came from part of Lithuania closer to\nthe Baltic Sea. And naturally we understand them, but they have a very heavy accent. Which 1s\nvery pretty, by the way. And my grandmother, my father\u2019s mother, taught me all old Lithuanian\nsongs. All Lithuanian folklore things. It was I got from my father\u2019s mother. My mother\u2019s mother,\nagain, came from St. Petersburg and Riga. She was not so much engrossed in Lithuanian, you\nknow, language and so on. Everything I have, it\u2019s from my father\u2019s mother.",
        "A: That\u2019s very unusual, but you see, that\u2019s -- that\u2019s what it is. I am the product of two -- two lenk\n-- two nationalities, two religions and I fit and -- in here, and I fit in here.",
        "A: They or me?",
        "A: Neither. Neither. The only first time in 1942, I had a very good voice and the conductor in\nVilnius in the symphony -- what we had in Vilnius, we had a musical outfit, I -- if I would know\nthe name -- anyway, I joined the choir and the conductor was my music teacher in high school,\nand couple of days after we had rehearsals he met me on the street and he said, Ada, don\u2019t come\nany more. I was told who you are. So be careful, and don\u2019t come in any more.",
        "A: That -- that -- during the war.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, that was the first time that I experienced somebody telling that.",
        "A: Never, never.",
        "A: You know what? The class of people that I attended the school with, was above it.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No. What helped a lot probably, is that Father always worked for Lithuanian institutions,\n[indecipherable] Ministeria, Minister of Justice. And then Lietukis, the organization -- do you\nknow what Lietukis is?",
        "A: Okay. It\u2019s an organ -- it\u2019s a association of Lithuanian co-ops. It was all over the country.\nEvery little town, every village had a co-op. And that outfit had in their hands entire import and\nentire export of the country.",
        "A: It just so happened that my father was in the imports of oil, gas and my husband was in the\nother part of lithua -- export from Lithuania. It\u2019s just a coincidence. So he always worked with\nLithuania and France, and with -- he was always in that atmosphere.",
        "A: That\u2019s correct.",
        "A: Absolutely correct.",
        "A: I can\u2019t tell you too, too much, but I know that my father tried to introduce Lietukis to his\nJewish -- to the people who had business in their hands, people who were Jewish. He was trying\nto explain that this is the country you\u2019re in, let\u2019s move more towards a Lithuanian site, doing\nbusiness with Lithuanians. And you see, this is again in answer to your question did he ever feel,\nhe was trying to get the -- to get the Jewish merchants take more merchandise from Lietukis. He\nwas very much against using Russian language in Lithuan -- in Jewish society. He was very\nmuch against. He traveled all over Lithuania during the fin -- Finnish Soviet war, giving lectures",
        "A: -- right, giving lectures about the [indecipherable] Mannerheim\u2019s fight with the Soviets. And\nfrom his side, he didn\u2019t see himself as a Jew, he saw himself as a Lithuanian patriot, when you\n[indecipherable] those people.",
        "A: Well, it wasn\u2019t easy to persuade. You know, the merchant is a merchant and they have their\nlocal how do you -- how would say it, local ways. But he managed, he managed to pull quite a\nfew to buy from Lietukis. That what it was, buy from Lietukis. My father was an expert, he\npublished a book which Mama was afraid to -- to keep around when the Soviets came, about the\nall kind of merchandise in connection with oils and gas. Everything connect -- 1n connection with\nthat area. And that was his last work, absolutely. So that\u2019s -- that\u2019s all I can tell you. And he was\nthe only Jewish person in the entire country in Lietukis, the only one.",
        "A: Because nobody regarded him as a Jew.",
        "A: But he wa -- he was a Jew --",
        "A: -- everybody knew it. But nobody -- nobody regarded him as a Jew.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Because he was a Jew.",
        "A: Officially no. Officially no, but in the -- in -- for example, my father\u2019s next brothers,\nSalomonis, Solomon, he was the only person in Lietuvos bankas, the bank of Lithuania. Again,\nanother example. So you could get through, if you were accepted by Lithuanian community as\none of ours. Not as a Russian talking Jewish person, which was the style of our Jewish\npopulation. That\u2019s why it was so difficult to s-save sometimes, children, because they spoke\nRussian and they spoke Yiddish and they didn\u2019t speak Lithuanian. That was a tragedy that really\nwas an -- a very important factor. Many children could ha-have been saved.",
        "A: Yeah. Yeah.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes. There was -- I don\u2019t know the number, but I remember during the parades with -- when\nwe used to have big military parades, it was suba -- [speaks Lithuanian here]",
        "A: Like I see in my -- you know, I saw a film in United States and my father was in that film,\ntoo. I see the -- I would ca -- probably say about -- about a hundred, they were all fighters for\nLithuanian freedom.",
        "A: The Jewish volunteers --",
        "A: -- for Lithuanian independence. Were Jewish fighters. Jewish fighter, volunteers for\nLithuanian independence.",
        "A: I -- I see -- I see the parade in -- I see in my eyes, yeah.",
        "A: It could have been more because the parades was always in Kaunas and there -- others in the\nother villages in other towns who probably -- not always used to come to Kaunas. But there was\nquite a few.",
        "A: In life there are two groups of people. There are richer people, there are factory working\nelement. Well, you cannot deny it, you have pictures, you see who stood in our main street\naccepting Soviet army. You see the pictures, you don\u2019t have to be told. The people with red flags\nstanding and greeting Soviet army were the element -- factory element. Jewish factory element.\nThe people -- the richer element, in percentage, was deported to Siberia -- higher percentage than\nLithuanians. I don\u2019t mean number, I mean percentage. So now you adjust these two factors. No\nintelligent class was willing to huh, Soviets are here. That was not the case. The factory class,\nyes. What remembered in people\u2019s memories are the red flags and who are the red flags. Only\nthey, when those people stood with red flags, my father, Mama and I, we all worked -- walked to\n[speaks Lithuanian]",

        "A: Where for the last time -- I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re familiar, every evening the invalids came\nfrom the building, they paraded through the grounds and there was a ceremony. Whoever came\nto that, that day to the place, we were singing the Lithuanian national -- national anthem,\neverybody was crying. It was unbelievably mova -- m-moving scene. So you see, you can\u2019t\nblame the -- you can\u2019t blame the whole Jewish nation, same way you cannot blame the whole\nLithuanian nation for what happened.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know if you want to make a -- okay. Attorney Gornionskis from Kaunas --",
        "A: -- was one of those. When the Soviets came, he took his f-family, moved to Vilnius.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: [ll tell you very quickly, because we are too far away. When the Lithuanian hapunes --",
        "A: You had to be Lithuanian in those days. Hapune come from a word hapun. Hapun is to grab.\nThey were called in Jewish language, hapunes. These were the Lithuanians with the white --",
        "A: Armbands.",
        "A: Balta raist}. Came to his apartment and a Lithuanian officer was living in the same apartment\nand Lithuanian officer told him -- he was active officer in Lithuanian army at th -- th -- in those\ndays, is that Mr. Gornionski, do not answer the door. They see my name on the door, don\u2019t even\ncome close to the door. And whatever, hide in my room and lock the door. Don\u2019t even leave my\nroom. When the hapunes came to the apartment, Mr. Gornionski put his wife and two children in\nthe Lithuanian army officer\u2019s room, and Gornionski said, oh for God\u2019s sake, I am the volunteer\nwith Savanoris-Kureyjas, they are not going to do any harm to me. So he opened the door and his\nappearance was extremely Jewish. You couldn\u2019t take him for anybody else. And the Lithuanians\ntaunted, oh come on, you such and such. So he said to him, look, I am a volunteer fighter. I\nfought for your country\u2019s independence. That\u2019s why you have a country today, because of people\nlike me. And that made the man wild. He started to beat him there, to the pulp. So that was the\nreaction between one and the other. Now, how do I know all about it, is because of something\nvery similar happened in our place. My father said to Mama, please go to see what happened to\nGornionski. Because there was an aktion when those -- when --",
        "A: \u201941, yes.",
        "A: Right, yes.",
        "A: Yes, yes.",
        "A: Well, I'll tell you what happened. So at -- Mama went and Mrs. Gornionski opened the door\nand she told Mama what happened because she could hear everything, even though they were\nlocked in the room. Mama ran to Lithuanian military commandantura, Lithuanian military\nheadquarters. And Gornionskis had very, very good friend, Songila -- I have to remember the\nname. I think Majora Songila, if I\u2019m not wrong. Songila -- whatever he was doing, he dropped\neverything, he ran to Lukisk\u00e9s jail, where everybody was taking, to LukiSk\u00e9s. He went all over\nthrough the hundreds of people that were already brought and he was screaming, Gornionskis,\nGornionskis, Gornionskis until he couldn\u2019t scream any more. He couldn\u2019t find him. So whether\nfrom be -- being beaten so badly he just passed out, or whether he was so overcome with what\nhappened to him that he didn\u2019t react, Major Songila couldn\u2019t find him.",
        "A: We don\u2019t know -- well -- well, naturally he died. Naturally they -- everything from the\nLukisSkes was taken to Paneriai and shot.",
        "A: It is a bitter moment, but you see there\u2019s again an explanation to -- to all of that certain\nexplanation. This was about two -- two -- two, three weeks after deportations to Siberia. Now,\nyou\u2019re too young to remember. I remember. Deportations to Siberia brought a lot of anger.",
        "A: The red flags of the people on the alley of liberty, [Lithuanian]. People don\u2019t forget things\nlike that. People who worked in personnel departments of each institution, kadroskidos, they\nwere in the hands of certain nationality.",
        "A: All that added up to the outburst of hatred. They didn\u2019t look at the time, were you pro or\ncontra, it just mass, the whole mass was experiencing that hatred.",
        "A: How -- how did we -- what do you mean?",
        "A: Well, that was all [indecipherable] officer\u2019s help. See, the -- I -- I tol -- I mentioned that, it\nprobably belonged to that famous first regiment. The closeness of the officers was unbelievable.\nWhen the Soviets came in 1914, Papa was the first person from Lietukis thrown out of job. Not\nonly thrown out of job, but not given right to live in Kaunas, and not given right -- not given the\nlabor book. So for awhile we couldn\u2019t understand what\u2019s going on. We never had anything to do\nwith the Soviet Union. But after a few days, people started to see what\u2019s going on. So Mama said\nto my father, you know what? Go to Vilnius. His brother, who was bor -- working in Bank of\nLithuania in the meantime was transferred from Siauliai to Vilnius, so she said, go to Vilnius --",
        "A: Salomonis.",
        "A: Yeah. Solomon. And he went to Vilnius. He tried to get a job in Vilnius. Whenever he would\nput his name and go through Kadroz Kiduz, that office of political personnel, he couldn\u2019t get the\njob.",
        "A: Why? First of all, he was an officer. Secondly, he went all over Lithuania talking, giving\nspeeches against Soviet Union.",
        "A: In the finni -- fi -- fi --",
        "A: -- Soviet war.",
        "A: And secondly he was not a class that they want to have. In those days, when you opened our\nmain newspaper, on two pages were hundreds and hundreds Lithuanian army personnel out of\nwork, out of work, out of work. They would tell all these officers are out.",
        "A: That was still the first days [indecipherable] Aidas, but then it change already to different\nnames. But they gave a list of, in alphabetical order of each and every officer that used to serve\nin Lithuanian army.",
        "A: From the beginning. From the beginning it was published, but then they changed the names,\nyeah.",
        "A: The -- they knew we -- what -- don\u2019t forget there was a -- a -- the -- they formed a Lithuanian\npro-Soviet government. So the government had no choice. If they were told that all the officers\u2019\ncorps has to be out of the army, they had to do it. So that\u2019s where the -- all the officers were\nlisted. If there exists a fi -- somewhere you know, in archives, the newspapers from that area,\nyou'll find it. So you say how come. So anyway, to make a long story short, Father couldn\u2019t get\nwork in Vilnius. It happened that he met one of the people from his fighting years who was a\nhead of health department in Vilnius. Pulkanikas Colonel Usas. Usas saw him on the street and\nsay hey, what are you doing here in Vilnius, you\u2019re in Kaunas. So my father explained to him\nthat yes, I am in Kaunas, my family is in Kaunas, but I can\u2019t -- I don\u2019t have right to work in\nKaunas and I don\u2019t have right to register in Kaunas to live. So I came to Vilnius to see maybe I\ncan do something in here. So Colonel Usas told him look, we\u2019ll do something different. I will not\nput you through that political personnel department. I will hire you as chief accountant and you\u2019 ll\nbe listed as a daily worker, a laborer, so you don\u2019t have to go through the political process. And\nMr. Usas kept my father, as he said, in the health department, protected him as much as he could.\nAnd when the Germans came in Vilnius, the regulation that no Jew is allowed to work for a\ngovernment office came not immediately. So, every morning, when Jews were already wearing\nthe white -- not -- not yellow stars yet, the white armband, white and blue --",
        "A: Yes, white and blue armband -- armband. So Mama used to take my father to the health\ndepartment --\nEnd of Tape Two\nBeginning Tape Three",

        "A: They had --",
        "A: -- okay.",
        "A: That was a law. It was a law advertised on every pole, on every telephone pole, and not only\non the poles, we used to have such a -- that structure, on every couple of cor -- ca -- corners of\nthe street, where you would announce concerts, operas and so on. Everywhere was the new\nregulation issued by the -- signed by the new Lithuanian government, that no more Jewish\nextraction people are allowed to work for a state institution. That was a law. And Usas had no\nway to keep him any longer. He kept him up til that time.",

        "A: Regional co-commissioner for Baltic countries. I can\u2019t tell you exactly now which one is\nwhich, but anyway, Usas or -- Colonel Usas told my father that the only thing I can think what to\ndo in this situation, I\u20191l appoint you as a director of the Jewish hospital. At least you\u2019ll be safe for\nawhile as a director of hospital because, he said, I believe the Germans will not shut the hospital.\nThey are -- they will be afraid of epidemics, typhoid or whatever, so you should be safe in the\nhospital. And -- my father never had anything to do with hospital or anything, but he said well,\nthis is the only thing I can do at the time being, unless you want to go into the hiding. And at that\ntime my father said he is not thinking about hiding. He\u2019ll go with his entire family, which at that\ntime was quite a few in Vilnius, he\u2019ll go and take the position of director of the hospital. And he\nstayed in the hospital for quite awhile.",
        "A: Mm-hm.\nup in Vilnius during the Soviet rule and is able to offer your father protection. And then lasts\nlong enough to still hold that post when the German come -- Germans come in. How 1s that\npossible with a person of such a background, to be able to do this?",
        "A: First of all, he was a doctor [speaks Lithuanian here]",
        "A: A -- he was a doctor ear, nose and throat.",
        "A: So he was not just an administrative person, he was a doctor. So when the Soviets had those\nlists of officers out of the army, he was probably not in the regular army, he was a doctor.",
        "A: He was a doctor. A political person, a doctor. So that\u2019s how he managed to do it. Now, you\nwant me to continue in which direction?",
        "A: Mm-hm.",

So you see, Father was a head of that organization in many places. So the\nSoviets couldn\u2019t digest him. Plus he\u2019s going all over the country, talking about the Finnish war.\nAnd he was known. Father was a member of Jewish -- a Revisionistic organization called Brit\nha-Hayal.",

        "A: I-I wouldn\u2019t say couple of hundred. You see, 1 -- in my memory I see them lined -- lined up\nfor the morning revai and so on. I couldn\u2019t tell you how many they had, but there was quite --\nquite a group. Quite a group.",
        "A: No, no, nothing.",
        "A: You can\u2019t establish Israel in those days. You can\u2019t think about establishing, because it was in\nBritish clutch.",
        "A: It was Palestine. But they did work towards it, which -- which -- I don\u2019t know how they did it.",
        "A: Who were in the camp?",
        "A: Yes I did, but you see, I was four or five years old.",
        "A: I remember they had in our town, in Kaunas was Mr. Dushnitsky and Papa was under Mr.\nDushnitsky.",
        "A: So yi -- one was a leader, he was an assistant. And I remember that after the camp they\nneeded a worker in Lithuanian embassy. And there were two people as candidates. One was my\nfather and another was, I can\u2019t remember now his last name. So anyway, he got that position in\nthat Lithuanian embassy in Palestine.",
        "A: Yeah, there was, there was, yeah.",
        "A: The other person got the job, yeah. That -- what -- you see, I was too small to remember too\nmuch about [indecipherable]",
        "A: Just Lithuanian.",
        "A: Just Lithuanian.",
        "A: Oh yes. A lot of ad -- parents had a lot of friends from the army who were officers from the\nRussian Tsaristic army, incorporated into Lithuanian army.",
        "A: Former Tsarist officers, right. And he had the very, very, very clo -- I -- I would say probably\nthe closest friends. Now let me see. It was Kanaz LaPotion, Kanaz -- what -- what we called him\nin -- in English. [speaks Lithuanian]",
        "A: Gran -- Duke.",
        "A: Duke LaPotion, yeah. But when LaPotions were visiting us, they always spoke Russian.",
        "A: Because their Lithuanian was good, but not so good. His was good, his wife\u2019s not so much.",
        "A: White, white Tsaristic --",
        "A: -- refuges, right, right.",
        "A: Now Mrs. -- Mr. LaPotion\u2019s brother, Kellanos Shablavinskas was the -- was attached to our\npresident of Lithuania.",
        "A: So this was our group, th-the LaPotions, the Shablavinska, but they, because of the w-women,\nwho don\u2019t learn so quick -- the men had to learn the language, but the women didn\u2019t, they spoke\nRussian.",
        "A: But otherwise I never heard Russian in the house.",
        "A: Oh, she pa -- she spoke perfect Russian.",
        "A: You know, I cannot answer the question. I sometimes think to myself, when and where did I\npick up the language? We used to spend summers around Kulautuva.",
        "A: But a lot of Jewish families used to stay in summer --",
        "A: Kulautuva is past -- on the river Nemunas, past Kaunas.",
        "A: Not far away. I imagine those children must have talked Russian, I must have picked it up\nthere. But, in 1940, when the Russians came in, I was graduating and they pushed us to learn\nRussian in that one year. They expected us to pick it up. We didn\u2019t know the alphabet, we didn\u2019t\nknow how to write Russian letters, but we were given ins-instructions every day. We sat in high\nschool til seven o\u2019clock at night. They had --",
        "A: 14.",
        "A: Just verbal, but not during my growing years, I didn\u2019t have anyone to talk Russian.",
        "A: Yeah --",
        "A: No, no, no, not at all.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: My age?",
        "A: The -- the closest friend was the daughter of our minister -- minister what int -- in-interior.\nSku\u00e9as, [indecipherable] Sku\u00e9as.",
        "A: That was my closest friend.",
        "A: [indecipherable] his daughter.",
        "A: When the Russians came in, Skucas took his wife and daughter to the border.",
        "A: Lithuania and Germany. They let his wife and daughter across, the Lithuanian guards\nwouldn\u2019t let [indecipherable] Sku\u00e9as across. He was in the ulttmatum where the Russians put the\nultimatum to our government. They said that they want to have arrested Mr. Sku\u00e9as and Mr.\nPovilaitis, both from Ministry of Interior. So they took Mr. Sku\u00e9as back, he was arrested. When I\nmet Mrs. Sku\u00e9as in Florida, she asked me, Ada, do something, try to find out. Maybe some\nJewish people sat with him somewhere. Maybe anybody knows, whatever there is, we have no\nidea what happened to him. We are read in the paper that he was finished, but no details, no\nplace of burial. And I told her, Mrs. Sku\u00e9as, I say, we have the same problem in our house. We\ndon\u2019t know exact date, we don\u2019t know where, we have no burial and we have no place where he\nis, you know, same thing. So I sympathize with her as much as, you know, because she went\nexactly what my mother went through. And that was my closest friend.",
        "A: Yes. They lived not too far from us, and we were friends since probably the age of four or\nfive. We played together -- we played together with her. For some reason I renamed her Lucia.\nHer name was Judith. I never liked the Judith name, I renamed her Lucia, so that even her\nparents, when I was there, called her Lucia. And --",
        "A: Lithuanian.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Nope, very Jewish.",
        "A: Very Jewish, very Jewish. And that\u2019s a house where I heard a lot of Jewish language. Her\nmother was very famous. She had an atelier. Seam -- seamstress.",
        "A: She had many workers in the atelier, and those workers gradually went to Palestine. They\nused to get the landing permits somehow through the zionis -- Zionist organization, and they\nwent to Palestine. So Lucia, I lost track of her when the Soviets came. And then again, after the\nliberation, I met her in a theater. It was a very difficult moment, and for her and for me.",
        "A: Well, she lost her father, I lost my father. I had no idea that she\u2019s alive, she had no idea that I\nam alive. It -- it was a -- very difficult for me. But anyway -- so otherwise I didn\u2019t have Jewish\nfriends, no. But she had to be -- she was in an e -- two houses away, so we always played\ntogether. That\u2019s the only -- but otherwise in the Jewish society, no, it didn\u2019t happen.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Nothing. Not -- not in that class of people. We were -- I\u2019Il show you the pictures. We had a\nvery large number of Jewish students who excelled, so that from the side of teachers you would\nnever hear anything like that, never.",
        "A: Elite high school, right.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Unlikely.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Wonderful.",
        "A: Wonderful in every way. In every way. I -- I was playing piano. I entered Kaunas\nConservatory. I was very skinny, so my parents decided that I need more muscles, so they put me\nin the ballet school. But our ballet school does not compare to American ballet school. Six days a\nweek, every day, just Sunday off.",
        "A: That was a state ballet school. So, between ballet and conservatory and sports, I had no time\nto be bored or anything. I had a wonderful time, and I was very good in sports also. I loved to\nski. I have a silver medal in Lithuanian ski competitions in the senior group --",
        "A: Yes -- not with mountains, cross country.",
        "A: Cross country s -- right. And I was good runner. So can you imagine having all this and to do\nthe music lessons at home? The high school lessons didn\u2019t bother me, I was very good at that,\nbut the music, you had to do it. So there was no free time. I had the wonderful time, wonderful\nfriends. The skating rink, all they had to do was run down the hill to backyard into the skating\nrink. I have plenty of pictures from skating rink with all my friends. And since I was the\nyoungest, I always was the smallest one, but that didn\u2019t matter.",
        "A: Never.",
        "A: Never. Some of my mother\u2019s friends -- and my mo-mo-mother\u2019s and father friends went to\nAmerica cause they had t -- families in America, but they went only when the Soviets came, via\nJapanese help, you know, the Japanese consul?",
        "A: Yes, with his help, they went. We heard a lot of what was going in Germany because we used\nto spend summer in Palanga, and in the late part of 30\u2019s, the German -- Germans used to come to\nPalanga and they used to tell us more or less what\u2019s going on. But we never thought it concerns\nus. We never thought that Hitler one day will take Klaipeda and so on and so on.",
        "A: What was it, 30 --",
        "A: Okay, it started with the big -- big case of Sass and Neuman. Lithuania caught the spies Sass\nand Neuman and put them on trial.",
        "A: Germany.",
        "A: German spies in Lithuania. They were put on trial and I think since that trial, the atmosphere\nbetween Germany and Lithuania started to get worse and worse. And then one day Hitler put an\nultimatum and that\u2019s when all the Lithuanians ran out from hi -- Zemaitija, from Klaip\u00e9da\nregion, to Kaunas.",
        "A: Mem -- Klaip\u00e9da, in German [indecipherable] yeah.",
        "A: Exodus.",
        "A: Absolute -- absolute exodus.",
        "A: Oh yes, oh yes, they entered our high schools, they entered our society and everything.",
        "A: They didn\u2019t experience anything, they just ran. It was an exodus to run.",
        "A: They left --",
        "A: -- yes, they left everything. But it still didn\u2019t give us even th -- if you talk to the German\npopulation, many of them say they didn\u2019t know a lot. We didn\u2019t know a lot either.",
        "A: Nobody thought that a civilized nation like German nation will be able to do atrocities of the\nkind that they did.",
        "A: You know what was the main talking?",
        "A: Food.",
        "A: We have no butter. You have shortage of this, this and that. That was their main thing coming\nto Palanga.",
        "A: They never mentioned political pressure, see? So we had no idea. We -- we knew that it\u2019s not\nas good as it used to be before, but our Jewish people still kept going to Germany for trade. The\nvisas were open, you could go in and back. So you see we didn\u2019t -- we didn\u2019t know. There is a\nbook by a Lithuanian writer, [indecipherable]",
        "A: I have the book. In that book she describes the survival of two Jewish girls.",
        "A: And when I was reading that book I figured, uh-oh, I think I know who she 1s. She was in my\nschool. Her father had factory, I know the name. And somehow, when I was vacationing in\nMaine, I came to talk about the book with one of Lithuanian singers from Canada, and -- Kabliss.\nAnd he said, oh you\u2019re right, that\u2019s her. But she doesn\u2019t have -- she has nothing to do with people\nfrom that times. And just why, what\u2019s wrong? I -- he said, I don\u2019t know, but she doesn\u2019t want to\nknow anybody, she only keeps in touch with the family who saved her. So, why did we come to\nthis now, I can\u2019t understand.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Oh, oh. Her father -- she was attending ballet school with me, and I remember her father\ngoing to Germany and I remember her father bringing her beautiful, black shoes. And th-that\u2019s\nwhy I remember [indecipherable]. Her father kept going to Germany back and forth in business.\nHe had the big stocking factory.",
        "A: And he just went and came back. Nothing -- nothing to -- so that\u2019s way -- when you say that,\ndid we know? No, we didn\u2019t know.",
        "A: No, no.",
        "A: When they entered.",
        "A: No. Before, I used to stay very often with the Sku\u00e9as family, and I remember once at the\ndinner, he had the conversation with his wife, the Russians started to tell us that couple of Soviet\nsoldiers have disappeared. And he said it -- 1t\u2019s an awful provocation. But in those days he didn\u2019t\nthink that it\u2019I]1 come -- that\u2019 be a reason for the Russians to tell that they are coming to liberate\nLithuania.",
        "A: Right. That we did something to a couple of their soldiers and the soldiers disappeared, as if.",
        "A: See, that was -- that was the beginning.",
        "A: That is pre-premonition that there\u2019s some -- and then they introduced -- no, they introduced\nSoviet bases, basi, bases for Russian soldiers. They were not going out of the way, so they stayed\non the base. And that\u2019s when they said that couple of soldiers disappeared from the base and\nnever returned. And that was a main thing, as if, to liberate us.",
        "A: 14.",
        "A: Oh yeah, I'll tell you.",
        "A: Okay.\nBeginning Tape Four",
        "A: Nothing until they crossed the border and marched into Lithuanian territory. Nothing.",
        "A: Oh perfectly.",
        "A: The -- the Russian army, on little horses. Most of the riders slanted eyed, was the\n[indecipherable] nation --",
        "A: -- marching through our Avenue of Liberty in Kaunas, straight. And that\u2019s when I told you\nPapa took me and my mother to the Museum of War, and we spent with a crowd of people there.\nWe couldn\u2019t stand any more that pressure, watching the Soviets get into the country.",
        "A: Well, there are many pictures.",
        "A: And when you look at the pictures, you can see the percentage. So I don\u2019t want to answer\nhow many or not how many, just look at the pictures, and there is a -- different features of these\ntwo nationalities.",
        "A: Not from my close friends, but I want to tell you, out of 30 students, of the 30 pupils at the\ntime when the Soviet entered, we graduated nine. It was all what\u2019s left from 30.",
        "A: Either deported to Siberia, or cross the border.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: The loss of my father\u2019s job, the closing of bank accounts and introducing the s -- how many\nSquare yards per person you were allowed to have. So we were forced, in a nice way, to accept\ntwo families to live together.",
        "A: It was an apartment.",
        "A: A-According to our code -- conditions in Kaunas it was a large apartment. Three big rooms,\nplus a smaller room for the servant, kitchen, bathroom and so on. So, we had a family in each\nroom, and we were squeezed into one room. But this was survivable, this was not a tragedy.\nWhat affected more were the deportations.",
        "A: Father, as I mentioned before, was in Vilnius working for the health department. I was going\nthrough my last exams and sint -- deportations started Thursday night.",
        "A: June.",
        "A: \u201841",
        "A: Couple of weeks before the war started.",
        "A: Mother couldn\u2019t get through on the telephone to Vilnius to find out what\u2019s going on. She was\nclimbing the walls, we -- we didn\u2019t know what\u2019s going on. So she said look, Ill get the suitcase\nready. I'll put Father\u2019s winter clothing into the suitcase. The moment you finish your exam,\nwe\u2019re running to the railway station, we\u2019re going to Vilnius. And we came by rail to Vilnius.\nThat was Saturday. Sunday morning the first bombs fell on Vilnius.",
        "A: We were on the lists.",
        "A: But my father wasn\u2019t there and they couldn\u2019t find our house. The house stood in between two\nstreets on a hill. You couldn\u2019t access it from down, because it was locked, and you couldn\u2019t find\nit from the top, because you couldn\u2019t find it.",
        "A: It was a very lucky and unlucky situation. Sometimes you know, I was thinking, if we would\nhave been all together, and if we would been deported, maybe -- maybe he would survive. But I\ndon\u2019t give much chance to it because I don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t think he would survive. Usually they --\nthey shot the man from the beginning. So anyway, that what happened. I had the white dress on,\nMama had a light purple dress on. That was all we had, nothing. We didn\u2019t realize that -- what is\ncoming this morning, so we thought we\u2019ll leave him this stuff in case, for deporf -- deportations,\nwe come back to Kaunas. We couldn\u2019t get back.",
        "A: Germ -- German army came in next morning. I mean, the war started next morning.",
        "A: We were already in Vilnius Saturday night.",
        "A: And war started Sunday morning.",
        "A: Yeah, ye -- deportations happened two weeks before --",
        "A: -- on the 14\" - 15\" --",
        "A: -- that\u2019s when the deportations started, yeah, two weeks before the war.",
        "A: In case --",
        "A: -- yes, yeah.",
        "A: So I told you, out of 30 we were left nine.",
        "A: Trying now to tell you. You see, first night we didn\u2019t know what\u2019s going on. M -- I had my\nexams, and the next morning when I went to school, there were fewer of us. The first ones that\nwere deported was our previous diplomatic ministry in Rome, Charnetskis\u2019 -- Charnetski, they\nwere my very close friends, all three children, they had five children and all the Charnetskis\u2019\nlived very close and th -- it was their daughter Lucia, I was especially close. And char -- no,\nCharnetskis weren\u2019t taken the first days because -- no, you\u2019re right, Charnetskis were taken the\nfirst night and they didn\u2019t show up for Friday\u2019s exam. Then we noticed next day some others\ndidn\u2019t show up for the exam. By that time the town already knew what was going on. And you\nknow what\u2019s very interesting? That week we had posters all over that [indecipherable] KGB\nchoir 1s giving concerts in our city. And nobody put two and two together, why suddenly we\nhave a KGB choir. See, this way they -- people saw them on the street, but 1t didn\u2019t occur to\nthem that this is the help for deportations. They came under auspices of musical unit, which they\n-- they were musical unit. But at the same time we had ta -- ca -- th-the city full of\n[indecipherable] people. So now when the deportations started, the people who later on kept us\nfor two years in hiding, they were originally from Kaunas and Vilnius, and then their parents and\nbrother were deported, the first night. And their children were already sent to the fi --\ngrandparents for summer vacations. They were not --",
        "A: June. And they took the whole family, the grandparents, the son and the two children, put\nthem all into the echelon. Echelon came to Vilnius, but the children were not on the list, so they\ntook the children out of the echelon and tell them, go home. So they came --",
        "A: Out of the train, and they went home and they told exactly what has happened, that the whole\nechelon is full of people going to Siberia, and --",
        "A: They didn\u2019t know what was, it was Kazakhstan, Siberia, whatever, but they knew that\nsomething awful is going on. So that was what compelled tha -- it was a huge farm, huge one --\nthey went right away to -- to take care of th -- of the place [indecipherable]",
        "A: And that was the first information that we had directly, what\u2019s going on.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No, no, no.",
        "A: They had lists. The lists were made by the political personnel office, [indecipherable]",
        "A: The political personnel office. Don\u2019t forget that when you looked for a job, when Soviets\ncame, you had to give information three generations back. You, your parents, your grandparents.\nSo they had very good information about everybody.",
        "A: Absolutely. And I experienced [indecipherable] one in the sports circle. We had a very highly\ntrained group of sportsmen, and that group was supposed to represent Lithuania in Moscow\nsports festival. And you know between sport people, you took [indecipherable] you -- sports\nhere, sport there. Anyway, just about a month before the departure we were told that we are\ngoing through the political indoctrination group. And each one of us had to fill out the form,\ngiving back, again, three generations who we are, and out of the group remained about a quarter.\n75 percent were not acceptable, and the leader of the group was a Soviet lieutenant from\nGeorgia, Chechyan, he said my God, what am I going to do? I have to ship the group to Moscow\nand I have 25 percent of the group. So he turned -- you -- he -- he knew -- we didn\u2019t know about\nthat sport and polit -- politics are just having something in common. He turned to the\norganizations, all kinds of sport organizations, clubs of the workers, factories and so on and he\ngot people, but he had one month to train.",
        "A: He had one -- he said it\u2019s unbelievable, how can I do it, I don\u2019t know. But [indecipherable]\nthe war came, there was no parade or anything, so --",
        "A: His problem was solved, right. But that\u2019s how the Soviet operated, see? So by not -- by se --\nsending 75 percent of the group out, you gave them a idea what\u2019s going to happen to them.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, in summer dr --",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yes. Now, when we heard airplanes overhead, that was Sunday morning, I went to a line to\nget some bread, I was standing in a line. The bigger bombings started at night. But since my\nuncle was working from Bank of Lithuania, and the bank has vaults under the ground, we all\nwent to the Bank of Lithuania to wait until the bombs stopped falling. And we found everybody\nwho was working for the bank was downstairs in the vaults.",
        "A: In the health department, yeah.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: Well, in the morning we went back to the apartment. My -- in the apartment was my uncle,\nhis wife, she was very pregnant and my father\u2019s mama.",
        "A: Solomon, his wife and his -- my father\u2019s -- my grandmother and my father. And then Mama\nand I.",
        "A: Oh, two rooms, because it was Soviet -- Soviet time, you couldn\u2019t have any more.",
        "A: Lot of people, yeah.",
        "A: I think it started with Jewish families being physically thrown out of big apartments in\ndowntown Vilnius.",
        "A: Both.",
        "A: And the German officers who needed apartments.",
        "A: And the help, Lithuanian help. There were no yellow stars yet. There was no -- no walking on\nsidewalk yet. The first what I remember, all the Jews have to bring to the police station, all radio\n-- radios. Think next one was all Jew --",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No, because we were [indecipherable] for Jewish. Next one was all the Jews are su -- to --\nposed to bring to police station, all jewels. And people did. Then, around that time I think there\nwas a provocation. The Germans accused that a German soldier was killed. That was the first\ntime that was something very ugly.",
        "A: I think they called the Jewish elders, a committee of the elders, Judenrat --",
        "A: And they put a fine in so many Jewish people, they had to report. But it still didn\u2019t -- didn\u2019t\ngive people any idea.",
        "A: A -- a soldier, a soldier was killed. The Germans claimed it and they -- then they called the\nmembers of Judenrat and told them that they have to -- to send so many -- I don\u2019t remember now\nthe number, so many people to report to Lukisk\u00e9s, to the jail.",
        "A: Jail.",
        "A: After that, next one was Jewish people wearing the, about three inches wide, white with blue,\nthe Jewish Magen David on the sleeve.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: After that was no walking on sidewalks.",
        "A: In -- in what sense did that affect me? I mean, I -- I mentioned before that Father was still\nworking at health department, Mama would go every morning with him too, and every afternoon\nto pick him up. She would hold him under the arm so that her hands was on his thing.",
        "A: Yes, I know, but in Vilnius nobody knew me. In Kaunas I wouldn\u2019t be able to -- to hide it.",
        "A: No.",

        "A: There -- what I knew -- what I knew about Kaunas was that Kaunas was given one month\u2019s\ntime for Jewish population. They were given the borders bordering streets where they should\nmove for future ghetto. And in Kaunas the whole thing went in an orderly manner. The Jewish\npeople took their furniture, took the -- took their belongings into that area. They had one month\u2019s\ntime to do it. In Vilnius there was no warning at all. The apartment which my Uncle S-Solomon\nhad was in a building that was the last building before ghetto wall. And when --",
        "A: Rudninku gatve.",
        "A: Right there, right there.",
        "A: And when the Lithuanian army soldiers came to put the boards to enclose, my uncle went\ndownstairs, and he spoke perfect Lithuanian and he told the soldier, look, my wife is expecting a\nbaby any day, and my old mother, please let us climb, as long as you are not too high yet. They\njust started, and the soldiers said, go ahead, right away. So he took his mother, his wi -- pregnant\nwife and himself, they climbed that started wall and they went inside. Now, the others were\ntaken out to Lukiskes.",
        "A: Outside the border, outside.",
        "A: Oh no, no, no, no, no, no.",
        "A: That was the last building before the ghetto border.",
        "A: They climbed the wall, went into the area.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Without a place to live. But they were fortunate because they weren\u2019t pushed to the jail, to\nLukiske\u00e9s jail. They escaped sure death, because all the others who didn\u2019t think so quick, they\nwere already taken to LukiSkes and they never showed up any more.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Police.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Jewels, yes.",
        "A: Yes, yeah.",
        "A: And then -- then this started the -- the most awful period of the Jews being dragged from\napartments by hapunes, by -- by the helpers.",
        "A: Lithuanian helpers, right. That\u2019s when I told you the incident with -- did you -- you asked me",
        "A: -- whether there are other Lithuanian officers. That was what happened to Mr. Gornionski.\nNow what happened in our case, normally when th-these -- see, in Vilnius, every house had a --\nwhat would you call it 1-in English? Not a janitor, but it was a --",
        "A: Not housekeeper. It was a person who took --",
        "A: A super, right.",
        "A: And all those supers knew everybody. So when they -- the Lithuanians came to take people,\nthe super would take them to every door. She knew who lives where. So normally when they --\nthey -- they would come, Mama would come out, and said no, there are no more Jews in here.\nJust like that. But that particular time it didn\u2019t work out. The super stood behind and Mama came\nout, I came out, the grandmother came to the hallway, because her Lithuanian was perfect. And\nthe question was, any more Jews inside? And we couldn\u2019t -- couldn\u2019t hide any more, the super\nwas standing right behind. So, that\u2019s probably the most difficult scene I\u2019ve seen in my life. He\ncame into -- the hallway was little, the hallway. He came into the first room. My father was\nstanding, my uncle was standing, grandmother was there, Mama and I. We returned back. My\nfather wore the army officer\u2019s boots, and the -- the army pants. And he said, well, take a piece of\nsoap, take one towel and let\u2019s go. Now, we already knew what let\u2019s go more or less means. It\u2019s\nLukisk\u00e9s.",
        "A: That\u2019s a Lithuanian.",
        "A: Mama started to talk to him. She said look, you\u2019re a young man, you\u2019re attending college. My\nhusband fought for independence. He put his books away, he finished high school after he\nreturned from the front. He is one of the Lithuanian volunteer fighters. Please leave him here.\nUnder no circumstances. Under no circumstances. My mother went on her knees. She grabbed\nhis hands, she started kissing his hands, begging him, please understand that he is not just a\nperson, he is person who fought for you. And somehow finally, he agreed, with Mama on her\nknees, he agreed to leave my father.",
        "A: Oh, not today, not today. I wouldn\u2019t recognize him.",
        "A: His attitude? I couldn\u2019t care less, probably I would describe it. He was told to get as many\nJews as he can, and my uncle was standing behind my father. So my mother said to him again,\nlisten, that\u2019s their mother. You left one son and you\u2019re taking the other son. I\u2019m begging you,\nplease leave both sons to their mother. And she managed to get my uncle left. When -- when --",
        "A: No, the men, men.",
        "A: Take a piece of soap, take one towel, you\u2019re going to build the east west, or whatever it was,\nhighway. After he left our room, Mama told me, go to the kitchen, see what\u2019s going on. That was\nSoviet time. Every room had a family, and the owner of that huge house had his room. So I went\nout and I\u2019ve seen that from the other room, they\u2019re taking a husband. His wife was pregnant with\na child too. And I went closer to the owner\u2019s room, and I looked through the keyhole. So what I\ncould see was a man told him to give all the jewels first of all. You know, he took his watch, he\ntook his rings. And then they took -- the man was in his probably, 80\u2019s, very old person, to build\na highway. So anyway, after that, Mama ran to Mr. Gornionski\u2019s place, because they were\nkicked out from their luxurious apartment by German officers. But in a -- in a polite way. But\nthey had to leave everything behind. She ran to the place where they lived with that -- sharing\napartment with that Lithuanian officer, and that when Mama found out what happened to Mr.\nGornionski. And then the major from our military place, Major Songinas ran to Luki8sk\u00e9s to find\nhim and couldn\u2019t find him, that that was the end of it, yeah.",
        "A: These are the first days, yeah, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah --",
        "A: -- yeah, yeah, yeah --",
        "A: -- yeah, yeah. And the -- the most unfortunate thing was that the ghetto area was small, and\nthe population in Vilnius was big. And there was no warning and there was nothing to make\npeople go into the area. So they couldn\u2019t fit so many, so they just took the upflow, what there\nwas, Overflow to the jail, and from jail to Paneriai for liquidation.",
        "A: No, no, people didn\u2019t know what. Now, about knowing that, I'll come back to you. While\nFather was the head of Jewish hospital, one night --",
        "A: Sure.\nBeginning Tape Five",
        "A: Everybody. When -- when the exodus to ghetto started, it was everybody. Just leave the\nhouse. Old, young, baby, whatever. Everybody had to leave.",
        "A: As long as ghetto had enough place for those people, they went into the ghetto area.",
        "A: When -- there is no explanation why certain groups was taken straight to Lukiskes.",
        "A: Straight to the prison, another -- another side of town. The view that you saw was awful.\nPeople didn\u2019t know what\u2019s going on. People thought that they are being grouped into ghetto.\nThey were dragging pillows, blankets, pots and pans, whatever they, in the panic they managed\nto take. The Polish population stood outside this on the sidewalks making fun. The atmosphere\nwas awful, just awful. Now, that day a -- Father told me to go to Colonel Usas home and stay\nwith them, cause we didn\u2019t know how much the Nuremberg laws will affect me, because the --\nthe nu --",
        "A: Oh yes, oh yes, oh yes.",
        "A: Oh yes. It -- but it\u2019s a -- Nuremberg laws affect three generations. Not the fi -- I was the first\ngeneration, and then my parents and then my grandparents. So I stayed with [indecipherable]\nUsas, and Mama took my father\u2019s war medals and went to see our Prime Minister, Kubilunas.",
        "A: And she -- she managed to get into his office, and she told him, General, have a look at these\ndocuments. It\u2019s your signature on my husband\u2019s war medals. Aren\u2019t you able to do something to\nhelp me? And Kubilunas was very polite, but he told my mother, Ponia -- Madam, there 1s\nnothing I can do in Jewish question. It\u2019s in the hands of the Germans and my hands are tied. I\ncannot do a thing. So Mother\u2019s only hope, that Kubilunas maybe will help, disappeared. He\ncouldn\u2019t do a thing. And you couldn\u2019t do a thing. It was all in the hands of Gestapo, and that was\nit. And the SS.",
        "A: He was in Vilnius, he was in ghetto, he was the head of Jewish hospital.",
        "A: No. The Lithuanian -- I think at that time that -- no, Mama went to Kaunas. He was in -- in\nKaunas. Our first government, Kubilunas was the head of the government, was in Kaunas.",
        "A: So when Mama came back from Kaunas, she told my father that she couldn\u2019t do anything.\nNow, I started to tell you --",
        "A: -- \u2019m sorry. You asked me, did the people know what\u2019s going on. Quite awhile before ghetto,\none night, I believe about five people escaped the shooting place Paneriai. There were three not\nconnected, I think, women and two children, not connected in between. They managed to survive\nthe shooting in the pit, and that night got out of the pit, found the two children alive, and they\nwalked to Vilnius in the dark, towards Jewish hospital. When they came into the hospital, my\nfather took them to a separate area and started to question.",
        "A: He\u2019s director of the hospital and they were all bleeding, so he sent his personnel with hot\nwater to wash the blood from the sidewalks so that if the Germans catch it, there wouldn\u2019t be no",
        "A: -- trail which way did they go. The Germans didn\u2019t catch it anyway. But my father isolated\nthese people in the separate part of hospital because he was afraid of general panic. And he put\nthe lady, by the name Mrs. Salinski, she was from Kaunas. She was a nurse -- she di -- no-not\npractically, she was -- she was a real, registered nurse but she wasn\u2019t practicing, and she was in\ncharge of these people. The only person that went in and out, until he figured out what to do,\nbecause he didn\u2019t know whether the Germans will find or not. So by that time my father already\nhad an idea what\u2019s going on in Paneriai. That\u2019s it\u2019s not going to build the highway east w-west or\nwhatever, that is going straight to the pits to be shot.",
        "A: Oh, that\u2019s absolutely.",
        "A: Absolutely, because that -- that went to -- straight to LukiSkes, yeah.\nare left in the streets, and if they\u2019re in the streets, then they\u2019re taken to LukiSkes prison and then\nfrom there they\u2019re taken to Paneriai, but people don\u2019t know that yet. Is that correct?",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: Before.",
        "A: Before. No ghetto yet.",
        "A: After.",
        "A: After. Because at the time that he was supposed to be taken, he was still working for health\ndepartment.",
        "A: See?",
        "A: Uncle.",
        "A: No, I do -- I do --",
        "A: I\u2019m trying to figure out how [indecipherable]. Pll tell you what, the house was to -- supposed\nto be Jew free. There was not supposed to be any more Jews in the building, see.",
        "A: Yeah, they -- he took all the others from the apartment.",
        "A: Mama and I and uncle and grandmother, we stayed in it.",
        "A: In reality, yeah.",
        "A: That\u2019s where we stayed until ... Mama decided it was too dangerous to stay, for me. We got a\nroom Kalinauskas Gatve, in Kalinauskas Street, in an apartment where the owner of the\napartment was a refugee from Poland, from Warsaw. Another room was take --",
        "A: Polish Gentile refugees. Another room was by a -- also Polish refugee from Warsaw, of\nGerman extraction. And third room was ours. We moved out because you -- y -- it was too da --\ndangerous to be there. It wasn\u2019t easy to get rooms. It was through the help of a Lithuanian person\nwho knew who we are and who helped us to get a room. In those you had the -- you -- that was a\nleftover of Soviet regulations, you had a certain area and you had a person in charge of that area.\nSo he was a person who worked in the administrative office, and he helped us to get a room\nbecause he knew our situation. So that\u2019s where we moved out.",
        "A: He wasn\u2019t there.",
        "A: Yeah. He passed away, oh, he -- he passed away somewhere -- I just remember my father\nwearing the black on his sleeve; that was, you know, custom in Europe. I must have been around,\nno more than nine - 10.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: He passed away.",
        "A: But in ghetto, in the first time when I came in, in one room we had grandmother, father,\nuncle, his wife, newborn baby, a cousin, her husband, her mother. So we had eight people in a\nroom let\u2019s say like from here to here.",
        "A: Eight people in that room, yeah.",
        "A: Mm.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: The sh -- Siauliai brother --",
        "A: -- was in Siauliai with his wife and newborn baby, too.",
        "A: Ephrain.",
        "A: Yeah, Siauliai. Now, the youngest brother --",
        "A: Reuben had a very strange story. He was betrothed to get married, and in the first day of\ndeportation --",
        "A: Yeah, in the first day of deportation, they took hi -- the family of -- his fianc\u00e9e and her family.\nHe was getting out of his mind. So he said, I\u2019m going to beg an -- KGB to let me follow the\ntransport. Mama said look, don\u2019t even try. It won\u2019t work. The KGB 1s not going to let you follow\nthe transport. So he said to me, go with me, I know where their offices are, private, not official.\nYou stay on the other side of the street. If 1 don\u2019t come out, so you know that I didn\u2019t come out.\nAnyway, I was waiting across the street, he came --",
        "A: Still in Kaunas.",
        "A: That was before, the first night.",
        "A: So he said they wouldn't even t-talk. No, that\u2019s no and no. So, when the war started, he took\nmy bicycle and he told my mother\u2019s sister that, listen, Pll try, maybe I'll catch up with the train.\nThe trains are not going very fast, they\u2019re overloaded. Maybe I\u2019 Il catch up with my fianc\u00e9e on\nthe train. And from that day on, we never heard anything about him. Later on, somebody told us\nthat he did manage to get to Soviet Union, but whether he found her or not, I don\u2019t know. But he\nnever returned. So, that means --",
        "A: He disappeared, yeah.",
        "A: No, no, no. I -- I looked at the 16\" division. The 16\" division had all their Lithuanian citizens\nin 16\" division. Nobody knew that he was in divis --",
        "A: Soviet army, 16\" division --",
        "A: Yes, but he wasn\u2019t there.",
        "A: So we figured that -- my aunt told him that, don\u2019t take anything, just take the bicycle and go.\nBut he wanted to take some clothing and this and that on -- on my bicycle. So he said look,\ntheyll kill you for the bicycle, don\u2019t take anything, just as -- 1f you can, peddle as much as you\ncan. But we don\u2019t know, you know, what happened to him.",
        "A: Somebody told as if --",
        "A: -- you know, like as if my father is buried here, or as if my father is buried there. It\u2019s nothing\nthat -- to tie together.",
        "A: Mm-hm, no, no, no, not reliable at all.",
        "A: Yeah, sad thing.",
        "A: He was crazy when they deported her, just crazy. Well, you know, so, that\u2019s life.",
        "A: Three brothers.",
        "A: And her, yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Everybody was in Vilnius.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: You know, I grew up Lithuanian.",
        "A: Not that I felt Jewish, but I mean, I had a lot of solidarity, I had a lot of -- you know, it\u2019s --\nit\u2019s very difficult to define. You stand in the middle of two sides. You don\u2019t take any sides. If it\u2019s\nnecessary you\u2019re here, if it\u2019s necessary you\u2019re here, and that\u2019s how you grow up. I was never\ninfluenced by one side to be against another side. So I -- I really cannot tell you, but I grew up\nLithuanian, but at the same time I have a lot in common with the Jewish nation. I know much\nmore -- when my cousin of the -- the Uncle Ephrain\u2019s daughter, when they finally eve -- returned\nfrom Vorkuta and when he found his family and when she came to visit me, she knew nothing\nabout Jewish customs or anything. I took her to synagogue and she just looked around. I showed\nher, though the custom [indecipherable] everything which we all -- we all know here, she had no\nidea, she grew up in Soviet Union. But at the same time I tried -- we have a very large population\nin West Hartford of refugees from Soviet Union. We don\u2019t call them Jewish, we call them\nRussians. I do a lot for them. And th-that\u2019s -- you know, when my mother went to see f -- Prime\nMinister Kubilunas, and when she came back and she was asking my father, please do not accept\nany official position. Be a private person. Because his military friends wanted him to get out and\nstay in Lithuania, in the states, and forget the thing. And then one day he told my mother, you\nknow what, wh-whichever things were, whichever things are, I see how my nation is suffering, I\ncannot do it. I cannot go into hiding and leave things the way they are in ghetto, because there\nwas a chaos. Can you imagine the Judenrat? Judenrat was a representative of each Jewish\norganization. There were so many [indecipherable] and Bundists and whatever you want, all\nJewish gentlemen with big beards. Can you imagine a German officer coming to talk to them? It\n-- it wasn\u2019t possible.",
        "A: It wasn\u2019t possible. They spoke Polish, they spoke Yiddish, they didn\u2019t speak German. And\nthey knew that in the hospital there\u2019s something organized. Working, and working very, very\nwell. He surrounded himself, since we didn't know the Polish Jews, he surrounded himself with\nJews from Kaunas. And they really had a atmosphere of work. The first German request from the\nhospital for so many people, he had a separate section for syphilitics. So, you don\u2019t play God, but\nyou try to do something. So the first German request got the syphilitics.",
        "A: No, no.",
        "A: Well, he explained to my mother, that in order to save healthy people, cause the syphilitics\ndidn\u2019t have very long to live one way or the other, and he was afraid to spread syphilis. The\nGermans didn\u2019t know that they were syphilitics, but they -- that\u2019s what Germans received,\nsyphilitics. And that was his idea all the time, to save whatever he can. He believed, which was\nreally very strange, he told to teach the children Hebrew. And the population was aghast, what\nfor? What do they need the Hebrew for, they\u2019re going to die. So he said, they may die, and they\nmay survive. If they survive, where do you think they\u2019Il want to stay, in Vilnius? It\u2019s -- it\u2019s --\nthat\u2019s you -- you know, place of their families? They\u2019ll want to go to Israel. They should stop\ntalking in Jewish, they should learn Hebrew, so if a day comes and God willing they are s --\nliving, they can integrate themselves into the Israeli society. See, he had different ideas from the\nothers. He discussed with the rabbinical committee in -- in ghetto, about how he is doing it.\nBecause naturally they say you cannot play God. But he told them, look, I am giving, for\nexample, 20 li -- li -- documents for life for the hospital doctors. And I don\u2019t know these doctors\nin person, they were all Polish doctors. I lined them up 1n line and I tell the youngest ones, which\nin my opinion, by face and by the physique, look the youngest ones, I tell the 20 come forward.\nSo he says to my mother, how would you think, Elenka? Should I save a young doctor who may\nsurvive and have children, or should I pick out a famous professor who is 80 years old? Now\nwhat would you do in my place? And you know, I was right there during the conversation.\nMama said, you know, I -- I cannot tell you how to behave. But it\u2019s very difficult for my father\nto pick out who lives, who doesn\u2019t live. But in a way, he had his opinion about it, that the\nstrongest will survive, whether survive in ghetto or whether later on in the forest, but you have to\ngive them a chance. Now, what chance can you give an 80 year old professor? See, that was how\nhe was -- how he would [inaudible]",
        "A: Oh yes.",
        "A: Four -- age 14 - 15, yeah, absolutely, absolutely. We had a lot of these conversations with\n[indecipherable] Panana Simait\u00e9. You know about her.",
        "A: I found out who was she from the Lithuanian press now in Lithuania. There was an article by\nher brother who for the first time said that she was a communist. I do -- I believe I still have the\nnewspaper. Panana Simait\u00e9 was a librarian in Vilnius University. And Panana Simait\u00e9 like us,\nhad a permission to enter ghetto from Major Bourakas, another officer. And he gave her\npermission to enter ghetto as if she\u2019s studying the Jewish old literature. And we met her in\nghetto. She was hiding a group of Jewish people in the attic of Vilnius University library. In\nsummer it wasn\u2019t so bad, but in winter it was awfully cold. Getting food in was one thing, getting\nwaste out was another thing. So Panana Simait\u00e9 regularly, on the clock, was in our place at four\no\u2019clock in the afternoon.",
        "A: No --",
        "A: -- that was out. And my father would come for dinner around four o\u2019clock. So shem --\nSimait\u00e9 and my father, they would always get into all kinds of political conversation and this and\nthat. And sure -- I remember one day my father said, you know, I am pretty sure that she is a\nmember of communist party. By her attitude, by you know, her answers and so on. But that\ndidn\u2019t -- that didn\u2019t scare us away. The thing was that Panana Simait\u00e9 used to come and get food\nevery day, and we -- she had such a metal -- metal little, like a bucket. And she would get a\nbucket full of food and carry to the attic, to the Vilnius, that --",
        "A: No.",
        "A: He was already the head of the ghetto, yeah.",
        "A: And that was day after day after day. Why did we start talking about Simait\u00e9 now?",
        "A: Now, I would say I -- I identified myself Lithuanian.",
        "A: I -- I don\u2019t think this was -- this was less because of religion or nationality. I think that would\nbe for a person unbelievable to watch from a point of human attitude. You didn\u2019t have to be a\nJew or a Czech or a French, just to be treated like that. I mean, it was a double -- you know, it\nwas a double, the way I was brought up, in a humane way, to watch that was beyond your\nunderstanding. It\u2019s not just that because the people were Jewish, because they were people. They\nwere not cattle, they were not animals, they were people. To watch people doing that to people,\nthat was very difficult to watch.",
        "A: Well, that was po-political, I would say. You see, we didn\u2019t see the night deportations.\nWhatever we heard after mostly was that Russian soldiers were correct. The ones that came and\ntold people pack up your stuff and go into the truck. What we knew, what was going on in the\nbuilding of KGB, that people were tortured, and they found later the traces of it --",
        "A: This is one thing, but the cooperation didn\u2019t have to be so voluntarily. The cooperation was a\n-- I would say a result of the red flags, of the heads of political personnel --",
        "A: Lithuanian.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: No, I say -- I say this -- this is what it is. It didn\u2019t have to be so voluntarily.",
        "A: It didn\u2019t have --",
        "A: -- I -- I believe st -- very strongly that the two weeks before that, if the deportations wouldn\u2019t\nbe there, if we wouldn\u2019t have had a whole year of political personnel treatment, of not having a\nright to live where you are, of having everything confiscated of what you ha --\nEnd of Tape Five\nBeginning Tape Six",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: I don\u2019t believe you can explain. I s -- think maybe you could say what motivated them to do\nit. Motivation can be all kinds, could be greed, could be jealousy. There was no hatred such in\nLithuania per se, there was no hatred. We received our independence from the Polish -- from the\nRussian Tsars regime. Russia is famous. The first pogroms were in Russia. We didn't have a\nword pogrom in our language per se, we didn\u2019t use that word. We never had pogroms in our\ncountry. The Russians were not able to switch that ugly behavior of theirs in our territory. But\nthe seeds probably remained. On one side they lived as neighbors, very well together. Again,\nplease -- I remember that during the Russian Tsars time, the Jewish people were not allowed to\nown land. And the reason they all went into business was not because they wanted to be business\npeople, they were not allowed to work the land. So one came with the other. So naturally, if he\nwas, say, a tailor or shoemaker or he was bringing in his drosken kucher, some kind of\nmerchandise to the farmers, that was the only way to survive. So after so many years of Russian\noccupation, the first one, the Tsaristic occupation, that remains. Now naturally, if you are a poor\nfarmer and you work from four o\u2019clock in the morning til late at night, and ri -- next door your\nJewish tailor is doing a good business sewing and this and that and he doesn\u2019t have to get up and\nmilk his cows and maybe that brought some kind of a jealousy? But we never had incidents in\nour villages, in our towns. We never had a Jewish Lithuanian incidents.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Deportations and red flags. Ill sti --",
        "A: Red flags.",
        "A: Yeah. I'll stick to that. Cause I was one of those. It\u2019s -- except that I -- I couldn\u2019t\n[indecipherable] as low as that, but the feeling inside was awful. The feeling inside was awful.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: No, and I told you before, according to percentage, according to figures, the bigger\npercentage of Jewish population was deported in Lithuania. You see, out of the total.",
        "A: There was not 30 percent of Lithuanians deported, but there were 30 percent of Jewish\npopulation deported. So it\u2019s not logical, because actually there were very many friendships in\nSiberia that we Jews helping Lithuanians, Lithuanians helping the Jews, the old way, the way it\nwas before in the country. Because they were all thrown into the same kettle.",
        "A: So there -- there is no explanation. We can go back to Tsaristic times, to that Tsaristic hatred,\nto Tsarist -- Tsaristic pogroms. But again explain why didn\u2019t we have a pogrom in our country?\nNot a single one. We -- we knew the word, we knew the concept, but we never used the word in\nour language. See, that\u2019s what very strange, wa -- how suddenly -- I have only my personal\nexplanation is deportations and red flags. That really made, you know, the [indecipherable] in a\nvery ugly way.",
        "A: Mm.",
        "A: I mentioned that Mama went to talk to the Prime Minister ku -- Kubilunas and before she left\nshe begged my father not to take any official duties. Not to be tied, so that his name wouldn\u2019t\nfigure anywhere and in case of necessity she could take him out and that\u2019s it. When Mama came\nback, he told her exact words, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, these are my people. I couldn\u2019t refuse.\u201d I mentioned\nbefore that there was a Jewish committee of o -- el-elders and they were not able to grab\n[indecipherable] chaos. People everywhere, people on the street, no food, nothing. They just\nwere completely lost. And they heard that somebody 1s in the hospital and keeps the hospital\nvery firmly, there\u2019s an order. So they came to talk to my father and they begged him, they\nbegged him please, we are out of means, we don\u2019t know what to do. So he took it.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: I didn\u2019t react, but Mama -- Mama went pale. Mama went pale. So she told him, well, you\nknow, you did what you decided to do, but you realize that that\u2019s it. There\u2019s no way, now that\nyou'll be known to the Germans, that we can take you out and leave the ghetto. There\u2019s no\nquestion about it.",
        "A: No, we were coming in and out.",
        "A: He started right away to organize. People had to be placed somewhere. I mentioned that in a\ntiny room there were eight of his family, and that was very good. People were living 20 next to\neach other. There was no way what to do. He had to find a way how to straighten everything,\nhow to organize food, how to organize cleanliness. Rubbish collection. Can you imagine to\nthrow so many people into one place without anything, no administration? And so he started.",
        "A: Oh, it was boarded up. It was boarded up, there were no borders like in Kaunas, it was -- they\nstarted to board up early in the morning, by the evening everything was boarded up. The\nwindows that faced Vilnius\u2019s streets were boarded too. Every gate, every entrance was wor --\nboarded up. So anyway, he surrounded himself mostly with Jews from Lithuania that he knew.\nBut he asked the elders, please give me a [indecipherable] from Vilnius, from polis -- Polish side\nthat I could work with, because Papa didn\u2019t speak any Polish. Wh-Who in Lithuania spoke\nPolish? Nobody. So they introduced Mr. Dessler. And Dessler\u2019s old family was very known in\nVilnius, very decent family. I cannot -- I cannot tell negative or positive about Mr. Dessler. I can\nonly repeat what people were talking and what my aunt saw.",
        "A: Yeah. I was told by Father, together with Mama, that please do not discuss anything we\u2019re\ntalking about at home where -- when Mr. Dessler is present. And that was enough for us. And\nlater, I don\u2019t know how much there is truth in it or not, people are blaming Mr. Dessler for my\nfather\u2019s untimely death. Nobody knows why they shot him, whether to start the liquidation, they\nfigured with him present would be very difficult to start liquidation. Whether they found out that\nhe\u2019s sending people to the forests. Whether they found out that he knows how to procure guns,\nwe don\u2019t know. We don\u2019t know -- we know from people that he was shot by the chief of the\nGestapo, Neugebauer. We don\u2019t know where are his remains. We were told by people that he\nwas buried in Rasy kapi, the --",
        "A: Cemetery of [indecipherable]. And they put some plates, glass plates into the place of burial. I\nwent to Rasy kapi, talked to the caretakers, they said they\u2019d never heard of anybody being\nbrought by Gestapo into -- so anyway, there is no place. We don\u2019t know anything.",
        "A: No, no. We know that he was shot at the Gestapo building in Vilnius.",
        "A: [indecipherable]. What was the street name? I don\u2019t remember. If you know where the\nstudents -- students live on the -- on the hill.",
        "A: No, no, no, right in the center of Vilnius. [speaks Lithuanian]",
        "A: It\u2019s -- it\u2019s one of the side streets from the main street.",
        "A: Wa -- the same thing, same building.",
        "A: Same building, right, yeah.",
        "A: Befo --",
        "A: But 1 -- co-coming from Cathedral --",
        "A: -- going straight, it would be to the left.",
        "A: Little street, that\u2019s -- that\u2019s it, that was the --",
        "A: -- that\u2019s the building was shot, right. Now, so he warned us to be careful what you talk, what\nwe are talking at home in his presence. How -- what\u2019s the role of Dessler, I cannot blame\nbecause I don\u2019t know. People didn\u2019t talk very nicely of him. Now, when he -- they introduced\nMr. Dessler to Papa [indecipherable], Father tried to find out more military personnel. He found\nPolish Major Vucht. He found Polish Captain Bagle. He found [indecipherable] Lieutenant\nNikadrasin. Anyway, whoever was from military, he took right away to work. And --",
        "A: Police. Order. Now, by the way, Captain Bagle, I knew from Papa hundred percent. Father\nhad a walking stick. He had two pieces. One he handed to Captain Bagle, one he kept himself.\nThe historic pictures from ghetto were in these two walking sticks. When I met Vilik, Captain\nBagle\u2019s son, who was my very close friend in ghetto, I met -- met him in New York, my first\nquestion was Vilik, what happened to your father\u2019s walking stick? He said I -- I don\u2019t know. No\nidea.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah.",
        "A: From the ghetto. Papa had a very good photographer who was instructed to historically, in\npictures, to show the life in ghetto. So Vilik didn\u2019t know anything, and Papa\u2019s thing disappeared.\nPll tell you later what I was able to find. So that\u2019s how he started the administration, and you see,\nKaunas and Vilnius had the completely different histories. Kaunas had barbed wire and Germans\ninside and at the gates. Vilnius had no barbed wire, because everything was boarded up. Vilnius\nhad one Lithuanian policemen. If you\u2019ve seen pictures of the ghetto gate, there is one police --\nlittle booth where the policemen stood and saluted my father. So he tried to avoid the fate of\nKaunas ghetto by having Germans stand at the gate, because Kaunas didn\u2019t have forests. Vilnius\nhad big forests in the vicinity and very many Jewish survivors were hiding in those forests. And\nwhen finally it was little bit quieter in ghetto, and people weren\u2019t taken constantly to be shot,\nthese people started to come back to ghetto to survive, because it seemed that it\u2019s nice and\npeaceful. And people didn\u2019t realize that we used to get ration cards only for official number of\ninhabitants. And the unofficial people had to be fed. And how would you feed unofficial people\nwhen it\u2019s not enough for official people? So Vilnius had a completely different situation. Now,\nthrough my father\u2019s connection with Lietukis --",
        "A: -- for so many years --",
        "A: He, for example would get a shipment of frozen potatoes. The Germans would be told that\npotatoes are frozen.",
        "A: No good for public consumption. The Germans -- and they say, can we throw it to ghetto?\nAnd Germans would say yes, you can throw it to ghetto. That\u2019s how -- but that wasn\u2019t all, you\nhad to feed thousands, it wasn\u2019t in hundreds, it was thousands. So the only thing was to get\nillegally food to ghetto. You must have heard -- and in the -- in -- in writing too, the very, very, I\nwould say rough treatment of people coming back from work at ghetto gates. And you would -- I\nheard myself, standing across the street on the sidewalk, Polish people talking, why do you need\nGermans in here? Look how the Jews are treating the Jews. That was my father\u2019s idea, to make it\nlook so bad that the Germans wouldn\u2019t need to bring either Ukrainians or Lithuanians or\nLatvians to the ghetto gates, because if you would have either one of those people at the gates,\nthese people would die from hunger.",
        "A: He had nothing to do with the gates.",
        "A: He was just standing on the side, he had a little booth, and he was stuck in that booth, that\u2019s\nall.",
        "A: No German soldiers. But, by having Jewish police behave the way they behaved, Father\nescaped having Germans at the gate. Now, nop -- I never --",
        "A: Oh, sure I did.",
        "A: Pl -- Pll tell you. Father had meetings of the leaders of the brigade. And the leaders were\nhanded in a plan. If two go through, the third one will be hit. Three go through, the fourth one\nwill be hit. So that, watching from outside you had a picture that the Jewish police is hitting\nreturning workers because they find something. And you would. The two that go through, no\nfood. The third one, food. The three, no food, the fourth one, food. And every week there was a\nmeeting of brigadiers with instructions how to bring food. The only unfortunate case was when\nMueller caught our singer, Luba Levitska. She had a pound of green peas. Green peas, now\nscientifically, has the same vitamins as meat. Mueller happened to come to the gates and he\ncaught her with a pound of peas. And as much as my father tried to get her from Lukisk\u00e9s, if it\nwould have been a Gestapo case, he would be able to smuggle her out. With a Gebiets\ncommissar, the civilian case, he was not able and she wa -- was finally shot. But anyway, there\nwas a system how to get food. Another thing was --",
        "A: Yeah, go ahead.",

        "A: -- to the left and to the right, and the third one goes through.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: But the picture from outside, the people that know to count one, two or three, looking from\noutside it looks awful. A Jewish policeman hitting a Jewish worker. And you don\u2019t figure two or\nthree goes through, but main thing is, two get hit, third one brings food inside. Because bringing\nthe food and getting caught was punished. Punished by death.",
        "A: Never.",
        "A: That\u2019s right. And the third one or the fourth one, but there was a plan, they -- they -- the head\nof the brigade knew the plan. Now, for example, the older brigades came on the wide\n[indecipherable |",
        "A: -- it was 1n Polish. If there happened that either Gestapo or Murer was at the gate, Mama\nwould go to one direction, I would go to another direction. We had only three words to tell,\nMurer colo brani. Murer at the gates. Everybody would lower their food on the street, because\nthat meant death, you see. So that\u2019s --",
        "A: I-In -- well, not in directly, but --",
        "A: -- warning, warning not to bring food to the gates until it\u2019s clear, you see.",
        "A: Okay. Father had one tiny room.",
        "A: In the ghetto. As the chief of police. Next to that tiny room was a door, regular door, to a\nlarge room, where about 30 people lived. Upstairs was one little room. My uncle, his wife, the\nbaby and Grandmother, in one little room. Now, we had an apartment across the street from\nghetto, I would say maybe 200 yards away, Geliy Gatve",
        "A: That was Flower Street. Now we\u2019re coming to a person I would like to talk about. The whole\narea was in the hand of a Lithuanian Major Narusias. That whole -- whole section, including the\narea where ghetto was. A -- Murer used to come very often to ghetto to check on non-working\npopulation, because there was supposed to be no non-working population.",
        "A: Oh Gebiets commissar [indecipherable]",
        "A: Assistant to Hingst.",
        "A: Assistant to Hingst, yeah Gebiets commissar.",
        "A: And there was an instruction during the day, whoever didn\u2019t work and had no working\nscheins, not to walk the streets. So not make an impression that there are plenty people who are\nnot workers. But it was impossible in a room like that, there were bunkbeds. In a room like that\nwould be at least 30 people. You had to put them somewhere. Now, Narusias was Papa\u2019s friend.\nSo he went to him and said, look, Stefan, there are buildings outside the ghetto where nobody\nlives. Nobody wants to live to -- th -- next to Jewish ghetto. Why don\u2019t you talk to the Germans,\nexplain to them that these buildings are getting ruined. No heat, water seeps in. Tell the Germans\nthat you would like to attach those buildings to the ghetto area. That proposition costed my father\na lot in gold, in diamonds. But Narusias went to the Germans and he attached a big area to the\nghetto, so that first of all you wouldn\u2019t have 30 people in a room. You had already place to\nbreathe, and you wouldn't see so many people on the street.",
        "A: I-If you come -- if you come through the gates, the left side. From the gates to the left, that\nwas the area.",
        "A: Oh, Mykoloyos Natan, no.",
        "A: Well, it -- it was bordering Pino Gatve.",
        "A: But f-further outside the ghetto wall.",
        "A: Yeah, I -- I can\u2019t know the -- remember all those names. But anyway, that helped\ntremendously, and that was possible to do only through connections and through old friendships.",
        "A: Oh, sure, what you say. Nobody would do it unless it -- but at least it gave results.",
        "A: It gave tremendous results. Now, he still had a problem with food, how to feed the people. So\nhe discussed with Germans the possibility to found more and more workshops. And they agreed\nthat they could have in ghetto a workshop for furniture. They had their own telephone, they were\nnot allowed to use city telephone, and they had all kinds of workshops, and they --",
        "A: Well they probably --",
        "A: -- probably, yeah. Probably had. And the Germans agreed to Father\u2019s idea to take the boards\nfrom one of the door from previous stores, open the store with samples what the Jews can do in\nghetto and what people can come and order to be done. That was another outlet to get foods\nlegally.",
        "A: Legally, right, I mean --",
        "A: -- they the -- you know, to get food.",
        "A: To order, yes, but those people who came, at the same time it had people who had nothing to\ndo with coming for order, they just smuggled food to ghetto. But th -- until one day they caught a\nbig shipment coming at night through the gates. And they requested Father to give the guilty\nparties for arrest. And there were two people in charge of that, Mr. Trapeida and Mr.\nBiniakonski. When Papa called them in, they said commandant, you\u2019re not going to be in charge\nof that. We\u2019re taking the responsibility and we\u2019re going to LukiSkes. You don\u2019t know anything\nabout the transport, you have nothing to do with it, so that in front of Germans your hands are\nclean. So they took Mr. Trapeida and Mr. Biniakonski to Lukisk\u00e9s jail.",

        "A: The Germans requested to give the culprits. Who is in charge -- who 1s in charge of getting\nthat food into ghetto through the gates. So --\nBeginning Tape Seven",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: And they told my father that -- they -- they called my father commandant. [indecipherable]\nCommandant, you\u2019re not going to take responsibility, we\u2019re taking the responsibility. They were\nin charge of the food supplies. They said, whatever happens, we go, you stay. They -- Father had\nto bring them, and they were brought to Lukisk\u00e9s. Thank God Father was able to buy them out.\nThey -- all wer -- they suffered was frozen toes. Lukiskes had no heat and the winters in Vilnius\nare very, very --",
        "A: -- cold. So they finally got them out. And usually -- 1t was always -- not always, but in many\ncases, possible to buy out from Gestapo arrest, but not from the Gebiets commissariat. Whenever\nthe civil SS -- SA, brown uniforms were involved, like Murer, you couldn\u2019t do anything.",
        "A: Gestapo you br -- corruptible.",
        "A: Corruptible, yeah. Now, in the Gebiets commissariat building, you know, there is a proverb\nthat say that world is not without good people. One day Father met a man, he looked familiar.\nAnd then he said, Colonel Keenas. He said yes, but now I am Colonel Kune. Father\u2019s friend from\narmy.",
        "A: When the Soviet came, there was repatriation to Germany, whoever could save himself\nfinding an old aunt, and old grandmother from German descent, he went to Germany. And that\nColonel Kune is actually to be thanked for my life and for my mother\u2019s life. Every first of the\nmonth he was issuing my father two permissions, for Mama and for me separately, to use\nLithuanian railway system. You couldn\u2019t go and buy a ticket to buy -- go on the train. Every\nmonth on the [indecipherable] my father would bring us this permission to use the railways. See,\nthat\u2019s all network of Lithuanian officers.",

        "A: Yeah. And then he said to my father, oh I saw you on the street. Who are these people? And\nmy father said oh, two very old acquaintances. Nobody knew. Until Father was shot, nobody\nopened their mouth.",
        "A: Yes. How otherwise I would know everybody? People in the ghetto did, but they would not\nsqueal. That\u2019s why they say that their -- they suspect Dessler, that Dessler squealed after my\nfather was shot. I don\u2019t know. I cannot blame because I don\u2019t know. Now I -- I had a friend in\nGestapo, a Lithuanian in Gestapo uniform, who was a real friend from my childhood, from high\nschool, in sporting events. He never squealed. So what -- the way the Gestapo came after us, it\nhad to be very, very clear information, where we are, where we live, but that stopped in there. I\nmentioned to you that we were about 200 yards from ghetto, across the street. And they came\ninto the apartment, they ripped everything apart. They ripped the floorboards. Whats they were\nlooking for, I don\u2019t know. They were looking for guns, for -- for some kind of written material,\nwhatever.",
        "A: After.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: We were given 10 minutes to disappear. Father\u2019s helper came one day and said, Mrs. Gens,\nplease take Ada and disappear immediately. Nothing taken, just walk out of the apartment the\nway you stand, not to throw any suspicion or anything. Mama --",
        "A: That was the day he was shot.",
        "A: Oh, that was in September.",
        "A: Yeah. And he said, just disappear. But he didn\u2019t tell that Father was executed. Ghetto knew it,\nwe didn\u2019t know it. We didn't know it for a long time. And my mother\u2019s sister know -- knew it,\nbut she wouldn\u2019t tell.",
        "A: Just walking out into the street. Next day the Gestapo came into the apartment. And how do I\nknow how it looked? Right across the landing was another apartment with a Polish refugee from\nWarsaw who was hiding her son inside the apartment. And our back door, from the back\nentrance, were again, one across the other. So she was watching what the Gestapo was doing and\nwhen my aunt came in, my aunt came in through her apartment, opened the back door, and came\nin with her. They Gestapo kept the person hidden behind the front door for three days thinking\nthat maybe we\u2019ll come in or whatever.

She said, oh, as long as my -- my father is there,\nnothing will happen to my daughter. Let\u2019s wait. And then when one day they put Ukrainians\naround, you couldn\u2019t get anything out. So then my aunt went to Siauliai, where it was exactly the\nsame story. The mother wouldn\u2019t give her child before, and when my aunt arrived from Vilnius\nto Siauliai the ghetto was surrounded.

        "A: So I mean, the Jewish people, everybody knew. That\u2019s what I said, until Father was alive,\nnobody squealed. We don\u2019t know who squealed after he was killed. We don\u2019t know. And I can\u2019t\nput a finger or anyone, because you don\u2019t know.",
        "A: No job, no job.",
        "A: We had a group of people that we knew each other very well from Lithuanian, Kaunas area,\nand there were a group of younger -- you know, we were young people. Can you imagine at that\nage, we just finished high school, all of us, and it -- it\u2019s awful. You\u2019re -- you\u2019re -- it\u2019s depressing.\nThere is no way to express -- I -- I don\u2019t know what -- what to say what would I do. I would visit\neverybody. We would stay in groups. There was a lot of things to do in ghetto, there was a c --\nthere were activities that I attended. Papa took me through the pur -- orphanages, through the\nkitchens, you -- you know, with him, to show me how things are going. And then I just would\nsay -- Stay with grandmother, with Papa\u2019s family. That\u2019s -- you wouldn\u2019t do very much. I had\none very, very bad experience when Murer came into the ghetto and Papa managed to sh-shove\nme out from the door into the next apartment, and Murer was checking apartments. I had nothing\non me, no schein, no yellow --",

There were oh, at least 30 women\nin that room and pa -- can you imagine if Murer would come in and yi -- Papa would have to\nexplain to them why are these 30 ladies in the room, not working. That was a very, very narrow\nescape. But it -- 1t worked out. And then, you know, I participated a lot. I used to -- you must\nknow that ghetto had a very strong cultural life. I used to bring information about the place they\nwere playing. For example, at the same time ghetto had in Vilnius theater, there was a play called\nZmogus Potilto.",
        "A: A person under the bridge. So I used to bring them sketches and tell how they do that, so that\nthe -- the Jewish production was not worse than the production in Vilnius. And I took musical\nlessons. I continued, I couldn\u2019t go to conservatory because I was warned at the philharmon --\nphilharmonia -- not to show myself. So I took music lessons, I stayed and played, not normal as\nif it\u2019s a normal life. It was the normal, but as much as possible.",
        "A: Yes, somebody did, yeah, somebody did.",
        "A: No. No. I -- I went, I saw, I was -- Papa took me to show, but I didn\u2019t participate in any\nadministrative work.",

        "A: I don\u2019t know, but at 15, what -- I mean, he had the -- the very well trained personnel to do all\nthat. For example, there was no hunger. The children, the orphans were very well kept. They had\nquarters where they lived. Jusef Mushkat was one of Father\u2019s helpers, police member. He was in\ncharge of orphans so that there were no people on the street, sitting or begging or anything like\nthat. And whoever survived the ghetto is a testimony that Vilnius was very well run as far as the\nfeeding, the hospital. They had babies. Under German law you couldn\u2019t have babies. Papa had a\nsection where babies were born, so that ev-everything was done, whatever it was possible to do.",

Those selections were going all the time. And they are painful selections, because why -\n- why Joe and not Peter? Why Peter and not Joe? It\u2019s impossible. But one thing which Vilnius I\nthink is famous for, no corruption. You couldn\u2019t buy a life certificate for money. You hear that in\nother towns. You hear that in Warsaw. I\u2019ve heard that in Lodz, reading the books, you cannot\nfind one single case of life certificates sold for money.",

And that\u2019s what it was assumed will happen. When Papa\ndidn\u2019t go there, when the police went over there, the Germans told them that these people are not\ngoing to Vilnius and that they will be finished. In those writings -- I read them -- what I believed\nwhat happened, this was the mostly gold pieces, money. The Jewish nation went through so\nmany upheavals and pogroms in Tsaristic Russia, they didn\u2019t keep paper money, they ca -- kept\nmostly golden pieces, golden rubles. And I think those who came back pretty rich, they were told\nby the Germans to collect the bodies, and I think that\u2019s when they got into that. That wasn\u2019t a\nstory with life certificates, that was a story when people were -- made-believe that they\u2019re going\nto Vilnius ghetto and at the last moment they were told that\u2019s what\u2019s going to be then, you not --",
        "A: No, they were -- Oshmena [indecipherable] they did, yeah.",
        "A: Oh, he didn't know. He didn't know. See, they do -- they did exactly the same thing with\nKaunas. Father checked very carefully through Lietukis [indecipherable]. They were going to\nbring a transport to Kaunas. Father checked on the offices of suppliers of food whether it\u2019s really\ngoing to happen, and he was assured by the Lithuanian officials, yes, we had an order for bread,\nwe had an order for potatoes, we had an order for this, for that. This is for that additional\ntransport to Kaunas. And when they were in the Vilnius railway station, Father overheard an old\nPolish railway worker that we\u2019re changing the --",
        "A: -- rail -- railway lines. So he said, what do you mean you\u2019re changing the railway lines? He\nsaid well, we\u2019re not going to Kaunas, we\u2019re going to [indecipherable] to Paneriai. So at that\nmoment, Father said he understood what\u2019s going on.",

        "A: [speaks Russian]. The thing is that Father tried to get from Germans permission to employ\npeople inside. And he told the Germans that he needs some kind of paper to give those people.\nNot the yellow scheins to work outside, but something so that people would have something in\ntheir hands to give them more hope. And the Germans agreed, so they printed the pink scheins.\nAnd they were --",
        "A: Certificates, right. So he tried whatever was possible to keep their spirit alive. At -- it\u2019s not so\neasy. Now, the question of theater, for example. From the beginning it was very, very negative.\nHow can you have theater and concerts in a place which 1s actually a cemetery?",
        "A: Where so many of our people have died, or are being taken to die? But after awhile, I think\nthe human nature wants to look more -- towards more positive and more opportunistically. You\ncouldn\u2019t get a seat in the hall.",
        "A: Absolutely, everyone, absolutely everyone. So --",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. The very first -- the very first one was in a room about the size I would say\nlike this, towards that broom, that size. It one -- one of the rooms were the administrative\nbuilding. My mother was so against it, you have no idea, but she couldn\u2019t talk him out of. They\nsaid, look Elenka, we need something to give the people. Let\u2019s try it. And in that room they had\nlike little pieces. One would sing, [indecipherable] Rosenthal, she sang, and the Fima Shapiro,\nMarek Shapiro. Adriana -- little sketch, little pieces. And 1t was tremendous success. But the\nopinion in ghetto was awful, look at that. There were not many, I would say no more than 30\npeople attending, and it was just for the administrative apparatus. And after that he discussed it\nwith other people who were in that line of work before the war and they decided to start. And it\nstarted, and the success was tremendous, just tremendous.",
        "A: My mother\u2019s objections? Her objections was exactly the same way. You don\u2019t open a theater\nin a cemetery. She\u2019s -- she\u2019s -- she\u2019s -- figured that it would be too painful for people who lost\nfamily members, which -- which I completely agree. But in retrospect when I look back, I see\nthat that gave people a lot of positive thinking towards the future. You go to a symphony\norchestra, you know, you relax, whichever country you are. Especially in ghetto conditions. Was\na very good symphony orchestra until Luba Levitska was int -- killed. She was a very good\nsinger, and the drama actors were very good. So that it -- it worked out, it worked out to the\nbenefit of people.\nBeginning Tape Eight",
        "A: That\u2019s so.",
        "A: At four o\u2019clock in the afternoon.",
        "A: When the things were quiet, every single day. That\u2019s where Panana Simait\u00e9 would come in at\nthe same time to get her ration of food --",
        "A: -- for the people upstairs, and well, influence. First of all, influence -- first of all, he didn\u2019t\nlisten to her when she begged him not to get involved. That\u2019s the influence ended. Oh well, what\ncan you do it? Otherwise, they always conferred, they always discussed. Whatever was going on,\nthey always discussed. Mama was a very intelligent and clever person, and she -- she felt his\npain, and she felt his inability to do more than he can do. And for a wife to watch her husband\nbeing torn to all sides, it\u2019s very difficult. On one of those awful nights of Oshmena, Mama woke\nup in the morning, her hands were covered with a -- like a scale, from nervous tension. Both\nhands were covered. And she was a very sensitive person, nervous tension. And she could\npredict, in a way, things. And my father was aware of her knowing what 1s going to happen. In\n1939, I believe, there was a reunion of Lithuanian officers in Vilnius. And my father knew that\nMama wanted to see a Talmudist in Vilnius, because in Kaunas everybody was speaking, there 1s\na famous Talmudist in Vilnius. And he told her look, I\u2019m going to the conference, don\u2019t you dare\nto go and see that Talmudist. Don\u2019t you dare. Cause Father was not one of those people that, you\nknow, believes in this or that. When he returned from the conference, he had one look at my\nmother and he said, you didn\u2019t listen to me. You went to see the Talmudist. Now, I don\u2019t know\nhow to explain it, but the Talmudist told my mother everything that happened. They didn\u2019t say\nthe word Germans, but he described the awful things that are going to happen and he told her\nthat in a couple of years after that, she\u2019ll lose her husband. Talmudist had no idea who she 1s,\nwho my father is, that her husband is Jewish. Absolutely no idea. He read Talmud. So when\nFather returned home from the conference, looked at my mother, he knew right away. And\nMother lived with that heavy burden on her chest all these years, from 39 to 43.",
        "A: She did, my father laughed. But he told her, I warned you, please don\u2019t go. Cause he knew my\nmother was a very sensitive person. I told you about the scales overnight. He told her not to go\nbecause to him that was a laughable object. To her, that didn\u2019t disappear. And she lived all these\nyears waiting and expecting something terrible to happen. And Talmudist didn\u2019t know how to\nput it.",
        "A: 739, yes. But he said, things are going to be awful beyond description, and you lose your\nhusband couple years after that. So you know when you live it was a feeling like this. My mother\nhated the Germans to the point that when we were forced to live in Munich in one apartment, she\nnever talked to the Germans.",
        "A: After the war. Well, I wanted to go through German consulates to look, maybe I could find\nout something about Weiss, about Murer, about Neugebauer, people that they thought -- she\ndidn\u2019t even want to hear anything about them. Her hatred is not a human hatred. I-It\u2019s difficult to\ndescribe. And when my mother fi -- found out about my father\u2019s death, was already probably 40\n-- end of \u201944. She went to Kaunas from where we were staying, and the landlady of my aunt\u2019s\nhouse didn\u2019t know that Mother doesn\u2019t know. We lived in the hope that maybe he ran away, or\nmaybe -- whatever, but not dead. And she started to, oh, poor Mrs. Gens, oh my sympathy, oh, I\nam so sorry. Mama couldn\u2019t understand what she is talking about. And when Mama finally\ngrasped, she nearly went mad. It was awful. The lady was telling me later, said she hasn\u2019t seen a\nsight like that in her life. Because it was shock plus she finally realized what happened. She\ndidn\u2019t take too much activity in ghetto. First of all, Mama -- I wasn\u2019t afraid, Mama was afraid of\nthe Germans, that can get caught in there. And she would spend time with Grandmother, with\nUncle, and we had very many friends in ghetto, so she would visit. But she didn\u2019t take part in\nany administrative or anything because, as I say, nobody from German part knew that we exist.\nBut she would attend, like I show you the picture, I showed the picture. But even in the picture,\nshe bent down so you wouldn\u2019t see her face. She didn\u2019t want any documentation that there is a\nwife to the commandant.",

She was dressed in a white fur coat.\nTiny girl, two years old. And she put the girl on the ground and she tried to go to the other side.\nSo I talked to survivors and they said that the German officer picked the child, was going around\nto say where is the mother of the child, where is the mother of the child? And th-that Sonia\ncouldn\u2019t stand it, she -- she just broke down. She came to the German officer, took her child and\nwent to the --",

And what was interesting, when he was deported to Kloge, the\ntrain went via Siauliai and he was able to write a little note, throw it through the window.\nSomebody picked it up and ran to the ghetto in Siauliai. And the brother in Siauliai came to the\ntrain, he was the head of ghetto in Siauliai. He brought Solomon some clothes, some food, and\nthat was the last the two brothers met.

        "A: Yeah, mm-hm.",
        "A: No, no, I was in hiding. We were both in hiding. But that\u2019s also already 1944, I believe. So\nthat that was already so far away. Mama went to Kaunas.",
        "A: And that\u2019s when she found out, and then she returned back.",
        "A: And she\u2019s the one who told me, yeah. But when she returned back, you know what she did?\nShe sat in one corner, looked into the other corner opposite and wouldn\u2019t move. She wouldn\u2019t\nmove. Nothing mattered to her, nothing.",
        "A: I think at my age you don\u2019t react like my Mama reacted. I-I believe that I kind of suspected it.\nYou see, what happened, only the day when they told us to leave the apartment and we went to\nPanana Simait\u00e9\u2019s place, Simait\u00e9 came back and she said, listen, the rumor in Vilnius has it that\nsomebody ran away from Gestapo building and there are guards around the area. So that kept me",
        "A: -- hoping that if whoever escaped the Gestapo building, it would be my father. That\u2019s -- but\nthat took too long, when by \u201944 we haven\u2019t heard, because if he would have been alive there\nwould be a way to -- to let us know or something, so I started to lose my hope. But Mama clung\nto it, that Papa managed to get s -- ge -- escape Gestapo and he is 1n hiding somewhere. He just\ncannot get in touch with us. See, that is -- that was her attitude.",
        "A: She didn't bring, she didn\u2019t bring. We went to Simait\u00e9. Panana Simait\u00e9 lived in the apartment\nwhich was used to -- as a lodging for people who worked for the university.",
        "A: Dor -- like a dormitory, yes. And in same apartment was a lady whose husband was a very\nhigh Soviet official in -- during the Soviet year. And the Germans had a place for all wives and\nchildren of Soviet officers who didn\u2019t manage to take their wives away. They didn\u2019t do anything\nbad to them, but they were segregated from others. It was a house close to Hakapay.",
        "A: And she was taken by director of Vilnius University and placed in an apartment with Simait\u00e9,\nillegally. So when we saw her there, Mama said, you know what Panana Simait\u00e9? I don\u2019t feel\nvery safe in here because of her. Because if Germans come after her --",
        "A: -- they\u2019ll discovered us. So Simait\u00e9 walked with us to a wife, Polish wife of another police\nofficer, Mr. Alprin. And we stayed a couple of days with Mrs. Alprin.",

        "A: She was pol -- Polish Gentile. And after a couple of days, we figured, well th-this is the place\nt-to hide, because we didn\u2019t know to what extent the Germans are going to look for us. So we\nhad the permissions for the train. We boarded the train and we had very close friends of my\nparents, that\u2019s the people whose children were on the echelon to Siberia, and we thought we\u2019ll go\nover there. That\u2019s far away from Vilnius, far away from Kaunas. On the train, when the\ngendarmerie came to check the documents, my mother\u2019s face went white. She didn\u2019t know is it\nbecause they have to check everybody, or just us. And her face gave her away. The Germans\nprobably didn\u2019t notice, but the people --",
        "A: -- sitting next to us noticed. So the man who was sitting next to me turned around to my\nmother and he said very quietly that, Madam, I see that you have some very big problem and\nmay I offer our house in Siauliai until you decide what you are doing? They --",
        "A: Strangers. They didn\u2019t know who am I, who Mama is, or anybody. There was a curfew. The\ntrain pulled out late, ta -- five or six o\u2019clock in the morning, you couldn\u2019t walk. So we spent the\ncouple of hours until the dawn, and the cra -- curfew was away, and he mentioned his name and\nhe said that we have a huge estate, past Siauliai. I\u2019ll take you to the estate and then you\u2019ll decide\nwhat you want to do next. No questions.",

        "A: Village elder. The village elder was his cousin, and he needed a place to hide not to be\ninducted into German working force. So he came to his cousin. His cousin sent me to the place\nwhere we were in hiding, and that was the first face I saw. And Mama wasn\u2019t very happy about\nit, but I said, Mama, you don\u2019t expect anything bad from the family Shlupas. It\u2019s too high in our\nsociety to do anything bad.",
        "A: Sh-She would have preferred, but I don\u2019t think he knew anything about me besides my name,\nlast name and so on.

I knew, for example, in 1942, Father talked to the\nGermans and explained to them that ghetto has no way to heat the buildings and he asked for\npermission to send Jewish workers in faraway woods to cut the timber and bring it in ghetto, and\nfinally je -- Germans agreed. That was a place where the movement started. A carriage would go\nwith double floor, with people under the double floor, to unload themselves, load the timber and\nthat goes one back and forth.

        "A: You wouldn\u2019t -- you wouldn\u2019t mention the names. I knew the fact because I was spend my\ntime over there, I went with him over there. I knew -- I knew the extent what\u2019s going on.",
        "A: He was -- well, you -- you\u2019ve seen the literature. They have all kinds of -- all kinds of\nopinions. They -- on one side they say that you are supporting, that he was procuring the guns.\nOn the other side they s -- would say that he didn\u2019t want them to leave ghetto, to leave the\nchildren and old people alone, because if you -- let\u2019s say you saved hundred people in wood, you\nleft the others for their own what? They can\u2019t do anything. Children, old ladies, women. He was\nagainst young people completely leaving the old ones in ghetto without any defense. He thought\nthat there should be -- there should be something left.",
        "A: Well, that\u2019s --",
        "A: Ye -- he chose the young to live, but you see, circumstances change, and when you see old\nmothers and mothers and grandmothers and little children and everybody tries to get into the\nforests and leave them behind, I-I don\u2019t think you can stick any more to -- to your ideas that you\nhad before. He was telling them nicely that listen, I am warned by the Germans that if they find\nout who brings the guns, who goes away, the repercussions will be very bad, and they threatened\nthe children. Th -- Papa did everything in his force not to sacrifice the children, and the children\nwere not touched until Papa was alive. He asked them to be careful, and he tried to explain to\nthem that by removing a dozen today, dozen today, dozen tomorrow, we cannot save the ghetto.\nHe wanted to prolong -- you see, the front was moving slowly. It wasn\u2019t as rosy for the Germans\nas it used to be in \u00b041. In \u201943 the situation in the front was already different. He was hoping\nagainst hope that maybe somehow, if he drags the people longer, like in Kloge where my uncle\ndied, the Russians were right there. They came in, the timber was still burning, you see? So he --\nhe just thought that maybe, maybe, if we don\u2019t provoke the Germans, if they leave us alone and\nlet us live the way we are, work, work, work, work, nevermind work, but work, maybe we\u2019 ll\nexpect -- you know, maybe our expectations will take place. Maybe it\u2019ll happen. Maybe the\nRussian army will come closer.",
        "A: No, never. He knew it very well. He knew that the German could -- a German soldier came\ninto the ghetto area and he wanted to rip a -- Father had a -- a Lithuanian officer\u2019s c -- student --\nstudent -- like we have here, those [indecipherable]",
        "A: Insignia, yeah. And Father didn\u2019t want to give it to him. He pulled out the gun. So, there was\nno way, you know, he had to give it to him. And an officer could have shot him any time, any\nGerman could have shot him any time. We -- we -- we counted on it, we knew it. So, I mean,\nthere was no sense to discuss at all. What sense did it make? We knew the way he -- he lived.",
        "A: That\u2019s correct.",
        "A: That\u2019s right.",
        "A: I would say the same rule. I wou -- I -- I was always there, so whatever I heard, she heard.\nThere was no secrets without me being present. You know, all -- all the effort that he put into\nthat period of life was to prolong, somehow, the survival. Whatever he did was for that one and\nonly purpose. We have no idea, as I told you before, we have no idea what the Germans di-\ndiscovered, or simply they decided that he is the head, he should be removed, it\u2019Il be easier to\nannihilate the others.",
        "A: For example, he built malinas. You know what malina is?",
        "A: Secret places. In charge of malinas were two people, engineer Marcos and Mr. Dellwell. Mr.\nDellwell was from Kaunas. He knew him very well because his daughter was with me in school,\nand engineer Marcos was from Poland. It was in engineer Marcos\u2019 hands to build the malinas. It\nwas in Mr. Dellwell\u2019s hands to supply water and food. This we knew. Mama knew and I knew\nthat they are in charge. I didn\u2019t know where the malina was, but I knew that Father had a plan,\nhad quite a big plan for malinas. And I believe what people told me, that my uncle\u2019s wife and\ngrandmother and the child were in the malina. But the Germans forced people to open the\nmalinas. So some were saved and some were pulled out. But his idea was to do as much as\npossible, to save as much as possible. So it\u2019s -- it\u2019s not like you sometimes read, cooperation,\nwhat kind of cooperation? He would go into [indecipherable] with the Germans. If they would\nsay they want 5,000, he would offer a thousand and the Germans would come down to 3,000, he\nwould s-say 1,500. But he was able, he managed to have that -- I think billing -- being such a\nmilitary nation, the Germans had certain -- I wouldn\u2019t call it respect, but they had a certain\nattitude towards a military posture of my father. He looked a military man whichever way you\nlooked at him, from the left, or to the right. He looked a military man. And when the mail used to\ncome from Gebiets commissariat, mail, they would never write to Jewish, they would write Herr\nJacob Gens. It was unusual to have such a polite form. I think that had a lot to do. And we were\ntold that when Papa went into Gestapo and the army found out, well I don\u2019t know whether that\u2019s\ntrue or not, the army offered Gestapo two --\nEnd of Tape Eight\nBeginning Tape Nine",
        "A: Might --",
        "A: There was a rumor that the German army offered Gestapo a tremendous amount of money to\nlet my father go. Not because of sentimental reasons, but he was a organizer of entire product --\nproductive, you know, force for the German army, and army needed it. But unfortunately the --\nHitler\u2019s line was stronger and they --",
        "A: That was not the Gestapo, that came straight from Himmler.",
        "A: That came from the up, up, up.",
        "A: The Jewish solution, yeah. It\u2019s time to finish with the Jews --",
        "A: -- in Vilnius. Time to finish with the Jews. So they didn\u2019t care that army needed them. They\ndidn\u2019t want any more Jews. The only place that they left for time being was the Hakapay at\nKilus. Kilus was producing a fur uniforms for the German lady -- female personnel, and also for\nGerman officers, and later on for German army, what -- as much as they could. And Hakapay\nwas involved in structural work, so --",
        "A: I don\u2019t know the German word -- n-name of Hakapay, I can find it. It\u2019s what\u2019s called H --\nHakapay, HKP.",
        "A: I -- PIl find out what 1-it meant.",
        "A: The Jewish -- they were out of ghetto. They were living separately, out of ghetto, in the\nvicinity where the Russian wives and children of Russian officers were there -- where they were\nthere. And they had the -- they didn\u2019t belong together, they always were separate, and I don\u2019t\nremember which one went first, because I wasn\u2019t there, whether Kilus went first or Hakapay\nwent first, they were not able to -- to save them. So --",
        "A: Yes, I knew, that I knew.",
        "A: That I knew.",
        "A: Father warned his people to be very careful with Polish people around. He never trusted the\nPolish people, I\u2019m sorry to say that. One reason was, he didn't know them. Another reason was\nthat he saw too many Jewish people disappear in LukiSk\u00e9s, because the Polish people will give\nthem out. So he said, be very careful. Don\u2019t ever trust a Polish person. I don\u2019t remember the\ndetails now, but somehow Germans, I believe, caught a Polish person and under torture he gave\nname. And the Germans requested to be handed in [indecipherable] yeah.",
        "A: Yes, Wittenberg. It was an awful case because Papa tried to assure the Germans that there is\nno illegal activity in ghetto. Because they were threatening all the time, if we catch illegal\nactivity, that will be the end of the ghetto. Now we all knew that Gestapo had means to torture\nand the -- the Polish man didn\u2019t -- was not able to stand it, Wittenberg wouldn\u2019t be able to stand\nit either. Now if they got Wittenberg and he would start talking, that was very bad for the ghetto.\nI can\u2019t remember who gave him ciancarli.",
        "A: The very strong poison like Goering took? Goering\u2019s wife.",
        "A: Cyanide, yeah. Can\u2019t remember now. Even when I read those books years, years ago, I -- I\ndon\u2019t reread them all the time. I can\u2019t remember, but anyway, he was given ciancarlt.",
        "A: Probably. A -- you know Wittenberg, Wittenberg. He -- he -- nobody knew anything, so Mr.\nWittenberg, that\u2019s it. So he wasn\u2019t given a life.",
        "A: Corpse.",
        "A: Oh that -- that was -- everybody knew that.",
        "A: That was at the time, yeah.",
        "A: But Papa couldn\u2019t afford to have Wittenberg tortured, because then the whole thing would\nslowly come out. The forests, they\u2019re going to the forests with a double bottom to, you know,\ncarriage --",
        "A: About Wittenberg\u2019s torture --",
        "A: Yes. It was very, very difficult story for him. But what do you do? You can\u2019t risk -- that\u2019s\nwhat he was trying to tell those people, I cannot risk the entire ghetto because 20 or 30 of you\nwould run to the woods and leave me with a whole -- thousands on my hands, so that you are\ngoing to be free. You see, the situation changed. Situation changed and he saw that there is no\nway -- if Warsaw ghetto, with such tremendous, organized uprising didn\u2019t survive, he knew that\nVilnius can\u2019t -- Vilnius doesn\u2019t have so many ammunition or anything. You -- you can\u2019t -- you\ncan\u2019t survive.",
        "A: That\u2019s all right? They wanted to resist, and what about the others? What about this -- the\naftereffect? Okay, they would resist, let\u2019s say they would fight for a week. There\u2019s no question\nthat the Germans would send their army and that would be squashed out. But what about the\nremaining ones? What about the remaining ones? Straight to the ovens?",
        "A: He was caught, yeah. What would you do? How -- how would you -- how would you reason\nwith people? He knew that the young ones wants to save -- they want to save themselves, but\nwhat do you do with mothers and grandmothers and so on? Father was counting that maybe one\nday the army, Russian army will come closer, and the Germans will run away.",
        "A: I would say not because it\u2019s my father, but I would say that he was extraordinary. He was.\nAbsolutely no fear. Absolutely no fear.",
        "A: Yeah. That\u2019s why c-certain things you wouldn\u2019t tell. You -- I would know the facts, but I\nwouldn't know the names. Because, you see, in Kaunas the Nuremberg law was applied right\naway. Somehow in Vilnius, between Polish, Lithuanian and Jews and this and that, it didn\u2019t\ncome on the poles. So --",
        "A: No, pasted 1-1n Vilnius. In Kaunas, yes. And Kaunas had quite a few suicides, when one side\nwouldn\u2019t give the other one away and both would commit suicide. Nothing like that in Vilnius.\nSo -- you know, but you never knew when it will start. That\u2019s why he was always very much\nafraid.",
        "A: What legacy?",
        "A: You know, he tried to help people. I\u2019ve been helping people since 1947. He never got\nanything for his help. I never ask anything for my help, and I -- I help a lot. I think this is\nsomething that goes through the genes. You are the way you are because of something. You\u2019re\nnot the way you are that suddenly [indecipherable] oh, it\u2019s good to make good, and this and that.\nYou are the way you are. And I believe a lot of that behavior had tremendous influence on my\ngrowing up -- In my growing up years. He used to say -- he had a saying in Lithuanian that\n[speaks Lithuanian here]. In English it would be, the dear Lord is getting old, and doesn\u2019t see\nwhat\u2019s happening on the earth. But he never complained, he never blamed, he just took it in\nstride, whatever the life was throwing at him. And he had a very easy way not to do it. The\nLithuanian officers had the place for him. It was a estate of Pulkanika Skorupskas. Just go and\nstay there. Nobody would know, that\u2019s why Mama was begging him, don\u2019t get any official place.\nWe have a place for you, we\u2019ll wait until the end of the war, and that\u2019s it. But you see, certain --\ncertain forces in your conscience overpower you, and even if he wasn't Jewish up til that time, he\nfelt for his nation, and he -- he wouldn\u2019t budge.",
        "A: You want to know my answer? I couldn\u2019t care less. That\u2019s my answer, I couldn\u2019t care less. I\nwould like to have them just sit in his skin and do what he did. Telling you\u2019re going to die,\ntelling you\u2019re going to live. That\u2019s easy on a person? They show in those plays, they show a\nscene, they describe a scene. Father standing at the gate, and the German is letting father, mother\nin to children. And he sees a family coming with three children and he sees a family coming with\none child. And he grabs a kid from the three, throws them into the family with one, hits the father\non the shoulder with his stick and yells at him, what do you do? You left your child behind. Well\nthat story is all over the plays, the books and so on. His mind had to work in all directions. If he\nwouldn\u2019t have noticed that one has one child and the other has three children, the one would go\nthrough and they would take another third child from the next. He had to see everything. It\u2019s not\nso simple. And it\u2019s not so simple to -- to have conversations with the Germans when you have\nhuman blood to count. As I told you, they want 5,000, you offer a thousand. They go down to\nfour, you go up to one -- 1500. These are people, these aren\u2019t just marionettes, and you have to\ndeal with it. So I would like those people who have harsh words to try to be in his skin and see\nhow they would like to do it. That\u2019s why I say I couldn\u2019t care less at all, cause ve seen my\nfather\u2019s reaction and I\u2019ve seen his tremendous effort to do whatever is possible. And he -- in the\ncertain way the effort worked out, quite a bit survived. Not necessarily -- not necessarily in\nVilnius but they survived in Dachau, they survived in Auschwitz. Some survived. So, you know,\nit\u2019s difficult -- difficult to make a judgment. And now what can people -- they judge harsh --\nharsh behavior at the gate. I explained to you the gate. Kaunas had completely different situation.\nVilnius had completely different situation. Kaunas didn\u2019t have to feed the people, we had to feed\nthe people. So, you do something to do it. He had Polish people around, which he didn\u2019t trust.\nKaunas didn\u2019t have it, Kaunas had Lithuanian people. So he had here the Germans on one side\nand he had untrustworthy Poles on the other side. So h-he\u2019s -- find the gold medium. You were\nafraid of the Polish population, which was not friendly at all, not friendly at all. He had an\nagreement with Gestapo. The Jewish person had a Polish family, friends. The Jewish person\nwould leave his gold for the Polish family to save for him. And then one day they would agree\nthat the Jewish person somehow will come in the dark to get some of the gold. And the Polish\nperson would call the Gestapo, and the Jewish person would come in, and pick up the Jew, here\nwe go to Lukiske\u00e9s. And that happened time and again, time and again. So Father made the plan.\nHe offered Gestapo 50 - 50. I'll tell you where the gold is, you take 50, I take 50 percent. No Jew\ngoes to LukiSke\u00e9s, no Jew is shot in Paneriai. You have your share, I have my share for the ghetto.\nYou had to buy food. Food was at exorbitant prices, you needed money. So you figured, what\nI\u2019m losing? One way or the other, the Pole will call Gestapo to get the Jew, the gold will go\nhundred percent to Gestapo. This way at least P\u2019ll have 50 percent for Jewish ghetto. And the\ntreasury in ghetto will not be bare, will have something. Well these people -- these people don\u2019t\nknow it, see? He had to -- it was a Machiavelli scheme, but it worked. Everybody was happy.\nGestapo was happy, and Jewish treasury was happy.",
        "A: The -- th-the -- that was not my father\u2019s concern, you see? If the -- if the Polish people kept\nthe same attitude, greedy people, people who were friends before, just because it was financial\nbenefit involved, he didn\u2019t care about it. So you see, things like this, they are not in the books.\nPeople who wrote all those articles were happy to have food. And they were happy when they\nsaw Commandant werk -- walking around the street aw -- in a good -- in a mood. They were\nhappy at that time. Well, he -- he wanted -- he wanted to live, but I\u2019ll you again -- you mentioned\nabout his father in Siauliai, I think if he would have lived, his fate would be even worse than his\nbrother\u2019s in Siauliai, from the Soviet Union side. Because in addition of being the head of the\nghetto, he was anti-Soviet, with all I told you before. So I think if my uncle was sent to Vorkuta,\nhe would have -- probably didn\u2019t even reach Vorkuta. He would be finished before Vorkuta.",
        "A: Oh yeah.",
        "A: Coincidence, we didn\u2019t know a thing.",
        "A: No way. Absolutely not connected. Very energetic, very good looking, tall, blonde, blue-\neyed. Didn\u2019t look like a Jew at all. I -- I saw your picture.",
        "A: He had -- I showed you the picture. He didn\u2019t look like a Jew at all. Product of Lithuanian\nschools, Lithuanian university. Energetic person. Pru --",

        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: All right. First it --",
        "A: He had to hand it in, children\u2019s section. That\u2019s what my father didn\u2019t live to see. One thing, he\nwas protecting the children. And two, his moral satisfaction. He did not see the handing in of the\nchildren. They were taken out after his death. He was doing everything he could to protect the\nchildren. Every time the Germans wanted the children, he would offer something else. He si --\nhis brother couldn\u2019t protect her daughter. He was commandant\u2019s -- chief of police daughter, so\neverybody knew. He had to ge-get her. What happened? In -- when stut -- Stutthof was liberated,\nthe Russians put German cows -- cows marching through Lithuania to Soviet Union. And they\nput the prisoners from Stutthof in charge of the cows. And if you talk today to people in Kaunas\nmy age, they will tell you how Kaunas looked when hordes of cows were going through our\nstreets further towards Belose. You have no idea. So, his wife was one of those prisoners from\nAuschwitz liberated --",
        "A: -- Stutthof, liberated, who was put in charge of getting the cows to Soviet Union. Naturally\nwhen they came to Vilnius she ran away -- well, they weren't prisoners any more -- she ran away.\nShe knew where my aunt, my mother\u2019s sister lived, and she came straight to my aunt, and she\ntold us -- she told us everything. She told us how they had to give the child away, and she said\nthat if her husband is alive, they agreed -- cause nobody could even f-fathom what will happen,\nbut they agreed that they\u2019! meet in Lithuania. They\u2019ll look for each other in Lithuania. So she\nstayed with us all the time. She was shaven, her hair started to grow, little by little. And one day\nthe university choir had a concert in Vilnius. We came to Vilnius and I went to visit my mother\u2019s\nbrother.",
        "A: An uncle. And when I knocked at the door and my -- his wife, my aunt opened the door, she\nscreamed in an awful way. I thought, oh my God, what happened, why is she screaming like\nthat? And then I looked deeper and I saw my Uncle Ephrain sitting at the end of second room.\nShe screamed -- and she told me later that she didn\u2019t know how to react. She was afraid of my\nreaction, at the same time she couldn\u2019t control herself. So anyway, he sat in there, 1-in the other\nroom in a German uniform, cause he was six something. They couldn\u2019t find him any clothes after\nDachau so they dressed him in a German army wu -- uniform. Can you imagine, Soviet years,\nwar is still going and I get to the street with a man in German uniform?

So anyway, after awhile of staying in\nthis arrangement, we had no place to sleep. My aunt had only one little couch and one chair that\nyou could open. And there was my uncle, his wife, Maba, Kata and myself, five of us. So they\ndecided that the best thing for them to do would go to Klaipeda. But at that time Klaipeda was\nnot open for private population because it was mined by the Germans when they ran. They\nmined every building.

        "A: Yeah. Now, these were the Russian troops, the frontier troops. Mama, in her wisdom told us\nlook, we\u2019re not waiting for the 30,000 people to be transported back to Lithuania, we\u2019re leaving\ntonight. As long as we are dealing with frontier troops, they are not going to be -- there won\u2019t be\nany inquisition about our political views. As soon as the Russian troops go out and the civil\ngovernment sets in, we\u2019ll start the same thing as we lived in 1940. Who are you, where are you\nand so on and so on. And Mama was right, as always. So, we asked the Russian echelons of\nsoldiers, trains of soldiers, to help us to go back to Kaunas. We explained that we\u2019re refugees\nfrom the war, from the shooting. So Mama, my unc -- my aunt, who came to join us later in the\nhiding place, they transported us as far as Radvilishkis. On the way there, more people joined the\ntrain and they started to tell that in Radvilishkis, which was already in Soviet hands for quite\nawhile, there is already a KGB checking every refugee, his papers, and asking questions. And\nthose people told us that, you know what? You better get, before Radvilishkis, off the plane,\nwalk --",
        "A: -- off the train, walk to Radvilishkis, go in a half circle and get another soldier\u2019s train, jump in\nto go to Kaunas.",
        "A: On railway tracks, yes.",
        "A: But the soldiers were coming from the front, back.",
        "A: So we did what the people advised us, and we were in Radvilishkis, the three of us. We were\non the street and then I see a man coming towards us. I say Mama, doesn\u2019t he look familiar to\nyou, I just can\u2019t point -- how do we know him? Mama couldn\u2019t remember. And then it dawned to\nme. After going to Palegise it was usually, we used to go to a big estate and spend another month\nin that es-estate, and he was the brother of the owner of the estate. Tall man, looked very much\nlike my uncle from Siauliai. Silver hair, big, tall. So I approached him and I said, do you\nremember me and my mother? He looked at my mother, he said, you know what? I think I\nremember you from year after year staying at that estate. And he helped us to go around\nRadvilishkis. He put us on the next soldier train, and we escaped already the Soviet civilian\nauthorities. Now again the same thing when -- when we approached Kaunas, we told -- we were\ntold get off the train little bit before. When the train stops, don\u2019t go to Kaunas railway station,\nit\u2019ll be even worse. Because Kaunas already in Russian hands for quite awhile. See, the area\nwhere we were was liberated only in the si -- October, and Kaunas was already liberated much\nearlier from the Germans.",
        "A: \u00b044,",
        "A: Somewher -- something like that, you see. So that\u2019s what happened, but we didn\u2019t know what\nhappened to my aunt\u2019s apartment. So we walked to the apartment and that\u2019s what we found. We\nfound that she moved all her stuff to one room, let the [indecipherable] into her apartment, but at\nleast she had one room. In those days Lithuania had the cards for food.",
        "A: Ra-Ration cards. I entered right away the university. So we had cards better than the regular\nperson. My aunt went back to work, she was a manager of Spodos Fondas. I don\u2019t know if you\nknow Spodos Fondas. It was a huge chain of -- like Plymptons in America. Stationery --",
        "A: Huge chain. She went back to Spodos Fondas. Now Mama started to look for work. Wherever\nshe went, the moment she filled out papers Gens [indecipherable] Mrs. Gens, nothing worked.\nWe had [indecipherable] we had nothing. So, you know, I was pushed against the wall, I said,\nMama, what are we going to do? On my student card and my aunt\u2019s regular card, we\u2019 ll starve.\nIt\u2019s worse than during German occupation.",
        "A: There\u2019s nothing to eat. I said, you know what? I\u2019m going to Vilnius. I have to find some\nsurvivors in Vilnius, I\u2019Il see what I can finally find out. To make a long story short, I go to\nVilnius, and I knew that in every institution the Kadros Kiros would be again in the hands of\nJewish people. I go to one ministry, I open the door and were f-five of them standing. They\ncouldn\u2019t believe that I am alive. They said, Ada, you alive? What about mother? Said, Mother is\nalive. Said oh, we all knew that you are dead, both of you. Because we disappeared. See, we\ndisappeared so quick that there was no time even to think otherwise. So I said, look, we are alive,\nyes, but you know, we probably will die from hunger cause we have no money, nothing to sell,\nand how do we survive? So he said, oh, don\u2019t you worry. I said Mama was looking for a job, she\nspeaks perfect Russian, when she men-mentions her last name, nobody gives her work. So one of\nthem said, you know what? Don\u2019t you worry. Mama comes to work for my ministry, Ill he --\nmake her a head of administrative si -- administrative de-department, and I'll keep Mama\u2019s\ndossier under key. And as long as I\u2019m the ch-chief, she -- her papers are in the si -- sealed, under\na key. No problems. When I came back to ha -- Kaunas, Mama said, how did you dare to do\nthat? You know that I don\u2019t want to be a prominent person. I don\u2019t, you know, that I\u2019d want to\n[indecipherable] anywhere. I said, Mama, we have to eat.",
        "A: So either or. Either you will be a prominent person --",
        "A: -- or we eat.",
        "A: And th -- that what we did. Now, one day --",
        "A: [indecipherable] ministry.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Commerce ministry. One day he pays us a visit.",
        "A: In Kaunas.",
        "A: He\u2019s in Canada. Tevya Sheriss. He said, Mrs. Gens, I have to tell you that I am not able to\nkeep your papers under the key much longer, and I would advise you to do something about it.\nShe looked at him and said, what do you mean? He said, I am Polish citizen. I am going to\nPoland, I\u2019m repatriating to Poland, and I would advise you to repatriate to Poland. Mama looked\nat him, said, how can I repatriate? I am Lithuanian. I speak Polish perfectly, but I am not Polish\nand everybody in Kaunas knows who I am. So he said, well, try to think of something. And we\nhad in each location, a Polish repatriating committee. So repatriating committee would check\nyour Polish ancestry, but then Lithuanian KGB had to stamp it. So it wasn\u2019t so simple. So Mama\n-- we went to many places in the area of Vilnius, where nobody knew who Mama is. And we\ntried the Polish committees, to talk to them. They said fine, we\u2019ll do it. Because Mama had\nperfect documents from her high school and from work at the Polish refugee committee from the\nfirst war. And they said -- another thing was, I spoke perfect Polish. So, no Lithuanians in those\nyears spoke Polish. So she -- he -- she would tell, look at my daughter. We\u2019re Polish people. But\nthey said, what about the Lithuanian? You will not go through the Lithuanian KGB. So Mama\ncame back to Kaunas and said, I don\u2019t know what to do. There is no way to get official papers,\nand there is no way af-after he unlocks his [indecipherable] and goes to Poland that they will\nkeep me there. So, I don\u2019t know who was the person to help us, but we went through Polish\ncommittee legally, absolutely. Now there was a question of getting Lithuanian exit stamps.\nSomebody took the papers, somebody did the work and somebody got paid. And in our transport\nwere all the workers of Kaunas theater. Ballerinas and drama, everybody was from the theater.\nAt that time my uncle and his wife were still with us, and Mama said Froizim, how about we try\nthe same for you? And he answered, Elenka, there is no way. I am too -- too -- I -- I would show\nin between those people, I would stand out. I cannot risk. I went through so much, I cannot risk\nto be caught at the border. Because we didn\u2019t know the arrangement, was it enough bribe, not\nenough bribe, will we go through? Because we could have been on one stretch to Siberia,\ncrossing the Soviet border illegally. When we arrived at Suwalki and crossing bord -- crossing\npoint, we see that were two young ladies, they went to -- with big baskets with everything in the\nbasket, to the guards, and we see that they handed the baskets and they returned to the -- there\nwas three trucks -- two buses and a truck. And we see that they are lifting up the -- the -- the big\nwooden plank that crosses the border. We enter Suwalki. We enter Suwalki and now, can you\nimagine, in the whole transport of our people, only Mother and I speak Polish.",
        "A: Right, right, to Poland, yes.",
        "A: Yeah, the big bribe. So anyway, Mama looked around at [indecipherable] we can\u2019t stay here\nvery long, because if they catch -- the Poles -- Pole -- Polish were under the Soviet influence.",
        "A: We can\u2019t stay here very long. Let\u2019s try and get out as soon as possible. But was easy said, not\nso easy done.",
        "A: We -- we werte -- yes --",
        "A: -- yes, yeah. Now what happened. My aunt was on the same repatriation paper, there were\nthree of us. And at the last day she said, you know what? I am afraid. I\u2019ll stay, I cannot go.\nBecause 75 percent was doubtful and it looked that we may not cross the border. So she stayed\nbehind. Now, that friend of mine, Mr. Sheriss, before he left he gave us a name and address in\nLodz and he told us look, you get in touch with that person. Do you know what the Jewish aliyah\nis?",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: From all over the world. He said, she is a liaison for Jewish aliyah and when you tell her who\nyou are, she\u2019|l help you to get out of Poland to other destinations. So we come to L\u00e9dz, we find\nthe address and the lady who opened the door said, oh yes, she was in here, but about couple of\nweeks ago, she went west. That was our only connection in Poland. She went west. Ah, but she\nsays, you know what? There is a doctor from Vilnius. He lives in the same courtyard. Dr.\nRomanofsky. Go and talk to Dr. Romanofsky, maybe he\u2019ll know -- because she is from Vilnius,\nhe is from Vilnius, maybe he\u2019ll know where did she go. So Mama stays in the middle of the\ncourtyard, I ring a bell to Dr. Romanofsky\u2019s door. The door opens up. Mrs. Feigenberg opens the\ndoor, and the German nurse stands behind her. And Mrs. Feigenberg [indecipherable |",
        "A: Yeah, worked for -- for her husband.",
        "A: This is already free Poland.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: I understood immediately. I was sent to see Dr. Romanofsky and I found Dr. Feigenberg, one\nof the doctors that my father pulled forward to live in the hospital. He couldn\u2019t live -- he couldn\u2019t\nleave vil -- Lithuania, so he bought himself papers of a deceased Polish doctor, Romanofsky,\nwith his diploma and everything and he arrived Poland illegally himself. The Russians wouldn\u2019t\nlet him go, and he lived in that apartment as Dr. Romanofsky. That\u2019s when -- Mrs. Feigenberg,\nwhen she saw me, she almost shouting me not to call her Mrs. Feigenberg.",
        "A: Working for her.",
        "A: She was a German national.",
        "A: She was working for her husband as a nurse. Not a German for -- but she was a German --",
        "A: -- by -- by nationality. So anyway, you see, that was a split second. If I would have a\nblabbermouth, I\u2019d say, oh, Mrs. Feigenberg, how nice to see you. That would have cut into his\ncareer. So now the Feigenbergs took us in and we stayed more than two months with them. And\nin the meantime the aliyah started working to get us out. Why did we go to Torun? We went --\nwhen we left Lodz, we went to Torun. During the German occupation, when it was quiet in\nVilnius, when they didn\u2019t round up, you know, the young people, I used to take English lessons\nfrom a Polish lady. And then you were -- we got very friendly. Her father was a director of a\ntheater in Toruni. And somehow she\u2019s jokingly told -- said, you know, Ada what -- if you ever\nhappen to be in Poland, if you ever happen to be close to Torun, come and stay with us. I used to\nhelp them a lot. They were afraid to leave the apartment because of the [indecipherable] the --\nthe roundups. I used to go get food for them. So anyway, the relationship was very nice. And\nMama said, you know what? We\u2019re sitting with the Feigenbergs already two months. How much\nlonger can we sit? They were very nice to us. In the meantime, they discovered that Mrs.\nFeigenberg\u2019s deported parents survived Siberia and are on the way back to Poland to join them.\nSo we went to Torun and we started to ask where is the theater. We found the theater and we\nasked, by any chance is Mr. such and such with the theater? They say sure, he returned back to\nhis regular director of the theater. So we went to see -- to see them and we stayed with them for\nawhile. See, sometimes, you know --",
        "A: -- there\u2019s connections, yeah.",
        "A: One of the friends.",
        "A: A friend of mine.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: In the ghetto.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Well these -- that -- oh, the whole five or six, when I entered the room, they were all my\nfriends from ghetto. And when I told them, look, we have nothing to eat, do something, so they\nsaid, let Tevka do it for you. He can do it. He 1s a big chief and so he did it, yeah. So now we\nwere --",
        "A: -- in Torun, and we followed now aliyah. There was a group, was supposed to go via Austria.\nOur group was supposed to go through five borders [indecipherable]. And we were placed -- we\nwere brought to Berlin with a group of Jewish people and placed in the building for Jewish\nrefugees. And while in that building, next day, Mama said, you know, I don\u2019t feel very good in\nhere. We are in the Russian zone of occupation. The Jewish people are already shu-shu-shu-shu-\nshu-shu-shu, something 1s wrong with me and you. They can see that I\u2019m not Jewish and I don\u2019t\nbelieve it\u2019s safe for us to -- to be in here. The man who was in charge of the group, his wife was\neight months pregnant so he is -- was worried about his wife more than about the group, and I\nsaid Mama, we\u2019ll have to do something, but I don\u2019t know what, let me think. What can we do?\nAnd I found out from the group that in the west Berlin there is a huge refugee camp, but huge,\nfor thousands of people. And they were supposed to be transported to that refugee camp. But\nbefore to get to the refugee camp, you had to go in Berlin through Jewish committee to be issued\na certain ausweis, a paper to show that you are a -- a Jews --",
        "A: -- .D.. And when Mama went to that place, they look at my mother and said, sorry, you don\u2019t\nlook Jewish. So I hoped that there was -- somebody would be from Vilnius. I said, do you have\nanybody from Lithuania, from Vilnius in here? They said no, we don\u2019t. So there was no way to\nsay that I am Gens widow and daughter and so on, per -- they didn\u2019t know anything. So when we\ncame back I said, Mama, you know what? You stay here. I\u2019ll try to go to the west zone and see if\nI can get into that camp. Because it was too dangerous. We made through so much, so that\nsuddenly, you know -- and I went to the camp, and I figured it\u2019s no sense to talk to some\nemployee. The director was American General Taylor, not the famous Taylor, another General\nTaylor and asked his -- I asked his secretary that I would like to talk to the director. And she\nlooked at me, said well, young lady, you can sit and wait. I don\u2019t know if he\u2019Il be able to see you,\nbut at least you can wait. I did wait probably three hours. I sat in the waiting room, finally he saw\nme. And you know what, it was nothing to hide. I couldn\u2019t lie. I told him the truth. I told him\nabout my father. I told the Jewish alityah has do -- supported us as far as Berlin, but now we are\nstuck. We cannot get Jewish I.D.. So the first reaction he said to me, you know young lady, this\nall sounds like a fairy tale. I said, it sounds like a fairy tale, but this 1s truth. Because there was\nno way out. We were sitting in Soviet zone of occupation. So he said, don\u2019t worry at all. Here are\nthe two stickers. Go and get your mother, get her to the camp and here you go, we\u2019 ll transport\nyou through Hanover to American zone and that\u2019s the end of your problems. Now I come back to\nthe Jewish house. My mother is half alive. The ladies are putting her cold compresses on her\nhead because I didn\u2019t return for so many hours. Mother thought that maybe the-the Russian\nsoldiers got me, or whatever. She is half dead. And I walk in, I says, Mama, don\u2019t say anything.\nWe didn\u2019t have much, I had a rucksack and she had a rucksack, it\u2019s all we had. I said, take your\nrucksack, get slowly dressed and we\u2019re getting out from here. She said, where to? I said, we\u2019re\nall set, we\u2019re going to that refugee camp. So, they didn\u2019t see us walk out, you know, somehow\nyou find a moment when people are in another room, we walked out. And we got to the western\nBerlin and we got into the camp. Naturally the first thing they did was put a DDT behind your\nclothes, but they gave us food, place to live and everything.",
        "A: In years, right, yeah. But we -- we were staying in the Jewish house in the Russian zone.",
        "A: See, Berlin was, remember --",
        "A: -- Russian, American, French and British. And a huge, huge truck trailer took us to Hanover.",
        "A: Wa -- wa -- that was in th -- in the American zone.",
        "A: I -- I don\u2019t know whether it was in Zehlendorf. I remember the name Zehlendorf, but I don\u2019t\nknow whether in connection with that or not. It was one tremendous big --",
        "A: -- camp. They brought us to Hanover and when we disembarked in Hanover, we were told\nthat\u2019s the British zone of occupation, that the Britishers are returning the bolts and the Soviet\nprisoners of war back to Soviet Union. And that already Soviet prisoners are war -- of war are\ncommitting suicide to the left and to the right because they know that their fate is going straight\nto Siberia. That wasn\u2019t very pleasant because we never expected that Baltic people would be\nreturned to Baltic states. Now, Britishers were as naive as Americans. They figured Baltic states\nare free, you -- you don\u2019t have to be refugees --",
        "A: -- go be home. And while we were on the transport, somehow a young man attached to us and\nhe said, you know what? I know somebody in Hamburg. I'll take you there and we\u2019 ll see what\nwe can do further. So we stayed with that lady, afternoon and then we went to the railway station\nand got into the transport of coal, black coal. And we hid in that carriage with coal -- there was a\n-- you know, a transport that had all kinds of merchandise and they had coal in between. And we\nknew that nobody was going to look for us in that carriage with coal, and we went as far as\nMunich.",
        "A: We looked like a devil, black. When we arrived Munich -- and you know, this is something\nthat goes from mouth to mouth, a -- a place was called Deutsches museum, German museum.\nThat was a center for all refugees in American zone. They used to come for 1-information and\neverything in that Deutsches museum. A --\nEnd of Tape 10\nBeginning Tape 11",
        "A: Now I\u2019m in Munich.",
        "A: Covered in coal dust. So we -- we di -- we wer -- were 1n gi -- a Separate room, we\u2019re -- we\nwere directed to a big, huge room with people, but we had food, we had showers, we could wash\nu-up, we could change our clothes, we had alrea --",
        "A: And we had the stickers from General Taylor, right. But that was only half of the story. I went\nout to look for Lithuanians because we were already out of the cl -- not clutches, but out of being\nsupervised by aliyah. Their role was to bring us to west and we were already in west. So I\nstepped into the hole and then right in front of me stood two men speaking Lithuanian. So I\napproached and I said, by any chance -- but you know, that\u2019s a stupid, stupid question. I said by\nany chance do you know where the Venslauskas family is in Germany? So he turned to me, said,\nyou know Panana, what? If you wouldn\u2019t have found us two here, you would never find out\nwhere they are. They are in a tiny farming village, living with a farmer. He said, I can give you\ndirections how to reach them, and you can take a train up to a certain distance, but from that\ndistance you'll have to walk about 10 kilometers.",
        "A: Uh-huh. And there it was winter and I figured, well that\u2019s the only way to reach. And these\nare the people who helped us escape.",
        "A: Remember?",
        "A: Hide, and th --",
        "A: -- that\u2019s the people -- person who took us from the train to his estate.",
        "A: So now, okay, I take a train. Mama stays safe now in the west and I disembark. The s -- name\nof the station was Donoverte. Hm, 10 kilometers, 10 kilometers, big deal. You know, you\u2019re on\nskiing five kilometers you don\u2019t even feel it. I start walking. I go, I go, and I see a German\nmilitary camp. And [indecipherable] of the German military camp, you know, you have the s-sip\n-- open doors somewhere, I see German soldiers and the German ladies. So I went as fast I could\naround the camp, and I kept walking and a car stopped. He said, where are you going? Would\nyou like a ride? I said, I\u2019m going to such and such village, the farming village. And he said, who\nare you visiting? I said, I am visiting -- I want to find a Lithuanian family, and I mentioned the\nname. Oh, he said, he lives with one of our people over there, so Pll give you a ride. So he gave\nme the last couple of kilometers. I was already tired. It\u2019s winter, snow. I\u2019m not equipped with\nsnow, any skis or anything. He brought me to the door, I knocked at the door, I opened the door\nand here it is, I\u2019m standing in the doorway and the person who was on the train stands inside of\nthe kitchen. He says to me, you are alive? I looked all over Germany, between the refugees,\ntrying to find you. I said, you didn\u2019t show up to take us away. He was supposed to come with\nhorses, take us away, across.",
        "A: For -- from where we were hiding two years. Their estate was not too far. He was supposed to\ncome in and we waited for him to show up, he never showed up. What happened, he was cut\naway, couldn\u2019t cross any [indecipherable]. The Russians were coming from that side, he couldn\u2019t\nge -- he couldn\u2019t come in. So he knew that we were left behind. So when he saw me there he\nsaid, where are you from? I said, from Lithuania. He said, I don\u2019t believe it. Nobody comes out\nfrom Lithuania now. I says, well, we came, we managed.",
        "A: \u201945.",
        "A: \u00b045, yeah.",
        "A: So could have been the six, January, February, because it -- I remember snow.",

        "A: So I said, where is everybody? Where is Mama, where is grandmother, everybody? He said,\nthey are not too far from here. They are in -- in the refugee camp. And he came with me to see\nmy mother, and then he took me to meet his family, already here, in -- in the west. So now he\nexplained to me the situation, he said now -- now you go to Lithuanian committee, get yourself a\nDP card. I said, what\u2019s a DP card? All I have is from General Taylor, di -- ad -- written notes to\naccept the Lithuanian two women into the camp. He said, oh no, no, no. You go to your\nnationality committee and you get a displaced person\u2019s card. In short, DP card, that\u2019s why the ec\n-- expression depokas.",

        "A: So now he explained to me that I have to go to Lithuanian committee in Munich and get\nMama and myself DP cards. So I go to the Lithuanian committee, and Mr. Carvalis was the head\nof the committee. He listened to my story and he says, you know what Panana Nela? I knew your\nfather very well. I\u2019d do anything to help you, but my hands are tied. Nobody at this date can get a\ndisplaced person\u2019s card. You are past the period. Finished. Everybody who came from Lithuania\nas refugees, everybody\u2019s set, everybody has a card, everybody is registered. No more cards. And\nI cannot tell now Americans that you just came from Soviet Union via Jewish aliyah. You see,\ntoo many -- too many contradictions.",
        "A: Too many aliases. So I said, so Mr. Carvalis, so what do you advise me? He said look, two\nblocks away is Jewish committee. Go to Jewish committee. Carvalis knew my father, said, go to\nJewish committee, tell them who you are and have the Jewish committee help you because the\nJewish people still kept escaping Soviet Union in those days and a lot of refugees came in \u00b046 -\n\u2019A47 - \u00b048, running away from the Soviets. So now I go to Jewish committee and naturally in the\nJewish committee everybody knows who I am. So I said, gentlemen --",
        "A: Munich were Lithuanian Jews. In Berlin were German Jews. So German Jews, me telling that\nI\u2019m Gens\u2019 daughter didn\u2019t get anything. Here when they saw me, their approach is, what can we\ndo for you? A different approach. So I told them that I was brought by aliyah, that the lithu -- I\nwent to Lithuanian committee, they cannot help me. They says, what\u2019s the problem? We\u2019ll give\nyou here. We\u2019ll get you a DP card and that\u2019s it. And what they did for us, you know, like in each\nplace there are two classes. They sent Mother and me to Saint Ottilian. Saint Ottilian was a\nGerman sanitory -- or -- or a --",
        "A: -- san -- sanitortum for SS officers. So after the war, that sanitortum was taken away from the\nSS, they left some SS doctors working and gave it for the inmates of concentration camp, the\nJewish inmates of concentration camp. And since Vilnius is considered a concentration camp, we\nwere given a status of concentration camp inmates and sent direct to Saint Ottilian.",
        "A: We come to Saint Ottilian and the first doctor who looked at my mother was Dr. Berman\nfrom Kaunas. He said Mrs. Gens, how are you? You look like the Jesus Christ crucified. There\u2019s\nnothing left. Mama was awful looking. All that tension, all those borders and everything, drained\nher completely. And Dr. Berman was her doctor when she had pneumonia for the seventh time,\nhe was treating her for pneumonia, he didn\u2019t even expect her to survive. So Dr. Berman did\neverything in his power to put her back on her feet. So we had the most -- most wonderful\nconditions, except that we lived in a palatta, in a -- in a sickroom, I mean if -- a room for\nprobably 20 people at least. But we had wonderful food, and we could relax and the nervous\ntension was gone, you see? And we stayed in Saint Ottilian for quite awhile. But that was only\nfor privileged people. And then --",
        "A: They put us on the track --",
        "A: They put us with aliyah --",
        "A: -- with -- the whole way -- you see, we lost connection. We found Dr. Feigenberg, how to\ncontinue the connection --",
        "A: -- and somehow we managed. And we stayed with them very long, until Mama was back on\nher feet. And then we decided that Pll go to Munich and enter university. So when I came to\nMunich and went to the university, they wouldn\u2019t accept people born in \u201926. They were a -- they\nwere having hordes of German soldiers coming from Russian prisoner\u2019s camp, and priority was\nfor the older ones, not for born in \u201926. How much I tried, how much the Jewish committee tried.\nThey said, we don\u2019t make any exceptions to that regulation. So I figured, well, if I can\u2019t go to\nuniversity, I'll go to conservatory. So I went to Munich conservatory, continued, you know, tra-\nla-la.",
        "A: Yeah. Then they -- they started to talk about registration to United States. We registered to go\nto United States as refugees, but I was past 21, and my quota was very bad. There were\nthousands of Lithuanians, but very small quota. Lithuania was a small country. So I had to wait\nyears for my quota and my mother refused to go without me. So we stayed, and one day a -- do\nyou know Veruch\u2019s reform --",
        "A: -- the monetary reform.",
        "A: One day we woke up, 20 marks a person. Well, 20 marks a person, it\u2019s a beginning. You\nknow, again, everything. We were already very well set. We had the [indecipherable] cards. I\nwas attending conservatory, and we weren\u2019t rich, but we -- we managed to survive.",
        "A: Mama didn't want me, she was so f -- so against, but I wanted -- I wanted to find out what\nhappened to these people.",
        "A: No, no. I found out later that Murer was arrested by the Soviets, spent several years in Soviet\nUnion, but when he returned back to Austria, they found him not guilty, but at least I think he sat\nfor six years in Soviet camps. Well, that\u2019s good enough.",
        "A: Weiss -- Weiss died in German c -- prison. This is unforgettable things, I shouldn\u2019t have\nlistened to my mother, I should have gotten somehow to Weiss to find out about my father. She\nwouldn\u2019t let me. She didn\u2019t want anything to do with the Germans. And that was the only liaison\nthat could have helped me to find out about him. He may not have wanted to talk to me, but\nmaybe there are some memoirs or something, you know. But Weiss was dead. I went to see Mr.\nWiesenthal when I was in Vienna and I asked Mr. Wiesenthal maybe he can help me to find out\nabout what happened to my father. He said he has absolutely no idea. There are no --",

        "A: -- archives. So there could be that something is in there, but how to find it, I don\u2019t know. See\nMama is -- Mama is gone. If Mama would be alive, maybe I could try to do something. Now that\nshe is gone, I mean that\u2019s -- it would have given her a peace of mind at least, to know. Now this\nway we don\u2019t know anything. So anyway, that\u2019s it, so --",
        "A: That I was in Nuremberg, yeah.",
        "A: When I was -- now -- now I\u2019m back to the Jewish side.",
        "A: There was a close [indecipherable] where we were staying was a huge Jewish camp, town of\nLandsberg. And there was a big concert in Landsberg. Dr. Feigenberg was one of the chief\npeople in Landsberg, so he told me look, take a train, come to Landsberg. I come to -- it\u2019s like a\nghetto concert. All Jewish [indecipherable] everything, and Dr. Feigenberg came to the door,\ntook me by the hand and marched me to the first row, like I was used to. And I recognized on my\nway, our companions from the Berlin Jewish house. And they\u2019re looking at me and they know\nthat Mama wasn\u2019t Jewish, they could -- they could see it, her blue eyes and everything. And\nthey\u2019re looking at me what I\u2019m doing sitting 1n the first row. The Jewish people had their -- well,\nhow would you say? I remember one expression, Papa tried to match -- if somebody had a\nyellow schein and had no wife, he would match them, not to sleep in one bed, but give a wife a\nchance. He had one of his people who used to be charg\u00e9 d\u2019 affair of Hungary in Kaunas, Mr.\nBrowdig, of a very rich family, and he was given the work as a -- like a minister of foreign\ncountry. And one day we were standing, Mama, Papa and I, Mr. Brownig -- Browdig comes over\nand he says, a -- well, in -- in -- I\u2019ll tell you in Russian, see if you understand. [speaks Russian\nhere] The attached wife of Mr. Glassman sits in the first row, and my wife sits in second row.\nYou see the hierarchy? It was -- in the ghetto it was very important who you are. And during the\nconcert, who you are sat in first row and second row. And then came the [indecipherable]. Pll\nnever forget that. My mother smiled and said, Papa, I\u2019m going to second row. Ill make place for\nBrowdig in first row. [indecipherable]",
        "A: She did, yeah. But you see, to be insulted by the fact, could -- my God, you know, first row or\nsecond row. Well, but that existed. So anyway --",
        "A: It was a concert exactly like in ghetto, all Jewish faces. Exactly. But then we decided that\u2019s\nenough sitting at Saint Ottilian and we moved to Munich, where I entered conservatory and we\nregistered with the American consulate. During those days of registration and all kinds of, you\nknow, checking of the papers, th-this and that, I opened the door. It was the big caserna, the --",
        "A: -- can -- no, no, army barracks where the immigration process was going on. I opened the\ndoor and I see Mr. Josef Mushkat. I\u20191l show you mush -- Mr. Mushkat on the big picture.\nMushkat was a member of Papa\u2019s higher police, and he was in charge of orphans, orphanage,\ntaking care of them, schooling, feeding, everything that was necessary to do for orphans. He saw\nme, he came over. The first question is, where is Mama? I said, Mama is outside. Cause I came\nto get some information, Mama doesn\u2019t know anything, so she\u2019s outside. So he grabbed me by\nthe hand, we went outside, they both cried. And then Mr. Mushkat says, look, nobody knows me\nhere as Josef Mushkat. I am under a different name and I don\u2019t want them to know that I\u2019m Josef\nMushkat. I said, look, as far as we are concerned, you can be whoever you are. So, I haven\u2019t seen\nMr. Mushkat from that day, any more, cause I had no business going for information, I got what\nI needed. I cannot explain why -- I can\u2019t explain -- I think he got tired to be a Jew. He was\nPolish, high class, intelligent person. Writer. He gave us a book in Polish language that he just\nrecently wrote, and I think he had enough being a Jew and wanted to be a regular Gentile.",
        "A: Yeah, he wanted to change his identity.",
        "A: I never saw him again, no. If he -- if he was afraid to be exposed, why should I put a person --\nI went through so much myself not to be exposed, why should I make someone uncomfortable\nby thinking that I might un-unknowingly tell somebody, you know. So now I can talk about Mr.\nMushkat because he would be my father\u2019s age, so he\u2019s definitely not alive. But I never\nmentioned to anyone from --",
        "A: -- Vilnius that ve seen him here. So -- aha, so after the financial reform, I got a letter from a\nclassmate who lived in Munich very close to where I and Mama lived, her parents and she. She\nwrote me a letter that, listen Ada, I\u2019m working at the UNRRA in French zone of occupation. We\nbadly need a secretary for the office of communications to work with the director and there is a\nvery big tension between Latvians and Lithuanians. Everybody would like to have that job. The\nproblem is you need French to talk with -- the whole UNRRA personnel is French. You need\nEnglish to get through the directions from Switzerland, that they come in English. You need\nGerman to talk to the German authorities, and you need Polish, Russian, whatever, and\nLithuanian to take care of the refugees. The Latvians have perfect people, no French. Perfect\nEnglish, perfect German, no French. So Lithuanians are asking us do we know anybody that\ncould fill. And we all feel that the only person to fill that place is you. So, I read that letter and\nsaid, Mama, French zone is so far away. We are set in here, we\u2019re waiting for departure. What\nthe hell will I be doing in the French zone of occupation? I\u2019d never --",
        "A: Sa -- it -- it -- no, Salzburg. [indecipherable]",
        "A: [indecipherable |",
        "A: Quite far away. And said, I never worked in my life. I don\u2019t know office work. We used to\nhave class magazines, you know, class newspaper, so I would do it with one finger. But we still\nhad a typewriter at home, and the others didn\u2019t. So I said Mama, how can I work? Couple of days\nafter, I get another letter. Two days after, I get a cable. So Mama said to me, look, said, she\nstarted with 20 marks like you -- we did. She already paid for the cable, she paid for two letters.\nSo get a ticket, go over there, explain to them that you\u2019re not able to take the job, you never\nworked in your life. And you\u2019ll see the world and you come back. I -- I come over and they --\nthey tell me the picture. The secretary of communications was expecting a baby in two months.\nThe father of the baby to be was a director of YMCA, Polish nobleman. So now the situation is\nawful. The lady can\u2019t bend down any more, the rumors that the father is a director of YMCA,\nthey want to get rid of her as soon as possible. It shows it very badly during, you know, the -- th-\nthe entire, you know, community. So I told [indecipherable] I spoke to him in French, I said,\nmon colonel, I -- I would li -- take the job gladly, but I have never worked in my life. So he said,\nMademoiselle, please just stay. Whatever you can do, do. Whatever you cannot, not. At least\nstay until we find somebody to fill that place. So that it -- that\u2019s -- that what happened. I started\nto work, I started to work and then I figured there\u2019s nothing to it. I handled the correspondence. I\nhanded the director his correspondence, I can handle correspondence to the others. I see what has\nto be done and I accept, you know, instructions from Geneva in -- in English, I sort them out.\nWhat\u2019s there a -- what\u2019s there to be afraid? And you know, I started to work, I started to work\nand very soon I received an army uniform, and I -- I am a lieutenant of the French army, official.\nSo, my girl -- my lady -- my girlfriend who got me, she was always a civilian, so she can say\nlook, you just came. I\u2019m already here several months and I\u2019m a civilian and you\u2019re\n[indecipherable] army officer. So anyway, I stayed there and one day the director called two of\nus. He said, look, the Australian military mission is coming to round up refugees for Australia.\nTalk to your families and see if any one of you 1s interested to go to Australia. Pll attach you as\nUNRRA officer to the Australians to travel around that area, the whole French zone of\noccupation. And then that\u2019!l help you -- open you the doors in Australia. So I talked to my\nmother, I went to Munich back, and M-Mama said, you know what? Your quota is so far away\nand we\u2019re sitting so close to Russian zone of occupation, why don\u2019t we go to Australia and that\u2019s\nit. And then, later on if we decide that we want to go to America, the quota will follow you. And\nthe Estonian girl, she came back, she said no, my family is not interested to go to Australia, we\u2019 ll\nstay in here until our American priority date comes in. So they attached me to the Australians\nand I traveled with them for a long time, getting refugees processed for Australia.",
        "A: Very interesting. So, not to take too much time for that, I -- when we had out of first ship, it\nwas a 1,800 people on it and you had cream of the crop of UNRRA personnel. Both s --\nHungarians, Romanians, Latvians, Estonians, Lithuanians sent whatever was left over,\nUkrainians, Polish, Russians. And we arrived Australia --",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Yeah, yeah, not yet? Okay.",
        "A: Oh, yes, so Nuremberg, what happened at that concert.",
        "A: We can start.",
        "A: Okay.",
        "A: On the ship I continued in the office processing the paperwork. There\u2019s tremendous\npaperwork because you are crossing Suez Canal. You have to make lists and lists and lists to\nreport to the British. So when we came to Melbourne, and then we were sent to a reception\ncenter -- the same day we arrived reception center, I was put to work for immigration department\nalready in Australia. And our sh -- pol -- the policy to get those refugees was domestics and\nlaborers, domestics and laborers. So everybody hot -- got an I.D., men as laborers, women as\ndomestic servants. I was the only one, because of my Australian cooperation, with Australians in\nEurope, I was given office worker. So I was not a domestic. Two years contract, you do\nwhatever the government says you to do. You go wherever the government sends you to work.\nNo, yes, buts or anything, you just go. Two years over, you\u2019re a free person, do whatever you\nwant.",
        "A: In 48, 22.",

        "A: I mentioned -- I mentioned that I went to that -- the concert in Landsberg.",
        "A: In Landsberg they already formed a symphony orchestra and the members were all survivors\nof Dachau. And there were, from Lithuania, the previous members of our Kaunas symphony.\nThey all knew about me and they took me in, just took me in like a mascot. I was the youngest\none, and you know, I ha -- I didn't have anybody but my mother and I felt very secure with them.\nSo one day they told us that, you know what? We have a possibility to go to attend Nuremberg\ntrials, we want to take you with us. I said, fine, why not? Now, I don\u2019t remember a concert\nbefore the trials. I believe they gave a concert. I remember the theater, remember sitting in the\nloge and remember being left by myself, so they must have been on the stage giving a concert.\nAnd they gave a concert in the [indecipherable] uniforms, it\u2019s a striped blue and white.",
        "A: [indecipherable] inmates, right. So a day after that, we had a two day pass to the trials.",
        "A: That was a big Nuremberg trial, with all of them, Goebbels, Goering, everybody, ger -- they\nall sat in a row.",
        "A: And that particular day, they were trying finance minister Speer. As you know, in a -- in a hall\nwith all military it\u2019s all drab. Uniforms, uniforms, uniforms. I had on a dress that was burnt\norange. Not yark -- not the sharp orange, but burnt orange, but still it stood out in that immense\nplace. And I was telling my children when I came back from that place that the heads of those\nGerman inmates automatically turned to see that s-speck of light, of different color than the drab\nuniforms. Anyway, Mr. Speer was start -- was a -- a -- questioned, and he was told that, did you\nknow -- he was asked, did you know about the concentration camps? And he said no, I never\nknew about that. And then they opened the big screen, and on the screen you could see golden\nframes of eyeglasses, golden teeth, golden jewelry. And they said, how do you think, Mr. Speer,\nyour treasury got all this stuff without you knowing where it comes from? Speer kept s -- not --\nno answer. So that registered in my mind, it was so impressive. Suddenly you opened the screen,\nyou show the picture and he has no way to say any more, I didn\u2019t know. So that was how I ge --\ncame to be in Nuremberg, because that -- the s -- the survivor\u2019s group took me with them for\ntheir concert and then we -- two days in a row we attended Nuremberg trials.",
        "A: No. I think justice was done. Soviet Union or France or -- or whoever, justice was done. I feel\nno remorse about them being punished. Let it be Soviet Union\u2019s influence, so what? So what?",
        "A: Yeah, oh, okay.",
        "A: Okay, but that came out later. In those days, how much did we know in -- in the west about\nthe Soviet Union? It started with Solzhenitsyn, with his books, with opening our horizon to see\nwhat\u2019s going on in Soviet Union. Just Lithuanians telling that we had three days of deportation\nwas not enough crime. The whole crime, the whole gulags and everything came after that. So in\nthose days we didn\u2019t know about the gulags as much as we know today.",
        "A: So I would say that, nevermind what the world 1s telling today, naturally the Soviet Union\nfound another way to kill the people. More humane? I don\u2019t know. Freezing and Siberian tigers?\nIs that so more humane than sitting in a concentration camp and being gassed? Wa -- how would\nyou compare one with the other? There is no comparison, both are equally bad. But --",
        "A: No.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: I saw the criminal element who ruined my life, who ruined my mother\u2019s life, who killed my\nfather, who killed millions of people and that was what I thought. Nothing about the Russian\ngulags or anything at that time. Later on we started to compare one with the other, and as I say,\nwhat\u2019s better, to be gassed or to be frozen to death, you don\u2019t know what\u2019s -- what\u2019s better. But\nthe -- in those days, no. I figured that justice was done and they deserved it.",
        "A: Right, right.",
        "A: Right, right. Papa used to talk about Mr. Murer. He was of impression that Murer was a drug\naddict. He said that there were days when you could talk to him like to -- talking to normal\nperson, and there were days when he went berserk, you couldn\u2019t talk to him. And he thought that\nthe withdrawal symptoms when he didn\u2019t have drugs, were main reason when he was so\ninhuman. That was my father\u2019s opinion because he said it\u2019s impossible to have the same person\nbehave this way and that way.",
        "A: Erratic, right.",
        "A: He would come into the room and he would start, up, down, on your knees, up, down. Don\u2019t -\n- do -- he made workers jump up and down for no reason. So Papa got suspicious that --\nsuspicious that he must be under influence of drugs, because he could compare Murer with the\nothers. Nobody behaved like Murer, nobody. He was a single person with such bestiality. And he\nsaid, well one day he\u2019ll pay for it. But you see, six years is not much. Six years is not much.\nWell, Soviet gulag for six years 1s quite a bit, but it\u2019s not much. And then to be exonerated by\nAustrian authorities? And it\u2019s strange because Austrians were always believed to be more away\nfrom Hitler, not such supporters of Hitler. He turned out to be very, very supportive of Hitler. So\nnow that\u2019s how I got to Nuremberg [indecipherable]",
        "A: The two days. We spent -- I think we spent more than two days, but I mean, one day for the\nconcert, then two days we spent in the trials.",
        "A: No, America.",
        "A: Oh, I -- oh, you -- yeah, to Israel, you see, what happened, it was Palestine. Some people\nmanage -- probably you had to have big money -- managed to get it -- exact wording is | --\nlanding permit. A permit to enter, legally, Palestine. I was talking in the Jewish committee, I said\nlook, for all that Papa did, try to get Mother landing permit. I don\u2019t care about myself, I can go\nwith aliyah. I don\u2019t -- I\u2019m not afraid of difficulties or whatever, but not my mother. She went\nthrough too much, physically. She can\u2019t go with aliyah. And they tried. They tried, but they\nexplained to me, you need the big money to be able to procure a landing permit, or you have to\nbe very, very famous figure. But not many people have received a permit. And I was to be on\nthis boat. I believe that was the Exodus boat. If you remember the story of Exodus, I was\nsupposed to be on that boat, but when they couldn\u2019t get Mama landing permit, I said, I\u2019m not\ngoing alone and I\u2019m not leaving my mother in Germany. So, since there is no way to get her, \u2019'm\njust resigning and I\u2019m not going to go by myself. That was the only reason why I didn't go,\nbecause a lot of my friends were already in Israel and we had family in Israel from before. So I\ndidn't mind going, and Mama didn't mind going, but not in her physical condition. She was --",
        "A: Stopped.",
        "A: No. Not much, no. I -- I don\u2019t believe -- I don\u2019t believe she was able to. I remember when we\nwere in hiding, some days we did things around the house and Mama liked to take birds, geese,\nducks, into the fields. She said that gives her peace of mind, not to talk to people, she can talk to\nthe birds. And that would quieten her down. Cause I told you, she would sit in one corner, looked\n-- look -- look at another corner. She took it much harder than anyone I have seen. Much harder.\nAnd well, she was preoccupied with my children because I had a big number of children. She\nhelped me to raise the children.",
        "A: I couldn\u2019t. And that\u2019s what it was, you know, I tried -- I tried my best. Look, I pulled her -- it\nwas through [indecipherable] of let\u2019s try, let\u2019s go, let\u2019s do, let\u2019s do, but she -- I think the reason\nthat we left, she was afraid. Not for herself, she was afraid for me. That\u2019s the only reason why\nshe agreed to try and risk crossing the -- we crossed probably five borders. First one was to\nPoland. Next one was to Berlin. Next one was to American side of Berlin. Next time to Hanover,\nand then to Munich. Five borders. And it\u2019s not so simple. Today when we speak, it seems like\nnothing. It wasn\u2019t so simple. I forgot to tell you, when I mentioned to you that we were leaving\nLodz with aliyah, my aunt remained -- my mother\u2019s sister remained in Kaunas. She gave up, she\nsaid she was too scared and she stayed. And then, couple of days after we left, she figured out\nthat she can\u2019t stay by herself, she wants to join us. So she went to the Polish commission and she\ntold them the story and she said now, can you help me? So they said fine, we\u2019ll do now\nsomething different. We had --",
        "A: Yes. They said, we\u2019ll give you a copy of the original repatriation document, but it has two\nladies and the youngster. You take a lady with her daughter, instead of your sister and your\nniece. And that was one of our known young ballerinas and her mother. So they traveled on the\nrepatriation document budreika a-and she brought them to Poland. Now, on the way, since we\nknew each other and she -- she was helping the Jewish people very much, when she came to\nBerlin, the same story with aliyah, she doesn\u2019t look Jewish. So the -- our Jewish people got her\non aliyah same way, and aliyah brought her to Germany.",

I don\u2019t believe there was a connection of\nKaunas people with Vilnius people, there was no connection. And Simait\u00e9 was connected to\nTatta through us. And Tatta did whatever sh -- was in her abilities to help Simait\u00e9. Sh -- Tatta\nworked more in Kaunas, where there was a group, and all these people were Russian nationals in\nLithuania. They were Lithuanian Russians. There was Dr. Kutraga. There was -- you know, it\u2019s\ndifficult -- the lady, she had a beauty -- beauty salon. Her -- her -- her son was in our basketball -\n- what was it, playing [indecipherable] I'll -- ?\u20191l remember the name. Anyway, I knew the first\nnames of some of them, and these people really did at most that was possible to do. Pulling out,\ngetting places to live, getting places to hide. It was a very well organized group.",
        "A: No.",
        "A: Simait\u00e9 was the only one that was caught.",
        "A: No, because we weren\u2019t there. Tatta -- Tatta remained in Kaunas when we went into hiding\nand then one day she told us that Onos neera, Ona isn\u2019t any more here. So we understood. So\nafter I found out that she was very brutally beaten up, she was thrown into concentration camp,\nbut we didn\u2019t know whether she s-survived or not. She never looked back. She never looked\nback. And later, from the press, I found out that she was in France and that she went to visit\nIsrael, but they think climate didn\u2019t work for her. She returned back to France and she died in\nFrance. And then when I found her brother\u2019s article about her, I realized that she was who she\nwas, a being that you couldn\u2019t put on higher pedestal that she was, but she was also a communist.\nWell, which -- nothing to do with it.",
        "A: Yeah. But Tatta was cooperating with Simait\u00e9. I -- I wouldn\u2019t give you any details because I\nreally don\u2019t know how they did it, what they did, but I know that she helped her carrying the\nwaste, getting food, you know, things like that. Course Tatta was mostly spending her time in\nKaunas and then she would come to Vilnius, stay with us and what -- help with Simaite\u00e9.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: He talked about Dachau, talked about his experience over there. He talked about the\nconversations they used to have, the inmates, what would the conversations be about.",
        "A: And he said that most conversations were fantasies, what we would like to eat. What we\nwould like to be served. And he said that at one point it was really tough. Somebody said that he\nwould like to have some herring, and the pain, not being able, was so obvious that people were\ntelling him, shut up. Don\u2019t mention it any more, we don\u2019t want to hear it. See, y-you\u2019re deprived\nfor so long that even mentioning it makes it bitter -- bitter memories.",
        "A: But he never complained. And in his first letter that I received it, that was very interesting\nhow I found him. He wrote in his first letter that morally I am not broken at all, but physically, I\nam finished. HIAS looked for him, Joint looked for him. All those, you know, the bort -- the --\nthe -- the notices, everybody. Nowhere. Disappeared completely. So one day I got a letter from\nHIAS. We found --",
        "A: Hebrew aid -- aid -- like -- like Joint, same thing.",
        "A: They\u2019re two different organizations both -- both being the same thing. We found trace of your\nuncle. Get in touch with such and such person in Israel and you\u2019Il get more information. So what",
        "A: Oh, that was quite a bit after. Must be \u00b056. Must be \u201956 because I remember we were able\nalready to send parcel. When the Polish repatriation started in Soviet Union, they let the inmates\nfrom gulags join the families outside, repatriate to Poland. One of those families on the way, the\nfather joined from the gulag and the father was telling stories with whom he was in gulag and\nhow it was in gulag. They came to Poland and from Poland with aliyah they reached Israel. After\nthey reached Israel, very shortly after, the father died from heart, he was overworked in gulag.\nNow, those people probably went to HIAS to join to look for their relatives, whatever. His son\nsaw my uncle\u2019s name on the board, looking for, do you know about him. And happily, he\nremembered that his father was mentioning my uncle\u2019s name during his stories from gulag. So he\nreported to HIAS that all I can tell you is that my father was in such and such camp together with\nhim. And that must have been already the time when they started to let them go from gulag.\nLiquida --",
        "A: No, no, he disappeared from the ground of the earth. And they sent -- I mentioned to you that\nmy aunt had to hide that her husband 1s in Vorkuta. She didn\u2019t know exactly where, but she had\nto hide, and she told that he found another woman, he left her and he is somewheres with that\nwoman in Soviet Union. And then when finally he was released, they found each other. There is\nsomething that I don\u2019t recall. I know that somebody somehow was found through my uncle in\nMontevideo. Whether he wrote to Montevideo, whether Mother\u2019s brother wrote to Montevideo,\nbut somehow members of the family got together through Uruguay, but I don\u2019t recall now which\none. So anyway, when he returned, she told that he doesn\u2019t want that other woman any more, he\nreturned to the family. Now the aunt, what happened when they arrested him in Klaip\u00e9da, she\ngrabbed her daughter, same way like Mama and I, and disappeared. She knew that it\u2019s -- next 1s\nher turn, they -- she disappeared. And as much as we all looked for her, Mama\u2019s brother went\nthrough every nook and nook, wherever you could think to look for her and he wrote exactly, she\ndisappeared from this earth. [indecipherable] there\u2019s nothing else I can do, I can\u2019t find her. So\nlater on we learned that she had acquaintances in Moscow, she went to them. They sent her to\nMoldavia and she was living in Moldavia. She was a very intelligent person. She got a job as a\npostmistress. [speaks foreign language here]. That was her address. Until he returned, and he told\nus that when he saw how she lived, it broke his heart. In all those letters, I have so many letters\nfrom him, he described the misery, the conditions in that [indecipherable] unbelievable. And he\ndidn\u2019t have anything. So when we found each other -- I believe he must have written to\nMontevideo.",
        "A: To trace -- no, to trace us.",
        "A: To trace us. That was the way how we found each other later. I mean, I got the -- from HIAS\nthat he is alive, but I couldn\u2019t trace him in Moldavia. I believe he wrote to Montevideo, to\nMama\u2019s brother, cause we knew all these addresses by heart. And that\u2019s --",
        "A: No. He died. I see s -- I -- I went to s-see his wife, his her -- Elana, her daughter, but not him.\nSo after I mentioned to you -- I show you the pictures, you saw his face. So physically he said he\nwas gone. Vorkuta pulls the last strength of your body, and that\u2019s the underground work.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: He died -- he died -- he died -- she got married -- wa -- I have to look at the date when she got\nmarried, he died very soon after her wedding.",
        "A: He never left the Soviet Union, no. But Sonia and aha -- so Elana\u2019s -- how did Elana get out?\nHer husband was Polish citizen. He was Ukrainian, from that. So the way to -- or sh -- or they\nleft when it was let my people go. That could have been. I think that was how the -- that let my\npeople go time, and they left for Israel.",
        "A: And when I went to Israel, I found more of my father\u2019s relatives. Distant cousins, closer\ncousins, they couldn\u2019t believe that I am alive. In Lithuania everybody thought that we are\nfinished there, we don\u2019t exist any more. It was such a surprise to see me alive.",
        "A: You\u2019re welcome.",
        "A: You\u2019re welcome.",
        "A: I think it\u2019s the first time that I -- I really sat and thought about it, tried not to forget. There is\nso much that it\u2019s easy to forget.",
        "A: And then don\u2019t forget -- don\u2019t forget how many years it\u2019s ago. It\u2019s 1950\u2019s or 60 --",
        "A: -- 60 something years, right. Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "A: Yeah, people -- people can take quite a dose. People can. If you have an optimistic outlook\nand if you are not looking, you know, half full, half empty. If you look at half full, that helps.",
        "A: That helps, yeah.",
        "A: You\u2019re welcome.",
