        "Question: This is a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Lillyan\nRosenberg, conducted by Amy Rubin on August 31*', 2006. This interview is made possible by a\ngrant from Carole and Maurice Berk. This is tape number one, side A. Mrs. Rosenberg, could\nyou please begin by telling me your full name as it is today, and also what was your name at\nbirth?",
        "Answer: My name is Lillyan Rosenberg, and I was born Lilly Cohn in Halberstadt, Germany. I\nnow live in New York in Beechhurst, Queens.",
        "Q: When were you born?",
        "A: January 30\", 1928.",
        "Q: And tell me a little bit about your family.",
        "A: My family lived in Halberstadt for many, many years. In fact, my grandfather was already\nborn in Halberstadt. So we have a history of about 300 years and I have some very old papers\nthat go back to my grandparents living in Germany and they lived in Halberstadt all these years.\nAnd my co -- family was very comfortable, and had a very cultured, lovely life in my early\nchildhood.",
        "Q: Who was in your immediate family?",
        "A: My immediate family in New York?",
        "Q: No, in -- in Halberstadt, when you were a child.",
        "A: When I was a child, I had one brother. My brother\u2019s name was Vanna, Vanna Cohn, and he\nwas born in 1923, and I was born in 1928, so my parents just had two children. My father\u2019s name\nwas Ernst Cohn, my mother\u2019s name -- maiden name was Margaret -- Marguerita Marcuza, later\non Marguerita Cohn. And my grandfather\u2019s name, who was also in Halberstadt, was Hugo Cohn.\nHe was married to Zelma Lusch.",
        "Q: Tell me a little bit about the personalities of your parents.",
        "A: My father had a linen factory, and we had a very good sized store in the same building where\nwe lived. The store was downstairs and had many employees. The articles that were sold were\nmostly very elegant linens. In fact, when my parents sent me to England as a little girl, my\nsuitcase has many linens from my parent\u2019s home, and I\u2019m still using them today.",
        "Q: And what about his personality? Can you describe him to me?",
        "A: My father was a very jovial person. He was a happy person. I remember many parties at our\nhouse and my parents were good dancers. And the parties which my parents gave is something\nthat always remained with me, because it was a very comfortable, lovely home in my early\nchildhood.",
        "Q: And your mother, your mother\u2019s personality?",
        "A: I think I\u2019m a lot like my mother. My mother was born Marguerita Marcuza in Stargard, and\nthe area was called Pommern. Stargard in Pommern is now Polish. My mother was a very\nhospitable person, and as I remember, there were many cultured type of affairs such as music at\nhome. There was always piano playing and entertaining, and these were the early memories that\nI have.",
        "Q: What about memories of your family at home? What are some of the earliest memories you\nhave of your family all together?",
        "A: Well, the synagogue played an important part. Every Friday night the men would go to\nsynagogue. I think my mother was home on Friday night, and then there was the usual Shabbas\ndinner. And I do have a picture of the dining room table on a regular Shabbat evening, with the\ncandles, and the challah, the kiddish cup, and my grandfather, who lived upstairs, would always\nbe at our house every Friday evening. This would be routine, and then on a Shabbat morning, we\nalways went to synagogue. The synagogue played a big role in my childhood. The men and\nwomen were seated separately. The men were downstairs and the women were upstairs like in a\ngallery. The children were with the women and we would look through this little fence-type\nthing and go downs -- look downstairs at the men. And I would look forward to the one\nparticular time that the children were allowed downstairs in the main synagogue, and that was\nSimchas Torah, when they had s-sweets and candies for the children. And I even remember\nplaying a prank here or there in the synagogue by putting some bread -- breadcrumbs or cookies\ninto some men\u2019s jackets. My friend Ruth Oppenheimer, her name then was Ruth Lindheimer, but\nshe also lives in New York, and we are still very, very good friends, I talk to her daily, well she\nand I played this prank and we put these cookies, or crumbs into men\u2019s suits and pockets. And\neventually we had to go and own up to it and apologize. We did.",
        "Q: Do you remember the name of the synagogue?",
        "A: I only remember my [indecipherable]. I don\u2019t know if it had a particular name. There was one\n-- this was the main synagogue, and then there was another little synagogue called Klaus, and\nthat was for those who were super, super Orthodox. And there were quite a few Jewish family\nwho were very, very Orthodox. And in the building which used to be the Klaus synagogue is\nwhere they are now having the new little museum to commemorate and try to show what Jewish\nlife was like before Hitler.",
        "Q: And what about your family, would you consider your family Orthodox? Your family in\nHalberstadt?",
        "A: No, my family in Halberstadt was not considered very Orthodox, although we had separate\ndishes for milk and meat, and by American standards, I would con -- probably say it would have\nbeen Orthodox. But by the standards of Halberstadt, it was not considered to be so, because\npeople were either extremely Orthodox -- and I remember my mother saying [indecipherable]\nkosher, which means we are new kosher, and that meant we\u2019re not so terribly strict.",
        "Q: So, can you describe to me a little more about the town of Halberstadt?",
        "A: It was a very charming town of mostly half-timbered houses. Half-timbered means it\u2019s sort of\ncement and wood together, with a great deal of detail of wood. And I remember some of the old\nbuildings, one having a statue on the outside, and that is the town hall. This statue was called\nBucco, and we learned a little poem as children, which says Bucco von Halberstadt [speaks\nGerman here]. And it means, Bucco from Halberstadt, what will you give our children? Will you\ngive them a new pair of shoes? Yes, that\u2019s what your children should have. And I remember\nsome of these children\u2019s songs and some of these children\u2019s poems, because I was 10 and a half\nyears old when I left Halberstadt.",
        "Q: And how large of a Jewish community in Halberstadt, would you say?",
        "A: I really don\u2019t know, but there were hundreds of families, but I do not know the exact number.\nI am sure that that could be found at the mew -- new museum, which is now called the Moses\nMendelssohn Academy. They would have all the exact figures and details.",
        "Q: What was your sense of things, was it a -- a fairly large Jewish community for the size of the\ntown?",
        "A: Yes, I believe it was. As a matter of fact, Halberstadt was well renowned in the Jewish circles,\nbecause of having a large community and a very active synagogue, and a very active Jewish\ncommunity life. I have noticed that in some of those old papers that I have, and the ones that date\nback about 300 years, they were written in Hebrew, so we had some of those translated. And\nthey -- it said for instance, that many businesses were conducted while in s -- during or after\nsynagogue when people -- it was a meeting place, so it was a very active Jewish community.",
        "Q: And what about your family? Do you remember if it was mostly Jewish friends that your\nfamily had, or also non-Jewish friends in the town?",
        "A: I do think that my -- the majority of my parent\u2019s friends were Jewish. Also, the children I\nwent to school with, since I was at the Jewish school, they were all Jewish, and the parents\nwould be fren -- friendly for many, many years.",
        "Q: And can you describe to me a little more in terms of a physical description, your home?",
        "A: Our home was a rather elegant home. It was situated right above these stores, which were at\nground level. My grandfather owned the property, and there were at least three to four bedrooms,\na large living room, then there was -- the living was qua -- w-was -- the efs -- there was [speaks\nGerman], which is a smoking room. So it\u2019s a dining room, living room, smoking room. My\nparent\u2019s bedroom, my brother\u2019s bedroom, and mine, and there was a guest bedroom. And\neverything was rather elegantly furnished. We had a maid who took care of my brother and\nmyself. Her name was Alvina, and she was with us for many, many years. I have a picture even\nnow of Alvina and my brother and I being at the wedding and I was the flower girl, age about\nfour or five years old, with little flowers in the hair. But I do have the picture of Alvina. She\nmarried a man who was a carpenter, and my parents asked this ge -- this gentleman to make a\ncopy of our kitchen, so I had a small kitchen, a replica of my parent\u2019s kitchen, and as a child I\nplayed with that a great deal. And when I went to England my par -- parents actually sent that\nchildren\u2019s furniture to England. What happened to it, I don\u2019t know.",
        "Q: What are your earliest memories as a child?",
        "A: They were happy memories and I remember the first day of school, where my friend Ruth\nLindheimer [indecipherable] and I started school together. And children at school get like a big\nbag, like a huge cone out of cardboard, and that is filled with candy and toys and pencils. So that\nwas a very happy kind of memory. That was approximately 1935, and I was at the Jewish school\nuntil the school was closed, and that was after Kristallnacht - Crystal Night.",
        "Q: So one of your first memories is -- is probably the first day of school, and -- and tell me more\nabout school, other memories you have of the early days of being in school.",
        "A: I guess things were still quite normal in the early days. For instance, Hebrew was taught from\nthe beginning on, like a foreign language. Later on I would learn a foreign language by\ntranslation. And so we translated prayers, and not only learned to translate word for word, but\nalso how to make little sentences, so that we had a fairly good knowledge of Hebrew. I can still\nread Hebrew, although I must say that when I left Germany, I had little contact later on with\nJewish people.",
        "Q: So you were at a religious school?",
        "A: Yes, the school was religious and the headmaster\u2019s name was Luntner, Herr Luntner. That\nfamily had five children in various ages from -- some -- the older one was called yo -- Jota, and\nshe came with me to the train station on the day I left Germany. But school was a happy time,\nand it seemed perfectly normal, we did the usual things, like gymnastics. I would walk to school,\nit was not very far, probably a 10 minute walk. And having been back in Germany a couple of\nyears ago, I saw the building again.",
        "Q: Do you know the name of the school?",
        "A: Yeah, this was the Juda [indecipherable] in Halberstadt. The Jewish school in Halberstadt.\nHow many chil -- students were there, I don\u2019t know, but I do have a picture of all the students\ntogether, taken in Halberstadt at a ttme when my brother and I were at school together, and my\nfriend Ruth, and her present husband Henry are also on that picture. There are approximately 40\nstudents on that photo which I have.",
        "Q: Now tell me a little more about your brother, his personality and when you were very young,\ndid the two of you get along, did you fight? Tell me about him.",
        "A: Well, my brother was, as I said, five years older than I, and he seemed to be very proud of\nhaving a little sister. He often told me later on as we were growing up that he said [speaks\nGerman here]. In other words that means I or -- put in an order for you. So he was very proud of\nhaving a little sister. Although, as I grew up, I think I was sometimes a bit of a burden when my\nparents said they had to take me along, and I would drag behind all these boys, who were\nteenagers by then, and they had to take along the younger sister. So it wasn\u2019t always great fun for\nhim, but perfectly normal. However, my brother took great responsibility for me. Obviously, my\nparents must have said that he should keep an eye on me always, and he always did because the\ntwo of us were in England, even though we were not together.",
        "Q: And what about, since you were at a Jewish school, I\u2019m imagining the other students are\nJewish, did you have any non-Jewish friends in the town of Halberstadt?",
        "A: I can\u2019t remember any discrimination, but I actually don\u2019t think that among my circle of\nfriends that there were non-Jewish friends, because they were probably children I went to school\nwith, and children whose parents my parents knew. So I don\u2019t have any real collection --\nrecollection of anyone non-Jewish.",
        "Q: Now, when the Nazis came to power, you were very young. And tell me what your very\nearliest memories are about the beginning of the Nazis and the Hitler regime.",
        "A: You know, times were not like they are today where you put on a television and you see\ninstantly what is happening in some other part of the world. And I think my parents shielded us\nfrom any extra worries, or extra concerns. However, I do remember seeing signs in the windows\nthat said, Juden [indecipherable]. That means, Jews are not welcome here. And I would question\nthat sort of thing by -- because I could read by then. In 1933, Hitler came to power on my\nbirthday, January 30\". Other schools had a holiday because Hitler was in power, it was a day off\nfrom school. Not in the Jewish school, we went to school. And then one day, coming from\nschool -- and this would be closer to like 1938, other kids would call across the street, look at\nthose Jews, look at those Jewish children, and the kids would throw stones at us. And I said -- I\ncould not understand, why would they be throwing stones at us, we weren\u2019t doing anything. And\nyou\u2019d run home as quick as possible. So these are my first bad feelings on knowing that\nsomething was going on beyond our control.",
        "Q: Well, you would run home and you would probably talk to your parents about this. What\nwere they telling you? Do you remember any of the discussions with your parents?",
        "A: I was aware that there was a Nazi party, because the other children, who were not Jewish,\nbelonged to an organization called the Hitlerjugend. The Hitler youth. And of course, my brother\ndid not belong to the Hitler youth, who would have been maybe 14 or 15 at that time. But the\nJewish youngsters had their own organization, the Maccabee or some other clubs that they would\nhave. But the Hitler youth were very visible in Germany, and of course I was aware of that. But\nit was not a major discussion in my parent\u2019s home until the night of Kristallnacht, when the\nNazis came to our home in the middle of the night, and they knocked at the door, and if --\neverybody was sleeping, it was an ordinary night, no one expected anything unusual. And there\nwere two men at the door, and they said, we are here to get mis -- Mr. Cohn, Ernst Cohn, my\nfather. And he had to get dressed very quickly, and the two men marched downstr -- the street.\nOur home 1s diagonally across from the main post office. The main post office is still there, our\nhome is not. And as we looked out, we could see other Jewish men, each one with two SS men,\nthey\u2019re -- the Nazis. And they walked them off, we did not know where they were going. They\ntook them and put them into a prison in Halberstadt. And a couple of hours later they knocked at\nour door again, and they said, we came to get the other Mr. Cohn. And my mother said, you\nalready took him, he\u2019s gone, he -- he left. And they said, there\u2019s another one. Well, my brother\nwas hiding in a closet or somewhere that same night. And she said, the only other Herr Cohn is\nupstairs, but you would have to carry him because he is an invalid and he is very old. They said\nno, that\u2019s not the one, and they left. That way my brother was not taken. My father was then\ntaken to Buchenwald, a concentration camp.",
        "Q: Can you -- can I ask you, what was this like? You were very young, and -- and was this very\nfrightening, that night that this happened?",
        "A: Well, I realized that things were terribly, terribly wrong, and it\u2019s a -- an extraordinarily scary\nevent for any child. I did not know the multitude of significance of what was happening on a\nworldwide basis at the time. My father was in Buchenwald for a little over five weeks. We did\nfind out where he was. I don\u2019t know whether it was Red Cross letters, or -- by some way, my\nmother knew where my father was. And he came home after five weeks, a good five weeks in\nBuchenwald, and his hair was shaven from his head completely, he had lost a lot of weight. And\nmy father, having been on the road as a salesman for many years, said, I always brought you\nsomething home, well I brought you something. And he had dry bread in his pockets that was\nvery, very hard, but he said, I brought this for you. It was then, when my father came home, that\nmy parents decided they must do something to rescue the lives of their children, for my brother\nand I. And they then registered me for the -- or both of us for the kindertransport. My brother,\nhowever, was 15 at the time, and I was 10, and at 15 they no longer took children on the\nkindertransport. They took them from four to 14, and he was a little too old, so he was not able to\nhave guardians in England like I did.",
        "Q: Now, let me ask you, before Kristallnacht, did you notice -- do you remember other things\nthat were happening and changing? Did you ask any -- you know, additional questions of your\nparents? Do you remember anything else going on even before all of this happened at\nKristallnacht?",
        "A: Well, they came to every Jewish home and collect -- demanded all silver and gold. So my\nparents had to give up the jewelry, and I believe they must have hidden certain things, they did\nnot give up everything. But they hi -- picked up sil -- silverware. You were allowed to keep two\nsets of silver per person. So I don\u2019t know just how many things my parents were able to save\nlegitimately, but I remember them coming to every Jewish home and collecting these items. And\nof course my father\u2019s store was closed. You were no longer allowed to have a store, to run a\nbusiness, which my -- was in my f -- grandfather\u2019s hands, and then my father\u2019s hands for many,\nmany years. There was this line and fabrique Halberstadt. But it was closed, and I think my\nfather took a little suitcase, and traveled with this suitcase to some of his customers who were\nlocated in the country -- countryside somewhere, and he would continue doing some business,\ngoing by train.",
        "Q: What happened to that shop once it was shut? Did anything else happen there, did others take\nit over?",
        "A: Others took over the store, and I don\u2019t remember exactly who owned it at that time. But at --\nthe building always belonged to my grandfather, and bef -- tween the main building, there was a\nyard in the back of the main building, and then another house, called Hinterhouse, like the\nsecond row of houses, and that had tenants in it. So there were a lot of people living in that small\narea. Unfortunately, just towards the end of World War II, the whole property was bombed, and\nthere\u2019s none of that left, and when I went over there for the first time, I thought I would feel\nterrible about seeing my parent\u2019s home, but it\u2019s no longer there. So I did not have to feel terrible\nabout a building I had never seen before, built by the Russians.",
        "Q: Now let me also ask, what was happening among your school friends? Were -- were other\nchildren leaving the town even before Kristallnacht? What -- what did you notice about any of\nyour friends during this time?",
        "Q: The friends -- circle of friends grew smaller and smaller. Gradually families emigrated to any\ncountry which would offer them asylum. My parents had a quota number to come to America.\nAnd I know the quota number was 51 thousand and something and it would have taken one to\ntwo years before that quota number would come up. Meantime, though, other families emigrated\nto Chile, to Argentina, to Palestine, to any part of the world that would take them. And it was\nvery hard to find a country that would take in a Jewish family. For instance, in America you\nneeded to have someone who would guarantee that they would take care of you if you did not\nhave employment. We had an unc -- my -- brother of my mother, Hans Marcuza was living in\nNew York, and he filled out all the necessary papers for our family. But the quota number which\nwe had would not have come due for at least a year or two after the war had started. So in the\nmeantime, my family, my f -- mother and father decided that 1t would best -- be best to send us to\na safe area anywhere, and then they filled out the application at Bloomsbury House in England to\n-- for the kindertransport.",
        "Q: Can you explain what Bloomsbury House 1s?",
        "A: Bloomsbury House was the organization in England, similar to HIAS in America. A Jewish a\n-- organization that sponsored particularly Jewish children. And they took an -- not only an\ninterest, but followed each child who was able to come to England, they would follow their\nprogress, and you had something to fall back upon, which was Bloomsbury House.",
        "Q: I think I\u2019m going to turn the tape over.\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning of Tape One, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Lillyan\nRosenberg. This is tape number one, side B. Okay, if you want to continue with what you were\nsaying before.",
        "A: We were discussing the kindertransport and Bloomsbury House. It was summer vacation\ntime, and it was, of course, after Kristallnacht, so the Jewish school was closed. There was no\nmore official school, but it was the height of summer, and my mother and I always went to visit\nher mother, her parent\u2019s home. And that was in Stargard in Pommern. So my mother and I were\nspending a week or two vacation in Stargard when my father contacted my mother and said we\nhave to come home right away because Lillyshin -- they called me little Lilly has guardians in\nEngland and she\u2019s leaving for England next week. So we packed up, we left Uma in Stargard. Of\ncourse, this was the last time I saw her. And we went via Berlin to Halberstadt, and my mother\nsh -- did a great deal of shopping for me. Little [indecipherable] dresses with matching aprons,\nand we had a seamstress coming into our house, that was the normal thing. She made a couple of\ndresses and clothes for me for the departure, which was the following week.",
        "Q: Can we back up just for a moment? I think that you started to keep a diary even before you\nleft. Do you remember when you started keeping the diary?",
        "A: Yes, I do remember the diary. For my 10\" birthday I got a diary from my mother, and on the\nfront page it says tagabu, which 1s diary, given to me by mutti, by my mother, for my birthday.\nAnd I wrote about every day life in Halberstadt, and the little pranks we played as children, and\nthe normal life, really, because I was a pretty happy-go-lucky child, and did not have all the\nburdens of the world on my shoulder. So I kept this diary, and the first part of it is all written in\nGerman, however when I left Germany to go to England, being on the train and feeling very\nmuch alone and knowing no one, I wrote into the diary, and I even wrote into the diary in\nHolland, which is the route we took from Holland to -- from Hook van Holland to England. And\nsince there was nobody for me to communicate with, and I didn't realize that suddenly I was\nreally alone and on my way somewhere, not knowing where I was going, I guess it became a bit\nscary, and so I wrote into the diary.",
        "Q: Even before you got onto the train headed, you know, to England, eventually, on the\nkindertransport, what were your feelings at the time that you heard -- you were on vacation at\nthat time, I believe -- what were your feelings about hearing that you were going to leave?",
        "A: Since that was my parent\u2019s wish, to have us in a safe place, my parents were actually very\nclever, because when I think about how my parents handled discussing this with me, I only\nrealize how very wise they were. For instance, both my parents said, look how lucky you are.\nYou will be learning another language, you will be seeing new people. And they just made me\nfeel like I was very special and very fortunate, so I believed that and -- and left quite happily, not\nrealizing then that I would never see my parents again. And of course, I must add that we were\nall in hopes that we would be reunited in the United States. If that quota number had come\nthrough and had not been a war declared, eventually my parents would have gone to America,\nand we would have joined them. And that was the fact with many of the other children who came\nto England like I did. I was not one of the fortunate ones.",
        "Q: Now before we get to the day of your departure from Halberstadt, can you tell me what else\nyou remember having happened at the time of Kristallnacht in the town? Were there other signs\nof things that had happened that night?",
        "A: Those are all very unhappy memories. I know that many Jewish families, whoever were there,\nit was the women, came to my parent\u2019s home, which was always a very gracious, open house,\nvery ha-happy place for people to congregate. So people came there just to be together. And I\nknow that eventually they all had to give up their apartments and homes and I heard that many\nfamilies moved in with my parents, and that was after I had left. But my memories of the time\nwhen my father was in concentration camp, it was a terrible time and great insecurity. We did\nnot know if my father would come home, if he would survive. We were already aware that\nterrible things were happening to Jews everywhere. So these were unhappy memories, and my\nparent\u2019s effort was to save the life\u2019s of their children.",
        "Q: What other efforts do you remember them making for the whole family to emigrate? Were\nthey still trying to do that, or they thought that that was not possible any more?",
        "A: At that time it was very difficult to get across the border anywhere. I believe my father would\nhave had the opportunity to go to Cuba, but he did not want to go alone, he would not have left\nmy mother. So unless they could have gone together, my father did not want to go alone. I was\ntold that, and I think that happened after I was already in England. Now, I only know that the\nfamily I mentioned before from the headmaster, those children, there were five children, would\nhave had an opportunity to go to England on the kindertransport, but Herr Luntner said, either we\nall go, or none of us go. And that\u2019s the choice that people had. So that on the monument which 1s\ntoday in Halberstadt at the place where all the Jewish people had to assemble to be deported, all\nthe Jewish people, and on the men -- monument are the names of the people who were deported,\nand it has the father and mother of the Luntners and all five children. My parent\u2019s name is also\non the same monument, and I know that if my parents had not sent me to England, my name\nwould have been there.",
        "Q: Now, when you were on vacation with your mother, and you learned that you would be going\nto England soon, what did you learn at that time about the people you would go and stay with in\nEngland?",
        "A: Well that\u2019s an interesting question because my father\u2019s sister, my Aunt Lucy, Tante Lucy\nSpear was in England. In Germany she was a very wealthy woman, married to a banker in\nFrankfurt, Ulya Spear. Now she became a chambermaid in England, in Manchester. So my\nparents wrote to Tante Lucy and said Lillyshin is going to England next week, this is the address\nof the family, Mr. and Mrs. Allen, and the address in Rochdale, Lancashire. My aunt\nimmediately contacted the Allens, and visited the Allens, and they were very gracious to her. So\nwe had a little knowledge about the family I would be going to. My aunt then wrote to my\nparents and said that I would be very lucky to be with such a wonderful family and that they are\nvery, very anxious to have me come. And so we had a little knowledge about the family I would\nbe going to.",
        "Q: And you know, how did the match get made with this family?",
        "A: The match was made through Bloomsbury House. People who applied wrote in about the age\nof the children, and a photograph, and a little about the family and family background. The\nAllens actually had tried for a different child, but -- her name was Erica, and it did not go\nthrough for some reason because Erica had other foster parents who would take care of her. I met\nErica much later when we were at school together. I saw -- I had seen the picture of her, and now\nI met her, so I took the place of that child, Erica, and they chose me by the photograph and\nbackground of my family\u2019s history.",
        "Q: Did your parents have to put up money for this?",
        "A: I really don\u2019t know. If so, it probably was very little. I think I read somewhere that they put\nup some money, but it would not have been very much. I think that we were just told what we\nwere allowed to take with us on the train, which was a rucksack and a small bag that you could\nhandle by yourself.",
        "Q: Did you have other items sent to you, or was that the only -- were those the only items you\ntook from your home?",
        "A: After I got to the Allens, my parents send the little kitchen I had, out of wood. It was about\nthe size of a -- the height of a dining room table, 1t was a good size little unit of a dishwashing\nsink and a little table and chairs. And my friend Ruth had the same thing made. So they sent that\nand a very large steamer trunk. And in that steamer trunk was, at the very bottom, an Oriental\nrug, a runner, and a lot of linens. And of course I couldn\u2019t understand why I should have all these\nlinens, but they\u2019re beautiful works of art, all handmade, and of course that was my father\u2019s\nbusiness. And I have always kept these linens and I\u2019m using the pillowcases to this day. They are\njust very, very beautiful, and they wash beautifully, and it\u2019s a constant reminder of my\nchildhood. There was also an accordion when these things arrived. At customs they s -- thought\nthat the accordion was sent as a valuable item that one could sell as an investment, so they said,\ncan I play it? So I said sure. So I remember right there in the customs, where someone from the\nAllen\u2019s family took me, and I took the accordion and played quite well. So they were -- I was\nable to keep the accordion.",
        "Q: Well just going back a little, were you musical as a child in Halberstadt? Did you play music\nor have other hobbies that you pursued?",
        "A: Yes, I did have piano lessons as a young child in Halberstadt. I had piano lessons in England\nand played Chopin, Schubert and Mozart and Beethoven.",
        "Q: Any other hobbies or interests you remember as a small -- as a young child in Halberstadt?",
        "A: Art was always my hobby. If I had a choice to go to a toy shop or a dress shop or a place for\npens and pencils and paint, I would certainly choose whatever had to do with art. And that has\nremained with me throughout my life. But then, my mother was an artist, so maybe I saw her\npainting and I just took to it, and it\u2019s something that I have enjoyed, and I have enjoyed being\ncreative.",
        "Q: Did your mother work outside the home?",
        "A: I know she would not have a job, but I think she was in the store downstairs for a certain time,\nbut there was someone taking care of us, Alvina was always there. So she might have helped in\nthe business, but art was my mother\u2019s hobby, and I just remember her painting a great deal.",
        "Q: So now let\u2019s talk a little bit about the -- the day -- the days leading up to your departure from\nHalberstadt, what you remember about either the preparations, any family discussions you\nremember.",
        "A: The preparations were pretty frantic because it was only one week and there was the shopping\nand the packing, and then of course my mother sat down with me and said, you know, there may\nnot be anyone there who will explain the facts of life to you. And little did I understand what my\nmother was talking about. She said, you know, you\u2019re a pretty little girl, and don\u2019t sit on a man\u2019s\nlap and don\u2019t let a man get too close to you. And I couldn\u2019t understand what she\u2019s talking about.\nI said sure, sure. I didn't realize until I was in my teens did I know what my mother was talking\nabout. She also explained menstruation, not to be scared if that should happen. And of course at\nthe age of 10 it\u2019s very early to be speaking about these things, especially since I wasn\u2019t asking\nthese questions, but my mother probably anticipated that there may not be anyone there who\nwould explain these things. And it wasn\u2019t until much later that I really understood what that was\nall about. But my recollections in getting ready were all positive, because I was told how lucky I\nam and you see this [indecipherable] Ruth I was talk about, she doesn\u2019t have guardians -- she did\neventually, and she also came to England. But at the time, each child who was lucky enough to\ngo was considered very, very fortunate, because -- and by that time everyone was trying\nfrantically to get out, just to be secure and to save lives.",
        "Q: And do you remember any discussions with your father as well, or mostly with your mother\nas you were leaving -- getting ready to leave?",
        "A: The discussions were mostly with my mother, but the letters are more for my father because\nthey were typewritten letters that came to England. And they were always good humored and\ngood-natured. In none of the letters did it ever say, your room is empty and we miss you. It was\nalways, look how lucky you are. And in my first letter to my parents, I wrote that ma -- the\nguardians wanted me to call them Pop and Ma, and I didn\u2019t want to do that. But my father wrote\nback -- no, it was my mother who wrote, you see how lucky you are, you already have two sets\nof parents and I had to wait until I was married to have a second set of parents. So you\u2019re very\nfortunate. Go to them and give them a hug and tell them you love them, and always be gracious\nand be grateful. So my parent were extremely positive about everything and that made me feel,\nwell they know what is right and -- for me.",
        "Q: Do you know how it is that they wound up being so positive? Do you have any perspective at\nthis point, or insight as to how they were able to do that?",
        "A: I think it\u2019s -- you just have to have very strong character to be able to do that. And now that I\nam older, and have children of my own, I have often thought that if I were in that same position\nto send children away, I\u2019m quite su -- I am not sure that I would have done that, because I think\nit is a terrible thing for parents to part with their children. As I said, there were some who said we\nwill all go or none of us go, and it\u2019s a dreadful decision for parents to have to make. And I am\nnot sure that I would have done what my parents did.",
        "Q: So what do you remember about the actual day that you left Halberstadt?",
        "A: I played the piano in the morning, and I played a German song that I know, it\u2019s -- what was\nit? [speaks German here]. Because I played the piano quite well, that means, do I have to go, do I\nhave to go out of this town. That\u2019s the name of that song. And I just thought it was very fitting.\nAnd I took my diary with me, and a sandwich, which was in the rucksack. And my parents and\nmy brother and Yuta, somebody we knew from very good friends, came to the train station. And\nYuta took the picture of my departure at the train station. So the whole family, my brother, my\nparents and I are on this picture at the train station in Halberstadt. And today you can see the\nsame water tower at the train station in Halberstadt. It was not bombed, and it\u2019s still there. When\nI was in Halberstadt a few years ago, I went back to the same spot and had a picture taken.",
        "Q: So this was in the morning you went to the train?",
        "A: Yes, we went to the train from Halberstadt to Hanover. Hanover was the next bigger town.\nAnd in Hanover my parents were no longer allowed to go onto the train station, to the track to\nsay goodbye. They kept parents away at that time. That\u2019s why I think the picture of my parents\nand I at the train is a rather rare picture, and it is used a great deal for teaching purposes in\nAmerican schools and schools in Germany. So that particular picture was taken in Halberstadt at\nthe train station, but not in Hanover. There was one other boy who went with me on the\nkindertransport, his name was David Winter. He was in England with me, and eventually went to\nIsrael.",
        "Q: So your parents were able to travel with you from that train platform where the photo was\ntaken, to Hanover, and then that\u2019s where they had to say the final goodbye. And tell me how --\nhow was the final goodbye at the train station in Hanover?",
        "A: Well, In -- I think my mother was sort of hiding under a big collar of coat, and it\u2019s just a very\nheart wrenching time in everybody\u2019s lives, and suddenly fi -- I found myself sitting on a train --\nin the train with other youngsters, nobody knew each other, and it was a very, very strange\nfeeling. I guess I looked out of the window and at that point there was no one there, and I -- it\nwas the first time I realized that I\u2019m really alone, and where am I off to? However, the\nkindertransport was well organized. It was a locked train, Nazis came in, they would ask\nquestions. Do you have rings, do you have a diamond, do you have a watch? They would ask all\nkinds of questions, but for security reasons I think everyone was very careful with their children.\nParents would not put their children at risk, so -- but they would be walking around, and finally\nwe came to Holland, and suddenly the older children were very jubilant and so happy. They said\nthat we have left Germany. This is the -- this is an upsetting time, having left Germany.\nHowever, people got onto the train once we got to Holland, and they brought cocoa and cookies\nand apples, and the older children, who were more aware of what was going on, were very\njubilant and they sang Hebrew songs, the sort of songs they would sing at a club or at a party.\nAnd it was only then that I realized that we are really out of Germany. From Holland we got onto\na ship, which took us across the English channel. And we were assigned certain berths. My berth\nwas the upper berth. And I had never slept in a bed that was made with sheets and blankets,\nbecause in my parent\u2019s home we had a feather bed. Was like a huge pillow, and you got under\nthe -- under the feather bed. Well, I didn\u2019t know what to do with this. I slept on top of the bed, I\ndid not know that you had to get in between. And I thought it was a rather strange way of living,\nbut -- so I did all the things that were expected and required, and by morning we arrived in\nEngland. I believe it was Harrage. And we were all herded off the ship, and were taken to a huge,\nhuge hall, with lots of benches. And we all had a tag around our neck with a number, like a\ncardboard tag with a ribbon. And you -- each per -- kid had a different number, and then you\nwaited until somebody called your number. I guess they did it in English and German at the time,\njust the numbers. And when my number came up, this -- to me she seemed like an elderly lady,\nshe was probably in her 40\u2019s, and that was Nellie, Nellie Mills, the private secretary of Mr.\nAllen. He sent his private secretary to pick me up. And Nellie Mills was always very, very kind\nto me and very good-hearted. I had great respect for her.",
        "Q: So what was the first meeting like that day?",
        "A: Well, Nellie told me later on that of course she couldn\u2019t speak to me in German and I -- cause\nI was babbling away in German, and whatever she said I couldn't understand, but by my actions -\n- she knew that I was wiggling around, and that I needed a bathroom. So the first thing she do --\ndid, was to take me to the bathroom, and eventually we ended on another train which took us to\nManchester, took us north, and from Manchester we went by car to Rochdale. And Rochdale is\nwhere my guardians lived. So Nellie was the one who took me to my guardians. And was a very,\nvery lovely house, and Mr. and Mrs. Allen were very anxious to have a little girl there. It was\nonly later on that I found out their reason why they wanted to have a child in their home. It was a\nvery gracious, beautiful home. They had several cars, a Rolls Royce, and a Lady Austin, a\nprivate chauffeur, and Mr. Allen owned a bus company. In America we would call such a\ncompany like Greyhound. It was privately owned, called Yelloway. So he was the owner of this\nparticular bus company that rode buses from Manchester to London, or Manchester to Liverpool,\nlong distance bus lines. They were quite wealthy people. And the Allens have a son called\nHubert. Hubert was already grown and he was in his 20\u2019s. So he was about 25 years old when I\ncame to them. So, you know, he couldn\u2019t really be bothered with a youngster too much, but he\nwas always very kind to me. We had a very nice relationship. They told me that\u2019s my big\nbrother.",
        "Q: Do you remember -- do you remember the address where -- where their house was located?",
        "A: Yes, I do know, it was on Bent Meadows in Rochdale, and this county is called Lancashire.\nLancashire is known for linens, but ha -- the bus company was one of the big businesses in\nRochdale. Mr. Allen owned the company until after the war. It was his son who ran the Yelloway\nbus company later on.",
        "Q: And also, just to go back, do you remember the address where you lived as a child in\nHalberstadt?",
        "A: Yes, it was Halberstadt, Lilly Cohn, Vestendorf [speaks German here]. Vestendorf is the\nname of the street, it\u2019s still called Vestendorf, 34A and B. They were two houses that were\nattached, two houses in the front and two houses in the back. Yes, I do remember the address and\nI still remember the telephone number in Halberstadt. [speaks German] 26-38. But one learns it,\nyou know, in German, and that\u2019s why I said it that way, that\u2019s the way I remember it.",
        "Q: So your first impressions, arriving to this new place in England, what do you remember\u2019?",
        "A: Well, I was shown to my room, and I cried a lot. I know I cried a great deal, because I think it\nwas only then that it hit me that no one could understand me. Of course, they knew why I was\ncrying, because I was homesick and it was, I\u2019m sure, quite normal. The Allens did have my aunt\ncome to visit, because my aunt who lived in Manchester, who had a job there as a maid, sh-she\ncame to visit and of course that was very exciting for me to have someone to talk to. But very\nsoon the Allens sent me to school. And they were very smart, because they chose the convent\nhigh school in Rochdale. The convent high school was run by nuns, and these nuns were from\nGermany, so they all spoke German. It was a German order. And since no one could speak to me\nat the Allen\u2019s house, as soon as I went to school, they could speak to me, and they were very,\nvery kind to me, the nuns. And I wrote to my parents, of course, and by pa --\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "Q: This is a United States Holocaust Memorial in -- Museum interview with Lillyan Rosenberg.\nThis is tape number two, side A. So you were beginning to tell me about the school you attended,\nand your parents corresponding with the nuns, I believe, at the school?",
        "A: My parents wrote to the nuns in Rochdale, and said to them that they should please not try to\nchange my religion because my religion would be very important to me, and my parents begged\nthem to honor my background. And they did. Of course, it was a Catholic school, and every\nmorning -- they would have prayers in the morning and when children knelt to say certain\nprayers, and I know all of them, because after all, I memorized them in the name of the Father,\nand all these prayers that I know, but I would not kneel, I would sit. And no one would ever say\nanything. And eventually they actually let me have some lessons with the Father, who was\nassigned to the convent, and the Father knew Hebrew. So I had the [indecipherable] with me\nfrom Halberstadt, and the Father and I would sit in this big room with the stained glass windows,\njust he and I, and he would continue tran -- letting me translate what I was learning in\nHalberstadt. But that just lasted a little while.",
        "Q: Do you think religion was important for you at this stage, this transition as a -- as a\nyoungster? Did it help you?",
        "A: Religion was already very deeply imbedded in my life, so that I knew I was different. The\nAllens were not religious people, they just kept the big holidays like Christmas, there\u2019d be big\nparties and certain times. But they were not people who would to go a church, and I never went\nto another synagogue. I don\u2019t think there was one in Rochdale. But the nuns were very kind to\nme in many ways. For instance, when Mrs. Allen was -- Mrs. Allen was rather sickly. She had\nmental problems of depression, and sh -- at times she could not put up with a child around. I\nmight be doing something perfectly normal, what I would consider normal, playing with a ball or\nsomething, and that could upset her terribly, which I couldn't understand until many years later,\nwhen they explained to me that she was having mental problems. And that was one of the\nreasons why they thought that having a child in their home would be good therapy for her. But it\nisn\u2019t such good therapy for a child, because I couldn\u2019t understand these things. So I would either\nlive with Nellie for awhile, or I would live with the nuns. And with the nuns I would frequently\nhave religious debates at a very young age, because I knew a lot from Halberstadt, being that it\nwas a rather religious community, I was pretty well versed in the Bible, and the -- what I have\nlearned from home. So you could not change me, I was pretty -- pretty strong-willed.",
        "Q: What kind of debate would you have? Do you remember any of the specifics?",
        "A: No, I -- I don\u2019t know the specifics, but I know that I would stand my point, I would say no,\nno, no, it couldn\u2019t be that way because God did it this way, or God spoke to Moses or whatever. I\nwas pretty strong about the things that I had learned. And I never did have to participate in the\nNew Testament, only in the prayers that they had every morning. And as far as the English\nlanguage is concerned, I learned English very quickly. I would think that within four weeks, I\nwas able to understand the Allens, although I thought they spoke too quickly. But within two\nmonths I was able to do all the schoolwork, like all the others, and I was on an even level as far\nas math and other subjects were concerned. I had no difficulty in catching up with the English\nchildren. I wore the uniform of the convent, a navy blue uniform with a white collar, and a blue\nand red hat, and blue and red scarf, and I was dressed like all the other children in the convent\nand made friends there, and that seemed to be a normal life, which I became accustomed to quite\nquickly.",
        "Q: Were you the only Jewish child in the school?",
        "A: As far as I know, the only Jewish child, yes. I never met anyone Jewish while at the Allens.\nAnd I had very little contact with my family, because eventually my brother came to England,\nbut by that time the Allens really wanted to keep me away from the family, because they wanted\nme to feel that I was their little girl.",
        "Q: Well, let\u2019s go back. First of all, what\u2019s the date when you arrived to England?",
        "A: In July, 1939.",
        "Q: And when did you brother come to England?",
        "A: Approximately four or five weeks later, I got a letter from my parents saying, guess what, you\nare very, very lucky, your big brother is going to come to England. And my brother did not get\nout until just before the war started, and he got onto a boat in Holland, but he was able to make\nit. And he was not nearly as lucky as I was, because at the age of 15, he found himself alone,\nwhere I had someone to take care of me. He knew some English and was able to get around, and\nmy aunt was in Manchester, but he had a difficult time to just survive. But he got a job, and then\nanother job, and he did very well.",
        "Q: So you occasionally saw him, but not very much, it sounds like.",
        "A: The Allens did not encourage me to have any contact with my aunt or my brother, and by then\nthe war had started. And when the war started, there were no more letters from my parents,\nthough -- the contact between Germany and England, there were no mail -- there was not the\nusual mail service, was completely stopped. Eventually my parents would write to someone in\nSwitzerland who they knew, who readdressed the letters to England. So they would go from\nGermany to Switzerland, Switzerland to England. We still had letters from my parents for a year\nor two.",
        "Q: What were they writing about, do you remember\u2019?",
        "A: Every letter was a very unhappy letter. It was always, can you do something to help us get\nout. This and this person has left Germany, we can\u2019t get out. The old people were taken to a\nnursing home, so I think my grandfather was no longer living upstairs. And it must have been a\nvery desperate time. And of course they would write, why haven\u2019t you written, and can you send\nus a picture? And this is, you know, several years like that. Eventually there were Red Cross\nletters. A Red Cross letter was 25 words. 25 words from my parents, and they came like a\ntelegram, and you were allowed to write back 25 words, and it goes back to the sender. So that\nwas the only communication during the war that was official communication.",
        "Q: Now, can you give me a better description, a sense of the Allens? Could you tell me each of\ntheir first names, and -- and their personalities, even physical description.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Tell me more about them.",
        "A: Okay. Well, when I first ca-came to the Allen\u2019s house, Mr. Allen was sick at the time, so he\nwas bedridden with something, no-not on a permanent basis. But he was a very patient and kind\nman, so I spent a lot of time at his bedside, and he would teach me English. He would point to\nthe ceiling and say ceiling, I would say ceiling. He would pa -- point to the floor and say floor,\nI'd say floor. And I repeated everything that he said and then he would point again and see if I\nwould remember it. And I did fairly well. Then he went t -- he asked me to bring his wallet, I\nbrought his wallet. And he took out all kinds of change. And he said, this is a penny, that\u2019s a\nthreepenny bit, that\u2019s a sixpence, that\u2019s a shilling. And so I said, a penny, a threepence -- I\ncouldn\u2019t say threepence, that was very hard, because to put your tongue between your teeth to do\na t-h, doesn\u2019t exist in German. So I probably said tripence, but it\u2019s threepence, three pennies.\nAnd sixpence, a shilling and I think that\u2019s as high as it went. When I had it all correct, he said I\ncould keep it, it\u2019s mine. That I understood. So I thought I was very rich, I now had all this\nchange, which of course I wrote to my parents. I wrote, I have a penny, a threepence, sixpence,\nand a shilling. And my father, which I have in the first letter said, now that you are so rich, shall\nI send you the safe which we used to have? You see, we no longer had the store. He said,\nbecause you need to put all that money in a safe place. So my father\u2019s good humor always came\nthrough. But Mr. Allen was very, very kind and very patient, but he was a true businessman,\nvery, very successful. Hubert, the son, who was in his early 20\u2019s, was one who played cricket.\nHe had this cricket outfit, and at Christmastime would sing in the Christmas carols, there were all\nthese young men, they were there. They were all a lot older than I was. But he was very, very\nnice and very kind to me. He was already active in the business at Yelloway. And Mrs. Allen\nwas the typical English housewife. When I look back on the times with Mrs. Allen, she was very\nspoiled, because she had everything done for her. She had maid service all the time, she had a\nchauffeur just to take her around. And she lived -- could live very graciously, but she had\nphobias. She thought people were laughing at her. I could not understand these things, because a\nyoungster does not understand that. But she was a very kind person, and as I said, they told me to\ncall them Pop and Ma, which I did. And Hubert, who was the big brother. And I was very happy.\nIt became a new home for me. By now the war was on one year, two years, and a ve -- at one\ntime, after Mrs. Allen had been sick again and hospitalized, she got a shock me -- treatments,\nseveral times while I was there. So they told me that they would send me away. And I couldn\u2019t\nunderstand that. They said, well we did not know that the war would go on so long, and we will\nalways take care of you, and they gave me all these stories. But I was extremely upset. I think it\nwas much more upset -- maybe more upsetting for me to leave the Allens, because it was a\nsecond, complete upheaval. The first one I was well prepared for. The -- leaving the Allens I was\nnot prepared for, and I didn\u2019t have that security behind me as having parents, real parents. So\nthey sent me to Tunbridge Wells, which is in the south of England. Tunbridge Wells in the state\nof Kent. And that was a -- don\u2019t remember the exact year, but probably 1942. There was still a\nletter from my parents saying that I should not leave the Allens, please stay with the Allens, but\nthis was beyond my control.",
        "Q: Did you talk to the Allens? Did you tell them that you were unhappy? Do you remember\nconversations at the time?",
        "A: You know, this was like a fait accompli, they n -- this was it, I could not argue with anyone\nabout anything, because they made the decisions. They told me how much they loved me, and I\nhave all kinds of letters from them, how much I meant to them, and they wanted to have a child\nof their own, but I would have to be of their religion and they fou -- noticed that they could never\nchange my religion, I was probably too old and too strong for that already. And eventually I was\nsent to Tunbridge Wells.",
        "Q: What was their religion?",
        "A: Protestant. Church of England.",
        "Q: And can you tell me what -- what are both of their first names?",
        "A: Margaret was Mrs. Allen, Margaret Allen, and Herbert Allen was Mr. Allen, and Hubert, the\nson. Now, the son eventually got married, and I -- and has a d -- one daughter, and I am still in\ntouch with the whole family.",
        "Q: So you were probably with the Allens for at least a couple years, or what do you recall?",
        "A: Two to three -- two to three years, I don\u2019t know the date exactly, although in my diary it\nmight record what date I went to Tunbridge Wells. Tunbridge Wells had a school, and I presume\nthey made the arrangements through Bloomsbury House, because all the children who were\nrefugee children were sponsored through Bloomsbury House.",
        "Q: So what age are you at about this time?",
        "A: By then I was 12. 12 to 13, maybe 13 when I got to The Beacon. The Beacon was the name of\nthe school in Tunbridge Wells, and The Beacon has been a very big part of my life. Of course, I\ndidn\u2019t realize that at the time, I was unhappy getting there, but then I suppose every other child\nwho was there probably felt the same way about leaving their guardians. Cause every child who\nwas at The Beacon had a guardian somewhere. And suddenly here we were, we found ourselves\nall together. There must have been maybe 50 children or more, of different ages, who had all\ncome to England on the kindertransport. But now the war was in progress for a couple of years,\nand the guardians did not realize that they would have these children for so long, and sent them\nto this particular school, called The Beacon. They -- the children there were in age from\napproximately six to 16. When I first got there I was a junior. Later on we -- we became middles\nand then we became seniors, depending upon your age group. And we shared one large\ndormitory room together for at least 12 or more girls in one room. And we got to know each\nother very, very well. The same girls who were at The Beacon then are still my closest friends\ntoday. Some of the girls stayed in England when the war was over, and others went to different\nparts of the world. A few were fortunate enough to be reunited with their parents. Some knew\nthat their parents were alive. I was among those who were hoping that the parents were alive.\nBut, to no avail.",
        "Q: Do you think you stayed pretty optimistic throughout this time period of your life?",
        "A: Yes, I believe so. I think I have always had an optimistic nature, that\u2019s probably inherited. But\nI don\u2019t think I ever thought about not seeing my parents. I just presumed that when the war was\nover, I\u2019d find them somewhere. We did not know that they were transported to Warsaw, not until\nseveral years after the war.",
        "Q: So tell me about the physical surroundings. What -- what was the -- set the scene a little bit at\nThe Beacon.",
        "A: Well, The Beacon was an old mansion many, many years ago, and when I think about it from\nAmerica, I think of it as a huge, huge building. When I went back there for a reunion after 50\nyears, it\u2019s not as big as I thought it was, it\u2019s just an average big house. But it was a gracious\nbuilding, and there was lots of laughter and lots of -- of good fun among the girls, although we\nlived under pretty meager conditions. This was, after all, wartime. Food was rationed, and we\nhad a cook at The Beacon, her name was Mrs. Hayward. That name Hayward was important in\nmy life. Mrs. Hayward was the cook, and we had certain assignments to help. To either peel\npotatoes or help with the dishwashing. After all, there were many, many children there. The food\nwas mainly boiled fish, boiled cabbage and boiled potatoes. So you weren't really hungry,\nbecause you could eat more potatoes, and you could eat more potatoes, but it was pretty awful. I\nmean, it was very healthy food because everything was boiled. They did not have fats. You did\nnot have oil, you didn\u2019t have butter. These things were highly rationed during the war. And we\ndid not see fruit, but vegetables were growing in the area, and there were beautiful, beautiful\ngrounds attached to The Beacon, with three what we called lakes, but they were really puddles.\nWhat we thought was a lake, we took an old bedstead and thought that was a boat. We paddled\naround in that. We improvised with everything. Occasionally clothes came from America. There\nwould be a bunch of shoes, and you could try them on, and if a pair fitted you, they were yours.\nSo we had a lot of clothes like that. Schooling was at The Beacon, it was not too great. Later on\nthey sent us to a school in the town and it was called Holy Trinity. It was worse. It was really not\na good school at all. I was able to take an exam for a special high school. Like in New York we\nhave Stuyvesant High School, Bronx Science, a special school. The school would have been in\nTunbridge, we were in Tunbridge Wells. Tunbridge was maybe 10 miles away. I passed the test,\nbut then they -- the government said I was not a British subject is what they called it, so I was not\nable to go to the school, but continued at Holy Trinity, which was not much of a school. But I\nread a lot and eventually, at the age of 16, I was still there, we all had to choose a career of some\nsort. Most of the girls went in for nursing. And I said no, I didn\u2019t want to be a nurse. And how\nabout a secretarial school? I said no, I didn\u2019t think I would like that. They said, well what would\nI like to study? So I said art. So I di -- took some kind of art exam, probably drawing something\nvery basic, and I was able to go to the art school. So I went to the school of arts and crafts in\nTunbridge Wells, and loved it. We drew from the skeleton, and Michelangelo, and nude figures.\nAnd I think I did quite well, but one of the ladies from the committee who took care of The\nBeacon girls said, you have to learn a profession where you can earn money. I hadn\u2019t really\nconsidered that, seriously. So they told me that I should concentrate on dress design and\ndressmaking, and they did teach that at the school, at the art school. So I learned how to draw\ndresses and how to make patterns, very basic patterns. And I took an exam while at the school of\narts and crafts for the [indecipherable] of London, and I got a degree in fashion at the time. I was\nstill very young, and enjoyed doing that. However, after about two years at the school, they said\nyou now have to take a job and earn money. And that\u2019s rather difficult in the fashion field,\nespecially when you have no background. So one of the ladies from the committee of The\nBeacon in Tunbridge Wells had dresses made at a very fancy couturier shop in London called\nJaquemar. So I had -- they told me I would have a -- get a job at Jaquemar in London. And my\nbrother lived in London by that time, so that was a very good thing for both of us, because that --\nfrom that time on, my brother and I were always in touch, I think we saw each other daily.",
        "Q: Now, just to go back, when you arrived to The Beacon, were most of the other girls at the\nschool Jewish?",
        "A: All the children were Jewish, all the children were refugee children like myself, and they all\nhad different stories to tell. Some were with very good guardians and some were not. So we --\nwe knew all about each other, we were like a group of sisters, and I would say we still are. Half\nof them now live in England, and ha -- maybe half in America, and a few are in different parts of\nthe world. But th -- all the children had a similar background. Now, the interesting part is that I\nhad a friend in New York, her name at The Beacon was Sylvia Balbera. Her married name was\nSchneider, Sylvia Schneider. And she lived in New York until last year, she passed away. If you\nasked Sylvia about the years at The Beacon, she would give you a completely different story\nabout how dreadful it was, not only the food, but the way we were dressed, and that nobody\nloved us, and nobody cared. And yet, I look at the same years as saying they were productive.\nThey made us realize what is important in life and what is not so important in life. Cause we had\nnext to nothing, and yet we had each other. I think it taught us a great deal about the values of\nwhat is important and what isn\u2019t important.",
        "Q: Did you also feel more comfortable being around Jewish friends again? Did that make a\ndifference to you at the time?",
        "A: I think it gave all of us a certain comfort knowing, for instance, on a Friday night we could\nhave prayers over the bread and wine, and basic things that I remembered from home. I think I\nwas pretty much the leader. They said I was very much of a leader type person. When the s-\nsuperior there said that to me, I didn\u2019t know what she was talking about, but in life she was\nactually quite correct.",
        "Q: So, while you were at The Beacon, what did you have to -- you -- you started to talk about\nhow you eventually learned you needed to make money, but while you were still studying at The\nBeacon, what -- how were you taken care of in terms of money? Were the Allens sending you\nmoney, and -- and what did you need in those days in terms of money?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember receiving money from the Allens, although I visited them, I would say,\nabout twice a year. I would go to get to London -- you had to get pol -- permission from the\npolice department that you were leaving your residence, since we were known as enemy aliens\nall during the war. All the children were enemy aliens, cause we were not British subjects. But\nthat was not difficult, to get the permit to go. So I would go to London and from London I would\nget on one of their buses, to go to Rochdale, to go to Manchester, and from Manchester to\nRochdale. And most of the drivers knew me from the time I was a little girl. So I did visit the\nAllens on a somewhat regular basis, and they always wrote to me. But now The Beacon really\nwas our home. The one thing I need to mention is that when I was told that I need to have a job\nin London, Mrs. Hayward, who was the cook, had her son and daughter-in-law as visitors most\nweekends. And they came there by bicycle from London with a young couple, to stay with her\nbecause there was a lot of bombing going on. This was the height of the war, and the\ndoodlebugs, which are one kind of bomb, would come over the area of Tunbridge Wells, and\nthey had balloon barrages up to prevent the planes from reaching London. However, this couple,\nHayward, Alec Hayward -- Alec Hayward, right, and Agnes, would come to Tunbridge Wells\nmost weekends. And Alec was an artist. So he and I would do some sketching together. We\nwould draw The Beacon, or we would draw a tree, or whatever, and I got to know this couple\nquite well. So Mr. Hayward, this is the young Mr. Hayward, said to me, where are you going to\nlive when you go to London? And I said I don\u2019t know yet. I did not know. So he said, well if you\nwould like, you can live with us because we have a small house in West Wickham, which is just\noutside of London, and we have an extra bedroom, and if you like you can stay with us. And that\nis what I did, I then lived with the Haywards in London. I did not make enough money to pay for\nthe train fare, and I paid a little bit to the Haywards for room and board, it wasn\u2019t very much. But\nthe Bloomsbury House helped out at that point. So Bloomsbury House paid the ou -- the\nHaywards something towards my keep. And I earned 35 shillings at Jaquemar, and I learned the\ndress trade from the bottom up. I started by picking up the pins off the floor with a magnet, and\nthen they let me put in some basting threads, and take out basting threads. I was allowed to do\nlittle things, but gradually I learned more and more. And in England one learned a profession by\nbeing an apprentice. It\u2019s not necessarily a school. At the school I had learned the pattern making\nand design part of it, but --\nEnd of Tape Two, Side A\nBeginning Tape Two, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Lillyan\nRosenberg. This is tape number two, side B. I wanted to just go back a little bit and ask you --\nback to your childhood memories in your hometown of Halberstadt, can you tell me -- I know\nyou mentioned a little bit about going to synagogue, but in the home, what are some of the\nfavorite holidays that you remember? Do you have vivid memories of holidays at home?",
        "A: Oh absolutely. The holidays were really celebrated and we looked forward to them. The dress\nwould be made for what to wear on a high holiday such as Rosh Hashanah or Yom Kippur.\nCourse, a child is growing all the time, but it was a very festive time for any of the high holidays.\nBut every Shabbat was a high holiday in my parent\u2019s home because Shabbat is every week, and\neverybody would get dressed accordingly, and even the photo that I have, the men are wearing\nties, including my brother, and I would be asked to sing a certain song, which 1s from the fr --\nprayer after meals [indecipherable] and I would sing that on a Friday night, and that was\nentertainment for my parents. But holidays were always celebrated, whether it was Purim, where\nchildren get dressed accordingly and have these Purim parties, the story of [indecipherable]. I\nremember all these things from Halberstadt days, it\u2019s a long time ago.",
        "Q: And you remember Passovers as well?",
        "A: Passover, my mother would start a week before, getting out the new dishes, the other dishes\nthat would be used only for Passover. They were white with just a navy blue frame and a little\ngold around. They would just be used for Passover. And I remember my grandfather, Opa, going\naround the house with a feather, and going into the corners to see if there\u2019s a crumb anywhere.\nThese are childhood memories from way back, and I\u2019m surprised that after 70 - something years\nI still remember such little details. But the holidays were really something to look forward to.\nThe various holidays, the Simchas Torah, where children get candies in the synagogue, and\nwe\u2019re allowed to come downstairs to be where the men are, which was a big treat. And that same\nsynagogue today has just one wall left, but they\u2019re picking up the pieces and trying to reconstruct\nwhatever they can of the synagogue the way the original synagogue was.",
        "Q: And I think you mentioned this in one of your other -- excuse me -- interviews, but I was\ncurious, could you tell me a little bit about what your parents maybe said to you about being\nJewish. Did you feel special, did you feel different in some way?",
        "A: We were always told that we are special, and I grew up feeling that way. There\u2019s no way\nanyone could have changed my religion, even though I was just a little over 10 years old when I\nleft my parent\u2019s home. But I knew that that was a very important part of my life, and I also knew\nthat I would never marry anyone who was not Jewish, because I could not bring up children in\nany other faith. It was already deeply imbedded in -- as part of my life.",
        "Q: And what about -- I believe you wore the Star of David around your neck and can you tell me\nwhat happened when you moved to England?",
        "A: [had this little Star of David, Mogen Dovid in silver, silver filigree, it\u2019s quite small,\ninsignificant, on a silver chain. And I wore it when I left my parent\u2019s home, when I left\nHalberstadt to go to England. Of course, when I started going to the convent high school, was the\nname of the convent I went to where my guardians sent me, they of course realized that the\nMogen Dovid was not appropriate to go to a Catholic school. So I was told then that I could not\nwear it at all, and I never did, but I always kept the Mogen Dovid. So I had it for years and years.\nWhenever I would look at it, it brought back memories, of course. Many years later, it would\nnow be 19 years ago, our son Steven got married to Susan, Susan Soto. Susan was not born\nJewish, but she became Jewish before Miranda their daughter was born. So when j -- when Susan\nconverted to Judaism, and that is in Florida, I don\u2019t know the exact year, but it is 19 years ago,\nSusan went into the ocean with her husband, our son Steven, because there was no mikvah in\nPalm Beach, so the rabbi was there at the ocean with Susan, who was pregnant with their\ndaughter Miranda, and Steven said, you know, my wife is pregnant, I can\u2019t put her in any further.\nAnd the rabbi said further, she has to go down more. She had just had her hair done for the\nwedding. Said further, she has to go down further. And Susan went to the so-called mikvah in the\nocean, she was converted to Judaism, and Susan received the Mogen Dovid, which I was not\nallowed to wear as a child. And Susan has the Mogen Dovid very proudly, and will pass it on to\nMiranda one day.",
        "Q: That\u2019s so nice. So, now when you are at The Beacon -- I know that\u2019s where we left off, with\nyou at The Beacon, and I wanted to just try to establish, what were some of the other kinds of\nchanges. You told me about the air raids, I believe, or maybe you might want to speak a little\nmore about that, but what other changes since the war had started, how -- how were things\nchanging with -- with the war going on?",
        "A: The war was a very difficult time for everyone in England. In London they had the major air\nraids, where huge areas were bombed. But Tunbridge Wells was in direct line from Germany via\nTunbridge Wells, to London. So the bombs and the planes, which were called doodlebugs -- they\ndidn\u2019t have pilots, 1t was just a plane with a bomb that would come over. In the area of\nTunbridge Wells and surrounding farm country, they put up these huge lines on different levels,\nand balloons, this cal -- they were called balloon barrage, hoping that they would entangle the\nflight of any one of these planes so that they would not reach London. And indeed, quite a few f -\n- fl -- planes were intercepted. Another thing which was typical of a doodlebug is that it would\ngo so many miles and we would hear this droning voi -- noise. You knew what it was, but when\nthe noise stopped, that\u2019s when the agony went off in all of us, because we didn -- it was coming\ndown, but we didn\u2019t know where it would come down and explode. It was really meant to go\nanother 35 miles to London from where we were. But the way of life for everybody was very\ndifficult. We had the air raids at night or during the day and people would rush into shelters. And\nthe food was rationed so that it was very minimal, what everyone received. But being at The\nBeacon, the food was less than minimal. They did not give us, I think, what we were entitled to,\nwhich was maybe one egg a month, because I don\u2019t remember ever, ever eating an egg, or ever\nseeing fresh fruit like an orange or banana. I did not see those things all the war years, not until I\ncame to America.",
        "Q: And what about the correspondence with your parents? If you can sort of characterize what\nthat correspondence was like through this time period. We talked a little bit about, I think, the\nearly days with the Allens --",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: -- but going from the Allens to The Beacon, and when you heard from them, and then when\nyou didn\u2019t hear from them.",
        "A: There was very, very little information for my parents. The letters dwindled because they\nwere still sending them to Switzerland, and they would be forwarded to my brother or my aunt,\nand then eventually they would come to me. The letters were always sad, it was always we are\ntrying to get out, we are trying to get by. And my mother would use the phrase very often lorg\nzundt, only -- only good health. In other words, she was hoping that they would stay healthy. I\nknow that because I donated all the letters from my parents, the originals, to the museum in\nWashington, D.C., and -- except for the first and last letter, which we kept. My daughter-in-law\nin Florida has the first and last letters. The first one was particularly meaningful to me, and the\nlast letter from my parents said we have to be at the dorm in Halberstadt -- the dorm being the\nbig church in the center of th -- of town, at something like five o\u2019clock in the morning, or\nsomething -- something very early, and we may take with us only a rucksack. And I understand\nthat all the Jews assembled there, and that was in the last letter from my parents. They had to\nthen give up their keys, their house keys, and they were deported. This was all unknown to us\nbecause my brother and I were in England and we only heard about that later on, after the war,\nand from the little museum in Halberstadt, and they have the information from some of the\nsoldiers in Halberstadt, and that is how they received the names of all the people who were\ndeported. But you know, the Germans were very accurate about their recordkeeping, so they\nhave records of names and so forth, and that is all recorded now on that monument in\nHalberstadt.",
        "Q: When did that last letter come to you?",
        "A: I believe it was in 1942. And then from where they went we never heard. Maybe there was a\nRed Cross letter, but I\u2019m really not sure. I\u2019m only aware of this particular letter from my parents.\nAnd we were hoping that when the war was over, we would find them maybe in Russia, in\nSiberia, or someplace, but it never happened.",
        "Q: Did you -- did they seem to know at all where they were going to be sent, in that letter?",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so. I don\u2019t think they knew where they were going. They just wrote that they all\nhave to be there early in the morning and that was the fine -- the last letter that I have. So the --\nthose two letters are in -- with our son and daughter-in-law in Florida. All the other letters are in\nWashington, D.C., and wis -- the y-young lady in Germany, Jutta Dick, who runs that little\nmuseum, called Moses Mendelssohn academy, she asked for copies of all those letters, and\nreceived them with my okay. So she has the details of all of these letters, which I never read\nagain.",
        "Q: Never?",
        "A: Never, no. Only the first and the last. So, I did not want to read all those letters. I found them\nto be very depressing, and it was a subject that in our home, we just did not discuss.",
        "Q: And what -- what about keeping your diary? Did you continue writing in the diary when you\nwere at the Allen\u2019s and at The Beacon? What do you -- what do you remember about the diary?",
        "A: The diary, which was started in German, for a long time all the writing was in German, in\ngreen ink, and then it continued later on in blue, I believe, ink, and a completely different\nhandwriting. You would not think it was the same person, and now it\u2019s in English. And very\npositive, that was at the time I was at The Beacon already, when I wrote just a few more pages in\nvery good English and a completely different attitude, a much more positive attitude.",
        "Q: And also at The Beacon, were you interested in boys at this time of your life?",
        "A: Oh, we had a lot of fun with the local boys, we really did. The Beacon girls were very popular\nwith the neighborhood village boys. The Beacon being rather an isolated building on a hill, the\narea is called Rusthall in Tunbridge Wells, and it\u2019s still called The Beacon. It is now like a pub,\nand a bed and breakfast both. So it\u2019s well taken care of by a young couple at this time, because\nafter our reunion of children being in England for 50 years, we went onto The Beacon, and\nvisited The Beacon. And at that time some of the village boys were invited to come over. These\nvillage boys are now in their fi -- 60\u2019s, but we knew them as kids. And they would come and\nvisit us by climbing through the basement window, which was ground level. And when we heard\na matron coming down the stairs, they would jump out of the window and disappear. So we had\na very good, but very innocent time.",
        "Q: Okay, so now I think we\u2019re caught up, and we were last talking about The Beacon and your\ntransition from there to London. Do you know when that was, and maybe now you want to just\nstart over and talk about living with the Haywards, I believe.",
        "A: I believe the year would have been 1946 approximately, because I was now out of the school\nof arts and crafts in Tunbridge Wells, and had to take a job in London. And the young Mr.\nHayward, who was this artist, said to me, would I like to live with them -- of course with the\nokay of his young wife. And I didn't know where I was going to live, so that sounded fine to me.\nThey said they would live -- they were living in the vicinity of London, a little on the outskirts.\nSo then I started my job in London at Jaquemar, this very, very fancy dress house, which gave\nme a very, very good background in basic knowledge of dressmaking, which came in extremely\nuseful later on in my life.",
        "Q: So this was -- this was actually already after the war, or is this while the war is still going on?\nCause you --",
        "A: The war was -- the war was still going on, yes.",
        "Q: Okay, so probably not \u201946, so it must have been earlier.",
        "A: Maybe fort -- \u201945 to \u201946 that I stayed with the -- with the Haywards. I don\u2019t know the exact\ndate any more, but I was with them when the war ended, so I was still going to work in London,\nand being that I was working in London at Jaquemar, my brother was also working in London,\nnot too far away, and we would le -- meet at lunchtime, and we would meet at a restaurant called\nLions, Lions Corner House, and my brother would always pay for my lunches. I really d --\nearned very, very little money. It wasn\u2019t even enough to pay for the train fare and staying with\nthe Haywards. But the Haywards had a very positive influence upon my life. For instance, I had\nhad piano lessons in Germany, and they felt that I should continue with my knowledge of music,\nand made arrangements for me to have piano lessons every week, which I did, and I went to high\ns -- to further my education in art, I went to an art school at night. So I would work during the\nday, commute, and then go to an evening art school. So they really influenced my life in\ncontinuing my education, and I was very happy staying with them. They were not at all wealthy.\nThey bought me a men\u2019s bike. I know because it had the bar in between, and we used to visit The\nBeacon, now from London, and we used to bicycle there. It was 35 miles each way. And Alec\nand his wife Agnes had a tandem and I had the single men\u2019s bike. So they were slow going\nuphill, where I would be ahead of them and going downhill they would be much faster. And 35\nmiles in one direction is quite a good trip, but we did this quite regularly and it helped me in\nhaving very strong legs to this day.",
        "Q: And that\u2019s still while the war was going on?",
        "A: Yes, the war was still going on, and when the war was over, I was still with the Haywards on\nthe outskirts of London. And I must say one day when I was supposed to take the train after work\nfrom Charing Cross to West Wickham where they lived, I missed the train, which could happen\nwhen you work in London. And that train was hit by a bomb, and they thought I was on it. And I\nguess the good lord felt that I wa -- he wasn\u2019t ready for me, so here I was saved once more, and it\nwas the train that I had taken on a regular basis, and that day I missed it, the train.",
        "Q: And that\u2019s before the war ended?",
        "A: That was before the war ended, yes, and I was still with the Haywards.",
        "Q: Did these sorts of things scare you at the time, or did you take them in stride in a certain way?",
        "A: When you live in London during the war, you just never knew where the bomb would go off,\nor when a doodlebug stopped whether it would hit you, or the house next door, or -- 1t would be\nnearby, but you were just lucky if you made it. And we spent many, many nights in the air raid\nshelter. The Haywards had a shelter in their home, in the hallway. It was about the size of a ten --\nping pong table, but out of iron, and you would sleep under that ping pong table the moment the\nair raid siren went off. And it was routine. That could be daytime or nighttime. Of course,\neverything was a blackout at all times. No lights from the outside, you could not see which house\nhad a light on. And they had air raid wardens walking around, checking each of the houses. It\nwas a way of life. And in London, many people just bedded down in the underground, which is\nthe subway system. They had bunks, one on top of the other, and parents, rather than dragging\ntheir children out in the middle of the night, would just put them to bed in the subway. And they\nwould be there every night, occupying these beds. There were hundreds and hundreds of them.",
        "Q: But still, you somehow weren\u2019t terribly frightened, it sounds like.",
        "A: Yeah -- no, I think I took the life pretty much in stride, like that\u2019s the way it\u2019s meant to be.\nAnd I think even to this day, we are planning to go to Israel next week, and it\u2019s not a very safe\ntime, since we just got over this war maybe two weeks ago. And I feel whenever the hot time is\nto go, that\u2019s it. Meantime, I\u2019m positive about living -- about living every day to the fullest.",
        "Q: So what do you remember about the war coming to an end?",
        "A: I remember the huge celebrations in London, but I was not in -- in the center of town then.\nMy only recollection is really that my brother said to me, it is time for us to go to America. Our\nparents said that we will meet them again in America. And we were still hoping that there would\nbe a sign of our parents somewhere. We thought because of lack of communication during the\nwhole war, that maybe they were hiding somewhere. Maybe in Russia or Poland, or somewhere.\nWe did not know. But we were not fortunate. However, many of The Beacon girls were reunited\nwith their parents. Some in America, some in Australia, and different parts of the world.",
        "Q: How did you feel about the possibility at this stage, going to America?",
        "A: By now I felt very English. I really didn\u2019t want to leave England. But my brother had this\nattitude of being responsible for me, and he said, this 1s what our parents wanted, and that\u2019s what\nwe\u2019re going to do. He really did not give me a choice. I was about 18 by now, and he said, this is\nwhat my par -- our parent\u2019s wishes were, and we\u2019re able to go because now the quota number\nhad come to pass. In other words, we are entitled to go. And my uncle who was in New York had\ngiven us the appropriate visa and my brother made the arrangements for us to go, and I believe\nthat Bloomsbury House paid for part of the voyage by boat to come to America.",
        "Q: When did you leave for the U.S.?",
        "A: It was in 1946, that I came to America. I came on a ship called the Drakninghome, and fell in\nlove on the ship with a man from Canada, which sounded very, very far away from New York.\nBut he was much older than I, but it was sort of a quick romance, but that\u2019s as far as it went.",
        "Q: What was his name?",
        "A: Bill, yes. And my husband when he heard about Bill, and that Bill was coming to visit me,\nwas very upset.",
        "Q: So you remember the journey fondly, going to America?",
        "A: Yes, the journey was a very happy crossing for me, it was a very broadening experience to\nsay the least, however I was still listening to my mother, which I learned later on what that was\nall about. The journey though, was a very happy one and we finally reached New York, and my\nbrother was here to greet me, he came before I did, and an aunt of mine were at the ship when I\narrived. And I spent the first couple of days at my uncle\u2019s house in Washington Heights. The\nuncle is my mother\u2019s brother, Hans Marcuza. Hans Marcuza was married not too long, and had a\nlittle girl called Barbara. So now I met my first cousin for the first time, and she was just a\ncouple of months old.",
        "Q: What were your very first impressions coming into New York?",
        "A: I was not too pleased. My brother was showing me the skyscrapers and the Hudson and\nsaying how wonderful and how beautiful, but I was used to a simple life in Tunbridge Wells,\nreally the -- a country life, and I found all the brick and stone and the masses of people\noverwhelming.",
        "Q: After that, how did you assimilate and adjust to being a new immigrant here?",
        "A: I soon realized that I could not stay with my uncle too long. I think I stayed with him at the\nmost for two weeks. At the time there was a newspaper in New York, and I believe it is still in\nexistence, called Aufbau, A-u-f-b-a-u. The Aufbau also played a role in my life. First day I found\na furnished room in Washington Heights, which cost five dollars a week. So, it was a walk-up\napartment and I just had this tiny little room there on 180\" Street, with a family. And of course, I\nneeded to look for a job. So I went to an unemployment agency, the regular U.S. unemployment\nagency, and there was a very nice gentleman there who was sort of fascinated by my\nbackground, which I did not find particularly fascinating at all. And he helped me to get my first\njob in sketching bridal gowns. S -- my first job was on 85\" Street, very near the mu --\nMetropolitan Museum of Art. And people would explain to me what they want, a dress with lots\nof buttons down the back and puffed sleeves or whatever, and I would sketch it. And I was a\npretty good sketcher, and I had a -- quite a nice background from the school of art in -- in\nTunbridge Wells. And there was a showroom and people who would make the dresses, but my\nparticular job was to sketch. Later on I would get a second job, and a third job, and each one was\nan improvement over the job I had before. I always earned more money, and I did quite well\nmoney-wise. I know I started with 35 dollars a week, and my brother and I thought that that was\nincredible. We thought we were so well-to-do. At that time I guess it was not too bad, because\nmy room was only five dollars, so we did fine. And my brother and I saw each other regularly.\nHe also took a furnished room in Washington Heights, we were near each other. And we were\nalways very, very close in our loving each other, and -- but my brother felt responsible for me.\nAnd it wasn\u2019t too much longer, when I visited my other uncle, Dr. Friedel Lusch, he was a\ngynecologist in New York, on 92 Street and Columbus Avenue. And I went to visit Friedel\nLusch, Uncle Friedel, and there were other people there, a Mrs. Lowenstein and her daughter,\nand a young man, and this young man was Jerry. I thought he might be the husband of the other\nyoung woman, turned out that that was his first cousin, and that was the aunt he lived with when\nhe came to America, also on the kindertransport. And that\u2019s where I first met my husband Jerry,\nand I was only here maybe a month or not much more and Jerry has not left me out of his sight\nfrom then until today, and we are married 58 years.",
        "Q: What year did you get married?",
        "A: We met in \u00b046, got married in \u201948, had our first child in fi --\nEnd of Tape Two, Side B\nBeginning Tape Three, Side A",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Lillyan\nRosenberg. This is tape number three, side A. As you were saying before, a lot of things were\nhappening to you in your first years in the U.S., right?",
        "A: I came to the United States in 1946, and that is when I met my husband-to-be, Jerry. And in\n1948 we got married. In 1950 we had our first son, Steven, and in 1952 we had our second son,\nRalph. So every two years, an important event happened 1n our lives.",
        "Q: So it sounds like you adjusted pretty well to your new life in the U.S.. Would you say so?",
        "A: I got used to life in America quite quickly, even though my first impulse was not so\nenthusiastic, I got used to the life here, which is of course, much more pleasant than the life that I\nhad been accustomed to in England for all the war years. I had never seen such an abundance of\nfruit and flowers, and wealth that I had seen here, because we grew up in a very modest way,\nwhich I\u2019m not too sorry about because I believe it has given us a different perspective in life,\nknowing what is an important thing in life, and what isn\u2019t. And it\u2019s not the wealth.",
        "Q: So at this stage of your life, would you have felt more German, or more British in your sort of\nnational identity or -- or background, if you will.",
        "A: I never really felt German any more after I lived in England, I got very used to living in\nEngland and would have rather stayed there, but my brother insisted upon coming here.\nHowever, once I met my husband and we were married, I was able to become an American\ncitizen because my husband was in the American army during the war, and I became a citizen\nwithin the first year of our marriage, and I would not change that for anything 1n the world.",
        "Q: Can you tell me about the reunion I think you had, back in England at The Beacon?",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember the exact year, but after 50 years of children coming to England on the\nkindertransport, Bertha Leverton wrote t -- an article in some newspaper, saying she is looking\nfor contributions of letters from youngsters who came to England on the kindertransport, and she\nput together a book. The book is called, \u201cI Came Alone\u201d and it has stories of at least 300 children\nwithin that book. And sh -- then she decided that we should give some sort of acknowledgement\nand thanks to England for having brought us to England for our safety, because without that,\nnone of us would have survived, or maybe very few. But this way, whether we were happy or\nnot, cause some children were and some were not, I was among the luckier ones, but some\nchildren while they were in England were used as maids, some were used as sex objects, they\nwere not all very lucky, and -- with the choice of their guardians. But I got accustomed to living\nin America a -- quite quickly, and that has become our way of life, and of course our children are\nborn in New York, and they don\u2019t know anything else.",
        "Q: And how did it feel to go back to this reunion? Was it emotional for you?",
        "A: It was emotional for many of us, because it brought back things that we would just as soon\nnot think about. Everybody was talking about their past, they had groups together who lived in\ndifferent parts of England so that they would have a chance to meet again. And people came\nfrom different parts of the world to this particular reunion in London. And that was the beginning\nof other chapters of the kindertransport starting up. There is an organization in New York called\nkindertransport link, I believe. They have a newsletter for all the people who were children who\ncame to the New York area. But that happened also in California and in Florida. So they have\ndifferent groups of people getting together on a regular basis, who were all children who came to\nEngland with the kindertransport.",
        "Q: And when you were back in England for this reunion, did you go to The Beacon?",
        "A: We did. Those of us who were there from The Beacon, that might have been about 12 or 15\nBeacon girls and their husbands, because now, most people were married and with children at\nthis ti -- point. So, many husbands came along, and we all visited The Beacon for one day. It was\nclosed to the public, and of course it was written up in many newspapers. But The Beacon still\nexists, and it brought back a lot of memories, because that which are now elegant dining rooms\nwith tables and white tablecloths, and very, very pretty, and a beautiful setting, that was our\ndormitory, that was our room, and that\u2019s where the Rusthall boys came to visit us. So it brought\nback a lot of memories.",
        "Q: How many girls in total were at The Beacon when you were there, do you know\napproximately?",
        "A: At least 50, in different -- different ages, and they were divided up into junior, middles and\nseniors. I started as a middle and ended as a senior.",
        "Q: Now, when you arrived to the U.S., were you still hopeful that you would find your parents,\nor hear from your parents?",
        "A: By the time I got to the U.S., there was little hope, because we had not heard anything. But\nwe heard from s -- some people -- I mentioned the name Ruth Lindheimer in Halberstadt, the girl\nI went to school with, she was in England also with the kindertransport, but her father was in\nNew York, and he was in the American army, he served in the war. And Ruth\u2019s father knew of\nother people from Halberstadt who are also living in New York, so he had some contact with\nother people. And they somehow received a list which was published in the Aufbau newspaper.\nAnd in that list, which a soldier had on him, the soldier had the list of these people, an American\nsoldier, I believe, and he gave it to the Aufbau, the Aufbau published it. It had the names of all\nthe people who were transported to Warsaw, which we did not know, we never really knew\nwhere they were transported to.",
        "Q: So this is the first concrete information --",
        "A: Mm-hm, right.",
        "Q: -- and then, did you know where they may have gone, or -- when did you find out anything\nelse, or did you find out?",
        "A: [indecipherable]. We actually never found out anything else. We don\u2019t know a specific date\nwhen they were possibly killed, but we just don\u2019t know. All we know is the monument which 1s\nin Halberstadt at the dome where all the Jewish people had to assemble to be deported, and it has\nthe date of birth, and it doesn\u2019t have a date of death.",
        "Q: And so it sounds like that transport, did anyone ever find out if that transport when to\nAuschwitz, or it went somewhere else?",
        "A: Went to Warsaw. It went to Warsaw, they all went to Warsaw, that\u2019s all we know. What -- we\n-- we don\u2019t know any details after that and I don\u2019t think that there were even any Red Cross\nletters, any more from the camp. But in my -- the last letter from parents, they wrote that Oma in\nStargard, the -- that\u2019s the other grandmother, and her daughter, were also deported to Poland, but\nwe don\u2019t know any details. We also don\u2019t know what happened to Opa in Halberstadt, the one\nwho lived above us. I believe he was sent to like a nursing home, but we were trying to find his\ngrave when we were there a few years ago, and we could not find it. We found the grave of his\nwife, Zelma Cohn, and it\u2019s in the Jewish cemetery in Halberstadt. It\u2019s written in Hebrew, and a\nrabbi, a present rabbi from Berlin made a rubbing of the gravestone and sent us the translation,\nwhich was really quite warm and heartwarming. So that was Zelma Cohn, born Lusch. And that\ngravestone is there in Halberstadt, but we could not find Opa, Hugo Cohn, we don\u2019t know where\nhe was buried.",
        "Q: But your grandmother, when did she pass away?",
        "A: When I was about two or three years old. So that was a normal burial.",
        "Q: So was there any point at which it really sank in for you that you wouldn\u2019t see your parents\nagain, and when was that?",
        "A: There wasn\u2019t really any one particular day or one particular time. The only thing that we\nknow concrete is the list of names that they were deported. So we know they were there, and we\nknow very few survivors came from Warsaw. We just never heard.",
        "Q: And so the last time that you saw them was at that train station?",
        "A: Mm-hm, yes. The last picture I have is the picture in Halberstadt on the day that I departed on\nthe kindertransport. And my parents came with me until Hanover, where the actual train, which\nwas a locked train, they just took the children for the transport, no parents were allowed on the\nplatform at that time.",
        "Q: Now this photo, plus I know other photos are items that you\u2019ve been able to hold onto for the\nrest of your life.",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: Can you tell me, just about the photos right now, how it is that you managed to do that, and\nthat one photo from the train station, did you have that throughout, or was that sent to you at\nsome point?",
        "A: My parents sent it to England just as soon as I got there. They sent it to the Allens, and I left\nGermany with a considerable number of old photographs, family photographs. They have been\ncopied and reproduced, and a -- the copies are in the little museum in Halberstadt at the Moses\nMendelssohn academy. But I have the originals right here.",
        "Q: And so you probably always felt that it was very important to -- to hold onto these\nphotographs. Did you feel that from a very young age already?",
        "A: Yes, I always felt that that is my heritage, that these were the most precious things to me, and\nthese are items that cannot be reproduced, I mean, if I would lose them. And I thought I did this\nyear, because I had the young lady from Halberstadt visiting us here in New York, we were\nsitting at this same table in our apartment, and we went through my history and so forth. And\nwhen she left, I was looking for the family album, and I couldn't find it. So I called Germany\nfrantically, and yes indeed, she took the whole album, with all these original pictures, and I was\nvery, very upset, and told her so, but she said, well I needed to make copies of them, and how\nelse could I make copies? She took the whole book, and I\u2019m glad to say, it\u2019s back in my hands.",
        "Q: And what other objects -- when you did come to the U.S., what other objects from -- from\nyour past did you bring with you at that time?",
        "A: The diary which we referred to before, I forgot that I had that, and it showed up quite\nunexpectedly about -- what it\u2019s -- 1987, that\u2019s many, many years after we -- I was in America, I\ncame over in about \u00b046, I came to America. So until \u201987, we moved into the present apartment\nwhere we are, and by -- in the move, I came across this diary, which I had forgotten that I had,\nand I though to myself, oh gee, if my children ever see this old book, and the hat I wore when I\nleft my parents on the day I came to England, I kept the diary and the hat. Why, I don\u2019t know.\nAnd I showed it to our children on a particular Passover when the whole family was together, I\nsaid, \u201cI came across these items and someday you\u2019re going to say, why did my mother keep this\nold hat?\u201d I said, \u201cWell that\u2019s the hat I wore when I left Germany.\u201d And I donated that hat to the\nmuseum in Washington, D.C.. I understand it\u2019s on show there with the picture of my wearing the\nhat.",
        "Q: And were you surprised when you re-read your diary? Was there anything in there that\nsurprised you, or you hadn\u2019t remembered?",
        "A: Yes, I am not one to go back over old letters or old things too happily, because it sometimes\nbrings back unhappy memories. So I would just as soon not really read the old letters, but one\nday I translated the whole diary into English, because if my children wanted to know what it was\nin that diary, they wouldn\u2019t understand the German. So I translated it page for page, and marked\neach page with the number where you can find it in the actual diary.",
        "Q: Was that a difficult process for you?",
        "A: Well, the English and German is not a problem for me because both languages are identical. I\nhave no problems speaking either one, but emotionally it brings back things that I\u2019d just as soon\nnot think about.",
        "Q: Do you think that\u2019s helped you in a way, not to dwell on the memories, the bad -- the -- the\ndifficult memories?",
        "A: I believe so. I don\u2019t believe in dwelling on difficult or bad times. I would rather think about\nthe positive, but that\u2019s the way I am, it\u2019s the -- my nature.",
        "Q: And what about with your children? Did you talk much about your experiences as a youngster\nwith your children?",
        "A: No, didn\u2019t talk about it at all. Our children were born in New York. We lived in a small house\nin Middle Village, and they grew up with all the other neighborhood American children. Went to\nschool at the public school in -- in the park, very close to home. And actually the conversation\nnever came up, even though my husband and I both speak German fluently, we really did not use\nthe German language. My husband was also born in Germany, he was born in Gottingen, but at\nhome we just spoke English, with one exception. When Jerry\u2019s mother, my husband\u2019s mother\ncame to America after the war and I met her, she didn't speak English, she would speak German.\nAnd I always understood it, but I hadn\u2019t used the language for so many years in England. So she\nwould say well, why don\u2019t you answer me in German? And I really hesitated to speak German,\nbut the more she insisted and the more she spoke German, I understood everything, and\neventually I would speak to her, so the children would hear a little German here and there, when\n-- you know, when the grandmother came to visit, which was every weekend. But my husband\nand I only speak English at home. But a ga -- regarding whether we spoke about our childhood\nand kindertransport, I didn\u2019t. I don\u2019t think the children were even aware of any of this, except\nthat we visited the Allens with the children when they were about five and six years old, we went\nto England and visited the Allens, who were, of course, very, very proud to have me back and to\nsee our children, and they were very, very kind to us. And at one time they came to America and\nvisited us in our little house in Middle Village. So there was always this connection, and I told\nyou that I am still in touch with the granddaughter, very much so. And just a year ago the\ngranddaughter, with her seven children, came to visit our son in Connecticut, and then to our\nhouse. So it\u2019s like part of my life is definitely in England.",
        "Q: Why do you think you didn\u2019t talk much about this, or at all, with your own children?",
        "A: I don\u2019t know that it was deliberate, except for the fact that I wanted the children to have a\nvery happy childhood, and I didn't believe in burdening them with anything that was an\nunpleasant past. But the time did come when they started posing questions. And the first question\nI remember, the boys are only 14 months apart in age, one of them saying at Thanksgiving time,\nthey were now in public school, saying, everybody is going to their grandmother\u2019s and\ngrandfather\u2019s house, why don\u2019t we have grandparents? So now the question came from the\nchildren, and I told them in short that there was this bad man in Germany, and because of that I\ncame to England, and I said, you know, Pop and Ma in England, and of course they did, because\nthey had visited and they knew them very well by now. And I said, well that\u2019s why I came to\nEngland. But I would make it very short, I never dwelt on it, and neither did my husband. It was\njust, when they asked a question they got a real answer, but we never talked much about politics,\nwe just wanted them to have a happy childhood.",
        "Q: So now if you would tell me about what happened with the other items, this sort of surprise\nphone call that you received, other items that wound up being -- belonging to your family, and\nthat you didn\u2019t even know about.",
        "A: All right. Well, it\u2019s just a -- a little over a year ago, in 2005, and we\u2019re now in 2006, I\nreceived a phone call from this woman in Halberstadt, Jutta Dick at the Moses Mendelssohn\nacademy, and she said, \u201cLilly, I had a phone call from somebody called Horst Hesser, do you\nknow Horst Hesser?\u201d And I said, no, I don\u2019t. She said, \u201cDo you know Horst?\u201d So I thought about\nit, and I said, \u201cWell the only Horst I know is the doll I had. My little doll I played with in -- in\nGermany was a boy doll, and his name was Horst.\u201d I said, \u201cThat\u2019s the only Horst I know.\u201d But I\nmust have called that Horst after -- that doll after somebody, somebody I liked, but I couldn\u2019t\nremember. She said, \u201cWell, Horst Hesser is trying to reach you, and he says he has some items\nthat belong to you.\u201d I said, \u201cNo, that can\u2019t be, I -- I just don\u2019t know anybody.\u201d So she said,\n\u201cWell, he said he has certain belongings from your parents and he has looked for you all his life,\nand he just found you through the internet, through the computer.\u201d Well, apparently Horst Hesser\nhas a son-in-law and he is very creative with the computer and Horst has said to him at various\ntimes, could you put in the name of either Vanna Cohn or Lilly Cohn and see what happens. And\nover the years, nothing happened. And Horst said that when he went to Halberstadt, he would\nalways ask, what happened to that family, Cohn, and anyone he would ask would say, we don\u2019t\nknow, or we\u2019d rather not talk about that. So this time this son-in-law put in the name Lilly Cohn,\nHalberstadt, and it came out that it said, Lilly Cohn, Halberstadt 1s now Lillyan Rosenberg, tour\nguide in New York. So he was extremely excited and went to see his father-in-law and told him,\nI think I found her. So one thing led to another, they contacted the guide association in New\nYork and said, do you know Lillyan Rosenberg? And they said, oh sure we do, because of\ncourse, they speak different languages and I did tours in German. They said she was president of\nthe multilingual guide association. He said, well how can we reach her? So they told him how\nthey could reach me, and that is how Horst called Halberstadt and she told me to get in touch\nwith Horst. So now I called him, and one f -- morning I called, and of course my German is\nfluent, and I said to him, \u201cHere is Lilly Cohn.\u201d And he said, \u201cAre you the little girl I played\nwith?\u201d I said, \u201cI don\u2019t know, I can\u2019t remember.\u201d He said, \u201cWell, if you are the one,\u201d he said, \u201cour\nparents were very good friends and they used to have coffee and cake at your house, and you and\nI would play under the table and do some crayoning or play.\u201d I must have been all of seven years\nold at the time. And sh -- he said, \u201cWhile I am speaking to you, I have paintings in front of me,\nand these paintings were done by your mother, and they have your mother\u2019s signature.\u201d And so I\nsaid, \u201cThat can\u2019t be.\u201d He said, \u201cYes, I have several items from your parents.\u201d And he told me\nthat his father and my father were doing business together. So I believe that after my father\u2019s\nstore was closed, he still sold linens by going to people\u2019s houses, or business, I don\u2019t know. But\nwith a suitcase I remember him getting on the train and that was after the store was closed,\nbefore concentration camp. So apparently he knew this family well. So ma -- now --",
        "Q: And where -- and where were they, where did they live?",
        "A: They now live in a different town called Schwerin, but at the time, his father and my parents\nlived like 10 miles apart. He -- the father of Horst and family, they lived outside of Halberstadt, a\nreal farm country. Like we have Pennsylvania Dutch, real country. There\u2019d be one house here,\nand a half a mile away, another house. That\u2019s how his parents lived. So apparently, during the\nwar, my father said to Horst\u2019s father, would you come and get some of our precious belongings\nin case we ever have to leave our home and would you hold them for safekeeping? So\napparently, Horst\u2019s father, at great risk to his own life, came in the middle of the night with, I\nthink a horse and buggy, and took furniture and carpeting and silver and paintings, a s -- little\nstatue, and various items from my parent\u2019s home, and he drove them during the night because\nnobody would see him where they live, and he hid them in a barn. So these items were hidden in\na barn all the war years. And of course, eventually, my parents had to leave home, their ho -- our\nhome. And after the war, Horst\u2019s father said to his two sons, who were now teenagers, \u201cWe have\nbelongings from a Jewish family, the family Cohn, and I\u2019m trying to find them, and if I don\u2019t\nfind them, I want you to promise me that you will always look for them, and we have to return\nthese items to that family.\u201d So I couldn\u2019t believe what was happening. But it was just a year ago\nin July that we made arrangements then to come to Halberstadt and that Horst and his wife\nwould come to Halberstadt, and then my husband was coming with me, of course. And the two\nsons said, \u201cWell then, we\u2019ll go too, because if you\u2019re going, we\u2019ll go.\u201d And the three\ngrandchildren said, \u201cWell if you\u2019re all going, we want to go, too.\u201d So on July of nine -- of 2 -\n\u201805, we all arranged to be in Germany. So it was the two sons, one daughter-in-law, and the three\ngrandchildren and my husband and I, we all went to Halberstadt and we met Horst and his wife.\nThey are also in their 70\u2019s, like I am, but he\u2019s a little bit older, and they\u2019re a very charming\ncouple. And we spent a few days with them in Halberstadt. And there were great festivities, if\none may call it that, because there was the press, and television and newscasters, all at the\nmuseum where this took place. And some students, and outsiders. It got a tremendous lot of\npublicity and Horst returned the paintings to me, and a whole set of silverware with the initial C\nfor Cohn, and a little statue. It took quite awhile, but eventually it reached our home in New\nYork, and we are now blessed to have the paintings and the silver and the statue in our home.",
        "Q: I want to ask you first of all, when\u2019s the first time you ever went back to Germany after the\nwar? Tell me a little bit about that.",
        "A: Well, I was once in Germany when I was working at the German national tourist office, and I\nacco-companied American tourists to Germany, and I was more or less the interpreter.",
        "Q: And when was that?",
        "A: In 19 -- approximately 1974. I worked at the ger -- German tourist office for five years and\ngave advice to American travel agents and tourists who were thinking of going to Germany. Of\ncourse, I don\u2019t remember Germany as such, I only know the map, and I studied that. But\neventually I had to take American travel agents to Germany, and I would have a local tour guide\nover there explaining things to me in German, and I in turn interpreted it into English.",
        "Q: So tell me, how did it feel the first time you were back in Germany, how did that feel?",
        "A: I decided that I will think of it as if I was in Scandinavia, because it was all strange to me\nanyway, and I did not like the idea of going to Germany, and on my own, I would not have gone.\nBut that was business, and I did what I had to do, and it was successful.",
        "Q: Did you feel uncomfortable around Germans, especially if they were of a certain age, old\nenough to have been active during that time?",
        "A: At times very much so, because --\nEnd of Tape Three, Side A\nBeginning Tape Three, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Lillyan\nRosenberg. This is tape number three, side B. So you were telling me about your interaction with\nevery day Germans, I guess whether that first trip to Germany, or tourists who came here and\nany of the discomfort that you may have felt in the earliest times that you can recall?",
        "A: I did not go to Germany voluntarily, but since it was part of my job, I decided that if I didn\u2019t\ndo it, somebody else would be doing it. And we visited a synagogue in Worms in Germany, and\nmy question was to the guide who showed us around, who was wearing a yarmulke, you know,\nskullcap, a-are there any Jews who ever come here? And he said no, there were no Jews who\ncame to Worms, but they built a token synagogue like a goodwill, restitution thing. But the\nsynagogue is used at times by American soldiers who are stationed in the vicinity. So it was used\nthere, but otherwise there were no Jews who came back to Worms, which was a very active\nJewish community before the war.",
        "Q: So that was your trip in the 70\u2019s, is that right?",
        "A: Right.",
        "Q: And then you were starting to tell me about perhaps feeling uncomfortable, even German\ntourists -- did 1t make you uncomfortable sometimes to meet Germans who you wondered about\nwhat they had done during the war time?",
        "A: Well, very often they would ask me political questions. Now that I was dealing with them --\nwith German tourists in America. But I -- I would turn that around very quickly by saying, my\njob 1s to tell you about America, and I want to tell you about the Empire State building, or the\nChrysler building, or whatever, and I never really went into my background. It was only once,\nwhen German tourists introduced themselves on one of my longer tours, where I have people\ncoming up to the mic, and they say, I was a teacher in Frankfurt, and the other one says, oh I\u2019m\nalso from Frankfurt, so they got to know each other. And this one woman said she\u2019s from\nHalberstadt. So that took me by surprise, and I didn\u2019t know just how to handle that. And I did not\ntell her that I was born there until the last day when I took them to Kennedy airport. I decided on\nmy way there that I would dec -- would tell her about it. And I asked her what kind of work they\nwere doing, and she said, we made uniforms in Halberstadt. So I wasn't too happy, and I did not\nwant that to be the conversation on the whole tour, because I\u2019m dealing with Germans, and\nAustralians, or Austrians and English, they could all be in one bus, but I really didn\u2019t want to\nhave that as a conversation piece. So in general I avoided having these kind of conversations.",
        "Q: Now when\u2019s the next time you went to Germany, and what were the circumstances of that\njourney?",
        "A: We got this letter from Jutta Dick from the Moses Mendelssohn academy in Halberstadt,\nGermany, saying we would like to invite you to come over to -- to Germany, and this was\napproximately year 2000, approximately. And she said, would we be willing to address some of\nthe students of the vicinity, and it was mainly because of the diary I kept, because I sent a copy\nof the diary, I think it\u2019s about 66 pages, I sent a copy to the museum in Halberstadt, because\nthey\u2019re trying to show what life was like in that community. And that tagabu, this diary of mine,\nwhich I have right here, became a textbook for the students in the area. And they studied my\nbackground and the way of life in Halberstadt. So she asked if I would address students and\ncome over there and s -- that they could a -- meet somebody and speak to me directly. So my\nfriend Ruth Oppenheimer, who I mentioned before, and her husband, and my husband Jerry and\nI, and one lady from Israel, her naveda -- name is Judith Beerun, and she goes to Halberstadt fr --\nquite frequently from Israel, she is older than I am. We were all in Halberstadt together, and we\nhad interviews, mostly at the museum and sometimes at a school where students of a -- an age\nabout 16 to 20 -- not the youn -- very youngest, could ask questions, anything they wanted. And\nbeing that my German is quite fluent, they -- they would speak to me and give -- and I would\nanswer their questions. I also offered them that if they had any questions that they could write to\nme and I would answer their letters, which indeed I did. One of the letters which is outstanding\nin my mind is where a young student wrote to me, of course all in German, I was born in\nGermany, and wherever I go in the world, wherever my parents and I travel, people always refer\nto us as Nazis. What can I do about it? After all, I wasn\u2019t even born. What can I help what my\ngrandfather may have done, and so forth. So I gave it quite a bit of thought how to answer such a\nletter. And I wrote back and I answered every letter, but this came up in several versions. And I\nsaid, you know, you are not responsible for things that happened before you were born. But\nyou\u2019re very responsible for all the decisions you make in your lifetime. And therefore, all I can\ntell you is that you do not have to feel guilty for things that happened before your time, but be\nvery sure that whatever decisions you make in your life will be the right decision, and not only\nbecause of the majority doing it. So I ho-hope that I gave the youngsters the proper advice.",
        "Q: Did you feel -- on these trips to Germany, did you feel a certain inevitable resentment toward\nGermans, toward Germany?",
        "A: I must carry on for what I just said. I feel that the young people are not responsible for that\nwhich happened before their time. I look at the old people in a different way. And yet I feel life\nmust go on, and we must be positive. I cannot say that one can ever forget the type of childhood\nthat I had because of the loss of my parents. I cannot forgive them for that, but I cannot hold it\nagainst all the Germans, because I think they\u2019re doing the best they can to help Israel, and I have\nfound many, many positive things, including some very, very good people, including this Horst\nand his wife. They had, for instance, the various pieces of silver for my parents, which my\nparents might have hidden somewhere, I don\u2019t know, and that was distributed among the various\nmembers of the family. And yet when they heard that we were coming to Germany, they all gave\nit back and we have all these things from all the various members. So there are many good\npeople, and we have to realize that and go ahead.",
        "Q: What about Horst himself? During the war time, was he of age to be in the German army?",
        "A: I believe he was first in the Hitlerjugen -- youth -- children\u2019s you -- Hitler youth, and later on\nhe was in the German army, and he was imprisoned. And he is quite a character, and when we\nvisited him in Schwerin, which is where they live now, there\u2019s this old castle, and he showed us\nthe castle, and he said, I was imprisoned 1n that castle and I jumped out of the window over there\nand trotted for miles and miles and miles along the train track. And he told us the weirdest\nstories. I mean, he\u2019s quite a character, but they\u2019re very, very good people. Yes, he was in the\nGerman army, and it wasn\u2019t until the war was over that his father told his sons that they have the\nitems belonging to my family.",
        "Q: Now, in particular, you said there are paintings by your mother. Can you describe the\npaintings that you received from Horst?",
        "A: Well, when I first saw the painting, when we met Horst last year, I realized that I had a\nphotograph from my parent\u2019s home, because I had quite a few old photographs, but on that one\nphotograph is the living room of my parents, and in the corner of the living room, on the one\ncorner, is this big painting, and that is the painting that he had, and another, smaller one. Also, I\nhad one painting in my suitcase for the Allens, so it was a pr -- a pr -- a present from my mother\nto the Allens when I came to England, so there was always one small painting, which is in our\nson\u2019s house, the Allens gave it to me. And now we have the two big paintings which Horst gave\nus, and of course it has changed our whole atmosphere in our home, they just look like they\nbelong there.",
        "Q: Describe them. What are they paintings of, the three in total?",
        "A: The one which my son in Connecticut has is of the Hartz mountains, and it\u2019s a river and going\nover a lot of stones and just countryside. The other one 1s -- the very large one, 1s a big church in\nStargard in Pommern. Horst\u2019s wife did some research by going to various libraries to locate\nwhich church could that be, and she located it as the church in Stargard in Pommern. And the\nsmaller picture is the fish mart in Halberstadt, which is still there now. There is a round fountain\nin the center of town, and that seems to be quite a landmark with Bucco from Halberstadt in the\nbackground on the new town hall. Because the new town hall was bombed, but they must have\nhad Bucco hidden somewhere, Bucco 1s still there.",
        "Q: How did it feel for you to be in your hometown? I guess the first time you were there was\n2001? Or --",
        "A: No, just e -- no --",
        "Q: -- you didn\u2019t go back. Describe when you first --",
        "A: We came from Berlin a -- because we met our children in Berlin since the whole family was\njoining us to meet Horst. I had never been back to hal -- oh no, I had been in Halberstadt when\nwe spoke to the students, and I was very much afraid that I would feel very badly when I would\nsee my parent\u2019s home. But when we got to my parent\u2019s home, and they told me this is\nWestendorf, and the exact address, the post office is still there, but vis-a-vis the post office where\nmy parent\u2019s home was is now a very ugly building which was built by the Russians in their style\nof building, which was very unattractive. Like a factory type house. So I did not associate with\nthat building at all. I had no feeling for that building at all. So that which I was afraid of, never\nhappened.",
        "Q: Let\u2019s see what other questions I wanted to ask you. So, on -- is there anything else you\nwanted to mention in terms of the reunion with -- with Horst? Anything else that -- that we\nhaven\u2019t covered? Cause I know that was a very -- I mean, this was really a dramatic\ndevelopment, I mean something that just really took you by surprise, 1t seems.",
        "A: Absolutely. And it -- 1t was an absolute surprise, but I must say, it was one of the more\npleasant surprises in my lifetime. Cause no one could have ever predicted that over 70 years\nwould -- would come -- go by and someone would come up and say, I have belongings from\nyour parents. I mean, it was something that I could not have even dreamt up. It\u2019s just so\nunpredictable. And then they turned out to be such warm and kind people. So that I speak to\nHorst every week, even it\u2019s a year now that we are back from over there. And his son-in-law\nwrites to us on the email, so we know what is happening. In fact, my husband and I are trying to\nfigure out what we can do for them, and we\u2019ve come up with various suggestions. We\u2019d like\nthem to come and visit us, for instance, in New York, but he has said it\u2019s too far, his doctor\nwould not let him fly that far. So then we came up with different suggestions, but we have not\ngotten together yet. I think eventually we will fly to Germany and invite them somewhere, or\nmaybe meet again in Halberstadt, something like that.",
        "Q: Do -- does this episode in any way change just some of your feelings about going back to\nGermany again? You say maybe another future trip?",
        "A: Mm-hm. Yes, I feel much more relaxed about going back to Germany. By choice I would\nhave never gone, but when we were fir -- invited to go there to speak to the students, I felt that\nthat could be my contribution to history. To do something, to let them know that this 1s not just a\nstory, that this is indeed true, cause here I am, and you can speak to me. And I told the students\nthen, if it had not been for Hitler and the Nazi period, I would be one of them. I would have lived\nhere possibly for the rest of my life. But because of destiny, it was different, and I had no control\nover that.",
        "Q: Because, of course, your family felt very German, right?",
        "A: Oh they -- my fa -- father said, nothing can happen to us. After all, I served in World War I. I\nwas on the front, I was a -- a soldier, I fought for the Fatherland. That couldn\u2019t -- nothing could\nhappen to us. But we all know that that\u2019s not the way it was, but they felt very German, just like I\nfeel Iam an American, and I\u2019m sure that my children feel a hundred percent American, they\nwere born here. But our parents felt the same way about Germany. They did not feel different.\nThey had been in Germany for hundreds of years. And they felt that n -- they -- they were\nGermans, just like we are Americans.",
        "Q: Now, I think there is one other item that was in your family\u2019s possession, that there\u2019s another,\nseparate story about this item, because it was not returned by Horst, but it was still -- still\nsomewhere else. Can you tell me about that?",
        "A: Yeah. Well, when I met Horst, I said to him, the only picture I actually remember from my\nchildhood is a picture of Moses. And to the best of my knowledge, the whole picture, in my\nmind, was done in Hebrew letters. Because I can remember standing in front of that picture,\nsince I was always interested in art, saying how can somebody make a picture by using only\nletters? So that\u2019s what I remembered about the picture. So he said, \u201cOh, you mean the Moses\npicture with the 10 commandments?\u201d I said yes. I said, \u201cThat\u2019s the only thing -- I wonder where\nthat is, because if it\u2019s only in Hebrew letters, there can\u2019t be many of those around, it must be\nsomewhere.\u201d So he said, \u201cOh, my sister had it. She gave it to the Jewish museum in Berlin.\u201d And\nthat\u2019s the old Jewish museum, not the [indecipherable], it\u2019s called -- has another name,\nsomething or other [indecipherable] in -- in Berlin it was behind the wall when the wall was still\nup. So --",
        "Q: Does it -- is it still there, or were those items taken to the new Jewish museum in Berlin?",
        "A: No, it was at the old j -- at the old synag -- at the old synagogue, the alt [indecipherable]",
        "Q: The new synagogue?",
        "A: Not the new one.",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "A: Not the new one. It\u2019s a combination of synagogue and museum. If you want Ill look up the\nname of the mu -- museum late -- of the synagogue later. So, I contacted that particular museum\nand was in touch with Dr. Simon and told him that I am the sole survivor of my parents fa --\ndirect family, and I heard that the picture has been donated to the synagogue, or the museum, and\nI would like them to know that I am here, and I would like to have the picture returned. He was\nvery, very evasive. Eventually I made an appointment with him to meet with him while we were\non our trip to Europe last year when we met Horst. And I made a date to meet him at the museum\nwith Jutta. And I spent a whole hour with him. I said, look, I have sent you my birth certificate,\nwhich is from Halberstadt and you know that my parents are Ernst, Marguerita Cohn, and you\nknow that the picture was given to you by Horst\u2019s sister. And he never denied having the picture,\nbut for almost a year we have been talking back and forth. And he told me then that the museum\nhas never returned anything to anyone, because if they would return that picture, then other\npeople would re -- want their belongings back, too. I didn't see it in the museum because I think\nthey had it in a cellar somewhere, it was not exhibited. We tried very, very hard for him to give it\nup. Jutta would go over fr-from Halberstadt and collect it, and there were all kinds of legal things\nback and forth. Eventually our son from Florida contacted his senator, who contacted the\nAmerican consulate in Berlin. And the American consulate in Berlin contacted Dr. Simon and\nsaid, why are you not returning this to Lillyan Rosenberg? She 1s an immediate heir of that\npainting. Then he softened a little bit, he did not want to have problems with the American\ngovernment, because now the government got involved. And a little while ago, approximately\nfour weeks ago, he said it -- a yo -- to the man at the American consulate in Berlin that all Jutta\nhas to do is make an arrangement with him and come and pick it up. So Jutta has picked it up, it\nis now in Halberstadt and will be on view at the little museum of the Moses Mendelssohn\nacademy for awhile, and then we will make arrangements to have it shipped to our home.",
        "Q: So -- and tell me a little of the history. This is not something your mother created.",
        "A: No, this -- no, this is not done by my mother, it\u2019s just a picture that I remember from my\nparent\u2019s home. And the picture is not the picture the way I remembered it, but you know, I was a\nchild and it\u2019s many, many years ago. But I do remember the Hebrew, and the 10 commandments.\nSo I am not sure that this is the picture that I was describing. But we decided my parents could\nhave more than one picture which they have given away, and -- so we -- we d -- I don\u2019t know for\nsure if that is the picture that I had in my mind. It is, however, Moses and the 10 commandments.",
        "Q: And obviously, it sounds like it\u2019s -- it\u2019s important to you that it be on exhibit in -- in the\nmuseum in Halberstadt, right?",
        "A: Yes. And this way it gives some publicity to the area. And the little museum is doing very\nwell. It\u2019s getting tourists from all over the world. And one of the things that the little museum has\nbeen able to do -- for instance, when Jutta was here in New York about four weeks ago, and she\nstayed with us, she told me that one of the professors from a university here in New York, her\nfamily is from Halberstadt, she thought she was alone in the world. Her back -- background, her\nfamily name was h -- Hirsch. Because there was Hirsch Kupva and Hirsch something else in\nHalberstadt. So when she got in touch with Jutta, Jutta told her, you know, you have a lot of\nmembers of your family in Israel, which she did not know. So this woman by the name of\nHirsch, here in New York, did not know that she had family in Israel. They all met again in\nHalberstadt. So the little museum there is getting people together from different parts of the\nworld. And this year they invited grandchildren, that would have been like our age\ngrandchildren, to come there and write about genealogy of their family. So they\u2019re doing a lot of\ngood things in this little town.",
        "Q: And so there were a number of survivors, maybe mostly children, but it sounds like there\nwere survivors of Halberstadt.",
        "A: In different parts of the world, yes, and all over. I mean, they are just scattered. I believe the --\na family from the Rabbi Owerbach, that family is in Israel. But of course, I\u2019ve lost contact with\nmost people, but through a reunion in Halberstadt, or the kindertransport reunion, people do find\neach other.",
        "Q: Okay, and let me see if I have any other questions to ask? Did you keep this baby doll that\u2019s\nnamed after Horst?",
        "A: No, unfortunately I only have the picture of the doll called Horst. And one of the newspapers\nin Florida put the title, a doll called Horst, and had two full pages on the story of the reunion with\nHorst and myself.",
        "Q: How does it feel, this media attention you\u2019ve gotten here, and Germany, is it -- is it also a\nsurprise, or -- or how has that been for you?",
        "A: I look at that as though my life, which I didn\u2019t think was so -- so unusual, because when I\nhave a -- neighbors here, and they say, oh you have such an interesting life, and I\u2019d say where\nwere you from? Brooklyn. I\u2019d say, I wish I was born in Brooklyn. I don\u2019t want such an\ninteresting life. But now that it is the way it 1s, I would like it to be a contribution to history, so\nthat no one will ever doubt what has happened to children like myself. And on a positive vein, I\nwould say that of all the people I know who have grown up under very difficult conditions and I\ns -- look at their family and their children, they have all done a very good job with their sons and\ndaughters, and most of them are professionals and doing very, very well. So I believe we\u2019ve been\nable to teach them very good values.",
        "Q: Do you -- for yourself, would you say that -- that is a direct result of the way that you had\nyour own childhood and the hardships of your childhood?",
        "A: Yes, I believe so, even though I think children of kindertransport parents feel that they are\noverly protected. That is a complaint we get from all the children. They will say my mother\nwants to know where I am, my father wants to know where I am, they\u2019re always keeping tabs on\nus. That might be some of our insecurity of people like myself. But when I watch my children,\nwho now have teenage children, they\u2019re doing the same thing with theirs -- children, they\u2019re\nbringing them up the same way, and I must say I\u2019m glad about that.",
        "Q: Do you find it difficult to reminisce and to remember all these details about -- about your\nchildhood?",
        "A: I would say yes, because it\u2019s not a subject that I dwell upon at all, I look at the future.\nAlthough, we already pretty old, there prob -- I don\u2019t know how much future there is, but we\nlook at it in a positive way. And the past seems to have its very emotional moments. I know that\nwhen we spoke about the time I was told to leave the Allen\u2019s house, how upsetting that was for\nme. I think that that was equally upsetting as leaving my parent\u2019s home.",
        "Q: And has religion played a very important part in your life, in part because of -- of what you\nwent through, would you say?",
        "A: I don -- I cannot really answer that with a yes or no ques -- statement. I know that I feel\nabsolutely Jewish, you could not change me. But I think we\u2019re also very tolerant of all other\nreligions. We have the two sons, one became very religious, and one married a girl who became\nJewish, as I told you. So we brought them up in a modest way, not in a kosher home, but they\nlearned about their background by going to Hebrew school. They were Bar Mitzvahed, they had\nJewish weddings. They keep a different kind of home, the one in Connecticut, Ralph and his\nwife, they have a kosher home. Steven and Susan and Miranda have the average kind of home\nlike we have. But we do keep all holidays and we try to get together as a family at least once a\nyear and that is on Passover, so that we are at one table with both sons. That was my request to\nboth daughter-in-laws when they got married.",
        "Q: Well, I want to thank you very much for agreeing to be interviewed, and just wanted to see if\nthere was anything else you would like to contribute or share before we end the interview.",
        "A: I think you have delved into my life quite deeply, and if I can be useful to others because of\nmy past, then I will feel it\u2019s my little contribution to this world, apart from having a wonderful\nhusband and two great sons. We\u2019ve made the best of every possible situation. And I thank you\nfor the time you\u2019ve spent with me.",

        "Q: And what about his personality? Can you describe him to me?",
        "Q: And your mother, your mother\u2019s personality?",

        "Q: Do you remember the name of the synagogue?",
        "Q: And what about your family, would you consider your family Orthodox? Your family in\nHalberstadt?",
        "Q: So, can you describe to me a little more about the town of Halberstadt?",
        "Q: And how large of a Jewish community in Halberstadt, would you say?",
        "Q: What was your sense of things, was it a -- a fairly large Jewish community for the size of the\ntown?",
        "Q: And what about your family? Do you remember if it was mostly Jewish friends that your\nfamily had, or also non-Jewish friends in the town?",
        "Q: And can you describe to me a little more in terms of a physical description, your home?",
        "Q: What are your earliest memories as a child?",

        "Q: So you were at a religious school?",
        "Q: Do you know the name of the school?",
        "Q: Now tell me a little more about your brother, his personality and when you were very young,\ndid the two of you get along, did you fight? Tell me about him.",
        "Q: And what about, since you were at a Jewish school, I\u2019m imagining the other students are\nJewish, did you have any non-Jewish friends in the town of Halberstadt?",
        "Q: Now, when the Nazis came to power, you were very young. And tell me what your very\nearliest memories are about the beginning of the Nazis and the Hitler regime.",
        "Q: Well, you would run home and you would probably talk to your parents about this. What\nwere they telling you? Do you remember any of the discussions with your parents?",
        "Q: Can you -- can I ask you, what was this like? You were very young, and -- and was this very\nfrightening, that night that this happened?",
        "Q: Now, let me ask you, before Kristallnacht, did you notice -- do you remember other things\nthat were happening and changing? Did you ask any -- you know, additional questions of your\nparents? Do you remember anything else going on even before all of this happened at\nKristallnacht?",
        "Q: What happened to that shop once it was shut? Did anything else happen there, did others take\nit over?",
        "Q: Now let me also ask, what was happening among your school friends? Were -- were other\nchildren leaving the town even before Kristallnacht? What -- what did you notice about any of\nyour friends during this time?",
        "Q: The friends -- circle of friends grew smaller and smaller. Gradually families emigrated to any\ncountry which would offer them asylum. My parents had a quota number to come to America.\nAnd I know the quota number was 51 thousand and something and it would have taken one to\ntwo years before that quota number would come up. Meantime, though, other families emigrated\nto Chile, to Argentina, to Palestine, to any part of the world that would take them. And it was\nvery hard to find a country that would take in a Jewish family. For instance, in America you\nneeded to have someone who would guarantee that they would take care of you if you did not\nhave employment. We had an unc -- my -- brother of my mother, Hans Marcuza was living in\nNew York, and he filled out all the necessary papers for our family. But the quota number which\nwe had would not have come due for at least a year or two after the war had started. So in the\nmeantime, my family, my f -- mother and father decided that 1t would best -- be best to send us to\na safe area anywhere, and then they filled out the application at Bloomsbury House in England to\n-- for the kindertransport.",
        "Q: Can you explain what Bloomsbury House 1s?",
        "Q: I think I\u2019m going to turn the tape over.\nEnd of Tape One, Side A\nBeginning of Tape One, Side B",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Lillyan\nRosenberg. This is tape number one, side B. Okay, if you want to continue with what you were\nsaying before.",
        "Q: Can we back up just for a moment? I think that you started to keep a diary even before you\nleft. Do you remember when you started keeping the diary?",
        "Q: Even before you got onto the train headed, you know, to England, eventually, on the\nkindertransport, what were your feelings at the time that you heard -- you were on vacation at\nthat time, I believe -- what were your feelings about hearing that you were going to leave?",
        "Q: Now before we get to the day of your departure from Halberstadt, can you tell me what else\nyou remember having happened at the time of Kristallnacht in the town? Were there other signs\nof things that had happened that night?",
        "Q: What other efforts do you remember them making for the whole family to emigrate? Were\nthey still trying to do that, or they thought that that was not possible any more?",
        "Q: Now, when you were on vacation with your mother, and you learned that you would be going\nto England soon, what did you learn at that time about the people you would go and stay with in\nEngland?",
        "Q: And you know, how did the match get made with this family?",
        "Q: Did your parents have to put up money for this?",
        "Q: Did you have other items sent to you, or was that the only -- were those the only items you\ntook from your home?",
        "Q: Well just going back a little, were you musical as a child in Halberstadt? Did you play music\nor have other hobbies that you pursued?",
        "Q: Any other hobbies or interests you remember as a small -- as a young child in Halberstadt?",
        "Q: Did your mother work outside the home?",
        "Q: So now let\u2019s talk a little bit about the -- the day -- the days leading up to your departure from\nHalberstadt, what you remember about either the preparations, any family discussions you\nremember.",
        "Q: And do you remember any discussions with your father as well, or mostly with your mother\nas you were leaving -- getting ready to leave?",
        "Q: Do you know how it is that they wound up being so positive? Do you have any perspective at\nthis point, or insight as to how they were able to do that?",
        "Q: So what do you remember about the actual day that you left Halberstadt?",
        "Q: So this was in the morning you went to the train?",
        "Q: So your parents were able to travel with you from that train platform where the photo was\ntaken, to Hanover, and then that\u2019s where they had to say the final goodbye. And tell me how --\nhow was the final goodbye at the train station in Hanover?",
        "Q: So what was the first meeting like that day?",
        "Q: Do you remember -- do you remember the address where -- where their house was located?",
        "Q: And also, just to go back, do you remember the address where you lived as a child in\nHalberstadt?",
        "Q: So your first impressions, arriving to this new place in England, what do you remember\u2019?",
        "Q: This is a United States Holocaust Memorial in -- Museum interview with Lillyan Rosenberg.\nThis is tape number two, side A. So you were beginning to tell me about the school you attended,\nand your parents corresponding with the nuns, I believe, at the school?",
        "Q: Do you think religion was important for you at this stage, this transition as a -- as a\nyoungster? Did it help you?",
        "Q: What kind of debate would you have? Do you remember any of the specifics?",
        "Q: Were you the only Jewish child in the school?",
        "Q: Well, let\u2019s go back. First of all, what\u2019s the date when you arrived to England?",
        "Q: And when did you brother come to England?",
        "Q: So you occasionally saw him, but not very much, it sounds like.",
        "Q: What were they writing about, do you remember\u2019?",
        "Q: Now, can you give me a better description, a sense of the Allens? Could you tell me each of\ntheir first names, and -- and their personalities, even physical description.",
        "Q: Tell me more about them.",
        "Q: Did you talk to the Allens? Did you tell them that you were unhappy? Do you remember\nconversations at the time?",
        "Q: What was their religion?",
        "Q: And can you tell me what -- what are both of their first names?",
        "Q: So you were probably with the Allens for at least a couple years, or what do you recall?",
        "Q: So what age are you at about this time?",
        "Q: Do you think you stayed pretty optimistic throughout this time period of your life?",
        "Q: So tell me about the physical surroundings. What -- what was the -- set the scene a little bit at\nThe Beacon.",
        "Q: Now, just to go back, when you arrived to The Beacon, were most of the other girls at the\nschool Jewish?",
        "Q: Did you also feel more comfortable being around Jewish friends again? Did that make a\ndifference to you at the time?",
        "Q: So, while you were at The Beacon, what did you have to -- you -- you started to talk about\nhow you eventually learned you needed to make money, but while you were still studying at The\nBeacon, what -- how were you taken care of in terms of money? Were the Allens sending you\nmoney, and -- and what did you need in those days in terms of money?",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Lillyan\nRosenberg. This is tape number two, side B. I wanted to just go back a little bit and ask you --\nback to your childhood memories in your hometown of Halberstadt, can you tell me -- I know\nyou mentioned a little bit about going to synagogue, but in the home, what are some of the\nfavorite holidays that you remember? Do you have vivid memories of holidays at home?",
        "Q: And you remember Passovers as well?",
        "Q: And I think you mentioned this in one of your other -- excuse me -- interviews, but I was\ncurious, could you tell me a little bit about what your parents maybe said to you about being\nJewish. Did you feel special, did you feel different in some way?",
        "Q: And what about -- I believe you wore the Star of David around your neck and can you tell me\nwhat happened when you moved to England?",
        "Q: That\u2019s so nice. So, now when you are at The Beacon -- I know that\u2019s where we left off, with\nyou at The Beacon, and I wanted to just try to establish, what were some of the other kinds of\nchanges. You told me about the air raids, I believe, or maybe you might want to speak a little\nmore about that, but what other changes since the war had started, how -- how were things\nchanging with -- with the war going on?",
        "Q: And what about the correspondence with your parents? If you can sort of characterize what\nthat correspondence was like through this time period. We talked a little bit about, I think, the\nearly days with the Allens --",
        "Q: -- but going from the Allens to The Beacon, and when you heard from them, and then when\nyou didn\u2019t hear from them.",
        "Q: When did that last letter come to you?",
        "Q: Did you -- did they seem to know at all where they were going to be sent, in that letter?",
        "Q: Never?",
        "Q: And what -- what about keeping your diary? Did you continue writing in the diary when you\nwere at the Allen\u2019s and at The Beacon? What do you -- what do you remember about the diary?",
        "Q: And also at The Beacon, were you interested in boys at this time of your life?",
        "Q: Okay, so now I think we\u2019re caught up, and we were last talking about The Beacon and your\ntransition from there to London. Do you know when that was, and maybe now you want to just\nstart over and talk about living with the Haywards, I believe.",
        "Q: So this was -- this was actually already after the war, or is this while the war is still going on?\nCause you --",
        "Q: Okay, so probably not \u201946, so it must have been earlier.",
        "Q: And that\u2019s still while the war was going on?",
        "Q: And that\u2019s before the war ended?",
        "Q: Did these sorts of things scare you at the time, or did you take them in stride in a certain way?",
        "Q: But still, you somehow weren\u2019t terribly frightened, it sounds like.",
        "Q: So what do you remember about the war coming to an end?",
        "Q: How did you feel about the possibility at this stage, going to America?",
        "Q: When did you leave for the U.S.?",
        "Q: What was his name?",
        "Q: So you remember the journey fondly, going to America?",
        "Q: What were your very first impressions coming into New York?",
        "Q: After that, how did you assimilate and adjust to being a new immigrant here?",
        "Q: What year did you get married?",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Lillyan\nRosenberg. This is tape number three, side A. As you were saying before, a lot of things were\nhappening to you in your first years in the U.S., right?",
        "Q: So it sounds like you adjusted pretty well to your new life in the U.S.. Would you say so?",
        "Q: So at this stage of your life, would you have felt more German, or more British in your sort of\nnational identity or -- or background, if you will.",
        "Q: Can you tell me about the reunion I think you had, back in England at The Beacon?",
        "Q: And how did it feel to go back to this reunion? Was it emotional for you?",
        "Q: And when you were back in England for this reunion, did you go to The Beacon?",
        "Q: How many girls in total were at The Beacon when you were there, do you know\napproximately?",
        "Q: Now, when you arrived to the U.S., were you still hopeful that you would find your parents,\nor hear from your parents?",
        "Q: So this is the first concrete information --",
        "Q: -- and then, did you know where they may have gone, or -- when did you find out anything\nelse, or did you find out?",
        "Q: And so it sounds like that transport, did anyone ever find out if that transport when to\nAuschwitz, or it went somewhere else?",
        "Q: But your grandmother, when did she pass away?",
        "Q: So was there any point at which it really sank in for you that you wouldn\u2019t see your parents\nagain, and when was that?",
        "Q: And so the last time that you saw them was at that train station?",
        "Q: Now this photo, plus I know other photos are items that you\u2019ve been able to hold onto for the\nrest of your life.",
        "Q: Can you tell me, just about the photos right now, how it is that you managed to do that, and\nthat one photo from the train station, did you have that throughout, or was that sent to you at\nsome point?",
        "Q: And so you probably always felt that it was very important to -- to hold onto these\nphotographs. Did you feel that from a very young age already?",
        "Q: And what other objects -- when you did come to the U.S., what other objects from -- from\nyour past did you bring with you at that time?",
        "Q: And were you surprised when you re-read your diary? Was there anything in there that\nsurprised you, or you hadn\u2019t remembered?",
        "Q: Was that a difficult process for you?",
        "Q: Do you think that\u2019s helped you in a way, not to dwell on the memories, the bad -- the -- the\ndifficult memories?",
        "Q: And what about with your children? Did you talk much about your experiences as a youngster\nwith your children?",
        "Q: Why do you think you didn\u2019t talk much about this, or at all, with your own children?",
        "Q: So now if you would tell me about what happened with the other items, this sort of surprise\nphone call that you received, other items that wound up being -- belonging to your family, and\nthat you didn\u2019t even know about.",
        "Q: And where -- and where were they, where did they live?",
        "Q: I want to ask you first of all, when\u2019s the first time you ever went back to Germany after the\nwar? Tell me a little bit about that.",
        "Q: And when was that?",
        "Q: So tell me, how did it feel the first time you were back in Germany, how did that feel?",
        "Q: Did you feel uncomfortable around Germans, especially if they were of a certain age, old\nenough to have been active during that time?",
        "Q: This is a continuation of a United States Holocaust Memorial Museum interview with Lillyan\nRosenberg. This is tape number three, side B. So you were telling me about your interaction with\nevery day Germans, I guess whether that first trip to Germany, or tourists who came here and\nany of the discomfort that you may have felt in the earliest times that you can recall?",
        "Q: So that was your trip in the 70\u2019s, is that right?",
        "Q: And then you were starting to tell me about perhaps feeling uncomfortable, even German\ntourists -- did 1t make you uncomfortable sometimes to meet Germans who you wondered about\nwhat they had done during the war time?",
        "Q: Now when\u2019s the next time you went to Germany, and what were the circumstances of that\njourney?",
        "Q: Did you feel -- on these trips to Germany, did you feel a certain inevitable resentment toward\nGermans, toward Germany?",
        "Q: What about Horst himself? During the war time, was he of age to be in the German army?",
        "Q: Now, in particular, you said there are paintings by your mother. Can you describe the\npaintings that you received from Horst?",
        "Q: Describe them. What are they paintings of, the three in total?",
        "Q: How did it feel for you to be in your hometown? I guess the first time you were there was\n2001? Or --",
        "Q: -- you didn\u2019t go back. Describe when you first --",
        "Q: Let\u2019s see what other questions I wanted to ask you. So, on -- is there anything else you\nwanted to mention in terms of the reunion with -- with Horst? Anything else that -- that we\nhaven\u2019t covered? Cause I know that was a very -- I mean, this was really a dramatic\ndevelopment, I mean something that just really took you by surprise, 1t seems.",
        "Q: Do -- does this episode in any way change just some of your feelings about going back to\nGermany again? You say maybe another future trip?",
        "Q: Because, of course, your family felt very German, right?",
        "Q: Now, I think there is one other item that was in your family\u2019s possession, that there\u2019s another,\nseparate story about this item, because it was not returned by Horst, but it was still -- still\nsomewhere else. Can you tell me about that?",
        "Q: Does it -- is it still there, or were those items taken to the new Jewish museum in Berlin?",
        "Q: The new synagogue?",
        "Q: Okay.",
        "Q: So -- and tell me a little of the history. This is not something your mother created.",
        "Q: And obviously, it sounds like it\u2019s -- it\u2019s important to you that it be on exhibit in -- in the\nmuseum in Halberstadt, right?",
        "Q: And so there were a number of survivors, maybe mostly children, but it sounds like there\nwere survivors of Halberstadt.",
        "Q: Okay, and let me see if I have any other questions to ask? Did you keep this baby doll that\u2019s\nnamed after Horst?",
        "Q: How does it feel, this media attention you\u2019ve gotten here, and Germany, is it -- is it also a\nsurprise, or -- or how has that been for you?",
        "Q: Do you -- for yourself, would you say that -- that is a direct result of the way that you had\nyour own childhood and the hardships of your childhood?",
        "Q: Do you find it difficult to reminisce and to remember all these details about -- about your\nchildhood?",
        "Q: And has religion played a very important part in your life, in part because of -- of what you\nwent through, would you say?",
        "Q: Well, I want to thank you very much for agreeing to be interviewed, and just wanted to see if\nthere was anything else you would like to contribute or share before we end the interview.",
        "Q: Thank you very much. This concludes the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\ninterview with Lillyan Rosenberg.\nEnd of Tape Three, Side B\nConclusion of Interview"

        "A: January 30\", 1928.",
        "A: My family lived in Halberstadt for many, many years. In fact, my grandfather was already\nborn in Halberstadt. So we have a history of about 300 years and I have some very old papers\nthat go back to my grandparents living in Germany and they lived in Halberstadt all these years.\nAnd my co -- family was very comfortable, and had a very cultured, lovely life in my early\nchildhood.",
        "A: My immediate family in New York?",
        "A: When I was a child, I had one brother. My brother\u2019s name was Vanna, Vanna Cohn, and he\nwas born in 1923, and I was born in 1928, so my parents just had two children. My father\u2019s name\nwas Ernst Cohn, my mother\u2019s name -- maiden name was Margaret -- Marguerita Marcuza, later\non Marguerita Cohn. And my grandfather\u2019s name, who was also in Halberstadt, was Hugo Cohn.\nHe was married to Zelma Lusch.",
        "A: My father had a linen factory, and we had a very good sized store in the same building where\nwe lived. The store was downstairs and had many employees. The articles that were sold were\nmostly very elegant linens. In fact, when my parents sent me to England as a little girl, my\nsuitcase has many linens from my parent\u2019s home, and I\u2019m still using them today.",
        "A: My father was a very jovial person. He was a happy person. I remember many parties at our\nhouse and my parents were good dancers. And the parties which my parents gave is something\nthat always remained with me, because it was a very comfortable, lovely home in my early\nchildhood.",
        "A: I think I\u2019m a lot like my mother. My mother was born Marguerita Marcuza in Stargard, and\nthe area was called Pommern. Stargard in Pommern is now Polish. My mother was a very\nhospitable person, and as I remember, there were many cultured type of affairs such as music at\nhome. There was always piano playing and entertaining, and these were the early memories that\nI have.",
        "A: Well, the synagogue played an important part. Every Friday night the men would go to\nsynagogue. I think my mother was home on Friday night, and then there was the usual Shabbas\ndinner. And I do have a picture of the dining room table on a regular Shabbat evening, with the\ncandles, and the challah, the kiddish cup, and my grandfather, who lived upstairs, would always\nbe at our house every Friday evening. This would be routine, and then on a Shabbat morning, we\nalways went to synagogue. The synagogue played a big role in my childhood. The men and\nwomen were seated separately. The men were downstairs and the women were upstairs like in a\ngallery. The children were with the women and we would look through this little fence-type\nthing and go downs -- look downstairs at the men. And I would look forward to the one\nparticular time that the children were allowed downstairs in the main synagogue, and that was\nSimchas Torah, when they had s-sweets and candies for the children. And I even remember\nplaying a prank here or there in the synagogue by putting some bread -- breadcrumbs or cookies\ninto some men\u2019s jackets. My friend Ruth Oppenheimer, her name then was Ruth Lindheimer, but\nshe also lives in New York, and we are still very, very good friends, I talk to her daily, well she\nand I played this prank and we put these cookies, or crumbs into men\u2019s suits and pockets. And\neventually we had to go and own up to it and apologize. We did.",
        "A: I only remember my [indecipherable]. I don\u2019t know if it had a particular name. There was one\n-- this was the main synagogue, and then there was another little synagogue called Klaus, and\nthat was for those who were super, super Orthodox. And there were quite a few Jewish family\nwho were very, very Orthodox. And in the building which used to be the Klaus synagogue is\nwhere they are now having the new little museum to commemorate and try to show what Jewish\nlife was like before Hitler.",
        "A: No, my family in Halberstadt was not considered very Orthodox, although we had separate\ndishes for milk and meat, and by American standards, I would con -- probably say it would have\nbeen Orthodox. But by the standards of Halberstadt, it was not considered to be so, because\npeople were either extremely Orthodox -- and I remember my mother saying [indecipherable]\nkosher, which means we are new kosher, and that meant we\u2019re not so terribly strict.",
        "A: It was a very charming town of mostly half-timbered houses. Half-timbered means it\u2019s sort of\ncement and wood together, with a great deal of detail of wood. And I remember some of the old\nbuildings, one having a statue on the outside, and that is the town hall. This statue was called\nBucco, and we learned a little poem as children, which says Bucco von Halberstadt [speaks\nGerman here]. And it means, Bucco from Halberstadt, what will you give our children? Will you\ngive them a new pair of shoes? Yes, that\u2019s what your children should have. And I remember\nsome of these children\u2019s songs and some of these children\u2019s poems, because I was 10 and a half\nyears old when I left Halberstadt.",
        "A: I really don\u2019t know, but there were hundreds of families, but I do not know the exact number.\nI am sure that that could be found at the mew -- new museum, which is now called the Moses\nMendelssohn Academy. They would have all the exact figures and details.",
        "A: Yes, I believe it was. As a matter of fact, Halberstadt was well renowned in the Jewish circles,\nbecause of having a large community and a very active synagogue, and a very active Jewish\ncommunity life. I have noticed that in some of those old papers that I have, and the ones that date\nback about 300 years, they were written in Hebrew, so we had some of those translated. And\nthey -- it said for instance, that many businesses were conducted while in s -- during or after\nsynagogue when people -- it was a meeting place, so it was a very active Jewish community.",
        "A: I do think that my -- the majority of my parent\u2019s friends were Jewish. Also, the children I\nwent to school with, since I was at the Jewish school, they were all Jewish, and the parents\nwould be fren -- friendly for many, many years.",
        "A: Our home was a rather elegant home. It was situated right above these stores, which were at\nground level. My grandfather owned the property, and there were at least three to four bedrooms,\na large living room, then there was -- the living was qua -- w-was -- the efs -- there was [speaks\nGerman], which is a smoking room. So it\u2019s a dining room, living room, smoking room. My\nparent\u2019s bedroom, my brother\u2019s bedroom, and mine, and there was a guest bedroom. And\neverything was rather elegantly furnished. We had a maid who took care of my brother and\nmyself. Her name was Alvina, and she was with us for many, many years. I have a picture even\nnow of Alvina and my brother and I being at the wedding and I was the flower girl, age about\nfour or five years old, with little flowers in the hair. But I do have the picture of Alvina. She\nmarried a man who was a carpenter, and my parents asked this ge -- this gentleman to make a\ncopy of our kitchen, so I had a small kitchen, a replica of my parent\u2019s kitchen, and as a child I\nplayed with that a great deal. And when I went to England my par -- parents actually sent that\nchildren\u2019s furniture to England. What happened to it, I don\u2019t know.",
        "A: They were happy memories and I remember the first day of school, where my friend Ruth\nLindheimer [indecipherable] and I started school together. And children at school get like a big\nbag, like a huge cone out of cardboard, and that is filled with candy and toys and pencils. So that\nwas a very happy kind of memory. That was approximately 1935, and I was at the Jewish school\nuntil the school was closed, and that was after Kristallnacht - Crystal Night.",
        "A: I guess things were still quite normal in the early days. For instance, Hebrew was taught from\nthe beginning on, like a foreign language. Later on I would learn a foreign language by\ntranslation. And so we translated prayers, and not only learned to translate word for word, but\nalso how to make little sentences, so that we had a fairly good knowledge of Hebrew. I can still\nread Hebrew, although I must say that when I left Germany, I had little contact later on with\nJewish people.",
        "A: Yes, the school was religious and the headmaster\u2019s name was Luntner, Herr Luntner. That\nfamily had five children in various ages from -- some -- the older one was called yo -- Jota, and\nshe came with me to the train station on the day I left Germany. But school was a happy time,\nand it seemed perfectly normal, we did the usual things, like gymnastics. I would walk to school,\nit was not very far, probably a 10 minute walk. And having been back in Germany a couple of\nyears ago, I saw the building again.",
        "A: Yeah, this was the Juda [indecipherable] in Halberstadt. The Jewish school in Halberstadt.\nHow many chil -- students were there, I don\u2019t know, but I do have a picture of all the students\ntogether, taken in Halberstadt at a ttme when my brother and I were at school together, and my\nfriend Ruth, and her present husband Henry are also on that picture. There are approximately 40\nstudents on that photo which I have.",
        "A: Well, my brother was, as I said, five years older than I, and he seemed to be very proud of\nhaving a little sister. He often told me later on as we were growing up that he said [speaks\nGerman here]. In other words that means I or -- put in an order for you. So he was very proud of\nhaving a little sister. Although, as I grew up, I think I was sometimes a bit of a burden when my\nparents said they had to take me along, and I would drag behind all these boys, who were\nteenagers by then, and they had to take along the younger sister. So it wasn\u2019t always great fun for\nhim, but perfectly normal. However, my brother took great responsibility for me. Obviously, my\nparents must have said that he should keep an eye on me always, and he always did because the\ntwo of us were in England, even though we were not together.",
        "A: I can\u2019t remember any discrimination, but I actually don\u2019t think that among my circle of\nfriends that there were non-Jewish friends, because they were probably children I went to school\nwith, and children whose parents my parents knew. So I don\u2019t have any real collection --\nrecollection of anyone non-Jewish.",
        "A: You know, times were not like they are today where you put on a television and you see\ninstantly what is happening in some other part of the world. And I think my parents shielded us\nfrom any extra worries, or extra concerns. However, I do remember seeing signs in the windows\nthat said, Juden [indecipherable]. That means, Jews are not welcome here. And I would question\nthat sort of thing by -- because I could read by then. In 1933, Hitler came to power on my\nbirthday, January 30\". Other schools had a holiday because Hitler was in power, it was a day off\nfrom school. Not in the Jewish school, we went to school. And then one day, coming from\nschool -- and this would be closer to like 1938, other kids would call across the street, look at\nthose Jews, look at those Jewish children, and the kids would throw stones at us. And I said -- I\ncould not understand, why would they be throwing stones at us, we weren\u2019t doing anything. And\nyou\u2019d run home as quick as possible. So these are my first bad feelings on knowing that\nsomething was going on beyond our control.",
        "A: I was aware that there was a Nazi party, because the other children, who were not Jewish,\nbelonged to an organization called the Hitlerjugend. The Hitler youth. And of course, my brother\ndid not belong to the Hitler youth, who would have been maybe 14 or 15 at that time. But the\nJewish youngsters had their own organization, the Maccabee or some other clubs that they would\nhave. But the Hitler youth were very visible in Germany, and of course I was aware of that. But\nit was not a major discussion in my parent\u2019s home until the night of Kristallnacht, when the\nNazis came to our home in the middle of the night, and they knocked at the door, and if --\neverybody was sleeping, it was an ordinary night, no one expected anything unusual. And there\nwere two men at the door, and they said, we are here to get mis -- Mr. Cohn, Ernst Cohn, my\nfather. And he had to get dressed very quickly, and the two men marched downstr -- the street.\nOur home 1s diagonally across from the main post office. The main post office is still there, our\nhome is not. And as we looked out, we could see other Jewish men, each one with two SS men,\nthey\u2019re -- the Nazis. And they walked them off, we did not know where they were going. They\ntook them and put them into a prison in Halberstadt. And a couple of hours later they knocked at\nour door again, and they said, we came to get the other Mr. Cohn. And my mother said, you\nalready took him, he\u2019s gone, he -- he left. And they said, there\u2019s another one. Well, my brother\nwas hiding in a closet or somewhere that same night. And she said, the only other Herr Cohn is\nupstairs, but you would have to carry him because he is an invalid and he is very old. They said\nno, that\u2019s not the one, and they left. That way my brother was not taken. My father was then\ntaken to Buchenwald, a concentration camp.",
        "A: Well, I realized that things were terribly, terribly wrong, and it\u2019s a -- an extraordinarily scary\nevent for any child. I did not know the multitude of significance of what was happening on a\nworldwide basis at the time. My father was in Buchenwald for a little over five weeks. We did\nfind out where he was. I don\u2019t know whether it was Red Cross letters, or -- by some way, my\nmother knew where my father was. And he came home after five weeks, a good five weeks in\nBuchenwald, and his hair was shaven from his head completely, he had lost a lot of weight. And\nmy father, having been on the road as a salesman for many years, said, I always brought you\nsomething home, well I brought you something. And he had dry bread in his pockets that was\nvery, very hard, but he said, I brought this for you. It was then, when my father came home, that\nmy parents decided they must do something to rescue the lives of their children, for my brother\nand I. And they then registered me for the -- or both of us for the kindertransport. My brother,\nhowever, was 15 at the time, and I was 10, and at 15 they no longer took children on the\nkindertransport. They took them from four to 14, and he was a little too old, so he was not able to\nhave guardians in England like I did.",
        "A: Well, they came to every Jewish home and collect -- demanded all silver and gold. So my\nparents had to give up the jewelry, and I believe they must have hidden certain things, they did\nnot give up everything. But they hi -- picked up sil -- silverware. You were allowed to keep two\nsets of silver per person. So I don\u2019t know just how many things my parents were able to save\nlegitimately, but I remember them coming to every Jewish home and collecting these items. And\nof course my father\u2019s store was closed. You were no longer allowed to have a store, to run a\nbusiness, which my -- was in my f -- grandfather\u2019s hands, and then my father\u2019s hands for many,\nmany years. There was this line and fabrique Halberstadt. But it was closed, and I think my\nfather took a little suitcase, and traveled with this suitcase to some of his customers who were\nlocated in the country -- countryside somewhere, and he would continue doing some business,\ngoing by train.",
        "A: Others took over the store, and I don\u2019t remember exactly who owned it at that time. But at --\nthe building always belonged to my grandfather, and bef -- tween the main building, there was a\nyard in the back of the main building, and then another house, called Hinterhouse, like the\nsecond row of houses, and that had tenants in it. So there were a lot of people living in that small\narea. Unfortunately, just towards the end of World War II, the whole property was bombed, and\nthere\u2019s none of that left, and when I went over there for the first time, I thought I would feel\nterrible about seeing my parent\u2019s home, but it\u2019s no longer there. So I did not have to feel terrible\nabout a building I had never seen before, built by the Russians.",
        "A: Bloomsbury House was the organization in England, similar to HIAS in America. A Jewish a\n-- organization that sponsored particularly Jewish children. And they took an -- not only an\ninterest, but followed each child who was able to come to England, they would follow their\nprogress, and you had something to fall back upon, which was Bloomsbury House.",
        "A: We were discussing the kindertransport and Bloomsbury House. It was summer vacation\ntime, and it was, of course, after Kristallnacht, so the Jewish school was closed. There was no\nmore official school, but it was the height of summer, and my mother and I always went to visit\nher mother, her parent\u2019s home. And that was in Stargard in Pommern. So my mother and I were\nspending a week or two vacation in Stargard when my father contacted my mother and said we\nhave to come home right away because Lillyshin -- they called me little Lilly has guardians in\nEngland and she\u2019s leaving for England next week. So we packed up, we left Uma in Stargard. Of\ncourse, this was the last time I saw her. And we went via Berlin to Halberstadt, and my mother\nsh -- did a great deal of shopping for me. Little [indecipherable] dresses with matching aprons,\nand we had a seamstress coming into our house, that was the normal thing. She made a couple of\ndresses and clothes for me for the departure, which was the following week.",
        "A: Yes, I do remember the diary. For my 10\" birthday I got a diary from my mother, and on the\nfront page it says tagabu, which 1s diary, given to me by mutti, by my mother, for my birthday.\nAnd I wrote about every day life in Halberstadt, and the little pranks we played as children, and\nthe normal life, really, because I was a pretty happy-go-lucky child, and did not have all the\nburdens of the world on my shoulder. So I kept this diary, and the first part of it is all written in\nGerman, however when I left Germany to go to England, being on the train and feeling very\nmuch alone and knowing no one, I wrote into the diary, and I even wrote into the diary in\nHolland, which is the route we took from Holland to -- from Hook van Holland to England. And\nsince there was nobody for me to communicate with, and I didn't realize that suddenly I was\nreally alone and on my way somewhere, not knowing where I was going, I guess it became a bit\nscary, and so I wrote into the diary.",
        "A: Since that was my parent\u2019s wish, to have us in a safe place, my parents were actually very\nclever, because when I think about how my parents handled discussing this with me, I only\nrealize how very wise they were. For instance, both my parents said, look how lucky you are.\nYou will be learning another language, you will be seeing new people. And they just made me\nfeel like I was very special and very fortunate, so I believed that and -- and left quite happily, not\nrealizing then that I would never see my parents again. And of course, I must add that we were\nall in hopes that we would be reunited in the United States. If that quota number had come\nthrough and had not been a war declared, eventually my parents would have gone to America,\nand we would have joined them. And that was the fact with many of the other children who came\nto England like I did. I was not one of the fortunate ones.",
        "A: Those are all very unhappy memories. I know that many Jewish families, whoever were there,\nit was the women, came to my parent\u2019s home, which was always a very gracious, open house,\nvery ha-happy place for people to congregate. So people came there just to be together. And I\nknow that eventually they all had to give up their apartments and homes and I heard that many\nfamilies moved in with my parents, and that was after I had left. But my memories of the time\nwhen my father was in concentration camp, it was a terrible time and great insecurity. We did\nnot know if my father would come home, if he would survive. We were already aware that\nterrible things were happening to Jews everywhere. So these were unhappy memories, and my\nparent\u2019s effort was to save the life\u2019s of their children.",
        "A: At that time it was very difficult to get across the border anywhere. I believe my father would\nhave had the opportunity to go to Cuba, but he did not want to go alone, he would not have left\nmy mother. So unless they could have gone together, my father did not want to go alone. I was\ntold that, and I think that happened after I was already in England. Now, I only know that the\nfamily I mentioned before from the headmaster, those children, there were five children, would\nhave had an opportunity to go to England on the kindertransport, but Herr Luntner said, either we\nall go, or none of us go. And that\u2019s the choice that people had. So that on the monument which 1s\ntoday in Halberstadt at the place where all the Jewish people had to assemble to be deported, all\nthe Jewish people, and on the men -- monument are the names of the people who were deported,\nand it has the father and mother of the Luntners and all five children. My parent\u2019s name is also\non the same monument, and I know that if my parents had not sent me to England, my name\nwould have been there.",
        "A: Well that\u2019s an interesting question because my father\u2019s sister, my Aunt Lucy, Tante Lucy\nSpear was in England. In Germany she was a very wealthy woman, married to a banker in\nFrankfurt, Ulya Spear. Now she became a chambermaid in England, in Manchester. So my\nparents wrote to Tante Lucy and said Lillyshin is going to England next week, this is the address\nof the family, Mr. and Mrs. Allen, and the address in Rochdale, Lancashire. My aunt\nimmediately contacted the Allens, and visited the Allens, and they were very gracious to her. So\nwe had a little knowledge about the family I would be going to. My aunt then wrote to my\nparents and said that I would be very lucky to be with such a wonderful family and that they are\nvery, very anxious to have me come. And so we had a little knowledge about the family I would\nbe going to.",
        "A: The match was made through Bloomsbury House. People who applied wrote in about the age\nof the children, and a photograph, and a little about the family and family background. The\nAllens actually had tried for a different child, but -- her name was Erica, and it did not go\nthrough for some reason because Erica had other foster parents who would take care of her. I met\nErica much later when we were at school together. I saw -- I had seen the picture of her, and now\nI met her, so I took the place of that child, Erica, and they chose me by the photograph and\nbackground of my family\u2019s history.",
        "A: I really don\u2019t know. If so, it probably was very little. I think I read somewhere that they put\nup some money, but it would not have been very much. I think that we were just told what we\nwere allowed to take with us on the train, which was a rucksack and a small bag that you could\nhandle by yourself.",
        "A: After I got to the Allens, my parents send the little kitchen I had, out of wood. It was about\nthe size of a -- the height of a dining room table, 1t was a good size little unit of a dishwashing\nsink and a little table and chairs. And my friend Ruth had the same thing made. So they sent that\nand a very large steamer trunk. And in that steamer trunk was, at the very bottom, an Oriental\nrug, a runner, and a lot of linens. And of course I couldn\u2019t understand why I should have all these\nlinens, but they\u2019re beautiful works of art, all handmade, and of course that was my father\u2019s\nbusiness. And I have always kept these linens and I\u2019m using the pillowcases to this day. They are\njust very, very beautiful, and they wash beautifully, and it\u2019s a constant reminder of my\nchildhood. There was also an accordion when these things arrived. At customs they s -- thought\nthat the accordion was sent as a valuable item that one could sell as an investment, so they said,\ncan I play it? So I said sure. So I remember right there in the customs, where someone from the\nAllen\u2019s family took me, and I took the accordion and played quite well. So they were -- I was\nable to keep the accordion.",
        "A: Yes, I did have piano lessons as a young child in Halberstadt. I had piano lessons in England\nand played Chopin, Schubert and Mozart and Beethoven.",
        "A: Art was always my hobby. If I had a choice to go to a toy shop or a dress shop or a place for\npens and pencils and paint, I would certainly choose whatever had to do with art. And that has\nremained with me throughout my life. But then, my mother was an artist, so maybe I saw her\npainting and I just took to it, and it\u2019s something that I have enjoyed, and I have enjoyed being\ncreative.",
        "A: I know she would not have a job, but I think she was in the store downstairs for a certain time,\nbut there was someone taking care of us, Alvina was always there. So she might have helped in\nthe business, but art was my mother\u2019s hobby, and I just remember her painting a great deal.",
        "A: The preparations were pretty frantic because it was only one week and there was the shopping\nand the packing, and then of course my mother sat down with me and said, you know, there may\nnot be anyone there who will explain the facts of life to you. And little did I understand what my\nmother was talking about. She said, you know, you\u2019re a pretty little girl, and don\u2019t sit on a man\u2019s\nlap and don\u2019t let a man get too close to you. And I couldn\u2019t understand what she\u2019s talking about.\nI said sure, sure. I didn't realize until I was in my teens did I know what my mother was talking\nabout. She also explained menstruation, not to be scared if that should happen. And of course at\nthe age of 10 it\u2019s very early to be speaking about these things, especially since I wasn\u2019t asking\nthese questions, but my mother probably anticipated that there may not be anyone there who\nwould explain these things. And it wasn\u2019t until much later that I really understood what that was\nall about. But my recollections in getting ready were all positive, because I was told how lucky I\nam and you see this [indecipherable] Ruth I was talk about, she doesn\u2019t have guardians -- she did\neventually, and she also came to England. But at the time, each child who was lucky enough to\ngo was considered very, very fortunate, because -- and by that time everyone was trying\nfrantically to get out, just to be secure and to save lives.",
        "A: The discussions were mostly with my mother, but the letters are more for my father because\nthey were typewritten letters that came to England. And they were always good humored and\ngood-natured. In none of the letters did it ever say, your room is empty and we miss you. It was\nalways, look how lucky you are. And in my first letter to my parents, I wrote that ma -- the\nguardians wanted me to call them Pop and Ma, and I didn\u2019t want to do that. But my father wrote\nback -- no, it was my mother who wrote, you see how lucky you are, you already have two sets\nof parents and I had to wait until I was married to have a second set of parents. So you\u2019re very\nfortunate. Go to them and give them a hug and tell them you love them, and always be gracious\nand be grateful. So my parent were extremely positive about everything and that made me feel,\nwell they know what is right and -- for me.",
        "A: I think it\u2019s -- you just have to have very strong character to be able to do that. And now that I\nam older, and have children of my own, I have often thought that if I were in that same position\nto send children away, I\u2019m quite su -- I am not sure that I would have done that, because I think\nit is a terrible thing for parents to part with their children. As I said, there were some who said we\nwill all go or none of us go, and it\u2019s a dreadful decision for parents to have to make. And I am\nnot sure that I would have done what my parents did.",
        "A: I played the piano in the morning, and I played a German song that I know, it\u2019s -- what was\nit? [speaks German here]. Because I played the piano quite well, that means, do I have to go, do I\nhave to go out of this town. That\u2019s the name of that song. And I just thought it was very fitting.\nAnd I took my diary with me, and a sandwich, which was in the rucksack. And my parents and\nmy brother and Yuta, somebody we knew from very good friends, came to the train station. And\nYuta took the picture of my departure at the train station. So the whole family, my brother, my\nparents and I are on this picture at the train station in Halberstadt. And today you can see the\nsame water tower at the train station in Halberstadt. It was not bombed, and it\u2019s still there. When\nI was in Halberstadt a few years ago, I went back to the same spot and had a picture taken.",
        "A: Yes, we went to the train from Halberstadt to Hanover. Hanover was the next bigger town.\nAnd in Hanover my parents were no longer allowed to go onto the train station, to the track to\nsay goodbye. They kept parents away at that time. That\u2019s why I think the picture of my parents\nand I at the train is a rather rare picture, and it is used a great deal for teaching purposes in\nAmerican schools and schools in Germany. So that particular picture was taken in Halberstadt at\nthe train station, but not in Hanover. There was one other boy who went with me on the\nkindertransport, his name was David Winter. He was in England with me, and eventually went to\nIsrael.",
        "A: Well, In -- I think my mother was sort of hiding under a big collar of coat, and it\u2019s just a very\nheart wrenching time in everybody\u2019s lives, and suddenly fi -- I found myself sitting on a train --\nin the train with other youngsters, nobody knew each other, and it was a very, very strange\nfeeling. I guess I looked out of the window and at that point there was no one there, and I -- it\nwas the first time I realized that I\u2019m really alone, and where am I off to? However, the\nkindertransport was well organized. It was a locked train, Nazis came in, they would ask\nquestions. Do you have rings, do you have a diamond, do you have a watch? They would ask all\nkinds of questions, but for security reasons I think everyone was very careful with their children.\nParents would not put their children at risk, so -- but they would be walking around, and finally\nwe came to Holland, and suddenly the older children were very jubilant and so happy. They said\nthat we have left Germany. This is the -- this is an upsetting time, having left Germany.\nHowever, people got onto the train once we got to Holland, and they brought cocoa and cookies\nand apples, and the older children, who were more aware of what was going on, were very\njubilant and they sang Hebrew songs, the sort of songs they would sing at a club or at a party.\nAnd it was only then that I realized that we are really out of Germany. From Holland we got onto\na ship, which took us across the English channel. And we were assigned certain berths. My berth\nwas the upper berth. And I had never slept in a bed that was made with sheets and blankets,\nbecause in my parent\u2019s home we had a feather bed. Was like a huge pillow, and you got under\nthe -- under the feather bed. Well, I didn\u2019t know what to do with this. I slept on top of the bed, I\ndid not know that you had to get in between. And I thought it was a rather strange way of living,\nbut -- so I did all the things that were expected and required, and by morning we arrived in\nEngland. I believe it was Harrage. And we were all herded off the ship, and were taken to a huge,\nhuge hall, with lots of benches. And we all had a tag around our neck with a number, like a\ncardboard tag with a ribbon. And you -- each per -- kid had a different number, and then you\nwaited until somebody called your number. I guess they did it in English and German at the time,\njust the numbers. And when my number came up, this -- to me she seemed like an elderly lady,\nshe was probably in her 40\u2019s, and that was Nellie, Nellie Mills, the private secretary of Mr.\nAllen. He sent his private secretary to pick me up. And Nellie Mills was always very, very kind\nto me and very good-hearted. I had great respect for her.",
        "A: Well, Nellie told me later on that of course she couldn\u2019t speak to me in German and I -- cause\nI was babbling away in German, and whatever she said I couldn't understand, but by my actions -\n- she knew that I was wiggling around, and that I needed a bathroom. So the first thing she do --\ndid, was to take me to the bathroom, and eventually we ended on another train which took us to\nManchester, took us north, and from Manchester we went by car to Rochdale. And Rochdale is\nwhere my guardians lived. So Nellie was the one who took me to my guardians. And was a very,\nvery lovely house, and Mr. and Mrs. Allen were very anxious to have a little girl there. It was\nonly later on that I found out their reason why they wanted to have a child in their home. It was a\nvery gracious, beautiful home. They had several cars, a Rolls Royce, and a Lady Austin, a\nprivate chauffeur, and Mr. Allen owned a bus company. In America we would call such a\ncompany like Greyhound. It was privately owned, called Yelloway. So he was the owner of this\nparticular bus company that rode buses from Manchester to London, or Manchester to Liverpool,\nlong distance bus lines. They were quite wealthy people. And the Allens have a son called\nHubert. Hubert was already grown and he was in his 20\u2019s. So he was about 25 years old when I\ncame to them. So, you know, he couldn\u2019t really be bothered with a youngster too much, but he\nwas always very kind to me. We had a very nice relationship. They told me that\u2019s my big\nbrother.",
        "A: Yes, I do know, it was on Bent Meadows in Rochdale, and this county is called Lancashire.\nLancashire is known for linens, but ha -- the bus company was one of the big businesses in\nRochdale. Mr. Allen owned the company until after the war. It was his son who ran the Yelloway\nbus company later on.",
        "A: Yes, it was Halberstadt, Lilly Cohn, Vestendorf [speaks German here]. Vestendorf is the\nname of the street, it\u2019s still called Vestendorf, 34A and B. They were two houses that were\nattached, two houses in the front and two houses in the back. Yes, I do remember the address and\nI still remember the telephone number in Halberstadt. [speaks German] 26-38. But one learns it,\nyou know, in German, and that\u2019s why I said it that way, that\u2019s the way I remember it.",
        "A: Well, I was shown to my room, and I cried a lot. I know I cried a great deal, because I think it\nwas only then that it hit me that no one could understand me. Of course, they knew why I was\ncrying, because I was homesick and it was, I\u2019m sure, quite normal. The Allens did have my aunt\ncome to visit, because my aunt who lived in Manchester, who had a job there as a maid, sh-she\ncame to visit and of course that was very exciting for me to have someone to talk to. But very\nsoon the Allens sent me to school. And they were very smart, because they chose the convent\nhigh school in Rochdale. The convent high school was run by nuns, and these nuns were from\nGermany, so they all spoke German. It was a German order. And since no one could speak to me\nat the Allen\u2019s house, as soon as I went to school, they could speak to me, and they were very,\nvery kind to me, the nuns. And I wrote to my parents, of course, and by pa --\nEnd of Tape One, Side B\nBeginning Tape Two, Side A",
        "A: My parents wrote to the nuns in Rochdale, and said to them that they should please not try to\nchange my religion because my religion would be very important to me, and my parents begged\nthem to honor my background. And they did. Of course, it was a Catholic school, and every\nmorning -- they would have prayers in the morning and when children knelt to say certain\nprayers, and I know all of them, because after all, I memorized them in the name of the Father,\nand all these prayers that I know, but I would not kneel, I would sit. And no one would ever say\nanything. And eventually they actually let me have some lessons with the Father, who was\nassigned to the convent, and the Father knew Hebrew. So I had the [indecipherable] with me\nfrom Halberstadt, and the Father and I would sit in this big room with the stained glass windows,\njust he and I, and he would continue tran -- letting me translate what I was learning in\nHalberstadt. But that just lasted a little while.",
        "A: Religion was already very deeply imbedded in my life, so that I knew I was different. The\nAllens were not religious people, they just kept the big holidays like Christmas, there\u2019d be big\nparties and certain times. But they were not people who would to go a church, and I never went\nto another synagogue. I don\u2019t think there was one in Rochdale. But the nuns were very kind to\nme in many ways. For instance, when Mrs. Allen was -- Mrs. Allen was rather sickly. She had\nmental problems of depression, and sh -- at times she could not put up with a child around. I\nmight be doing something perfectly normal, what I would consider normal, playing with a ball or\nsomething, and that could upset her terribly, which I couldn't understand until many years later,\nwhen they explained to me that she was having mental problems. And that was one of the\nreasons why they thought that having a child in their home would be good therapy for her. But it\nisn\u2019t such good therapy for a child, because I couldn\u2019t understand these things. So I would either\nlive with Nellie for awhile, or I would live with the nuns. And with the nuns I would frequently\nhave religious debates at a very young age, because I knew a lot from Halberstadt, being that it\nwas a rather religious community, I was pretty well versed in the Bible, and the -- what I have\nlearned from home. So you could not change me, I was pretty -- pretty strong-willed.",
        "A: No, I -- I don\u2019t know the specifics, but I know that I would stand my point, I would say no,\nno, no, it couldn\u2019t be that way because God did it this way, or God spoke to Moses or whatever. I\nwas pretty strong about the things that I had learned. And I never did have to participate in the\nNew Testament, only in the prayers that they had every morning. And as far as the English\nlanguage is concerned, I learned English very quickly. I would think that within four weeks, I\nwas able to understand the Allens, although I thought they spoke too quickly. But within two\nmonths I was able to do all the schoolwork, like all the others, and I was on an even level as far\nas math and other subjects were concerned. I had no difficulty in catching up with the English\nchildren. I wore the uniform of the convent, a navy blue uniform with a white collar, and a blue\nand red hat, and blue and red scarf, and I was dressed like all the other children in the convent\nand made friends there, and that seemed to be a normal life, which I became accustomed to quite\nquickly.",
        "A: As far as I know, the only Jewish child, yes. I never met anyone Jewish while at the Allens.\nAnd I had very little contact with my family, because eventually my brother came to England,\nbut by that time the Allens really wanted to keep me away from the family, because they wanted\nme to feel that I was their little girl.",
        "A: In July, 1939.",
        "A: Approximately four or five weeks later, I got a letter from my parents saying, guess what, you\nare very, very lucky, your big brother is going to come to England. And my brother did not get\nout until just before the war started, and he got onto a boat in Holland, but he was able to make\nit. And he was not nearly as lucky as I was, because at the age of 15, he found himself alone,\nwhere I had someone to take care of me. He knew some English and was able to get around, and\nmy aunt was in Manchester, but he had a difficult time to just survive. But he got a job, and then\nanother job, and he did very well.",
        "A: The Allens did not encourage me to have any contact with my aunt or my brother, and by then\nthe war had started. And when the war started, there were no more letters from my parents,\nthough -- the contact between Germany and England, there were no mail -- there was not the\nusual mail service, was completely stopped. Eventually my parents would write to someone in\nSwitzerland who they knew, who readdressed the letters to England. So they would go from\nGermany to Switzerland, Switzerland to England. We still had letters from my parents for a year\nor two.",
        "A: Every letter was a very unhappy letter. It was always, can you do something to help us get\nout. This and this person has left Germany, we can\u2019t get out. The old people were taken to a\nnursing home, so I think my grandfather was no longer living upstairs. And it must have been a\nvery desperate time. And of course they would write, why haven\u2019t you written, and can you send\nus a picture? And this is, you know, several years like that. Eventually there were Red Cross\nletters. A Red Cross letter was 25 words. 25 words from my parents, and they came like a\ntelegram, and you were allowed to write back 25 words, and it goes back to the sender. So that\nwas the only communication during the war that was official communication.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Okay. Well, when I first ca-came to the Allen\u2019s house, Mr. Allen was sick at the time, so he\nwas bedridden with something, no-not on a permanent basis. But he was a very patient and kind\nman, so I spent a lot of time at his bedside, and he would teach me English. He would point to\nthe ceiling and say ceiling, I would say ceiling. He would pa -- point to the floor and say floor,\nI'd say floor. And I repeated everything that he said and then he would point again and see if I\nwould remember it. And I did fairly well. Then he went t -- he asked me to bring his wallet, I\nbrought his wallet. And he took out all kinds of change. And he said, this is a penny, that\u2019s a\nthreepenny bit, that\u2019s a sixpence, that\u2019s a shilling. And so I said, a penny, a threepence -- I\ncouldn\u2019t say threepence, that was very hard, because to put your tongue between your teeth to do\na t-h, doesn\u2019t exist in German. So I probably said tripence, but it\u2019s threepence, three pennies.\nAnd sixpence, a shilling and I think that\u2019s as high as it went. When I had it all correct, he said I\ncould keep it, it\u2019s mine. That I understood. So I thought I was very rich, I now had all this\nchange, which of course I wrote to my parents. I wrote, I have a penny, a threepence, sixpence,\nand a shilling. And my father, which I have in the first letter said, now that you are so rich, shall\nI send you the safe which we used to have? You see, we no longer had the store. He said,\nbecause you need to put all that money in a safe place. So my father\u2019s good humor always came\nthrough. But Mr. Allen was very, very kind and very patient, but he was a true businessman,\nvery, very successful. Hubert, the son, who was in his early 20\u2019s, was one who played cricket.\nHe had this cricket outfit, and at Christmastime would sing in the Christmas carols, there were all\nthese young men, they were there. They were all a lot older than I was. But he was very, very\nnice and very kind to me. He was already active in the business at Yelloway. And Mrs. Allen\nwas the typical English housewife. When I look back on the times with Mrs. Allen, she was very\nspoiled, because she had everything done for her. She had maid service all the time, she had a\nchauffeur just to take her around. And she lived -- could live very graciously, but she had\nphobias. She thought people were laughing at her. I could not understand these things, because a\nyoungster does not understand that. But she was a very kind person, and as I said, they told me to\ncall them Pop and Ma, which I did. And Hubert, who was the big brother. And I was very happy.\nIt became a new home for me. By now the war was on one year, two years, and a ve -- at one\ntime, after Mrs. Allen had been sick again and hospitalized, she got a shock me -- treatments,\nseveral times while I was there. So they told me that they would send me away. And I couldn\u2019t\nunderstand that. They said, well we did not know that the war would go on so long, and we will\nalways take care of you, and they gave me all these stories. But I was extremely upset. I think it\nwas much more upset -- maybe more upsetting for me to leave the Allens, because it was a\nsecond, complete upheaval. The first one I was well prepared for. The -- leaving the Allens I was\nnot prepared for, and I didn\u2019t have that security behind me as having parents, real parents. So\nthey sent me to Tunbridge Wells, which is in the south of England. Tunbridge Wells in the state\nof Kent. And that was a -- don\u2019t remember the exact year, but probably 1942. There was still a\nletter from my parents saying that I should not leave the Allens, please stay with the Allens, but\nthis was beyond my control.",
        "A: You know, this was like a fait accompli, they n -- this was it, I could not argue with anyone\nabout anything, because they made the decisions. They told me how much they loved me, and I\nhave all kinds of letters from them, how much I meant to them, and they wanted to have a child\nof their own, but I would have to be of their religion and they fou -- noticed that they could never\nchange my religion, I was probably too old and too strong for that already. And eventually I was\nsent to Tunbridge Wells.",
        "A: Protestant. Church of England.",
        "A: Margaret was Mrs. Allen, Margaret Allen, and Herbert Allen was Mr. Allen, and Hubert, the\nson. Now, the son eventually got married, and I -- and has a d -- one daughter, and I am still in\ntouch with the whole family.",
        "A: Two to three -- two to three years, I don\u2019t know the date exactly, although in my diary it\nmight record what date I went to Tunbridge Wells. Tunbridge Wells had a school, and I presume\nthey made the arrangements through Bloomsbury House, because all the children who were\nrefugee children were sponsored through Bloomsbury House.",
        "A: By then I was 12. 12 to 13, maybe 13 when I got to The Beacon. The Beacon was the name of\nthe school in Tunbridge Wells, and The Beacon has been a very big part of my life. Of course, I\ndidn\u2019t realize that at the time, I was unhappy getting there, but then I suppose every other child\nwho was there probably felt the same way about leaving their guardians. Cause every child who\nwas at The Beacon had a guardian somewhere. And suddenly here we were, we found ourselves\nall together. There must have been maybe 50 children or more, of different ages, who had all\ncome to England on the kindertransport. But now the war was in progress for a couple of years,\nand the guardians did not realize that they would have these children for so long, and sent them\nto this particular school, called The Beacon. They -- the children there were in age from\napproximately six to 16. When I first got there I was a junior. Later on we -- we became middles\nand then we became seniors, depending upon your age group. And we shared one large\ndormitory room together for at least 12 or more girls in one room. And we got to know each\nother very, very well. The same girls who were at The Beacon then are still my closest friends\ntoday. Some of the girls stayed in England when the war was over, and others went to different\nparts of the world. A few were fortunate enough to be reunited with their parents. Some knew\nthat their parents were alive. I was among those who were hoping that the parents were alive.\nBut, to no avail.",
        "A: Yes, I believe so. I think I have always had an optimistic nature, that\u2019s probably inherited. But\nI don\u2019t think I ever thought about not seeing my parents. I just presumed that when the war was\nover, I\u2019d find them somewhere. We did not know that they were transported to Warsaw, not until\nseveral years after the war.",
        "A: Well, The Beacon was an old mansion many, many years ago, and when I think about it from\nAmerica, I think of it as a huge, huge building. When I went back there for a reunion after 50\nyears, it\u2019s not as big as I thought it was, it\u2019s just an average big house. But it was a gracious\nbuilding, and there was lots of laughter and lots of -- of good fun among the girls, although we\nlived under pretty meager conditions. This was, after all, wartime. Food was rationed, and we\nhad a cook at The Beacon, her name was Mrs. Hayward. That name Hayward was important in\nmy life. Mrs. Hayward was the cook, and we had certain assignments to help. To either peel\npotatoes or help with the dishwashing. After all, there were many, many children there. The food\nwas mainly boiled fish, boiled cabbage and boiled potatoes. So you weren't really hungry,\nbecause you could eat more potatoes, and you could eat more potatoes, but it was pretty awful. I\nmean, it was very healthy food because everything was boiled. They did not have fats. You did\nnot have oil, you didn\u2019t have butter. These things were highly rationed during the war. And we\ndid not see fruit, but vegetables were growing in the area, and there were beautiful, beautiful\ngrounds attached to The Beacon, with three what we called lakes, but they were really puddles.\nWhat we thought was a lake, we took an old bedstead and thought that was a boat. We paddled\naround in that. We improvised with everything. Occasionally clothes came from America. There\nwould be a bunch of shoes, and you could try them on, and if a pair fitted you, they were yours.\nSo we had a lot of clothes like that. Schooling was at The Beacon, it was not too great. Later on\nthey sent us to a school in the town and it was called Holy Trinity. It was worse. It was really not\na good school at all. I was able to take an exam for a special high school. Like in New York we\nhave Stuyvesant High School, Bronx Science, a special school. The school would have been in\nTunbridge, we were in Tunbridge Wells. Tunbridge was maybe 10 miles away. I passed the test,\nbut then they -- the government said I was not a British subject is what they called it, so I was not\nable to go to the school, but continued at Holy Trinity, which was not much of a school. But I\nread a lot and eventually, at the age of 16, I was still there, we all had to choose a career of some\nsort. Most of the girls went in for nursing. And I said no, I didn\u2019t want to be a nurse. And how\nabout a secretarial school? I said no, I didn\u2019t think I would like that. They said, well what would\nI like to study? So I said art. So I di -- took some kind of art exam, probably drawing something\nvery basic, and I was able to go to the art school. So I went to the school of arts and crafts in\nTunbridge Wells, and loved it. We drew from the skeleton, and Michelangelo, and nude figures.\nAnd I think I did quite well, but one of the ladies from the committee who took care of The\nBeacon girls said, you have to learn a profession where you can earn money. I hadn\u2019t really\nconsidered that, seriously. So they told me that I should concentrate on dress design and\ndressmaking, and they did teach that at the school, at the art school. So I learned how to draw\ndresses and how to make patterns, very basic patterns. And I took an exam while at the school of\narts and crafts for the [indecipherable] of London, and I got a degree in fashion at the time. I was\nstill very young, and enjoyed doing that. However, after about two years at the school, they said\nyou now have to take a job and earn money. And that\u2019s rather difficult in the fashion field,\nespecially when you have no background. So one of the ladies from the committee of The\nBeacon in Tunbridge Wells had dresses made at a very fancy couturier shop in London called\nJaquemar. So I had -- they told me I would have a -- get a job at Jaquemar in London. And my\nbrother lived in London by that time, so that was a very good thing for both of us, because that --\nfrom that time on, my brother and I were always in touch, I think we saw each other daily.",
        "A: All the children were Jewish, all the children were refugee children like myself, and they all\nhad different stories to tell. Some were with very good guardians and some were not. So we --\nwe knew all about each other, we were like a group of sisters, and I would say we still are. Half\nof them now live in England, and ha -- maybe half in America, and a few are in different parts of\nthe world. But th -- all the children had a similar background. Now, the interesting part is that I\nhad a friend in New York, her name at The Beacon was Sylvia Balbera. Her married name was\nSchneider, Sylvia Schneider. And she lived in New York until last year, she passed away. If you\nasked Sylvia about the years at The Beacon, she would give you a completely different story\nabout how dreadful it was, not only the food, but the way we were dressed, and that nobody\nloved us, and nobody cared. And yet, I look at the same years as saying they were productive.\nThey made us realize what is important in life and what is not so important in life. Cause we had\nnext to nothing, and yet we had each other. I think it taught us a great deal about the values of\nwhat is important and what isn\u2019t important.",
        "A: I think it gave all of us a certain comfort knowing, for instance, on a Friday night we could\nhave prayers over the bread and wine, and basic things that I remembered from home. I think I\nwas pretty much the leader. They said I was very much of a leader type person. When the s-\nsuperior there said that to me, I didn\u2019t know what she was talking about, but in life she was\nactually quite correct.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember receiving money from the Allens, although I visited them, I would say,\nabout twice a year. I would go to get to London -- you had to get pol -- permission from the\npolice department that you were leaving your residence, since we were known as enemy aliens\nall during the war. All the children were enemy aliens, cause we were not British subjects. But\nthat was not difficult, to get the permit to go. So I would go to London and from London I would\nget on one of their buses, to go to Rochdale, to go to Manchester, and from Manchester to\nRochdale. And most of the drivers knew me from the time I was a little girl. So I did visit the\nAllens on a somewhat regular basis, and they always wrote to me. But now The Beacon really\nwas our home. The one thing I need to mention is that when I was told that I need to have a job\nin London, Mrs. Hayward, who was the cook, had her son and daughter-in-law as visitors most\nweekends. And they came there by bicycle from London with a young couple, to stay with her\nbecause there was a lot of bombing going on. This was the height of the war, and the\ndoodlebugs, which are one kind of bomb, would come over the area of Tunbridge Wells, and\nthey had balloon barrages up to prevent the planes from reaching London. However, this couple,\nHayward, Alec Hayward -- Alec Hayward, right, and Agnes, would come to Tunbridge Wells\nmost weekends. And Alec was an artist. So he and I would do some sketching together. We\nwould draw The Beacon, or we would draw a tree, or whatever, and I got to know this couple\nquite well. So Mr. Hayward, this is the young Mr. Hayward, said to me, where are you going to\nlive when you go to London? And I said I don\u2019t know yet. I did not know. So he said, well if you\nwould like, you can live with us because we have a small house in West Wickham, which is just\noutside of London, and we have an extra bedroom, and if you like you can stay with us. And that\nis what I did, I then lived with the Haywards in London. I did not make enough money to pay for\nthe train fare, and I paid a little bit to the Haywards for room and board, it wasn\u2019t very much. But\nthe Bloomsbury House helped out at that point. So Bloomsbury House paid the ou -- the\nHaywards something towards my keep. And I earned 35 shillings at Jaquemar, and I learned the\ndress trade from the bottom up. I started by picking up the pins off the floor with a magnet, and\nthen they let me put in some basting threads, and take out basting threads. I was allowed to do\nlittle things, but gradually I learned more and more. And in England one learned a profession by\nbeing an apprentice. It\u2019s not necessarily a school. At the school I had learned the pattern making\nand design part of it, but --\nEnd of Tape Two, Side A\nBeginning Tape Two, Side B",
        "A: Oh absolutely. The holidays were really celebrated and we looked forward to them. The dress\nwould be made for what to wear on a high holiday such as Rosh Hashanah or Yom Kippur.\nCourse, a child is growing all the time, but it was a very festive time for any of the high holidays.\nBut every Shabbat was a high holiday in my parent\u2019s home because Shabbat is every week, and\neverybody would get dressed accordingly, and even the photo that I have, the men are wearing\nties, including my brother, and I would be asked to sing a certain song, which 1s from the fr --\nprayer after meals [indecipherable] and I would sing that on a Friday night, and that was\nentertainment for my parents. But holidays were always celebrated, whether it was Purim, where\nchildren get dressed accordingly and have these Purim parties, the story of [indecipherable]. I\nremember all these things from Halberstadt days, it\u2019s a long time ago.",
        "A: Passover, my mother would start a week before, getting out the new dishes, the other dishes\nthat would be used only for Passover. They were white with just a navy blue frame and a little\ngold around. They would just be used for Passover. And I remember my grandfather, Opa, going\naround the house with a feather, and going into the corners to see if there\u2019s a crumb anywhere.\nThese are childhood memories from way back, and I\u2019m surprised that after 70 - something years\nI still remember such little details. But the holidays were really something to look forward to.\nThe various holidays, the Simchas Torah, where children get candies in the synagogue, and\nwe\u2019re allowed to come downstairs to be where the men are, which was a big treat. And that same\nsynagogue today has just one wall left, but they\u2019re picking up the pieces and trying to reconstruct\nwhatever they can of the synagogue the way the original synagogue was.",
        "A: We were always told that we are special, and I grew up feeling that way. There\u2019s no way\nanyone could have changed my religion, even though I was just a little over 10 years old when I\nleft my parent\u2019s home. But I knew that that was a very important part of my life, and I also knew\nthat I would never marry anyone who was not Jewish, because I could not bring up children in\nany other faith. It was already deeply imbedded in -- as part of my life.",
        "A: [had this little Star of David, Mogen Dovid in silver, silver filigree, it\u2019s quite small,\ninsignificant, on a silver chain. And I wore it when I left my parent\u2019s home, when I left\nHalberstadt to go to England. Of course, when I started going to the convent high school, was the\nname of the convent I went to where my guardians sent me, they of course realized that the\nMogen Dovid was not appropriate to go to a Catholic school. So I was told then that I could not\nwear it at all, and I never did, but I always kept the Mogen Dovid. So I had it for years and years.\nWhenever I would look at it, it brought back memories, of course. Many years later, it would\nnow be 19 years ago, our son Steven got married to Susan, Susan Soto. Susan was not born\nJewish, but she became Jewish before Miranda their daughter was born. So when j -- when Susan\nconverted to Judaism, and that is in Florida, I don\u2019t know the exact year, but it is 19 years ago,\nSusan went into the ocean with her husband, our son Steven, because there was no mikvah in\nPalm Beach, so the rabbi was there at the ocean with Susan, who was pregnant with their\ndaughter Miranda, and Steven said, you know, my wife is pregnant, I can\u2019t put her in any further.\nAnd the rabbi said further, she has to go down more. She had just had her hair done for the\nwedding. Said further, she has to go down further. And Susan went to the so-called mikvah in the\nocean, she was converted to Judaism, and Susan received the Mogen Dovid, which I was not\nallowed to wear as a child. And Susan has the Mogen Dovid very proudly, and will pass it on to\nMiranda one day.",
        "A: The war was a very difficult time for everyone in England. In London they had the major air\nraids, where huge areas were bombed. But Tunbridge Wells was in direct line from Germany via\nTunbridge Wells, to London. So the bombs and the planes, which were called doodlebugs -- they\ndidn\u2019t have pilots, 1t was just a plane with a bomb that would come over. In the area of\nTunbridge Wells and surrounding farm country, they put up these huge lines on different levels,\nand balloons, this cal -- they were called balloon barrage, hoping that they would entangle the\nflight of any one of these planes so that they would not reach London. And indeed, quite a few f -\n- fl -- planes were intercepted. Another thing which was typical of a doodlebug is that it would\ngo so many miles and we would hear this droning voi -- noise. You knew what it was, but when\nthe noise stopped, that\u2019s when the agony went off in all of us, because we didn -- it was coming\ndown, but we didn\u2019t know where it would come down and explode. It was really meant to go\nanother 35 miles to London from where we were. But the way of life for everybody was very\ndifficult. We had the air raids at night or during the day and people would rush into shelters. And\nthe food was rationed so that it was very minimal, what everyone received. But being at The\nBeacon, the food was less than minimal. They did not give us, I think, what we were entitled to,\nwhich was maybe one egg a month, because I don\u2019t remember ever, ever eating an egg, or ever\nseeing fresh fruit like an orange or banana. I did not see those things all the war years, not until I\ncame to America.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",

The letters dwindled because they\nwere still sending them to Switzerland, and they would be forwarded to my brother or my aunt,\nand then eventually they would come to me. The letters were always sad, it was always we are\ntrying to get out, we are trying to get by. And my mother would use the phrase very often lorg\nzundt, only -- only good health. In other words, she was hoping that they would stay healthy. I\nknow that because I donated all the letters from my parents, the originals, to the museum in\nWashington, D.C., and -- except for the first and last letter, which we kept. My daughter-in-law\nin Florida has the first and last letters. The first one was particularly meaningful to me, and the\nlast letter from my parents said we have to be at the dorm in Halberstadt -- the dorm being the\nbig church in the center of th -- of town, at something like five o\u2019clock in the morning, or\nsomething -- something very early, and we may take with us only a rucksack. And I understand\nthat all the Jews assembled there, and that was in the last letter from my parents. They had to\nthen give up their keys, their house keys, and they were deported. This was all unknown to us\nbecause my brother and I were in England and we only heard about that later on, after the war,\nand from the little museum in Halberstadt, and they have the information from some of the\nsoldiers in Halberstadt, and that is how they received the names of all the people who were\ndeported. But you know, the Germans were very accurate about their recordkeeping, so they\nhave records of names and so forth, and that is all recorded now on that monument in\nHalberstadt.",
        "A: I believe it was in 1942. And then from where they went we never heard. Maybe there was a\nRed Cross letter, but I\u2019m really not sure. I\u2019m only aware of this particular letter from my parents.\nAnd we were hoping that when the war was over, we would find them maybe in Russia, in\nSiberia, or someplace, but it never happened.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think so. I don\u2019t think they knew where they were going. They just wrote that they all\nhave to be there early in the morning and that was the fine -- the last letter that I have. So the --\nthose two letters are in -- with our son and daughter-in-law in Florida. All the other letters are in\nWashington, D.C., and wis -- the y-young lady in Germany, Jutta Dick, who runs that little\nmuseum, called Moses Mendelssohn academy, she asked for copies of all those letters, and\nreceived them with my okay. So she has the details of all of these letters, which I never read\nagain.",
        "A: Never, no. Only the first and the last. So, I did not want to read all those letters. I found them\nto be very depressing, and it was a subject that in our home, we just did not discuss.",
        "A: The diary, which was started in German, for a long time all the writing was in German, in\ngreen ink, and then it continued later on in blue, I believe, ink, and a completely different\nhandwriting. You would not think it was the same person, and now it\u2019s in English. And very\npositive, that was at the time I was at The Beacon already, when I wrote just a few more pages in\nvery good English and a completely different attitude, a much more positive attitude.",
        "A: Oh, we had a lot of fun with the local boys, we really did. The Beacon girls were very popular\nwith the neighborhood village boys. The Beacon being rather an isolated building on a hill, the\narea is called Rusthall in Tunbridge Wells, and it\u2019s still called The Beacon. It is now like a pub,\nand a bed and breakfast both. So it\u2019s well taken care of by a young couple at this time, because\nafter our reunion of children being in England for 50 years, we went onto The Beacon, and\nvisited The Beacon. And at that time some of the village boys were invited to come over. These\nvillage boys are now in their fi -- 60\u2019s, but we knew them as kids. And they would come and\nvisit us by climbing through the basement window, which was ground level. And when we heard\na matron coming down the stairs, they would jump out of the window and disappear. So we had\na very good, but very innocent time.",
        "A: I believe the year would have been 1946 approximately, because I was now out of the school\nof arts and crafts in Tunbridge Wells, and had to take a job in London. And the young Mr.\nHayward, who was this artist, said to me, would I like to live with them -- of course with the\nokay of his young wife. And I didn't know where I was going to live, so that sounded fine to me.\nThey said they would live -- they were living in the vicinity of London, a little on the outskirts.\nSo then I started my job in London at Jaquemar, this very, very fancy dress house, which gave\nme a very, very good background in basic knowledge of dressmaking, which came in extremely\nuseful later on in my life.",
        "A: The war was -- the war was still going on, yes.",
        "A: Maybe fort -- \u201945 to \u201946 that I stayed with the -- with the Haywards. I don\u2019t know the exact\ndate any more, but I was with them when the war ended, so I was still going to work in London,\nand being that I was working in London at Jaquemar, my brother was also working in London,\nnot too far away, and we would le -- meet at lunchtime, and we would meet at a restaurant called\nLions, Lions Corner House, and my brother would always pay for my lunches. I really d --\nearned very, very little money. It wasn\u2019t even enough to pay for the train fare and staying with\nthe Haywards. But the Haywards had a very positive influence upon my life. For instance, I had\nhad piano lessons in Germany, and they felt that I should continue with my knowledge of music,\nand made arrangements for me to have piano lessons every week, which I did, and I went to high\ns -- to further my education in art, I went to an art school at night. So I would work during the\nday, commute, and then go to an evening art school. So they really influenced my life in\ncontinuing my education, and I was very happy staying with them. They were not at all wealthy.\nThey bought me a men\u2019s bike. I know because it had the bar in between, and we used to visit The\nBeacon, now from London, and we used to bicycle there. It was 35 miles each way. And Alec\nand his wife Agnes had a tandem and I had the single men\u2019s bike. So they were slow going\nuphill, where I would be ahead of them and going downhill they would be much faster. And 35\nmiles in one direction is quite a good trip, but we did this quite regularly and it helped me in\nhaving very strong legs to this day.",
        "A: Yes, the war was still going on, and when the war was over, I was still with the Haywards on\nthe outskirts of London. And I must say one day when I was supposed to take the train after work\nfrom Charing Cross to West Wickham where they lived, I missed the train, which could happen\nwhen you work in London. And that train was hit by a bomb, and they thought I was on it. And I\nguess the good lord felt that I wa -- he wasn\u2019t ready for me, so here I was saved once more, and it\nwas the train that I had taken on a regular basis, and that day I missed it, the train.",
        "A: That was before the war ended, yes, and I was still with the Haywards.",
        "A: When you live in London during the war, you just never knew where the bomb would go off,\nor when a doodlebug stopped whether it would hit you, or the house next door, or -- 1t would be\nnearby, but you were just lucky if you made it. And we spent many, many nights in the air raid\nshelter. The Haywards had a shelter in their home, in the hallway. It was about the size of a ten --\nping pong table, but out of iron, and you would sleep under that ping pong table the moment the\nair raid siren went off. And it was routine. That could be daytime or nighttime. Of course,\neverything was a blackout at all times. No lights from the outside, you could not see which house\nhad a light on. And they had air raid wardens walking around, checking each of the houses. It\nwas a way of life. And in London, many people just bedded down in the underground, which is\nthe subway system. They had bunks, one on top of the other, and parents, rather than dragging\ntheir children out in the middle of the night, would just put them to bed in the subway. And they\nwould be there every night, occupying these beds. There were hundreds and hundreds of them.",
        "A: Yeah -- no, I think I took the life pretty much in stride, like that\u2019s the way it\u2019s meant to be.\nAnd I think even to this day, we are planning to go to Israel next week, and it\u2019s not a very safe\ntime, since we just got over this war maybe two weeks ago. And I feel whenever the hot time is\nto go, that\u2019s it. Meantime, I\u2019m positive about living -- about living every day to the fullest.",
        "A: I remember the huge celebrations in London, but I was not in -- in the center of town then.\nMy only recollection is really that my brother said to me, it is time for us to go to America. Our\nparents said that we will meet them again in America. And we were still hoping that there would\nbe a sign of our parents somewhere. We thought because of lack of communication during the\nwhole war, that maybe they were hiding somewhere. Maybe in Russia or Poland, or somewhere.\nWe did not know. But we were not fortunate. However, many of The Beacon girls were reunited\nwith their parents. Some in America, some in Australia, and different parts of the world.",
        "A: By now I felt very English. I really didn\u2019t want to leave England. But my brother had this\nattitude of being responsible for me, and he said, this 1s what our parents wanted, and that\u2019s what\nwe\u2019re going to do. He really did not give me a choice. I was about 18 by now, and he said, this is\nwhat my par -- our parent\u2019s wishes were, and we\u2019re able to go because now the quota number\nhad come to pass. In other words, we are entitled to go. And my uncle who was in New York had\ngiven us the appropriate visa and my brother made the arrangements for us to go, and I believe\nthat Bloomsbury House paid for part of the voyage by boat to come to America.",
        "A: It was in 1946, that I came to America. I came on a ship called the Drakninghome, and fell in\nlove on the ship with a man from Canada, which sounded very, very far away from New York.\nBut he was much older than I, but it was sort of a quick romance, but that\u2019s as far as it went.",
        "A: Bill, yes. And my husband when he heard about Bill, and that Bill was coming to visit me,\nwas very upset.",
        "A: Yes, the journey was a very happy crossing for me, it was a very broadening experience to\nsay the least, however I was still listening to my mother, which I learned later on what that was\nall about. The journey though, was a very happy one and we finally reached New York, and my\nbrother was here to greet me, he came before I did, and an aunt of mine were at the ship when I\narrived. And I spent the first couple of days at my uncle\u2019s house in Washington Heights. The\nuncle is my mother\u2019s brother, Hans Marcuza. Hans Marcuza was married not too long, and had a\nlittle girl called Barbara. So now I met my first cousin for the first time, and she was just a\ncouple of months old.",
        "A: I was not too pleased. My brother was showing me the skyscrapers and the Hudson and\nsaying how wonderful and how beautiful, but I was used to a simple life in Tunbridge Wells,\nreally the -- a country life, and I found all the brick and stone and the masses of people\noverwhelming.",
        "A: I soon realized that I could not stay with my uncle too long. I think I stayed with him at the\nmost for two weeks. At the time there was a newspaper in New York, and I believe it is still in\nexistence, called Aufbau, A-u-f-b-a-u. The Aufbau also played a role in my life. First day I found\na furnished room in Washington Heights, which cost five dollars a week. So, it was a walk-up\napartment and I just had this tiny little room there on 180\" Street, with a family. And of course, I\nneeded to look for a job. So I went to an unemployment agency, the regular U.S. unemployment\nagency, and there was a very nice gentleman there who was sort of fascinated by my\nbackground, which I did not find particularly fascinating at all. And he helped me to get my first\njob in sketching bridal gowns. S -- my first job was on 85\" Street, very near the mu --\nMetropolitan Museum of Art. And people would explain to me what they want, a dress with lots\nof buttons down the back and puffed sleeves or whatever, and I would sketch it. And I was a\npretty good sketcher, and I had a -- quite a nice background from the school of art in -- in\nTunbridge Wells. And there was a showroom and people who would make the dresses, but my\nparticular job was to sketch. Later on I would get a second job, and a third job, and each one was\nan improvement over the job I had before. I always earned more money, and I did quite well\nmoney-wise. I know I started with 35 dollars a week, and my brother and I thought that that was\nincredible. We thought we were so well-to-do. At that time I guess it was not too bad, because\nmy room was only five dollars, so we did fine. And my brother and I saw each other regularly.\nHe also took a furnished room in Washington Heights, we were near each other. And we were\nalways very, very close in our loving each other, and -- but my brother felt responsible for me.\nAnd it wasn\u2019t too much longer, when I visited my other uncle, Dr. Friedel Lusch, he was a\ngynecologist in New York, on 92 Street and Columbus Avenue. And I went to visit Friedel\nLusch, Uncle Friedel, and there were other people there, a Mrs. Lowenstein and her daughter,\nand a young man, and this young man was Jerry. I thought he might be the husband of the other\nyoung woman, turned out that that was his first cousin, and that was the aunt he lived with when\nhe came to America, also on the kindertransport. And that\u2019s where I first met my husband Jerry,\nand I was only here maybe a month or not much more and Jerry has not left me out of his sight\nfrom then until today, and we are married 58 years.",
        "A: We met in \u00b046, got married in \u201948, had our first child in fi --\nEnd of Tape Two, Side B\nBeginning Tape Three, Side A",
        "A: I came to the United States in 1946, and that is when I met my husband-to-be, Jerry. And in\n1948 we got married. In 1950 we had our first son, Steven, and in 1952 we had our second son,\nRalph. So every two years, an important event happened 1n our lives.",
        "A: I got used to life in America quite quickly, even though my first impulse was not so\nenthusiastic, I got used to the life here, which is of course, much more pleasant than the life that I\nhad been accustomed to in England for all the war years. I had never seen such an abundance of\nfruit and flowers, and wealth that I had seen here, because we grew up in a very modest way,\nwhich I\u2019m not too sorry about because I believe it has given us a different perspective in life,\nknowing what is an important thing in life, and what isn\u2019t. And it\u2019s not the wealth.",
        "A: I never really felt German any more after I lived in England, I got very used to living in\nEngland and would have rather stayed there, but my brother insisted upon coming here.\nHowever, once I met my husband and we were married, I was able to become an American\ncitizen because my husband was in the American army during the war, and I became a citizen\nwithin the first year of our marriage, and I would not change that for anything 1n the world.",
        "A: I don\u2019t remember the exact year, but after 50 years of children coming to England on the\nkindertransport, Bertha Leverton wrote t -- an article in some newspaper, saying she is looking\nfor contributions of letters from youngsters who came to England on the kindertransport, and she\nput together a book. The book is called, \u201cI Came Alone\u201d and it has stories of at least 300 children\nwithin that book. And sh -- then she decided that we should give some sort of acknowledgement\nand thanks to England for having brought us to England for our safety, because without that,\nnone of us would have survived, or maybe very few. But this way, whether we were happy or\nnot, cause some children were and some were not, I was among the luckier ones, but some\nchildren while they were in England were used as maids, some were used as sex objects, they\nwere not all very lucky, and -- with the choice of their guardians. But I got accustomed to living\nin America a -- quite quickly, and that has become our way of life, and of course our children are\nborn in New York, and they don\u2019t know anything else.",
        "A: It was emotional for many of us, because it brought back things that we would just as soon\nnot think about. Everybody was talking about their past, they had groups together who lived in\ndifferent parts of England so that they would have a chance to meet again. And people came\nfrom different parts of the world to this particular reunion in London. And that was the beginning\nof other chapters of the kindertransport starting up. There is an organization in New York called\nkindertransport link, I believe. They have a newsletter for all the people who were children who\ncame to the New York area. But that happened also in California and in Florida. So they have\ndifferent groups of people getting together on a regular basis, who were all children who came to\nEngland with the kindertransport.",
        "A: We did. Those of us who were there from The Beacon, that might have been about 12 or 15\nBeacon girls and their husbands, because now, most people were married and with children at\nthis ti -- point. So, many husbands came along, and we all visited The Beacon for one day. It was\nclosed to the public, and of course it was written up in many newspapers. But The Beacon still\nexists, and it brought back a lot of memories, because that which are now elegant dining rooms\nwith tables and white tablecloths, and very, very pretty, and a beautiful setting, that was our\ndormitory, that was our room, and that\u2019s where the Rusthall boys came to visit us. So it brought\nback a lot of memories.",
        "A: At least 50, in different -- different ages, and they were divided up into junior, middles and\nseniors. I started as a middle and ended as a senior.",
        "A: By the time I got to the U.S., there was little hope, because we had not heard anything. But\nwe heard from s -- some people -- I mentioned the name Ruth Lindheimer in Halberstadt, the girl\nI went to school with, she was in England also with the kindertransport, but her father was in\nNew York, and he was in the American army, he served in the war. And Ruth\u2019s father knew of\nother people from Halberstadt who are also living in New York, so he had some contact with\nother people. And they somehow received a list which was published in the Aufbau newspaper.\nAnd in that list, which a soldier had on him, the soldier had the list of these people, an American\nsoldier, I believe, and he gave it to the Aufbau, the Aufbau published it. It had the names of all\nthe people who were transported to Warsaw, which we did not know, we never really knew\nwhere they were transported to.",
        "A: Mm-hm, right.",
        "A: [indecipherable]. We actually never found out anything else. We don\u2019t know a specific date\nwhen they were possibly killed, but we just don\u2019t know. All we know is the monument which 1s\nin Halberstadt at the dome where all the Jewish people had to assemble to be deported, and it has\nthe date of birth, and it doesn\u2019t have a date of death.",
        "A: Went to Warsaw. It went to Warsaw, they all went to Warsaw, that\u2019s all we know. What -- we\n-- we don\u2019t know any details after that and I don\u2019t think that there were even any Red Cross\nletters, any more from the camp. But in my -- the last letter from parents, they wrote that Oma in\nStargard, the -- that\u2019s the other grandmother, and her daughter, were also deported to Poland, but\nwe don\u2019t know any details. We also don\u2019t know what happened to Opa in Halberstadt, the one\nwho lived above us. I believe he was sent to like a nursing home, but we were trying to find his\ngrave when we were there a few years ago, and we could not find it. We found the grave of his\nwife, Zelma Cohn, and it\u2019s in the Jewish cemetery in Halberstadt. It\u2019s written in Hebrew, and a\nrabbi, a present rabbi from Berlin made a rubbing of the gravestone and sent us the translation,\nwhich was really quite warm and heartwarming. So that was Zelma Cohn, born Lusch. And that\ngravestone is there in Halberstadt, but we could not find Opa, Hugo Cohn, we don\u2019t know where\nhe was buried.",
        "A: When I was about two or three years old. So that was a normal burial.",
        "A: There wasn\u2019t really any one particular day or one particular time. The only thing that we\nknow concrete is the list of names that they were deported. So we know they were there, and we\nknow very few survivors came from Warsaw. We just never heard.",
        "A: Mm-hm, yes. The last picture I have is the picture in Halberstadt on the day that I departed on\nthe kindertransport. And my parents came with me until Hanover, where the actual train, which\nwas a locked train, they just took the children for the transport, no parents were allowed on the\nplatform at that time.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: My parents sent it to England just as soon as I got there. They sent it to the Allens, and I left\nGermany with a considerable number of old photographs, family photographs. They have been\ncopied and reproduced, and a -- the copies are in the little museum in Halberstadt at the Moses\nMendelssohn academy. But I have the originals right here.",
        "A: Yes, I always felt that that is my heritage, that these were the most precious things to me, and\nthese are items that cannot be reproduced, I mean, if I would lose them. And I thought I did this\nyear, because I had the young lady from Halberstadt visiting us here in New York, we were\nsitting at this same table in our apartment, and we went through my history and so forth. And\nwhen she left, I was looking for the family album, and I couldn't find it. So I called Germany\nfrantically, and yes indeed, she took the whole album, with all these original pictures, and I was\nvery, very upset, and told her so, but she said, well I needed to make copies of them, and how\nelse could I make copies? She took the whole book, and I\u2019m glad to say, it\u2019s back in my hands.",
        "A: The diary which we referred to before, I forgot that I had that, and it showed up quite\nunexpectedly about -- what it\u2019s -- 1987, that\u2019s many, many years after we -- I was in America, I\ncame over in about \u00b046, I came to America. So until \u201987, we moved into the present apartment\nwhere we are, and by -- in the move, I came across this diary, which I had forgotten that I had,\nand I though to myself, oh gee, if my children ever see this old book, and the hat I wore when I\nleft my parents on the day I came to England, I kept the diary and the hat. Why, I don\u2019t know.\nAnd I showed it to our children on a particular Passover when the whole family was together, I\nsaid, \u201cI came across these items and someday you\u2019re going to say, why did my mother keep this\nold hat?\u201d I said, \u201cWell that\u2019s the hat I wore when I left Germany.\u201d And I donated that hat to the\nmuseum in Washington, D.C.. I understand it\u2019s on show there with the picture of my wearing the\nhat.",
        "A: Yes, I am not one to go back over old letters or old things too happily, because it sometimes\nbrings back unhappy memories. So I would just as soon not really read the old letters, but one\nday I translated the whole diary into English, because if my children wanted to know what it was\nin that diary, they wouldn\u2019t understand the German. So I translated it page for page, and marked\neach page with the number where you can find it in the actual diary.",
        "A: Well, the English and German is not a problem for me because both languages are identical. I\nhave no problems speaking either one, but emotionally it brings back things that I\u2019d just as soon\nnot think about.",
        "A: I believe so. I don\u2019t believe in dwelling on difficult or bad times. I would rather think about\nthe positive, but that\u2019s the way I am, it\u2019s the -- my nature.",
        "A: No, didn\u2019t talk about it at all. Our children were born in New York. We lived in a small house\nin Middle Village, and they grew up with all the other neighborhood American children. Went to\nschool at the public school in -- in the park, very close to home. And actually the conversation\nnever came up, even though my husband and I both speak German fluently, we really did not use\nthe German language. My husband was also born in Germany, he was born in Gottingen, but at\nhome we just spoke English, with one exception. When Jerry\u2019s mother, my husband\u2019s mother\ncame to America after the war and I met her, she didn't speak English, she would speak German.\nAnd I always understood it, but I hadn\u2019t used the language for so many years in England. So she\nwould say well, why don\u2019t you answer me in German? And I really hesitated to speak German,\nbut the more she insisted and the more she spoke German, I understood everything, and\neventually I would speak to her, so the children would hear a little German here and there, when\n-- you know, when the grandmother came to visit, which was every weekend. But my husband\nand I only speak English at home. But a ga -- regarding whether we spoke about our childhood\nand kindertransport, I didn\u2019t. I don\u2019t think the children were even aware of any of this, except\nthat we visited the Allens with the children when they were about five and six years old, we went\nto England and visited the Allens, who were, of course, very, very proud to have me back and to\nsee our children, and they were very, very kind to us. And at one time they came to America and\nvisited us in our little house in Middle Village. So there was always this connection, and I told\nyou that I am still in touch with the granddaughter, very much so. And just a year ago the\ngranddaughter, with her seven children, came to visit our son in Connecticut, and then to our\nhouse. So it\u2019s like part of my life is definitely in England.",
        "A: I don\u2019t know that it was deliberate, except for the fact that I wanted the children to have a\nvery happy childhood, and I didn't believe in burdening them with anything that was an\nunpleasant past. But the time did come when they started posing questions. And the first question\nI remember, the boys are only 14 months apart in age, one of them saying at Thanksgiving time,\nthey were now in public school, saying, everybody is going to their grandmother\u2019s and\ngrandfather\u2019s house, why don\u2019t we have grandparents? So now the question came from the\nchildren, and I told them in short that there was this bad man in Germany, and because of that I\ncame to England, and I said, you know, Pop and Ma in England, and of course they did, because\nthey had visited and they knew them very well by now. And I said, well that\u2019s why I came to\nEngland. But I would make it very short, I never dwelt on it, and neither did my husband. It was\njust, when they asked a question they got a real answer, but we never talked much about politics,\nwe just wanted them to have a happy childhood.",
        "A: All right. Well, it\u2019s just a -- a little over a year ago, in 2005, and we\u2019re now in 2006, I\nreceived a phone call from this woman in Halberstadt, Jutta Dick at the Moses Mendelssohn\nacademy, and she said, \u201cLilly, I had a phone call from somebody called Horst Hesser, do you\nknow Horst Hesser?\u201d And I said, no, I don\u2019t. She said, \u201cDo you know Horst?\u201d So I thought about\nit, and I said, \u201cWell the only Horst I know is the doll I had. My little doll I played with in -- in\nGermany was a boy doll, and his name was Horst.\u201d I said, \u201cThat\u2019s the only Horst I know.\u201d But I\nmust have called that Horst after -- that doll after somebody, somebody I liked, but I couldn\u2019t\nremember. She said, \u201cWell, Horst Hesser is trying to reach you, and he says he has some items\nthat belong to you.\u201d I said, \u201cNo, that can\u2019t be, I -- I just don\u2019t know anybody.\u201d So she said,\n\u201cWell, he said he has certain belongings from your parents and he has looked for you all his life,\nand he just found you through the internet, through the computer.\u201d Well, apparently Horst Hesser\nhas a son-in-law and he is very creative with the computer and Horst has said to him at various\ntimes, could you put in the name of either Vanna Cohn or Lilly Cohn and see what happens. And\nover the years, nothing happened. And Horst said that when he went to Halberstadt, he would\nalways ask, what happened to that family, Cohn, and anyone he would ask would say, we don\u2019t\nknow, or we\u2019d rather not talk about that. So this time this son-in-law put in the name Lilly Cohn,\nHalberstadt, and it came out that it said, Lilly Cohn, Halberstadt 1s now Lillyan Rosenberg, tour\nguide in New York. So he was extremely excited and went to see his father-in-law and told him,\nI think I found her. So one thing led to another, they contacted the guide association in New\nYork and said, do you know Lillyan Rosenberg? And they said, oh sure we do, because of\ncourse, they speak different languages and I did tours in German. They said she was president of\nthe multilingual guide association. He said, well how can we reach her? So they told him how\nthey could reach me, and that is how Horst called Halberstadt and she told me to get in touch\nwith Horst. So now I called him, and one f -- morning I called, and of course my German is\nfluent, and I said to him, \u201cHere is Lilly Cohn.\u201d And he said, \u201cAre you the little girl I played\nwith?\u201d I said, \u201cI don\u2019t know, I can\u2019t remember.\u201d He said, \u201cWell, if you are the one,\u201d he said, \u201cour\nparents were very good friends and they used to have coffee and cake at your house, and you and\nI would play under the table and do some crayoning or play.\u201d I must have been all of seven years\nold at the time. And sh -- he said, \u201cWhile I am speaking to you, I have paintings in front of me,\nand these paintings were done by your mother, and they have your mother\u2019s signature.\u201d And so I\nsaid, \u201cThat can\u2019t be.\u201d He said, \u201cYes, I have several items from your parents.\u201d And he told me\nthat his father and my father were doing business together. So I believe that after my father\u2019s\nstore was closed, he still sold linens by going to people\u2019s houses, or business, I don\u2019t know. But\nwith a suitcase I remember him getting on the train and that was after the store was closed,\nbefore concentration camp. So apparently he knew this family well. So ma -- now --",
        "A: They now live in a different town called Schwerin, but at the time, his father and my parents\nlived like 10 miles apart. He -- the father of Horst and family, they lived outside of Halberstadt, a\nreal farm country. Like we have Pennsylvania Dutch, real country. There\u2019d be one house here,\nand a half a mile away, another house. That\u2019s how his parents lived. So apparently, during the\nwar, my father said to Horst\u2019s father, would you come and get some of our precious belongings\nin case we ever have to leave our home and would you hold them for safekeeping? So\napparently, Horst\u2019s father, at great risk to his own life, came in the middle of the night with, I\nthink a horse and buggy, and took furniture and carpeting and silver and paintings, a s -- little\nstatue, and various items from my parent\u2019s home, and he drove them during the night because\nnobody would see him where they live, and he hid them in a barn. So these items were hidden in\na barn all the war years. And of course, eventually, my parents had to leave home, their ho -- our\nhome. And after the war, Horst\u2019s father said to his two sons, who were now teenagers, \u201cWe have\nbelongings from a Jewish family, the family Cohn, and I\u2019m trying to find them, and if I don\u2019t\nfind them, I want you to promise me that you will always look for them, and we have to return\nthese items to that family.\u201d So I couldn\u2019t believe what was happening. But it was just a year ago\nin July that we made arrangements then to come to Halberstadt and that Horst and his wife\nwould come to Halberstadt, and then my husband was coming with me, of course. And the two\nsons said, \u201cWell then, we\u2019ll go too, because if you\u2019re going, we\u2019ll go.\u201d And the three\ngrandchildren said, \u201cWell if you\u2019re all going, we want to go, too.\u201d So on July of nine -- of 2 -\n\u201805, we all arranged to be in Germany. So it was the two sons, one daughter-in-law, and the three\ngrandchildren and my husband and I, we all went to Halberstadt and we met Horst and his wife.\nThey are also in their 70\u2019s, like I am, but he\u2019s a little bit older, and they\u2019re a very charming\ncouple. And we spent a few days with them in Halberstadt. And there were great festivities, if\none may call it that, because there was the press, and television and newscasters, all at the\nmuseum where this took place. And some students, and outsiders. It got a tremendous lot of\npublicity and Horst returned the paintings to me, and a whole set of silverware with the initial C\nfor Cohn, and a little statue. It took quite awhile, but eventually it reached our home in New\nYork, and we are now blessed to have the paintings and the silver and the statue in our home.",
        "A: Well, I was once in Germany when I was working at the German national tourist office, and I\nacco-companied American tourists to Germany, and I was more or less the interpreter.",
        "A: In 19 -- approximately 1974. I worked at the ger -- German tourist office for five years and\ngave advice to American travel agents and tourists who were thinking of going to Germany. Of\ncourse, I don\u2019t remember Germany as such, I only know the map, and I studied that. But\neventually I had to take American travel agents to Germany, and I would have a local tour guide\nover there explaining things to me in German, and I in turn interpreted it into English.",
        "A: I decided that I will think of it as if I was in Scandinavia, because it was all strange to me\nanyway, and I did not like the idea of going to Germany, and on my own, I would not have gone.\nBut that was business, and I did what I had to do, and it was successful.",
        "A: At times very much so, because --\nEnd of Tape Three, Side A\nBeginning Tape Three, Side B",
        "A: I did not go to Germany voluntarily, but since it was part of my job, I decided that if I didn\u2019t\ndo it, somebody else would be doing it. And we visited a synagogue in Worms in Germany, and\nmy question was to the guide who showed us around, who was wearing a yarmulke, you know,\nskullcap, a-are there any Jews who ever come here? And he said no, there were no Jews who\ncame to Worms, but they built a token synagogue like a goodwill, restitution thing. But the\nsynagogue is used at times by American soldiers who are stationed in the vicinity. So it was used\nthere, but otherwise there were no Jews who came back to Worms, which was a very active\nJewish community before the war.",
        "A: Right.",
        "A: Well, very often they would ask me political questions. Now that I was dealing with them --\nwith German tourists in America. But I -- I would turn that around very quickly by saying, my\njob 1s to tell you about America, and I want to tell you about the Empire State building, or the\nChrysler building, or whatever, and I never really went into my background. It was only once,\nwhen German tourists introduced themselves on one of my longer tours, where I have people\ncoming up to the mic, and they say, I was a teacher in Frankfurt, and the other one says, oh I\u2019m\nalso from Frankfurt, so they got to know each other. And this one woman said she\u2019s from\nHalberstadt. So that took me by surprise, and I didn\u2019t know just how to handle that. And I did not\ntell her that I was born there until the last day when I took them to Kennedy airport. I decided on\nmy way there that I would dec -- would tell her about it. And I asked her what kind of work they\nwere doing, and she said, we made uniforms in Halberstadt. So I wasn't too happy, and I did not\nwant that to be the conversation on the whole tour, because I\u2019m dealing with Germans, and\nAustralians, or Austrians and English, they could all be in one bus, but I really didn\u2019t want to\nhave that as a conversation piece. So in general I avoided having these kind of conversations.",
        "A: We got this letter from Jutta Dick from the Moses Mendelssohn academy in Halberstadt,\nGermany, saying we would like to invite you to come over to -- to Germany, and this was\napproximately year 2000, approximately. And she said, would we be willing to address some of\nthe students of the vicinity, and it was mainly because of the diary I kept, because I sent a copy\nof the diary, I think it\u2019s about 66 pages, I sent a copy to the museum in Halberstadt, because\nthey\u2019re trying to show what life was like in that community. And that tagabu, this diary of mine,\nwhich I have right here, became a textbook for the students in the area. And they studied my\nbackground and the way of life in Halberstadt. So she asked if I would address students and\ncome over there and s -- that they could a -- meet somebody and speak to me directly. So my\nfriend Ruth Oppenheimer, who I mentioned before, and her husband, and my husband Jerry and\nI, and one lady from Israel, her naveda -- name is Judith Beerun, and she goes to Halberstadt fr --\nquite frequently from Israel, she is older than I am. We were all in Halberstadt together, and we\nhad interviews, mostly at the museum and sometimes at a school where students of a -- an age\nabout 16 to 20 -- not the youn -- very youngest, could ask questions, anything they wanted. And\nbeing that my German is quite fluent, they -- they would speak to me and give -- and I would\nanswer their questions. I also offered them that if they had any questions that they could write to\nme and I would answer their letters, which indeed I did. One of the letters which is outstanding\nin my mind is where a young student wrote to me, of course all in German, I was born in\nGermany, and wherever I go in the world, wherever my parents and I travel, people always refer\nto us as Nazis. What can I do about it? After all, I wasn\u2019t even born. What can I help what my\ngrandfather may have done, and so forth. So I gave it quite a bit of thought how to answer such a\nletter. And I wrote back and I answered every letter, but this came up in several versions. And I\nsaid, you know, you are not responsible for things that happened before you were born. But\nyou\u2019re very responsible for all the decisions you make in your lifetime. And therefore, all I can\ntell you is that you do not have to feel guilty for things that happened before your time, but be\nvery sure that whatever decisions you make in your life will be the right decision, and not only\nbecause of the majority doing it. So I ho-hope that I gave the youngsters the proper advice.",
        "A: I must carry on for what I just said. I feel that the young people are not responsible for that\nwhich happened before their time. I look at the old people in a different way. And yet I feel life\nmust go on, and we must be positive. I cannot say that one can ever forget the type of childhood\nthat I had because of the loss of my parents. I cannot forgive them for that, but I cannot hold it\nagainst all the Germans, because I think they\u2019re doing the best they can to help Israel, and I have\nfound many, many positive things, including some very, very good people, including this Horst\nand his wife. They had, for instance, the various pieces of silver for my parents, which my\nparents might have hidden somewhere, I don\u2019t know, and that was distributed among the various\nmembers of the family. And yet when they heard that we were coming to Germany, they all gave\nit back and we have all these things from all the various members. So there are many good\npeople, and we have to realize that and go ahead.",
        "A: I believe he was first in the Hitlerjugen -- youth -- children\u2019s you -- Hitler youth, and later on\nhe was in the German army, and he was imprisoned. And he is quite a character, and when we\nvisited him in Schwerin, which is where they live now, there\u2019s this old castle, and he showed us\nthe castle, and he said, I was imprisoned 1n that castle and I jumped out of the window over there\nand trotted for miles and miles and miles along the train track. And he told us the weirdest\nstories. I mean, he\u2019s quite a character, but they\u2019re very, very good people. Yes, he was in the\nGerman army, and it wasn\u2019t until the war was over that his father told his sons that they have the\nitems belonging to my family.",
        "A: Well, when I first saw the painting, when we met Horst last year, I realized that I had a\nphotograph from my parent\u2019s home, because I had quite a few old photographs, but on that one\nphotograph is the living room of my parents, and in the corner of the living room, on the one\ncorner, is this big painting, and that is the painting that he had, and another, smaller one. Also, I\nhad one painting in my suitcase for the Allens, so it was a pr -- a pr -- a present from my mother\nto the Allens when I came to England, so there was always one small painting, which is in our\nson\u2019s house, the Allens gave it to me. And now we have the two big paintings which Horst gave\nus, and of course it has changed our whole atmosphere in our home, they just look like they\nbelong there.",
        "A: The one which my son in Connecticut has is of the Hartz mountains, and it\u2019s a river and going\nover a lot of stones and just countryside. The other one 1s -- the very large one, 1s a big church in\nStargard in Pommern. Horst\u2019s wife did some research by going to various libraries to locate\nwhich church could that be, and she located it as the church in Stargard in Pommern. And the\nsmaller picture is the fish mart in Halberstadt, which is still there now. There is a round fountain\nin the center of town, and that seems to be quite a landmark with Bucco from Halberstadt in the\nbackground on the new town hall. Because the new town hall was bombed, but they must have\nhad Bucco hidden somewhere, Bucco 1s still there.",
        "A: No, just e -- no --",
        "A: We came from Berlin a -- because we met our children in Berlin since the whole family was\njoining us to meet Horst. I had never been back to hal -- oh no, I had been in Halberstadt when\nwe spoke to the students, and I was very much afraid that I would feel very badly when I would\nsee my parent\u2019s home. But when we got to my parent\u2019s home, and they told me this is\nWestendorf, and the exact address, the post office is still there, but vis-a-vis the post office where\nmy parent\u2019s home was is now a very ugly building which was built by the Russians in their style\nof building, which was very unattractive. Like a factory type house. So I did not associate with\nthat building at all. I had no feeling for that building at all. So that which I was afraid of, never\nhappened.",
        "A: Absolutely. And it -- 1t was an absolute surprise, but I must say, it was one of the more\npleasant surprises in my lifetime. Cause no one could have ever predicted that over 70 years\nwould -- would come -- go by and someone would come up and say, I have belongings from\nyour parents. I mean, it was something that I could not have even dreamt up. It\u2019s just so\nunpredictable. And then they turned out to be such warm and kind people. So that I speak to\nHorst every week, even it\u2019s a year now that we are back from over there. And his son-in-law\nwrites to us on the email, so we know what is happening. In fact, my husband and I are trying to\nfigure out what we can do for them, and we\u2019ve come up with various suggestions. We\u2019d like\nthem to come and visit us, for instance, in New York, but he has said it\u2019s too far, his doctor\nwould not let him fly that far. So then we came up with different suggestions, but we have not\ngotten together yet. I think eventually we will fly to Germany and invite them somewhere, or\nmaybe meet again in Halberstadt, something like that.",
        "A: Mm-hm. Yes, I feel much more relaxed about going back to Germany. By choice I would\nhave never gone, but when we were fir -- invited to go there to speak to the students, I felt that\nthat could be my contribution to history. To do something, to let them know that this 1s not just a\nstory, that this is indeed true, cause here I am, and you can speak to me. And I told the students\nthen, if it had not been for Hitler and the Nazi period, I would be one of them. I would have lived\nhere possibly for the rest of my life. But because of destiny, it was different, and I had no control\nover that.",
        "A: Oh they -- my fa -- father said, nothing can happen to us. After all, I served in World War I. I\nwas on the front, I was a -- a soldier, I fought for the Fatherland. That couldn\u2019t -- nothing could\nhappen to us. But we all know that that\u2019s not the way it was, but they felt very German, just like I\nfeel Iam an American, and I\u2019m sure that my children feel a hundred percent American, they\nwere born here. But our parents felt the same way about Germany. They did not feel different.\nThey had been in Germany for hundreds of years. And they felt that n -- they -- they were\nGermans, just like we are Americans.",
        "A: Yeah. Well, when I met Horst, I said to him, the only picture I actually remember from my\nchildhood is a picture of Moses. And to the best of my knowledge, the whole picture, in my\nmind, was done in Hebrew letters. Because I can remember standing in front of that picture,\nsince I was always interested in art, saying how can somebody make a picture by using only\nletters? So that\u2019s what I remembered about the picture. So he said, \u201cOh, you mean the Moses\npicture with the 10 commandments?\u201d I said yes. I said, \u201cThat\u2019s the only thing -- I wonder where\nthat is, because if it\u2019s only in Hebrew letters, there can\u2019t be many of those around, it must be\nsomewhere.\u201d So he said, \u201cOh, my sister had it. She gave it to the Jewish museum in Berlin.\u201d And\nthat\u2019s the old Jewish museum, not the [indecipherable], it\u2019s called -- has another name,\nsomething or other [indecipherable] in -- in Berlin it was behind the wall when the wall was still\nup. So --",
        "A: No, it was at the old j -- at the old synag -- at the old synagogue, the alt [indecipherable]",
        "A: Not the new one.",
        "A: Not the new one. It\u2019s a combination of synagogue and museum. If you want Ill look up the\nname of the mu -- museum late -- of the synagogue later. So, I contacted that particular museum\nand was in touch with Dr. Simon and told him that I am the sole survivor of my parents fa --\ndirect family, and I heard that the picture has been donated to the synagogue, or the museum, and\nI would like them to know that I am here, and I would like to have the picture returned. He was\nvery, very evasive. Eventually I made an appointment with him to meet with him while we were\non our trip to Europe last year when we met Horst. And I made a date to meet him at the museum\nwith Jutta. And I spent a whole hour with him. I said, look, I have sent you my birth certificate,\nwhich is from Halberstadt and you know that my parents are Ernst, Marguerita Cohn, and you\nknow that the picture was given to you by Horst\u2019s sister. And he never denied having the picture,\nbut for almost a year we have been talking back and forth. And he told me then that the museum\nhas never returned anything to anyone, because if they would return that picture, then other\npeople would re -- want their belongings back, too. I didn't see it in the museum because I think\nthey had it in a cellar somewhere, it was not exhibited. We tried very, very hard for him to give it\nup. Jutta would go over fr-from Halberstadt and collect it, and there were all kinds of legal things\nback and forth. Eventually our son from Florida contacted his senator, who contacted the\nAmerican consulate in Berlin. And the American consulate in Berlin contacted Dr. Simon and\nsaid, why are you not returning this to Lillyan Rosenberg? She 1s an immediate heir of that\npainting. Then he softened a little bit, he did not want to have problems with the American\ngovernment, because now the government got involved. And a little while ago, approximately\nfour weeks ago, he said it -- a yo -- to the man at the American consulate in Berlin that all Jutta\nhas to do is make an arrangement with him and come and pick it up. So Jutta has picked it up, it\nis now in Halberstadt and will be on view at the little museum of the Moses Mendelssohn\nacademy for awhile, and then we will make arrangements to have it shipped to our home.",
        "A: No, this -- no, this is not done by my mother, it\u2019s just a picture that I remember from my\nparent\u2019s home. And the picture is not the picture the way I remembered it, but you know, I was a\nchild and it\u2019s many, many years ago. But I do remember the Hebrew, and the 10 commandments.\nSo I am not sure that this is the picture that I was describing. But we decided my parents could\nhave more than one picture which they have given away, and -- so we -- we d -- I don\u2019t know for\nsure if that is the picture that I had in my mind. It is, however, Moses and the 10 commandments.",
        "A: Yes. And this way it gives some publicity to the area. And the little museum is doing very\nwell. It\u2019s getting tourists from all over the world. And one of the things that the little museum has\nbeen able to do -- for instance, when Jutta was here in New York about four weeks ago, and she\nstayed with us, she told me that one of the professors from a university here in New York, her\nfamily is from Halberstadt, she thought she was alone in the world. Her back -- background, her\nfamily name was h -- Hirsch. Because there was Hirsch Kupva and Hirsch something else in\nHalberstadt. So when she got in touch with Jutta, Jutta told her, you know, you have a lot of\nmembers of your family in Israel, which she did not know. So this woman by the name of\nHirsch, here in New York, did not know that she had family in Israel. They all met again in\nHalberstadt. So the little museum there is getting people together from different parts of the\nworld. And this year they invited grandchildren, that would have been like our age\ngrandchildren, to come there and write about genealogy of their family. So they\u2019re doing a lot of\ngood things in this little town.",
        "A: In different parts of the world, yes, and all over. I mean, they are just scattered. I believe the --\na family from the Rabbi Owerbach, that family is in Israel. But of course, I\u2019ve lost contact with\nmost people, but through a reunion in Halberstadt, or the kindertransport reunion, people do find\neach other.",
        "A: No, unfortunately I only have the picture of the doll called Horst. And one of the newspapers\nin Florida put the title, a doll called Horst, and had two full pages on the story of the reunion with\nHorst and myself.",
        "A: I look at that as though my life, which I didn\u2019t think was so -- so unusual, because when I\nhave a -- neighbors here, and they say, oh you have such an interesting life, and I\u2019d say where\nwere you from? Brooklyn. I\u2019d say, I wish I was born in Brooklyn. I don\u2019t want such an\ninteresting life. But now that it is the way it 1s, I would like it to be a contribution to history, so\nthat no one will ever doubt what has happened to children like myself. And on a positive vein, I\nwould say that of all the people I know who have grown up under very difficult conditions and I\ns -- look at their family and their children, they have all done a very good job with their sons and\ndaughters, and most of them are professionals and doing very, very well. So I believe we\u2019ve been\nable to teach them very good values.",
        "A: Yes, I believe so, even though I think children of kindertransport parents feel that they are\noverly protected. That is a complaint we get from all the children. They will say my mother\nwants to know where I am, my father wants to know where I am, they\u2019re always keeping tabs on\nus. That might be some of our insecurity of people like myself. But when I watch my children,\nwho now have teenage children, they\u2019re doing the same thing with theirs -- children, they\u2019re\nbringing them up the same way, and I must say I\u2019m glad about that.",
        "A: I would say yes, because it\u2019s not a subject that I dwell upon at all, I look at the future.\nAlthough, we already pretty old, there prob -- I don\u2019t know how much future there is, but we\nlook at it in a positive way. And the past seems to have its very emotional moments. I know that\nwhen we spoke about the time I was told to leave the Allen\u2019s house, how upsetting that was for\nme. I think that that was equally upsetting as leaving my parent\u2019s home.",
        "A: I don -- I cannot really answer that with a yes or no ques -- statement. I know that I feel\nabsolutely Jewish, you could not change me. But I think we\u2019re also very tolerant of all other\nreligions. We have the two sons, one became very religious, and one married a girl who became\nJewish, as I told you. So we brought them up in a modest way, not in a kosher home, but they\nlearned about their background by going to Hebrew school. They were Bar Mitzvahed, they had\nJewish weddings. They keep a different kind of home, the one in Connecticut, Ralph and his\nwife, they have a kosher home. Steven and Susan and Miranda have the average kind of home\nlike we have. But we do keep all holidays and we try to get together as a family at least once a\nyear and that is on Passover, so that we are at one table with both sons. That was my request to\nboth daughter-in-laws when they got married.",
        "A: I think you have delved into my life quite deeply, and if I can be useful to others because of\nmy past, then I will feel it\u2019s my little contribution to this world, apart from having a wonderful\nhusband and two great sons. We\u2019ve made the best of every possible situation. And I thank you\nfor the time you\u2019ve spent with me.\n"
