        "Q: Why don't you tell me your name?",
        "A: My name is Selma Engel. Wijnberg is my, my maiden name. And my parents \u2014 you want \u2014\nyeah?",
        "Q: Where were you born?",
        "A: I was born in Groningen. But we lived all these years. I was seven years old, we went to\nZwolle. That's a other city. And there we lived till I, went to Po\u2014 till I went away, when the\nwar started.",
        "Q: What year were you born?",
        "A: 1922.",
        "Q: Can you tell me a little bit what it was like in the town where you were born and grew up?",
        "A: Yes, in Holland it was very nice to live. It was something like I live now, like the children\ngrowing up in Brandford, Connecticut. I had only not-Jewish friends. I had a few Jewish\nfriends; and, it was very assimilated. The way the Jews really lived was that we had \u2014 the\nJudaism was more in the house. I mean we lived in the country, so it was more in the house\nand, and not outside. So, I don't know how to explain it, we, we didn't go with \u2014 nobody\nwent with beards or with peyos\u2019. Something like that, we didn't see it. But life was very nice\nin Holland. was not antisemitism. Was no antisemitism, and my parents had a hotel. They\nhad a kosher hotel, and they had the only kosher hotel in the state where we lived in.\nLike Holland 1s all divided in states, and it was the state of Overijssel; and so a lot of Jewish\npeople came to our hotel because we had also \u2014 it was a small hotel. It was on a cattle\nmarket; and we lived \u2014 a part of \u2014 most, most the business came from the cattle market, as is\ntypical in Europe. It's not so much here. And so we had a lot of Jewish salesmen. They slept\nover in our hotel. So it was a lot of Judaismic, and Jewish people came always to the hotel.\nAnd also when there was a kosher, wedding party or something like that came, that was\nalways catered in our hotel. So a lot of Jewish life went on in our hotel. My mother was very\nreligious. My father was not that religious; but we had to be religious because we had a\nkosher hotel and that goes together with it.\n' earlocks worn by Hasidic Jews (Hebrew)",
        "Q: , and you went to school?",
        "A: I went to school, the elementary school; and then I went to high school. And the war broke\nout when I was not even eighteen years old. So I finished high school, and then, was \u2014 that\nwas the end because right away we were not allowed to go to school. We were not allowed\nto go work. We were not allowed to do anything. That was, that was the first thing what the\nGerman did in Holland, to take us out from, from learning and anything. I started working, in\na hospital, in the hospital, because I, I couldn't sit home and do nothing. And I start working\nin the beginning in the hospital, and cooking for Jewish patients. But that was, after a short\ntime that was also was not allowed anymore. Like in '41, that was not allowed anymore. So,\nthen I started helping all the Jewish people. I remember in that time we had already a star \u2014\nwe had to wear a star. And, I went to another \u2014 I took the star off. I always was a little bit\nagainst. And I took the star off, and I went with the train to another town and helped an older\nfamily, an older couple, what they were not allowed to have any help anymore from not-\nJewish people. And we were not allowed to do really anything at all. So, that was a very\nshort time. Also my, my, my father died on a heart attack in 1941; and on May the 10th the\nwar broke out in Holland. The Germans came into Holland on May the 10th, and the war\nwas only five days. I had two brothers what were in the, in the army. And it was a very\nnervous atmosphere, because we had a lot of Jewish people in the hotel because a Friday \u2014\nfrom Friday or Saturday the war started and they stayed\u2014there were a lot of Jewish people\nwould stay overnight\u2014and they stayed 1n our hotel, and everybody was tremendously \u2014 was\npanicky.\nVery panicky right away, and because they know what was in Germany happened. It was\nnext to the, the border was next to where we lived. You know, Holland is very small. And\nso, they, they, they run away and some\u2014we have a lot of water in Holland \u2014 the Ijssel was a\nbig river, and they left the car in the water. They drove them in the water, and they went\nfarther together; because they thought that the German cannot take it. So it was a big panic.\nAnd after five days \u2014 well, there was a lot of traitors in Holland so the war didn't took long in\nHolland. After five days the war was over. And they didn't start right away, the Germans.\nThey did it very slowly on; because they know that they cannot do it like it was in Poland,\nright away, and in Germany perhaps. But they did it very slowly on, and very often \u2014 very \u2014\nthey did it in a way that no \u2014 nobody felt really that there was something going on and it\nwould happen something, serious things.",
        "Q: What happened, with the hotel, or what did you begin to notice?",
        "A: In 1941, there was a club in Holland, and it was a men's club. Very sophisticated, for\nlawyers; and, and the German right away took that building. So one of the head of the police\nand the owner from that men's club came to my mother and say, you know, \"Why don't you\ngo out of the hotel, so the Germans don't take it. And we take your hotel and that you will\nsave.\" And my mother was very upset, of course. They really\u2014 my father died, what I told\nyou \u2014 they really built that hotel by themselves, really built it. And to leave everything, just\nto go out what you have in your hand, was very hard. So I don't remember exactly what was\ngoing on. I know after many talking with the police and with this man, the owner, my mother\nhad to go out of the hotel and could just take with her\u2014they talked her into it, perhaps it was\nthe best-they could just go out of the hotel. And there was another Jewish family in our\nhome town what, had a little house, very poor little house in a very poor area, and, we moved\nin that little house in. But I have to tell \u2014 yeah \u2014 it was already \u2014 we moved into the hotel in\nand in that little house in, and, and it was horrible. There was no hot water and there was no\nbathroom and it was a very poor neighborhood and I really hated it, I remember; and it was a\nvery difficult time because, you were not allowed to go out and you hear the German already\nwalking through your door. And also one day the German took all the people what went over\nto another religion, like there were was a Jewish boy by the name Wynberg and he went over\nto the Catholic religion, and they picked up all the people what went over to the, the Jews\nwhat went over to the Catholic religion. So they didn't know \u2014 they picked my mother and\nmy two brothers and me. My oldest brother was married. I, I come from a family from four\nchildren and I was the youngest. I had three older brothers. And they took us already to the\nGerman border. But in Holland was a Jewish Raad\u2019, a Jewish group of people. What they\nsay they help the Jews going to, Poland and Germany, but they went after it and they know\nthat they made a mistake and we were already one or two days.",
        "Q: Okay, fine. Can you just go back and explain why were you taken?",
        "A: Because that was a mistake. It was a mistake that they took us because, they didn't know that\nthe, the Wynberg, that boy, that he was it. They thought that we were it. It was a mistake.\nAnd it \u2014 because we had the same name. And so they sent us already \u2014 and always we had a\nlittle backpack staying by the door because everybody knows already that it would be\nperhaps something like that happened, that, that we would be called up, so we went to that \u2014\nEnschede was the city. We went to Enschede. It was on the German border. And when we\nwere there the Dutch Jewish organization, the Jewish Raad was there \u2014 I don't know how it 1s\nin English. They, they went working very effective and they got us back to my, to Zwolle,\nwhere I lived. And I remember when we came back.",
        "Q: And how did they get you back?",
        "A: I don't know, exactly. They talked with the Germans and they told them that they have the\nwrong people and that we were the wrong people and that they have to have this other boy\nwhat he went over to the Catholic religion and not we. We were Jews, and, and that's the\nreason, they got us back. They went after that they said they had the wrong people. But that\nwas just a postponing of a time. And so we went \u2014 I remember we came back and all the\n* Council (Dutch)\npeople were standing on the street and, and everybody was cheering that we came back and,\nand everybody came to our house and congratulated us. That's the reason it's so in my\nmemory, that thing, that way. But, it didn't help much.",
        "Q: What happened when you did go back?",
        "A: Nothing happened. We just\u2014",
        "Q: What was your life like?",
        "A: Our life was \u2014 we were not allowed to do anything, so it was very, very upsetting. It was\nvery strenuous and it was very nervous. And, and the men had to go already to, work camp\nbut I'm talking now where it's already the end of 1941, beginning 1942 or so. And, the men\nhad to go to work camp. And I remember my brother was \u2014 one of my brothers was hidden\nand he just got married not long before, and her father had to go a work camp. And they\nstarting already talking; they say, \"Oh, when somebody goes to a work camp, then my father\nwill be sent away. So you better come out of the hiding place.\" So my brother came out of\nthe hiding place and her father \u2014 they would have sent away anyway \u2014 my \u2014 you know, the\nrumors go around. You didn't know what was going on. And so my brother came out. And\nthe men went to working camps, but they were allowed to go weekends home; so nobody\nsaw something difficult in it, not so serious 1n it. They thought, \"Oh, they have to go there for\nhelping, doing things,\" and they came weekends home. So in between, also, there were\nthings going on in, in my home town. That a young group of men didn't have anything to do.\nThey're all \u2014 everybody what had a business was taken away already for the Germans and\nthey put Volk-, traitors what went with the Germans\u2014they put in these businesses. So the\nmen didn't have anything to do. And we were not allowed to go out of the house after five\no'clock at night; we have to stay in. So these men, eight young married men, came together\nand played card. And one of the traitors, a Dutch man, went to the German and say, \"You\nknow, that bunch of Jews sitting there and playing card.\" And they took these eight men and\nsent them to Poland. So that was going on a lot. It was a, a lot of Dutch, not-Jewish people,\nwhat were traitors; and you had to be very, very careful, to not to talk and not to, say\nanything. I tried to, to, to do something, what, what I told you I went to Apeldoorn and\nhelped\u2014and that's a little town not far from my hometown\u2014and helped an older family, an\nolder couple. But it was after a very short time also very dangerous. And there was not much\nwhat you could do. I remember one day I was walked in my street, and in the street where I\nwas, was a big house and there was a Catholic priest lived in there. And the Catholic priest\ncame to me and he say \u2014 he start talking to me, and he said, \"How do you think that you can\nsave your life?\" And I say, \"The only way that I, that the Jews can save their life, is when\nnot-Jewish people take us in.\" And, the same evening he came to me and he say, \"I have a\nhouse for you. I have a place for you where you can go. And be ready tomorrow morning at\nfive o'clock, six o'clock,\" I don't remember exactly what time, but very early in the morning,\n\"with your bicycle, and a little bit what you can take with you on the bicycle, and I will bring\nyou there.\" And that what I did. I remember I say goodbye to my mother and to my brothers,\nand I never saw them again. That was the last time, time that I ever saw my family. And, we\nwent to Utrecht, and I went to, a family \u2014 no, a woman, what she was a nurse. She came also\nfrom my hometown. I went to her house and, I stayed with her a few months.\nAnd that was very, a very nice place with this woman to live; what she was the whole day\ngone and I was the whole day alone. And, then she had another family what she want to take\nin, and I went to another family's house. A very large house with, a lot of room, and I was\nthere the maid. I had to clean the house, and I had to, was not allowed to talk to anybody. I\nwas not allowed to go open the door ever. I was not allowed to go out of the house; and there\nwas no food in the house and it was very hard already, food in Holland. Holland \u2014 they\nsuffered tremendous in the war. They didn't have, much to eat and they had, didn't have\nmuch, it was very difficult; and these people, they really didn't have anything in the house. I\nremember they cooked the bones ten times to make soup and they had the cat's plate already\nwith it. It was very awful fam-\u2014 it was a very awful time for me to be there alone. And, I, I\ndidn't I didn't get much to eat there. I remember I stole sometimes an apple, or I put in a\nsandwich under my pillow that at night when I came to my bed that I had something to eat\u2014\nbecause there was, really nothing to eat there. These people \u2014 when I was there a few\nmonths, they had another Jewish family and they took in; an professor it was there\u2014I met his\nwife, and they came upstairs and they want to use me also as a maid. I didn't let 1t. They had,\nthey wanted I cleaned the oven and things like that, and I didn't do that. Because I was so\nvery lonely and so unhappy, one day they told me that not far from them is another Jewish\nfamily hidden; and, I want to go and visit them. And I was very happy that I could talk with\nsomebody. So after three months being alone 1n, in that, locked up in that house and not\nreally having to talk with anybody. And they were very Christian. They really tried me to get\nover to their religion too, but, you know, it was very \u2014 it was not very pleasant time. I went,\nto this family, and the moment that I came into this family's house, the police came. And, I\nwas very sure that I was safe because I had a passport and it was \u2014 every Jew in Holland had\nto have a passport with a \u201cJ\u201d on it, and the underground took my \u201cJ\u201d out of the passport.\nWell, I didn't know that you hold it to the light that you can see the J, so I came there and I \u2014\nand when the police came. There were also police what were with the German. Dutch police\nthat went over to NSB\u2019, as they called them; and when police came I say I'm a nurse and\nhave come to help these people. And so they took my passport and hold it to the light and\nthey saw the \u201cJ\u201d and that was it. So there wasn't \u2014 there was a family hidden there, a lawyer.\nAnd what I didn't know, the people where I was hidden were traitors. That what I heard\nwhen I came back. Twenty-eight Jews are caught after that I, after that I was the first one\nwhat was hidden there; and nothing happened to the people what lived in the house. Always\nwhen the German found Jews in an house, they took the whole family \u2014 most of the time the\nwhole family, but sometimes just the men. And there never was happen something to these\npeople, but I didn't know. I heard it all after the war. These men went to jail, but because I\ndidn't know, after the war I, I testified for that they saved \u2014 that what I know.\n> National Socialistische Beweging (Dutch); National Socialist Movement.\nLater on I heard what was happened to them. So anyway, the police tried to get to know\nfrom me where I was hidden, but I didn't want to tell because I thought I know there was\nanother Jewish family there, and they have a chance then to, to get away. And so I didn't tell\nthem; and the people where I was caught told them. So in the evening I had to go back to the\nplace where I was hidden and they went to my room. I was in the attic. I had a room in the\nattic. And they opened the bed and they found that sandwich what I told you what I put\nsometimes under my pillow what I was very hungry. And they say, \"See! Look what the\nJews did! You know \u2014 see, you give them to eat and still she steals from you!\" I remember\nthat very \u2014 there's not many things that I remember, but that I remember. So anyway I don't\nremember what I took with me or how, but I remember I had to go back to the police station\nin Utrecht. I was a week 1n the police station in Utrecht. I could have got away from there. I\nhad a brother what was married and he was hidden in Utrecht, and I visit him and I didn't get\nalong with my sister-in-law. I still \u2014 she's still alive. I don't get along with her. Anyway, the,\nthe kids were very small; and it was very dirty and it was very poor. And I thought, \"When I\nhave to go to my brother....\" I, I just didn't want to. So the, the police asked me in Utrecht \u2014\nthey know that I could get away, so there was an underground already what I didn't know.\nThat was already 1942, October 1942. I didn't know that there was the underground already\nin Holland, very strong. And, when I and \u2014 I say \u201cno.\u201d I did \u2014 my mother didn't give me any\nmoney. I didn't have any money; and I thought when you have no money, where do I go?\nYou know, you have to go somewhere. So I didn't, go away, and, that \u2014 I remember that,\nmany times they tried to get me out, so in 19\u2014 then I went, from there I went to Amsterdam.\nIn Amsterdam I was, in jail. I was three months 1n jail in Amsterdam.",
        "Q: Okay. How did you get to Amsterdam?",
        "A: I don't remember.",
        "Q: And\u2014",
        "A: I don't remember. I was together in Utrecht in jail with this family. I don't remember much\nabout it. I remember they had a police, they always \u2014 I was young \u2014 I was nineteen, in\nbetween \u2014 young, good looking at that time, and the head of the police tried to get me also\u2014\nsomething that he wants to take me to his house and \u2014 I don't know, there was something not\nso good. So, I don't remember how we came to Amsterdam. I think by truck, or with a bus; I\nhave no idea, I don't remember that at all. I came \u2014 I remember we came to Amsterdam in \u2014\nwas in jail. I was three months in jail. I remember my family I had in Amsterdam knew\nabout it, and they sent me some \u2014 sometimes things to jail, but, I do \u2014 I was in a cell with,\nseven \u2014 several \u2014 eight, nine women. We didn't get much to eat, every \u2014 everybody \u2014 we\nwere with a professor's wife, and a doctor's wife, and a girl from, beautician, and somebody\nelse from the street; and I, I, you know, it is really very worldly. It was the first time that in\nmy life I met really people what told me things about the world, when I was brought up in a\nvery small town, a very \u2014 confined to a smaller group, area. Anyway, we were three months\n\u2014 I remember once I was laughing. There was \u2014 the girl, the woman what opened, what gives\nus our food, was, was a very mean German woman. And I started once laughing, and she\nsay, \"Do you have a brother that work in so and so hotel?\" And my brother was in a hotel\nschool, and he had to work in a hotel; and she was their maid. So she remembers my brother.\nAnd after that we got better food and we could share that together with the girls in the room.\nI remember also \u2014 I smoked 1n that time \u2014 and I had cigarette and I had no matches. I\nremember I was sitting hours hold my cigarette on the lamp perhaps it started making fire.\nBut it didn't work. So I give the cigarettes on this, on this woman, what was, she was very\nhappy with.\nThere was also one woman what I remember was very beautiful and had very blond long\nhair. And she came from \u2014 her fath\u2014 her husband had an, factory from hats; and she\nsmuggled out all these little papers and she put it in somewhere and she got it out and she got\nmoney in and she was really a, a very rich woman. I remember I came in, and we went after\nthere to another concentration camp; and she was already together with the head of the\nconcentration camp. So I was three months in that ca\u2014 in, in the jail in Amsterdam.",
        "Q: Were they all Jews?",
        "A: Yeah, they were all Jews. They were all Jews. I was over Christmas there till beginning of\nJanuary; I think the first or the second of January. And it, it was a very difficult time. We\nwent also out. They took us out every day and we had to walk around, so like you see in\nmovies, we had to walk around, and \u2014 but they didn't, didn't hit us. They didn't do any,\npunishments to us; but we didn't get much to eat. And it was \u2014 you didn't know what was\nhappen, what would happen to you. After three months we had to go out, and I remember we\nwent to an office and we were standing there with a whole bunch of Jewish girls. Girls from\nmy age, seven, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, nineteen years old. I was already along between\ntwenty years old then. Getting a little bit older. So, we were standing there. I remember one\ngirl was singing, that song, a German song, that \u2014 what will happen to us. I\u2014 we met there\nalso one of the girls what was a survivor, Ursula, Ursula Stern \u2014 Ula Stern \u2014 and we, we\nsomehow stick together. Mimie Katz was one of the girls' name, and we somehow stick\ntogether from that point on. We went together to another concentration camp in Holland,\nOught. That was the \u2014 just the opening from the concentration camp when we came there. It\nwas 1943 and we were one of the first people what came there, because we didn't have any\nblankets and it was in January. We didn't have any blanket. They didn't have much food\nthere, and, there were only wo\u2014 women were separate from the men. The men was 1n the\nother camp, a other part; and we were in one part. The men had it very difficult. They right\naway shaved the hair from the men, that they didn't get to eat. They had to work very heavy\nlabor, and they got punished very badly. Because when I went later to Westerbork I went\ntogether with these men and I met them. We \u2014 I was very lucky, again. there was a man what\nrecognized me, what he came to our hotel, and he said, \"Do you like to have a good job?\"\nAnd I said, \"Yes.\" I \u2014 he said, \"Would you like to be the head of the laundry?\" I said, \"Yes.\"\nI didn't know anything about laundry, but I thought everything is better then; perhaps it looks\ngood. So I worked in the laun\u2014 laundry, and I \u2014 to assort clothes, and they were sent out. And\nmost of the time the half didn't come back, so it was not so good. It was \u2014 everybody was\nvery unhappy. We, we \u2014 the, the \u2014 what I told you the girls what we met in jail, somehow we\nstick a little bit together. I don't know why, but, we know \u2014 when we went to Westerbork,\nwe, we also came together in the, in the same co-\u2014 sitting together in the train. Yeah.",
        "Q: Can you tell me a little bit more about the, concentration camp before you \u2014 ?",
        "A: No. What I don't remember much. It was three months long. I know we didn't get much to\neat, and I had to work there assorting clothes. And I, I remember the bathrooms were\ntogether and they were very \u2014 a lot of older people and, and, I don't even remember if there\nwere showers. I don't remember. I know we didn't get much \u2014 there was no salt, and we had\nto eat the food without salt; and I couldn't eat it. That's what I remember. I really don't\nremember much about that camp. I remember only that the men had it very difficult. But\nsomehow I, I don't remember much. I may \u2014 that's \u2014 I don't \u2014 it was a very short time. I\nremember more that week what I was in, in Westerbork \u2014 where we went to with the train to\nWesterbork, and I was sitting together with one of the young men from my home town. And\nhe was always very good looking, and I remember he was mar-\u2014 he was 1n love with a\nmarried a woman, and he \u2014 they were sitting together and he looked awful. I mean he \u2014 you\ncould see he didn't get to eat and he \u2014 he looked horrible. And, and, and with his wife, with\nhis, girlfriend, what was his \u2014 and we went together to Westerbork. And when I came to\nWesterbork I remember that, we \u2014 they, they tried to get me out of the barrack where I was\nin, because \u2014 they couldn't get me out, because I was, hidden. And, and they couldn't get me\nout because of that, so my fa\u2014 I had \u2014 there came a brother from my mother. Was there for a\nlong time, with five little children; and she was already a long time \u2014 they were already a\nlong time in Westerbork. Westerbork was not a concentration camp. Westerbork was a\ncamp, but it \u2014 what you could stay in Westerbork. It was safe. That was a camp where only\npeople went through. A lot of people stayed there, and stayed there for a long time; and was\nvery good eating and it was entertaining, and it was like a little village. And when you could\nstay in Westerbork, you were safe for your life; but when I, I couldn't stay there because I\nwas hidden, and I was punished because of that \u2014 because \u2014 I had no chance to stay.",
        "Q: What do you mean by you were hidden?",
        "A: I was hidden in, in Holland; and so I\u2014 when you, you had no chance. I was hidden in\nHolland by these not- Jewish people. And I \u2014 what's the word for it? I forget it \u2014 I write it\nalways down, this word, and I forget always that word. When I speak to people I write the\nword down, but I forgot. I had no chance to come out of there, because I was punished\nbecause I was hidden in Holland. When you \u2014 when, when I wouldn't have been hidden; they\nwould have taken you out of your house, you, you could have perhaps stayed there longer.\nSo this uncle tried to get me out of the barracks, but we couldn't \u2014 they couldn't me out, this\nuncle. we stayed there a week, and somehow like Ula, Ursula Stern, and Mimie Katz and\nother \u2014 the other five girls, seven girls where we\u2014I forgot the names from the other ones,\nbecause they went right away later to the gas chamber. So we, just a few girls what I stayed\nin Sobibor with, I remember vividly. So we, we were in Westerbork and we were not\nallowed to go out of this barrack and, that was in \u2014 that was in already April. I was three\nmonths in Vught. And in April, beginning of April I think \u2014 I don't remember the date\nexactly; but it is \u2014 statistically, you can find it out. We, one morning they give us some food\nand we had to go a freight car; and we had to go in this freight car. I remember also not so\nmuch about Westerbork either. I don't know, you know, forty years long we never talked\nabout anything. And when I \u2014 when we talk to people I tell them more about \u2014 not about this\n\u2014I tell more about.... So I don't remember much about that, the little episodes. I remember\nthey didn't do us any harm, and there were no German. Only there was all Jew what we saw,\nwhat worked with us in Westerbork. And you didn't see \u2014 I didn't see any German. There\nwere Germans more outside and, you know, in different places. But in the camp were only\nJews \u2014 in so, in Westerbork. I, I remember now that we had to go into the train. This uncle\nwhat was in Westerbork went with the same transport to Sobibor as I went.\nWe went in the first \u2014 that was the first transport what went to Sobibor in freight wagons. till\nnow they all went in pass \u2014 in regular trains, passagiertrein\u2019, and I was the first one that\nwent. We went the first one that went in freight trains. The freight trains, they put some straw\non the ground and there was a barrel for the toilet in the corner; and I don't remember \u2014 I\nthink it was open but I don't remember exactly, what we had to go to the bathroom. So \u2014 and\nnow we were so, about 60 people they put in the train. And it was very, scary feeling. I\nremember we were all very nervous. We did \u2014 these young girls; we stick together also like\nwe stick together in Westerbork, we stick together and we sat together in that train, in the\ntrain. I think we got some food, because I don't remember they were hungry. But, the \u2014 there\nwere \u2014 in that time we say all Germans were standing outside in Westerbork; and when the\ntrain got closed with the door, and the lock on it, and there was just a little window on top,\nwe were very afraid and we were very scared. There were a lot of older people in the train,\nand, and everybody wants to look through this window; but we were afraid because the\nGermans were shooting later on. When we went away, we stopped many times. The train\nstopped many times. And many times was always shooting on the outside and they were\nwith dogs on the outside, and we could see through this little windows and we could see that\npeople did like that to us. And we didn't know what it was, what 1t means. We thought just\nantisemites. You know, they want to have us dead. We went farther and farther. And the\nfarther we went \u2014 see, we come from Holland and Holland is a little like America; it's small,\nvery sophisticated, little town and you still see more poor, poor people.\n\u2018 Passenger-train (Dutch)\nAnd the farther we came, the poorer the poor people looked, and, and after three days they \u2014\nwe thought we were in Russia. We had no idea. Also, we didn't have \u2014 and I thought I go to\nmy mother. The only thing also in Utrecht, already I thought, \u201cI want to go to my mother and\nmy brothers.\u201d But I forgot to tell you when I was hidden the, the woman \u2014 the man what\nbrought me to Utrecht was my English teacher; and his wife came to me when I was in \u2014\nhidden in, in Utrecht, and she's told me one day that my mother on the way out of the house\n\u2014 she was planning to go hide somewhere \u2014 somebody told the Germans that my mother\nwants to go and hide somewhere and they caught my mother. And they send my mother\nalready to Poland, and my brothers too. My two brothers, and one brother was just married\nalso. And so, so I, I wanted to go to my mother. That's the all what I thought about it; also\nwhen I was in Utrecht, I wanted to go to my mother. That's the only thing what I thought\nabout. And so I didn't want to go, really, hide somewhere because I didn't know there was\nthe underground already that you that you had a chance to save a\u2014 somewhere that\nsomebody would take you in. And, so when I went to, was in Westerbork I thought the only\nthing what I could, go to my mother; and that was that's that we all thought, the girls that\nwere together with me what had already the family were, were, away, thought also they go to\ntheir family. So we had no idea that Holland \u2014 in Holland was, was no antisemitism. We\ndidn't grow up with antisemitism. We didn't grow up to be afraid, that you say something\nand, and, and it would something happen to you. And so, we had no idea what would happen\nto us. So after three days and three nights, we, we came to Sobibor. What, what were \u2014 yeah?",
        "Q: I was just going to say \u2014 can you recall anything else about the train ride?",
        "A: I just can recall about the train ride that it was very scary. And how farther we went, how\nmore the people did like that when we were fighting always what who can look outside; so\nwhen we could look outside we were very happy. And, and then when we saw these people,\nwhat they did to us \u2014 we had no idea and that's also what I recall, that \u2014 I don't recall that we\nwere hungry. I remember we didn't have anything to drink. That I remember \u2014 we were very\nthirsty, what was already very hot \u2014 I think was very hot \u2014 I don't know \u2014 we were very\nthirsty. And we didn't have anything to drink and I think there had to be \u2014 and I remember\nthere was a barrel and I think it was hidden because I don't \u2014 we were \u2014 all the people and,\nand we couldn't \u2014 everybody was sitting on the ground. We had nowhere \u2014 nowhere else to\nsit and in, in the straw, but that's all that I remember, that 1t was very scary, that we know\nwhere we go. Well, we had no idea where we went. I remember that we came out at Sobibor.\nThey opened the, the doors; and then we heard screaming and with the whips throwing, and\nwe heard, \"Raus! Raus! Raus! \" That we had to go out of the train with whips and, and\nhitting us already, and, and everybody stumbled over each other. And I remember there was\na trolley. You know, was a trolley, little kipcar\u00ae that goes over. And we saw all the people\nwhat couldn't walk, throwing in them; and little children went in that trolley. And it was very\n> Get out! (German)\n\u00b0 Dump cart (Dutch)\nconfusing, you know, and we had to throw away our baggage, that little package what, what,\nbackpack what we had. We had to throw that tn, in, 1n a place. I remember vividly also that\none woman throwed away her package and her baby went, and, and, she said to German,\n\"Oh, my child! My child!\" And he had a whip and said he, and he hit this woman and saw\nblood from her face coming and said, \"We will take care of this baby. You go!\" So then we\nwent farther and we stick somehow together with these young girls. And we passed all these\nGermans. The \u2014 all, all the SS's were standing there on the side, and we passed all these\nGermans; and they say, \"You're out. You're out.\" And they pull us out, and we settled on the\nside. When I was in jail in Amsterdam, one of the girls\u2014one these women what I told you\nabout the blond hair\u2014say she wants to go always with a German to bed and she thought when\nshe get pregnant perhaps she can get out of Jail.\nSo I didn't know really what she means what she say. But I say to the girls \u2014 we didn't know\nwhat had happened to us \u2014 we stay on the side; and I say to the girls, \"What will happen to\nus?\" \"One shower,\" she always say, \"one bath, and it is all over.\" I remember I say to the\ngirls, \"One bath and it is all over.\" I didn't know even what she was talking about. So we\nstanding there together and we didn't know what's happened to us, if the Germans will use us\n\u2014 we had no idea. We were just standing there on the side. I think, I think we were ten or\ntwelve or twenty \u2014 I don't know exactly how many girls. That's the first transport that took\nyoung girls, Dutch, Dutch young girls out. We were the first Dutch people, and we were\nstanding on the side and when we saw the trans\u2014 we saw all the people passing by. We saw\nthe \u2014 I think the women went first, and then the men went at last. But I don't remember\nexactly. I remember \u2014 saw them walking already that side to the to the gas chamber, that they\nhad to take their clothes off. And I remember that also that I, we heard them speaking to the\ngroup of us standing there, and say, \"You came to Sobibor, and everything will be okay,\u201d\nand we- \u201cHere is a little card. You can write home that you are here in Sobibor and that you\nare \u2014 you go to a work camp.\u201d And we have to take a shower because the \u2014 it it's better for\nyou that you take a shower; so we can, we will give you other clothes.\" That I remember \u2014\nthat they were talking to them. What, what they say exactly, I perhaps remember what I read\nlater about it. But I remember that they talking to them, that they say, \"Here is a card. You\ncan write to Holland.\" For us, we were standing on the side and they brought us to Camp\nOne. Sobibor was divided in\u2014",
        "Q: How long did you stand on the side like that?",
        "A: So long that the people came and they were gone. So the men was on the right side \u2014 of the\nmen went first, and then that was nobody there. Was nobody there anymore.",
        "Q: Where did they all go? All the\u2014?",
        "A: We couldn't see it. We were standing on a spot that I\u2014 they were already going to the gas\nchamber, because Sobibor was a death camp. They \u2014 everybody went straight to the gas\nchamber. There was just a very small camp. When we came, there was a very small group of\npeople just what was living and, and working in Sobibor. So all the \u2014 I don't remember \u2014 all\nthe two thousand people that we came with went straight to the gas chamber. So the one\ngroup went already to the gas chamber. We went then to where we slept. The camp was\ndivided in three parts. One camp part we slept, and one camp part we worked and one part\nwas Lager Drei\u2019. One \u2014 Camp One, Camp Two, Camp Three. We called \"Lagers.\" Lager\nDrei was the death camp. When you were once there, or even looked at there, you never\ncame back. So we \u2014 they brought us to Camp One. When we came on in Camp One, I saw\npeople from my home town. I saw boys what I grew up with, as far back as their father and\nmother were my best \u2014 my parent's best friends. And I remember I saw one boy what, what,\nwhat, stayed with us in the hotel\u2014in the wartime, in 1941\u2014because he had to go out of his\nhouse. The German took his house, and he stayed with us. And I was so happy to see them. I\nsaid, \"Hi, how are you?\" And I waved to them. He was just standing there and he didn't say\nanything. And they were very scary and they didn't answer us. So they went to work first,\nand, then we went to work.\nAnd we came to a barrack, and we had to assort clothes. We had to assort clothes. We had to\ndo, first quality, and second quality; and we had to look after what was in the pockets we had\nto take out. And we had to empty, the knapsacks we had to empty. You know, I didn't know\nwhat I was doing. I had no \u2014 that I remember vividly \u2014 I had no idea that thinking that it was\nfrom people that that what came on. It was very stupid, but I didn't \u2014 I had no \u2014 I remember\nthat we all assorted the clothes. And then after, four or five o'clock, I had to assort even the\nclothes. I remember that there was also the clothes from this uncle, from the man with the\nfive children, was also in this transport. I \u2014 at five o'clock we had to go on a roll call, go out\non a roll call, and we were brought to Lager One where we slept. And we came to Lager\nOne, we had to dance for the Germans. There were some Jews what, what had instruments,\nwhat were already longer in camp and they had some instrument. In between the fire was\nburning and you could smell, you know, the \u2014 from bones and the hair \u2014 and the fire was\nburning and there was \u2014 that was like over, over the whole camp. Was very big, very big.\nAnd we had to dance. The Germans were standing there laughing and having fun and some \u2014\nI don't know exactly, but some of the Jews had an instrument. They were playing the music,\nlike a sub-distance from the Germans and it was an order that we had to dance. And Chaim,\nmy husband, asked me to dance; and that was the first time that I met Chaim. I remember he\nlooked terrible. He had no hair and had some hat on, and strange pants he wore. He wore\nalways two pants because, when they hit him then it didn't hurt so much. So he had another\npants on, and, and I \u2014 it was very strange. I, I, I don't remember much about that dancing\nreally, but I remember we had to dance. When I went away from that I met these Dutch boys\nwhat I remember from my home town. And they told me, \"Do you know what that fire\n\u201d camp three (German)\nmeans?\" And I say, \"No.\" And they, they were all married and all the wives went to the gas\nchamber. And they cried, and they told me. And it was very upsetting. I still, I still couldn't\ncomprehend it. I think 1t took me a long time to think about it; that with all these people I\ncame with, that they were dead and \u2014 you know? So, after that we talked together, we got\nvery close. They, they were very hungry. They, we didn't get anything to eat in, in the camp.\nThey didn't work with the barracks. They worked some place else. I was lucky that I start\nworking with assorting clothes; so I had a chance to steal food from the, from the backpacks\nwhat the Dutch people brought when there was transport. They didn't have a chance to, to get\nanything. So after a very short time, there was a German, German Jew, and he was a traitor.\nChaim, my husband, always say, \"He wants to be holier than the Pope,\" this guy. And he\ntold the Germans that the Dutch men- there were seventy-two Dutch men in camp-that they\nwant to run away. We never know if it was truth or if it was just a lie. We really never know,\nbut after a very short time that we were in camp \u2014 and I don't remember have long contact\nwith the Dutch, young men \u2014 I remember they had to go on, on roll call. They had to, Ap\u2014 on\nAppell\u00ae and they \u2014 I remember one of the boys \u2014 Zeehandelaar was the last name, Maurits\nZeehandelaar \u2014 he had a little piece of butter and he brought it to me; says he, \"When I come\nback, save it for me.\" So he give me the little piece of butter and he \u2014 they were shot.\nSeventy-two Dutch boys were shot, so they never came back. So I don't remember much\ntalking to them. So that was a very short time that we was \u2014 after I was in camp that they got\nshot. I, I remember we didn't get much to eat. In the morning we got some black water and\nbread. It was for the whole day. It was like clay. It was very sour and you couldn't eat it. I\ncouldn't eat it. And were \u2014 and I remember that from the beginning the Dutch people always\ntried to get that bread; and we, I gave it to them because, we could we could eat some, we\ncould steal and we had together with us some \u2014 we could make some food. So, they were\nvery hungry. Later on we get more Dutch people in camp. Later on there come more Dutch. I\n\u2014 somehow the Dutch were always, came to us and they wanted to have some food from the\nothers. We had a little group of people. Some \u2014 later on came also, a cousin of mine came to\ncamp, to Sobibor. And so I, we \u2014 and Mimie Katz was another Dutch girl what I was with in\ncamp, and Ula. We had \u2014 we shared our food in the evening when we came together and we\nhelped each other when we got sick and things like that.\nWe \u2014 most of the time we worked assorting clothes. When there came no transport, we had\nto work in the woods and clean the woods. Just there was no work there in that camp. Or we\nhad to clean the railway, rail, railroad. Or we had to throw out the ashes from the \u2014 what we\ngot. We didn't get it. They brought it. In the fields, and we had to assort \u2014 throw it in the\nfields for, fertilizing, the ashes. So I got typhus. I got sick on typhus. So there's a big part in\nSobibor what I don't remember, because I got typhus. And you was not allowed to be sick in\nSobibor. Everybody what was sick went straight to the gas chamber. I remember what I was\nsick and one day I stayed in, in the barrack. The barrack had no toilet. We were not \u2014 we had\n\u2014 there was a pail and that was our bathroom; and we slept in two rows, three rows, three.\n* roll call (German).\nThe floor and three rows, and we all with the lice a very short time, and there was \u2014once\nthere was another animal but also red and that was full and that little bit food what was\nsometimes had to put under the pillow and, and were the mice. I remember one day I put a\npillow up and it was all mice with little babies under my pillow with that what \u2014 and we were\nalready \u2014 I remember I was so upset from the first lice what I had that Chaim \u2014 I was on\nalready \u2014 Chaim fell right away in love with me, so that was a big help for me too; you\nknow, that, that the time in Sobibor was not so difficult 1f I would have been alone. But\nChaim was already six months longer in camp. Now Chaim was really a girlfriend with\nsomebody else, with Esther Raab \u2014 what was interviewed here \u2014 and I think she was jealous.\nChaim right away fell in love with me, so he was a big help for me and all the time in the\ncamp, because I don't think when I wouldn't have Chaim, I wouldn't have made it.\nUltimately, definitely not out of camp. But when I was sick Chaim took me to the bathroom\nand made me walk and, he brought me, I think, food. I don't remember much from the time\nwhen that I had typhus because I was very sick and you had to go to work. And because of\nChaim, and also because of the girlfriends what I had \u2014 I say they helped me through this\ntime because that I remember. Later on they told that I fell sometimes asleep and they hide\nme when we had to clean the woods, so they hide me some where that I was sleeping. And\nalso one day, Frenzel\u2019 came out. Frenzel was one of the worst SS's in camp; and he came to\nthe camp, Camp One, and he went, with the whip he went in the barrack in and everybody\nwas sick, had to go out and had to stay on the middle and I remember so vividly, was also a\nboy that I know from Assen, from another town, from the Zionist organization, and he was\nstanding there and, and they all was standing on a long time in the middle on the camp and\nthey all got shot, right away.\nWhen I \u2014 then he screamed and, and I came out and he recognized me; and I don't remember\nif it was Wagner\u2019\u201d or Frenzel \u2014 now one of the two \u2014 I mixed it up \u2014 he say to me, \"Go back\nto work!\" So I could go back to work. Just luck. Frenzel picked me out, too; and Frenzel\nsomehow always picked me out. When I had a very heavy work \u2014 I don't know why -\u2014 just\nluck. He picked me out and give me easier work. We had sometimes to go in the woods and\npicking mushrooms for the Germans, some of the girls. I remember I put everything, the\nmushrooms, I put them in my bra and in my underpants, and when we came home we\ncooked them in a little something what, what the Polish girls had; and then we had to go out\nand picking blueberries sometimes, but we were not allowed to eat them. So when we came\nback then we had to show our tongue if we had one. And we were very hungry in that time.\nWhen there came no transports, we were very hungry, because you couldn't save the food\nbecause the mice and the and the rats, they, they took away under your pillow. So we were\nvery hungry. Somehow Frenzel, when I had very heavy work \u2014 we has also to go in the\nwoods and cutting trees and bringing from one place to the other, or filling up these trolleys,\nwhat the people came in, with sand. And that we had to do on the \u2014 they were the Germans,\n\u201d Oberscharfiihrer Karl Frenzel\n'\u00b0 Oberscharfiihrer Gustav Wagner\nalso the, the Kapos' with the whip in back of us, and they \u2014 we had to put it somewhere.\nYou know, when there didn't came transport. So we were terrible. We are like animals\nalready, because we were happy when there came a transport; because we know when it\ncomes in a long time no transport, we go to the gas chamber. And when there come already\ntransport, when they coming, then we were happy that they came. When there came\ntransport from Holland, everything went very smoothly. And there came also transports from\nPoland, and when there came transports from Poland, was \u2014 we were locked up in our area\nand there was always shooting. There came also a transport from Belzec \u2014 my husband will\ntell that story from Belzec, that transport. I remember that we got locked up in our things and\nwe thought, \u201cthat's the end of us.\u201d There was shooting and there was screaming and there\nwas \u2014 it, 1t was very scary; and that was from Belzec. They didn't want to go to the gas\nchamber, so they shot them on the spot. And many times when transports came from, from\nPoles \u2014 Polish Jews, they didn't want to go to the gas chamber because they know they went\nthrough the gas \u2014 that they went. So they just shot them on the spot. So, it was also many\ntimes we had to stay on roll call the whole night because an animal walked on one of the\nmines; because Sobibor was with, mines three times or two times and sometimes an animal\nwalked on there \u2014 I don't know what kind of an animal \u2014 and then we had to stay the whole\nnight on roll call. And we always made so out that, Chaim and I, that we stayed together.\nYou know, he always made sure that we always \u2014 when also once what 1s that there was,\nsome Jews ran away. Two Jews ran away. They made it, too. And we had to go back and we\nstayed on roll call. And Chaim, Chaim had \u2014 the men had to stay separate and the women\nhad to stay separate. And we stayed in Lager One on roll call, and they cut, they picked out\nevery tenth person. So okay, imagine how what a nervous wreck I was \u2014 they picked out\nevery tenth person, so it could have been Chaim. Chaim was number nine.",
        "Q: They're going to change the tape.",
        "A: What?",
        "Q: They're going to change the tape.",
        "A: Okay.\nTECHNICAL CONVERSATION\n'' Forman (colloquial German); term used for inmates appointed by the SS to head a labor\nKommando of prisoners.\nTAPE #2\n[Technical conversation |",
        "A: Where did we stop?",
        "Q: You were talking about standing in line and how they selected every ten people, and your\nhusband\u2014",
        "A: Oh. Yeah. And he was number one \u2014 nine. He was number nine, and, and they were all shot.\nI remember so vividly, there was one woman, and one man was number ten and his\ngirlfriend or his wife was there. And she say, \"When he goes, I go with him.\" So she went\nalso with him and they got shot. You hear, you hear the shooting. Shooting was \u2014 killing was\nnothing. You know, you live with the minute. You live with the second. I mean somebody\ndied or somebody could \u2014 I mean you lived in such a fear, every minute of the day, that you\ndon't know one day of the other, you know. And, and every time when I saw Chaim or if he\nsaw me, we were happy that we were still alive. We were always together. They called us\nbride and \"bruidegom '\u201d,\" because we were always together. We tried always be together. So\n\u2014and you know, I, I was like a tomboy. I was always the only girl from four, from four\nchildren; and I grew up and I was the youngest so I grew up with my four brothers. So I\nremember that Chaim always calmed me down. And he was always sure that, that nobody\nreally knows us, that we went and so, you know; he calmed me down. I stole a lot of food\nalways from the packages.\nAnd what was very, very dangerous. When they would caught us, they shoot me right away,\nstraight. And, and I remember, once the they, they killed some people in the woods. There\nwere \u2014 a group of men had to work in the woods and cutting trees; and they had a plan to run\naway. And when they were in the woods they, they killed some from the Ukrainians, what\nwere also what take care of them. And they, they were Polish Jews, not Dutch Jews. Dutch\nJews, they didn't think about running away. Because we know we didn't \u2014 where could we\nrun? We don't know Polish, and where could we run? So they didn't \u2014 but they were the\nPolish Jews, and they killed and they ran away. And some got alive out. But most of the\nDutch Jews, they shot a bunch and they caught them and they put them, they brought them\nback. And we had to stay on roll call, and we \u2014 I had a lot of food in my coat. I remember I\nput it in a coat. I don't how, how come that I had a coat \u2014 something over my arm. I\nremember. And one woman was crying when her husband \u2014 it was a Dutch woman \u2014 who\ngot killed and I know they wouldn't do anything to her. So I say, \"Will you take my coat?\"\nAnd she took my coat; because I know for sure they wouldn't do, they wouldn't look over her\n' bridegroom (Dutch)\nif she would have some food when she was crying. And they had sometimes, you know,\nsome feeling for the Dutch people. And they too \u2014 didn't take me to look over my clothes,\nbut they took some of the other people look if they had food with them. After that we had to\ngo on roll call on a big place, and we were standing. And again Chaim and I were standing\nnext to each other; and they took a bunch of people and we had to stand 10 or 20 people\u2014I\ndon't remember the amount\u2014and they had to stand farther up, and they will shoot them. They\nwere planned to shoot them. My system was always\u2014 and was perhaps because I do a lot\nnow when we see a movie where we don't want to see, we take it away right away \u2014 I never\nlooked, so they shoot these 10 people. We had to stay all on roll call together, the whole\ncamp; and we had to look what will happen to you when you do things like and they all\nshoot them. I didn't look. I saw them later that the Germans went again and shoot them\nagain, that I that I remember, but I didn't see them falling. I remember one person seeing\nfalling of that, that what I think I saw; but I remember that they went back and they all shot\nthem again. And there were all because they want to show us what will happen to us if we\nwill do a thing like that. Also I remember vividly that one boy opened a can of sardines, and\nthey, they almost killed him. His, his arm was almost \u2014 he was almost dead. They put him on\na piece of wood, and we had to also trade \u2014 and the whole\u2014 everybody what worked in the\nbarracks had to go on a roll call and we had to watch this boy, and that was Wagner said,\n\"That will happen to you. When you open a can of sardines, or you eat anything from the\nthings what coming on. That will happen to you!\" So, I remember this boy laying there and\nwe know this boy. You know, some of the things stays in your mind what, what happened to\npeople. I remember also once a man was standing and he did something wrong, and Wagner\ntook a shovel and cut his head in two pieces. You know, and I see him also standing there,\nthis man, and then he dropped dead. Once was a Kappa. He was laying in bed\u2014 a young boy\nfrom 15, 16 years old, and he was a very nice kid and\u2014 Pim was his name, I think, Pim, and\nFrenzel \u2014 Wagner came in and say, \"Out! Up! Up! You have to go up! You have to go on\u2014\nthere comes a transport. You have to go out and work!\" And he put with his whip, like that\u2014\nout, as a joke. He, he was asleep, and Wagner took him out and shot him. You know, your\nlife was, was nothing. You know, that I think what I remember, I remember that when we go\nfrom work and we had to go home, we had to sing, and we had to go down and up. There\nwas a punishment.\nYou had lay down, \"hinlegen und aufstehen'*\" it was in German. You had to lay down and\nyou had to go up, and you had to lay down on the order from the Germans. All punishment.\nWe had to sing very nice. Many times we had to sing on the inside of the hall where were\nslept. We had to walk around, in \u2014 10 people together\u2014 like in the Sing Sing when they \u2014 and\nit was \u2014 I think I saw movies from the Sing Sing, as a child, and I remember always like a\nSing Sing. And it was beautiful singing. When there were already Russian Jews came, the\nRussian transport came already and also the Polish Jews; and we had to walk around and\nsing, Russian and Polish songs, and German songs. I was six months in, in camp. When I\n8 Lay down and get up! (German)\nlook back, it I can't remember that it was six months; because I was a long time sick so there\nwas a big part what I don't remember.",
        "Q: How long were you sick?",
        "A: I don't remember. I really don't remember. But I was sick. a week, six weeks. Chaim always\ncovered up for me, a lot of times. And also my girls, the girls \u2014 the\u2014Ula, Ursula Stern\u2014what I\ndid from the beginning for them when they was sick, or we could help each other. You have\nto have somebody what covers up for you in a camp, if not you couldn't live. You lived \u2014 I\nslept together with Mimie Katz \u2014 she came from Holland, Haarlem \u2014 and Ula, where I slept\nin the middle. So when something, we, we could help each other, that's what we did, so, after\nthe \u2014 I don't \u2014 I, I remember that the camp got bigger and bigger. More people from, Minsk,\nfrom the Minsk \u2014 was a ghetto in Minsk. And people from Minsk came over, and we made\nbig barracks, the building \u2014 big barracks in Sobibor and we all were very scared because\nthere came no transports. They didn't come transports, and so we didn't know what was\ngoing on. And then, when the Minsk transport came these guy from Ger\u2014 from Russia, Sash,\nSasha, Sash \u2014 he just died not long ago. he came with a group of Russian Jews. And I didn't\ntalk with these, all these people, because, we Dutch people were, were like \u2014 they think did\nthe Dutch \u2014 the Polish Jews hold together tremendous, and some of the young girls, had\nfriends with the, with the Polish Jews. So, Katty Gokkes, she was also a Dutch girl, and she\nhad \u2014 with one of the Kapos she was friendly. She was very beautiful. The German, the\nPolish Jews thought she was very beautiful. And she had friendship with one of the Polish\nJews and so that's the reason, she knows everything; and she could tell Ula. But so, when\nyou didn't have a Polish friend \u2014 the, the Polish stick tremendous together. They spoke\nYiddish. We didn't speak Yiddish. In Holland, they didn't spoke Yiddish; so we spoke\nGerman but not Yiddish, so, we were goyim, we were not Jews. In the eyes from, from the,\nfrom the Polish Jews, we were not Jews. We were Jews, of course. We were at Sobibor. But\nwe were not, we were \u2014 they they didn't understand that we didn't speak Yiddish, and they\nstick tremendous together, so when the whole thing from the uprising, we didn't know\nanything about it. The Dutch Jews didn't know anything about it. Ula was lucky that she\nknows this other girl that was also a survivor. It was lucky because of Katty Gokkes that she\nknows. Katty knows about that, she had a relationship with one of the Kapos. I don't\nremember his name. So, when there was already something going on and then they built very\nbig barracks; so we went also, came in the big barracks. And I remember \u2014 I don't remember\nmuch about it. I don't remember much about it that I came to the big barrack; but I remember\nwhat it was a little bit better, what it was in that big barrack. There was a very big and much\nnicer, and I remember there was another girl \u2014 Viool was her name-that she came to Sobibor\nwith her father and two sisters and they could sing very beautiful, and they were and they\nwere always singing. And so she got also typhus and she was very sick and she had also a, a\nboyfriend and he left her there. He didn't take her \u2014 he ran away by himself. And there was\nanother Dutch man \u2014 not a \u2014 from Czechoslovakia, he's alive \u2014 Kurt Thomas, and he was\nfriendly with Katty Gokkes. That was his girlfriend; and when they run away and they were\nin the woods, he say, \"Where's Katty?,\" he says. \"I have no idea where Katie is. You should\nknow. You should have taken her with you like Chaim did.\" So Katty Gokkes also died. I, I,\nI'm \u2014 almost everybody died. But anyway, I didn't know anything what was going on from\nthe uprising. So one day \u2014 it was, it was very dangerous also. It was like a war. Like 1n, in\nlike there is a war, just a few people know about it; so nobody \u2014 there was just a very small\ngroup know about the uprising in Sobibor.\nAnd one day Chaim tells me, \"Try to get some clothes. I tried to get some boots; and dress\nyourself up.\" I was already a little bit better. It was \u2014 I, I was already much better, and so I \u2014\nthere is a barrack \u2014 all the boots, all the clothes went to different barracks, different tents, big\ntents. The boots were together. The clothes were together. Oh, yeah \u2014 one thi\u2014 one day \u2014\nalso, my mother knitted a lot and all my clothes was always knitted. Especially when I go to\nPoland, my mother put sure that in the backpack was all warm clothes. And Ula, Ula Stern,\nwas a big person and I was a big person. One day she couldn't find any clothes, so she went\nto the barrack and she \u2014 coincident, she took one of the dresses what my mother knitted. And\nshe came to, came to the barrack; and I remember that she had my dress on. I was very upset\nof course, it was my mother's dr\u2014 made that, so.... But, so 1t was all barracks that were over,\nthat were sent, that were sent to Poland; where they make bundles out of it. There were other\npeople again what worked there. Other people what worked and organized everything to\nseparate. And it went in the trains what went back; what when the Jews came, the trains went\nback with all clothes what went back to Germany. And that went also, before the people\nwent to the gas chamber, the men had to go and cut their hair; and that also went back to\nGermany. Everything, also the gold; and, we had to separate gold, and many times when we\nhad to assort the clothes we found diamonds and gold in it, and I remember once I found a\nwhole handful of diamonds and the German saw it and he took it. The Germans when they\nwent on vacation to Germany, they took the backpack full with ger\u2014 with gold and with\nsilver and with, with everything what, what they could grab; what was, what the Germans\nreally want for the army. You know? So, when you, when you found that you have to give it\nup. I had to assort the clothes. And I was not so clever, really, that I thought about that the\nGerman and they take the gold; but a lot of people took it and hide it. I, I always cut out all\nthe clothes what I had assorted. I, I cut it in pieces, when I saw that's the only sabotage what\nI can do. You know, to cut the clothes. And Chaim, and when I found something what\nnobody could see, I give it to Chaim. The fireman what had to burn all the pictures and all\nthe documents what were burned in Sobibor \u2014 Chaim, that was Chaim's best friend. Szmuel\nwas his name. And so Chaim many times put money under it, in the bottom and that went to\nhim and he hide that in the ground. That was hidden in the ground, so I when we run away,\nChaim makes sure that he got some of the money. So, so we, we\u2014 I didn't know anything,\nwhat was the uprising or anything what was, going\u2014 absolutely had no idea. So when Chaim\ntold me try to get some warm clothes; then he told me, 'Take some warm clothes,\" and he\ntold me that what the plan is to do. Then he told I was not allowed to tell it to anybody,\nabsolutely\u2014 and that's my always and guilt feeling. I had a cousin there, and I didn't tell her;\nand the same day she say, \"I will make some food,\" when she work in the where the laundry\nfor the Germans and she had a chance to cook something. And I didn't tell her, and she didn't\ncome out. And I always feel guilty that I didn't do it. So, I went to a barrack, and there was\none German that was sometimes good. He didn't get also not much punishment, and he give\nme a pair of boots. And I had a lot of clothes on, what was very dumb, because when the\nGerman would have seen me with so much clothes on, he would have asked, \"Why do you\nhave so much clothes on?\" So Chaim told me, \"On four o'clock be by a big place.\" That is\u2014\nand also the, the medicine, all the medicine the Dutch people brought a lot of medicine and\nthat went also in one big place where, where they put the, the medicine, so the medicine was\nin that big place. And there he say, \"Come there at four o'clock.\" So I make sure that I\nwalked there at four o'clock. Everybody was working. Everything \u2014 nobody knows anything.\nEverything \u2014 just a very small group of people what were involved in this in this uprising. So\neverything went through normal. I went walked \u2014 I don't know how, how I came to that, was\nallowed to walk there. Anyway, I walked there. I remember also in camp, once before the\nuprising, that I walked somewhere and I heard that the Germans spoke to the whole group of\ntransport people; and I saw the rabbi and the cantor from my home town, sitting there. And I,\nyou know, I just \u2014 I was planned just to run to them or \u2014 but I couldn't have done anything.\nAlso, many times I saw people from my home town walking. There was a little window, and\nI saw people from my home town passing this window; and I was afraid that they would see\nme, you know, I made almost sure. Whole families I saw walking to the gas chamber, many,\nmany times. And, and I couldn't say anything when even \u2014 was no way, nothing that I could\ndo. Nothing that I could do. So I walked to Chaim, and on four o'clock, and I come there. I\nremember I walked in there, and one of the Kapos \u2014 Wieszubski was his name, yeah. He\nkilled already a few Germans, and he was very nervous. And I say, \"Take a pill for it,\nsomething for your nerves to calm down;\" and he took it, and I remember and it was bitter\nand he spit it out. Says he, \"I don't need it.\" So I met Chaim on the end, and there came \u2014\nthere wasn't \u2014 Chaim was not involved in the uprising, but somehow he say to me, \u201ccome\nthere\u201d and from there we will always go somehow in the area for roll call. So he want to be\nsure that we are together when there is a roll call. And there was a boy standing there and he\nwas involved, he was in the uprising involved, and he had to kill one German. Together with\nthe Kapo, with Wieszubski, and he say \u2014 I was standing together with him and Chaim \u2014 he\nsay, \"I'm afraid to go.\" Said Chaim, \"You have to go.\" And said he, \"I'm afraid.\" Said Chaim\n\u2014 \u201cthere's no way back.\u201d What we know already there was one young boy what had a chance\nto go walk around in camp and he knows already there were ten dead. So there was \u2014 we\nknow already now, you know, there was \u2014 we know it is our death. When we, when we get\ncaught now, that's the end. So the, the electricity was already cut off and the telephone was\nalready cut off; so there was already, you know, was already not a connection anymore. So\nChaim had no choice. He run inside and took a knife, put it in his boots; and he walked to\nthis, office where Beckman\", was his name, was and in between the Kapo was already there.\nAnd he had no choice, Chaim. And he \u2014 I remember that he was gone. I was inside to take\n'* Scharfiihrer Kurt Beckman\nthe knife or something like that, and I didn't see him going away to the barrack; and I went\nlooking for him. I said, \"Where's Chaim? Where's Chaim?\" Oh, I got so panicky, when I\nknow already there was an uprising and there was something going on there, and I couldn't\nfind Chaim. And then one of the boys, he say that, \u201cI say Chaim is in that barrack.\u201d And I\nwent looking where Chaim was and I hear screaming, like somebody killed a pork. Was\nscreaming, this man \u2014 the SS man was screaming, of course; and they were killing him with\nknives. When it was \u2014 we couldn't, we couldn't use guns or anything because nobody was\nallowed to hear, hear that we were \u2014 that they were killing Germans because they were all\nover, the Ukraines were standing there and the, and the Poles were all around. So I went\nback to the spot; and I went, went there for the roll call because it was very dangerous. I\nknow when I was standing there when just one German would walk around and if an\nUkraine would see me there \u2014 I know that I went back to the, to that barrack and was the roll\ncall.\nI went in the roll call, and then we walked back to the \u2014 then there was the roll call, and it\nwas already a little bit unorganized. It was, that was already, you know, with the, the main \u2014\nyou could see already it was unorganized; and then we started walking. And finally Chaim\ncomes out, and he, he was bleeding. When he, when that knife slipped out of the head from\nthis German and he got a cut in his arm. And he was all over blood; and I remember I\nthought, \"God forbid we come somewhere and he sees this blood.\" And you know, I had no\nidea what will happen and what will happen now. I had no idea. We're running away or just\nwas very \u2014I, you know \u2014 so, I cleaned him up from this blood a little bit. So in the time that\nwe were walking, and I think I had a handkerchief and I put a handkerchief on his arm. And\nit was bleeding and, and we were walking to Camp One, that we go home. In, in between\nmore people came off, on all side people came; and, you see, I remember there were came a\nUkrainian on a bicycle and they just killed him like nothing. Somebody had taken an axe or\nsomething, a knife or a who knows, and everybody start coming there together, what I\nremember; and then everybody say, \"Hurrah!\" or something. And then we started running,\nand we were lucky we were running to the entrance where the Sobibor comes in. And I\nremember that then Frenzel starts shooting. I hear guns starting already; the, the Germans\nknows what was going on. Because in between that we started walking and I cleaned Chaim\nup, a truck came. And it was one of the Germans was on this truck; and the Kapo what\nChaim killed the back of it, he killed already a few other ones and he went on this truck. He\njumped on this truck and tried \u2014 and then I don't know what's happened, but he never came\nout so I think he got killed on this truck. That was an family \u2014 an older man. He had three\nsons. He had three brothers and the father was there. I have to tell you later that I've met the\nfather in Israel. There was there three boys, all the three boys were Kapos, and nobody came\nout. Nobody came out of this, out of the camp. So when we start running, Frenzel was\nalready shooting and he had something tn front of him. I saw it. And every \u2014 it was a little\nhouse and everybody stopped for that little house. So Chaim took my hand and, and he say,\n\"Come,\" when it is no use that we stay there. And then everybody start running, and people\nstart \u2014 and then we walked to this door, to this gate and everybody was falling around next to\nus. Everybody \u2014 you hear mines going and people dropping dead, you know, on the mines,\nand you only you didn't see much. You just run. You just run. I remember I had a necklace\nfull with Jewish emblems; and, and I thought, \"Oh, when I come in a non-Jewish area I\nbetter take that off.\" So I \u2014 that was the first thing what I took off and throw away. And then\nI had to run and run and all the clothes slowly on. I took all the clothes off and I just had on\nwhat normally had on, because I couldn't run with all those clothes on. So I was running and\nrunning; and when I run I remember, when I'm very nervous, I get diarrhea and I had to stop\nall the time. And I was very nervous, of course, when you had to run; and then we heard\nshooting already in back of us, and we heard, screaming. And we're running and running and\nrunning till we came \u2014 and that was dark. Went to four o'clock, five o'clock, started be dark\nalready. We're running and we're running, we're running and there come away a whole\nbunch of Jews. We stayed there together. People from Sobibor. And I saw also Kurt Thomas,\nand he asked me, \"Where's Ula?\" No. Where is his girlfriend, Millie.\u2019\u201d And I told him, \"I\ndon't know. You have to take her.\" I say, \"Yeah, I had to run.\" So he \u2014 Chaim was the only\none what took his girlfriend, what took, took his Dutch girl. He was the only one from all the\nPolish Jews. See how lucky I was. And we run and there we come together with a bunch of\nthese Polish Jews. And Chaim say to them, \"Can we stay together?\" And one had a gun, a\nlarge gun; and he wants to shoot Chaim because he was afraid for me because I don't speak\nPolish. And, and right away they're, you know, they're afraid. So I jumped in front of Chaim,\nand he didn't shoot Chaim. And we went away, the two of us. We left all of them, and we\nwent away, the two of us. We had \u2014 Chaim had some money, some gold pieces and some\ndiamonds and we thought it was a lot of money. I have no idea how much it was. We both\ndon't remember. He had in \u2014 where you put the glasses in \u2014 a case, he had filled with\ndiamonds and gold and you know. And so we came; and he thought that and that was what\nwe thought we can save our lives with. Was his brains, not mine. I wouldn't even think about\nmoney. So we went to a farmer in a little village, and we asked if we can stay for the night.\nAnd he say, \"Yes.\" Chaim give him a gold piece, a gold dollar. I don't know how much it\nwas. And we stayed in the attic for the night.",
        "Q: How did you find this place?",
        "A: We just saw somebody with a light on, and we walked in. We had a lot, that was just luck.\nWe \u2014 just the lucky stuff. So I thought we didn't find them. It was just a little house and in\nthe same village, the same day, we stay at night. We hide at night. In the same day, the\nGermans came and they went a lot of houses and they killed all the Jews. All the Jews what,\nwhat they could find, they killed all over; and they skipped this house where we were in, I\nthink. But the same village that they went in houses in, so when it was started to be dark \u2014 I\nremember there was no bathroom, of course, and I had to go to the bathroom.\nWe were hidden down in the attic, and I'm still ashamed of what it was, it was terrible, 1t was\n'\u00b0 Also referred to as Mimie Katz.\nterrible. Anyway, I walked in water and my shoe got too small, my boots got too small, so I\ntook off my boots. I couldn't get 1t on anymore. So I had to walk all the two weeks on the\nside of my boots. Chaim had to cut it open with a knife, and I had to walk on the side of my\nboots; on one, on one boot when I couldn't get 1t on anymore. So we walked and we were\nwet and it was raining and we walked at night and I was very scared, and we walked through\nthe woods. And every tree I looked \u201cFrenzel.\u201d Frenzel wore always in, in cape, you know.\nAnd it, and sometimes the tree looks like that. I remember Chaim say once to me, \"Now you\nhave to stop saying things like that. You make me scared too.\" And once we went through a\nwoods, and there was a body where we went through woods \u2014 very big where we walked for\ndays. It \u2014 and there was a body laying there. We had to \u2014 you know \u2014 and it was very scary,\nyou know. I came from a little town, and you know you come from after Sobibor but still it\nwas just \u2014 it was very scary. We walked at night. When it's turned daytime we tried to hide.\nWe tried to hide in houses, but most of the time they didn't want to take us. Sometimes they\ntook us for money but most of the time not.\nWe slept in the woods, and we and when we walked near to an other town. We walked on\nthe stars, on the stars; on the Wagen\u2019\u201d\u00ae, I think, on the Wagen. That was Chaim's part. We\nwalked on the Wagen. So that's \u2014 Chaim want to go to the farmer where he worked before\nthe war. Now in the war, he worked by a farmer; and he thought he goes to the farmer where\nhe worked and perhaps this man will hide us. So we walked on the stars and we walked two\nweeks. One night we, we, we couldn't find somebody, and we were hidden in a hayloft, in a\nhayloft. And we were hidden there; and little kids were, were playing outside and they go,\nthey climbing all on there and we were hiding under this, this hay. Well, how much can a kid\nhave come up you? And they saw us and they run off saying, \"Jews!\"; when everybody\nknows of course of the uprising so we jumped out of there. And we started walking in\ndaytime and there came two farmers with a wagon and they say to us, \"Would you like to go\nwith us?\" And Chaim say, \u201cyes,\u201d that we go with them. So Chaim went in one car and I went\nin the other. There were two men what belonged together; and Chaim understand Polish, but\nthe people didn't think perhaps we had understood them. But they were planning to kill us\nand take our money and Chaim say, \"Selma, jump!\" And I jumped and he jumped, so then\nwe walked farther. Was very dangerous, very dangerous. I remember once I was very thirsty,\nand it was a very beautiful farm. And I asked the woman if I could have some water, and she\nsay, \"No, Jew!\" And she, you know, was sitting there. It was very nice. She was very nice\ndressed, and with a little baby, and next to her; and it was, you know, it was very \u2014 it 1s\ncomparing with the Polish Jews went through, is it nothing but it was very \u2014 you were a\nnothing, you know. We walked many times, and there came a dog in back of us, and you\nwere scared for everything and sometimes you saw an, an animal with eyes. You so used to\neyes and you was laying there in the woods, it, 1t was a very scary time. We didn't have to\neat. We walked two weeks. We ate the, the carrots what we saw in the fields and, and we\n'\u00b0 wagon (German); \u201cDer Groke Wagen\u2019 or \u201cThe Big Wagon\u201d is a colloquial German term for\nthe constellation Ursula Major.\nwere wet. And you couldn't wash yourself, and we were on the lice and we were dirty and I\nhad, scabies and, and skin disease, what is a very \u2014 I had it worse than Chaim. He never that\nproblem. That came always to me. And you were very dirty. It was \u2014 so we walked two\nweeks long and we couldn't find anything. One night we came to a farmer and Chaim asked\nhim if he could hide us, and the farmer say \u2014 and we sleep, slept in the hay \u2014 he say, \"I\ncannot do it. Where I sleep are too many people around, but my brother lives very separate\nsomewhere. Perhaps he can do it.\" What was wonderful, this man had a wagon and he put\nChaim on the wagon and put bushes on top of it so nobody could see it, and he dressed me\nlike a Polish woman with a handkerchief and clothes from his wife on. And he brought us to\nhis brother, what was very dangerous. When they would have caught him, they would have\nkilled his family. They would burn down his whole farm and it was a very dangerous thing\nto do. Very \u2014 we, we give this man perhaps of course some money, but not much. I don't\nknow, I have no idea, but we give him some money. He brought us to his brother. But his\nbrother \u2014 we came to his brother, Adam Nowak and his wife.\nAnd they \u2014 we in the evening we were allowed to wash ourselves. Now Chaim had this\nmoney hidden in a bandage on his leg and so when he was washing himself I think the\nfarmer saw there was a lot of money, that's what I think. I, I definitely \u2014 he did it for the\nmoney. He was too dumb to do it for something else, and we say to him, \"We give you all\nthe money what we have. We give you everything we have. Can we stay here?\" So we give\nhim all the money what we have. I have no idea how much it was. And he hide us over the\nwar. We stayed there nine months. What was \u2014 what I told you before, was very dangerous.\nWe stayed in an attic. And we slept on hay with beams and it was a roof also from hay, with\nstraw, and it was little holes in. We couldn't \u2014 we're not allowed to talk and we're not allowed\nto walk. The only thing what we could do was looking through this little hole where what we\ncould see. And in the summer it was so hot that you couldn't \u2014 the mosquitoes and the flies \u2014\nyou can imagine the, the cows were under us. They came on top of us so we laid nude to\nsave the little bit clothes what we had because we \u2014 I had these scabies and it was very, very\ncontagious. And the woman put our clothes in, in an oven, so everything got really burned\nwhat, what \u2014 so we didn't have much clothes. That little bit what we had we saved so, we, we\ndidn't wore it so much; and there was, there were full with flies so that so we didn't do\nanything then shaking the fly, and in the winter it was very, very cold. They gave us a, a\nblanket. We had a blanket, to put over. We got very little food when it was just \u2014 they were\nallowed it to bring us only once a day food, so they brought us a little bit bread, and we put it\nsometimes between our head and, at night the rats came to take it away. We, we were full\nwith lice. I had this, abscess under my arm and Chaim too in his neck from lice. Once in a\nwhile we could, wash ourself, but when she saw that we had so scabie and she was afraid, to\nbring us back.\nShe was, she was afraid that also that one day that we didn't give her all the money; so, we\nhad to go out of the place where we slept at night. Sometimes also she let us in the living\nroom and that we washed like I told you. So that was later on not anymore because we didn't\nwalk so we could, I couldn't hardly walk anymore. I was very under-nourished. And we had\nto sleep with the pigs a few nights, what they smelled terrible and it was \u2014 I was \u2014 that was\nhorrible. I remember, I remember there was a cuckoo flying over us, and Chaim say, \"Selma,\nbe quiet. That brings us luck.\" He was such a good guy. He always helped me up. I was very\ndepressed and very upset about this time. I didn't know that I was pregnant. I was \u2014 I didn't\nget heavier because I was laying. We were not allowed to walk, and I was, I didn't have my\nperiod all these months; not, also not in camp, not at all, and I was, when I came to camp,\nvery heavy from all the water retains in your body. And I didn't know I was, pregnant, and\nwe both didn't know and, so we and so had liberty for. So I was very, very upset and very\ndepressed, and I had a little diary and, Chaim say, \"Write in your diary.\" And that helped me.\nThat helped me a lot. I had a little pencil. You cannot read it any, almost not anymore,\nbecause it was just written with a pencil. And, we had a pail in the middle from us, and that\nwas our bathroom and once a week they cleaned it and I remember when we had, some kind\nof a kale. It was such a smell that, you could almost not inhale. you could almost not live,\nsuch a smell was there from the pail, and there was no cover on. till now we eat not that kind\nof a kale. so when were out, they put us back in the same place. We were hidden there. And\nthe rats run around us. We didn't have anything to do. I\u2014 and from the beginning I was\nknitting. She made her own linen on the spinning wheel; and I was knitting for her. But the\nkid \u2014 it was a little boy \u2014 wore that clothes. And the neighbors say, \"How you got that nice\nclothes from?\" So I couldn't knit anymore either, because, the neighbors were, were\nsuspicious. There was, storks there settled on the farm, and we could see them. So we didn't\nhave anything to do and we were watching these storks. So one, one day the storks went\naway, so the farmer comes to us and say, \"You have to go. Could not one of you, have you\nany more \u2014 you have to go.\" And we say, \"Why?\" Because when storks go away that, that\nbrings, then there is something going on, there's a supersti\u2014 superstition and he say, \"Do you\nwatch the storks?\" And we say, \"Yes.\" \"Have you stopped watching the storks?\" Thank God\nthe storks came back! Also when she find out that I were pregnant, she want to send us\naway; and we say, \u201cNo, I'm not pregnant. I'm just...,\u201d and we didn't know either. \"It's not\ntrue,\" and you know; we talked her into it, so she let us stay. But she was still planning to\nsend us away. Also, we one day we hear some maybe shooting and we asked her why they're\nshooting, and he say, \"They're shooting a, a Jew. They shot a Jew because he had such nice\nboots on, and the people want to have his boots so they shot the Jew.\" Also Chaim's best\nfriend, what was the fireman in Sobibor, he went to a farmer and he say, \"I have a lot of\nmoney with me. Will you hide me?\" And the farmer say, \"Yes.\" And at night he came with a\nhayfork and killed him. So we were very lucky. Very lucky. So in July 1944, we heard the\nwar coming near to us, the Bug. We hear, the, the Germans going back. We heard the war\nand you hear them coming. You hear them coming already. So one day a little boy from the\nneighbor's saw a bird going up where we are, and he was running after this bird, and he saw\nus. By luck the Germans were already fly \u2014 running away. You could see it, the Germans\nrunning away, from that little hole what we had and it was very open field all around; and the\nlittle boy\u2014 so they let us stay. So, where was I?",
        "Q: About that little boy...",
        "A: Oh, that little boy came over, so then we hear the war coming nearer. We hear the war\ncoming nearer, and so we were lucky that this boy came just in the right time. The \u2014 one day\nAdam came to us and say, \"I think the war is over.\" And the airplanes coming over already,\nthen you couldn't hear, so we went out. I remember Chaim went out by himself. I think, \"Oh,\nGod, he doesn't come back!\" But he came back. And then I went out and I was in the sixth\nmonths pregnant. We had to hide in the in the fields, in the fields because the airplanes came\nover and it was war going on, and that took a day\u2014 I don't know how long it took. It was a\nvery short time. After that we stayed a few days, but we were very under-nourished and we\nstayed a few days and we were sitting 1n the field and Chaim helped the farmer a little bit in\nthe field with the hay. And then he heard \u2014 they were talking in the village that they want to\nkill us, the Jews. They want to kill us. So the farmer took us and brought us to Chelm, and\nwhen we came to Chelm, we thought we were the only Jews left. And we came to Chelm.\nWe found some more Jews. Because we thought every concentration camp was like Sobibor.\nSo we thought, you know, there were no Jews left. So we came to Chelm, and there came all\nthe Jews what were left. Was one house where one Jewish family, and, and we went to that \u2014\nwhere there were more Jews and we went and we stayed in there. We had no clothes. We\nhad no money, absolutely no money. And there were about hundred Jews in that room. We,\nwe, had no, nothing, absolutely nothing, just what we had on. And we came and I was\npregnant. That was what my husband never liked to hear \u2014 he doesn't want to talk about it.\nHe thinks that's terrible. We, we, we didn't have anything, so I started sewing, even for\nEsther Raab. I started sewing by hand, and we, we had nothing, no clothes to put, no\nblankets to put over us at night and we slept up the ground. There was one small bed; and\nbecause I was pregnant, they give us that bed, I remember. And so Chaim had to go in the\narmy. He had to go in the army and I didn't speak a word Polish. I didn't speak almost no\nYiddish. And I spoke German, but the Jews what, what they couldn't understand me; not\nsome, most of them not. And we had no money, and he had to go in the army. He had to go\nfight for \u2014 with the Polish army, so, so he \u2014 some \u2014 we spoke with somebody, and he could\nstart working in a hospital as nurse and they thought, we thought that he doesn't have to go in\nthe army this way. So he worked as nurse. Chaim cannot see blood and there came once \u2014 I\nremember was a train and all people died almost, and he had to help and all these sick people\ncutting off the legs; and they're very primitive there still in that time. I don't know how, now.\nAnd so \u2014 maar\u2019\u2019, after a while he made \u2014 I don't know if he made money but we know \u2014\nyeah, he had to make some money. Of course, we had to eat; and I start cooking for all these\npeople. I remember I start cooking and I didn't know how to cook Polish. When I was Dutch\nand in Holland they, they cook like in America a little bit, not, not like Poland, Pole. And I\nburned myself and I burnt my leg. It was very deep wounds and there was no doctor. And,\nach, it was a mess. And, and I started sewing, so after a while we heard that Chaim had to go\nin the army anyway and also Chaim start selling gasoline. I don't know, he started doing\nsomething. I don't remember exactly what he did but he made a little bit money and also he\ngot to know some people and the people went back to Sobibor. When they hide, so many\n'\u201d but (Dutch)\nJews hide money in the ground in Sobibor, and they went back to Sobibor to get the money.\nThey started killing each other there in Sobibor because they start fighting. That, what I, I\nsaw \u2014 \"That's my money,\" and \"That's your money.\" So I said to Chaim, \"You don't go back\nto Sobibor. We brought it this far, and we will make it without this money.\" So he didn't go\nback. So somebody came and had some money and the money was rotten and the money \u2014\nbecause it was moisture in the ground and the number from these dollars was gone. So said\nChaim to him, \"You know, I know somebody.\" Chaim got to know some people. My\nhusband 1s very honest. \"I can perhaps change that money for you.\" It was a hundred dollar\nbill. We put that hundred dollar bill under our pillow at night, under our clothes. We had not\na pillow. Under his head, and somebody stole it at night away from him, and we had no idea\nwho \u2014 just everybody knows there from each other. There's just a few Jews what was left\nthere. So the man say, \"You have to give me that money.\" So if Chaim made a little bit\nmoney he paid him off. Right away, you know, he paid him a little bit money. I have to tell\nyou a story what was 20 years later. We lived in Israel. Twenty years later we lived 1n Israel.\nI come back to the other 20 years later we lived in Israel and all the Jews from Sobibor came\ntogether. And we had to go there too. And I see this man what I, what wanted the hundred\ndollar bill from us, and I say, \"Do you remember the hundred dollar bill?\" I opened my big\nmouth. \"That he stole it under our head, and it was your hundred dollar bill.\" He said, \"Yes, I\nremember.\" The next day he came to us in Beth Yitzhak, where we lived in Israel. He said,\n\"He owe me hundred dollars.\" We give it to him. What Chaim say that, \u201cThis man comes to\nus and makes himself that low, he needs the hundred dollars.\u201d So anyway we lived \u2014 we\nwent away from there and there came somebody what he also was a survivor from Sobibor,\nand we told him the story. We don't know what to do. Chaim had to go in the army and I'm \u2014\n\u201cWhat will I do?\u201d And he say, \"You know what you do? You go to this village where I live,\nand I give you \u2014 and you change your name, and grow a mustache and make yourself five\nyears older and you don't have to go in the army anymore.\" So that's what we did. So we\ndrove from one village, in between we, we, we went already from Chelm, and we met this\nman somewhere on the way and we drove in freight wagons and we were hitch hiking and\nwe were sitting in the freight wagons and we went from one place to the other and I couldn't\nwalk and it was just \u2014 and we slept on the floors and we were very \u2014 we didn't have anything\nand we were \u2014 it was 1n a horrible time. Anyway, we went from one place to the other; and\nfinally we met this guy and he said, \"You come to that in that village,\" and we went to that\nvillage. It was Parczew. Very small village. And we came in there and there was a Jewish\nwoman, she had a little grocery store and she say to us, \"I have a little apartment. You can\nlive there. A real apartment, a Polish apartment.\" And we went in there and there was no, no\n\u2014 was no water and there was no bathroom and we stayed in that apartment and \u2014 yeah \u2014 we\nstayed in that apartment. And Ula \u2014 Chaim had to go away and make some money, so Chaim\nwent where the Germans pulled away. He bought some stuff \u2014 I don't know \u2014 what he could\nsell by us. I don't know what he bought. Shoe, shoe laces, and shoe cream and little bit\nmoney what we had, perhaps ten dollars, fifty. And that he bought up, and it was far away;\nand then he brought it back where we lived, and he could sell it at a profit. From that profit\nwe lived. We had nothing. And I was all alone in Parczew, and I was pregnant. In between it\nI got the baby, I think \u2014 yeah \u2014 I got the baby. And was terrible, and I had to go a\u2014 I didn't\nknow how you got a baby, and he didn't know how you got a baby, and we didn't know why\nthe pain started and I don't.... Anyway, we had to walk five miles or two miles or three miles\nto the school where I got the baby; and they were all antisemites there. And laying there and\nI didn't know and it was \u2014 I was six months, six months laying flat so it was very difficult\nbirth and it was a first child. So I was laying there five days and five nights in labor-that I\nremember exactly\u2014in labor; and Chaim was not allowed to come because he wasn't, he had \u2014\nI don't know \u2014 was \u2014 I don't remember. Anyway, we had a little boy and we went back to the\n\u2014he picked me up with the wagon \u2014 that's a big story \u2014 any way he picked me up with the\nwagon. You want to know? This is terrible. You know, first of all, they, they came \u2014 the\ndoctor came to me and said to me, \"If you don't stop screaming, we'll throw you out on the\nstreet.\" Because they don't give me anything. They didn't give you anything for the pain; and\nthey didn't give me anything and it was the first baby and it, it was horrible. And I didn't\nknow what to do, and, and how to handle this pain; and finally after five days, one of the\npeople what was laying Polish not-Jewish people was laying around. They say, \"You had the\nshowing, so perhaps it's time.\" And so they came, and I had to walk to a room; and 1n two\nminutes the baby was there, of course, after five days laying there. And then have to walk\nback to the other room, and I was laying 1n bed and they didn't want to touch me, the doctors,\nbecause I was full with these scabies and I had lice. No. I didn't have lice. I had also scabie. I\nhad not also the scabie \u2014 a little bit of scabie, but it was almost gone. It was almost gone, but\nthey didn't want to touch me because I was Jewish. Well, not-Jewish doctors, and they\nlooked under the bed. When they saw no blood under it, they say, \"Oh, everything was\nokay.\" So I say to Chaim, \"I have to get away from here. I don't want to stay here a minute\nlonger.\" So he came with a wagon and he picked me up and he brought us to that apartment,\nthe baby and me. I didn't, I didn't have anything for this baby. In between from my own little\nbit what I had, I made some \u2014 sewed by hand some clothes for this baby. You know, when I\nwas a teenager I didn't see many babies, so I really didn't know what babies was wearing. So\nfrom my imagination I made \u2014 I was very handy always with doing things by hand, so I\nmade \u2014 sewed clothes from Chaim's little bit what he had; and from my little bit what I\nclothes on, I sewed clothes for the baby, so that little bit we had and I think we got from\npeople a bed where we could put a baby in. Now Chaim timmered'\u00ae a bed we made from \u2014\nmade himself a bed what we stole wood from old houses in the village; and he also made a\nbed where we could sleep on in that village. But we still had our own clothes what was our\nblanket, and it was cold already. It was October the baby born. No, the baby was born in\nOctober \u2014 yeah \u2014 the baby was born in October. And the apartment, the windows, there was\n\u2014 the windows, it was openings there as big as your hand. In the morning when you woke up,\nit's ice. Everything was ice in the, you know, the, the \u2014 from your breathing, everything was\nice. And so we couldn't let the baby sleep by themself. It would freeze to death right away.\nSo finally the other Jews what lived in this village heared about us, and they give us some\nfeather bed. Before already the baby was born. But the feather bed was full with fleas. I\nnever forgot. Ah was horrible. At night you could almost not sleep from the fleas, so I\nremember I hang it \u2014 Dutch people are very clean, and I was very clean and very proper, you\nknow. So I put \u2014 cleaning and scrubbing, that was my \u2014 we had nothing, but that apartment\nwhere we lived was so clean; so I hang it always outside. I thought it will kill the fleas, in the\n'\u00ae built (Dutch)\nfreezing will clear the fleas. But it don't. They go inside these feathers and when it gets\nwarm, they're getting out. So anyway, this would be the \u2014 that was not the worst we \u2014 you\nknow, the loneliness that I was there and I still was isolated from everybody. I couldn't talk\nto anybody. What could I talk with the baby? I couldn't even go to the doctor with the baby,\nbecause there wasn't nothing. I never went off with the baby to the doctor. And I cried so\nmuch that there was neighbors that, that the walls were very thin, that the neighbors made\nthe same sound already from my crying. Because I felt it was worse than camp almost\nbecause I had not to talk with anybody, and just that I was sitting with this baby. Maar\u2019,\nChaim had to go away to make some money, that the only way that he \u2014 I don't know. That\nwas the way it was.",

When we went down from where we were hidden, the war was over.\nWhen we went down, where the farmer \u2014 and we went down, the war was \u2014 that was the end\nof the war. We saw the two Russian walking. And I remember I went to him and I kissed\nhim, and I say, \"Oh, you freed us!\"",
        "Q: You kissed...?",
        "A: The Russian, the Russian soldiers, because they freed us. They didn't do anything to us. They\nwere also, not to the farmer. They didn't do anything in Poland to the people what they freed.\nIn Germany, they started doing that, but not to the Russian soldiers when they came to\nPoland, they didn't do anything to us. Because the Poles suffered, too. But the Russians\nsuffered tremendous from the Germans. What's \u2014 how many got killed in, in Russia, in\nStalingrad, and Leningrad; and so they were very nice to us. So in 1943, in July, the war was\nover. We were freed. 19\u2014 1944. 1944, July. 1943 we run away. October 14th we run away\nfrom concentration camp and nine months later in July, I think July \u2014 nine months later \u2014\nJune or July, we got freed in ....",

        "Q: And what happened between the end of the war and '57?",
        "A: We, when we were in that village, one night we heard that, we heard that they want to kill all\nthe Jews in that village \u2014 partisans, the not-Jewish partisans in the woods. So middle of the\n19\nbut (Dutch)\nnight we went to Lublin. We rented a \u2014 or somebody took us with a truck. I don't know. I\nthink somebody with a truck what also ran away, went to Lublin, and we stayed in Lublin\nwith Podchlebnik~\u201d, also survivor from Sobibor. That was one of the survivors what run\naway from Sobibor. And we stay \u2014 and he was already a long time and he was already a big\nshot. He made already a lot of money. So when we were there Chaim met some Dutch\npeople, and they told him that they're planning to go over the land to Russia. They organized\nsome Dutch people \u2014 was also a Dutch captain \u2014 they organize all the Dutch people. Chaim\nsay he was Dutch. In between Chaim say he was Dutch, and he went \u2014 we went over\nRomania, Hungary, and we took three months in freight wagons with 140 people, with two \u2014\nthey made two layers out of it. We slept down with the baby, with a sick baby 1n between. I\ngot dysentery, and the baby got dysentery; and we stayed and we went, with, and we didn't\nget much to eat, and no, washing \u2014 not to wash yourself. I nursed, I nursed the baby. So, and\nwe went to, we stayed in Chernovitz. That is Romania. We stayed there two weeks in a camp\nwith gypsies and all people that were \u2014 that Hitler went after, what were survivors....",

        "A: So tell Chaim, \"Tell that story.\" That's very interesting. The baby died on the way to, to\nHolland, on the boat. When we went on the boat, the baby died on the boat from food\npoisoning and died and was buried in the sea.\nTECHNICAL CONVERSATION",
        "Q: So you came to America in '5S7.",
        "A: We went to Holland. And from Holland, we went to Israel; when I didn't want to live in\nHolland anymore. My whole family was killed \u2014 everybody, nothing left. I didn't want to\nlive in Holland. So, he would like to live in Holland. I didn't \u2014 compare from Pole, Holland is\ngorgeous; but I, I didn't want \u2014 I couldn't live in Holland anymore. And it was very hard for\nhim, too, in Holland, to start \u2014 he's a businessman. It was very hard to start in Holland a\nbusiness. Holland, you have to go three years to school, we had already between us two\nchildren. We have two children. So, you could very easy go to Israel, but you couldn't come\nin to America.

        "A: 1922.",
        "A: Yes, in Holland it was very nice to live. It was something like I live now, like the children\ngrowing up in Brandford, Connecticut. I had only not-Jewish friends. I had a few Jewish\nfriends; and, it was very assimilated. The way the Jews really lived was that we had \u2014 the\nJudaism was more in the house. I mean we lived in the country, so it was more in the house\nand, and not outside. So, I don't know how to explain it, we, we didn't go with \u2014 nobody\nwent with beards or with peyos\u2019. Something like that, we didn't see it. But life was very nice\nin Holland. was not antisemitism. Was no antisemitism, and my parents had a hotel. They\nhad a kosher hotel, and they had the only kosher hotel in the state where we lived in.\nLike Holland 1s all divided in states, and it was the state of Overijssel; and so a lot of Jewish\npeople came to our hotel because we had also \u2014 it was a small hotel. It was on a cattle\nmarket; and we lived \u2014 a part of \u2014 most, most the business came from the cattle market, as is\ntypical in Europe. It's not so much here. And so we had a lot of Jewish salesmen. They slept\nover in our hotel. So it was a lot of Judaismic, and Jewish people came always to the hotel.\nAnd also when there was a kosher, wedding party or something like that came, that was\nalways catered in our hotel. So a lot of Jewish life went on in our hotel. My mother was very\nreligious. My father was not that religious; but we had to be religious because we had a\nkosher hotel and that goes together with it.\n' earlocks worn by Hasidic Jews (Hebrew)",
        "A: I went to school, the elementary school; and then I went to high school. And the war broke\nout when I was not even eighteen years old. So I finished high school, and then, was \u2014 that\nwas the end because right away we were not allowed to go to school. We were not allowed\nto go work. We were not allowed to do anything. That was, that was the first thing what the\nGerman did in Holland, to take us out from, from learning and anything. I started working, in\na hospital, in the hospital, because I, I couldn't sit home and do nothing. And I start working\nin the beginning in the hospital, and cooking for Jewish patients. But that was, after a short\ntime that was also was not allowed anymore. Like in '41, that was not allowed anymore. So,\nthen I started helping all the Jewish people. I remember in that time we had already a star \u2014\nwe had to wear a star. And, I went to another \u2014 I took the star off. I always was a little bit\nagainst. And I took the star off, and I went with the train to another town and helped an older\nfamily, an older couple, what they were not allowed to have any help anymore from not-\nJewish people. And we were not allowed to do really anything at all. So, that was a very\nshort time. Also my, my, my father died on a heart attack in 1941; and on May the 10th the\nwar broke out in Holland. The Germans came into Holland on May the 10th, and the war\nwas only five days. I had two brothers what were in the, in the army. And it was a very\nnervous atmosphere, because we had a lot of Jewish people in the hotel because a Friday \u2014\nfrom Friday or Saturday the war started and they stayed\u2014there were a lot of Jewish people\nwould stay overnight\u2014and they stayed 1n our hotel, and everybody was tremendously \u2014 was\npanicky.\nVery panicky right away, and because they know what was in Germany happened. It was\nnext to the, the border was next to where we lived. You know, Holland is very small. And\nso, they, they, they run away and some\u2014we have a lot of water in Holland \u2014 the Ijssel was a\nbig river, and they left the car in the water. They drove them in the water, and they went\nfarther together; because they thought that the German cannot take it. So it was a big panic.\nAnd after five days \u2014 well, there was a lot of traitors in Holland so the war didn't took long in\nHolland. After five days the war was over. And they didn't start right away, the Germans.\nThey did it very slowly on; because they know that they cannot do it like it was in Poland,\nright away, and in Germany perhaps. But they did it very slowly on, and very often \u2014 very \u2014\nthey did it in a way that no \u2014 nobody felt really that there was something going on and it\nwould happen something, serious things.",
        "A: In 1941, there was a club in Holland, and it was a men's club. Very sophisticated, for\nlawyers; and, and the German right away took that building. So one of the head of the police\nand the owner from that men's club came to my mother and say, you know, \"Why don't you\ngo out of the hotel, so the Germans don't take it. And we take your hotel and that you will\nsave.\" And my mother was very upset, of course. They really\u2014 my father died, what I told\nyou \u2014 they really built that hotel by themselves, really built it. And to leave everything, just\nto go out what you have in your hand, was very hard. So I don't remember exactly what was\ngoing on. I know after many talking with the police and with this man, the owner, my mother\nhad to go out of the hotel and could just take with her\u2014they talked her into it, perhaps it was\nthe best-they could just go out of the hotel. And there was another Jewish family in our\nhome town what, had a little house, very poor little house in a very poor area, and, we moved\nin that little house in. But I have to tell \u2014 yeah \u2014 it was already \u2014 we moved into the hotel in\nand in that little house in, and, and it was horrible. There was no hot water and there was no\nbathroom and it was a very poor neighborhood and I really hated it, I remember; and it was a\nvery difficult time because, you were not allowed to go out and you hear the German already\nwalking through your door. And also one day the German took all the people what went over\nto another religion, like there were was a Jewish boy by the name Wynberg and he went over\nto the Catholic religion, and they picked up all the people what went over to the, the Jews\nwhat went over to the Catholic religion. So they didn't know \u2014 they picked my mother and\nmy two brothers and me. My oldest brother was married. I, I come from a family from four\nchildren and I was the youngest. I had three older brothers. And they took us already to the\nGerman border. But in Holland was a Jewish Raad\u2019, a Jewish group of people. What they\nsay they help the Jews going to, Poland and Germany, but they went after it and they know\nthat they made a mistake and we were already one or two days.",
        "A: Because that was a mistake. It was a mistake that they took us because, they didn't know that\nthe, the Wynberg, that boy, that he was it. They thought that we were it. It was a mistake.\nAnd it \u2014 because we had the same name. And so they sent us already \u2014 and always we had a\nlittle backpack staying by the door because everybody knows already that it would be\nperhaps something like that happened, that, that we would be called up, so we went to that \u2014\nEnschede was the city. We went to Enschede. It was on the German border. And when we\nwere there the Dutch Jewish organization, the Jewish Raad was there \u2014 I don't know how it 1s\nin English. They, they went working very effective and they got us back to my, to Zwolle,\nwhere I lived. And I remember when we came back.",
        "A: I don't know, exactly. They talked with the Germans and they told them that they have the\nwrong people and that we were the wrong people and that they have to have this other boy\nwhat he went over to the Catholic religion and not we. We were Jews, and, and that's the\nreason, they got us back. They went after that they said they had the wrong people. But that\nwas just a postponing of a time. And so we went \u2014 I remember we came back and all the\n* Council (Dutch)\npeople were standing on the street and, and everybody was cheering that we came back and,\nand everybody came to our house and congratulated us. That's the reason it's so in my\nmemory, that thing, that way. But, it didn't help much.",
        "A: Nothing happened. We just\u2014",
        "A: Our life was \u2014 we were not allowed to do anything, so it was very, very upsetting. It was\nvery strenuous and it was very nervous. And, and the men had to go already to, work camp\nbut I'm talking now where it's already the end of 1941, beginning 1942 or so. And, the men\nhad to go to work camp. And I remember my brother was \u2014 one of my brothers was hidden\nand he just got married not long before, and her father had to go a work camp. And they\nstarting already talking; they say, \"Oh, when somebody goes to a work camp, then my father\nwill be sent away. So you better come out of the hiding place.\" So my brother came out of\nthe hiding place and her father \u2014 they would have sent away anyway \u2014 my \u2014 you know, the\nrumors go around. You didn't know what was going on. And so my brother came out. And\nthe men went to working camps, but they were allowed to go weekends home; so nobody\nsaw something difficult in it, not so serious 1n it. They thought, \"Oh, they have to go there for\nhelping, doing things,\" and they came weekends home. So in between, also, there were\nthings going on in, in my home town. That a young group of men didn't have anything to do.\nThey're all \u2014 everybody what had a business was taken away already for the Germans and\nthey put Volk-, traitors what went with the Germans\u2014they put in these businesses. So the\nmen didn't have anything to do. And we were not allowed to go out of the house after five\no'clock at night; we have to stay in. So these men, eight young married men, came together\nand played card. And one of the traitors, a Dutch man, went to the German and say, \"You\nknow, that bunch of Jews sitting there and playing card.\" And they took these eight men and\nsent them to Poland. So that was going on a lot. It was a, a lot of Dutch, not-Jewish people,\nwhat were traitors; and you had to be very, very careful, to not to talk and not to, say\nanything. I tried to, to, to do something, what, what I told you I went to Apeldoorn and\nhelped\u2014and that's a little town not far from my hometown\u2014and helped an older family, an\nolder couple. But it was after a very short time also very dangerous. And there was not much\nwhat you could do. I remember one day I was walked in my street, and in the street where I\nwas, was a big house and there was a Catholic priest lived in there. And the Catholic priest\ncame to me and he say \u2014 he start talking to me, and he said, \"How do you think that you can\nsave your life?\" And I say, \"The only way that I, that the Jews can save their life, is when\nnot-Jewish people take us in.\" And, the same evening he came to me and he say, \"I have a\nhouse for you. I have a place for you where you can go. And be ready tomorrow morning at\nfive o'clock, six o'clock,\" I don't remember exactly what time, but very early in the morning,\n\"with your bicycle, and a little bit what you can take with you on the bicycle, and I will bring\nyou there.\" And that what I did. I remember I say goodbye to my mother and to my brothers,\nand I never saw them again. That was the last time, time that I ever saw my family. And, we\nwent to Utrecht, and I went to, a family \u2014 no, a woman, what she was a nurse. She came also\nfrom my hometown. I went to her house and, I stayed with her a few months.\nAnd that was very, a very nice place with this woman to live; what she was the whole day\ngone and I was the whole day alone. And, then she had another family what she want to take\nin, and I went to another family's house. A very large house with, a lot of room, and I was\nthere the maid. I had to clean the house, and I had to, was not allowed to talk to anybody. I\nwas not allowed to go open the door ever. I was not allowed to go out of the house; and there\nwas no food in the house and it was very hard already, food in Holland. Holland \u2014 they\nsuffered tremendous in the war. They didn't have, much to eat and they had, didn't have\nmuch, it was very difficult; and these people, they really didn't have anything in the house. I\nremember they cooked the bones ten times to make soup and they had the cat's plate already\nwith it. It was very awful fam-\u2014 it was a very awful time for me to be there alone. And, I, I\ndidn't I didn't get much to eat there. I remember I stole sometimes an apple, or I put in a\nsandwich under my pillow that at night when I came to my bed that I had something to eat\u2014\nbecause there was, really nothing to eat there. These people \u2014 when I was there a few\nmonths, they had another Jewish family and they took in; an professor it was there\u2014I met his\nwife, and they came upstairs and they want to use me also as a maid. I didn't let 1t. They had,\nthey wanted I cleaned the oven and things like that, and I didn't do that. Because I was so\nvery lonely and so unhappy, one day they told me that not far from them is another Jewish\nfamily hidden; and, I want to go and visit them. And I was very happy that I could talk with\nsomebody. So after three months being alone 1n, in that, locked up in that house and not\nreally having to talk with anybody. And they were very Christian. They really tried me to get\nover to their religion too, but, you know, it was very \u2014 it was not very pleasant time. I went,\nto this family, and the moment that I came into this family's house, the police came. And, I\nwas very sure that I was safe because I had a passport and it was \u2014 every Jew in Holland had\nto have a passport with a \u201cJ\u201d on it, and the underground took my \u201cJ\u201d out of the passport.\nWell, I didn't know that you hold it to the light that you can see the J, so I came there and I \u2014\nand when the police came. There were also police what were with the German. Dutch police\nthat went over to NSB\u2019, as they called them; and when police came I say I'm a nurse and\nhave come to help these people. And so they took my passport and hold it to the light and\nthey saw the \u201cJ\u201d and that was it. So there wasn't \u2014 there was a family hidden there, a lawyer.\nAnd what I didn't know, the people where I was hidden were traitors. That what I heard\nwhen I came back. Twenty-eight Jews are caught after that I, after that I was the first one\nwhat was hidden there; and nothing happened to the people what lived in the house. Always\nwhen the German found Jews in an house, they took the whole family \u2014 most of the time the\nwhole family, but sometimes just the men. And there never was happen something to these\npeople, but I didn't know. I heard it all after the war. These men went to jail, but because I\ndidn't know, after the war I, I testified for that they saved \u2014 that what I know.\n> National Socialistische Beweging (Dutch); National Socialist Movement.\nLater on I heard what was happened to them. So anyway, the police tried to get to know\nfrom me where I was hidden, but I didn't want to tell because I thought I know there was\nanother Jewish family there, and they have a chance then to, to get away. And so I didn't tell\nthem; and the people where I was caught told them. So in the evening I had to go back to the\nplace where I was hidden and they went to my room. I was in the attic. I had a room in the\nattic. And they opened the bed and they found that sandwich what I told you what I put\nsometimes under my pillow what I was very hungry. And they say, \"See! Look what the\nJews did! You know \u2014 see, you give them to eat and still she steals from you!\" I remember\nthat very \u2014 there's not many things that I remember, but that I remember. So anyway I don't\nremember what I took with me or how, but I remember I had to go back to the police station\nin Utrecht. I was a week 1n the police station in Utrecht. I could have got away from there. I\nhad a brother what was married and he was hidden in Utrecht, and I visit him and I didn't get\nalong with my sister-in-law. I still \u2014 she's still alive. I don't get along with her. Anyway, the,\nthe kids were very small; and it was very dirty and it was very poor. And I thought, \"When I\nhave to go to my brother....\" I, I just didn't want to. So the, the police asked me in Utrecht \u2014\nthey know that I could get away, so there was an underground already what I didn't know.\nThat was already 1942, October 1942. I didn't know that there was the underground already\nin Holland, very strong. And, when I and \u2014 I say \u201cno.\u201d I did \u2014 my mother didn't give me any\nmoney. I didn't have any money; and I thought when you have no money, where do I go?\nYou know, you have to go somewhere. So I didn't, go away, and, that \u2014 I remember that,\nmany times they tried to get me out, so in 19\u2014 then I went, from there I went to Amsterdam.\nIn Amsterdam I was, in jail. I was three months 1n jail in Amsterdam.",
        "A: I don't remember.",
        "A: I don't remember. I was together in Utrecht in jail with this family. I don't remember much\nabout it. I remember they had a police, they always \u2014 I was young \u2014 I was nineteen, in\nbetween \u2014 young, good looking at that time, and the head of the police tried to get me also\u2014\nsomething that he wants to take me to his house and \u2014 I don't know, there was something not\nso good. So, I don't remember how we came to Amsterdam. I think by truck, or with a bus; I\nhave no idea, I don't remember that at all. I came \u2014 I remember we came to Amsterdam in \u2014\nwas in jail. I was three months in jail. I remember my family I had in Amsterdam knew\nabout it, and they sent me some \u2014 sometimes things to jail, but, I do \u2014 I was in a cell with,\nseven \u2014 several \u2014 eight, nine women. We didn't get much to eat, every \u2014 everybody \u2014 we\nwere with a professor's wife, and a doctor's wife, and a girl from, beautician, and somebody\nelse from the street; and I, I, you know, it is really very worldly. It was the first time that in\nmy life I met really people what told me things about the world, when I was brought up in a\nvery small town, a very \u2014 confined to a smaller group, area. Anyway, we were three months\n\u2014 I remember once I was laughing. There was \u2014 the girl, the woman what opened, what gives\nus our food, was, was a very mean German woman. And I started once laughing, and she\nsay, \"Do you have a brother that work in so and so hotel?\" And my brother was in a hotel\nschool, and he had to work in a hotel; and she was their maid. So she remembers my brother.\nAnd after that we got better food and we could share that together with the girls in the room.\nI remember also \u2014 I smoked 1n that time \u2014 and I had cigarette and I had no matches. I\nremember I was sitting hours hold my cigarette on the lamp perhaps it started making fire.\nBut it didn't work. So I give the cigarettes on this, on this woman, what was, she was very\nhappy with.\nThere was also one woman what I remember was very beautiful and had very blond long\nhair. And she came from \u2014 her fath\u2014 her husband had an, factory from hats; and she\nsmuggled out all these little papers and she put it in somewhere and she got it out and she got\nmoney in and she was really a, a very rich woman. I remember I came in, and we went after\nthere to another concentration camp; and she was already together with the head of the\nconcentration camp. So I was three months in that ca\u2014 in, in the jail in Amsterdam.",
        "A: Yeah, they were all Jews. They were all Jews. I was over Christmas there till beginning of\nJanuary; I think the first or the second of January. And it, it was a very difficult time. We\nwent also out. They took us out every day and we had to walk around, so like you see in\nmovies, we had to walk around, and \u2014 but they didn't, didn't hit us. They didn't do any,\npunishments to us; but we didn't get much to eat. And it was \u2014 you didn't know what was\nhappen, what would happen to you. After three months we had to go out, and I remember we\nwent to an office and we were standing there with a whole bunch of Jewish girls. Girls from\nmy age, seven, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, nineteen years old. I was already along between\ntwenty years old then. Getting a little bit older. So, we were standing there. I remember one\ngirl was singing, that song, a German song, that \u2014 what will happen to us. I\u2014 we met there\nalso one of the girls what was a survivor, Ursula, Ursula Stern \u2014 Ula Stern \u2014 and we, we\nsomehow stick together. Mimie Katz was one of the girls' name, and we somehow stick\ntogether from that point on. We went together to another concentration camp in Holland,\nOught. That was the \u2014 just the opening from the concentration camp when we came there. It\nwas 1943 and we were one of the first people what came there, because we didn't have any\nblankets and it was in January. We didn't have any blanket. They didn't have much food\nthere, and, there were only wo\u2014 women were separate from the men. The men was 1n the\nother camp, a other part; and we were in one part. The men had it very difficult. They right\naway shaved the hair from the men, that they didn't get to eat. They had to work very heavy\nlabor, and they got punished very badly. Because when I went later to Westerbork I went\ntogether with these men and I met them. We \u2014 I was very lucky, again. there was a man what\nrecognized me, what he came to our hotel, and he said, \"Do you like to have a good job?\"\nAnd I said, \"Yes.\" I \u2014 he said, \"Would you like to be the head of the laundry?\" I said, \"Yes.\"\nI didn't know anything about laundry, but I thought everything is better then; perhaps it looks\ngood. So I worked in the laun\u2014 laundry, and I \u2014 to assort clothes, and they were sent out. And\nmost of the time the half didn't come back, so it was not so good. It was \u2014 everybody was\nvery unhappy. We, we \u2014 the, the \u2014 what I told you the girls what we met in jail, somehow we\nstick a little bit together. I don't know why, but, we know \u2014 when we went to Westerbork,\nwe, we also came together in the, in the same co-\u2014 sitting together in the train. Yeah.",
        "A: No. What I don't remember much. It was three months long. I know we didn't get much to\neat, and I had to work there assorting clothes. And I, I remember the bathrooms were\ntogether and they were very \u2014 a lot of older people and, and, I don't even remember if there\nwere showers. I don't remember. I know we didn't get much \u2014 there was no salt, and we had\nto eat the food without salt; and I couldn't eat it. That's what I remember. I really don't\nremember much about that camp. I remember only that the men had it very difficult. But\nsomehow I, I don't remember much. I may \u2014 that's \u2014 I don't \u2014 it was a very short time. I\nremember more that week what I was in, in Westerbork \u2014 where we went to with the train to\nWesterbork, and I was sitting together with one of the young men from my home town. And\nhe was always very good looking, and I remember he was mar-\u2014 he was 1n love with a\nmarried a woman, and he \u2014 they were sitting together and he looked awful. I mean he \u2014 you\ncould see he didn't get to eat and he \u2014 he looked horrible. And, and, and with his wife, with\nhis, girlfriend, what was his \u2014 and we went together to Westerbork. And when I came to\nWesterbork I remember that, we \u2014 they, they tried to get me out of the barrack where I was\nin, because \u2014 they couldn't get me out, because I was, hidden. And, and they couldn't get me\nout because of that, so my fa\u2014 I had \u2014 there came a brother from my mother. Was there for a\nlong time, with five little children; and she was already a long time \u2014 they were already a\nlong time in Westerbork. Westerbork was not a concentration camp. Westerbork was a\ncamp, but it \u2014 what you could stay in Westerbork. It was safe. That was a camp where only\npeople went through. A lot of people stayed there, and stayed there for a long time; and was\nvery good eating and it was entertaining, and it was like a little village. And when you could\nstay in Westerbork, you were safe for your life; but when I, I couldn't stay there because I\nwas hidden, and I was punished because of that \u2014 because \u2014 I had no chance to stay.",
        "A: I was hidden in, in Holland; and so I\u2014 when you, you had no chance. I was hidden in\nHolland by these not- Jewish people. And I \u2014 what's the word for it? I forget it \u2014 I write it\nalways down, this word, and I forget always that word. When I speak to people I write the\nword down, but I forgot. I had no chance to come out of there, because I was punished\nbecause I was hidden in Holland. When you \u2014 when, when I wouldn't have been hidden; they\nwould have taken you out of your house, you, you could have perhaps stayed there longer.\nSo this uncle tried to get me out of the barracks, but we couldn't \u2014 they couldn't me out, this\nuncle. we stayed there a week, and somehow like Ula, Ursula Stern, and Mimie Katz and\nother \u2014 the other five girls, seven girls where we\u2014I forgot the names from the other ones,\nbecause they went right away later to the gas chamber. So we, just a few girls what I stayed\nin Sobibor with, I remember vividly. So we, we were in Westerbork and we were not\nallowed to go out of this barrack and, that was in \u2014 that was in already April. I was three\nmonths in Vught. And in April, beginning of April I think \u2014 I don't remember the date\nexactly; but it is \u2014 statistically, you can find it out. We, one morning they give us some food\nand we had to go a freight car; and we had to go in this freight car. I remember also not so\nmuch about Westerbork either. I don't know, you know, forty years long we never talked\nabout anything. And when I \u2014 when we talk to people I tell them more about \u2014 not about this\n\u2014I tell more about.... So I don't remember much about that, the little episodes. I remember\nthey didn't do us any harm, and there were no German. Only there was all Jew what we saw,\nwhat worked with us in Westerbork. And you didn't see \u2014 I didn't see any German. There\nwere Germans more outside and, you know, in different places. But in the camp were only\nJews \u2014 in so, in Westerbork. I, I remember now that we had to go into the train. This uncle\nwhat was in Westerbork went with the same transport to Sobibor as I went.\nWe went in the first \u2014 that was the first transport what went to Sobibor in freight wagons. till\nnow they all went in pass \u2014 in regular trains, passagiertrein\u2019, and I was the first one that\nwent. We went the first one that went in freight trains. The freight trains, they put some straw\non the ground and there was a barrel for the toilet in the corner; and I don't remember \u2014 I\nthink it was open but I don't remember exactly, what we had to go to the bathroom. So \u2014 and\nnow we were so, about 60 people they put in the train. And it was very, scary feeling. I\nremember we were all very nervous. We did \u2014 these young girls; we stick together also like\nwe stick together in Westerbork, we stick together and we sat together in that train, in the\ntrain. I think we got some food, because I don't remember they were hungry. But, the \u2014 there\nwere \u2014 in that time we say all Germans were standing outside in Westerbork; and when the\ntrain got closed with the door, and the lock on it, and there was just a little window on top,\nwe were very afraid and we were very scared. There were a lot of older people in the train,\nand, and everybody wants to look through this window; but we were afraid because the\nGermans were shooting later on. When we went away, we stopped many times. The train\nstopped many times. And many times was always shooting on the outside and they were\nwith dogs on the outside, and we could see through this little windows and we could see that\npeople did like that to us. And we didn't know what it was, what 1t means. We thought just\nantisemites. You know, they want to have us dead. We went farther and farther. And the\nfarther we went \u2014 see, we come from Holland and Holland is a little like America; it's small,\nvery sophisticated, little town and you still see more poor, poor people.\n\u2018 Passenger-train (Dutch)\nAnd the farther we came, the poorer the poor people looked, and, and after three days they \u2014\nwe thought we were in Russia. We had no idea. Also, we didn't have \u2014 and I thought I go to\nmy mother. The only thing also in Utrecht, already I thought, \u201cI want to go to my mother and\nmy brothers.\u201d But I forgot to tell you when I was hidden the, the woman \u2014 the man what\nbrought me to Utrecht was my English teacher; and his wife came to me when I was in \u2014\nhidden in, in Utrecht, and she's told me one day that my mother on the way out of the house\n\u2014 she was planning to go hide somewhere \u2014 somebody told the Germans that my mother\nwants to go and hide somewhere and they caught my mother. And they send my mother\nalready to Poland, and my brothers too. My two brothers, and one brother was just married\nalso. And so, so I, I wanted to go to my mother. That's the all what I thought about it; also\nwhen I was in Utrecht, I wanted to go to my mother. That's the only thing what I thought\nabout. And so I didn't want to go, really, hide somewhere because I didn't know there was\nthe underground already that you that you had a chance to save a\u2014 somewhere that\nsomebody would take you in. And, so when I went to, was in Westerbork I thought the only\nthing what I could, go to my mother; and that was that's that we all thought, the girls that\nwere together with me what had already the family were, were, away, thought also they go to\ntheir family. So we had no idea that Holland \u2014 in Holland was, was no antisemitism. We\ndidn't grow up with antisemitism. We didn't grow up to be afraid, that you say something\nand, and, and it would something happen to you. And so, we had no idea what would happen\nto us. So after three days and three nights, we, we came to Sobibor. What, what were \u2014 yeah?",
        "A: I just can recall about the train ride that it was very scary. And how farther we went, how\nmore the people did like that when we were fighting always what who can look outside; so\nwhen we could look outside we were very happy. And, and then when we saw these people,\nwhat they did to us \u2014 we had no idea and that's also what I recall, that \u2014 I don't recall that we\nwere hungry. I remember we didn't have anything to drink. That I remember \u2014 we were very\nthirsty, what was already very hot \u2014 I think was very hot \u2014 I don't know \u2014 we were very\nthirsty. And we didn't have anything to drink and I think there had to be \u2014 and I remember\nthere was a barrel and I think it was hidden because I don't \u2014 we were \u2014 all the people and,\nand we couldn't \u2014 everybody was sitting on the ground. We had nowhere \u2014 nowhere else to\nsit and in, in the straw, but that's all that I remember, that 1t was very scary, that we know\nwhere we go. Well, we had no idea where we went. I remember that we came out at Sobibor.\nThey opened the, the doors; and then we heard screaming and with the whips throwing, and\nwe heard, \"Raus! Raus! Raus! \" That we had to go out of the train with whips and, and\nhitting us already, and, and everybody stumbled over each other. And I remember there was\na trolley. You know, was a trolley, little kipcar\u00ae that goes over. And we saw all the people\nwhat couldn't walk, throwing in them; and little children went in that trolley. And it was very\n> Get out! (German)\n\u00b0 Dump cart (Dutch)\nconfusing, you know, and we had to throw away our baggage, that little package what, what,\nbackpack what we had. We had to throw that tn, in, 1n a place. I remember vividly also that\none woman throwed away her package and her baby went, and, and, she said to German,\n\"Oh, my child! My child!\" And he had a whip and said he, and he hit this woman and saw\nblood from her face coming and said, \"We will take care of this baby. You go!\" So then we\nwent farther and we stick somehow together with these young girls. And we passed all these\nGermans. The \u2014 all, all the SS's were standing there on the side, and we passed all these\nGermans; and they say, \"You're out. You're out.\" And they pull us out, and we settled on the\nside. When I was in jail in Amsterdam, one of the girls\u2014one these women what I told you\nabout the blond hair\u2014say she wants to go always with a German to bed and she thought when\nshe get pregnant perhaps she can get out of Jail.\nSo I didn't know really what she means what she say. But I say to the girls \u2014 we didn't know\nwhat had happened to us \u2014 we stay on the side; and I say to the girls, \"What will happen to\nus?\" \"One shower,\" she always say, \"one bath, and it is all over.\" I remember I say to the\ngirls, \"One bath and it is all over.\" I didn't know even what she was talking about. So we\nstanding there together and we didn't know what's happened to us, if the Germans will use us\n\u2014 we had no idea. We were just standing there on the side. I think, I think we were ten or\ntwelve or twenty \u2014 I don't know exactly how many girls. That's the first transport that took\nyoung girls, Dutch, Dutch young girls out. We were the first Dutch people, and we were\nstanding on the side and when we saw the trans\u2014 we saw all the people passing by. We saw\nthe \u2014 I think the women went first, and then the men went at last. But I don't remember\nexactly. I remember \u2014 saw them walking already that side to the to the gas chamber, that they\nhad to take their clothes off. And I remember that also that I, we heard them speaking to the\ngroup of us standing there, and say, \"You came to Sobibor, and everything will be okay,\u201d\nand we- \u201cHere is a little card. You can write home that you are here in Sobibor and that you\nare \u2014 you go to a work camp.\u201d And we have to take a shower because the \u2014 it it's better for\nyou that you take a shower; so we can, we will give you other clothes.\" That I remember \u2014\nthat they were talking to them. What, what they say exactly, I perhaps remember what I read\nlater about it. But I remember that they talking to them, that they say, \"Here is a card. You\ncan write to Holland.\" For us, we were standing on the side and they brought us to Camp\nOne. Sobibor was divided in\u2014",
        "A: So long that the people came and they were gone. So the men was on the right side \u2014 of the\nmen went first, and then that was nobody there. Was nobody there anymore.",
        "A: We couldn't see it. We were standing on a spot that I\u2014 they were already going to the gas\nchamber, because Sobibor was a death camp. They \u2014 everybody went straight to the gas\nchamber. There was just a very small camp. When we came, there was a very small group of\npeople just what was living and, and working in Sobibor. So all the \u2014 I don't remember \u2014 all\nthe two thousand people that we came with went straight to the gas chamber. So the one\ngroup went already to the gas chamber. We went then to where we slept. The camp was\ndivided in three parts. One camp part we slept, and one camp part we worked and one part\nwas Lager Drei\u2019. One \u2014 Camp One, Camp Two, Camp Three. We called \"Lagers.\" Lager\nDrei was the death camp. When you were once there, or even looked at there, you never\ncame back. So we \u2014 they brought us to Camp One. When we came on in Camp One, I saw\npeople from my home town. I saw boys what I grew up with, as far back as their father and\nmother were my best \u2014 my parent's best friends. And I remember I saw one boy what, what,\nwhat, stayed with us in the hotel\u2014in the wartime, in 1941\u2014because he had to go out of his\nhouse. The German took his house, and he stayed with us. And I was so happy to see them. I\nsaid, \"Hi, how are you?\" And I waved to them. He was just standing there and he didn't say\nanything. And they were very scary and they didn't answer us. So they went to work first,\nand, then we went to work.\nAnd we came to a barrack, and we had to assort clothes. We had to assort clothes. We had to\ndo, first quality, and second quality; and we had to look after what was in the pockets we had\nto take out. And we had to empty, the knapsacks we had to empty. You know, I didn't know\nwhat I was doing. I had no \u2014 that I remember vividly \u2014 I had no idea that thinking that it was\nfrom people that that what came on. It was very stupid, but I didn't \u2014 I had no \u2014 I remember\nthat we all assorted the clothes. And then after, four or five o'clock, I had to assort even the\nclothes. I remember that there was also the clothes from this uncle, from the man with the\nfive children, was also in this transport. I \u2014 at five o'clock we had to go on a roll call, go out\non a roll call, and we were brought to Lager One where we slept. And we came to Lager\nOne, we had to dance for the Germans. There were some Jews what, what had instruments,\nwhat were already longer in camp and they had some instrument. In between the fire was\nburning and you could smell, you know, the \u2014 from bones and the hair \u2014 and the fire was\nburning and there was \u2014 that was like over, over the whole camp. Was very big, very big.\nAnd we had to dance. The Germans were standing there laughing and having fun and some \u2014\nI don't know exactly, but some of the Jews had an instrument. They were playing the music,\nlike a sub-distance from the Germans and it was an order that we had to dance. And Chaim,\nmy husband, asked me to dance; and that was the first time that I met Chaim. I remember he\nlooked terrible. He had no hair and had some hat on, and strange pants he wore. He wore\nalways two pants because, when they hit him then it didn't hurt so much. So he had another\npants on, and, and I \u2014 it was very strange. I, I, I don't remember much about that dancing\nreally, but I remember we had to dance. When I went away from that I met these Dutch boys\nwhat I remember from my home town. And they told me, \"Do you know what that fire\n\u201d camp three (German)\nmeans?\" And I say, \"No.\" And they, they were all married and all the wives went to the gas\nchamber. And they cried, and they told me. And it was very upsetting. I still, I still couldn't\ncomprehend it. I think 1t took me a long time to think about it; that with all these people I\ncame with, that they were dead and \u2014 you know? So, after that we talked together, we got\nvery close. They, they were very hungry. They, we didn't get anything to eat in, in the camp.\nThey didn't work with the barracks. They worked some place else. I was lucky that I start\nworking with assorting clothes; so I had a chance to steal food from the, from the backpacks\nwhat the Dutch people brought when there was transport. They didn't have a chance to, to get\nanything. So after a very short time, there was a German, German Jew, and he was a traitor.\nChaim, my husband, always say, \"He wants to be holier than the Pope,\" this guy. And he\ntold the Germans that the Dutch men- there were seventy-two Dutch men in camp-that they\nwant to run away. We never know if it was truth or if it was just a lie. We really never know,\nbut after a very short time that we were in camp \u2014 and I don't remember have long contact\nwith the Dutch, young men \u2014 I remember they had to go on, on roll call. They had to, Ap\u2014 on\nAppell\u00ae and they \u2014 I remember one of the boys \u2014 Zeehandelaar was the last name, Maurits\nZeehandelaar \u2014 he had a little piece of butter and he brought it to me; says he, \"When I come\nback, save it for me.\" So he give me the little piece of butter and he \u2014 they were shot.\nSeventy-two Dutch boys were shot, so they never came back. So I don't remember much\ntalking to them. So that was a very short time that we was \u2014 after I was in camp that they got\nshot. I, I remember we didn't get much to eat. In the morning we got some black water and\nbread. It was for the whole day. It was like clay. It was very sour and you couldn't eat it. I\ncouldn't eat it. And were \u2014 and I remember that from the beginning the Dutch people always\ntried to get that bread; and we, I gave it to them because, we could we could eat some, we\ncould steal and we had together with us some \u2014 we could make some food. So, they were\nvery hungry. Later on we get more Dutch people in camp. Later on there come more Dutch. I\n\u2014 somehow the Dutch were always, came to us and they wanted to have some food from the\nothers. We had a little group of people. Some \u2014 later on came also, a cousin of mine came to\ncamp, to Sobibor. And so I, we \u2014 and Mimie Katz was another Dutch girl what I was with in\ncamp, and Ula. We had \u2014 we shared our food in the evening when we came together and we\nhelped each other when we got sick and things like that.\nWe \u2014 most of the time we worked assorting clothes. When there came no transport, we had\nto work in the woods and clean the woods. Just there was no work there in that camp. Or we\nhad to clean the railway, rail, railroad. Or we had to throw out the ashes from the \u2014 what we\ngot. We didn't get it. They brought it. In the fields, and we had to assort \u2014 throw it in the\nfields for, fertilizing, the ashes. So I got typhus. I got sick on typhus. So there's a big part in\nSobibor what I don't remember, because I got typhus. And you was not allowed to be sick in\nSobibor. Everybody what was sick went straight to the gas chamber. I remember what I was\nsick and one day I stayed in, in the barrack. The barrack had no toilet. We were not \u2014 we had\n\u2014 there was a pail and that was our bathroom; and we slept in two rows, three rows, three.\n* roll call (German).\nThe floor and three rows, and we all with the lice a very short time, and there was \u2014once\nthere was another animal but also red and that was full and that little bit food what was\nsometimes had to put under the pillow and, and were the mice. I remember one day I put a\npillow up and it was all mice with little babies under my pillow with that what \u2014 and we were\nalready \u2014 I remember I was so upset from the first lice what I had that Chaim \u2014 I was on\nalready \u2014 Chaim fell right away in love with me, so that was a big help for me too; you\nknow, that, that the time in Sobibor was not so difficult 1f I would have been alone. But\nChaim was already six months longer in camp. Now Chaim was really a girlfriend with\nsomebody else, with Esther Raab \u2014 what was interviewed here \u2014 and I think she was jealous.\nChaim right away fell in love with me, so he was a big help for me and all the time in the\ncamp, because I don't think when I wouldn't have Chaim, I wouldn't have made it.\nUltimately, definitely not out of camp. But when I was sick Chaim took me to the bathroom\nand made me walk and, he brought me, I think, food. I don't remember much from the time\nwhen that I had typhus because I was very sick and you had to go to work. And because of\nChaim, and also because of the girlfriends what I had \u2014 I say they helped me through this\ntime because that I remember. Later on they told that I fell sometimes asleep and they hide\nme when we had to clean the woods, so they hide me some where that I was sleeping. And\nalso one day, Frenzel\u2019 came out. Frenzel was one of the worst SS's in camp; and he came to\nthe camp, Camp One, and he went, with the whip he went in the barrack in and everybody\nwas sick, had to go out and had to stay on the middle and I remember so vividly, was also a\nboy that I know from Assen, from another town, from the Zionist organization, and he was\nstanding there and, and they all was standing on a long time in the middle on the camp and\nthey all got shot, right away.\nWhen I \u2014 then he screamed and, and I came out and he recognized me; and I don't remember\nif it was Wagner\u2019\u201d or Frenzel \u2014 now one of the two \u2014 I mixed it up \u2014 he say to me, \"Go back\nto work!\" So I could go back to work. Just luck. Frenzel picked me out, too; and Frenzel\nsomehow always picked me out. When I had a very heavy work \u2014 I don't know why -\u2014 just\nluck. He picked me out and give me easier work. We had sometimes to go in the woods and\npicking mushrooms for the Germans, some of the girls. I remember I put everything, the\nmushrooms, I put them in my bra and in my underpants, and when we came home we\ncooked them in a little something what, what the Polish girls had; and then we had to go out\nand picking blueberries sometimes, but we were not allowed to eat them. So when we came\nback then we had to show our tongue if we had one. And we were very hungry in that time.\nWhen there came no transports, we were very hungry, because you couldn't save the food\nbecause the mice and the and the rats, they, they took away under your pillow. So we were\nvery hungry. Somehow Frenzel, when I had very heavy work \u2014 we has also to go in the\nwoods and cutting trees and bringing from one place to the other, or filling up these trolleys,\nwhat the people came in, with sand. And that we had to do on the \u2014 they were the Germans,\n\u201d Oberscharfiihrer Karl Frenzel\n'\u00b0 Oberscharfiihrer Gustav Wagner\nalso the, the Kapos' with the whip in back of us, and they \u2014 we had to put it somewhere.\nYou know, when there didn't came transport. So we were terrible. We are like animals\nalready, because we were happy when there came a transport; because we know when it\ncomes in a long time no transport, we go to the gas chamber. And when there come already\ntransport, when they coming, then we were happy that they came. When there came\ntransport from Holland, everything went very smoothly. And there came also transports from\nPoland, and when there came transports from Poland, was \u2014 we were locked up in our area\nand there was always shooting. There came also a transport from Belzec \u2014 my husband will\ntell that story from Belzec, that transport. I remember that we got locked up in our things and\nwe thought, \u201cthat's the end of us.\u201d There was shooting and there was screaming and there\nwas \u2014 it, 1t was very scary; and that was from Belzec. They didn't want to go to the gas\nchamber, so they shot them on the spot. And many times when transports came from, from\nPoles \u2014 Polish Jews, they didn't want to go to the gas chamber because they know they went\nthrough the gas \u2014 that they went. So they just shot them on the spot. So, it was also many\ntimes we had to stay on roll call the whole night because an animal walked on one of the\nmines; because Sobibor was with, mines three times or two times and sometimes an animal\nwalked on there \u2014 I don't know what kind of an animal \u2014 and then we had to stay the whole\nnight on roll call. And we always made so out that, Chaim and I, that we stayed together.\nYou know, he always made sure that we always \u2014 when also once what 1s that there was,\nsome Jews ran away. Two Jews ran away. They made it, too. And we had to go back and we\nstayed on roll call. And Chaim, Chaim had \u2014 the men had to stay separate and the women\nhad to stay separate. And we stayed in Lager One on roll call, and they cut, they picked out\nevery tenth person. So okay, imagine how what a nervous wreck I was \u2014 they picked out\nevery tenth person, so it could have been Chaim. Chaim was number nine.",
        "A: What?",
        "A: Okay.\nTECHNICAL CONVERSATION\n'' Forman (colloquial German); term used for inmates appointed by the SS to head a labor\nKommando of prisoners.\nTAPE #2\n[Technical conversation |",
        "A: Where did we stop?",
        "A: Oh. Yeah. And he was number one \u2014 nine. He was number nine, and, and they were all shot.\nI remember so vividly, there was one woman, and one man was number ten and his\ngirlfriend or his wife was there. And she say, \"When he goes, I go with him.\" So she went\nalso with him and they got shot. You hear, you hear the shooting. Shooting was \u2014 killing was\nnothing. You know, you live with the minute. You live with the second. I mean somebody\ndied or somebody could \u2014 I mean you lived in such a fear, every minute of the day, that you\ndon't know one day of the other, you know. And, and every time when I saw Chaim or if he\nsaw me, we were happy that we were still alive. We were always together. They called us\nbride and \"bruidegom '\u201d,\" because we were always together. We tried always be together. So\n\u2014and you know, I, I was like a tomboy. I was always the only girl from four, from four\nchildren; and I grew up and I was the youngest so I grew up with my four brothers. So I\nremember that Chaim always calmed me down. And he was always sure that, that nobody\nreally knows us, that we went and so, you know; he calmed me down. I stole a lot of food\nalways from the packages.\nAnd what was very, very dangerous. When they would caught us, they shoot me right away,\nstraight. And, and I remember, once the they, they killed some people in the woods. There\nwere \u2014 a group of men had to work in the woods and cutting trees; and they had a plan to run\naway. And when they were in the woods they, they killed some from the Ukrainians, what\nwere also what take care of them. And they, they were Polish Jews, not Dutch Jews. Dutch\nJews, they didn't think about running away. Because we know we didn't \u2014 where could we\nrun? We don't know Polish, and where could we run? So they didn't \u2014 but they were the\nPolish Jews, and they killed and they ran away. And some got alive out. But most of the\nDutch Jews, they shot a bunch and they caught them and they put them, they brought them\nback. And we had to stay on roll call, and we \u2014 I had a lot of food in my coat. I remember I\nput it in a coat. I don't how, how come that I had a coat \u2014 something over my arm. I\nremember. And one woman was crying when her husband \u2014 it was a Dutch woman \u2014 who\ngot killed and I know they wouldn't do anything to her. So I say, \"Will you take my coat?\"\nAnd she took my coat; because I know for sure they wouldn't do, they wouldn't look over her\n' bridegroom (Dutch)\nif she would have some food when she was crying. And they had sometimes, you know,\nsome feeling for the Dutch people. And they too \u2014 didn't take me to look over my clothes,\nbut they took some of the other people look if they had food with them. After that we had to\ngo on roll call on a big place, and we were standing. And again Chaim and I were standing\nnext to each other; and they took a bunch of people and we had to stand 10 or 20 people\u2014I\ndon't remember the amount\u2014and they had to stand farther up, and they will shoot them. They\nwere planned to shoot them. My system was always\u2014 and was perhaps because I do a lot\nnow when we see a movie where we don't want to see, we take it away right away \u2014 I never\nlooked, so they shoot these 10 people. We had to stay all on roll call together, the whole\ncamp; and we had to look what will happen to you when you do things like and they all\nshoot them. I didn't look. I saw them later that the Germans went again and shoot them\nagain, that I that I remember, but I didn't see them falling. I remember one person seeing\nfalling of that, that what I think I saw; but I remember that they went back and they all shot\nthem again. And there were all because they want to show us what will happen to us if we\nwill do a thing like that. Also I remember vividly that one boy opened a can of sardines, and\nthey, they almost killed him. His, his arm was almost \u2014 he was almost dead. They put him on\na piece of wood, and we had to also trade \u2014 and the whole\u2014 everybody what worked in the\nbarracks had to go on a roll call and we had to watch this boy, and that was Wagner said,\n\"That will happen to you. When you open a can of sardines, or you eat anything from the\nthings what coming on. That will happen to you!\" So, I remember this boy laying there and\nwe know this boy. You know, some of the things stays in your mind what, what happened to\npeople. I remember also once a man was standing and he did something wrong, and Wagner\ntook a shovel and cut his head in two pieces. You know, and I see him also standing there,\nthis man, and then he dropped dead. Once was a Kappa. He was laying in bed\u2014 a young boy\nfrom 15, 16 years old, and he was a very nice kid and\u2014 Pim was his name, I think, Pim, and\nFrenzel \u2014 Wagner came in and say, \"Out! Up! Up! You have to go up! You have to go on\u2014\nthere comes a transport. You have to go out and work!\" And he put with his whip, like that\u2014\nout, as a joke. He, he was asleep, and Wagner took him out and shot him. You know, your\nlife was, was nothing. You know, that I think what I remember, I remember that when we go\nfrom work and we had to go home, we had to sing, and we had to go down and up. There\nwas a punishment.\nYou had lay down, \"hinlegen und aufstehen'*\" it was in German. You had to lay down and\nyou had to go up, and you had to lay down on the order from the Germans. All punishment.\nWe had to sing very nice. Many times we had to sing on the inside of the hall where were\nslept. We had to walk around, in \u2014 10 people together\u2014 like in the Sing Sing when they \u2014 and\nit was \u2014 I think I saw movies from the Sing Sing, as a child, and I remember always like a\nSing Sing. And it was beautiful singing. When there were already Russian Jews came, the\nRussian transport came already and also the Polish Jews; and we had to walk around and\nsing, Russian and Polish songs, and German songs. I was six months in, in camp. When I\n8 Lay down and get up! (German)\nlook back, it I can't remember that it was six months; because I was a long time sick so there\nwas a big part what I don't remember.",
        "A: I don't remember. I really don't remember. But I was sick. a week, six weeks. Chaim always\ncovered up for me, a lot of times. And also my girls, the girls \u2014 the\u2014Ula, Ursula Stern\u2014what I\ndid from the beginning for them when they was sick, or we could help each other. You have\nto have somebody what covers up for you in a camp, if not you couldn't live. You lived \u2014 I\nslept together with Mimie Katz \u2014 she came from Holland, Haarlem \u2014 and Ula, where I slept\nin the middle. So when something, we, we could help each other, that's what we did, so, after\nthe \u2014 I don't \u2014 I, I remember that the camp got bigger and bigger. More people from, Minsk,\nfrom the Minsk \u2014 was a ghetto in Minsk. And people from Minsk came over, and we made\nbig barracks, the building \u2014 big barracks in Sobibor and we all were very scared because\nthere came no transports. They didn't come transports, and so we didn't know what was\ngoing on. And then, when the Minsk transport came these guy from Ger\u2014 from Russia, Sash,\nSasha, Sash \u2014 he just died not long ago. he came with a group of Russian Jews. And I didn't\ntalk with these, all these people, because, we Dutch people were, were like \u2014 they think did\nthe Dutch \u2014 the Polish Jews hold together tremendous, and some of the young girls, had\nfriends with the, with the Polish Jews. So, Katty Gokkes, she was also a Dutch girl, and she\nhad \u2014 with one of the Kapos she was friendly. She was very beautiful. The German, the\nPolish Jews thought she was very beautiful. And she had friendship with one of the Polish\nJews and so that's the reason, she knows everything; and she could tell Ula. But so, when\nyou didn't have a Polish friend \u2014 the, the Polish stick tremendous together. They spoke\nYiddish. We didn't speak Yiddish. In Holland, they didn't spoke Yiddish; so we spoke\nGerman but not Yiddish, so, we were goyim, we were not Jews. In the eyes from, from the,\nfrom the Polish Jews, we were not Jews. We were Jews, of course. We were at Sobibor. But\nwe were not, we were \u2014 they they didn't understand that we didn't speak Yiddish, and they\nstick tremendous together, so when the whole thing from the uprising, we didn't know\nanything about it. The Dutch Jews didn't know anything about it. Ula was lucky that she\nknows this other girl that was also a survivor. It was lucky because of Katty Gokkes that she\nknows. Katty knows about that, she had a relationship with one of the Kapos. I don't\nremember his name. So, when there was already something going on and then they built very\nbig barracks; so we went also, came in the big barracks. And I remember \u2014 I don't remember\nmuch about it. I don't remember much about it that I came to the big barrack; but I remember\nwhat it was a little bit better, what it was in that big barrack. There was a very big and much\nnicer, and I remember there was another girl \u2014 Viool was her name-that she came to Sobibor\nwith her father and two sisters and they could sing very beautiful, and they were and they\nwere always singing. And so she got also typhus and she was very sick and she had also a, a\nboyfriend and he left her there. He didn't take her \u2014 he ran away by himself. And there was\nanother Dutch man \u2014 not a \u2014 from Czechoslovakia, he's alive \u2014 Kurt Thomas, and he was\nfriendly with Katty Gokkes. That was his girlfriend; and when they run away and they were\nin the woods, he say, \"Where's Katty?,\" he says. \"I have no idea where Katie is. You should\nknow. You should have taken her with you like Chaim did.\" So Katty Gokkes also died. I, I,\nI'm \u2014 almost everybody died. But anyway, I didn't know anything what was going on from\nthe uprising. So one day \u2014 it was, it was very dangerous also. It was like a war. Like 1n, in\nlike there is a war, just a few people know about it; so nobody \u2014 there was just a very small\ngroup know about the uprising in Sobibor.\nAnd one day Chaim tells me, \"Try to get some clothes. I tried to get some boots; and dress\nyourself up.\" I was already a little bit better. It was \u2014 I, I was already much better, and so I \u2014\nthere is a barrack \u2014 all the boots, all the clothes went to different barracks, different tents, big\ntents. The boots were together. The clothes were together. Oh, yeah \u2014 one thi\u2014 one day \u2014\nalso, my mother knitted a lot and all my clothes was always knitted. Especially when I go to\nPoland, my mother put sure that in the backpack was all warm clothes. And Ula, Ula Stern,\nwas a big person and I was a big person. One day she couldn't find any clothes, so she went\nto the barrack and she \u2014 coincident, she took one of the dresses what my mother knitted. And\nshe came to, came to the barrack; and I remember that she had my dress on. I was very upset\nof course, it was my mother's dr\u2014 made that, so.... But, so 1t was all barracks that were over,\nthat were sent, that were sent to Poland; where they make bundles out of it. There were other\npeople again what worked there. Other people what worked and organized everything to\nseparate. And it went in the trains what went back; what when the Jews came, the trains went\nback with all clothes what went back to Germany. And that went also, before the people\nwent to the gas chamber, the men had to go and cut their hair; and that also went back to\nGermany. Everything, also the gold; and, we had to separate gold, and many times when we\nhad to assort the clothes we found diamonds and gold in it, and I remember once I found a\nwhole handful of diamonds and the German saw it and he took it. The Germans when they\nwent on vacation to Germany, they took the backpack full with ger\u2014 with gold and with\nsilver and with, with everything what, what they could grab; what was, what the Germans\nreally want for the army. You know? So, when you, when you found that you have to give it\nup. I had to assort the clothes. And I was not so clever, really, that I thought about that the\nGerman and they take the gold; but a lot of people took it and hide it. I, I always cut out all\nthe clothes what I had assorted. I, I cut it in pieces, when I saw that's the only sabotage what\nI can do. You know, to cut the clothes. And Chaim, and when I found something what\nnobody could see, I give it to Chaim. The fireman what had to burn all the pictures and all\nthe documents what were burned in Sobibor \u2014 Chaim, that was Chaim's best friend. Szmuel\nwas his name. And so Chaim many times put money under it, in the bottom and that went to\nhim and he hide that in the ground. That was hidden in the ground, so I when we run away,\nChaim makes sure that he got some of the money. So, so we, we\u2014 I didn't know anything,\nwhat was the uprising or anything what was, going\u2014 absolutely had no idea. So when Chaim\ntold me try to get some warm clothes; then he told me, 'Take some warm clothes,\" and he\ntold me that what the plan is to do. Then he told I was not allowed to tell it to anybody,\nabsolutely\u2014 and that's my always and guilt feeling. I had a cousin there, and I didn't tell her;\nand the same day she say, \"I will make some food,\" when she work in the where the laundry\nfor the Germans and she had a chance to cook something. And I didn't tell her, and she didn't\ncome out. And I always feel guilty that I didn't do it. So, I went to a barrack, and there was\none German that was sometimes good. He didn't get also not much punishment, and he give\nme a pair of boots. And I had a lot of clothes on, what was very dumb, because when the\nGerman would have seen me with so much clothes on, he would have asked, \"Why do you\nhave so much clothes on?\" So Chaim told me, \"On four o'clock be by a big place.\" That is\u2014\nand also the, the medicine, all the medicine the Dutch people brought a lot of medicine and\nthat went also in one big place where, where they put the, the medicine, so the medicine was\nin that big place. And there he say, \"Come there at four o'clock.\" So I make sure that I\nwalked there at four o'clock. Everybody was working. Everything \u2014 nobody knows anything.\nEverything \u2014 just a very small group of people what were involved in this in this uprising. So\neverything went through normal. I went walked \u2014 I don't know how, how I came to that, was\nallowed to walk there. Anyway, I walked there. I remember also in camp, once before the\nuprising, that I walked somewhere and I heard that the Germans spoke to the whole group of\ntransport people; and I saw the rabbi and the cantor from my home town, sitting there. And I,\nyou know, I just \u2014 I was planned just to run to them or \u2014 but I couldn't have done anything.\nAlso, many times I saw people from my home town walking. There was a little window, and\nI saw people from my home town passing this window; and I was afraid that they would see\nme, you know, I made almost sure. Whole families I saw walking to the gas chamber, many,\nmany times. And, and I couldn't say anything when even \u2014 was no way, nothing that I could\ndo. Nothing that I could do. So I walked to Chaim, and on four o'clock, and I come there. I\nremember I walked in there, and one of the Kapos \u2014 Wieszubski was his name, yeah. He\nkilled already a few Germans, and he was very nervous. And I say, \"Take a pill for it,\nsomething for your nerves to calm down;\" and he took it, and I remember and it was bitter\nand he spit it out. Says he, \"I don't need it.\" So I met Chaim on the end, and there came \u2014\nthere wasn't \u2014 Chaim was not involved in the uprising, but somehow he say to me, \u201ccome\nthere\u201d and from there we will always go somehow in the area for roll call. So he want to be\nsure that we are together when there is a roll call. And there was a boy standing there and he\nwas involved, he was in the uprising involved, and he had to kill one German. Together with\nthe Kapo, with Wieszubski, and he say \u2014 I was standing together with him and Chaim \u2014 he\nsay, \"I'm afraid to go.\" Said Chaim, \"You have to go.\" And said he, \"I'm afraid.\" Said Chaim\n\u2014 \u201cthere's no way back.\u201d What we know already there was one young boy what had a chance\nto go walk around in camp and he knows already there were ten dead. So there was \u2014 we\nknow already now, you know, there was \u2014 we know it is our death. When we, when we get\ncaught now, that's the end. So the, the electricity was already cut off and the telephone was\nalready cut off; so there was already, you know, was already not a connection anymore. So\nChaim had no choice. He run inside and took a knife, put it in his boots; and he walked to\nthis, office where Beckman\", was his name, was and in between the Kapo was already there.\nAnd he had no choice, Chaim. And he \u2014 I remember that he was gone. I was inside to take\n'* Scharfiihrer Kurt Beckman\nthe knife or something like that, and I didn't see him going away to the barrack; and I went\nlooking for him. I said, \"Where's Chaim? Where's Chaim?\" Oh, I got so panicky, when I\nknow already there was an uprising and there was something going on there, and I couldn't\nfind Chaim. And then one of the boys, he say that, \u201cI say Chaim is in that barrack.\u201d And I\nwent looking where Chaim was and I hear screaming, like somebody killed a pork. Was\nscreaming, this man \u2014 the SS man was screaming, of course; and they were killing him with\nknives. When it was \u2014 we couldn't, we couldn't use guns or anything because nobody was\nallowed to hear, hear that we were \u2014 that they were killing Germans because they were all\nover, the Ukraines were standing there and the, and the Poles were all around. So I went\nback to the spot; and I went, went there for the roll call because it was very dangerous. I\nknow when I was standing there when just one German would walk around and if an\nUkraine would see me there \u2014 I know that I went back to the, to that barrack and was the roll\ncall.\nI went in the roll call, and then we walked back to the \u2014 then there was the roll call, and it\nwas already a little bit unorganized. It was, that was already, you know, with the, the main \u2014\nyou could see already it was unorganized; and then we started walking. And finally Chaim\ncomes out, and he, he was bleeding. When he, when that knife slipped out of the head from\nthis German and he got a cut in his arm. And he was all over blood; and I remember I\nthought, \"God forbid we come somewhere and he sees this blood.\" And you know, I had no\nidea what will happen and what will happen now. I had no idea. We're running away or just\nwas very \u2014I, you know \u2014 so, I cleaned him up from this blood a little bit. So in the time that\nwe were walking, and I think I had a handkerchief and I put a handkerchief on his arm. And\nit was bleeding and, and we were walking to Camp One, that we go home. In, in between\nmore people came off, on all side people came; and, you see, I remember there were came a\nUkrainian on a bicycle and they just killed him like nothing. Somebody had taken an axe or\nsomething, a knife or a who knows, and everybody start coming there together, what I\nremember; and then everybody say, \"Hurrah!\" or something. And then we started running,\nand we were lucky we were running to the entrance where the Sobibor comes in. And I\nremember that then Frenzel starts shooting. I hear guns starting already; the, the Germans\nknows what was going on. Because in between that we started walking and I cleaned Chaim\nup, a truck came. And it was one of the Germans was on this truck; and the Kapo what\nChaim killed the back of it, he killed already a few other ones and he went on this truck. He\njumped on this truck and tried \u2014 and then I don't know what's happened, but he never came\nout so I think he got killed on this truck. That was an family \u2014 an older man. He had three\nsons. He had three brothers and the father was there. I have to tell you later that I've met the\nfather in Israel. There was there three boys, all the three boys were Kapos, and nobody came\nout. Nobody came out of this, out of the camp. So when we start running, Frenzel was\nalready shooting and he had something tn front of him. I saw it. And every \u2014 it was a little\nhouse and everybody stopped for that little house. So Chaim took my hand and, and he say,\n\"Come,\" when it is no use that we stay there. And then everybody start running, and people\nstart \u2014 and then we walked to this door, to this gate and everybody was falling around next to\nus. Everybody \u2014 you hear mines going and people dropping dead, you know, on the mines,\nand you only you didn't see much. You just run. You just run. I remember I had a necklace\nfull with Jewish emblems; and, and I thought, \"Oh, when I come in a non-Jewish area I\nbetter take that off.\" So I \u2014 that was the first thing what I took off and throw away. And then\nI had to run and run and all the clothes slowly on. I took all the clothes off and I just had on\nwhat normally had on, because I couldn't run with all those clothes on. So I was running and\nrunning; and when I run I remember, when I'm very nervous, I get diarrhea and I had to stop\nall the time. And I was very nervous, of course, when you had to run; and then we heard\nshooting already in back of us, and we heard, screaming. And we're running and running and\nrunning till we came \u2014 and that was dark. Went to four o'clock, five o'clock, started be dark\nalready. We're running and we're running, we're running and there come away a whole\nbunch of Jews. We stayed there together. People from Sobibor. And I saw also Kurt Thomas,\nand he asked me, \"Where's Ula?\" No. Where is his girlfriend, Millie.\u2019\u201d And I told him, \"I\ndon't know. You have to take her.\" I say, \"Yeah, I had to run.\" So he \u2014 Chaim was the only\none what took his girlfriend, what took, took his Dutch girl. He was the only one from all the\nPolish Jews. See how lucky I was. And we run and there we come together with a bunch of\nthese Polish Jews. And Chaim say to them, \"Can we stay together?\" And one had a gun, a\nlarge gun; and he wants to shoot Chaim because he was afraid for me because I don't speak\nPolish. And, and right away they're, you know, they're afraid. So I jumped in front of Chaim,\nand he didn't shoot Chaim. And we went away, the two of us. We left all of them, and we\nwent away, the two of us. We had \u2014 Chaim had some money, some gold pieces and some\ndiamonds and we thought it was a lot of money. I have no idea how much it was. We both\ndon't remember. He had in \u2014 where you put the glasses in \u2014 a case, he had filled with\ndiamonds and gold and you know. And so we came; and he thought that and that was what\nwe thought we can save our lives with. Was his brains, not mine. I wouldn't even think about\nmoney. So we went to a farmer in a little village, and we asked if we can stay for the night.\nAnd he say, \"Yes.\" Chaim give him a gold piece, a gold dollar. I don't know how much it\nwas. And we stayed in the attic for the night.",
        "A: We just saw somebody with a light on, and we walked in. We had a lot, that was just luck.\nWe \u2014 just the lucky stuff. So I thought we didn't find them. It was just a little house and in\nthe same village, the same day, we stay at night. We hide at night. In the same day, the\nGermans came and they went a lot of houses and they killed all the Jews. All the Jews what,\nwhat they could find, they killed all over; and they skipped this house where we were in, I\nthink. But the same village that they went in houses in, so when it was started to be dark \u2014 I\nremember there was no bathroom, of course, and I had to go to the bathroom.\nWe were hidden down in the attic, and I'm still ashamed of what it was, it was terrible, 1t was\n'\u00b0 Also referred to as Mimie Katz.\nterrible. Anyway, I walked in water and my shoe got too small, my boots got too small, so I\ntook off my boots. I couldn't get 1t on anymore. So I had to walk all the two weeks on the\nside of my boots. Chaim had to cut it open with a knife, and I had to walk on the side of my\nboots; on one, on one boot when I couldn't get 1t on anymore. So we walked and we were\nwet and it was raining and we walked at night and I was very scared, and we walked through\nthe woods. And every tree I looked \u201cFrenzel.\u201d Frenzel wore always in, in cape, you know.\nAnd it, and sometimes the tree looks like that. I remember Chaim say once to me, \"Now you\nhave to stop saying things like that. You make me scared too.\" And once we went through a\nwoods, and there was a body where we went through woods \u2014 very big where we walked for\ndays. It \u2014 and there was a body laying there. We had to \u2014 you know \u2014 and it was very scary,\nyou know. I came from a little town, and you know you come from after Sobibor but still it\nwas just \u2014 it was very scary. We walked at night. When it's turned daytime we tried to hide.\nWe tried to hide in houses, but most of the time they didn't want to take us. Sometimes they\ntook us for money but most of the time not.\nWe slept in the woods, and we and when we walked near to an other town. We walked on\nthe stars, on the stars; on the Wagen\u2019\u201d\u00ae, I think, on the Wagen. That was Chaim's part. We\nwalked on the Wagen. So that's \u2014 Chaim want to go to the farmer where he worked before\nthe war. Now in the war, he worked by a farmer; and he thought he goes to the farmer where\nhe worked and perhaps this man will hide us. So we walked on the stars and we walked two\nweeks. One night we, we, we couldn't find somebody, and we were hidden in a hayloft, in a\nhayloft. And we were hidden there; and little kids were, were playing outside and they go,\nthey climbing all on there and we were hiding under this, this hay. Well, how much can a kid\nhave come up you? And they saw us and they run off saying, \"Jews!\"; when everybody\nknows of course of the uprising so we jumped out of there. And we started walking in\ndaytime and there came two farmers with a wagon and they say to us, \"Would you like to go\nwith us?\" And Chaim say, \u201cyes,\u201d that we go with them. So Chaim went in one car and I went\nin the other. There were two men what belonged together; and Chaim understand Polish, but\nthe people didn't think perhaps we had understood them. But they were planning to kill us\nand take our money and Chaim say, \"Selma, jump!\" And I jumped and he jumped, so then\nwe walked farther. Was very dangerous, very dangerous. I remember once I was very thirsty,\nand it was a very beautiful farm. And I asked the woman if I could have some water, and she\nsay, \"No, Jew!\" And she, you know, was sitting there. It was very nice. She was very nice\ndressed, and with a little baby, and next to her; and it was, you know, it was very \u2014 it 1s\ncomparing with the Polish Jews went through, is it nothing but it was very \u2014 you were a\nnothing, you know. We walked many times, and there came a dog in back of us, and you\nwere scared for everything and sometimes you saw an, an animal with eyes. You so used to\neyes and you was laying there in the woods, it, 1t was a very scary time. We didn't have to\neat. We walked two weeks. We ate the, the carrots what we saw in the fields and, and we\n'\u00b0 wagon (German); \u201cDer Groke Wagen\u2019 or \u201cThe Big Wagon\u201d is a colloquial German term for\nthe constellation Ursula Major.\nwere wet. And you couldn't wash yourself, and we were on the lice and we were dirty and I\nhad, scabies and, and skin disease, what is a very \u2014 I had it worse than Chaim. He never that\nproblem. That came always to me. And you were very dirty. It was \u2014 so we walked two\nweeks long and we couldn't find anything. One night we came to a farmer and Chaim asked\nhim if he could hide us, and the farmer say \u2014 and we sleep, slept in the hay \u2014 he say, \"I\ncannot do it. Where I sleep are too many people around, but my brother lives very separate\nsomewhere. Perhaps he can do it.\" What was wonderful, this man had a wagon and he put\nChaim on the wagon and put bushes on top of it so nobody could see it, and he dressed me\nlike a Polish woman with a handkerchief and clothes from his wife on. And he brought us to\nhis brother, what was very dangerous. When they would have caught him, they would have\nkilled his family. They would burn down his whole farm and it was a very dangerous thing\nto do. Very \u2014 we, we give this man perhaps of course some money, but not much. I don't\nknow, I have no idea, but we give him some money. He brought us to his brother. But his\nbrother \u2014 we came to his brother, Adam Nowak and his wife.\nAnd they \u2014 we in the evening we were allowed to wash ourselves. Now Chaim had this\nmoney hidden in a bandage on his leg and so when he was washing himself I think the\nfarmer saw there was a lot of money, that's what I think. I, I definitely \u2014 he did it for the\nmoney. He was too dumb to do it for something else, and we say to him, \"We give you all\nthe money what we have. We give you everything we have. Can we stay here?\" So we give\nhim all the money what we have. I have no idea how much it was. And he hide us over the\nwar. We stayed there nine months. What was \u2014 what I told you before, was very dangerous.\nWe stayed in an attic. And we slept on hay with beams and it was a roof also from hay, with\nstraw, and it was little holes in. We couldn't \u2014 we're not allowed to talk and we're not allowed\nto walk. The only thing what we could do was looking through this little hole where what we\ncould see. And in the summer it was so hot that you couldn't \u2014 the mosquitoes and the flies \u2014\nyou can imagine the, the cows were under us. They came on top of us so we laid nude to\nsave the little bit clothes what we had because we \u2014 I had these scabies and it was very, very\ncontagious. And the woman put our clothes in, in an oven, so everything got really burned\nwhat, what \u2014 so we didn't have much clothes. That little bit what we had we saved so, we, we\ndidn't wore it so much; and there was, there were full with flies so that so we didn't do\nanything then shaking the fly, and in the winter it was very, very cold. They gave us a, a\nblanket. We had a blanket, to put over. We got very little food when it was just \u2014 they were\nallowed it to bring us only once a day food, so they brought us a little bit bread, and we put it\nsometimes between our head and, at night the rats came to take it away. We, we were full\nwith lice. I had this, abscess under my arm and Chaim too in his neck from lice. Once in a\nwhile we could, wash ourself, but when she saw that we had so scabie and she was afraid, to\nbring us back.\nShe was, she was afraid that also that one day that we didn't give her all the money; so, we\nhad to go out of the place where we slept at night. Sometimes also she let us in the living\nroom and that we washed like I told you. So that was later on not anymore because we didn't\nwalk so we could, I couldn't hardly walk anymore. I was very under-nourished. And we had\nto sleep with the pigs a few nights, what they smelled terrible and it was \u2014 I was \u2014 that was\nhorrible. I remember, I remember there was a cuckoo flying over us, and Chaim say, \"Selma,\nbe quiet. That brings us luck.\" He was such a good guy. He always helped me up. I was very\ndepressed and very upset about this time. I didn't know that I was pregnant. I was \u2014 I didn't\nget heavier because I was laying. We were not allowed to walk, and I was, I didn't have my\nperiod all these months; not, also not in camp, not at all, and I was, when I came to camp,\nvery heavy from all the water retains in your body. And I didn't know I was, pregnant, and\nwe both didn't know and, so we and so had liberty for. So I was very, very upset and very\ndepressed, and I had a little diary and, Chaim say, \"Write in your diary.\" And that helped me.\nThat helped me a lot. I had a little pencil. You cannot read it any, almost not anymore,\nbecause it was just written with a pencil. And, we had a pail in the middle from us, and that\nwas our bathroom and once a week they cleaned it and I remember when we had, some kind\nof a kale. It was such a smell that, you could almost not inhale. you could almost not live,\nsuch a smell was there from the pail, and there was no cover on. till now we eat not that kind\nof a kale. so when were out, they put us back in the same place. We were hidden there. And\nthe rats run around us. We didn't have anything to do. I\u2014 and from the beginning I was\nknitting. She made her own linen on the spinning wheel; and I was knitting for her. But the\nkid \u2014 it was a little boy \u2014 wore that clothes. And the neighbors say, \"How you got that nice\nclothes from?\" So I couldn't knit anymore either, because, the neighbors were, were\nsuspicious. There was, storks there settled on the farm, and we could see them. So we didn't\nhave anything to do and we were watching these storks. So one, one day the storks went\naway, so the farmer comes to us and say, \"You have to go. Could not one of you, have you\nany more \u2014 you have to go.\" And we say, \"Why?\" Because when storks go away that, that\nbrings, then there is something going on, there's a supersti\u2014 superstition and he say, \"Do you\nwatch the storks?\" And we say, \"Yes.\" \"Have you stopped watching the storks?\" Thank God\nthe storks came back! Also when she find out that I were pregnant, she want to send us\naway; and we say, \u201cNo, I'm not pregnant. I'm just...,\u201d and we didn't know either. \"It's not\ntrue,\" and you know; we talked her into it, so she let us stay. But she was still planning to\nsend us away. Also, we one day we hear some maybe shooting and we asked her why they're\nshooting, and he say, \"They're shooting a, a Jew. They shot a Jew because he had such nice\nboots on, and the people want to have his boots so they shot the Jew.\" Also Chaim's best\nfriend, what was the fireman in Sobibor, he went to a farmer and he say, \"I have a lot of\nmoney with me. Will you hide me?\" And the farmer say, \"Yes.\" And at night he came with a\nhayfork and killed him. So we were very lucky. Very lucky. So in July 1944, we heard the\nwar coming near to us, the Bug. We hear, the, the Germans going back. We heard the war\nand you hear them coming. You hear them coming already. So one day a little boy from the\nneighbor's saw a bird going up where we are, and he was running after this bird, and he saw\nus. By luck the Germans were already fly \u2014 running away. You could see it, the Germans\nrunning away, from that little hole what we had and it was very open field all around; and the\nlittle boy\u2014 so they let us stay. So, where was I?",
        "A: Oh, that little boy came over, so then we hear the war coming nearer. We hear the war\ncoming nearer, and so we were lucky that this boy came just in the right time. The \u2014 one day\nAdam came to us and say, \"I think the war is over.\" And the airplanes coming over already,\nthen you couldn't hear, so we went out. I remember Chaim went out by himself. I think, \"Oh,\nGod, he doesn't come back!\" But he came back. And then I went out and I was in the sixth\nmonths pregnant. We had to hide in the in the fields, in the fields because the airplanes came\nover and it was war going on, and that took a day\u2014 I don't know how long it took. It was a\nvery short time. After that we stayed a few days, but we were very under-nourished and we\nstayed a few days and we were sitting 1n the field and Chaim helped the farmer a little bit in\nthe field with the hay. And then he heard \u2014 they were talking in the village that they want to\nkill us, the Jews. They want to kill us. So the farmer took us and brought us to Chelm, and\nwhen we came to Chelm, we thought we were the only Jews left. And we came to Chelm.\nWe found some more Jews. Because we thought every concentration camp was like Sobibor.\nSo we thought, you know, there were no Jews left. So we came to Chelm, and there came all\nthe Jews what were left. Was one house where one Jewish family, and, and we went to that \u2014\nwhere there were more Jews and we went and we stayed in there. We had no clothes. We\nhad no money, absolutely no money. And there were about hundred Jews in that room. We,\nwe, had no, nothing, absolutely nothing, just what we had on. And we came and I was\npregnant. That was what my husband never liked to hear \u2014 he doesn't want to talk about it.\nHe thinks that's terrible. We, we, we didn't have anything, so I started sewing, even for\nEsther Raab. I started sewing by hand, and we, we had nothing, no clothes to put, no\nblankets to put over us at night and we slept up the ground. There was one small bed; and\nbecause I was pregnant, they give us that bed, I remember. And so Chaim had to go in the\narmy. He had to go in the army and I didn't speak a word Polish. I didn't speak almost no\nYiddish. And I spoke German, but the Jews what, what they couldn't understand me; not\nsome, most of them not. And we had no money, and he had to go in the army. He had to go\nfight for \u2014 with the Polish army, so, so he \u2014 some \u2014 we spoke with somebody, and he could\nstart working in a hospital as nurse and they thought, we thought that he doesn't have to go in\nthe army this way. So he worked as nurse. Chaim cannot see blood and there came once \u2014 I\nremember was a train and all people died almost, and he had to help and all these sick people\ncutting off the legs; and they're very primitive there still in that time. I don't know how, now.\nAnd so \u2014 maar\u2019\u2019, after a while he made \u2014 I don't know if he made money but we know \u2014\nyeah, he had to make some money. Of course, we had to eat; and I start cooking for all these\npeople. I remember I start cooking and I didn't know how to cook Polish. When I was Dutch\nand in Holland they, they cook like in America a little bit, not, not like Poland, Pole. And I\nburned myself and I burnt my leg. It was very deep wounds and there was no doctor. And,\nach, it was a mess. And, and I started sewing, so after a while we heard that Chaim had to go\nin the army anyway and also Chaim start selling gasoline. I don't know, he started doing\nsomething. I don't remember exactly what he did but he made a little bit money and also he\ngot to know some people and the people went back to Sobibor. When they hide, so many\n'\u201d but (Dutch)\nJews hide money in the ground in Sobibor, and they went back to Sobibor to get the money.\nThey started killing each other there in Sobibor because they start fighting. That, what I, I\nsaw \u2014 \"That's my money,\" and \"That's your money.\" So I said to Chaim, \"You don't go back\nto Sobibor. We brought it this far, and we will make it without this money.\" So he didn't go\nback. So somebody came and had some money and the money was rotten and the money \u2014\nbecause it was moisture in the ground and the number from these dollars was gone. So said\nChaim to him, \"You know, I know somebody.\" Chaim got to know some people. My\nhusband 1s very honest. \"I can perhaps change that money for you.\" It was a hundred dollar\nbill. We put that hundred dollar bill under our pillow at night, under our clothes. We had not\na pillow. Under his head, and somebody stole it at night away from him, and we had no idea\nwho \u2014 just everybody knows there from each other. There's just a few Jews what was left\nthere. So the man say, \"You have to give me that money.\" So if Chaim made a little bit\nmoney he paid him off. Right away, you know, he paid him a little bit money. I have to tell\nyou a story what was 20 years later. We lived in Israel. Twenty years later we lived 1n Israel.\nI come back to the other 20 years later we lived in Israel and all the Jews from Sobibor came\ntogether. And we had to go there too. And I see this man what I, what wanted the hundred\ndollar bill from us, and I say, \"Do you remember the hundred dollar bill?\" I opened my big\nmouth. \"That he stole it under our head, and it was your hundred dollar bill.\" He said, \"Yes, I\nremember.\" The next day he came to us in Beth Yitzhak, where we lived in Israel. He said,\n\"He owe me hundred dollars.\" We give it to him. What Chaim say that, \u201cThis man comes to\nus and makes himself that low, he needs the hundred dollars.\u201d So anyway we lived \u2014 we\nwent away from there and there came somebody what he also was a survivor from Sobibor,\nand we told him the story. We don't know what to do. Chaim had to go in the army and I'm \u2014\n\u201cWhat will I do?\u201d And he say, \"You know what you do? You go to this village where I live,\nand I give you \u2014 and you change your name, and grow a mustache and make yourself five\nyears older and you don't have to go in the army anymore.\" So that's what we did. So we\ndrove from one village, in between we, we, we went already from Chelm, and we met this\nman somewhere on the way and we drove in freight wagons and we were hitch hiking and\nwe were sitting in the freight wagons and we went from one place to the other and I couldn't\nwalk and it was just \u2014 and we slept on the floors and we were very \u2014 we didn't have anything\nand we were \u2014 it was 1n a horrible time. Anyway, we went from one place to the other; and\nfinally we met this guy and he said, \"You come to that in that village,\" and we went to that\nvillage. It was Parczew. Very small village. And we came in there and there was a Jewish\nwoman, she had a little grocery store and she say to us, \"I have a little apartment. You can\nlive there. A real apartment, a Polish apartment.\" And we went in there and there was no, no\n\u2014 was no water and there was no bathroom and we stayed in that apartment and \u2014 yeah \u2014 we\nstayed in that apartment. And Ula \u2014 Chaim had to go away and make some money, so Chaim\nwent where the Germans pulled away. He bought some stuff \u2014 I don't know \u2014 what he could\nsell by us. I don't know what he bought. Shoe, shoe laces, and shoe cream and little bit\nmoney what we had, perhaps ten dollars, fifty. And that he bought up, and it was far away;\nand then he brought it back where we lived, and he could sell it at a profit. From that profit\nwe lived. We had nothing. And I was all alone in Parczew, and I was pregnant. In between it\nI got the baby, I think \u2014 yeah \u2014 I got the baby. And was terrible, and I had to go a\u2014 I didn't\nknow how you got a baby, and he didn't know how you got a baby, and we didn't know why\nthe pain started and I don't.... Anyway, we had to walk five miles or two miles or three miles\nto the school where I got the baby; and they were all antisemites there. And laying there and\nI didn't know and it was \u2014 I was six months, six months laying flat so it was very difficult\nbirth and it was a first child. So I was laying there five days and five nights in labor-that I\nremember exactly\u2014in labor; and Chaim was not allowed to come because he wasn't, he had \u2014\nI don't know \u2014 was \u2014 I don't remember. Anyway, we had a little boy and we went back to the\n\u2014he picked me up with the wagon \u2014 that's a big story \u2014 any way he picked me up with the\nwagon. You want to know? This is terrible. You know, first of all, they, they came \u2014 the\ndoctor came to me and said to me, \"If you don't stop screaming, we'll throw you out on the\nstreet.\" Because they don't give me anything. They didn't give you anything for the pain; and\nthey didn't give me anything and it was the first baby and it, it was horrible. And I didn't\nknow what to do, and, and how to handle this pain; and finally after five days, one of the\npeople what was laying Polish not-Jewish people was laying around. They say, \"You had the\nshowing, so perhaps it's time.\" And so they came, and I had to walk to a room; and 1n two\nminutes the baby was there, of course, after five days laying there. And then have to walk\nback to the other room, and I was laying 1n bed and they didn't want to touch me, the doctors,\nbecause I was full with these scabies and I had lice. No. I didn't have lice. I had also scabie. I\nhad not also the scabie \u2014 a little bit of scabie, but it was almost gone. It was almost gone, but\nthey didn't want to touch me because I was Jewish. Well, not-Jewish doctors, and they\nlooked under the bed. When they saw no blood under it, they say, \"Oh, everything was\nokay.\" So I say to Chaim, \"I have to get away from here. I don't want to stay here a minute\nlonger.\" So he came with a wagon and he picked me up and he brought us to that apartment,\nthe baby and me. I didn't, I didn't have anything for this baby. In between from my own little\nbit what I had, I made some \u2014 sewed by hand some clothes for this baby. You know, when I\nwas a teenager I didn't see many babies, so I really didn't know what babies was wearing. So\nfrom my imagination I made \u2014 I was very handy always with doing things by hand, so I\nmade \u2014 sewed clothes from Chaim's little bit what he had; and from my little bit what I\nclothes on, I sewed clothes for the baby, so that little bit we had and I think we got from\npeople a bed where we could put a baby in. Now Chaim timmered'\u00ae a bed we made from \u2014\nmade himself a bed what we stole wood from old houses in the village; and he also made a\nbed where we could sleep on in that village. But we still had our own clothes what was our\nblanket, and it was cold already. It was October the baby born. No, the baby was born in\nOctober \u2014 yeah \u2014 the baby was born in October. And the apartment, the windows, there was\n\u2014 the windows, it was openings there as big as your hand. In the morning when you woke up,\nit's ice. Everything was ice in the, you know, the, the \u2014 from your breathing, everything was\nice. And so we couldn't let the baby sleep by themself. It would freeze to death right away.\nSo finally the other Jews what lived in this village heared about us, and they give us some\nfeather bed. Before already the baby was born. But the feather bed was full with fleas. I\nnever forgot. Ah was horrible. At night you could almost not sleep from the fleas, so I\nremember I hang it \u2014 Dutch people are very clean, and I was very clean and very proper, you\nknow. So I put \u2014 cleaning and scrubbing, that was my \u2014 we had nothing, but that apartment\nwhere we lived was so clean; so I hang it always outside. I thought it will kill the fleas, in the\n'\u00ae built (Dutch)\nfreezing will clear the fleas. But it don't. They go inside these feathers and when it gets\nwarm, they're getting out. So anyway, this would be the \u2014 that was not the worst we \u2014 you\nknow, the loneliness that I was there and I still was isolated from everybody. I couldn't talk\nto anybody. What could I talk with the baby? I couldn't even go to the doctor with the baby,\nbecause there wasn't nothing. I never went off with the baby to the doctor. And I cried so\nmuch that there was neighbors that, that the walls were very thin, that the neighbors made\nthe same sound already from my crying. Because I felt it was worse than camp almost\nbecause I had not to talk with anybody, and just that I was sitting with this baby. Maar\u2019,\nChaim had to go away to make some money, that the only way that he \u2014 I don't know. That\nwas the way it was.",
        "A: This was already \u2014 the war was over.",
        "A: That the war was over. When we went down from where we were hidden, the war was over.\nWhen we went down, where the farmer \u2014 and we went down, the war was \u2014 that was the end\nof the war. We saw the two Russian walking. And I remember I went to him and I kissed\nhim, and I say, \"Oh, you freed us!\"",
        "A: The Russian, the Russian soldiers, because they freed us. They didn't do anything to us. They\nwere also, not to the farmer. They didn't do anything in Poland to the people what they freed.\nIn Germany, they started doing that, but not to the Russian soldiers when they came to\nPoland, they didn't do anything to us. Because the Poles suffered, too. But the Russians\nsuffered tremendous from the Germans. What's \u2014 how many got killed in, in Russia, in\nStalingrad, and Leningrad; and so they were very nice to us. So in 1943, in July, the war was\nover. We were freed. 19\u2014 1944. 1944, July. 1943 we run away. October 14th we run away\nfrom concentration camp and nine months later in July, I think July \u2014 nine months later \u2014\nJune or July, we got freed in ....",
        "A: 1957.",
        "A: We, when we were in that village, one night we heard that, we heard that they want to kill all\nthe Jews in that village \u2014 partisans, the not-Jewish partisans in the woods. So middle of the\n19\nbut (Dutch)\nnight we went to Lublin. We rented a \u2014 or somebody took us with a truck. I don't know. I\nthink somebody with a truck what also ran away, went to Lublin, and we stayed in Lublin\nwith Podchlebnik~\u201d, also survivor from Sobibor. That was one of the survivors what run\naway from Sobibor. And we stay \u2014 and he was already a long time and he was already a big\nshot. He made already a lot of money. So when we were there Chaim met some Dutch\npeople, and they told him that they're planning to go over the land to Russia. They organized\nsome Dutch people \u2014 was also a Dutch captain \u2014 they organize all the Dutch people. Chaim\nsay he was Dutch. In between Chaim say he was Dutch, and he went \u2014 we went over\nRomania, Hungary, and we took three months in freight wagons with 140 people, with two \u2014\nthey made two layers out of it. We slept down with the baby, with a sick baby 1n between. I\ngot dysentery, and the baby got dysentery; and we stayed and we went, with, and we didn't\nget much to eat, and no, washing \u2014 not to wash yourself. I nursed, I nursed the baby. So, and\nwe went to, we stayed in Chernovitz. That is Romania. We stayed there two weeks in a camp\nwith gypsies and all people that were \u2014 that Hitler went after, what were survivors....",
        "A: Israel, I went in, in '51. We went \u2014 we lived in Holland before then.",
        "A: That's the end of the story.",
        "A: So tell Chaim, \"Tell that story.\" That's very interesting. The baby died on the way to, to\nHolland, on the boat. When we went on the boat, the baby died on the boat from food\npoisoning and died and was buried in the sea.\nTECHNICAL CONVERSATION",
        "A: We went to Holland. And from Holland, we went to Israel; when I didn't want to live in\nHolland anymore. My whole family was killed \u2014 everybody, nothing left. I didn't want to\nlive in Holland. So, he would like to live in Holland. I didn't \u2014 compare from Pole, Holland is\ngorgeous; but I, I didn't want \u2014 I couldn't live in Holland anymore. And it was very hard for\nhim, too, in Holland, to start \u2014 he's a businessman. It was very hard to start in Holland a\nbusiness. Holland, you have to go three years to school, we had already between us two\nchildren. We have two children. So, you could very easy go to Israel, but you couldn't come\nin to America. Especially on Polish quota. And I \u2014 so we went to Israel.\n* Shlomo Podchlebnik\n[TECHNICAL CONVERSATION]\n"
