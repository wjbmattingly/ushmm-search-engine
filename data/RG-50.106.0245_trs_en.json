At that\ntime a local person couldn\u2019t come into hotel, the hotel was only for international\nvisitors. You couldn\u2019t walk in. And if you walked in, you had to leave his passport\nat the desk, and they had to check what it is, and report to the [indecipherable] and\nthen he came to see \u2014 then he 1s allowed to come and see us. And of course that was\nemotional to \u2014 Moshe didn\u2019t remember \u2014 you remembered him? You did\nremember? Anyhow \u2014 okay. And then he tells us a story like this, which is\nunbelievable story. He says he is married, he has four children, one son, one\ndaughter and twin \u2014 twin girls. And he remained a Jew. He was also in the camp\nand survived, but he is still a Jew, in heart. And he knows that if he\u2019Il stay with the\nchil \u2014 with the family in \u2014 in Prague, they will lose the children.

        "Q: So what happened with those children?\nA2: Wait. This is the story. When we were in London, Moshe got in touch with the\nchief rabbi, who was the che \u2014 Jacobowitz was? I don\u2019t remember, who was rabbi\nche \u2014",
        "A: Jacobowitz.\nA2: Jacobowitz, yeah. And he told them the story. So \u2014 no, no, it wasn\u2019t that s \u2014\nthat \u2014 that fast, no, no, no, no. It wa \u2014 it took a few years, because yeah. He \u2014 every\nyear \u2014 okay \u2014 it\u2019s po \u2014 it\u2019s important. In Johannesburg Moshe was chazzan the\nshul. The shul was 1500 seats. But we have 2100 members. So 600 people davened\n101\nNovember 30, 2014\nevery Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur in the hall, that made it [indecipherable].\nSo Moshe brought this Singer to be the chazzan 1n the hall. But the Singer never\nwas a chazzan, he was an opera singer. So we brought him a fa \u2014 I don\u2019t know, a\nweek or two earlier. And day and night, and literally day and night, he taught him,\nlearn si\u2014 he could read. He knew the davening, he was a Jewish \u2014 I told you a Jew,\nbut he didn\u2019t know the nusach, and chazzan 1s not just singing, it\u2019s nusach. I don\u2019t\neven know what I\u2019m talking about, yeah?",
        "Q: Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.",
        "A: And yeah, he taught him and he beca \u2014 became the chazzan in \u2014 so he brought\nhim for about three years \u2014",
        "Q: To Johannesburg.",
        "A: \u2014 to Johannesburg to be the chazzan, and he got \u2014 he could take the money out,\nbecause he was a foreigner, and he took it back to \u2014 to \u2014 to Prague, and they had\nmoney extra. Prague was very bad at that time, I \u2014 I\u2019d have to tell you, because I\nremember I was asking the hotel if they have an orange. They looked at me \u2014 and it\nwas winter \u2014 they looked at me as if \u2014 as if I\u2019m asking a diamond. An orange,\nwinter, th-they didn\u2019t ha \u2014 they didn\u2019t have food. The only place \u2014 yeah, yeah, we\ntook \u2014 they had one store for the tourists, and there was everything, and also for the\ncommunist, for the high \u2014\n102November 30, 2014",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah, for the high ranking \u2014\nA2: So, because we were tourists, we took him, you remember, to the store, and we\nbought him \u2014 I remember he bought sour cream, we never \u2014 sour cream for the\nchildren. He was so excited, he\u2019d been missing for years sour cream. This 1s just an\nepisode \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.\nA2: \u2014 that was \u2014 I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s interesting. Okay, so this\u2019 Il \u2014 yeah, later, later,\nwe came to London, Moshe came to London, yeah, and he went to the chief rabbi,\ntell him the story. So the chief rabbi said, first of all, what we have to do, we have\nto take out the family, because how can we take \u2014 because we \u2014 we can\u2019t take\nchildren without family, it\u2019s important. So what did we do? They made co \u2014 a fake\n\u2014a fi\u2014a fictional \u2014 fiction contract, is that fiction, no. Yeah?",
        "Q: Fictional, yeah.\nA2: Fictional contract with a certain \u2014 with a shul that the rabbi arranged. They\ninvited this Mr. Singer to be a chazzan in the shul for three years.",
        "Q: In London\u201d\nA2: In London, and go to the government to show them the contract, and tell them\nwe are going for three years, and why the \u2014 and they allowed him to take the whole\nfamily, why? Because in London they \u2014 they have \u2014 I don\u2019t have other city in the\n103November 30, 2014\nworld, but London has an international school, every language. So they have also\nschool for Czech. So the government allowed them in \u2014 in \u2014 in \u2014 on condition that\nhe takes them to \u2014 the children to school, the Czech, yeah, and he had to leave\neverything behind. He had to buy books and paper, as if he is going to a school. We\nknew it\u2019s fiction, but \u2014",
        "Q: Yeah.\nA2: \u2014 he had to prove the government. And he left everything behind. Everything.\nAll the ma \u2014 furniture, everything. And only what they \u2014 they could take some\nclothes and this, and they came to London. And they never went back, of course.",
        "Q: Fantastic.\nA2: Yeah. And \u2014 and there were \u2014 he was in London for a short while, and then\nMoshe worked to bring them to Johannesburg. How do you bring a family from\nthe communist country to Johannesburg? Impossible. South Africa didn\u2019t have\nany connection with any \u2014 any diplomatic connection with those cun \u2014 any of the\ncountries, communist countries then. So how \u2014 and how can you bring a family? I\nremember the public prosecutor in Johannesburg, Dr. Yuta(ph) was a great friend\nof ours, so Moshe went to tell him the story. Said I want to bring a family. They\u2019re\nJews, they\u2019re not communists, I \u2014 I guarantee, and I want to bring them here. So,\nremember what Yuta(ph) told you? It ma \u2014 it made so he said, when here will grow\n104November 30, 2014\nhair, the government will allow a family to co \u2014 a communist country family to\ncome to South Africa. This is what he told you, right? I remember that. But you\ndon\u2019t know Moshe, he doesn\u2019t take no for an answer. He went to Pretoria \u2014\nPretoria the capital, yeah?",
        "Q: Yeah, yeah.\nA2: And he got in touch to the rabbi, Rabbi Katz, I remember, and he told him the\nstory and he said, just make an appointment with the foreign minister, or I don\u2019t\nknow which minister had to do with the \u2014 with the papers, and he made the\nappointment with him, and he came to him and he si \u2014 talked to him. He said \u2014 he\ntold him the story, and he burst out crying. He said, I am a Jew, he 1s a Jew. He 1s\nnot a communist, he wants to run away from the co \u2014 do \u2014 and he burst out crying,\nand he touched this man\u2019s heart, and he gave \u2014 he ba \u2014 he gave him the visas for\nfive people.",
        "Q: Wow.\nA2: Which is unheard of. Wait. Then when we \u2014 they brou \u2014 we brought them all.\nSo yeah, first of all we had to collect money to send them tickets. And we brought\nthem all, we find them an apartment, where to buy furniture [indecipherable]\ndishes, clothes, sink. The whole city wa \u2014 col \u2014 was sending. We \u2014 we \u2014 it was in\nthe papers, of course, we put \u2014 the whole story was in the paper, and everybody\n105November 30, 2014\nbrought something. We di \u2014 made the furniture. And Moshe gave him position, he\nbecame a cantor in Johannesburg.",
        "Q: Wow.\nA2: He was there for years. When we left in \u201970, South Africa, he was still cantor\nthere. So this is a story.",
        "Q: You sa \u2014 you saved his life, his family, fantastic.\nA2: Five \u2014 five people, five people saved. This is one story.",
        "A: It\u2019s not the only one.\nA2: Yeah, the other \u2014 yeah \u2014",
        "A: There is a doctor what I saved \u2014\nA2: \u2014 this \u2014 I\u2019m going to tell the other story. This also ve \u2014 a very interesting story,\nthe other story. I didn\u2019t mention you \u2014 to you that in \u2014 in the building, you see there\nnext to the shul, there\u2019s a building, yeah? On the left is the big, famous shul, but on\nthe right, this 1s the Jewish community. And there is the only place where you can\neat kosher, because they have a kitchen [indecipherable] kitchen. The food, I\nmean, mostly potatoes that time, there was much \u2014 not much to eat. But this is the\nonly place we ate. When we went there for our meals, nobody will talk to us,\nbecause they saw \u2014 everybody was suspicious, thought we are spies, they don\u2019t us,\nwhy should they talk to us? And even there, people didn\u2019t talk anything personal,\n106November 30, 2014\nbecause they were afraid of the shadow, that atmosphere then, unbelievable\nfrightening. And \u2014 and also, by the way, when we went to \u2014 to the \u2014 Singer\u2019s home,\nhe took us to his home, they were all sitting with coats, because they didn\u2019t even\nhave heating. This was 1n \u2014 in \u2014 in January, in winter, yeah. Terrible, terrible\ncondition. [indecipherable] was \u2014 so okay, so one day, in the hote \u2014 in the\nrestaurant, we met those two brothers in the restaurant over in shul where?

And the same thing, those two brothers waited outside\nand we \u2014 they walked us to the hotel, and on the way to the hotel, they told us their\nlife story. What was their life story? They both survived somehow -\u2014 they was also\nin a concentration camp. And after \u2014 after the war, they thought communism is of\ncourse the solution for everybody.

In Prague we have a few stories, a few stories.\nThe first one, we stayed in a hotel, and there was no western people there. The only\npeople who stayed in this hotel was so dark from \u2014 from iddel \u2014 Middle East Arabs,\nI don\u2019t know, a-and Russians. And we were the only ones [indecipherable] of\ncourse, Israeli passport. So one day, the desk calls us and they said, there\u2019s a man\ncome to see you. We didn\u2019t know it \u2014 who it is. To make the story short, there was a\nman in \u2014 in \u2014 his name is Singer. Actually, he was an opera singer. And he\nremembered Moshe, they went to chayder together at home [indecipherable]\nNovember 30, 2014\ntogether. When he heard the name, he knew who itt is. So he came to see us. At that\ntime a local person couldn\u2019t come into hotel, the hotel was only for international\nvisitors. You couldn\u2019t walk in. And if you walked in, you had to leave his passport\nat the desk, and they had to check what it is, and report to the [indecipherable] and\nthen he came to see \u2014 then he 1s allowed to come and see us. And of course that was\nemotional to \u2014 Moshe didn\u2019t remember \u2014 you remembered him? You did\nremember? Anyhow \u2014 okay. And then he tells us a story like this, which is\nunbelievable story. He says he is married, he has four children, one son, one\ndaughter and twin \u2014 twin girls. And he remained a Jew. He was also in the camp\nand survived, but he is still a Jew, in heart. And he knows that if he\u2019Il stay with the\nchil \u2014 with the family in \u2014 in Prague, they will lose the children. They\u2019ll become\ngoyim. They will intermarry, because the Jewish life wasn\u2019t as interested \u2014 as\norganized. I don\u2019t know if they had the chief rabbi there \u2014 they did \u2014 yeah, they did\nhave a chief rabbi. And \u2014 and their son is already 18, and he\u2019s already a member of\nthe youth \u2014 they were poor \u2014 poor gi \u2014 poor \u2014 poor communists, of course,\n[indecipherable] communists, and he\u2019s afraid he will lose them.",
        "A: He lent me the money to buy this picture.\nA2: Yeah?",
        "A: The chief rabbi.\nNovember 30, 2014\nA2: Oh, there wa \u2014 this 1s the \u2014 the shul in Prague, the Altneuschul in Prague.",

        "A: \u2014 you will see him.\nA2: No, he said \u2014 he told us that American when they come, they want to see the\ngolem.\nNovember 30, 2014\nA2: So yeah, sure, you can see him, but it cost five dollars \u2014\nNovember 30, 2014\nShall I tell the story what happened to me? It\u2019s not important. I don\u2019t have to, but\nit\u2019s remarkable, but I don\u2019t know \u2014 okay, I \u2014",

So Moshe left,\nand I remained in pra \u2014 in Prague alone. It was very unpleasant, it \u2014 to be 1n the\nhotel, it was all those Arabs, a woman alone, and they looked at me all the time, you\nknow. This is not important. But this Mr. Singer, he was my connection. He is the\nonly one I knew. And as it happened, it \u2014 ish \u2014 sho \u2014 told me where to go, to the\nopera, and the ballet and all that. So then, we had an agreement, he didn\u2019t know\nhow long he\u2019Il be in \u2014 in Bucharest, so \u2014 and I remained a week in Prague,\nbecause this was my passport, I couldn\u2019t leave [indecipherable] or something. So\nwe had \u2014 we stayed from there \u2014 at \u2014 at \u2014 in the meantime we were in Russia, but\nwe told you about Russia. You forgot one story in Russia. Was the man who came\nto told you \u2014 tell you that he\u2019s grandson of this \u2014 that he sang this song for you, the\nYiddish song.\n100November 30, 2014\nA2: So I look at \u2014 oh, look, he wears \u2014 wear \u2014 we have the same coats. And they let\nus so \u2014 1f not the same coat \u2014 because his passport was still in his suitcase, and we\nwere so excited we forgot to show them the passport, it\u2019s the same name, we just\nshow the co \u2014 the coat. So this is one little episode about that. Okay, what can we\ntell them more about the trip behind the cu \u2014 Iron Curtain? Is there anything else?\nOh yeah, in Prague, was true \u2014 true stor \u2014 yeah, yeah. So this was one story, the\nPrague, that he wanted to give us children, right?",
        "A: Okay, so let\u2019s \u2014 Pll finish this and Pll have another story. When we were in\nLondon \u2014",
        "A: Jacobowitz.\nA2: Jacobowitz, yeah. And he told them the story. So \u2014 no, no, it wasn\u2019t that s \u2014\nthat \u2014 that fast, no, no, no, no. It wa \u2014 it took a few years, because yeah. He \u2014 every\nyear \u2014 okay \u2014 it\u2019s po \u2014 it\u2019s important. In Johannesburg Moshe was chazzan the\nshul. The shul was 1500 seats.

And day and night, and literally day and night, he taught him,\nlearn si\u2014 he could read. He knew the davening, he was a Jewish \u2014 I told you a Jew,\nbut he didn\u2019t know the nusach, and chazzan 1s not just singing, it\u2019s nusach. I don\u2019t\neven know what I\u2019m talking about, yeah?",
        "A: And yeah, he taught him and he beca \u2014 became the chazzan in \u2014 so he brought\nhim for about three years \u2014",
