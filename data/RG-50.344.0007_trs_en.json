        "Question: Okay, this is Nina Ellis, interviewing Clarice MacLeod on July 15th, 1995.\nThis is the firs-first side of that interview and we are in West Park, New York. Please\ntell me where were you -- when and where were you born?",
        "Answer: I was born in Philadelphia, New York in 1917. Why I emphasize the New\nYork, everybody thinks it\u2019s PA.",
        "Q: Tell me a little bit about the town you were raised in and your family. Tell me\nsomething about your family.",
        "A: We moved when I was about three years old, so I don\u2019t remember much about the\ntown, but I do remember it was mostly farmland and they were just building the roads,\nthere was no thruway or any of this. And then we moved about seven miles south, to a\nlittle place called Levin\u2019s Mills and that\u2019s where I went to school and was brought up\nand graduated in \u201835 and that\u2019s about tt.",
        "Q: When did you decide you wanted to be a nurse?",
        "A: I think when I was in my senior year in high school. We didn\u2019t have much choices\nin that time as to what you could do. Was a nurse or a secretary or a teacher. And I can\nremember a lecture that our professor gave and he said, \u201cDo what you think you can\ndo for the most people.\u201d And I think that\u2019s what decided me to be a nurse. No -- no\nspecial reason, really.\nJuly 15, 1998",
        "Q: When did you go to nursing school?",
        "A: 1935. Graduated \u00b038.",
        "Q: Where at?",
        "A: At House of the Samaritan in Watertown, which is another small city in upstate\nNew York.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. And what did you do when you got out of nursing school in 1938?",
        "A: I did general duty and I did private duty and in following years I worked with the\nvisiting nurse association. I guess that was after I came back from service. That\u2019s\nabout it. General duty and private duty for me.",
        "Q: And when -- and when and why did you decide to go in the service?",
        "A: Thad nothing to hold me at home. I knew that nurses were needed. I knew that I\ncould be covered at home by older nurses who had children and whatever and I didn\u2019t\nsee any reason why I shouldn\u2019t go and I felt I could be of some help, I guess. That\u2019s\nthe only reason.",
        "Q: You know other people that were going in?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: No?",
        "A: No.",
        "Q: Hm. Where did you find out about overseas service for nurses? Something that just\n[indecipherable]\nJuly 15, 1998",
        "A: Well, that was aft -- no, that was after I\u2019d gone through basic training and they just\nsent us there. You had no idea that -- what you would be doing, you know. No, they\njust all of a sudden said, \u201cYou\u2019re going overseas,\u201d and you accepted that, well, I think\nyou probably expected it at one time or another, but no, no special --",
        "Q: Where did you do your basic?",
        "A: Atlantic City, New Jersey.",
        "Q: What was that like?",
        "A: Hard. Did lot of marching, up and down the boardwalk.",
        "Q: Marching on the boardwalk?",
        "A: Oh yes, but they were very strict, I think because you were 1n basic training. But\nenjoyed it really and -- enjoyed it.",
        "Q: What other kinds of things do you -- do you remember from basic training?",
        "A: Nothing much, really. I can\u2019t remember that we went any place special. I can\u2019t even\nremember what the meals were.",
        "Q: Must not have been too good, if you can\u2019t remember.",
        "A: Or else it must have been real good. I don\u2019t know how to answer [indecipherable]",
        "Q: Okay. And when -- when did you go overseas and -- and how did you find out\nabout that?",
        "A: Oh, let\u2019s see, we had -- I was sent to South Carolina. Well, I guess it was then that\nthey told us that we were preparing to go overseas, because we had to learned how to\nJuly 15, 1998\npitch tents and do all -- dig trenches and all this. And I think was about November\nmaybe, they told us that we were going overseas. And we -- I can\u2019t remember what the\ndate we got on the boat, but I remember we arrived December 22nd, in Scotland. And\nthat\u2019s about it.",
        "Q: Do you remember very much of the crossing? About the boat, or what -- what it\nwas like on the boat?",
        "A: Yes, there was 19 of us in a stateroom that normally held two people. I remember\nwe were told that we might be -- the -- the Germans were hitting -- with submarines,\nmight do damage to our boat and we had to sleep one night fully dressed and with our\nhelmets on, we were told that. Life on the Queen Elizabeth was just casual because\neverything certainly was different than it was 1n peacetime.",
        "Q: Was it crowded?",
        "A: Mm-hm, mm-hm, very.",
        "Q: And then you landed in?",
        "A: 22nd of December we landed in Greenock, Scotland. From there we went to\nEngland. Alteringham | think it was. And that was -- and then from there we just\nkept moving with the flow. We went to France and we went to Belgium and then on\nto Germany.",
        "Q: And when you were in Germany then, you were treating men who were coming\nback from battle?\nJuly 15, 1998",
        "A: Yes, some, but mostly when -- they were patients right off the field, because we\nwere the first unit to get them right off the field. And we were treating some -- and\nsometimes we had to do temporary duty at other hospitals.",
        "Q: And what was your specific job? Were you in a ward or in a operating room?",
        "A: I was in the operating room, anesthetist.",
        "Q: Anesthetist.",
        "A: So I\u2019m kind of lost as to -- I feel kind of sorry, because I liked the contact with the\npatients and of course I didn\u2019t have much of that, you know, it was [inaudible]",
        "Q: So they would come in and you\u2019d knock them out and that would be it.",
        "A: Yeah, that\u2019s about it, that\u2019s about it.",
        "Q: Uh-huh, uh-huh. And did you ever get much contact with them later?",
        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: Or were you just in doing that over and over and over?",
        "A: Mm-hm, mm-hm, no. In fact there were very few times that you would have -- well\nI -- maybe you were so busy that you didn\u2019t, I don\u2019t know, but you didn\u2019t contact them\nat -- on the ward after they left the operating room, as a rule.",
        "Q: What kind of anesthesia was used?",
        "A: Retrous oxide and Sodium Pentothal. | can\u2019t remember about ether. I think\nprobably that was initially -- started a patient out maybe on ether, but didn\u2019t give it to\nhim for the full surgical operation.\nJuly 15, 1998",
        "Q: Why was that?",
        "A: Well, cause it\u2019s a little bit too heavy, I think, for a long operation. Or else it was the\ndoctor\u2019s choice. I don't remember [inaudible]",
        "Q: Mm. And it -- that -- was that the same job you always did? Did people rotate in\nand out of different jobs, or --",
        "A: No. Prior to that, I had worked in hospitals before we went overseas. Like there was\nHalloran General in -- in Staten Island. I was at Mason General, which was a\npsychiatric hospital in New York. No, anesthesia was only when I was overseas.",
        "Q: And did you have special training for that?",
        "A: No, the -- the anesthetist taught me how to -- you know -- I had worked on the\noperating before, but not as an assess -- an anes-anesthesiast, when I working not --\nnot --",
        "Q: D-During that job, do you stay there, in the operating room the whole -- during the\nwhole procedure and --",
        "A: The surgery?",
        "Q: Yeah.",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: You do?",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: What do you do during the surgery?\nJuly 15, 1998",
        "A: You monitor the patient. I mean that\u2019s a constant thing, you have to do that until a\nsurgery\u2019s over. And of course you\u2019d go from one patient to the next -- I mean it was\nlike, today, they schedule their -- your surgery and --",
        "Q: So you were constantly monitoring their vital signs, is that --",
        "A: Mm-hm, mm-hm.",
        "Q: Uh-huh, uh-huh. Were those quick surgeries, or --",
        "A: No, a lot of them were repair surgeries. Mine explosions and fractures. No, I\nwouldn\u2019t call them -- I think maybe what you mean is you did the initial thing there\nand sent them on to a major general hospital, yes, that\u2019s true, likely.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: Yeah.",
        "Q: But they weren\u2019t necessarily like an emergency room situation where you just --",
        "A: Well, yes and no. They\u2019re emergencies because they have to be done right away,\ncause they\u2019re right off the field. Yes, I guess probably you would say they were\nemergencies, yeah.",
        "Q: Mm-hm, Mm-hm.",
        "A: Yeah. But then they were sent to the wards afterwards until they could be\ntransported to a -- a major hospital.",
        "Q: And what was it like when you were off duty? What kinds of things did you do?\nJuly 15, 1998",
        "A: Just -- I guess walking, you\u2019d play ball, you\u2019d read. You\u2019d do anything to pass your\ntime away. I don\u2019t think there was any specific thing and like I said, you made your\nown fun. Cause you naturally didn\u2019t watch TV and listen to the radio and all that jazz.\nNo, I just -- camaraderie I guess, with your roommates and --",
        "Q: You all get along?",
        "A: Oh, yeah. I -- I can\u2019t remember ever having an argument with -- that\u2019s why I said\nit\u2019s a good training, a good learning.",
        "Q: Being in the service, you mean, or --",
        "A: Well yes, but I\u2019m -- even in the hospital you see when you\u2019re -- when you\u2019re in\ntraining to be a nurse, you\u2019re pretty much in with a block of other nurses and you learn\n-- course most of us knew how to get along with other people, but I think being in that\nclose proximity, you are more aware of it, maybe. But you asked what we did, I don\u2019t\neven know what we did, but the time went fast. And -- and we couldn\u2019t be out by\nourselves, you had to -- like when we were at the concentration camp, or in Germany,\nyou had to have an armed guard and there weren\u2019t enough available because they were\nguarding the camps. So well, you didn\u2019t get to see too much.",
        "Q: Did you mingle with the men at all very much?",
        "A: Yes, we had parties for the enlisted men and -- and you\u2019d go to the officer\u2019s lounge\nfor either eating or having a drink or whatever. Yeah, you mingled, not -- you know,\nnot all the time, but yeah, yeah.\nJuly 15, 1998",
        "Q: Mm-hm. And how long do you figure you were in Germany?",
        "A: Not very long.",
        "Q: You were there for VE Day?",
        "A: Yup. I remember that one. I think we might have left -- I think we might have gone\nin there -- I know at Easter time we were in -- in France or in Belgium, one or the\nother. So it might have been May til \u2019'd say maybe sometime in July. So it wasn\u2019t very\nlong, really.",
        "Q: Mm-hm.",
        "A: We were there for the liberation, we were there for -- well, they liberated the camp\nand -- and that\u2019s when our colonel said that we could go. We were left behind, all the\nboys went over to --",
        "Q: Your unit --",
        "A: -- |-liberate the -- yeah --.",
        "Q: This is the 113th -- we didn\u2019t say this.",
        "A: This is -- no, 13 1st.",
        "Q: 131st, \u2019'm sorry.",
        "A: Yeah, 13 1st.",
        "Q: And what\u2019s -- the full title is?",
        "A: 131st evacuation unit.",
        "Q: Uh-huh, and it -- they split off and they went ahead to Austria and left you behind?\nJuly 15, 1998",
        "A: No, we were already -- th-th-they went -- now where were we? I think we were like\nin Kern and they left and went to Austria. And -- no, there were still some there,\nbecause they couldn\u2019t leave women alone in that area. But they -- most of them left\nand liberated the -- I think I have a thing downstairs that tells about that. And our\ncolonel said when he came back that he was not -- what\u2019s the word? Forcing any --\nany of the nurses to go. We could go if we wanted to and everybody but one elected to\ngo. And course, when we got there, it was quite a sensation, but --",
        "Q: Do you remember arriving?",
        "A: Mm-hm, mm-hm.",
        "Q: What was that like?",
        "A: Well, we all went up in trucks of course and when we got there, there were patients\nintermingled. Some of them were dead and some of them were still living. All on one\nroom. There might have been some bunks in there and I guess several maybe in a\nbunk, but I think the sad part was that some were alive and some were dead. And we\nhad a fine chaplain who buried them, put crosses on every one -- in fact I have pictures\nof that too, downstairs. But that\u2019s about it, I guess.",
        "Q: And what did you do there? What was your assignment while you were there?",
        "A: That\u2019s when I worked in the operating room and when we would get -- well, I just\nhad to do what patients were there, what necessarily had to be done, but you\u2019d also be\ngetting patients from outside in the interim. I mean they were always coming in. But\nJuly 15, 1998\nwe did do some work on some of the patients that were there as far as -- well, we\ncalled them patients, they were really prisoners.",
        "Q: Did you s -- did you set up your tent hospital there, is that what you were working\nin?",
        "A: We -- we were -- no, we were in the -- we were housed in houses, regular houses.\nNice -- fact, it\u2019s the nicest place we stayed. But, in the hospital itself, they were like\nlong wooden -- they weren\u2019t tents. We -- we were set up in tents three or four different\ntimes, but when we were there, this was a long, wooden building with --",
        "Q: And the name of this camp was Gusen?",
        "A: Gusen, mm-hm.",
        "Q: A sub-camp of --",
        "A: Mauthausen.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Do you have any sense of how many people were there -- how many\nwhen you got there, how many former prisoners there were?",
        "A: No, and I don\u2019t know whether I have a record of that.",
        "Q: W-Would have been hundreds or thousands or --",
        "A: Oh, hundreds, I\u2019m sure. Thousands, no, I don\u2019t think so, because a lot of them --\nwhen I say a lot, some had just taken off. Heavens knows where they went, but they --\nwhen they were liberated, they just went. But there were still a lot of them there.\nJuly 15, 1998",
        "Q: And you would then, every day, go into the surgery -- into the operating room and\nthat was your job?",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. What kinds of it -- what kinds of injuries were you seeing? Or what --\nwhat kinds of things were --",
        "A: Well, like I said, mine blow ups or whatever. Not too much gunfire problems.\nSometimes you\u2019d get a patient in who\u2019d been shot or whatever, but n -- a lot that I can\nremember were mines.",
        "Q: Land mines?",
        "A: Land mines that exploded by people walking over them or whatever.",
        "Q: A-And this was after the fighting had stopped, though? Or were these people who\nwere injured before?",
        "A: No, this was -- the fighting had stopped, yeah.",
        "Q: But people were still --",
        "A: Still coming in because those land mines weren\u2019t deactivated for a long time after,\neven after we left, I\u2019m sure. So --",
        "Q: And what about -- I\u2019d heard that there were people in that camp who had been\nexperimented on surgically by the Germans.",
        "A: I read that.",
        "Q: Did you see any of that?\nJuly 15, 1998",
        "A: No, no.",
        "Q: You never saw that? People like that --",
        "A: But I believe from what I read that that probably happened, yes. I think too that the\nmajor one I read about was Dachau and of course that was earlier than when we went\nover there, so [indecipherable] I read all that, yeah. But no -- not that I know whereof.",
        "Q: Did you get out and see much of the camp itself?",
        "A: Mm-mm.",
        "Q: Did you see -- for example, there was a quarry there where a lot of prisoners were f",
        "A: Yeah, when we went to work, there was a long s -- line of steps or whatever in the\nquarry and many mornings when we\u2019d go, naturally, to have breakfast and whatever\nand then go to work, the Russians or the Germans had put a whole mess of stones in\nfront, so they had to be removed before the nurses could walk up to get to the camp.",
        "Q: Uh-huh. So you had to go up those stairs?",
        "A: Mm-hm.",
        "Q: Did you know at the time that that -- prisoners had been forced to walk up and\ndown those stairs? Did you know about that?",
        "A: No, I didn\u2019t know about that.",
        "Q: Hm. And the crematorium, did you see that?\nJuly 15, 1998",
        "A: We ah -- yes, we saw that. We did not see it in op -- I didn\u2019t see it in operation.\nBefore we atrived there, there was the stench of the crematorium, which was sad. But\nas far as being in use when we were there, I never saw that. I don\u2019t know. But I\u2019m sure\nthat it had been used.",
        "Q: Mm-hm. Did you -- were you aware of local people in Linz coming there for any\nreason to the camp or to work or just to see it, or --",
        "A: No, not to be aware -- daily. They used to bring in a truckload of personnel that\nthey would go and pick up off the street.",
        "Q: US Army would do that?",
        "A: Would do that. Local, I mean people from our working area. And many times the\npatients would recognize some of these people that were picked up as being SSers,\nabusive people -- which we weren\u2019t aware of until this, you know, they started coming\nin. No, as far as viewers, I can\u2019t ever remember people just coming to look around, but\nthat -- that could happen, I suppose. But I don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t know. I wouldn\u2019t think so at\nthat stage of the game.",
        "Q: It\u2019s pretty early.",
        "A: Yeah, I don\u2019t think there would have been people coming in just to view the area, if\nyou know --",
        "Q: But you mentioned that some of the patients would recognize people and -- do you\nremember any -- any specific incident like that, when somebody said something or --\nJuly 15, 1998",
        "A: No. I think probably I was told this, because I was not on the wards and probably\nsome of my nurse friends told me about this. No, I did -- I was -- I did not see this.",
        "Q: Yeah. You were in the operating room all the time, right.",
        "A: Operating room, yeah, but --",
        "Q: What about some of the people who -- the former inmates there who were well\nenough to walk around? Did you see those people?",
        "A: Yes. They were skin and bones. Well, many, many days they would -- like when\nwe went there, we s -- naturally fed them. There were two doors to each one of those\nbarracks. They would come in one door and go out the other door, so they were really\noverfed. But they would take their food and bury it outside of the -- the barracks,\nbecause they thought some time that they might need it -- if there -- they didn\u2019t know\nthat they were liberated. They didn\u2019t know too much. You could see in a week\u2019s time\nhow they improved and all that, but they really were mentally and physically -- I don\u2019t\nknow the word to describe it.",
        "Q: But they would bury their food in the ground?",
        "A: Bury their food in hopes that one -- they could get out of there. I suppose they\nconstantly had in their mind that they would -- were going to get out, you know, or\nwould get out some way or another. And they would bury their food so that they\nwould have something to take with them, until we finally got them educated, that they\ncould have food every day and three times a day and that they didn\u2019t have to do that,\nJuly 15, 1998\nthat they were liberated. But here again, where could they go? They had no place to\ngo, really.",
        "Q: Did you know at the time where those people were or who they were? Did you\nknow if they were Jewish people or not?",
        "A: Mm-mm.",
        "Q: Did you know anything about them?",
        "A: Mm-mm.",
        "Q: Did you learn, after time went by?",
        "A: No, I\u2019m sure that whatever records -- and they did have some records, I\u2019m sure that\nothers could tell you about this, like Colonel Case was our chaplain and he did a lot of\nthis. Maybe a lot of the nurses that worked on the wards could tell you this, because\nthey certainly got what information they could from them. And names and numbers, if\nthey had any numbers. But I\u2019m sure a lot of them didn\u2019t even have names or numbers\nand probably couldn\u2019t remember. I know that there were -- I think more Polish, maybe\nthey were Polish Jewish, I don\u2019t know, than there were actually just Jewish people.\nYou see, this was quite awhile after the Holocaust, really. The Holocaust started in\nwhat, \u201842\u00b0? \u201843? And we were there in early \u201845. So a lot of this happened before we\neven arrived, I\u2019m sure -- having watched the movie.",
        "Q: You learn about it afterwards.",
        "A: Yeah.\nJuly 15, 1998",
        "Q: When -- when did you get out of the service, do you remember?",
        "A: October \u00b045, I had a separation. That was -- yeah, 1940 -- October \u00b045, in -- some\ntime in \u201851 I was recalled.",
        "Q: Really?",
        "A: Because I didn\u2019t realize that when you were separated, that you were supposed to\ntake two weeks training every year or they could recall you. Which they did. Cause at\nthat time it was maybe --",
        "Q: What is a separation, I don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t know the word separation?",
        "A: You were just separated -- nobody -- at the time I got out, nobody actually had a so-\ncalled discharge. Everybody was just separated. You got your discharge later, but --\nand I think at one time there was a choice too, as to whether you were discharged or\njust separated and I think, for some reason, I chose not to be discharged. And I think\nthat I did this because -- thinking of retirement. Well, I was uneducated and in order to\n-- to do this, you had to spend two weeks training a year, which I didn\u2019t know. So they\nrecalled me, to make up I suppose for the time that I should have spent or I say should\nhave, I -- yeah, I guess it would be. So -- and at that time, I was married, but I was\nstationed at Massachu -- in Massachusetts and eventually I got transferred to Fort\nDrum, which is very -- 10 miles within my home, I could live at home except when I\nwas on call in the OR and that was probably two or three nights a week that I had to\nstay on call.

        "A: I think it was very important and I\u2019m not sorry a bit that we went or that I went, no.\nI think it was necessary. I think it was good experience, a good training. I think that I\ndid a part to help. I guess that\u2019s it.",

I don\u2019t understand a lot of things that are going on\ntoday, like in Bosnia and wherever. I cannot believe that some one man could be so\ncruel as Mr. Hitler. But that\u2019s the way it was. There will always be wars, there will\nalways be people like him. So, I don\u2019t know -- you say, how different? I guess I was\nmore educated in that line and that\u2019s about all.

In fact my niece did a theme when she was a senior and at that time there\nhad been a lot of news in the paper about people not believing it happened and she had\ncut some of those out and sent them to me. But no, I\u2019ve not talked with anybody who\nsaid it couldn\u2019t have happened, no. I think everybody felt that it was true and maybe\nnot to the severity of it, but they -- because I don\u2019t think you could believe it until you\nsaw it, really.

        "A: No, I didn\u2019t know about that.\nJuly 15, 1998",
        "A: We ah -- yes, we saw that. We did not see it in op -- I didn\u2019t see it in operation.\nBefore we atrived there, there was the stench of the crematorium, which was sad. But\nas far as being in use when we were there, I never saw that. I don\u2019t know. But I\u2019m sure\nthat it had been used.",
        "A: No, not to be aware -- daily. They used to bring in a truckload of personnel that\nthey would go and pick up off the street.",
        "A: Would do that. Local, I mean people from our working area. And many times the\npatients would recognize some of these people that were picked up as being SSers,\nabusive people -- which we weren\u2019t aware of until this, you know, they started coming\nin. No, as far as viewers, I can\u2019t ever remember people just coming to look around, but\nthat -- that could happen, I suppose. But I don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t know. I wouldn\u2019t think so at\nthat stage of the game.",
        "A: Yeah, I don\u2019t think there would have been people coming in just to view the area, if\nyou know --\nJuly 15, 1998",
        "A: No. I think probably I was told this, because I was not on the wards and probably\nsome of my nurse friends told me about this. No, I did -- I was -- I did not see this.",
        "A: Operating room, yeah, but --",
        "A: Yes. They were skin and bones. Well, many, many days they would -- like when\nwe went there, we s -- naturally fed them. There were two doors to each one of those\nbarracks. They would come in one door and go out the other door, so they were really\noverfed. But they would take their food and bury it outside of the -- the barracks,\nbecause they thought some time that they might need it -- if there -- they didn\u2019t know\nthat they were liberated. They didn\u2019t know too much. You could see in a week\u2019s time\nhow they improved and all that, but they really were mentally and physically -- I don\u2019t\nknow the word to describe it.",
        "A: Bury their food in hopes that one -- they could get out of there. I suppose they\nconstantly had in their mind that they would -- were going to get out, you know, or\nwould get out some way or another. And they would bury their food so that they\nwould have something to take with them, until we finally got them educated, that they\ncould have food every day and three times a day and that they didn\u2019t have to do that,\nJuly 15, 1998\nthat they were liberated. But here again, where could they go? They had no place to\ngo, really.",
        "A: Mm-mm.",
        "A: Mm-mm.",
        "A: No, I\u2019m sure that whatever records -- and they did have some records, I\u2019m sure that\nothers could tell you about this, like Colonel Case was our chaplain and he did a lot of\nthis. Maybe a lot of the nurses that worked on the wards could tell you this, because\nthey certainly got what information they could from them. And names and numbers, if\nthey had any numbers. But I\u2019m sure a lot of them didn\u2019t even have names or numbers\nand probably couldn\u2019t remember. I know that there were -- I think more Polish, maybe\nthey were Polish Jewish, I don\u2019t know, than there were actually just Jewish people.\nYou see, this was quite awhile after the Holocaust, really. The Holocaust started in\nwhat, \u201842\u00b0? \u201843? And we were there in early \u201845. So a lot of this happened before we\neven arrived, I\u2019m sure -- having watched the movie.",
        "A: Yeah.\nJuly 15, 1998",
        "A: October \u00b045, I had a separation. That was -- yeah, 1940 -- October \u00b045, in -- some\ntime in \u201851 I was recalled.",
        "A: Because I didn\u2019t realize that when you were separated, that you were supposed to\ntake two weeks training every year or they could recall you. Which they did. Cause at\nthat time it was maybe --",
        "A: You were just separated -- nobody -- at the time I got out, nobody actually had a so-\ncalled discharge. Everybody was just separated. You got your discharge later, but --\nand I think at one time there was a choice too, as to whether you were discharged or\njust separated and I think, for some reason, I chose not to be discharged. And I think\nthat I did this because -- thinking of retirement. Well, I was uneducated and in order to\n-- to do this, you had to spend two weeks training a year, which I didn\u2019t know. So they\nrecalled me, to make up I suppose for the time that I should have spent or I say should\nhave, I -- yeah, I guess it would be. So -- and at that time, I was married, but I was\nstationed at Massachu -- in Massachusetts and eventually I got transferred to Fort\nDrum, which is very -- 10 miles within my home, I could live at home except when I\nwas on call in the OR and that was probably two or three nights a week that I had to\nstay on call. And the rest of the time I could live at home and I had it made.\nJuly 15, 1998",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: Yes.",
        "A: I think it was very important and I\u2019m not sorry a bit that we went or that I went, no.\nI think it was necessary. I think it was good experience, a good training. I think that I\ndid a part to help. I guess that\u2019s it.",
        "A: I don\u2019t think I\u2019m any different than a lot of people. I don\u2019t understand it. I don\u2019t\nunderstand how it could be done. I don\u2019t understand a lot of things that are going on\ntoday, like in Bosnia and wherever. I cannot believe that some one man could be so\ncruel as Mr. Hitler. But that\u2019s the way it was. There will always be wars, there will\nalways be people like him. So, I don\u2019t know -- you say, how different? I guess I was\nmore educated in that line and that\u2019s about all. I just never gave it any thought before\nand I still just can\u2019t believe that those things happened, but they did.\nJuly 15, 1998",
        "A: Before I went in the service, I never -- I guess I probably was aware of it reading\nthe papers, but never -- maybe then I just didn\u2019t believe it. I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know.\nNever as aware as I was when I was there and witnessed what we did.",
        "A: No, no. In fact my niece did a theme when she was a senior and at that time there\nhad been a lot of news in the paper about people not believing it happened and she had\ncut some of those out and sent them to me. But no, I\u2019ve not talked with anybody who\nsaid it couldn\u2019t have happened, no. I think everybody felt that it was true and maybe\nnot to the severity of it, but they -- because I don\u2019t think you could believe it until you\nsaw it, really. Except if you had family or whatever, you know. Then it\u2019s -- would be a\ndifferent story.",
