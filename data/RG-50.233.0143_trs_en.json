        "Young, Eva (n\u00e9e Miodelska)\nRG-50.233*0143\n1 Audio Tape\nAugust 1992\nWashington, D. C.\nAbstract\nEva Miodelska Young was born on October 27, 1926 in Lipsko, Poland, a town of 10,000\npeople, with several hundred Jews. When war started in 1939, the Germans began shooting\nJews, beginning with the most religious families. German established a ghetto and a curfew for\nJews. In 1942, Eva was taken to the concentration camp at Skarzysko-Kamienna to work in the\nammunition factory. She thinks her parents were sent to Treblinka. She never saw them again.\nHer parents had told her that they would leave valuables for her with a neighbor who had\npromised to care for her. Eva ran away from the camp and went home but the neighbor\nabandoned her in the woods. Germans found her, beat her, and eventually sent her to Majdanek\nfor ten weeks. She said that of some 15,000 people, only 150 survived. She was sent back to\nSkarzysko-Kamienna. She worked at ovens, where the heat reached 200 degrees, and applied\nlacquer to bullets. She and other inmates were beaten daily. When guards saw one male speaking\nwith a female, the guards forced them to have sex in front of the other inmates. He was later\nbeaten to death. Eva had a diamond in her tooth, and had it pulled without anesthesia, so she\ncould sell it. She used the money as a bribe for a better job, working in the kitchen.\nIn 1944, she was sent to Krups factory in Leipzig, to work with ammunition. In April 1945, she\nwas sent on a death march. She escaped after about ten days and made her way to the home of a\nGerman man who hid three other Jewish girls. While working in fields, they came upon Russian\nsoldiers who wanted to kill them, thinking the girls were spies, and then tried to rape them. Eva\nyelled \u2018Sh'ma Israel\u2019, and a Russian Jewish soldier told his comrades to stop, and leave.\nAfter liberation, she went first to Holland, and was among the first survivors there. She began\nworking with Berihah to organize survivors for passage to Palestine. They sent her to France.\nShe decided to go to Palestine, where English soldiers incarcerated her and her shipmates in a\ncamp for ten days in March 1946. She says she was pressured strongly to work secretly, building\nMolotov cocktails for the 1948 war. She married and had two children. The family emigrated to\nthe United States and settled in Brooklyn in 1959. Her husband died and later she remarried.\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

        "Side A\nMy name is Eva Miodelska from birth; now from marriage, Eva Young. I was born in Poland,\nLipsko---(3), K---. I was born on October 27, 1926. I had a sister, whose name was Tina\nMiodelska, and two brothers, Moshe, Vanhil. My father's name was Israel Miodelska and my\nmother's name was Zelda Miodelska. My father was a businessman and my mother was a\nhousewife.\nWhat kind of business was he involved with?\nWell, we had leather goods and some kind of a factory. We bought wood in the forest and we\nmade like thin, like sheets, thin sheets---\nLike kindling or something?\nThin sheets from wood. They were used for shoes. In 1942, there was a ghetto in Lipsko. It\nwas a small town. I was taken to a concentration camp in 1942. I was taken by force, of course.\nThey came in with big cars and they threw us in like cattle. They took us to the concentration\ncamp at Skarzysko-Kamienna which is near Radom. It was an ammunition factory. They were\nbringing people from Warsaw and places nearby. We worked there in very, very terrible\nconditions. There were about 1500, or between 1200 and 1500 people in one room which was\ncalled \u201caugrin\u201d (21). There was a lot of typhus, a lot of terrible things going on and every time\nthey came and they put us in the line in the roll count, they took out people to kill. Nobody knew\nif he would survive the following day. But they picked us out. Certain people went to work for\nall kind of factories, all kind of parts in the factory\u2019s sections. I was working, but I ran away\nfrom there. That time I went back to my little town, my hometown, because my father had told\nme that we had a neighbor, a Polish family, who would help me. They probably would be gone;\nthey were talking that they would be evacuated and taken to concentration camps or killed. I\nshould be aware of the fact that they left money, gold, quilts, linen, forme. In case I survive, I\nshould have where to go and the neighbor would take care of me because it was a close friend of\nhis. So it was constantly on my mind that I had where to go, in case my parents would be--with\nthe brother and sister--would be evacuated. So one day, I ran away from there and I went back\nto my hometown after the evacuation of my parents. I didn't hear from them. But when I was in\nSkarzysko, we saw people in the railroads, on the trains, taking them to Treblinka. From this\npart of Poland, they took them to Treblinka. We saw them when we were crying, they were\ncrying and we were--we knew that they were going somehow to the gas chambers. But after we\nsaw the transport, that was in September, close to September, I didn't hear from my parents any\nmore. I knew that they probably went to Treblinka with the transports we saw them bringing--\npassing by with the trains. I ran away from the concentration camp, from Skarzysko and I went\nback home.\nHow did you arrange that?\nI just walked out.\nJust walked out?\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

        "I was a child; I walked out. It was toward the evening and I walked. I had some money with\nme because--.\nWas it a camp that was heavily guarded? Or--?\nIt was guarded but not as heavily, not as heavily guarded. I had some money because my\nbrother, my younger brother--he was at that time, ten years old. His name was Moshe. When\nthe war broke out, there were bombs. In the city, they threw bombs, the Germans. They ruined,\nthere were a lot of broken houses. So it was a fire; the whole city was like in fire. He was, after\nthat, the following day was quiet, or a few days later, I don't recall exactly the dates but it was\napproximately that time. He cleaned up the bricks and put them together and put them like--\nstored them. Later on, the people--he was sitting and doing that instead of playing and running\naround, he was doing this kind of a thing. When it quieted down, people started to build their\nhouses from the ruins, so he sold them the bricks. He was in business being ten years old. He\nwas a very smart boy. When they took me to the concentration camp, he was running after me.\nHe said, \u201cHere is my money from the bricks I sold. Maybe this money would help you to\nsurvive.\u201d I didn't want to take it but he insisted that I should take it and he threw it in the car\nwhere I was. He was a child; they did not take him but they beat him up and he went home. So\nI had some money from him and I decided to go home to look for the Polish guy which my\nfather wrote and told me would guard me and be like my family.\nThis was after you left the concentration camp?\nI had it constantly in my mind. So I left the concentration camp, escaped, with the money to my\nlittle town. When I got there, my parents were not there, but I went to this Polish family which\nwas right next to us. He kissed me and he hugged me and they said, \u201cOh my child, I will take\ncare. There's no problem, I promised your father I will take care of you.\u201d I was very happy--\nthey gave me food to eat, they put me to sleep. I did not tell them where I came from but I just--\nhere Iam. The following day, he said in the evening he's going to take me someplace, so I was\nvery happy. I didn't care where he was going to take me as long as I knew somebody was going\nto take care of me. In the evening, he put me in a buggy, a horse and buggy and he took me to a\nforest. He went in a little bit, maybe 10, 15 minutes deep to the forest. He left me there. He\nsaid, \u201cMy child, you sit here. I have to go someplace. I will be back in about half hour or so.\u201d\nHe never came back. I was traveling; I was walking through the forest at night until the\nmorning. It was like six, seven o'clock in the morning, I found myself on a road. The German\nbuses were passing by, loaded with German soldiers. [Male voice: in trucks]. In trucks, big\ntrucks, open trucks, like for the military. One, they stopped, one car stopped and they went on\nand they said to me, \u201cWhat are you doing here; are you Jewish?\u201d I said, \u201cNo, I'm not Jewish.\u201d I\nwas speaking fluent Polish so there was no sign that Iam Jewish. But one said, \u201cI think she's\nJewish,\u201d and they started beating me up. One German said, \u201cWell, don't beat her up. Take her\nwith us and we\u2019ll bring her over to the people from the Warsaw ghetto resistance.\u201d That time I\nwent with them. They started to joke around but I made believe that I didn't understand what\nthey were saying. When we got there, to a concentration place, where they concentrate all these\npeople from Warsaw ghetto, that was in April, probably in the beginning, must be the tenth of\nApril or the--must be before, about the 8th or the 9th-",

        "Sometime in April then?\nThat's right because the 15th of April, I found myself in Majdanek with the transport. There\nwhere I was in Majdanek for ten weeks.\nDo you remember, just to go back just a little bit--. When you left the concentration camp and\nyou went to this person's house, you left for the forest. Do you remember about what time that\nwas? What year?\nWell, I do remember because in the concentration camp, I mean in Majdanek, I went in ae\nThe end of '42, you were in that --- (93)?\nThey were taking, in September, they were taking the parents. That was before Rosh Hashonah,\nbefore the Jewish holidays. That time--I'm still lighting a candle in the memory of my parents\nbefore Rosh Hashonah because that was the time when I saw them taking them on the railroad\nwith the trains. The railroad was right next to the camp at Skarzysko. We could see the faces; it\nwasn't that far. We had a gate, we couldn't go over the other side; it was on the other side of the\ngate. But right behind the gate, there was the train, the railroad. That time I was in Majdanek\nfor ten weeks. They started to select us every day. There was, of course, waiting for the dead\nbecause they were putting us on a count-row (102). Every day they were counting us; this day\nwe're out every fifth one; the following day, people were afraid to stay in the fifth place because\nmaybe they would take you. But we knew that the one who was going to be the fifth would be\ndead. Then they picked the seventh or the eighth. One never knew when would be his time to\nget killed. We were at that time, about 15,000 people, survived by 150. From my particular\ncamp, place, there were more people. But our people, they started selecting us and taking us to\nall kinds of camps, all kinds of different concentration camps. I was lucky. They sent me to\nSkarzysko; they sent me back to Skarzysko. That time I fell into a very difficult job. I had a\nvery difficult job. I was working at ovens where they used to lacquer the capsules from the\nbullets. The reason they lacquered them was because they used to make the capsules from\naluminum, from copper. But they ran out of copper--they couldn't get any more copper so they\nstarted doing it with aluminum. In order not to get rusted or wet from the rain or from the snow,\nthey had to lacquer them to prevent them from getting rusted.\nFrom corroding, yes.\nThat's right. I was working by the ovens--it was a very tough job and a very difficult job\nbecause it was constantly staying eight hours in one spot, taking off the capsules. We had to\npick them up like in a comb, a big, long comb. They were falling down. They were made like\na board which they folded down. Every capsule folded down this way and we had to pick\nthem up. They had to be full. In order not to do any sabotage, not to erase the little teeth, they\nhad to be all picked up at the same time. That was about--over 200 degrees. We had to stay\nthere and face the heat. In the beginning, in the morning they used to give us gloves in order,\nThe following transcript is the result of a recorded interview.

        "long to find out that we were there to face the gas chamber. Like every day, every hour,\nwhoever was close to each other, we made friends with strangers. We didn't know each other\nbut we became, in no time, we became like one family. We were kissing each other; we'll be\nalive tomorrow, maybe we'll see you tomorrow maybe not. If not, go and pray for us,\nwhatever.\nCan you describe to me a little bit about Majdanek? About how it was guarded? Was it a large\ncamp, how it was situated?\nIt was a large camp because there were hundreds, thousands of people there. Yes. It was very\nheavily guarded, very heavily guarded. There were two barracks, two small barracks; with the\nbarracks was the crematorium. First they said to the people that you going in to take a shower.\nThey didn't tell them they're going to gas them. You had to leave the clothes here. I wasn't\ninside because if I would be inside, I wouldn't come out. So I don't know how it was inside.\nThe people who were inside never came out. We just assumed that that was going on. We had\nwitnesses. I had witnesses in different camps when we went in. In Leipzig, for example, they\nsaid we should go in, take a shower and leave everything here. When we finished taking the\nshower, they told us to go out one other door. When we got out from the other door, we had to\npick the striped clothing with a number on us to go in and register and get a number on the\nsleeve. My number was 804 in Leipzig, which I called out. We never went back and we never\nhad anything. That's all we had because several people had hidden gold, money whatever they\nbrought from home. But we couldn't get back, we came out from a different door and we got\ndifferent clothes. We never saw the same door. That was -- in Majdanek, was heavily guarded,\nvery heavily guarded. When they took us, they said that they would bring us--transfer us to a\ndifferent camp, they could only--. Everybody was very happy because it could only be better. It\ncouldn't be any worse. Here we were sitting and waiting to die and over there, either they will\ntake you there and die right away or we'll survive. There was only one question. Either they\nwill kill us the same day, there will be no pain any more so we were happy, we were very happy\nthat they took us out from there. Where we went, we didn't know. But later on, we find\nourselves in Skarzysko, where we saw a lot of people. It was a big camp.\nThey took you there by train?\nYes, that's right, by train.\nWere you working there? Is that why they took you, for labor?\nThat's right, the labor, sure. It was a very, very tough job. My boss was a Volks German. His\nname was Maiefski (190).\nHe was Polish though?\nPolish, a German; he used to live in Poland. He beat us up to death. He was beating us, blood\nwas pouring from us every day.

Because there were three works, three camps, three camps. In\nSkarzysko, there were three camps. One was A, the second B, and C. C was the worst. C,\npeople were working in a nicotine or quas (200) like acid, where people got yellow and green.\nThere was no way of surviving. It happened that this winter I was in a--get-together from\nSkarzysko and I found over there two men, who said they were in Work C. I looked at them\nand I started crying. I said, \u201cI don't believe you.\u201d He said, \u201cYeah, I was there.\u201d I said, \u201cHow\ndid you survive? How did you get out alive?\u201d He said, \u201cWell nobody believes it but we are\nalive.\u201d I went over to the wives and I said to them, \u201cYou don't even know what your\nhusband's been through because I was in the concentration camp and I saw them passing every\nday to work.\u201d I was crying constantly, that time I was crying.

She was\nan outsider because there were Polish people--\nThis was at Skarzysko?\nAt Skarzysko-Kamienna. She was from Skarzysko. She was working for a Jewish family and\nshe had a sentiment--they left her everything. But she came into work, she got paid. This\nlady, I told her, she was the only person I could have talked to and trusted to get me some\nmoney for the diamond, was her. I had no way, access to anybody. I was talking to her and I\nsaid I have a diamond in my tooth and I know I'm going to die here because I was beaten\nconstantly. Throwing the empty shells on my face, because I fell asleep because the hot, the\nheat from the oven staying for twelve hours working. I fell asleep while I was standing. They\ncouldn't work because if I didn't pick up the shells, they couldn't put it in to come down. So\nthe machine got broken. They got punished so they threw this, the empty shells in my head;\nthey were sharp to wake me up. I was bleeding constantly, every day like that. I had a lady\nthere. She said, \u201cYou know what? I will work here for you on two machines.\u201d Later on she\nmarried my uncle because she said she liked me so much, she wanted to be in the family. She\nwanted to adopt me as her child. She died of cancer. She helped me a lot, at least five\nminutes, ten minutes, to relieve me to go and wash my face from the blood. That was going\non for a long time until one day I decided there's no use to keep a diamond in the tooth. I will\nhave to sell it. Who's going to sell it for me? What am I going to do with the money? Where\nam I going to go? I found out, nobody told me but I just was thinking that the best place for\nme would be the kitchen. In the kitchen I would have food, I would work twice a day, two\nshifts, for the day shifts to cook and then for the evening shift to cook. But at least 1t would\nkeep me alive. I don't know if they wouldn't kill me but I would have something to eat. The\nlady, I told her, there was a doctor from Pieotrokow a dentist. He took, pulled my tooth out.\nOf course, it was out without anesthesia, without anything. He took out the diamond and I\nsold it. I got 1500 zlotys the lady gave me for the tooth.

In 1943, 1944, I was\nworking there in very difficult conditions, because we had to get up at four o'clock in the\nmorning, sometimes barefoot, to walk to work for two hours and two hours back. It was\nwinter, snow, rain, shine, we walked. During the night, they bombed Leipzig. England and\nthe Americans, they bombed. We were constantly running back and forth the whole night and\nfour o'clock in the morning we had to go to work. At work, we had to constantly be aware, in\nthe wake of everything. We didn't have food; they gave us very little when we got back from\nwork in the barracks. There was no time of resting whatever. Like a constant machine,\nworking back and forth. Then on the 15th April, yeah, April 15, everything happened on April\nthe 15th, it looks like. They put us together and they said we had to run. In Poland, in Ch---\n(302), there were, the people from Skarzysko, they emptied out the camps, Skarzysko, they\nclosed up the camp. I was the last one. They sent me to Leipzig because we were cooking for\nthe people who were working with the transport, transferring the machinery to Germany. We\nwere the last ones, but the whole camp, everyone went to Czestochowa (?) (307). They were\nliberated in January in Poland.\nIn 1944?\nOr 1945. We, in Leipzig, they put us on the death march.

We had--I don't know where they got food\nbut somehow ten days without food, you can\u2019t survive walking. But people were dying and\nthey were throwing them in the valleys. There were valleys where we were going by the forest.\nThey were pushing in the valleys like throwing them down. I was--my feet were swollen and I\nwas young. I could walk.

        "a forest--. The Germans, there were very, very many German people, they ran away too. So\nwe were very much under strict control. They were watching us, very much so. The German\nwomen took off, when they saw probably the news and they heard what was going on, they\ntook off their dresses and they put on them, like make-believe, they are the ones that come\nfrom the concentration camp. They threw away their clothing in the forest. I said to a friend of\nmine who was standing right next to me, I said, \u201cI'm not going any further. I'm staying in the\nforest resting. When everybody will leave, I will stay there. Either they will kill me because\neither way, I'm not surviving. It doesn't make any difference to me.\u201d She said, \u201cI'm staying\nwith you.\u201d We were staying for a few hours by ourselves until everybody left for the march\nagain by the Elba (340). There was a death march going, back and forth, all around. They\ndidn't have any specific place where to take us. Just walk without any reason, without any\nplace to go. That time, when we were left in the forest and everybody left, I said, \u201cNow we\nare free. Not exactly free but at least not on the march.\u201d There was a little river. I couldn't\nswim. My friend could swim so she jumped in the river, pulled me by my hair and she pulled\nme over to the other side. In the water, she said, \u201c\u201cYou hold on to me.\u201d That was Clara\n(K349). I got out on the other side. My dress was full with water and it was a heavy dress so I\nhad to wrinkle it out from the water and it was April, 1t was very cold. We were shivering, we\nhad nothing underneath, just the dress. But we survived; it looks like we survived. I am here.\nWe went there; we were walking and we got into a little village. We came upon a German\nfamily. We asked for pity, maybe they could help us. We escaped. We didn't say we are\nJewish, that we just escaped from concentration camp. Because we had the dresses on, we\ncouldn\u2019t say that we didn\u2019t come from the concentration camp.\nYou speak German or--?\nWe speak German good, yes. Not as fluently as Polish but we spoke. We said that we know\nJewish, but we are Polish. By the way, we made the sign of the cross, we crossed ourselves. We\nmade the prayers and said God sent us to you and you should save us. In German, he said, \u201cWell\nchildren, it's okay. Don't be afraid. I have some more people upstairs in my attic. Go upstairs\nand you will find some more people like you.\u201d We came up and we found over there three\nJewish girls. They were Ruth Charlon (368) and her two sisters, who later went to Belgium.\nHe was hiding all of them, yeah.\nHe was hiding them. No, he wasn't hiding them all the ttme.

But they had run away a few days earlier because they'd been going to work, to\nthe field, to work with the Germans. He gave them sandwiches and they were happy. In the\nevening, he gave them food. We got in the same category like the three other girls. In the\nmorning, he gave us a sandwich and he sent us; we went with them to work on the field. They\nmust have given us different clothing because we couldn't go with the same clothing with the\nstripes. I don't remember what happened but I must have gotten clothing from them. She must\nhave given me a dress or whatever and my friend, too. Anyhow, now we were free, not exactly\nfree but we were free. We had no striped clothing on and we were working in the field.

Kashmirzka 12.\nWere you involved in any youth organizations or that kind of thing when you were younger?\nWell, I was, as a child. As a matter of fact I was involved in Betar. It's like Girl Scouts.

They didn't have to say anything, they just\nsaid from this part of the city up to this street and this side of the city---. They just gave us the\nstreets which we could go up to. They didn't have to make any bars around, nothing.\nWas the ghetto there that they set up basically the Jewish part of the town anyway?\nJust for the Jewish people, yes. They took out the Jewish people from other places and they put\nthem in there. There were no gentile people mixed in, in the ghetto. Because people who used to\nlive a little farther, they had to leave their houses and come in to live there.\nDid--do you remember when the ghetto was set up in the town?

The camp and how it was?\nThe camp wasn't too big. But where we went to the camp, it wasn't huge, no, it wasn't. But we\nwere walking to the factory. The factories were quite--we walked to the factories about a half\nhour walk or maybe longer. There were different factories. The factories were huge, they were\nvery big.
